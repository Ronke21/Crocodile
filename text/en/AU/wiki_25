<text>Harewood House ( , ) is a country house in Harewood, West Yorkshire, England. Designed by architects John Carr and Robert Adam, it was built, between 1759 and 1771, for Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood, a wealthy West Indian plantation and slave owner. The landscape was designed by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown and spans at Harewood.

Still home to the Lascelles family, Harewood House is a member of the Treasure Houses of England, a marketing consortium for ten of the foremost historic homes in the country. The house is a Grade I listed building and a number of features in the grounds and courtyard have been listed as Grade I, II* and II.

==History==
===Early history===
The Harewood estate was created in its present size by merging two adjacent estates, the Harewood Castle estate based on Harewood Castle and the Gawthorpe estate based on the Gawthorpe Hall manor house (not to be confused with the Gawthorpe Hall near Burnley in Lancashire). The properties were combined when the Wentworths of Gawthorpe, who inherited the estate from the Gascoignes, bought the neighbouring Harewood estate from the Ryther family. The combined estate was sold to the London merchant Sir John Cutler in 1696, after whose death it passed to the Boulter family. They in turn sold it to the Lascelles in 1721.

===The Lascelles family===
In the late seventeenth century members of the Lascelles family purchased plantations in the West Indies, and the income generated allowed Henry Lascelles to purchase the estate in 1738; his son, Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood, a wealthy plantation and slave owner, built the house between 1759 and 1771 to replace Gawthorpe Hall, the original manor house on the estate.

Edwin employed the services of John Carr, an architect practising in the north of England who had been employed by a number of prominent Yorkshire families, to design their new country houses. The foundations were laid in 1759 and the house was largely complete by 1765. Robert Adam submitted designs for the interiors, which were approved in 1765. Adam made a number of minor alterations to Carr&#x27;s designs for the building&#x27;s exterior including internal courtyards. The house remained largely untouched until the 1840s when Sir Charles Barry was employed by Henry Lascelles, 3rd Earl of Harewood, the father of thirteen children, to increase the accommodation. Barry added second storeys to each of the flanking wings to provide extra bedrooms, removed the south portico and created formal parterres and terraces.

===20th century===
In 1922, Henry Lascelles, Viscount Lascelles married Princess Mary, the only daughter of George V. Initially living in the nearby Goldsborough Hall, the couple moved permanently into Harewood House on the death of Henry&#x27;s father in 1929.

During the Second World War, the house acted as a resident convalescent hospital but by the late 1940s, the Princess Royal and her family had moved permanently back to Harewood, where the house and gardens were regularly opened to the public. The estate also hosted concerts connected with musical institutions including the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra and the Leeds Musical Festival, of which the Princess was patron. 

On 28 March 1965, the Princess was walking the grounds of Harewood when she suffered a fatal heart attack. Her elder son, Lord Harewood, the 7th earl, succeeded his father in 1947, and resided at Harewood. He was director of the Royal Opera House and later of the English National Opera; nearer to Harewood, he was a member of the Leeds Music Festival&#x27;s executive committee and a patron of the Yorkshire Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s concerts.

Since 1947 the estate&#x27;s Dower House, which lies outside the estate boundaries, has been leased out for use as an independent school.

===21st century===
The house is the family seat of the Lascelles family, and home of David Lascelles, the eighth Earl. The house and grounds have been transferred into a trust ownership structure managed by Harewood House Trust and are open to the public for most of the year. Harewood won a &quot;Large Visitor Attraction of the Year&quot; award in the 2009 national &quot;Excellence in England&quot; awards.

Harewood houses a collection of paintings by masters of the Italian Renaissance, family portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, John Hoppner and Sir Thomas Lawrence, and modern art collected by the 7th Earl and Countess. Changing temporary exhibitions are held each season in the Terrace Gallery. Catering facilities in the house include Michelin-starred fine dining.

As well as tours of the house and grounds, Harewood has more than of gardens, including a Himalayan garden and its stupa, an educational bird garden (closed February 2023), an adventure playground and the historic All Saints&#x27; Church with its alabaster tombs. From May 2007 to October 2008 the grounds contained Yorkshire&#x27;s first planetarium, the Yorkshire Planetarium.

The Leeds Country Way passes through the Harewood Estate, to the south of the house and lake, as does the route of The White Rose Way.

In a 2005 documentary, David Lascelles spoke about his ancestors&#x27; links with the slave trade, and in 2007, as part of the &quot;BBC Look North&quot; programme, actor David Harewood visited the house and interviewed Lascelles, as his ancestors in Barbados had been enslaved by the Earls of Harewood. In March 2023, it was announced that a portrait of Harewood had been commissioned and would be hung in Harewood house.

==In popular culture==
Artist J. M. W. Turner visited the house and painted the outdoor landscape in watercolour around 1797–8. The house was used as a filming location for the 1991 comedy film &quot;King Ralph&quot;. Since 1996, part of the estate has been developed as the village in the ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, which had been based in two different Yorkshire villages since its inception 24 years earlier. Rock musician Elton John performed two concerts in the grounds in 1999. The popular ITV show &quot;Victoria&quot; starring Jenna Coleman and Tom Hughes has filmed at Harewood House. On 1 July 2006, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Face to Face Tour supporting their album &quot;Face to Face&quot;. Harewood House was used as a filming location for the 2019 &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; film in November 2018. The house was the location for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Mary Berry&#x27;s Country House at Christmas&quot; with Mary Berry, broadcast on Christmas Day 2018. The house and grounds were also used in filming a TV commercial for the Range Rover Sport automobile.

==Harewood Bird Garden &amp; Farm Experience==

The Bird Garden at Harewood House had a small collection of exotic bird species, of which more than 5 were listed as vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. It was a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA).

Birds that could be seen in the garden included Humboldt penguins, Chilean flamingos, Duyvenbode&#x27;s lories and macaws.

In January 2023 the trustees of Harewood announced their decision to close the Bird Garden: the exact date would be announced later in the year. The Farm Experience would remain open. The area occupied by the Bird Garden would be redeveloped as a new woodland garden, including reinstating some historic walks. New homes would be found for all the birds. The trustees said that the last inspection had &quot;identified many problems with the site&#x27;s physical infrastructure&quot; which would require £4 million to be spent, and they &quot;had to make the incredibly difficult decision to close this part of the Harewood experience&quot;.

<doc id="149893" wikidata="Q731407" url="?curid=149893" title="Constant Lambert">
<text>Leonard Constant Lambert (23 August 190521 August 1951) was a British composer, conductor, and author. He was the founding music director of the Royal Ballet, and (alongside Dame Ninette de Valois and Sir Frederick Ashton) he was a major figure in the establishment of the English ballet as a significant artistic movement.

His ballet commitments, including extensive conducting work throughout his life, restricted his compositional activities. However one work, &quot;The Rio Grande&quot;, for chorus, orchestra and piano soloist, achieved widespread popularity in the 1920s, and is still regularly performed today. His other work includes a jazz influenced Piano Concerto (1931), major ballet scores such as &quot;Horoscope&quot; (1937) and a full-scale choral masque &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot; (1936) that some consider his masterpiece.

Lambert had wide-ranging interests beyond music, as can be seen from his critical study &quot;Music Ho!&quot; (1934), which places music in the context of the other arts. His friends included John Maynard Keynes, Anthony Powell and the Sitwells. To Keynes, Lambert was perhaps the most brilliant man he had ever met; to de Valois he was the greatest ballet conductor and advisor his country had ever had; to the composer Denis ApIvor he was the most entertaining personality of the musical world.

==Early life and music==

The son of Australian painter George Lambert and his wife Amy, and the younger brother of Maurice Lambert, Constant Lambert was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital near Horsham in West Sussex. While still a boy he demonstrated formidable musical gifts, and wrote his first orchestral work at the age of 13. In September 1922 Lambert entered the Royal College of Music, where his teachers were Ralph Vaughan Williams, R. O. Morris and Sir George Dyson (composition), Malcolm Sargent (conducting) and Herbert Fryer (piano). His contemporaries there included the pianist Angus Morrison, conductor Guy Warrack, Thomas Armstrong (a future head of the Royal Academy of Music), and the composers Gavin Gordon, Patrick Hadley and Gordon Jacob. 

In 1925 (at the age of 20) he received a high profile commission to write a ballet for Sergei Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes (&quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, 1926, choreographed by Nijinska). For a few years he enjoyed celebrity, through the broader success of his next ballet (the neo-classical &quot;Pomona&quot; of 1927, choreographed again by Nijinska), and through his participation as narrator in many public performances (and a recording) of William Walton and Edith Sitwell&#x27;s controversial &quot;Façade&quot;.

==Jazz influence==
Lambert&#x27;s best-known composition followed. &quot;The Rio Grande&quot; (1927), for piano and alto soloists, chorus, and orchestra of brass, strings and percussion, sets a poem by Sacheverell Sitwell. It achieved considerable success, and Lambert made two recordings of the piece as conductor (1930 and 1949). He had a great interest in African-American music, and once said that he would have ideally liked &quot;The Rio Grande&quot; to feature a black choir. He held a very positive view of jazz rhythms and their incorporation in classical music saying once that:

Lambert was to take his interest in jazz much further in works such as the Piano Sonata (1929) and the &quot;Concerto for piano and nine Instruments&quot; (1931), where the style moves away from the &quot;symphonic jazz&quot; of Gershwin and Paul Whiteman to something much more tense and urban, with popular and formal elements of composition closely integrated, rhythms jagged and extreme, and harmony sometimes approaching atonalism. The second movement of the Sonata features a blues in rondo form. The Concerto&#x27;s unusual chamber scoring becomes something of a hybrid between a jazz band and the ensemble used in Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Pierrot Lunaire&quot;.

==Later career==

Lambert was appointed in 1931 as conductor and music director of the Vic-Wells ballet (later The Royal Ballet), but his career as a composer stagnated. His major choral work &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot; (1935, after the play of the same name by Thomas Nashe), one of his most emotionally dark works, proved unfashionable in the mood following the death of King George V, but Alan Frank hailed it at the time as Lambert&#x27;s &quot;finest work&quot;.

The Second World War took its toll on his vitality and creativity. He was ruled unfit for active service in the armed forces; decades of hard drinking had impaired his health, which declined further with the development of diabetes that remained undiagnosed and untreated until very late in his life. Lambert&#x27;s childhood experiences (which included a near-fatal bout of septicaemia) had given him a lifelong detestation and fear of the medical profession.

Lambert himself considered he had failed as a composer, and completed only two major works after the disappointment of &quot;Summer&#x27;s Last Will and Testament&quot; - they were the ballet scores &quot;Horoscope&quot; (1938) and &quot;Tiresias&quot; (1951) - though there were also several smaller works, such as the white-note piano four hands suite &quot;Trois pièces nègres pour les touches blanches&quot;, written for the identical twin piano duo Mary and Geraldine Peppin. Instead he concentrated mostly on conducting, working closely with the Royal Ballet until his resignation in 1947. He continued to be featured as a guest conductor until shortly before his death in 1951.

==Broader cultural interests==
An expert on painting, sculpture, and literature as well as music, Lambert differed from most of his fellow English composers of the time in his perception of the importance of jazz. He responded positively to the music of Duke Ellington. His embrace of music outside the &#x27;serious&#x27; repertoire is illustrated by his book &quot;Music Ho!&quot; (1934), subtitled &quot;a study of music in decline&quot;, which remains one of the wittiest, if most highly opinionated, volumes of music criticism in the English language.

Lambert&#x27;s father, while born in Russia and of American heritage, viewed himself as first and foremost an Australian. Constant was always conscious of his Australian connections, although he never visited that country. For the first performance of his Piano Concerto (1931), rather than select a British-born pianist, Lambert chose the Sydney-born, Brisbane-trained Arthur Benjamin to play the solo part. Despite his disapproval of homosexuality he formed a good working relationship with Benjamin&#x27;s fellow Australian Robert Helpmann. Afterwards he entrusted yet another Australian musician, Gordon Watson, with the task of playing the virtuoso piano part at the première of his last ballet, &quot;Tiresias&quot;.

==Personal life==

Lambert&#x27;s first marriage was to Florence Kaye, on 5 August 1931; their son was Kit Lambert, one of the managers of The Who, named after his friend the painter Christopher &quot;Kit&quot; Wood. But he was soon engaged in an on-and-off affair with the ballet dancer Margot Fonteyn. According to friends of Fonteyn, Lambert was the great love of her life and she despaired when she finally realised he would never marry her. Some aspects of this relationship were symbolised in his ballet &quot;Horoscope&quot; (1938), in which Fonteyn was a principal dancer. After divorcing Kaye, in 1947 Lambert married the artist Isabel Delmer, who designed the stage sets and costumes for his ballet &quot;Tiresias&quot;; after his death, she married Alan Rawsthorne. In 1945 Florence married Charles Edward Peter Hole; their daughter Anne later took the stage name Annie Lambert. During the 1930s Lambert also had a long affair and friendship with Laureen Goodare (mother of actress Cleo Sylvestre, Constant&#x27;s goddaughter). Laureen was a dancer and cigarette girl at the Shim Sham Club in Wardour Street, Soho. Their affair lasted until his untimely death in 1951. 

Close friends of his included Michael Ayrton, Sacheverell Sitwell and Anthony Powell. He was the prototype of the character Hugh Moreland in Powell&#x27;s &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, particularly in the fifth volume, &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Chinese Restaurant&quot;, in which Moreland is a central character.

Lambert died on 21 August 1951, two days short of his forty-sixth birthday, of pneumonia and undiagnosed diabetes complicated by acute alcoholism, and was buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. His son Kit was buried in the same grave in 1981.

<doc id="149895" wikidata="Q334252" url="?curid=149895" title="R. K. Narayan">
<text>Rasipuram Krishnaswami Narayanaswami (10 October 1906 – 13 May 2001), better known as R. K. Narayan, was an Indian writer and novelist known for his work set in the fictional South Indian town of Malgudi. He was a leading author of early Indian literature in English along with Mulk Raj Anand and Raja Rao.

Narayan&#x27;s mentor and friend Graham Greene was instrumental in getting publishers for Narayan&#x27;s first four books including the semi-autobiographical trilogy of &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, &quot;The Bachelor of Arts&quot; and &quot;The English Teacher&quot;. 
Narayan highlights the social context and everyday life of his characters. He has been compared to William Faulkner who created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humor and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan&#x27;s short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative.

In a career that spanned over sixty years Narayan received many awards and honours including the AC Benson Medal from the Royal Society of Literature, the Padma Vibhushan and the Padma Bhushan, India&#x27;s second and third highest civilian awards, and in 1994 the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour of India&#x27;s National Academy of Letters. He was also nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament.

==Life and career==
===Early life===

R. K. Narayan was born in a Tamil Hindu family on 10 October 1906 in Madras (now Chennai, Tamil Nadu), British India. He was one of eight children; six sons and two daughters. Narayan was second among the sons; his younger brother Ramachandran later became an editor at Gemini Studios, and the youngest brother Laxman became a cartoonist. His father was a school headmaster, and Narayan did some of his studies at his father&#x27;s school. As his father&#x27;s job entailed frequent transfers, Narayan spent a part of his childhood under the care of his maternal grandmother, Parvati. During this time, his best friends and playmates were a peacock and a mischievous monkey.

His grandmother gave him the nickname of &quot;Kunjappa&quot;, a name that stuck to him in family circles. She taught him arithmetic, mythology, classical Indian music and Sanskrit. According to Laxman, the family mostly conversed in English, and grammatical errors on the part of Narayan and his siblings were frowned upon. While living with his grandmother, Narayan studied at a succession of schools in Madras, including the Lutheran Mission School in Purasawalkam, C.R.C. High School, and the Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School. Narayan was an avid reader, and his early literary diet included Dickens, Wodehouse, Arthur Conan Doyle and Thomas Hardy. When he was twelve years old, Narayan participated in a pro-independence march, for which he was reprimanded by his uncle; the family was apolitical and considered all governments wicked.

Narayan moved to Mysore to live with his family when his father was transferred to the Maharaja&#x27;s College High School. The well-stocked library at the school and his father&#x27;s own fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor&#x27;s degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master&#x27;s degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of &quot;Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England&quot;. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.
While vacationing at his sister&#x27;s house in Coimbatore, in 1933, Narayan met and fell in love with Rajam, a 15-year-old girl who lived nearby. Despite many astrological and financial obstacles, Narayan managed to gain permission from the girl&#x27;s father and married her. Following his marriage, Narayan became a reporter for a Madras-based paper called &quot;The Justice&quot;, dedicated to the rights of non-Brahmins. The publishers were thrilled to have a Brahmin Iyer in Narayan espousing their cause. The job brought him in contact with a wide variety of people and issues. Earlier, Narayan had sent the manuscript of &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; to a friend at Oxford, and about this time, the friend showed the manuscript to Graham Greene. Greene recommended the book to his publisher, and it was finally published in 1935. Greene also counselled Narayan on shortening his name to become more familiar to the English-speaking audience. The book was semi-autobiographical and built upon many incidents from his own childhood. Reviews were favourable but sales were few. Narayan&#x27;s next novel &quot;The Bachelor of Arts&quot; (1937), was inspired in part by his experiences at college, and dealt with the theme of a rebellious adolescent transitioning to a rather well-adjusted adult; it was published by a different publisher, again at the recommendation of Greene. His third novel, &quot;The Dark Room&quot; (1938) was about domestic disharmony, showcasing the man as the oppressor and the woman as the victim within a marriage, and was published by yet another publisher; this book also received good reviews. In 1937, Narayan&#x27;s father died, and Narayan was forced to accept a commission from the government of Mysore as he was not making any money.

In his first three books, Narayan highlights the problems with certain socially accepted practices. The first book has Narayan focusing on the plight of students, punishments of caning in the classroom, and the associated shame. The concept of horoscope-matching in Hindu marriages and the emotional toll it levies on the bride and groom is covered in the second book. In the third book, Narayan addresses the concept of a wife putting up with her husband&#x27;s antics and attitudes.

Rajam died because of typhoid in 1939. Her death affected Narayan deeply and he remained depressed for a long time. He never remarried in his life; he was also concerned for their daughter Hema, who was only three years old. The bereavement brought about a significant change in his life and was the inspiration behind his next novel, &quot;The English Teacher&quot;. This book, like his first two books, is autobiographical, but more so, and completes an unintentional thematic trilogy following &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; and &quot;The Bachelor of Arts&quot;. In subsequent interviews, Narayan acknowledges that &quot;The English Teacher&quot; was almost entirely an autobiography, albeit with different names for the characters and the change of setting in Malgudi; he also explains that the emotions detailed in the book reflected his own at the time of Rajam&#x27;s death.

Bolstered by some of his successes, in 1940, Narayan tried his hand at a journal, &quot;Indian Thought&quot;. With the help of his uncle, a car salesman, Narayan managed to get more than a thousand subscribers in Madras city alone. However, the venture did not last long due to Narayan&#x27;s inability to manage it, and it ceased publication within a year. His first collection of short stories, &quot;Malgudi Days&quot;, was published in November 1942, followed by &quot;The English Teacher&quot; in 1945. In between, being cut off from England due to the war, Narayan started his own publishing company, naming it (again) Indian Thought Publications; the publishing company was a success and is still active, now managed by his granddaughter. Soon, with a devoted readership stretching from New York to Moscow, Narayan&#x27;s books started selling well and, in 1948, he started building his own house on the outskirts of Mysore; the house was completed in 1953. Around this period, Narayan wrote the story for the Gemini Studios film &quot;Miss Malini&quot; (1947), which remained the only story written by him for the screen that came to fruition.

===The busy years===
After &quot;The English Teacher&quot;, Narayan&#x27;s writings took a more imaginative and creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from some of his own experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published &quot;The Financial Expert&quot;, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed as one of the most original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, &quot;Margayya&quot;, related to him by his brother. The next novel, &quot;Waiting for the Mahatma&quot;, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist&#x27;s romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the discourses of the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi&#x27;s discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan&#x27;s usual dose of irony.
In 1953, his works were published in the United States for the first time, by Michigan State University Press, who later (in 1958), relinquished the rights to Viking Press. While Narayan&#x27;s writings often bring out the anomalies in social structures and views, he was himself a traditionalist; in February 1956, Narayan arranged his daughter&#x27;s wedding following all orthodox Hindu rituals. After the wedding, Narayan began travelling occasionally, continuing to write at least 1500 words a day even while on the road. &quot;The Guide&quot; was written while he was visiting the United States in 1956 on the Rockefeller Fellowship. While in the U.S., Narayan maintained a daily journal that was to later serve as the foundation for his book &quot;My Dateless Diary&quot;. Around this time, on a visit to England, Narayan met his friend and mentor Graham Greene for the first and only time. On his return to India, &quot;The Guide&quot; was published; the book is the most representative of Narayan&#x27;s writing skills and elements, ambivalent in expression, coupled with a riddle-like conclusion. The book won him the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1960.

Occasionally, Narayan was known to give form to his thoughts by way of essays, some published in newspapers and journals, others not. &quot;Next Sunday&quot; (1960), was a collection of such conversational essays, and his first work to be published as a book. Soon after that, &quot;My Dateless Diary&quot;, describing experiences from his 1956 visit to the United States, was published. Also included in this collection was an essay about the writing of &quot;The Guide&quot;.

Narayan&#x27;s next novel, &quot;The Man-Eater of Malgudi&quot;, was published in 1961. The book was reviewed as having a narrative that is a classical art form of comedy, with delicate control. After the launch of this book, the restless Narayan once again took to travelling, and visited the U.S. and Australia. He spent three weeks in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne giving lectures on Indian literature. The trip was funded by a fellowship from the Australian Writers&#x27; Group. By this time Narayan had also achieved significant success, both literary and financial. He had a large house in Mysore, and wrote in a study with no fewer than eight windows; he drove a new Mercedes-Benz, a luxury in India at that time, to visit his daughter who had moved to Coimbatore after her marriage. With his success, both within India and abroad, Narayan started writing columns for magazines and newspapers including &quot;The Hindu&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

In 1964, Narayan published his first mythological work, &quot;Gods, Demons and Others&quot;, a collection of rewritten and translated short stories from Hindu epics. Like many of his other works, this book was illustrated by his younger brother R. K. Laxman. The stories included were a selective list, chosen on the basis of powerful protagonists, so that the impact would be lasting, irrespective of the reader&#x27;s contextual knowledge. Once again, after the book launch, Narayan took to travelling abroad. In an earlier essay, he had written about the Americans wanting to understand spirituality from him, and during this visit, Swedish-American actress Greta Garbo accosted him on the topic, despite his denial of any knowledge.

Narayan&#x27;s next published work was the 1967 novel, &quot;The Vendor of Sweets&quot;. It was inspired in part by his American visits and consists of extreme characterizations of both the Indian and American stereotypes, drawing on the many cultural differences. However, while it displays his characteristic comedy and narrative, the book was reviewed as lacking in depth. This year, Narayan travelled to England, where he received the first of his honorary doctorates from the University of Leeds. The next few years were a quiet period for him. He published his next book, a collection of short stories, &quot;A Horse and Two Goats&quot;, in 1970. Meanwhile, Narayan remembered a promise made to his dying uncle in 1938, and started translating the Kamba Ramayanam to English. &quot;The Ramayana&quot; was published in 1973, after five years of work. Almost immediately after publishing &quot;The Ramayana&quot;, Narayan started working on a condensed translation of the Sanskrit epic, the Mahabharata. While he was researching and writing the epic, he also published another book, &quot;The Painter of Signs&quot; (1977). &quot;The Painter of Signs&quot; is a bit longer than a novella and makes a marked change from Narayan&#x27;s other works, as he deals with hitherto unaddressed subjects such as sex, although the development of the protagonist&#x27;s character is very similar to his earlier creations. &quot;The Mahabharata&quot; was published in 1978.

===The later years===
Narayan was commissioned by the government of Karnataka to write a book to promote tourism in the state. The work was published as part of a larger government publication in the late 1970s He thought it deserved better, and republished it as &quot;The Emerald Route&quot; (Indian Thought Publications, 1980). The book contains his personal perspective on the local history and heritage, but being bereft of his characters and creations, it misses his enjoyable narrative. The same year, he was elected as an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and won the AC Benson Medal from the Royal Society of Literature. Around the same time, Narayan&#x27;s works were translated to Chinese for the first time.

In 1983, Narayan published his next novel, &quot;A Tiger for Malgudi&quot;, about a tiger and its relationship with humans. His next novel, &quot;Talkative Man&quot;, published in 1986, was the tale of an aspiring journalist from Malgudi. During this time, he also published two collections of short stories: &quot;Malgudi Days&quot; (1982), a revised edition including the original book and some other stories, and &quot;Under the Banyan Tree and Other Stories&quot;, a new collection. In 1987, he completed &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Nightmare&quot;, another collection of essays about topics as diverse as the caste system, Nobel prize winners, love, and monkeys. The collection included essays he had written for newspapers and magazines since 1958.

Living alone in Mysore, Narayan developed an interest in agriculture. He bought an acre of agricultural land and tried his hand at farming. He was also prone to walking to the market every afternoon, not so much for buying things, but to interact with the people. In a typical afternoon stroll, he would stop every few steps to greet and converse with shopkeepers and others, most likely gathering material for his next book.

In 1980, Narayan was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Indian Parliament, for his contributions to literature. During his entire six-year term, he was focused on one issue—the plight of school children, especially the heavy load of school books and the negative effect of the system on a child&#x27;s creativity, which was something that he first highlighted in his debut novel, &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;. His inaugural speech was focused on this particular problem, and resulted in the formation of a committee chaired by Prof. Yash Pal, to recommend changes to the school educational system.

In 1990, he published his next novel, &quot;The World of Nagaraj&quot;, also set in Malgudi. Narayan&#x27;s age shows in this work as he appears to skip narrative details that he would have included if this were written earlier in his career. Soon after he finished the novel, Narayan fell ill and moved to Madras to be close to his daughter&#x27;s family. A few years after his move, in 1994, his daughter died of cancer and his granddaughter Bhuvaneswari (Minnie) started taking care of him in addition to managing &quot;Indian Thought Publications&quot;. Narayan then published his final book, &quot;Grandmother&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The book is an autobiographical novella, about his great-grandmother who travelled far and wide to find her husband, who ran away shortly after their marriage. The story was narrated to him by his grandmother, when he was a child.

During his final years, Narayan, ever fond of conversation, would spend almost every evening with N. Ram, the publisher of &quot;The Hindu&quot;, drinking coffee and talking about various topics until well past midnight. Despite his fondness of meeting and talking to people, he stopped giving interviews. The apathy towards interviews was the result of an interview with &quot;Time&quot;, after which Narayan had to spend a few days in the hospital, as he was dragged around the city to take photographs that were never used in the article.

In May 2001, Narayan was hospitalised. A few hours before he was to be put on a ventilator, he was planning on writing his next novel, a story about a grandfather. As he was always very selective about his choice of notebooks, he asked N. Ram to get him one. However, Narayan did not get better and never started the novel. He died a few days later on 13 May 2001, in Chennai at the age of 94.

==Literary review==
===Writing style===
Narayan&#x27;s writing technique was unpretentious with a natural element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability to relate to the topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the intricacies of Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to confirm to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the &quot;Indian Chekhov&quot;, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; considered Narayan&#x27;s writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.

According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan&#x27;s short stories have the same captivating feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds that Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight to the lives of his character between the title sentence and the ends. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O&#x27;Connor and Flannery O&#x27;Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the story, and the common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision. V. S. Naipaul noted that he &quot;wrote from deep within his community&quot;, and did not, in his treatment of characters, &quot;put his people on display&quot;.

Critics have noted that Narayan&#x27;s writings tend to be more descriptive and less analytical; the objective style, rooted in a detached spirit, providing for a more authentic and realistic narration. His attitude, coupled with his perception of life, provided a unique ability to fuse characters and actions, and an ability to use ordinary events to create a connection in the mind of the reader. A significant contributor to his writing style was his creation of Malgudi, a stereotypical small town, where the standard norms of superstition and tradition apply.

Narayan&#x27;s writing style was often compared to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.

===Malgudi===
Malgudi is a fictional fully urban town in southern India, conjured by Narayan. He created the town in September 1930, on Vijayadashami, an auspicious day to start new efforts and thus chosen for him by his grandfather. As he mentioned in a later interview to his biographers Susan and N. Ram, in his mind, he first saw a railway station, and slowly the name &quot;Malgudi&quot; came to him. The fictional town of Malgudi was first introduced in &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;.

The town was created with an impeccable historical record, dating to the Ramayana days when it was noted that Lord Rama passed through; it was also said that the Buddha visited the town during his travels. While Narayan never provided strict physical constraints for the town, he allowed it to form shape with events in various stories, becoming a reference point for the future. Dr James M. Fennelly, a scholar of Narayan&#x27;s works, created a map of Malgudi based on the fictional descriptors of the town from the many books and stories.

Malgudi evolved with the changing political landscape of India. In the 1980s, when the nationalistic fervor in India dictated the changing of British names of towns and localities and removal of British landmarks, Malgudi&#x27;s mayor and city council removed the long-standing statue of Frederick Lawley, one of Malgudi&#x27;s early residents. However, when the Historical Societies showed proof that Lawley was strong in his support of the Indian independence movement, the council was forced to undo all their earlier actions. A good comparison to Malgudi, a place that Greene characterised as &quot;more familiar than Battersea or Euston Road&quot;, is Faulkner&#x27;s Yoknapatawpha County. Also, like Faulkner&#x27;s, when one looks at Narayan&#x27;s works, the town gets a better definition through the many different novels and stories.

===Critical reception===
Narayan first broke through with the help of Graham Greene who, upon reading &quot;Swaminathan and Tate&quot;, took it upon himself to work as Narayan&#x27;s agent for the book. He was also significant in changing the title to the more appropriate &quot;Swami and Friends&quot;, and in finding publishers for Narayan&#x27;s next few books. While Narayan&#x27;s early works were not commercial successes, other authors of the time began to notice him. 

Somerset Maugham, on a trip to Mysore in 1938, had asked to meet Narayan, but not enough people had heard of him to actually effect the meeting. Maugham subsequently read Narayan&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Room&quot;, and wrote to him expressing his admiration. Another contemporary writer who took a liking to Narayan&#x27;s early works was E. M. Forster, an author who shared his dry and humorous narrative, so much so that Narayan was labeled the &quot;South Indian E. M. Forster&quot; by critics. Despite his popularity with the reading public and fellow writers, Narayan&#x27;s work has not received the same amount of critical exploration accorded to other writers of his stature.

Narayan&#x27;s success in the United States came a little later, when Michigan State University Press started publishing his books. His first visit to the country was on a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and he lectured at various universities including Michigan State University and the University of California, Berkeley. Around this time, John Updike noticed his work and compared Narayan to Charles Dickens. In a review of Narayan&#x27;s works published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Updike called him a writer of a vanishing breed—the writer as a citizen; one who identifies completely with his subjects and with a belief in the significance of humanity.

Having published many novels, essays and short stories, Narayan is credited with bringing Indian writing to the rest of the world. While he has been regarded as one of India&#x27;s greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. &quot;The Financial Expert&quot; was hailed as one of the most original works of 1951 and Sahitya Academy Award winner &quot;The Guide&quot; was adapted for the film (winning a Filmfare Award for Best Film) and for Broadway.

Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan&#x27;s subjects are similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen&#x27;s prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan&#x27;s was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan&#x27;s writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.

A general perception on Narayan was that he did not involve himself or his writings with the politics or problems of India, as mentioned by V. S. Naipaul in one of his columns. However, according to Wyatt Mason of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, although Narayan&#x27;s writings seem simple and display a lack of interest in politics, he delivers his narrative with an artful and deceptive technique when dealing with such subjects and does not entirely avoid them, rather letting the words play in the reader&#x27;s mind. K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar, former vice-chancellor of Andhra University, says that Narayan wrote about political topics only in the context of his subjects, quite unlike his compatriot Mulk Raj Anand who dealt with the political structures and problems of the time. Paul Brians, in his book &quot;Modern South Asian Literature in English&quot;, says that the fact that Narayan completely ignored British rule and focused on the private lives of his characters is a political statement on its own, declaring his independence from the influence of colonialism.

In the west, Narayan&#x27;s simplicity of writing was well received. One of his biographers, William Walsh, wrote of his narrative as a comedic art with an inclusive vision informed by the transience and illusion of human action. Multiple Booker nominee Anita Desai classes his writings as &quot;compassionate realism&quot; where the cardinal sins are unkindness and immodesty. According to Mason, in Narayan&#x27;s works, the individual is not a private entity, but rather a public one and this concept is an innovation that can be called his own. In addition to his early works being among the most important English-language fiction from India, with this innovation, he provided his western readers the first works in English to be infused with an eastern and Hindu existential perspective. Mason also holds the view that Edmund Wilson&#x27;s assessment of Walt Whitman, &quot;He does not write editorials on events but describes his actual feelings&quot;, applies equally to Narayan.

==Recognition,Awards and honours==
Narayan won numerous awards during the course of his literary career. He won his first major award, in 1960, the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book &quot;The Guide&quot;. When the book was made into a film, he received the Filmfare Award for the best story. In 1964, he received the Padma Bhushan during the Republic Day honours. In 1980, he was awarded the AC Benson Medal by the (British) Royal Society of Literature, of which he was an honorary member. In 1982 he was elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature multiple times, but never won the honour. In 1986, he was honoured by Rajyotsava Prashasti from Government of Karnataka.

Recognition also came in the form of honorary doctorates conferred by the University of Leeds (1967), Delhi University (1973) and the University of Mysore (1976). Toward the end of his career, Narayan was nominated to the upper house of the Indian Parliament for a six-year term starting in 1989, for his contributions to Indian literature. A year before his death, in 2000, he was awarded India&#x27;s second-highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan.

==Legacy==

Narayan&#x27;s greatest achievement was making India accessible to the outside world through his literature. He is regarded as one of the three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers something to look forward to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar to the reader as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan&#x27;s 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of &quot;Malgudi Days&quot;.

In mid-2016, Narayan&#x27;s former home in Mysore was converted to a museum in his honour. The original structure was built in 1952. The house and surrounding land were acquired by real estate contractors to raze down and build an apartment complex in its stead, but citizens groups and the Mysore City Corporation stepped in to repurchase the building and land and then restore it, subsequently converting it to a museum. The museum admission is free of charge and it is open between 10.00 am and 5.00 pm except on Tuesdays.

On 8 November 2019, his book &quot;Swami and Friends&quot; was chosen as one of BBC&#x27;s 100 Novels That Shaped Our World.

===Adaptations===
Narayan&#x27;s book &quot;The Guide&quot; was adapted into the 1965 Hindi film &quot;Guide&quot;, directed by Vijay Anand. An English-language version was also released. Narayan was not happy with the way the film was made and its deviation from the book; he wrote a column in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, &quot;The Misguided Guide,&quot; criticising the film. The book was also adapted to a Broadway play by Harvey Breit and Patricia Rinehart, and was staged at Hudson Theatre in 1968 with Zia Mohyeddin playing the lead role and a music score by Ravi Shankar.

&quot;Mr. Sampath&quot; was made into a 1952 Hindi film of the same name with Padmini and Motilal and produced by Gemini Studios. Another novel, &quot;The Financial Expert&quot;, was made into the Kannada film &quot;Banker Margayya&quot; (1983). Swami and Friends, &quot;The Vendor of Sweets&quot; and some of Narayan&#x27;s short stories were adapted by actor-director Shankar Nag into the television series &quot;Malgudi Days&quot; that started in 1986. Narayan was happy with the adaptations and complimented the producers for sticking to the storyline in the books.

<text>Amalie Emmy Noether (, ; ; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German mathematician who made many important contributions to abstract algebra. She also proved Noether&#x27;s first and second theorems, which are fundamental in mathematical physics. Noether was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonné, Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether&#x27;s theorem explains the connection between symmetry and conservation laws.

Noether was born to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; her father was the mathematician Max Noether. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her doctorate in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert&#x27;s name. Her habilitation was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of &quot;Privatdozent&quot;.

Noether remained a leading member of the Göttingen mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the &quot;Noether Boys&quot;. In 1924, Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether&#x27;s ideas; her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, &quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;. By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany&#x27;s Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania. There, she taught graduate and post-doctoral women including Marie Johanna Weiss and Olga Taussky-Todd. At the same time, she lectured and performed research at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Noether&#x27;s mathematical work has been divided into three &quot;epochs&quot;. In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of algebraic invariants and number fields. Her work on differential invariants in the calculus of variations, Noether&#x27;s theorem, has been called &quot;one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics&quot;. In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that &quot;changed the face of [abstract] algebra&quot;. In her classic 1921 paper &quot;Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen&quot; (&quot;Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains&quot;), Noether developed the theory of ideals in commutative rings into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the ascending chain condition, and objects satisfying it are named &quot;Noetherian&quot; in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on noncommutative algebras and hypercomplex numbers and united the representation theory of groups with the theory of modules and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as algebraic topology.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===

Amalie Emmy Noether was born on 23 March 1882 in Erlangen, Bavaria. She was the first of four children of mathematician Max Noether and Ida Amalia Kaufmann, both from wealthy Jewish merchant families. Her first name was &quot;Amalie&quot;, but she began using her middle name at a young age and invariably continued to do so in her adult life and her publications.

In her youth, Noether did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was near-sighted and talked with a minor lisp during her childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children&#x27;s party, showing logical acumen at an early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.
Noether had three younger brothers. The eldest, Alfred Noether, was born in 1883 and was awarded a doctorate in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether was born in 1884, studied in Munich and made contributions to applied mathematics. He was likely executed in the Soviet Union in 1941. The youngest, Gustav Robert Noether, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928.

=== Education ===
Noether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900, she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of &quot;sehr gut&quot; (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the University of Erlangen, at which her father was a professor.

This was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing mixed-sex education would &quot;overthrow all academic order&quot;. One of just two women in a university of 986 students, Noether was allowed only to audit classes rather than participate fully, and she required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14 July 1903, she passed the graduation exam at a &quot;Realgymnasium&quot; in Nuremberg.

During the 1903–1904 winter semester, she studied at the University of Göttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer Karl Schwarzschild and mathematicians Hermann Minkowski, Otto Blumenthal, Felix Klein, and David Hilbert.
In 1903, restrictions on women&#x27;s full enrollment in Bavarian universities were rescinded. Noether returned to Erlangen and officially reentered the university in October 1904, declaring her intention to focus solely on mathematics. She was one of six women in her year (two auditors) and the only woman in her chosen school. Under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she wrote her dissertation, &quot;Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form&quot; (&quot;On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms&quot;), in 1907, graduating &quot;summa cum laude&quot; later that year. Gordan was a member of the &quot;computational&quot; school of invariant researchers, and Noether&#x27;s thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked-out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert. Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and some subsequent similar papers she produced as &quot;crap&quot;. All of her later work was in a completely different field.

=== University of Erlangen ===
From 1908 to 1915, Noether taught at Erlangen&#x27;s Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father, Max Noether, when he was too ill to lecture. She joined the Circolo Matematico di Palermo in 1908 and the Deutsche Mathematiker Vereinigung in 1909. In 1910 and 1911, she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to &quot;n&quot; variables.
Gordan retired in 1910, and Noether taught under his successors, Erhard Schmidt and Ernst Fischer, who took over from the former in 1911. According to her colleague Hermann Weyl and her biographer Auguste Dick, Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of David Hilbert. Noether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.

From 1913 to 1916, Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert&#x27;s methods to mathematical objects such as fields of rational functions and the invariants of finite groups. This phase marked Noether&#x27;s first exposure to abstract algebra, the field to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.

In Erlangen, Noether advised two doctoral students: Hans Falckenberg and Fritz Seidelmann, who defended their theses in 1911 and 1916. Despite Noether&#x27;s significant role, they were both officially under the supervision of her father. Following the completion of his doctorate, Falckenberg spent time in Braunschweig and Königsberg before becoming a professor at the University of Giessen while Seidelmann became a professor in Munich.

=== University of Göttingen ===
==== Habilitation and Noether&#x27;s theorem ====
In the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her was initially blocked by the philologists and historians among the philosophical faculty, who insisted that women should not become &quot;privatdozenten&quot;. In a joint department meeting on the matter, one faculty member protested: &quot;What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?&quot; Hilbert, who believed Noether&#x27;s qualifications were the only important issue and that the sex of the candidate was irrelevant, objected with indignation and scolded those protesting her habilitation. Although his exact words have not been preserved, his objection is often said to have included the remark that the university was &quot;not a bathhouse.&quot; According to Pavel Alexandrov&#x27;s recollection, faculty members&#x27; opposition to Noether was based not just in sexism, but also in their objections to her social-democratic political beliefs and Jewish ancestry.
Noether left for Göttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time, Noether&#x27;s father retired and her brother joined the German Army to serve in World War I. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.

During her first years teaching at Göttingen, she did not have an official position and was not paid. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert&#x27;s name, and Noether would provide &quot;assistance&quot;.

Soon after arriving at Göttingen, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the theorem now known as Noether&#x27;s theorem which shows that a conservation law is associated with any differentiable symmetry of a physical system. The paper, &quot;Invariante Variationsprobleme&quot;, was presented by a colleague, Felix Klein, on 26 July 1918 at a meeting of the Royal Society of Sciences at Göttingen. Noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of the society. American physicists Leon M. Lederman and Christopher T. Hill argue in their book &quot;Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe&quot; that Noether&#x27;s theorem is &quot;certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics, possibly on a par with the Pythagorean theorem&quot;.
When World War I ended, the German Revolution of 1918–1919 brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her &quot;habilitation&quot; (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her &quot;habilitation&quot; lecture in June 1919. Noether became a &quot;privatdozent&quot;, and she delivered that fall semester the first lectures listed under her own name. She was still not paid for her work.

Three years later, she received a letter from , the Prussian Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of &quot;nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor&quot; (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions). This was an unpaid &quot;extraordinary&quot; professorship, not the higher &quot;ordinary&quot; professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of &quot;Lehrbeauftragte für Algebra&quot; (&quot;Lecturer for Algebra&quot;) a year later.

====Work in abstract algebra====
Although Noether&#x27;s theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to abstract algebra. In his introduction to Noether&#x27;s &quot;Collected Papers&quot;, Nathan Jacobson wrote thatThe development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her – in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries.

Noether&#x27;s work in algebra began in 1920 when, in collaboration with her protégé Werner Schmeidler, she published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring.

The following year she published the paper &quot;Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen&quot;, analyzing ascending chain conditions with regards to (mathematical) ideals, in which she proved the Lasker–Noether theorem in its full generality. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work &quot;revolutionary&quot;. The publication gave rise to the term &quot;Noetherian&quot; for objects which satisfy the ascending chain condition.
In 1924, a young Dutch mathematician, Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was &quot;absolute beyond comparison&quot;. After returning to Amsterdam, he wrote &quot;Moderne Algebra&quot;, a central two-volume text in the field; its second volume, published in 1931, borrowed heavily from Noether&#x27;s work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition &quot;based in part on lectures by E. Artin and E. Noether&quot;. Beginning in 1927, Noether worked closely with Emil Artin, Richard Brauer and Helmut Hasse on noncommutative algebras.

Van der Waerden&#x27;s visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which had become a major hub of mathematical and physical research. Russian mathematicians Pavel Alexandrov and Pavel Urysohn were the first of several in 1923. Between 1926 and 1930, Alexandrov regularly lectured at the university, and he and Noether became good friends. He dubbed her &quot;der Noether&quot;, using &quot;der&quot; as an epithet rather than as the masculine German article. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was able only to help him secure a scholarship to Princeton University for the 1927–1928 academic year from the Rockefeller Foundation.

====Graduate students====

In Göttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students, though most were together with Edmund Landau and others as she was not allowed to supervise dissertations on her own. Her first was Grete Hermann, who defended her dissertation in February 1925. Although she is best remembered for her work on the foundations of quantum mechanics, her dissertation was considered an important contribution to ideal theory. Hermann later spoke reverently of her &quot;dissertation-mother&quot;.

Around the same time, Heinrich Grell and Rudolf Hölzer wrote their dissertations under Noether, though the latter died of tuberculosis shortly before his defense. Grell defended his thesis in 1926 and went on to work at the University of Jena and the University of Halle, before losing his teaching license in 1935 due to accusations of homosexual acts. He was later reinstated and became a professor at Humboldt University in 1948.

Noether then supervised Werner Weber and Jakob Levitzki, who both defended their theses in 1929. Weber, who was considered only a modest mathematician, would later take part in driving Jewish mathematicians out of Göttingen. Levitzki worked first at Yale University and then at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in then British-ruled Mandatory Palestine, making significant contributions (in particular Levitzky&#x27;s theorem and the Hopkins–Levitzki theorem) to ring theory.

Other Noether Boys included Max Deuring, Hans Fitting, Ernst Witt, Chiungtze C. Tsen and Otto Schilling. Deuring, who had been considered the most promising of Noether&#x27;s students, was awarded his doctorate in 1930. He worked in Hamburg, Marden and Göttingen and is known for his contributions to arithmetic geometry. Fitting graduated in 1931 with a thesis on abelian groups and is remembered for his work in group theory, particularly Fitting&#x27;s theorem and the Fitting lemma. He died at the age of 31 from a bone disease.

Witt was initially supervised by Noether, but her position was revoked in April 1933 and he was assigned to Gustav Herglotz instead. He received his PhD in July 1933 with a thesis on the Riemann-Roch theorem and zeta-functions, and went on to make several contributions that now bear his name. Tsen, best remembered for proving Tsen&#x27;s theorem, received his doctorate in December of the same year. He returned to China in 1935 and started teaching at National Chekiang University, but died only five years later. Schilling also began studying under Noether but was forced to find a new advisor due to Noether&#x27;s emigration. Under Helmut Hasse, he completed his PhD in 1934 at the University of Marburg. He later worked as a post doc at Trinity College, Cambridge, before moving to the United States.

Noether&#x27;s other students were Wilhelm Dörnte, who received his doctorate in 1927 with a thesis on groups, Werner Vorbeck, who did so in 1935 with a thesis on splitting fields, and Wolfgang Wichmann, who did so 1936 with a thesis on p-adic theory. There is no information about the first two, but it is known that Wichmann supported a student initiative that unsuccessfully attempted to revoke Noether&#x27;s dismissal and died as a soldier on the Eastern Front during World War II.

====Noether school====
Noether developed a close circle of mathematicians beyond just her doctoral students who shared Noether&#x27;s approach to abstract algebra and contributed to the field&#x27;s development, a group often referred to as the Noether school. An example of this is her close work with Wolfgang Krull, who greatly advanced commutative algebra with his &quot;Hauptidealsatz&quot; and his dimension theory for commutative rings. Another is Gottfried Köthe, who contributed to the development of the theory of hypercomplex quantities using Noether and Krull&#x27;s methods.

In addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her &quot;a severe critic&quot;, but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude. In Noether&#x27;s obituary, Van der Waerden described her asCompletely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.

Noether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after Nazi Germany dismissed her from teaching, she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.

====Influential lectures====
Noether&#x27;s frugal lifestyle was at first due to her being denied pay for her work. However, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, Gottfried E. Noether.

Biographers suggest that she was mostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, focusing on her studies. Olga Taussky-Todd, a distinguished algebraist taught by Noether, described a luncheon during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, &quot;gesticulated wildly&quot; as she ate and &quot;spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed&quot;. Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematical discussion she was having with other students.

Noether did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures. She spoke quickly and her lectures were considered difficult to follow by many, including Carl Ludwig Siegel and Paul Dubreil. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. &quot;Outsiders&quot; who occasionally visited Noether&#x27;s lectures usually spent only half an hour in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: &quot;The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out.&quot;

She used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring. Noether transmitted an infectious mathematical enthusiasm to her most dedicated students, who relished their lively conversations with her.

Several of her colleagues attended her lectures and she sometimes allowed others (including her students) to receive credit for her ideas, resulting in much of her work appearing in papers not under her name. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at Göttingen:
* Winter 1924–1925: &quot;Gruppentheorie und hyperkomplexe Zahlen&quot; [&quot;Group Theory and Hypercomplex Numbers&quot;]
* Winter 1927–1928: &quot;Hyperkomplexe Grössen und Darstellungstheorie&quot; [&quot;Hypercomplex Quantities and Representation Theory&quot;]
* Summer 1928: &quot;Nichtkommutative Algebra&quot; [&quot;Noncommutative Algebra&quot;]
* Summer 1929: &quot;Nichtkommutative Arithmetik&quot; [&quot;Noncommutative Arithmetic&quot;]
* Winter 1929–1930: &quot;Algebra der hyperkomplexen Grössen&quot; [&quot;Algebra of Hypercomplex Quantities&quot;]

===Moscow State University===

In the winter of 1928–1929, Noether accepted an invitation to Moscow State University, where she continued working with P. S. Alexandrov. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and algebraic geometry. She worked with the topologists Lev Pontryagin and Nikolai Chebotaryov, who later praised her contributions to the development of Galois theory.

Although politics was not central to her life, Noether took a keen interest in political matters and, according to Alexandrov, showed considerable support for the Russian Revolution. She was especially happy to see Soviet advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the Bolshevik project. This attitude caused her problems in Germany, culminating in her eviction from a pension lodging building, after student leaders complained of living with &quot;a Marxist-leaning Jewess&quot;. Hermann Weyl recalled that &quot;During the wild times after the Revolution of 1918,&quot; Noether &quot;sided more or less with the Social Democrats&quot;. She was from 1919 through 1922 a member of the Independent Social Democrats, a short-lived splinter party. In the words of logician and historian Colin McLarty, &quot;she was not a Bolshevist but was not afraid to be called one.&quot;
Noether planned to return to Moscow, an effort for which she received support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933, he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the Soviet Education Ministry. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans for a return to the Soviet Union.

===Recognition===
In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin received the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award for their contributions to mathematics. The prize included a monetary reward of and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the Göttingen &quot;Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften&quot; (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of &quot;Ordentlicher Professor&quot; (full professor).

Noether&#x27;s colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday, in 1932, in typical mathematicians&#x27; style. Helmut Hasse dedicated an article to her in the &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;, wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of noncommutative algebra are simpler than those of commutative algebra, by proving a noncommutative reciprocity law. This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, which he called the &quot;mμν-riddle of syllables&quot;. She solved it immediately, but the riddle has been lost.
In September of the same year, Noether delivered a plenary address (&quot;großer Vortrag&quot;) on &quot;Hyper-complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory&quot; at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zürich. The congress was attended by 800 people, including Noether&#x27;s colleagues Hermann Weyl, Edmund Landau, and Wolfgang Krull. There were 420 official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented. Apparently, Noether&#x27;s prominent speaking position was a recognition of the importance of her contributions to mathematics. The 1932 congress is sometimes described as the high point of her career.

===Expulsion from Göttingen by Nazi Germany===
When Adolf Hitler became the German &quot;Reichskanzler&quot; in January 1933, Nazi activity around the country increased dramatically. At the University of Göttingen, the German Student Association led the attack on the &quot;un-German spirit&quot; attributed to Jews and was aided by &quot;privatdozent&quot; and Noether&#x27;s former student Werner Weber. Antisemitic attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors. One young protester reportedly demanded: &quot;Aryan students want Aryan mathematics and not Jewish mathematics.&quot;

One of the first actions of Hitler&#x27;s administration was the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had &quot;demonstrated their loyalty to Germany&quot; by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: &quot;On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from you the right to teach at the University of Göttingen.&quot; Several of Noether&#x27;s colleagues, including Max Born and Richard Courant, also had their positions revoked.

Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. Hermann Weyl later wrote that &quot;Emmy Noetherher courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spiritwas in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace.&quot; Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss class field theory. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi paramilitary organization &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later.

===Refuge at Bryn Mawr and Princeton===

As dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their colleagues in the United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. Albert Einstein and Hermann Weyl were appointed by the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal immigration. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: Bryn Mawr College, in the United States, and Somerville College at the University of Oxford, in England. After a series of negotiations with the Rockefeller Foundation, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.

At Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended Anna Wheeler, who had studied at Göttingen just before Noether arrived there. Another source of support at the college was the Bryn Mawr president, Marion Edwards Park, who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in the area to &quot;see Dr. Noether in action!&quot;

During her time at Bryn Mawr, Noether formed a group, sometimes called the Noether girls, of four post-doctoral (Grace Shover Quinn, Marie Johanna Weiss, Olga Taussky-Todd, who all went on to have successful careers in mathematics) and doctoral students (Ruth Stauffer). They enthusiastically worked through van der Waerden&#x27;s &quot;Moderne Algebra I&quot; and parts of Erich Hecke&#x27;s &quot;Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen&quot; (&quot;Theory of algebraic numbers&quot;). Stauffer was Noether&#x27;s only doctoral student in the United States, but Noether died shortly before she graduated. She took her examination with Richard Brauer and received her degree in June 1935, with a thesis concerning separable normal extensions. After her doctorate, Stauffer worked as a teacher for a short period and as a statistician for over 30 years.

In 1934, Noether began lecturing at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton upon the invitation of Abraham Flexner and Oswald Veblen. She also worked with Abraham Albert and Harry Vandiver. However, she remarked about Princeton University that she was not welcome at &quot;the men&#x27;s university, where nothing female is admitted&quot;.

Her time in the United States was pleasant, as she was surrounded by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects. In the summer of 1934, she briefly returned to Germany to see Emil Artin and her brother Fritz. The latter, after having been forced out of his job at the Technische Hochschule Breslau, had accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia.

Although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of the universities, she was able to use the library in Göttingen as a &quot;foreign scholar&quot;. Without incident, Noether returned to the United States and her studies at Bryn Mawr.

===Death===
In April 1935, doctors discovered a tumor in Noether&#x27;s pelvis. Worried about complications from surgery, they ordered two days of bed rest first. During the operation they discovered an ovarian cyst &quot;the size of a large cantaloupe&quot;. Two smaller tumors in her uterus appeared to be benign and were not removed to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a circulatory collapse on the fourth. On 14 April, Noether fell unconscious, her temperature soared to , and she died. &quot;[I]t is not easy to say what had occurred in Dr. Noether&quot;, one of the physicians wrote. &quot;It is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection, which struck the base of the brain where the heat centers are supposed to be located.&quot; She was 53.
A few days after Noether&#x27;s death, her friends and associates at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park&#x27;s house. Hermann Weyl and Richard Brauer both traveled from Princeton and delivered eulogies. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and Pavel Alexandrov in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the M. Carey Thomas Library at Bryn Mawr.

==Contributions to mathematics and physics==
Noether&#x27;s work in abstract algebra and topology was influential in mathematics, while Noether&#x27;s theorem has widespread consequences for theoretical physics and dynamical systems. Noether showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways. Her friend and colleague Hermann Weyl described her scholarly output in three epochs:
In the first epoch (1907–1919), Noether dealt primarily with differential and algebraic invariants, beginning with her dissertation under Paul Gordan. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of David Hilbert, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, Ernst Sigismund Fischer. Shortly after moving to Göttingen in 1915, she proved the two Noether&#x27;s theorems, &quot;one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics&quot;.

In the second epoch (1920–1926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of mathematical rings. In the third epoch (1927–1935), Noether focused on noncommutative algebra, linear transformations, and commutative number fields. Although the results of Noether&#x27;s first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B. L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.

In these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of the earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing the earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditionsa simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as the topics of algebraic invariants that had been studied by her father and elimination theory, discussed below. 

===Historical context===
In the century from 1832 to Noether&#x27;s death in 1935, the field of mathematics – specifically algebra – underwent a profound revolution whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., cubic, quartic, and quintic equations, as well as on the related problem of constructing regular polygons using compass and straightedge. Beginning with Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s 1832 proof that prime numbers such as five can be factored in Gaussian integers, Évariste Galois&#x27;s introduction of permutation groups in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846, by Liouville), William Rowan Hamilton&#x27;s description of quaternions in 1843, and Arthur Cayley&#x27;s more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether&#x27;s most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, abstract algebra.

===Background on abstract algebra and &quot;begriffliche Mathematik&quot; (conceptual mathematics)===
Two of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings:
* A &quot;group&quot; consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: it must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as by multiplying a number by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.
* A &quot;ring&quot; likewise, has a set of elements, but now has &quot;two&quot; operations. The first operation must make the set a commutative group, and the second operation is associative and distributive with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be commutative; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first – the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse (an element such that ), the ring is called a &quot;division ring&quot;. A &quot;field&quot; is defined as a commutative division ring. For instance, the integers form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be added or multiplied, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is commutative, i.e., for any elements and in the ring, . The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that combined with might be different from combined with . Examples of noncommutative rings include matrices and quaternions. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; for example, there is no integer such that .

The integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into prime numbers. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the Lasker–Noether theorem, for the ideals of many rings. As detailed below, Noether&#x27;s work included determining what properties &quot;do&quot; hold for all rings, devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.

Groups are frequently studied through &quot;group representations&quot;. In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an &quot;action&quot; of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group describes the symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. Rotations are a type of symmetry of space, because the laws of physics themselves do not pick out a preferred direction. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.

A powerful way of studying rings is through their &quot;modules&quot;. A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module.

The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an &quot;algebra&quot;. An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first.

Words such as &quot;element&quot; and &quot;combining operation&quot; are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For instance, the elements might be logical propositions, where the first combining operation is exclusive or and the second is logical conjunction. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether&#x27;s gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, van der Waerden recalled that
This is the &quot;begriffliche Mathematik&quot; (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra.

===First epoch (1908–1919)===
====Algebraic invariant theory====

Much of Noether&#x27;s work in the first epoch of her career was associated with invariant theory, principally algebraic invariant theory. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a group of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid metre-stick is rotated, the coordinates of its endpoints change, but its length remains the same. A more sophisticated example of an &quot;invariant&quot; is the discriminant of a homogeneous quadratic polynomial , where and are indeterminates. The discriminant is called &quot;invariant&quot; because it is not changed by linear substitutions and with determinant . These substitutions form the special linear group .

One can ask for all polynomials in , , and that are unchanged by the action of ; these turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant. More generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients , and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.

One of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the &quot;finite basis problem&quot;. The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called &quot;generators&quot;, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of a quadratic polynomial.

Noether&#x27;s advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the &quot;king of invariant theory&quot;, and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group.

Noether followed Gordan&#x27;s lead, writing her doctoral dissertation and several other publications on invariant theory. She extended Gordan&#x27;s results and also built upon Hilbert&#x27;s research. Later, she would disparage this work, finding it of little interest and admitting to forgetting the details of it. Hermann Weyl wrote, [A] greater contrast is hardly imaginable than between her first paper, the dissertation, and her works of maturity; for the former is an extreme example of formal computations and the latter constitute an extreme and grandiose example of conceptual axiomatic thinking in mathematics.

====Galois theory====
Galois theory concerns transformations of number fields that permute the roots of an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable of degree , in which the coefficients are drawn from some ground field, which might be, for example, the field of real numbers, rational numbers, or the integers modulo 7. There may or may not be choices of , which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called roots. For example, if the polynomial is and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is extended, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree.

Continuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, and , where is the imaginary unit, that is, More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the splitting field of the polynomial.

The Galois group of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial. (These transformations are called automorphisms.) The Galois group of consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and complex conjugation, which sends to . Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a permutation of the roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the subgroups of the Galois group.

In 1918, Noether published a paper on the inverse Galois problem. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to &quot;Noether&#x27;s problem&quot;, which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup &quot;G&quot; of the permutation group acting on the field always is a pure transcendental extension of the field . (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper, where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for = 2, 3, or 4. In 1969, Richard Swan found a counter-example to Noether&#x27;s problem, with = 47 and a cyclic group of order 47 (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.

====Physics====
Noether was brought to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, in a 1918 paper. This paper presented two theorems, of which the first is known as Noether&#x27;s theorem. Together, these theorems not only solve the problem for general relativity, but also determine the conserved quantities for &quot;every&quot; system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:

For illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether&#x27;s theorem shows the angular momentum of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space conserves angular momentum despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the &quot;physical laws&quot; governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment works the same way at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether&#x27;s theorem, these symmetries account for the conservation laws of linear momentum and energy within this system, respectively.

At the time, physicists were not familiar with Sophus Lie&#x27;s theory of continuous groups, on which Noether had built. Many physicists first learned of Noether&#x27;s theorem from an article by Edward Lee Hill that presented only a special case of it. Consequently, the full scope of her result was not immediately appreciated. During the latter half of the 20th century, however, Noether&#x27;s theorem became a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether&#x27;s theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon: If the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether&#x27;s theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.

===Second epoch (1920–1926)===
====Ascending and descending chain conditions====
In this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending (&quot;Teilerkettensatz&quot;) or descending (&quot;Vielfachenkettensatz&quot;) chain conditions. A sequence of non-empty subsets , ... of a set is usually said to be &quot;ascending&quot; if each is a subset of the next:
:formula_1

Conversely, a sequence of subsets of is called &quot;descending&quot; if each contains the next subset:
:formula_2

A chain &quot;becomes constant after a finite number of steps&quot; if there is an such that formula_3 for all . A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the ascending chain condition if every ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. Chain conditions can be used to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element, or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements.

Many types of objects in abstract algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called &quot;Noetherian&quot; in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space whose open subsets satisfy the ascending chain condition; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.

The chain condition often is &quot;inherited&quot; by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are Noetherian; and, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal power series over a Noetherian ring.

Another application of such chain conditions is in Noetherian inductionalso known as well-founded inductionwhich is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of is to assume the existence of a counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the &quot;minimal counterexample&quot;. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example.

====Commutative rings, ideals, and modules====
Noether&#x27;s paper, &quot;Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen&quot; (&quot;Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains&quot;, 1921), is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a commutative ring. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on ideals, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician Claude Chevalley coined the term &quot;Noetherian ring&quot; to describe this property. A major result in Noether&#x27;s 1921 paper is the Lasker–Noether theorem, which extends Lasker&#x27;s theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, and that this decomposition is unique.

Noether&#x27;s work &quot;Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern&quot; (&quot;Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields&quot;, 1927) characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals (now called Dedekind domains). Noether showed that these rings were characterized by five conditions: they must satisfy the ascending and descending chain conditions, they must possess a unit element but no zero divisors, and they must be integrally closed in their associated field of fractions. This paper also contains what now are called the isomorphism theorems, which describe some fundamental natural isomorphisms, and some other basic results on Noetherian and Artinian modules.

====Elimination theory====
In 1923–1924, Noether applied her ideal theory to elimination theory in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the factorization of polynomials could be carried over directly. 

Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, often by the method of resultants.
For illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form
where a matrix (or linear transform) (without the variable ) times a vector (that only has non-zero powers of ) is equal to the zero vector, . Hence, the determinant of the matrix must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable has been eliminated.

====Invariant theory of finite groups====
Techniques such as Hilbert&#x27;s original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper, Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called Noether&#x27;s bound. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether&#x27;s bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is coprime to formula_4 (the factorial of the order formula_5 of the group ). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether&#x27;s bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number formula_5, but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides formula_4 but not formula_5. For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called &quot;Noether&#x27;s gap&quot;. It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.

In her 1926 paper, Noether extended Hilbert&#x27;s theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert&#x27;s work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether&#x27;s result was later extended by William Haboush to all reductive groups by his proof of the Mumford conjecture. In this paper Noether also introduced the &quot;Noether normalization lemma&quot;, showing that a finitely generated domain over a field has a set } of algebraically independent elements such that is integral over .

====Topology====

As noted by Hermann Weyl in his obituary, Noether&#x27;s contributions to topology illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their connectedness. An old joke is that &quot;a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug&quot;, since they can be continuously deformed into one another.

Noether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of algebraic topology from the earlier combinatorial topology, specifically, the idea of homology groups. According to Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by him and Heinz Hopf in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where &quot;she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle&quot; and he continues that,
Noether&#x27;s suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others, and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen. Noether observed that her idea of a Betti group makes the Euler–Poincaré formula simpler to understand, and Hopf&#x27;s own work on this subject &quot;bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether&quot;. Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication, where she cites it as an application of group theory.

This algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in Austria. In a 1926–1927 course given in Vienna, Leopold Vietoris defined a homology group, which was developed by Walther Mayer into an axiomatic definition in 1928.

===Third epoch (1927–1935)===
====Hypercomplex numbers and representation theory====
Much work on hypercomplex numbers and group representations was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these earlier results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras. This single work by Noether was said to have ushered in a new period in modern algebra and to have been of fundamental importance for its development.

Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of associative algebras and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of modules and ideals in rings satisfying ascending chain conditions.

====Noncommutative algebra====
Noether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With Emil Artin, Richard Brauer, and Helmut Hasse, she founded the theory of central simple algebras.

A paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer pertains to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their &quot;Hauptsatz&quot; (&quot;main theorem&quot;):Every finite-dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension.These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem, which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.

==Legacy==

Noether&#x27;s work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics, and she is considered one of the most important mathematicians of the twentieth century. During her lifetime and even until today, Noether has also been characterized as the greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians such as Pavel Alexandrov, Hermann Weyl, and Jean Dieudonné.

In a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Albert Einstein wrote:

In his obituary, fellow algebraist B. L. van der Waerden says that her mathematical originality was &quot;absolute beyond comparison&quot;, and Hermann Weyl said that Noether &quot;changed the face of [abstract] algebra by her work&quot;. Mathematician and historian Jeremy Gray wrote that any textbook on abstract algebra bears the evidence of Noether&#x27;s contributions: &quot;Mathematicians simply do ring theory her way.&quot; Several things now bear her name, including many mathematical objects, and an asteroid, 7001 Noether.

<doc id="149902" wikidata="Q185644" url="?curid=149902" title="Composite video">
<text>Composite video is an baseband analog video format that typically carries a 405, 525 or 625 line interlaced black and white or color signal, on a single channel, unlike the higher-quality S-Video (two channels) and the even higher-quality YPbPr (three channels).

A yellow RCA connector is typically used for composite video, with the audio being carried on separate additional L/R RCA connectors. In professional settings, or on devices that are too small for an RCA connector, such as a digital camera, other types of connectors can be used.

Composite video is also known by the acronym CVBS, for composite video baseband signal or color, video, blanking and sync, or is simply referred to as &quot;SD video&quot; for the standard-definition television signal it conveys.

There are three dominant variants of composite video signals, corresponding to the analog color system used (NTSC, PAL, and SECAM), but purely monochrome signals can also be used.

== Signal components ==

A composite video signal combines, on one wire, the video information required to recreate a color picture, as well as line and frame synchronization pulses. The color video signal is a linear combination of the &quot;luminance&quot; (Y) of the picture and a chrominance subcarrier which carries the color information (C), a combination of hue and saturation. Details of the combining process vary between the NTSC, PAL and SECAM systems.

The frequency spectrum of the modulated color signal overlaps that of the baseband signal, and separation relies on the fact that frequency components of the baseband signal tend to be near harmonics of the horizontal scanning rate, while the color carrier is selected to be an odd multiple of half the horizontal scanning rate; this produces a modulated color signal that consists mainly of harmonic frequencies that fall between the harmonics in the baseband luma signal, rather than both being in separate continuous frequency bands alongside each other in the frequency domain. The signals may be separated using a comb filter. In other words, the combination of luma and chrominance is indeed a frequency-division technique, but it is much more complex than typical frequency-division multiplexing systems like the one used to multiplex analog radio stations on both the AM and FM bands.

A gated and filtered signal derived from the color subcarrier, called the burst or colorburst, is added to the horizontal blanking interval of each line (excluding lines in the vertical sync interval) as a synchronizing signal and amplitude reference for the chrominance signals. In NTSC composite video, the burst signal is inverted in phase (180° out of phase) from the reference subcarrier. In PAL, the phase of the color subcarrier alternates on successive lines. In SECAM, no colorburst is used since phase information is irrelevant.

===Composite artifacts===

The combining of component signals to form the composite signal does the same, causing a checkerboard video artifact known as dot crawl. Dot crawl is a defect that results from crosstalk due to the intermodulation of the chrominance and luminance components of the signal. This is usually seen when chrominance is transmitted with high bandwidth, and its spectrum reaches into the band of the luminance frequencies. Comb filters are commonly used to separate signals and eliminate these artifacts from composite sources. S-Video and component video avoid this problem as they maintain the component signals physically separate.

=== Recording ===
Most home analog video equipment record a signal in (roughly) composite format: LaserDiscs and type C videotape for example store a true composite signal modulated, while consumer videotape formats (including VHS and Betamax) and commercial and industrial tape formats (including U-matic) use modified composite signals FM encoded (generally known as &quot;color-under&quot;). The professional D-2 videocassette format digitally storing a sampled signal and losslessly reproduces composite video signals using PCM encoding of the analog signal on the magnetic tape. With the advent of affordable higher sampling speed analog to digital converters, realtime composite to YUV sampled digital sampling has been possible since the 1980s and raw waveform sampling and software decoding since the 2010s.

=== Extensions ===
A number of so-called &quot;extensions&quot; to the visible TV image can be transmitted using composite video. Since TV screens hide the vertical blanking interval of a composite video signal, these take advantage of the unseen parts of the signal. Examples of extensions include teletext, closed captioning, information regarding the show title, a set of reference colors that allows TV sets to automatically correct NTSC hue maladjustments, widescreen signaling (WSS) for switching between 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, etc.

== Connectors and cable ==

In home applications, the composite video signal is typically connected using an RCA connector, normally yellow. It is often accompanied with red and white connectors for right and left audio channels respectively. BNC connectors and higher quality coaxial cable are often used in professional television studios and post-production applications. BNC connectors were also used for composite video connections on early home VCRs, often accompanied by either RCA connector or a 5-pin DIN connector for audio. The BNC connector, in turn, post dated the PL-259 connector featured on first-generation VCRs.

Video cables are 75 ohm impedance, low in capacitance. Typical values run from 52 pF/m for an HDPE-foamed dielectric precision video cable to 69 pF/m for a solid PE dielectric cable.

== Digital sampling and modern usage ==
The active image area of composite and s-video signals are digitally stored at 720x576i25 PAL and 720x480i29.7 (or 720x488) pixels. This does not represent the whole signal. Hardware typically samples at four times the color subcarrier frequency (4fsc) that includes the vertical blanking interval (VBI). Only commercial video capture devices used in broadcast output images with the extra VBI space. Direct sampling with high-speed ADCs and software time base correction has allowed projects like the open-source CVBS-Decode to create a D-2 like 4fsc stream that preserves and allows full presentation and inspection of the entire composite signal. This can then be comb-filtered or chroma-decoded to a color image on a standard computer or via DAC played back to a TV. 

Composite is no longer the only universal standard it once was for consumers after the digital era began phasing out analog CRT displays and virtually all consumer devices moved to using HDMI. Modified versions of composite such as 960H (960x576) are still in wide use for CCTV systems today in consumer use alongside fpv drones.

== Modulators ==

Some devices, such as videocassette recorders (VCRs), video game consoles, and home computers output composite video. This may then be converted to FM RF with an RF modulator that generates the proper carrier (often for channel 3 or 4 in North America, channel 36 in Europe). Sometimes this modulator is built into the product (such as video game consoles, VCRs, or the Atari, Commodore 64, or TRS-80 CoCo home-computers), is an external unit powered by the computer (TI-99/4A), or with an independent power supply.

Because of the digital television transition most television sets no longer have analog television tuners but DVB-T and ATSC digital ones. They therefore cannot accept a signal from an analog modulator. However, composite video has an established market for both devices that convert it to channel 3/4 outputs, as well as devices that convert standards like VGA to composite, therefore it has offered opportunities to repurpose older composite monitors for newer devices.

=== Demodulation loss ===
The process of modulating RF with the original video signal, and then demodulating the original signal again in the TV, introduces losses including added noise or interference. For these reasons, it is best to use composite connections instead of RF connections if possible for live signals and sample the source FM RF signal for recorded formats. Some video equipment and modern televisions have only RF input.

<text>Verden () is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the centre of Lower Saxony, Germany. Adjoining it are (from the northwest clockwise) the districts of Osterholz, Rotenburg, Heidekreis, Nienburg, and Diepholz, as well as the city of Bremen.

==Geography==
The Aller River enters the district in the east and joins the Weser in the center of the district. In the north, the Wümme River passes from west to the east across the district&#x27;s territory. The western half of the district is occupied by suburbs in the Bremen metropolitan area, e.g. the town of Achim.

==History==
The district dates back to the two &quot;Ämter&quot; of Verden and Achim, which were created in 1852 and 1859. After the Kingdom of Hanover became part of Prussia, they were recreated as districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;), and merged in 1932. In 1939, two municipalities of the district were added to Bremen, and in 1972 Thedinghausen (previously an exclave of the district of Braunschweig) was added.

==Twinnings==
*The city and rayon of Bagrationovsk (Russia)
*The city and municipality of Górowo Ilaweckie (Poland)

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms shows a horse in the top part, both as a symbol for the state of Lower Saxony, as well as the historical state of Hanover, to which the district belonged. The wavy line in the middle stands for the rivers Weser and Aller, while the three ears in the bottom symbolize the agricultural character of the district.

<doc id="149918" wikidata="Q1244704" url="?curid=149918" title="Trinity Hall, Cambridge">
<text>Trinity Hall (formally The College or Hall of the Holy Trinity in the University of Cambridge) is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Founded in 1350, it is the fifth-oldest surviving college of the university, having been established by William Bateman, Bishop of Norwich, to train clergymen in canon law after the Black Death. The college has two sister colleges at the University of Oxford: All Souls and University College.

Notable alumni include theoretical physicists Stephen Hawking and Nobel Prize winner David Thouless, Australian Prime Minister Stanley Bruce, Pakistani Prime Minister Khawaja Nazimuddin, Canadian Governor General David Johnston, philosophers Marshall McLuhan and Galen Strawson, Conservative cabinet minister Geoffrey Howe, Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, writer J. B. Priestley, and Academy Award-winning actress Rachel Weisz.

==History==
The devastation caused by the Black Death in England of the 1340s included the loss of perhaps half of the population; Bishop Bateman himself lost nearly 700 of his parish priests, and so his decision to found a college was probably centred on a need to rebuild the priesthood. The site that Bateman chose was the original site of Gonville Hall, which had been founded three years earlier, but was financially struggling. Bateman&#x27;s clerical aim for the Hall is reflected in the foundation of 1350, when he stated that the college&#x27;s aim was &quot;the promotion of divine worship and of canon and civil science and direction of the commonwealth and especially of our church and diocese of Norwich.&quot; This led the college to be particularly strong in legal studies, a tradition that has continued over the centuries.

At first all colleges in Cambridge were known as &quot;Halls&quot; or &quot;Houses&quot; and then later changed their names from &quot;Hall&quot; to &quot;College&quot;. However, when Henry VIII founded Trinity College next door, it became clear that Trinity Hall would continue being known as a Hall. The new foundation&#x27;s name may have been a punishment for the college&#x27;s master, Stephen Gardiner, who had opposed the king&#x27;s remarriage and had endured much of the college&#x27;s land being removed. It is incorrect to call it Trinity Hall College, although Trinity Hall college (lower case) is, strictly speaking, accurate. A similar situation had existed once before when Henry VI founded King&#x27;s College (in 1441) despite the existence of King&#x27;s Hall (founded in 1317). King&#x27;s Hall was later incorporated in the foundation of Trinity College in 1546.

Trinity Hall, in addition to having a chapel, also had joint usage of the Church of St John Zacharias with Clare Hall, until the church was demolished to enable the construction of King&#x27;s College in the 15th century. After this, the college was granted usage of the nearby Church of St Edward, King and Martyr on Peas Hill, a connection which remains to this day.

== Buildings ==

The College site on the Cam was originally obtained from Bateman&#x27;s purchase of a house from John de Crauden, Prior of Ely, to house the monks during their study, with Front Court being built within the college&#x27;s first few decades. The medieval structures remain unaltered, but with their façade altered to a more baroque style during the Mastership of Sir Nathaniel Lloyd in 1710-45.

=== Chapel ===

The Chapel was licensed in 1352 and was built by August 1366, when Blessed Pope Urban V granted the College permission to celebrate Holy Mass there. Its present decor stems from its 1729–30 renovation; Lloyd had pre-existing graves removed to the Ante-Chapel, and the walls decorated with wainscotting and the ceiling with past Masters&#x27; crests. The Chapel was extended east in 1864, during which the original piscina was discovered and hidden behind a secret door. The painting behind the communion table is Maso da San Friano&#x27;s &quot;Salutation&quot;, loaned from the Fitzwilliam Museum in 1957, replacing an earlier painting by Giacomo Stella.

=== Dining Hall ===

The Dining Hall was rebuilt under Lloyd along similar lines to the Chapel, with rendered walls replaced by wainscotting and medieval beams by baroque carvings. A large portrait of Lloyd dominates the wall behind high table; Lloyd supposedly made it irremovable from its wainscot surroundings, so that his representation can never be erased from the College.

=== Libraries ===

The college library was built in the late 16th century, with the permission of Elizabeth I and probably during the mastership of Thomas Preston, and is now principally used for the storage of the college&#x27;s manuscripts and rare books; it is one of the few remaining chained libraries left in the country. The new Jerwood Library overlooking the river was opened by Lord Howe of Aberavon in 1999, and stores the college&#x27;s modern book collection.

=== Other ===

The college owns properties in the centre of Cambridge, on Bateman Street and Thompson&#x27;s Lane, and on its Wychfield site next to Fitzwilliam College, where most of the college&#x27;s sporting activity takes place. Mary Hockaday was appointed Master in May 2022 and took up the post in September that year.

==Historical allegations of misconduct==

=== 2015–2020 allegations of sexual misconduct ===
In 2019 and 2020, the College experienced unwelcome publicity after the reporting of allegations of sexual misconduct scandals involving Dr William O’Reilly, the former Acting Senior Tutor, and Dr Peter Hutchinson, a former fellow.

In 2015, 10 students submitted formal complaints of verbal sexual harassment by Dr Peter Hutchinson, a college fellow. Hutchinson was asked, and agreed, to withdraw permanently from further teaching and from attending social events at which students might be present. However, due to an alleged error by the College in 2017, Hutchinson was invited to a college event, which was also open to students. His attendance was in breach of the prior agreement and resulted in an outcry among students and alumni.

Thereafter, in 2019, a formal agreement as to what events Hutchinson could attend was approved by the Governing Body. He remained an Emeritus Fellow of the College. This resulted in further protest from students and alumni as well as more widespread coverage. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot;a gross betrayal to (sic) the students&quot; and &quot;a dangerous environment for women students to study&quot;. It was reported in November 2019 that Hutchinson had resigned.

In February 2020, a &quot;Tortoise Media&quot; investigation alleged that William O’Reilly, the Acting Senior Tutor, had seriously mishandled a disciplinary process of a student he had a &quot;close relationship&quot; with, who was the subject of multiple allegations of sexual assault. &quot;Tortoise&quot; reported that O’Reilly himself had given witness testimony on behalf of the student at the disciplinary hearings into the assaults. Moreover, during this disciplinary process O&#x27;Reilly was himself the subject of a further allegation of sexual assault, which he denied. &quot;Tortoise&quot; reported that the College&#x27;s Master, Jeremy Morris, had been made aware of the allegations against O&#x27;Reilly, but had allowed him to continue teaching for a further five months and oversee the student disciplinary process until the complaints were investigated by police. &quot;Tortoise&quot; alleged that as of the date of publication, no formal investigation had been made into this complaint, and no safeguarding measures had been put in place.

In February 2020, Morris and O’Reilly agreed to &quot;step back&quot; from their roles in college pending investigation. In March 2020, the Governing Body authorised an immediate independent external inquiry into the College’s handling of all allegations raised and matters referred to in the &quot;Tortoise&quot; article, to be led by Gemma White QC. The inquiry recommended Trinity Hall consider disciplinary action against Morris in relation to his handling of one allegation. Morris resigned as Master in August 2021.

In September 2022 the College published White&#x27;s report alongside a response document that indicated the actions it had taken to make improvements to the structures and culture of the institution.

=== 2018–2023 allegations of plagiarism ===
In June 2023, allegations of plagiarism by O&#x27;Reilly publicly emerged, having been first reported to the university in 2021. Documents shown to the &quot;Financial Times&quot; showed how nearly half of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s published article &#x27;Fredrick Jackson Turner’s Frontier Thesis, Orientalism, and the Austrian Militärgrenze&#x27; in a 2018 volume of the &quot;Journal of Austrian-American History&quot; had been plagiarised from the work of a third-year undergraduate. O&#x27;Reilly had been responsible for marking the student&#x27;s work and had commented that it &quot;coined an original narrative.&quot; After a two-year investigation by the University, the plagiarism was found by a tribunal to be “the product of negligent acts but was not deliberate”. O&#x27;Reilly remained in post but Penn State University Press, the journal&#x27;s publisher, retracted the paper concerned saying that it presented &quot;material without credit.&quot; O&#x27;Reilly did not contest or dispute the retraction.

== Student life ==
=== Combination Rooms ===
Trinity Hall has active Junior, Middle and Senior Combination Rooms for undergraduate, postgraduate and senior members of the college community respectively. The Middle Combination Room is located in Front Court, while the Junior Combination Room is adjacent to the college bar in North Court. Both the MCR and JCR have highly active committees and organize popular socials for their members across the term.

=== Societies ===

==== Trinity Hall Boat Club ====
Trinity Hall&#x27;s oldest and largest society, the Boat Club was founded in 1827, and has had a long and distinguished history; notably from 1890 until 1898, when the college stayed Head of the Mays for 33 consecutive days of rowing, which remains to this day the longest continuous defence by a single club of the bumps headship. The college won all but one of the events in the 1887 Henley Royal Regatta, making it the most successful Cambridge college in Henley&#x27;s history. The current boathouse, built in 1905 in memory of Henry Latham, is on the River Cam, a short walk from the college.

==== Trinity Hall Christian Union ====

Trinity Hall&#x27;s Christian Union was founded in 1877, making it the second oldest JCR-listed society. It is part of the broader Cambridge Inter-Collegiate Christian Union.

==== Hesperides ====

Trinity Hall&#x27;s literary society, the Hesperides, was founded in 1923 by Neil McLeod Innes with the intention of discussing literary and artistic subjects. Named after the seminal work of the 17th-century poet Robert Herrick, in its early years the society hosted T. S. Eliot, J. B. Priestley and Nikolaus Pevsner at its various dinners and functions. Old Hesperideans have gone on to some notoriety, none more so than Donald Maclean, a spy and member of the Cambridge Five. The Hesperides disbanded in 1976, but was re-founded in 2020 to encourage literary activity after the COVID-19 pandemic; speakers have included Trinity Hall alumni Nicholas Hytner and Sophie Winkleman.

<text>A toy or plaything is an object that is used primarily to provide entertainment. Simple examples include toy blocks, board games, and dolls. Toys are often designed for use by children, although many are designed specifically for adults and pets. Toys can provide utilitarian benefits, including physical exercise, cultural awareness, or academic education. Additionally, utilitarian objects, especially those which are no longer needed for their original purpose, can be used as toys. Examples include children building a fort with empty cereal boxes and tissue paper spools, or a toddler playing with a broken TV remote. The term &quot;toy&quot; can also be used to refer to utilitarian objects purchased for enjoyment rather than need, or for expensive necessities for which a large fraction of the cost represents its ability to provide enjoyment to the owner, such as luxury cars, high-end motorcycles, gaming computers, and flagship smartphones.

Playing with toys can be an enjoyable way of training young children for life experiences. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment and smart toys. Some toys are produced primarily as collectors&#x27; items and are intended for display only.

The origin of toys is prehistoric; dolls representing infants, animals, and soldiers, as well as representations of tools used by adults, are readily found at archaeological sites. The origin of the word &quot;toy&quot; is unknown, but it is believed that it was first used in the 14th century. Toys are mainly made for children. The oldest known doll toy is thought to be 4,000 years old.

Playing with toys is an important part of aging. Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help with cognition, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, become stronger physically, and practice skills needed in adulthood. Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.

A toymaker is the name of someone who makes toys.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===
Toys and games have been retrieved from the sites of ancient civilizations, and have been mentioned in ancient literature. Toys excavated from the Indus valley civilization (3010–1500 BCE) include small carts, whistles shaped like birds, and toy monkeys that could slide down a string. One of the earliest examples of children&#x27;s toys is a set of three stone balls found in the tomb of a four-year-old girl at Xi&#x27;an Banpo Neolithic site.

The earliest toys were made from natural materials, such as rocks, sticks, and clay. Thousands of years ago, Egyptian children played with dolls that had wigs and movable limbs, which were made from stone, pottery, and wood. However, evidence of toys in ancient Egypt is exceptionally difficult to identify with certainty in the archaeological record. Small figurines and models found in tombs are usually interpreted as ritual objects; those from settlement sites are more easily labelled as toys. These include spinning tops, balls of spring, and wooden models of animals with movable parts.

In ancient Greece and ancient Rome, children played with dolls made of wax or terracotta: sticks, bows and arrows, and yo-yos. When Greek children, especially girls, came of age, it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of their childhood to the gods. On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood.

The oldest known mechanical puzzle also comes from ancient Greece and appeared in the 3rd century BCE. The game consisted of a square divided into 14 parts, and the aim was to create different shapes from the pieces. In Iran, &quot;puzzle-locks&quot; were made as early as the 17th century (CE).

===Enlightenment Era===
Toys became more widespread with changing Western attitudes towards children and childhood brought about by the Enlightenment. Previously, children had often been thought of as small adults, who were expected to work in order to produce the goods that the family needed to survive. As children&#x27;s culture scholar Stephen Kline has argued, Medieval children were &quot;more fully integrated into the daily flux of making and consuming, of getting along. They had no autonomy, separate statuses, privileges, special rights or forms of social comportment that were entirely their own.&quot;
As these ideas began changing during the Enlightenment Era, blowing bubbles from leftover washing up soap became a popular pastime, as shown in the painting &quot;The Soap Bubble&quot; (1739) by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, and other popular toys included hoops, toy wagons, kites, spinning wheels and puppets. Many board games were produced by John Jefferys in the 1750s, including &quot;A Journey Through Europe&quot;. The game was very similar to modern board games; players moved along a track with the throw of a die (a teetotum was actually used) and landing on different spaces would either help or hinder the player.

In the nineteenth century, Western values prioritized toys with an educational purpose, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religion-themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah&#x27;s Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time on their hands, which led to the application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.

More complex mechanical and optical-based toys were also invented during the nineteenth century. Carpenter and Westley began to mass-produce the kaleidoscope, invented by Sir David Brewster in 1817, and had sold over 200,000 items within three months in London and Paris. The company was also able to mass-produce magic lanterns for use in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, by developing a method of mass production using a copper plate printing process. Popular imagery on the lanterns included royalty, flora and fauna, and geographical/man-made structures from around the world. The modern zoetrope was invented in 1833 by British mathematician William George Horner and was popularized in the 1860s. Wood and porcelain dolls in miniature doll houses were popular with middle-class girls, while boys played with marbles and toy trains.

===Industrial Era and mass-marketed toys===
The golden age of toy development occurred during the Industrial Era. Real wages were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of precision engineering and mass production were able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. Franz Kolb, a German pharmacist, invented plasticine in 1880, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children&#x27;s toy began. Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.

Meccano was a model construction system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. Dinky Toys pioneered the manufacture of die-cast toys with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The Britains company revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with the invention of the process of hollow casting in lead in 1893 – the company&#x27;s products remained the industry standard for many years.

Puzzles became popular as well. In 1893, the English lawyer , writing under the pseudonym of Professor Hoffman, wrote a book called &quot;Puzzles Old and New&quot;. It contained, among other things, more than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book grew into a reference work for puzzle games and was very popular at the time. The Tangram puzzle, originally from China, spread to Europe and America in the 19th century.

In 1903, a year after publishing &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, English author Beatrix Potter created the first Peter Rabbit soft toy and registered him at the Patent Office in London, making Peter the oldest licensed character. It was followed by other &quot;spin-off&quot; merchandise over the years, including painting books and board games. The &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine stated, &quot;Potter was also an entrepreneur and a pioneer in licensing and merchandising literary characters. Potter built a retail empire out of her &quot;bunny book&quot; that is worth $500 million today. In the process, she created a system that continues to benefit all licensed characters, from Mickey Mouse to Harry Potter.&quot;

In tandem with the development of mass-produced toys, Enlightenment ideals about children&#x27;s rights to education and leisure time came to fruition. During the late 18th and early 19th century, many families needed to send their children to work in factories and other sites to make ends meet—just as their predecessors had required their labor producing household goods in the medieval era. Business owners&#x27; exploitation and abuse of child laborers during this period differed from how children had been treated as workers within a family unit, though. Thanks to advocacy including photographic documentation of children&#x27;s exploitation and abuse by business owners, Western nations enacted a series of child labor laws, putting an end to child labor in nations such as the U.S. (1949). This fully entrenched, through law, the Western idea that childhood is a time for &quot;leisure&quot;, not work—and with leisure time comes more space for consumer goods such as toys.

During the Second World War, some new types of toys were created through accidental innovation. After trying to create a replacement for synthetic rubber, the American Earl L. Warrick inadvertently invented &quot;nutty putty&quot; during World War II. Later, Peter Hodgson recognized the potential as a childhood plaything and packaged it as Silly Putty. Similarly, Play-Doh was originally created as a wallpaper cleaner. In 1943 Richard James was experimenting with springs as part of his military research when he saw one come loose and fall to the floor. He was intrigued by the way it flopped around on the floor. He spent two years fine-tuning the design to find the best gauge of steel and coil; the result was the Slinky, which went on to sell in stores throughout the United States.

After the Second World War, as society became ever more affluent and new technology and materials (plastics) for toy manufacture became available, toys became cheap and ubiquitous in households across the Western World. At this point, name-brand toys became widespread in the U.S.–a new phenomenon that helped market mass-produce toys to audiences of children growing up with ample leisure time and during a period of relative prosperity.

Among the more well-known products of the 1950s there was the Danish company Lego&#x27;s line of colourful interlocking plastic brick construction sets (based on Hilary Page&#x27;s Kiddicraft Self-Locking Bricks, described by London&#x27;s V&amp;A Museum of Childhood as among the &quot;must-have toys&quot; of the 1940s), Mr. Potato Head, the Barbie doll (inspired by the Bild Lilli doll from Germany), and Action Man. The Rubik&#x27;s Cube became an enormous seller in the 1980s. In modern times, there are computerized dolls that can recognize and identify objects, the voice of their owner, and choose among hundreds of pre-programmed phrases with which to respond.

==Culture==
The act of children&#x27;s play with toys embodies the values set forth by the adults of their specific community, but through the lens of the child&#x27;s perspective. Within cultural societies, toys are a medium to enhance a child&#x27;s cognitive, social, and linguistic learning.

In some cultures, toys are used as a way to enhance a child&#x27;s skillset within the traditional boundaries of their future roles in the community. In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how they view the adult world.

However, in other cultures, toys are used to expand the development of a child&#x27;s cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth for their child. In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children&#x27;s play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to delve into the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.

In addition, children from differing communities may treat their toys in different ways based on their cultural practices. Children in more affluent communities may tend to be possessive of their toys, while children from poorer communities may be more willing to share and interact more with other children. The importance the child places on possession is dictated by the values in place within the community that the children observe on a daily basis.

==Child development==
Toys, like play itself, serve multiple purposes in both humans and animals. They provide entertainment while fulfilling an educational role. Toys enhance cognitive behavior and stimulate creativity. They aid in the development of physical and mental skills which are necessary in later life.

Wooden blocks, though simple, are regarded by early childhood education experts such as Sally Cartwright (1974) as an excellent toy for young children; she praised the fact that they are relatively easy to engage with, can be used in repeatable and predictable ways, and are versatile and open-ended, allowing for a wide variety of developmentally appropriate play. Andrew Witkin, director of marketing for Mega Brands, told &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot; that &quot;They help develop hand-eye coordination, math and science skills and also let kids be creative.&quot; Other toys like marbles, jackstones, and balls serve similar functions in child development, allowing children to use their minds and bodies to learn about spatial relationships, cause and effect, and a wide range of other skills.
One example of the dramatic ways that toys can influence child development involves clay sculpting toys such as Play-Doh and Silly Putty and their home-made counterparts. Mary Ucci, Educational Director of the Child Study Center of Wellesley College, has demonstrated how such toys positively impact the physical development, cognitive development, emotional development, and social development of children.

Toys for infants often make use of distinctive sounds, bright colors, and unique textures. Through repetition of play with toys, infants begin to recognize shapes and colors. Play-Doh, Silly Putty and other hands-on materials allow the child to make toys of their own.

Educational toys for school age children of often contain a puzzle, problem-solving technique, or mathematical proposition. Often toys designed for older audiences, such as teenagers or adults, demonstrate advanced concepts. Newton&#x27;s cradle, a desk toy designed by Simon Prebble, demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy.

Not all toys are appropriate for all ages of children. Even some toys which are marketed for a specific age range can even harm the development of children in that range, such as when for example toys meant for young girls contribute to the ongoing problem of girls&#x27; sexualization in Western culture.

A study suggested that supplying fewer toys in the environment allows toddlers to better focus to explore and play more creatively. The provision of four rather than sixteen toys is thus suggested to promote children&#x27;s development and healthy play.

===Age compression===
Age compression is the modern trend of children moving through play stages faster than was the case in the past. Children have a desire to progress to more complex toys at a faster pace, girls in particular. Barbie dolls, for example, were once marketed to girls around 8 years old but have been found to be more popular in recent years with girls around 3 years old, with most girls outgrowing the brand by about age 7. The packaging for the dolls labels them appropriate for ages 3 and up. Boys, in contrast, apparently enjoy toys and games over a longer timespan, gravitating towards toys that meet their interest in assembling and disassembling mechanical toys, and toys that &quot;move fast and things that fight&quot;. An industry executive points out that girls have entered the &quot;tween&quot; phase by the time they are 8 years old and want non-traditional toys, whereas boys have been maintaining an interest in traditional toys until they are 12 years old, meaning the traditional toy industry holds onto their boy customers for 50% longer than their girl customers.

Girls gravitate towards &quot;music, clothes, make-up, television talent shows and celebrities&quot;. As young children are more exposed to and drawn to music intended for older children and teens, companies are having to rethink how they develop and market their products. Girls also demonstrate a longer loyalty to characters in toys and games marketed towards them. A variety of global toy companies have marketed themselves to this aspect of girls&#x27; development, for example, the Hello Kitty brand and the Disney Princess franchise. Boys have shown an interest in computer games at an ever-younger age in recent years.

==Gender==

Certain toys, such as Barbie dolls and toy soldiers, are often perceived as being more acceptable for one gender than the other. The turning point for the addition of gender to toys came about in the 1960s and 1970s. Before 1975, only about two percent of toys were labeled by gender, whereas today on the Disney store&#x27;s website, considered a dominating global force for toys by researcher Claire Miller, all toys are labeled by gender. The journal &quot;Sex Roles&quot; began publishing research on this topic in 1975, focusing on the effects of gender in youth. Too, many psychological textbooks began to address this new issue. Along with these publications, researchers also started to challenge the ideas of male and female as being opposites, even going as far as to claim toys which have characteristics of both genders are preferable.

A milestone for research on gender is the use of meta-analysis, which provides a way to assess patterns in a systematic way, especially relevant for a topic such as gender, which can be difficult to quantify. Nature and nurture have historically been analyzed when looking at gender in play, as well as reinforcement by peers and parents of typical gender roles and consequently, gender play. Toy companies have often promoted the segregation by gender in toys because it enables them to customize the same toy for each gender, which ultimately doubles their revenue. For example, Legos added more colors to certain sets of toys in the 1990s, including colors commonly attributed to girls such as lavender.

It has been noted by researchers that, &quot;Children as young as 18 months display sex-stereotyped toy choices&quot;. When eye movement is tracked in young infants, infant girls show a visual preference for a doll over a toy truck (d &gt; 1.0). Boys showed no preference for the truck over the doll. However, they did fixate on the truck more than the girls (d = .78). This small study suggests that even before any self-awareness of gender identity has emerged, children already prefer sex-typical toys. These differences in toy choice are well established within the child by the age of three.

Another study done by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 different children ages three to four and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed to play with the toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed for the results to be more authentic compared to research done in a lab. The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders in order to create a better balance.

While some parents promote gender neutral play, many parents encourage their children to participate in sex-typed activities, including doll-playing and engaging in housekeeping activities for girls and playing with trucks and engaging in sports activities for boys. Researcher Susan Witt said that parents are the primary influencer on the gender roles of their children. Parents, siblings, peers, and even teachers have been shown to react more positively to children engaging in sex-typical behavior and playing with sex-typical toys. This is often done through encouragement or discouragement, as well as suggestions and imitation. Additionally, sons are more likely to be reinforced for sex-typical play and discouraged from atypical play. However, it is generally not as looked down upon for girls to play with toys designed &quot;for boys&quot;, an activity which has also become more common in recent years. Fathers are also more likely to reinforce typical play and discourage atypical play than mothers are. A study done by researcher Susan Witt suggests that stereotypes are oftentimes only strengthened by the environment, which perpetuates them to linger in older life.

This stereotypical attribution of sex-typical toys for girls and boys is gradually changing, with toys companies creating more gender neutral toys, as the benefits associated with allowing children to play with toys that appeal to them far outweighs controlling their individual preferences. For example, many stores are beginning to change their gender labels on children&#x27;s play items. Target removed all identification related to gender from their toy aisles and Disney did the same for their costumes. The Disney store is an especially prevalent example of gender in play because they are a global identity in the toy world. A study done regarding their website found that though they have removed gender labels from their costumes, the toys online reflect more stereotypical gender identities. For example, toys depicting males were associated with physicality and females were associated with beauty, housing, and caring. Though Disney promotes their toys as being for both genders, there is no gender neutral section on their website. Those which are generally deemed for both genders more closely resemble what many would label &quot;boy toys,&quot; as they relate closer to the stereotype of masculinity within play.

Traditions within various cultures promote the passing down of certain toys to their children based on the child&#x27;s gender. In Indigenous South American communities, boys receive a toy bow and arrow from their father while young girls receive a toy basket from their mother. In North African and Saharan cultural communities, gender plays a role in the creation of self-made dolls. While female dolls are used to represent brides, mothers, and wives, male dolls are used to represent horsemen and warriors. This contrast stems from the various roles of men and women within the Saharan and North African communities. There are differences in the toys that are intended for girls and boys within various cultures, which is reflective of the differing roles of men and women within a specific cultural community.

Research on the repercussions of gender in toys suggests that desegregation of the genders can be achieved by encouraging more gender-neutral play. Researchers Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach have argued that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.

==Economics==

With toys comprising such a large and important part of human existence, the toy industry has a substantial economic impact. Sales of toys often increase around holidays where gift-giving is a tradition. Some of these holidays include Christmas, Easter, Saint Nicholas Day, and Three Kings Day.

In 2005, toy sales in the United States totaled about $22.9 billion. Money spent on children between the ages of 8 and twelve alone totals approximately $221 million annually in the U.S. It was estimated that in 2011, 88% of toy sales was in the age group 0–11 years.
Toy companies change and adapt their toys to meet the changing demands of children thereby gaining a larger share of the substantial market. In recent years many toys have become more complicated with flashing lights and sounds in an effort to appeal to children raised around television and the internet. According to Mattel&#x27;s president, Neil Friedman, &quot;Innovation is key in the toy industry and to succeed one must create a &#x27;wow&#x27; moment for kids by designing toys that have fun, innovative features and include new technologies and engaging content.&quot;

In an effort to reduce costs, many mass-producers of toys locate their factories in areas where wages are lower. China manufactures about 70 percent of the world&#x27;s toys and is home to more than 8,000 toy firms, most of which are located in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province. 75% of all toys sold in the U.S., for example, are manufactured in China. Issues and events such as power outages, supply of raw materials, supply of labor, and raising wages that impact areas where factories are located often have an enormous impact on the toy industry in importing countries.

Many traditional toy makers have been losing sales to video game makers for years. Because of this, some traditional toy makers have entered the field of electronic games and have even been turning audio games into toys, and are enhancing the brands that they have by introducing interactive extensions or internet connectivity to their current toys.

In addition, the rise of distributed manufacturing enables consumers to make their own toys from open source designs with a 3-D printer. As of 2017 consumers were already offsetting millions of dollars per year by 3D printing their own toys from MyMiniFactory, a single repository.

==Types==
===Construction sets===
The Greek philosopher Plato wrote that the future architect should play at building houses as a child. A construction set is a collection of separate pieces that can be joined to create models. Popular models include cars, spaceships, and houses. The things that are built are sometimes used as toys once completed, but generally speaking, the object is to build things of one&#x27;s own design, and old models often are broken up with the pieces reused in new models.

The oldest and perhaps most common construction toy is a set of simple wooden blocks, which are often painted in bright colors and given to babies and toddlers. Construction sets such as Lego bricks and Lincoln Logs are designed for slightly older children and have been quite popular in the last century.
Construction sets appeal to children (and adults) who like to work with their hands, puzzle solvers, and imaginative sorts.

Some other examples include Bayko, Konstruk-Tubes, K&#x27;Nex, Erector Sets, Tinkertoys, and Meccano, and generic construction toys such as Neodymium magnet toys.

===Dolls and miniatures===

A doll is a model of a human (often a baby), a humanoid (like Bert and Ernie), or an animal. Modern dolls are often made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, used in the manufacture of dolls include cornhusks, bone, stone, wood, porcelain (sometimes called china), bisque, celluloid, wax, and even apples. Often, people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.

Sometimes intended as decorations, keepsakes, or collectibles for older children and adults, most dolls are intended as toys for children, usually girls, to play with. Dolls have been found in Egyptian tombs that date to as early as 2000 BCE.

Dolls are usually miniatures, but baby dolls may be of true size and weight. A doll or stuffed animal of soft material is sometimes called a plush toy or plushie. A popular toy of this type is the Teddy Bear.

A distinction is often made between dolls and action figures, which are generally of plastic or semi-metallic construction and poseable to some extent, and often are merchandising from television shows or films which feature the characters. Modern action figures, such as Action Man, are often marketed towards boys, whereas dolls are often marketed towards girls.

Toy soldiers, perhaps a precursor to modern action figures, have been a popular toy for centuries. They allow children to act out battles, often with toy military equipment and a castle or fort. Miniature animal figures are also widespread, with children perhaps acting out farm activities with animals and equipment centered on a toy farm.

===Vehicles===

Children have played with miniature versions of vehicles since ancient times, with toy two-wheeled carts being depicted on ancient Greek vases. Wind-up toys have also played a part in the advancement of toy vehicles. Modern equivalents include toy cars such as those produced by Matchbox or Hot Wheels, miniature aircraft, toy boats, military vehicles, and trains. Examples of the latter range from wooden sets for younger children such as BRIO to more complicated realistic train models like those produced by Lionel, Doepke and Hornby. Larger die-cast vehicles, 1:18 scale, have become popular toys; these vehicles are produced with a great attention to detail.

===Puzzles===
A puzzle is a problem or enigma that challenges ingenuity. Solutions to puzzles may require recognizing patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based on the process of inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good deduction skills. A popular puzzle toy is the Rubik&#x27;s Cube, invented by Hungarian Ernő Rubik in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.

There are many different types of puzzles; for example, a maze is a type of tour puzzle. Other categories include: construction puzzles, stick puzzles, tiling puzzles, disentanglement puzzles, sliding puzzles, logic puzzles, picture puzzles, lock puzzles, and mechanical puzzles.

===Collectibles===

Some toys, such as Beanie Babies, attract large numbers of enthusiasts, eventually becoming collectibles. Other toys, such as Boyds Bears are marketed to adults as collectibles. Some people spend large sums of money in an effort to acquire larger and more complete collections. The record for a single Pez dispenser at an auction, for example, is US$1100.

===Promotional merchandise===
Many successful films, television programs, books and sport teams have official merchandise, which often includes related toys. Some notable examples are &quot;Star Wars&quot; (a space fantasy franchise) and Arsenal, an English football club.

Likewise, many successful children&#x27;s films, television series, books or franchises extend their marketing campaign to fast food chains by including small toys of fictional characters or the series&#x27; associated symbols in a sealed plastic bag within their kids&#x27; meals. One famous example is the Happy Meal from McDonald&#x27;s.

Promotional toys can fall into any of the other toy categories; for example, they can be dolls or action figures based on the characters of movies or professional athletes, or they can be balls, yo-yos, or lunch boxes with logos on them. Sometimes they are given away for free as a form of advertising. Model aircraft are often toys that are used by airlines to promote their brand, just as toy cars and trucks and model trains are used by trucking, railroad and other companies as well. Many food manufacturers run promotions where a toy is included with the main product as a prize. Toys are also used as premiums, where consumers redeem proofs of purchase from a product and pay shipping and handling fees to get the toy. Some people go to great lengths to collect these sorts of promotional toys.

===Digital toys===

Digital toys are toys that incorporate some form of interactive digital technology. Examples of digital toys include virtual pets and handheld electronic games. Among the earliest digital toys are Mattel Auto Race and the Little Professor, both released in 1976. The concept of using technology in a way that bridges the digital with the physical world, providing unique interactive experiences for the user, has also been referred to as &quot;phygital&quot;.

===Physical activity===

A large amount of toys are part of active play. These include traditional toys such as hoops, tops, jump ropes, and balls, as well as more modern toys like Frisbees, foot bags, fidget toys, astrojax, and Myachi.

Playing with these sorts of toys allows children to exercise, building strong bones and muscles and aiding in physical fitness. Throwing and catching balls and Frisbees can improve hand–eye coordination. Jumping rope, (also known as skipping) and playing with foot bags can improve balance.

==Safety regulations==

Many countries have passed safety standards limiting the types of toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as choking or fire hazards that could cause injury. Children, especially very young ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials used to make a toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Young children cannot judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not always think of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.

Every country has its own regulations on toy safety, but since the globalization and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common danger for younger children is to put toys in their mouths. This is why chemicals contained in paint and other components of children&#x27;s products are carefully regulated. Countries or trade zones such as the European Union regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban chemicals from toys and juvenile products. The globalization of toys has had negative effects on locally produced toys in various countries, pushing out traditional ways of play and presenting new risks to children in areas where parental literacy levels make it hard for parents to understand the risks and age-appropriateness of various imported toys.

There have also been issues of toy safety regarding lead paint. Some toy factories, when projects become too large for them to handle, outsource production to other less known factories, often in other countries. Recently, there were some in China that America had to send back. The subcontractors may not be watched as closely and sometimes use improper manufacturing methods. The U.S. government, along with mass market stores, is now moving towards requiring companies to submit their products to testing before they end up on shelves.

==Disposal==

When toys have been outgrown or are no longer wanted, they may be donated to charity, sold at garage sales, auctioned, or even donated to museums. However, when toys are broken, worn out or otherwise unfit for use, care should be taken when disposing of them. Donated or resold toys should be gently used, clean and have all parts. Before disposal of any battery-operated toy, batteries are removed and recycled; some communities demand this be done. Some manufacturers, such as Little Tikes, will take back and recycle their products.

In 2007, massive recalls of toys produced in China led many U.S.-based charities to cut back on, or even discontinue, their acceptance of used toys. Goodwill stopped accepting donations of any toys except for stuffed animals, and other charities checked all toys against government-issued checklists.

The WEEE directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), which aims at increasing re-using, reducing, and recycling electronic waste, applies to toys in the United Kingdom as of 2 January 2007.

==Toy use in animals==
It is not unusual for some animals to play with toys. An example of this is a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young chimpanzees use sticks as dolls–the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees. They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.

<text>Rotenburg an der Wümme (also known as &quot;Rotenburg (Wümme)&quot;; &quot;Rotenburg in Hannover&quot; until May 1969; Northern Low Saxon: &quot;Rodenborg&quot;) is a town in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is the capital of the district of Rotenburg.

==Geography==
Rotenburg is situated on the Wümme river, which lies between the rivers Elbe and Weser at about the same latitude as Hamburg and Bremen, the latter lying 40 km to the west. It is often called &quot;Rotenburg (Wümme)&quot; in order to distinguish it from Rotenburg an der Fulda in Hesse and Rothenburg ob der Tauber in Bavaria.

==History==
The town was founded in 1195, when Prince-Bishop Rudolf I of Verden built a castle in the area. The town then belonged to the Prince-Bishopric of Verden which was established in 1180. The castle took its name from the colour of the bricks (&quot;rot&quot; means &quot;red&quot;, &quot;Burg&quot; &quot;castle&quot;). The adjoining settlement remained a tiny village until the 19th century.

In 1648 the Prince-Bishopric was transformed into the Principality of Verden, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish Crown, interrupted by Danish occupation from 1712 to 1715. From then on it was ruled by the Hanoverian Crown.

=== Swedish period ===
After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the rule of the Bishops of Verden ended and Rotenburg became part of the secularised Duchy of Verden under Swedish rule. In this period its new rulers built the castle with the remnants of the &quot;Schloss&quot; into a modern fortress as an outpost to protect the main fortress at Stade. This rebuilding work required the western part of the town to be demolished, making it necessary to move the main area of settlement to the east. Even the parish church had to be taken down and moved to the site of the present town church.

In the Swedish-Brandenburg War from 1675 to 1676 the town was captured during a military campaign by an alliance of Denmark and several states of the Holy Roman Empire, and it remained in Allied hands until the end of the war in 1679.
In the wake of the Treaty of Saint Germain in 1679 Rotenburg was returned to Sweden.

The fortress remained in operation until roughly 1680. After that it was neglected, the building being torn down and only the fortifications being modernised in places. After 1843 the last ramparts were levelled. In its place today is the terrain of the old local history museum. In the period between 1626 and 1835 there were seven town fires, which destroyed a significant part of the town&#x27;s infrastructure. Swedish rule lasted until the town was captured by Denmark in 1712.

=== Later history ===

The Kingdom of Hanover incorporated the principality in a real union; the princely territory, including Rotenburg upon Wümme, became part of the new Stade Region, established in 1823. In 1866, Prussia annexed the territory from Hannover. As a result, Rotenburg was renamed &quot;Rotenburg in Hannover&quot;. In May 1969, the town and district authorities changed the name to &quot;Rotenburg an der Wümme&quot;. In 2006, during the World Cup, Rotenburg hosted the national team from Trinidad and Tobago.

==Mayor==
The mayor of Rotenburg (Wümme) is Andreas Weber (SPD). He was elected in 2014 with 59.6% of the vote.

<text>Heidekreis (&quot;Heath district&quot;) is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Harburg, Lüneburg, Uelzen, Celle, Hanover, Nienburg, Verden and Rotenburg.

==History==
Historically the region belonged to the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg and its successor states. The district was established in 1977 by merging the former districts of Soltau and Fallingbostel as Soltau-Fallingbostel (). On 1 August 2011 it was renamed to Heidekreis.

==Geography==
The district includes the western half of the Lüneburg Heath (&quot;Lüneburger Heide&quot;). Since this landscape is so characteristic for the district, it calls itself &quot;the Heath District&quot;. The capital is Bad Fallingbostel, although it has only 11,800 inhabitants and is only the fifth-largest town in the district.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* in the upper half the heraldic lion of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg
* in the lower half a megalithic grave

==Towns and municipalities==


== Culture and places of interest ==
Cultural matters are looked after by those charged with communal cultural support within the towns and municipalities, the parishes, the banks, the Lüneburg Regional Association and private cultural initiatives.

=== Museums and collections ===

* Walsrode: Capitol-Theater

=== Lüneburg Regional Association ===
The district is a member of the Lüneburg Regional Association (&quot;Lüneburgischer Landschaftsverband&quot;), which looks after regional, cultural-political tasks.

=== Nature reserves ===
There are 29 nature reserves in the Heidekreis. The largest one (Lüneburg Heath Nature Reserve) has an area of 13,222 ha in the territory of the Heidekreis, the smallest (Söhlbruch) has an area of 8 ha.
=== Jewish cemeteries ===
There are four Jewish cemeteries in Soltau-Fallingbostel : in Ahlden, Rethem, Soltau und Walsrode. There are protected cultural monuments – stone witnesses to former Jewish communities and a thriving Jewish parish live into the 1930s. The cemeteries are mainly on the edge of parishes.

<doc id="149926" wikidata="Q3064117" url="?curid=149926" title="Face (geometry)">
<text>In solid geometry, a face is a flat surface (a planar region) that forms part of the boundary of a solid object. For example, a cube has six faces in this sense.

In more modern treatments of the geometry of polyhedra and higher-dimensional polytopes, a &quot;face&quot; is defined in such a way that it may have any dimension. The vertices, edges, and (2-dimensional) faces of a polyhedron are all faces in this more general sense.

==Polygonal face==
In elementary geometry, a face is a polygon on the boundary of a polyhedron. (Here a &quot;polygon&quot; should be viewed as including the 2-dimensional region inside it.) Other names for a polygonal face include polyhedron side and Euclidean plane &quot;tile&quot;.

For example, any of the six squares that bound a cube is a face of the cube. Sometimes &quot;face&quot; is also used to refer to the 2-dimensional features of a 4-polytope. With this meaning, the 4-dimensional tesseract has 24 square faces, each sharing two of 8 cubic cells.

===Number of polygonal faces of a polyhedron===
Any convex polyhedron&#x27;s surface has Euler characteristic

:formula_1

where is the number of vertices, is the number of edges, and is the number of faces. This equation is known as Euler&#x27;s polyhedron formula. Thus the number of faces is 2 more than the excess of the number of edges over the number of vertices. For example, a cube has 12 edges and 8 vertices, and hence 6 faces.

==&quot;k&quot;-face==
In higher-dimensional geometry, the faces of a polytope are features of all dimensions. A face of dimension is sometimes called a -face. For example, the polygonal faces of an ordinary polyhedron are 2-faces. The word &quot;face&quot; is defined differently in different areas of mathematics. For example, many but not all authors allow the polytope itself and the empty set as faces of a polytope, where the empty set is for consistency given a &quot;dimension&quot; of −1. For any -dimensional polytope, faces have dimension formula_2 with formula_3.

For example, with this meaning, the faces of a cube comprise the cube itself (a 3-face), its (square) facets (2-faces), its (line segment) edges (1-faces), its (point) vertices (0-faces), and the empty set.

In some areas of mathematics, such as polyhedral combinatorics, a polytope is by definition convex. In this setting, there is a precise definition: a face of a polytope in Euclidean space formula_4 is the intersection of with any closed halfspace whose boundary is disjoint from the relative interior of . According to this definition, the set of faces of a polytope includes the polytope itself and the empty set. For convex polytopes, this definition is equivalent to the general definition of a face of a convex set, given below.

In other areas of mathematics, such as the theories of abstract polytopes and star polytopes, the requirement of convexity is relaxed. One precise combinatorial concept that generalizes some earlier types of polyhedra is the notion of a simplicial complex. More generally, there is the notion of a polytopal complex.

An -dimensional simplex (line segment (), triangle (), tetrahedron (), etc.), defined by vertices, has a face for each subset of the vertices, from the empty set up through the set of all vertices. In particular, there are faces in total. The number of -faces, for , is the binomial coefficient formula_5.

There are specific names for -faces depending on the value of and, in some cases, how close is to the dimension of the polytope.

===Vertex or 0-face ===
Vertex is the common name for a 0-face.

===Edge or 1-face ===
Edge is the common name for a 1-face.

===Face or 2-face ===
The use of face in a context where a specific is meant for a -face but is not explicitly specified is commonly a 2-face.

===Cell or 3-face ===
A cell is a polyhedral element (3-face) of a 4-dimensional polytope or 3-dimensional tessellation, or higher. Cells are facets for 4-polytopes and 3-honeycombs.

Examples:
===Facet or (&quot;n&quot; − 1)-face ===
In higher-dimensional geometry, the facets of a -polytope are the ()-faces (faces of dimension one less than the polytope itself). A polytope is bounded by its facets.

For example:
*The facets of a line segment are its 0-faces or vertices.
*The facets of a polygon are its 1-faces or edges.
*The facets of a polyhedron or plane tiling are its 2-faces.
*The facets of a 4D polytope or 3-honeycomb are its 3-faces or cells.
*The facets of a 5D polytope or 4-honeycomb are its 4-faces.

===Ridge or (&quot;n&quot; − 2)-face ===
In related terminology, the ()-&quot;face&quot;s of an -polytope are called ridges (also subfacets). A ridge is seen as the boundary between exactly two facets of a polytope or honeycomb.

For example:
*The ridges of a 2D polygon or 1D tiling are its 0-faces or vertices.
*The ridges of a 3D polyhedron or plane tiling are its 1-faces or edges.
*The ridges of a 4D polytope or 3-honeycomb are its 2-faces or simply faces.
*The ridges of a 5D polytope or 4-honeycomb are its 3-faces or cells.

===Peak or (&quot;n&quot; − 3)-face ===
The ()-&quot;face&quot;s of an -polytope are called peaks. A peak contains a rotational axis of facets and ridges in a regular polytope or honeycomb.

For example:
*The peaks of a 3D polyhedron or plane tiling are its 0-faces or vertices.
*The peaks of a 4D polytope or 3-honeycomb are its 1-faces or edges.
*The peaks of a 5D polytope or 4-honeycomb are its 2-faces or simply faces.

==Face of a convex set==

The notion of a face can be generalized from convex polytopes to all convex sets, as follows. Let formula_6 be a convex set in a real vector space formula_7. A face of formula_6 is a convex subset formula_9 such that whenever a point formula_10 lies strictly between two points formula_11 and formula_12 in formula_6, both formula_11 and formula_12 must be in formula_16. Equivalently, for any formula_17 and any real number formula_18 such that formula_19 is in formula_16, formula_11 and formula_12 must be in formula_16.

According to this definition, formula_6 itself and the empty set are faces of formula_6; these are sometimes called the &quot;trivial faces&quot; of formula_6.

An extreme point of formula_6 is a point formula_28 such that formula_29 is a face of formula_6. That is, if formula_31 lies between two points formula_17, then formula_33.

For example:
* A triangle in the plane (including the region inside) is a convex set. Its nontrivial faces are the three vertices and the three edges. (So the only extreme points are the three vertices.)
* The only nontrivial faces of the closed unit disk formula_34 are its extreme points, namely the points on the unit circle formula_35.

Let formula_6 be a convex set in formula_37 that is compact (or equivalently, closed and bounded). Then formula_6 is the convex hull of its extreme points. More generally, each compact convex set in a locally convex topological vector space is the closed convex hull of its extreme points (the Krein–Milman theorem).

An exposed face of formula_6 is the subset of points of formula_6 where a linear functional achieves its minimum on formula_6. Thus, if formula_42 is a linear functional on formula_7 and formula_44, then formula_45 is an exposed face of formula_6.

An exposed point of formula_6 is a point formula_28 such that formula_29 is an exposed face of formula_6. That is, formula_51 for all formula_52. See the figure for examples of extreme points that are not exposed.

=== Competing definitions ===
Some authors do not include formula_6 and/or formula_54 as faces of formula_6. Some authors require a face to be a closed subset; this is automatic for formula_6 a compact convex set in a vector space of finite dimension, but not in infinite dimensions. In infinite dimensions, the functional formula_42 is usually assumed to be continuous in a given vector topology.

=== Properties ===
An exposed face of a convex set is a face. In particular, it is a convex subset.

If formula_16 is a face of a convex set formula_6, then a subset formula_60 is a face of formula_16 if and only if formula_62 is a face of formula_6.

<text>Zardoz is a 1974 science fantasy film written, produced, and directed by John Boorman and starring Sean Connery and Charlotte Rampling. It depicts a post-apocalyptic world where barbarians (the Brutals) worship the stone idol Zardoz while growing food for a hidden elite, the Eternals. The Brutal Zed becomes curious about Zardoz, and his curiosity forces a confrontation between the two camps.

Boorman decided to make the film after his abortive attempt at dramatising &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Burt Reynolds was originally given the role of Zed, but subsequently declined it due to illness. His place was taken by Sean Connery, who wanted to reinvent himself after portraying James Bond. It was shot entirely in County Wicklow in the east of Ireland.

==Plot==
In the year 2293, the human population is divided into the immortal &quot;Eternals&quot; and mortal &quot;Brutals&quot;. The Brutals live in an irradiated wasteland, growing food for the Eternals, who live apart in &quot;the Vortex,&quot; leading a luxurious but aimless existence on the grounds of a country estate. The Brutal Exterminators kill and terrorize other &quot;Brutals&quot; at the orders of Zardoz, a flying stone head which supplies them with weapons in exchange for the food they collect. Zed, a Brutal Exterminator, hides aboard Zardoz during one trip, temporarily &quot;killing&quot; its Eternal operator-creator Arthur Frayn.

Arriving in the Vortex, Zed meets two Eternals Consuella and her assistant May. Overcoming Zed with psychic powers, they make him a prisoner and menial worker within their community. Consuella wants Zed destroyed so that the resistance cannot use him to start a revolution; others, led by May and the subversive Eternal Friend, insist on keeping him alive for further study, while secretly planning to overthrow the government and end humanity&#x27;s suffering.

In time, Zed learns the nature of the Vortex. The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle, an artificial intelligence. Given their limitless lifespan, the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt, and are descending into madness. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into catatonia, forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the &quot;Apathetics&quot;. The Eternals spend their days stewarding humankind&#x27;s vast knowledge, baking special bread from the grain deliveries and participating in communal meditation rituals. To give life more meaning and in a failed attempt to stop humanity from becoming permanently catatonic, the Vortex developed complex social rules whose violators are punished with artificial aging. The most extreme offenders are condemned to permanent old age. Eternals who have managed to die, usually by accident, are then reborn into another healthy, synthetically reproduced body that is identical to the one they lost.

Zed is less brutal and far more intelligent than the Eternals think he is. Genetic analysis reveals he is the ultimate result of long-running eugenics experiments devised by Arthur Frayn, who controlled the outlands with the Exterminators. Zardoz&#x27;s aim was to breed a superman who would penetrate the Vortex and save human-kind from its hopelessly stagnant status quo. In the ruins of the old world, Arthur Frayn encouraged Zed to learn to read and led him to the book &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;. Understanding the origin of the name &quot;Zardoz&quot;Wizard of Ozbrought Zed to a true awareness of Frayn as a manipulator. Infuriated with this realization, Zed decided to further investigate the mystery of Zardoz.

As Zed divines the nature of the Vortex and its problems, the Eternals use him to fight their internecine quarrels. Led by Consuella, the Eternals decide to kill Zed and to age Friend. Zed escapes and, aided by May and Friend, absorbs all the Eternals&#x27; knowledge, including that of the Vortex&#x27;s origin, to destroy the Tabernacle. While absorbing their knowledge Zed impregnates May and a few of her followers as he is transformed from a revenge-seeking Exterminator. Zed shuts down the Tabernacle, thus disabling the force-fields and perception filters surrounding the Vortex. This helps the Exterminators invade the Vortex and kill most of the Eternals, who welcome death as a release from their boring existence. May and several of her followers escape the massacre, heading out to bear their offspring as enlightened but mortal beings among the Brutals.

Consuella, having fallen in love with Zed, gives birth within the remains of the stone head. The baby boy matures as his parents age. When the youth leaves his parents, they keep growing old and eventually die. Nothing remains in the space but painted handprints on the wall and Zed&#x27;s revolver.

==Production==
===Development===
Boorman was inspired to write &quot;Zardoz&quot; while preparing to adapt J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for United Artists, but when the studio became hesitant about the cost of producing film versions of Tolkien&#x27;s books, Boorman continued to be interested in the idea of inventing a strange new world. He wrote &quot;Zardoz&quot; with William (Bill) Stair, a long-time collaborator. Boorman said that he &quot;wanted to make a film about the problems of us hurtling at such a rate into the future that our emotions are lagging behind.&quot; The original draft was set five years in the future and was about a university lecturer who became obsessed with a young girl whose disappearance prompted him to seek her out in the communes where she had lived. Boorman visited some communes for research, but decided to set the story far in the future, when society had collapsed.

In the audio commentary, Boorman says he developed the emergent society, focusing on a central character &quot;who penetrated it. He&#x27;d be mysteriously chosen and at the same time manipulated ⁠— ⁠and I wanted the story to be told in the form of a mystery, with clues and riddles which unfold, the truth slowly peeled away.&quot; The script was influenced by the writings of L. Frank Baum, T.S. Eliot and Tolkien, and drew inspiration from medieval Arthurian quests. &quot;It&#x27;s about inner rather than outer space,&quot; said Boorman. &quot;It&#x27;s closer to the better science fiction literature which is more metaphysical. Most of the science fiction that gives the genre a bad name is adventure stories in space clothes.&quot;

&quot;Nobody wanted to do it. Warners didn&#x27;t want to do it, even though I&#x27;d made a shitload of money for them,&quot; Boorman said. His then-agent David Begelman knew the head of 20th Century Fox wanted to make a film with the director, and offered the executive the script to read, but insisted on a decision within two hours. &quot;It&#x27;s either yes or no,&quot; Begelman told him. &quot;You have no approvals, and it&#x27;s a million dollars negative pick-up&quot;. Boorman said that the &quot;Fox guy came to London, and I was very nervous, so we went for lunch whilst he read the script. When he finally came out of the office his hand was shaking, clearly with no idea of what to make of it. Begelman went straight up to him and said, &#x27;Congratulations!&#x27; He never gave the poor guy a chance.&quot;

===Casting===
In April 1973, Boorman announced the film would star Burt Reynolds and Charlotte Rampling. Reynolds had previously starred in Boorman&#x27;s film &quot;Deliverance&quot; (1972). However, Reynolds had to pull out due to illness and was replaced by Sean Connery. Boorman stated, &quot;Connery had just stopped doing the Bond films and he wasn&#x27;t getting any jobs, so he came along and did it.&quot; Connery&#x27;s casting was announced in May 1973 the week before filming was to begin. Rampling said she did the film because it is &quot;poetry. It clearly states: ⁠love your body, love nature, and love what you come from&quot;. Boorman had a cameo, as did his three daughters, Daisy, Katrine, and Telsche.

Locals were hired to help with the production. A group of County Wicklow artisans were hired to create many of the film&#x27;s futuristic costumes. The costumes were designed by Boorman&#x27;s first wife, Christel Kruse (the credits say they were made by La Tabard Boutique in Dublin), and were creations based on &quot;pure intuition&quot;. She decided that, because the Eternals&#x27; lives were purely metaphysical and colorless, this should be incorporated in their costumes too. As The Brutals were lower, more primitive beings, Christel decided that they would not care much about what they were wearing, only what was functional and comfortable. As stated in the magazine &quot;Dark Worlds Quarterly&quot; &quot;functional&quot; and &quot;comfortable&quot; costumes ended up meaning that the costumes were extremely revealing, &quot;It is the costumes for the Brutal Exterminators, and Zed in particular, that raise the eyebrows. [In] thigh-high leather boots, crossed bandoliers and ... shorts that can be described as &#x27;skimpy&#x27;, the Brutals, and Connery in particular, exude raw masculinity, particularly as they ride their steeds and fire their guns.&quot;

===Filming===
The film was financed by 20th Century Fox and produced by Boorman&#x27;s own self-titled company, John Boorman Productions Ltd., which was based in Dublin, principal photography for &quot;Zardoz&quot; took place from May to August 1973. It was reported that Stanley Kubrick was an uncredited technical advisor on the film.

The production was shot entirely on location in Republic of Ireland and was based out of Ardmore Studios in Bray, County Wicklow where the interior shots were completed. Connery lived in Bray while shooting. Locations at the Glencree Centre for Reconciliation, Hollybrook Hall (now Brennanstown Riding School) in Kilmacanogue, and Luggala mountain for the dramatic wasteland sequences. Boorman used the locations in the area for several films, including &quot;Excalibur&quot; (1981).

In the audio commentary, Boorman related how political and cultural conditions in Ireland at the time affected the production, saying that it was &quot;very difficult to get women to bare their breasts&quot; as nudity was a prominent feature in several sequences. He added that a ban on importing rifles, which had been imposed because of the Irish Republican Army, nearly prevented the movie from being made.

==Soundtrack==
Boorman commissioned David Munrow, director of the Early Music Consort, to compose the score. While the film is set in the distant future (the 23rd century approximately), Boorman believed futuristic music would contain a variety of old-world instruments. Boorman instructed Munrow to use a variety of medieval instruments including notch flutes, medieval bells and gemshorns. These instruments, plus snatches of Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh, gave the movie a truly unusual soundtrack.

Along with David Munrow&#x27;s medieval ensemble, the &quot;Zardoz&quot; soundtrack features Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No.7&quot; in A, 2nd movement, played by the &quot;Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra&quot; and Conducted by Eugen Jochum.

==Release==
&quot;Zardoz&quot; was released in theaters on 6 February 1974, in Los Angeles and New York. When the film was released, it was immediately met with terrible reviews. Along with the scathing reviews, the public reacted very poorly to the confusing world of &quot;Zardoz&quot;. According to a &quot;Starlog Magazine&quot; article on the film, &quot;these reviewers (and the general public) failed to understand many of Boorman&#x27;s analogies and philosophical statements&quot;. Moviegoers reported that &quot;when dissatisfied patrons from the previous showing exited the lobby, they would encourage those waiting to leave. Many times they did&quot;. &quot;Zardoz&quot; barely made back its budget, and ultimately earned $1.8 million in box office rentals in the United States and Canada.

===Home media===
&quot;Zardoz&quot; was first released on VHS in 1984. The film was released on Blu-Ray on 14 April 2015.

==Reception==
Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;Zardoz&quot; &quot;is science fiction that rarely succeeds in fulfilling its ambitious promises... Despite its pseudo-scientific gimcracks and a plethora of didactic dialogue, &quot;Zardoz&quot; is more confusing than exciting even with a frenetic, shoot-em-up climax&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it a &quot;genuinely quirky movie, a trip into a future that seems ruled by perpetually stoned set decorators... The movie is an exercise in self-indulgence (if often an interesting one) by Boorman, who more or less had &quot;carte blanche&quot; to do a personal project after his immensely successful &quot;Deliverance&quot;&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave it one star out of four and called it &quot;a message movie all right, and the message is that social commentary in the cinema is best restrained inside of a carefully-crafted story, not trumpeted with character labels, special effects, and a dose of despair that celebrates the director&#x27;s humanity while chastising the profligacy of the audience&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; reported the &quot;direction, good; script, a brilliant premise which unfortunately washes out in climactic sound and fury; and production, outstanding, particularly special visual effects which are among the best in recent years and belie the film&#x27;s modest cost&quot;.

Jay Cocks of &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the film &quot;visually bounteous&quot;, with &quot;bright intervals of self-deprecatory humor that lighten the occasional pomposity of the material&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was generally positive and wrote that its $1.5 million budget was &quot;an unbelievably low price for the dazzle on the screen and a tribute to creative ingenuity and personal dedication. It is a film which buffs and would-be filmmakers are likely to be examining with interest for years to come&quot;. Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that the script &quot;lacks the human dimensions that would make us care about the big visual sequences&quot; and burdened the actors with &quot;unspeakable dialogue&quot;, and also remarked that Connery &quot;acts like a man who agreed to do something before he grasped what it was&quot;.

===Re-appraisal===
It has been noted that &quot;Zardoz&quot; has developed a cult following. In 1992, Geoff Boucher, writing in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, felt that Boorman achieved his vision to a degree, and that &quot;for fans of wild science fiction, the film is a trippy examination of what happens when intellect overpowers humanity and humans taste immortality&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum, reviewing in the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, called it &quot;John Boorman&#x27;s most underrated filman impossibly ambitious and pretentious but also highly inventive, provocative, and visually striking SF adventure with metaphysical trimmings&quot;.

In 2007, Will Thomas of &quot;Empire Magazine&quot; wrote of &quot;Zardoz&quot;: &quot;You have to hand it to John Boorman. When he&#x27;s brilliant, he&#x27;s brilliant (&quot;Point Blank&quot;, &quot;Deliverance&quot;) but when he&#x27;s terrible, he&#x27;s &quot;really terrible&quot;. A fascinating reminder of what cinematic science fiction used to be like before &quot;Star Wars&quot;, this risible hodge-podge of literary allusions, highbrow porn, sci-fi staples, half-baked intellectualism and a real desire to do something revelatory misses the mark by a hundred miles but has elementsits badness being one of themthat make it strangely compelling&quot;. Channel 4 called it &quot;Boorman&#x27;s finest film&quot; and a &quot;wonderfully eccentric and visually exciting sci-fi quest&quot; that &quot;deserves reappraisal&quot;. In his audio commentary to the DVD/Blu-ray (first released in 2000, and included in subsequent releases), Boorman claimed it &quot;was a very indulgent and personal film&quot; but one he admits he may not have had the budget to properly achieve. It has since been the subject of re-appraisal and become a cult classic, described by Reader&#x27;s Digest as &quot;one of the wildest, most ambitious films of the 1970s.&quot;

The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of , with an average score of , based on reviews. Its consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Zardoz&quot; is ambitious and epic in scope, but its philosophical musings are rendered ineffective by its supreme weirdness and rickety execution&quot;. On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 46 out of 100 based on nine critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<text>George Linnaeus Banks (2 March 1821 – 3 May 1881) was a British journalist, editor, poet, playwright, amateur actor, orator, and Methodist. His wife was the author Isabella Banks.

George was born in Birmingham, the son of a seedsman familiar with the plant nomenclature of Linnaeus.

== Career ==
After a brief experience in a variety of trades, in his late teens George Banks became a contributor to various newspapers, and subsequently a playwright, being the author of plays, burlesques and lyrics. Between 1848 and 1864 he edited in succession a variety of newspapers, including the &quot;Birmingham Mercury&quot; and the &quot;Daily Express&quot; of Dublin.

George Banks&#x27; plays included &quot;The Slave King&quot;, written for the black actor Ira Aldridge, and &quot;The Swiss Father&quot;; his popular songs included The Minstrel King, Warwickshire Will, and Dandy Jim of Caroline, based on a negro melody; and his poetry included &quot;Daisies in the Grass&quot; (1865). Some of his more popular lines were frequently used by platform and pulpit orators, notably his lyrical What I Live For:

:&quot;I live for those who love me, for those who know me true; for the heaven that smiles above me and awaits my spirit too. For the cause that lacks assistance, for the wrong that needs resistance, for the future in the distance, and the good that I can do.&quot;

== Personal life ==
George Banks died of cancer and pneumonia in Dalston, Hackney, close to London, and is buried nearby at Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, with his wife, the author Isabella Banks.

<doc id="149931" wikidata="Q811145" url="?curid=149931" title="Navel piercing">
<text>A navel piercing (also referred to as a belly button piercing) is a type of piercing that penetrates the skin of the navel. It is most commonly located on the upper fold of skin but can also be affected underneath or around the edges of the navel. Healing usually takes around 6–12 months but varies person-to-person due to differences in physiology.

==History==

The history of navel piercing has been misrepresented, as many of the myths promulgated by Doug Malloy in the pamphlet &quot;Body &amp; Genital Piercing in Brief&quot; continue to be reprinted. For instance, according to Malloy&#x27;s colleague Jim Ward, Malloy alleged that navel piercing was popular among ancient Egyptian aristocrats and was depicted in Egyptian statuary, an allegation that is widely repeated. However, other sources deny that the historical record supports the allegation.

==Culture==

The navel piercing is one of the most prevalent body piercings today. Pop culture has played a large role in the promotion of the navel piercing. The navel piercing first hit the mainstream when model Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell revealed their navel piercings at a fashion show in London in 1993. The popularization of the piercing, however, is accredited to the 1993 Aerosmith music video for their song &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, wherein Alicia Silverstone has her navel pierced by body piercer Paul King. Another pop culture icon credited with launching the navel piercing into the mainstream is Britney Spears who prominently displayed the piercing in her album ...Baby One More Time and at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards. As of 2023, other celebrities including Dua Lipa, Megan Thee Stallion, Vanessa Hudgens, Miley Cyrus, and Normani continue to wear navel piercings. Navel jewelry was a popular trend during the late 1990s and early 2000s, and while it declined in popularity in the 2010s, celebrities including Addison Rae, Doja Cat, and Billie Eilish have continued to popularize the piercing in the 2020s. A comeback of the navel piercing was also signaled by Kim Kardashian who re-pierced her navel in 2024.

A 2022 study found that women are primarily motivated to pierce their navels due to a desire to enhance body image and that a navel piercing can, in turn, significantly improve bodily self-perception. The study further found that navel piercings become strongly, and beneficially, integrated into women’s bodily self image and that the piercing may be seen as expressions of body care that can protect against self-harming thoughts and behavior.

According to a 2005 survey of 10,503 people in England, 33% of the respondents had navel piercing making it the top body piercing site.

==Jewelry==

The jewelry used in navel piercing is commonly called &quot;belly rings&quot;. Belly rings are a midriff-revealing version of earrings.

Many new designs, such as the ancient Bali jewelry designs, have been added to modern navel cultures. Curved barbells remain the most commonly used jewelry, but captive bead rings, and other rings are popular as well, but due to the amount of movement in this area and the common complication of swelling, they are not recommended. The world&#x27;s first huggy was designed and patented by TummyToys belly rings. &quot;Vogue&quot; published an article in 2015 about the circular captive bead belly rings and TummyToys snap lock clasps becoming the latest trend for navel piercings. Most kinds of ring or bar jewelry can be worn in a navel piercing. Navels are most often pierced with a 14g curved barbell, which is recommended to be worn until the piercing has completely healed, the healing time is typically anywhere between 6–12 months. A wide variety of embellished jewelry is available for navels – simple curved barbells, captives, TummyToys huggies, flexible PTFE and deluxe long length styles with dangling pendants. Currently, real diamond and solid gold belly rings are also available in a wide range of styles. Most kinds of ring or bar jewelry can be worn in a navel piercing, both for top and bottom piercings.

There has been a special standard established for navel barbells (also called &quot;bananabells&quot; or &quot;bananabars&quot;, a reference to their curved shape). The standard barbell is thick and or long and is most commonly referred to as a 14-gauge post. The silver caps on the barbell post usually measure in diameter for the upper and in diameter for the lower.

Although navel bananabells are different from full rings, such as captive bead rings, which can also be worn in navel piercings, online body jewelry retailers and wholesalers tend to refer to these barbells as &quot;belly rings&quot;.

A new version of navel jewelry is on the market for those without pierced navels, which is based on the idea of clip-on earrings.

==Risks==

Navel piercings can be one of the slowest piercings to heal, with sources reporting a range of six months to two full years.

Navel piercings carry several risks, including:
*Infection: A new piercing may take up to 6–12 months before it can be taken out, during which time sweat, bacteria, and friction may lead to infection. A piercer cannot properly tell you whether a piercing is infected, but can give advice and recommend medical advice when needed. Infected navel piercings can result in sepsis and possibly death.
*Scarring: Skin tissue rarely heals to match the surrounding tissue. It heals in varying thickness, and size. It is likely that any piercing worn for a significant time (months to years) will leave a scar if removed.
* Rejection: Rejection is when the body pushes out a piercing in order for the wound to properly heal. This can happen even if the wearer takes very good care of the navel piercing. There is no way to stop rejection, as it is just the body&#x27;s natural healing process. It can be prevented, though, by maintaining proper aftercare, preventing it from getting pulled at or tugged on, and being pierced in the correct spot by a reputable piercer. If rejection occurs, the jewelry should be removed as soon as feasible to minimize the scarring.
*Migration: Migration can happen many ways, and for many different reasons. It may be that the amount of movement in the area pushed the piercing to a spot where it would be easier to heal, trauma from pulling or tugging on the piercing could have added excess scar tissue, or it was improperly pierced, making the body push it to a more comfortable spot.

<doc id="149932" wikidata="Q714106" url="?curid=149932" title="Nathaniel P. Banks">
<text>Nathaniel Prentice (or Prentiss) Banks (January 30, 1816 – September 1, 1894) was an American politician from Massachusetts and a Union general during the Civil War. A millworker, Banks became prominent in local debating societies and entered politics as a young adult. Initially a member of the Democratic Party, Banks&#x27;s abolitionist views drew him to the nascent Republican Party, through which he won election to the United States House of Representatives and as Governor of Massachusetts in the 1850s. At the start of the 34th Congress, he was elected Speaker of the House in an election that spanned a record 133 ballots taken over the course of two months.

At the outbreak of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln appointed Banks as one of the first political major generals, over the heads of West Point regulars, who initially resented him, but came to acknowledge his influence on the administration of the war. After suffering a series of inglorious setbacks in the Shenandoah River Valley at the hands of Stonewall Jackson, Banks replaced Benjamin Butler at New Orleans as commander of the Department of the Gulf, charged with the administration of Louisiana and gaining control of the Mississippi River. He failed to reinforce Grant at Vicksburg, and badly handled the Siege of Port Hudson, taking its surrender only after Vicksburg had fallen. He then launched the Red River Campaign, a failed attempt to occupy northern Louisiana and eastern Texas that prompted his recall. Banks was regularly criticized for the failures of his campaigns, notably in tactically important tasks, including reconnaissance. Banks was also instrumental in early reconstruction efforts in Louisiana, intended by Lincoln as a model for later such activities.
After the war, Banks returned to the Massachusetts political scene, serving in Congress, where he supported Manifest Destiny, influenced the Alaska Purchase legislation, and supported women&#x27;s suffrage. In his later years, he adopted more liberal progressive causes, and served as a United States marshal for Massachusetts before suffering a decline in his mental faculties.

==Early life==

Nathaniel Prentice Banks was born at Waltham, Massachusetts, the first child of Nathaniel P. Banks Sr. and Rebecca Greenwood Banks, on January 30, 1816. His father worked in the textile mill of the Boston Manufacturing Company, eventually becoming a foreman. Banks went to local schools until the age of fourteen, at which point the family&#x27;s financial demands compelled him to take a mill job. He started as a bobbin boy, responsible for replacing bobbins full of thread with empty ones, working in the mills of Waltham and Lowell. Because of this role he became known as Bobbin Boy Banks, a nickname he carried throughout his life. He was at one time apprenticed as a mechanic alongside Elias Howe, a cousin who later had the first patent for a sewing machine with a lockstitch design.

Recognizing the value of education, Banks continued to read, sometimes walking to Boston on his days off to visit the Atheneum Library. He attended company-sponsored lectures by luminaries of the day including Daniel Webster and other orators. He formed a debate club with other mill workers to improve their oratorical skills, and took up acting. He became involved in the local temperance movement; speaking at its events brought him to the attention of Democratic Party leaders, who asked him to speak at campaign events during the 1840 elections. He honed his oratorical and political skills by emulating Robert Rantoul Jr., a Democratic Congressman who also had humble beginnings. His personal good looks, voice, and flair for presentation were all assets that he used to gain advantage in the political sphere, and he deliberately sought to present himself with a more aristocratic bearing than was suggested by his humble beginnings.

Banks&#x27;s success as a speaker convinced him to quit the mill. He first worked as an editor for two short-lived political newspapers; after they failed he ran for a seat in the state legislature in 1844, but lost. He then applied for a job to Rantoul, who had been appointed Collector of the Port of Boston, a patronage position. Banks&#x27;s job, which he held until political changes forced him out in 1849, gave him sufficient security that he was able to marry Mary Theodosia Palmer, an ex-factory employee he had been courting for some time. Banks again ran for the state legislature in 1847, but was unsuccessful.

==Antebellum political career==
In 1848, Banks was victorious in another run for the state legislature, successfully organizing elements in Waltham whose votes were not easily controlled by the Whig-controlled Boston Manufacturing Company. Company leaders could effectively compel their workers to vote for Whig candidates because there was no secret ballot. He was at first moderate in opposition to the expansion of slavery, but recognizing the potency of the burgeoning abolitionist movement, he became more strongly attached to that cause as a vehicle for political advancement. This brought Banks, along with fellow Democrats Rantoul and George S. Boutwell to form a coalition with the Free Soil Party that successfully gained control of the legislature and governor&#x27;s chair. The deals negotiated after the coalition win in the 1850 election put Boutwell in the governor&#x27;s chair and made Banks the Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Although Banks did not like the radical Free Soiler Charles Sumner (either personally or for his strongly abolitionist politics), he supported the coalition agreement that resulted in Sumner&#x27;s election to the United States Senate, despite opposition from conservative Democrats. His role as house speaker and his effectiveness in conducting business raised his status significantly, as did his publicity work for the state Board of Education.

===Congress===
In 1852, Banks sought the Democratic nomination for a seat in the United States Congress. While it was at first granted, his refusal to disavow abolitionist positions meant support was withdrawn by party conservatives. He ended up winning a narrow victory anyway, with Free Soil support. In 1853, he presided over the state Constitutional Convention of 1853. This convention produced a series of proposals for constitutional reform, including a new constitution, all of which were rejected by voters. The failure, which was led by Whigs and conservative anti-abolitionist Democrats, spelled the end of the Democratic-Free Soil coalition.

In Congress, Banks sat on the Committee of Military Affairs. He bucked the Democratic party line by voting against the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which overturned the 1820 Missouri Compromise, using his parliamentary skills in an effort to keep the bill from coming to a vote. Supported by his constituents, he then publicly endorsed the abolitionist cause. His opposition came despite long stated support for Manifest Destiny (the idea that the United States was destined to rule the North American continent), which the bill&#x27;s proponents claimed it furthered. In 1854, he formally joined the so-called Know Nothing cause, a secretive populist and anti-immigration nativist movement – officially named American Party since 1855. He was renominated for Congress by the Democrats and Free Soilers, and won an easy victory in that year&#x27;s Know Nothing landslide victory. Banks was, along with Henry Wilson and Governor Henry J. Gardner, considered one of the political leaders of the Know Nothing movement, although none of the three supported its extreme anti-immigrant positions of many of its supporters.

In 1855, Banks agreed to chair the convention of a new Republican Party convention, whose platform was intended to bring together antislavery interests from the Democrats, Whigs, Free Soilers, and Know Nothings. When Know Nothing Governor Henry Gardner refused to join in the fusion, Banks carefully kept his options open, passively supporting the Republican effort but also avoiding criticism of Gardner in his speeches. Gardner was reelected. During the summer of 1855, Banks was invited to speak at an antislavery rally in Portland, Maine, his first major speaking opportunity outside Massachusetts. In the speech, Banks expressed his opinion that the Union did not necessarily need to be preserved, say that under certain conditions it would be appropriate to &quot;let [the Union] slide&quot;. Future political opponents would repeatedly use these words against him, accusing him of &quot;disunionism&quot;.

At the opening of the 34th U.S. Congress in December 1855, after the Democrats had lost their majority and only made up 35% of the House, representatives from several parties opposed to slavery&#x27;s spread gradually united in supporting the Know Nothing Banks for Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. After the longest speakership contests on record, lasting from December 3, 1855, to February 2, 1856, Banks was chosen on the 133rd ballot, receiving 103 votes out of 214 cast, or five less than an absolute majority. The coalition supporting him was formed by his American Party (known as the Know Nothing Party) and the Opposition Party, which opposed the Democrats, marking the first form of a coalition in congressional history. This victory was lauded at the time as the &quot;first Republican victory&quot; and &quot;first Northern victory&quot; – although Banks is officially affiliated as Speaker from the American Party – and greatly raised Banks&#x27;s national profile. He gave antislavery men important posts in Congress for the first time, and cooperated with investigations of both the Kansas conflict and the caning of Charles Sumner on the floor of the Senate. Because of his fairness in dealing with the numerous factions, as well his parliamentary ability, Banks was lauded by others in the body, including former Speaker Howell Cobb, who called him &quot;in all respects the best presiding officer [I] had ever seen.&quot;

Banks played a key role in 1856 in bringing forward John C. Frémont as a moderate Republican presidential nominee. Because of his success as speaker, Banks was considered a possible presidential contender, and his name was put in nomination by supporters (knowing that he supported Frémont) at the Know Nothing convention, held one week before the Republicans met. Banks then refused the Know Nothing nomination, which went instead to former President Millard Fillmore. Banks was active on the stump in support of Frémont, who lost the election to James Buchanan. Banks easily won reelection to his own seat, though Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives. He was not re-nominated for speaker when the 35th Congress convened in December 1857.

===Governor of Massachusetts===
In 1857, Banks ran for Governor of Massachusetts against the incumbent Gardner. His nomination by the Republicans was contentious, with opposition coming primarily from radical abolitionist interests opposed to his comparatively moderate stand on the issue. After a contentious general election campaign Banks won a comfortable victory. One key action Banks took in support of the antislavery movement was the dismissal of Judge Edward G. Loring. Loring had ruled in 1854 that Anthony Burns, a fugitive slave, be returned to slavery under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison, the legislature passed two Bills of Address, in 1855 and 1856, calling for Loring&#x27;s removal from his state office, but in both cases Gardner had declined to remove him. Banks signed a third such bill in 1858. He was rewarded with significant antislavery support, easily winning reelection in 1858.
Banks&#x27;s 1859 reelection was influenced by two significant issues. One was a state constitutional amendment requiring newly naturalized citizens to wait two years before becoming eligible to vote. Promoted by the state&#x27;s Know Nothings, it was passed by referendum in May of that year. Banks, catering to Know Nothing supporters, supported its passage, although Republicans elsewhere opposed such measures, because they were seeking immigrant votes. The amendment was repealed in 1863. The other issue was John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry, which more radical Republicans (notably John Albion Andrew) supported. Not yet ready for armed conflict, the state voted for the more moderate Banks. After the election, Banks vetoed a series of bills, over provisions removing a restriction limiting state militia participation to whites. This incensed the radical abolitionist forces in the legislature, but they were unable to override his vetoes in that year&#x27;s session, or of similar bills passed in the next.

Banks made a serious bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860, but dislike of him by the radicals in the state party harmed him. His failure to secure a majority in the state delegation prompted him to skip the national convention, where he received first-ballot votes as a nominee for Vice President. His attempt to promote Henry L. Dawes, another moderate Republican, as his successor in the governor&#x27;s chair also failed: the party nominated the radical Andrew, who went on to win the general election. Banks&#x27;s farewell speech, given with civil war looming, was an appeal for moderation and union.

During the summer of 1860, Banks accepted an offer to become a resident director of the Illinois Central Railroad, which had previously employed his mentor Robert Rantoul. Banks moved to Chicago after leaving office, and was engaged primarily in the promotion and sale of the railroad&#x27;s extensive lands. He continued to speak out in Illinois against the breakup of the Union.

==Civil War==
As the Civil War became imminent in early 1861, President Abraham Lincoln considered Banks for a cabinet post, despite a negative recommendation from Governor Andrew, who considered Banks to be unsuitable for any office. Lincoln rejected Banks in part because he had accepted the railroad job, but chose him as one of the first major generals (Maj. Gen.) of volunteers, appointing him on May 16, 1861. Many of the professional soldiers in the regular army were unhappy with this but Banks, given his national prominence as a leading Republican, brought political benefits to the administration, including the ability to attract recruits and money for the Union cause, despite his lack of field experience.

===First command===
Banks first commanded a military district in eastern Maryland, which notably included Baltimore, a hotbed of secessionist sentiment and a vital rail link. Banks for the most part stayed out of civil affairs, allowing political expression of secessionism to continue, while maintaining important rail connections between the north and Washington, DC. He did, however arrest the police chief and commissioners of the city of Baltimore, and replaced the police force with one that had more carefully vetted pro-Union sympathies. In August 1861, Banks was assigned to the western district of Maryland. There he was responsible for the arrest of legislators sympathetic to the Confederate cause (as was John Adams Dix, who succeeded Banks in the eastern district) in advance of legislative elections. This, combined with the release of local soldiers in his army to vote, ensured that the Maryland legislature remained pro-Union. Banks&#x27;s actions had a chilling effect on Confederate sentiment in Maryland. Although it was a slave state, it remained loyal through the war.

===Shenandoah Valley Campaign===
Banks&#x27;s division technically belonged to George McClellan despite serving as an independent command in the Shenandoah Valley. On March 14, 1862, President Lincoln issued an executive order forming all troops in McClellan&#x27;s department into corps. Banks thus became a corps commander, in charge of his own former division, now commanded by Brig. Gen Alpheus Williams, and the division of Brig. Gen James Shields, which was added to Banks&#x27;s command. After Stonewall Jackson was turned back at the First Battle of Kernstown on March 23, Banks was instead ordered to pursue Jackson up the valley, to prevent him from reinforcing the defenses of Richmond. When Banks&#x27;s men reached the southern Valley at the end of a difficult supply line, the president recalled them to Strasburg, at the northern end. Jackson then marched rapidly down the adjacent Luray Valley, and encountered some of Banks&#x27; forces in the Battle of Front Royal on May 23. This prompted Banks to withdraw to Winchester, where Jackson again attacked on May 25. The Union forces were poorly arrayed in defense, and retreated in disorder across the Potomac River and back into Maryland. An attempt to capture Jackson&#x27;s forces in a pincer movement (with forces led by John Frémont and Irvin McDowell) failed, and Jackson was able to reinforce Richmond. Banks was criticized for mishandling his troops and performing inadequate reconnaissance in the campaign, while his political allies sought to pin the blame for the debacle on the War Department.

===Northern Virginia Campaign===
In July, Maj. Gen John Pope was placed in command of the newly-formed Army of Virginia, which consisted of the commands of Banks, Irvin McDowell, and Franz Sigel. By early August this force was in Culpeper County. Pope gave Banks an ambiguous series of orders, directing him south of Culpeper to determine enemy strength, hold a fortified defensive position, and to engage the enemy. Banks showed none of the caution he had displayed against Stonewall Jackson in the Valley campaign, and moved to meet a larger force. Confederates he faced were numerically stronger and held, particularly around Cedar Mountain, the high ground. After an artillery duel began the August 9 Battle of Cedar Mountain he ordered a flanking maneuver on the Confederate right. Bank&#x27;s bold attack seemed close to breaking in the Confederate line, and might have given him a victory if he had committed his reserves in a timely manner. Only excellent commanding by the Confederates at the crucial moment of the battle and the fortuitous arrival of Hill allowed their numerical superiority to tell. Banks thought the battle one of the &quot;best fought&quot;; one of his officers thought it an act of folly by an incompetent general.&quot;

The arrival at the end of the day of Union reinforcements under Pope, as well as the rest of Jackson&#x27;s men, resulted in a two-day stand-off there, with the Confederates finally withdrawing from Cedar Mountain on August 11. Stonewall Jackson observed that Banks&#x27;s men fought well, and Lincoln also expressed confidence in his leadership. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, Banks was stationed with his corps at Bristoe Station and did not participate in the battle. Afterwards, the corps was integrated into the Army of the Potomac as the XII Corps and marched north with the main army during the Confederate invasion of Maryland. On September 12, Banks was abruptly relieved of command.

===Army of the Gulf===

In November 1862, President Lincoln gave Banks command of the Army of the Gulf, and asked him to organize a force of 30,000 new recruits, drawn from New York and New England. As a former governor of Massachusetts, he was politically connected to the governors of these states, and the recruitment effort was successful. In December he sailed from New York with a large force of raw recruits to replace Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler at New Orleans, Louisiana, as commander of the Department of the Gulf. Butler disliked Banks, but welcomed him to New Orleans and briefed him on civil and military affairs of importance. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, doubted the wisdom of replacing Butler (also a political general, and later a Massachusetts governor) with Banks, who he thought was a less able leader and administrator. Banks had to contend not just with Southern opposition to the occupation of New Orleans, but also to politically hostile Radical Republicans both in the city and in Washington, who criticized his moderate approach to administration.

===Siege of Port Hudson===

Part of Banks&#x27;s orders included instructions to advance up the Mississippi River to join forces with Ulysses S. Grant, in order to gain control of the waterway, which was under Confederate control between Vicksburg, Mississippi and Port Hudson, Louisiana. Grant was moving against Vicksburg, and Banks was under orders to secure Port Hudson before joining Grant at Vicksburg. He did not move immediately, because the garrison at Port Hudson was reported to be large, his new recruits were ill-equipped and insufficiently trained for action, and he was overwhelmed by the bureaucratic demands of administering the occupied portions of Louisiana. He did send forces to reoccupy Baton Rouge, and sent a small expedition that briefly occupied Galveston, Texas but was evicted in the Battle of Galveston on January 1, 1863.

In 1862, several Union gunboats had successfully passed onto the river between Vicksburg and Port Hudson, interfering with Confederate supply and troop movements. In March 1863, after they had been captured or destroyed, naval commander David Farragut sought to run the river past Port Hudson in a bid to regain control over that area, and convinced Banks to make a diversionary land attack on the Confederate stronghold. Banks marched with 12,000 men from Baton Rouge on March 13, but was unable to reach the enemy position due to inaccurate maps. He then compounded the failure to engage the enemy with miscommunications with Farragut. The naval commander successfully navigated two gunboats past Port Hudson, taking fire en route, without support. Banks ended up retreating back to Baton Rouge, his troops plundering all along the way. The episode was a further blow to Banks&#x27;s reputation as a military commander, leaving many with the false impression he had not wanted to support Farragut.
Under political pressure to show progress, Banks embarked on operations to secure a route that bypassed Port Hudson via the Red River in late March. He was eventually able to reach Alexandria, Louisiana, but stiff resistance from the smaller forces of Confederate General Richard Taylor meant he did not get there until early May. His army seized thousands of bales of cotton, and Banks claimed to have interrupted supplies to Confederate forces further east. During these operations Admiral Farragut turned command of the naval forces assisting Banks over to David Porter, with whom Banks had a difficult and prickly relationship.

Following a request from Grant for assistance against Vicksburg, Banks finally laid siege to Port Hudson in May 1863. Two attempts to storm the works, as with Grant at Vicksburg, were dismal failures. The first, made against the entrenched enemy on May 27, failed because of inadequate reconnaissance and because Banks failed to ensure the attacks along the line were coordinated. After a bloody repulse, Banks continued the siege, and launched a second assault on June 14. It was also badly coordinated, and the repulse was equally bloody: each of the two attacks resulted in more than 1,800 Union casualties. The Confederate garrison under General Franklin Gardner surrendered on July 9, 1863, after receiving word that Vicksburg had fallen. This brought the entire Mississippi River under Union control. The siege of Port Hudson was the first time that African-American soldiers were used in a major Civil War battle. The United States Colored Troops were authorized in 1863 and recruiting and training had to be conducted.

In the autumn of 1863, Lincoln and Chief of Staff Henry Halleck informed Banks that plans should be made for operations against the coast of Texas, chiefly for the purpose of preventing the French in Mexico from aiding the Confederates or occupying Texas, and to interdict Confederate supplies from Texas heading east. The second objective he attempted to achieve at first by sending a force against Galveston; his troops were badly beaten in the Second Battle of Sabine Pass on September 8. An expedition sent to Brownsville secured possession of the region near the mouth of the Rio Grande and the Texas outer islands in November.

===Red River Campaign===
As part of operations against Texas, Halleck also encouraged Banks to undertake the Red River Campaign, an overland operation into the resource-rich but well-defended parts of northern Texas. Banks and General Grant both considered the Red River Campaign a strategic distraction, with an eastward thrust to capture Mobile, Alabama preferred. Political forces prevailed, and Halleck drafted a plan for operations on the Red River.

The campaign lasted from March to May 1864, and was a major failure. Banks&#x27;s army was routed at the Battle of Mansfield (April 8) by General Taylor and retreated to make a stand the next day at the Battle of Pleasant Hill. Despite winning a tactical victory at Pleasant Hill, Banks continued the retreat to Alexandria, his force rejoining part of Porter&#x27;s Federal Inland Fleet. That naval force had joined the Red River Campaign to support the army and to take on cotton as a lucrative prize of war. Banks was accused of allowing &quot;hordes&quot; of private cotton speculators to accompany the expedition, but only a few did, and most of the cotton seized was taken by the army or navy. Banks did little, however, to prevent unauthorized agents from working the area. A cooperating land force launched from Little Rock, Arkansas was turned back in the Camden Expedition.

Part of Porter&#x27;s large fleet became trapped above the falls at Alexandria by low water, engineered by Confederates blowing a dam that had been constructed to artificially raise the water level when first entered by Porter&#x27;s fleet. Banks and others approved a plan proposed by Joseph Bailey to build wing dams as a means to raise what little water was left in the channel. In ten days, 10,000 troops built two dams, and managed to rescue Porter&#x27;s fleet, allowing all to retreat to the Mississippi River. After the campaign, General William T. Sherman famously said of the Red River campaign that it was &quot;One damn blunder from beginning to end&quot;, and Banks earned the dislike and loss of respect of his officers and rank and file for his mishandling of the campaign. On hearing of Banks&#x27;s retreat in late April, Grant wired Chief of Staff Halleck asking for Banks to be removed from command. The Confederates held the Red River for the remainder of the war.

===Louisiana Reconstruction===

Banks undertook a number of steps intended to facilitate the Reconstruction plans of President Lincoln in Louisiana. When Banks arrived in New Orleans, the atmosphere was somewhat hostile to the Union owing to some of Butler&#x27;s actions. Banks moderated some of Butler&#x27;s policies, freeing civilians that Butler had detained and reopening churches whose ministers refused to support the Union. He recruited large numbers of African Americans for the military, and instituted formal works and education programs to organize the many slaves who had left their plantations, believing they had been freed. Because Banks believed the plantation owners would need to play a role in Reconstruction, the work program was not particularly friendly to African Americans, requiring them to sign year-long work contracts, and subjecting vagrants to involuntary public work. The education program was effectively shut down after Southerners regained control of the city in 1865.
In August 1863, President Lincoln ordered Banks to oversee the creation of a new state constitution, and in December granted him wide-ranging authority to create a new civilian government. However, because voter enrollment was low, Banks canceled planned Congressional elections, and worked with civilian authorities to increase enrollment rates. After a February 1864 election organized by Banks, a Unionist government was elected in Louisiana, and Banks optimistically reported to Lincoln that Louisiana would &quot;become in two years, under a wise and strong government, one of the most loyal and prosperous States the world has ever seen.&quot; A constitutional convention held from April to July 1864 drafted a new constitution that provided for the emancipation of slaves. Banks was a significant influence on the convention, insisting that provisions be included for African-American education and at least partial suffrage.

By the time the convention ended, Banks&#x27;s Red River Campaign had come to its ignominious end and Banks was superseded in military (but not political) matters by Major General Edward Canby. President Lincoln ordered Banks to oversee elections held under the new constitution in September, and then ordered him to return to Washington to lobby Congress for acceptance of Louisiana&#x27;s constitution and elected Congressmen. Radical Republicans in Congress railed against his political efforts in Louisiana, and refused to seat Louisiana&#x27;s two Congressmen in early 1865. After six months, Banks returned to Louisiana to resume his military command under Canby. However, he was politically trapped between the civilian government and Canby, and resigned from the army in May 1865 after one month in New Orleans. He returned to Massachusetts in September 1865. In early 1865, Secretary of War Halleck ordered William Farrar Smith and James T. Brady to investigate breaches of Army regulations during the occupation of New Orleans. The commissioners&#x27; report, which was not published, found that the military administration was riddled by &quot;oppression, peculation, and graft&quot;.

Military recognition of Banks&#x27;s service in the war included election in 1867 and 1875 as commander of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts. In 1892, he was elected as a Veteran First Class Companion of the Massachusetts Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society for officers who had served the Union during the Civil War.

==Postbellum career==

On his return to Massachusetts, Banks immediately ran for Congress, for a seat vacated by the resignation of Radical Republican Daniel W. Gooch. The Massachusetts Republican Party, dominated by Radicals, opposed his run, but he prevailed easily at the state convention and in the general election, partially by wooing Radical voters by proclaiming support for Negro suffrage. He served from 1865 to 1873, during which time he chaired the Foreign Affairs Committee. Despite his nominally moderate politics, he was forced to vote with the Radicals on many issues, to avoid being seen as a supporter of President Johnson&#x27;s policies. He was active in supporting the reconstruction work he had done in Louisiana, trying to get its Congressional delegation seated in 1865. He was opposed in this by a powerful faction in Louisiana, who argued he had essentially set up a puppet regime. He also alienated Radical Republicans by accepting a bill on the matter that omitted a requirement that states not be readmitted until they had given their African-American citizenry voting rights. Despite his position as chair of an important committee, Banks was snubbed by President Grant, who worked around him whenever possible.

During this period in Congress, Banks was one of the strongest advocates of Manifest destiny. He introduced the Annexation Bill of 1866 promoting offers to annex all of British North America (effectively today&#x27;s Canada) in order to appeal to his heavily Irish-American constituency and to tap into the anger the American public felt towards Britain in its unofficial support for the Confederacy, such as blockade runners supplying weapons (which lengthened the war by two years and killed 400,000 additional Americans). This and other proposals he made died in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, chaired by Charles Sumner. Banks also played a significant role in securing passage of the Alaska Purchase funding bill, enacted in 1868. Banks&#x27; financial records strongly suggest he received a large gratuity from the Russian minister after the Alaska legislation passed. Although questions were raised not long after the bill&#x27;s passage, a House investigation of the matter effectively whitewashed the affair. Biographer Fred Harrington believes that Banks would have supported the legislation regardless of the payment he is alleged to have received. Banks also supported unsuccessful efforts to acquire some Caribbean islands, including the Danish West Indies and the Dominican Republic. He spoke out in support of Cuban independence.

In 1872, Banks joined the Liberal-Republican revolt in support of Horace Greeley. He had to some degree opposed a party trend away from labor reform, a subject that was close to many of his working-class constituents, but not the wealthy businessmen who were coming to dominate the Republican Party. While Banks was campaigning across the North for Greeley, the Radical Daniel W. Gooch successfully gathered enough support to defeat him for reelection; it was Banks&#x27; first defeat by Massachusetts voters. After his loss, Banks invested in an unsuccessful start-up Kentucky railroad headed by John Frémont, hoping its income would substitute for the political loss.

Seeking a revival of his political fortunes, in 1873, Banks ran successfully for the Massachusetts Senate, supported by a coalition of Liberal Republicans, Democrats, and Labor Reform groups. The latter groups he wooed in particular, adopting support for shorter workdays. In that term, he help draft and secure passage of a bill restricting hours of women and children to ten hours per day. In 1874, Banks was elected to Congress again, supported by a similar coalition in defeating Gooch. He served two terms (1875–1879), losing in the 1878 nominating process after formally rejoining the Republican fold. He was accused in that campaign of changing his positions too often to be considered reliable. After his defeat, President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Banks as a United States marshal for Massachusetts as a patronage reward for his service. He held the post from 1879 until 1888, but exercised poor oversight over his subordinates. He consequently became embroiled in legal action over the recovery of unpaid fees.

In 1888, Banks once again won a seat in Congress. He did not have much influence, because his mental health was failing. After one term he was not renominated, and retired to Waltham. His health continued to deteriorate, and he was briefly sent to McLean Hospital shortly before his death in Waltham on September 1, 1894. His death made nationwide headlines; he is buried in Waltham&#x27;s Grove Hill Cemetery.

==Legacy and honors==

Fort Banks in Winthrop, Massachusetts, built in the late 1890s, was named for him. A statue of him stands in Waltham&#x27;s Central Square, and Banks Street in New Orleans is named after him, as is Banks Court in Chicago&#x27;s Gold Coast neighborhood. The incorporated village of Banks, Michigan, was named for him in 1871. The Gale-Banks House, his home in Waltham from 1855 to his death, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Winifred Marjorie Wagner (née Williams; 23 June 1897 – 5 March 1980) was the English-born wife of Siegfried Wagner, the son of Richard Wagner, and ran the Bayreuth Festival after her husband&#x27;s death in 1930 until the end of World War II in 1945. She was a friend and supporter of Adolf Hitler, himself a Wagner enthusiast, and she and Hitler maintained a regular correspondence.

==Biography==
===Early life and marriage to Siegfried Wagner===
Wagner was born Winifred Marjorie Williams in Hastings, to John Williams, a Welsh journalist and critic, and his English-Danish wife, Emily Florence Williams, née Karop. Orphaned before the age of two, she initially was raised in a number of homes. Eight years later, she was adopted by a distant German relative of her mother, Henrietta Karop, and her husband Karl Klindworth, a musician and a friend of Richard Wagner.

The Bayreuth Festival was seen as a family business, with the leadership to be passed from Richard Wagner to his son Siegfried, but Siegfried, who was secretly bisexual, showed little interest in marriage. It was arranged that Winifred Klindworth, as she was called at the time, aged 17, would meet Siegfried Wagner, aged 45, at the Bayreuth Festival in 1914. A year later, they were married. It was hoped that the marriage would end Siegfried&#x27;s homosexual encounters and the associated costly scandals and provide an heir to carry on the family business. Following their marriage on 22 September 1915, they had four children in rapid succession. After the death of Siegfried Wagner in 1930, Winifred Wagner took over the Bayreuth Festival, running it until the end of World War II.

===Friendship with Adolf Hitler===
In 1923, Winifred Wagner met Adolf Hitler, who greatly admired Richard Wagner&#x27;s music. When Hitler was jailed for his part in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, Wagner sent him food parcels and stationery on which Hitler&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; may have been written. Although Wagner remained personally faithful to Hitler, she denied that she ever supported the Nazi Party. Her relationship with Hitler grew so close that by 1933 there were rumours of impending marriage (there were similar rumours about her love for English novelist Hugh Walpole). 

&quot;Haus Wahnfried&quot;, the Wagner home in Bayreuth, became Hitler&#x27;s favourite retreat. He stayed there on numerous occasions without his bodyguards, despite fears of his SS colleagues. Hitler gave the Bayreuth festival government assistance and tax-exempt status, and treated Wagner&#x27;s children solicitously. 

According to biographer Brigitte Hamann, Wagner was reported to be &quot;disgusted&quot; by Hitler&#x27;s persecution of the Jews. In one notable incident, in the late 1930s, a letter from her to Hitler prevented Hedwig and Alfred Pringsheim (whose daughter Katia was married to Thomas Mann) from being arrested by the Gestapo. Alfred Pringsheim was a fan of Richard Wagner, who he corresponded with and supported financially. He was also a patron of the Bayreuth Festival.

According to Gottfried Wagner, Winifred Wagner&#x27;s grandson, she never admitted any error to her ways. After the war, her posthumous devotion to Hitler, whom she referred to as &quot;USA&quot; – for &quot;Unser Seliger Adolf&quot; (our blessed Adolf) – remained undimmed. She corresponded with Hitler for nearly two decades. Scholars have not been allowed to see the letters, which have been kept locked away by Amélie Lafferentz, one of Winifred Wagner&#x27;s grandchildren, who has insisted that they not be released until the whole family agrees to do so.

===Post-Bayreuth years===
Like Hitler, Wagner believed profoundly in the rite of a secular cult of German nationalism, of Nordic self-realization, and &quot;völkisch&quot; aspiration. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, a denazification court banned her from the Bayreuth Festival, which she passed to her sons Wieland and Wolfgang. In the 1950s, she again became a political hostess. Her grandson Gottfried Wagner later recalled that
&quot;My aunt Friedelind was outraged when my grandmother again slowly blossomed as the first lady of right-wing groups and received political friends such as Emmy Göring, Ilse Hess, the former NPD Adolf von Thadden, Gerdy Troost, the wife of the Nazi architect and friend of Hitler Paul Ludwig Troost, the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley, the German NS-movie director Karl Ritter and the racist author and former Senator of the Reich Hans Severus Ziegler.&quot;

In 1975, Wagner gave a filmed interview to Hans-Jürgen Syberberg in which she appeared unrepentant concerning her past. &quot;To have met him [Hitler],&quot; she declared, &quot;is an experience I would not have missed.&quot; She was interviewed that year by David Irving, who reported that she had said she would still welcome Hitler at her door and that she had discussed with Hitler the saving of some individuals. She died in Überlingen, one of the best preserved medieval sites, on the shore of Lake Constance on 5 March 1980 at the age of 82 and was interred at Bayreuth.

== In popular culture ==
The friendship of Wagner and Hitler is treated fancifully in A.N. Wilson&#x27;s novel &quot;Winnie and Wolf&quot; (2007). &quot;The Music Keeper&quot;, an American play from 1982 by Elliot Tiber and André Ernotte, takes place two days before Wagner&#x27;s death and is about her relationship with Hitler.

<text>Protagonistas de la Música () is a Spanish language reality television series taped in Miami, where various participants competed to win a recording contract with Sony Records. Based on the &quot;Protagonistas...&quot; franchise, it aired from October 2002 to January 2003.

== Overview ==
The show pitted several young vocalists from various Latin-American countries against each other. They were sealed inside a studio living quarters and filmed 24 hours a day. An edited version of their daily activities was broadcast each night. They spent their days attending various performance classes, and every Wednesday performed a song in the weekly &quot;prueba de talento&quot;. The loser of the prueba was a candidate for dismissal from the household, and the contestants voted to select a second candidate. The public was then asked to choose one of the two candidates to be sent home from the studio. Fourteen original protagonistas were thus whittled down to four finalistas. The winners were the Cuban Barbara Higuera and the Dominican Miguel Angel Guzman. The show was immensely popular among young Latinos, but controversial among the older audience. There was some drama when singer Eddie Valdes left early for health reasons, although some insiders slated him as one of the top contenders.
The show was hosted by Puerto Rican singer Carlos Ponce.

== Other version ==
There is also a Chilean version of the show, aired in Canal 13, where the winner was Ximena Abarca. The main song was performed by Catalina Bono, winner of &quot;Protagonistas de la Fama&quot;, local version of &quot;Protagonistas de Novela&quot;.

<doc id="149937" wikidata="Q317557" url="?curid=149937" title="Parish church">
<text>A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented.

==Roman Catholic Church==
Each diocese (administrative unit, headed by a bishop) is divided into parishes. Normally, a parish consists of all Catholics living within its geographically defined area. Within a diocese, there can also be overlapping parishes for Catholics belonging to a particular rite, language, nationality, or community.

Each parish has its own central church called the parish church, where religious services take place. The parish church is the center of most Catholics&#x27; spiritual life since it is there that they receive the sacraments. On Sundays and perhaps also daily, Mass is celebrated by a priest resident in the parish. Confession is made available and perhaps Vespers in the larger or more progressive parishes. There are also laity-led activities and social events in accordance with local culture and circumstances.

Roman Catholics are not obliged to worship only at the parish church to which they belong, but they may for convenience or taste, attend services at any Roman Catholic church. However, their parish church is the one, where members of the parish must go to, for baptisms and weddings, unless they are permitted by the parish priest (US &#x27;pastor&#x27;) for celebrating those sacraments elsewhere. One sign of that is the parish church being the only one to have a baptismal font.

Some larger parishes or parishes that have been combined under one parish priest, may have two or more such churches, or the parish may be responsible for chapels (or chapels of ease) located at some distance from the mother church for the convenience of distant parishioners.

==Church of England and Church of Scotland==
In England and many British Overseas Territories as well as former British territories, the Church of England parish church is the basic administrative unit of episcopal churches. Parishes cover almost the whole area of England. In addition to ecclesiastic parishes, with which this article is concerned, there is also a system of civil parishes, which represent the smallest tier of administrative units. However since the 19th century these have not shared the same boundaries, or often the same names. (In other territories arrangements may differ, e.g. in Bermuda civil and church parishes still share the same boundaries, see Anglican Church of Bermuda). Most ecclesiastical parishes have an Anglican parish church, which is consecrated. If there is no parish church, the bishop licenses another building for worship, and may designate it as a parish centre of worship. This building is not consecrated, but is dedicated, and for most legal purposes it is deemed to be a parish church. In areas of increasing secularisation or shifts in religious belief, centres of worship are becoming more common, and many larger churches have been sold due to their upkeep costs. Instead the church may use community centres or the facilities of a local church of another denomination.
While villages and small towns may have a single parish church, larger towns may have a parish church and other smaller churches in various districts. These other churches do not have the legal or religious status of a parish church, and may be described by a variety of terms, such as &quot;chapel of ease&quot; (this term more often refers to an additional church in a geographically extensive rural parish) or &quot;mission church&quot;. Often the parish church will be the only one to have a full-time minister, who will also serve any smaller churches within the parish. (For example, St. Peter&#x27;s Church in St. George&#x27;s Parish, Bermuda, is located on St. George&#x27;s Island; hence, a chapel-of-ease, named simply &quot;Chapel-of-Ease&quot;, was erected on neighbouring St. David&#x27;s Island so that the island&#x27;s residents need not cross St. George&#x27;s Harbour.)

In cities without an Anglican cathedral, the parish church may have administrative functions similar to that of a cathedral. However, the diocese will still have a cathedral.

The Church of Scotland, the established Presbyterian church also uses a system of parish churches, covering the whole of Scotland.

==In American Protestantism==
In Massachusetts, towns elected publicly funded parish churches from 1780 until 1834, under the Constitution of Massachusetts.

===Protestant resurgence===
Toward the end of the 20th century, a new resurgence in interest in &quot;parish&quot; churches emerged across the United States. This has given rise to efforts like the Slow Church Movement and The Parish Collective which focus heavily on localized involvement across work, home, and church life.

<text>David Da-i Ho (; pinyin: &quot;Hé Dà-yī&quot;; born November 3, 1952) is a Taiwanese-American AIDS researcher, physician, and virologist who has made a number of scientific contributions to the understanding and treatment of HIV infection. He was a pioneer of combination anti-retroviral therapy instead of single therapy, which turned HIV from an absolute terminal disease into a chronic disease.

David Ho was born in Taiwan in 1952 and immigrated to the United States in 1965, where he was educated at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard Medical School (through the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology) before getting his clinical training at UCLA School of Medicine and Massachusetts General Hospital.

He is the founding scientific director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and the Clyde and Helen Wu Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, both housed at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.

==Early life and education==
David Ho was born in Taichung, Taiwan, to Paul (), an engineer, and Sonia Ho (née Jiang) (). He attended Taichung Municipal Guang-Fu Elementary School until sixth grade before immigrating to the United States with his mother and younger brother to unite with his father, who had already been in the US since 1957. 

Ho grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from John Marshall High School. He received his Bachelor of Science in biology with highest honors from the California Institute of Technology (1974). In 1978, Ho earned a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) from Harvard Medical School.

==Career==
Ho has been engaged in HIV/AIDS research since the beginning of the pandemic, initially focusing on clinical virology and select topics in HIV pathogenesis, including HIV drug resistance. Before 1996, AZT and other early 1990s antiretroviral medication were prescribed in single therapy, which still did not prevent progression to fatal full-blown AIDS. In the mid-1990s, his research team conducted a series of elegant human studies to elucidate the dynamics of HIV replication in vivo. This knowledge, in turn, formed the foundation for their pioneering effort to treat HIV &quot;early and hard&quot; and in demonstrating for the first time the durable control of HIV replication in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy, which had subsequently developed by scientists at NIAID and Merck. He and his ADARC team presented the remarkable results from using combination antiretroviral therapy at International AIDS Conference 1996. This was the turning point in the epidemic that an automatic death sentence was transformed into a manageable disease.

Ho has published more than 500 research papers as of February 2020.

Ho is a member of the Committee of 100, a Chinese American leadership organization, in addition to several scientific groups.

Ho led a team, funded by the Jack Ma Foundation, to look for a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. 

==Honors and titles==
Ho was &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1996 Man of the Year. &quot;Time&quot; later recalled the selection surprising both Ho and readers. The magazine acknowledged in 1996 that &quot;Ho is not, to be sure, a household name. But some people make headlines while others make history.&quot; As of 2024, Ho is the last person to be selected as Person of the Year in a U.S. presidential election year without winning that year&#x27;s U.S. presidential election. In 1998, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Ho was even briefly mentioned when Alexander Fleming was considered for Person of the Century in 1999, since Fleming could be portrayed as representative of other disease-fighting scientists including Ho, but the title ultimately went to Albert Einstein.

Ho was the chosen commencement speaker at Caltech, MIT, and Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health in 2000.

Ho has received numerous honors and awards for his scientific accomplishments. On January 8, 2001, he was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Clinton.

On December 6, 2006, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and First Lady Maria Shriver inducted Ho into the California Hall of Fame located at The California Museum for History, Women, and the Arts.

Ho was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Award by California Institute of Technology in 2015. Ho received the Portrait of a Nation Prize at the National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution in 2017.

Other accolades include the Ernst Jung Prize in Medicine, Mayor&#x27;s Award for Excellence in Science &amp; Technology, the Squibb Award, the Architect of Peace and the Hoechst Marion Roussel Award.

Ho has been elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Academia Sinica (Taiwan), and the U.S. National Academy of Medicine (formerly Institute of Medicine). He is currently a member of the board of trustees of the California Institute of Technology. He was a member of the Board of Overseers of Harvard University and a board member of the MIT Corporation.

He is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. 

Ho was recognized by the Kingdom of Thailand with the Prince Mahidol Award in Medicine.

Ho was awarded Hamdan Award for Medical Research Excellence - Immunity in 2022.

==Personal life==
Ho&#x27;s family&#x27;s ancestral home is Xinyu, Jiangxi Province. He is married to Tera Wong, with whom he has four children: Kathryn, Jonathan, Jaclyn, and Jerren.

<doc id="149941" wikidata="Q3595842" url="?curid=149941" title="Phlebotomy">
<text>Phlebotomy is the process of making a puncture in a vein, usually in the arm, with a cannula for the purpose of drawing blood. The procedure itself is known as a venipuncture, which is also used for intravenous therapy. A person who performs a phlebotomy is called a phlebotomist, although most doctors, nurses, and other technicians can also carry out a phlebotomy. In contrast, phlebectomy is the removal of a vein.

Phlebotomies that are carried out in the treatment of some blood disorders are known as &quot;therapeutic phlebotomies&quot;. The average volume of whole blood drawn in a therapeutic phlebotomy to an adult is 1 unit (450–500 ml) weekly to once every several months, as needed.

==Etymology==
From ( – &#x27;blood vessel, vein&#x27; + &#x27;cutting&#x27;), via (modern French ).

==Phlebotomies==

Phlebotomies are carried out by phlebotomists – people trained to draw blood mostly from veins for clinical or medical testing, transfusions, donations, or research. Blood is collected primarily by performing venipunctures, or by using capillary blood sampling with fingersticks or a heel stick in infants for the collection of minute quantities of blood. The duties of a phlebotomist may include interpreting the tests requested, drawing blood into the correct tubes with the proper additives, accurately explaining the procedure to the person and preparing them accordingly, practicing the required forms of asepsis, practicing standard and universal precautions, restoring hemostasis of the puncture site, giving instructions on post-puncture care, affixing tubes with electronically printed labels, and delivering specimens to a laboratory. Some countries, states, or districts require that phlebotomists be licensed or registered.

A therapeutic phlebotomy may be carried out in the treatment of some blood disorders (example: Hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, porphyria cutanea tarda), and chronic hives (in research).

===Australia===
In Australia, there are a number of courses in phlebotomy offered by educational institutions, but training is typically provided on the job. The minimum primary qualification for phlebotomists in Australia is a Certificate III in Pathology Collection (HLT37215) from an approved educational institution.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK there is no requirement for holding a formal qualification or certification prior to becoming a phlebotomist as training is usually provided on the job. The NHS offers training with formal certification upon completion.

===United States===

Special state certification in the United States is required only in four states: California, Washington, Nevada, and Louisiana. A phlebotomist can become nationally certified through many different organizations. However, California currently only accepts national certificates from six agencies. These include the American Certification Agency (ACA), American Medical Technologists (AMT), American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP), National Center for Competency Testing/Multi-skilled Medical Certification Institute (NCCT/MMCI), National Credentialing Agency (NCA), and National Healthcareer Association (NHA). These and other agencies such as the American Society of Phlebotomy Technicians also certify phlebotomists outside the state of California. To qualify to sit for an examination, candidates must complete a full phlebotomy course and provide documentation of clinical or laboratory experience.

===South Africa===
In South Africa learnerships to qualify as a Phlebotomy Technician are offered by many public and private educational institutions as well as by private academies owned up by pathology laboratories (such as Ampath Laboratories, Lancet, PathCare) and healthcare service providers (such as Netcare, South African National Blood Service). Some of the larger retail pharmacy chains offering in-store clinical services (such as Clicks, Dis-Chem) also provide training for aspirant phlebotomists. Certification can be obtained from a number of examination and testing institutions. To work as a phlebotomist in South Africa, registration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) is required.

==Sample tube types==
==Draw station==
A phlebotomy draw station is a place where blood is drawn from patients for laboratory testing, transfusions, donations, or research purposes. The blood is typically drawn via venipuncture or a finger stick by a healthcare professional such as a phlebotomist, nurse, or medical assistant.
The draw station typically includes a padded chair or a bed for patients prone to fainting during blood draws.
Draw stations can be found in various settings, such as hospitals, clinics, blood donation centers, and independent laboratories or as part of patient service centers (PSC).

==History==

Early phlebotomists used techniques such as leeches and incision to extract blood from the body. Bloodletting was used as a therapeutic as well as a prophylactic process, thought to remove toxins from the body and to balance the humors. While physicians did perform bloodletting, it was a specialty of barber surgeons, the primary provider of health care to most people in the medieval and early modern eras.

<text>Byland Abbey is a ruined abbey and a small village in Byland with Wass civil parish, in the former Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, in the North York Moors National Park.

==History==
It was founded as a Savigniac abbey in January 1135 and was absorbed by the Cistercian order in 1147. It was not an easy start for the community which had had to move five times before settling at the present site. The group of thirteen monks first left Furness Abbey, then in Lancashire, in 1134. They founded a new abbey at Calder, in Cumberland, and remained there for four years. They then suffered their first setback, when a Scottish raid forced them to return to Furness. However, they were refused re-entry, possibly due to lack of space at Furness or because their abbot, Gerald, refused to resign his rank. They departed for York, to seek the help of the reforming Archbishop Thurstan. However, their plans changed and at Thirsk they sought the assistance of Gundreda d&#x27;Aubigny, who settled them at Hood. In 1143 they moved to Old Byland, but found this site too close too the Cistercian abbey of Rievaulx – the monks were constantly disturbed by each other&#x27;s bells. In 1147, the year they joined the Cistercian congregation, the monks moved again to Stocking, where they apparently built a stone church. Meanwhile, permanent buildings were being erected for them at the final site of New Byland, near Coxwold, to which they moved in 1177.

Its early history was marked by disputes with no fewer than four other religious establishments: Furness Abbey, Calder Abbey, Rievaulx Abbey and Newburgh Priory. However, once it had overcome these setbacks, it was described, in the late 14th century, as &quot;one of the three shining lights of the north&quot;. Its financial success was not as great as such abbeys as Rievaulx, but it was famed for its sheep rearing and wool exports. Its church was said to be among the finest 12th-century churches in Europe.

In October 1322, King Edward II was at Byland Abbey when the Battle of Old Byland took place. The marauding Scots caught Edward so unaware that he fled to York, leaving many precious items behind.

In the late 12th century the abbey had a complement of 36 monks and 100 lay brothers, but by the time of the dissolution in November 1538, the abbey was host only to 25 monks and an abbot. In the Valor Ecclesiasticus survey of 1535 it was valued at £238. In 1539, the abbey was dissolved and its site was granted to Sir William Pickering. It later passed to the Wombwell family, which still owns it.

The site is now maintained by English Heritage and is scheduled as an ancient monument by Historic England with grade I listed status. In October 2017, the west frontage of the church, including the famed Rose Window, underwent extensive conservation work to repair water damage and to repoint the stone walls.

=== Burials ===

*Joan of Lancaster, third daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster

=== Medieval ghost stories ===
Numerous Latin manuscripts were produced at and owned by Byland Abbey, of which twenty-seven are known to have survived. The abbey notably produced a 15th century cartulary, now British Library Egerton MS 2823. One of the manuscripts owned by Byland Abbey in the Middle Ages is noted for containing a collection of twelve ghost stories. The manuscript is now London, British Library Royal MS 15 A xx, produced in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries, primarily containing a copy of the &quot;Elucidarium&quot; and some tracts by Cicero. However, in the early fifteenth century, an anonymous scribe, known in scholarship simply as &#x27;a monk of Byland&#x27;, added some extra texts, also in Latin, on previously blank pages (folios 140-43, in the body of the manuscript, and folio 163 b at the end). These are a series of twelve ghost stories, mostly set locally, which were presumably intended for inclusion in sermons as &quot;exempla&quot; and which reflect orally circulating folklore in Yorkshire at the time. While not a major literary production in their own time, these stories have since come to be regarded as important evidence for popular belief regarding ghosts in medieval north-west Europe.

A facsimile of the manuscript is available online, the texts were edited by M. R. James, and they were translated by A. J. Grant (while seven are also paraphrased in English by Andrew Joynes).

An example, the third story, runs in English translation as follows:

III. Regarding the spirit of Robert son of Robert de Boltebi from Killeburne, confined in a cemetery.

Remembered because the aforesaid younger Robert died and was interred in a cemetery but was wont to depart from the tomb at night and to disturb and frighten off the villagers, and the dogs of the village would follow him and bark loudly. At last the young men of the village spoke together, proposing to capture him if by any means they were able, and convening at the cemetery. But having seen him, all fled except two of them. One, called Robert Foxton, caught him as he emerged from the cemetery and laid him over the church gate, loudly and courageously shouting &quot;You hold fast until I come to you&quot;. The other replied, &quot;You dash quickly to the minister so that he may be , since, God willing, because I have him fast, I will hang on until the arrival of the priest&quot;. The priest of the parish indeed hurried quickly and conjured him the holy name of the Trinity and by the virtue of Jesus Christ until he responded to his questions.

At that conjuration, he spoke in his guts (and not with his tongue, but as if in a large empty jar) and confessed his many crimes. When he knew these, the priest absolved him but he insisted that the aforesaid capturers would not reveal in any way his confession, and otherwise he rested in peace, having been set in order with God.

==Description==
Extensive remains can still be seen of all the main buildings of the abbey. The most important building was the vast church, which was grander than any previous Cistercian building in Britain. It replaced a smaller unfinished church, of which parts of the nave and south transept survive, and was under construction from the late 1160s to about 1195. It was aisled throughout, with the aisles behind the presbytery and to the west of the transepts being particularly unusual. The plan was cruciform, with a twelve-bay nave and a lantern tower over the crossing, in violation of Cistercian custom. The elaboration of the church was also novel, with a three-storey internal elevation, wooden vaults over the high central vessels, and shafted columns of a type that was copied across northern England. The design seems to have been inspired by the contemporary work at Ripon Cathedral (then a minster under York), and possibly Archbishop Roger&#x27;s vanished eastern limb at York itself. The west front of the church stands almost to its full height, while the monastic building ruins have a height of about in places. At the top of the west front is the lower half of a huge rose window which was the inspiration for the southern rose window at York Minster. The rest of the church is harder to visualise as all the internal arcades were destroyed after the Dissolution, but most of the external walls stand up to the level of the top of the aisles, as well as one corner of the south transept that stands to its full height. Some of the arcaded stone screens dividing the church into sections for the monks and lay brothers were recovered in excavation and have been reset. An altar table (mensa) was also recovered, although that is now in Ampleforth Abbey. Mosaic floor tiles of the 1230s survive in large areas of the south transept and presbytery, in yellows and greens.

To the south of the church was the cloister, 145 feet (44m) square and laid out in the early 1160s. It was surrounded by three ranges containing the monks&#x27; domestic buildings. The east range adjoined the south transept of the church, and has mostly been reduced to low walls. The first room south of the transept was the library and sacristy. The next room was the chapter house, which was vaulted over four central columns and projected beyond the body of the range. The surviving stone lectern base from the chapter house is the only example of its kind in Britain. The next room was the parlour, and then there was a passage to the ground floor of the reredorter. South again was the day stair, and finally there was the day room, where the monks worked, which opened onto a yard to the east. Over the whole range was the dormitory, which has vanished. The south range housed the warming room and the kitchen. Between them stood the refectory, aligned north-south in the Cistercian manner, of which some high walls and a window survive. It was raised over a vaulted undercroft. The west range was the longest, and housed the lay brothers. They were segregated from the choir monks by a &#x27;lane&#x27;, and had their own dormitory, refectory and reredorter. Unusually, they also had their own cloister, tucked behind the kitchen. This range was the first to be built, possibly in the 1150s, so that it could house the lay brothers who would then assist with constructing the rest before the monks moved in in 1177.

To the east of the main claustral buildings stood the infirmary, the reredorter and the abbot&#x27;s house. These parts were greatly altered throughout the abbey&#x27;s working life. In the 13th century a new detached abbot&#x27;s house was built to the south of the infirmary, and the reredorter was replaced as the drainage was found wanting. Then, in the late 14th century, the infirmary was demolished and replaced by a series of apartments, reflecting the decline in communal living. Rievaulx similarly lost its infirmary in the later middle ages. Further apartments were formed out of the old day room, and possibly the dormitory.

The limestone gatehouse also survives, as a ruin. The remains consist of moulded imposts supporting moulded capitals carrying a round arch with two moulded orders and a hood mould. Attached to it is a wall containing a blocked doorway with a pointed arch and a moulded surround. Of the other outer buildings in the precinct, dry hollows remain of the three large millponds, and extensive earthworks can be seen of the rest.

In 2017, conservation work was undertaken to preserve the remains.

<text>Jervaulx Abbey in East Witton in North Yorkshire, north-west of the city of Ripon, was one of the great Cistercian abbeys of Yorkshire, England, dedicated to St Mary in 1156. It is a Grade I listed building.

The place name &quot;Jervaulx&quot; is first attested in 1145, where it appears as &quot;Jorvalle&quot;. The name is French for &#x27;the Ure valley&#x27; and is perhaps a translation of the English &#x27;Ure-dale&#x27;, also known as Yoredale. The valley is now called Wensleydale.

==History==
Initially a Savigniac foundation out of Normandy, the abbey was later taken over by the Cistercian order from Burgundy and responsibility for it was taken by Byland Abbey. Founded in 1145 at Fors near Aysgarth, it was moved ten years later to a site a few miles away on the banks of the River Ure. In 1145, in the reign of King Stephen, Akarius Fitz Bardolph, who was Lord of Ravensworth, gave Peter de Quinciano, a monk from Savigny, land at Fors and Worton, in Wensleydale, to build a monastery of their order. The monastery there was successively called the Abbey of Fors, Jervaulx and Charity. Grange, west-north-west of Aysgarth, a hamlet in the township of Low Abbotside in the parish of Aysgarth, is the original site of Fors Abbey. After it was abandoned it was known by the name of Dale Grange and now by that of the Grange alone.
Serlo, then Abbot of Savigny, disapproved of the foundation, since it had been made without his knowledge and consent. He refused to supply it with monks from his abbey because of the great difficulties experienced by those he had previously sent to England. Therefore in a general chapter he proposed that it be transferred to the Abbey of Belland (Byland), which was closer and would be able to provide the assistance required by the new foundation. Monks were sent from Byland and after they had undergone great hardships because of the meagreness of their endowment and sterility of their lands Conan, son of Alan, 1st Earl of Richmond, greatly increased their revenues and in 1156 moved their monastery to its better location in East Witton. Here the monks erected a new church and monastery, which, like most of the Cistercian order, was dedicated to St Mary. At the height of its prosperity the abbey owned half of the valley and was renowned for breeding horses, a tradition that remains in Middleham to the present day. It was also the original home of Wensleydale cheese, originally made with ewes&#x27; milk. In 1279 Abbot Philip of Jervaulx was murdered by one of his monks.
His successor, Abbot Thomas, was initially accused of the crime, but a jury later determined that he was not to blame, and another monk fled under outlawry.

According to John Speed, at the Dissolution it was valued at . The last abbot, Adam Sedbergh, joined the Pilgrimage of Grace and was hanged at Tyburn in June 1537, when the monastic property was forfeited to the king.

==Post Reformation==

The pulpitum screen with part of the stalls can now be seen at St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Aysgarth, and a window was reused at St Gregory&#x27;s parish church in Bedale.

As the monasteries kept people employed and from starving, the regional disturbances were occasioned by desperation, and, as the monastic system was not diocesan or provincial to make a swift transition within the nationalized episcopal system, there was no immediate resolution to tenant sufferings. Jervaulx, Byland and other Cistercian houses were as much attached to Savigny and Citeaux Abbey in the Duchy of Burgundy as Richmondshire and the Honour of Richmond generally were to the Duchy of Brittany, both establishments based in France but cut off owing to the Hundred Years&#x27; War and especially after the loss of the Pale of Calais.

The standing remains of the abbey include part of the church and claustral buildings and a watermill. The lordship of East Witton, including the site of the abbey, was granted by Henry VIII to Matthew Stuart, 4th Earl of Lennox, and Margaret, his wife, the king&#x27;s niece, and after passing through various hands the property came into the possession of the Bruce family, one of whom was created Earl of Ailesbury in 1805. The estate was purchased from the trustees of Ernest Brudenell-Bruce, 3rd Marquess of Ailesbury, in 1887 by S. Cunliffe Lister Esq. of Swinton Park for £310,000.
It was purchased by Major and Mrs W. V. Burdon in 1971. Their youngest son, Ian, now runs the abbey, the ruins of which are open to the public.

<doc id="149947" wikidata="Q261103" url="?curid=149947" title="Parable of the Good Samaritan">
<text>The parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke. It is about a traveler (implicitly understood to be Jewish) who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. A Jewish priest and then a Levite come by, both avoiding the man. A Samaritan happens upon him and, though Samaritans and Jews were generally antagonistic toward each other, helps him. Jesus tells the parable in response to a provocative question from a lawyer in the context of the Great Commandment: &quot;And who is my neighbor?&quot; The conclusion is that the neighbor figure in the parable is the one who shows mercy to their fellow man or woman.

Some Christians, such as Augustine, have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul. Others discount this allegory as unrelated to the parable&#x27;s original meaning and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.

The parable has inspired painting, sculpture, satire, poetry, photography, film, and many others. The phrase &quot;&quot;, meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many hospitals and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan.

==Narrative==
In the Gospel of Luke chapter 10, the parable is introduced by a question, known as the Great Commandment:

Jesus replies with a story:
==Historical context==
===Road from Jerusalem to Jericho===
In the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the &quot;Way of Blood&quot; because &quot;of the blood which is often shed there by robbers who robbed people&quot;. Martin Luther King Jr., on the day before his assassination, described the road as follows:

===Samaritans and Jesus===
Jesus&#x27; target audience, the Jews, hated Samaritans to such a degree that they destroyed the Samaritans&#x27; temple on Mount Gerizim. The Samaritans, reciprocally, hated the Jews. Tensions between them were particularly high in the early decades of the 1st century because Samaritans had desecrated the Jewish Temple at Passover with human bones. Due to this hatred, some think that the lawyer&#x27;s phrase &quot;The one who had mercy on him&quot; (Luke 10:37) may indicate a reluctance to name the Samaritan. Or, on another, more positive note, it may indicate that the lawyer has recognized that both his questions have been answered and now concludes by generally expressing that anyone behaving thus is a (Leviticus 19:18) &quot;neighbor&quot; eligible to inherit eternal life.

As the story reached those who were unaware of its context—i.e., the oppression of the Samaritans, and the bitter hatred that Jesus&#x27; listeners and Samaritans had for each other—this aspect of the parable received less and less recognition; uninformed people saw &quot;Samaritan&quot; as merely a convenient name for that individual, when in fact it stood for &quot;hated outsider who worships falsely and desecrates our religion&quot;. Today, to remedy this missing context, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity&#x27;s opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice. For example, anti-slavery campaigner William Jay described clergy who ignored slavery as &quot;following the example of the priest and Levite&quot;. Martin Luther King Jr., in his April 1968 &quot;I&#x27;ve Been to the Mountaintop&quot; speech, described the Samaritan as &quot;a man of another race&quot;. Sundee Tucker Frazier saw the Samaritan more specifically as an example of a &quot;mixed-race&quot; person. Klyne Snodgrass wrote: &quot;On the basis of this parable we must deal with our own racism but must also seek justice for, and offer assistance to, those in need, regardless of the group to which they belong.&quot;

Samaritans appear elsewhere in the Gospels and Book of Acts. In the Gospel of Luke, Jesus heals ten lepers and only the Samaritan among them thanks him, although Luke 9:51–56 depicts Jesus receiving a hostile reception in Samaria. Luke&#x27;s favorable treatment of Samaritans is in line with the favorable treatment elsewhere in the book of the weak and of outcasts, generally. In John, Jesus has an extended dialogue with a Samaritan woman, and many Samaritans come to believe in him. In Matthew, he instructs his disciples not to preach to Gentiles or in Samaritan cities. In the Gospels, generally, &quot;though the Jews of Jesus&#x27; day had no time for the &#x27;half-breed&#x27; people of Samaria&quot;, Jesus &quot;never spoke disparagingly about them&quot; and &quot;held a benign view of Samaritans&quot;.

Many see 2 Chronicles 28:8–15 as the model for the Samaritan&#x27;s neighborly behavior in the parable. In Chronicles, Northern Israelite ancestors of Samaritans treat Judean enemies as fellow-Israelite neighbors. After comparing the earlier account with the later parable presented to the expert in Israel&#x27;s religious law, one could conclude: &quot;Given the number and significance of these parallels and points of correspondence it is hard to imagine how a first-century scholar of Scripture could hear the parable and not think of the story of the merciful Samaritans of 2 Chronicles 28.&quot;

===Priests and Levites===
In Jewish culture, contact with a dead body was understood to be defiling. Priests were particularly enjoined to avoid uncleanness. The priest and Levite may therefore have assumed that the fallen traveler was dead and avoided him to keep themselves ritually clean. On the other hand, the depiction of travel downhill (from Jerusalem to Jericho) may indicate that their temple duties had already been completed, making this explanation less likely, although this is disputed. Since the Mishnah made an exception for neglected corpses, the priest and the Levite could have used the law to justify both touching a corpse or ignoring it. In any case, passing by on the other side avoided checking &quot;whether he was dead or alive&quot;. Indeed, &quot;it weighed more with them that he might be dead and defiling to the touch of those whose business was with holy things than that he might be alive and in need of care.&quot;

==Interpretation==

===Allegorical reading===
Origen described the allegory as follows:
John Welch further states:
The allegorical interpretation is also traditional in the Eastern Orthodox Church. John Newton refers to the allegorical interpretation in his hymn &quot;How Kind the Good Samaritan&quot;, which begins:

Robert Funk also suggests that Jesus&#x27; Jewish listeners were to identify with the robbed and wounded man. In his view, the help received from a hated Samaritan is like the kingdom of God received as grace from an unexpected source.

===Ethical reading===

John Calvin was not impressed by Origen&#x27;s allegorical reading:

The meaning of the parable for Calvin was, instead, that &quot;compassion, which an enemy showed to a Jew, demonstrates that the guidance and teaching of nature are sufficient to show that man was created for the sake of man. Hence it is inferred that there is a mutual obligation between all men.&quot; In other writings, Calvin pointed out that people are not born merely for themselves, but rather &quot;mankind is knit together with a holy knot[...] we must not live for ourselves, but for our neighbors.&quot; Earlier, Cyril of Alexandria had written that &quot;a crown of love is being twined for him who loves his neighbour.&quot;

Francis Schaeffer suggested: &quot;Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen. That is ugly. We are to have the example of the good Samaritan consciously in mind at all times.&quot;

Other modern theologians have taken similar positions. For example, G. B. Caird wrote:
Joel B. Green writes that Jesus&#x27; final question (which, in something of a &quot;twist&quot;, reverses the question originally asked):

Such a reading of the parable makes it important in liberation theology, where it provides a concrete anchoring for love and indicates an &quot;all embracing reach of solidarity.&quot; In Indian Dalit theology, it is seen as providing a &quot;life-giving message to the marginalized Dalits and a challenging message to the non-Dalits.&quot;

Martin Luther King Jr. often spoke of this parable, contrasting the rapacious philosophy of the robbers, and the self-preserving non-involvement of the priest and Levite, with the Samaritan&#x27;s coming to the aid of the man in need. King also extended the call for neighborly assistance to society at large:

===Catholic view===
Thomas Aquinas states that there are three points to be noted in this parable: Firstly, the manifold misery of sinners: &quot;A certain man went down from Jerusalem.&quot; Secondly, is shown the manifold pity of Christ to the sinner: &quot;A certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him he had compassion on him.&quot; Thirdly, the rule which is given for imitation: &quot;Go, and do thou likewise.&quot;

Justus Knecht gives the deeper interpretation of this parable, according to the Church Fathers, writing:

===Other interpretations===
In addition to these classical interpretations many scholars have drawn additional themes from the story. Some have suggested that religious tolerance was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.

Others have suggested that Jesus was attempting to convey an anti-establishment message, not necessarily in the sense of rejecting authority figures in general, but in the sense of rejecting religious hypocrisy. By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.

====Modern Jewish view====


The story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25–37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word &quot;neighbor&quot;, possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews—i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If &quot;Samaritan&quot; has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original &quot;Israelite&quot;, no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of love.

The term &quot;neighbor&quot; has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers. In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: &quot;Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: &#x27;Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.&#x27;&quot; Likewise in xxviii.: &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God&quot;; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn Ḥayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; Ḥayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his &quot;Sha&#x27;are Ḳedushah&quot;, i. 5; and Moses Ḥagis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner&#x27;s religious catechism, &quot;Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit&quot;, p. 258.

Accordingly, the synod at Leipzig in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, &quot;Ethics of Judaism&quot;, i. 234, 302) that Love thy neighbor as thyself&#x27; is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion&quot;; and , when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error.

==Authenticity==
The Jesus Seminar voted this parable to be authentic, with 60% of fellows rating it &quot;red&quot; (authentic) and a further 29% rating it &quot;pink&quot; (probably authentic). The paradox of a disliked outsider such as a Samaritan helping a Jew is typical of Jesus&#x27; provocative parables, and is a deliberate feature of this parable. In the Greek text, the shock value of the Samaritan&#x27;s appearance is enhanced by the emphatic at the beginning of the sentence in verse 33.

Bernard Brandon Scott, a member of the Jesus Seminar, questions the authenticity of the parable&#x27;s context, suggesting that &quot;the parable originally circulated separately from the question about neighborliness&quot; and that the &quot;existence of the lawyer&#x27;s question in Mark 12:28–34 and Matthew 22:34–40, in addition to the evidence of heavy Lukan editing&quot; indicates the parable and its context were &quot;very probably joined editorially by Luke.&quot; A number of other commentators share this opinion, with the consensus of the Jesus Seminar being that verses Luke 10:36–37 were added by Luke to &quot;connect with the lawyer&#x27;s question.&quot; On the other hand, the &quot;keen rabbinic interest in the question of the greatest commandment&quot; may make this argument invalid, in that Luke may be describing a different occurrence of the question being asked. Differences between the gospels suggest that Luke is referring to a different episode from Mark and Matthew, and Klyne Snodgrass writes that &quot;While one cannot exclude that Luke has joined two originally separate narratives, evidence for this is not convincing.&quot; The &quot;Oxford Bible Commentary&quot; notes:

The unexpected appearance of the Samaritan led Joseph Halévy to suggest that the parable originally involved &quot;a priest, a Levite, and an Israelite&quot;, in line with contemporary Jewish stories, and that Luke changed the parable to be more familiar to a gentile audience.&quot; Halévy further suggests that, in real life, it was unlikely that a Samaritan would actually have been found on the road between Jericho and Jerusalem, although others claim that there was &quot;nothing strange about a Samaritan travelling in Jewish territory&quot;. William C. Placher points out that such debate misinterprets the biblical genre of a parable, which illustrates a moral rather than a historical point: on reading the story, &quot;we are not inclined to check the story against the police blotter for the Jerusalem-Jericho highway patrol. We recognize that Jesus is telling a story to illustrate a moral point, and that such stories often don&#x27;t claim to correspond to actual events.&quot; The traditionally understood ethical moral of the story would not hold if the parable originally followed the priest-Levite-Israelite sequence of contemporary Jewish stories, as Halévy suggested, for then it would deal strictly with intra-Israelite relations just as did the Lev 19:18 command under discussion.

==As a metaphor and name==
The term &quot;good Samaritan&quot; is used as a common metaphor: &quot;The word now applies to any charitable person, especially one who, like the man in the parable, rescues or helps out a needy stranger.&quot;

The name has consequently been used for a number of charitable organizations, including Samaritans, Samaritan&#x27;s Purse, Sisters of the Good Samaritan, and The Samaritan Befrienders Hong Kong. The name Good Samaritan Hospital is used for a number of hospitals around the world. Good Samaritan laws protect those who choose to serve and tend to others who are injured or ill.

==Art and popular culture==
The parable of the Good Samaritan was one of the most popular in medieval art. The allegorical interpretation was often illustrated, with Christ as the Good Samaritan. Accompanying angels were sometimes also shown. In some Eastern Orthodox icons of the parable, the identification of the Good Samaritan as Christ is made explicit with a halo bearing a cross.

The numerous later artistic depictions of the parable include those of Rembrandt, Jan Wijnants, Vincent van Gogh, Aimé Morot, Domenico Fetti, Johann Carl Loth, George Frederic Watts, and Giacomo Conti. Vincent van Gogh&#x27;s painting captures the reverse hierarchy that is underscored in Luke&#x27;s parable. Although the priest and Levite are near the top of the status hierarchy in Israel and the Samaritans near the bottom, van Gogh reverses this hierarchy in the painting.

In his essay &quot;Lost in Non-Translation&quot;, biochemist and author Isaac Asimov argues that to the Jews of the time there were no good Samaritans; in his view, this was half the point of the parable. As Asimov put it, we need to think of the story occurring in Alabama in 1950, with a mayor and a preacher ignoring a man who has been beaten and robbed, with the role of the Samaritan being played by a poor black sharecropper.

The story&#x27;s theme is portrayed throughout &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Daredevil&quot;.

The parable of the Good Samaritan is the theme for the Austrian Christian Charity commemorative coin, minted 12 March 2003. This coin shows the Good Samaritan with the wounded man, on his horse, as he takes him to an inn for medical attention. An older coin with this theme is the American &quot;Good Samaritan Shilling&quot; of 1652.

Australian poet Henry Lawson wrote a poem on the parable (&quot;The Good Samaritan&quot;), of which the third stanza reads:
John Gardiner Calkins Brainard also wrote a poem on the theme.

Dramatic film adaptations of the Parable of the Good Samaritan include the short film &quot;Samaritan&quot; (2006), set in a modern context, per the literary device of the &quot;Modern Parables&quot; DVD Bible study series.

The English composer, Benjamin Britten, was commissioned to write a piece to mark the centenary of the Red Cross. His resulting work for solo voices, choir, and orchestra, Cantata Misericordium, sets a Latin text by Patrick Wilkinson that tells the parable of the Good Samaritan. It was first performed in Geneva in 1963.

In a real-life psychology experiment sometime before 1973, a number of seminary studentsin a rush to teach on this parablefailed to stop to help a shabbily dressed person on the side of the road.

== Legal presence ==
In the English law of negligence, when establishing a duty of care in &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; Lord Atkin applied the neighbour principle—drawing inspiration from the Biblical Golden Rule as in the parable of the Good Samaritan.

<text>Thomas Banks (29 December 1735 – 2 February 1805) was an 18th-century English sculptor.

==Life==

The son of William Banks, a surveyor who was land steward to the Duke of Beaufort, he was born in London. He was educated at Ross-on-Wye. Banks was taught drawing by his father, and from 1750 to 1756 was apprenticed to a woodcarver, William Barlow, in London. In his spare time he worked at sculpture, spending his evenings in the studio of the Flemish émigré sculptor Peter Scheemakers. During this period he is known to have worked for the architect William Kent. Before 1772, when he obtained a travelling studentship given by the Royal Academy and proceeded to Rome, he had already exhibited several fine works.

Returning to England in 1779 Banks found that the taste for classical poetry, long the source of his inspiration, no longer existed, and he spent two years in Saint Petersburg, being employed by Catherine the Great, who purchased his &quot;Cupid Tormenting a Butterfly&quot;. On his return to England he modelled his colossal &quot;Achilles Mourning the Loss of Briseis&quot;, a work full of force and passion. He was elected, in 1784, an associate of the Royal Academy and in the following year became a full member.

Banks died in London on 2 February 1805. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary on Paddington Green Church. A plaque to his memory was also erected in Westminster Abbey.

==Works==
Among other works in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral by Banks are the monuments to Captain George Blagden Westcott and Captain Richard Rundle Burges, and in Westminster Abbey to Sir Eyre Coote, General Loten, Sir Clifton Wintringham and William Woollett. His bronze bust of Warren Hastings is in the National Portrait Gallery.

Banks&#x27;s best-known work is perhaps the colossal group of &quot;Shakespeare Attended by Painting and Poetry&quot;, which since 1871 has been placed in the garden of New Place, Stratford-upon-Avon. The high-relief sculpture was completed in 1789 for a recess in the upper façade of John Boydell&#x27;s new Shakespeare Gallery in Pall Mall. Banks was paid 500 guineas for the group which depicts Shakespeare, reclining against a rock, between the Dramatic Muse and the Genius of Painting. Beneath it was panelled pedestal inscribed &quot;He was a Man, take him for all in all, I shall not look upon his like again&quot;. The sculpture remained in Pall Mall until the building was demolished in 1868 or 1869, when it was moved to New Place.

One of his most bizarre works is the 1801 &quot;Anatomical Crucifixion&quot;, a dissected body nailed to a cross, in the Hunterian Museum in London.

<doc id="149953" wikidata="Q1247496" url="?curid=149953" title="Rievaulx Abbey">
<text>Rievaulx Abbey ( ) was a Cistercian abbey in Rievaulx, near Helmsley, in the North York Moors National Park, North Yorkshire, England. It was one of the great abbeys in England until it was seized in 1538 under Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The wider site was awarded Scheduled Ancient Monument status in 1915 and the abbey was brought into the care of the then Ministry of Works in 1917. The ruins of its main buildings are today a tourist attraction, owned and maintained by English Heritage.

==Foundation==

Rievaulx Abbey was the first Cistercian monastery in the north of England, founded in 1132 by twelve monks from Clairvaux Abbey.

Its remote location was well suited to the order&#x27;s ideal of a strict life of prayer and self-sufficiency with little contact with the outside world. The abbey&#x27;s patron, Walter Espec, also founded another Cistercian community, that of Wardon Abbey in Bedfordshire, on unprofitable wasteland on one of his inherited estates.

William I, the first abbot of Rievaulx, started construction in the 1130s. The second abbot, Saint Aelred of Rievaulx, expanded the buildings and otherwise consolidated the existence of what in time became one of the great Cistercian abbeys of Yorkshire, with Fountains Abbey the second only Cistercian house to be built in Yorkshire. Under Aelred the abbey is said to have grown to some 140 monks and 500 lay brothers. By the end of his tenure Rievaulx had five daughter houses in England and Scotland.

==Financial prosperity==
The abbey lies in a wooded dale by the River Rye, sheltered by hills. The monks diverted part of the river several yards to the west in order to have enough flat land to build on. They altered the course of the river twice more during the 12th century. The old course is visible in the grounds of the abbey. This is an illustration of the technical ingenuity of the monks, who over time built up a profitable business mining lead and iron ore, rearing sheep and selling wool to buyers from all over Europe. Rievaulx Abbey became one of the greatest and wealthiest in England, with 140 monks and many more lay brothers. It received grants of land totalling and established daughter houses in England and Scotland.

By the end of the 13th century the abbey had incurred debts on its building projects and lost revenue owing to an epidemic of sheep scab (psoroptic mange). The ill fortune was compounded by raiders from Scotland in the early 14th century. The great reduction in population caused by the Black Death in the mid-14th century made it difficult to recruit new lay brothers for manual labour. As a result the abbey was forced to lease much of its land. By 1381 there were only fourteen choir monks, three lay brothers and the abbot left at Rievaulx, and some buildings were reduced in size.

By the 15th century the Cistercian practices of strict observance according to the Rule of Saint Benedict had been abandoned in favour of a more comfortable lifestyle. The monks were permitted to eat meat, more private living accommodation was created for them and the abbot had a substantial private household in what had once been the infirmary.

==Dissolution==

The abbey was a troubling one for the authorities. Edward Cowper led the monks beginning in 1530, but the monks objected to his style. He was ejected in 1533 and initially the monks refused a replacement.

At the time of its dissolution in 1538 the abbey was said to consist of 72 buildings occupied by the abbot and 21 monks, with 102 lay employees and an income of £351 a year. The abbey owned a prototype blast furnace at Laskill, producing cast iron as efficiently as a modern blast furnace.

As was standard procedure, the confiscated monastic buildings were rendered uninhabitable and stripped of valuables such as lead. The site was granted to Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, one of Henry&#x27;s advisers, until it passed to the Duncombe family.

== Post-monastic era ==
In the later 16th and 17th centuries Rievaulx was an important iron-manufacturing site.

In the 1750s the then owner, Thomas Duncombe III, beautified his estate by building a terraced walk along the valley top overlooking the abbey from where the picturesque qualities of the ruins and the wider landscape could be enjoyed. It features two Grecian-style temples. They are in the care of the National Trust. The abbey ruins are in the care of English Heritage.

In the 1920s, the then-owner of the abbey donated lead, which had been stripped from its windows after the Dissolution and stored away, for the restoration of York Minster&#x27;s Five Sisters window, which had been removed for safety during the First World War.

In the 20th century the abbey became a historic monument in the care of the State and is now managed by the English Heritage Trust.

In 2015 Historic England commissioned an archaeological survey and investigation of the abbey precinct using low-level aerial photography to make a digital surface model and an earthwork plan. This was followed by a ground-based survey in 2018. The aim of the project was to develop a better understanding of the landscape surrounding the abbey and was published in 2019.

When awarded a life peerage in 1983, former prime minister Harold Wilson, a Yorkshireman, adopted the title Baron Wilson of Rievaulx.

<text>George Bannatyne (1545–1608), a native of Angus, Scotland, was an Edinburgh merchant and burgess. He was the seventh of twenty-three children, including Catherine Bannatyne, born of James Bannatyne of Kirktown of Newtyle in Forfarshire and Katherine Tailefer. He is most famous as a collector of Scottish poems. He compiled an anthology of Scots poetry while in isolation during a plague in 1568. His work extended to eight hundred folio pages, divided into five parts. The anthology includes works from Scottish Chaucerians as well as many anonymous writers.

==The Bannatyne manuscript==
Bannatyne began compiling his manuscript in 1568 while isolated in his home in Edinburgh during an outbreak of the plague. He was inspired to create the anthology as a means to preserve Scottish Literary heritage.

The Bannatyne Manuscript is, with the Asloan and Maitland manuscripts, one of the great sources of Middle Scots literature. It contains many works by Henryson, Dunbar, Lyndsay, Alexander Scott and Alexander Montgomerie.

The document was passed by Bannatyne to his descendants, Janet and her husband George Foulis of Woodhall and Ravelston, and then, via several private owners, to the Advocates&#x27; Library of Edinburgh. It is now held by the National Library of Scotland.

== The Bannatyne Club ==
The Bannatyne Club was founded by Sir Walter Scott in honour of George Bannatyne for the purpose of promoting and studying Scottish history and literature.

==Recent Scholarship==
More recent scholarship on the Bannatyne Manuscript suggests an earlier date of 1565 for its composition. 9A. A. MacDonald, &#x27;The Bannatyne Manuscript: a Marian Anthology&#x27;, &quot;IR&quot; xxxvii (1986), 36–47) demonstrate this and Michael Lynch points out that its compilation at this time was appropriate given that it contains a great deal of love poetry and was put together at the time of the royal marriage between Mary I and Lord Darnley. Lynch, M. A &quot;New History of Scotland&quot;, Pimlico, 1991, p. 213.

<text>Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown (born c. 1715–16, baptised 30 August 1716 – 6 February 1783) was an English gardener and landscape architect, a notable figure in the history of the English landscape garden style.

Unlike other architects including William Kent, he was a hands-on gardener and provided his clients with a full turnkey service, designing the gardens and park, and then managing their landscaping and planting. He is most famous for the landscaped parks of English country houses, many of which have survived reasonably intact. However, he also included in his plans &quot;pleasure gardens&quot; with flower gardens and the new shrubberies, usually placed where they would not obstruct the views across the park of and from the main facades of the house. Few of his plantings of &quot;pleasure gardens&quot; have survived later changes. He also submitted plans for much smaller urban projects, for example the college gardens along The Backs at Cambridge.

Criticism of his style, both in his own day and subsequently, mostly centres on the claim that &quot;he created &#x27;identikit&#x27; landscapes with the main house in a sea of turf, some water, albeit often an impressive feature, and trees in clumps and shelterbelts&quot;, giving &quot;a uniformity equating to authoritarianism&quot; and showing a lack of imagination and even taste on the part of his patrons.

He designed more than 170 parks, many of which survive. He was nicknamed &quot;Capability&quot; because he would tell his clients that their property had &quot;capability&quot; for improvement. His influence was so great that the contributions to the English garden made by his predecessors Charles Bridgeman and William Kent are often overlooked; even Kent&#x27;s champion Horace Walpole allowed that Kent &quot;was succeeded by a very able master&quot;.

==Early life and Stowe==
Lancelot Brown was the fifth child of a land agent and a chambermaid, born in the village of Kirkharle, Northumberland, and educated at a school in Cambo until he was 16. Brown&#x27;s father, William Brown, had been Sir William Loraine’s land agent and his mother, Ursula (née Hall), had been in service at Kirkharle Hall. His eldest brother, John, became the estate surveyor and later married Sir William&#x27;s daughter. His older brother George became a mason-architect.

After school Lancelot worked as the head gardener&#x27;s apprentice at Sir William Loraine&#x27;s kitchen garden at Kirkharle Hall until he was 23. In 1739 he journeyed south to the port of Boston, Lincolnshire. Then he moved further inland, where his first landscape commission was for a new lake in the park at Kiddington Hall, Oxfordshire. He moved to Wotton Underwood House, Buckinghamshire, seat of Sir Richard Grenville.
In 1741 Brown joined Lord Cobham&#x27;s gardening staff as undergardener at Stowe Gardens, Buckinghamshire, where he worked under William Kent, one of the founders of the new English style of landscape garden. In 1742, at the age of 26, he was officially appointed Head Gardener, earning £25 () a year and residing in the western Boycott Pavilion.

Brown remained at Stowe until 1750. He made the Grecian Valley at Stowe under William Kent&#x27;s supervision. It is an abstract composition of landform and woodland. Lord Cobham let Brown take freelance work from his aristocratic friends, thus making him well known as a landscape gardener. As a proponent of the new English style Brown became immensely sought after by the landed families. By 1751, when Brown was beginning to be widely known, Horace Walpole wrote somewhat slightingly of Brown&#x27;s work at Warwick Castle:

The castle is enchanting; the view pleased me more than I can express, the River Avon tumbles down a cascade at the foot of it. It is well laid out by one Brown who has set up on a few ideas of Kent and Mr. Southcote.
By the 1760s he was earning on average £6,000 () a year, usually £500 () for one commission. As an accomplished rider he was able to work fast, taking only an hour or so on horseback to survey an estate and rough out an entire design. In 1764, Brown was appointed George III&#x27;s Master Gardener at Hampton Court Palace, succeeding John Greening and residing at the Wilderness House. In 1767 he bought an estate for himself at Fenstanton in Huntingdonshire from Spencer Compton, 8th Earl of Northampton and was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1770, although his son Lance carried out most of the duties.

==Landscape gardens==
It is estimated that Brown was responsible for more than 170 gardens surrounding the finest country houses and estates in Britain. His work endures at Belvoir Castle, Croome Court (where he also designed the house), Blenheim Palace, Warwick Castle, Harewood House, Chatsworth, Highclere Castle, Appuldurcombe House, Milton Abbey (and nearby Milton Abbas village) and in traces at Kew Gardens and many other locations. 

His style of smooth undulating grass, which would run straight to the house, clumps, belts and scatterings of trees and his serpentine lakes formed by invisibly damming small rivers were a new style within the English landscape, a &#x27;gardenless&#x27; form of landscape gardening, which swept away almost all the remnants of previous formally patterned styles.

His landscapes were at the forefront of fashion. They were fundamentally different from what they replaced, the well-known formal gardens of England which were criticised by Alexander Pope and others from the 1710s. Starting in 1719, William Kent replaced these with more naturalistic compositions, which reached their greatest refinement in Brown&#x27;s landscapes.

At Hampton Court Brown encountered Hannah More in 1782 and she described his &quot;grammatical&quot; manner in her literary terms: Now there&#x27; said he, pointing his finger, &#x27;I make a comma, and there&#x27; pointing to another spot, &#x27;where a more decided turn is proper, I make a colon; at another part, where an interruption is desirable to break the view, a parenthesis; now a full stop, and then I begin another subject. Brown&#x27;s patrons saw the idealised landscapes he was creating for them in terms of the Italian landscape painters they admired and collected, as Kenneth Woodbridge first observed in the landscape at Stourhead, a &quot;Brownian&quot; landscape (with an un-Brownian circuit walk) in which Brown himself was not involved.

===Criticism===
Perhaps Brown&#x27;s sternest critic was his contemporary Uvedale Price, who likened Brown&#x27;s clumps of trees to &quot;so many puddings turned out of one common mould.&quot; Russell Page, who began his career in the Brownian landscape of Longleat but whose own designs have formal structure, accused Brown of &quot;encouraging his wealthy clients to tear out their splendid formal gardens and replace them with his facile compositions of grass, tree clumps and rather shapeless pools and lakes.&quot;

Richard Owen Cambridge, the English poet and satirical author, declared that he hoped to die before Brown so that he could &quot;see heaven before it was &#x27;improved&#x27;.&quot; This was a typical statement reflecting the controversy about Brown&#x27;s work, which has continued over the last 200 years. By contrast, a recent historian and author, Richard Bisgrove, described Brown&#x27;s process as perfecting nature by &quot;judicious manipulation of its components, adding a tree here or a concealed head of water there. His art attended to the formal potential of ground, water, trees and so gave to English landscape its ideal forms. The difficulty was that less capable imitators and less sophisticated spectators did not see nature perfected... they saw simply what they took to be nature.&quot;

This deftness of touch was recognised in his own day; one anonymous obituary writer opined: &quot;Such, however, was the effect of his genius that when he was the happiest man, he will be least remembered; so closely did he copy nature that his works will be mistaken.&quot; In 1772, Sir William Chambers (though he did not mention Brown by name) complained that the &quot;new manner&quot; of gardens &quot;differ very little from common fields, so closely is vulgar nature copied in most of them.&quot;

==Architecture==
Capability Brown produced more than 100 architectural drawings, and his work in the field of architecture was a natural outgrowth of his unified picture of the English country house in its setting:
&quot;In Brown&#x27;s hands the house, which before had dominated the estate, became an integral part of a carefully composed landscape intended to be seen through the eye of a painter, and its design could not be divorced from that of the garden&quot;
Humphry Repton observed that Brown &quot;fancied himself an architect&quot;, but Brown&#x27;s work as an architect is overshadowed by his great reputation as a designer of landscapes. Repton was bound to add: &quot;he was inferior to none in what related to the comfort, convenience, taste and propriety of design, in the several mansions and other buildings which he planned&quot;. Brown&#x27;s first country house project was the remodelling of Croome Court, Worcestershire, (1751–52) for the 6th Earl of Coventry, in which instance he was likely following sketches by the gentleman amateur Sanderson Miller.

Fisherwick, Staffordshire, Redgrave Hall, Suffolk, and Claremont, Surrey, were classical, while at Corsham his outbuildings are in a Gothic vein, including the bathhouse. Gothic stable blocks and decorative outbuildings, arches and garden features constituted many of his designs. From 1771 he was assisted in the technical aspects by the master builder Henry Holland, and by Henry&#x27;s son Henry Holland the architect, whose initial career Brown supported; the younger Holland was increasingly Brown&#x27;s full collaborator and became Brown&#x27;s son-in-law in 1773.

==Subsequent reputation==

Brown&#x27;s reputation declined rapidly after his death, because the English landscape style did not convey the dramatic conflict and awesome power of wild nature. A reaction against the harmony and calmness of Brown&#x27;s landscapes was inevitable; the landscapes lacked the sublime thrill which members of the Romantic generation (such as Richard Payne Knight and Uvedale Price) looked for in their ideal landscape, where the painterly inspiration would come from Salvator Rosa rather than Claude Lorrain.

During the 19th century he was widely criticised, but during the twentieth century his reputation rose again. Tom Turner has suggested that the latter resulted from a favourable account of his talent in Marie-Luise Gothein&#x27;s &quot;History of Garden Art&quot; which predated Christopher Hussey&#x27;s positive account of Brown in &quot;The Picturesque&quot; (1927). Dorothy Stroud wrote the first full monograph on Capability Brown, fleshing out the generic attributions with documentation from country house estate offices.

Later landscape architects like William Sawrey Gilpin would opine that Brown&#x27;s &#x27;natural curves&#x27; were as artificial as the straight lines that were common in French gardens. Brown&#x27;s portrait by Nathaniel Dance, c. 1773, is conserved in the National Portrait Gallery, London. His work has often been favourably compared and contrasted (&quot;the antithesis&quot;) to the œuvre of André Le Nôtre, the French &quot;jardin à la française&quot; landscape architect. He became both &quot;rich and honoured and had &#x27;improved&#x27; a greater acreage of ground than any landscape architect&quot; who preceded him.

A festival to celebrate the tercentenary of Brown&#x27;s birth was held in 2016. The published a large amount of new research on Brown&#x27;s work and held over 500 events across Britain as part of the celebrations. Royal Mail issued a series of Landscape Stamps in his honour in August 2016.

The Gardens Trust with support from Historic England, published &quot;Vulnerability Brown: Capability Brown landscapes at risk&quot; in October 2017 to review the issues facing the survival of these landscapes as well as suggested solutions.

A commemorative fountain in Westminster Abbey’s cloister garth was dedicated for Lancelot ‘Capability’ Brown after Evensong on Tuesday 29 May 2018 by the Dean of Westminster, Dr John Hall. The fountain sits over an old monastic well in the garth. It was designed by Ptolemy Dean, the Abbey&#x27;s Surveyor of the Fabric, and was developed with the assistance of gardener Alan Titchmarsh. The fountain was made in lead by sculptor Brian Turner.

==Personal life==

On 22 November 1744 he married Bridget Wayet (affectionately called Biddy) from Boston, Lincolnshire, in Stowe parish church. Her father was an alderman and landowner while her family had surveyors and engineers among its members. They had eight children: Bridget in 1746, Lancelot (known as Lance), William (who died young), John in 1751, a son in 1754 who died shortly afterwards, Anne who was born and died in 1756, Margaret (known as Peggy) in 1758 and Thomas in 1761.

In 1768 he purchased the manor of Fenstanton in Huntingdonshire in East Anglia for £13,000 () from Lord Northampton. This came with two manor houses, two villages and 2,668 acres of land. The property stayed in the family until it was sold in lots in 1870s and 1880s. Ownership of the property allowed him to stand for and serve as High sheriff of Huntingdonshire from 1770 to 1771. He continued to work and travel until his sudden collapse and death on 6 February 1783, on the doorstep of his daughter Bridget Holland&#x27;s house, at 6 Hertford Street, London while returning after a night out at Lord Coventry&#x27;s.

Horace Walpole wrote to Lady Ossory: &quot;Your dryads must go into black gloves, Madam, their father-in-law, Lady Nature’s second husband, is dead!&quot;. Brown was buried in the churchyard of St. Peter and St. Paul, the parish church of Brown&#x27;s small estate at Fenstanton Manor. He left an estate of approximately £40,000 (), which included property in Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire. His eldest daughter Bridget married the architect Henry Holland. Brown sent two of his sons to Eton. One of them, Lancelot Brown the younger, became the MP for Huntingdon. His son John joined the Royal Navy and rose to become an admiral.

<text>A sidearm is an individual-served weapon that is kept at one&#x27;s side and can be rapidly accessed if needed. A sidearm may be carried alone or as an ancillary weapon to a more frequently-used primary weapon. The term historically referred to swords, daggers, and similar small weapons kept at one&#x27;s side in a sheath, and in modern combat dominated by guns, sidearms are often defined as handguns that are similarly kept in a holster.

A sidearm is typically required equipment for military officers and may be carried by law enforcement personnel. Usually, uniformed personnel of these services wear their weapons openly, while plainclothes personnel have their sidearms concealed under their clothes.

== Uses ==

In many contemporary armies, the issue of a sidearm in the form of a service pistol is a clear sign of authority and is the mark of a commissioned officer or senior NCO. In the protocol of courtesy, the surrender of a commander&#x27;s sidearm is the final act in the general surrender of a unit. If no ill will is meant, and a strict interpretation of military courtesy is applied, a surrendering commander may be allowed to keep their sidearm in order to exercise their right of command over their men.

An important purpose of the sidearm is to be used if the primary weapon is not available (damaged or lost), if it has run out of ammunition, or if it malfunctions. Many soldiers armed with a long gun such as a rifle or submachine gun may also have a semi-automatic pistol as a sidearm. Personal defense weapons are often issued as personal sidearms to combat personnel who operate in cramped spaces in which a rifle or carbine would be impractical, such as truck drivers, helicopter pilots, and vehicle crews.

<text>A framebuffer (frame buffer, or sometimes framestore) is a portion of random-access memory (RAM) containing a bitmap that drives a video display. It is a memory buffer containing data representing all the pixels in a complete video frame. Modern video cards contain framebuffer circuitry in their cores. This circuitry converts an in-memory bitmap into a video signal that can be displayed on a computer monitor.

In computing, a screen buffer is a part of computer memory used by a computer application for the representation of the content to be shown on the computer display. The screen buffer may also be called the video buffer, the regeneration buffer, or regen buffer for short. Screen buffers should be distinguished from video memory. To this end, the term off-screen buffer is also used.

The information in the buffer typically consists of color values for every pixel to be shown on the display. Color values are commonly stored in 1-bit binary (monochrome), 4-bit palettized, 8-bit palettized, 16-bit high color and 24-bit true color formats. An additional alpha channel is sometimes used to retain information about pixel transparency. The total amount of memory required for the framebuffer depends on the resolution of the output signal, and on the color depth or palette size.

== History ==

Computer researchers had long discussed the theoretical advantages of a framebuffer but were unable to produce a machine with sufficient memory at an economically practicable cost. In 1947, the Manchester Baby computer used a Williams tube, later the Williams-Kilburn tube, to store 1024 bits on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) memory and displayed on a second CRT. Other research labs were exploring these techniques with MIT Lincoln Laboratory achieving a 4096 display in 1950.

A color scanned display was implemented in the late 1960s, called the Brookhaven RAster Display (BRAD), which used a drum memory and a television monitor. In 1969, A. Michael Noll of Bell Labs implemented a scanned display with a frame buffer, using magnetic-core memory. Later on, the Bell Labs system was expanded to display an image with a color depth of three bits on a standard color TV monitor.

In the early 1970s, the development of MOS memory (metal–oxide–semiconductor memory) integrated-circuit chips, particularly high-density DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) chips with at least 1kb memory, made it practical to create, for the first time, a digital memory system with framebuffers capable of holding a standard video image. This led to the development of the SuperPaint system by Richard Shoup at Xerox PARC in 1972. Shoup was able to use the SuperPaint framebuffer to create an early digital video-capture system. By synchronizing the output signal to the input signal, Shoup was able to overwrite each pixel of data as it shifted in. Shoup also experimented with modifying the output signal using color tables. These color tables allowed the SuperPaint system to produce a wide variety of colors outside the range of the limited 8-bit data it contained. This scheme would later become commonplace in computer framebuffers.

In 1974, Evans &amp; Sutherland released the first commercial framebuffer, the Picture System, costing about $15,000. It was capable of producing resolutions of up to 512 by 512 pixels in 8-bit grayscale, and became a boon for graphics researchers who did not have the resources to build their own framebuffer. The New York Institute of Technology would later create the first 24-bit color system using three of the Evans &amp; Sutherland framebuffers. Each framebuffer was connected to an RGB color output (one for red, one for green and one for blue), with a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP 11/04 minicomputer controlling the three devices as one.

In 1975, the UK company Quantel produced the first commercial full-color broadcast framebuffer, the Quantel DFS 3000. It was first used in TV coverage of the 1976 Montreal Olympics to generate a picture-in-picture inset of the Olympic flaming torch while the rest of the picture featured the runner entering the stadium.

The rapid improvement of integrated-circuit technology made it possible for many of the home computers of the late 1970s to contain low-color-depth framebuffers. Today, nearly all computers with graphical capabilities utilize a framebuffer for generating the video signal. Amiga computers, created in the 1980s, featured special design attention to graphics performance and included a unique Hold-And-Modify framebuffer capable of displaying 4096 colors.

Framebuffers also became popular in high-end workstations and arcade system boards throughout the 1980s. SGI, Sun Microsystems, HP, DEC and IBM all released framebuffers for their workstation computers in this period. These framebuffers were usually of a much higher quality than could be found in most home computers, and were regularly used in television, printing, computer modeling and 3D graphics. Framebuffers were also used by Sega for its high-end arcade boards, which were also of a higher quality than on home computers.

== Display modes ==

Framebuffers used in personal and home computing often had sets of defined &quot;modes&quot; under which the framebuffer can operate. These modes reconfigure the hardware to output different resolutions, color depths, memory layouts and refresh rate timings.

In the world of Unix machines and operating systems, such conveniences were usually eschewed in favor of directly manipulating the hardware settings. This manipulation was far more flexible in that any resolution, color depth and refresh rate was attainable – limited only by the memory available to the framebuffer.

An unfortunate side-effect of this method was that the display device could be driven beyond its capabilities. In some cases, this resulted in hardware damage to the display. More commonly, it simply produced garbled and unusable output. Modern CRT monitors fix this problem through the introduction of protection circuitry. When the display mode is changed, the monitor attempts to obtain a signal lock on the new refresh frequency. If the monitor is unable to obtain a signal lock, or if the signal is outside the range of its design limitations, the monitor will ignore the framebuffer signal and possibly present the user with an error message.

LCD monitors tend to contain similar protection circuitry, but for different reasons. Since the LCD must digitally sample the display signal (thereby emulating an electron beam), any signal that is out of range cannot be physically displayed on the monitor.

== Color palette ==
Framebuffers have traditionally supported a wide variety of color modes. Due to the expense of memory, most early framebuffers used 1-bit (2 colors per pixel), 2-bit (4 colors), 4-bit (16 colors) or 8-bit (256 colors) color depths. The problem with such small color depths is that a full range of colors cannot be produced. The solution to this problem was indexed color, which adds a lookup table to the framebuffer. Each color stored in framebuffer memory acts as a color index. The lookup table serves as a palette with a limited number of different colors, while the rest is used as an index table.

Here is a typical indexed 256-color image and its own palette (shown as a rectangle of swatches):

In some designs it was also possible to write data to the lookup table (or switch between existing palettes) on the fly, allowing dividing the picture into horizontal bars with their own palette and thus render an image that had a far wider palette. For example, viewing an outdoor shot photograph, the picture could be divided into four bars, the top one with emphasis on sky tones, the next with foliage tones, the next with skin and clothing tones, and the bottom one with ground colors. This required each palette to have overlapping colors, but carefully done, allowed great flexibility.

== Memory access ==
While framebuffers are commonly accessed via a memory mapping directly to the CPU memory space, this is not the only method by which they may be accessed. Framebuffers have varied widely in the methods used to access memory. Some of the most common are:
* Mapping the entire framebuffer to a given memory range.
* Port commands to set each pixel, range of pixels or palette entry.
* Mapping a memory range smaller than the framebuffer memory, then bank switching as necessary.

The framebuffer organization may be packed pixel or planar. The framebuffer may be all points addressable or have restrictions on how it can be updated.

== RAM on the video card ==

Video cards always have a certain amount of RAM. A small portion of this RAM is where the bitmap of image data is &quot;buffered&quot; for display. The term &quot;frame buffer&quot; is thus often used interchangeably when referring to this RAM.

The CPU sends image updates to the video card. The video processor on the card forms a picture of the screen image and stores it in the frame buffer as a large bitmap in RAM. The bitmap in RAM is used by the card to continually refresh the screen image.

== Virtual framebuffers ==
Many systems attempt to emulate the function of a framebuffer device, often for reasons of compatibility. The two most common virtual framebuffers are the Linux framebuffer device (fbdev) and the X Virtual Framebuffer (Xvfb). Xvfb was added to the X Window System distribution to provide a method for running X without a graphical framebuffer. The Linux framebuffer device was developed to abstract the physical method for accessing the underlying framebuffer into a guaranteed memory map that is easy for programs to access. This increases portability, as programs are not required to deal with systems that have disjointed memory maps or require bank switching.

== Page flipping ==
A frame buffer may be designed with enough memory to store two frames worth of video data. In a technique known generally as double buffering or more specifically as page flipping, the framebuffer uses half of its memory to display the current frame. While that memory is being displayed, the other half of memory is filled with data for the next frame. Once the secondary buffer is filled, the framebuffer is instructed to display the secondary buffer instead. The primary buffer becomes the secondary buffer, and the secondary buffer becomes the primary. This switch is often done after the vertical blanking interval to avoid screen tearing where half the old frame and half the new frame is shown together.

Page flipping has become a standard technique used by PC game programmers.

== Graphics accelerators ==
As the demand for better graphics increased, hardware manufacturers created a way to decrease the amount of CPU time required to fill the framebuffer. This is commonly called &quot;graphics acceleration&quot;. Common graphics drawing commands (many of them geometric) are sent to the graphics accelerator in their raw form. The accelerator then rasterizes the results of the command to the framebuffer. This method frees the CPU to do other work.

Early accelerators focused on improving the performance of 2D GUI systems. While retaining these 2D capabilities, most modern accelerators focus on producing 3D imagery in real time. A common design uses a graphics library such as OpenGL or Direct3D which interfaces with the graphics driver to translate received commands to instructions for the accelerator&#x27;s graphics processing unit (GPU). The GPU uses those instructions to compute the rasterized results and the results are bit blitted to the framebuffer. The framebuffer&#x27;s signal is then produced in combination with built-in video overlay devices (usually used to produce the mouse cursor without modifying the framebuffer&#x27;s data) and any final special effects that are produced by modifying the output signal. An example of such final special effects was the spatial anti-aliasing technique used by the 3dfx Voodoo cards. These cards add a slight blur to the output signal that makes aliasing of the rasterized graphics much less obvious.

At one time there were many manufacturers of graphics accelerators, including: 3dfx Interactive; ATI; Hercules; Trident; Nvidia; Radius; S3 Graphics; SiS and Silicon Graphics. the market for graphics accelerators for x86-based systems is dominated by Nvidia (acquired 3dfx in 2002), AMD (who acquired ATI in 2006), and Intel.

==Comparisons==
With a framebuffer, the electron beam (if the display technology uses one) is commanded to perform a raster scan, the way a television renders a broadcast signal. The color information for each point thus displayed on the screen is pulled directly from the framebuffer during the scan, creating a set of discrete picture elements, i.e. pixels.

Framebuffers differ significantly from the vector displays that were common prior to the advent of raster graphics (and, consequently, to the concept of a framebuffer). With a vector display, only the vertices of the graphics primitives are stored. The electron beam of the output display is then commanded to move from vertex to vertex, tracing a line across the area between these points.

Likewise, framebuffers differ from the technology used in early text mode displays, where a buffer holds codes for characters, not individual pixels. The video display device performs the same raster scan as with a framebuffer but generates the pixels of each character in the buffer as it directs the beam.

<text>Charles Bannister (1738–1804) was an English actor, comedian and singer.

==Origins and debut==
Bannister was born in Gloucestershire. When he was seven his father moved to Deptford. He was possessed of &#x27;a manly form, an ardent mind, and an uncommon flow of wit.&#x27; He a company of players who visited his neighbourhood, and aspired to their profession. At 18 he made amateur appearances in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot; in Deptford. Drury Lane turned him down, but after successful work in Norwich, Ipswich and other eastern towns, Samuel Foote gave him his first London appearance in 1762 at the Haymarket Theatre, as Will Tirehack in &quot;The Orators&quot;, opposite John Palmer as Harry Scamper, who also made his debut on that occasion. Bannister remained Palmer&#x27;s friend thereafter with &#x27;manly firmness and immoveable constancy&#x27;. Long afterwards, in June 1787, Palmer as manager of the Royalty Theatre attempted to present dramatic works (including &quot;As You Like It&quot;), and then other lighter entertainments of the stage, with the encouragement of Arthur Murphy, contrary to Statute. Bannister, even after the legal danger was apparent, remained with him, and was committed for trial, though the warrant was superseded.

==His career in opera==
His skills, especially in comedy and mimicry, were quickly recognised, but the fine singing voice on which his later reputation stood was not at first in evidence. Bannister was untutored as a singer, but possessed a natural voice which united &#x27;in extraordinary perfection the extremes of a deep bass and high-toned falsetto: and his ear, which was of great delicacy and perfection, enabled him to execute not only pieces of ordinary description, but to represent, with great humour, and without the grossness of burlesque or caricature, many leading performers of the day, both male and female.&#x27; William Parke noted that &#x27;Bannister, who never sang out of time or out of tune, did not know one note of music. He had his songs, &amp;c., paroted to him by a worthy friend of mine, Mr Griffith Jones, who was at that time pianist to Covent Garden Theatre.&#x27;

In 1772 it was reported that Jane Poitier, an actress who worked in the same summer company as Bannister from 1770 to 1774, was his mistress.

===Dibdin opera roles===
Bannister built on his reputation as a singer at Ranelagh Gardens not least through the early successful operas of Charles Dibdin, with which he became specially identified. In 1768 he was in &quot;Damon and Phillida&quot;, and &quot;The Padlock&quot;. In 1774 he was the original Tom Tug in Dibdin&#x27;s lasting work, &quot;The Waterman&quot;, at its first presentation at the Haymarket. He appeared in the first production of &quot;The Cobbler&quot;, and in 1777 was the first Mr. Steady in &quot;The Quaker&quot; at Drury Lane. &#x27;Steady, in &quot;The Quaker&quot;, has never, except in him, found an adequate representative.&#x27; He was in the premiere of &quot;The Chelsea Pensioner&quot; in 1779, and was Sergeant (opposite Charles Dibdin as Countryman, and Mrs Wrighten as Wife) in Dibdin and Isaac Bickerstaffe&#x27;s musical entertainment of &quot;The Recruiting Serjeant&quot; at the Royalty Theatre in 1789. As Tom Tug, Mr Steady and the Recruiting Serjeant he was succeeded (at Covent Garden) by Charles Incledon, and by Charles Dignum, who were his friends, and adopted them for tenor voice instead of bass or baritone.

In December 1776 he brought &#x27;his fine rich and mellow bass voice&#x27; to the two-act opera &quot;Zelima and Azore&quot; (composed by Thomas Linley and the orchestra led by Linley&#x27;s son Thomas, fresh from his studies with Tartini), opposite Vernon, Dodd, and Mrs. Baddely. This was shortly before the premiere of &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; in 1777: and in October 1778 Bannister had the role of Serjeant Drill in the elder Linley&#x27;s two-act musical drama &quot;The Camp&quot; (after Sheridan), with the recruiting song &quot;Great Caesar, once renown&#x27;d in fame&quot;.

===Shield opera premieres===
Bannister played in the first productions of several of his friend William Shield&#x27;s operas, from his early success &quot;The Flitch of Bacon&quot; at the Little Theatre, Haymarket (as Captain Wilson) in 1778, through many of his later Covent Garden successes. He was the first Mr Belville in Shield&#x27;s &quot;Rosina&quot; (text by Mrs Brooke) in 1782–83, in which Mrs Bannister also appeared: his song &quot;Her mouth, when a smile&quot; stuck in his personal repertoire. In 1783 he was Captain Fitzroy in Shield&#x27;s &quot;The Poor Soldier&quot;. In 1784 &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (text: MacNally) gave Mrs Bannister an air &quot;The Nightingale&quot; with oboe obbligato for Parke jnr., and to Charles Bannister the song &quot;As burns the charger&quot; with trumpet accompaniment. Bannister and &#x27;Jack&#x27; Johnstone&#x27;s duet &quot;How sweet in the woodlands&quot; was richly encored. Parke recalled Bannister singing in Shield&#x27;s &quot;Fontainbleau, or, Our Way in France&quot; in 1784, and how he and Johnstone sang duets at a dinner held by Shield soon afterwards. Bannister was also in first performances of Shield&#x27;s &quot;The Farmer&quot; (1787), &quot;The Highland Reel&quot; (1788) &quot;The Crusade&quot; and &quot;The Czar&quot; (both 1790), and &quot;The Woodman&quot; (1791), in the latter with both Johnstone and Incledon.

At Covent Garden a new comic opera by Hook, &quot;The Fair Peruvian&quot;, in March 1786, featured Bannister opposite the excellent Mrs Billington, who became suddenly ill during the performance. A different play being offered, Bannister, by winning a laugh, managed to placate a turbulent audience. Bannister was identified with many songs which were never bettered than in his performance of them. &#x27;Among them may be named: &quot;Her mouth which a smile&quot;, in &quot;Rosina&quot;; &quot;While happy in my native land&quot;, in &quot;The Election&quot;; &quot;Brave Admiral Benbow&quot;; &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;; &quot;When Bibo went down to the regions below&quot;; and above all, and never to be equalled or forgotten, &quot;Stand to your guns, my Hearts of Oak!&quot; In this song, his diminuendo while giving the command, &quot;Reserve your fire&quot; – and, &quot;not yet, nor yet,&quot; followed by the tremendous burst of his powerful voice, in the word &quot;Fire!&quot; produced an electrifying and appalling effect.&#x27;

==In travesty==
He was said to have &#x27;one of the most extensive falsettos ever heard&#x27;. Garrick took Felice Giardini to hear Bannister&#x27;s imitations of Tenducci and Champneys, and the composer observed that the mimicry was perfect, but the fault was that the mimic was better than the performers themselves. Michael Kelly refers to his appearance as Polly in a travesty of &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket in 1781, in which he &#x27;gave her tender airs with all the power of his deep and sonorous bass voice.&#x27; He brought it off not by mimicking feminine intonation or mincing gait, antics or &#x27;superadded drolleries&#x27;, but by the ridiculous incongruity of his deep voice and muscular frame, by an occasional display of ankle, and by the perfect judgement with which he sang Polly&#x27;s songs. This was heard with great disgust by the visiting Italian male soprano Ferdinando Mazzanti, who did not realize it was a burlesque production.

==The Drama==
He was received with such favour that David Garrick engaged him for Drury Lane. Kelly also mentions his &#x27;admirable&#x27; appearance as Hecate in a production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, 21 March 1794, at the opening of the New Drury Lane Theatre, in a cast led by John Kemble and Mrs Siddons, the Malcolm played by Charles Kemble in his first public appearance in London. As Hecate, Bannister was a successor to the celebrated bass Richard Leveridge (who had composed the &quot;Macbeth&quot; music about a century before and performed the role for some forty years).&quot; The Tempest&quot; gave Bannister a famous role as Caliban: &#x27;Combining, as he did, a deep and sonorous voice both in speaking and singing, a large and vigorous person, and great force in the management of all his advantages, Charles Bannister was an exact and stupendous representative of this hag-born monster; no contemporary or successor has given so perfect a delineation. It is impossible to exceed the vigour with which he ejaculated his curses, the humility with which he worshipped the &quot;brave god who carried the bottle&quot;, or the appalling revelry with which he made the stage tremble under him, when he shouted &quot;Freedom! hey-day! liberty! freedom!&quot; and thundered out his song,&quot;Ban, ban, Ca-Caliban, Has a new master, get a new man&quot;.&#x27; &#x27;With Charles Bannister, Shakspeare&#x27;s monster died.&#x27;

==Character==
Charles Bannister was much celebrated as a wit. He possessed, &#x27;in high perfection, the faculty of repartee, unimpaired by any display of spleen or malevolence: his hits were therefore always well received. He was, at this time, eminently in favour with the public, upon whom his truly English style of singing and acting had made a powerful impression; he was greatly esteemed in all convivial and social circles, where his never-failing good humour and versatile talent occasioned his company to be generally courted, and among whom his affability, candour and plain integrity procured him the title of &quot;Honest Charles Bannister&quot;.&#x27; He was, however, not very good at organizing his monetary affairs.

George Garrick was always very anxious to please his brother David, and whenever he came into the theatre he invariably asked, &quot;Has my brother wanted me?&quot; It so befell that George died very soon after his brother&#x27;s funeral, and when the news came someone observed that this was extraordinary. &quot;Not at all,&quot; said Charles Bannister, &quot;His brother wanted him&quot;. Another example: &#x27;Bannister repeats – or has invented – a very witty thing said by Jack Ketch as he was tying the halter. A culprit asked him &quot;if he had any commands to the other world.&quot; &quot;Why,&quot; said Jack, &quot;not much – I&#x27;ll – only -&quot; (added he, as he adjusted the knot under his left ear) &quot;just – trouble you – WITH A LINE&quot;.&#x27; The theatrical memoirs of the period are laced with examples of Bannister&#x27;s quips and rejoinders: he seems to have been unstoppable.

According to The Epicure&#x27;s Almanack, Bannister&#x27;s wit earned him free room and board for life at the One Tun Tavern on Jermyn Street:

:&quot;This is one of the meritorious houses which have risen progressively from the obscurity of a chop-house to the importance of a tavern. If report may be credited, it owes its first rise to an accidental circumstance. The late Charles Bannister, of facetious memory, having, for some time, occasionally &quot;used&quot; the house, and by his wit and inexhaustible humour, attracted a crowd of company, the honest host thought fit to fix this magnet by crying quits for bed and board as long as Mr. Bannister continued his guest. The terms we believe were accepted, and the contract terminated only with the life of the comedian.&quot;

He and William Shield, Charles Incledon, Charles Dignum, &#x27;Jack&#x27; Johnstone, Charles Ashley and William Parke (oboeist) in 1793 formed themselves into &#x27;The Glee Club&#x27;, a set which met on Sunday evenings during the season at the Garrick&#x27;s Head Coffee House in Bow Street, once a fortnight, for singing among themselves and dining together. A project to erect a bust to Dr Thomas Arne, which this group proposed to fund by charitable performances, was vetoed by the management of Covent Garden.

Bannister died on 26 October 1804, after a period of illness which had kept him from the stage. In his last weeks there were several benefit performances for him, for which the managers of both principal theatres allowed their leading actors to participate without charge. &#x27;In &quot;Ways and Means&quot;, &quot;Honest Thieves&quot; and &quot;The Rival Soldiers&quot; he had, therefore, beside his son, (Joseph) Munden, (Jack) Johnstone, (George) Bartley, (Samuel) Simmons, Mrs. Gibbs and Mrs. Davenport.&#x27; The National Portrait Gallery in London has various portraits of Charles Bannister.

His son, John Bannister, was also a famous actor and manager.

<doc id="149968" wikidata="Q20294235" url="?curid=149968" title="Row and column vectors">
<text>In linear algebra, a column vector with elements is an formula_1 matrix consisting of a single column of entries, for example,
formula_2

Similarly, a row vector is a formula_3 matrix for some , consisting of a single row of entries,
formula_4
(Throughout this article, boldface is used for both row and column vectors.)
The transpose (indicated by ) of any row vector is a column vector, and the transpose of any column vector is a row vector:
formula_5
and
formula_6

The set of all row vectors with entries in a given field (such as the real numbers) forms an -dimensional vector space; similarly, the set of all column vectors with entries forms an -dimensional vector space.

The space of row vectors with entries can be regarded as the dual space of the space of column vectors with entries, since any linear functional on the space of column vectors can be represented as the left-multiplication of a unique row vector.

== Notation ==

To simplify writing column vectors in-line with other text, sometimes they are written as row vectors with the transpose operation applied to them.

formula_7

or

formula_8

Some authors also use the convention of writing both column vectors and row vectors as rows, but separating row vector elements with commas and column vector elements with semicolons (see alternative notation 2 in the table below).
== Operations ==

Matrix multiplication involves the action of multiplying each row vector of one matrix by each column vector of another matrix. 

The dot product of two column vectors , considered as elements of a coordinate space, is equal to the matrix product of the transpose of with ,

formula_9

By the symmetry of the dot product, the dot product of two column vectors is also equal to the matrix product of the transpose of with ,

formula_10

The matrix product of a column and a row vector gives the outer product of two vectors , an example of the more general tensor product. The matrix product of the column vector representation of and the row vector representation of gives the components of their dyadic product,

formula_11

which is the transpose of the matrix product of the column vector representation of and the row vector representation of ,

formula_12

==Matrix transformations==

An matrix can represent a linear map and act on row and column vectors as the linear map&#x27;s transformation matrix. For a row vector , the product is another row vector : 

formula_13

Another matrix can act on ,

formula_14

Then one can write , so the matrix product transformation maps directly to . Continuing with row vectors, matrix transformations further reconfiguring -space can be applied to the right of previous outputs.

When a column vector is transformed to another column vector under an matrix action, the operation occurs to the left,

formula_15

leading to the algebraic expression for the composed output from input. The matrix transformations mount up to the left in this use of a column vector for input to matrix transformation.

<doc id="149969" wikidata="Q1874033" url="?curid=149969" title="Popular psychology">
<text>Popular psychology (sometimes shortened as pop psychology or pop psych) refers to the concepts and theories about human mental life and behavior that are supposedly based on psychology and are considered credible and accepted by the wider populace. The concept is cognate with the human potential movement of the 1950s and 1960s.

The term &quot;pop psychologist&quot; can be used to describe authors, consultants, lecturers, and entertainers who are widely perceived as being psychologists, not because of their academic credentials, but because they have projected that image or have been perceived in that way in response to their work.

The term &quot;popular psychology&quot; can also be used when referring to the &quot;popular psychology industry&quot;, a sprawling network of everyday sources of information about human behavior.

The term is often used in a pejorative fashion to describe psychological concepts that appear oversimplified, out of date, unproven, misunderstood or misinterpreted; however, the term may also be used to describe professionally produced psychological knowledge, regarded by most experts as valid and effective, that is intended for use by the general public.

==Types==
Popular psychology commonly takes the form of:
* self-help books, for example &quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot;, by M. Scott Peck;
* advice dispensed through radio, TV, and print; for example Dear Abby, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot; and Dan Savage;
* myths such as &quot;People use only about 10 percent of their brain&#x27;s capacity&quot;;
* terminology that may have a basis in psychology, but which appears more frequently in the vernacular than in professional discourse—for example, inner child, left brain/right brain, emotional intelligence, Freudian slip, and enneagram;
* public perceptions about psychological methodologies that have not been scientifically validated, such as neuro-linguistic programming;
* urban legends such as &quot;Psychologist B. F. Skinner raised his own daughter in a &#x27;Skinner box&#x27; &quot;

==Self-help==
Popular psychology is an essential ingredient of the self-help industry.

According to Fried and Schultis, criteria for a good self-help book include &quot;claims made by the author as to the book&#x27;s efficacy, the presentation of problem-solving strategies based on scientific evidence and professional experience, the author&#x27;s credentials and professional experience, and the inclusion of a bibliography.&quot;

Three potential dangers of self-help books are:
* people may falsely label themselves as psychologically disturbed;
* people may misdiagnose themselves and use material that deals with the wrong problem;
* people may not be able to evaluate a program and may select an ineffective one;

==Psychobabble==
The misuse and overuse of technical psychological terms is called &quot;psychobabble&quot;.

Sometimes psychological jargon is used to dress up sales pitches, self-help programs, and New Age ideas to lend these endeavors a respectable scientific appearance. Other times, people use psychological terminology to describe everyday, normal experiences in a way that pathologize a normal behavior, such as feeling sad after a loss, by suggesting that unpleasant emotions are a type of psychopathology, like major depressive disorder. People may use psychobabble because they believe that complex, descriptive or special esoteric terms more clearly or more dramatically communicate their experiences of social and personal situations, or because they believe that it makes them sound more educated.

Some terms that have an origin in psychological terminology and are typically misused include co-dependent, dysfunctional, meaningful relationship, narcissistic, antisocial, traumatic bonding, synergy, and gaslighting.

==History==
Early movements in the history of American psychology can explain the importance our culture places on the field at large.

===Rise of psychology in the United States===
Beginning late in the 19th century, and largely influenced by German scholar Wilhelm Wundt, Americans including James Mckeen Cattell, G. Stanley Hall, William James, and others helped to formalize psychology as an academic discipline in the United States. Popularity in psychology grew as the public became more aware of the field. In 1890, James published &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;, which produced a surge of public interest. In 1892, James wrote &quot;Psychology: The Briefer Course&quot; as an opportunity for the public to read and understand psychological literature. In a similar attempt in 1895, E. W. Scripture, another American psychologist, published a book, called &quot;Thinking, Feeling, Doing&quot;, that was adapted for the average reader.

===Popular misconceptions and the effort to counteract===
Despite the various publications, the general public had minimal understanding of what psychologists did and what psychology was all about. Many believed psychology was &quot;mind reading and spiritualism&quot; and that it had no real application in everyday life, whereas in reality, psychology was more about studying normal human behaviors and experiences that could very well have strong applications to everyday life.

Thus, regardless of the mass interest in psychology, an accurate account of psychology for the layman was rare. Many psychologists became concerned that their profession was failing appropriately to reach the public.

In 1893, Joseph Jastrow and Hugo Münsterberg led a public exhibit on psychology in the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago as an effort to celebrate psychology, offer information to the public, and correct popular misconceptions. The exhibit provided catalogs of information on equipment, research topics, and purposes of psychology. In a similar attempt to inform the public, the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis included (among others) presentations from G. Stanley Hall, Edward B. Titchener, Mary Whiton Calkins, John B. Watson, and Adolph Meyer. The exhibits also included public testing and experimentation.

Although admirable, the attempt to seek public approval failed to make a significant impact and psychologists became more concerned about their public image. In 1900, Jastrow wrote a book entitled &quot;Fact and Fable in Psychology&quot; that aimed to resolve popular psychological misconceptions by clearly discerning fact from fable. In preface to his book, Jastrow states, &quot;It is a matter of serious concern that the methods of genuine psychology, that the conditions of advance in psychology, that the scope and nature of its problems should be properly understood.&quot; (vii)

===Popularization of psychology===
It was not until the more powerful movement of applied psychology that popularity in psychology grew to affect people&#x27;s everyday lives. The work of G. Stanley Hall in educational psychology led changes in the approaches of teaching and the Child-Study movement, supported in experimental psychology, and guided educational reform.

Several critics warned that applying experimental psychology to education may be problematic. In 1898, Münsterberg wrote a controversial article entitled &quot;The Danger from Experimental Psychology&quot; in which he claims the impossible transfer of experimental results into successful teaching practices.

Despite the disagreements, popular culture grasped onto the implications in the field of applied psychology with the hope that the research could improve their lives. Early applications included clinical psychology, business, industrial psychology, and the psychology of advertising. Furthermore, the onset of World War I led to advances in psychology brought about by its application in military psychology.

The media provided the public more accessible psychological information through the publication of countless books and popular magazines including &quot;Harpers&quot;, &quot;Forum&quot;, &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Colliers&quot;. After WWI, demand grew for a more frequent source of popular psychology and newspapers became a primary source of public information. In fact, newspaper columns were so well-received that professional psychologist Jastrow had a column entitled &quot;Keeping Mentally Fit&quot; that appeared in more than 150 newspapers in the 1920s.

Soon, public demand for psychological services and information grew so fierce that the availability of legitimate research and real psychologists became insufficient. Consequently, nonprofessionals began to offer their services under the guise of psychologists.

The American Psychological Association (APA) responded with an effort to establish official certifications for trained psychologists. However, popular interest overlooked the qualifications and eagerly sought to apply popular psychological science regardless of its validity.

Short-lived, the excitement over useful psychology was curbed by articles warning of the exaggerated and false claims made by popular psychology. Stephen Leacock described the changing popularity in psychology in 1924, stating,

As part of the new researches, it was found that psychology can be used... for almost everything in life. There is now not only psychology in the academic or college sense, but also a Psychology of Business, Psychology of Education, a Psychology of Salesmanship, a Psychology of Religion... and a Psychology of Playing the Banjo. In short, everybody has his.
Others authored similar cautions to the public and, among the most recursive, was that of Grace Adams (psychologist) who, in her 1928 article, wrote

a vociferous attack on applied psychology [and] argued that psychology had forsaken its scientific roots so that individual psychologists might achieve popularity and prosperity.
After the Depression hit in 1929, popular literature began to decline while scientific publications in periodicals increased. This discrepancy between the public sector and academia supported the popular belief that professional psychologists were not interested in solving America&#x27;s problems. The lack of professional participation provided pseudoscientific and unprofessional psychological literature to become very popular. In the 1930s, self-help books and the publication of three magazines (&quot;Modern Psychologist&quot;, &quot;Practical Psychology Monthly&quot;, and &quot;Psychology Digest&quot;) became part of a popular psychology movement.

World War II gave professional psychology another chance to prove its value as a science with an increase in professional opportunities. In the article &quot;Don&#x27;t They Understand Us? A history of Psychology&#x27;s Public Image&quot;, Benjamin describes the direction of psychology at the time:

The praise psychologists received from government, industry, and the military provided a tremendous boost for the public image of psychology... Yet many contemporary psychologists are concerned that the current image is far from acceptable and that the science and profession of psychology continues to suffer because of that image.
===Current status of popular psychology===
In his Presidential Address to the APA in 1969, George Armitage Miller was hopeful for psychology&#x27;s future stating, &quot;that the real impact of psychology will be felt, ... through its effects on the public at large, through a new and different public conception of what is humanly possible and what is humanly desirable.&quot;

Current events influence the popularity of areas in psychology. During 2020 and 2021 many of the most popular psychology articles were about COVID-19 and even Zoom fatigue. The APA&#x27;s most downloaded journal articles frequently include research about social media. Social media frequently spreads misinformation about health, and this could extend to mental health misinformation. Psychobabble can be used on social media to spread this misinformation. However, social media can be a place where pop psychology is used to spread mental health awareness.

=== Limits and criticism ===
A June 2023 article by Vox Media explored the limits of pop psychology terms (&quot;therapy speak&quot;) saying &quot;people become attached to terms that encapsulate certain events and people, to varying degrees, in order to bolster an argument or justify an experience. Having common language to describe a difficult situation can help people more effectively communicate their concerns and garner support, but these terms can just as easily be weaponized.&quot;

<text>Procrastination is the act of unnecessarily delaying or postponing something despite knowing that there could be negative consequences for doing so. It is a common human experience involving delays in everyday chores or even putting off tasks such as attending an appointment, submitting a job report or academic assignment, or broaching a stressful issue with a partner. It is often perceived as a negative trait due to its hindering effect on one&#x27;s productivity, associated with depression, low self-esteem, guilt, and feelings of inadequacy. However, it can also be considered a wise response to certain demands that could present risky or negative outcomes or require waiting for new information to arrive.

From a cultural and social perspective, students from both Western and non-Western cultures are found to exhibit academic procrastination, but for different reasons. Students from Western cultures tend to procrastinate in order to avoid doing worse than they have done before or failing to learn as much as they should have, whereas students from non-Western cultures tend to procrastinate in order to avoid looking incompetent or demonstrating a lack of ability in front of their peers. Different cultural perspectives of time management can impact procrastination. For example, in cultures that have a multi-active view of time, people tend to place a higher value on making sure a job is done accurately before finishing. In cultures with a linear view of time, people tend to designate a certain amount of time on a task and stop once the allotted time has expired.

A study of the behavioral patterns of pigeons through delayed gratification suggests that procrastination is not unique to humans but can also be observed in some other animals. There are experiments finding clear evidence for &quot;procrastination&quot; among pigeons, which show that pigeons tend to choose a complex but delayed task rather than an easy but hurry-up one.

Procrastination has been studied by philosophers, psychologists and, more recently, behavioral economists.

== Etymology ==
, , with from . The word originated from the Latin word , which itself evolved from the prefix , and .

== Prevalence ==
In a study of academic procrastination from the University of Vermont, published in 1984, 46% of the subjects reported that they &quot;always&quot; or &quot;nearly always&quot; procrastinated writing papers, while approximately 30% reported procrastinating studying for exams and reading weekly assignments (by 28% and 30% respectively). Nearly a quarter of the subjects reported that procrastination was a problem for them regarding the same tasks. However, as many as 65% indicated that they would like to reduce their procrastination when writing papers, and approximately 62% indicated the same for studying for exams and 55% for reading weekly assignments.

A 1992 study showed that &quot;52% of surveyed students indicated having a moderate to high need for help concerning procrastination.&quot;

A study done in 2004 showed that 70% of university students categorized themselves as procrastinators while a 1984 study showed that 50% of the students would procrastinate consistently and considered it a major problem in their lives.

In a study performed on university students, procrastination was shown to be greater with tasks that were perceived as unpleasant or as impositions than with tasks for which the student believed they lacked the required skills for accomplishing the task.

Another point of relevance is that of procrastination in industry. A study from the &quot;State of the Art&quot; journal &quot;The Impact of Organizational and Personal Factors on Procrastination in Employees of a Modern Russian Industrial Enterprise published in the Psychology in Russia&quot;, helped to identify the many factors that affected employees&#x27; procrastination habits. Some of which include intensity of performance evaluations, importance of their duty within a company, and their perception and opinions on management and/or upper level decisions.

== Behavioral criteria of academic procrastination ==
Gregory Schraw, Theresa Wadkins, and Lori Olafson in 2007 proposed three criteria for a behavior to be classified as academic procrastination: it must be counterproductive, needless, and delaying. Steel reviewed all previous attempts to define procrastination, and concluded in a 2007 study that procrastination is &quot;to voluntarily delay an intended course of action despite expecting to be worse off for the delay.&quot; Sabini and Silver argued that postponement and irrationality are the two key features of procrastination. Delaying a task is not deemed as procrastination, they argue, if there are rational reasons behind the delay. Further, in a study conducted by Pogorskiy and Beckmann, learners&#x27; procrastination is characterised by stable sequential patterns in learners&#x27; web navigation behaviour.

An approach that integrates several core theories of motivation as well as meta-analytic research on procrastination is the temporal motivation theory. It summarizes key predictors of procrastination (expectancy, value, and impulsiveness) into a mathematical equation.

==Psychological perspective==
The pleasure principle may be responsible for procrastination; one may prefer to avoid negative emotions by delaying stressful tasks. In 2019, a research conducted by Rinaldi et al. indicated that measurable cognitive impairments may play a role in procrastination. As the deadline for their target of procrastination grows closer, they are more stressed and may, thus, decide to procrastinate more to avoid this stress. Some psychologists cite such behavior as a mechanism for coping with the anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or decision. Piers Steel indicated in 2010 that anxiety is just as likely to induce people to start working early as late, and that the focus of studies on procrastination should be impulsiveness. That is, anxiety will cause people to delay only if they are impulsive.

=== Coping responses ===
Negative coping responses of procrastination tend to be avoidant or emotional rather than task-oriented or focused on problem-solving. Emotional and avoidant coping is employed to reduce stress (and cognitive dissonance) associated with delaying intended and important personal goals. This option provides immediate pleasure and is consequently very attractive to impulsive procrastinators, at the point of discovery of the achievable goals at hand. There are several emotion-oriented strategies, similar to Freudian defense mechanisms, coping styles and self-handicapping.

Coping responses of procrastinators include the following:
* Avoidance: Avoiding the location or situation where the task takes place.
* Denial and trivialization: Pretending that procrastinatory behavior is not actually procrastinating, but rather a task which is more important than the avoided one, or that the essential task that should be done is not of immediate importance.
* Distraction: Engaging or immersing oneself in other behaviors or actions to prevent awareness of the task.
* Descending counterfactuality: Comparing consequences of one&#x27;s procrastinatory behavior with others&#x27; worse situations.
* Valorisation: Pointing in satisfaction to what one achieved in the meantime while one should have been doing something else.
* Blaming: Delusional attributions to external factors, such as rationalizing that the procrastination is due to external forces beyond one&#x27;s control.
* Mocking: Using humor to validate one&#x27;s procrastination.

Task- or problem-solving measures are taxing from a procrastinator&#x27;s outlook. If such measures are pursued, it is less likely the procrastinator would remain a procrastinator. However, pursuing such measures requires actively changing one&#x27;s behavior or situation to prevent and minimize the re-occurrence of procrastination.

In 2006, it was suggested that neuroticism has no direct links to procrastination and that any relationship is fully mediated by conscientiousness. In 1982, it had been suggested that irrationality was an inherent feature of procrastination. &quot;Putting things off even until the last moment isn&#x27;t procrastination if there is a reason to believe that they will take only that moment&quot;. Steel &quot;et al.&quot; explained in 2001, &quot;actions must be postponed and this postponement must represent poor, inadequate, or inefficient planning&quot;.

== Cultural perspective ==
According to Holly McGregor and Andrew Elliot (2001); Christopher Wolters (2003), academic procrastination among portions of undergraduate students has been correlated to &quot;performance-avoidance orientation&quot; which is one factor of the four factor model of achievement orientation. Andrew Elliot and Judith Harackiewicz (1996) showed that students with performance-avoidance orientations tended to be concerned about comparisons with their peers. These students procrastinated as a result of not wanting to look incompetent, or to avoid demonstrating a lack of ability and adopt a facade of competence for a task in front of their peers.

Gregory Arief Liem and Youyan Nie (2008) found that cultural characteristics are shown to have a direct influence on achievement orientation because it is closely aligned with most students&#x27; cultural values and beliefs. Sonja Dekker and Ronald Fischer&#x27;s (2008) meta-analysis across thirteen different societies revealed that students from Western cultures tend to be motivated more by &quot;mastery-approach orientation&quot; because the degree of incentive value for individual achievement is strongly reflective of the values of Western culture. By contrast, most students from Eastern cultures have been found to be &quot;performance-avoidance orientated&quot;. They often make efforts to maintain a positive image of their abilities, which they display while in front of their peers. In addition, Hazel Rose Markus and Shinobu Kitayama (1991) showed that in non-Western cultures, rather than standing out through their achievements, people tend to be motivated to become part of various interpersonal relationships and to fit in with those that are relevant to them.

Research by Sushila Niles (1998) with Australian students and Sri Lankan students confirmed these differences, revealing that Australian students often pursued more individual goals, whereas Sri Lankan students usually desired more collaborative and social goals. Multiple studies by Kuo-Shu Yang and An-Bang Yu (1987, 1988, 1990) have indicated that individual achievement among most Chinese and Japanese students were measured by a fulfillment of their obligation and responsibility to their family network, not to individual accomplishments. Yang and Yu (1987) have also shown that collectivism and Confucianism are very strong motivators for achievement in many non-Western cultures because of their emphasis on cooperation in the family unit and community. Guided by these cultural values, it is believed that the individual intuitively senses the degree of pressure that differentiates his or her factor of achievement orientation.

== Health perspective ==
To a certain degree it is normal to procrastinate and it can be regarded as a useful way to prioritize between tasks, due to a lower tendency of procrastination on truly valued tasks. However, excessive procrastination can become a problem and impede normal functioning. When this happens, procrastination has been found to result in health problems, stress, anxiety, a sense of guilt and crisis as well as loss of personal productivity and social disapproval for not meeting responsibilities or commitments. Together these feelings may promote further procrastination and for some individuals procrastination becomes almost chronic. Such procrastinators may have difficulties seeking support due to procrastination itself, but also social stigmas and the belief that task-aversion is caused by laziness, lack of willpower or low ambition. In some cases, problematic procrastination might be a sign of some underlying psychological disorder.

Research on the physiological roots of procrastination have been concerned with the role of the prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain that is responsible for executive brain functions such as impulse control, attention and planning. This is consistent with the notion that procrastination is strongly related to such functions, or a lack thereof. The prefrontal cortex also acts as a filter, decreasing distracting stimuli from other brain regions. Damage or low activation in this area can reduce one&#x27;s ability to avert diversions, which results in poorer organization, a loss of attention, and increased procrastination. This is similar to the prefrontal lobe&#x27;s role in ADHD, where it is commonly under-activated.

In a 2014 U.S. study surveying procrastination and impulsiveness in fraternal and identical twin pairs, both traits were found to be &quot;moderately heritable&quot;. The two traits were not separable at the genetic level (rgenetic = 1.0), meaning no unique genetic influences of either trait alone was found. The authors confirmed three constructs developed from the evolutionary hypothesis that procrastination arose as a by-product of impulsivity: &quot;(a) Procrastination is heritable, (b) the two traits share considerable genetic variation, and (c) goal-management ability is an important component of this shared variation.&quot;

== In culture ==

In Hungary, &quot;Pató Pál&quot; is known to be the personification of procrastination, portrayed as a pipe-smoking gentleman. The character appears in the poem of Sándor Petőfi, one of the most well known Hungarian poets. A real judge is accredited as the inspiration for the character. He is often referred to and his famous saying, &quot;Ej, ráérünk arra még!&quot; (from old Hungarian, meaning &quot;Oh, we&#x27;ve got time for that!&quot;) is used as a catchphrase.

== Correlates ==
Procrastination has been linked to the complex arrangement of cognitive, affective and behavioral relationships from task desirability to low self esteem and anxiety to depression. A study found that procrastinators were less future-oriented than their non-procrastinator counterparts. This result was hypothesized to be in association with hedonistic perspectives on the present; instead it was found procrastination was better predicted by a fatalistic and hopeless attitude towards life.

A correlation between procrastination and eveningness was observed where individuals who had later sleeping and waking patterns were more likely to procrastinate. Smartphone addiction is an important factor that interferes with sleep, and it is characterized by compulsive behavior patterns that cause people to malfunction. When smartphone use is suspended, withdrawal reactions may occur, seriously affecting sleep. It has been shown that morningness increases across lifespan and procrastination decreases with age.

=== Perfectionism ===

Traditionally, procrastination has been associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one&#x27;s own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one&#x27;s abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and &quot;workaholism&quot;. However, adaptive perfectionists—egosyntonic perfectionism—were &quot;less&quot; likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem—egodystonic perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety. In a regression analysis study from 2007, it was found that mild to moderate perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with &quot;the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling&quot;.

Perfectionism is a common cause for procrastination because pursuing unattainable goals (perfection) usually results in failure. Unrealistic expectations destroy self-esteem and lead to self-repudiation, self-contempt, and widespread unhappiness. To overcome procrastination, it is essential to recognize and accept the power of failure without condemning, to stop focusing on faults and flaws and to set goals that are easier to achieve.

=== Academic ===
According to an Educational Science Professor, Hatice Odaci, academic procrastination is a significant problem during college years in part because many college students lack efficient time management skills in using the Internet. Also, Odaci notes that most colleges provide free and fast twenty-four-hour Internet service which some students are not usually accustomed to, and as a result of irresponsible use or lack of firewalls these students become engulfed in distractions, and thus in procrastination. Psychologist William J. Knaus estimated that more than 90% of college students procrastinate. Of these students, 25% are chronic procrastinators and typically abandon higher education.

Student syndrome is the phenomenon where a student will begin to fully apply themselves to a task only immediately before a deadline. This negates the usefulness of any buffers built into individual task duration estimates. Results from a 2002 study indicate that many students are aware of procrastination and accordingly set binding deadlines long before the date for which a task is due. These self-imposed binding deadlines are correlated with a better performance than without binding deadlines though performance is best for evenly spaced external binding deadlines. Finally, students have difficulties optimally setting self-imposed deadlines, with results suggesting a lack of spacing before the date at which results are due. In one experiment, participation in online exercises was found to be five times higher in the final week before a deadline than in the summed total of the first three weeks for which the exercises were available. Procrastinators end up being the ones doing most of the work in the final week before a deadline. Additionally, students can delay making important decisions such as &quot;I&#x27;ll get my degree out of the way first then worry about jobs and careers when I finish University&quot;.

Other reasons cited on why students procrastinate include fear of failure and success, perfectionist expectations, as well as legitimate activities that may take precedence over school work, such as a job.

Procrastinators have been found to receive worse grades than non-procrastinators. Tice et al. (1997) report that more than one-third of the variation in final exam scores could be attributed to procrastination. The negative association between procrastination and academic performance is recurring and consistent. The students in the study not only received poor academic grades, but they also reported high levels of stress and poor self-health. Howell et al. (2006) found that, though scores on two widely used procrastination scales were not significantly associated with the grade received for an assignment, self-report measures of procrastination on the assessment itself were negatively associated with grade.

In 2005, a study conducted by Angela Chu and Jin Nam Choi and published in &quot;The Journal of Social Psychology&quot; intended to understand task performance among procrastinators with the definition of procrastination as the absence of self-regulated performance, from the 1977 work of Ellis &amp; Knaus. In their study they identified two types of procrastination: the traditional procrastination which they denote as passive, and active procrastination where the person finds enjoyment of a goal-oriented activity only under pressure. The study calls this active procrastination positive procrastination, as it is a functioning state in a self-handicapping environment. In addition, it was observed that active procrastinators have more realistic perceptions of time and perceive more control over their time than passive procrastinators, which is considered a major differentiator between the two types. Due to this observation, active procrastinators are much more similar to non-procrastinators as they have a better sense of purpose in their time use and possess efficient time-structuring behaviors. But surprisingly, active and passive procrastinators showed similar levels of academic performance. The population of the study was college students and the majority of the sample size were women and Asian in origin. Comparisons with chronic pathological procrastination traits were avoided.

Different findings emerge when observed and self-reported procrastination are compared. Steel et al. constructed their own scales based on Silver and Sabini&#x27;s &quot;irrational&quot; and &quot;postponement&quot; criteria. They also sought to measure this behavior objectively. During a course, students could complete exam practice computer exercises at their own pace, and during the supervised class time could also complete chapter quizzes. A weighted average of the times at which each chapter quiz was finished formed the measure of observed procrastination, whilst observed irrationality was quantified with the number of practice exercises that were left uncompleted. Researchers found that there was only a moderate correlation between observed and self-reported procrastination (r = 0.35). There was a very strong inverse relationship between the number of exercises completed and the measure of postponement (r = −0.78). Observed procrastination was very strongly negatively correlated with course grade (r = −0.87), as was self-reported procrastination (though less so, r = −0.36). As such, self-reported measures of procrastination, on which the majority of the literature is based, may not be the most appropriate measure to use in all cases. It was also found that procrastination itself may not have contributed significantly to poorer grades. Steel et al. noted that those students who completed all of the practice exercises &quot;tended to perform well on the final exam no matter how much they delayed.&quot;

Procrastination is considerably more widespread in students than in the general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point. A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct can be seen as a means to cope with the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.

== Theoretical framings ==
Procrastination has been framed as an error in self-regulation. Kuhl distinguished conscious and subconscious regulation. It is often distinguished from &quot;strategic delay&quot; where tasks are deliberately delayed and the individual positively acknowledges that the benefit of delay exceed the long term benefits.

== Management ==
Psychological interventions for procrastination include self-regulation approaches, cognitive behavioural therapy, coherence therapy, commitment therapy and acceptance therapy. Cognitive behavioural therapy approaches on average have the largest effects on average substantial reduction in procrastination is possible.Cognitive behavioural therapy identifies thoughts surrounding activities, labels some of them as dysfunctional, and corrects them, and then seeks to associate these corrected thoughts with actions.

One form of self-regulation is time management, which does not normally address emotional issues related to procrastination so interventions are often combined with other approaches. Coherence therapy seeks to understand an underlying emotional truth behind procrastination, acceptance therapy focuses on viewing emotional responses as to be expected and transitory. Strength-based approaches aim to foster self-efficacy (an individual&#x27;s knowledge of and therefore application of their capabilities) by making individuals aware of their strengths.

Behaviors and practices that reduce procrastination:
* Awareness of habits and thoughts that lead to procrastinating.
* Seeking help for self-defeating problems such as fear, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, poor time management, indecisiveness, and perfectionism.
* Fair evaluation of personal goals, strengths, weaknesses, and priorities.
* Realistic goals and personal positive links between the tasks and the concrete, meaningful goals.
* Structuring and organization of daily activities.
* Modification of one&#x27;s environment for that newly gained perspective: the elimination or minimization of noise or distraction; investing effort into relevant matters; and ceasing day-dreaming.
* Disciplining oneself to set priorities.
* Motivation with enjoyable activities, socializing and constructive hobbies.
* Approaching issues in small blocks of time, instead of attempting whole problems at once and risking intimidation.
* To prevent relapse, reinforce pre-set goals based on needs and allow yourself to be rewarded in a balanced way for accomplished tasks.

Making a plan to complete tasks in a rigid schedule format might not work for everyone. There is no hard-and-fast rule to follow such a process if it turns out to be counter-productive. Instead of scheduling, it may be better to execute tasks in a flexible, unstructured schedule which has time slots for only necessary activities.

Piers Steel suggests that better time management is a key to overcoming procrastination, including being aware of and using one&#x27;s &quot;power hours&quot; (being a &quot;morning person&quot; or &quot;night owl&quot;). A good approach is to creatively utilize one&#x27;s internal circadian rhythms that are best suited for the most challenging and productive work. Steel states that it is essential to have realistic goals, to tackle one problem at a time and to cherish the &quot;small successes&quot;. Brian O&#x27;Leary supports that &quot;finding a work-life balance...may actually help us find ways to be more productive&quot;, suggesting that dedicating leisure activities as motivation can increase one&#x27;s efficiency at handling tasks. Procrastination is not a lifelong trait. Those likely to worry can learn to let go, those who procrastinate can find different methods and strategies to help focus and avoid impulses.

After contemplating his own procrastination habits, philosopher John Perry authored an essay entitled &quot;Structured Procrastination&quot;, wherein he proposes a &quot;cheat&quot; method as a safer approach for tackling procrastination: using a pyramid scheme to reinforce the unpleasant tasks needed to be completed in a quasi-prioritized order.

==Severe and negative impact==
For some people, procrastination can be persistent and tremendously disruptive to everyday life. For these individuals, procrastination may reveal psychiatric disorders. Procrastination has been linked to a number of negative associations, such as depression, irrational behavior, low self-esteem, anxiety and neurological disorders such as ADHD or perfectionism OCD. Others have found relationships with guilt and stress. Therefore, it is important for people whose procrastination has become chronic and is perceived to be debilitating to seek out a trained therapist or psychiatrist to investigate whether an underlying mental health issue may be present.

With a distant deadline, procrastinators report significantly less stress and physical illness than do non-procrastinators. However, as the deadline approaches, this relationship is reversed. Procrastinators report more stress, more symptoms of physical illness, and more medical visits, to the extent that, overall, procrastinators experience more stress and health problems. This can cause quality of life to decrease significantly along with overall happiness. Procrastination also has the ability to increase perfectionism and neuroticism, while decreasing conscientiousness and optimism.

Procrastination can also lead to insomnia, Alisa Hrustic said in &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; that &quot;The procrastinators—people who scored above the median on the survey—were 1.5 to 3 times more likely to have symptoms of insomnia, like severe difficulty falling asleep, than those who scored lower on the test.&quot; Insomnia can even add more problems as a severe and negative impact.

<doc id="149974" wikidata="Q5397887" url="?curid=149974" title="Esholt">
<text>Esholt is a village and former civil parish in the metropolitan district of the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It is situated east of Shipley town centre, south-west of the A65 in Guiseley, north of Bradford City Centre, and north-west of Millennium Square, Leeds.

The name &quot;Esholt&quot; indicates that the village was first established in a heavily wooded area of ash trees.

== History ==
In the 12th century, the Esholt estate was owned by Syningthwaite Priory, and Esholt Priory, a Cistercian nunnery dedicated to St Mary and St Leonard was established at Lower Esholt. When the nunnery was dissolved in about 1547, the estate was granted to Henry Thompson by Edward VI. In the 17th century Frances Thompson, the heiress of Henry Thompson, married Walter Calverley (1629–1694). In 1709 their son Walter Calverley built Esholt Hall, a Queen Anne style mansion house, on the site of the old nunnery. In 1775 the Calverleys sold the estate to Robert Stansfield, whose family remained in possession until 1906, when it was sold to Bradford City Council.

To the north of the village was Esholt railway station, which opened in 1876 and closed in 1940. In 1892 a rail crash occurred at Esholt Junction on the Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway.

From 1912 to 1915 Nanson, Barker &amp; Co manufactured the Tiny cyclecar in Esholt. In 1919 after the First World War the company made larger cars under the Airedale brand but went into liquidation in 1924.

Just before the First World War land on the estate was used for Airedale Aerodrome. The current owner of the estate, Yorkshire Water, operates a waste water treatment plant on what was the location of the aerodrome. Home farm on the estate is used as a conference and staff learning centre and many buildings have Grade II star listed building status.

=== Civil parish ===
Esholt was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Otley. From 1866 Esholt was a civil parish in its own right. In 1931 the parish had a population of 496. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished, with most of the area, including the village itself, being added to the parish of Idle in the County Borough of Bradford, with smaller parts going to Aireborough and Baildon. Since 1937 the village has been administratively part of Bradford, although it remains outside the built-up area of the city.

== Landmarks ==
The manor house, Esholt Old Hall at Upper Esholt is medieval in origin, probably 16th century, and possibly once had a moat. It is well-preserved and has Grade II* listed building status.

Esholt has one public house, The Woolpack a listed building in Main Street.
The Church of Saint Paul was built at a cost of £800 in 1839 by William Rookes Crompton-Stansfield for use as a private family chapel.
Historically part of the parish of Guiseley,
the Church of St Paul is a successor to the private chapel in the old manor house. It was consecrated in 1853 and the chancel added in 1895. Since 1983 it has been in the combined parish of Guiseley with Esholt.

There are many listed buildings on Esholt Lane,
Cunliffe Lane,
Chapel Lane,
Church Lane,
Main Street,
St Leonard&#x27;s Farm,
Upper Esholt,
The Avenue,
and Esholt Hall.

=== Esholt Waste Water Treatment Works === 
Esholt Waste Water Treatment Works is located on a site on the former estate of Esholt Hall,
and serves 750,000 people in Bradford and North Leeds.
It is Yorkshire Water&#x27;s second largest waste water treatment plant, exceeded only by Knostrop in Leeds.

==== History ====
As Bradford&#x27;s population and the textile industry grew in the early 19th century most human waste and industrial effluent drained into Bradford Beck, to the canal basin and on to the River Aire flowing past Esholt.

In 1862 a sewage system was begun in Bradford but Bradford Beck was still polluted. In 1869 William Stansfield of Esholt Hall obtained an injunction requiring Bradford Corporation to improve the sewage system so as not to pollute the beck.
Bradford Corporation built a treatment works at Frizinghall to treat sewage before the water was put in the river.

When Frizinghall works could not cope with the waste the Esholt estate was acquired for more than £239,000 as the site for a new sewage works. A three-mile long tunnel between Frizinghall and Esholt to connect the sites was completed in the 1920s.
Frizinghall works closed in 1926.
The tunnel has ventilation shafts in Frizinghall, Wrose
and Idle.

In the site&#x27;s Sludge Disposal Building later known as the Press House, 128 steam filter presses compressed sludge to recover grease (lanolin) which could be used for a variety of applications, and the press residue was sold as fertiliser to meet the cost of operating the plant.
After Bradford&#x27;s woollen textile industry declined, the Press House became roofless and derelict.

==== Modernisation ====
Between 2006 and 2009 the waste water treatment plant was modernised. The £44m scheme included the installation of aeration tanks, activated sludge tanks, and sludge digestion facilities.
The sludge digestion facility produces biogas that is used in a combined heat and power plant with two CHP engines generating 19 MWh per day which is 44% of the electrical energy requirements of the site.
Waste products from the works are reprocessed, mixed with green waste and turned into compost.
The old percolating filters are obsolete and there are plans to empty them and install photovoltaic panels to generate electricity to power the site, with any excess going to the National Grid.

==== Hydro-electricity power generation ====
The effluent emerging from the sewage tunnel passes through motorised screens, then through the 64 tonne Spaans Babcock screw generators into the primary settling tanks. The screw generators comprise two diameter, long Archimedes&#x27; screw hydro-turbine generators installed in series.
The generators operate on a head of with a flow rate up to 2,678 litres per second, generating up to 175 kW, providing 7% of the electrical power required by equipment on the site.
The equipment was installed in 2009 by JN Bentley and is the first site in the UK to use untreated (screened) sewage for hydro power generation.

== Sport ==
Esholt Cricket Club is based at Upper Mill Cottages on Esholt Lane. Also on Esholt Lane is a golf driving range, and near Hollins Hall Hotel an 18-hole golf course.

== Transport ==

The 649 bus service to Shipley starts in Esholt. The A3 to Leeds Bradford Airport and Bradford Interchange stops near Esholt.
The nearest railway stations are at Baildon, Shipley, Guiseley and Apperley Bridge on the Wharfedale line.

== Popular culture ==

From 1976 to 1996 Esholt was used for outside location shots for the Yorkshire Television drama series &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;.
The series relocated to a purpose built set based on the layout of Esholt on the Harewood estate in Leeds.

During the time when the village was used as a location, the name of the village pub was changed from The Commercial Inn to The Woolpack when the landlord tired of the inconvenience caused by the frequent pub sign changes.

Scenes were once again filmed in Esholt, 19 years after they were last filmed, as part of the special episode following Ashley Thomas&#x27;s dementia storyline in December 2016 in an attempt to show a skewed, unfamiliar view of the village as perceived by Ashley.

== Notable people ==

Sir Walter Calverley (1670–1749) lived at Esholt Hall which he had built in 1706–7.
His son Sir Walter Calverley-Blackett (1707–77) lived at Esholt Hall before his marriage and until it sale in 1755. The estate was later owned by the MP William Crompton-Stansfield (1790–1871).

The mill owner Sir Henry Mitchell (1824-1898) was born in Esholt and received a knighthood for his support and service to education in Bradford.

<text>Fairburn is a small village and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England.

Situated approximately 10 miles (16 km) east of Leeds, the village lies close to the A1(M) motorway and the M62 motorway and until 2005, when the A1(M) motorway was opened, Fairburn was divided in two by the old A1 and the two sides of the village were connected by just one vehicle bridge and one pedestrian footbridge, both of which have subsequently been removed.

==Overview==

The village sits on the eastern edge of a narrow ridge of southern magnesian limestone which runs from near Worksop in the south to near Richmond in the north. The geology gives rise to a particularly flower-rich limestone grassland which still exists in areas unsuitable for cultivation, whilst alluvial soils and clays are found in the river valley bottoms. This outcrop of limestone was used to construct many of the older houses in the village.

===Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve===
Adjacent to the village is Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve, , with a Visitor Centre.
== History ==
The name of Fairburn was first attested around 1030, as &quot;Faren-burne&quot;. This name comes from the Old English words &quot;fearn&quot; (&#x27;fern&#x27;) and &quot;burna&quot; (&#x27;spring, stream&#x27;), and thus meant &#x27;spring characterised by ferns&#x27;.

Fairburn was historically a township in the ancient parish of Ledsham in the wapentake of Barkston Ash in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The township became a separate civil parish in 1866. In 1974 Fairburn was transferred to Selby District in the new county of North Yorkshire. Selby District was abolished in 2023.

==Notable residents==
William Jessop, one of the most prolific engineers of the canal age, was living in Fairburn with his wife Sarah in 1781, as their second son Josias was baptised there on 26 October. They left to move to Newark two or three years later, and Josias went on to become a civil engineer in his own right.

<doc id="149980" wikidata="Q1671598" url="?curid=149980" title="Intrauterine growth restriction">
<text>Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), or fetal growth restriction, is the poor growth of a fetus while in the womb during pregnancy. IUGR is defined by clinical features of malnutrition and evidence of reduced growth regardless of an infant&#x27;s birth weight percentile. The causes of IUGR are broad and may involve maternal, fetal, or placental complications.

At least 60% of the 4 million neonatal deaths that occur worldwide every year are associated with low birth weight (LBW), caused by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), preterm delivery, and genetic abnormalities, demonstrating that under-nutrition is already a leading health problem at birth.

Intrauterine growth restriction can result in a baby being small for gestational age (SGA), which is most commonly defined as a weight below the 10th percentile for the gestational age. At the end of pregnancy, it can result in a low birth weight.

==Types==
There are two major categories of IUGR: pseudo IUGR and true IUGR

With pseudo IUGR, the fetus has a birth weight below the tenth percentile for the corresponding gestational age but has a normal ponderal index, subcutaneous fat deposition, and body proportion. Pseudo IUGR occurs due to uneventful intrauterine course and can be rectified by proper postnatal care and nutrition. Such babies are also called small for gestational age.

True IUGR occurs due to pathological conditions which may be either fetal or maternal in origin. In addition to low body weight they have abnormal ponderal index, body disproportion, and low subcutaneous fat deposition. There are two types-symmetrical and asymmetrical. Some conditions are associated with both symmetrical and asymmetrical growth restriction.

===Asymmetrical===
Asymmetrical IUGR accounts for 70-80% of all IUGR cases. In asymmetrical IUGR, there is decreased oxygen or nutrient supply to the fetus during the third trimester of pregnancy due to placental insufficiency. This type of IUGR is sometimes called &quot;head sparing&quot; because brain growth is typically less affected, resulting in a relatively normal head circumference in these children. Because of decreased oxygen supply to the fetus, blood is diverted to the vital organs, such as the brain and heart. As a result, blood flow to other organs - including liver, muscle, and fat - is decreased. This causes abdominal circumference in these children to be decreased.

A lack of subcutaneous fat leads to a thin and small body out of proportion with the liver. Normally at birth the brain of the fetus is 3 times the weight of its liver. In IUGR, it becomes 5-6 times. In these cases, the embryo/fetus has grown normally for the first two trimesters but encounters difficulties in the third, sometimes secondary to complications such as pre-eclampsia. Other symptoms than the disproportion include dry, peeling skin and an overly-thin umbilical cord. The baby is at increased risk of hypoxia and hypoglycemia. This type of IUGR is most commonly caused by extrinsic factors that affect the fetus at later gestational ages. Specific causes include:
* Chronic high blood pressure
* Severe malnutrition
* Genetic mutations, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome

===Symmetrical===
Symmetrical IUGR is commonly known as global growth restriction, and indicates that the fetus has developed slowly throughout the duration of the pregnancy and was thus affected from a very early stage. The head circumference of such a newborn is in proportion to the rest of the body. Since most neurons are developed by the 18th week of gestation, the fetus with symmetrical IUGR is more likely to have permanent neurological sequelae. Common causes include:
* Early intrauterine infections, such as cytomegalovirus, rubella or toxoplasmosis
* Chromosomal abnormalities
* Anemia
* Maternal substance use (prenatal alcohol use can result in Fetal alcohol syndrome)

==Causes==
IUGR is caused by a variety of factors; these can be fetal, maternal, placental or genetic factors.

===Maternal===
* Pre-pregnancy weight and nutritional status
* Poor weight gain during pregnancy
* Malnutrition
* Anemia
* Substance use: smoking, alcohol, drugs including marijuana or cocaine
* Medication: warfarin, steroids, anticonvulsants
* Inter-pregnancy interval of less than 6 months
* Assisted reproductive technologies
* Pre-gestational diabetes
* Gestational diabetes
* Pulmonary disease
* Cardiovascular disease
* Kidney disease
* Hypertension
* Celiac disease increases the risk of intrauterine growth restriction by an odds ratio of approximately 2.48
* Subclinical hypothyroidism
* Blood clotting disorder/disease (e.g., Factor V Leiden)

===Uteroplacental===
* Preeclampsia
* Multiple gestation
* Uterine malformations
* Placental insufficiency

===Fetal===
* Chromosomal abnormalities
* Vertically transmitted infections: TORCH, Malaria, congenital HIV infection, Syphilis
* Erythroblastosis fetalis
* Congenital abnormalities

=== Genetic ===
* Placental genes
* Maternal genes: Endothelin-1 over-expression, Leptin under-expression
* Fetal genes

==Pathophysiology==
If the cause of IUGR is extrinsic to the fetus (parental or uteroplacental), transfer of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus is decreased. This causes a reduction in the fetus&#x27; stores of glycogen and lipids. This often leads to hypoglycemia at birth. Polycythemia can occur secondary to increased erythropoietin production caused by the chronic hypoxemia. Hypothermia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, hypocalcemia, and bleeding in the lungs are often results of IUGR.

Infants with IUGR are at increased risk of perinatal asphyxia due to chronic hypoxia, usually associated with placental insufficiency, placental abruption, or a umbilical cord accident. This chronic hypoxia also places IUGR infants at elevated risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, which can impair an infant&#x27;s blood oxygenation and transition to postnatal circulation.

If the cause of IUGR is intrinsic to the fetus, growth is restricted due to genetic factors or as a sequela of infection. IUGR is associated with a wide range of short- and long-term neurodevelopmental disorders.

=== Cardiovascular ===
In IUGR, there is an increase in vascular resistance in the placental circulation, causing an increase in cardiac afterload. There is also increased vasoconstriction of the arteries in the periphery, which occurs in response to chronic hypoxia in order to preserve adequate blood flow to the fetus&#x27; vital organs. This prolonged vasoconstriction leads to remodeling and stiffening of the arteries, which also contributes to the increase in cardiac afterload. Therefore, the fetal heart must work harder to contract during each heartbeat, which leads to an increase in wall stress and cardiac hypertrophy. These changes in the fetal heart lead to increased long-term risk of hypertension, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.

=== Pulmonary ===
Normal lung development is interrupted in fetuses with IUGR, which increases their risk for respiratory compromise and impaired lung function later in life. Preterm infants with IUGR are more likely to have bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease that is thought to be associated with prolonged use of mechanical ventilation.

===Neurological===
IUGR is associated with long-term motor deficits and cognitive impairment. In order to adapt to the chronic hypoxia associated with placental insufficiency, blood flow is redirected to the brain to try to preserve brain growth and development as much as possible. Even though this is thought to be protective, fetuses with IUGR who have undergone this brain-sparing adaptation have worse neurological outcomes compared with those who have not undergone this adaptation.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect changes in volume and structural development of infants with IUGR compared with those whose growth is appropriate for gestational age (AGA). But MRI is not easily accessible for all patients.

White matter effects – In postpartum studies of infants, it was shown that there was a decrease of the fractal dimension of the white matter in IUGR infants at one year corrected age. This was compared to at term and preterm infants at one year adjusted corrected age.

Grey matter effects – Grey matter was also shown to be decreased in infants with IUGR at one year corrected age.

Children with IUGR are often found to exhibit brain reorganization including neural circuitry. Reorganization has been linked to learning and memory differences between children born at term and those born with IUGR.

Studies have shown that children born with IUGR had lower IQ. They also exhibit other deficits that point to frontal lobe dysfunction.

IUGR infants with brain-sparing show accelerated maturation of the hippocampus which is responsible for memory. This accelerated maturation can often lead to uncharacteristic development that may compromise other networks and lead to memory and learning deficiencies.

==Management==
Mothers whose fetus is diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction can be managed with several monitoring and delivery methods. It is currently recommended that any fetus that has growth restriction and additional structural abnormalities should be evaluated with genetic testing. In addition to evaluating the fetal growth velocity, the fetus should primarily be monitored by ultrasonography every 3–4 weeks. An additional monitoring technique is an Doppler velocimetry. Doppler velocimetry is useful in monitoring blood flow through the uterine and umbilical arteries, and may indicate signs of uteroplacental insufficiency. This method may also detect blood vessels, specifically the ductus venosus and middle cerebral arteries, which are not developing properly or may not adapt well after birth. Monitoring via Doppler velocimetry has been shown to decrease the risk of morbidity and mortality before and after parturition among IUGR patients. Standard fetal surveillance via nonstress tests and/or biophysical profile scoring is also recommended. Bed rest has not been found to improve outcomes and is not typically recommended. There is currently a lack of evidence supporting any dietary or supplemental changes that may prevent the development of IUGR.

The optimal timing of delivery for a fetus with IUGR is unknown. However, the timing of delivery is currently based on the cause of IUGR and parameters collected from the umbilical artery doppler. Some of these include: pulsatility index, resistance index, and end-diastolic velocities, which are measurements of the fetal circulation. Fetuses with an anticipated delivery before 34 weeks gestation are recommended to receive corticosteroids to facilitate fetal maturation. Anticipated births before 32 weeks should receive magnesium sulfate to protect development of the fetal brain.

==Outcomes==

=== Postnatal complications ===

After correcting for several factors such as low gestational parental weight, it is estimated that only around 3% of pregnancies are affected by true IUGR. 20% of stillborn infants exhibit IUGR. Perinatal mortality rates are 4-8 times higher for infants with IUGR, and morbidity is present in 50% of surviving infants. Common causes of mortality in fetuses/infants with IUGR include: severe placental insufficiency and chronic hypoxia, congenital malformations, congenital infections, placental abruption, cord accidents, cord prolapse, placental infarcts, and severe perinatal depression.

IUGR is more common in preterm infants than in full term (37–40 weeks gestation) infants, and its frequency decreases with increasing gestational age. Relative to premature infants who do not exhibit IUGR, premature infants with IUGR are more likely to have adverse neonatal outcomes, including respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. This association with prematurity suggests utility of screening for IUGR as a potential risk factor for preterm labor.

Feeding intolerance, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia are all common in infants in the postnatal period, indicating the need to closely manage these patients&#x27; temperature and nutrition. Furthermore, rapid metabolic and physiologic changes in the first few days after birth can yield susceptibility to hypocalcemia, polycythemia, immunologic compromise, and renal dysfunction.

=== Long-term consequences ===
According to the theory of thrifty phenotype, intrauterine growth restriction triggers epigenetic responses in the fetus that are otherwise activated in times of chronic food shortage. If the offspring actually develops in an environment where food is readily accessible, it may be more prone to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type II diabetes.

Infants with IUGR may continue to show signs of abnormal growth throughout childhood. Infants with asymmetric IUGR (head-sparing) typically have more robust catch-up postnatal growth, as compared with infants with symmetric IUGR, who may remain small throughout life. The majority of catch-up growth occurs in the first 6 months of life, but can continue throughout the first two years. Approximately 10% of infants who are small for gestational age due to IUGR will still have short stature in late childhood.

Infants with IUGR are also at elevated risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including motor delay and cognitive impairments. Low IQ in adulthood may occur in up to one third of infants born small for gestational age due to IUGR. Infants who fail to display adequate catch-up growth in the first few years of life may exhibit worse outcomes.

Catch-up growth can alter fat distribution in children diagnosed with IUGR as infants and increase risk of metabolic syndrome. Infants with IUGR may be susceptible to long-term dysfunction of several endocrine processes, including growth hormone signaling, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and puberty. Renal dysfunction, disrupted lung development, and impaired bone metabolism are also associated with IUGR.

==Animals==
In sheep, intrauterine growth restriction can be caused by heat stress in early to mid pregnancy. The effect is attributed to reduced placental development causing reduced fetal growth. Hormonal effects appear implicated in the reduced placental development. Although early reduction of placental development is not accompanied by concurrent reduction of fetal growth; it tends to limit fetal growth later in gestation. Normally, ovine placental mass increases until about day 70 of gestation, but high demand on the placenta for fetal growth occurs later. (For example, research results suggest that a normal average singleton Suffolk x Targhee sheep fetus has a mass of about 0.15 kg at day 70, and growth rates of about 31 g/day at day 80, 129 g/day at day 120 and 199 g/day at day 140 of gestation, reaching a mass of about 6.21 kg at day 140, a few days before parturition.)

In adolescent ewes (i.e. ewe hoggets), overfeeding during pregnancy can also cause intrauterine growth restriction, by altering nutrient partitioning between dam and conceptus. Fetal growth restriction in adolescent ewes overnourished during early to mid pregnancy is not avoided by switching to lower nutrient intake after day 90 of gestation; whereas such switching at day 50 does result in greater placental growth and enhanced pregnancy outcome. Practical implications include the importance of estimating a threshold for &quot;overnutrition&quot; in management of pregnant ewe hoggets. In a study of Romney and Coopworth ewe hoggets bred to Perendale rams, feeding to approximate a conceptus-free live mass gain of 0.15 kg/day (i.e. in addition to conceptus mass), commencing 13 days after the midpoint of a synchronized breeding period, yielded no reduction in lamb birth mass, where compared with feeding treatments yielding conceptus-free live mass gains of about 0 and 0.075 kg/day.
In both of the above models of IUGR in sheep, the absolute magnitude of uterine blood flow is reduced. Evidence of substantial reduction of placental glucose transport capacity has been observed in pregnant ewes that had been heat-stressed during placental development.

<text>Farnley is a village and civil parish in the Harrogate district of North Yorkshire, England, near Otley, West Yorkshire. The name &quot;Farnley&quot; indicates that the village was first established in an area heavy with ferns. It is mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Fernelai&quot; and &quot;Fernelie&quot;.

To the south of the village lies Farnley Hall, a stately home built by John Carr. The house has a rich history, being associated with names such as Fairfax, Cromwell, and Turner. A selection of Turner&#x27;s works from the Farnley Hall collection were sold in 1890 for £25,000.

The primary school in Farnley is occasionally used as a location for filming the soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot;.

When found as a surname the most popular is Fearnley; other surnames related to the area are Farnely, Farnley and Fernleigh.

<doc id="149984" wikidata="Q1056809" url="?curid=149984" title="Wiener process">
<text>In mathematics, the Wiener process (or Brownian motion, due to its historical connection with the physical process of the same name) is a real-valued continuous-time stochastic process discovered by Norbert Wiener. It is one of the best known Lévy processes (càdlàg stochastic processes with stationary independent increments). It occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, economics, quantitative finance, evolutionary biology, and physics.

The Wiener process plays an important role in both pure and applied mathematics. In pure mathematics, the Wiener process gave rise to the study of continuous time martingales. It is a key process in terms of which more complicated stochastic processes can be described. As such, it plays a vital role in stochastic calculus, diffusion processes and even potential theory. It is the driving process of Schramm–Loewner evolution. In applied mathematics, the Wiener process is used to represent the integral of a white noise Gaussian process, and so is useful as a model of noise in electronics engineering (see Brownian noise), instrument errors in filtering theory and disturbances in control theory.

The Wiener process has applications throughout the mathematical sciences. In physics it is used to study Brownian motion and other types of diffusion via the Fokker–Planck and Langevin equations. It also forms the basis for the rigorous path integral formulation of quantum mechanics (by the Feynman–Kac formula, a solution to the Schrödinger equation can be represented in terms of the Wiener process) and the study of eternal inflation in physical cosmology. It is also prominent in the mathematical theory of finance, in particular the Black–Scholes option pricing model.

== Characterisations of the Wiener process ==
The Wiener process &quot;formula_1&quot; is characterised by the following properties:

#formula_2 almost surely
#formula_3 has independent increments: for every formula_4 the future increments formula_5 formula_6 are independent of the past values formula_7, formula_8 
#formula_3 has Gaussian increments: formula_10 is normally distributed with mean formula_11 and variance formula_12, formula_13
#formula_3 has almost surely continuous paths: formula_1 is almost surely continuous in formula_16.

That the process has independent increments means that if then and are independent random variables, and the similar condition holds for &quot;n&quot; increments.

An alternative characterisation of the Wiener process is the so-called &quot;Lévy characterisation&quot; that says that the Wiener process is an almost surely continuous martingale with and quadratic variation (which means that is also a martingale).

A third characterisation is that the Wiener process has a spectral representation as a sine series whose coefficients are independent &quot;N&quot;(0, 1) random variables. This representation can be obtained using the Karhunen–Loève theorem.

Another characterisation of a Wiener process is the definite integral (from time zero to time &quot;t&quot;) of a zero mean, unit variance, delta correlated (&quot;white&quot;) Gaussian process.

The Wiener process can be constructed as the scaling limit of a random walk, or other discrete-time stochastic processes with stationary independent increments. This is known as Donsker&#x27;s theorem. Like the random walk, the Wiener process is recurrent in one or two dimensions (meaning that it returns almost surely to any fixed neighborhood of the origin infinitely often) whereas it is not recurrent in dimensions three and higher (where a multidimensional Wiener process is a process such that its coordinates are independent Wiener processes). Unlike the random walk, it is scale invariant, meaning that
formula_17
is a Wiener process for any nonzero constant . The Wiener measure is the probability law on the space of continuous functions , with , induced by the Wiener process. An integral based on Wiener measure may be called a Wiener integral.

==Wiener process as a limit of random walk==
Let formula_18 be i.i.d. random variables with mean 0 and variance 1. For each &quot;n&quot;, define a continuous time stochastic process
formula_19
This is a random step function. Increments of formula_20 are independent because the formula_21 are independent. For large &quot;n&quot;, formula_22 is close to formula_23 by the central limit theorem. Donsker&#x27;s theorem asserts that as formula_24, formula_20 approaches a Wiener process, which explains the ubiquity of Brownian motion.

== Properties of a one-dimensional Wiener process ==
=== Basic properties ===
The unconditional probability density function follows a normal distribution with mean = 0 and variance = &quot;t&quot;, at a fixed time :
formula_26

The expectation is zero:
formula_27

The variance, using the computational formula, is :
formula_28

These results follow immediately from the definition that increments have a normal distribution, centered at zero. Thus
formula_29

=== Covariance and correlation ===
The covariance and correlation (where formula_30):
formula_31

These results follow from the definition that non-overlapping increments are independent, of which only the property that they are uncorrelated is used. Suppose that formula_32.
formula_33

Substituting
formula_34
we arrive at:
formula_35

Since formula_36 and formula_37 are independent,
formula_38

Thus
formula_39

A corollary useful for simulation is that we can write, for :
formula_40
where is an independent standard normal variable.

=== Wiener representation ===
Wiener (1923) also gave a representation of a Brownian path in terms of a random Fourier series. If formula_41 are independent Gaussian variables with mean zero and variance one, then
formula_42
and
formula_43
represent a Brownian motion on formula_44. The scaled process
formula_45
is a Brownian motion on formula_46 (cf. Karhunen–Loève theorem).

=== Running maximum ===
The joint distribution of the running maximum
formula_47
and is
formula_48

To get the unconditional distribution of formula_49, integrate over :
formula_50

the probability density function of a Half-normal distribution. The expectation is
formula_51

If at time formula_16 the Wiener process has a known value formula_53, it is possible to calculate the conditional probability distribution of the maximum in interval formula_54 (cf. Probability distribution of extreme points of a Wiener stochastic process). The cumulative probability distribution function of the maximum value, conditioned by the known value formula_1, is:
formula_56

=== Self-similarity ===
==== Brownian scaling ====
For every the process formula_57 is another Wiener process.

==== Time reversal ====
The process formula_58 for is distributed like for .

==== Time inversion ====
The process formula_59 is another Wiener process.

==== Projective invariance ====
Consider a Wiener process formula_60, formula_61, conditioned so that formula_62 (which holds almost surely) and as usual formula_63. Then the following are all Wiener processes :
formula_64
Thus the Wiener process is invariant under the projective group PSL(2,R), being invariant under the generators of the group. The action of an element formula_65 is
formula_66
which defines a group action, in the sense that formula_67

==== Conformal invariance in two dimensions ====
Let formula_60 be a two-dimensional Wiener process, regarded as a complex-valued process with formula_69. Let formula_70 be an open set containing 0, and formula_71 be associated Markov time:
formula_72
If formula_73 is a holomorphic function which is not constant, such that formula_74, then formula_75 is a time-changed Wiener process in formula_76 . More precisely, the process formula_77 is Wiener in formula_78 with the Markov time formula_79 where
formula_80
formula_81
formula_82

=== A class of Brownian martingales ===
If a polynomial satisfies the partial differential equation
formula_83
then the stochastic process
formula_84
is a martingale.

Example: formula_85 is a martingale, which shows that the quadratic variation of &quot;W&quot; on is equal to . It follows that the expected time of first exit of &quot;W&quot; from (−&quot;c&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) is equal to .

More generally, for every polynomial the following stochastic process is a martingale:

Example: formula_88 formula_89 the process

=== Some properties of sample paths ===
The set of all functions &quot;w&quot; with these properties is of full Wiener measure. That is, a path (sample function) of the Wiener process has all these properties almost surely.

==== Qualitative properties ====
* For every ε &gt; 0, the function &quot;w&quot; takes both (strictly) positive and (strictly) negative values on (0, ε).
* The function &quot;w&quot; is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere (like the Weierstrass function).
* For any formula_93, formula_94 is almost surely not formula_95-Hölder continuous, and almost surely formula_96-Hölder continuous.
* Points of local maximum of the function &quot;w&quot; are a dense countable set; the maximum values are pairwise different; each local maximum is sharp in the following sense: if &quot;w&quot; has a local maximum at then formula_97 The same holds for local minima.
* The function &quot;w&quot; has no points of local increase, that is, no &quot;t&quot; &gt; 0 satisfies the following for some ε in (0, &quot;t&quot;): first, &quot;w&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) ≤ &quot;w&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) for all &quot;s&quot; in (&quot;t&quot; − ε, &quot;t&quot;), and second, &quot;w&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) ≥ &quot;w&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) for all &quot;s&quot; in (&quot;t&quot;, &quot;t&quot; + ε). (Local increase is a weaker condition than that &quot;w&quot; is increasing on (&quot;t&quot; − &quot;ε&quot;, &quot;t&quot; + &quot;ε&quot;).) The same holds for local decrease.
* The function &quot;w&quot; is of unbounded variation on every interval.
* The quadratic variation of &quot;w&quot; over [0,&quot;t&quot;] is &quot;t&quot;. 
* Zeros of the function &quot;w&quot; are a nowhere dense perfect set of Lebesgue measure 0 and Hausdorff dimension 1/2 (therefore, uncountable).

===== Modulus of continuity =====
Local modulus of continuity:

Global modulus of continuity (Lévy):
formula_100

===== Dimension doubling theorem =====
The dimension doubling theorems say that the Hausdorff dimension of a set under a Brownian motion doubles almost surely.

==== Local time ====
The image of the Lebesgue measure on [0, &quot;t&quot;] under the map &quot;w&quot; (the pushforward measure) has a density . Thus,
formula_101
for a wide class of functions &quot;f&quot; (namely: all continuous functions; all locally integrable functions; all non-negative measurable functions). The density &quot;Lt&quot; is (more exactly, can and will be chosen to be) continuous. The number &quot;Lt&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is called the local time at &quot;x&quot; of &quot;w&quot; on [0, &quot;t&quot;]. It is strictly positive for all &quot;x&quot; of the interval (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are the least and the greatest value of &quot;w&quot; on [0, &quot;t&quot;], respectively. (For &quot;x&quot; outside this interval the local time evidently vanishes.) Treated as a function of two variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;t&quot;, the local time is still continuous. Treated as a function of &quot;t&quot; (while &quot;x&quot; is fixed), the local time is a singular function corresponding to a nonatomic measure on the set of zeros of &quot;w&quot;.

These continuity properties are fairly non-trivial. Consider that the local time can also be defined (as the density of the pushforward measure) for a smooth function. Then, however, the density is discontinuous, unless the given function is monotone. In other words, there is a conflict between good behavior of a function and good behavior of its local time. In this sense, the continuity of the local time of the Wiener process is another manifestation of non-smoothness of the trajectory.

=== Information rate ===
The information rate of the Wiener process with respect to the squared error distance, i.e. its quadratic rate-distortion function, is given by 
formula_102
Therefore, it is impossible to encode formula_103 using a binary code of less than formula_104 bits and recover it with expected mean squared error less than formula_78. On the other hand, for any formula_106, there exists formula_107 large enough and a binary code of no more than formula_108 distinct elements such that the expected mean squared error in recovering formula_103 from this code is at most formula_110.

In many cases, it is impossible to encode the Wiener process without sampling it first. When the Wiener process is sampled at intervals formula_111 before applying a binary code to represent these samples, the optimal trade-off between code rate formula_112 and expected mean square error formula_78 (in estimating the continuous-time Wiener process) follows the parametric representation 
formula_114
formula_115
where formula_116 and formula_117. In particular, formula_118 is the mean squared error associated only with the sampling operation (without encoding).

== Related processes ==


The stochastic process defined by
formula_119
is called a Wiener process with drift μ and infinitesimal variance σ2. These processes exhaust continuous Lévy processes, which means that they are the only continuous Lévy processes,
as a consequence of the Lévy–Khintchine representation. 

Two random processes on the time interval [0, 1] appear, roughly speaking, when conditioning the Wiener process to vanish on both ends of [0,1]. With no further conditioning, the process takes both positive and negative values on [0, 1] and is called Brownian bridge. Conditioned also to stay positive on (0, 1), the process is called Brownian excursion. In both cases a rigorous treatment involves a limiting procedure, since the formula &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot;|&quot;B&quot;) = &quot;P&quot;(&quot;A&quot; ∩ &quot;B&quot;)/&quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) does not apply when &quot;P&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) = 0.

A geometric Brownian motion can be written
formula_120

It is a stochastic process which is used to model processes that can never take on negative values, such as the value of stocks.

The stochastic process
formula_121
is distributed like the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process with parameters formula_122, formula_123, and formula_124.

The time of hitting a single point &quot;x&quot; &gt; 0 by the Wiener process is a random variable with the Lévy distribution. The family of these random variables (indexed by all positive numbers &quot;x&quot;) is a left-continuous modification of a Lévy process. The right-continuous modification of this process is given by times of first exit from closed intervals [0, &quot;x&quot;].

The local time of a Brownian motion describes the time that the process spends at the point &quot;x&quot;. Formally
formula_125
where &quot;δ&quot; is the Dirac delta function. The behaviour of the local time is characterised by Ray–Knight theorems.

=== Brownian martingales ===
Let &quot;A&quot; be an event related to the Wiener process (more formally: a set, measurable with respect to the Wiener measure, in the space of functions), and &quot;Xt&quot; the conditional probability of &quot;A&quot; given the Wiener process on the time interval [0, &quot;t&quot;] (more formally: the Wiener measure of the set of trajectories whose concatenation with the given partial trajectory on [0, &quot;t&quot;] belongs to &quot;A&quot;). Then the process &quot;Xt&quot; is a continuous martingale. Its martingale property follows immediately from the definitions, but its continuity is a very special fact – a special case of a general theorem stating that all Brownian martingales are continuous. A Brownian martingale is, by definition, a martingale adapted to the Brownian filtration; and the Brownian filtration is, by definition, the filtration generated by the Wiener process.

=== Integrated Brownian motion ===
The time-integral of the Wiener process
formula_126
is called integrated Brownian motion or integrated Wiener process. It arises in many applications and can be shown to have the distribution &quot;N&quot;(0, &quot;t&quot;3/3), calculated using the fact that the covariance of the Wiener process is formula_127.

For the general case of the process defined by 
formula_128
Then, for formula_129,
formula_130
formula_131
In fact, formula_132 is always a zero mean normal random variable. This allows for simulation of formula_133 given formula_132 by taking
formula_135
where &quot;Z&quot; is a standard normal variable and
formula_136
formula_137
The case of formula_138 corresponds to formula_139. All these results can be seen as direct consequences of Itô isometry.
The &quot;n&quot;-times-integrated Wiener process is a zero-mean normal variable with variance formula_140. This is given by the Cauchy formula for repeated integration.

=== Time change ===
Every continuous martingale (starting at the origin) is a time changed Wiener process.

Example: 2&quot;W&quot;&quot;t&quot; = &quot;V&quot;(4&quot;t&quot;) where &quot;V&quot; is another Wiener process (different from &quot;W&quot; but distributed like &quot;W&quot;).

Example. formula_141 where formula_142 and &quot;V&quot; is another Wiener process.

In general, if &quot;M&quot; is a continuous martingale then formula_143 where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the quadratic variation of &quot;M&quot; on [0, &quot;t&quot;], and &quot;V&quot; is a Wiener process.

Corollary. (See also Doob&#x27;s martingale convergence theorems) Let &quot;Mt&quot; be a continuous martingale, and
formula_144
formula_145

Then only the following two cases are possible:
formula_146
formula_147
other cases (such as formula_148   formula_149 etc.) are of probability 0.

Especially, a nonnegative continuous martingale has a finite limit (as &quot;t&quot; → ∞) almost surely.

All stated (in this subsection) for martingales holds also for local martingales.

=== Change of measure ===
A wide class of continuous semimartingales (especially, of diffusion processes) is related to the Wiener process via a combination of time change and change of measure.

Using this fact, the qualitative properties stated above for the Wiener process can be generalized to a wide class of continuous semimartingales.

=== Complex-valued Wiener process ===
The complex-valued Wiener process may be defined as a complex-valued random process of the form formula_150 where formula_151 and formula_152 are independent Wiener processes (real-valued). In other words, it is the 2-dimensional Wiener process, where we identify formula_153 with formula_154.

==== Self-similarity ====
Brownian scaling, time reversal, time inversion: the same as in the real-valued case.

Rotation invariance: for every complex number formula_155 such that formula_156 the process formula_157 is another complex-valued Wiener process.

==== Time change ====
If formula_158 is an entire function then the process formula_159 is a time-changed complex-valued Wiener process.

Example: formula_160 where
formula_161
and formula_162 is another complex-valued Wiener process.

In contrast to the real-valued case, a complex-valued martingale is generally not a time-changed complex-valued Wiener process. For example, the martingale formula_163 is not (here formula_151 and formula_152 are independent Wiener processes, as before).

=== Brownian sheet ===

The Brownian sheet is a multiparamateric generalization. The definition varies from authors, some define the Brownian sheet to have specifically a two-dimensional time parameter formula_16 while others define it for general dimensions.

<doc id="149985" wikidata="Q5436035" url="?curid=149985" title="Farnley Hall, West Yorkshire">
<text>Farnley Hall is a stately home in Farnley, west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is a grade II listed building. It was built in Elizabethan times by the Danbys. The manor is recorded in the 1086 Domesday Book as &quot;Fernelei&quot;, so it is probable that this house was a replacement for earlier medieval structures.

The Danbys owned part of the manor and the hall until 1799, when it was sold to James Armitage. Thomas Danby was first Mayor of Leeds, and Thomas Danby College in Leeds was named after him. The Hall was acquired by the Leeds City Council in 1945 and its grounds were turned into a park. The hall is used as the headquarters of the council&#x27;s Parks and Countryside Service and is home to Farnley Hall Park.

Part of the 16th-century house still exists. In the early 19th century a classical front was added. There are gateposts probably dating to the 19th century to the south of the hall at the end of the woodland.

Farnley Parish Church, built in 1885 and dedicated to St Michael, stands across the park from the hall. It replaced an 18th-century building, attributed to John Carr. The classical belfry from this chapel is extant in the churchyard. A chapel is known on this site from 1240. The chapel at Farnley had a historic dedication to St Helen, and a well dedicated to the saint was extant in the village of Farnley until the 1950s when the site was developed for housing by Leeds city council. Remains of medieval tracery used to be preserved in the interior of the church. In October 2011, the church was bought by Saint Makarios The Great Ecclesiastical Trust, who converted it for Romanian Orthodox use.

There is a cottage close by, which is several hundred years old and is linked to the park.

==The Danby family==

Sir Thomas Danby (1530–1590) built Farnley hall in 1586. Along with the Danby coat of arms, there is a worn inscription on a stone panel at the rear in an archway which reads “Buildid the year of our Lord 1586 and in the reign of the Queen (? Eliz) bi S Thomas Danby Kn.”. He had married Lady Mary Nevill, the daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland and in 1576 became the High Sheriff of Yorkshire. His son Thomas predeceased him so his grandson Christopher Danby inherited his property.

Christopher Danby (1582–1624) married Francis Parker, daughter of Sir Edward Parker, 12th Baron Morley. When he died in 1624 he was succeeded by his son Sir Thomas Danby (1610–1660) who was a Colonel in the Royal Army and Sheriff of Yorkshire. He married Katherine Wandesford, daughter of Christopher Wandesford, Lord-Deputy of Ireland. When he died in 1660 the Hall passed to his son Thomas Danby (1631–1667) who was the first Mayor of Leeds. His children died young so the property was inherited by his brother Christopher Danby (1636–1689). He married Anne Colepepper, daughter of Colonel Edward Colepepper. His successor was his son Sir Abstrupus Danby.

Sir Abstrupus Danby (1655–1727) was a Member Parliament. He married Judith Moone, daughter of Abraham Moone of Great, St Helen&#x27;s. Although he possessed numerous manors Sir Abstrupus chose to live at Farnley Hall. The University of Victoria in Canada holds a book written by Sir Anstrupus which is a collection of medical remedies which he considered useful for the benefit of his family. In 1695 he built a house at Swinton Park and this property then was also passed through the succeeding generations of the Danby family.

Sir Abstrupus Danby was succeeded when he died in 1727 by his son Abstrupus Danby (1680–1750) who married twice. His first wife was Eliza Ingram whom he married in 1709 and after she died he married Battina Euston. His son William Danby (1712–1784) by his first wife inherited the house in 1750. He married Margaret Affleck daughter of Gilbert Affleck of Dalham, Suffolk and was succeeded in 1784 by his only son William Danby (1752–1833).

This William Danby lived mainly in the other family house of Swinton Park. He was born in 1752 and in married twice. First to Caroline, daughter of Henry Seymour, and secondly to Anne Holwell, second daughter of William Gater. He was a writer and published several books which are still available. He was the friend and patron of the famous artist Julius Caesar Ibbetson who painted his portrait which is shown. He was the last of the Danby family to own Farnley Hall and in 1799 he sold it to James Armitage.

==The Armitage family==

James Armitage (1730–1803) who bought the Hall from the Danby family was a very prosperous wool merchant in Leeds. He was succeeded by his son, Edward Armitage (1764–1829), who in 1806 built a new driveway and refronted the building to include a grand portico supported by Tuscan columns. He also added a new bath house and a large conservatory with adjoining billiard room. Edward was born in 1764 in Leeds and in 1787 he married Sarah Leathley (1768–1847). In his will, he left his estate to his widow, Sarah for life, and gave her power to determine how it should be apportioned between their four surviving sons. Until 1843 she let Farnley Hall to her husband&#x27;s nephew, John William Rhodes and when she died she established an unusual arrangement by which her four sons were tenants in common of the Farnley estate. The sons were William Armitage (1798–1883), James Armitage (1793–1872), John Leathley Armitage (1792–1870) and Edward Armitage (1796–1878).

The four brothers became partners in the Farnley Iron Works to exploit the coal, iron and fireclay resources found on the estate. The company expanded rapidly and from 1850 the family developed a new village to house their workers at New Farnley.

The next to inherit Farnley Hall was William James Armitage (1819–1895) who was the third son of James Armitage (1793–1872). He entered the family iron business succeeding his uncle and father as chairman and managing director. In 1860 he married Emily Nicholson eldest daughter of William Nicholson of Roundhay Park. The couple had five sons and one daughter. When he died in 1895 his son Robert Armitage inherited the Hall.

Robert Armitage (1866–1944) was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, University of Cambridge. He was a barrister and later became the Member of Parliament for Central Leeds. In 1905 he was the Lord Mayor of Leeds. He was also involved in the family iron company. He married in 1891 Caroline Katharine Ryder (1867–1933), daughter of Dudley Henry Ryder of Westbrook Hay, Boxmoor. The couple had three sons and four daughters.

He was a personal friend of Lloyd George, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and in 1922 George came to visit him for a weekend at Farnley Hall. The event was widely reported in the newspapers. A photo is shown.

When he died in 1944 his son Robert William Armitage inherited Farnley Hall. In the following year it was sold to Leeds City Council who still own it today.

<doc id="149986" wikidata="Q3307955" url="?curid=149986" title="Red box (phreaking)">
<text>A red box is a phreaking device that generates tones to simulate inserting coins in pay phones, thus fooling the system into completing free calls. In the United States, a nickel is represented by one tone, a dime by two, and a quarter by a set of five. Any device capable of playing back recorded sounds can potentially be used as a red box. Commonly used devices include modified Radio Shack tone dialers, personal MP3 players, and audio-recording greeting cards.

==History==

The term &quot;red box&quot; to refer to a phreaking box dates to 1973 or earlier. Red box use became more widespread in the 1990s following the publication in 2600 Magazine of instructions on how to make a red box by replacing a crystal oscillator in a tone dialer. Red boxes grew obsolete in the 2000s as phone systems in the US and other nations updated their signaling technology.

==Technical details==

===United States===
The tones are made by playing back 1700 Hz and 2200 Hz tones together. One 66 ms tone represents a nickel. A set of two 66 ms tones separated by 66 ms intervals represent a dime, and a quarter is represented by a set of five 33 ms tones with 33 ms pauses. A single 650 ms tone represents a dollar, but this is rarely used.
The system that handles these tones is called the Automated Coin Toll Service, or ACTS. However, since ACTS has been phased out of service in much of the United States, combined with the integration of acoustic filters into many payphone handsets, the practice of red boxing is rarely possible any longer.
===Canada===
Canada formerly used a US-style ACTS coin phone system with a tone pair which would beep once for a nickel, twice for a dime and five times on receiving a quarter. These phones did not accept $1 coins (or the later $2 coin) and disappeared with the roll-out of Nortel Millennium payphones in the 1990s. The Millennium sets do not use ACTS in-band signalling tones as all coin-handling is automated in the phone itself.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, a 1000 Hz tone for 200 ms represents a 10p coin, and 1000 Hz for 350 ms represents a 50p coin. Prior to this system, the earliest UK pay-on-answer payphones used a resistance, inserted into the loop for one or several short periods followed by a short flash (complete disconnection), to signal units of money inserted. Phreaks simulated these signals by unscrewing the microphone cover of the handset and inserting into the microphone circuit a resistor in parallel with a press-to-open push-button, getting the timing correct was difficult and failure to do this would result in the relay set controlling the call at the exchange to release, dropping the call. This was hard to do inconspicuously in outdoor payphones, and was more common indoors (e.g., in student halls of residence). Manipulating a telephone in this way was illegal and carried the specific offence of &quot;abstracting electricity&quot; from the GPO (later the Post Office and later still BT.)

<doc id="149988" wikidata="Q5578460" url="?curid=149988" title="Golcar">
<text>Golcar (pronounced ) is a village on a hillside crest above the Colne Valley in the Kirklees district, in West Yorkshire, England, west of Huddersfield, and just north of the River Colne and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal. 

The 2021 population census lists the village as having 18,725 permanent residents. The main transport access is from the A62 (Manchester Road), through Milnsbridge in the valley bottom or via Scapegoat Hill from the A640 (New Hey Road) at the top of the hill.

The township of Golcar consists of Bolster Moor, Golcar, Wellhouse, Pole Moor and Scapegoat Hill.

==History==
Named after St Guthlac, who preached in the area during the 8th century, its name is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Goullakarres&quot;. During the Industrial Revolution Golcar became an important centre for weaving. Pharmacologist James Burrows grew up in the area.

The village has been a site of extensive dialect research. It was first a site in the English Survey of English Dialects, and later a site in the &quot;Atlas Linguarum Europae&quot;.

Golcar was formerly a township and chapelry, in 1866 Golcar became a separate civil parish, in 1894 Golcar became an urban district, on 1 April 1937 the district was abolished to form Colne Valley Urban District, part also went to the County Borough of Huddersfield. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Colne Valley, part also went to Huddersfield. In 1931 the parish had a population of 9812.

==Colne Valley Museum==
Three 1840s weavers&#x27; cottages were converted into the Colne Valley Museum in 1970. The museum has several restored period rooms which are used to show temporary exhibitions. The museum was extended in 2008 following the purchase of the adjoining former fish and chip shop.

Exhibits include a handloom and a spinning jenny, invented by James Hargreaves. In the loom chamber, spinning room, weavers sitting room and &#x27;gas-lit&#x27; cloggers shop, the volunteer helpers give demonstrations of the type of crafts that would have existed during the 19th century.

The museum is run by volunteers and opens at weekends and bank holidays. Various craft and working weekends are held through the year.

==Community facilities==
Golcar supports two scout groups: the 4th Golcar Scout Group, which was founded in 1951 and the 39th Parkwood Scout Group, founded in 1908. The village also supports Girlguiding through the 19th Huddersfield (Golcar Church) Rainbows (formed 1987), Brownies (1941) and Guides (1925). 

The village has several sporting teams. Golcar United F.C who formed in 1904 and currently play in the Northern Counties East Premier Division, their home ground being located on Longfield Avenue. They team is often referred to by fans as simple &quot;The Village&quot; but officially the club nickname is &quot;The Weavers&quot;, referring to the village&#x27;s textile heritage. There are two cricket teams in the village: Golcar who play in the Huddersfield Cricket League and Leymoor who play in the Halifax Cricket League.

The village has three churches, the Anglican Parish Church of St John the Evangelist opened in 1829 and is a good example of a Waterloo church, Golcar Baptist Church (), founded in 1835 and Golcar Providence Methodist Church founded in 1876.

Each year in early May the village hosts the Golcar Lily Day.

Golcar Brass Band () was reformed in 1977 and practises at the Baptist Church on a Monday night.

<doc id="149989" wikidata="Q140696" url="?curid=149989" title="James Hargreaves">
<text>James Hargreaves ( – 22 April 1778) was an English weaver, carpenter and inventor who lived and worked in Lancashire, England. Hargreaves is credited with inventing the spinning jenny in 1764. 

He was one of three men responsible for the mechanisation of spinning: Richard Arkwright patented the water frame in 1769 and Samuel Crompton combined the two, creating the spinning mule in 1779.

==Life and work==
James Hargreaves was born at Stanhill, Oswaldtwistle in Lancashire. He was described as &quot;stout, broadest man of about five-foot ten, or rather more&quot;. He was illiterate and worked as a hand loom weaver during most of his life. He married and baptismal records show he had 13 children, of whom the author Baines in 1835 was aware of &#x27;6 or 7&#x27;.

==Spinning jenny==
 

The idea for the spinning jenny is said to have come when a one-thread spinning wheel was overturned on the floor, and Hargreaves saw both the wheel and the spindle continuing to revolve. He realized that if several spindles were placed upright and side by side, several threads might be spun at once. The spinning jenny was confined to producing cotton weft threads and was unable to produce yarn of sufficient quality for the warp. A high-quality warp was later supplied by Arkwright&#x27;s spinning frame.

Hargreaves built a jenny for himself and sold several of them to his neighbours.
His invention was initially welcomed by other hand spinners until they saw a fall in the price of yarn.

Opposition to the machine caused Hargreaves to leave for Nottingham, where the cotton hosiery industry benefited from the increased provision of suitable yarn. In Nottingham Hargreaves made jennies for a man named Shipley, and on 12 June 1770, he was granted a patent, which provided the basis for legal action (later withdrawn) against the Lancashire manufacturers who had begun using it. With a partner, Thomas James, Hargreaves ran a small mill in Hockley and lived in an adjacent house. The business was carried on until he died in 1778 when his wife received a payment of £400. 

==Legacy==
When Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule in c.1779, he stated he had learned to spin in 1769 on a jenny that Hargreaves had built.

Hargreaves was one of three men responsible for the mechanisation of spinning.

==Dispute over Hargreaves&#x27; contribution==
False claims were being made about Hargreaves as early as 1828, when Richard Guest, writing in the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; in 1828, introduced several errors, and a distorted view of his life and contributions has persisted ever since. Parish burial records show that Hargreaves (misspelt as &quot;Hargraves&quot;) did not die in the workhouse, as had been claimed. 

A ferocious legal battle had been mounted in the 1780s to have Richard Arkwright&#x27;s most important patents annulled. Thomas Highs had claimed that he was the true inventor of both the spinning frame and the spinning jenny. Conflicting evidence as to the circumstances of several inventions was canvassed, and although Arkwright&#x27;s patents were annulled, the question of authorship was not settled. 

Other records show that neither Hargreaves&#x27;s wife nor any of his daughters bore the name Jenny, contrary to a myth repeated in school textbooks as late as the 1960s, children&#x27;s books as late as 2005 and on educational websites to the present day. The &#x27;jenny&#x27; refers to an engine, a common slang term in Lancashire in the 18th century, and encountered occasionally even now.

<text>TV Party is the fourth EP by American band Black Flag, released in 1982. It was self-produced with Ed Barton and originally released by SST Records on the 7&quot; vinyl format. The title track is a satire of boredom, drinking and America&#x27;s obsession with television; the original version was also released on the band&#x27;s 1981 debut album, &quot;Damaged&quot;.

==Production==

The song &quot;TV Party&quot; was recorded three times. To promote the &quot;Damaged&quot; album in the United States, Unicorn Records had Black Flag enter the studio and re-record the song for the EP in March 1982, with their then-new drummer Emil Johnson. The EP version features a slower tempo and hand claps. The band again recorded the song at the request of Alex Cox, for his 1984 cult classic film &quot;Repo Man&quot; and the accompanying soundtrack. Each version of the song lyrically references different TV shows from the era in which each recording was made.

==Style==
&quot;TV Party&quot; is driven by Chuck Dukowski&#x27;s bass line and features Henry Rollins on lead vocals and bellowed backing vocals from band members. The song is light in comparison to other songs from the band&#x27;s &quot;Damaged&quot; era. Black Flag guitarist Greg Ginn has stated that after &quot;Rollins joined the band, we couldn&#x27;t do songs with a sense of humor anymore; he got into the serious way-out poet thing.&quot; Rollins described the song as satire, stating &quot;it&#x27;s about people who stay inside their house and live in a TV kinda world. And this has a very direct effect on us.&quot; Ginn echoed Rollins&#x27;s interpretation, stating &quot;It&#x27;s basically a satire of people watching TV and partying at home, which is a sickness which is very prevalent in LA.&quot;
Glen E. Friedman referred to the song as &quot;a parody of certain type of people&quot;. Comparing the song to the Beastie Boys&#x27; &quot;(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)&quot;, he stated &quot;They were both parodies that people took too seriously, and even the bands were found taking themselves too seriously after the fact.&quot;

==Release==
The &quot;TV Party&quot; EP was released in July 1982. To promote the EP, a music video of &quot;TV Party&quot; was shot featuring the members of Black Flag and their friends drinking beer and calling out their favorite television shows in front of a television set. Among the members is photographer (and the video&#x27;s director) Glen E. Friedman. Target Video also released a home video titled &quot;TV Party&quot;, in 1983, containing live footage of the group from 1980 and 1982 as well as the video of the title track. There have been several variations on the release of the &quot;TV Party&quot; EP. They include one released by SST Records, one as a split between SST and Unicorn Records, and another simply by Unicorn. All three versions have the same track listing. Several different slip covers were also issued. A new version of the song &quot;TV Party&quot; later appeared on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Repo Man&quot; (1984). In the film, Emilio Estevez can be heard singing &quot;TV Party&quot;. The song also appears on other compilation albums.

==Reception==
The title song of the EP received praise from music critics. Online music database AllMusic gave a positive review of the song, describing it as &quot;at once cutting and funny, an attack on television-inspired stasis that laughs both at and with its subjects&quot; and &quot;As a dumb anthem, it even beats out the band&#x27;s cover of &quot;Louie Louie&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; referred to the song as the &quot;greatest ode to the slacker sloth&quot;.

In 1982, &quot;Billboard&quot; listed the song &quot;TV Party&quot; as &quot;Recommended&quot; in their &quot;Top Singles&quot; review section. The website AllMusic would later give the EP a retrospective rating of two and a half stars out of five, stating that &quot;The other tracks are good, but this is a release for collectors or serious fans only.&quot;

<doc id="149992" wikidata="Q3773203" url="?curid=149992" title="Gomersal">
<text>Gomersal is a town in the Kirklees district, in West Yorkshire, England. It is south of Bradford, south west of Leeds. east of Cleckheaton and north of Heckmondwike. It is close to the River Spen and forms part of the Heavy Woollen District.

== History ==

Gomersal was attested in the &quot;Doomes Day Book&quot; (1086) with the name Gomershale. *&quot;Guthmers Halh&quot;, is a supposed place-name, not attested in any written document, hence marked with asterisk in &quot;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names&quot;. The location was at a bend in the brook which passes through the valley bottom before joining with the River Calder. This land became an Anglo-Saxon burial ground and most likely was the location of a Celtic temple site before the Roman Conquest. It became the site of the Parish Church of St Peter and St Paul, now known as St Peters. The brook formed the ancient boundary between Gomersal and Birstall.

The Luddite riots, that occurred in the area in 1812 provided Charlotte Brontë with material for her novel &quot;Shirley&quot;. Gomersal was the hometown of her friend Mary Taylor who lived at the Red House which she renamed &quot;Briarmains&quot; in the novel.

The Taylor Family also lived in Spen Hall, a residence in the Lower Spen area of Gomersal. Spen Hall has been divided into several houses but retains a 16th-century mullioned window, a tennis lawn and a water spring which, according to myth, is a tunnel (now flooded) leading to the Old Saw public house cellar nearby. The cellar was apparently used to hide priests fleeing persecution.

Clay pipes were found in the earlier Old Saw premises in the walls and chimneys but, once exhumed, disintegrated. A glazed drinking cup found in the foundations survives after being carefully reassembled and preserved by Harry King, the former owner of the cottage. The cup still requires dating. A hand-made brick-lined pit deep was also discovered on the site. Its uses are disputed, with suggestions that it was a cockfighting pit or meat storage vessel.

Gomersal also has many fine and historic houses which climb the hill of Spen Lane and along Oxford Road towards Birkenshaw. Houses such as Spen Hall, Spen House (now demolished and rebuilt, except the Coach House), High Rising (High Royd, another Taylor Household) now The Gomersal Hotel, Tanfield House, Firdene (currently on the market for £1.25 million), Hilltop House (now split into two homes with apartment buildings in the grounds), Gomers Hall (apparently, originally Gothmers Hall, which was demolished to build an electricity sub-station), Pollard Hall (home of the mill owner Thomas Burnley), Red House (now Red House Museum), Broadyards, Croft House, Sigston House, Gomersal Hall, Peel House, West House (the last three still privately owned).

The Roundhill Mill site in the Cliffe lane area of Gomersal is known for the sighting of the (pronounced Skrayty), a legendary Norse spirit supposedly observed by a son before the death of his father and characterised by a cold and apparently sourceless light which moves erratically. The old name for Cliffe Lane was Scrat Lane.

Gomersal was heavily wooded up to the late 19th century with Swinley Great Wood, Lanes Wood, Scotland (Fusden) Wood containing the Taylor family burial ground, and Church Wood between the Hill Top and Monk Ings.

During the Second World War, Gomersal had a number of public air raid shelters, with quite a few remaining in 2007 at Birkenshaw roundabout Park, Gomersal First School, Hill Top. This was likely due to the semi-underground control bunker for the anti-aircraft guns in the West Riding, protecting Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and Halifax. The bunker was in the grounds of Oakroyd Hall, making this a target for the German Luftwaffe; Oakroyd Hall is now the headquarters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.

There was also a Royal Observer Corps &quot;Orlit&quot; type surface observation post on the Popeley Fields around from the Gomersal Cricket ground. This was active throughout the war and manned day and night. In the 1960s on the same site a nuclear-blast-proof underground bunker was constructed as a monitoring post, one of over 1,500 constructed in the UK, for use in measuring direction, strength of blast and fallout in the event of the UK coming under nuclear attack. The ROC stood down during the late 1980s with the reduced threat of the Cold War and the bunkers were abandoned and sold or given back to the land owners.

Gomersal was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Birstall, in 1866 Gomersal became a separate civil parish, in 1894 Gomersal became an urban district, on 1 April 1915 the district was abolished to form Spenborough Urban District. On 1 April 1974 the parish was abolished. In 1951 the parish had a population of 7951.

== Railway ==
The Lower Spen area of Gomersal had a railway station, Cleckheaton Spen on the LNWR railway line diversion loop linking Leeds and Manchester and improving the main line capacity between Huddersfield and Leeds. The line was constructed between 1894 and 1902 and opened fully to passengers in 1904. It had some spectacular civil engineering for the time, including rail viaducts at Mirfield and Heckmondwike, a pedestrian road viaduct linking Cleckheaton town centre with the station and goods yard. The Gomersal Tunnel is long and around deep, directly under the Shoulder of Mutton pub in Oxford Road at Great Gomersal (the LNWR bought the pub in 1897 in case it fell into the tunnel workings) and then the line opened into Gomersal Station in Moor Lane, a four-minute train ride from Cleckheaton Spen.

The railway closed to passengers in 1964 and goods in 1966, having had all the buildings and structures repainted and new track in 1963. In 1952, Sir Winston Churchill, then Prime Minister, slept at Cleckheaton Spen sidings overnight in a special train with a heavy security cordon during election campaigning.

== Places of worship ==

Gomersal has a number of places of worship given the size of population, including Gomersal St Mary C of E Church (1851), the Methodist Wesleyan Chapel, Latham Lane 1827, Grove Congregational Chapel in Oxford Road, the Methodist Free United Chapel (off Reform Street), the Primitive Methodist Chapel in Moor Lane, the Moravian Chapel in Little Gomersal and Little Gomersal Methodist Chapel on Town Hill. Most are still in use.

John Wesley preached in Gomersal. One of his closest lay assistants John Nelson was involved with lay preacher Edward Brooke who initiated the construction the Wesleyan Chapel in Latham Lane in 1827. Its unusual bow front led to it being known as the &quot;pork pie chapel&quot;.

== Street and locality names ==

Gomersal also has some interesting street and place names, for example Mazy Brook (Mazebrook), Drub, Birdacre, Bleak Street, Wood Nook, Throstle Nest, Egypt, Worlds End, Fusden Lane, Monk Ings, Nutter Lane, Muffit Lane, Garfit Hill, Nibshaw Lane to name a few.

Gomersal also has a football club, Gomersal &amp; Cleckheaton F.C., ranging from ages 6 to 17 and their traditional colours are red and black stripes.

Gomersal was once home to Burnleys Textile Mill, which was a landmark in the Spenborough area. However, this has been demolished to make way for a new housing development of up to 300 homes. Gomersal has two primary schools; Gomersal Primary School and St Mary&#x27;s First School.

== Notable people ==
The composer Arnold Cooke was born in Gomersal in 1906.

Gomersal is the birthplace of novelist John Barlow, who has set several works of fiction in the village.

== Appearances in media ==

Gomersal was the filming location for a number of scenes in the long-running period drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot;.

<text>A lathe () is a machine tool that rotates a workpiece about an axis of rotation to perform various operations such as cutting, sanding, knurling, drilling, deformation, facing, threading and turning, with tools that are applied to the workpiece to create an object with symmetry about that axis. 

Lathes are used in woodturning, metalworking, metal spinning, thermal spraying, reclamation, and glass-working. Lathes can be used to shape pottery, the best-known design being the Potter&#x27;s wheel. Most suitably equipped metalworking lathes can also be used to produce most solids of revolution, plane surfaces and screw threads or helices. Ornamental lathes can produce three-dimensional solids of incredible complexity. The workpiece is usually held in place by either one or two &quot;centers&quot;, at least one of which can typically be moved horizontally to accommodate varying workpiece lengths. Other work-holding methods include clamping the work about the axis of rotation using a chuck or collet, or to a faceplate, using clamps or dog clutch. Of course, lathes can also complete milling operations by installing special lathe milling fixtures.

Examples of objects that can be produced on a lathe include screws, candlesticks, gun barrels, cue sticks, table legs, bowls, baseball bats, pens, musical instruments (especially woodwind instruments), and crankshafts.

== History ==
The lathe is an ancient tool. The earliest evidence of a lathe dates back to 4th century BC Egypt an is a depiction in the tomb of Petosiris. There is also tenuous evidence for a turned arifact at a Mycenaean Greek site, dating back as far as the 13th or 14th century BC.

Clear evidence of turned artifacts have been found from the 6th century BC: fragments of a wooden bowl in an Etruscan tomb in Northern Italy as well as two flat wooden dishes with decorative turned rims from modern Turkey.

During the Warring States period in China, , the ancient Chinese used rotary lathes to sharpen tools and weapons on an industrial scale.

The first known painting showing a lathe dates to the 4rd century BC in ancient Egypt. Pliny later describes the use of a lathe for turning soft stone in his Natural History (Book XXX, Chapter 44).
Precision metal-cutting lathes were developed during the lead up to the Industrial Revolution and were critical to the manufacture of mechanical inventions of that period. Some of the earliest examples include a version with a mechanical cutting tool-supporting carriage and a set of gears by Russian engineer Andrey Nartov in 1718 and another with a slide-rest shown in a 1717 edition of the French &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The slide-rest was a particularly important development because it constrains the motion of the cutting tool to generate accurate cylindrical or conical surfaces, unlike earlier lathes that involved freehand manipulation of the tool.
By the 1770s, precision lathes became practical and well-known. A slide-rest is clearly shown in a 1772 edition of the Encyclopédie and during that same year a horse-powered cannon boring lathe was installed in the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, England by Jan Verbruggen. Cannon bored by Verbruggen&#x27;s lathe were stronger and more accurate than their predecessors and saw service in American Revolutionary War. Henry Maudslay, the inventor of many subsequent improvements to the lathe worked as an apprentice in Verbruggen&#x27;s workshop in Woolwich.

During the Industrial Revolution, mechanized power generated by water wheels or steam engines was transmitted to the lathe via line shafting, allowing faster and easier work. Metalworking lathes evolved into heavier machines with thicker, more rigid parts. Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, individual electric motors at each lathe replaced line shafting as the power source. Beginning in the 1950s, servomechanisms were applied to the control of lathes and other machine tools via numerical control, which often was coupled with computers to yield computerized numerical control (CNC). Today manually controlled and CNC lathes coexist in the manufacturing industries.

== Design ==
The most common design is known as the universal lathe or parallel lathe. Other general designs include the frontal and vertical lathe, and others.

=== Components ===
A lathe may or may not have legs, which sit on the floor and elevate the lathe bed to a working height. A lathe may be small and sit on a workbench or table, not requiring a stand.

Almost all lathes have a bed, which is almost always a horizontal beam, although CNC lathes commonly have an inclined or vertical beam for a bed to ensure that swarf, or chips, falls free of the bed. Woodturning lathes specialized for turning large bowls often have no bed or tail stock, merely a free-standing headstock and a cantilevered tool-rest.

At one end of the bed (almost always the left, as the operator faces the lathe) is a headstock. The headstock contains high-precision spinning bearings. Rotating within the bearings is a horizontal axle, with an axis parallel to the bed, called the spindle. Spindles are often hollow and have an interior Morse taper on the spindle nose (i.e., facing to the right / towards the bed) by which work-holding accessories may be mounted to the spindle. Spindles may also have arrangements for work-holding on the left-hand end of the spindle with other tooling arrangements for particular tasks. (i.e., facing away from the main bed) end, or may have a hand-wheel or other accessory mechanism on their outboard end. Spindles are powered and impart motion to the workpiece.

The spindle is driven either by foot power from a treadle and flywheel or by a belt or gear drive from a power source such as electric motor or overhead line shafts. In most modern lathes this power source is an integral electric motor, often either in the headstock, to the left of the headstock, or beneath the headstock, concealed in the stand.

In addition to the spindle and its bearings, the headstock often contains parts to convert the motor speed into various spindle speeds. Various types of speed-changing mechanism achieve this, from a cone pulley or step pulley, to a cone pulley with back gear (which is essentially a low range, similar in net effect to the two-speed rear of a truck), to an entire gear train similar to that of a manual-shift automotive transmission. Some motors have electronic rheostat-type speed controls, which obviates cone pulleys or gears.

The counterpoint to the headstock is the tailstock, sometimes referred to as the loose head, as it can be positioned at any convenient point on the bed by sliding it to the required area. The tail-stock contains a barrel, which does not rotate, but can slide in and out parallel to the axis of the bed and directly in line with the headstock spindle. The barrel is hollow and usually contains a taper to facilitate the gripping of various types of tooling. Its most common uses are to hold a hardened steel center, which is used to support long thin shafts while turning, or to hold drill bits for drilling axial holes in the work piece. Many other uses are possible.

Metalworking lathes have a carriage (comprising a saddle and apron) topped with a cross-slide, which is a flat piece that sits crosswise on the bed and can be cranked at right angles to the bed. Sitting atop the cross slide is usually another slide called a compound rest, which provides two additional axes of motion, rotary and linear. Atop that sits a toolpost, which holds a cutting tool, which removes material from the workpiece. There may or may not be a leadscrew, which moves the cross-slide along the bed.

Woodturning and metal spinning lathes do not have cross-slides, but rather have banjos, which are flat pieces that sit crosswise on the bed. The position of a banjo can be adjusted by hand; no gearing is involved. Ascending vertically from the banjo is a tool-post, at the top of which is a horizontal tool-rest. In woodturning, hand tools are braced against the tool-rest and levered into the workpiece. In metal spinning, the further pin ascends vertically from the tool-rest and serves as a fulcrum against which tools may be levered into the workpiece.

=== Accessories ===


Unless a workpiece has a taper machined onto it which perfectly matches the internal taper in the spindle, or has threads which perfectly match the external threads on the spindle (two conditions which rarely exist), an accessory must be used to mount a workpiece to the spindle.

A workpiece may be bolted or screwed to a faceplate, a large, flat disk that mounts to the spindle. In the alternative, faceplate dogs may be used to secure the work to the faceplate.

A workpiece may be mounted on a mandrel, or circular work clamped in a three- or four-jaw chuck. For irregular shaped workpieces it is usual to use a four jaw (independent moving jaws) chuck. These holding devices mount directly to the lathe headstock spindle.

In precision work, and in some classes of repetition work, cylindrical workpieces are usually held in a collet inserted into the spindle and secured either by a draw-bar, or by a collet closing cap on the spindle. Suitable collets may also be used to mount square or hexagonal workpieces. In precision toolmaking work such collets are usually of the draw-in variety, where, as the collet is tightened, the workpiece moves slightly back into the headstock, whereas for most repetition work the dead length variety is preferred, as this ensures that the position of the workpiece does not move as the collet is tightened.

A soft workpiece (e.g., wood) may be pinched between centers by using a spur drive at the headstock, which bites into the wood and imparts torque to it.

A soft dead center is used in the headstock spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a running or live center, as it turns freely with the workpiece—usually on ball bearings—reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.

In woodturning, one variation of a running center is a cup center, which is a cone of metal surrounded by an annular ring of metal that decreases the chances of the workpiece splitting.

A circular metal plate with even spaced holes around the periphery, mounted to the spindle, is called an &quot;index plate&quot;. It can be used to rotate the spindle to a precise angle, then lock it in place, facilitating repeated auxiliary operations done to the workpiece.

Other accessories, including items such as taper turning attachments, knurling tools, vertical slides, fixed and traveling steadies, etc., increase the versatility of a lathe and the range of work it may perform.

=== Modes of use ===

When a workpiece is fixed between the headstock and the tail-stock, it is said to be &quot;between centers&quot;. When a workpiece is supported at both ends, it is more stable, and more force may be applied to the workpiece, via tools, at a right angle to the axis of rotation, without fear that the workpiece may break loose.

When a workpiece is fixed only to the spindle at the headstock end, the work is said to be &quot;face work&quot;. When a workpiece is supported in this manner, less force may be applied to the workpiece, via tools, at a right angle to the axis of rotation, lest the workpiece rip free. Thus, most work must be done axially, towards the headstock, or at right angles, but gently.

When a workpiece is mounted with a certain axis of rotation, worked, then remounted with a new axis of rotation, this is referred to as &quot;eccentric turning&quot; or &quot;multi-axis turning&quot;. The result is that various cross sections of the workpiece are rotationally symmetric, but the workpiece as a whole is not rotationally symmetric. This technique is used for camshafts, various types of chair legs.

=== Sizes ===

Lathes are usually &#x27;sized&#x27; by the capacity of the work that they may hold. Usually large work is held at both ends either using a chuck or other drive in the headstock and a centre in the tailstock. To maximise size, turning between centres allows the work to be as close to the headstock as possible and is used to determine the longest piece the lathe will turn: when the base of the tailstock is aligned with the end of the bed. The distance between centres gives the maximum length of work the lathe will officially hold. It is possible to get slightly longer items in if the tailstock overhangs the end of the bed but this is an ill-advised practice. Purchasing an extension or larger bed would be a wise alternative.

The other dimension of the workpiece is how far off-centre it can be. This is known as the &#x27;swing&#x27; (&quot;The distance from the head center of a lathe to the bed or ways, or to the rest. The swing determines the diametric size of the object which is capable of being turned in the lathe; anything larger would interfere with the bed. This limit is called the swing of the bed. The swing of the rest is the size which will rotate above the rest, which lies upon the bed.&quot;) from the notion that the work &#x27;swings&#x27; from the centre upon which it is mounted. This makes more sense with odd-shaped work but as the lathe is most often used with cylindrical work, it is useful to know the maximum diameter of work the lathe will hold. This is simply the value of the swing (or centre height above the bed) multiplied by two. For some reason, in the U.S. swing is assumed to be diameter but this is incorrect. To be clear on size, it is better, therefore, to describe the dimension as &#x27;centre height above the bed&#x27;. As parts of the lathe reduce capacity, measurements such as &#x27;swing over cross slide&#x27; or other named parts can be found.

=== Varieties ===
The smallest lathes are &quot;jewelers lathes&quot; or &quot;watchmaker lathes&quot;, which, though often small enough to be held in one hand are normally fastened to a bench. There are rare and even smaller mini lathes made for precision cutting. The workpieces machined on a jeweler&#x27;s lathe are often metal, but other softer materials can also be machined. Jeweler&#x27;s lathes can be used with hand-held &quot;graver&quot; tools or with a &quot;compound rest&quot; that attach to the lathe bed and allows the tool to be clamped in place and moved by a screw or lever feed. Graver tools are generally supported by a T-rest, not fixed to a cross slide or compound rest. The work is usually held in a collet, but high-precision 3 and 6-jaw chucks are also commonly employed. Common spindle bore sizes are 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The term WW refers to the Webster/Whitcomb collet and lathe, invented by the American Watch Tool Company of Waltham, Massachusetts. Most lathes commonly referred to as watchmakers lathes are of this design. In 1909, the American Watch Tool company introduced the Magnus type collet (a 10-mm body size collet) using a lathe of the same basic design, the Webster/Whitcomb Magnus. (F.W.Derbyshire, Inc. retains the trade names Webster/Whitcomb and Magnus and still produces these collets.) Two bed patterns are common: the WW (Webster Whitcomb) bed, a truncated triangular prism (found only on 8 and 10 mm watchmakers&#x27; lathes); and the continental D-style bar bed (used on both 6 mm and 8 mm lathes by firms such as Lorch and Star). Other bed designs have been used, such as a triangular prism on some Boley 6.5 mm lathes, and a V-edged bed on IME&#x27;s 8 mm lathes.

Smaller metalworking lathes that are larger than jewelers&#x27; lathes and can sit on a bench or table, but offer such features as tool holders and a screw-cutting gear train are called hobby lathes, and larger versions, &quot;bench lathes&quot; - this term also commonly applied to a special type of high-precision lathe used by toolmakers for one-off jobs. Even larger lathes offering similar features for producing or modifying individual parts are called &quot;engine lathes&quot;. Lathes of these types do not have additional integral features for repetitive production, but rather are used for individual part production or modification as the primary role.

Lathes of this size that are designed for mass manufacture, but not offering the versatile screw-cutting capabilities of the engine or bench lathe, are referred to as &quot;second operation&quot; lathes.

Lathes with a very large spindle bore and a chuck on both ends of the spindle are called &quot;oil field lathes&quot;.

Fully automatic mechanical lathes, employing cams and gear trains for controlled movement, are called screw machines.

Lathes that are controlled by a computer are CNC lathes.

Lathes with the spindle mounted in a vertical configuration, instead of horizontal configuration, are called vertical lathes or vertical boring machines. They are used where very large diameters must be turned, and the workpiece (comparatively) is not very long.

A lathe with a tool post that can rotate around a vertical axis, so as to present different tools towards the headstock (and the workpiece) are turret lathes.

A lathe equipped with indexing plates, profile cutters, spiral or helical guides, etc., so as to enable ornamental turning is an ornamental lathe.

Various combinations are possible: for example, a vertical lathe can have CNC capabilities as well (such as a CNC VTL).

Lathes can be combined with other machine tools, such as a drill press or vertical milling machine. These are usually referred to as combination lathes.

== Uses ==

=== Woodworking ===


Woodworking lathes are the oldest variety, apart from pottery wheels. All other varieties are descended from these simple lathes. An adjustable horizontal metal rail, the tool-rest, between the material and the operator accommodates the positioning of shaping tools, which are usually hand-held. After shaping, it is common practice to press and slide sandpaper against the still-spinning object to smooth the surface made with the metal shaping tools. The tool-rest is usually removed during sanding, as it may be unsafe to have the operators hands between it and the spinning wood.

Many woodworking lathes can also be used for making bowls and plates. The bowl or plate needs only to be held at the bottom by one side of the lathe. It is usually attached to a metal face plate attached to the spindle. With many lathes, this operation happens on the left side of the headstock, where are no rails and therefore more clearance. In this configuration, the piece can be shaped inside and out. A specific curved tool-rest may be used to support tools while shaping the inside. Further detail can be found on the woodturning page.

Most woodworking lathes are designed to be operated at a speed of between 200 and 1,400 revolutions per minute, with slightly over 1,000 rpm considered optimal for most such work, and with larger workpieces requiring lower speeds.

=== Duplicating ===
One type of specialized lathe is duplicating or copying lathe. Some types of them are known as Blanchard lathe, after Thomas Blanchard. This type of lathe was able to create shapes identical to a standard pattern and it revolutionized the process of gun stock making in the 1820s when it was invented.

The Hermitage Museum, Russia displays the copying lathe for ornamental turning: making medals and guilloche patterns, designed by Andrey Nartov, 1721.

=== Patternmaking ===
Used to make a pattern for foundries, often from wood, but also plastics. A patternmaker&#x27;s lathe looks like a heavy wood lathe, often with a turret and either a leadscrew or a rack and pinion to manually position the turret. The turret is used to accurately cut straight lines. They often have a provision to turn very large parts on the other end of the headstock, using a free-standing toolrest. Another way of turning large parts is a sliding bed, which can slide away from the headstock and thus open up a gap in front of the headstock for large parts.

=== Metalworking ===
In a metalworking lathe, metal is removed from the workpiece using a hardened cutting tool, which is usually fixed to a solid moveable mounting, either a tool-post or a turret, which is then moved against the workpiece using handwheels or computer-controlled motors. These cutting tools come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, depending upon their application. Some common styles are diamond, round, square and triangular.

The tool-post is operated by lead-screws that can accurately position the tool in a variety of planes. The tool-post may be driven manually or automatically to produce the roughing and finishing cuts required to &quot;turn&quot; the workpiece to the desired shape and dimensions, or for cutting threads, worm gears, etc. Cutting fluid may also be pumped to the cutting site to provide cooling, lubrication and clearing of swarf from the workpiece. Some lathes may be operated under control of a computer for mass production of parts (see &quot;Computer numerical control&quot;).

Manually controlled metalworking lathes are commonly provided with a variable-ratio gear-train to drive the main lead-screw. This enables different thread pitches to be cut. On some older lathes or more affordable new lathes, the gear trains are changed by swapping gears with various numbers of teeth onto or off of the shafts, while more modern or expensive manually controlled lathes have a quick-change box to provide commonly used ratios by the operation of a lever. CNC lathes use computers and servomechanisms to regulate the rates of movement.

On manually controlled lathes, the thread pitches that can be cut are, in some ways, determined by the pitch of the lead-screw: A lathe with a metric lead-screw will readily cut metric threads (including BA), while one with an imperial lead-screw will readily cut imperial-unit-based threads such as BSW or UTS (UNF, UNC). This limitation is not insurmountable, because a 127-tooth gear, called a transposing gear, is used to translate between metric and inch thread pitches. However, this is optional equipment that many lathe owners do not own. It is also a larger change-wheel than the others, and on some lathes may be larger than the change-wheel mounting banjo is capable of mounting.

The workpiece may be supported between a pair of points called centres, or it may be bolted to a faceplate or held in a chuck. A chuck has movable jaws that can grip the workpiece securely.

There are some effects on material properties when using a metalworking lathe. There are few chemical or physical effects, but there are many mechanical effects, which include residual stress, micro-cracks, work-hardening, and tempering in hardened materials.

=== Cue lathes ===

Cue lathes function similarly to turning and spinning lathes, allowing a perfectly radially-symmetrical cut for billiard cues. They can also be used to refinish cues that have been worn over the years.

=== Glass-working ===

Glass-working lathes are similar in design to other lathes, but differ markedly in how the workpiece is modified. Glass-working lathes slowly rotate a hollow glass vessel over a fixed- or variable-temperature flame. The source of the flame may be either hand-held or mounted to a banjo/cross-slide that can be moved along the lathe bed. The flame serves to soften the glass being worked, so that the glass in a specific area of the workpiece becomes ductile and subject to forming either by inflation (&quot;glassblowing&quot;) or by deformation with a heat-resistant tool. Such lathes usually have two head-stocks with chucks holding the work, arranged so that they both rotate together in unison. Air can be introduced through the headstock chuck spindle for glassblowing. The tools to deform the glass and tubes to blow (inflate) the glass are usually handheld.

In diamond turning, a computer-controlled lathe with a diamond-tipped tool is used to make precision optical surfaces in glass or other optical materials. Unlike conventional optical grinding, complex aspheric surfaces can be machined easily. Instead of the dovetailed ways used on the tool slide of a metal-turning lathe, the ways typically float on air bearings, and the position of the tool is measured by optical interferometry to achieve the necessary standard of precision for optical work. The finished work piece usually requires a small amount of subsequent polishing by conventional techniques to achieve a finished surface suitably smooth for use in a lens, but the rough grinding time is significantly reduced for complex lenses.

=== Metal-spinning ===
In metal spinning, a disk of sheet metal is held perpendicularly to the main axis of the lathe, and tools with polished tips (&quot;spoons&quot;) or roller tips are hand-held, but levered by hand against fixed posts, to develop pressure that deforms the spinning sheet of metal.

Metal-spinning lathes are almost as simple as wood-turning lathes. Typically, metal spinning requires a mandrel, usually made from wood, which serves as the template onto which the workpiece is formed (asymmetric shapes can be made, but it is a very advanced technique). For example, to make a sheet metal bowl, a solid block of wood in the shape of the bowl is required; similarly, to make a vase, a solid template of the vase is required.

Given the advent of high-speed, high-pressure, industrial die forming, metal spinning is less common now than it once was, but still a valuable technique for producing one-off prototypes or small batches, where die forming would be uneconomical.

=== Ornamental turning ===
The ornamental turning lathe was developed around the same time as the industrial screw-cutting lathe in the nineteenth century. It was used not for making practical objects, but for decorative work: &quot;ornamental turning&quot;. By using accessories such as the horizontal and vertical cutting frames, eccentric chuck and elliptical chuck, solids of extraordinary complexity may be produced by various generative procedures.

A special-purpose lathe, the Rose engine lathe, is also used for ornamental turning, in particular for engine turning, typically in precious metals, for example to decorate pocket-watch cases. As well as a wide range of accessories, these lathes usually have complex dividing arrangements to allow the exact rotation of the mandrel. Cutting is usually carried out by rotating cutters, rather than directly by the rotation of the work itself. Because of the difficulty of polishing such work, the materials turned, such as wood or ivory, are usually quite soft, and the cutter has to be exceptionally sharp. The finest ornamental lathes are generally considered to be those made by Holtzapffel around the turn of the 19th century.

=== Reducing ===

Many types of lathes can be equipped with accessory components to allow them to reproduce an item: the original item is mounted on one spindle, the blank is mounted on another, and as both turn in synchronized manner, one end of an arm &quot;reads&quot; the original and the other end of the arm &quot;carves&quot; the duplicate.

A reduction lathe is a specialized lathe that is designed with this feature and incorporates a mechanism similar to a pantograph, so that when the &quot;reading&quot; end of the arm reads a detail that measures one inch (for example), the cutting end of the arm creates an analogous detail that is (for example) one quarter of an inch (a 4:1 reduction, although given appropriate machinery and appropriate settings, any reduction ratio is possible).

Reducing lathes are used in coin-making, where a plaster original (or an epoxy master made from the plaster original, or a copper-shelled master made from the plaster original, etc.) is duplicated and reduced on the reducing lathe, generating a master die.

=== Rotary lathes ===

A lathe in which wood logs are turned against a very sharp blade and peeled off in one continuous or semi-continuous roll. Invented by Immanuel Nobel (father of the more famous Alfred Nobel). The first such lathes in the United States were set up in the mid-19th century. The product is called wood veneer and it is used for making plywood and as a cosmetic surface veneer on some grades of chipboard.

=== Watchmaking ===

Watchmakers lathes are delicate but precise metalworking lathes, usually without provision for screwcutting, and are still used by horologists for work such as the turning of balance staffs. A handheld tool called a graver, supported by a tool-rest, is often used in preference to a slide-mounted tool. The original watchmaker&#x27;s turns was a simple dead-center lathe with a moveable rest and two loose head-stocks. The workpiece would be rotated by a bow, typically of horsehair, wrapped around it.

=== Transcription or recording ===
Transcription or recording lathes are used to make grooves on a surface for recording sounds. These were used in creating sound grooves on wax cylinders and then on flat recording discs originally also made of wax, but later as lacquers on a substratum. Originally the cutting lathes were driven by sound vibrations through a horn in a process known as acoustic recording and later driven by an electric current when microphones were first used in sound recording. Many such lathes were professional models, but others were developed for home recording and were common before the advent of home tape recording.

National and international standards are used to standardize the definitions, environmental requirements, and test methods used for the performance evaluation of lathes. Election of the standard to be used is an agreement between the supplier and the user and has some significance in the design of the lathe. In the United States, ASME has developed the B5.57 Standard entitled &quot;Methods for Performance Evaluation of Computer Numerically Controlled Lathes and Turning Centers&quot;, which establishes requirements and methods for specifying and testing the performance of CNC lathes and turning centers.

<doc id="149996" wikidata="Q281460" url="?curid=149996" title="Pipe organ">
<text>The pipe organ is a musical instrument that produces sound by driving pressurised air (called &quot;wind&quot;) through the organ pipes selected from a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes are provided in sets called &quot;ranks&quot;, each of which has a common timbre, volume, and construction throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have many ranks of pipes of differing pitch, timbre, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.

A pipe organ has one or more keyboards (called &quot;manuals&quot;) played by the hands, and a pedal clavier played by the feet; each keyboard controls its own division (group of stops). The keyboard(s), pedalboard, and stops are housed in the organ&#x27;s &quot;console&quot;. The organ&#x27;s continuous supply of wind allows it to sustain notes for as long as the corresponding keys are pressed, unlike the piano and harpsichord whose sound begins to dissipate immediately after a key is depressed. The smallest portable pipe organs may have only one or two dozen pipes and one manual; the largest organs may have over 33,000 pipes and as many as seven manuals. A list of some of the most notable and largest pipe organs in the world can be viewed at List of pipe organs. A ranking of the largest organs in the world—based on the criterion constructed by Michał Szostak, i.e. &#x27;the number of ranks and additional equipment managed from a single console&#x27;—can be found in the quarterly magazine &quot;The Organ&quot; and in the online journal &quot;Vox Humana&quot;.

The origins of the pipe organ can be traced back to the hydraulis in Ancient Greece, in the 3rd century BC, in which the wind supply was created by the weight of displaced water in an airtight container. By the 6th or 7th century AD, bellows were used to supply Byzantine organs with wind. A pipe organ with &quot;great leaden pipes&quot; was sent to the West by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V as a gift to Pepin the Short, King of the Franks, in 757. Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning the pipe organ&#x27;s establishment in Western European church music. In England, &quot;The first organ of which any detailed record exists was built in Winchester Cathedral in the 10th century. It was a huge machine with 400 pipes, which needed two men to play it and 70 men to blow it, and its sound could be heard throughout the city.&quot; Beginning in the 12th century, the organ began to evolve into a complex instrument capable of producing different timbres. By the 17th century, most of the sounds available on the modern classical organ had been developed. At that time, the pipe organ was the most complex human-made device—a distinction it retained until it was displaced by the telephone exchange in the late 19th century.

Pipe organs are installed in churches, synagogues, concert halls, schools, mansions, other public buildings and in private properties. They are used in the performance of classical music, sacred music, secular music, and popular music. In the early 20th century, pipe organs were installed in theaters to accompany the screening of films during the silent movie era; in municipal auditoria, where orchestral transcriptions were popular; and in the homes of the wealthy. The beginning of the 21st century has seen a resurgence in installations in concert halls. A substantial organ repertoire spans over 500 years.

==History and development==

===Antiquity===

The organ is one of the oldest instruments still used in European classical music that has commonly been credited as having derived from Greece. Its earliest predecessors were built in ancient Greece in the 3rd century BC. The word &quot;organ&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek (), a generic term for an instrument or a tool, via the Latin , an instrument similar to a portative organ used in ancient Roman circus games.

The Greek engineer Ctesibius of Alexandria is credited with inventing the organ in the 3rd century BC. He devised an instrument called the hydraulis, which delivered a wind supply maintained through water pressure to a set of pipes. The hydraulis was played in the arenas of the Roman Empire. The pumps and water regulators of the hydraulis were replaced by an inflated leather bag in the 2nd century AD, and true bellows began to appear in the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th or 7th century AD. Some 400 pieces of a hydraulis from the year 228 AD were revealed during the 1931 archaeological excavations in 
the former Roman town Aquincum, province of Pannonia (present day Budapest), which was used as a music instrument by the Aquincum fire dormitory; a modern replica produces an enjoyable sound.

The 9th century Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 913), in his lexicographical discussion of instruments, cited the (organ) as one of the typical instruments of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire. It was often used in the Hippodrome in the imperial capital of Constantinople. A Syrian visitor describes a pipe organ powered by two servants pumping &quot;bellows like a blacksmith&#x27;s&quot; played while guests ate at the emperor&#x27;s Christmas dinner in Constantinople in 911. The first Western European pipe organ with &quot;great leaden pipes&quot; was sent from Constantinople to the West by the Byzantine emperor Constantine V as a gift to Pepin the Short King of the Franks in 757. Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne requested a similar organ for his chapel in Aachen in 812, beginning its establishment in Western European church music.

===Medieval===
From 800 to the 1400s, the use and construction of organs developed in significant ways, from the invention of the portative and positive organs to the installation of larger organs in major churches such as the cathedrals of Winchester and Notre Dame of Paris. In this period, organs began to be used in secular and religious settings. The introduction of organ into religious settings is ambiguous, most likely because the original position of the Church was that instrumental music was not to be allowed. By the 12th century there is evidence for permanently installed organs existing in religious settings such as the Abbey of Fécamp and other locations throughout Europe.
Several innovations occurred to organs in the Middle Ages, such as the creation of the portative and the positive organ. The portative organs were small and created for secular use and made of light weight delicate materials that would have been easy for one individual to transport and play on their own. The portative organ was a &quot;flue-piped keyboard instrument, played with one hand while the other operated the bellows.&quot; Its portability made the portative useful for the accompaniment of both sacred and secular music in a variety of settings. The positive organ was larger than the portative organ but was still small enough to be portable and used in a variety of settings like the portative organ. Toward the middle of the 13th century, the portatives represented in the miniatures of illuminated manuscripts appear to have real keyboards with balanced keys, as in the Cantigas de Santa Maria.

It is difficult to directly determine when larger organs were first installed in Europe. An early detailed eyewitness account from Wulfstan of Winchester gives an idea of what organs were like prior to the 13th century, after which more records of large church organs exist. In his account, he describes the sound of the organ: &quot;among them bells outstanding in tone and size, and an organ [sounding] through bronze pipes prepared according to the musical proportions.&quot; This is one of the earliest accounts of organs in Europe and also indicates that the organ was large and more permanent than other evidence would suggest.

The first organ documented to have been permanently installed was one installed in 1361 in Halberstadt, Germany. The first documented permanent organ installation likely prompted Guillaume de Machaut to describe the organ as &quot;the king of instruments&quot;, a characterization still frequently applied. The Halberstadt organ was the first instrument to use a chromatic key layout across its three manuals and pedalboard, although the keys were wider than on modern instruments. The width of the keys was slightly over two and a half inches, wide enough to be struck down by the fist, as the early keys are reported to have invariably been manipulated. It had twenty bellows operated by ten men, and the wind pressure was so high that the player had to use the full strength of their arm to hold down a key.

Records of other organs permanently installed and used in worship services in the late 13th and 14th centuries are found in large cathedrals such as Notre Dame, the latter documenting organists hired to by the church and the installation of larger and permanent organs. The earliest is a payment in 1332 from the clergy of Notre Dame to an organist to perform on the feasts St. Louis and St. Michael. The Notre Dame School also shows how organs could have been used within the increased use of polyphony, which would have allowed for the use of more instrumental voices within the music. According to documentation from the 9th century by Walafrid Strabo, the organ was also used for music during other parts of the church service—the prelude and postlude the main examples—and not just for the effect of polyphony with the choir. Other possible instances of this were short interludes played on the organ either in between parts of the church service or during choral songs, but they were not played at the same time as the choir was singing. This shows that by this point in time organs were fully used within church services and not just in secular settings. Organs from earlier in the medieval period are evidenced by surviving keyboards and casings, but no pipes. Until the mid-15th century, organs had no stop controls. Each manual controlled ranks at many pitches, known as the &quot;Blockwerk.&quot; Around 1450, controls were designed that allowed the ranks of the Blockwerk to be played individually. These devices were the forerunners of modern stop actions. The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.

===Renaissance and Baroque periods===
During the Renaissance and Baroque periods, the organ&#x27;s tonal colors became more varied. Organ builders fashioned stops that imitated various instruments, such as the krummhorn and the viola da gamba. Builders such as Arp Schnitger, Jasper Johannsen, Zacharias Hildebrandt and Gottfried Silbermann constructed instruments that were in themselves artistic, displaying both exquisite craftsmanship and beautiful sound. These organs featured well-balanced mechanical key actions, giving the organist precise control over the pipe speech. Schnitger&#x27;s organs featured particularly distinctive reed timbres and large Pedal and Rückpositiv divisions.

Different national styles of organ building began to develop, often due to changing political climates. In the Netherlands, the organ became a large instrument with several divisions, doubled ranks, and mounted cornets. The organs of northern Germany also had more divisions, and independent pedal divisions became increasingly common. Organ makers began designing their cases in such a way that the divisions of the organ were visibly discernible. Twentieth-century musicologists have retroactively labelled this the &quot;Werkprinzip&quot;.

In France, as in Italy, Spain and Portugal, organs were primarily designed to play alternatim verses rather than accompany congregational singing. The &quot;French Classical Organ&quot; became remarkably consistent throughout France over the course of the Baroque era, more so than any other style of organ building in history, and standardized registrations developed. This type of instrument was elaborately described by Dom Bédos de Celles in his treatise &quot;L&#x27;art du facteur d&#x27;orgues&quot; (&quot;The Art of Organ Building&quot;). The Italian Baroque organ was often a single-manual instrument, without pedals. It was built on a full diapason chorus of octaves and fifths. The stop-names indicated the pitch relative to the fundamental (&quot;Principale&quot;) and typically reached extremely short nominal pipe-lengths (for example, if the Principale were 8&#x27;, the &quot;Vigesimanona&quot; was ½&#x27;). The highest ranks &quot;broke back&quot;, their smallest pipes replaced by pipes pitched an octave lower to produce a kind of composite treble mixture.

In England, many pipe organs were destroyed or removed from churches during the English Reformation of the 16th century and the Commonwealth period. Some were relocated to private homes. At the Restoration, organ builders such as Renatus Harris and &quot;Father&quot; Bernard Smith brought new organ-building ideas from continental Europe. English organs evolved from small one- or two-manual instruments into three or more divisions disposed in the French manner with grander reeds and mixtures, though still without pedal keyboards. The Echo division began to be enclosed in the early 18th century, and in 1712, Abraham Jordan claimed his &quot;swelling organ&quot; at St Magnus-the-Martyr to be a new invention. The swell box and the independent pedal division appeared in English organs beginning in the 18th century.

===Romantic period===
During the Romantic period, the organ became more symphonic, capable of creating a gradual crescendo. This was made possible by voicing stops in such a way that families of tone that historically had only been used separately could now be used together, creating an entirely new way of approaching organ registration. New technologies and the work of organ builders such as Eberhard Friedrich Walcker, Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, and Henry Willis made it possible to build larger organs with more stops, more variation in sound and timbre, and more divisions. For instance, as early as in 1808, the first 32&#x27; contre-bombarde was installed in the great organ of Nancy Cathedral, France. Enclosed divisions became common, and registration aids were developed to make it easier for the organist to manage the great number of stops. The desire for louder, grander organs required that the stops be voiced on a higher wind pressure than before. As a result, a greater force was required to overcome the wind pressure and depress the keys. To solve this problem, Cavaillé-Coll configured the English &quot;Barker lever&quot; to assist in operating the key action. This is, essentially, a servomechanism that uses wind pressure from the air plenum, to augment the force that is exerted by the player&#x27;s fingers.

Organ builders began to prefer specifications with fewer mixtures and high-pitched stops, more 8′ and 16′ stops and wider pipe scales. These practices created a warmer, richer sound than was common in the 18th century. Organs began to be built in concert halls (such as the organ at the Palais du Trocadéro in Paris), and composers such as Camille Saint-Saëns and Gustav Mahler used the organ in their orchestral works.

===Modern development===
The development of pneumatic and electro-pneumatic key actions in the late 19th century made it possible to locate the console independently of the pipes, greatly expanding the possibilities in organ design. Electric stop actions were also developed, which allowed sophisticated combination actions to be created.

Beginning in the early 20th century in Germany and in the mid-20th century in the United States, organ builders began to build historically inspired instruments modeled on Baroque organs. They returned to building mechanical key actions, voicing with lower wind pressures and thinner pipe scales, and designing specifications with more mixture stops. This became known as the Organ Reform Movement.

In the late 20th century, organ builders began to incorporate digital components into their key, stop, and combination actions. Besides making these mechanisms simpler and more reliable, this also makes it possible to record and play back an organist&#x27;s performance using the MIDI protocol. In addition, some organ builders have incorporated digital (electronic) stops into their pipe organs.

The electronic organ developed throughout the 20th century. Some pipe organs were replaced by digital organs because of their lower purchase price, smaller physical size, and minimal maintenance requirements. In the early 1970s, Rodgers Instruments pioneered the &quot;hybrid&quot; organ, an electronic instrument that incorporates real pipes; other builders such as Allen Organs and Johannus Orgelbouw have since built hybrid organs. Allen Organs first introduced the electronic organ in 1937 and in 1971 created the first digital organ using CMOS technology borrowed from NASA which created the digital pipe organ using sound recorded from actual speaking pipes and incorporating the sounds electronically within the memory of the digital organ thus having real pipe organ sound without the actual organ pipes.

==Construction==
A pipe organ contains one or more sets of pipes, a wind system, and one or more keyboards. The pipes produce sound when pressurized air produced by the wind system passes through them. An action connects the keyboards to the pipes. Stops allow the organist to control which ranks of pipes sound at a given time. The organist operates the stops and the keyboards from the console.

===Pipes===
Organ pipes are made from either wood or metal and produce sound (&quot;speak&quot;) when air under pressure (&quot;wind&quot;) is directed through them. As one pipe produces a single pitch, multiple pipes are necessary to accommodate the musical scale. The greater the length of the pipe, the lower its resulting pitch will be. The timbre and volume of the sound produced by a pipe depends on the volume of air delivered to the pipe and the manner in which it is constructed and voiced, the latter adjusted by the builder to produce the desired tone and volume. Hence a pipe&#x27;s volume cannot be readily changed while playing.
Organ pipes are divided into flue pipes and reed pipes according to their design and timbre. Flue pipes produce sound by forcing air through a fipple, like that of a recorder, whereas reed pipes produce sound via a beating reed, like that of a clarinet or saxophone.

Pipes are arranged by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank is a set of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. The stop mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, the stop governing the pipe&#x27;s rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.

=== Action ===
An organ contains two actions, or systems of moving parts: the keys, and the stops. The key action causes wind to be admitted into an organ pipe while a key is depressed. The stop action causes a rank of pipes to be engaged (i.e. playable by the keys) while a stop is in its &quot;on&quot; position. An action may be mechanical, pneumatic, or electrical (or some combination of these, such as electro-pneumatic). The key action is independent of the stop action, allowing an organ to combine a mechanical key action with an electric stop action.

A key action in which the keys are connected to the windchests by only rods and levers is a mechanical or tracker action. When the organist depresses a key, the corresponding rod (called a tracker) pulls open its pallet, allowing wind to enter the pipe.

In a mechanical stop action, each stop control operates a valve for a whole rank of pipes. When the organist selects a stop, the valve allows wind to reach the selected rank. The first kind of control used for this purpose was a draw stop knob, which the organist selects by pulling (or drawing) toward himself/herself. Pulling all of the knobs thus activates all available pipes, and is the origin of the idiom &quot;&quot;. More modern stop selectors, utilized in electric actions, are ordinary electrical switches and/or magnetic valves operated by a rocker tab.

Tracker action has been used from antiquity to modern times. Before the pallet opens, wind pressure augments tension of the pallet spring, but once the pallet opens, only the spring tension is felt at the key. This sudden decrease of key pressure against the finger provides a &quot;breakaway&quot; feel.

A later development was the tubular-pneumatic action, which uses changes of pressure within lead tubing to operate pneumatic valves throughout the instrument. This allowed a lighter touch, and more flexibility in the location of the console, within a roughly 50-foot (15-m) limit. This type of construction was used in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and has had only rare application since the 1920s.

A more recent development is the electric action, which uses low voltage DC to control the key and/or stop mechanisms. Electricity may control the action indirectly by activating air pressure valves (pneumatics), in which case the action is electro-pneumatic. In such actions, an electromagnet attracts a small pilot valve which lets wind go to a bellows (the &quot;pneumatic&quot; component) which opens the pallet. When electricity operates the action directly without the assistance of pneumatics, it is commonly referred to as direct electric action. In this type, the electromagnet&#x27;s armature carries a disc pallet.

When electrical wiring alone is used to connect the console to the windchest, electric actions allow the console to be separated at any practical distance from the rest of the organ, and to be movable. Electric stop actions can be controlled at the console by stop knobs, by pivoted tilting tablets, or rocker tabs. These are simple switches, like wall switches for room lights. Some may include electromagnets for automatic setting or resetting when combinations are selected.

Computers have made it possible to connect the console and windchests using narrow data cables instead of the much larger bundles of simple electric cables. Embedded computers in the console and near the windchests communicate with each other via various complex multiplexing syntaxes, comparable to MIDI.

===Wind system===

The wind system consists of the parts that produce, store, and deliver wind to the pipes. Pipe organ wind pressures are on the order of . Organ builders traditionally measure organ wind using a water U-tube manometer, which gives the pressure as the difference in water levels in the two legs of the manometer. The difference in water level is proportional to the difference in pressure between the wind and the atmosphere. The 0.10 psi above would register as 2.75 inches of water (70 mmAq). An Italian organ from the Renaissance period may be on only , while (in the extreme) solo stops in some large 20th-century organs may require up to . In isolated, extreme cases, some stops have been voiced on .

With the exception of water organs, playing the organ before the invention of motors required at least one person to operate the bellows. When signaled by the organist, a &quot;calcant&quot; would operate a set of bellows, supplying the organ with wind. Rather than hire a calcant, an organist might practise on some other instrument such as a clavichord or harpsichord. By the mid-19th-century bellows were also operated by water engines, steam engines or gasoline engines. Starting in the 1860s bellows were gradually replaced by rotating turbines which were later directly connected to electrical motors. This made it possible for organists to practice regularly on the organ. Most organs, both new and historic, have electric blowers, although some can still be operated manually. The wind supplied is stored in one or more regulators to maintain a constant pressure in the &quot;windchests&quot; until the action allows it to flow into the pipes.

===Stops===
Each stop usually controls one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of the stop reflects not only the stop&#x27;s timbre and construction, but also the style of the organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will usually be French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as Japan are more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.

To facilitate a large range of timbres, organ stops exist at different pitch levels. A stop that sounds at unison pitch when a key is depressed is called an 8′ (pronounced &quot;eight-foot&quot;) pitch. This refers to the speaking length of the lowest-sounding pipe in that rank, which is approximately . For the same reason, a stop that sounds an octave higher is at 4′ pitch, and one that sounds two octaves higher is at 2′ pitch. Likewise, a stop that sounds an octave lower than unison pitch is at 16′ pitch, and one that sounds two octaves lower is at 32′ pitch. Stops of different pitch levels are designed to be played simultaneously.

The label on a stop knob or rocker tab indicates the stop&#x27;s name and its pitch in feet. Stops that control multiple ranks display a Roman numeral indicating the number of ranks present, instead of pitch. Thus, a stop labelled &quot;Open Diapason 8′ &quot; is a single-rank diapason stop sounding at 8′ pitch. A stop labelled &quot;Mixture V&quot; is a five-rank mixture.

Sometimes, a single rank of pipes may be able to be controlled by several stops, allowing the rank to be played at multiple pitches or on multiple manuals. Such a rank is said to be &quot;unified&quot; or &quot;borrowed&quot;. For example, an 8′ Diapason rank may also be made available as a 4′ Octave. When both of these stops are selected and a key (for example, c′) is pressed, two pipes of the same rank will sound: the pipe normally corresponding to the key played (c′), and the pipe one octave above that (c′′). Because the 8′ rank does not have enough pipes to sound the top octave of the keyboard at 4′ pitch, it is common for an extra octave of pipes used only for the borrowed 4′ stop to be added. In this case, the full rank of pipes (now an &quot;extended rank&quot;) is one octave longer than the keyboard.

Special unpitched stops also appear in some organs. Among these are the Zimbelstern (a wheel of rotating bells), the nightingale (a pipe submerged in a small pool of water, creating the sound of a bird warbling when wind is admitted), and the &quot;effet d&#x27;orage&quot; (&quot;thunder effect&quot;, a device that sounds the lowest bass pipes simultaneously). Standard orchestral percussion instruments such as the drum, chimes, celesta, and harp have also been imitated in organ building.

===Console===

The controls available to the organist, including the keyboards, couplers, expression pedals, stops, and registration aids are accessed from the console. The console is either built into the organ case or detached from it.

====Keyboards====
Keyboards played by the hands are known as &quot;manuals&quot; (from the Latin &#x27;, meaning &quot;hand&quot;). The keyboard played by the feet is a &quot;pedalboard&quot; (from the Latin &#x27;, meaning &quot;foot&quot;). Every organ has at least one manual (most have two or more), and most have a pedalboard. Each keyboard is named for a particular division of the organ (a group of ranks) and generally controls only the stops from that division. The range of the keyboards has varied widely across time and between countries. Most current specifications call for two or more manuals with sixty-one notes (five octaves, from C to c″″) and a pedalboard with thirty or thirty-two notes (two and a half octaves, from C to f′ or g′).

====Couplers====
A &quot;coupler&quot; allows the stops of one division to be played from the keyboard of another division. For example, a coupler labelled &quot;Swell to Great&quot; allows the stops drawn in the Swell division to be played on the Great manual. This coupler is a unison coupler, because it causes the pipes of the Swell division to sound at the same pitch as the keys played on the Great manual. Coupling allows stops from different divisions to be combined to create various tonal effects. It also allows every stop of the organ to be played simultaneously from one manual.

&quot;Octave couplers&quot;, which add the pipes an octave above (super-octave) or below (sub-octave) each note that is played, may operate on one division only (for example, the Swell super octave, which adds the octave above what is played on the Swell to itself), or act as a coupler to another keyboard (for example, the Swell super-octave to Great, which adds to the Great manual the ranks of the Swell division an octave above what is played).

In addition, larger organs may use &quot;unison off&quot; couplers, which prevent the stops pulled in a particular division from sounding at their normal pitch. These can be used in combination with octave couplers to create innovative aural effects, and can also be used to rearrange the order of the manuals to make specific pieces easier to play.

====Enclosure and expression pedals====

&quot;Enclosure&quot; refers to a system that allows for the control of volume without requiring the addition or subtraction of stops. In a two-manual organ with Great and Swell divisions, the Swell will be enclosed. In larger organs, parts or all of the Choir and Solo divisions may also be enclosed. The pipes of an enclosed division are placed in a chamber generally called the &quot;swell box&quot;. At least one side of the box is constructed from horizontal or vertical palettes known as &quot;swell shades&quot;, which operate in a similar way to Venetian blinds; their position can be adjusted from the console. When the swell shades are open, more sound is heard than when they are closed. Sometimes the shades are exposed, but they are often concealed behind a row of facade-pipes or a grill.

The most common method of controlling the louvers is the balanced swell pedal. This device is usually placed above the centre of the pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which the shades are closed) to a near-horizontal position (in which the shades are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backward reverses this process.

====Combination action====

Organ stops can be combined in many permutations, resulting in a great variety of sounds. A combination action can be used to switch instantly from one combination of stops (called a &quot;registration&quot;) to another. Combination actions feature small buttons called &quot;pistons&quot; that can be pressed by the organist, generally located beneath the keys of each manual (thumb pistons) or above the pedalboard (toe pistons). The pistons may be &quot;divisional&quot; (affecting only a single division) or &quot;general&quot; (affecting all the divisions), and are either preset by the organ builder or can be altered by the organist. Modern combination actions operate via computer memory, and can store several channels of registrations.

===Casing===

The pipes, action, and wind system are almost always contained in a case, the design of which also may incorporate the console. The case blends the organ&#x27;s sound and aids in projecting it into the room. The case is often designed to complement the building&#x27;s architectural style and it may contain ornamental carvings and other decorations. The visible portion of the case, called the &quot;façade&quot;, will most often contain pipes, which may be either sounding pipes or dummy pipes solely for decoration. The façade pipes may be plain, burnished, gilded, or painted and are usually referred to as &quot;(en) montre&quot; within the context of the French organ school.

Organ cases occasionally feature a few ranks of pipes protruding horizontally from the case in the manner of a row of trumpets. These are referred to as pipes &quot;en chamade&quot; and are particularly common in organs of the Iberian peninsula and large 20th-century instruments.

Many organs, particularly those built in the early 20th century, are contained in one or more rooms called organ chambers. Because sound does not project from a chamber into the room as clearly as from a freestanding organ case, enchambered organs may sound muffled and distant. For this reason, some modern builders, particularly those building instruments specializing in polyphony rather than Romantic compositions, avoid this unless the architecture of the room makes it necessary.

===Tuning and regulation===

The goal of tuning a pipe organ is to adjust the pitch of each pipe so that they all sound in tune with each other. How the pitch of each pipe is adjusted depends on the type and construction of that pipe.

Regulation adjusts the action so that all pipes sound correctly. If the regulation is wrongly set, the keys may be at different heights, some pipes may sound when the keys are not pressed (a &quot;cipher&quot;), or pipes may not sound when a key is pressed. Tracker action, for example in the organ of Cradley Heath Baptist Church, includes adjustment nuts on the wire ends of the wooden trackers, which have the effect of changing the effective length of each tracker.

==Repertoire==
The main development of organ repertoire has progressed along with that of the organ itself, leading to distinctive national styles of composition. Because organs are commonly found in churches and synagogues, the organ repertoire includes a large amount of sacred music, which is accompanimental (choral anthems, congregational hymns, liturgical elements, etc.) as well as solo in nature (chorale preludes, hymn versets designed for &quot;alternatim&quot; use, etc.). The organ&#x27;s secular repertoire includes preludes, fugues, sonatas, organ symphonies, suites, and transcriptions of orchestral works.

Although most countries whose music falls into the Western tradition have contributed to the organ repertoire, France and Germany in particular have produced exceptionally large amounts of organ music. There is also an extensive repertoire from the Netherlands, England, and the United States.

===Early music===
Before the Baroque era, keyboard music generally was not written for one instrument or another, but rather was written to be played on &quot;any&quot; keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ&#x27;s repertoire through the Renaissance period is the same as that of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions from a variety of regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.

In the Renaissance period, Dutch composers such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck composed both fantasias and psalm settings. Sweelinck in particular developed a rich collection of keyboard figuration that influenced subsequent composers. The Italian composer Claudio Merulo wrote in the typical Italian genres of the toccata, the canzona, and the ricercar. In Spain, the works of Antonio de Cabezón began the most prolific period of Spanish organ composition, which culminated with Juan Cabanilles.

===Common practice period===

Early Baroque organ music in Germany was highly contrapuntal. Sacred organ music was based on chorales: composers such as Samuel Scheidt and Heinrich Scheidemann wrote chorale preludes, chorale fantasias, and chorale motets. Near the end of the Baroque era, the chorale prelude and the partita became mixed, forming the chorale partita. This genre was developed by Georg Böhm, Johann Pachelbel, and Dieterich Buxtehude. The primary type of free-form piece in this period was the praeludium, as exemplified in the works of Matthias Weckmann, Nicolaus Bruhns, Böhm, and Buxtehude. The organ music of Johann Sebastian Bach fused characteristics of every national tradition and historical style in his large-scale preludes and fugues and chorale-based works. George Frideric Handel composed the first organ concertos.

In France, organ music developed during the Baroque era through the music of Jean Titelouze, François Couperin, and Nicolas de Grigny. Because the French organ of the 17th and early 18th centuries was very standardized, a conventional set of registrations developed for its repertoire. The music of French composers (and Italian composers such as Girolamo Frescobaldi) was written for use during the Mass. Very little secular organ music was composed in France and Italy during the Baroque period; the written repertoire is almost exclusively intended for liturgical use. In England, composers such as John Blow and John Stanley wrote multi-sectional free works for liturgical use called &quot;voluntaries&quot; through the 19th century.

Organ music was seldom written in the Classical era, as composers preferred the piano with its ability to create dynamics. In Germany, the six sonatas op. 65 of Felix Mendelssohn (published 1845) marked the beginning of a renewed interest in composing for the organ. Inspired by the newly built Cavaillé-Coll organs, the French organist-composers César Franck, Alexandre Guilmant and Charles-Marie Widor led organ music into the symphonic realm. The development of symphonic organ music continued with Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire. Widor and Vierne wrote large-scale, multi-movement works called &quot;organ symphonies&quot; that exploited the full possibilities of the symphonic organ, such as Widor&#x27;s Symphony for Organ No. 6 and Vierne&#x27;s Organ Symphony No. 3. Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert&#x27;s symphonic works made use of the abilities of the large Romantic organs then built in Germany.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, organ builders began to build instruments in concert halls and other large secular venues, allowing the organ to be used as part of an orchestra, as in Saint-Saëns&#x27; Symphony No. 3 (sometimes known as the &quot;Organ Symphony&quot;). Frequently the organ is given a soloistic part, such as in Joseph Jongen&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Concertante for Organ &amp; Orchestra&quot;, Francis Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Concerto for Organ, Strings and Tympani&quot;, and Frigyes Hidas&#x27; Organ Concerto.

===Modern and contemporary===
Other composers who have used the organ prominently in orchestral music include Gustav Holst, Richard Strauss, Ottorino Respighi, Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Because these concert hall instruments could approximate the sounds of symphony orchestras, transcriptions of orchestral works found a place in the organ repertoire. As silent films became popular, theatre organs were installed in theatres to provide accompaniment for the films. 

In the 20th-century symphonic repertoire, both sacred and secular, continued to progress through the music of Marcel Dupré, Maurice Duruflé, and Herbert Howells. Other composers, such as Olivier Messiaen, György Ligeti, Jehan Alain, Jean Langlais, Gerd Zacher, and Petr Eben, wrote post-tonal organ music. Messiaen&#x27;s music in particular redefined many of the traditional notions of organ registration and technique.

Albert Schweitzer was an organist who studied the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and influenced the Organ reform movement.

Film composer Hans Zimmer prominently used the pipe organ in his score for the movie &quot;Interstellar&quot;. The final recording took place in London&#x27;s Temple Church on a 1926 four-manual Harrison and Harrison organ.

<text>I Can See You is the sixth EP by American hardcore punk band Black Flag. It was released three years after their breakup and was their last studio recording for 24 years, until the release of their seventh studio album &quot;What The...&quot; in 2013. The material was recorded before the departure of drummer Bill Stevenson and bassist Kira Roessler, and three of the tracks were originally included on the cassette and CD editions of the &quot;In My Head&quot; (1985) album.
