<text>Strike action, also called labor strike, labour strike in British English, or simply strike, is a work stoppage caused by the mass refusal of employees to work. A strike usually takes place in response to employee grievances. Strikes became common during the Industrial Revolution, when mass labor became important in factories and mines. As striking became a more common practice, governments were often pushed to act (either by private business or by union workers). When government intervention occurred, it was rarely neutral or amicable. Early strikes were often deemed unlawful conspiracies or anti-competitive cartel action and many were subject to massive legal repression by state police, federal military power, and federal courts. Many Western nations legalized striking under certain conditions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Strikes are sometimes used to pressure governments to change policies. Occasionally, strikes destabilize the rule of a particular political party or ruler; in such cases, strikes are often part of a broader social movement taking the form of a campaign of civil resistance. Notable examples are the 1980 Gdańsk Shipyard and the 1981 Warning Strike led by Lech Wałęsa. These strikes were significant in the long campaign of civil resistance for political change in Poland, and were an important mobilizing effort that contributed to the fall of the Iron Curtain and the end of communist party rule in Eastern Europe. Another example is the general strike in Weimar Germany that followed the March 1920 Kapp Putsch. It was called by the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and received such broad support that it resulted in the collapse of the putsch.

== History ==

=== Origin of the term ===
The use of the English word &quot;strike&quot; to describe a work protest was first seen in 1768, when sailors, in support of demonstrations in London, &quot;struck&quot; or removed the topgallant sails of merchant ships at port, thus crippling the ships.

=== Pre-industrial strikes ===
The first historically certain account of strike action was in ancient Egypt on 14 November in 1152 BCE, when artisans of the Royal Necropolis at Deir el-Medina walked off their jobs in protest at the failure of the government of Ramesses III to pay their wages on time and in full. The royal government ended the strike by raising the artisans&#x27; wages.

The first Jewish source for the idea of a labor strike appears in the Talmud, which records that the bakers who prepared showbread for the altar went on strike.

An early predecessor of the general strike may have been the &quot;secessio plebis&quot; in ancient Rome. In &quot;The Outline of History&quot;, H. G. Wells characterized this event as &quot;the general strike of the plebeians; the plebeians seem to have invented the strike, which now makes its first appearance in history.&quot; Their first strike occurred because they &quot;saw with indignation their friends, who had often served the state bravely in the legions, thrown into chains and reduced to slavery at the demand of patrician creditors&quot;.

=== During and after the Industrial Revolution ===

The strike action only became a feature of the political landscape with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. For the first time in history, large numbers of people were members of the industrial working class; they lived in towns and cities, exchanging their labor for payment. By the 1830s, when the Chartist movement was at its peak in Britain, a true and widespread &#x27;workers consciousness&#x27; was awakening. In 1838, a Statistical Society of London committee &quot;used the first written questionnaire… The committee prepared and printed a list of questions &#x27;designed to elicit the complete and impartial history of strikes.&#x27;&quot;

In 1842 the demands for fairer wages and conditions across many different industries finally exploded into the first modern general strike. After the second Chartist Petition was presented to Parliament in April 1842 and rejected, the strike began in the coal mines of Staffordshire, England, and soon spread through Britain affecting factories, cotton mills in Lancashire and coal mines from Dundee to South Wales and Cornwall. Instead of being a spontaneous uprising of the mutinous masses, the strike was politically motivated and was driven by an agenda to win concessions. As much as half of the then industrial work force were on strike at its peakover 500,000 men. The local leadership marshaled a growing working class tradition to politically organize their followers to mount an articulate challenge to the capitalist, political establishment. Friedrich Engels, an observer in London at the time, wrote:

&quot;by its numbers, this class has become the most powerful in England, and woe betide the wealthy Englishmen when it becomes conscious of this fact … The English proletarian is only just becoming aware of his power, and the fruits of this awareness were the disturbances of last summer.&quot;
As the 19th century progressed, strikes became a fixture of industrial relations across the industrialized world, as workers organized themselves to collectively bargain for better wages and standards with their employers. Karl Marx condemned the theory of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon criminalizing strike action in his work &quot;The Poverty of Philosophy&quot;.

===Recognition strikes===

A recognition strike is an industrial strike implemented in order to force a particular employer or industry to recognize a trade union as the legitimate collective bargaining agent for a company&#x27;s workers. In 1949, their use in the United States was described as &quot;a weapon used with varying results by labor for the last forty years or more&quot;. One example cited was the successful formation of the United Auto Workers, which achieved recognition from General Motors through the Flint sit-down strike of 1936-37. They were more common prior to the advent of modern American labor law (including the National Labor Relations Act), which introduced processes legally compelling an employer to recognize the legitimacy of properly certified unions.

Two examples include the U.S. Steel recognition strike of 1901, and the subsequent coal strike of 1902. A 1936 study of strikes in the United States indicated that about one third of the total number of strikes between 1927 and 1928, and over 40 percent in 1929, were due to &quot;demands for union recognition, closed shop, and protest against union discrimination and violation of union agreements&quot;. A 1988 study of strike activity and unionization in non-union municipal police departments between 1972 and 1978 found that recognition strikes were carried out &quot;primarily where bargaining laws [provided] little or no protection of bargaining rights.&quot;

In 1937, there were 4,740 strikes in the United States. This was the greatest strike wave in American labor history. The number of major strikes and lockouts in the U.S. fell by 97% from 381 in 1970 to 187 in 1980 to only 11 in 2010. Companies countered the threat of a strike by threatening to close or move a plant.

The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted in 1967, ensures the right to strike in Article 8. The European Social Charter, adopted in 1961, also ensures the right to strike in Article 6.

The Farah Strike, 1972–1974, labeled the &quot;strike of the century,&quot; was organized and led by Mexican American women predominantly in El Paso, Texas.

==Frequency and duration==

Strikes are rare, in part because many workers are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Strikes that do occur are generally fairly short in duration. Labor economist John Kennan notes:

Since the 1990s, strike actions have generally further declined, a phenomenon that might be attributable to lower information costs (and thus more readily available access to information on economic rents) made possible by computerization and rising personal indebtedness, which increases the cost of job loss for striking workers. In the United States, the number of workers involved in major work stoppages (including strikes and, less commonly, lockouts) that involved at least a thousand workers for at least one full shift generally declined from 1973 to 2017 (coinciding with a general decrease in overall union membership), before substantially increasing in 2018 and 2019. In the 2018 and 2019 period, 3.1% of union members were involved in a work stoppage each year on average, these strikes also contained more workers than ever recorded with an average of 20,000 workers participating in each major work stoppage in 2018 and 2019.

===By country===

For the period from 1996 to 2000, the ten countries with the most strike action (measured by average number of days not worked for every 1000 employees) were as follows:

==Variations==

Most strikes are organized by labor unions during collective bargaining as a last resort. The object of collective bargaining is for the employer and the union to come to an agreement over wages, benefits, and working conditions. A collective bargaining agreement may include a clause (a contractual &quot;no-strike clause&quot;) which prohibits the union from striking during the term of the agreement. Under U.S. labor law, a strike in violation of a no-strike clause is not a protected concerted activity.

The scope of a no-strike clause varies; generally, the U.S. courts and National Labor Relations Board have determined that a collective bargaining agreement&#x27;s no-strike clause has the same scope as the agreement&#x27;s arbitration clauses, such that &quot;the union cannot strike over an arbitrable issue.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court held in &quot;Jacksonville Bulk Terminals Inc. v. International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association&quot; (1982), a case involving the International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association refusing to work with goods for export to the Soviet Union in protest against its invasion of Afghanistan, that a no-strike clause does not bar unions from refusing to work as a political protest (since that is not an &quot;arbitrable&quot; issue), although such activity may lead to damages for a secondary boycott. Whether a no-strike clause applies to sympathy strikes depends on the context. Some in the labor movement consider no-strike clauses to be an unnecessary detriment to unions in the collective bargaining process.

Occasionally, workers decide to strike without the sanction of a labor union, either because the union refuses to endorse such a tactic, or because the workers involved are non-unionized. Strikes without formal union authorization are also known as wildcat strikes.

In many countries, wildcat strikes do not enjoy the same legal protections as recognized union strikes, and may result in penalties for the union members who participate, or for their union. The same often applies in the case of strikes conducted without an official ballot of the union membership, as is required in some countries such as the United Kingdom.

A strike may consist of workers refusing to attend work or picketing outside the workplace to prevent or dissuade people from working in their place or conducting business with their employer. Less frequently, workers may occupy the workplace, but refuse to work. This is known as a sit-down strike. A similar tactic is the work-in, where employees occupy the workplace but still continue work, often without pay, which attempts to show they are still useful, or that worker self-management can be successful. For instance, this occurred with factory occupations in the &quot;Biennio Rosso&quot; strikesthe &quot;two red years&quot; of Italy from 1919 to 1920.

Another unconventional tactic is work-to-rule (also known as an &quot;Italian strike&quot;, in ), in which workers perform their tasks exactly as they are required to but no better. For example, workers might follow all safety regulations in such a way that it impedes their productivity or they might refuse to work overtime. Such strikes may in some cases be a form of &quot;partial strike&quot; or &quot;slowdown&quot;.

During the development boom of the 1970s in Australia, the Green ban was developed by certain unions described by some as more socially conscious. This is a form of strike action taken by a trade union or other organized labor group for environmentalist or conservationist purposes. This developed from the black ban, strike action taken against a particular job or employer in order to protect the economic interests of the strikers.

United States labor law also draws a distinction, in the case of private sector employers covered by the National Labor Relations Act, between &quot;economic&quot; and &quot;unfair labor practice&quot; strikes. An employer may not fire, but may permanently replace, workers who engage in a strike over economic issues. On the other hand, employers who commit unfair labor practices (ULPs) may not replace employees who strike over them, and must fire any strikebreakers they have hired as replacements in order to reinstate the striking workers.
Strikes may be specific to a particular workplace, employer, or unit within a workplace, or they may encompass an entire industry, or every worker within a city or country. Strikes that involve all workers, or a number of large and important groups of workers, in a particular community or region are known as general strikes. Under some circumstances, strikes may take place in order to put pressure on the State or other authorities or may be a response to unsafe conditions in the workplace.

A sympathy strike is a strike action in which one group of workers refuses to cross a picket line established by another as a means of supporting the striking workers. Sympathy strikes, once the norm in the construction industry in the United States, have been made much more difficult to conduct, due to decisions of the National Labor Relations Board permitting employers to establish separate or &quot;reserved&quot; gates for particular trades, making it an unlawful secondary boycott for a union to establish a picket line at any gate other than the one reserved for the employer it is picketing. Still, the practice continues to occur; for example, some Teamsters contracts often protect members from disciplinary action if a member refuses to cross a picket line. Sympathy strikes may be undertaken by a union as an organization, or by individual union members choosing not to cross a picket line.

A jurisdictional strike in United States labor law refers to a concerted refusal to work undertaken by a union to assert its members&#x27; right to particular job assignments and to protest the assignment of disputed work to members of another union or to unorganized workers.

A rolling strike refers to a strike where only some employees in key departments or locations go on strike. These strikes are performed in order to increase stakes as negotiations draw on and to be unpredictable to the employer. Rolling strikes also serve to conserve strike funds.

A student strike involves students (sometimes supported by faculty) refusing to attend classes. In some cases, the strike is intended to draw media attention to the institution so that the grievances that are causing the students to strike can be aired before the public; this usually damages the institution&#x27;s (or government&#x27;s) public image. In other cases, especially in government-supported institutions, the student strike can cause a budgetary imbalance and have actual economic repercussions for the institution.

A hunger strike is a deliberate refusal to eat. Hunger strikes are often used in prisons as a form of political protest. Like student strikes, a hunger strike aims to worsen the public image of the target.

A &quot;sickout&quot;, or (especially by uniformed police officers) &quot;blue flu&quot;, is a type of strike action in which the strikers call in sick. This is used in cases where laws prohibit certain employees from declaring a strike. Police, firefighters, air traffic controllers, and teachers in some U.S. states are among the groups commonly barred from striking usually by state and federal laws meant to ensure the safety or security of the general public.

Newspaper writers may withhold their names from their stories as a way to protest actions of their employer.

Activists may form &quot;&quot; groups for strikes or other actions, a form of picketing, to disrupt the workplace or another aspect of capitalist production: supporting other strikers or unemployed workers, participating in protests against globalization, or opposing abusive landlords.

==Legal prohibitions==

=== Canada ===
On 30 January 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that there is a constitutional right to strike. In this 5–2 majority decision, Justice Rosalie Abella ruled that &quot;[a]long with their right to associate, speak through a bargaining representative of their choice, and bargain collectively with their employer through that representative, the right of employees to strike is vital to protecting the meaningful process of collective bargaining…&quot; [paragraph 24]. This decision adopted the dissent by Chief Justice Brian Dickson in a 1987 Supreme Court ruling on a reference case brought by the province of Alberta (&quot;Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta)&quot;). The exact scope of this right to strike remains unclear.

Prior to this Supreme Court decision, the federal and provincial governments had the ability to introduce &quot;back-to-work legislation&quot;, a special law that blocks the strike action (or a lockout) from happening or continuing. Canadian governments could also have imposed binding arbitration or a new contract on the disputing parties. Back-to-work legislation was first used in 1950 during a railway strike, and as of 2012 had been used 33 times by the federal government for those parts of the economy that are regulated federally (grain handling, rail and air travel, and the postal service), and in more cases provincially. In addition, certain parts of the economy can be proclaimed &quot;essential services&quot; in which case all strikes are illegal.

Examples include when the government of Canada passed back-to-work legislation during the 2011 Canada Post lockout and the 2012 CP Rail strike, thus effectively ending the strikes. In 2016, the government&#x27;s use of back-to-work legislation during the 2011 Canada Post lockout was ruled unconstitutional, with the judge specifically referencing the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 2015 decision in &quot;Saskatchewan Federation of Labour v Saskatchewan&quot;.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China and the former Soviet Union===

In some Marxist–Leninist states, such as the People&#x27;s Republic of China, striking was illegal and viewed as counter-revolutionary, and labor strikes are considered to be taboo in most East Asian cultures. In 1976, China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which guaranteed the right to unions and striking, but Chinese officials declared that they had no interest in allowing these liberties. In June 2008, the municipal government in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone introduced draft labor regulations, which a labor rights advocacy group says would, if implemented and enforced, virtually restore Chinese workers&#x27; right to strike. 

In the Soviet Union, strikes occurred throughout the existence of the USSR, most notably in the 1930s. After World War II, they diminished both in number and in scale. Trade unions in the Soviet Union served in part as a means to educate workers about the country&#x27;s economic system. Vladimir Lenin referred to trade unions as &quot;Schools of Communism&quot;.

===France===


In France, the first law aimed at limiting the ability of workers to take collective action was the Le Chapelier Law, passed by the National Assembly on 14 June 1791 and which introduced the &quot;crime of coalition.&quot; In his speech in support of the law, the titular author Isaac René Guy le Chapelier explained that it &quot;must be without a doubt permitted for all citizens to assemble,&quot; but he maintained that it &quot;must not be permitted for citizens from certain professions to assemble for their so-called common interests.&quot;

Strike actions were specifically banned with the passage of Napoleon&#x27;s French Penal Code of 1810. Article 415 of the Code declared that participants in an attempted strike action would be subject to an imprisonment of between one and three months and that the organizers of the attempted strike action would be subject to an imprisonment of between two and five years.

The right to strike under the current French Fifth Republic has been recognized and guaranteed by the Preamble to the French Constitution of 27 October 1946 ever since the Constitutional Council&#x27;s 1971 decision on the freedom of association recognized that document as being invested with constitutional value.

A &quot;minimum service&quot; during strikes in public transport was a promise of Nicolas Sarkozy during his campaign for the French presidential election. A law &quot;on social dialogue and continuity of public service in regular terrestrial transports of passengers&quot; was adopted on 12 August 2007, and it took effect on 1 January 2008.

=== Italy ===
In Italy, the right to strike is guaranteed by the Constitution (). The law number 146 of 1990 and law number 83 of 2000 regulate the strike actions. In particular, they impose limitations for the strikes of workers in public essential services, i.e., the ones that &quot;guarantee the personality rights of life, health, freedom and security, movements, assistance and welfare, education, and communications&quot;. These limitations provide a minimum guarantee for these services and punish violations. Similar limitations are applied to workers in the private sector whose strike can affect public services. The employer is explicitly forbidden to apply sanctions to employees participating to the strikes, with the exception of the aforementioned essential services cases.

The government, under exceptional circumstances, can impose the &quot;precettazione&quot; of the strike, i.e., can force the postponement, cancellation or duration reduction of a national-wide strike. The prime minister has to justify the decision of applying the &quot;precettazione&quot; in front of the parliament. For local strikes, &quot;precettazione&quot; can also be applied by a decision of the prefect. The employees refusing to work after the &quot;precettazione&quot; takes effect may be subject of a sanction or even a penal action (for a maximum of 4 years of prison) if the illegal strike causes the suspension of an essential service.

&quot;Precettazione&quot; has been rarely applied, usually after several days of strikes affecting transport or fuel services or extraordinary events. Recent cases include the cancellation of the 2015 strike of the company providing transportation services in Milan during Expo 2015, and the 2007 &quot;precettazione&quot; to stop the strike of the truck drivers that was causing food and fuel shortage after several days of strike.

===United Kingdom===
Legislation was enacted in the aftermath of the 1919 police strikes, forbidding British police from both taking industrial action, and discussing the possibility with colleagues.

In January 1951 during the Labour Attlee ministry, Attorney-General Hartley Shawcross left his name to a Parliamentary principle in a defense of his conduct regarding an illegal strike: that the Attorney-General &quot;is not to be put, and is not put, under pressure by his colleagues in the matter&quot; of whether or not to establish criminal proceedings.

The Industrial Relations Act 1971 was repealed through the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974, sections of which were repealed by the Employment Act 1982.

The Code of Practice on Industrial Action Ballots and Notices, and sections 22 and 25 of the Employment Relations Act 2004, which concern industrial action notices, commenced on 1 October 2005.

The Police Federation, which was created at the time to deal with employment grievances and to provide representation to police officers, attempted to put pressure on the Blair ministry and at the time repeatedly threatened strike action.

Prison officers have gained and lost the right to strike over the years; in the 2010s, despite it being illegal, they walked out on 15 November 2016, and again on 14 September 2018.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, the Basic Law bans civil servants from going on strike, and the Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that teachers were not permitted to strike. As of December 2023, the matter whether the decision violated teachers&#x27; human rights under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) is pending at the European Court of Human Rights.

===United States===
The Railway Labor Act bans strikes by United States airline and railroad employees except in narrowly defined circumstances. The National Labor Relations Act generally permits strikes, but provides a mechanism to enjoin from striking workers in industries in which a strike would create a national emergency. , the federal government most recently invoked these statutory provisions to obtain an injunction requiring the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to return to work in 2002 after having been locked out by the employer group, the Pacific Maritime Association.

Some jurisdictions prohibit all strikes by public employees, under laws such as the &quot;Taylor Law&quot; in New York. Other jurisdictions impose strike bans only on certain categories of workers, particularly those regarded as critical to society: police, teachers and firefighters are among the groups commonly barred from striking in these jurisdictions. Some states, such as New Jersey, Michigan, Iowa or Florida, do not allow teachers in public schools to strike. Workers have sometimes circumvented these restrictions by falsely claiming inability to work due to illnessthis is sometimes called a &quot;sickout&quot; or &quot;blue flu&quot;, the latter receiving its name from the uniforms worn by police officers, who are traditionally prohibited from striking. The term &quot;red flu&quot; has sometimes been used to describe this action when undertaken by firefighters.

Under federal law, federal employees who participate in a strike, or who assert the right to strike against the US government, are barred from retaining their employment.

Often, specific regulations on strike actions exist for employees in prisons. The Code of Federal Regulations declares &quot;encouraging others to refuse to work, or to participate in a work stoppage&quot; by prisoners to be a &quot;High Severity Level Prohibited Act&quot; and authorizes solitary confinement for periods of up to a year for each violation. The California Code of Regulations states that &quot;[p]articipation in a strike or work stoppage&quot;, &quot;[r]efusal to perform work or participate in a program as ordered or assigned&quot;, and &quot;[r]ecurring failure to meet work or program expectations within the inmate&#x27;s abilities when lesser disciplinary methods failed to correct the misconduct&quot; by prisoners is &quot;serious misconduct&quot; under §3315(a)(3)(L), leading to gang affiliation under CCR §3000.

Postal workers involved in 1978 wildcat strikes in Jersey City, Kearny, New Jersey, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. were fired under the presidency of Jimmy Carter, and President Ronald Reagan fired air traffic controllers and the PATCO union after the air traffic controllers&#x27; strike of 1981.

The West Virginia teacher&#x27;s strike in 2018 inspired teachers in other states, including Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona, to take similar action.

==Jurisprudence and philosophy==
Strike actions have also been discussed from the perspective of jurisprudence and philosophy, with issues being raised such as whether people have a right to strike, the interaction of strikes with other rights, civil order, coercion, justice and the interplay between striking and contracts.

==Strikebreakers==

A &quot;strikebreaker&quot; (sometimes derogatorily called a &quot;scab&quot;, &quot;blackleg&quot;, or &quot;knobstick&quot;) is a person who works despite an ongoing strike. Strikebreakers are usually individuals who are not employed by the company prior to the trade union dispute, but rather hired after or during the strike to keep the organization running. &quot;Strikebreakers&quot; may also refer to workers (union members or not) who cross picket lines to work.

Irwin, Jones, McGovern (2008) believe that the term &quot;scab&quot; is part of a larger metaphor involving strikes. They argue that the picket line is symbolic of a wound and those who break its borders to return to work are the scabs who bond that wound. Others have argued that the word is not a part of a larger metaphor but, rather, was an old-fashioned English insult whose meaning narrowed over time.

&quot;Blackleg&quot; is an older word and is found in the 19th-century folk song &quot;Blackleg Miner&quot; which originated in Northumberland. The term does not necessarily owe its origins to this tune of unknown origin.

===Union strikebreaking===

The concept of &quot;union strikebreaking&quot; or &quot;union scabbing&quot; refers to any circumstance in which union workers themselves cross picket lines to work.

Unionized workers are sometimes required to cross the picket lines established by other unions due to their organizations having signed contracts which include no-strike clauses. The no-strike clause typically requires that members of the union not conduct any strike action for the duration of the contract; such actions are called &quot;sympathy&quot; or &quot;secondary strikes&quot;. Members who honor the picket line in spite of the contract frequently face discipline, for their action may be viewed as a violation of provisions of the contract.

Therefore, any union conducting a strike action typically seeks to include a provision of amnesty for all who honored the picket line in the agreement that settles the strike. No-strike clauses may also prevent unionized workers from engaging in solidarity actions for other workers even when no picket line is crossed. For example, striking workers in manufacturing or mining produce a product which must be transported. In a situation where the factory or mine owners have replaced the strikers, unionized transport workers may feel inclined to refuse to haul any product that is produced by strikebreakers, yet their own contract obligates them to do so.

Historically the practice of union strikebreaking has been a contentious issue in the union movement, and a point of contention between adherents of different union philosophies. For example, supporters of industrial unions, which have sought to organize entire workplaces without regard to individual skills, have criticized craft unions for organizing workplaces into separate unions according to skill, a circumstance that makes union strikebreaking more common. Union strikebreaking is not unique to craft unions.

==Anti-strike action==
Most strikes called by unions are somewhat predictable; they typically occur after the contract has expired. However, not all strikes are called by union organizationssome strikes have been called in an effort to pressure employers to recognize unions. Other strikes may be spontaneous actions by working people. Spontaneous strikes are sometimes called &quot;wildcat strikes&quot;; they were the key fighting point in May 1968 in France; most commonly, they are responses to serious (often life-threatening) safety hazards in the workplace rather than wage or hour disputes, etc.

Whatever the cause of the strike, employers are generally motivated to take measures to prevent them, mitigate the impact, or to undermine strikes when they do occur.

===Strike preparation===
Companies which produce products for sale will frequently increase inventories prior to a strike. Salaried employees may be called upon to take the place of strikers, which may entail advance training. If the company has multiple locations, personnel may be redeployed to meet the needs of reduced staff. Companies may also take out strike insurance, to help offset the losses which a strike would cause.

When established unions commence strike action, some companies may decline entirely to negotiate with the union, and respond to the strike by hiring replacement workers. For strikers, this may be concerning for multiple reasons. For example, they may fear that the strike will be lost. The length of time that the strike may last could cause many workers to cease striking, which would likely cause it to fail. They may also be concerned that they will lose their jobs entirely. Companies that hire strikebreakers typically use these concerns to attempt to convince union members to abandon the strike and cross the union&#x27;s picket line.

Unions faced with a strikebreaking situation may try to inhibit the use of strikebreakers by a variety of methodsestablishing picket lines where strikebreakers enter the workplace; discouraging strike breakers from taking, or from keeping, strikebreaking jobs; raising the cost of hiring strikebreakers for the company; or employing public relations tactics. Companies may respond by increasing security forces and seeking court injunctions.

Examining conditions in the late 1990s, John Logan, professor and director of Labor and Employment Studies at San Francisco State University, observed that union busting agencies helped to &quot;transform economic strikes into a virtually suicidal tactic for US unions&quot;. Logan further observed, &quot;as strike rates in the United States have plummeted to historic low levels, the demand for strike management firms has also declined.&quot;

In the US, as established in the National Labor Relations Act there is a legally protected right for private sector employees to strike to gain better wages, benefits, or working conditions and they cannot be fired. Striking for economic reasons (like protesting workplace conditions or supporting a union&#x27;s bargaining demands) allows an employer to hire permanent replacements. The replacement worker can continue in the job and then the striking worker must wait for a vacancy.

But if the strike is due to unfair labor practices, the strikers replaced can demand immediate reinstatement when the strike ends. If a collective bargaining agreement is in effect, and it contains a &quot;no-strike clause&quot;, a strike during the life of the contract could result in the firing of all striking employees which could result in dissolution of that union. Although this is legal it could be viewed as union busting.

===Strike breaking===
Some companies negotiate with the union during a strike; other companies may see a strike as an opportunity to eliminate the union. This is sometimes accomplished by the importation of replacement workers, strikebreakers or &quot;scabs&quot;. Historically, strike breaking has often coincided with union busting. It was also called &quot;black legging&quot; in the early twentieth century, during the Russian socialist movement.

===Union busting===
One method of inhibiting or ending a strike is firing union members who are striking which can result in elimination of the union. Although this has happened, it is rare due to laws regarding firing and &quot;right to strike&quot; having a wide range of differences in the US depending on whether union members are public or private sector. Laws also vary country to country. In the UK, &quot;It is important to understand that there is no right to strike in UK law.&quot; Employees who strike risk dismissal, unless it is an official strike (one called or endorsed by their union) in which case they are protected from unlawful dismissal, and cannot be fired for at least 12 weeks. UK laws regarding work stoppages and strikes are defined within the Employment Relations Act 1999 and the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992.

A significant case of mass-dismissals in the UK in 2005 involved the sacking of over 600 Gate Gourmet employees at Heathrow Airport. The sacking prompted a walkout by British Airways ground staff leading to cancelled flights and thousands of delayed passengers. The walkout was illegal under UK law and the T&amp;GWU quickly brought it to an end. A subsequent court case ruled that demonstrations on a grass verge approaching the Gate Gourmet premises were not illegal, but limited the number and made the T&amp;G responsible for their action.

In 1962, US President John F. Kennedy issued Executive Order #10988 which permitted federal employees to form trade unions but prohibited strikes (codified in 1966 at 5 U.S.C. 7311Loyalty and Striking). In 1981, after public sector union PATCO (Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization) went on strike illegally, President Ronald Reagan fired all of the controllers. His action resulted in the dissolution of the union. PATCO reformed to become the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
In the U.S., as established in the National Labor Relations Act there is a legally protected right for private sector employees to strike to gain better wages, benefits, or working conditions and they cannot be fired. Striking for economic reasons (i.e., protesting workplace conditions or supporting a union&#x27;s bargaining demands) allows an employer to hire permanent replacements. The replacement worker can continue in the job and then the striking worker must wait for a vacancy. But if the strike is due to unfair labor practices (ULP), the strikers replaced can demand immediate reinstatement when the strike ends. If a collective bargaining agreement is in effect, and it contains a &quot;no-strike clause&quot;, a strike during the life of the contract could result in the firing of all striking employees which could result in dissolution of that union.

Amazon has used the Law firm Wilmerhale to legally end worker strikes at its locations.

===Lockout===
Another counter to a strike is a lockout, a form of work stoppage in which an employer refuses to allow employees to work. Two of the three employers involved in the Caravan park grocery workers strike of 2003–2004 locked out their employees in response to a strike against the third member of the employer bargaining group. Lockouts are, with certain exceptions, lawful under United States labor law.

===Violence===
Historically, some employers have attempted to break union strikes by force. One of the most famous examples of this occurred during the Homestead Strike of 1892. Industrialist Henry Clay Frick sent private security agents from the Pinkerton National Detective Agency to break a strike, organised by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers at a Homestead, Pennsylvania, steel mill. Two strikers were killed, twelve wounded, along with two Pinkertons killed and eleven wounded.

In the aftermath, Frick was shot in the neck and then stabbed by an unaffiliated anarchist, Alexander Berkman, in an assassination attempt. Frick survived the attack, while Berkman was sentenced to 22 years in prison.

===Conscription===
Critical infrastructure workers who are on strike may be forced back to work under military law and/or civil conscription in countries which allow conscription. In 2010, the Spanish government invoked emergency powers to conscript air traffic controllers who were on strike.

<doc id="155136" wikidata="Q9033431" url="?curid=155136" title="Minster-in-Thanet">
<text>Minster, also known as Minster-in-Thanet, is a village and civil parish in the Thanet District of Kent, England. It is the site of Minster in Thanet Priory. The village is west of Ramsgate (which is the post town) and to the north east of Canterbury; it lies just south west of Kent International Airport and just north of the River Stour. Minster is also the &quot;ancient capital of Thanet&quot;. At the 2011 Census the hamlet of Ebbsfleet was included.

==Toponymy==
The name ultimately comes from the Medieval Latin &quot;monasterium&quot;, denoting the historical presence of an abbey or monastery; such names are common in England and indeed throughout Europe.

==History==

Archaeology has shown a Bronze Age settlement at Minster-in-Thanet. The area became part of the Roman Empire under the emperor Claudius. Around 450AD, the Jutes arrived in the Minster area and established a settlement.

===Anglo-Saxon===
In 597 Augustine of Canterbury is said, by the Venerable Bede, to have landed with 40 men at nearby Ebbsfleet, in the parish of Minster-in-Thanet, before founding a monastery in Canterbury; a cross marks the spot of his landing.

Minster itself originally started as a monastic settlement in 670 AD. The buildings are still used as nunneries today. The first abbey in the village was founded by St Domneva, a widowed noblewoman, whose daughter St Mildred, is taken as the first abbess. The tradition is that Domneva was granted as much land as a hind could run over in a day, the hind remains the village emblem, see also Kentish Royal Legend. The boundary defined by the hind was known as Cursus Cerve or St Mildred’s Lynch. The abbey was extinguished by Viking raiding. The next abbess after St Mildred was St Edburga daughter of King Centwine of the West Saxons.

The third known abbess was Sigeburh, who was active around 762 AD and is known from the Secgan hagiography and from Royal charters. In 761AD Offa, king of the Mercians, granted Sigeburh a toll-exemption which king Æthelbald had previously granted to Abbess Mildrith. Again in about 763 AD Eadberht II, king of Kent, granted the remission of toll on two ships at Sarre and on a third at Fordwich. It has been stated that in gaining these privileges, she may have been taking advantage of Æthelbald&#x27;s political weakness.

Vikings attacked the surrounding area in 850 AD.

===Norman===

The parish church of St Mary-the-Virgin is largely Norman but with significant traces of earlier work, the problems of which are unresolved. The nave is impressive with five bays, and the crossing has an ancient chalk block vaulting. The chancel is Early English with later flying buttresses intended to halt the very obvious spread of the upper walls. There is a fine set of misericords reliably dated around 1400. The tower has a curious turret at its southeast corner that is locally referred to as a Saxon watch tower but is built at least partly from Caen stone; it may be that it dates from the time of the conquest but is built in an antique style sometimes called Saxo-Norman. A doorway in the turret opens out some two metres above the present roof line.

The church was used by both the brethren of the second abbey, a dependency of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey in Canterbury, and as a parish church. Socket holes in the piers of the crossing suggest that, as well as a rood screen, there was a further screen dividing nave and crossing, such as still exists at Dunster in Somerset. This abbey surrendered during the dissolution in 1534.

===Nineteenth century===
The 1876 Ordnance Survey Great Britain County Series map shows a Methodist (Wesleyan) chapel in St Mildred&#x27;s Road; on the 1898 OS map it has become Roman Catholic and been renamed &quot;St Mildred&#x27;s R.C. chapel&quot;, also being referred to as &quot;St Mildred&#x27;s church and presbytery&quot;. It later closed but as permission to demolish it and build houses on the site was denied in 2010, it was converted into a private residence.

===Twentieth century===
Minster Abbey is a house incorporating remains of the Anglo-Saxon abbey and alleged to be the oldest continuously inhabited house in England. It now houses the village&#x27;s third religious community, a priory of Roman Catholic Benedictine sisters that is a daughter community of St. Walburg, Eichstätt in Bavaria. It was settled in 1937 by refugees fleeing Nazi Germany and continues to flourish as an international community. The Priory has the care of a relic of St Mildred that had been in the care of a church in Deventer in the Netherlands since the Reformation.

Generally a flat landscape, the area&#x27;s main features include marshes, farms and rivers. Thanet District Council has, however, assessed Minster Marshes, south of the village, as being unstable, and some areas of Minster, particularly in the south of the village, have suffered from flooding.

Land reclamation has had a strong history in Minster and Monkton, where the original reclamation was done by the monks themselves.

==Education==
The Primary School is called &quot;Minster Church of England Primary School&quot;, which caters for the village&#x27;s population. As of 2022, there are 383 pupils attending the school.

==Transport==
Minster railway station lies to the south of the village, on the line from Canterbury West to Ramsgate and on the junction to the Kent Coast Line.

Bus services are provided by Stagecoach.

==Military==
Minster has a war memorial dedicated to those lost in World War I and World War II and this is located in St Mary&#x27;s church.

In 2013, Minster hosted a memorial for Jean de Selys Longchamps, a Belgian fighter pilot who is buried in Minster cemetery. This event was hosted by Minster &amp; Monkton Royal British Legion in conjunction with Minster Parish Council and was attended by such dignitaries as The Lord Lieutenant of Kent and the Chief of the Belgian Air Defense.

==Notable residents==
*St Augustine of Canterbury is said by the Venerable Bede to have landed with 40 men at Ebbsfleet, within the parish of Minster, before beginning his mission in Canterbury, commemorated by St Augustine&#x27;s Cross near Cliffsend.
*Richard Culmer, the infamous Puritan minister known locally as Blue Dick Culmer, was presented to the living but the people rejected him and his name - to this day - is still omitted from the role of incumbents in the church porch.

<doc id="155139" wikidata="Q315522" url="?curid=155139" title="Ne Win">
<text>Ne Win (; ; 24 May 1911 – 5 December 2002), born Shu Maung (; ), was a Burmese army general and politician who served as Prime Minister of Burma from 1958 to 1960 and 1962 to 1974, and also President of Burma from 1962 to 1981. Ne Win was Burma&#x27;s military dictator during the Socialist Burma period of 1962 to 1988.

Ne Win founded the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) and overthrew the democratic Union Parliament of U Nu in the 1962 Burmese coup d&#x27;état, establishing Burma as a one-party socialist state under the Burmese Way to Socialism ideology. Ne Win was Burma&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader as chairman of the BSPP, serving in various official titles as part of his military government, and was known by his supporters as [[Burmese name#Honorifics|U]] Ne Win. His rule was characterized by a non-aligned foreign policy, isolationism, one-party rule, economic stagnation, and superstition. Ne Win resigned in July 1988 in response to the 8888 Uprising that overthrew the Burma Socialist Programme Party, and was replaced by the military junta of the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). He held minor influence in the 1990s but was eventually placed under house arrest, under which he died in 2002.

In foreign affairs, Ne Win followed a strictly neutralist policy during the Cold War, participating in the Non-Aligned Movement and keeping his distance from both the United States and the Soviet Union. On the other hand, his relations with Mao Zedong and the People&#x27;s Republic of China were initially excellent, but were temporarily broken between 1967 and 1971, due to Mao&#x27;s covert support for the Communist insurgency within Burma and the outbreak of anti-Chinese riots by regime supporters; however, in March 1971 relations were fully restored and Chinese economic aid continued.

==Date of birth==
Ne Win&#x27;s date of birth is a subject of debate among various sources. The English-language publication &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Burma,&quot; published in 1961 by People&#x27;s Literature House, Rangoon, lists Ne Win&#x27;s birthdate as 14 May 1911. This date is also supported by Dr. Maung Maung in the Burmese version of his book &quot;Burma and General Ne Win&quot;, also published in English, that Ne Win was born on 14 May 1911. However, in a book written in Burmese titled &quot;The Thirty Comrades&quot;, the author Kyaw Nyein gave Ne Win&#x27;s date of birth as 10 July 1910. While May 24, 1911, is widely cited as Ne Win&#x27;s birthdate in many scholarly works and biographical references, the discrepancies among sources warrant acknowledgment. These conflicting accounts highlight the challenges in determining Ne Win&#x27;s exact birthdate and may stem from differences in historical documentation or cultural interpretations. Therefore, while May 24, 1911, is commonly accepted, alternative dates cannot be disregarded entirely.

Kyaw Nyein&#x27;s date of 1910 can be considered as the more plausible date. First, Kyaw Nyein had access to historical records and he interviewed many surviving members of the Thirty Comrades when he wrote the book in the mid-to late 1990s. (Ne Win was one of the Thirty Comrades who secretly went to undergo military training in the early 1940s for the purpose of fighting for independence from the British). In his book published around 1998, Kyaw Nyein lists the names of the surviving members of the Thirty Comrades whom he had interviewed, although Ne Win was not mentioned among them. Secondly, when Ne Win died on 5 December 2002, the Burmese language newspapers that were allowed to carry a paid obituary stated the age of &#x27;U Ne Win&#x27; to be &#x27;93 years&#x27;. According to Burmese custom, a person&#x27;s age is their age upon their next birthday. Since Ne Win turned 92 in July 2002, when he died in December 2002 he was considered to be 93 years old. Most Western news agencies, based on the May 1911 birth date, reported that Ne Win was 91 years old, but the obituary put up by his family (most probably his children) stated that he was 93 years old, which most likely stems from East Asian age reckoning.

==Early life and struggle for independence==
Ne Win, born Shu Maung, was born into an ethnic Chinese family in a small village near Paungdale about north of Rangoon. He spent two years at Rangoon University beginning in 1929, and took biology as his main subject with hopes of becoming a doctor. In 1931 he was expelled from the university after he failed an exam. Ne Win eventually became &quot;Thakin Shu Maung&quot;, or a member of the nationalist organisation Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association). Other members of the group included Aung San and U Nu. In 1941 Ne Win, as a member of the Ba Sein-Tun Ok (Socialist) faction of the Dobama, was one of thirty young men chosen for military training by the Japanese operative Colonel Suzuki Keiji. Their leader was Aung San and they formed the Burma Independence Army (BIA). During military training, Shu Maung chose a &quot;nom de guerre&quot;, Bo Ne Win (Commander Radiant Sun). In early 1942 the Japanese Army and the BIA entered Burma in the wake of the retreating British forces. Ne Win&#x27;s role in the campaign was to organize resistance behind the British lines.

The experience of the Japanese occupation of Burma worked to alienate the nationalists as well as the population at large. Toward the end of the Second World War, on 27 March 1945 the Burma National Army (BNA, successor to the BIA) turned against the Japanese following the British re-invasion of Burma. Ne Win, as one of the BNA Commanders, was quick to establish links with the British – attending the Kandy conference in Ceylon and taking charge of the anti-Communist operations in the Pyinmana area as commander of the 4th Burma Rifles after the Red Flag Communists and the Communist Party of Burma went underground to fight against the government in October 1946 and on 28 March 1948 respectively. Burma obtained independence on 4 January 1948, and for the first 14 years it had a parliamentary and democratic government mainly under Prime Minister U Nu, but the country was riven with political division. Even before independence, Aung San was assassinated together with six of his cabinet members on 19 July 1947; U Saw, a pre-war prime minister and political rival of Aung San, was found guilty of the crime and executed. U Nu as leader of the Socialists took charge of the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League (AFPFL) formed by the Communists, Socialists and the BNA in 1945 now that Aung San was dead and the Communists expelled from the AFPFL.

== Post-independence civil war ==
Following independence there were uprisings in the army and among ethnic minority groups. In late 1948, after a confrontation between army rivals, Ne Win was appointed second in command of the army and his rival Bo Zeya, a communist commander and fellow member of the Thirty Comrades, took a portion of the army into rebellion. Ne Win immediately adopted a policy of creating Socialist militia battalions called &#x27;Sitwundan&#x27; under his personal command with the approval of U Nu. On 31 January 1949, Ne Win was appointed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (Tatmadaw) and given total control of the army, replacing General Smith Dun, an ethnic Karen. He rebuilt and restructured the armed forces along the ruling Socialist Party&#x27;s political lines, but the country was still split and the government was ineffective.

=== Interim prime minister ===
He was asked to serve as interim prime minister from 28 October 1958 by U Nu, when the AFPFL split into two factions and U Nu barely survived a motion of no-confidence against his government in parliament. Ne Win restored order during the period known as the &quot;Ne Win caretaker government&quot;. Elections were held in February 1960 and Ne Win handed back power to the victorious U Nu on 4 April 1960.

==Military coup of 1962==

On 2 March 1962, Ne Win again seized power in a coup d&#x27;état. He became head of state as Chairman of the Union Revolutionary Council and also Prime Minister. The coup was characterized as &quot;bloodless&quot; by the world&#x27;s media. Declaring that &quot;parliamentary democracy was not suitable for Burma,&quot; the new regime suspended the constitution and dissolved the legislature.

Following riots at Rangoon University in July 1962, troops were sent to restore order. They fired on protesters and destroyed the student union building.

Shortly afterward, around 8 pm local time, Ne Win addressed the nation in a five-minute radio speech which concluded with the statement: &quot;If these disturbances were made to challenge us, I have to declare that we will fight sword with sword and spear with spear&quot;. On 13 July 1962, less than a week after the speech, Ne Win left for Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom &quot;for a medical check up&quot;. All universities were closed for more than two years until September 1964.

In 1988, 26 years later, Ne Win denied involvement in the dynamiting of the Student Union building, stating that his deputy Brigadier Aung Gyi – who by that time had fallen out with Ne Win and been dismissed – had given the order and that he had to take responsibility as a &quot;revolutionary leader&quot; by giving the &quot;sword with sword and spear with spear&quot; speech.

==Burmese Way to Socialism (1962–1988)==
Ne Win oversaw a number of reforms after taking power. The administration instituted a system including elements of nationalism, Marxism, and Buddhism, though Ne Win lacked interest in either ideology or religion – terming this the Burmese Way to Socialism. He founded the Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP), which in 1964 was formally declared to be the only legal party.

Following the 1962 coup, Ne Win&#x27;s government began implementing policies highlighting the centrality of Buremse language, Burmese culture, and Burmese Buddhism to the unity of the country. Such policies focused on the school curriuculum, military recruitment, and the advancement of Burmese-centric popular culture. Ethnic schools and hospitals were nationalized, and new staff assigned from Rangoon. When ethnic minority areas did not comply, the communities were attacked by the military. Collectively these policies later became known as General Ne Win&#x27;s &quot;Burmanization&quot; policies.

A system of state hospitals and institutions was established in Burma; medical care was free. Private hospitals were brought under public ownership. A new system of public education was introduced. A campaign to liquidate illiteracy was carried out starting in 1965. Between 1962 and 1965 important laws against landlords and usury were adopted. They aimed at protecting peasants&#x27; rights to land and property and to renting the land. These measures included the law abolishing rents on land.

On 2 March 1974, he disbanded the Revolutionary Council and proclaimed the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma. He was elected president of Myanmar and shortly afterward appointed Brigadier General Sein Win as Prime Minister. On 9 November 1981, Ne Win resigned as president and was succeeded in that post by General San Yu. However, Ne Win remained leader of the party and thus remained the ultimate political authority in the land until his resignation in 1988.

===Economic policies===

Ne Win&#x27;s government nationalized the economy and pursued a policy of autarky, which involved the economic isolation of Burma from the world. The ubiquitous black market and rampant smuggling supplied the needs of the people, while the central government slid slowly into bankruptcy. Autarky also involved expelling foreigners and restricting visits by foreigners to three days, and after 1972, one week. The Burmanization of the economy included the expulsion of many Chinese (along with Indians). Ne Win&#x27;s government prohibited foreigners from owning land and practicing certain professions. Even foreign aid organizations were banned; the only humanitarian aid permitted was on an intergovernmental basis. Furthermore, heavy-handed political oppression caused many in the educated workforce to emigrate.

Ne Win also took drastic steps regarding the currency. In 1985, he issued a decree that 25, 35, and 75 kyat notes would cease to be legal tender, alleging that they were subject to hoarding by black-marketeers and were also used to finance the various insurgencies. Though limited compensation was offered, this wiped out people&#x27;s savings overnight. At least one insurgency, that of the ethnic Kayan, was triggered by this act.

In 1987, reportedly on the recommendation of an astrologer that the number nine was auspicious, Ne Win ordered the withdrawal of several large-denomination kyat notes while issuing new denominations of 45 and 90 kyats. Both 45 and 90 are divisible by nine, and their numerals add up to nine. Again, millions of Burmese lost their life savings, and the demonetization also rendered about 75% of the entire kyat reserves completely useless. This crippled the Burmese economy further still. Ne Win was well known for his penchant for &quot;yadaya&quot; (traditional Burmese rituals performed in order to ward off misfortune). When his soothsayer warned him that there might be a bloodbath, he would stand in front of a mirror and trample on meat to simulate the blood, then shoot his reflection to avert the possibility of an assassination attempt.

Ne Win resigned as chairman of the ruling Burma Socialist Programme Party on 23 July 1988 at the height of the uprising against his regime, and roughly one year after the United Nations declared Burma a &quot;Least Developed Country&quot;.

===Student and worker riots===
Sporadic protests against the government continued. Students led protests in 1965, December 1969, and December 1970. These demonstrations took place mainly on campuses located in the cities of Rangoon, Mandalay and Moulmein and were often followed by the closure of universities and colleges. In June 1974, workers from more than 100 factories throughout the nation participated in a strike, to which the government reacted by shooting about 100 workers and students on 6 June 1974 at the Thamaing Textile Factory and the Sinmalaik Dock Yard in Rangoon. Since Ne Win was in Australia on an official visit at the time, responsibility for these shootings is unclear. On 5 December 1974, students turned the funeral of former UN Secretary General U Thant into a demonstration, snatching the coffin on display at the Kyaikkasan Race Course and erecting a makeshift mausoleum on the grounds of the former Student Union building in protest against the government for not honouring their famous countryman with a state funeral. The military stormed the campus on 11 December, killing some of the students, recovered the coffin and buried U Thant at the foot of the Shwedagon pagoda, next to the tomb of Thakin Kodaw Hmaing.

=== 1967 anti-Chinese riots ===

In February 1963, the Enterprise Nationalization Law was passed, effectively nationalizing all major industries and prohibiting the formation of new factories. This law adversely affected many industrialists and entrepreneurs, especially those without full citizenship. The government&#x27;s economic nationalization program further prohibited foreigners, including the non-citizen Chinese, from owning land, sending remittances, getting business licenses and practicing medicine. Such policies led to the beginnings of a major exodus of Burmese Chinese to other countries – some 100,000 Chinese left Burma.

Since Ne Win made Burmese the medium of instruction, many Chinese-language schools had to be closed. When the Chinese embassy in Rangoon distributed Mao&#x27;s red books in Burma, many Chinese went out on the streets in support of the Cultural Revolution. They were attacked by Burmese citizens, the most violent riots taking place in 1967. Beginning in 1967 and continuing throughout the 1970s, anti-Chinese riots continued to flare up, as many elements in Burma tried to spread the Cultural Revolution. Many believed they were covertly supported by the government. Similarly, Chinese shops were looted and set on fire. Public attention was successfully diverted by Ne Win from the uncontrollable inflation, scarcity of consumer items and rising prices of rice. The 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese (as it stratified citizenship into three categories: full, associate, and naturalized) and severely limited Burmese Chinese, especially those without full citizenship and those holding FRCs, from attending professional tertiary schools, including medical, engineering, agricultural and economics institutions. During this period, the country&#x27;s failing economy and widespread discrimination accelerated an emigration of Burmese Chinese out of Burma.

==8888 Uprising, resignation, and military coup (1975–1988)==

Students from universities throughout Rangoon demonstrated again in June 1975 in commemoration of the previous year&#x27;s Labour Strike. Student-led demonstrations also occurred in March 1976, September 1987, March and June 1988. In August and September 1988, these demonstrations turned into a nationwide uprising against BSPP rule in what is now known as the &#x27;Four Eights Uprising&#x27;.

The 8888 uprising was started by students in Yangon (Rangoon) on 8 August 1988. Student protests spread throughout the country. Hundreds of thousands of monks, children, university students, housewives, doctors and common people protested against the government. The uprising ended on 18 September after a bloody military coup by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC). Thousands of deaths have been attributed to the military during this uprising, while authorities in Myanmar put the figure at around 350 people killed.

At the height of the Four Eights Uprising against the BSPP, Ne Win resigned as party chairman on 23 July 1988. In a truculent farewell speech to the BSPP Party Congress, he warned that if the &quot;disturbances&quot; continued the &quot;army would have to be called and I would like to declare from here that if the army shoots it has no tradition of shooting into the air. It would shoot straight to hit.&quot; The Tatmadaw troops shot, killed and maimed hundreds if not up to 3,000 or more demonstrators in various places throughout Burma from the period of 8 to 12 August 1988 and again on 18 September 1988, proving that Ne Win&#x27;s farewell speech was not an empty threat.

On 18 September 1988 the military led by Senior General Saw Maung dispelled any hopes for democracy by brutally crushing the uprisings. It is widely believed that Ne Win, though in apparent retirement, orchestrated the coup from behind the scenes.

For about ten years, Ne Win kept a low profile but remained a shadowy figure exercising at least some influence on the military junta. After 1998, Ne Win&#x27;s influence on the junta began to wane.

==Death and funeral==
Still under house arrest, Ne Win died on 5 December 2002 at his lakeside house in Yangon. The death remained unannounced by Burmese media or the junta. The only mention of Ne Win&#x27;s death was a paid obituary notice that appeared in some of the government-controlled Burmese language newspapers. Ne Win was not given a state funeral, and his former contacts or junior colleagues were strongly discouraged from attending a hastily arranged funeral, so that only thirty people attended the funeral.

Ne Win&#x27;s daughter Sandar Win was temporarily released from house arrest to attend his funeral and cremation. She later dispersed her father&#x27;s ashes into the Hlaing River.

Ne Win&#x27;s grandson Aye Ne Win and Kyaw Ne Win were released in 2013.

==Family==
Ne Win was married six times:

# He was first married to Daw Than Nyunt, who bore him a son, Kyaw Thein.
# He was second married to Tin Tin, who bore him two sons, Ngwe Soe and Aye Aung.
# He then married Khin May Than (Katie Ba Than), daughter of Professor Ba Than, the former dean of Rangoon medical school. The couple had two daughters and a son between them, Sandar Win, Kye Mon Win, and Phyo Wai Win. Khin May Than brought three daughters from her first marriage, Le Le Win and twins Thida Win and Thawdar Win, into the family. Khin May Than was Ne Win&#x27;s favourite wife and her death in 1972 was a heavy blow to him.
# He then married Ni Ni Myint, a university teacher, whom he divorced.
# He then married June Rose Bellamy (Yadana Nat-mei), a great granddaughter of Crown Prince Ka Naung.
# He remarried his former wife Ni Ni Myint.

<text>Hair removal is the deliberate removal of body hair or head hair. This process is also known as epilation or depilation.

Hair is a common feature of the human body, exhibiting considerable variation in thickness and length across different populations. Hair becomes more visible during and after puberty. Additionally, men typically exhibit thicker and more conspicuous body hair than women.
Both males and females have visible body hair on the head, eyebrows, eyelashes, armpits, genital area, arms, and legs. Males and some females may also have thicker hair growth on their face, abdomen, back, buttocks, anus, areola, chest, nostrils, and ears. Hair does not generally grow on the lips, back of the ear, the underside of the hands or feet, or on certain areas of the genitalia.

Hair removal may be practiced for cultural, aesthetic, hygienic, sexual, medical, or religious reasons. Forms of hair removal have been practiced in almost all human cultures since at least the Neolithic era. The methods used to remove hair have varied in different times and regions.

The term &quot;depilation&quot; is derived from the Medieval Latin &quot;depilatio,&quot; which in turn is derived from the Latin &quot;depilare,&quot; a word formed from the prefix &quot;de-&quot; and the root &quot;pilus,&quot; meaning &quot;hair.&quot;

==History==
For centuries, hair removal has long shaped gender roles, served to signify social status and defined notions of femininity and the ideal &quot;body image&quot;. In early periods, the condition of being hairless was mostly done as a way to keep the body clean, using flint, seashells, beeswax and various other depilatory utensils and exfoliator substances, some highly questionable and highly caustic. Ancient Rome also associated hair removal with status: a person with smooth skin was associated with purity and superiority. Removing body hair was done by both men and women
Psilothrum or psilotrum () and dropax () were depilatories in ancient Greece and Rome.

In Ancient Egypt, besides being a fashion statement for affluent Egyptians of all genders, hair removal served as a treatment for louse infestation, which was a prevalent issue in the region. Very often, they would replace the removed head hair with a Nubian wig, which was seen as easier to maintain and also fashionable. Ancient Egyptian priests also shaved or depilated all over daily, so as to present a &quot;pure&quot; body before the images of the gods.

In ancient times, one highly abrasive depilatory paste consisted of an admixture of slaked lime, water, wood-ash and yellow orpiment (arsenic trisulfide); In rural India and Iran, where this mixture is called &quot;vajibt&quot;, it is still commonly used to remove pubic hair. In other cultures, oil extracted from unripe olives (which had not reached one-third of their natural stage of ripeness) was used to remove body hair.

During the medieval period, Catholic women were expected to let their hair grow long as a display of femininity, whilst keeping the hair concealed by wearing a wimple headdress in public places. The face was the only area where hair growth was considered unsightly; 14th-century ladies would also pick off hair from their foreheads to recede the hairline and give their face a more oval form. From the mid-16th century, it is said when Queen Elizabeth I came to power, she made eyebrow removal fashionable.

By the 18th century, body hair removal was still considered a non-necessity by European and American women. But in 1760, when the first safety straight razor appeared for men to safely shave their beard and not inadvertently cut themselves, some women allegedly used this safety razor too. It was invented in Paris by the French master cutler , author of &quot;La pogonotomie, ou L&#x27;art d&#x27;apprendre à se raser soi-même&quot; (Pogonotomy, or The Art of Learning to Shave).

It was not until the late 19th century that women in Europe and America started to make hair removal a component of their personal care regime. According to Rebecca Herzig, the modern-day notion of body hair being unwomanly can be traced back to Charles Darwin&#x27;s book first published in 1871 &quot;The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex&quot;. Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection associated body hair with &quot;primitive ancestry and an atavistic return to earlier less developed forms&quot;, writes Herzig, a professor of gender and sexuality studies at Bates College in Maine. Darwin also suggests having less body hair was an indication of being more evolved and sexually attractive. As Darwin&#x27;s ideas polarized, other 19th century medical and scientific experts started to link hairiness to &quot;sexual inversion, disease pathology, lunacy, and criminal violence&quot;. Those connotations were mostly applied to women&#x27;s and not men&#x27;s body hair.

By the early 20th century, the upper- and middle-class white America increasingly saw smooth skin as a marker of femininity, and female body hair as repulsive, with hair removal giving &quot;a way to separate oneself from cruder people, lower class and immigrant&quot;.

Harper&#x27;s Bazaar, in 1915, was the first women&#x27;s fashion magazine to run a campaign devoted to the removal of underarm hair as &quot;a necessity&quot;. Shortly after, Gillette launched the first safety razor marketed specifically for women—the &quot;Milady Décolleté Gillette&quot;, one that solves &quot;...an embarrassing personal problem&quot; and keeps the underarm &quot;...white and smooth&quot;.

==Cultural and sexual aspects==

Body hair characteristics such as thickness and length vary across human populations, some people have less pronounced body hair and others have more conspicuous body hair characteristics.

Each culture of human society developed social norms relating to the presence or absence of body hair, which has changed from one time to another. Different standards of human physical appearance and physical attractiveness can apply to females and males. People whose hair falls outside a culture&#x27;s aesthetic body image standards may experience real or perceived social acceptance problems, psychological distress and social pressure. For example, for women in several societies, exposure in public of body hair other than head hair, eyelashes and eyebrows is generally considered to be unaesthetic, unattractive and embarrassing.

With the increased popularity in many countries of women wearing fashion clothing, sportswear and swimsuits during the 20th century and the consequential exposure of parts of the body on which hair is commonly found, there has emerged a popularization for women to remove visible body hair, such as on legs, underarms and elsewhere, or the consequences of hirsutism and hypertrichosis. In most of the Western world, for example, the vast majority of women regularly shave their legs and armpits, while roughly half also shave hair that may become exposed around their bikini pelvic area (often termed the &quot;bikini line&quot;).

In Western and Asian cultures, in contrast to most Middle Eastern cultures, a majority of men are accustomed to shaving their facial hair, so only a minority of men reveal a beard, even though fast-growing facial hair must be shaved daily to achieve a clean-shaven or beardless appearance. Some men shave because they cannot genetically grow a &quot;full&quot; beard (generally defined as an even density from cheeks to neck), their beard color is genetically different from their scalp hair color, or because their facial hair grows in many directions, making a groomed or contoured appearance difficult to achieve. Some men shave because their beard growth is excessive, unpleasant, or coarse, causing skin irritation. Some men grow a beard or moustache from time to time to change their appearance or visual style.

Some men tonsure or head shave, either as a religious practice, a fashion statement, or because they find a shaved head preferable to the appearance of male pattern baldness, or in order to attain enhanced cooling of the skull – particularly for people suffering from hyperhidrosis. A much smaller number of Western women also shave their heads, often as a fashion or political statement.

Some women also shave their heads for cultural or social reasons. In India, tradition required widows in some sections of the society to shave their heads as part of being ostracized (see ). The outlawed custom is still infrequently encountered mostly in rural areas. Society at large and the government are working to end the practice of ostracizing widows. In addition, it continues to be common practice for men to shave their heads prior to embarking on a pilgrimage.

The unibrow is considered a sign of beauty and attractiveness for women in Oman and for both genders in Tajikistan, often emphasized with kohl. In Middle Eastern societies, regular trimming or removal of female and male underarm hair and pubic hair has been considered proper personal hygiene, necessitated by local customs, for many centuries. Young girls and unmarried women, however, are expected to retain their body hair until shortly before marriage, when the whole body is depilated from the neck down.

In China, body hair has long been regarded as normal, and even today women are confronted with far less social pressure to remove body hair. The same attitude exists in other countries in Asia. While hair removal has become routine for many of the continent&#x27;s younger women, trimming or removing pubic hair, for instance, is not as common or popular as in the Western world, where both women and men may trim or remove all their pubic hair for aesthetic or sexual reasons. This custom can be motivated by reasons of potentially increased personal cleanliness or hygiene, heightened sensitivity during sexual activity, or the desire to take on a more exposed appearance or visual appeal, or to boost self-esteem when affected by excessive hair. In Korea, pubic hair has long been considered a sign of fertility and sexual health, and it has been reported in the mid-2010s that some Korean women were undergoing pubic hair transplants, to add extra hair, especially when affected by the condition of pubic atrichosis (or hypotrichosis), which is thought to affect a small percentage of Korean women.

Unwanted or excessive hair is often removed in preparatory situations by both sexes, in order to avoid any perceived social stigma or prejudice. For example, unwanted or excessive hair may be removed in preparation for an intimate encounter, or before visiting a public beach or swimming pool.

Though traditionally in Western culture women remove body hair and men do not, some women choose not to remove hair from their bodies, either as a non-necessity or as an act of rejection against social stigma, while some men remove or trim their body hair, a practice that is referred to in modern society as being a part of &quot;manscaping&quot; (a portmanteau expression for male-specific grooming).

===Fashions===
The term &quot;glabrousness&quot; also has been applied to human fashions, wherein some participate in culturally motivated hair removal by depilation (surface removal by shaving, dissolving), or (removal of the entire hair, such as waxing or plucking).

Although the appearance of secondary hair on parts of the human body commonly occurs during puberty, and therefore, is often seen as a symbol of adulthood, removal of this and other hair may become fashionable in some cultures and subcultures. In many modern Western cultures, men are encouraged to shave their beards, and women are encouraged to remove hair growth in various areas. Commonly depilated areas for women are the underarms, legs, and pubic hair. Some individuals depilate the forearms. In recent years, bodily depilation in men has increased in popularity among some subcultures of Western males.

For men, the practice of depilating the pubic area is common, especially for aesthetic reasons. Most men will use a razor to shave this area, however, as best practice, it is recommended to use a body trimmer to shorten the length of the hair before shaving it off completely.

===Cultural and other influences===
In ancient Egypt, depilation was commonly practiced, with pumice and razors used to shave. In both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, the removal of body and pubic hair may have been practiced among both men and women. It is represented in some artistic depictions of male and female nudity, examples of which may be seen in red figure pottery and sculptures like the Kouros of Ancient Greece in which both men and women were depicted without body or pubic hair. Emperor Augustus was said, by Suetonius, to have applied &quot;hot nutshells&quot; on his legs as a form of depilation.

In the clothes free movement, the term &quot;smoothie&quot; refers to an individual who has removed their body hair. In the past, such practices were frowned upon and in some cases, forbidden: violators could face exclusion from the club. Enthusiasts grouped together and formed societies of their own that catered to that fashion, and smoothies became a major percentage at some nudist venues. The first Smoothie club (TSC) was founded by a British couple in 1991. A Dutch branch was founded in 1993 in order to give the idea of a hairless body greater publicity in the Netherlands. Being a Smoothie is described by its supporters as exceptionally comfortable and liberating. The Smoothy-Club is also a branch of the World of the Nudest Nudist (WNN) and organizes nudist ship cruises and regular nudist events.

==Other reasons==
===Religion===
Head-shaving (tonsure) is a part of some Buddhist, Christian, Muslim, Jain and Hindu traditions. Buddhist and Christian monks generally undergo some form of tonsure during their induction into monastic life.

Within Amish society, tradition ordains men to stop shaving a part of their facial hair upon marriage and grow a Shenandoah style beard which serves the significance of wearing a wedding ring, moustaches are rejected as they are regarded as martial (traditionally associated with the military).

In Judaism (see Shaving in Judaism), there is no obligation for women to remove body hair or facial hair, unless they wish to do so. However, in preparation for a woman&#x27;s immersion in a ritual bath after concluding her days of purification (following her menstrual cycle), the custom of Jewish women is to shave off their pubic hair. During a mourning ritual, Jewish men are restricted in the Torah and Halakha to using scissors and prohibited from using a razor blade to shave their beards or sideburns, and, by custom, neither men nor women may cut or shave their hair during the &quot;shiva&quot; period.

The Baháʼí Faith recommends against complete and long-term head-shaving outside of medical purposes. It is not currently practiced as a law, contingent upon a future decision by the Universal House of Justice, its highest governing body. Sikhs take an even stronger stance, opposing all forms of hair removal. One of the &quot;Five Ks&quot; of Sikhism is Kesh, meaning &quot;hair&quot;. Baptized Sikhs are specifically instructed to have unshorn Kesh (the hair on their head and beards for men) as a major tenet of the Sikh faith. To Sikhs, the maintenance and management of long hair is a manifestation of one&#x27;s piety. 

The majority of Muslims believe that adult removal of pubic and axillary hair, as a hygienic measure, is religiously beneficial. Under Muslim law (Sharia), it is recommended to keep the beard. A Muslim may trim or cut hair on the head. In the 9th century, the use of chemical depilatories for women was introduced by Ziryab in Al-Andalus.

===Medical===
The body hair of surgical patients is often removed beforehand on the skin surrounding surgical sites. Shaving was the primary form of hair removal until reports in 1983 showed that it may lead to an increased risk of infection. Clippers are now the recommended pre-surgical hair removal method. A 2021 systematic review brought together evidence on different techniques for hair removal before surgery. This involved 25 studies with a total of 8919 participants. Using a razor probably increases the chance of developing a surgical site infection compared to using clippers or hair removal cream or not removing hair before surgery. Removing hair on the day of surgery rather than the day before may also slightly reduce the number of infections.

Some people with trichiasis find it medically necessary to remove ingrown eyelashes.

The shaving of hair has sometimes been used in attempts to eradicate lice or to minimize body odor due to the accumulation of odor-causing micro-organisms in hair. In extreme situations, people may need to remove all body hair to prevent or combat infestation by lice, fleas and other parasites. Such a practice was used, for example, in Ancient Egypt.

It has been suggested that an increasing percentage of humans removing their pubic hair has led to reduced crab louse populations in some parts of the world.

===In the military===
A buzz cut or completely shaven haircut is common in military organizations where, among other reasons, it is considered to promote uniformity and neatness. Most militaries have occupational safety and health policies that govern the hair length and hairstyles permitted; in the field and living in close-quarter environments where bathing and sanitation can be difficult, soldiers can be susceptible to parasite infestation such as head lice, that are more easily propagated with long and unkempt hair. It also requires less maintenance in the field and in adverse weather it dries more quickly. Short hair is also less likely to cause severe burns from flash flame exposure (as a result of flash fires from explosions) which can easily set hair alight. Short hair can also minimize interference with safety equipment and fittings attached to the head, such as combat helmets and NBC suits. Militaries may also require men to maintain clean-shaven faces as facial hair can prevent an air-tight seal between the face and military gas masks or other respiratory equipment, such as a pilot&#x27;s oxygen mask, or full-face diving mask. The process of testing whether a mask adequately fits the face is known as a &quot;respirator fit test&quot;.

In many militaries, head-shaving (known as the induction cut) is mandatory for men when beginning their recruit training. However, even after the initial recruitment phase, when head-shaving is no longer required, many soldiers maintain a completely or partially shaven hairstyle (such as a &quot;high and tight&quot;, &quot;flattop&quot; or &quot;buzz cut&quot;) for personal convenience or neatness. Head-shaving is not required and is often not permitted for women in military service, although they must have their hair cut or tied to regulation length. For example, the shortest hair a female soldier can have in the U.S. Army is 1/4 inch from the scalp.

===In sport===
It is a common practice for professional footballers (soccer players) and road cyclists to remove leg hair for a number of reasons. In the case of a crash or tackle, the absence of the leg hair means the injuries (usually road rash or scarring) can be cleaned up more efficiently, and treatment is not impeded. Professional cyclists, as well as professional footballers, also receive regular leg massages, and the absence of hair reduces the friction and increases their comfort and effectiveness. Football players are also required to wear shin guards, and in case of a skin rash, the affected area can be treated more efficiently.

It is also common for competitive swimmers to shave the hair off their legs, arms, and torsos (and even their whole bodies from the neckline down), to reduce drag and provide a heightened &quot;feel&quot; for the water by removing the exterior layer of skin along with the body hair.

===As punishment===
In some situations, people&#x27;s hair is shaved as a punishment or a form of humiliation. After World War II, head-shaving was a common punishment in France, the Netherlands, and Norway for women who had collaborated with the Nazis during the occupation, and, in particular, for women who had sexual relations with an occupying soldier.

In the United States, during the Vietnam War, conservative students would sometimes attack student radicals or &quot;hippies&quot; by shaving beards or cutting long hair. One notorious incident occurred at Stanford University, when unruly fraternity members grabbed &quot;Resistance&quot; founder (and student-body president) David Harris, cut off his long hair, and shaved his beard.

During European witch-hunts of the Medieval and Early Modern periods, alleged witches were stripped naked and their entire body shaved to discover the so-called witches&#x27; marks. The discovery of witches&#x27; marks was then used as evidence in trials.

Inmates have their heads shaved upon entry at certain prisons.

==Forms of hair removal and methods==
* Depilation is the removal of the part of the hair above the surface of the skin. The most common form of depilation is shaving or trimming. Another option is the use of chemical depilatories, which work by breaking the disulfide bonds that link the protein chains that give hair its strength.
* Epilation is the removal of the entire hair, including the part below the skin. Methods include waxing, sugaring, epilators, lasers, threading, intense pulsed light or electrology. Hair is also sometimes removed by plucking with tweezers.

===Depilation methods===
&quot;Depilation&quot;, or temporary removal of hair to the level of the skin, lasts several hours to several days and can be achieved by
* Shaving or (manually or with electric shavers which can be used on pubic hair or body hair)
* Depilatories (creams or &quot;shaving powders&quot; which chemically dissolve hair)
* Friction (rough surfaces used to away hair)

===Epilation methods===
&quot;Epilation&quot;, or removal of the entire hair from the root, lasts several days to several weeks and may be achieved by
* Tweezing (hairs are tweezed, or pulled out, with tweezers or with fingers)
* Waxing (a hot or cold layer is applied and then removed with porous strips)
* Sugaring (hair is removed by applying a sticky paste to the skin in the direction of hair growth and then peeling off with a porous strip)
* Threading (also called &quot;fatlah&quot; or &quot;khite&quot; in Arabic, or &quot;band&quot; in Persian) in which a twisted thread catches hairs as it is rolled across the skin
* Epilators (mechanical devices that rapidly grasp hairs and pull them out).
* Drugs that directly attack hair growth or inhibit the development of new hair cells. Hair growth will become less and less until it finally stops; normal depilation/epilation will be performed until that time. Hair growth will return to normal if use of product is discontinued. Products include the following:
** The pharmaceutical drug eflornithine hydrochloride (with the trade names Vaniqa and Follinil) inhibits the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, preventing new hair cells from producing putrescine for stabilizing their DNA.
** Antiandrogens, including spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and finasteride, can be used to reduce or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and dutasteride, antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.

===Permanent hair removal===
Electrology has been practiced in the United States since 1875. It is approved by the FDA. This technique permanently destroys germ cells responsible for hair growth by way of the insertion of a fine probe into the hair follicle and the application of a current adjusted to each hair type and treatment area. Electrology is the only permanent hair removal method recognized by the FDA.

===Permanent hair reduction===
* Laser hair removal (lasers and laser diodes): Laser hair removal technology became widespread in the US and many other countries from the 1990s onwards. It has been approved in the United States by the FDA since 1997. With this technology, light is directed at the hair and is absorbed by dark pigment, resulting in the destruction of the hair follicle. This hair removal method sometimes becomes permanent after several sessions. The number of sessions needed depends upon the amount and type of hair being removed. 
* Intense pulsed light (IPL) This technology is becoming more common for at-home devices, many of which are advertised as &quot;laser hair removal&quot; but actually use IPL technology.
* Diode epilation (high energy LEDs but not laser diodes)

==Clinical comparisons of effectiveness==
A 2006 review article in the journal &quot;Lasers in Medical Science&quot; compared intense pulsed light (IPL) and both alexandrite and diode lasers. The review found no statistical difference in effectiveness, but a higher incidence of side effects with diode laser-based treatment. Hair reduction after 6 months was reported as 68.75% for alexandrite lasers, 71.71% for diode lasers, and 66.96% for IPL. Side effects were reported as 9.5% for alexandrite lasers, 28.9% for diode lasers, and 15.3% for IPL. All side effects were found to be temporary and even pigmentation changes returned to normal within 6 months.

A 2006 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that alexandrite and diode lasers caused 50% hair reduction for up to 6 months, while there was no evidence of hair reduction from intense pulsed light, neodymium-YAG or ruby lasers.

===Experimental or banned methods===
* Photodynamic therapy for hair removal (experimental)
* X-ray hair removal is an efficient, and usually permanent, hair removal method, but also causes severe health problems, occasional disfigurement, and even death. It is illegal in the United States.

===Doubtful methods===
Many methods have been proposed or sold over the years without published clinical proof they can work as claimed.
* Electric tweezers
* Transdermal electrolysis
* Transcutaneous hair removal
* Microwave hair removal
* Foods and dietary supplements
* Non-prescription topical preparations (also called &quot;hair inhibitors&quot;, &quot;hair retardants&quot;, or &quot;hair growth inhibitors&quot;)

==Advantages and disadvantages==
There are several disadvantages to many of these hair removal methods. 

Hair removal can cause issues: skin inflammation, minor burns, lesions, scarring, ingrown hairs, bumps, and infected hair follicles (folliculitis).

Some removal methods are not permanent, can cause medical problems and permanent damage, or have very high costs. Some of these methods are still in the testing phase and have not been clinically proven.

One issue that can be considered an advantage or a disadvantage depending upon an individual&#x27;s viewpoint, is that removing hair has the effect of removing information about the individual&#x27;s hair growth patterns due to genetic predisposition, illness, androgen levels (such as from pubertal hormonal imbalances or drug side effects), and/or gender status.

In the hair follicle, stem cells reside in a discrete microenvironment called the bulge, located at the base of the part of the follicle that is established during morphogenesis but does not degenerate during the hair cycle. The bulge contains multipotent stem cells that can be recruited during wound healing to help repair the epidermis.

<text>Oudenaarde (; ; in English sometimes &quot;Oudenarde&quot;) is a Belgian city and municipality in the Flemish province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the city of Oudenaarde proper and the towns of Bevere, Edelare, Eine, Ename, Heurne, Leupegem, Mater, Melden, Mullem, Nederename, Volkegem, Welden and a part of Ooike.

From the 15th to the 18th century, but especially in the 16th century, Oudenaarde was known as a centre of tapestry production. The town&#x27;s name, meaning &quot;old field&quot;, still lingers on in &quot;outnal&quot;, an obsolete English term for a kind of brown linen thread.

==History==


===The glory of Ename===
The history of the current municipality of Oudenaarde starts in 974, when Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Germany, built one of its three fortifications on the Scheldt at Ename to protect his kingdom against possible attacks from Francia (next to the other frontier post at Valenciennes, later in also the Margraviate of Antwerp). Ename grew very fast. By 1005, the town already had a couple of churches and had become the largest town in the Duchy of Lotharingia. In 1034, Ename was destroyed by an irregular army that surrendered the city to Count Baldwin IV. In 1047, the son of Baldwin V (peacefully) received the imperial fief from the German emperor. The fief was, however, confiscated in 1047 when he Baldwins rebelled against the German empire. In 1062, Baldwin V, together with his wife, founded the Benedictine abbey of Saint Salvator. By that time, the former merchants and guild artisans of Ename easily got across the Scheldt to the recently founded city of Oudenaarde.

===Oudenaarde’s golden age===
In the 11th century, Oudenaarde’s economy flourished, thanks to the proximity of the Scheldt and to the burgeoning, but vibrant cloth and tapestry industry. Churches, cloisters and hospitals were built. Throughout the Middle Ages, the city was one of the staunchest supporters of the counts of Flanders, defending them against insurrections from the South, and even from Ghent. The city became known as the &quot;residence of the nobles&quot;. It built itself a flagship town hall (built 1526–1537), which we can still admire today, and the St-Walburga church. Charles V stayed here for a couple of months in 1522 and fathered an illegitimate daughter, Margaret of Parma, who was to become Regent of the Netherlands.

===Decline===

During the Reformation, the people of Oudenaarde chose Protestantism and allied themselves with Ghent against Charles V. In 1582, after a prolonged siege by Margaret&#x27;s son, Alexander Farnese, the city finally gave in, causing most merchants, workers, and even nobles to flee. Oudenaarde fell under the Counter-Reformation, which for a short while revived the commerce of tapestry. The glory days, however, never came back. The French attacked and took the city three times in less than a century. Fortifications were repeatedly improved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including additions by Vauban. In 1708, one of the key battles in the War of the Spanish Succession, known as the Battle of Oudenaarde, was fought in the vicinity of the city. Oudenaarde slumbered as a provincial town under the Habsburg regime. Like its neighbours, in the 1790s it suffered religious curtailment imposed by the French Revolution.

The city later suffered damage during World War I, which is commemorated by several monuments scattered around town.

During World War II the town was occupied by Nazi German forces in May 1940. The town was liberated by British forces on the 5th of September 1944.

==Beer==

Oudenaarde is known for the brewing of Oud bruin beer, which is sometimes termed Oudenaarde Oud bruin, especially that of Liefmans Brewery in the town.

Oud Bruin (Old Brown), also known as Flanders Brown, is a style of beer originating from the Flemish region of Belgium. The Dutch name refers to the long aging process, up to a year. It undergoes a secondary fermentation, which takes several weeks to a month, and is followed by bottle ageing for several more months. The extended ageing allows residual yeast and bacteria to develop a sour flavour characteristic for this style. Usually, cultured yeast and bacteria are used, as stainless steel does not harbour wild organisms as wood does.

==Sights==
* The Flamboyant Gothic–style Town Hall and its Belfry were designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1999. The city hall houses a unique collection of Oudenaarde tapestries.
* The Church of Our Lady of Pamele, begun in 1234 on the banks of the Scheldt, and the Church of St Walburga near the market square, are both worth a visit.
* Oudenaarde is also home to the Centrum Tour of Flanders, a museum dedicated to the Tour of Flanders cycling race.
* Since 2008 the village of Mater in Oudenaarde has been the home of Belgium&#x27;s smallest craft brewery: the Smisje Brewery (previously located in Bruges).

==Events==
*Recurring events include a beer fest in June, an open-air musical festival in the summer, and an agricultural fair in February.
*Every ten years, one of the largest floral displays in Flanders takes place on the market square (&quot;Grote Markt&quot;). The last one took place in 2005.

== Newspaper ==

Oudenaarde used to have its own newspaper, namely &quot;the Gazette van Audenaerde&quot;.

==Sports==
The main football club in Oudenaarde is K.S.V. Oudenaarde.

The celebrated &quot;Tour of Flanders voor Vrouwen&quot;, the women&#x27;s Tour of Flanders cycle race, starts in Oudenaarde every spring. The men&#x27;s Tour of Flanders has passed through Oudenaarde on several occasions, finishing in the town since 2012, and it regularly ascends the Koppenberg hill in the municipality. The Koppenbergcross cyclo-cross race, which takes place on the Koppenberg hillside, is part of the BPost Bank Trophy.

Rhinos Rugby Oudenaarde is a rugby club in Oudenaarde that was voted the coolest club of Flanders in 2018.

<text>Ronse (; ) is a Belgian city and a municipality in the Flemish province of East Flanders. The municipality only encompasses the city of Ronse proper.

== History ==

=== Early settlements to 14th century ===

The hills around Ronse show clues of human activity in the Paleolithic period. In the Neolithic, the area was populated with settled farmers and cattle breeders. Assorted fragments of building structures also attest of settlements in the area during Roman times. Ronse&#x27;s urban center took shape in the 7th century, when Saint Amand – or one of his successors – built a church and monastery in honour of Saint Peter and Saint Paul. In the 9th century, Ronse and its monastery were given to the Inde Monastery (in Cornelismünster, near Aachen) by Louis the Pious. It is around that time that the relics of Saint Hermes arrived in Ronse. During those troubled times, Viking raids forced the monks to flee the town more than once, and the monastery was burnt by the Normans in 880. The relics were recovered in 940 and housed in a Romanesque-style crypt in 1083. The church of Saint Hermes, which was later built on top of the crypt, was consecrated in 1129. A pilgrimage in honour of the Saint, who had by then become known to cure mental illnesses, sustained the local economy. There is still a French saying today which translates as &quot;Saint Hermes cures the area&#x27;s madmen but keeps the Ronse dwellers as they are&quot;. The Lord of Ronse, Gerard de Wautripont, who was also in charge of the Inde Monastery at that time, gave the town all the privileges of a city in 1240. A few years later, the economy was flourishing and the Inde Monastery sold all its Ronse-based possessions. Until the French Revolution, the Ronse seigneury – a barony as of 1549 – included an enclave, the Ronse Franchise, which was administered by the Chapter of Saint Hermes with complete juridical and fiscal independence and its own justice system.

=== Renaissance and Old Regime ===

On March 26, 1478, French troops pillaged and burned the city. It quickly recovered, however, thanks to its booming economy based on the fabrication and preparation of linen. Around the middle of the 16th century, the city became an important Calvinist center in the Spanish Netherlands. The religious troubles of that century, especially the terrible repression of the Duke of Alba, forced a large number of the city&#x27;s weavers and fullers to find permanent refuge in Holland, England, and Germany. The fire of July 21, 1559 completely ruined the city. At the beginning of the 17th century, Ronse took advantage of the relative peaceful period under the archdukes Ferdinand and Isabella to get back on its feet. It is during that period that one of the most beautiful castles of the Southern Netherlands (demolished in 1823) was built for Count Jean de Nassau-Siegen, baron of Ronse since 1629, the castle of Ronse. The plague in 1635–1636 nearly emptied the city. Despite opposition by the King of Spain, Ronse was annexed to France from 1680 to 1700. During the following Austrian period, on March 31, 1719, a gigantic fire again turned most of the city to ashes. Thanks to the perseverance of its inhabitants, Ronse could again rank as a city, with its commerce and businesses still based on the textile industry.

=== After the French Revolution ===

The Fleurus Victory, on June 26, 1794, allowed France to occupy and annex the country. Ronse faced important expropriations and the city soon found itself in financial difficulty. In 1796, the old city administration was disbanded and a municipality was created. French legislation was applied from this point on, until Belgium merged with the Netherlands in 1815. In 1798, the so-called &quot;farmers&#x27; war&quot;, a reaction to the military conscription imposed by France, cost many lives. In 1799, Ronse counted about 10,000 inhabitants but a third of the population lived in poverty. In 1840, within the newly created Kingdom of Belgium, more than 55% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants derived a living from the textile industry. A few years later, however, increased mechanisation gave rise to a deep economic crisis. Many left Ronse to join the textile plants in Northern France (Lille-Roubaix-Tourcoing) or to take on agricultural work in the Somme or the Oise. From the 1870s, Ronse&#x27;s textile industry prospered despite a temporary slow down during World War I. The decline of this industry started after World War II but was especially acute during the 1960s. Today, Ronse is mainly a commercial center and a touristic destination.

<text>Sir Arthur Edward Drummond Bliss (2 August 189127 March 1975) was an English composer and conductor.

Bliss&#x27;s musical training was cut short by the First World War, in which he served with distinction in the army. In the post-war years he quickly became known as an unconventional and modernist composer, but within the decade he began to display a more traditional and romantic side in his music. In the 1920s and 1930s he composed extensively not only for the concert hall, but also for films and ballet.

In the Second World War, Bliss returned to England from the US to work for the BBC and became its director of music. After the war he resumed his work as a composer, and was appointed Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music.

In Bliss&#x27;s later years, his work was respected but was thought old-fashioned, and it was eclipsed by the music of younger colleagues such as William Walton and Benjamin Britten. Since his death, his compositions have been well represented in recordings, and many of his better-known works remain in the repertoire of British orchestras.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Bliss was born in Barnes, a London suburb now, but then in Surrey, the eldest of three sons of Francis Edward Bliss (1847–1930), a businessman from Massachusetts, and his second wife, Agnes Kennard &quot;née&quot; Davis (1858–1895). 

Agnes Bliss died in 1895, and the boys were brought up by their father, who instilled in them a love for the arts. Bliss was educated at Bilton Grange preparatory school, Rugby and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied classics, but also took lessons in music from Charles Wood. Other influences on him during his Cambridge days were Edward Elgar, whose music made a lasting impression on him, and E.J. Dent.

Bliss graduated in classics and music in 1913 and then studied at the Royal College of Music in London for a year. At the RCM he found his composition tutor, Sir Charles Stanford, of little help to him, but found inspiration from Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Holst and his fellow-students, Herbert Howells, Eugene Goossens and Arthur Benjamin. 

In his brief time at the college, he got to know the music of the Second Viennese School and the repertory of Diaghilev&#x27;s &quot;Ballets Russes&quot;, with music by modern composers such as Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky.

When the First World War broke out, Bliss joined the army, and fought in France as an officer in the Royal Fusiliers until 1917 and then in the Grenadier Guards for the rest of the war. His bravery earned him a mention in despatches, and he was twice wounded and once gassed. 

His younger brother, Kennard, was killed in the war, and his death affected Bliss deeply. The music scholar Byron Adams writes, &quot;Despite the apparent heartiness and equilibrium of the composer&#x27;s public persona, the emotional wounds inflicted by the war were deep and lasting.&quot; In 1918, Bliss converted to Roman Catholicism.

===Early compositions===

Although he had begun composing while still a schoolboy, Bliss later suppressed all his juvenilia, and, with the single exception of his 1916 &quot;Pastoral&quot; for clarinet and piano, reckoned the 1918 work &quot;Madam Noy&quot; as his first official composition. With the return of peace, his career took off rapidly as a composer of what were, for British audiences, startlingly new pieces, often for unusual ensembles, strongly influenced by Ravel, Stravinsky and the young French composers of Les Six. Among these are a concerto for wordless tenor voice, piano and strings (1920), and &quot;Rout&quot; for wordless soprano and chamber ensemble (subsequently revised for orchestra), which received a double encore at its first performance.

In 1919, he arranged incidental music from Elizabethan sources for &quot;As You Like It&quot; at Stratford-on-Avon, and conducted a series of Sunday concerts at Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, where he also conducted Pergolesi&#x27;s opera &quot;La serva padrona.&quot; Viola Tree&#x27;s production of &quot;The Tempest&quot; at the Aldwych Theatre in 1921, interspersed incidental music by Thomas Arne and Arthur Sullivan, with new music by Bliss for an ensemble of male voices, piano, trumpet, trombone, gongs and five percussionists dispersed through the theatre.

&quot;The Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Bliss was acquiring a reputation as a tearaway&quot; by the time he was commissioned, through Elgar&#x27;s influence, to write a large-scale symphonic work (&quot;A Colour Symphony&quot;) for the Three Choirs Festival of 1922. The work was well received; in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Samuel Langford called Bliss &quot;far and away the cleverest writer among the English composers of our time&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; praised it highly (though doubting whether much was gained by the designation of the four movements as purple, red, blue and green) and commented that the symphony confirmed Bliss&#x27;s transition from youthful experimenter to serious composer. After the third performance of the work, at the Queen&#x27;s Hall under Sir Henry Wood, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Continually changing patterns scintillate … till one is hypnotised by the ingenuity of the thing.&quot; Elgar, who attended the first performance, complained that the work was &quot;disconcertingly modern.&quot;

In 1923 Bliss&#x27;s father, who had remarried, decided to retire in the US. He and his wife settled in California. Bliss went with them and remained there for two years, working as a conductor, lecturer, pianist and occasional critic. While there he met Gertrude &quot;Trudy&quot; Hoffmann (1904–2008), youngest daughter of Ralph and Gertrude Hoffmann. They were married in 1925. The marriage was happy and lasted for the rest of Bliss&#x27;s life; there were two daughters. Soon after the marriage, Bliss and his wife moved to England.
From the mid-1920s onwards Bliss moved more into the established English musical tradition, leaving behind the influence of Stravinsky and the French modernists, and in the words of the critic Frank Howes, &quot;after early enthusiastic flirtations with aggressive modernism admitted to a romantic heart and [has] given rein to its less and less inhibited promptings&quot; He wrote two major works with American orchestras in mind, the&quot; Introduction and Allegro&quot; (1926), dedicated to the Philadelphia Orchestra and Leopold Stokowski, and &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; (1926) for the Boston Symphony and Pierre Monteux.

Bliss began the 1930s with &quot;Pastoral&quot; (1930). In the same year he wrote &quot;Morning Heroes&quot;, a work for narrator, chorus and orchestra, written in the hope of exorcising the spectre of the First World War: &quot;Although the war had been over for more than ten years, I was still troubled by frequent nightmares; they all took the same form. I was still there in the trenches with a few men; we knew the armistice had been signed, but we had been forgotten; so had a section of the Germans opposite. It was as though we were both doomed to fight on till extinction. I used to wake with horror.&quot;

During the decade Bliss wrote chamber works for leading soloists including a Clarinet Quintet for Frederick Thurston (1932) and a Viola Sonata for Lionel Tertis (1933). In 1935, in the words of the &quot;Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, &quot;he firmly established his position as Elgar&#x27;s natural successor with the Romantic, expansive and richly scored Music for Strings.&quot; Two dramatic works from this decade remain well known, the music for Alexander Korda&#x27;s 1936 film of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;Things to Come&quot;, and a ballet score to his own scenario based on a chess game. Choreographed by Ninette de Valois, &quot;Checkmate&quot; was still in the repertoire of the Royal Ballet in 2011.

By the late 1930s, Bliss was no longer viewed as a modernist; the works of his juniors William Walton and the youthful Benjamin Britten were increasingly prominent, and Bliss&#x27;s music began to seem old-fashioned. His last large-scale work of the 1930s was his Piano Concerto, composed for the pianist Solomon, who gave the world premiere at the World&#x27;s Fair in New York in June 1939. Bliss and his family attended the performance and then stayed on in the US for a holiday. While they were there, the Second World War broke out. Bliss initially stayed in America, teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. He felt impelled to return to England to do what he could for the war effort, and in 1941, leaving his wife and children in California, he made the hazardous Atlantic crossing.

===1940s===
At first, Bliss found little useful work to do in England. He joined the BBC&#x27;s overseas music service in May 1941, but was plainly under-employed. He suggested to Sir Adrian Boult, who was at that time both the chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the BBC&#x27;s director of music, that Boult should step down in his favour from the latter post. Bliss wrote to his wife: &quot;I want more power as I have a lot to give which my comparatively minor post does not allow me to use fully.&quot; Boult agreed to the proposal, which freed him to concentrate on conducting. Bliss served as director of music at the BBC from 1942 to 1944, laying the foundations for the launch of the Third Programme after the war. During the war, he also served on the music committee of the British Council together with Vaughan Williams and William Walton.

In 1944, when Bliss&#x27;s family returned from the US, he resigned from the BBC and returned to composing, having written nothing since his String Quartet in 1941. He composed more film music, and two ballets, &quot;Miracle in the Gorbals&quot; (1944), and &quot;Adam Zero&quot; (1946).

In 1948, Bliss turned his attention to opera, with &quot;The Olympians&quot;. He and the novelist and playwright J. B. Priestley had been friends for many years, and they agreed to collaborate on an opera, despite their lack of any operatic experience. Priestley&#x27;s libretto was based on a legend that &quot;the pagan deities, robbed of their divinity, became a troupe of itinerant players, wandering down the centuries&quot;. The opera portrays the confusion that results when the actors unexpectedly find themselves restored to deity. The opera opened the 1949–50 Covent Garden season. It was directed by Peter Brook, with choreography by Frederick Ashton. The doyen of English music critics, Ernest Newman, praised it highly: &quot;here is a composer with real talent for opera ... in Mr. Priestley he has been fortunate enough to find an English Boito&quot;, but generally it received a polite rather than a rapturous reception. Priestley attributed this to the failure of the conductor, Karl Rankl, to learn the music or to cooperate with Brook, and to lack of rehearsal of the last act. The critics attributed it to Priestley&#x27;s inexperience as an opera librettist, and to the occasional lack of &quot;the soaring tune for the human voice&quot; in Bliss&#x27;s music. After the Covent Garden run of ten performances, the company presented the work in Manchester, but did not revive it in subsequent years; it received a concert performance and broadcast in 1972.

===Later years===
In 1950, Bliss was knighted. After the death of Sir Arnold Bax he was appointed Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music in 1953, to the relief of Walton, who feared he would be asked to take the post. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Howes commented, &quot;The duties of a Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music are what he chooses to make of them, but they include the composition of ceremonial and occasional music&quot;. Bliss, who composed quickly and with facility, was able to discharge the many duties of the post, providing music as required for state occasions, from the birth of a child to the Queen, to the funeral of Winston Churchill, to the investiture of the Prince of Wales. Howes commended Bliss&#x27;s &quot;Processional&quot; for the 1953 coronation, and &quot;A Song of Welcome&quot;, Bliss&#x27;s first official &quot;pièce d&#x27;occasion&quot;.

In 1956, Bliss headed the first delegation by British musicians to the Soviet Union since the end of the Second World War. The party included the violinist Alfredo Campoli, the oboist Léon Goossens, the soprano Jennifer Vyvyan, the conductor Clarence Raybould and the pianist Gerald Moore. Bliss returned to Moscow in 1958, as a member of the jury of the International Tchaikovsky Competition, with fellow jurors including Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter.

In addition to his official functions, Bliss continued to compose steadily throughout the 1950s. His works from that decade include his Second String Quartet (1950); a scena, &quot;The Enchantress&quot; (1951), for the contralto Kathleen Ferrier; a Piano Sonata (1952); and a Violin Concerto (1955), for Campoli. The orchestral &quot;Meditations on a Theme by John Blow&quot; (1955) was a particularly deep-felt work, and Bliss regarded it highly among his output. In 1959–60 he collaborated with the librettist Christopher Hassall on an opera for television, based on the scriptural story of Tobias and the Angel . It won praise for the way in which Bliss and Hassall had understood and adapted to the more intimate medium of television, though some critics thought Bliss&#x27;s music competent but unremarkable.

In 1961, Bliss and Hassall collaborated on a cantata, &quot;The Beatitudes&quot;, commissioned for the opening of the new Coventry Cathedral. Reviews were friendly, but the work has rarely been performed since, and has been eclipsed by another choral work written for Coventry at the same time, Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot;. Bliss followed this with two further large-scale choral works, &quot;Mary of Magdala&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Golden Cantata&quot; (1963).

Throughout his life, Bliss was vigilant on the state of music in Britain, about which he had written extensively since the 1920s. In 1969 he publicly censured the BBC for its plan to cut its classical music budget and disband several of its orchestras. He was delegated by his colleagues Walton, Britten, Peter Maxwell Davies and Richard Rodney Bennett to make a strong protest to William Glock, the BBC&#x27;s controller of music. 

Bliss continued to compose into his eighth and ninth decades, in which his works included the Cello Concerto (1970) for Mstislav Rostropovich, the &quot;Metamorphic Variations&quot; for orchestra (1972), and a final cantata, &quot;Shield of Faith&quot; (1974), for soprano, baritone, chorus and organ, celebrating 500 years of St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, setting poems chosen from each of the five centuries of the chapel&#x27;s existence.

Bliss died at his London home in 1975 at the age of 83. His wife Trudy outlived him by 33 years, dying in 2008 at the age of 104.

==Music==
===Early works===
The musicologist Christopher Palmer was censorious of those who sought to characterise Bliss&#x27;s music as &quot;an early tendency to &quot;enfant terribilisme&quot; yielding very quickly to a compromise with the Establishment and a perpetuating of the Elgar tradition&quot;. Nonetheless, as a young man Bliss was certainly regarded as &quot;avant garde&quot;. &quot;Madam Noy&quot;, a &quot;witchery&quot; song, was first performed in June 1920. The lyric is by an anonymous author, and the setting is for soprano with flute, clarinet, bassoon, harp, viola, and bass. In a 1923 study of Bliss, Edwin Evans wrote that the piquant instrumental background to the gruesome story established the direction that Bliss was to take. The second Chamber Rhapsody (1919) is &quot;an idyllic work for soprano, tenor, flute, cor anglais, and bass, the two voices vocalising on &#x27;Ah&#x27; throughout, and being placed as instruments in the ensemble.&quot; Bliss contrasted the pastoral tone of that work with &quot;Rout&quot; (1920) an uproarious piece for soprano and instrumental ensemble; &quot; the music conveys an impression such as one might gather at an open window at carnival time … the singer is given a series of meaningless syllables chosen for their phonetic effect&quot;. In his next work, &quot;Conversations&quot; for violin, viola, cello, flute and oboe (1921), Bliss chose a deliberately prosaic subject. It consists of five sections, entitled &quot;Committee Meeting,&quot; &quot;In the Wood,&quot; &quot;In the Ball-room,&quot; &quot;Soliloquy,&quot; and &quot;In the Tube at Oxford Circus.&quot; Evans wrote of this work that although the instrumentation is ingenious, &quot;much of [the] interest is polyphonic, especially in the first and last numbers.&quot;

Bliss followed these works with three compositions for larger forces, a Concerto (1920) and Two Orchestral Studies (1920). The Concerto, for piano, voice and orchestra, was experimental, and Bliss later revised it, removing the vocal part. The &quot;Melée Fantasque&quot; (1921) showed Bliss&#x27;s skill in writing glittering orchestration.

===Mature works===
Of Bliss&#x27;s early works, &quot;Rout&quot; is occasionally performed, and has been recorded, but the first of his works to enter the repertoire (at least in the UK) is the &quot;Colour Symphony&quot;. Each of the four movements represents a colour: &quot;purple, the colour of amethysts, pageantry, royalty, and death; red, the colour of rubies, wine, revelry, furnaces, courage, and magic; blue, the colour of sapphires, deep water, skies, loyalty, and melancholy; and green, the colour of emeralds, hope, joy, youth, spring, and victory.&quot; The first and third are slow movements, the second a scherzo, and the fourth fugal, described by the Bliss specialist Andrew Burn as &quot;a compositional tour de force, a superbly constructed double fugue, the initial subject slow and angular for strings, gradually becoming an Elgarian ceremonial march, the second a bubbling theme for winds.&quot; Burn observes that in three works written soon after his marriage, the Oboe Quintet (1927), &quot;Pastoral&quot; (1929) and &quot;Serenade&quot; (1929), &quot;Bliss&#x27;s voice assumed the mantle of maturity … all are imbued with a quality of contentment reflecting his serenity.&quot;

Of the works of Bliss&#x27;s maturity, Burn comments that many of them were inspired by external stimuli. Some by the performers for whom they were written, such as the concertos for piano (1938), violin (1955) and cello (1970); some by literary and theatrical partners, such as the film music, ballets, cantatas and &quot;The Olympians&quot;; some by painters, such as the &quot;Serenade&quot; and the &quot;Metamorphic Variations&quot;; some by classical literature, such as &quot;Hymn to Apollo&quot; (1926), &quot;The Enchantress&quot;, and &quot;Pastoral&quot;. Of Bliss&#x27;s works after the Second World War, his opera, &quot;The Olympians&quot; is generally considered a failure. The idiom was judged to be old-fashioned. A contemporary critic, in a broadly favourable review, wrote, &quot;Bliss has wisely cleared his idiom of modern harmonic astringency. He uses quite a lot of common chords and progressions; in fact, he has gone back to the harmony of the musical gods. The result, inevitably, is a certain air of reminiscence.&quot;

Among the late works, the Cello Concerto is one of the more frequently played. When its dedicatee, Rostropovich, gave the first performance at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival, Britten, who conducted the performance, regarded it as a major work and persuaded Bliss to change its title from &quot;Concertino&quot; to &quot;Concerto&quot;. It is an approachable piece of which Bliss said &quot;There are no problems for the listener – only for the soloist&quot;.

Both Palmer and Burn comment on a sinister vein that sometimes breaks out in Bliss&#x27;s music, in passages such as the Interlude &quot;Through the valley of the shadow of Death&quot; in &quot;The Meditations on a Theme of John Blow&quot;, and the orchestral introduction to &quot;The Beatitudes&quot;. In Burn&#x27;s words, such moments can be profoundly disquieting. Palmer comments that the musical forerunner of such passages is probably &quot;the extraordinary spectral march-like irruption&quot; in the Scherzo of Elgar&#x27;s Second Symphony.

In a centenary assessment of Bliss&#x27;s music, Burn singles out for mention &quot;the youthful vigour of &quot;A Colour Symphony&quot;&quot;, &quot;the poignant humanity of &quot;Morning Heroes&quot;&quot;, &quot;the romantic lyricism of the Clarinet Quintet&quot;, &quot;the drama of &quot;Checkmate&quot;, &quot;Miracle in the Gorbals&quot; and &quot;Things to Come&quot;&quot;, and &quot;the spiritual probing of the &quot;Meditations on a Theme of John Blow&quot; and &quot;Shield of Faith&quot;.&quot; Other works of Bliss classed by Palmer as among the finest are the &quot;Introduction and Allegro&quot;, the &quot;Music for Strings&quot;, the Oboe Quintet, &quot;A Knot of Riddles&quot; and &quot;the Golden Cantata.&quot;

==Honours, legacy and reputation==
In addition to his knighthood, Bliss was appointed KCVO (1969) and CH (1971). He received honorary degrees from the universities of Bristol, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Lancaster, and London, as well as from Princeton University. The London Symphony Orchestra appointed him its honorary President in 1958. In 1963, he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society.

Bliss&#x27;s archive is kept at Cambridge University Library. There is an Arthur Bliss Road in Newport, an Arthur Bliss Gardens in Cheltenham and a block of flats, Sir Arthur Bliss Court, in Mitcham, South London.

The Arthur Bliss Society was founded in 2003 to further the knowledge and appreciation of Bliss&#x27;s music. The society&#x27;s website includes listings of forthcoming performances of Bliss&#x27;s works; in March 2011 the following works were listed as scheduled for performance in the UK and U.S.: &quot;Ceremonial Prelude&quot;; Clarinet Quartet (2 performances); Four Songs for Voice, Violin and Piano; &quot;Music for Strings&quot;; &quot;Pastoral (Lie strewn the white flocks)&quot;; &quot;Royal Fanfares&quot;; &quot;Seven American Poems&quot;; String Quartet No. 2 (5 performances); &quot;Things to Come&quot; Suite (2 performances); &quot;Things to Come&quot; March.

Many of Bliss&#x27;s works have been recorded. He was a capable conductor, and was in charge of some of the recordings. The Library of Cambridge University maintains a complete Bliss discography. In March 2011 it contained details of 281 recordings: 120 orchestral, 56 chamber and instrumental, 58 choral and vocal, and 47 stage and screen works. Among the works that have received multiple recordings are &quot;A Colour Symphony&quot; (6 recordings); the Cello Concerto (6); the Piano Concerto (6); &quot;Music for Strings&quot; (7); the Oboe Quintet (7); the Viola Sonata (The violin sonata was first recorded in 2010) (7); and &quot;Checkmate&quot; (complete ballet and ballet suite (9)).

On receiving the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society in 1963, Bliss said, &quot;I don&#x27;t claim to have done more than light a small taper at the shrine of music. I do not upbraid Fate for not having given me greater gifts. Endeavour has been the joy&quot;. A hundred years after Bliss&#x27;s birth, Byron Adams wrote,

<text>Shaving is the removal of hair, by using a razor or any other kind of bladed implement, to slice it down—to the level of the skin or otherwise. Shaving is most commonly practiced by men to remove their facial hair and by women to remove their leg and underarm hair. A man is called &quot;clean-shaven&quot; if he has had his beard entirely removed.

Both men and women sometimes shave their chest hair, abdominal hair, leg hair, underarm hair, pubic hair, or any other body hair. Head shaving is much more common among men. It is often associated with religious practice, the armed forces, and some competitive sports such as swimming, bodybuilding, and extreme sports. Historically, head shaving has also been used to humiliate, punish, for purification or to show submission to an authority. In more recent history, head shaving has been used in fund-raising efforts, particularly for cancer research organizations and charitable organizations which serve cancer patients. The shaving of head hair is also sometimes done by cancer patients when their treatment may result in hair loss, and by people experiencing male pattern baldness.

== History ==

Before the advent of razors, hair was sometimes removed using two shells to pull the hair out or using water and a sharp tool. Around 3000 BC when copper tools were developed, copper razors were invented. The idea of an aesthetic approach to personal hygiene may have begun at this time, though Egyptian priests may have practiced something similar to this earlier. Alexander the Great strongly promoted shaving the beard for Macedonian soldiers before battle because he feared the enemy would grab them. In some Native American tribes, at the time of contact with British colonists, it was customary for men and women to remove all body hair.

Straight razors have been manufactured in Sheffield, England since the 18th century. In the United States, getting a straight razor shave in a barbershop and self-shaving with a straight razor were still common in the early 1900s. The popularisation of self-shaving changed this. According to an estimate by New York City barber Charles de Zemler, barbers&#x27; shaving revenue dropped from about 50 percent around the time of the Spanish–American War to 10 percent in 1939 due to the invention of the safety razor and electric razor.

Safety razors have existed since at least 1876 when the single-edge Star safety razor was patented by brothers Frederick and Otto Kampfe. The razor was essentially a small piece of a straight razor attached to a handle using a clamp mechanism. Before each shave the blade had to be attached to a special holder, stropped with a leather belt, and placed back into the razor. After a time, the blade needed to be honed by a cutler.

In 1895, King Camp Gillette invented the double-edged safety razor, with cheap disposable blades sharpened from two sides. It took him until 1901 to build a working, patentable model, and commercial production began in 1903. The razor gained popularity during World War I when the U.S. military started issuing Gillette shaving kits to its servicemen: in 1918, the Gillette Safety Razor Company sold 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades. After the First World War, the company changed the pricing of its razor from a premium $5 to a more affordable $1 (equivalent to $ and $ in , respectively), leading to another big surge in popularity. The Second World War led to a similar increase in users when Gillette was ordered to dedicate its entire razor production and most blade production to the U.S. military. During the war, 12.5 million razors and 1.5 billion blades were provided to servicemen.

In 1970, Wilkinson Sword introduced the &#x27;bonded blade&#x27; razor, which consisted of a single blade housed in a plastic cartridge. Gillette followed in 1971 with its Trac II cartridge razor that utilised two blades. Gillette built on this twin blade design for a time, introducing new razors with added features such as a pivoting head, lubricating strip, and spring-mounted blades until their 1998 launch of the triple-bladed Mach3 razor. Schick launched a four-blade Quattro razor later the same year, and in 2006 Gillette launched the five-blade Fusion. Since then, razors with six and seven blades have been introduced.

Wholly disposable razors gained popularity in the 1970s after Bic brought the first disposable razor to market in 1974. Other manufacturers, Gillette included, soon introduced their own disposable razors, and by 1980 disposables made up more than 27 percent of worldwide unit sales for razors.

== Shaving methods ==
Shaving can be done with a straight razor or safety razor (called &#x27;manual shaving&#x27; or &#x27;wet shaving&#x27;) or an electric razor (called &#x27;dry shaving&#x27;) or beard trimmer.

The removal of a full beard often requires the use of scissors or an electric (or beard) trimmer to reduce the mass of hair, simplifying the process.

=== Wet shaving ===
There are two types of manual razors: straight razor and safety razors. Safety razors are further subdivided into double-edged razors, single edge, injector razors, cartridge razors and disposable razors.
Double-edge razors are named so because the blade that they use has two sharp edges on opposite sides of the blade. Current multi-bladed cartridge manufacturers attempt to differentiate themselves by having more or fewer blades than their competitors, each arguing that their product gives a greater shave quality at a more affordable price.
Before wet shaving, the area to be shaved is usually doused in warm to hot water by showering or bathing or covered for several minutes with a hot wet towel to soften the skin and hair. Dry hair is difficult to cut, and the required cutting force is reduced significantly once the hair is hydrated. Fully hydrated hair requires about 65% less force to cut, and hair is almost fully hydrated after two minutes of contact with room temperature water. The time required for hydration is reduced when using higher temperature water.

A lathering or lubricating agent such as cream, shaving soap, gel, foam or oil is normally applied after this. Lubricating and moisturizing the skin to be shaved helps prevent irritation and damage known as razor burn. Many razor cartridges include a lubricating strip, made of polyethylene glycol, to function instead of or in supplement to extrinsic agents. It also lifts and softens the hairs, causing them to swell. This enhances the cutting action and sometimes permits cutting the hairs slightly below the surface of the skin. Additionally, during shaving, the lather indicates areas that have not been addressed. When soap is used, it is generally applied with a shaving brush, which has long, soft bristles. It is worked up into a usable lather by the brush, either against the face, in a shaving mug, bowl, scuttle, or palm of the hand.
Since cuts are more likely when using safety razors and straight razors, wet shaving is generally done in more than one pass with the blade. The goal is to reduce the amount of hair with each pass, instead of trying to eliminate all of it in a single pass. This also reduces the risks of cuts, soreness, and ingrown hairs. Alum blocks and styptic pencils are used to close cuts resulting from the shave.

==== Aftershave ====
An aftershave lotion or balm is sometimes used after finishing shaving. It may contain an antiseptic agent such as isopropyl alcohol, both to prevent infection from cuts and to act as an astringent to reduce skin irritation, a perfume, and a moisturizer to soften the facial skin.

=== Electric shaving ===
The electric shaver (electric razor) consists of a set of oscillating or rotating blades, which are held behind a perforated metal screen which prevents them from coming into contact with the skin and behaves much like the second blade in a pair of scissors. When the razor is held against the skin, the whiskers poke through the holes in the screen and are sliced by the moving blades. In some designs the blades are a rotating cylinder. In others they are one or more rotating disks or a set of oscillating blades. Each design has an optimum motion over the skin for the best shave and manufacturers provide guidance on this. Generally, circular or cylindrical blades (rotary-type shaver) move in a circular motion and oscillating blades (foil-type shaver) move left and right. Hitachi has produced foil-type shavers with a rotary blade that operates similarly to the blade assembly of a reel-type lawn mower. The first electric razor was built by Jacob Schick in 1928.

The main disadvantages of electric shaving are that it may not cut the whiskers as closely as razor shaving does and it requires a source of electricity, usually a rechargeable battery. The advantages include fewer cuts to the skin, quicker shaving, and no need for water and lather sources (a wet shave). The initial cost of electric shaving is higher, due to the cost of the shaver itself, but the long-term cost can be significantly lower, since the cutting parts do not need replacement for several months and a lathering product is not required. Some people also find they do not experience ingrown hairs (pseudofolliculitis barbae, also called razor bumps), when using an electric shaver.

In contrast to wet shaving, electric shave lotions are intended to stiffen the whiskers. Stiffening is achieved by dehydrating the follicles using solutions of alcohols and a degreaser such as isopropyl myristate. Lotions are also sold to reduce skin irritation, but electric shaving does not usually require the application of any lubrication. This is called Dry Shaving.

Mechanical shavers powered by a spring motor have been manufactured, although in the late 20th century they became rare. Such shavers can operate for up to two minutes each time the spring is wound and do not require an electrical outlet or batteries. Such type of shaver, the &quot;Monaco&quot; brand, was used on American space flights in the 1960s and 1970s, during the Apollo missions.

=== Trimmer ===

A trimmer has two adjacent blades, each with teeth on its cutting edge. One blade oscillates alongside a stationary blade so that the teeth cut any hair that falls between them. The main advantage of a trimmer, unlike shaving tools, is that longer beards can be trimmed to a short length efficiently and effectively, including as preparation for shaving.

== Effects of shaving ==
=== Aberrations ===
Shaving can have numerous side effects, including cuts, abrasions, and irritation. Many side effects can be minimized by using a fresh blade, applying plenty of lubrication, shaving in the direction of hair growth, and avoiding pressing the razor into the skin. A shaving brush can also help to lift the hair and spread the lubrication. The cosmetic market in some consumer economies offers many products to reduce these effects; they commonly dry the affected area, and some also help to lift out the trapped hair(s). Some people who shave choose to use only single-blade or wire-wrapped blades that shave farther away from the skin. Others have skin that cannot tolerate razor shaving at all; they use depilatory shaving powders to dissolve hair above the skin&#x27;s surface, or grow a beard. Some anatomical parts, such as the scrotum, require extra care and more advanced equipment due to the uneven surface of the skin when the testicles shrivel during coldness, or its imbalance when the testicles hang low due to being warmer.

=== Cuts ===
Cuts from shaving can bleed for about fifteen minutes. Shaving cuts can be caused by blade movement perpendicular to the blade&#x27;s cutting axis or by regular / orthogonal shaving over prominent bumps on the skin (which the blade incises). As such, the presence of acne can make shaving cuts more likely, and extra care must be exercised. The use of a fresh, sharp blade as well as proper cleaning and lubrication of skin can help prevent cuts. Some razor blade manufacturers include disposal containers or receptacles to avoid injuries to anyone handling the garbage.

=== Razor burn ===

Razor burn is an irritation of the skin caused by using a blunt blade or not using proper technique. It appears as a mild rash 2–4 minutes after shaving (once hair starts to grow through sealed skin) and usually disappears after a few hours to a few days, depending on severity. In severe cases, razor burn can also be accompanied by razor bumps, where the area around shaved hairs get raised red welts or infected pustules.
A rash at the time of shaving is usually a sign of lack of lubrication. Razor burn is a common problem, especially among those who shave coarse hairs on areas with sensitive skin like the bikini line, pubic hair, underarms, chest, and beard. The condition can be caused by shaving too closely, shaving with a blunt blade, dry shaving, applying too much pressure when shaving, shaving too quickly or roughly, or shaving against the grain.

Ways to prevent razor burn include keeping the skin moist, using a shaving brush and lather, using a moisturizing shaving gel, shaving in the direction of the hair growth, resisting the urge to shave too closely, applying minimal pressure, avoiding scratching or irritation after shaving, avoiding irritating products on the shaved area (colognes, perfumes, etc.) and using an aftershave cream with aloe vera or other emollients. Putting a warm, wet cloth on one&#x27;s skin helps as well, by softening hairs. This can also be done by using pre-shave oil before the application of shaving cream. Essential oils such as coconut oil, tea-tree oil, peppermint oil, and lavender oil help to soothe skin after shaving. They have anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and antibacterial properties.

In some cases multi-bladed razors can cause skin irritation by shaving too close to the skin. Switching to a single- or double-bladed razor and not stretching the skin while shaving can mitigate this.

One other technique involves exfoliating the skin before and after shaving, using various exfoliating products, included but not limited to, brushes, mitts, and loofah. This process removes dead skin cells, reducing the potential for ingrown hairs and allowing the razor to glide across the skin smoothly decreasing the risk of the razor snagging or grabbing causing razor burn.

=== Razor bumps ===

 is a medical term for persistent inflammation caused by shaving. It is also known by the initials PFB or colloquial terms such as razor bumps.

=== Myths ===
Shaving does not cause terminal hair to grow back thicker, coarser or darker. This belief arose because hair that has never been cut has a naturally tapered end as it emerges from the skin&#x27;s hair follicle, whereas, after cutting, there is no taper. The cut hair may thus appear to be thicker, and feel coarser as a result of the sharp edges on each cut strand. The fact that shorter hairs are &quot;harder&quot; (less flexible) than longer hairs also contributes to this effect. Hair can also appear darker after it grows back because hair that has never been cut is often lighter from sun exposure. In addition, as humans grow older, hair tends to grow coarser and in more places on the face and body. For example, teenagers may start shaving their face or legs at around 16, but as they age, hair will start to grow more abundantly and thicker, leading some to believe this was due to the shaving, but in reality is just part of the maturation process.

== Shaving in religion ==

=== Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Christianity ===

Hindu, Jain and Buddhist (usually only monks or nuns) temples have ceremonies of shaving the hair from the scalp of priests, nuns, and certain followers, as a symbol of their renunciation of worldly fashion and esteem. Amish men and some other plain peoples shave their beard until they are married, after which they allow it to grow but continue to shave their mustaches. Tonsure is the practice of some Christian churches.

In Hinduism, in certain communities, a child&#x27;s birth hair is shaved off as part of a set of religious rites (samskaras).

=== Islam ===
==== Sunni ====
Leading classical Islāmic jurist and theologian Abdullāh b. Abī Zayd says in his &#x27;Risalah&#x27;, &quot;and the Prophet ordered that the beard be left alone and allowed to grow abundantly and that it not be trimmed. Malik said: “And there is no objection in trimming from its length when it becomes very long.” And what Malik said, more than one of the Companions and the Successors also said.”&quot;

Muslim jurists have unanimously agreed that shaving the entire head, and, to a lesser degree, cutting it during pilgrimage is preferable. It is proven that Muhammad shaved his entire head, and he prayed for those who shaved their heads or cut their hair. 

Islām also teaches followers to shave/pluck body hair such as pubic and armpit hair on a regular basis (40 days). Shī&#x27;a and Sunnī narrations from the Prophet state that: &quot;God&#x27;s Prophet (May God bless him) said: &#x27;Anyone who believes in God and the Hereafter should not postpone shaving the pubic hair for more than forty days.&#x27;&quot;

==== Shia ====
According to the Shia scholars, the length of beard should not exceed the width of a fist. Trimming of facial hair is allowed, however, shaving it is Haram (forbidden).

=== Judaism ===
Observant Jewish men are subject to restrictions on the shaving of their beards, as Leviticus 19:27 forbids the shaving of the &quot;corners of the head&quot; and prohibits the &quot;marring&quot; of the &quot;corners of the beard&quot;. The Hebrew word used in this verse refers specifically to shaving with a blade against the skin; rabbis at different times and places have interpreted it in many ways.

Tools like scissors and electric razors, which cut the hair between two blades instead of between blade and skin, are permitted.

===Sikhism===
Observant Sikhs also follow the practice of keeping their hair uncut.

<doc id="155160" wikidata="Q297275" url="?curid=155160" title="Hans Blix">
<text>Hans Martin Blix (; born 28 June 1928) is a Swedish diplomat and politician for the Liberal People&#x27;s Party. He was Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs (1978–1979) and later became the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency. As such, Blix was the first Western representative to inspect the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union on-site and led the agency&#x27;s response to them. Blix was also the head of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission from March 2000 to June 2003, when he was succeeded by Dimitris Perrikos. In 2002, the commission began searching Iraq for weapons of mass destruction, ultimately finding none. On 17 March 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush delivered an address from the White House announcing that within 48 hours, the United States would invade Iraq unless Saddam Hussein would leave. Bush then ordered all of the weapons inspectors, including Blix&#x27;s team, to leave Iraq so that America and its allies could invade Iraq on 20 March. In February 2010, Blix became head of the United Arab Emirates&#x27; advisory board for its nuclear power program. He is the former president of the World Federation of United Nations Associations.

==Life and career==
Blix was born in Uppsala, Sweden. He is the son of professor Gunnar Blix and Hertha Wiberg, and grandson of professor Magnus Blix. He comes from a family of Jamtlandic origin. Blix studied at Uppsala University and Columbia University, earning his PhD from the University of Cambridge (Trinity Hall). In 1959, he earned a Juris Doctor in international law at Stockholm University, where he was appointed associate professor in international law the next year. Hans Blix has two sons, Mårten and Göran, who both have doctoral degrees.

Between 1962 and 1978 Blix was a member of the Swedish delegation at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. He held several other positions in the Swedish administration between 1963 and 1976, and from 1961 to 1981, he served on the Swedish delegation to the United Nations. From 1978 to 1979, Blix was the Swedish Foreign Minister.

Blix chaired the Swedish Liberal Party&#x27;s campaign during the 1980 referendum on nuclear power, campaigning in favour of the retention of the Swedish nuclear energy program.

==Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (1981–1997)==

Blix became Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency between 1981 and 1997 after Sigvard Eklund.

Blix personally made repeated inspection visits to the Iraqi nuclear reactor &quot;Osiraq&quot; before its attempted destruction by the Iranians, in 1980, and its eventual destruction by the Israeli Air Force in 1981 during Operation Opera. Although most agreed that Iraq was years away from being able to build a nuclear weapon, the Iranians and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent nuclear fallout. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and was widely condemned. Iraq was alternately praised and admonished by the IAEA for its cooperation and lack thereof. It was only after the first Gulf War that the full extent of Iraq&#x27;s nuclear programs, which had switched from a plutonium-based weapon design to a highly enriched uranium design after the destruction of Osiraq, became known.

Another significant event during his time as head of the IAEA was the Chernobyl disaster on 26 April 1986, a nuclear accident rated at the highest level 7 on the IAEA&#x27;s International Nuclear Event Scale.

==Iraq disarmament crisis (2002–2003)==
During the Iraq disarmament crisis before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Blix was called back from retirement by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to lead the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission in charge of monitoring Iraq. Kofi Annan originally recommended Rolf Ekéus, who worked with UNSCOM in the past, but Russia and France vetoed his appointment. 

Blix personally admonished Saddam for &quot;cat and mouse&quot; games and warned Iraq of &quot;serious consequences&quot; if it attempted to hinder or delay his mission.

In his report to the UN Security Council on 14 February 2003, Blix claimed that &quot;so far, UNMOVIC has not found any such weapons [of mass destruction], only a small number of empty chemical munitions.&quot;

In 2004 Blix stated that &quot;there were about 700 inspections, and in no case did we find weapons of mass destruction.&quot;

Blix&#x27;s statements about the Iraq WMD program contradicted the claims of the George W. Bush administration and attracted a great deal of criticism from supporters of the invasion of Iraq. In an interview on BBC 1 on 8 February 2004, Blix accused the US and British governments of dramatizing the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq to strengthen the case for the 2003 war against the government of Saddam Hussein. Ultimately, Blix was largely vindicated; the invasion failed to turn up any active WMD programs.

In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, Blix said, &quot;I have my detractors in Washington. There are bastards who spread things around, of course, who planted nasty things in the media.&quot;

In 2004, Blix published a book, &quot;Disarming Iraq&quot;, where he gives his account of the events and inspections before the coalition began its invasion.

===CIA investigation===
Senior American officials ordered the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to investigate Blix to gather &quot;sufficient ammunition to undermine&quot; him so that the US could start the invasion of Iraq. The American officials were upset that the CIA did not uncover such information.

Blix said he suspected his home and office were bugged by the United States while he led teams searching for Saddam Hussein&#x27;s supposed weapons of mass destruction. Although these suspicions were never directly substantiated, evidence of a request for bugging of UN Security Council representatives around the time the US was seeking approval from the council came to light after a British government translator leaked a document &quot;allegedly from an American National Security Agency&quot; requesting that British intelligence put wiretaps on delegates to the UN Security Council.

==Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission==
Since 2003 Blix has been chairman of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission (WMDC), an independent body funded by the Swedish government and based in Stockholm.

In December 2006, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission said in a report that Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan could not have acted alone when passing on nuclear data and designs &quot;without the awareness of the Pakistan government.&quot;

==President of WFUNA==
In 2006 Hans Blix was elected president of the World Federation of United Nations Associations at its 38th Plenary Assembly.

==Humanitarian initiatives==
In 2009 Blix joined the project &quot;Soldiers of Peace&quot;, an anti-war film.

==Head of Advisory Board for United Arab Emirates Nuclear Program ==
Blix chairs a panel of advisors who oversee the establishment of the UAE&#x27;s Dh150 billion atomic energy programme. He leads the nine-person board, which meets twice a year. The International Advisory Board (IAB) oversees the progress of the nation&#x27;s nuclear energy plan and issues reports on potential improvements to the scheme.

<text>Beveren () is a municipality in the Belgian province of East Flanders which comprises the towns of Beveren, Doel, Haasdonk, Kallo, Kieldrecht, Melsele, Verrebroek and Vrasene.

The port of the Waasland (Dutch: &quot;Waaslandhaven&quot;) is in Beveren, on the left bank of the Schelde, facing the port of Antwerp on the other side of the river.

==History==

===Roman origins===
In Roman times, the Beveren area was at the edge of the sea and heavily influenced by the tides. The earliest inhabitants erected primitive dams, which were later reinforced and built higher by the religious communities that sprang up in the region. The invasions of the Normans in the 9th century prompted the Counts of Flanders and their local vassals to defend this land even more. Among the local nobility were the lords of Beveren, whose territory was eventually ceded to Louis I of Flanders in 1334. Beveren thus became the oldest political centre of the Waasland region — the northeastern part of the historical County of Flanders — basking for more than two centuries in the glory of Flanders and Burgundy.

===1570 to the present===

In 1570, a catastrophic tide flooded the area. For strategic reasons linked to the protection of Antwerp, the local authorities decided to dismantle the remaining dams. Five years later, the rights to the territory were sold. The area closest to the Scheldt was bought by an Antwerp merchant, and the rest went to the Duke of Aarschot. This state of affairs lasted until the French Revolution, when the territory was subdivided into the pre-merger communes. From the 17th century on, the territory had slowly been taken back from the sea, until 1846, when the last parcel of land was dammed up.

Beveren was heavily impacted by the North Sea flood of 1953, which breached the dykes, causing again heavy damage to hundreds of houses. In the 1960s and 1970s, the expansion of the port of Antwerp took place on Kallo&#x27;s territory. The village of Doel was reduced from the 900 residents of only 10 years ago to some 250 currently because of the expansion of the port. Vast industrial settlements came in its wake, including a nuclear power plant in Doel, which allows Beveren to provide low municipal tax rates for its inhabitants. The opening of the &quot;Liefkenshoek&quot; car tunnel under the Scheldt in 1991 further improved access to the left bank. Despite all those developments, Beveren has managed to keep its green areas intact and still offers picturesque landscapes to visitors.

==Sights==

*Two castles remain from the feudal era: the 15th-century Castle of Cortewalle, and the Castle Hof Ter Saksen (18th century), which evolved from a medieval inn on the road between Ghent and Antwerp. During the second part of the 20th century, the castle was abandoned and reduced to ruins within a park.
*The Haasdonk fort was built just before World War I for Antwerp&#x27;s protection. Bunkers can still be seen nearby.
*Beveren has kept several centuries-old houses, manors, chapels and churches.
*The village of Doel houses a 17th-century windmill, one of the oldest in Flanders.
*The polders north of Beveren offer a unique landscape, reminiscent of the southern Netherlands.
*The Freethiel

==Folklore==
Like many other cities in Belgium, Beveren has a collection of giant puppets who take part in most of the local festivities. The two oldest ones were baptized in 1954.

At Katoen Natie in Kallo one can watch and listen to the Organ collection Ghysels, which was allocated to Museum Vleeshuis in Antwerp. The collection is open for the public since 2010 and waits on at transfer until Vleeshuis has been renovated.

==Climate==
Beveren has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with narrow seasonal differences for its latitude. Summers are warm, but occasionally hot, whereas winters usually remain above freezing.

<doc id="155165" wikidata="Q916980" url="?curid=155165" title="Kruibeke">
<text>Kruibeke () is a municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the towns of Bazel, Kruibeke proper and Rupelmonde. On 1 January 2018, Kruibeke had a total population of 16,657. The total area is 33.42 km2.

The oldest secular centre of the area is the feudal castle of Wissekerke at Bazel, which was inhabited by the ancient family Vilain until 1989.

In March 2003, the mayor at that time Antoine Denert set up the Department of Tenderness to encourage residents to be nicer to each other. Denert worried that &quot;people don&#x27;t cuddle anymore and that&#x27;s the reason why there are so many conflicts.&quot; and announced: &quot;I will set an example and start in my own village by caressing, cuddling and kissing as many people as possible.&quot; He officially added Tenderness to his alderman portfolio of duties, until then Work, Environment and Budget. As of 26 August 2004, no other civic governments have adopted this idea.

Jos Stassen was mayor from 2013 to 2018, where he led a majority composed of SamenVoorKruibeke (Vooruit, Groen and Open VLD) and CD&amp;V. Their combined efforts gave them a majority over the largest party, N-VA, led by former mayor Antoine Denert.

From 2018 to 2022 Dimitri van Laere took over the mantle of mayor by creating a majority composed of N-VA, CD&amp;V and a couple of independents who were previously part of former mayor Antoine Denert&#x27;s party D.E.N.E.R.T.. In 2022, this coalition brought Antoine Denert back on board to act as mayor as they started preparing a fusion with neighboring municipalities Beveren and Zwijndrecht, slated for completion by the end of 2024, start of 2025.

<text>Mstislav Leopoldovich Rostropovich (27 March 192727 April 2007) was a Russian cellist and conductor. In addition to his interpretations and technique, he was well known for both inspiring and commissioning new works, which enlarged the cello repertoire more than any cellist before or since. He inspired and premiered over 100 pieces, forming long-standing friendships and artistic partnerships with composers including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Henri Dutilleux, Witold Lutosławski, Olivier Messiaen, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Alfred Schnittke, Norbert Moret, Andreas Makris, Leonard Bernstein, Aram Khachaturian, and Benjamin Britten.

Rostropovich was internationally recognized as a staunch advocate of human rights, and was awarded the 1974 Award of the International League of Human Rights. He was married to the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya and had two daughters, Olga and Elena Rostropovich. He received numerous accolades, including a Polar Music Prize.

==Early years==

Mstislav Rostropovich was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, to parents who had moved from Orenburg in Russia: , a renowned cellist and former student of Pablo Casals, and Sofiya Nikolaevna Fedotova-Rostropovich, a talented pianist. Leopold (1892–1942) was born in Voronezh to , a composer of Polish noble descent with distant Belarusian roots, and Matilda Rostropovich (née Pule) of German and Huguenot descent. The Polish part of his family bore the Bogoria coat of arms, which was located at the family palace in Skotniki.
Mstislav&#x27;s mother Sofiya Fedotova, of Russian descent, was the daughter of musicians and herself a conservatory-trained pianist. Her elder sister, Nadezhda, married cellist Semyon Kozolupov, who was thus Rostropovich&#x27;s uncle by marriage.

Rostropovich grew up in Baku and spent his youth there. During World War II his family moved back to Orenburg and then in 1943 to Moscow.

At age four, Rostropovich began studying piano with his mother. He began learning the cello at age eight from his father. In 1943, at age 16, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, where he studied cello with his uncle Semyon Kozolupov, piano with Nikolai Kuvshinnikov, and composition with Vissarion Shebalin. His teachers also included Dmitri Shostakovich. In 1945, he came to prominence as a cellist when he won the gold medal in the Soviet Union&#x27;s first ever competition for young musicians. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1948 and became professor of cello there in 1956.

==First concerts==

Rostropovich gave his first cello concert in 1942. He won first prize at the international Music Awards of Prague and Budapest in 1947, 1949 and 1950. In 1950, at age 23, he was awarded what was then considered the highest distinction in the Soviet Union, the Stalin Prize. At that time, Rostropovich was already well known in his country and, while actively pursuing his solo career, taught at the Leningrad Conservatory and the Moscow Conservatory. In 1955, he married Galina Vishnevskaya, a leading soprano at the Bolshoi Theatre.

Rostropovich had working relationships with Soviet composers of the era. In 1949 Sergei Prokofiev wrote his Cello Sonata, Op. 119, for the 22-year-old Rostropovich, who gave the first performance in 1950, with Sviatoslav Richter. Prokofiev also dedicated his Symphony-Concerto to him; this was premiered in 1952. Rostropovich and Dmitry Kabalevsky completed Prokofiev&#x27;s Cello Concertino after the composer&#x27;s death. Shostakovich wrote both his first and second cello concertos for Rostropovich, who also gave their first performances.

Rostropovich went on several tours in Western Europe and met several composers, including Benjamin Britten, who dedicated his Cello Sonata, three Solo Suites, and his Cello Symphony to Rostropovich. Rostropovich gave their first performances, and the two had a special affinity; Rostropovich&#x27;s family described him as &quot;always smiling&quot; when discussing &quot;Ben&quot;, and on his deathbed he was said to have expressed no fear as he and Britten would, he believed, be reunited in Heaven.

Britten was also renowned as a pianist and together they recorded, among other works, Schubert&#x27;s Sonata for Arpeggione and Piano in A minor. His daughter claimed that this recording moved her father to tears of joy even on his deathbed.

Rostropovich also had artistic partnerships with Henri Dutilleux (&quot;Tout un monde lointain...&quot; for cello and orchestra, &quot;Trois strophes sur le nom de Sacher&quot; for solo cello), Witold Lutosławski (Cello Concerto, &quot;Sacher-Variation&quot; for solo cello), Krzysztof Penderecki (cello concerto n°2, &quot;Largo&quot; for cello and orchestra, &quot;Per Slava&quot; for solo cello, sextet for piano, clarinet, horn, violin, viola and cello), Luciano Berio (&quot;Ritorno degli snovidenia&quot; for cello and thirty instruments, &quot;Les mots sont allés...&quot; for solo cello), and Olivier Messiaen (&quot;Concert à quatre&quot; for piano, cello, oboe, flute and orchestra).

Rostropovich took private lessons in conducting with Leo Ginzburg, and first conducted in public in Gorky in November 1962, performing the four entractes from &quot;Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District&quot; and Shostakovich&#x27;s orchestration of Mussorgsky&#x27;s &quot;Songs and Dances of Death&quot; with Vishnevskaya singing.

In 1967, at the invitation of the Bolshoi Theatre&#x27;s director Mikhail Chulaki, he conducted Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; at the Bolshoi.

==August 1968 proms==
Rostropovich played at The Proms on the night of 21 August 1968. He played with the USSR State Symphony Orchestra; it was the orchestra&#x27;s debut performance at the Proms. The programme featured Czech composer Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s Cello Concerto in B minor and took place on the same day that the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia to end Alexander Dubček&#x27;s Prague Spring. After the performance, which had been preceded by heckling and demonstrations, the orchestra and soloist were cheered by the Proms audience. Rostropovich stood and held aloft the conductor&#x27;s score of the Dvořák as a gesture of solidarity for the composer&#x27;s homeland and the city of Prague.

==Exile==

Rostropovich fought for art without borders, freedom of speech, and democratic values, resulting in harassment from the Soviet regime. An early example was in 1948, when he was a student at the Moscow Conservatory. In response to the 10 February 1948 decree on &quot;formalist&quot; composers, his teacher Dmitri Shostakovich was dismissed from his professorships in Leningrad and Moscow; the 21-year-old Rostropovich quit the conservatory in protest. Rostropovich also smuggled to the West the manuscript of Shostakovich&#x27;s Symphony No. 13, which set verses by Yevgeny Yevtushenko; the subject of its first movement was the Babi Yar massacre.

In 1970, Rostropovich sheltered Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who otherwise would have had nowhere to go, in his own home. His friendship with Solzhenitsyn and support for dissidents led to official disgrace in the early 1970s. As a result, Rostropovich was restricted from foreign touring, as was his wife, Galina Vishnevskaya, and his appearances performing in Moscow were curtailed, as increasingly were his appearances in such major cities as Leningrad and Kiev.

Rostropovich left the Soviet Union in 1974 with his wife and children and settled in the United States. He was banned from touring his homeland with foreign orchestras and, in 1977, the Soviet leadership instructed musicians from the Soviet bloc not to take part in an international competition he had organised. In 1978, Rostropovich was deprived of his Soviet citizenship because of his public opposition to the Soviet Union&#x27;s restriction of cultural freedom. He did not return to the Soviet Union until 1990.

==Further career==

On 17 December 1988, Rostropovich gave a special concert at Barbican Hall in London, after postponing a trip to India for the 1988 Armenian earthquake relief program. The event was part of an effort called &quot;Musicians for Armenia,&quot; which was expected to raise more than $450,000 from donations worldwide, including gifts from musicians, concert proceeds and film and recording rights. Prince Charles and the Princess of Wales attended the concert in the sold-out 2,026-seat hall.

On 7 February 1989, a cello concert was organized by the Armenian Relief Society and the Volunteers Technical Assistance (VTA) for the victims of the earthquake. At the concert, Rostropovich played his favorite cello repertoire, including Dvořák&#x27;s Cello Concerto in B minor; Haydn&#x27;s cello concerti in C and D; Prokofiev&#x27;s Symphony-Concerto; and Shostakovich&#x27;s two cello concerti. The evening raised awareness and helped hundreds of earthquake victims put food on their tables. The concert was held at the Kennedy Center and over 2,300 were in attendance.

From 1977 to 1994, Rostropovich was music director and conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C., while still performing with famous musicians such as Martha Argerich, Sviatoslav Richter, and Vladimir Horowitz. He was also the director and founder of the Mstislav Rostropovich Baku International Festival and a regular performer at the Aldeburgh Festival.

His impromptu performance during the fall of the Berlin Wall as events unfolded was reported throughout the world. His Soviet citizenship was restored in 1990. When, in August 1991, news footage was broadcast of tanks in the streets of Moscow, Rostropovich responded with a characteristically brave, impetuous and patriotic gesture: he bought a plane ticket to Japan on a flight that stopped at Moscow, talked his way out of the airport and went to join Boris Yeltsin in the hope that his fame might make some difference to the chance of tanks moving in. Rostropovich supported Yeltsin during the 1993 constitutional crisis and conducted the National Symphony Orchestra in Red Square at the height of the crackdown.

In 1993, he was instrumental in the foundation of the Kronberg Academy and was a patron until his death. He commissioned Rodion Shchedrin to compose the opera &quot;Lolita&quot; and conducted its premiere in 1994 at the Royal Swedish Opera. Rostropovich received many international awards, including the French Legion of Honor and honorary doctorates from many universities. He was an activist, fighting for freedom of expression in art and politics. An ambassador for the UNESCO, he supported many educational and cultural projects. Rostropovich performed several times in Madrid and was a close friend of Queen Sofía of Spain.

With his wife, Galina Vishnevskaya, he founded the Rostropovich-Vishnevskaya Foundation, a publicly supported nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization based in Washington, D.C., in 1991 to improve the health and future of children in the former Soviet Union. The &quot;Rostropovich Home Museum&quot; opened on 4 March 2002, in Baku. The couple visited Azerbaijan occasionally. Rostropovich also presented cello master classes at the Azerbaijan State Conservatory. Together they formed a valuable art collection. In September 2007, when it was slated to be sold at auction by Sotheby&#x27;s in London and dispersed, Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov stepped forward and negotiated the purchase of all 450 lots to keep the collection intact and bring it to Russia as a memorial to Rostropovich. Christie&#x27;s reported that the buyer paid a &quot;substantially higher&quot; sum than the £20 million pre-sale estimate

In 2006, he was featured in Alexander Sokurov&#x27;s documentary &quot;Elegy of a life: Rostropovich, Vishnevskaya&quot;.

==Later life==
Rostropovich&#x27;s health declined in 2006, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporting rumours of unspecified surgery in Geneva and later treatment for an aggravated ulcer. Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Rostropovich to discuss details of a celebration the Kremlin was planning for 27 March 2007, Rostropovich&#x27;s 80th birthday. Rostropovich attended the celebration but was reportedly in frail health.

Though Rostropovich&#x27;s last home was in Paris, he maintained residences in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, London, Lausanne, and Jordanville, New York. He was admitted to a Paris hospital at the end of January 2007, but then decided to fly to Moscow, where he had been receiving care. On 6 February 2007 Rostropovich was admitted to a hospital in Moscow. &quot;He is just feeling unwell&quot;, Natalya Dolezhale, Rostropovich&#x27;s secretary in Moscow, said. Asked if there was serious cause for concern about his health, she said: &quot;No, right now there is no cause whatsoever.&quot; She refused to specify the nature of his illness. The Kremlin said that Putin had visited him in the hospital, which prompted speculation that he was in serious condition. Dolezhale said the visit was to discuss arrangements for marking Rostropovich&#x27;s 80th birthday. On 27 March 2007, Putin issued a statement praising Rostropovich.

On 7 April 2007, Rostropovich reentered the Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Centre, where he was treated for intestinal cancer. He died on 27 April, aged 80. On 28 April, Rostropovich&#x27;s body lay in an open casket at the Moscow Conservatory, and was then moved to the Church of Christ the Saviour. Thousands of mourners, including Putin, bade farewell. Spain&#x27;s Queen Sofia, French first lady Bernadette Chirac and President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, where Rostropovich was born, as well as Naina Yeltsina, Yeltsin&#x27;s widow, were among those who attended the funeral on 29 April. Rostropovich was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Stature==

Rostropovich was a huge influence on the younger generation of cellists. Many have openly acknowledged their debt to his example. In the &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; Julian Lloyd Webber called him &quot;probably the greatest cellist of all time&quot;.

Rostropovich either commissioned or was the recipient of compositions by many composers including Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev, Nikolai Miaskovsky, Benjamin Britten, Henri Dutilleux, Olivier Messiaen, André Jolivet, Witold Lutosławski, Luciano Berio, Krzysztof Penderecki, Leonard Bernstein, Alfred Schnittke, Aram Khachaturian, Astor Piazzolla, Andreas Makris, Sofia Gubaidulina, Arthur Bliss, Colin Matthews and Lopes Graça. His commissions of new works enlarged the cello repertoire more than any previous cellist: he gave the premiere of 117 compositions.

Rostropovich is also well known for his interpretations of standard repertoire works, including Dvořák&#x27;s Cello Concerto in B minor.

Between 1997 and 2001 he was intimately involved in the development and testing of the &quot;BACH.Bow&quot;, a curved bow designed by the cellist Michael Bach. In 2001 he invited Bach to present his &quot;BACH.Bow&quot; to Paris (7th Concours de violoncelle Rostropovitch). In 2011, the city of Moscow announced plans to erect a statue of Rostropovich in a central square; the statue was unveiled in 2012.

He was also a notably generous spirit. Seiji Ozawa relates an anecdote: on hearing of the death of the baby daughter of his friend the sumo wrestler Chiyonofuji, Rostropovich flew unannounced to Tokyo, took a -hour cab ride to Chiyonofuji&#x27;s house and played his Bach sarabande outside, as his gesture of sympathy—then got back in the taxi and returned to the airport to fly back to Europe.

Rostropovich is included in the Russian-American Chamber of Fame of Congress of Russian Americans, which is dedicated to Russian immigrants who made outstanding contributions to American science or culture.

<text>Lokeren () is a city and municipality located in the Belgian province of East Flanders, and belongs to the Waasland, also called &quot;Land van Waas&quot;, of which it is the second most important city after Sint-Niklaas. The city, located on the river Durme, the Lede, and the E17 motorway, has more than 42,100 inhabitants who are called Lokeraars or Rapenfretters. Because Lokeren is located on the Durme, Lokeren is often called &quot;The Durme City&quot;. Horse sausages are officially recognized as a regional product.

== Toponym ==
A group of authors see the element &quot;luken&quot; in the place name, which means (en)close or to close, to shut. Lokeren would refer to an enclosed place between the Durme and a forest area with wild animals.

According to another theory, the name Lokeren would derive from, on the one hand, the Indo-European root word &quot;leuk&quot;, which means clear or shiny, and on the other hand, the prehistoric hydronymic suffix &quot;arna&quot;, which means water. The problem with this theory is that there is no factual historical confirmation, although &quot;Leuk-arna&quot; is linguistically plausible.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Archaeological finds on the Lokeren territory prove that this area was populated in Neolithic times. A Roman road ran along the Durme river. The name &quot;Waas&quot; was given to this area by the Romans from the Germanic root &quot;Wasu&quot; meaning &quot;marshy land&quot;. The first mention of the name Lokeren, however, dates from 1114. Unlike the older settlements, the new village came to be built on the right bank of the Durme. By the middle of the 12th century, it had become an independent parish, with agriculture and flax as the two main drivers of the economy. The textile industry would remain important until well into the 20th century.

===14th century to 16th century===
Since its inception, Lokeren has been extensively connected with other settlements and places. The city center itself is in fact a major junction of regional roads connecting Lokeren with other important places. From those important roads came branches that today form the basis of the city center.

From the Middle Ages to the end of the 18th century, the territory of Lokeren fully belonged to the Count of Flanders. However, a number of parts of the city were lent by the count to powerful landowners such as the lords of Herzele, Kokelberge and the lord of Beveren who owned a piece of land on the left side of the Markt with a castle on it. This castle was demolished in the early 17th century after the lord sold the land to the city council. An important event in the 13th century was the establishment of the Cistercian nunnery on Oudenbos. During the ensuing period, the nuns of the monastery led major excavation works on lands in the vicinity of the monastery. These lands remained in the hands of the sisters until the end of the Ancien Régime. Other religious institutions, including Baudelo Abbey, Drongen Abbey and Ter Hagen Monastery, were also active on this territory during the High Middle Ages.

=== 16th century to 17th century ===

In 1555, Charles V gave Lokeren the right to hold a market. In the 16th and 17th century, the whole Waasland was in the line of fire between Protestant Netherlands and Catholic Spain, often with terrible consequences for the local population. Numerous &quot;Lokeraars&quot; were part of the immigration flow to the northern Netherlands at the end of the 16th century. The consequence of this (partial) depopulation was that many agricultural lands were no longer worked, becoming overgrown by wild vegetation. As a result, Lokeren had to contend with a real wolf plague in the 17th century. In the course of the 17th century, the city council tried to acquire plots of land adjacent to the Markt from their owners. In this way the market was eventually connected with the Durme and around 1651 it took on its more or less current contours. At the market was even a quay that went about 15 meters into the market square. After 1700 there is again talk of progress in the city. This was mainly due to the development of a new industry, hat manufacturing, for which Lokeren eventually became internationally known. Lokeren was the center of the oldest Flemish flax region, which included part of the Waasland and Dendermonde. This region supplied the best quality yarn to the Flemish weaving mill. From the 16th century until the 19th century, flax has been the raw material of the main industry of Flanders.

=== 18th century to 19th century ===

After the French Revolution, the area was made part of the new &quot;Département de l&#x27;Escaut&quot;, with Lokeren at the head of a canton. This did not last long as the department was split in 1800 and Lokeren made part of the arrondissement of Dendermonde. Napoleon Bonaparte promoted the town to the status of city in 1804.

In the 18th century, Lokeren, except for Ghent, had the most inhabitants of East Flanders, the then &quot;Département de l&#x27;Escaut&quot;. This demographic expansion was the result of the favorable economic climate. However, the population density was lower than in Sint-Niklaas, for example.

In the course of the 18th century, trade over water in Lokeren increased. As a result of this increasing practice, a meander of the Durme was cut off near the Buylaers. The muted meander is visible on the Ferraris map. In 1725 the Church of Saint Laurence was built on the Markt.
In December 1845, the college of aldermen asked the governor whether the city could build a station and a railway bridge over the Durme. This was necessary to create employment after the failed harvest so that the affected families could provide for themselves. The urban image of Lokeren was radically changed by the construction of a station along the Ghent-Antwerp railway. The station opened on 7 August 1847 and was located north of the Durme, in the lake area, just under 400 meters from the Markt. This station was equipped for both goods and passengers. Not much time later, the station was divided into two stations, Lokeren station and Dender &amp; Waas station. The station building itself survived until it was destroyed during World War II.

With the opening of this station and the construction of Stationsstraat, new neighborhoods were constructed on the left bank of the Durme. In the 19th century, the hamlet of Heirburg was completely connected to the center.

In the 19th century, Lokeren was booming industrially. The industrial buildings in Lokeren were rarely larger than 4 ares. In Lokeren people did not feel compelled to build factories because the cottage industry was still sufficiently profitable. Lokeren mainly focused on conservative craft sectors: the millinery and linen bleaching. This kept the city up until the early 20th century. Larger factories were later constructed.

At the end of the 19th century, this favorable course came to an end for Lokeren. Other East Flemish cities such as Aalst and Sint-Niklaas took the lead.

===20th century===
The First World War slowed the city&#x27;s growth, although the city came out virtually unscathed. During the German occupation during the Second World War, a Durchgangslager (transit camp) was set up between Bleekmeerstraat and Oude Bruglaan with the main purpose of bringing English prisoners of war together awaiting their deportation. After the liberation (during the repression) this camp was set up as an internment center for collaborators. The Lokeren Internment Center (&quot;Hechteniskamp Lokeren&quot;) was one of the largest of its kind and held between 15,000 and 22,000 detainees from September 1944 to November 1947.

Lokeren experienced a rapid and stable reconstruction of the city in the post-war period. Bombed-out houses were renovated or rebuilt, and the badly damaged station was demolished and replaced by a more modern one. Many bridges over the Durme and Lede were also rebuilt. This was followed by a major expansion of the Lokeren city center, both on a residential and industrial level.

=== Industry ===

Factories in the center continued to operate until the 1980s, when it was decided that all industrial activities should be better located outside the city core. With the decline of the secondary sector from the 1950s onward, large factories in the city center such as &quot;Nijverheidstraat&quot;, &quot;Oude Durme&quot;, &quot;Hoedhaar&quot;, etc. were closed one by one.

New industrial areas were planned outside the city center at Den Oever, Rozen and Everslaar. The Lokeren-Oost freight station was also constructed and would replace the old Dender &amp; Waas freight station. In 2018 it was announced that the Everslaer industrial park was going to be expanded. The chocolatier Callebaut bought a large piece of land where the largest chocolate warehouse in Europe would later be built. In the 1970s, the railway lines 59 and 57, which run right through the center, were laid on a viaduct. As a result, the center was divided into three parts.

===Expansion of the city center===
Between 1960 and 1980, Lokeren expanded its residential area further north of the center. Neighborhoods were constructed between railway lines 59 &amp; 77A and the N70. Later, further expansion was carried out on and around the N70 and the Oude Heerweg. After the ring or N47 was built around Lokeren, the southern part of the center was further expanded. The hamlets of Spoele and Bokslaar became neighborhoods as a result. Today, these districts extend all the way to the E17, between the N47, railway line 57 and the Everslaer industrial estate. The western part of the center was also expanded, but to a lesser extent. Because of this growth, Baudouin of Belgium paid a visit to Lokeren on 10 June 1956.

Since the merger of 1 January 1977, the sub-municipalities of Eksaarde and Daknam have been part of Lokeren. Daknam and Lokeren, however, have been one administrative unit since 1794.

<text>Sint-Niklaas (; , ) is a Belgian city and municipality located in the Flemish province of East Flanders. The municipality comprises the city of Sint-Niklaas proper and the towns of Belsele, Nieuwkerken-Waas, and .

Sint-Niklaas is the capital and major city of the Waasland region straddling the East Flanders and Antwerp provinces. The city is known for having the largest market square in Belgium. At one point this square also boasted the largest Christmas tree, and the largest easter egg in Europe.

==History==

===Thirteenth-century origins===
Although some traces of pre-Roman activity have been found on the territory of Sint-Niklaas, the regional centre during Roman times was neighbouring Waasmunster, better located on the river Durme. Belsele was already mentioned in a 9th-century document. The history of Sint-Niklaas proper, however, starts in 1217, when the bishop of Tournai, following advice from the local clergy, founded a church dedicated to Saint Nicholas here. The new parish was to depend on the See of Tournai until the middle of the 16th century. Politically, however, it was part of the County of Flanders. The power of Flanders at that time favoured the rapid economic development of the city, which became the administrative centre of the region in 1241. A document dated from 1248 records that Margaret II, Countess of Flanders, ceded additional territory to the parish of Sint-Niklaas with the proviso that it would remain bare, which explains the unusual size of the central market square today.

===14th to 17th century===

The city was never walled, which made it an easy target for conquest. In 1381, it was engulfed by fire and plundered. However, the central location of Sint-Niklaas between Ghent and Antwerp, not far from the Scheldt, favoured further development. By 1513, Emperor Maximilian had granted the city the right to hold a weekly market. Around 1580, the church of Saint Nicholas suffered heavy damage from roving iconoclasts. The 17th century was generally a period of prosperity that was marked by economic growth, mostly in the flax and wool industries. This was also the time when Sint-Niklaas was endowed with administrative buildings and three cloistered communities (Oratorians, Franciscans, and Black Sisters), which provided educational, religious, and medical services to the region. On 25 May 1690 another fire destroyed most of the city. During this period the famous Spanish noble family Sanchez de Castro y Toledo resided in Sint-Niklaas.

===18th century until now===
In the 18th century, the Austrian regime was favourable to Sint-Niklaas. The flagship textile industry adapted well to mechanization and added cotton products to its portfolio in 1764. At the end of the century, the French Revolution brought its mixture of religious intolerance and modern administration to the city. Napoleon came to visit Sint-Niklaas in 1803 and officially promoted it to the rank of city. The 19th century witnessed a general decline in the textile industry. Several new buildings were erected, including the current city hall and the &quot;Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk&quot; (Church of Our-Lady). After World War II, the textile industry went through a crisis. Today, the historic centre of the city has become mostly a shopping and services district.

<doc id="155171" wikidata="Q823623" url="?curid=155171" title="Temse">
<text>Temse (; ) is a municipality in East Flanders, Belgium.

The name Temse is derived from the Gallo-Roman/Gaul Tamisiacum or Tamasiacum. This is also reflected in the French name for the town, Tamise. The main sights include the Church of Our Lady, whose steeple was designed by the famous sculptor Adriaan Nijs, who died in Temse, and who also sculpted the wooden pulpit. Inside the church the relics of Amalberga of Temse are venerated. Close by stands the old &quot;Gemeentehuis&quot; (town hall), built in Flemish Eclectic style, housing a carillon in its main tower.

The municipality, which lies on the left side of the River Scheldt, comprises the towns of , , Temse and . On 1 January 2018, Temse had a population of 29,528. The total area is 39.92 km² which gives a population density of 740 inhabitants per km².

== Toponym ==
Temse is first mentioned under the name &quot;Temsica&quot; in a deed from 941 in which Count Arnulf I of Flanders returns a series of possessions to St. Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Ghent that his predecessors had taken. Furthermore, spellings such as &quot;Temseca&quot;, &quot;Tempseca&quot; and &quot;Thamisia&quot; also appear in medieval deeds and other documents. In older Dutch texts the place name is written as &quot;Themsche&quot; or &quot;Temsche&quot;; the last spelling was official until 1946.

As origin for the name &#x27;Temse&#x27; a Gallo-Roman form *&quot;Tamisiacum&quot; or *&quot;Tamasiacum&quot; is usually reconstructed. Place names in &quot;-(i)acus&quot; or &quot;-(i)acum&quot; (with a Gallic suffix &quot;-acos&quot; or &quot;-acon&quot;) are often derived from Latin or indigenous personal names and arose between the first and fourth centuries. According to this analysis, Temse would have belonged to someone with the Gallic name *&quot;Tamasios&quot; or *&quot;Tamisios&quot;. In this we can find the Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;temH-&quot;, which also appears in the Welsh word &quot;tywyll&quot;, &#x27;darkness&#x27; and in the Dutch &quot;deemster&quot;. *&quot;Tamasios&quot; or *&quot;Tamisios&quot; would then mean something like &#x27;the dark one&#x27; or &#x27;the dark-haired one&#x27;.

According to a competing analysis, *&quot;Tamisiacum&quot; or *&quot;Tamasiacum&quot; would not be derived from a person&#x27;s name, but from the name of a watercourse. The Proto-Indo-European root *&quot;temH-&quot; remains valid here, so it would be about a &#x27;dark watercourse&#x27;, an explanation that is also quoted for the &quot;Demer&quot; and for the &quot;Thames&quot;. Whichever derivation, &quot;Temse&quot; did not go through Grimm&#x27;s law (*&quot;t&quot; &gt; Germanic *&quot;þ&quot; &gt; Dutch &quot;d&quot;, such as in &quot;Demer&quot; from *&quot;Tamara&quot;). This may be due to the influence of the Romance languages, where this sound law does not apply.

Like other places that were already known across the language border in the Middle Ages, Temse has a French name that has undergone its own sound development. In a deed from 1221 in which Viscount Zeger III of Ghent renounces a few tithes in favor of the Bishop of Tournai, Temse is mentioned as &quot;Thamisia&quot;, a name that will become &quot;Tamise&quot; in contemporary French. Note that in the French variant of the name the suffix &quot;-(i)acum&quot; is missing, as is also the case with &quot;Geldenaken&quot; (from *&quot;Geldoniacum&quot;) and &quot;Jodoigne&quot; (from *&quot;Geldonia&quot;).

== History ==

The oldest archaeological traces of habitation go back to the Stone Age. There have been finds from the late Bronze Age, the Iron Age and the Gallo-Roman period. The Christianization of the municipality took place before 772 and in 864 the village was donated to the Blandinus abbey in Ghent by the Count of Flanders, the municipality remained in the management of a knighthood of this abbey until 1460. A weekly market was set up in 1264 and expanded by Charles V in 1519 with an annual market. On 7 July 1684 a large fire raged through Temse, destroying a large part of the village.

In 1912 the &quot;Internationale Vliegweek voor Watervliegtuigen&quot; (&quot;International Flying Week for Seaplanes&quot;) took place here, the meeting was set up for the assessment of seaplanes that could possibly be deployed in the Belgian Congo. Tests were carried out with a private aircraft by fifteen pilots from Belgium, France and Germany. It was the biggest event in Temse&#x27;s history.

During the First World War, the front magazine &quot;Onze Temschenaars&quot; appeared as a binding agent between the home and war front. Sixty-three Temse soldiers were killed and eleven requisitioned succumbed in camps. Theofiel Maes and Kamiel Van Buynder were also executed on 14 July 1917 in Fort 4 in Mortsel because of espionage activities. They had been active for the espionage service codenamed &quot;Theo&quot;, whose purpose was to inform the Belgian army about the movements of the German troops.

Between 1829 and 1994, Temse was home to the Boelwerf shipyard (locally lknown as &quot;De Zaat&quot;) which for much of the twentieth century dominated the local economy and employment market.

After the last ship was completed in 1996, the shipyard&#x27;s extensive terrain to the west of the town centre became available for redevelopment. The land was acquired in 2001 by a consortium of local construction firm Cordeel and three banks, and &quot;Nieuw Temse&quot; (New Temse) has since emerged as a whole new river-side town district and also the home of the new town hall. Local architect Pieter De Maeyer led the urban planning for the new district, and a number of high-profile architects were attracted for the design of a series of residential buildings along the river.

== Main sights ==

*Temse Bridge, road bridge in Belgium, originally designed by Gustave Eiffel.
*Church of Our Lady, with Romanesque and Gothic architecture and 17th-century interior.
* (&quot;Gemeentehuis&quot;), in Flemish Eclectic style, completed in 1906
* Temse used to have its own newspaper, namely &quot;Onze Temschenaars&quot;.

<text>Shrews (family Soricidae) are small mole-like mammals classified in the order Eulipotyphla. True shrews are not to be confused with treeshrews, otter shrews, elephant shrews, West Indies shrews, or marsupial shrews, which belong to different families or orders.

Although its external appearance is generally that of a long-nosed mouse, a shrew is not a rodent, as mice are. It is, in fact, a much closer relative of hedgehogs and moles; shrews are related to rodents only in that both belong to the Boreoeutheria magnorder. Shrews have sharp, spike-like teeth, whereas rodents have gnawing front incisor teeth.

Shrews are distributed almost worldwide. Among the major tropical and temperate land masses, only New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, and South America have no native shrews. However, as a result of the Great American Interchange, South America does have a relatively recently naturalised population, present only in the northern Andes.

The shrew family has 385 known species, making it the fourth-most species-diverse mammal family. The only mammal families with more species are the muroid rodent families (Muridae and Cricetidae) and the bat family Vespertilionidae.

==Characteristics==
All shrews are tiny, most no larger than a mouse. The largest species is the Asian house shrew (&quot;Suncus murinus&quot;) of tropical Asia, which is about long and weighs around The Etruscan shrew (&quot;Suncus etruscus&quot;), at about and , is the smallest known living terrestrial mammal.

In general, shrews are terrestrial creatures that forage for seeds, insects, nuts, worms, and a variety of other foods in leaf litter and dense vegetation e.g. grass, but some specialise in climbing trees, living underground, living under snow, or even hunting in water. They have small eyes and generally poor vision, but have excellent senses of hearing and smell. They are very active animals, with voracious appetites. Shrews have unusually high metabolic rates, above that expected in comparable small mammals. For this reason, they need to eat almost constantly like moles. Shrews in captivity can eat to 2 times their own body weight in food daily.

They do not hibernate, but some species are capable of entering torpor. In winter, many species undergo morphological changes that drastically reduce their body weight. Shrews can lose between 30% and 50% of their body weight, shrinking the size of bones, skull, and internal organs.

Whereas rodents have gnawing incisors that grow throughout life, the teeth of shrews wear down throughout life, a problem made more extreme because they lose their milk teeth before birth, so have only one set of teeth throughout their lifetimes. In some species, exposed areas of the teeth are dark red due to the presence of iron in the tooth enamel. The iron reinforces the surfaces that are exposed to the most stress, which helps prolong the life of the teeth. This adaptation is not found in species with lower metabolism, which do not have to eat as much and therefore do not wear down the enamel to the same degree. The only other mammals&#x27; teeth with pigmented enamel are the incisors of rodents. Apart from the first pair of incisors, which are long and sharp, and the chewing molars at the back of the mouth, the teeth of shrews are small and peg-like, and may be reduced in number. The dental formula of shrews is:

Shrews are fiercely territorial, driving off rivals, and coming together only to mate. Many species dig burrows for catching food and hiding from predators, although this is not universal.

Female shrews can have up to 10 litters a year; in the tropics, they breed all year round; in temperate zones, they cease breeding only in the winter. Shrews have gestation periods of 17–32 days. The female often becomes pregnant within a day or so of giving birth, and lactates during her pregnancy, weaning one litter as the next is born. Shrews live 12 to 30 months.

A characteristic behaviour observed in many species of shrew is known as &quot;caravanning&quot;. This is when a litter of young shrews form a line behind the mother, each gripping the shrew in front by the fur at the base of the tail.

Shrews are unusual among mammals in a number of respects. Unlike most mammals, some species of shrews are venomous. Shrew venom is not conducted into the wound by fangs, but by grooves in the teeth. The venom contains various compounds, and the contents of the venom glands of the American short-tailed shrew are sufficient to kill 200 mice by intravenous injection. One chemical extracted from shrew venom may be potentially useful in the treatment of high blood pressure, while another compound may be useful in the treatment of some neuromuscular diseases and migraines. The saliva of the northern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;) contains soricidin, a peptide which has been studied for use in treating ovarian cancer. Also, along with the bats and toothed whales, some species of shrews use echolocation. Unlike most other mammals, shrews lack zygomatic bones (also called the jugals), so have incomplete zygomatic arches.

===Echolocation===

The only terrestrial mammals known to echolocate are two genera (&quot;Sorex&quot; and &quot;Blarina&quot;) of shrews, the tenrecs of Madagascar, bats, and the solenodons. These include the Eurasian or common shrew (&quot;Sorex araneus&quot;) and the American vagrant shrew (&quot;Sorex vagrans&quot;) and northern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;). These shrews emit series of ultrasonic squeaks. By nature the shrew sounds, unlike those of bats, are low-amplitude, broadband, multiharmonic, and frequency modulated. They contain no &quot;echolocation clicks&quot; with reverberations and would seem to be used for simple, close-range spatial orientation. In contrast to bats, shrews use echolocation only to investigate their habitats rather than additionally to pinpoint food. 
Except for large and thus strongly reflecting objects, such as a big stone or tree trunk, they probably are not able to disentangle echo scenes, but rather derive information on habitat type from the overall call reverberations. This might be comparable to human hearing whether one calls into a beech forest or into a reverberant wine cellar.
==Classification==

The 385 shrew species are placed in 26 genera, which are grouped into three living subfamilies: Crocidurinae (white-toothed shrews), Myosoricinae (African shrews), and Soricinae (red-toothed shrews). In addition, the family contains the extinct subfamilies Limnoecinae, Crocidosoricinae, Allosoricinae, and Heterosoricinae (although Heterosoricinae is also commonly considered a separate family).

<doc id="155177" wikidata="Q2790993" url="?curid=155177" title="Iraq and weapons of mass destruction">
<text>Iraq actively researched weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and used chemical weapons from 1962 to 1991, after which it destroyed its chemical weapons stockpile and halted its biological and nuclear weapon programs as required by the United Nations Security Council. The fifth president of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, was internationally condemned for his use of chemical weapons against Kurdish civilians and military targets during the Iran–Iraq War. Saddam pursued an extensive biological weapons program and a nuclear weapons program, though no nuclear bomb was built. After the Gulf War, the United Nations located and destroyed large quantities of Iraqi chemical weapons and related equipment and materials; Iraq ceased its chemical, biological and nuclear programs.

In the early 2000s, U.S. president George W. Bush and British prime minister Tony Blair both falsely asserted that Saddam&#x27;s weapons programs were still active and large stockpiles of WMD were hidden in Iraq. Inspections by the UN to resolve the status of unresolved disarmament questions restarted between November 2002 and March 2003, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, which demanded Hussein provide &quot;immediate, unconditional and active cooperation&quot; to UN and IAEA inspections. The United States asserted that Hussein&#x27;s lack of cooperation was a breach of Resolution 1441, but failed to convince the United Nations Security Council to pass a new resolution authorizing the use of force. Despite this, Bush asserted peaceful measures could not disarm Iraq and launched the Iraq War. A year later, the U.S. Senate released its Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq which concluded that many of the pre-war statements about Iraqi WMD were not supported by the underlying intelligence.

U.S.-led inspections later found that Iraq had ceased active WMD production and stockpiling. Some have argued the false WMD allegations were used as a deliberate pretext for war. In 2002, Illinois state senator and future US president Barack Obama opposed intervention in Iraq. By 2004, future president Donald Trump began to oppose the war. During his 2008 presidential campaign Senator John McCain supported the war, but in 2018 said the war was a &quot;mistake&quot;.

Iraq signed the Geneva Protocol in 1931, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1969, and the Biological Weapons Convention in 1972 but did not ratify it until June 11, 1991. Iraq ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention in January 2009, with its entry into force for Iraq coming a month later on February 12.

==History==
===Program development 1960s–1980s===

1959 August 17 USSR and Iraq signed an agreement for the USSR to build a nuclear power plant and established a nuclear program as part of their mutual understanding.

1968 a Soviet supplied IRT-2000 research reactor together with a number of other facilities that could be used for radioisotope production was built close to Baghdad.

1975 Saddam Hussein arrived in Moscow and asked about building an advanced model of an atomic power station. Moscow would approve only if the station was regulated by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but Iraq refused. However, an agreement of co-operation was signed on April 15, which superseded the one of 1959.

After 6 months France agreed to sell 72 kg of 93% uranium and built a nuclear power plant without IAEA control at a price of $3 billion.

In the early 1970s, Saddam Hussein ordered the creation of a clandestine nuclear weapons program. Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction programs were assisted by a wide variety of firms and governments in the 1970s and 1980s. As part of Project 922, Iraq built chemical weapons facilities such as laboratories, bunkers, an administrative building, and first production buildings in the early 1980s under the cover of a pesticide plant. German firms sent 1,027 tons of precursors of mustard gas, sarin, tabun, and tear gasses in all. This work allowed Iraq to produce 150 tons of mustard agent and 60 tons of Tabun in 1983 and 1984 respectively, continuing throughout the decade. Five other German firms supplied equipment to manufacture botulin toxin and mycotoxin for germ warfare. In 1988, German engineers presented centrifuge data that helped Iraq expand its nuclear weapons program. Laboratory equipment and other information was provided, involving many German engineers. All told, 52% of Iraq&#x27;s international chemical weapon equipment was of German origin. The State Establishment for Pesticide Production (SEPP) ordered culture media and incubators from Germany&#x27;s Water Engineering Trading.

====Western help with Iraq&#x27;s WMD program====
====United States====
The United States supported Iraq during the Iran–Iraq war with over $500 million worth of dual-use equipment that were approved by the Commerce department. Among them were advanced computers, some of which were used in Iraq&#x27;s nuclear program. The non-profit American Type Culture Collection and the Centers for Disease Control sold or sent biological samples of anthrax, West Nile virus and botulism to Iraq up until 1989, which Iraq claimed it needed for medical research. A number of these materials were used for Iraq&#x27;s biological weapons research program, while others were used for vaccine development. For example, the Iraqi military settled on the American Type Culture Collection strain 14578 as the exclusive anthrax strain for use as a biological weapon, according to Charles Duelfer.

The United States government invited a delegation of Iraqi weapons scientists to an August 1989 &quot;detonation conference&quot; in Portland, Oregon. The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Energy conference featured experts that explained to the Iraqis and other attendees how to generate shock waves in any needed configuration. The conference included lectures on HMX, a powerful explosive generally preferred for nuclear detonation, and on flyer plates, which are devices for generating the specific type of shock waves necessary for nuclear bomb ignition. Both HMX and flyer plates were in fact later found at Iraqi nuclear research sites by United Nations weapons inspectors.

====United Kingdom====

In 1985, the Second Thatcher ministry allowed a German-owned and British-based company, Uhde Ltd, to construct a factory in Iraq which was intended to be used for mustard and nerve gas production by the Iraqis. During the late 1980s, the British government secretly granted Coventry-based engineering company Matrix Churchill permission to sell parts to Iraq for use in their weapons programs, while several UK firms sold components to Canadian engineer Gerald Bull for Project Babylon. In March 1990, a case of nuclear triggers bound for Iraq was seized by HM Customs and Excise at Heathrow Airport. The Scott Report uncovered much of the secrecy that had surrounded the &quot;Arms-to-Iraq&quot; affair, as it became known when knowledge of UK arm sales to Iraq became public.

Iraq&#x27;s nuclear weapons program suffered a serious setback in 1981 when the Osiraq reactor, which would have been capable of breeding weapons-usable nuclear material, was bombed by the Israeli Air Force before it could be commissioned. David Albright and Mark Hibbs, writing for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, disagree with this view, however. There were far too many technological challenges unsolved, they say.

===Iran–Iraq War===

In 1980, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency filed a report stating that Iraq had been actively acquiring chemical weapons capacities for several years, which later proved to be accurate. In November 1980, two months into the Iran–Iraq War, the first reported use of chemical weapons took place when Tehran radio reported a poison gas attack on Susangerd by Iraqi forces. The United Nations reported many similar attacks occurred the following year, leading Iran to develop and deploy a mustard gas capability. By 1984, Iraq was using poison gas with great effectiveness against Iranian &quot;human wave&quot; attacks. Chemical weapons were used extensively against Iran during the Iran–Iraq War. On January 14, 1991, the Defense Intelligence Agency said an Iraqi agent described, in medically accurate terms, military smallpox casualties he said he saw in 1985 or 1986. Two weeks later, the Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center reported that eight of 69 Iraqi prisoners of war whose blood was tested showed an immunity to smallpox, which had not occurred naturally in Iraq since 1971; the same prisoners had also been inoculated for anthrax. The assumption being that Iraq used both smallpox and anthrax during this war.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that in 1984 the CIA secretly started providing intelligence to the Iraqi army during the Iran-Iraq War. This included information to target chemical weapons strikes. The same year it was confirmed beyond doubt by European doctors and UN expert missions that Iraq was employing chemical weapons against the Iranians. Most of these occurred during the Iran–Iraq War, but chemical weapons were used at least once against the Shia popular uprising in southern Iraq in 1991. Chemical weapons were used extensively, with post-war Iranian estimates stating that more than 100,000 Iranians were affected by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s chemical weapons during the eight-year war with Iraq. Iran today is the world&#x27;s second-most afflicted country by weapons of mass destruction, only after Japan. The official estimate does not include the civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans. Nerve gas agents killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 90,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions. Many others were affected by mustard gas. There is deep resentment and anger in Iran that it was Western nations that helped Iraq develop and direct its chemical weapons arsenal in the first place and that the world did nothing to punish Iraq for its use of chemical weapons throughout the war. For example, the United States and the UK blocked condemnation of Iraq&#x27;s known chemical weapons attacks at the UN Security Council. No resolution was passed during the war that specifically criticized Iraq&#x27;s use of chemical weapons, despite the wishes of the majority to condemn this use. On March 21, 1986, the United Nation Security Council recognized that &quot;chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by Iraqi forces against Iranian forces&quot;; this statement was opposed by the United States, the sole country to vote against it in the Security Council (the UK abstained).

On March 23, 1988, western media sources reported from Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan, that several days before Iraq had launched a large-scale chemical assault on the town. Later estimates were that 7,000 people had been killed and 20,000 wounded. The Halabja poison gas attack caused an international outcry against the Iraqis. Later that year the U.S. Senate proposed the Prevention of Genocide Act of 1988, cutting off all U.S. assistance to Iraq and stopping U.S. imports of Iraqi oil. The Reagan administration opposed the bill, calling it premature, and eventually prevented it from taking effect, partly due to a mistaken DIA assessment which blamed Iran for the attack. At the time of the attack the town was held by Iranian troops and Iraqi Kurdish guerrillas allied with Tehran. The Iraqis blamed the Halabja attack on Iranian forces. On August 21, 2006, the trial of Saddam Hussein and six codefendants, including Hassan al-Majid (&quot;Chemical Ali&quot;), opened on charges of genocide against the Kurds. While this trial does not cover the Halabja attack, it does cover attacks on other villages during the Iraqi &quot;Anfal&quot; operation alleged to have included bombing with chemical weapons.

===1991 Gulf War===

On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait and was widely condemned internationally.

An international coalition of nations, led by the United States, liberated Kuwait in 1991.

In the terms of the UN ceasefire set out in Security Council Resolution 686, and in Resolution 687, Iraq was forbidden from developing, possessing or using chemical, biological and nuclear weapons by resolution 686. These binding resolutions also proscribed missiles with a range of more than 150 kilometres. The UN Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) was created to carry out weapons inspections in Iraq, and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was to verify the destruction of Iraq&#x27;s nuclear program.

===UN inspections===

====UNSCOM inspections 1991–1998====

The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) was set up after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to inspect Iraqi weapons facilities. It was headed first by Rolf Ekéus and later by Richard Butler. During several visits to Iraq by UNSCOM, weapons inspectors interviewed British-educated Iraqi biologist Rihab Rashid Taha. According to a 1999 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the normally mild-mannered Taha exploded into violent rages whenever UNSCOM questioned her about al-Hakam, shouting, screaming and, on one occasion, smashing a chair, while insisting that al-Hakam was a chicken-feed plant. &quot;There were a few things that were peculiar about this animal-feed production plant&quot;, Charles Duelfer, UNSCOM&#x27;s deputy executive chairman, later told reporters, &quot;beginning with the extensive air defenses surrounding it.&quot; The facility was destroyed by UNSCOM in 1996.

In 1995, UNSCOM&#x27;s principal weapons inspector, Rod Barton from Australia, showed Taha documents obtained by UNSCOM that showed the Iraqi government had just purchased 10 tons of growth medium from a British company called Oxoid. Growth medium is a mixture of sugars, proteins and minerals that provides nutrients for microorganisms to grow. It can be used in hospitals and microbiology/molecular biology research laboratories. In hospitals, swabs from patients are placed in dishes containing growth medium for diagnostic purposes. Iraq&#x27;s hospital consumption of growth medium was just 200 kg a year; yet in 1988, Iraq imported 39 tons of it. Shown this evidence by UNSCOM, Taha admitted to the inspectors that she had grown 19,000 litres of botulinum toxin; 8,000 litres of anthrax; 2,000 litres of aflatoxins, which can cause liver failure; &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;, a bacterium that can cause gas gangrene; and ricin. She also admitted conducting research into cholera, salmonella, foot and mouth disease, and camel pox, a disease that uses the same growth techniques as smallpox, but which is safer for researchers to work with. It was because of the discovery of Taha&#x27;s work with camel pox that the U.S. and British intelligence services feared Saddam Hussein may have been planning to weaponize the smallpox virus. Iraq had a smallpox outbreak in 1971 and the Weapons Intelligence, Nonproliferation and Arms Control Center (WINPAC) believed the Iraqi government retained contaminated material.

The inspectors feared that Taha&#x27;s team had experimented on human beings. During one inspection, they discovered two primate-sized inhalation chambers, one measuring 5 cubic meters, though there was no evidence the Iraqis had used large primates in their experiments. According to former weapons inspector Scott Ritter in his 1999 book &quot;Endgame: Solving the Iraq Crisis&quot;, UNSCOM learned that, between 1 July and 15 August 1995, 50 prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison were transferred to a military post in al-Haditha, in the northwest of Iraq. Iraqi opposition groups say that scientists sprayed the prisoners with anthrax, though no evidence was produced to support these allegations. During one experiment, the inspectors were told, 12 prisoners were tied to posts while shells loaded with anthrax were blown up nearby. Ritter&#x27;s team demanded to see documents from Abu Ghraib prison showing a prisoner count. Ritter writes that they discovered the records for July and August 1995 were missing. Asked to explain the missing documents, the Iraqi government charged that Ritter was working for the CIA and refused UNSCOM access to certain sites like Baath Party headquarters. Although Ekéus has said that he resisted attempts at such espionage, many allegations have since been made against the agency commission under Butler, charges which Butler has denied.

In April 1991 Iraq provided its first of what would be several declarations of its chemical weapons programs. Subsequent declarations submitted by Iraq in June 1992, March 1995 and June 1996 came only after pressure from UNSCOM. In February 1998, UNSCOM unanimously determined that after seven years of attempts to establish the extent of Iraq&#x27;s chemical weapons programs, that Iraq had still not given the Commission sufficient information for them to conclude that Iraq had undertaken all the disarmament steps required by the UNSC resolutions concerning chemical weapons.

In August 1991 Iraq had declared to the UNSCOM biological inspection team that it did indeed have a biological weapons program but that it was for defensive purposes. Iraq then provided its first biological weapons declaration shortly after. After UNSCOM determined such declarations to be incomplete, more pressure was placed on Iraq to declare fully and completely. A second disclosure of the biological weapons came in March 1995. After UNSCOM&#x27;s investigations and the discovery of inreffutable evidence, Iraq was forced to admit for the first time the existence of an offensive biological weapons program. But Iraq still denied weaponization. Further UNSCOM pressure resulted in a third prohibited biological weapons disclosure from Iraq in August 1995. Only after General Hussein Kamel al-Majid, Minister of Industry and Minerals and former Director of Iraq&#x27;s Military Industrialization Corporation, with responsibility for all of Iraq&#x27;s weapons programs, fled Iraq for Jordan, Iraq was forced to reveal that its biological warfare program was much more extensive than was previously admitted and that the program included weaponization. At this time, Iraq admitted that it had achieved the ability to produce longer-range missiles than had previously been admitted to. At this point, Iraq provides UNSCOM and IAEA with more documentation that turns out Hussein Kamel al-Majid had hidden on a chicken farm. These documents gave further revelation to Iraq&#x27;s development of VX gas and its attempts to develop a nuclear weapon. More declarations would follow in June 1996 and September 1997. However, in April and July 1998, the biological weapons team and UNSCOM Executive Chairman assessed that Iraq&#x27;s declarations were as yet &quot;unverifiable&quot; and &quot;incomplete and inadequate&quot;, seven years after the first declarations were given in 1991.

In August 1998, Ritter resigned his position as UN weapons inspector and sharply criticized the Clinton administration and the UN Security Council for not being vigorous enough about insisting that Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction be destroyed. Ritter also accused UN Secretary General Kofi Annan of assisting Iraqi efforts at impeding UNSCOM&#x27;s work. &quot;Iraq is not disarming&quot;, Ritter said on 27 August 1998, and in a second statement, &quot;Iraq retains the capability to launch a chemical strike.&quot; In 1998 the UNSCOM weapons inspectors left Iraq. There is considerable debate about whether they were &quot;withdrawn&quot;, &quot;expelled&quot; from the country by Iraqi officials (as alleged by George W. Bush in his &quot;axis of evil&quot; speech), or they chose to leave because they felt their hands were tied sufficiently to see the mission as hopeless. According to Butler himself in his book Saddam Defiant, it was U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, acting on instructions from Washington, who suggested Butler pull his team from Iraq in order to protect them from the forthcoming U.S. and British airstrikes which eventually took place from December 16–19, 1998.

====Between inspections: 1998–2003====

In August 1998 Scott Ritter remarked that, absent effective monitoring, Iraq could &quot;reconstitute chemical biological weapons, long-range ballistic missiles to deliver these weapons, and even certain aspects of their nuclear weaponization program.&quot;

In June 1999, Ritter responded to an interviewer, saying: &quot;When you ask the question, &#x27;Does Iraq possess militarily viable biological or chemical weapons?&#x27; the answer is no! It is a resounding NO. Can Iraq produce today chemical weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Can Iraq produce biological weapons on a meaningful scale? No! Ballistic missiles? No! It is &#x27;no&#x27; across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been disarmed.&quot; Ritter later accused some UNSCOM personnel of spying, and he strongly criticized the Bill Clinton administration for misusing the commission&#x27;s resources to eavesdrop on the Iraqi military. According to Ritter: &quot;Iraq today (1999) possesses no meaningful weapons of mass destruction capability.&quot;

In June 2000, Ritter penned a piece for Arms Control Today entitled &quot;The Case for Iraq&#x27;s Qualitative Disarmament&quot;. 2001 saw the theatrical release of his documentary on the UNSCOM weapons inspections in Iraq, &quot;In Shifting Sands: The Truth About Unscom and the Disarming of Iraq&quot;. The film was funded by an Iraqi-American businessman who, unknown to Ritter, had received Oil-for-Food coupons from the Iraqi administration.

In 2002, Scott Ritter stated that, by 1998, 90–95% of Iraq&#x27;s nuclear, biological and chemical capabilities, and long-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering such weapons, had been verified as destroyed. Technical 100% verification was not possible, said Ritter, not because Iraq still had any hidden weapons, but because Iraq&#x27; had preemptively destroyed some stockpiles and claimed they had never existed. Many people were surprised by Ritter&#x27;s turnaround in his view of Iraq during a period when no inspections were made.

During the 2002–2003 build-up to war, Ritter criticized the Bush administration and maintained that it had provided no credible evidence that Iraq had reconstituted a significant WMD capability. In an interview with &quot;Time&quot; in September 2002 Ritter said there were attempts to use UNSCOM for spying on Iraq. According to the New York Times and Washington Post media of Jan. 8, 1999, &quot;In March [1998], in a last-ditch attempt to uncover Saddam Hussein&#x27;s covert weapons and intelligence networks, the United States used the United Nations inspection team to send an American spy into
Baghdad to install a highly sophisticated electronic eavesdropping system.&quot;

UNSCOM encountered various difficulties and a lack of cooperation from the Iraqi government. In 1998, UNSCOM was withdrawn at the request of the United States before Operation Desert Fox. Despite this, UNSCOM&#x27;s own estimate was that 90–95% of Iraqi WMD had been successfully destroyed before its 1998 withdrawal. After that, for four years (from 1998 to 2002) Iraq remained without any outside weapons inspectors. During this time speculations arose that Iraq had actively resumed its WMD programs. In particular, various figures in the George W. Bush administration, as well as Congress, went so far as to express concern about nuclear weapons.

There is a dispute about whether Iraq still had WMD programs after 1998 and whether its cooperation with the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) was complete. Chief weapons inspector Hans Blix said in January 2003 that &quot;access has been provided to all sites we have wanted to inspect&quot; and Iraq had &quot;cooperated rather well&quot; in that regard, although &quot;Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance of the disarmament.&quot; On March 7, in an address to the Security Council, Hans Blix stated: &quot;Against this background, the question is now asked whether Iraq has cooperated &quot;immediately, unconditionally and actively&quot; with UNMOVIC, as is required under paragraph 9 of resolution 1441 (2002)... while the numerous initiatives, which are now taken by the Iraqi side with a view to resolving some long-standing open disarmament issues, can be seen as &quot;active&quot;, or even &quot;proactive&quot;, these initiatives 3–4 months into the new resolution cannot be said to constitute &quot;immediate&quot; cooperation. Nor do they necessarily cover all areas of relevance.&quot; Some U.S. officials understood this contradictory statement as a declaration of noncompliance.

There were no weapon inspections in Iraq for nearly four years after the UN departed from Iraq in 1998, and Iraq asserted that they would never be invited back. In addition, Saddam had issued a &quot;secret order&quot; that Iraq did not have to abide by any UN Resolution since in his view &quot;the United States had broken international law&quot;.

In 2001, Saddam stated: &quot;we are not at all seeking to build up weapons or look for the most harmful weapons . . . however, we will never hesitate to possess the weapons to defend Iraq and the Arab nation&quot;. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in Britain published in September 2002 a review of Iraq&#x27;s military capability, and concluded that Iraq could assemble nuclear weapons within months if fissile material from foreign sources were obtained. However, IISS also concluded that without such foreign sources, it would take years at a bare minimum.

Dr. Mahdi Obeidi, who created Saddam&#x27;s nuclear centrifuge program that had successfully enriched uranium to weapons grade before the 1991 Gulf War, stated in an op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that although Iraqi scientists possessed the knowledge to restart the nuclear program, by 2002 the idea had become &quot;a vague dream from another era.&quot;

===Iraq War===

Possession of WMD was cited by the United States as the primary motivation instigating the Iraq War.

====Prelude====
In late 2002 Saddam Hussein, in a letter to Hans Blix, invited UN weapons inspectors back into the country. Subsequently, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 was issued, authorizing new inspections in Iraq. The United States claimed that Iraq&#x27;s latest weapons declaration left materials and munitions unaccounted for; the Iraqis claimed that all such material had been destroyed, something which had been stated years earlier by Iraq&#x27;s highest-ranking defector, Hussein Kamel al-Majid. According to reports from the previous UN inspection agency, UNSCOM, Iraq produced 600 metric tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, VX and sarin; nearly 25,000 rockets and 15,000 artillery shells, with chemical agents, are still unaccounted for.

In January 2003, United Nations weapons inspectors reported that they had found no indication that Iraq possessed nuclear weapons or an active program. Some former UNSCOM inspectors disagree about whether the United States could know for certain whether or not Iraq had renewed production of weapons of mass destruction. Robert Gallucci said, &quot;If Iraq had [uranium or plutonium], a fair assessment would be they could fabricate a nuclear weapon, and there is no reason for us to assume we would find out if they had.&quot; Similarly, former inspector Jonathan Tucker said, &quot;Nobody really knows what Iraq has. You really can not tell from a satellite image what is going on inside a factory.&quot; However, Hans Blix said in late January 2003 that Iraq had &quot;not genuinely accepted UN resolutions demanding that it disarm.&quot; He claimed there were some materials which had not been accounted for. Since sites had been found which evidenced the destruction of chemical weaponry, UNSCOM was actively working with Iraq on methods to ascertain for certain whether the amounts destroyed matched up with the amounts that Iraq had produced. In the next quarterly report, after the war, the total amount of proscribed items destroyed by UNMOVIC in Iraq can be gathered. Those include:

* 50 deployed Al-Samoud 2 missiles
* Various equipment, including vehicles, engines and warheads, related to the AS2 missiles
* 2 large propellant casting chambers
* 14 155 mm shells filled with mustard gas, the mustard gas totaling approximately 49 litres and still at high purity
* Approximately 500 ml of thiodiglycol
* Some 122 mm chemical warheads
* Some chemical equipment
* 224.6 kg of expired growth media

In an attempt to counter the allegations that some WMD arsenals (or capability) were indeed hidden from inspectors, Scott Ritter would argue later:

Ritter also argued that the WMD Saddam had in his possession all those years ago, if retained, would have long since turned to harmless substances. He stated that Iraqi Sarin and tabun have a shelf life of approximately five years, VX lasts a bit longer (but not much longer), and finally he said botulinum toxin and liquid anthrax last about three years.

====Legal justification====


On March 17, 2003, Lord Goldsmith, Attorney General of the UK, set out his government&#x27;s legal justification for an invasion of Iraq. He said that Security Council resolution 678 authorised force against Iraq, which was suspended but not terminated by resolution 687, which imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction. A material breach of resolution 687 would revive the authority to use force under resolution 678. In resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 687 because it had not fully carried out its obligations to disarm. Although resolution 1441 had given Iraq a final chance to comply, UK Attorney General Goldsmith wrote &quot;it is plain that Iraq has failed so to comply&quot;. Most member governments of the United Nations Security Council made clear that after resolution 1441 there still was no authorization for the use of force. Indeed, at the time 1441 was passed, both the U.S. and UK representatives stated explicitly that 1441 contained no provision for military action. Then-U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte was quoted as saying:

There&#x27;s no &quot;automaticity&quot; and this is a two-stage process, and in that regard we have met the principal concerns that have been expressed for the resolution [...] Whatever violation there is, or is judged to exist, will be dealt with in the council, and the council will have an opportunity to consider the matter before any other action is taken.

The British ambassador to the UN, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, concurred:

We heard loud and clear during the negotiations the concerns about &quot;automaticity&quot; and &quot;hidden triggers&quot; – the concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be discussed by the Council. Let me be equally clear in response, as one of the co-sponsors of the text we have adopted: there is no &quot;automaticity&quot; in this Resolution.

The UN itself never had the chance to declare that Iraq had failed to take its &quot;final opportunity&quot; to comply as the U.S. invasion made it a moot point. American President George W. Bush stated that Saddam Hussein had 48 hours to step down and leave Iraq.

====Coalition expanded intelligence====
On 30 May 2003, Paul Wolfowitz stated in an interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine that the issue of weapons of mass destruction was the point of greatest agreement among Bush&#x27;s team among the reasons to remove Saddam Hussein from power. He said, &quot;The truth is that for reasons that have a lot to do with the U.S. government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on, which was weapons of mass destruction as the core reason, but, there have always been three fundamental concerns. One is weapons of mass destruction, the second is support for terrorism, the third is the criminal treatment of the Iraqi people. Actually I guess you could say there&#x27;s a fourth overriding one which is the connection between the first two.&quot;

In an interview with BBC in June 2004, David Kay, former head of the Iraq Survey Group, made the following comment: &quot;Anyone out there holding as I gather Prime Minister Blair has recently said the prospect that, in fact, the Iraq Survey Group is going to unmask actual weapons of mass destruction, [is] really delusional.&quot;

In 2002, Scott Ritter, a former UNSCOM weapons inspector heavily criticized the Bush administration and media outlets for using the testimony of alleged former Iraqi nuclear scientist Khidir Hamza, who defected from Iraq in 1994, as a rationale for invading Iraq:

We seized the entire records of the Iraqi Nuclear program, especially the administrative records. We got a name of everybody, where they worked, what they did, and the top of the list, Saddam&#x27;s &quot;Bombmaker&quot; [which was the title of Hamza&#x27;s book, and earned the nickname afterwards] was a man named Jafar Dhia Jafar, not Khidir Hamza, and if you go down the list of the senior administrative personnel you will not find Hamza&#x27;s name in there. In fact, we didn&#x27;t find his name at all. Because in 1990, he didn&#x27;t work for the Iraqi nuclear program. He had no knowledge of it because he worked as a kickback specialist for Hussein Kamel in the Presidential Palace.

He goes into northern Iraq and meets up with Ahmad Chalabi. He walks in and says, I&#x27;m Saddam&#x27;s &quot;Bombmaker&quot;. So they call the CIA and they say, &quot;We know who you are, you&#x27;re not Saddam&#x27;s &#x27;Bombmaker&#x27;, go sell your story to someone else.&quot; And he was released, he was rejected by all intelligence services at the time, he&#x27;s a fraud.

And here we are, someone who the CIA knows is a fraud, the US Government knows is a fraud, is allowed to sit in front of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and give testimony as an expert witness. I got a problem with that, I got a problem with the American media, and I&#x27;ve told them over and over and over again that this man is a documentable fraud, a fake, and yet they allow him to go on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and testify as if he actually knows what he is talking about.
On June 4, 2003, U.S. Senator Pat Roberts announced that the U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence that he chaired would, as a part of its ongoing oversight of the intelligence community, conduct a Review of intelligence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. On July 9, 2004, the Committee released the Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq. On July 17, 2003, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair said in an address to the U.S. Congress, that history would forgive the United States and United Kingdom, even if they were wrong about weapons of mass destruction. He still maintained that &quot;with every fiber of instinct and conviction&quot; Iraq did have weapons of mass destruction.

On February 3, 2004, British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw announced an independent inquiry, to be chaired by Lord Butler of Brockwell, to examine the reliability of British intelligence relating to alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. The Butler Review was published July 14, 2004.
In the buildup to the 2003 war, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a number of stories claiming to prove that Iraq possessed WMD. One story in particular, written by Judith Miller, helped persuade the American public that Iraq had WMD: in September 2002 she wrote about an intercepted shipment of aluminum tubes which the NYT said were to be used to develop nuclear material. It is now generally understood that they were not intended (or well suited) for that purpose but rather for artillery rockets. The story was followed up with television appearances by Colin Powell, Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice all pointing to the story as part of the basis for taking military action against Iraq. Miller&#x27;s sources were introduced to her by Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi exile favorable to a U.S. invasion of Iraq. Miller is also listed as a speaker for The Middle East Forum, an organization which openly declared support for an invasion. In May 2004 the New York Times published an editorial which stated that its journalism in the buildup to war had sometimes been lax. It appears that in the cases where Iraqi exiles were used for the stories about WMD were either ignorant as to the real status of Iraq&#x27;s WMD or lied to journalists to achieve their own ends.

Despite the intelligence lapse, Bush stood by his decision to invade Iraq, stating:
But what wasn&#x27;t wrong was Saddam Hussein had invaded a country, he had used weapons of mass destruction, he had the capability of making weapons of mass destruction, he was firing at our pilots. He was a state sponsor of terror. Removing Saddam Hussein was the right thing for world peace and the security of our country.

In a speech before the World Affairs Council of Charlotte, NC, on April 7, 2006, President Bush stated that he &quot;fully understood that the intelligence was wrong, and [he was] just as disappointed as everybody else&quot; when U.S. troops failed to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

Intelligence shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq was heavily used as support arguments in favor of military intervention, with the October 2002 C.I.A. report on Iraqi WMD considered to be the most reliable one available at that time.

&quot;According to the CIA&#x27;s report, all U.S. intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons. There is little question that Saddam Hussein wants to develop nuclear weapons.&quot; Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) – Congressional Record, October 9, 2002

On May 29, 2003, Andrew Gilligan appeared on the &quot;BBC&#x27;s Today&quot; program early in the morning. He reported that the government &quot;ordered (the September Dossier, a British Government dossier on WMD) to be sexed up, to be made more exciting, and ordered more facts to be...discovered.&quot;

On 27 May 2003, a secret US Defense Intelligence Agency fact-finding mission in Iraq reported unanimously to intelligence officials in Washington that two trailers captured in Iraq by Kurdish troops &quot;had nothing to do with biological weapons.&quot; The trailers had been a key part of the argument for the 2003 invasion; Secretary of State Colin Powell had told the United Nations Security Council, &quot;We have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails. We know what the fermenters look like. We know what the tanks, pumps, compressors and other parts look like.&quot; The Pentagon team had been sent to investigate the trailers after the invasion. The team of experts unanimously found &quot;no connection to anything biological&quot;; one of the experts told reporters that they privately called the trailers &quot;the biggest sand toilets in the world.&quot; The report was classified, and the next day, the CIA publicly released the assessment of its Washington analysts that the trailers were &quot;mobile biological weapons production.&quot; The White House continued to refer to the trailers as mobile biological laboratories throughout the year, and the Pentagon field report remained classified. It is still classified, but a &quot;Washington Post&quot; report of 12 April 2006, disclosed some of the details of the report. According to the &quot;Post&quot;:

A spokesman for the DIA asserted that the team&#x27;s findings were neither ignored nor suppressed, but were incorporated in the work of the Iraqi Survey Group, which led the official search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. The survey group&#x27;s final report in September 2004, 15 months after the technical report was written, noted the trailers were &quot;impractical&quot; for biological weapons production and were &quot;almost certainly intended&quot; for manufacturing hydrogen for weather balloons.

US General Tommy Franks was quoted as saying: &quot;I think no one in this country probably was more surprised than I when weapons of mass destruction were not used against our troops as they moved toward Baghdad.&quot;

On 6 February 2004, U.S. President George W. Bush named an Iraq Intelligence Commission, chaired by Charles Robb and Laurence Silberman, to investigate U.S. intelligence, specifically regarding the 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. On 8 February 2004, Hans Blix, in an interview on BBC TV, accused the U.S. and UK governments of dramatising the threat of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, in order to strengthen the case for the 2003 war against the government of Saddam Hussein.

====Iraq Survey Group====
On May 30, 2003, the U.S. Department of Defense briefed the media that it was ready to formally begin the work of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), a fact-finding mission from the coalition of the Iraq occupation into the WMD programs developed by Iraq, taking over from the British-American 75th Exploitation Task Force.

Various nuclear facilities, including the Baghdad Nuclear Research Facility and Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center, were found looted in the month following the invasion. (Gellman, May 3, 2003) On June 20, 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that tons of uranium, as well as other radioactive materials such as thorium, had been recovered and that the vast majority had remained on site. There were several reports of radiation sickness in the area. It has been suggested that the documents and suspected weapons sites were looted and burned in Iraq by looters in the final days of the war.

On September 30, 2004, the U.S. Iraq Survey Group issued its Final Report. Among its key findings were:

#&quot;Saddam Husayn so dominated the Iraqi Regime that its strategic intent was his alone. He wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when sanctions were lifted.&quot;
#&quot;Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq&#x27;s WMD capability—which was essentially destroyed in 1991—after sanctions were removed and Iraq&#x27;s economy stabilized, but probably with a different mix of capabilities to that which previously existed. Saddam aspired to develop a nuclear capability—in an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks—but he intended to focus on ballistic missile and tactical chemical warfare (CW) capabilities;&quot;
# &quot;Iran was the pre-eminent motivator of [Iraq&#x27;s WMD] policy. All senior level Iraqi officials considered Iran to be Iraq&#x27;s principal enemy in the region. The wish to balance Israel and acquire status and influence in the Arab world were also considerations, but secondary.&quot;
# &quot;The former Regime had no formal written strategy or plan for the revival of WMD after sanctions. Neither was there an identifiable group of WMD policy makers or planners separate from Saddam. Instead, his lieutenants understood WMD revival was his goal from their long association with Saddam and his infrequent, but firm, verbal comments and directions to them.&quot; 
# &quot;Saddam did not consider the United States a natural adversary, as he did Iran and Israel, and he hoped that Iraq might again enjoy improved relations with the United States, according to Tariq &#x27;Aziz and the presidential secretary.&quot;
# Evidence of the maturity and significance of the pre-1991 Iraqi Nuclear Program but found that Iraq&#x27;s ability to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program progressively decayed after that date;
# Concealment of the nuclear program in its entirety, as with Iraq&#x27;s BW program. Aggressive UN inspections after Desert Storm forced Saddam to admit the existence of the program and destroy or surrender components of the program;
# After Desert Storm, Iraq concealed key elements of its program and preserved what it could of the professional capabilities of its nuclear scientific community;
# &quot;Saddam&#x27;s primary goal from 1991 to 2003 was to have UN sanctions lifted, while maintaining the security of the Regime. He sought to balance the need to cooperate with UN inspections—to gain support for lifting sanctions—with his intention to preserve Iraq&#x27;s intellectual capital for WMD with a minimum of foreign intrusiveness and loss of face. Indeed, this remained the goal to the end of the Regime, as the starting of any WMD program, conspicuous or otherwise, risked undoing the progress achieved in eroding sanctions and jeopardizing a political end to the embargo and international monitoring;&quot;
# A limited number of post-1995 activities would have aided the reconstitution of the nuclear weapons program once sanctions were lifted.

The report found that &quot;The ISG has not found evidence that Saddam possessed WMD stocks in 2003, but [there is] the possibility that some weapons existed in Iraq, although not of a militarily significant capability.&quot; It also concluded that there was a possible intent to restart all banned weapons programs as soon as multilateral sanctions against it had been dropped, with Hussein pursuing WMD proliferation in the future: &quot;There is an extensive, yet fragmentary and circumstantial, body of evidence suggesting that Saddam pursued a strategy to maintain a capability to return to WMD after sanctions were lifted...&quot; No senior Iraqi official interviewed by the ISG believed that Saddam had forsaken WMD forever.

On October 6, 2004, the head of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), Charles Duelfer, announced to the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee that the group found no evidence that Iraq under Saddam Hussein had produced and stockpiled any weapons of mass destruction since 1991, when UN sanctions were imposed.

After he began cooperating with U.S. forces in Baghdad in 2003, Dr. Mahdi Obeidi, who ran Saddam&#x27;s nuclear centrifuge program until 1997, handed over blueprints for a nuclear centrifuge along with some actual centrifuge components, stored at his home buried in the front yard awaiting orders from Baghdad to proceed. He said, &quot;I had to maintain the program to the bitter end.&quot; In his book &quot;The Bomb in My Garden: The Secrets of Saddam&#x27;s Nuclear Mastermind&quot;, the Iraqi nuclear engineer explains that his nuclear stash was the key that could have unlocked and restarted Saddam&#x27;s bombmaking program. However, it would require a massive investment and a re-creation of thousands of centrifuges in order to reconstitute a full centrifugal enrichment program.

In a January 26, 2004, interview with Tom Brokaw of NBC news, Kay described Iraq&#x27;s nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons programs as being in a &quot;rudimentary&quot; stage. He also stated that &quot;What we did find, and as others are investigating it, we found a lot of terrorist groups and individuals that passed through Iraq.&quot; In responding to a question by Brokaw as to whether Iraq was a &quot;gathering threat&quot; as President Bush had asserted before the invasion, Kay answered:

Tom, an imminent threat is a political judgment. It&#x27;s not a technical judgment. I think Baghdad was actually becoming more dangerous in the last two years than even we realized. Saddam was not controlling the society any longer. In the marketplace of terrorism and of WMD, Iraq well could have been that supplier if the war had not intervened.

In June 2004, the United States removed 2 tons of low-enriched uranium from Iraq, sufficient raw material for a single nuclear weapon.

Demetrius Perricos, then head of UNMOVIC, stated that the Kay report contained little information not already known by UNMOVIC. Many organizations, such as the journal &quot;Biosecurity and Bioterrorism&quot;, have claimed that Kay&#x27;s report is a &quot;worst case analysis&quot;.

====Captured documents====

Operation Iraqi Freedom documents refers to some 48,000 boxes of documents, audiotapes and videotapes that were captured by the U.S. military during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Many of these documents seem to make clear that Saddam&#x27;s regime had given up on seeking a WMD capability by the mid-1990s. Associated Press reported, &quot;Repeatedly in the transcripts, Saddam and his lieutenants remind each other that Iraq destroyed its chemical and biological weapons in the early 1990s, and shut down those programs and the nuclear-bomb program, which had never produced a weapon.&quot; At one 1996 presidential meeting, top weapons program official Amer Mohammed Rashid describes his conversation with UN weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus: &quot;We don&#x27;t have anything to hide, so we&#x27;re giving you all the details.&quot; At another meeting, Saddam told his deputies, &quot;We cooperated with the resolutions 100 percent and you all know that, and the 5 percent they claim we have not executed could take them 10 years to (verify). Don&#x27;t think for a minute that we still have WMD. We have nothing.&quot; U.S. Congressman Peter Hoekstra called for the U.S. government to put the remaining documents on the Internet so Arabic speakers around the world can help translate the documents.

====Post-war discoveries and incidents====

Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, several reported finds of chemical weapons were announced, including half a dozen incidents during the invasion itself.

In April 2003, US Marines stumbled across a number of buildings which emitted unusual levels of radiation. Upon close inspection the troops uncovered &quot;many, many drums&quot; containing low-grade uranium, also known as yellowcake. According to an expert familiar with UN nuclear inspections, US troops had arrived at the Tuwaitha Nuclear Research Center and the material under investigation had been documented, stored in sealed containers and subject to supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency since 1991. The material was transported out of Iraq in July 2008 and sold to Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp., in a transaction described as worth &quot;tens of millions of dollars.&quot;

A post-war case occurred on January 9, 2004, when Icelandic munitions experts and Danish military engineers discovered 36 120-mm mortar rounds containing liquid buried in Southern Iraq. While initial tests suggested that the rounds contained a blister agent, subsequent analysis by American and Danish experts showed that no chemical agent was present.

On May 2, 2004, a shell containing mustard gas was found in the middle of a street west of Baghdad. The Iraq Survey Group investigation reported that it had been previously &quot;stored improperly&quot;, and thus the gas was &quot;ineffective&quot; as a useful chemical agent. Officials from the Defense Department commented that they were not certain if use was to be made of the device as a bomb.

On May 16, 2004, a 152 mm artillery shell was used as an improvised bomb. The shell exploded and two U.S. soldiers were treated for minor exposure to a nerve agent (nausea and dilated pupils). On May 18 it was reported by U.S. Department of Defense intelligence officials that tests showed the two-chambered shell contained the chemical agent sarin, the shell being &quot;likely&quot; to have contained three to four liters of the substance (in the form of its two unmixed precursor chemicals prior to the aforementioned explosion that had not effectively mixed them). Former U.S. weapons inspector David Kay told the Associated Press that &quot;he doubted the shell or the nerve agent came from a hidden stockpile, although he didn&#x27;t rule out that possibility.&quot; Kay also considered it possible that the shell was &quot;an old relic overlooked when Saddam said he had destroyed such weapons in the mid-1990s.&quot; It is likely that the insurgents who planted the bomb did not know it contained sarin, according to Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmitt, and another U.S. official confirmed that the shell did not have the markings of a chemical agent. The Iraq Survey Group later concluded that the shell &quot;probably originated with a batch that was stored in Al Muthanna CW complex basement during the late 1980s for the purpose of leakage testing.&quot;

In a July 2, 2004, article published by The Associated Press and Fox News, it was reported that sarin gas warheads dating back to the last Iran–Iraq War were found in South Central Iraq by Polish Allies. The Polish troops secured munitions on June 23, 2004, but it turned out that the warheads did not in fact contain sarin gas but &quot;were all empty and tested negative for any type of chemicals&quot;—and it transpired that the Poles had bought the shells for $5,000 each.

In 2004, hundreds of chemical warheads were recovered from the desert close to the Iran–Iraq border. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the munitions &quot;had been buried near the Iranian border, and then long forgotten, by Iraqi troops during their eight-year war with Iran&quot;. Officials did not consider the discovery as evidence of an ongoing weapons program that was believed to be in existence before the invasion began.

The Iraqi government informed the United Nations in 2014 that insurgents affiliated with the Islamic State terror group had seized control of the Muthana State Establishment, including a chemical weapons depot northwest of Baghdad. The facility was partially destroyed and placed under the supervision of UNSCOM following the 1991 Gulf War. It housed some 2,500 sarin-filled rockets at the time of their departure in 1999. The U.N. said that the munitions were of &quot;poor quality&quot; and &quot;would largely be degraded after years of storage under the conditions existing there.&quot;

====2005: Operation Avarice====
In 2005, the CIA collaborated with the Army Intelligence Corps in contacting an unnamed Iraqi individual who had knowledge and possession of remnant chemical weapon stockpiles and munitions in Iraq dating to its abandoned weapons program. Foreign materials exploitation specialists from the 203rd Military Intelligence Battalion as well as chemical specialists and ordnance disposal units were assigned the task of aiding the destruction of recovered weapons; ultimately, at least 400 Borak rockets were acquired and destroyed.

It is unknown how the individual acquired their stockpile. Many of the weapons were badly degraded and were empty or held nonlethal liquid, but some of the weapons analyzed indicated a concentration of nerve agents far higher than military intelligence had initially expected given their age, with the highest &quot;agent purity of up to 25 percent for recovered unitary sarin weapons&quot;. At least once the undisclosed seller attempted to sell weapons with fake chemical components. In addition, he once &quot;called the intel guys to tell them he was going to turn them over to the insurgents unless they picked them up.&quot;

====2006: House Armed Services Committee Hearing====
On June 21, 2006, the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence released key points from a classified report provided to them by the National Ground Intelligence Center on the recovery of chemical weapons in Iraq. The declassified summary stated that &quot;Since 2003, coalition forces have recovered approximately 500 weapons munitions which contain degraded mustard or sarin nerve agent&quot;, that chemical munitions &quot;are assessed to still exist&quot; and that they &quot;could be sold on the black market&quot;. All weapons were thought to be manufactured in the 1980s and date to Iraq&#x27;s war with Iran. The report prompted US Senator Rick Santorum to hold a press conference in which he declared &quot;We have found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.&quot;

During a House Armed Services Committee meeting convened to discuss the topic, the center&#x27;s commander, Army Colonel John Chiu, elaborated that the munitions are &quot;badly corroded in most cases [and] some were deliberately dismantled, if you will, to prevent them from being used.&quot; Nonetheless, in response to a question from committee member Rep. Curt Weldon (R-Pennsylvania), Col. Chui agreed that the munitions met the technical definition of weapons of mass destruction. &quot;These are chemical weapons as defined under the Chemical Weapons Convention and yes, sir, they do constitute weapons of mass destruction.&quot; Weapons expert David Kay, who also appeared before the committee, disagreed with the assessment, contending that any chemical weapon produced by Iraq in the 1980s would not remain a viable weapon of mass destruction today. Kay said the chemical agent, though hazardous, is &quot;less toxic than most things Americans have under their kitchen sink at this point&quot;. Speaking on National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot;, weapons expert Charles Duelfer agreed with Kay, saying: &quot;We said in the [ISG] report that such chemical munitions would probably still be found. But the ones which have been found are left over from the Iran-Iraq war. They are almost 20 years old, and they are in a decayed fashion. It is very interesting that there are so many that were unaccounted for, but they do not constitute a weapon of mass destruction, although they could be a local hazard.

In September of the same year, the report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on &quot;Postwar Findings&quot; stated that such discoveries were consistent with the ISG assessment that &quot;Iraq and Coalition Forces will continue to discover small numbers of degraded chemical weapons, which the former Regime mislaid or improperly destroyed prior to 1991. The ISG believes the bulk of these weapons were likely abandoned, forgotten and lost during the Iran-Iraq war because tens of thousands of CW munitions were forward deployed along the frequently and rapidly shifting battle front.&quot;

====WMD looting and &quot;The New York Times&quot; investigative report====
In October 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the total number of munitions discovered since 2003 had climbed to 4,990, and that U.S. servicemen had been exposed and injured during the disposal and destruction process. US soldiers reporting exposure to mustard gas and sarin allege they were required to keep their exposure secret, sometimes declined admission to hospital and evacuation home despite the request of their commanders. &quot;We were absolutely told not to talk about it&quot; by a colonel, a former sergeant said. &quot;All [munitions] had been manufactured before 1991, participants said. Filthy, rusty or corroded, a large fraction of them could not be readily identified as chemical weapons at all. Some were empty, though many of them still contained potent mustard agent or residual sarin. Most could not have been used as designed, and when they ruptured dispersed the chemical agents over a limited area.&quot;

According to the investigative report, &quot;many chemical weapons incidents clustered around the ruins of the Muthanna State Establishment, the center of Iraqi chemical agent production in the 1980s.&quot; The facility had fallen under the supervision of United Nations weapons inspectors after the first Gulf War and was known to house approximately 2,500 corroded chemical munitions, but the vast building complex was left unmanned once hostilities commenced in 2003 and was subject to looting. Participants in the discoveries postulated another reason to conceal their exposure, as some of the chemical shells &quot;appeared to have been designed in the United States, manufactured in Europe and filled in chemical agent production lines built in Iraq by Western companies.&quot;

UN inspectors had to evacuate Iraq when hostilities began, and continued to monitor the 411 examined sites remotely to the degree possible. In 2005, they returned to find 90 of 353 sites had been either looted or razed.

===2009 Declaration===
Iraq became a member state of the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2009, declaring &quot;two bunkers with filled and unfilled chemical weapons munitions, some precursors, as well as five former chemical weapons production facilities&quot; according to OPCW Director General Rogelio Pfirter. No plans were announced at that time for the destruction of the material, although it was noted that the bunkers were damaged in the 2003 war and even inspection of the site must be carefully planned.

The declaration contained no surprises, OPCW spokesman Michael Luhan indicated. The production facilities were &quot;put out of commission&quot; by airstrikes during the 1991 conflict, while United Nations personnel afterward secured the chemical munitions in the bunkers. Luhan stated at the time: &quot;These are legacy weapons, remnants.&quot; He declined to discuss how many weapons were stored in the bunkers or what materials they contained. The weapons were not believed to be in a usable state.

The destruction of these remnants was completed in 2018.

== Public perception ==

In a study published in 2005, a group of researchers assessed the effects reports and retractions in the media had on people&#x27;s memory regarding the search for WMD in Iraq during the 2003 Iraq War. The study focused on populations in two coalition countries (Australia and USA) and one opposed to the war (Germany). This led to three conclusions:
# &quot;The repetition of tentative news stories, even if they are subsequently disconfirmed, can assist in the creation of false memories in a substantial proportion of people.&quot;
# &quot;Once information is published, its subsequent correction does not alter people&#x27;s beliefs unless they are suspicious about the motives underlying the events the news stories are about.&quot;
# &quot;When people ignore corrections, they do so irrespective of how certain they are that the corrections occurred.&quot;

A poll conducted between June and September 2003 asked people whether they thought evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq. They were also asked which media sources they relied upon. Those who obtained their news primarily from Fox News were three times as likely to believe that evidence of WMD had been discovered in Iraq than those who relied on PBS and NPR for their news, and one-third more likely than those who primarily watched CBS.
Based on a series of polls taken from June–September 2003.

distinct types of tissue that originated from the same zygote but differ due to mutation during ordinary cell division.

Normally, genetic chimerism is not visible on casual inspection; however, it has been detected in the course of proving parentage. More practically, in agronomy Chimera indicates a plant or portion of a plant whose tissues are made up of two or more types of cells with different genetic makeup; it can derive from a bud mutation or, more rarely, at the grafting point, from the concrescence of cells of the two bionts; in this case it is commonly referred to as a &quot;graft hybrid&quot;, although it is not a hybrid in the genetic sense of &quot;hybrid&quot;.

In contrast, an individual where each cell contains genetic material from two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera is called a hybrid.

Another way that chimerism can occur in animals is by organ transplantation, giving one individual tissues that developed from a different genome. For example, transplantation of bone marrow often determines the recipient&#x27;s ensuing blood type.

==Classifications==

===Natural chimerism===

Some level of chimerism occurs naturally in the wild in many animal species, and in some cases may be a required (obligate) part of their life cycle. 

==== Symbiotic chimerism in anglerfish ====
Chimerism occurs naturally in adult Ceratioid anglerfish and is in fact a natural and essential part of their life cycle. Once the male achieves adulthood, it begins its search for a female. Using strong olfactory (or smell) receptors, the male searches until it locates a female anglerfish. The male, less than an inch in length, bites into her skin and releases an enzyme that digests the skin of both his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. While this attachment has become necessary for the male&#x27;s survival, it will eventually consume him, as both anglerfish fuse into a single hermaphroditic individual. Sometimes in this process, more than one male will attach to a single female as a symbiote. In this case, they will all be consumed into the body of the larger female angler. Once fused to a female, the males will reach sexual maturity, developing large testicles as their other organs atrophy. This process allows for sperm to be in constant supply when the female produces an egg, so that the chimeric fish is able to have a greater number of offspring.

==== Sponges ====
Chimerism has been found in some species of marine sponges. Four distinct genotypes have been found in a single individual, and there is potential for even greater genetic heterogeneity. Each genotype functions independently in terms of reproduction, but the different intra-organism genotypes behave as a single large individual in terms of ecological responses like growth.

==== In obligates ====
It has been shown that male yellow crazy ants are obligate chimeras, the first known such case. In this species, the queens have arisen from fertilized eggs with a genotype of RR (Reproductive × Reproductive), the sterile female workers show a RW arrangement (Reproductive × Worker), and the males instead of being haploid, as is usually the case for ants, also display a RW genotype, but for them the egg R and the sperm W do not fuse so they develop as a chimera with some cells carrying an R and others carrying a W genome.

===Artificial chimerism ===
Artificial chimerism refers to examples of chimerism that are accidentally produced by humans, either for research or commercial purposes. 

====Tetragametic chimerism====
Tetragametic chimerism is a form of congenital chimerism. This condition occurs through fertilizing two separate ova by two sperm, followed by aggregation of the two at the blastocyst or zygote stages. This results in the development of an organism with intermingled cell lines. Put another way, the chimera is formed from the merging of two nonidentical twins. As such, they can be male, female, or intersex. 

The tetragametic state has important implications for organ or stem cell transplantation. Chimeras typically have immunologic tolerance to both cell lines.

====Microchimerism====
Microchimerism is the presence of a small number of cells that are genetically distinct from those of the host individual. Most people are born with a few cells genetically identical to their mothers&#x27; and the proportion of these cells goes down in healthy individuals as they get older. People who retain higher numbers of cells genetically identical to their mother&#x27;s have been observed to have higher rates of some autoimmune diseases, presumably because the immune system is responsible for destroying these cells and a common immune defect prevents it from doing so and also causes autoimmune problems.

The higher rates of autoimmune diseases due to the presence of maternally-derived cells is why in a 2010 study of a 40-year-old man with scleroderma-like disease (an autoimmune rheumatic disease), the female cells detected in his blood stream via FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) were thought to be maternally-derived. However, his form of microchimerism was found to be due to a vanished twin, and it is unknown whether microchimerism from a vanished twin might predispose individuals to autoimmune diseases as well. Mothers often also have a few cells genetically identical to those of their children, and some people also have some cells genetically identical to those of their siblings (maternal siblings only, since these cells are passed to them because their mother retained them).

====Germline chimerism====
Germline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, sperm and egg cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own. It has been recently discovered that marmosets can carry the reproductive cells of their (fraternal) twin siblings due to placental fusion during development. (Marmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.)

==Types==

===Animals===

As the organism develops, it can come to possess organs that have different sets of chromosomes. For example, the chimera may have a liver composed of cells with one set of chromosomes and have a kidney composed of cells with a second set of chromosomes. This has occurred in humans, and at one time was thought to be extremely rare although more recent evidence suggests that this is not the case.

This is particularly true for the marmoset. Recent research shows most marmosets are chimeras, sharing DNA with their fraternal twins. 95% of marmoset fraternal twins trade blood through chorionic fusions, making them hematopoietic chimeras.

In the budgerigar, due to the many existing plumage colour variations, tetragametic chimeras can be very conspicuous, as the resulting bird will have an obvious split between two colour types often divided bilaterally down the centre. These individuals are known as half-sider budgerigars.

An animal chimera is a single organism that is composed of two or more different populations of genetically distinct cells that originated from different zygotes involved in sexual reproduction. If the different cells have emerged from the same zygote, the organism is called a mosaic. Innate chimeras are formed from at least four parent cells (two fertilised eggs or early embryos fused together). Each population of cells keeps its own character and the resulting organism is a mixture of tissues. Cases of human chimeras have been documented.

====Chimerism in humans====
Some consider mosaicism to be a form of chimerism, while others consider them to be distinct. Mosaicism involves a mutation of the genetic material in a cell, giving rise to a subset of cells that are different from the rest. Natural chimerism is the fusion of more than one fertilized zygote in the early stages of prenatal development. It is much rarer than mosaicism.

In artificial chimerism, an individual has one cell lineage that was inherited genetically at the time of the formation of the human embryo and the other that was introduced through a procedure, including organ transplantation or blood transfusion. Specific types of transplants that could induce this condition include bone marrow transplants and organ transplants, as the recipient&#x27;s body essentially works to permanently incorporate the new blood stem cells into it.

Boklage argues that many human &#x27;mosaic&#x27; cell lines will be &quot;found to be chimeric if properly tested&quot;.

In contrast, a human where each cell contains genetic material from two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera is called a human–animal hybrid.

While German dermatologist Alfred Blaschko described Blaschko&#x27;s lines in 1901, the genetic science took until the 1930s to approach a vocabulary for the phenomenon. The term &quot;genetic chimera&quot; has been used at least since the 1944 article of Belgovskii.

This condition is either innate or it is synthetic, acquired for example through the infusion of allogeneic blood cells during transplantation or transfusion.

In nonidentical twins, innate chimerism occurs by means of blood vessel anastomoses. The likelihood of offspring being a chimera is increased if it is created via in vitro fertilisation. Chimeras can often breed, but the fertility and type of offspring depend on which cell line gave rise to the ovaries or testes; varying degrees of intersex differences may result if one set of cells is genetically female and another genetically male.

On January 22, 2019, the National Society of Genetic Counselors released an article &quot;Chimerism Explained: How One Person Can Unknowingly Have Two Sets of DNA&quot;, where they state, &quot;where a twin pregnancy evolves into one child, is currently believed to be one of the rarer forms. However, we know that 20 to 30% of singleton pregnancies were originally a twin or a multiple pregnancy&quot;.

Most human chimeras will go through life without realizing they are chimeras. The difference in phenotypes may be subtle (e.g., having a hitchhiker&#x27;s thumb and a straight thumb, eyes of slightly different colors, differential hair growth on opposite sides of the body, etc.) or completely undetectable. Chimeras may also show, under a certain spectrum of UV light, distinctive marks on the back resembling that of arrow points pointing downward from the shoulders down to the lower back; this is one expression of pigment unevenness called Blaschko&#x27;s lines.

Another case was that of Karen Keegan, who was also suspected (initially) of not being her children&#x27;s biological mother, after DNA tests on her adult sons for a kidney transplant she needed, seemed to show she was not their mother.

===Plants===
====Structure====
The distinction between sectorial, mericlinal and periclinal plant chimeras is widely used. Periclinal chimeras involve a genetic difference that persists in the descendant cells of a particular meristem layer. This type of chimera is more stable than mericlinal or sectoral mutations that affect only later generations of cells.

====Graft chimeras====


These are produced by grafting genetically different parents, different cultivars or different species (which may belong to different genera). The tissues may be partially fused together following grafting to form a single growing organism that preserves both types of tissue in a single shoot. Just as the constituent species are likely to differ in a wide range of features, so the behavior of their periclinal chimeras is like to be highly variable. The first such known chimera was probably the Bizzarria, which is a fusion of the Florentine citron and the sour orange. Well-known examples of a graft-chimera are &quot;Laburnocytisus&quot; &#x27;Adamii&#x27;, caused by a fusion of a &quot;Laburnum&quot; and a broom, and &quot;Family&quot; trees, where multiple varieties of apple or pear are grafted onto the same tree. Many fruit trees are cultivated by grafting the body of a sapling onto a rootstock.

====Chromosomal chimeras====
These are chimeras in which the layers differ in their chromosome constitution. Occasionally, chimeras arise from loss or gain of individual chromosomes or chromosome fragments owing to misdivision. More commonly cytochimeras have simple multiple of the normal chromosome complement in the changed layer. There are various effects on cell size and growth characteristics.

====Nuclear gene-differential chimeras====
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a nuclear gene to a dominant or recessive allele. As a rule, one character is affected at a time in the leaf, flower, fruit, or other parts.

====Plastid gene-differential chimeras====
These chimeras arise by spontaneous or induced mutation of a plastid gene, followed by the sorting-out of two kinds of plastid during vegetative growth. Alternatively, after selfing or nucleic acid thermodynamics, plastids may sort-out from a mixed egg or mixed zygote respectively. This type of chimera is recognized at the time of origin by the sorting-out pattern in the leaves. After sorting-out is complete, periclinal chimeras are distinguished from similar looking nuclear gene-differential chimeras by their non-mendelian inheritance. The majority of variegated-leaf chimeras are of this kind.

All plastid gene- and some nuclear gene-differential chimeras affect the color of the plasmids within the leaves, and these are grouped together as chlorophyll chimeras, or preferably as variegated leaf chimeras. For most variegation, the mutation involved is the loss of the chloroplasts in the mutated tissue, so that part of the plant tissue has no green pigment and no photosynthetic ability. This mutated tissue is unable to survive on its own, but it is kept alive by its partnership with normal photosynthetic tissue. Sometimes chimeras are also found with layers differing in respect of both their nuclear and their plastid genes.

====Origins====
There are multiple reasons to explain the occurrence of plant chimera during the plant recovery stage:

# The process of shoot organogenesis starts from the multicellular origin.
# The endogenous tolerance leads to the ineffectiveness of the weak selective agents.
# A self-protection mechanism (cross protection). Transformed cells serve as guards to protect the untransformed ones.
# The observable characteristic of transgenic cells may be a transient expression of the marker gene. Or it may due to the presence of agrobacterium cells.

=====Detection=====
Untransformed cells should be easy to detect and remove to avoid chimeras. This is because it is important to maintain the stable ability of the transgenic plants across different generations. Reporter genes such as GUS and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) are used in combination with plant selective markers (herbicide, antibody etc.). However, GUS expression depends on the plant development stage and GFP may be influenced by the green tissue autofluorescence. Quantitative PCR could be an alternative method for chimera detection.

===Viruses===

In 2012, the first example of a naturally-occurring RNA-DNA hybrid virus was unexpectedly discovered during a metagenomic study of the acidic extreme environment of Boiling Springs Lake that is in Lassen Volcanic National Park, California. The virus was named BSL-RDHV (Boiling Springs Lake RNA DNA Hybrid Virus). Its genome is related to a DNA circovirus, which usually infects birds and pigs, and a RNA tombusvirus, which infect plants. The study surprised scientists, because DNA and RNA viruses vary and the way the chimera came together was not understood.

Other viral chimeras have also been found, and the group is known as the CHIV viruses (&quot;chimeric viruses&quot;).

==Research==
The first known primate chimeras are the rhesus monkey twins, Roku and Hex, each having six genomes. They were created by mixing cells from totipotent four-cell morulas; although the cells never fused, they worked together to form organs. It was discovered that one of these primates, Roku, was a sexual chimera; as four percent of Roku&#x27;s blood cells contained two x chromosomes.

A major milestone in chimera experimentation occurred in 1984 when a chimeric sheep–goat was produced by combining embryos from a goat and a sheep, and survived to adulthood.

To research the developmental biology of the bird embryo, researchers produced artificial quail-chick chimeras in 1987. By using transplantation and ablation in the chick embryo stage, the neural tube and the neural crest cells of the chick were ablated, and replaced with the same parts from a quail. Once hatched, the quail feathers were visibly apparent around the wing area, whereas the rest of the chick&#x27;s body was made of its own chicken cells.

In August 2003, researchers at the Shanghai Second Medical University in China reported that they had successfully fused human skin cells and rabbit ova to create the first human chimeric embryos. The embryos were allowed to develop for several days in a laboratory setting, and then destroyed to harvest the resulting stem cells. In 2007, scientists at the University of Nevada School of Medicine created a sheep whose blood contained 15% human cells and 85% sheep cells.

In 2023 a study reported the first chimeric monkey using embryonic stem cell lines, it was the only live birth from 12 pregnancies resulting from 40 implanted embryos of the crab-eating macaque, an average of 67% and a highest of 92% of the cells across the 26 tested tissues were descendants of the donor stem cells against 0.1–4.5% from previous experiments on chimeric monkeys.

===Work with mice===
Chimeric mice are important animals in biological research, as they allow for the investigation of a variety of biological questions in an animal that has two distinct genetic pools within it. These include insights into problems such as the tissue specific requirements of a gene, cell lineage, and cell potential.

The general methods for creating chimeric mice can be summarized either by injection or aggregation of embryonic cells from different origins. The first chimeric mouse was made by Beatrice Mintz in the 1960s through the aggregation of eight-cell-stage embryos. Injection on the other hand was pioneered by Richard Gardner and Ralph Brinster who injected cells into blastocysts to create chimeric mice with germ lines fully derived from injected embryonic stem cells (ES cells). Chimeras can be derived from mouse embryos that have not yet implanted in the uterus as well as from implanted embryos. ES cells from the inner cell mass of an implanted blastocyst can contribute to all cell lineages of a mouse including the germ line. ES cells are a useful tool in chimeras because genes can be mutated in them through the use of homologous recombination, thus allowing gene targeting. Since this discovery occurred in 1988, ES cells have become a key tool in the generation of specific chimeric mice.

====Underlying biology====
The ability to make mouse chimeras comes from an understanding of early mouse development. Between the stages of fertilization of the egg and the implantation of a blastocyst into the uterus, different parts of the mouse embryo retain the ability to give rise to a variety of cell lineages. Once the embryo has reached the blastocyst stage, it is composed of several parts, mainly the trophectoderm, the inner cell mass, and the primitive endoderm. Each of these parts of the blastocyst gives rise to different parts of the embryo; the inner cell mass gives rise to the embryo proper, while the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm give rise to extra embryonic structures that support growth of the embryo. Two- to eight-cell-stage embryos are competent for making chimeras, since at these stages of development, the cells in the embryos are not yet committed to give rise to any particular cell lineage, and could give rise to the inner cell mass or the trophectoderm. In the case where two diploid eight-cell-stage embryos are used to make a chimera, chimerism can be later found in the epiblast, primitive endoderm, and trophectoderm of the mouse blastocyst.

It is possible to dissect the embryo at other stages so as to accordingly give rise to one lineage of cells from an embryo selectively and not the other. For example, subsets of blastomeres can be used to give rise to chimera with specified cell lineage from one embryo. The Inner Cell Mass of a diploid blastocyst, for example, can be used to make a chimera with another blastocyst of eight-cell diploid embryo; the cells taken from the inner cell mass will give rise to the primitive endoderm and to the epiblast in the chimera mouse.
From this knowledge, ES cell contributions to chimeras have been developed. ES cells can be used in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can be further genetically altered to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.

====Methods of production====
There are a variety of combinations that can give rise to a successful chimera mouse and according to the goal of the experiment an appropriate cell and embryo combination can be picked; they are generally but not limited to diploid embryo and ES cells, diploid embryo and diploid embryo, ES cell and tetraploid embryo, diploid embryo and tetraploid embryo, ES cells and ES cells. The combination of embryonic stem cell and diploid embryo is a common technique used for the making of chimeric mice, since gene targeting can be done in the embryonic stem cell. These kinds of chimeras can be made through either aggregation of stem cells and the diploid embryo or injection of the stem cells into the diploid embryo. If embryonic stem cells are to be used for gene targeting to make a chimera, the following procedure is common: a construct for homologous recombination for the gene targeted will be introduced into cultured mouse embryonic stem cells from the donor mouse, by way of electroporation; cells positive for the recombination event will have antibiotic resistance, provided by the insertion cassette used in the gene targeting; and be able to be positively selected for. ES cells with the correct targeted gene are then injected into a diploid host mouse blastocyst. Then, these injected blastocysts are implanted into a pseudo pregnant female surrogate mouse, which will bring the embryos to term and give birth to a mouse whose germline is derived from the donor mouse&#x27;s ES cells. This same procedure can be achieved through aggregation of ES cells and diploid embryos, diploid embryos are cultured in aggregation plates in wells where single embryos can fit, to these wells ES cells are added the aggregates are cultured until a single embryo is formed and has progressed to the blastocyst stage, and can then be transferred to the surrogate mouse.

==Ethics and legislation==
The US and Western Europe have strict codes of ethics and regulations in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, though there is a vast difference in the regulatory framework. Through the creation of human chimeras comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is genetically altered to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and human. Legal debate would be the next step in the process to determine whether certain chimeras should be granted legal rights. Along with issues regarding the rights of chimeras, individuals have expressed concern about whether or not creating human chimeras diminishes the &quot;dignity&quot; of being human.

<doc id="155199" wikidata="Q932411" url="?curid=155199" title="Brunel University of London">
<text>Brunel University of London (BUL) is a public research university located in the Uxbridge area of London, England. It is named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a Victorian engineer and pioneer of the Industrial Revolution. It became a university in June 1966, when Brunel College of Advanced Technology was awarded a royal charter and became Brunel University; it is sometimes considered a plate glass university.

In 2014 the university formally adopted the name Brunel University London, and in 2024 became the University of London&#x27;s 17th member, adopting the trading name Brunel University of London. Since 2014 the university has been organised into three colleges: the College of Business, Arts and Social Sciences; the College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences; and the College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences.

Brunel has over 16,000 students and 2,200 staff, and an annual income of £271.3 million (2021–22), of which £22.4 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £311.9 million. The university won the Queen&#x27;s Anniversary Prize in 2011. BUL is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the European University Association, and Universities UK.

==History==

===Origins===
Brunel University of London is one of a number of British universities which were established in the 1960s following the Robbins Report on higher education. It is sometimes described as a &quot;plate glass university&quot;. The university&#x27;s origins lie in Acton Technical College, which was split into two in 1957: Acton Technical College continued to cater for technicians and craftsmen, and the new Brunel College of Technology (named after Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the British engineer) was dedicated to the education of chartered engineers.

The campus buildings, including the lecture centre, were designed in the Brutalist style of architecture by Richard Sheppard, Robson &amp; Partners, Architects.

In 1960 Brunel College of Technology was awarded the status of College of Advanced Technology, and it was decided that it should expand at another site in order to accommodate the extra buildings that would be needed. Uxbridge was chosen to house the new buildings. Before construction work began the college was officially renamed Brunel College of Advanced Technology in 1962 – the tenth Advanced Technology College in the country, and the last to be awarded this title.

The Uxbridge (Vine Street) railway branch line was closed in 1964, and the college purchased the land adjacent to its site where the railway had run for £65,000 from the local council.

===1966 to present===
A royal charter granting university status and the power to award degrees was awarded on 9 June 1966, and the institution became Brunel University. 

The university continued to use both campuses until 1971, when it left the Acton site. In 1980, the university merged with Shoreditch College of Education (Shoreditch Training College), located at Cooper&#x27;s Hill, Runnymede, which became Brunel&#x27;s second campus.

In 1995, the university expanded again, integrating the West London Institute of Higher Education, and adding campuses in Osterley and Twickenham, and increasing the number of courses that the university was able to offer. Traditionally the university&#x27;s strengths were in engineering, science, and technology, but with the addition of the West London Institute, new departments such as arts, humanities, geography and earth science, health and sports science were added, and the size of the student body increased to over 12,000.

Brunel has been the subject of controversy as its approach to higher education has been both market-driven and politically conservative. The decision to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher in 1996, following the University of Oxford&#x27;s refusal to do so, provoked an outcry by staff and students and, as a result, the ceremony had to be held in the House of Lords instead of on campus. In the late 1990s, the departments of physics, chemistry and materials engineering were all closed and, in 2004, the then vice-chancellor, Steven Schwartz, initiated the reorganisation of the university&#x27;s faculties and departments into schools, and closed the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences. The succeeding vice-chancellor, the sociologist Christopher Jenks, took office in 2006. He was followed by Julia Buckingham, previously at Imperial College London, who took up the position of vice-chancellor at Brunel in 2012.

In 2014, the university underwent an internal reorganisation and its name was changed to Brunel University London (BUL) by a supplemental charter dated 16 July 2014. In 2016 Brunel celebrated its 50th anniversary since being awarded its royal charter, and staged a 14-month programme of more than 40 celebratory events.

In December 2020, the university&#x27;s chancellor, Sir Richard Sykes, lead an independent review of the UK&#x27;s Vaccine Taskforce strategy and goals, and in June 2021 he was subsequently appointed as the taskforce&#x27;s new chair, leading work to find, procure and deliver vaccines and oversee preparations for vaccine booster programmes as part of UK&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccination programme.

In April 2021, it was announced that Julia Buckingham would be stepping down as vice-chancellor and president after nearly 10 years in the role. She was succeeded by Andrew Jones, who took up the position in January 2022.

Brunel became part of the University of London in October 2024, and began using the name Brunel University of London (BUL) as a trading name.

==Campus==

In the late 1990s Brunel devised a 10-year, £250 million masterplan for the campus. This involved selling off campus sites at Runnymede, Osterley and Twickenham and using the revenue from the sales to renovate and update the buildings and facilities on the Uxbridge campus. Works carried out included a library extension, a state-of-the-art sports complex, renovated students&#x27; union facilities, a new Health Sciences teaching centre, and the construction of more halls of residence.

The original Brunel campus was designed by Richard Sheppard, Robson and Partners, with many buildings retaining the 1960s &#x27;Brutalist&#x27; architectural style. It has appeared in several films, most famously in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, large parts of which were filmed on campus, particularly in the John Crank Building (demolished July 2019) and the Grade II listed Lecture Centre. It has also featured in several UK television series including &quot;Spooks&quot;, &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, &quot;The Sweeney&quot; and &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;.

==Organisation and governance==

===Colleges===
Brunel has three constituent Academic Colleges:

;College of Engineering, Design and Physical Sciences 
;College of Business, Arts and Social Sciences 
;College of Health, Medicine and Life Sciences 
===Research institutes===
Research at Brunel has been organised into five institutes 
*Institute of Communities and Society
*Institute of Digital Futures
*Institute of Energy Futures
*Institute of Health, Medicine and Environments
*Institute of Materials and Manufacturing

===Governance===
Brunel exists by virtue of a royal charter first granted in 1966 and it has the status of an exempt charity as defined by the Charities Act 2011.

The governing body of Brunel is the council, which comprises university staff and students and independent members. The Council appoints the Vice-Chancellor and other senior officers. The council has established a number of Committees which support its work.

The current Chancellor of the university is Sir Richard Sykes, a biochemist and former Rector of Imperial College London. The Vice-Chancellor since 2022 is Professor Andrew Jones, formerly Deputy President at City, University of London.

Brunel&#x27;s academic governing body is the Senate, which is chaired by the Vice-Chancellor. The Senate&#x27;s powers, duties and functions are set out in its Ordinances, and it has a number of Committees which support its work.

===Finances===
In the financial year ended 31 July 2020, Brunel had a total income (including share of joint ventures) of £237.1 million (2018–19 – £229.8 million) and total expenditure of £235.7 million (2018–19 – £224.7 million).

Total income for 2019–20 was £237.1 million, £7.3 million (3.2%) higher than in 2018–19. Tuition fees overall increased by £10.1 million, reflecting the increase in the number of students enrolled, while funding body grants were flat at £30.6 million. Research grant income for 2019/ 20 was £3.1 million higher than in 2018–19 on a recognised income basis. Research income reflects the timing of work undertaken on research grants, as income is recognised in the financial statements over a period typically averaging three years. Other income reduced by £6.0 million, or 12.4%. This consists of student residences income, conference, hotel, retail and also income from summer school activity for foreign language students on the campus. All categories were significantly impacted by the pandemic, including the decision by the university not to charge rent for accommodation for the final term.

Excluding the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension revaluation, expenditure was £9.8 million (4.3%) higher than in 2018–19. Excluding pension adjustments, staff costs of £135.0 million were £15.5 million (13.0%) higher than in 2018–19. The university invested resources in its academic provision as its tuition fee income and student numbers have increased and has also targeted staff cost investment in its information technology provision and other support services. Other operating expenses of £76.9 million were £5.6 million lower than in 2018–19.
===Coat of arms===

The Brunel coat of arms was granted to the university in 1966, and incorporates various images representative of the university&#x27;s heritage and principles. The masonry arch symbolises Isambard Kingdom Brunel, after whom the university is named; the compass and cogwheel symbolise technology, on which the university initially focussed on and the institution&#x27;s former status as a College of Advanced Technology; the ermine lozenge is an allusion to the arms of Lord Halsbury, the first Chancellor of the university; and the swan symbolises Uxbridge, where the main campus is located.

==Academic profile==
Brunel students have access to specialist laboratories for electronic imaging, bioprocessing and experimental techniques; flight, driving and train simulators; a 3-D body scanner; an MRI scanner; motion-capture equipment; an occupational therapy suite; sports and performing arts facilities; and academic archives in cult film and contemporary writing.

Depending on the degree course followed, many undergraduate students may choose to undertake practical placements and projects as an integral part of their courses (a founding principle of the sandwich degree structure).

===Research===
In the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), 90% of Brunel research submitted was rated as being of international quality. In the Research Excellence Framework (REF) in 2014 Brunel was ranked 33rd for Research Power.

A comparison of the data submitted to REF2021 compared to the submission for REF2014 demonstrates a 9.6% increase of staff Full-time equivalent (FTE) submitted, a 5.9% increase in Early Career Researchers, 22% increase in PhD graduation per staff (FTE) per year and a 55% increase in spend per staff (FTE) per year.

Courses at Brunel draw on staff&#x27;s research in areas including Law, Cancer Genetics, Environmental Science, Human-Centred Design, Materials Processing, Contemporary Music and Digital Performance, Children&#x27;s Education and Sports Medicine.

===&#x27;Made in Brunel&#x27; (annual design exhibition)===
Brunel&#x27;s Design School holds an annual design exhibition called Made In Brunel, to promote and showcase the work of final year students to the design industry. In past years it has been held at the Business Design Centre in Islington, and the Oxo Tower Wharf. From 2011 onwards the exhibition has been held at the Bargehouse, on the Southbank, London.

==Student life==

===Student recreational and general facilities===
Brunel has a gym, spa, and running track with professional training and medical facilities. On campus there is also a pharmacy, a shop, one bar called Locos, a nightclub called Venue, and a café named &quot;1966&quot; after the year of the university&#x27;s founding. Historically Brunel Student Hall and The Sports Barn were key venues for band tours in the 1970-90&#x27;s with some of the biggest names in rock music including, Fairport Convention, Fleetwood Mac, The Who, Deep Purple, Genesis, ELO, The Kinks, Thin Lizzy, Joy Division, The Pretenders, The Specials, The Stone Roses. The Sex Pistols played the first gig of their &#x27;Never Mind the Bans Tour&#x27; at Brunel on 16 December 1977.

The Bannerman Centre at the heart of the campus contains a 4 floor library (opened in 1973 by Heinrich Böll) with c.400,000 books and 1,500 study spaces, usually open 24/7 during term-time. The Bannerman Annexe contains the Professional Development (Careers) Centre, PC labs, large teaching rooms with collaborative technology and various student service functions such as the Assistive Technology Centre.

===Union of Brunel Students===
The Union of Brunel Students is the students&#x27; union of Brunel University. The Union is based within the Hamilton Centre on the Uxbridge campus.

Among other services, the Union runs two venues on the Brunel campus: the Venue nightclub, Loco&#x27;s bar.

The Union is led by fourteen democratically elected staff from the student body – six Student Officers, four Standing Committee Chairs and six Working Group Chairs – supported by over thirty professional staff.

===&quot;The Brunel Times &amp; Hillingdon Herald&quot;===
&quot;The Brunel Times&quot; is Brunel University&#x27;s official student newspaper. Before 2019, it was called &quot;Le Nurb&quot;, which has &quot;Brunel&quot; spelt backwards. Before that, it was a magazine called Route 66, named after the different campus locations Runneymede, Osterley, Uxbridge and Twickenham, not after a bus route which supposedly ran through Brunel&#x27;s campus along Cleveland Road. The newspaper editorial team is made up of volunteer students and is funded by the Union of Brunel Students. Traditionally, the newspaper has held a left-wing bias and has published interviews with prominent political figures including Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, a Brunel alum and MP for Hayes and Harlington.

&quot;Hillingdon Herald&quot; is a monthly newspaper, written and produced by students from Brunel University London, with a focus on the London Borough of Hillingdon and wider London. Launched in October 2021, the first issue included columns from Prime Minister Boris Johnson, MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip; former Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell; and David Simmonds, MP for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner.

===Formula Student===
Brunel was one of the first UK universities to enter the Formula Student engineering competition, an annual event in which universities from around the world compete in static and dynamic events using formula style racing cars designed and manufactured by students. Brunel&#x27;s Formula Student teams have won prizes in the annual competition every year since they first entered in 1999.

The Brunel Racing team is composed of undergraduate and postgraduate students, each being allocated an area of the car to develop. Students on MEng Mechanical Engineering courses act as team leaders and manage BEng students throughout the year to ensure a successful completion of a new car each year. Brunel Racing were UK Class 1 Formula Student Champions in 2002, and were the leading UK team at Formula ATA 2005, the Italian Formula Student event. In 2006 Formula Student Event, Brunel Racing were also the highest finishing UK competitor using E85 (fuel composed of 85% ethanol and 15% petrol.)

===Student housing===
Brunel&#x27;s £250 million campus redevelopment programme, completed in 2008, refurbished existing halls and the built the new Isambard Complex. There are 34 self-catering halls of residence on-campus, with a total of 4,549 rooms, including studio flats for co-habiting couples. Rooms are available for undergraduates, postgraduates, students with disabilities and co habiting couples. All rooms have network access.

Many of the halls of residence around the Uxbridge campus are named after bridges that Isambard Kingdom Brunel either built or helped to design; other halls are named after him or other notable engineers or scientists. For example:
*Clifton Hall (after the Clifton Suspension Bridge)
*Saltash Hall (after the Royal Albert Bridge that crosses the River Tamar at Saltash)
*Chepstow Hall (after the bridge across the River Wye at Chepstow)
*Fleming Hall (after Sir Alexander Fleming)
*Faraday Hall (after Sir Michael Faraday)
*Galbraith Hall (after W R Galbraith, who designed the Kew Railway Bridge)
*Mill Hall (after John Stuart Mill)

There are also three accommodation complexes: the Bishop Complex (Bishop, Kilmorey, Lacy and St Margaret&#x27;s Halls); the Lancaster Complex (Lancaster, Stockwell, Southwark, Borough Road, Maria Grey and Gordon Halls); and the Isambard Complex (North, Meadow, Michael Bevis, Concourse, Stephen Bragg, West, Maurice Kogan, David Neave, Central, East, Runnymede, George Shipp, Trevor Slater, Shoreditch, Syd Urry, South and Brian Winstanley Halls).

<text>Female ejaculation is characterized as an expulsion of fluid from the Skene&#x27;s gland at the lower end of the urethra during or before an orgasm. It is also known colloquially as squirting or gushing, although research indicates that female ejaculation and squirting are different phenomena, squirting being attributed to a sudden expulsion of liquid that partly comes from the bladder and contains urine.

Female ejaculation is physiologically distinct from coital incontinence, with which it is sometimes confused.

There have been few studies on female ejaculation. A failure to adopt common definitions and research methodology by the scientific community has been the primary contributor to this lack of experimental data. Research has suffered from highly selected participants, narrow case studies, or very small sample sizes, and consequently has yet to produce significant results. Much of the research into the composition of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is, or contains, urine. It is common for any secretion that exits the vagina, and for fluid that exits the urethra, during sexual activity to be referred to as &quot;female ejaculate&quot;, which has led to significant confusion in the literature.

Whether the fluid is secreted by the Skene&#x27;s gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remains controversial among medical professionals, and are related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot, there is substantial evidence that the Skene&#x27;s gland is the source of female ejaculation. The function of female ejaculation, however, remains unclear.

==Reports==
In questionnaire surveys, 35–50% of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm. Other studies find anywhere from 10 to 69%, depending on the definitions and methods used. For instance Kratochvíl (1994) surveyed 200 women and found that 6% reported ejaculating, an additional 13% had some experience and about 60% reported release of fluid without actual gushing. Reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably, starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman, to mean values of 1–5 ml.

The suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women&#x27;s health writer Rebecca Chalker as &quot;one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology&quot;. Female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical, medical, and biological literature throughout recorded history. The reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers.

===Western literature===

====16th to 18th century====
In the 16th century, the Dutch physician Laevinius Lemnius, referred to how a woman &quot;draws forth the man&#x27;s seed and casts her own with it&quot;. In the 17th century, François Mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that &quot;pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition, which increases the heat and enjoyment of women&quot;. This century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function, in particular the work of the Bartholin family in Denmark.

====De Graaf====
In the 17th century, the Dutch anatomist Reinier de Graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs &quot;Concerning the Generative Organs of Women&quot; which is much cited in the literature on this topic. De Graaf discussed the original controversy but supported the Aristotelian view. He identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts surrounding the urethra.

He identified [XIII:212] the various controversies regarding the ejaculate and its origin, but stated he believed that this fluid &quot;which rushes out with such impetus during venereal combat or libidinous imagining&quot; was derived from a number of sources, including the vagina, urinary tract, cervix and uterus. He appears to identify Skene&#x27;s ducts, when he writes [XIII: 213] &quot;those [ducts] which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female &#x27;parastatae&#x27;, or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage.&quot; However he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid &quot;which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man.&quot; Further on [XIII:214] he refers to &quot;liquid as usually comes from the pudenda in one gush.&quot; However, his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid, in his stand on the Aristotelian semen controversy.

===19th century===
Krafft-Ebing&#x27;s study of sexual perversion, &quot;Psychopathia Sexualis&quot; (1886), describes female ejaculation under the heading &quot;Congenital Sexual Inversion in Women&quot; as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality.

It is also described by Freud in pathological terms in his study of Dora (1905), where he relates it to hysteria.

However, women&#x27;s writing of that time portrayed this in more positive terms. Thus we find Almeda Sperry writing to Emma Goldman in 1918, about the &quot;rhythmic spurt of your love juices&quot;. Anatomical knowledge was also advanced by Alexander Skene&#x27;s description of para-urethral or periurethral glands (glands around the urethra) in 1880, which have been variously claimed to be one source of the fluids in the ejaculate, and now commonly referred to as the Skene&#x27;s glands.

===20th century===

====Early 20th-century understanding====
Female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century &#x27;marriage manuals&#x27;, such as TH Van de Velde&#x27;s &quot;Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique&quot; (1926). Certainly van de Velde was well aware of the varied experiences of women.

In 1948, Huffman, an American gynaecologist, published his studies of the prostatic tissue in women together with a historical account and detailed drawings. These clearly showed the difference between the original glands identified by Skene at the urinary meatus, and the more proximal collections of glandular tissue emptying directly into the urethra.

Most of the interest had focused on the substance and structure rather than function of the glands. A more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after, in 1950, with the publication of an essay by Gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm.

However this paper made little impact, and was dismissed in the major sexological writings of that time, such as Kinsey (1953) and Masters and Johnson (1966), equating this &quot;erroneous belief&quot; with urinary stress incontinence. Although clearly Kinsey was familiar with the phenomenon, commenting that (p. 612);

as were Masters and Johnson ten years later, who observed (pp 79–80):

(emphasis in original) yet dismissed it (p. 135) – &quot;female ejaculation is an erroneous but widespread concept&quot;, and even twenty years later in 1982, they repeated the statement that it was erroneous (p. 69–70) and the result of &quot;urinary stress incontinence&quot;.

====Late 20th-century awareness====
The topic did not receive serious attention again until a review by Josephine Lowndes Sevely and JW Bennett appeared in 1978. This latter paper, which traces the history of the controversies to that point, and a series of three papers in 1981 by Beverly Whipple and colleagues in the &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot;, became the focal point of the current debate. Whipple became aware of the phenomenon when studying urinary incontinence, with which it is often confused. As Sevely and Bennett point out, this is &quot;not new knowledge, but a rediscovery of lost awareness that should contribute towards reshaping our view of female sexuality&quot;. Nevertheless, the theory advanced by these authors was immediately dismissed by many other authors, such as physiologist Joseph Bohlen, for not being based on rigorous scientific procedures, and psychiatrist Helen Singer Kaplan (1983) stated:

Some radical feminist writers, such as Sheila Jeffreys (1985) were also dismissive, claiming it as a figment of male fantasy:

It required the detailed anatomical work of Helen O&#x27;Connell from 1998 onwards to more properly elucidate the relationships between the different anatomical structures involved. As she observes, the female perineal urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall and is surrounded by erectile tissue in all directions except posteriorly where it relates to the vaginal wall. &quot;The distal vagina, clitoris, and urethra form an integrated entity covered superficially by the vulval skin and its epithelial features. These parts have a shared vasculature and nerve supply and during sexual stimulation respond as a unit&quot;.

====Anthropological accounts====
Female ejaculation appears in 20th-century anthropological works, such as Malinowski&#x27;s Melanesian study, &quot;The Sexual Life of Savages&quot; (1929), and Gladwin and Sarason&#x27;s &quot;Truk: Man in Paradise&quot; (1956). Malinowski states that in the language of the Trobriand Island people, a single word is used to describe ejaculation in both male and female.

In describing sexual relations amongst the Chuukese Micronesians, Gladwin and Sarason state that &quot;Female orgasm is commonly signalled by urination&quot;. (p. 205) provides a number of examples from other cultures, including the Ugandan Batoro, Mohave Indians, Mangaians, and Ponapese. (See also Chalker 2002 pp. 531–2, Ladas et al. 1983 pp. 74–5)

Historically in Rwanda, the kunyaza sexual technique has the reputation of triggering female ejaculation (kunyara). The ancient sexual practice has been exercised for over 150 years in east and central Africa. Amongst the Buganda tribe of Uganda, the sexual practice is called kachabali (spraying the wall).

==Research==

===General===

There have been few studies on female ejaculation. Much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research methodology. Research has used highly selected individuals, case studies, or very small numbers of subjects, making generalization difficult. For instance, much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine. Rodriguez et al. stated that &quot;many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate, which leads to significant confusion in the literature.&quot;

There are also problems involved in the collection of specimens and issues of contamination. Since the area of interest is the para-urethral glands, it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine, especially considering that there may be retrograde ejaculation into the urethra towards the bladder. Research has attempted to use chemicals that are excreted in the urine so that any urinary contamination can be detected. Further methodological issues include the fact that the composition of the fluid appears to vary with the menstrual cycle, and that the biochemical profile of the para-urethral tissues varies with age. Other issues relate to the sensitivity and specificity of the markers chosen. The key questions are the source of the fluid produced, and its composition.

Whether the fluid is secreted by the Skene&#x27;s gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals, and are related to doubts over the existence of the G-spot, there is substantial evidence that the Skene&#x27;s gland is the source of female ejaculation. The function of female ejaculation, however, remains unclear.

===Female ejaculation vs. squirting or gushing ===
Some research has distinguished between female ejaculation and what is colloquially known as squirting or gushing. These terms are used by the public interchangeably, which often leads to confusion. In these research publications, it is suggested that &quot;real&quot; female ejaculation is the release of a very scanty, thick, and whitish fluid from the Skene&#x27;s gland, while the &quot;squirting&quot; or &quot;gushing&quot; (shown frequently in pornography) is a different phenomenon: the expulsion of clear and abundant fluid, which has been shown to be a diluted fluid from the urinary bladder.

===Relation to urinary incontinence===
Towards the later part of the 20th century, there was significant confusion between female ejaculation and coital incontinence. In 1982, Bohlen explained the accepted wisdom:

Scientific studies from the 1980s and later have demonstrated that the substance produced is distinct from urine, though it does show similarities such as alkalinity with urine. Davidson&#x27;s study of 1,289 women found that the sensation of ejaculation was very similar to that of urination. One study by Gary Schubach used urethral catheterization in order to separate urine from orgasmic expulsions from elsewhere in the body. Seven women claiming to have ejaculations expelled large volumes of urine through the catheter at orgasm, and little to no other fluid.

It may be important for physicians to establish whether there is in fact any incontinence in women who report ejaculation, to avoid unnecessary interventions. It is also important for physicians to distinguish orgasmic ejaculation from vaginal discharges which may require further investigation and treatment. In individual cases, the exact source of any reported discharge may not be obvious without further investigation.

===Nature of different fluids===
Critics have maintained that ejaculation is either stress incontinence or vaginal lubrication. Research in this area has concentrated almost exclusively on attempts to prove that the ejaculate is not urine, measuring substances such as urea, creatinine, prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), glucose and fructose levels. Early work was contradictory; the initial study on one woman by Addiego and colleagues, reported in 1981, could not be confirmed in a subsequent study on 11 women in 1983, but was confirmed in another 7 women in 1984. In 1985, a different group studied 27 women and found only urine, suggesting that results depend critically on the methods used.

A 2007 study on two women involved ultrasound, endoscopy, and biochemical analysis of fluid. The ejaculate was compared to pre-orgasmic urine from the same woman, and also to published data on male ejaculate. In both women, higher levels of PSA, PAP, and glucose but lower levels of creatinine were found in the ejaculate than the urine. PSA levels were comparable to those in males.

Ultrasounds from a 2014 study, involving seven women who reported recurring massive fluid emission during sexual arousal, confirmed thorough bladder emptiness before stimulation, noticeable bladder filling before squirting and demonstrated that the bladder had again been emptied after squirting. Although small amounts of prostatic secretions are present in the emitted fluid, the study suggests that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity.

===Source of fluid===
One very practical objection relates to the reported volumes ejaculated, since this fluid must be stored somewhere in the pelvis, of which the urinary bladder is the largest source. The actual volume of the para-urethral tissue is quite small. By comparison, male ejaculate varies from (95% confidence interval), with a maximum of . Therefore, claims of larger amounts of ejaculate are likely to contain at least some amount of urine. The eleven specimens analyzed by Goldberg in 1983, ranged from . One source states that Skene&#x27;s glands are capable of excreting in 30–50 seconds, but it is unclear how this was measured and has not been confirmed. One approach is to use a chemical like methylene blue so that any urinary component can be detected. Belzer showed that in one woman he studied, the dye was found in her urine, but not her orgasmic expulsion.

PAP and PSA have been identified in the para-urethral tissues, using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods, suggesting that the ejaculate is likely to arise from the ducts in these tissues, in a manner homologous to that in the male. Another marker common to the prostate/para-urethral tissue in both sexes is human protein 1.

PSA occurs in urine, and is elevated in post-orgasmic samples compared to pre-orgasmic. Simultaneous collection of ejaculate also showed PSA in both urine and ejaculate in all cases, but in higher concentration in the ejaculate than in the urine. Wimpissinger et al., 2007 reports the PSA level in urine in the 0.16–0.8 ng/mL range, and in female ejaculate in the 105.9–213.49 ng/mL range (two participants), more than a hundredfold difference.

==Social significance==
Sexual functions, and orgasm in particular, remain poorly understood scientifically. Regardless of the facts relating to the details of female ejaculation, the social significance of the popular accounts through the feminist health care movement has been considerable.

===Controversy and feminist criticism===
The debate in the current literature focuses on three threads: the existence of female ejaculation, its source(s) and composition, and its relationship to theories of female sexuality. This debate has been influenced by popular culture, pornography, and physio-chemical and behavioral studies. There is some resistance from feminists to what has been perceived as a male lens in interpreting the data and construct. Often the debate is also tied to the existence of the G-spot;
stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall simultaneously stimulates the para-urethral tissue (the site of the Skene&#x27;s glands and ducts, and a proposed likely source of ejaculation fluid), and so has been suggested as the trigger of ejaculation. These tissues, surrounding the distal urethra, and anterior to the vagina, have a common embryological origin to the prostatic tissue in the male.

==== Debate on the existence of ejaculation ====
In an extensive survey, Darling and colleagues claim support for the existence of ejaculation, while in a sharply critical response, Alzate states that direct experimentation fails to provide any evidence. Alzate states:

Shannon Bell argues that the debate is confused by the discussion of two separate phenomena. She comments that Alzate simply dismisses women&#x27;s subjective experiences in favour of rigorous scientific proof, and is typical of male sexologists withholding the validity of experience from women. Bell&#x27;s critique lies at the heart of feminist concerns about this debate, namely a tendency to &quot;disregard, reinterpret, and overwrite women&#x27;s subjective descriptions.&quot; For some, she states, it is more a matter of belief than of physiology. Bell further questions why feminists have not been more outspoken in defense of women&#x27;s control over female ejaculation, pointing out that the literature frames the discussion in only five separate ways; procreation, sexual pleasure, deviance, pathology, and a scientific mystery.

The discussion entered popular culture in 1982 with the publication of the best-selling book &quot;The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality,&quot; by Ladas, Whipple, and Perry. The book discussed female ejaculation and brought the issue back into discussions of women&#x27;s sexuality both in the medical community and among the general public. This was a popular account of three papers by the authors, the previous year, at the suggestion of Alice Khan Ladas. Rebecca Chalker notes that this book was largely met with scorn, skepticism and disbelief. The chapter on &#x27;Female Ejaculation&#x27; is largely based on anecdotal testimony, and illustrates another issue in the debate, the weight placed on anecdotes and small numbers of observations rather than biomedical investigation or clinical trials. Importantly, a number of the women stated that they had been diagnosed with urinary incontinence.

==== Debate on women&#x27;s pleasure in their sexuality ====
The book by Ladas, Whipple, and Perry. advances another feminist theory: that because women&#x27;s pleasure in their sexuality has been historically excluded, the pleasure of ejaculation has been either discounted or appropriated by health professionals as a physiological phenomenon. Whipple continued to publicise her discoveries, including a 9 min video made in 1981 &quot;Orgasmic Expulsions of Fluid in the Sexually Stimulated Female&quot;. In 1984, the &quot;Journal of Sex Research&quot; described the debate surrounding female ejaculation as &#x27;heated&#x27;.
Josephine Sevely then followed up her 1978 study by publishing &quot;Eve&#x27;s Secrets: A new theory of female sexuality&quot; in 1987, emphasising an integrated rather than fragmented approach to understanding female sexuality, with the clitoris, vagina and urethra depicted as a single sexual organ. This not only challenged the traditional fragmentation of female sexuality into clitoral vs. vaginal sensation, but also sexualised the urethra.

The continuing debate is further illustrated in the angry exchange of letters between the author and researchers in the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology&quot; in 2002 following the publication of &#x27;The G-spot: A modern gynecological myth&#x27; by Terence Hines, articles and book chapters continue to appear with subtitles such as &quot;Fact or Fantasy&quot; (2002). As of 2007, and 2008 the existence of a female prostate and of ejaculation are a matter of debate.

==== Debate on the terminology ====
The terminology (such as female prostate and female ejaculation) invoke images of the female as merely an imitation of the male, mapping the female body onto the male, as if, like the Galenic view, it was incomplete. Furthermore, overemphasis of ejaculation may induce performance anxiety. For the reason that &#x27;sameness&#x27; has been construed as a male perspective, some feminists reject the term ejaculation. Others argue it should be retained as a distinctive feminine characteristic distinguishable from the male, and imbued with different properties and purpose. A third concern is that of the increasing &#x27;medicalisation&#x27; of women&#x27;s sexuality, as expressed by Leonore Tiefer which finds its most extreme manifestation in the concept of female sexual dysfunction.
Tiefer has expressed concern that overemphasising ejaculation will drive women who might feel inadequate to seek medical attention (see Health implications below), as has the Boston Women&#x27;s Health Collective. Other criticism comes from Barbara Ehrenreich and colleagues who see this new sexuality as one that privileges the male in control, penile retention and body position, but this is denied by others.

=== Health implications ===
Many women, before learning about ejaculation, experienced shame or avoided sexual intimacy under the belief that they had wet the bed. Others suppressed sexual climax, and sought medical advice for this &quot;problem&quot;, and even underwent surgery.

Contemporary women&#x27;s health literature summarises what is considered factual as being that the amount of fluid varies greatly and may be unnoticeable, occurs with or without vaginal stimulation, and may accompany orgasm or merely intense sexual pleasure, and orgasm may occur without ejaculation. Whether it can be learned or not, women report that they can induce it by enhancing their sexual response. Regardless, countless workshops now exist to teach women that learning how to ejaculate is an important form of feminine sexual expression. Sundahl describes it as a birthright and essential part of female creativity.

===Legal implications===
The presence of chemical markers such as PSA or PAP in the female genital tract has been considered evidence in rape trials, but Sensabaugh and Kahane demonstrated in four specimens that PAP was an order of magnitude greater in a woman&#x27;s ejaculate than in her urine. Recently, knowledge that these markers can be of female origin has led to acquittal based on forensic evidence.

===In pornography===
Female pornographic performers who are alleged to ejaculate on film include Hotaru Akane, Charley Chase, Annie Cruz, Cytherea, Jamie Lynn, Jiz Lee, Missy Monroe, Jenna Presley, and Flower Tucci. Fallon is known as the first pornographic actress to allegedly ejaculate on film. Tiana Lynn can allegedly ejaculate as well, and she claims to have discovered her ability during a scene with Mark Ashley.

Sarah Jane Hamilton became known as one of the first alleged female ejaculators from Britain, though this was later dismissed by porn reviewer Pat Riley as urination in his review of &quot;The British Are Coming&quot; (1993). However, she has commented that she could not ejaculate on cue even though producers expect her to, like a male performer.

===Censorship===
In the United Kingdom, the British Board of Film Classification has requested edits to pornographic films alleged to show female ejaculation, claiming there is no such thing as female ejaculation (and therefore the films must promote urolagnia), according to expert medical &quot;advice&quot; provided to the film board. Urination during sex is considered obscene under the Obscene Publications Acts. The Board later stated that it does not take any view on whether female ejaculation exists or not, but that all apparent recorded instances (presented to the Board) were of mere female urination being touted as female ejaculation.

Easy on the Eye Productions released a press announcement on 6 October 2010, stating that the BBFC passed the DVD &quot;Women Love Porn&quot; (containing a sequence involving female ejaculation in the scene &quot;Top Milf&quot;) on advice of legal counsel when the director, Anna Span, pushed for a hearing with the Video Appeals Committee. Easy on the Eye Productions considered this an &quot;historic victory&quot;, although the BBFC maintains that its stance remains &quot;fundamentally unchanged&quot; for future releases. According to the &quot;Carnal Nation&quot; site, the issue was first raised by the group Feminists Against Censorship (FAC) in 2001.

In Australia, a similar view has been taken with regard to Internet censorship proposals, which ban pornographic websites featuring female ejaculation.

<doc id="155205" wikidata="Q970053" url="?curid=155205" title="Sefer haYashar (midrash)">
<text>Sefer haYashar () is a medieval Hebrew &quot;midrash&quot;, also known as the Toledot Adam and Divrei haYamim heArukh. The Hebrew title &quot;Sefer haYashar&quot; might be translated as the &quot;Book of Righteousness&quot; (or literally &quot;Book of the Straight&quot;). but it is known in English translation mostly as The Book of Jasher following English tradition. Its author is unknown.

==Other books of the same name==
The book is named after the Book of Jasher mentioned in Joshua and 2 Samuel.

Although it is presented as the original &quot;Book of Jasher&quot; in translations such as that of Moses Samuel (1840), it is not accepted as such in rabbinical Judaism. It should not be confused with the very different &quot;Book of Jasher (Pseudo-Jasher)&quot; printed by Jacob Ilive in 1751, which was purported to have been translated by the English monk Alcuin.

Additionally, an ethical text was written under the same name (not purporting to be the biblical book). According to the &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot;, Volume 14, p. 1099, this work was &quot;probably written in the 13th century.&quot;

Rabbeinu Tam also titled his work of Talmudic novellae Sefer Hayashar.

==Content==
The book covers biblical history from the creation of Adam and Eve until a summary of the initial Israelite conquest of Canaan in the beginning of the book of Judges.

The Bible twice quotes from a Sefer haYashar, and this midrashic work includes text that fits both Biblical references — the reference about the Sun and Moon found in Joshua, and also the reference in 2 Samuel (in the Hebrew but not in the Septuagint) to teaching the Sons of Judah to fight with the bow. This appears in Jasher 56:9 among the last words of Jacob to his son Judah:

:Only teach thy sons the bow and all weapons of war, in order that they may fight the battles of their brother who will rule over his enemies. (MCR)

But the book as a whole was written much later, as shown by chapter 10, which covers the descendants of Noah, but uses medieval names for territories and countries, most obviously &quot;Franza&quot; for France and &quot;Lumbardi&quot; in &quot;Italia&quot; for Lombardy. The text of this chapter closely follows the beginning of &quot;Josippon&quot;, a tenth-century rabbinic text that lists the various peoples living in Europe in .

Most of its extra-Biblical accounts are found in nearly the same form in other medieval compilations, or in the Talmud, other &quot;midrash&quot; or Arabic sources. For example, it includes the common tale that Lamech and his son Jabal accidentally killed Cain, thus requiting Cain&#x27;s wickedness for slaying Abel.

There are five discrepancies when comparing it with chapter 5 of Genesis: When the Sefer relates that a son of Seth died &quot;in the eighty-fourth year of the life of Noah,&quot; it calls that son &quot;Enoch&quot; instead of &quot;Enosh&quot;. Enoch actually was Jared&#x27;s son. Other than the confusion of the names, the date agrees with Genesis. The Sefer also relates that Jared died in the &quot;336th year of the life of Noah&quot; (instead of the 366th year, as in Genesis) and that Lamech died in the &quot;195th year of the life of Noah (instead of the 595th year). It also gives different lifespans for Lamech (770 instead of 777) and Methuselah (960 instead of 969).

In its genealogy of Abram (7:19), it makes no mention of the Cainan between Arpachshad and Selah, in congruence with the Masoretic Text and the Samaritan Pentateuch, but in conflict with the Septuagint and with the genealogy of Jesus in Luke 3.

In its highly interpolated account of God&#x27;s testing of Abraham concerning Isaac, it says in 23:50-51: &quot;And when they were going along Isaac said to his father: Behold, I see here the fire and wood, and where then is the lamb that is to be the burnt offering before the Lord? And Abraham answered his son Isaac, saying: The Lord has made choice of thee my son, to be a perfect burnt offering instead of the lamb.&quot; This conflicts with the biblical account, in which Abraham&#x27;s response was only: &quot;My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering.&quot;

The book, when recounting episodes from the pericope &quot;Shemot&quot;, contains anecdotal material about Moses when he fled from Pharaoh after killing the Egyptian, and who is said to have fled to the land of Kush at the age of eighteen, where he was made the king of Kush at the age of twenty-seven, and there reigned for forty years before being deposed at the age of sixty-seven. According to this narrative, which is also alluded to in Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities&quot; (2.10.1–2), Moses assisted the indigenous peoples of the country in their conquest of one of the rebellious cities (whose proprietor was Bilʻam the sorcerer) and which had been under siege for nine years. The narrative recounts how that when the enemy&#x27;s country was infested with poisonous serpents, Moses contrived a stratagem how they could advance on the besieged city and take it without suffering harm from the vipers, by bringing along with them caged birds who fed upon snakes, and releasing the hungry birds in the enemy&#x27;s territory. At this advice, they were able to take the city and they made Moses their king, and gave to him in marriage the deceased king&#x27;s wife, whose name was Adoniya (the widow of Qiqanos).

==History==
Scholars have proposed various dates between the 9th and 16th century for its composition.

The earliest extant version of this Hebrew &quot;midrash&quot; was printed in Venice in 1625, and the introduction refers to an earlier 1552 edition in Naples, of which neither trace nor other mention has been found. The printer Yosèf ben Samuel claimed the work was copied by a scribe named Jacob the son of Atyah, from an ancient manuscript whose letters could hardly be made out.

The Venice 1625 text was heavily criticised as a forgery by Leon Modena, as part of his criticisms of the &quot;Zohar&quot; as a forgery, and of Kabbalah in general. Modena was a member of the Venetian rabbinate that supervised the Hebrew press in Venice, and Modena prevented the printers from identifying &quot;Sefer ha-Yashar&quot; with the Biblical lost book.

Despite Modena&#x27;s intervention, the preface to the 1625 version still claims that its original source book came from the ruins of Jerusalem in 70 CE, where a Roman officer named Sidrus allegedly discovered a Hebrew scholar hiding in a hidden library. The officer Sidrus reportedly took the scholar and all the books safely back to his estates in Seville, Spain (in Roman known as Hispalis, the provincial capital of Hispania Baetica). The 1625 edition then claims that at some uncertain point in the history of Islamic Spain, the manuscript was transferred or sold to the Jewish college in Cordova. The 1625 edition further claims that scholars preserved the book until its printings in Naples in 1552 and in Venice in 1625. Apart from the preface to the 1625 work, there is no evidence to support any of this story. The work was used extensively, but not especially more than many other sources, in Louis Ginzberg&#x27;s &quot;Legends of the Jews&quot;.

Although there remains doubt about whether the 1552 &quot;edition&quot; in Naples was ever truly printed, the study of Joseph Dan, professor of Kabbalah at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in the preface to his 1986 critical edition of the 1625 text concludes, from the Hebrew used and other indicators, that the work was in fact written in Naples in the early 16th century. The Arabic connections suggest that if the preface to the 1625 version is an &quot;exaggeration&quot;, it was then probably written by a Jew who lived in Spain or southern Italy.

==Translations==
===Johann Abicht&#x27;s Latin translation===
Johann Georg Abicht, professor of theology at the University of Halle-Wittenberg, translated the 1625 text into Latin as &quot;Dissertatio de Libro recti&quot; (Leipzig, 1732).

===Moses Samuel&#x27;s English translation===
The first translation into English of the 1625 Venice edition was published in 1840 by Mordecai Manuel Noah and A. S. Gould. The translator was not named but was lauded by one of the four Hebraists who commented in the preface.
Subsequently, the translator identified himself as Moses Samuel of Liverpool (1795–1860), who had obtained a copy of the 1625 Hebrew edition and become convinced that the core of this work truly was the self-same &quot;Book of the Upright&quot; referenced in Hebrew scriptures. He translated the document into English and, after the Royal Asiatic Society at Calcutta declined to publish it, sold the translation to New York City publisher Noah for £150 in 1839. Samuel later said of the absence of his name on the translation that &quot;I did not put my name to it as my Patron and myself differed about its authenticity&quot; – Noah having had less confidence in the 1625 document than did Samuel.

Even so, Noah enthusiastically claimed in his promotional materials that the historian Josephus had said of the &quot;Book of Jasher&quot; &quot;by this book are to be understood certain records kept in some safe place on purpose, giving an account of what happened among the Hebrews from year to year, and called Jasher or the upright, on account of the fidelity of the annals.&quot; No such statement is found in Josephus&#x27;s works. Noah&#x27;s 1840 preface contained endorsements by Hebrew scholars of the day, all of whom praised the quality of the translation, but these said nothing to indicate they believed it to be the work referred to in Joshua and 2 Samuel. In fact one of them, Samuel H. Turner (1790–1861), of the General Theological Seminary in New York City, commented that &quot;The work itself is evidently composed in the purest Rabbinical Hebrew, with a large intermixture of the Biblical idiom&quot;, indicating he was not of the opinion that it was an ancient text.

===Edward B.M. Browne English translation===
Another translation of this book exists, created by Reform rabbi and editor, Dr. Edward B.M. Browne, known as &quot;Alphabet&quot; Browne, and published in New York in 1876.

==Acceptance by Latter-day Saints==
Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, acquired a copy in 1841 or 1842 and wrote in the September 1, 1842 edition of the &quot;Times and Seasons&quot;, in reference to the patriarch Abraham: &quot;the book of Jasher, which has not been disproved as a bad author, says he was cast into the fire of the Chaldeans&quot;. David Whitmer of the Three Witnesses, arguing in favour of accepting scripture outside of the Biblical canon, later wrote in his 1887 Whitmerite tract &quot;An Address to All Believers in Christ&quot;, &quot;There are over fifteen books spoken of in the Bible that are not in the Bible. [...] I have a copy of the book of Jasher; It is spoken of in 2 Sam. i:18 and Joshua x:13.&quot;

John C. Hamer has speculated that narrative points in the Book of Jasher relating to Adam and Eve&#x27;s &quot;garments&quot; and their acquisition by Nimrod may have influenced the development of the practice of wearing temple garments.

In 1886, Joseph Hyrum Parry of Salt Lake City acquired the rights to the translation from Mordecai Noah&#x27;s estate. It was published by J. H. Parry &amp; Company in Salt Lake City in 1887.

A number of Mormon scholars consider this Book of Jasher to be of authentic ancient Hebrew origin.
Some of these scholars suggest that the book likely contains many original portions of the Sefer HaYashar referenced in the Old Testament but also has a number of added interpolations. This Joseph Hyrum Parry edition of the Book of Jasher continues to be held in high repute by many Mormons. A number of Mormons have pointed to certain portions of the book that have commonalities to parts of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible, particularly those parts dealing with the antediluvian period. The Bible has only scant information about pre-flood times, but both the Book of Jasher and parts of the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible contain additional information, some of which is strikingly similar. The LDS Church does not officially endorse this Book of Jasher.

==Government==
St. Charles County is governed by a county executive and a county council. The county council consists of seven members, each elected from various districts in the county. The county executive is elected by the entire county. The current executive is Steve Ehlmann. He was preceded by Joe Ortwerth, who was preceded by Gene Schwendemann, the first county executive of St. Charles County under the new form of government. The executive under the old form of county government was termed a &quot;judge.&quot; The county had 258,525 registered voters as of March 2016.

St. Charles County Ambulance District (SCCAD) is the largest such district in Missouri, serving all of St. Charles County and its population of nearly 370,000.

=== Law enforcement ===
The St. Charles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (SCCSD) is responsible for court services and security, prisoner transport, civil process, and bailiffs. Until the end of 2014, SCCSD was the primary law enforcement agency serving unincorporated areas of St. Charles County. On January 1, 2015, the St. Charles County Police Department was established and assumed that responsibility. It should not be confused with the St. Charles City Police Department. The St. Charles County Regional SWAT Team is made up of officers from each county law enforcement agency.

The SCCPD Aviation Unit is part of a multi-jurisdictional unit known as the Metro Air Support Unit, with the Metropolitan Police Department, City of St. Louis; St. Louis County Police Department; and St. Charles County Police Department. As of 2024, the fleet included five helicopters, and twelve pilots or pilots in training.

In May 2022, Ryan Keuhner, who was then an SCCSD deputy, shot and killed his neighbor&#x27;s 3-year-old rescue dog with a pellet gun. The shooting was reportedly unprovoked and Keuhner was off duty at the time. Video of the dog&#x27;s owner confronting Keuhner was uploaded online, and later gained national coverage. Keuhner resigned in June 2022 and was charged with a class A misdemeanor for animal abuse.

=== Library resolution ===
In 2023, the county council issued a resolution aimed at library policies and staff online activities. The resolution followed protests and comments at council meetings from residents who complained about a staff member wearing gender non-conforming clothes. Within the resolution, the council asked the library CEO to remove an article they shared on their personal LinkedIn profile related to conservative campaigns targeting public libraries and freedom of speech.

<doc id="155214" wikidata="Q1753038" url="?curid=155214" title="Pudendal nerve">
<text>The pudendal nerve is the main nerve of the perineum. It is a mixed (motor and sensory) nerve and also conveys sympathetic autonomic fibers. It carries sensation from the external genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the anus and perineum, as well as the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the male or female external urethral sphincter and the external anal sphincter.

If damaged, most commonly by childbirth, loss of sensation or fecal incontinence may result. The nerve may be temporarily anesthetized, called pudendal anesthesia or pudendal block.

The pudendal canal that carries the pudendal nerve is also known by the eponymous term &quot;Alcock&#x27;s canal&quot;, after Benjamin Alcock, an Irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836.

==Structure==

=== Origin ===
The pudendal nerve is paired, meaning there are two nerves, one on the left and one on the right side of the body. Each is formed as three roots immediately converge above the upper border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the coccygeus muscle. The three roots become two cords when the middle and lower root join to form the lower cord, and these in turn unite to form the pudendal nerve proper just proximal to the sacrospinous ligament. The three roots are derived from the ventral rami of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th sacral spinal nerves, with the primary contribution coming from the 4th.

=== Course and relations ===
The pudendal nerve passes between the piriformis muscle and coccygeus (ischiococcygeus) muscles and leaves the pelvis through the lower part of the greater sciatic foramen. It crosses over the lateral part of the sacrospinous ligament and reenters the pelvis through the lesser sciatic foramen. After reentering the pelvis, it accompanies the internal pudendal artery and internal pudendal vein upwards and forwards along the lateral wall of the ischiorectal fossa, being contained in a sheath of the obturator fascia termed the pudendal canal, along with the internal pudendal blood vessels.

=== Branches ===
Inside the pudendal canal, the nerve divides into branches, first giving off the inferior rectal nerve, then the perineal nerve, before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis (in males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females).

===Nucleus===
The nerve is a major branch of the sacral plexus, with fibers originating in Onuf&#x27;s nucleus in the sacral region of the spinal cord.

===Variation===
The pudendal nerve may vary in its origins. For example, the pudendal nerve may actually originate in the sciatic nerve. Consequently, damage to the sciatic nerve can affect the pudendal nerve as well. Sometimes dorsal rami of the first sacral nerve contribute fibers to the pudendal nerve, and even more rarely .

==Function==
The pudendal nerve has both motor (control of muscles) and sensory functions. It also carries sympathetic autonomic fibers (but not parasympathetic fibers).

=== Sensory ===
The pudendal nerve supplies sensation to the penis in males, and to the clitoris in females, which travels through the branches of both the dorsal nerve of the penis and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris. The posterior scrotum in males and the labia majora in females are also supplied, via the posterior scrotal nerves (males) or posterior labial nerves (females). The pudendal nerve is one of several nerves supplying sensation to these areas. Branches also supply sensation to the anal canal. By providing sensation to the penis and the clitoris, the pudendal nerve is responsible for the afferent component of penile erection and clitoral erection. 

=== Motor ===
Branches innervate muscles of the perineum and the pelvic floor; namely, the bulbospongiosus and the ischiocavernosus muscles respectively, the levator ani muscle (including the Iliococcygeus, pubococcygeus, puborectalis and either pubovaginalis in females or puboprostaticus in males) the external anal sphincter (via the inferior anal branch), and male or female external urethral sphincter.

As it functions to innervate the external urethral sphincter it is responsible for the tone of the sphincter mediated via acetylcholine release. This means that during periods of increased acetylcholine release the skeletal muscle in the external urethral sphincter contracts, causing urinary retention. Whereas in periods of decreased acetylcholine release the skeletal muscle in the external urethral sphincter relaxes, allowing voiding of the bladder to occur. (Unlike the internal sphincter muscle, the external sphincter is made of skeletal muscle, therefore it is under voluntary control of the somatic nervous system.)

It is also responsible for ejaculation.

==Clinical significance==
The pudendal nerve may be tested by elicitation of the anocutaneous reflex (&quot;anal wink&quot;).

===Anesthesia===

A pudendal nerve block, also known as a &quot;saddle nerve block&quot;, is a local anesthesia technique used in an obstetric procedure to anesthetize the perineum during labor. In this procedure, an anesthetic agent such as lidocaine is injected through the inner wall of the vagina about the pudendal nerve. Abnormal loss of sensation in the same region as a medical symptom is also sometimes termed saddle anesthesia.

===Damage===

The pudendal nerve can be compressed or stretched, resulting in temporary or permanent neuropathy. Injury to the pudendal nerve manifests more as sensory problems (pain or alteration/loss of sensation) rather than loss of muscle control. Irreversible nerve injury may occur when nerves are stretched by 12% or more of their normal length. If the pelvic floor is over-stretched, acutely (e.g. prolonged or difficult childbirth) or chronically (e.g. chronic straining during defecation caused by constipation), the pudendal nerve is vulnerable to stretch-induced neuropathy. After repeated traction of the pudendal nerve, it starts to be replaced by fibrous tissue with subsequent loss of function. Pudendal nerve entrapment, also known as &quot;Alcock canal syndrome&quot;, is neuropathic pain in the distribution of the pudendal nerve. It is caused by entrapment of the nerve. The condition is estimated to have a prevalence of 1 in 100000, and is sometimes associated with professional cycling. Systemic diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis can damage the pudendal nerve via demyelination or other mechanisms. A pelvic tumor (most notably a large sacrococcygeal teratoma), or surgery to remove the tumor, can also cause permanent damage.
Unilateral pudendal nerve neuropathy inconsistently causes fecal incontinence in some, but not others. This is because crossover innervation of the external anal sphincter occurs in some individuals. There is significant overlap of the innervation of the external anal sphincter from the pudendal nerves of both sides. This allows partial re-innervation from the opposite side after nerve injury.

===Imaging===

The pudendal nerve is difficult to visualize on routine CT or MR imaging, however under CT guidance, a needle may be placed adjacent to the pudendal neurovascular bundle. The ischial spine, an easily identifiable structure on CT, is used as the level of injection. A spinal needle is advanced via the gluteal muscles and advanced within several millimeters of the ischial spine. Contrast (X-ray dye) is then injected, highlighting the nerve in the canal and allowing for confirmation of correct needle placement. The nerve may then be injected with cortisone and local anesthetic to confirm and also treat chronic pain of the external genitalia (known as vulvodynia in females), pelvic and anorectal pain.

====Nerve latency testing====
The time taken for a muscle supplied by the pudendal nerve to contract in response to an electrical stimulus applied to the sensory and motor fibers can be quantified. Increased conduction time (terminal motor latency) signifies damage to the nerve. 2 stimulating electrodes and 2 measuring electrodes are mounted on the examiner&#x27;s gloved finger (&quot;St Mark&#x27;s electrode&quot;).

==History==
The term pudendal comes from Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning external genitals, derived from , meaning &quot;parts to be ashamed of&quot;. The pudendal canal is also known by the eponymous term &quot;Alcock&#x27;s canal&quot;, after Benjamin Alcock, an Irish anatomist who documented the canal in 1836. Alcock documented the existence of the canal and pudendal nerve in a contribution about iliac arteries in Robert Bentley Todd&#x27;s &quot;The Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology&quot;.

<text>Roone Pinckney Arledge Jr. (July 8, 1931 – December 5, 2002) was an American sports and news broadcasting executive who was president of ABC Sports from 1968 until 1986 and ABC News from 1977 until 1998, and a key part of the company&#x27;s rise to competition with the two other main television networks, NBC and CBS, in the 1960s, &#x27;70s, &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s. He created many programs still airing today, such as &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;, &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot;.

==Early life==
Arledge was born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City, the son of Gertrude (Stritmater) and Roone Pinckney Arledge, an attorney. Arledge grew up in Merrick and attended Wellington C. Mepham High School on Long Island where he wrestled and played baseball. Although Arledge was not a stand out wrestler, Mepham was the most premier wrestling school in the country at the time.

Upon graduation, he decided that sportswriting was what he wanted to do in life, and applied to Columbia University. There, he discovered that Columbia&#x27;s journalism program was a graduate program, not an undergraduate one. Even so, Arledge liked what he saw and enrolled in a liberal-arts program. He also served as President of the Omega chapter of the fraternity of Phi Gamma Delta. His classmates included Max Frankel, who would eventually win a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for his work as editorial page editor of the New York Times; Larry Grossman, who became president of the Public Broadcasting Service in 1976 and later went on to head NBC News; and Richard Wald, another president of NBC News that Arledge would later persuade to come over to ABC News as a senior vice-president. He was the only one of the four who did not work at the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;, the daily student newspaper of Columbia University.

After receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1952, Arledge enrolled in graduate studies at Columbia&#x27;s School of International and Public Affairs. Restless with graduate studies, he went looking for a job where he could use his college degree and obtained an entry-level job at the DuMont Television Network. Military service intervened, and after Arledge&#x27;s discharge, he learned the network had folded and he had no job to return to.

==Personal life==

Arledge was married three times. He wed Gigi Shaw in 1994. He is survived by her and his four children from his first marriage, Roone, Elizabeth, Susan Weston and Patricia Loonie. His previous spouses were Joan Heise and Ann Fowler.

==Career==
Contacts he made at DuMont paid off with a stage manager&#x27;s job at NBC&#x27;s New York City station, WRCA (later WNBC). One of his assignments there was to help produce a children&#x27;s puppet show hosted by Shari Lewis. In 1958, the program won a New York City Emmy award.

Even with that success, Arledge wanted to tinker with programming ideas. Using the avant-garde magazine &quot;Playboy&quot; as his model, Arledge convinced his superiors at WRCA to let him film a pilot of a show he called &quot;For Men Only&quot;. While his superiors liked the pilot, they told him WRCA could not find a place in the programming schedule for it. But the WRCA weatherman, Pat Hernon, who hosted the pilot episode of &quot;For Men Only&quot;, began showing the kinescope to people around New York City who might want the program. One of them was a former account executive at the ad agency Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, Edgar J. Scherick, who as far as Hernon knew, was doing something at ABC.

===Assistant Producer===

Scherick had joined the fledgling ABC television network when he persuaded it to purchase Sports Programs, Inc. Scherick had formed this company after leaving CBS when the network would not make him the head of sports programming, choosing instead Bill MacPhail, a former baseball public-relations agent. Before ABC Sports even became a formal division of the network, Scherick and ABC programming chief Tom Moore pulled off many programming deals involving the most popular American sporting events.

While Scherick wasn&#x27;t interested in &quot;For Men Only,&quot; he recognized the talent Arledge had. Arledge realized ABC was the organization he was looking to join. The lack of a formal organization would offer him the opportunity to claim real power when the network matured. So, he signed on with Scherick as an assistant producer.

Several months before ABC began broadcasting NCAA college football games, Arledge sent Scherick a remarkable memo, filled with youthful exuberance, and television production concepts which sports broadcasts have adhered to since. Previously, network sporting broadcasts had consisted of simple set-ups and focused on the game itself. The genius of Arledge in this memo was not that he offered another way to broadcast the game to the sports fan. Arledge recognized television had to take the sports fan to the game. In addition, Arledge realized that the broadcasts needed to attract, and hold the attention of women viewers. At age 29 on September 17, 1960, he put his vision into reality with ABC&#x27;s first NCAA college football broadcast from Birmingham, Alabama, between Alabama Crimson Tide and the Georgia Bulldogs won by Alabama, 21–6. That same year, ABC began broadcasting games in the fledgling American Football League and used the same innovative techniques in their broadcasts. Sports broadcasting has not been the same since.

===ABC Sports===

Despite the production values he brought to NCAA college football, Scherick wanted low-budget (as in inexpensive broadcasting rights) sports programming that could attract and retain an audience. He hit upon the idea of broadcasting track and field events sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union. While Americans were not exactly fans of track and field events, Scherick figured Americans understood games.

So in January 1961, Scherick called Arledge into his office and asked him to attend the annual AAU board of governors meeting. While he was shaking hands, Scherick said, if the mood seemed right, might he cut a deal to broadcast AAU events on ABC? It seemed a tall assignment, but as Scherick said years later, &quot;Roone was a gentile and I was not.&quot; Arledge came back with a deal for ABC to broadcast all AAU events for $50,000 a year.

Next, Scherick and Arledge divided up their NCAA college football sponsor list. They then telephoned their sponsors and said in so many words, &quot;Advertise on our new sports show coming up in April, or forget about buying commercials on NCAA college football this fall.&quot; The two persuaded enough sponsors to advertise, though it took them to the last day of a deadline imposed by ABC programming to do it.

&quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; suited Scherick&#x27;s plans exactly. By exploiting the speed of jet transportation and flexibility of videotape, Scherick was able to undercut NBC and CBS&#x27;s advantages in broadcasting live sporting events. In that era, with communications nowhere near as universal as they are today, ABC was able to safely record events on videotape for later broadcast without worrying about an audience finding out the results.

Arledge, his colleague Chuck Howard, and Jim McKay (who left CBS for this opportunity) made up the show on a week-by-week basis the first year it was broadcast. Arledge had a genius for the dramatic storyline that unfolded in the course of a game or event. McKay&#x27;s honest curiosity and reporter&#x27;s bluntness gave the show an emotional appeal that attracted viewers who might not otherwise watch a sporting event.

But more importantly from Arledge&#x27;s perspective, &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; allowed him to demonstrate his ability as an administrator as well as producer. Arledge did not gain a formal title as president of ABC Sports until 1968, even though Scherick left his position to assume a position of vice president for programming at ABC in 1964.

Arledge personally produced all ten ABC Olympic broadcasts, created the primetime &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, and is said to have coined ABC&#x27;s famous &quot;The thrill of victory, and the agony of defeat&quot; tagline — although ABC insiders of that era attribute the authorship to legendary sports broadcaster Jim McKay. He also presided as producer over the 1975 flop, &quot;Saturday Night Live with Howard Cosell&quot;, which director Don Mischer blamed on Arledge&#x27;s inexperience with the variety show genre and indifference to the work required.

===ABC News===
Arledge took over as President of ABC News during a time that had been characterized by blunders such as the disastrous pairing of Barbara Walters with Harry Reasoner at the desk of the network&#x27;s evening news. The previous year, ABC had lured Walters away from NBC&#x27;s Today Show for $1,000,000. Previous to that time, the only news experience Arledge had was providing ABC&#x27;s coverage of the tragedies during the &#x27;72 Olympics in Munich. Other than that, he had no other major experience in news. Arledge&#x27;s first major creation for ABC was 20/20, which premiered in June 1978. The first iteration of this program fared badly, and resulted in the firing of the original hosts, with Hugh Downs chosen as the new anchor beginning the second week of the program, with the above-mentioned Barbara Walters joining Downs the following year, eventually becoming Downs&#x27; co-anchor by 1981.

Shortly thereafter, Arledge reformatted the network&#x27;s evening newscast with many of the splashy graphics he had developed at Wide World of Sports, and created World News Tonight. The program was unique not only because it was anchored by three newsmen, but because each of them was located in separate cities. The lead anchor became Frank Reynolds, who was based in Washington, with Max Robinson based out of Chicago, and Peter Jennings reporting from London. The program expanded to Sundays in 1979 and Saturdays in 1985.

In 1983, Reynolds died of bone cancer, and Robinson departed the network, and ABC made Jennings the sole anchor of World News Tonight on September 5, 1983. Jennings anchored the broadcast until April 5, 2005, when he announced that he had been diagnosed with lung cancer, to which Jennings would succumb on August 7, 2005.

In 1979, the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran was taken over by Iranian students, creating the Iranian Hostage Crisis. And on November 4, 1979, Frank Reynolds began anchoring a series of special reports entitled America Held Hostage. Several nights later, Ted Koppel, then the network&#x27;s diplomatic correspondent to the U.S. State Department, took over as anchor. The special reports led to the creation of Nightline, which premiered on March 24, 1980. Koppel anchored the broadcast with Chris Bury, and served as its managing editor. Koppel retained the position until his retirement in November 2005.

In 1981, Arledge brought David Brinkley to ABC from NBC, and created the Sunday-morning affairs program This Week for Brinkley. Brinkley would retire from the program in 1996. The last major news program created during Arledge&#x27;s reign at ABC News was &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, in 1989. The program was originally anchored by Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer.

In 1986, Arledge stepped down as president of ABC Sports. That same year, ABC&#x27;s World News Tonight began a ten-year domination of the network news ratings. In 1998, Arledge retired from ABC News. Arledge died on December 5, 2002, in New York City, New York, at the age of 71, following a battle with prostate cancer. He was buried in Southampton Cemetery. His autobiography, &quot;Roone: A Memoir&quot;, was published posthumously in 2003.

==United States Championship Tournament scandal==

In 1976, managing editor of &quot;The Ring&quot;, Johnny Ort fabricated records of selected boxers, to elevate them, thereby securing them lucrative fights in the United States Championship Tournament, which was promoted by Don King and sponsored by ABC Sports. The scandal was uncovered by boxing writer Malcolm &quot;Flash&quot; Gordon and ABC staffer Alex Wallau. After Gordon and Wallau&#x27;s evidence was presented to Arledge the United States Championship tournament was cancelled. The scandal would lead to the eventual resignation of New York State Boxing Commissioner James A. Farley Jr., who had lent his name to the Championship fights.

==&quot;20/20&quot; criticism==
Scandal would erupt around Arledge again in 1985 from a decision by Arledge, president of ABC News and Sports, to kill a 13-minute report about Marilyn Monroe possibly due to his close ties to Ethel Kennedy. &quot;20/20&quot; drew criticism from the co-anchors of the program, Hugh Downs and Barbara Walters, and the executive producer, Av Westin. Arledge said that he had killed the piece because it was &quot;gossip-column stuff&quot; and &quot;does not live up to its billing.&quot; Downs, however, took issue with Arledge&#x27;s judgment. &quot;I am upset about the way it was handled,&quot; he said in an interview. &quot;I honestly believe that this is more carefully documented than anything any network did during Watergate. I lament the fact that the decision reflects badly on people I respect and it reflects badly on me and the broadcast.&quot; Additionally, Westin said: &quot;I don&#x27;t anticipate not putting it on the air. The journalism is solid. Everything in there has two sources. We are documenting that there was a relationship between Bobby and Marilyn and Jack and Marilyn. A variety of eyewitnesses attest to that on camera.&quot; Two other aspects of the unaired report, according to an ABC staff member who has seen it, are eyewitness accounts of wiretapping of Miss Monroe&#x27;s home by Jimmy Hoffa, the Teamster leader, that reveal meetings between her and the Kennedy brothers, and accounts of a visit to Monroe by Robert F. Kennedy on the day of her death. Fred Otash, a detective who says he was the chief wiretapper, is interviewed on camera, and ABC staff members said his account was corroborated by three other wiretappers. In addition, several people not in the book say on camera that Monroe kept diaries with references to meetings with the Kennedy brothers, according to a staff member who has seen the report. &quot;It set out to be a piece which would demonstrate that because of alleged relations between Bobby Kennedy and John Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe the Presidency was compromised because organized crime was involved,&quot; he said. &quot;Based on what has been uncovered so far, there was no evidence.&quot; Arledge&#x27;s decision to kill the broadcast resulted in the subsequent decision of Geraldo Rivera to leave ABC entirely. Rivera was a &quot;20/20&quot; correspondent but did not work on that story. He had been publicly critical of Arledge&#x27;s decision. Arledge, who has been both a champion and defender of Rivera, has said he thought the story needed more work.

==Honors==
Arledge was selected by &quot;Life&quot; magazine as one of the &quot;100 Most Important Americans of the 20th Century&quot;. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked him number three in a list of &quot;the 40 individuals who have most significantly altered or elevated the world of sports in the last four decades&quot;.

The NATPE &quot;Man of the Year&quot; Iris Award was presented to him in 1971. In 1981, he was a recipient of the Silver Olympic Order.

He was the winner of 37 Emmy Awards and in 1990 was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. In 2001, he was given the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award by the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2007, The Walt Disney Company posthumously named Arledge a Disney Legend for his contributions to ABC News and ABC Sports (now ESPN on ABC), both (along with the ABC Network) now owned by Disney.

The Roone Arledge auditorium located in student center Alfred Lerner Hall of Columbia University, Arledge&#x27;s Alma Mater, is named in his honor.

In 1997, Arledge won the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism.

Arledge was portrayed by John Heard in the 2002 TNT movie &quot;Monday Night Mayhem&quot;. In the 2024 film &quot;September 5&quot;, about ABC&#x27;s coverage of the 1972 Munich Olympics, Arledge was portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard.

<text>Knutsford () is a market town and civil parish in the Cheshire East district, in Cheshire, England; it is located south-west of Manchester, north-west of Macclesfield and south-east of Warrington. The population of the parish at the 2021 census was 13,259.

Knutsford&#x27;s main town centre streets, Princess Street (also known locally as Top Street) and King Street lower down (also known as Bottom Street), form the hub of the town. At one end of the narrow King Street is an entrance to Tatton Park. The Tatton estate was home to the Egerton family and has given its name to Tatton parliamentary constituency, which includes the neighbouring communities of Alderley Edge and Wilmslow.

Knutsford is near Cheshire&#x27;s Golden Triangle and is on the Cheshire Plain between the Peak District to the east and the Welsh mountains to the west. Residents include &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actress Barbara Knox and footballers Peter Crouch, Sam Ricketts, Michael Jacobs and Phil Jagielka.

== History ==

Knutsford was recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cunetesford&quot; (&quot;Canute&#x27;s ford&quot;). King Canute (&quot;Knútr&quot; in Old Norse) was the king of England (1016–1035) and later king of Denmark, Norway and parts of Sweden as well. Local tradition says that King Canute blessed a wedding that was taking place and forded the River Lily, which was said to be dangerous then, though other reports say it was the Birkin Brook at or near Booth Mill. The English Place-Name Society gives the name as being derived from the Old English for &quot;Knutr&#x27;s ford&quot; or possibly &quot;hillock ford&quot;.

In 1292, Edward I granted Knutsford a market charter, allowing the town to hold a weekly market and annual fairs.

Knutsford was historically part of the ancient parish of Rostherne. A chapel of ease to serve Knutsford was built in the 14th century on a site to the east of the town near Booths Mere. The chapel was initially dedicated to St Helena and later to St John. In 1741, Knutsford was made a separate parish from Rostherne. St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church was built between 1741 and 1744 on a site in the centre of the town to serve as the new parish church, and the old chapel to the east of the town was demolished.

Knutsford gaol was built in 1817 and later extended in 1853. It was not just built to house those committed of crimes but also to house those who could not be employed. In 1915, due to the low population and there being an ongoing World War the gaol was used as a military prison, for the detention of soldiers found guilty of committing offences. From 1916 it was used to house conscientious objectors who broke the Military Service Act 1916. In April 1916 there was an Easter Rising in Ireland, where rebels hoped to form an independent Ireland free from British rule. At least 600 rebels involved in that rising were transported to Knutsford by train from Holyhead and imprisoned in Knutsford Gaol. During this period many prisoners were not properly fed and resorted to eating grass and anything discarded by visitors. The gaol was demolished in 1934.

Knutsford was the place in which General George S. Patton, shortly before the Normandy invasion, delivered a speech perceived to be critical of the Soviets, and to have &quot;slap(ped) the face of every one of the United Nations except Great Britain&quot;, which nearly ended his career.

After the Second World War, overspill housing estates were created in the town to accommodate families from Manchester. The Longridge overspill estate was built in Over Ward by Manchester City Council in the 1960s. At the end of the 20th century, all of the homes on the estate that had not already been sold to their occupants were transferred to Manchester Methodist Housing.

In 2005 Knutsford was named as the most expensive town to buy a house in Northern England, followed by nearby town Altrincham. There is an extremely large range of house prices in Knutsford, varying from approximately £175,000 to nearly £4,000,000 in late 2017. The average price is above £400,000.

== Governance ==

There are two tiers of local government covering Knutsford, at civil parish (town) and unitary authority level: Knutsford Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at the Council Offices on Toft Road, which had been built in 1846 as the Governor&#x27;s House for Knutsford Gaol.

For national elections, the town forms part of the Tatton constituency, named after Tatton Park which lies immediately north of the town.

===Administrative history===
Knutsford was historically in the ancient parish of Rostherne, which formed part of the Bucklow Hundred of Cheshire. Rostherne parish was subdivided into several townships, including Nether Knutsford (or Knutsford Inferior) and Over Knutsford (or Knutsford Superior). The main part of the town was in Nether Knutsford township, with Over Knutsford lying to the south-east. In 1741, Knutsford was made a separate parish, which contained the five townships of Nether Knutsford, Over Knutsford, Bexton, Ollerton, and Toft.

From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Rostherne and Knutsford, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships also became civil parishes.

When elected parish and district councils were established in December 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894, Nether Knutsford and Over Knutsford were both briefly included in the Altrincham Rural District and given separate parish councils. The two townships were subsequently merged into a single civil parish and urban district of Knutsford, which came into effect on 1 April 1895. The urban district council bought the former Governor&#x27;s House of Knutsford Gaol in 1929 and converted the building to serve as its offices and meeting place.

Knutsford Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to Macclesfield Borough Council. A successor parish covering the area of the former Knutsford Urban District was created at the same time, with its parish council taking the name Knutsford Town Council. In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===

Knutsford has excellent access to the motorway network, with junctions to the M6 (J19) and M56 (J7) motorways nearby. However, this can also have disadvantages as the A50, which runs through Knutsford town centre, follows a similar route to the M6 between Warrington and Stoke-on-Trent; this means that if the M6 is closed, due to an accident or roadworks, then a large volume of traffic transfers to the A50 and causes major traffic jams in Knutsford.

=== Railway ===
Knutsford railway station is a stop on the Mid-Cheshire Line that runs from Chester to Manchester Piccadilly, via Altrincham. 

The station was built in 1862 by the Cheshire Midland Railway (CMR). The CMR was absorbed into the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) in August 1867; this entity continued to serve Knutsford until nationalisation on 1 January 1948. The rail service to Manchester was re-routed via a slower route when the Manchester Metrolink trams took over the CLC direct line between Altrincham and Manchester; the heavy rail service was re-routed, via Stockport, to Manchester.

Currently, Northern Trains generally run an hourly service in both directions. Trains operate to Northwich and Chester to the south-west; northbound services travel to Altrincham, Stockport and Manchester. There are extra trains to and from Stockport at peak times on weekdays. On Sundays, there is a service every two hours to Chester and a service every two hours to Manchester, 

The number of weekday peak trains to Manchester was cut back controversially in December 2008, to allow Virgin Trains West Coast to run extra services between Manchester and London. Knutsford was expected to get a half-hourly train services to Northwich and Manchester (Monday to Saturday) by December 2017, with an increase in the Sunday frequency to hourly, but the promised additional services have failed to materialise.

=== Buses ===
Local bus operators in Knutsford are D&amp;G Bus and Warrington&#x27;s Own Buses. Since April 2018, bus service cutbacks has left Knutsford with fewer regular routes; these are:
* Route 88: this is an hourly Altrincham-Wilmslow-Knutsford service, with most buses continuing to either Macclesfield or Northwich. This service operates Mondays to Saturdays.
* Route 89: there are two-hourly services during the day between Knutsford and Northwich, with additional services on Saturdays.
* There is a &quot;Flexilink&quot; (a flexible &quot;dial-a-ride&quot; service) available to people with disabilities or over 80 between 09:30 and 14:30 Monday to Friday.

In the past, it was common for one bus operator to run most or all of the bus routes in Knutsford. Crosville Motor Services ran buses across Cheshire and North Wales. Star Line Travel later took over services, who were based in Knutsford (at Stanley Road Industrial Estate) and Wythenshawe; they were taken over by North Western Road Car Company, who then later became part of Arriva Midlands. Star Line Travel&#x27;s Knutsford depot closed, which made running bus routes in Knutsford an unattractive proposition for Arriva, who ceased to serve the town in January 2009. Star Line Travel&#x27;s coach division was later split between Bullocks Coaches and Selwyns Travel.

=== Airport ===
Manchester Airport is located from Knutsford in the civil parish of Ringway; however, there are no direct bus or railway links to it from Knutsford.

== Economy ==

Knutsford town centre has several restaurants and pubs, coffee shops, boutiques, antique shops and art galleries. Knutsford has a medium-sized supermarket, Booths, also an Aldi, a Little Waitrose, a Sainsbury&#x27;s Local, Olive and Sage. and two Co-Op stores (one on Princess Street and one on Parkgate Lane).

Tesco used to have a small shop in the town centre, which closed many years ago. The retailer had hoped to open a larger store on the edge of the town on Mobberley Road, but councillors in Mobberley objected to the proposed development, thinking it might result in more cars travelling through their village.

In 2008, Aldi announced plans to open a superstore in Knutsford, but construction did not begin until September 2012. The store officially opened in July 2013.

Barclays has a large campus site at Radbroke Hall on Toft Road just outside Knutsford, employing approximately 3000 staff in IT and support functions. Before Barclays purchased the site, it was owned by The Nuclear Power Group.

== Religion ==

St John the Baptist church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the located in the Church of England Diocese of Chester built between 1741 and 1744. It is in the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women.

St Cross is an Anglican church recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, built between 1880 and 1887. Unlike St John&#x27;s the church has had two female vicars since the Church of England approved the ordination of women.

St Vincent de Paul is a Catholic church in the Diocese of Shrewsbury. The current church opened in 1983, replacing an older church on the same site dating from the 1920s that was demolished due to subsidence. The first St Vincent de Paul church is still standing and has since been converted in to The Little Theatre. The current church includes a plaque blessed by Pope John Paul II on his visit to Manchester in 1982. The church was modified in 1999 to include an apse with a stained glass window, which had previously been installed at Cross and Passion Sisters convent chapel, Maryfield, Dublin. The church claims the window was designed by Harry Clarke, although other sources state the window is too modern to have been designed by Clarke himself but it can still be attributed to the Harry Clarke Studio.

There is a Methodist church; a Unitarian church dating from 1689, where the novelist Elizabeth Gaskell is buried; and a Gospel church, located in the old ticket office at Knutsford station.
===Ordination Test School===
In 1919, Toc H founder Tubby Clayton opened a school (originally in the abandoned Knutsford Gaol) to begin the training of men leaving the armed forces, so that they might eventually train for ordination. This first Knutsford Ordination Test School, for service-men and funded by central church funds, was closed in 1922 and a new, private successor for civilians opened in a house in Knutsford called &quot;Kilrie&quot; in the same year. The school moved to the Old Rectory in Hawarden, Wales, where it was opened by A. G. Edwards, Bishop of St Asaph and Archbishop of Wales, and Cosmo Lang, Archbishop of York, on 26 January 1927. By Michaelmas 1939, when the Old Rectory was required for housing refugees, the school relocated one last time to Hawarden Castle before closing finally the next year.

There were other Ordination Test Schools, including the predecessor of the House of the Epiphany, Kuching.

== Education ==
Knutsford has five primary schools (one of these is a Roman Catholic school). Knutsford also has a high school: Knutsford Academy, which also has a Sixth Form. Some secondary school pupils from the town travel to schools in Altrincham, Hartford, Holmes Chapel, Hale and Macclesfield. Some sixth formers from the town travel to colleges in Northwich and Timperley. Macclesfield College run some adult education courses in Knutsford and Age UK run computer courses for the over 50s at Knutsford Library (as well as other libraries in Cheshire).

== Sport ==
Knutsford Cricket Club was established in 1881 and plays its home games on Mereheath Lane in the Cheshire Cricket Alliance.

Toft Cricket Club is located at Booths Park, Chelford Road. The Cricket Club gets its name from a neighbouring civil parish of Toft where the original ground was located when the club was established in 1928. Toft play in the ECB Premier Division of the Cheshire County Cricket League It won the National Village Championship trophy at Lords in 1989.

Knutsford Hockey Club plays its home games at Knutsford Leisure Centre and are based at the Crosstown Bowling Club on Chelford Road.

Knutsford Football Club, formed in 1948, play at their Manchester Road ground. The club has two Saturday teams, the first team in the Cheshire League and the second or A team in the Altrincham and District League. Two Associated Veterans teams also play on Sundays in the Cheshire Veterans League. In 2015, a youth team has been fielded again after a break of 127 years.

Every 10 years Knutsford hosts an international three-hour endurance race for Penny-farthing bicycles.

==Media==

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West, Capital North West &amp; Wales, Heart North West and Cheshire&#x27;s Silk Radio.

The Knutsford Guardian and Knutsford Times are the local newspapers in the town. 

== Culture and community ==

There are many events in and around the town each year including the May Day festivities, The RHS Flower show at Tatton Park and the Cheshire County Show in the parish of Tabley, near Knutsford.

The annual Knutsford Royal May Day festival is where hundreds of people parade through the streets, and the May Queen is crowned. During the May Day weekend there is also a funfair run on ‘The Heath’ (a large field near the centre of Knutsford) where the crowning of the May Queen also takes place) This is said to be one of the largest travelling funfairs in the UK, with a large selection of rides and games to enjoy. 

Local folklore claims that Edward &quot;Highwayman&quot; Higgins had a tunnel running under The Heath, where he hid his booty.

The &quot;Knutsford Guardian&quot;, established in 1860, is the only weekly paid-for paper dedicated to covering the town and its surrounding villages. The newspaper is teamed with the Northwich, Middlewich, and Winsford Guardian.

There is a May Day custom, still observed today, of &quot;sanding the streets&quot; in Knutsford. The streets are decorated with coloured sands in patterns and pictures. Tradition has it that King Cnut, while fording the River Lily, threw sand from his shoes into the path of a wedding party, wishing the newly wed as many children as the grains of sand at their feet. The custom can be traced to the late 1600s. Queen Victoria, in her journal of 1832 recorded: &quot;we arrived at Knutsford, where we were most civilly received, the streets being sanded in shapes which is peculiar to this town&quot;.

Knutsford was the model for Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s novel &quot;Cranford&quot;. She lived in the town for some time, on what is now known as Gaskell Avenue, and she is buried in the Unitarian Chapel graveyard. Many of the places and people described in her books can be identified as being based on places and people in the town. In 2007 the BBC adapted the novel and produced a popular TV series &quot;Cranford&quot;. Despite several references to Knutsford, including &quot;King Street&quot; and &quot;The Heath&quot;, the TV adaptation was actually filmed in Lacock, Wiltshire. Notably, in 1987 Legh Road in Knutsford, designed by Richard Harding Watt, doubled for Colonial Shanghai in the opening scenes from Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot;. A Gaskell protégé who died in Knutsford in 1859 was the once-popular novelist Selina Davenport, who abandoned writing despairingly in 1834 and kept a tiny Knutsford shop instead.

Knutsford Amateur Drama Society was established in 1925 and moved to its premises in Queen Street, Knutsford shortly after the end of the Second World War. Now known by the name of the building it occupies, Knutsford Little Theatre continues to produce a selection of plays each year, including an annual pantomime.

Knutsford Heritage Centre is situated in a 17th-century timber-framed building just off King Street, which was a blacksmith&#x27;s forge in the 19th century. It has a museum, garden, shop and gallery featuring various exhibitions, talks and events, and walking tours are also available. On permanent exhibition are the May Queen&#x27;s dress shoes and crown from 1887.

Scenes from the George C. Scott film &quot;Patton&quot; were filmed in the centre of Knutsford, in front of Knutsford Town Hall. The building was designed by Alfred Waterhouse, and for much of the 20th century was home to Knutsford Boys&#x27; Club and latterly a furniture show room and post office. It is now home to the Lost &amp; Found pub and cocktail bar.

<doc id="155233" wikidata="Q1638101" url="?curid=155233" title="Prong (band)">
<text>Prong is an American heavy metal band formed in New York City in 1986. The band is fronted by guitarist/vocalist Tommy Victor, Prong&#x27;s sole constant member. To date, they have released 13 studio albums (including a covers album), one live album, four EPs, one DVD and one remix album.

Prong had two independent releases, &quot;Primitive Origins&quot; (1987) and &quot;Force Fed&quot; (1989), which attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band in 1989. Their first two albums on Epic, &quot;Beg to Differ&quot; (1990) and &quot;Prove You Wrong&quot; (1991), were released to critical acclaim and garnered attention on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. The band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Cleansing&quot; was also successful, and included their best-known song, &quot;Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck&quot;. After releasing one more album (&quot;Rude Awakening&quot; in 1996), Prong disbanded in 1997, but reformed in 2002 and has continued to tour and record since then.

==History==
===Early days (1986–1989)===
The band was founded in 1986 by singer/guitarist Tommy Victor (then a sound engineer for the New York City music club CBGB) and bassist Mike Kirkland (doorman at CBGB), who recruited ex-Swans drummer Ted Parsons shortly after. Prong independently released an EP, &quot;Primitive Origins&quot;, and a studio album, &quot;Force Fed&quot;, in the late 1980s, which were noted for their very raw sound.

===Major label signing and underground success (1989–1995)===
Prong signed with Epic Records in 1989. Their major label debut album, &quot;Beg to Differ,&quot; was released in 1990.

In the following year, Kirkland left the band and was replaced by bassist Troy Gregory. Prong issued their fourth release, &quot;Prove You Wrong,&quot; which saw the band experiment with programming and electronic samples while still retaining an aggressive yet melodic sensibility.

By 1993, Troy Gregory was out of the band and was replaced by Paul Raven and John Bechdel, both from Killing Joke and Murder, Inc. The new line-up released &quot;Cleansing&quot; (Prong&#x27;s fifth major release) in 1994. With a slight industrial metal influence, &quot;Cleansing&quot; contained songs that are still considered Prong classics (&quot;Broken Peace&quot; and &quot;Snap Your Fingers, Snap Your Neck&quot;) and is Prong&#x27;s most successful release to date. The videos for these two songs became staples of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. The band toured America with Sepultura and Pantera as an opener for their respective &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; and &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; tours. They also undertook a headlining European tour with Life of Agony and The Obsessed as their support.

===Demise (1996–2002)===
Prong&#x27;s 5th album &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; was released in 1996. It entered the charts at No. 107 and sold 10,000 units in the United States in its first week. Despite the good sales, Epic Records released the band from their contract three weeks after the album&#x27;s release. Shortly thereafter, Raven left prior to a tour supporting Type O Negative and was replaced by Rob &quot;Blasko&quot; Nicholson. Mike Riggs later joined on guitar so Victor could focus more on vocals. This line-up later disbanded, with Victor joining Danzig as their guitar player, and Ted Parsons joining Godflesh. Parsons also played with Jesu and toured with Paul Raven in Killing Joke.

===Interim (2002–2006)===
In 2002, Victor reformed Prong with bassist Brian Perry (Dirty Looks, Jake E. Lee), drummer Dan Laudo and guitarist Monte Pittman (Madonna). In 2002, after a 42-date American tour that was recorded for a live CD (&quot;100% Live&quot;, Locomotive Music) Prong entered the studio and recorded their first studio album in seven years, &quot;Scorpio Rising&quot; (2003), which was received with mixed responses.

Victor played on and off again with Glenn Danzig from 1998 to 2005 in between time with Prong. His final goal of playing and writing on a Danzig record was met with &quot;Circle of Snakes&quot; in 2004.

Prong released a live two-disc DVD in 2005 entitled &quot;The Vault&quot; which features performances from the Hulstsfred and With Full Force festivals and a full show in Amsterdam. This disc has Brian Perry and Mike Longworth on bass as Longworth replaced Perry after his departure in 2003. Dan Laudo left the band in 2005 and the band enlisted Aaron Rossi, who used to be in the bands Strife (Victory Records), Shelter (Century Media Records), John 5 (Shrapnel Records), and Ankla (Bieler Bros. Records)

Victor and Rossi joined Ministry in 2005 to write and tour in support of their 2006 album &quot;Rio Grande Blood&quot;. The two also appear on Ministry&#x27;s follow-up album &quot;The Last Sucker&quot; (2007), although in a more limited capacity.

===Reformation (2007–present)===

In 2007, Prong signed to Al Jourgensen&#x27;s 13th Planet Records, who released &quot;Power of the Damager&quot; on October 2, 2007. The band embarked on the &quot;Slicing Across America&quot; and &quot;Slicing Across Europe&quot; tours supporting the album in 2007 and early 2008. Joining Tommy Victor for the tour were Monte Pittman and drummer Aaron Rossi; bassist Paul Raven had died of a heart attack in his sleep on October 20, 2007, at the age of 46.

Rossi joined Ministry as their new drummer on the &quot;C U LaTour&quot; which started in March 2008.

Alexei Rodriguez and Tony Campos from Static-X were on the lineup with Tommy supporting Soulfly on the &quot;Blood Fire War Hate&quot; tour in the fall of 2009. They were replaced by Jason Christopher (bass) in 2011 and Art Cruz (drums) in 2012.

The band supported Fear Factory on their tour which ended on June 6, 2010. Prong released a new album, &quot;Carved into Stone&quot;, on April 23, 2012, with Long Branch Records/SPV. It was produced by Steve Evetts. The band toured as a headliner and with acts such as Crowbar in the US, and in May 2012 performed &quot;Beg to Differ&quot; in its entirety during a two-week tour in Europe.

In the summer of 2013, the band performed an extensive European festival and headline run and also recorded a self-released &quot;Official Bootleg&quot; entitled &quot;Unleashed in the West – Live in Berlin&quot; via Bandcamp.com.

After spending November and December 2013 in the studio, Prong released their ninth album, &quot;Ruining Lives&quot;, on Steamhammer/SPV in April 2014 and toured extensively in its support. Blabbermouth.net called the album &quot;Tommy Victor&#x27;s personal liberation.&quot; The album was produced by Victor and mixed by Steve Evetts.

The band started a second wave of touring behind &quot;Ruining Lives&quot; in July 2014, with European festivals and headline shows. They also toured in North America, both as headliners and as support to Overkill, followed by a tour in Europe as main support to Overkill in October and November.

In 2015, the band released the cover album &quot;Songs from the Black Hole&quot;, followed a year later by their eleventh studio album &quot;X – No Absolutes&quot;. Another album, &quot;Zero Days&quot;, was released in 2017. In 2017, at the beginning of August, they played a concert in Polish Woodstock Festival. Prong&#x27;s next release was the EP &quot;Age of Defiance&quot;, released on November 29, 2019.

The band&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, &quot;State of Emergency&quot;, was released on October 6, 2023.

==Musical style, influences and legacy==
Prong has been described as groove metal, industrial metal, and thrash metal, while their early work has been characterized as crossover thrash. Emerging from the New York hardcore scene, they, along with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura and Machine Head, are one of the bands of the groove metal movement of the 1990s. Prong has cited several bands as influences, including Rush, Bad Brains, Killing Joke, Discharge, Celtic Frost, Voivod, Kreator, Destruction, Metallica, Warzone, the Cro-Mags, Die Kreuzen, and the Sisters of Mercy.

They have influenced many notable musicians such as Korn&#x27;s Jonathan Davis, Demon Hunter&#x27;s Ryan Clark and Nine Inch Nails&#x27; Trent Reznor, as well as bands such as Pantera and White Zombie.

<text>Langley is a semi-rural village in civil parish of Sutton, in the Cheshire East district, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England, on the River Bollin, near Macclesfield and Macclesfield Forest. In 2020 it had an estimated population of 554.

Langley Mill, founded by William Smith in 1826, became the biggest silk printing, dyeing and finishing works in the world. The mill later went on to become Specialised Automobile Services, a specialist wire wheel manufacturer for classic and modern cars.

The painter Charles Tunnicliffe was born in Langley and painted many birds at the four reservoirs behind the village in Macclesfield Forest.

The village pub, The St Dunstan, is located on Main Road (the main road through the village). Langley also has a Methodist church and a village hall.

==In popular culture==
Langley was mentioned in the first episode of the TV series &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, in February 2008, when DI Alex Drake, played by Keeley Hawes, mentions Langley, Virginia, most famous as home to the headquarters of the Central Intelligence Agency. Her colleague, DC Chris Skelton, remarks &quot;isn&#x27;t that near Macclesfield?&quot;. Skelton is played by Macclesfield-born actor Marshall Lancaster.

<text>Beg to Differ is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Prong, released in 1990 through Epic Records. The album includes one live track (&quot;Third from the Sun&quot;, a Chrome cover) recorded at CBGB&#x27;s in New York City in 1989. Brian &quot;Pushead&quot; Schroeder did the design and cover artwork for the album. Part of the song &quot;Lost and Found&quot; was used for commercial breaks of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; in the early 1990s.

&quot;Beg to Differ&quot; was the start of Prong&#x27;s change in music direction, showcasing an experimentation with thrash and speed arrangements and hardcore influences inspired by the likes of Bad Brains and Suicidal Tendencies. The album also stands as one of the earliest examples of the then-emerging subgenre of groove metal, predating Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys from Hell&quot; by four months; this fact was later acknowledged by Prong vocalist and guitarist Tommy Victor, who claimed, &quot;[&quot;Beg to Differ&quot;] was the first groove metal record. It gets overlooked, but I don&#x27;t know who came out with anything before that.&quot;

==Reception==

&quot;Beg to Differ&quot; has received mostly positive reviews. Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic wrote, &quot;Prong&#x27;s once diffuse, post-hardcore rumble solidifies into a tightly disciplined thrash metal attack on their first major label release, &quot;Beg to Differ&quot;. Also a more democratic affair than later efforts, the album finds guitarist Tommy Victor and bassist Mike Kirkland alternating lead vocals as well as writing credits. And drummer Ted Parsons is equally impressive, providing a thunderous rhythmic foundation of Neil Peart-like diversity and precision.&quot;

Adam McCann of Metal Digest referred to &quot;Beg to Differ&quot; as &quot;the superb 1990 album&quot;, and wrote, &quot;When it comes to heavy metal, Prong may just be one of the most underrated and overlooked bands ever. With &quot;Beg to Differ&quot;, Prong delivered riff after riff of not only thrash metal, but thrash with the uptempo pumping riffage of crossover thrash whilst also deliver the meat and potatoes offered from the then burgeoning groove metal scene with both Exhorder and Prong laying the foundations for what would come very, very soon with Pantera&quot;.

<text>St. Charles Parish () is a parish located in the U.S. state of Louisiana. At the 2020 census, its population was 52,549. The parish seat is Hahnville and the most populous community is Luling.

The parish was established in 1807, following the Louisiana Purchase by the United States in 1803. It was originally part of the German Coast, an area along the east bank of the Mississippi River that was settled by numerous German pioneers in the 1720s. This was historically an area of sugarcane plantations, but the energy industry is now the economic base of the parish. St. Charles Parish is split by the Mississippi River and includes territory on both sides of the river, the east and west banks.

St. Charles Parish is included in the New Orleans-Metairie metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
===17th century===
In 1682, French explorers René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti traveled the entire length of the Mississippi River and as their expedition passed what is present-day Hahnville on the west bank; they encountered indigenous Quinipissa villagers. In 1699, Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, along with his younger brother, Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville returned to the area claiming it for France. They found an indigenous Bayagoula settlement near the river&#x27;s intersection with a tributary at a site named &quot;L’Anse aux Outardes&quot; or &quot;Bustard’s Cove&quot; in present-day New Sarpy on the east bank of the Mississippi River. It was discovered that the Quinapissa had joined the indigenous Mougoulacha and they later moved to the east bank of the river to form one village with the Bayougoula near L’Anse aux Outardes.

===18th century===
As early as 1718, John Law and the Company of the Indies began recruiting French settlers to settle Louisiana (New France), though not specifically to what would become the German Coast. The early French settlers were not suited or prepared for the harsh conditions in Louisiana. In 1719, Jean-Pierre Pury, a director at the Company of the Indies, proposed recruiting Germans and German-speaking Swiss farmers to Louisiana and that same year with a twenty-five-year charter, Law merged the Company of the West with his Company of the Indies. Also in 1719, a small group of German settlers arrived in the Louisiana French colony and were transported by waterways thirty miles west of New Orleans to a location along the west bank of the Mississippi River, north of Ouachas Lake. This area of German settlers was called &quot;les Allemands&quot; or &quot;the Germans&quot;.

In 1720, Germans were recruited in early spring to settle in &quot;les Allemands&quot;. Roughly four thousand individuals (four hundred and fifty families) mostly from the Rhineland, but also from Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Swedish Pomerania, Alsace–Lorraine, Belgium, and Switzerland traveled across France to Lorient in Brittany and then made the voyage to Louisiana on March 7, 1721. The settlers arrived in Old Biloxi on June 4, 1721, and on December 15, 1721, French Governor Bienville issued an order for boats to transport the recently arrived German-speaking settlers including newly named Commandant Charles Frederic d&#x27;Arensbourg, born Karl Friedrich von Arensburg, to the already established villages of Hoffen, Marienthal, and Augsburg on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The settlers left for the settlements in January 1722 and of the roughly four thousand individuals that initially began the trip in Europe, when they reached their port of embarkation in March 1722, a Company of the Indies official counted only three hundred and thirty settlers because many of them perished due to the harsh conditions of their long journey to Louisiana. d&#x27;Arensbourg&#x27;s land grant concession on the west bank of the river near present-day Taft, was named Karlstein after him and with its founding, the original four settlements in &quot;les Allemands&quot; were established. Besides the area being named &quot;les Allemands&quot;, the collective name that the settlements were sometimes referred to as was Karlstein, also after Charles Frédérique d&#x27;Arensbourg or Karl Friedrich von Arensburg, who was the acknowledged leader of the settlements for more than 55 years.
Over time, &quot;les Allemands&quot; would come to be known as &quot;Côté des Allemands&quot; or &quot;German Coast&quot; and is located in present-day St. Charles and St. John the Baptist Parishes. The German Coast Settlement established in 1722 was the third permanent settlement in what is now the state of Louisiana, after Natchitoches (1714) and New Orleans (1718).

Also in 1722, the &quot;La Grand Ouragan&quot; Hurricane devastated the German Coast and many Germans considered leaving. In order to prevent this exodus, Governor Bienville decided to grant the settlement of additional lands to settlers on the west bank in addition to the east bank of the river. Later in 1722 and 1723, some French and German settlers along with newly arrived Canadians moved across the Mississippi River to establish the first east bank settlement at &quot;L’Anse aux Outardes&quot; or &quot;Bustard’s Cove&quot;. The tributary at this site connected the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain via a previously discovered system of waterways through the LaBranche Wetlands. The ecclesiastical parish and chapel, La Paroisse de St. Jean des Allemands, was also founded in 1723 in Karlstein.
A 1724 census revealed that the German families were not only harvesting enough food and raising enough cattle for their families, but they were bringing their surplus to New Orleans markets. It is apparent from these records that from the beginning of their settlement, German Coast farmers were a major source of food for the city of New Orleans.

The granting of additional lands in 1722 and 1723, led to the founding of the &quot;Second German Coast&quot; in 1730 and the establishment of officially having settlements on both banks of the Mississippi River. The year 1729 saw the first attack by Native Americans on the German villages. In 1731, as the first decade of settlement on the German Coast ended and the Company of the Indies charter was retrieved by France, Louisiana again became a French colony. The land farmed by settlers on the German Coast technically belonged to the Company of the Indies until France retrieved its charter. After France once again owned the land, more landholders began to petition France for individual ownership of property.

In 1740, the ecclesiastical parish and chapel relocated to the present-day site of the church in Destrehan on the east bank of the Mississippi River. A log cabin structure was built and both the ecclesiastical parish and chapel were renamed St. Charles in honor of St. Charles Borromeo.

The Territory of Louisiana remained under French rule until 1763, when France ceded Louisiana to Spain after losing the Seven Years&#x27; War to Great Britain. The French and Indian War was a North American theater of this war. At the beginning of the Spanish colonial period, many Acadians, people of French descent, began arriving in south Louisiana after being expelled by the British from what is now Nova Scotia after the British took over French territory in Canada along with North American territory east of the Mississippi river. The first French Acadian village was established in present-day Wallace in the German Coast. The Germanic settlers of the German Coast and French Acadians of what would become Acadiana thrived alongside each another with French becoming the dominant language. The intermingling and marriage between these two groups and influence from additional groups and cultures led to the formation of what was to become Louisiana Cajun culture.

The early 18th century settlers in the area received land grants from the Spanish or French royal governments, depending upon which country ruled the territory at the time of application. The French style of property allotments was made up of narrow frontage on the river so that each plantation had access to high ground for ground transportation of goods to and from New Orleans and world markets. In addition to ground transportation, goods were mainly shipped by boat on bayous and lakes and also via the Mississippi River. The main house and supporting outbuildings were constructed near the river. The remaining property extended away from the river into the wetlands, where land was cleared for cultivation of sugar cane and indigo. Homes still existing in St. Charles Parish include Destrehan Plantation, Homeplace Plantation House, and Ormond Plantation House. Labranche Plantation no longer exists, but the Creole dependency house, known in French as a garconnière still exists.

===19th century===
In 1800, Napoleon, the First Consul of the French Republic, regained control over Louisiana for France. Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Territory of Orleans was established in 1804 and the following year on April 10, 1805, it was divided into twelve counties with one of them being the County of the German Coast. The first courthouse was established in 1804, in a community then known as “St. Charles Courthouse&quot;. The town was later renamed Hahnville and became the parish seat.

In 1806, the log cabin St. Charles Chapel in Destrehan burned. That same year, a wood-framed church painted red was built at the site of the former chapel. The church became known as the &quot;Little Red Church&quot;. It was a famous riverboat landmark where boat captains traditionally paid off their crews.

In 1807, St. Charles Parish was &quot;officially&quot; established. In 1811, part of the German Coast uprising took place in St. Charles Parish. The first two public schools in St. Charles Parish opened in 1850.

During the American Civil War, three skirmishes took place in St. Charles Parish. They were the &quot;Battle of Hahnville Courthouse&quot;, &quot;Skirmish of Boutte Station&quot; and the &quot;Battle of Des Allemands&quot;. Louisiana and therefore St. Charles Parish were part of the Fifth Military District during the Reconstruction era from 1865 to 1877.

Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Catholic Church was originally built in 1877 in Taft.

Towards the end of 19th century, ferry regulation throughout the parish would now be implemented with parish oversight.

===20th century===
Starting in the 20th century, the area of the German Coast and location of the first permanent settlement of Acadians in Louisiana began to be referred to as the &quot;River Parishes&quot;. The River Parishes are those parishes in Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that span both banks of the Mississippi River, and are part of the larger Acadiana region. Traditionally they are considered to be St. Charles Parish, St. James Parish, and St. John the Baptist Parish.

Industry came to St. Charles Parish in the early 20th century as the energy industry moved to the east bank of the parish to access the Mississippi River, rail and air services. In 1914, land in Destrehan was sold to the Mexican Petroleum Company, which began operating an oil refinery in 1918, marking the first appearance of heavy industry in the parish. In 1916, the New Orleans Refining Company purchased land in what was then Sellers, leading to the town to be renamed Norco. Additional industrial facilities in the energy industry or supporting the industry were built in New Sarpy, Good Hope, and St. Rose.

In 1921, the &quot;Little Red Church&quot; burned and St. Charles Borromeo Church was built on the property that same year with the formal dedication taking place on January 25, 1922.

In 1924, the first public high schools in the parish opened. Destrehan High School opened on the east bank and Hahnville High School opened on the west bank of the parish.

Since the establishment of the German Coast, levees were the responsibility of landowners and breaches in these levees called &quot;crevasses&quot; were always a major concern due to the extensive flooding they caused. Previous crevasses in the areas of Hymelia and Bonnet Carré caused extensive damage to the area. Another crevasse during the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 between the towns of Montz and LaPlace badly damaged Montz. Flood Control Acts had previously been passed, but because of the size of the devastation in Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, authorization of the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project in the Flood Control Act of 1928 was passed. The act called for the “levees only” policy that failed to be discarded and allowed for improved levees and floodways or &quot;spillways&quot; to be built.

Between 1929 and 1931, the Bonnet Carré Spillway, a flood control structure was built and allows floodwaters from the Mississippi River to flow into Lake Pontchartrain. This site was chosen because four major crevasses had previously occurred at this location.

The first appearance of industry on the west bank came in 1952 when the Lion Oil Company began construction of their facility in Luling. In 1955, Royal Dutch Shell opened the Shell Chemical Plant in Norco after their forerunner, Shell Petroleum Corporation, previously acquired the New Orleans Refining Company oil refinery in 1929.

The 1960s saw a new industry come to St. Charles Parish as grain elevators were built in Ama and Destrehan. Additionally, chemical plants were built in Taft in the 1960s. In 1963, Our Lady of the Holy Rosary Catholic Church moved to Hahnville with the building being completed in 1964.

In 1971, the Louisiana State Legislature officially recognized 22 Louisiana parishes, including St. Charles Parish, and &quot;other parishes of similar cultural environment&quot; for their &quot;strong French Acadian cultural aspects&quot; (House Concurrent Resolution No. 496, June 6, 1971, authored by Carl W. Bauer of St. Mary Parish), and made the &quot;Heart of Acadiana&quot; the official name of the region. The public, however, prefers the one-word place name &quot;Acadiana&quot; to refer to the region. The official term appears on regional maps and highway markers.

On October 20, 1976, the MV George Prince ferry disaster occurred on the Mississippi River. The Luling–Destrehan Ferry &quot;George Prince&quot; was struck by the Norwegian tanker . Ninety-six passengers and crew were aboard the ferry when it was struck, and seventy-eight perished. On October 6, 1983, seven-years after the ferry disaster, the Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge opened. The bridge, originally named the Luling–Destrehan Bridge, connected the east bank and west bank of the parish by bridge for the first time. 1983 also saw the end of ferry service in the parish, marking the first time since the 1800s this service was not available.

In 1985, the Louisiana Power and Light Company began operation of the Waterford Nuclear Generating Station on Charles Frédérique d&#x27;Arensbourg&#x27;s original land grant of Karlstein.

===21st century===
On September 5, 2000, the town of Good Hope was annexed by Norco. This was the eventual result of a 1983 buyout of all residential and commercial property by Good Hope Refinery; the town is listed as a ghost town. Also in 2000, Taft had a population of zero residents and is now also listed as a ghost town.

On March 26, 2002, the Davis Pond Freshwater Diversion Project dedication ceremony was held near Luling after construction began on the project in 1997. In 2007, the East Bank Hurricane Protection Levee was completed. The levee protects the majority of the east bank from Lake Pontchartrain and Labranche Wetlands flood waters.

On August 29, 2021, St. Charles Parish was devastated by Hurricane Ida. Parish President Matthew Jewel stated that &quot;Nearly every structure in the parish has damage ranging from cosmetic damage to a total collapse of a home or building.&quot;

<text>Prove You Wrong is an album by American heavy metal band Prong, released in 1991. It is their only album with Troy Gregory on bass guitar. The album includes a cover of &quot;(Get A) Grip (On Yourself)&quot;, originally by The Stranglers.

&quot;Prove You Wrong&quot; continued the experimentation with groove metal that began on Prong&#x27;s previous album &quot;Beg to Differ&quot;, toning down much of the hardcore punk elements from their 1980s output in favor of a more experimental sound that was influenced by alternative, thrash metal, funk, progressive and industrial music.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that Prong &quot;combines postindustrial noise, a rebellious punk mentality, and heavy-metal flourishes and, with a minimalist approach that is anything but simplistic, strips them all down to a brutal essence.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote: &quot;While the trio’s devotion to precisely lurching rhythms keeps the songs choppy—a clenched fist twitching spasmodically as it prepares to deliver a haymaker—this dull record makes that attribute part of a tentative shift toward industrial anti-musicality.&quot;

<text>Sir Paul Brierley Smith (born 5 July 1946) is an English luxury fashion designer. His reputation is founded on his designs for men&#x27;s clothing, but his business has expanded into other areas as well. Smith was made a Royal Designer for Industry in 1991.

His eponymous fashion company was founded in 1970 and has expanded into over 70 countries, selling products via stores, malls, and airport terminals, together with a website e-commerce section. His brand&#x27;s fluorescent pink flagship store in Los Angeles is a tourist destination for people who want to take selfies.

== Early life ==



Smith was born in 1946 in Beeston, Nottinghamshire, England, the son of Harold Smith, and is the youngest of three children. One of his early ambitions was to become a professional cyclist. He left school at the age of 15 to work in a Nottingham clothing warehouse, while practising cycling outside of work hours. He cycled to and from work until the age of 17, when he was in a major cycling accident that put him in hospital for close to six months. During his recovery, friends inspired him to enter the world of art and fashion. Smith has regularly referenced cycling in his work over the years.
He started to take classes in tailoring and eventually began working with a Savile Row tailor, Lincroft Kilgour.

== Career ==
Smith opened his own shop, Paul Smith Vêtements Pour Homme, in Nottingham in 1970, selling established clothing labels, alongside Smith&#x27;s own designs. The shop, located at 6 Byard Lane in Nottingham, was just three square metres floor area.

In 1976, Smith travelled to Paris to showcase his first men&#x27;s collection, which featured a mix of casual and semi-formal wear. After that the Paul Smith brand continued to grow and he opened his flagship London store in 1979 on Floral Street in Covent Garden, London.

&#x27;Paul Smith Women&#x27;, his first womenswear collection, was launched in 1993, after reports of women coming into his stores buying smaller sizes to wear themselves.

The first Japan store opened in Tokyo in 1984, growing over the years to 165 stores across the country.

Smith opened a shop in New York City on Fifth Avenue in 1987, expanding four shops including the flagship on Greene Street as well as Williamsburg, Bleecker Street and Brookfield Place.

In 1993, Smith took over 1885-established &#x27;workwear&#x27; clothing company R. Newbold, and incorporated many of their designs into his new collection.

His childrenswear collection started in 1990 with the launch of a one-off collection for boys, including casual and tailored pieces. In 2010, Smith launched &#x27;Paul Smith Junior&#x27; as a seasonal collection which often included remakes of his adult collections.

In 1995, the Design Museum exhibited &#x27;True Brit&#x27;, a show marking 25 years of his business. The show then went on to Glasgow for the &#x27;Festival of Design&#x27; and then moved to his hometown of Nottingham and was put on display in Nottingham Castle.

Smith published his first book, &quot;You Can Find Inspiration in Everything&quot;, in 2001. 
The brand launched its e-commerce site in 2004. In 2013, Smith designed and made a school tie for Beeston Fields Primary School in Nottingham.

In 2016, Smith&#x27;s second book, &quot;Paul Smith&#x27;s Cycling Scrapbook&quot;, was released: it documents a personal history of the sport about which he is passionate. In January 2016, Smith combined his men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fashion shows, showcasing during Paris Fashion Week.

In 2019, Smith made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Men in Black: International&quot;; he also designed the suits in the film.

The company remains majority-owned by Smith. In 2006 Itochu bought a 40% stake in Paul Smith.
