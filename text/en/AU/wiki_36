<text>Christian IV (12 April 1577 – 28 February 1648) was King of Denmark and Norway and Duke of Holstein and Schleswig from 1588 until his death in 1648. His reign of 59 years and 330 days is the longest in Scandinavian history.

A member of the House of Oldenburg, Christian began his personal rule of Denmark-Norway in 1596 at the age of 19. He is remembered as one of the most popular, ambitious, and proactive Danish-Norwegian kings, having initiated many reforms and projects. Christian IV obtained for his kingdoms a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in Europe. He engaged Denmark-Norway in numerous wars, most notably the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), which devastated much of Germany, undermined the Danish economy, and cost Denmark-Norway some of its conquered territories.
He rebuilt and renamed the Norwegian capital Oslo as &quot;Christiania&quot; after himself, a name used until 1925.

==Early years ==

=== Birth and family ===
Christian was born at Frederiksborg Castle in Denmark on 12 April 1577 as the third child and eldest son of King Frederick II of Denmark–Norway and Sofie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. He was descended, through his mother&#x27;s side, from King John of Denmark, and was thus the first descendant of King John to assume the crown since the deposition of King Christian II.

At the time, Denmark was still an elective monarchy, so in spite of being the eldest son Christian was not automatically heir to the throne. But Norway was a hereditary monarchy, and electing someone else would result in the end of the union of the crowns. However, in 1580, at the age of 3, his father had him elected Prince and successor to the throne of Denmark.

=== Young king ===
At the death of his father on 4 April 1588, Christian was just 10 years old. He succeeded to the throne, but as he was still under-age a regency council was set up to serve as the trustees of the royal power while Christian was still growing up. It was led by chancellor Niels Kaas (1535–1594) and consisted of the &quot;Rigsraadet&quot; council members Peder Munk (1534–1623), Jørgen Ottesen Rosenkrantz (1523–1596) and Christoffer Valkendorff (1525–1601). His mother Queen Dowager Sophie, 30 years old, had wished to play a role in the government, but was denied by the council. At the death of Niels Kaas in 1594, Jørgen Rosenkrantz took over leadership of the regency council.

=== Coming of age and coronation ===
Christian continued his studies at Sorø Academy where he had a reputation as a headstrong and talented student.

In 1595, the Council of the Realm decided that Christian would soon be old enough to assume personal control of the reins of government. On 17 August 1596, at the age of 19, Christian signed his haandfæstning (lit. &quot;Handbinding&quot; viz. curtailment of the monarch&#x27;s power, a Danish parallel to Magna Carta), which was an identical copy of his father&#x27;s from 1559.

Twelve days later, on 29 August 1596, Christian IV was crowned at the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen by the Bishop of Zealand, Peder Jensen Vinstrup (1549–1614). He was crowned with a new Danish Crown Regalia which had been made for him by Dirich Fyring (1580–1603), assisted by the Nuremberg goldsmith, Corvinius Saur.

=== Marriage ===
On 30 November 1597, he married Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, a daughter of Joachim Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia.

==Reign ==
===Military and economic reforms===
Christian took an interest in many and varied matters, including a series of domestic reforms and improving Danish national armaments. New fortresses were constructed under the direction of Dutch engineers. The Royal Dano-Norwegian Navy, which in 1596 had consisted of but twenty-two vessels, in 1610 rose to sixty, some of them built after Christian&#x27;s own designs. The formation of a national army proved more difficult. Christian had to depend mainly upon hired mercenary troops as was common practice in the times—well before the establishment of standing armies—augmented by native peasant levies recruited for the most part from the peasantry on the crown domains.

Up until the early 1620s, Denmark-Norway&#x27;s economy profited from general boom conditions in Europe. This inspired Christian to initiate a policy of expanding Denmark-Norway&#x27;s overseas trade as part of the mercantilist wave fashionable in Europe. He founded a number of merchant cities, and supported the building of factories. He also built a large number of buildings in Dutch Renaissance style.

===Visits to England===
His sister Anne had married King James VI of Scotland, who succeeded to the English throne in 1603. To foster friendly relations between the two kingdoms, Christian paid a state visit to England in 1606. The visit was generally judged to be a success, although the heavy drinking indulged in by English and Danes alike caused some unfavourable comments: both Christian and James had an ability to consume great amounts of alcohol, while remaining lucid, which most of their courtiers did not share. Sir John Harington described an entertainment at Theobalds, a masque of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, as a drunken fiasco, where most of the players simply fell over from the effects of too much wine. The royal party went to Upnor Castle and had dinner aboard the &quot;Elizabeth Jonas&quot;. At Gravesend, when the royal party was on his ship the &quot;Admiral&quot;, Christian IV provided a firework display built on a small ship or lighter, which brought tears to eyes of King James, although the effect was somewhat spoiled because the show was held in daylight. After an exchange of gifts Christian sailed home, escorted by Robert Mansell with the &quot;Vanguard&quot; and the &quot;Moon&quot;.

Christian IV visited England again in August 1614, coming incognito to surprise his sister at Denmark House, accompanied only by Andrew Sinclair and a page. Christian IV was recognised by the queen&#x27;s dancing master Thomas Cardell and a French servant. He had sailed with only three ships and captured some pirates during the voyage. More ships with his Danish courtiers arrived on 5 August. The diplomatic purpose of the visit was kept secret. The Venetian ambassador Antonio Foscarini heard that Anne of Denmark had written to him about a dispute with King James. Foscarini described Christian as, &quot;above the average in height, dressed in the French fashion. His nature is warlike&quot;.

===Exploration and colonies===
Despite Christian&#x27;s many efforts, the new economic projects did not return a profit. He looked abroad for new income. Christian IV&#x27;s Expeditions to Greenland involved a series of voyages in the years 1605–1607 to Greenland and to Arctic waterways in order to locate the lost Eastern Norse Settlement and to assert Danish sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were unsuccessful, partly due to leaders lacking experience with the difficult Arctic ice and weather conditions. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer James Hall. An expedition to North America was commissioned in 1619. The expedition was captained by Dano-Norwegian navigator and explorer, Jens Munk. The ships, searching for the Northwest Passage, arrived in Hudson Bay landing at the mouth of Churchill River, settling at what is now Churchill, Manitoba. However, it was a disastrous voyage, with cold, famine, and scurvy killing most of the crew.

In 1618, Christian appointed Admiral Ove Gjedde to lead an expedition and establish a Danish colony in Ceylon. The expedition set sail in 1618, taking two years to reach Ceylon and losing more than half their crew on the way. Upon arriving in May 1620, the establishment of a colony in Ceylon failed, but instead the &quot;Nayak&quot; of Tanjore (now Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu) turned out to be interested in trading opportunities and a treaty was negotiated granting the Danes the village of Tranquebar (or Tarangamabadi) on India&#x27;s south coast and the right to construct a &quot;stone house&quot; (Fort Dansborg) and levy taxes. The treaty was signed on 20 November 1620, establishing Denmark&#x27;s first colony in India. Christian also assigned the privilege establishing the Danish East India Company.

===Kalmar War===

In 1611, he first put his newly organised army to use. Despite the reluctance of &quot;Rigsrådet&quot;, Christian initiated a war with Sweden for the supremacy of the Baltic Sea. It was later known as the Kalmar War because its chief operation was the Danish capture of Kalmar, the southernmost fortress of Sweden. Christian compelled King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden to give way on all essential points at the resulting Treaty of Knäred of 20 January 1613. However, despite Denmark&#x27;s greater strength, the gains of the war were not decisive.

He now turned his attention to the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany. Here, his objectives were twofold: first, to obtain control of the great German rivers—the Elbe and the Weser—as a means of securing his dominion of the northern seas; and secondly, to acquire the secularised German Archdiocese of Bremen and Prince-Bishopric of Verden as appanages for his younger sons. He skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the German Protestants after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, to secure co-adjutorship of the See of Bremen for his son Frederick (September 1621). A similar arrangement was reached in November at Verden. Hamburg was also induced to acknowledge the Danish overlordship of Holstein by the compact of Steinburg in July 1621.

===Thirty Years&#x27; War===
Christian IV had obtained for his kingdom a level of stability and wealth that was virtually unmatched elsewhere in Europe. Denmark was funded by tolls on the Øresund and also by extensive war-reparations from Sweden. Denmark&#x27;s intervention in the Thirty Years&#x27; War was aided by France and by Charles I of England, who agreed to help subsidise the war partly because Christian was the uncle of both the Stuart king and his sister Elizabeth of Bohemia through their mother, Anne of Denmark. Some 13,700 Scottish soldiers were to be sent as allies to help Christian IV under the command of General Robert Maxwell, 1st Earl of Nithsdale. Moreover, some 6000 English troops under Sir Charles Morgan also eventually arrived to bolster the defence of Denmark though it took longer for these to arrive than Christian hoped, not least due to the ongoing British campaigns against France and Spain. Thus Christian, as war-leader of the Lower Saxon Circle, entered the war with an army of only 20,000 mercenaries, some of his allies from Britain and a national army 15,000 strong, leading them as Duke of Holstein rather than as King of Denmark.

Despite the growing power of Roman Catholics in North Germany, and the threat to the Danish holdings in the Schleswig-Holstein duchies, Christian for a time stayed his hand. The urgent solicitations of other powers, and his fear that Gustavus Adolphus should supplant him as the champion of the Protestant cause, finally led him to enter the war on 9 May 1625. He also feared that Sweden could use a war to further expand their holdings in the Baltic Sea. Christian embarked on a military campaign which was later known in Denmark and Norway as &quot;The Emperor War&quot; (, ).

He had at his disposal from 19,000 to 25,000 people, and at first gained some successes but on 27 August 1626 he was routed by Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly in the Battle of Lutter. Christian had not thoroughly planned the advance against the combined forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and the Catholic League, as promises of military support from the Netherlands and England did not materialise. In the summer of 1627 both Tilly and Albrecht von Wallenstein occupied the duchies and the whole peninsula of Jutland.

Christian now formed an alliance with Sweden on 1 January 1628, as he and Gustavus Adolphus shared the reluctance of German expansion in the Baltic region. Gustavus Adolphus pledged to assist Denmark with a fleet in case of need, and shortly afterwards a Swedo-Danish army and fleet compelled Wallenstein to raise the siege of Stralsund. Thus with the help of Sweden, the superior sea-power enabled Denmark to tide over her worst difficulties, and in May 1629 Christian was able to conclude peace with the emperor in the Treaty of Lübeck, without any diminution of territory. However, the treaty bound Christian not to interfere in the Thirty Years&#x27; War any further, removing any Danish obstacles when Gustavus Adolphus entered the war in 1630.

===Containment of Sweden===

Christian&#x27;s foreign policy did not suffer from lack of confidence following the Danish defeat in The Thirty Years&#x27; War. To compensate for lacking export revenues, and also in order to stifle the Swedish advances in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Christian enacted a number of increases in the Sound Dues throughout the 1630s. Christian gained both in popularity and influence at home, and he hoped to increase his external power still further with the assistance of his sons-in-law, Corfitz Ulfeldt and Hannibal Sehested, who now came prominently forward.

Between 1629 and 1643 the European situation presented infinite possibilities to politicians with a taste for adventure. However, Christian was incapable of a consistent diplomatic policy. He would neither conciliate Sweden, henceforth his most dangerous enemy, nor guard himself against her by a definite system of counter-alliances. Christian contacted the Roman Catholic part of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, and offered to broker a deal with Sweden. However, his mediating was highly skewed in favour of the Holy Roman Emperor, and was a transparent attempt at minimising the Swedish influence in the Baltics. His Scandinavian policy was so irritating and vexatious that Swedish statesmen advocated for a war with Denmark, to keep Christian from interfering in the peace negotiations with the Holy Roman Emperor, and in May 1643, Christian faced another war against Sweden. The increased Sound Dues had alienated the Dutch, who turned to support Sweden.

===Torstenson War===

Sweden was able, thanks to their conquests in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, to attack Denmark from the south as well as the east; the Dutch alliance promised to secure them at sea. In May 1643 the Swedish Privy Council decided upon war; on 12 December the Swedish Field Marshal Lennart Torstensson, advancing from Bohemia, crossed the southern frontier of Denmark; and by the end of January 1644 the whole peninsula of Jutland was in Swedish hands. This unexpected attack, conducted from first to last with consummate ability and lightning-like rapidity, had a paralysing effect upon Denmark.

In his sixty-sixth year he once more displayed something of the energy of his triumphant youth. Night and day he laboured to levy armies and equip fleets. Fortunately for him, the Swedish government delayed hostilities in Scania until February 1644, and the Danes were able to make adequate defensive preparations and save the important fortress of Malmö. The Danish fleet prevented Torstensson crossing from Jutland to Funen, and defeated the Dutch auxiliary fleet which came to Torstensson&#x27;s assistance at the action of 16 May 1644. Another attempt to transport Torstensson and his army to the Danish islands by a large Swedish fleet was frustrated by Christian IV in person on 1 July 1644. On that day the two fleets encountered at the Battle of Colberger Heide. As Christian stood on the quarterdeck of the &quot;Trinity&quot;, a cannon close by was exploded by a Swedish cannonball, and splinters of wood and metal wounded the king in thirteen places, blinding one eye and flinging him to the deck. But he was instantly on his feet again, cried with a loud voice that it was well with him, and set every one an example of duty by remaining on deck until the fight was over. Darkness at last separated the contending fleets; and the battle was drawn.

The Danish fleet subsequently blockaded the Swedish ships in the Bay of Kiel. But the Swedish fleet escaped, and the annihilation of the Danish fleet by the combined navies of Sweden and the Netherlands, after an obstinate fight between Fehmarn and Lolland at the end of September, exhausted the military resources of Denmark and compelled Christian to accept the mediation of France and the Netherlands; and peace was finally signed with the Treaty of Brömsebro on 8 February 1645. Here Denmark had to cede Gotland, Ösel and (for thirty years) Halland, while Norway lost the two provinces Jämtland and Härjedalen, giving Sweden the supremacy of the Baltic Sea.

===Norwegian issue===

Christian IV spent more time in the kingdom of Norway than any other Oldenburg monarch and no Oldenburg king made such a lasting impression on the Norwegian people. He visited the country a number of times and founded four cities. He also established and took control over one silver mine (Kongsberg), one copper mine (Røros in Trøndelag), and tried to make an iron plant with limited success in Eiker. In 1647 he gave the crown privileges of the Røros Copper Works to his banker and his privy councillor (Geheimrat) Joachim Irgens von Westervick, including rights to forests and water resources within a circle of diameter 90 kilometers. Christian also restored and restructured the castle Akershus, where he invited the people of Norway to the official and age-old installment of the king in 1590, and again in 1610.

When the king was busy overseeing the reparations and re-building of the fortress at Oslo, he lived in the country all summer, and at the same time tried to establish a centre for producing iron at Eiker in Buskerud. History tells he actually ruled the entire kingdom from this area in the summer of 1603.

In 1623, Christian again visited Norway for an entire summer, this time to oversee the foundation of Kongsberg. He was also present in the area in 1624, when Oslo burned in August of that year. The king was able to reach the area in a few weeks, being in Eiker. Over the years, fire had destroyed major parts of the city many times, as many of the city&#x27;s buildings were built entirely of wood. After the fire in 1624 which lasted for three days, Christian IV decided that the old city should not be rebuilt again. He decided that the new town be rebuilt in the area below Akershus Fortress, a castle which later was converted into a palace and royal residence. His men built a network of roads in Akershagen and demanded that all citizens should move their shops and workplaces to the newly built city of Christiania.

===Securing the Northern Lands under the Danish-Norwegian Crown===
During the fourteenth century the Swedish kings tried to push the areas of their control towards the north, and contemporary maps depicted the now Norwegian coastal areas of Troms and Finnmark as a part of Sweden. The possibly boldest move of any Danish-Norwegian regent was to make a voyage to the Northern Lands to secure these lands under the Danish-Norwegian crown.

===Last years and death===
After the Torstenson War, &quot;Rigsrådet&quot; took on an increasing role, under the leadership of Corfitz Ulfeldt and Hannibal Sehested. The last years of Christian&#x27;s life were embittered by sordid differences with his sons-in-law, especially with Corfitz Ulfeldt.

His personal obsession with witchcraft led to the public execution of some of his subjects during the Burning Times. He was responsible for several witch burnings, including 21 people in Iceland, and most notably the conviction and execution of Maren Spliid, who was victim of a witch hunt at Ribe and was burned at the Gallows Hill near Ribe on 9 November 1641.

On 21 February 1648, at his earnest request, he was carried in a litter from Frederiksborg to his beloved Copenhagen, where he died a week later. He was buried in Roskilde Cathedral. The chapel of Christian IV had been completed 6 years before the King died.

==Cultural king==
Christian was reckoned a typical renaissance king, and excelled in hiring musicians and artists from all over Europe. Many English musicians were employed by him at several times, among them William Brade, John Bull and John Dowland. Dowland accompanied the king on his tours, and as he was employed in 1603, rumour has it he was in Norway as well. Christian was an agile dancer, and his court was reckoned the second most &quot;musical&quot; court in Europe, only ranking behind that of Elizabeth I of England. Christian maintained good contact with his sister Anne, who was married to King James. Christian asked Anne to request for him the services of Thomas Cutting, a lutenist employed by Arbella Stewart. His other sister, Elizabeth, was married to the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and artists and musicians travelled freely between the courts.

==City foundations==
Christian IV is renowned for his many city (town) foundations, and is most likely the Nordic head of state that can be accredited for the highest number of new cities in his realm. These towns/cities are:
* Christianopel, now Kristianopel in Sweden. Founded in 1599 in the then Danish territory of Blekinge as a garrison town near the then Danish-Swedish border.
* Christianstad, now Kristianstad in Sweden. Founded in 1614 in the then Danish territory of Skåne.
* Glückstadt, now in Germany, founded in 1617 as a rival to Hamburg in the then Danish territory of Holstein.
* Christianshavn, now part of Copenhagen, Denmark, founded as a fortification/garrison town in 1619. It also houses Freetown Christiania, a planned commune.
* &quot;Konningsberg&quot; (King&#x27;s Mountain), now Kongsberg in Norway, founded as an industrial town in 1624 after the discovery of silver ores.
* Christiania, now Oslo in Norway. After a devastating fire in 1624 the king ordered the old city of Oslo to be moved closer to the fortification of Akershus slot and also renamed it Christiania. The city name was altered to Kristiania in 1877 and then back to Oslo in 1924. The original town of Christian is now known as &quot;Kvadraturen&quot; = &quot;The Quarters&quot;.
* Christian(s)sand, now Kristiansand in Norway, founded in 1641 to promote trade at the in Southern Norway.
* Røros, now in Norway, founded as an industrial town after the discovery of copper ores.

A short-lived town was:
* Christianspris, now in Schleswig, Germany, founded as a garrison town near Kiel in the then Danish territory of Holstein.

Furthermore, Christian is known for erecting many important buildings in his realm, including the observatory Rundetårn, the stock exchange Børsen, the Copenhagen fortress Kastellet, Rosenborg Castle, workers&#x27; district Nyboder&quot;,&quot; the Copenhagen naval Holmen Church (Holmens Kirke), Proviantgården, a brewery, the Tøjhus Museum arsenal, and two Trinity Churches in Copenhagen and modern Kristianstad, now known as respectively Trinitatis Church and Holy Trinity Church. Christian converted Frederiksborg Castle to a Renaissance palace and completely rebuilt Kronborg Castle to a fortress. He also founded the Danish East India Company (&quot;Asiatisk Kompagni&quot;) inspired by the similar Dutch company.

==Legacy==

Christian is the longest-reigning monarch in Scandinavian history in terms of holding the title. However, the Danish Royal House recognized Margrethe II as having the official record in July 2023. The Danish Royal House noted that Christian IV was not of the legal age to become King upon his father&#x27;s death, which resulted in a &quot;guardian government&quot; being installed until he was officially installed as King in 1596. When Christian was crowned king, Denmark-Norway held a supremacy over the Baltic Sea, which he lost to Sweden. Nevertheless, Christian was one of the few kings from the House of Oldenburg that achieved a lasting legacy of popularity with both the Danish and Norwegian people. As such, he featured in the Danish national play &quot;Elverhøj&quot;. Furthermore, his great building activities also furthered his popularity.

Christian IV spoke Danish, German, Latin, French and Italian. Naturally cheerful and hospitable, he delighted in lively society; but he was also passionate, irritable and sensual. He had courage, a vivid sense of duty, an indefatigable love of work, and all the inquisitive zeal and inventive energy of a born reformer. His own pleasure, whether it took the form of love or ambition, was always his first consideration. His capacity for drink was proverbial: when he visited England in 1606, even the notoriously hard-drinking English Court were astonished by his alcohol consumption. In the heyday of his youth his high spirits and passion for adventure enabled him to surmount every obstacle with elan. But in the decline of life he reaped the bitter fruits of his lack of self-control, and sank into the grave a weary and brokenhearted old man.

The Christian IV Glacier in Greenland is named after him.

===In fiction===
*Christian IV is depicted as a brilliant but hard-drinking monarch in the Eric Flint and David Weber alternate-history novels &quot;1634: The Baltic War&quot; and &quot;1637: No Peace Beyond the Line&quot;.
*Christian IV is featured several times in the book series &quot;The Legend of the Ice People&quot;.
*Christian IV also features prominently in the novel &quot;Music and Silence&quot; by Rose Tremain, which is primarily set in and around the Danish court in the years 1629 and 1630.
*Christian IV is depicted as a foul-natured person, but a good king who did a lot to make his realm flourish, by the Danish alternative music band Mew in their song, &quot;King Christian&quot;.
*Christian IV (Danish title: Christian IV – Den sidste rejse (2018) is a biographical movie, focusing on His Majesty King Christian IV&#x27;s stormy relationship to Kirsten Munk, and the crucial last hours on his journey from Frederiksborg Castle to Rosenborg Castle on his deathbed. The turning point is Christian IV&#x27;s and Kirsten Munk&#x27;s turbulent marriage with accusations of infidelity and attempted murder.

==Issue and private life==
His first queen was Anne Catherine. They were married from 1597 to 1612. She died after bearing Christian seven children. In 1615, three years after her death, the king privately married Kirsten Munk, by whom he had twelve children.

In 1632, an English envoy to king Christian IV, then aged 55, primly remarked &quot;Such is the life of that king: to drink all day and to lie with a whore every night&quot;.

In the course of 1628, he discovered that his wife, Kirsten Munk, was having a relationship with one of his German officers. Christian had Munk placed under house arrest. She endeavoured to cover up her own disgrace by conniving at an intrigue between Vibeke Kruse, one of her discharged maids, and the king. In January 1630, the rupture became final and Kirsten retired to her estates in Jutland. Meanwhile, Christian openly acknowledged Vibeke as his mistress, and they had several children.

With his first wife, Anne Catherine of Brandenburg he fathered the following children:
*Stillborn son (1598).
*Frederik (15 August 1599 – 9 September 1599) died in infancy.
*Christian (10 April 1603 – 2 June 1647).
*Sophie (4 January 1605 – 7 September 1605) died in infancy.
*Elisabeth (16 March 1606 – 24 October 1608) died in early childhood.
*Frederick III (18 March 1609 – 9 February 1670).
*Ulrik (2 February 1611 – 12 August 1633); murdered, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Schwerin as Ulrich III (1624–1633).

With his second wife, Kirsten Munk, he had 12 children, though the youngest, Dorothea Elisabeth, was rumoured to be the daughter of Kirsten&#x27;s lover, Otto Ludwig:
*Stillborn child (b. &amp; d. 1615).
*Unnamed infant (b. &amp; d. 1617).
*Countess Anna Cathrine of Schleswig-Holstein (10 August 1618 – 20 August 1633); married Frands Rantzau.

<text>Loveland is a city in Hamilton, Clermont, and Warren counties in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 13,307 at the 2020 census. Considered part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area, Loveland is located near exit 52 off Interstate 275, about northeast of the Cincinnati city limits. It borders Symmes, Miami and Hamilton townships and straddles the Little Miami River. Once a busy railroad town, Loveland is now a major stop along the Little Miami Scenic Trail.

==History==
The city is named after James Loveland, who operated a general store and post office near the railroad tracks downtown. It was incorporated as a village on May 12 or 16, 1876, and incorporated as a chartered city in 1961.

===Settlement===
Present-day Loveland originally lay at the edges of the Symmes Purchase and Virginia Military District, in what was then the Northwest Territory. The area was first settled in 1795 by Col. Thomas Paxton:

Paxton named the settlement after himself; it was renamed Loveland in 1850.

===Village getaway===
In its early days, Loveland was known as a resort town, with its summer homes for the wealthy, earning it the nickname &quot;Little Switzerland of the Miami Valley.&quot; Future Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase maintained a country home near Loveland, while the Cincinnati YWCA maintained a summer cottage there. The area was also home to Ohio&#x27;s first paper mill, built in 1810 by John Smith. A local road retains the mill&#x27;s eventual name, Kugler Mill. The area surrounding Loveland in Clermont County was well known for its peaches and strawberries. The Obionsville Post Office began operations on October 24, 1831, then changed its name to the Loveland Post Office on January 14, 1848.

The Hillsboro and Cincinnati Railroad was chartered in 1846 to run a line between Hillsboro and O&#x27;Bannon Creek in Loveland on the Little Miami Railroad&#x27;s route. By 1850, the H&amp;C had completed the to Hillsboro, Ohio. The H&amp;C would lease its line in perpetuity to the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad and ultimately became the mainline of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Loveland&#x27;s location at the junction of the Little Miami Railroad (now converted into the Loveland Bike Trail) and the Marietta and Cincinnati Railroad fueled the city&#x27;s growth, bringing &quot;40 passenger trains per day, and 12 scheduled freight trains between Loveland and Cincinnati.&quot;

Another railroad ran through antebellum Loveland: the Underground Railroad&#x27;s Eastern Route from Cincinnati included a stop at the village and continued northward to Waynesville and Lebanon. During the Civil War, Confederate Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan and his troops passed through Loveland, seizing possessions of northern and southern sympathizers alike (see Morgan&#x27;s Raid).

Until wagon bridges were built across the Little Miami River, settlement of Loveland was mostly confined to the Clermont County side, which had access to a railroad station. A wooden bridge spanned the river at Symmestown and Branch Hill from 1850 until it washed out six years later. For years, residents on both sides pushed for a bridge at Loveland, to avoid the long trip to Foster&#x27;s Crossing or Miamiville, and by 1868 threatened to have Miami Township annexed to Hamilton County if Clermont County officials continued to obstruct the project. A $75,000 suspension bridge was finally built at Symmestown and Branch Hill and dedicated on July 4, 1871. It was anchored by four wrought iron columns, at that time the heaviest ever made in the United States. A second bridge, connecting East and West Loveland, was completed between 1872 and 1876.

Loveland incorporated as a village on May 16, 1876. John H. Law was elected the village&#x27;s first mayor. That year, the Cincinnati Campground at Loveland was the site of the holiness movement&#x27;s tenth annual National Camp Meeting.

In 1886, the skeleton of a mastodon and prehistoric stone tools were found in a Loveland gravel pit.

In 1903, Loveland voted to become a dry village, prohibiting the sale of alcohol within the village limits 17 years before a national ban. Loveland was a center of the Temperance movement in Ohio.

Downtown Loveland&#x27;s proximity to the Little Miami River has made it vulnerable to flooding. The worst such event, the Ohio Flood of March 1913, destroyed a corn mill and washed out the Loveland Bridge, which was replaced with an iron bridge the next year.

In the 1920s, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; ran a promotion that offered a free plot of land in Loveland, along the Little Miami River, after paying for a one-year subscription to the daily. The Loveland Castle was built on multiple plots obtained through this promotion.

===Growing city===

After a population spike during the 1950s, Loveland reincorporated as a chartered city – the first of only two in Clermont County – on July 25, 1961, with George Anderson as its first mayor. The city absorbed smaller settlements, such as Paxton, Obanionsville, and Symmestown. German architect Rudolf Fränkel developed a master plan for Loveland.

Another major flood in 1959 led to the construction of a dike along the Little Miami River in 1962–1963.

In 1969, Loveland elected Viola Phillips as mayor; she was the first woman to serve as a city official.

In 1972 and 1973, Loveland was the site of multiple Ku Klux Klan rallies that drew members from multiple states.

The long-abandoned Little Miami Railroad corridor was converted into a bike trail in the 1980s and became part of the Little Miami Scenic Trail in 1984.

Loveland has periodically sought to expand its borders by annexing surrounding areas, primarily to the more commercially active west. In 1993, the city attempted to annex parts of Deerfield Township, prompting petitions to instead merge the township with the City of Mason. Moves to merge Symmes Township with Loveland began the next year but ultimately failed. In 1996, Loveland moved its eastern border by purchasing Col. Paxton&#x27;s original White Pillars homestead, which had remained unincorporated, despite being the first settlement in the Loveland area.

In the late 1990s, Loveland was designated a Tree City by the National Arbor Day Foundation, as it began a number of efforts to promote its Historic Downtown neighborhood, in part to celebrate the city&#x27;s bicentennial. The programs included a renovation of Historic Downtown itself to sport a more &quot;gentrified&quot; look, for example replacing concrete sidewalks with brick ones, installing park benches throughout, and providing incentives to businesses willing to improve their façades. Major roads such as South Lebanon Road (County Road 298) were expanded and given landscaped medians.

The front lawn of Loveland City Hall was decorated with a nativity scene annually from 1973 until 1993, when a representative of the Ku Klux Klan asked the city for permission to erect a cross beside the display. Since then, the nativity scene has been placed on privately owned property.

The Loveland Beautification Committee was established to sponsor various programs and events that aim to improve landscapes and other buildings around town. Under the mayorship of Lee Skierkiewicz, Loveland heavily promoted itself as a cycling destination. The Tour de Loveland, an annual cycling race, was started in order to promote the Loveland Bike Trail as the centerpiece of Historic Downtown Loveland. The city&#x27;s efforts culminated with USA Cycling Elite National Championship criteriums in June 1998. On January 24, 2005, Loveland City Council voted to cancel the Tour, due to declining attendance and a lack of sponsors.

On April 9, 1999, Loveland found itself in the path of an F4 tornado (see Fujita scale). The tornado claimed four fatalities, including a Loveland resident, before reaching the city.

With &quot;four blooms&quot;, Loveland won the 2005 America in Bloom competition for cities with 10,001 to 15,000 residents. Loveland lost to St. Ives/Carbis Bay in the 2006 Communities in Bloom International Challenge, medium category, but won the &quot;Communities in Bloom Youth Involvement Project Award.&quot;

In 2004, CSX Transportation leased the former Baltimore and Ohio railroad to RailAmerica&#x27;s Indiana and Ohio Railway system. On May 4, 2007, Ohio&#x27;s first four-quadrant gate was installed at the Second Street railroad crossing in Loveland, as part of a coordinated three-crossing system.

In 2013, Loveland was named a &quot;Best Hometown&quot; by &quot;Ohio Magazine&quot;.

Loveland went without a mayor from August to December 2017, after Mayor Mark Fitzgerald resigned under pressure from a recall effort and a move to replace him was declared invalid.

===Zoning controversies===
Loveland has seen several controversies over zoning regulation. After the city acquired the White Pillars property in 1996, it began plans to develop the land, which is situated on State Route 48. Prior to being elected councilman, Paul Elliot participated in a lawsuit against the city over attempting to rezone the property for commercial use without voter approval. In 2003, Mike Showler led a successful referendum to block the rezoning. An earlier attempt to develop a YMCA location on a section of Phillips Park also failed, when a group of residents protested the city&#x27;s development plans, prompting the YMCA to abandon the location. In December 2006, Loveland announced a plan to build a Loveland Recreation Center on land adjacent to Phillips Park. The city planned to enter into an operating agreement with the YMCA once the center was built; however, the Recreation Center tax referendum was defeated in May 2007. The Recreation Center plan was later revised, but Loveland residents again rejected an income tax levy to fund the center on November 6, 2007.

Shooter&#x27;s Supply, a local gun store, proposed building an indoor shooting range at the former location of the Matthew 25: Ministries humanitarian aid agency. Nearby residents attempted to block the shooting range, which would be built near several apartment complexes and residential neighborhoods, as well as a church. In May 2007, the building was instead converted into a luxury boarding facility for dogs.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is situated at an elevation of above sea level.

Loveland can be reached by car most easily via Interstate 275, but State Route 48 also serves the city. State Route 3 / U.S. Route 22 touches the northwestern corner of Loveland, and State Route 126 passes through Remington and Miamiville to the south.

Loveland is located within three counties: Hamilton, Clermont and Warren. At least 61 Ohio cities cross county lines. Loveland has withdrawn from Symmes, Miami, and Hamilton Townships to form a coextensive set of paper townships each named Loveland Township. Historic Downtown Loveland and the central business district lie in a small valley on opposite sides of the Little Miami Scenic River, the boundary between Hamilton and Clermont counties, whereas most of Loveland&#x27;s residential areas are located on the hills surrounding the valley on either side. Loveland City Hall is located in Clermont County, whereas most of the population resides in Hamilton County.

These areas include some neighborhoods from the 1950s and earlier, as well as a number of newer subdivisions built as part of the urban sprawl that saw nearby Mason grow tremendously. Unlike Mason and other suburbs closer to Interstate 71 and Interstate 75, Loveland is considered somewhat of a &quot;bedroom community&quot;, where residential neighborhoods (and churches) seemingly outnumber businesses, and many residents make the half-hour commute to Downtown Cincinnati for work each day.

The 513 area code includes the entirety of Loveland. The 45140 ZIP code also includes the entire city, with the exception of a few recently annexed businesses that belong to the 45249 ZIP code (Symmes). The United States Postal Service lists a number of place names as unacceptable for this ZIP code, including &quot;Murdock&quot; and &quot;Twenty Mile Stand&quot;; however, &quot;Loveland, Ohio&quot; is acceptable for Camp Dennison&#x27;s 45111 ZIP code. The 45108 FIPS55 code and codice_1 LOCODE both correspond to the city proper.

==Demographics==
In 1880, when the first census was taken of Loveland in Clermont County, the village had 595 residents, while the unincorporated Hamilton County community of West Loveland had 197. In 1890, Loveland grew to 761 residents in Clermont and Warren counties, while West Loveland&#x27;s population increased to 392.

From 1986 to 1998, the Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Company was headquartered in Loveland. Martinizing Dry Cleaning, Totes Isotoner, Pro Mach, and Blue Chip Cookies were also formerly headquartered in Loveland.

==Arts and culture==

Although the city&#x27;s unusual name came from the last name of the village storeowner and postmaster, rather than the concept, Loveland has incorporated a &quot;love&quot; theme throughout the city. Loveland water towers and park signs sport the city&#x27;s logo: a red heart inscribed with a sun, clouds, and the Little Miami River, and surrounded with the city&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Sweetheart of Ohio.&quot; The Loveland Post Office was the site of the United States Postal Service&#x27;s issuance of a 29¢ commemorative &quot;Love Sunrise&quot; stamp on January 27, 1994, the first self-adhesive Love stamp. Each year since 1972, the Loveland Area Chamber of Commerce has run a special Valentine&#x27;s Day program, which includes a poetry contest and the selection of a volunteer &quot;Valentine Lady&quot;. The Valentine Lady helps stamp up to 20,000 envelopes by hand with a Valentine-themed cachet and cancellation that reads &quot;There is nothing in this world so sweet as Love.&quot; The first Valentine Lady was Doris Pfiester. Loveland has held a greeting card design contest annually since 1989. , Valentine&#x27;s Day is the only day of the year when non-residents may reserve Loveland City Hall for marriage ceremonies, other than for senior citizens.

The city&#x27;s mascot is the Loveland frog, a legendary humanoid frog from the area.

The Grail&#x27;s national headquarters and retreat center, known as Grailville, has been located just outside Loveland since 1944.

The soul, funk, and retro-soul record label Colemine Records is based in Loveland and shares a building with its associated record store, Plaid Room Records. Colemine was founded in 2007 and has released records by artists such as Durand Jones &amp; The Indications, Black Pumas, Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio, and Ikebe Shakedown.

==Parks and recreation==
Biking along the Loveland Bike Trail and canoeing along the Little Miami River are popular activities during the summer. Loveland has a series of 16 city parks, including neighborhood &quot;tot lots&quot;, Nisbet Park, a Veteran&#x27;s Memorial, and Fireman&#x27;s Memorial. The parks are maintained by the City of Loveland Recreation Commission. The Loveland Bike Trail is a popular segment of the Little Miami Scenic Trail, a state park that runs through the city. From spring to fall, people canoe down the Little Miami River, departing from the livery at Loveland Canoe &amp; Kayak.

Shield&#x27;s Crossing is located in Loveland. The Gothic-style building, also known as the William Johnston House, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Chateau Laroche, a historical museum and folly also known as the Loveland Castle, is located just outside of the city in Loveland Park.

Loveland&#x27;s indoor attractions include Castle Skateland, a roller skating rink not to be confused with the museum; and the Loveland Stage Company, a theatre group that started in 1979 and has performed at least two major productions each year since 1980. In October 2002, after several years of fundraising and renovations, the group moved into Crist Theater, an old movie theater donated by the Loveland–Symmes Fire Department, which is stationed next door. The building had to be rebuilt after a fire gutted it on October 20, 2008.

==Government==
Loveland uses a council–manager form of government. The Loveland City Council has seven at-large seats, elected to four-year terms in non-partisan elections held every two years. , they are held by Mayor Kathy Bailey, Vice-Mayor Rob Weisgerber, and councilmembers Neal Oury, Kent Blair, Ted Phelps, Angie Settell and Tim Butler. Dave Kennedy is City Manager. Traffic cases and other misdemeanors are heard in Loveland Mayor&#x27;s Court, which is presided over by a magistrate.

At the federal level, Loveland is located within Ohio&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. At the state level, it is also served by the 27th, 62nd, and 65th House districts; the 7th and 14th Senate districts; and the 1st and 12th appellate court districts. See Ohio House of Representatives and Ohio Senate for the current representatives of the respective state districts.

According to the Loveland Code of Ordinances, the city&#x27;s corporate seal consists of &quot;the coat of arms of the state engraved in the center and the words &#x27;City of Loveland&#x27; engraved around the edge&quot;.

The city flag was adopted on August 27, 1974. It was designed by Howard A. Miller, a retired Air Force captain and vexillologist who lived in Loveland. Its diagonally divided field represents the three counties in which Loveland is located. A red heart in the center is a pun on the name of founder James Loveland; the city&#x27;s year of settlement is inscribed on the heart. A buckeye leaf surmounts the heart, representing Ohio.

==Education==
The city&#x27;s public school district, Loveland City School District, operated as separate Loveland East and Loveland West districts until 1926. Until 2009, Loveland High School was located in Symmes Township, just outside the city limits. The northern- and southernmost parts of Loveland are served by Sycamore Community School District. Surrounding communities lie within the boundaries of Kings Local School District (see Kings High School), Milford Exempted Village School District (Milford High School), and Little Miami Local School District (Little Miami High School). The city is also served by the Great Oaks Institute of Technology and Career Development and a regional vocational school district. There are many private schools located near Loveland, including Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy, Archbishop Moeller High School, and Ursuline Academy at the secondary level, and St. Margaret of York School, St. Columban School, and Children&#x27;s Meeting House Montessori School at the elementary level. At the 2000 census, 24.6% of Loveland children attended private or parochial schools, the nineteenth-highest rate among Greater Cincinnati communities.

The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County maintains a branch library in downtown Loveland, as well as a larger regional branch library in Symmes Township. The nearest branch of the Clermont County Public Library is in Milford. Warren County has no county-wide public library system, but the Mason Public Library is the nearest public library in the county.

==Media==
Loveland lies within the Cincinnati media market. Some Dayton-area media is also available. Cable television is provided by Spectrum. Cincinnati Bell provides IPTV service under the FiOptics brand.

&quot;Loveland Local News&quot; covers Loveland business, political, sports, and education, foucing on Loveland and surrounding areas.

&quot;Loveland Magazine&quot; is an online newspaper.

&quot;Eye on Loveland&quot; produces and distributes a free podcast focused on the politics of the city.

&quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; once published &quot;The Loveland Herald&quot;, a weekly newspaper, but the newspaper ceased publication in early 2019. The &quot;Herald&quot; began as &quot;The Tri-County Press&quot; in 1901 and took its present name in 1917. The &quot;Herald&quot; editorial offices were located in Miami Township until 2015 and then located to the &quot;Enquirer&quot; headquarters in downtown Cincinnati.

Defunct newspapers include &quot;The Loveland Herald&quot; (1901–2019), &quot;The Loveland Weekly Herald&quot; (1877–?), &quot;The Loveland Enterprise&quot; (1884–?), &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1906–1911), &quot;The Loveland News World&quot; (1980s), and &quot;The Loveland Record&quot;.

==Infrastructure==
===Law enforcement===
Loveland is protected by the Loveland Police Division and the Loveland–Symmes Fire Department, a member of the Northeast Fire Collaborative. Dispatching for both is handled by Northeast Communications Center (NECC), which provides Wireless Enhanced 911 service and also activates the local network of tornado sirens.

===Services===
The city lies in the Little Miami telephone exchange, within Cincinnati Bell&#x27;s ILEC coverage area. Loveland receives electric and natural gas services from Duke Energy Ohio, formerly Cincinnati Gas &amp; Electric. Waste disposal and recycling services are provided by Rumpke through the Southwest Ohio Regional Refuse (SWORRE) consortium. Loveland has water interconnectivity agreements with the City of Cincinnati and Clermont County. Loveland&#x27;s Polk Run Wastewater Treatment Plant is part of Hamilton County&#x27;s Greater Cincinnati Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD) under a 1985 operating agreement. The city sought to end the agreement in 2008, due to district-wide rate increases, but was barred from leaving MSD by a court ruling affirmed by the U.S. 6th Circuit Appeals Court.

<text>Christian V (15 April 1646 – 25 August 1699) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1670 until his death in 1699.

Well-regarded by the common people, he was the first king anointed at Frederiksborg Castle chapel as absolute monarch since the decree that institutionalized the supremacy of the king in Denmark-Norway. Christian fortified the absolutist system against the aristocracy by accelerating his father&#x27;s practice of allowing both Holstein nobles and Danish and Norwegian commoners into state service.

As king, he wanted to show his power as absolute monarch through architecture, and dreamed of a Danish Versailles. He was the first to use the 1671 Throne Chair of Denmark, partly made for this purpose. His motto was: &quot;Pietate et Justitia&quot; (With piety and justice).

== Biography ==
===Early years===

Prince Christian was born on 15 April 1646 at Duborg Castle in the city of Flensburg, then located in the Duchy of Schleswig. He was the first legitimate child born to the then Prince Frederick of Denmark by his consort, Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Calenberg. Prince Frederick was a younger son of King Christian IV, but the death of his elder brother Christian, Prince-Elect of Denmark in June 1647 opened the possibility for Frederick to be elected heir apparent to the Danish throne.

After the death of King Christian IV in 1648, Frederick thus became King of Denmark and Norway as Frederick III. Prince Christian was elected successor to his father in June 1650. This was not a free choice, but &quot;de facto&quot; automatic hereditary succession. Escorted by his chamberlain Christoffer Parsberg, Christian went on a long trip abroad, to Holland, England, France, and home through Germany. On this trip, he saw absolutism in its most splendid achievement at the young Louis XIV&#x27;s court, and heard about the theory of the divine right of kings. He returned to Denmark in August 1663. From 1664 he was allowed to attend proceedings of the State College. Hereditary succession was made official by Royal Law in 1665. Christian was hailed as heir in Copenhagen in August 1665, in Odense and Viborg in September, and in Christiania, Norway in July 1666. Only a short time before he became king, he was taken into the Council of the Realm and the Supreme Court.

===Accession===

On 9 February 1670, King Frederick III died at the age of 60 at the Copenhagen Castle after a reign of 22 years. At the death of his father, Frederick immediately ascended the thrones of Denmark and Norway as the second absolute monarch at the age of just 24. He was formally crowned on 7 June the following year in the chapel of Frederiksborg Palace, which thereafter became the traditional place of coronation of Denmark&#x27;s monarchs during the days of the absolute monarchy. He was the first hereditary king of Denmark-Norway, and in honor of this, Denmark-Norway acquired costly new crown jewels and a magnificent new ceremonial sword.

===Reign===

It is generally argued that Christian V&#x27;s personal courage and affability made him popular among the common people, but his image was marred by his unsuccessful attempt to regain Scania for Denmark in the Scanian War. The war exhausted Denmark&#x27;s economic resources without securing any gains. Part of Christian&#x27;s appeal to the common people may be explained by the fact that he allowed Danish and Norwegian commoners into state service, but his attempts to curtail the influence of the nobility also meant continuing his father&#x27;s drive toward absolutism. To accommodate non-aristocrats into state service, he created the new noble ranks of count and baron. One of the commoners elevated in this way by the king was Peder Schumacher, named Count of Griffenfeld by Christian V in 1670 and high councillor of Denmark in 1674.
Griffenfeld, a skilled statesman, better understood the precarious situation Denmark-Norway placed itself by attacking Sweden at a time when the country was allied with France, the major European power of the era. After some hesitation, Christian V initiated the Scanian War (1675–1679) against Sweden in an attempt to reconquer Scania which Denmark had lost under the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. As Griffenfeld predicted, Sweden&#x27;s stronger ally France was the party that dictated the peace with Denmark&#x27;s ally the Netherlands, and in spite of Danish victory at sea in the battles against Sweden in 1675–1679 during the Scanian War, Danish hopes for border changes on the Scandinavian Peninsula between the two countries were dashed. The results of the war efforts proved politically and financially unremunerative for Denmark-Norway. The damage to the Danish-Norwegian economy was extensive. At this point, Christian V no longer had his most experienced foreign relations counsel around to repair the political damage — in 1676 he had been persuaded to sacrifice Griffenfeld as a traitor, and to the clamour of his adversaries, Griffenfeld was imprisoned for the remainder of his life.

After the Scanian War, his sister, Princess Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark, married Swedish king Charles XI, whose mother was a stout supporter of the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. In spite of the family ties, war between the brothers-in-law was close again in 1689, when Charles XI nearly provoked confrontation with Denmark-Norway by his support of the exiled Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp in his claims to Holstein-Gottorp in Schleswig-Holstein.

Like Charles XI of Sweden, who had never been outside Sweden, Christian V spoke only German and Danish and was therefore often considered poorly educated due to his inability to communicate with visiting foreign diplomats. Christian V was also often considered dependent on his councillors by contemporary sources. The Danish monarch did nothing to dispel this notion. In his memoirs, he listed &quot;hunting, love-making, war and maritime affairs&quot; as his main interests in life.

Christian V introduced the Danish Code (&quot;Danske Lov&quot;) in 1683, the first law code for all of Denmark. He also introduced the similar &quot;Norske Lov&quot; (Norwegian Code) of 1687 to replace Christian IVs Norwegian Code from 1604 in Norway. He also introduced the land register of 1688, which attempted to work out the land value of the united monarchy in order to create a more just taxation.

During the reign of Christian V, Denmark&#x27;s trade in cattle that had declined due to catastrophic fires and wars had been restored, and livestock and crop exports had also surpassed Frederick III, with thousands of cattle entering and leaving Jutland through the Oxen Way. After entering and fattening in the Danish King&#x27;s German enclave County of Oldenburg, the cattle reached the big market in Wedel. From there, cattle are resold to all parts of North Germany via Stade, Hamburg and Lübeck. As the population continues to soar at the end of the seventeenth century, demand for beef, grains and fish is increasing, both throughout North Germany and on the Baltic coast alone. In terms of the number of livestock shipped to the South, in 1680 each market had reached 40,000 cattle. Traditional export commodities, including fish and grains, have increased their exports since the beginning of the seventeenth century.
The agricultural products exported by Denmark, especially cattle, have made a lot of money from Germany and the Netherlands for the Danish royal family, the aristocrats and the town residents. During his reign, science witnessed a golden age due to the work of the astronomer Ole Rømer in spite of the king&#x27;s personal lack of scientific knowledge and interest. He died from the after-effects of a hunting accident and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral.

===Family===
Christian V had eight children by his wife and six by his Maîtresse-en-titre, Sophie Amalie Moth (1654–1719), whom he took up with when she was sixteen. Sophie was the daughter of his former tutor Poul Moth. Christian publicly introduced Sophie into court in 1672, a move which insulted his wife, and made her countess of Samsø on 31 December 1677.

<doc id="150884" wikidata="Q2233852" url="?curid=150884" title="Milford, Ohio">
<text>Milford is a city in Clermont and Hamilton counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. Milford is the westernmost city in Appalachian Ohio, and located along the Little Miami River and its East Fork in the southwestern part of the state, it is a part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area. The population was 6,582 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The area covering the City of Milford, O&#x27;Bannon (Miami) Township, and part of the City of Loveland is from a single 1788 survey by John Nancarrow, a Revolutionary War veteran from Virginia. As one of Clermont County&#x27;s major historians noted, &quot;No wonder, then, that it struck with rapture the quaint and eccentric John Nancarrow, who had it surveyed for him on May 28, 1788 as Dutch burgomaster intended to found a city that should become the future metropolis of the West.&quot; O&#x27;Bannon Township was named after O&#x27;Bannon Creek, which itself was named for Clermont&#x27;s first surveyor who was not connected to, responsible for, or interested at all in Nancarrow&#x27;s survey area.

The settlement of Milford, which was the first settlement within the 1788 Nancarrow survey&#x27;s area, commenced in 1796 near where two riverways—the Little Miami River and its East Fork—come together; making Milford tied with Williamsburg as the oldest settlement in Clermont County. The first settler to arrive in the area was the Reverend Francis McCormick, a Revolutionary War soldier with a thousand-acre land grant, in 1796. McCormick built his log cabin on the hill at the present 1000 Forest Avenue and he founded the first Methodist Class in the Northwest Territory in 1797. Nancarrow, the first surveyor, sold his share of of land to Philip Gatch on December 20, 1802, for a total of $920.00. Four years later, Gatch decided to sell to Ambrose Ranson who, soon after, sold to John Hageman. Hageman became the first long-term settler (as Gatch relocated slightly outside town limits), naming the valley Hageman&#x27;s Mills. Hageman laid out a village of 46 lots; the choicest lot was #1 where the Millcroft Inn was located at Mill and Water Streets, with a price of $35.00 with most of the other lots selling for $25.00. 

By 1811, Hageman had departed for Indiana and the name Milford had come into prominent use, attributed to the newspaper changing it in February 1806 because it was the first safe ford north of the Ohio River to cross the Little Miami River. In 1806, Milford was only three blocks, including Main, Water, and High Streets. With the prominent river ford location to get to the site of its mill, references to the singular name Milford became more widespread to connote the still-unincorporated survey area; in 1814, a newspaper mentioned: &quot;The Ohio Militia paymaster will pay soldiers at Chenemiah Covett&#x27;s stone house below Milford.&quot; An extension of then-town-limits to the First Methodist church alley was made in 1817. People from the outer township travelled into Milford to sell crops, buy flour, visit shops and restaurants, and rest before making their way back up the hill. After the settlement had been platted for some time, the first part of the Town of Milford was formally incorporated January 23, 1836 (as a village municipality), followed by other phases; the corporate area would see enlargements in 1846, 1869, 1872, 1888 (Montauk and South Milford), 1925, 1939, 1950s, 1959 (part of Milford Hills), 1970s, 1981, 1983, 1985-6, and the early 2000s. Voters formally organized Milford Schools in 1867. After generations as a village, in 1982 with a census count of 5232, the village municipality was upgraded to city status, thus being styled forth the City of Milford. Due to the great Methodist influence, including the life of the Reverend McCormick, Milford is recognized as the root of Methodist religious heritage into the American West. Its namesake river ford is still a shallow place seen today as it was when one had to cross the river to get to the old mill.

A field along Gatch Avenue, on what was once the farm of John Gatch, has yielded large numbers of artifacts for several generations. It is believed to have once been the site of a Native American village during the Woodland period. Today, the field next to Gatch&#x27;s estate is managed by the Valley View conservancy, having been an archaeological site called the Gatch Site.

<doc id="150888" wikidata="Q156572" url="?curid=150888" title="Christian VII of Denmark">
<text>Christian VII (29 January 1749 – 13 March 1808) was King of Denmark and Norway and Duke of Schleswig and Holstein from 1766 until his death in 1808. He was affected by mental illness and was only nominally king for most of his reign. His royal advisers changed depending on the outcome of power struggles. From 1770 to 1772, his court physician Johann Friedrich Struensee was the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country and introduced progressive reforms signed into law by the king. Struensee was deposed by a coup in 1772, after which the country was ruled by Christian&#x27;s stepmother, Queen Dowager Juliane Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, his half-brother Hereditary Prince Frederick, and the Danish politician Ove Høegh-Guldberg. From 1784 until Christian VII&#x27;s death in 1808, Christian&#x27;s son, later Frederick VI, acted as unofficial prince regent.

==Early life ==
===Birth and family===
Christian was born in the early hours of the morning on 29 January 1749 at Christiansborg Palace, the royal residence in Copenhagen. He was the fourth child and second son of the reigning monarch of Denmark–Norway, King Frederick V, and his first wife Louise of Great Britain. The newborn prince was baptized later the same day in the afternoon by the royal confessor Johannes Bartholomæus Bluhme, and was named after his late grandfather, King Christian VI. His godparents were King Frederick V (his father), Queen Dowager Sophie Magdalene (his paternal grandmother), Princess Louise (his aunt) and Princess Charlotte Amalie (his grand-aunt).

A former heir to the throne, also named Christian, had died in infancy in 1747, and the newborn was thus crown prince from birth; therefore, hopes were high for the future of the new heir apparent. Christoph Willibald Gluck, then conductor of the royal opera troupe, composed the opera &quot;La Contesa dei Numi&quot; (The contention of the gods), in which the Olympian gods gather at the banks of the Great Belt and discuss who in particular should protect the new prince.

At birth, Christian had two elder sisters, Princess Sophia Magdalena and Princess Wilhelmina Caroline, and the family was joined by another daughter, Princess Louise in 1750. In 1751, almost three years after Christian&#x27;s birth, his mother Queen Louise died during her sixth pregnancy, aged just 27 years. The following year, his father married Duchess Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who gave birth to Christian&#x27;s half-brother, Prince Frederick in 1753.

===Childhood and education===

After the early death of his mother, the prince was largely denied parental affection. His stepmother Queen Juliane Marie showed no interest in him, preferring her biological son Hereditary Prince Frederick. Prone to debauchery and increasingly affected by alcoholism, Christian&#x27;s father became increasingly indifferent to the shy, sensitive child, who was also prone to epileptic seizures. Nonetheless, early historians state that Christian had a winning personality and considerable talent, but that he was poorly educated and systematically terrorized, and even flogged, by a brutal tutor, Count Christian Ditlev Frederik Reventlow. He seems to have been intelligent and had periods of clarity, but had severe emotional problems, possibly schizophrenia, as argued by Doctor Viggo Christiansen in &quot;Christian VII&#x27;s mental illness&quot; (1906). He masturbated frequently, which worried his court physicians and tutor, who thought the practice reduced the prince&#x27;s fertility and affected his capacity for learning.

== Early reign ==
===Accession===

After a long period of infirmity, Frederick V died on 14 January 1766, just 42 years old. At the death of his father, Christian immediately ascended the thrones of Denmark and Norway as their sixth absolute monarch, a few weeks before his 17th birthday. Later the same day, Christian was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace. Christian&#x27;s reign was marked by mental illness, which affected government decisions, and for most of his reign, Christian was only nominally king. His royal advisers changed depending on who won power struggles around the throne.

===Marriage===

Later the same year, the young king married his first cousin, the 15-year-old Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, in a dynastic marriage. They had been betrothed already in 1765. Her brother, King George III of Great Britain, was anxious about the marriage but not aware that the bridegroom was mentally ill. They were married in a proxy wedding ceremony on 1 October 1766 in the Chapel Royal of St James&#x27;s Palace in London, with the Princess&#x27;s brother, Prince Edward, Duke of York and Albany, acting as the representative of the groom. After her arrival in Copenhagen, another wedding ceremony took place on 8 November 1766 in the royal chapel at Christiansborg Palace. Marriage celebrations and balls lasted for another month. On 1 May 1767, Christian VII and Caroline Matilda were crowned King and Queen of Denmark and Norway in the royal chapel of Christiansborg Palace.
The marriage was unhappy, and after his marriage, the king abandoned himself to the worst excesses, especially sexual promiscuity. In 1767, he entered into a relationship with the courtesan Støvlet-Cathrine. He ultimately sank into a condition of mental stupor. Symptoms during this time included paranoia, self-mutilation, and hallucinations. The king showed little interest in the queen and only reluctantly visited her in her chambers. His trusted Swiss tutor, Élie Salomon François Reverdil had to step in, among other things with love letters written in the king&#x27;s name, in an attempt to make the marriage lead to a pregnancy and thus an heir to the throne. On 28 January 1768, Queen Caroline Mathilde gave birth at Christiansborg Palace to the royal couple&#x27;s son and heir to throne, the future King Frederick VI.

===Struensee===

The progressive and radical thinker Johann Friedrich Struensee, Christian&#x27;s personal physician, became his advisor and rose steadily in power in the late 1760s to &quot;de facto&quot; regent of the country, where he introduced widespread progressive reforms. Struensee was a protégé of an Enlightenment circle of aristocrats that had been rejected by the court in Copenhagen. He was a skilled doctor, and having somewhat restored the king&#x27;s health while visiting the Schleswig-Holstein area, he gained the king&#x27;s affection. He was retained as travelling physician (&quot;Livmedikus hos Kong Christian VII&quot;) on 5 April 1768, and accompanied the entourage on the king&#x27;s foreign tour to Paris and London via Hannover from 6 May 1768 to 12 January 1769. He was given the title of State Councilor (&quot;etatsråd&quot;) on 12 May 1768, barely a week after leaving Altona. The neglected and lonely Caroline Matilda entered into an affair with Struensee.

From 1770 to 1772, Struensee was &quot;de facto&quot; regent of the country, and introduced progressive reforms signed into law by Christian VII. Struensee was deposed by a coup in 1772 after which the country was ruled by Christian&#x27;s stepmother, Juliane Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, his half-brother Frederick, and the Danish politician Ove Høegh-Guldberg.

===Divorce===
The king divorced Caroline Matilda in 1772 after they had produced two children: the future King Frederick VI and Princess Louise Auguste. Struensee, who had enacted many modernising and emancipating reforms, was arrested and executed the same year. Christian signed Struensee&#x27;s arrest and execution warrant under pressure from his stepmother, Queen Juliana Maria, who had led the movement to have the marriage ended. Caroline Matilda retained her title but not her children. She eventually left Denmark and passed her remaining days in exile at Celle Castle in her brother&#x27;s German territory, the Electorate of Hanover. She died there of scarlet fever on 10 May 1775 at the age of 23.

==Later life==

Christian was only nominally king from 1772 onward. Between 1772 and 1784, Denmark-Norway was ruled by his stepmother, the Queen Dowager Juliane Marie, his half-brother Frederick, and the Danish politician Ove Høegh-Guldberg. From 1784, his son Frederick ruled permanently as prince regent. This regency was marked by liberal, judicial, and agricultural reforms, but also by disasters of the Theatre War, French Revolutionary Wars, the beginning of the Napoleonic Wars, and the rise of the Norwegian separatist movement.

===Death and succession===

Christian died at age 59 of a stroke on 13 March 1808 in Rendsburg, Schleswig. Although there were rumours that the stroke was caused by fright at the sight of Spanish auxiliary troops which he took to be hostile, Ulrik Langen, in his biography of the king, did not indicate that there was any external cause. He was buried in Roskilde Cathedral and was succeeded by his son Frederick VI.

==Legacy==

=== Contribution to science ===
In 1769, King Christian VII invited the Hungarian astronomer Miksa Hell (Maximilian Hell) to Vardø. Hell observed the transit of Venus, and his calculations gave the most precise calculation of the Earth–Sun distance to that date (approx. 151 million kilometres). Hell&#x27;s companion János Sajnovics explored the affinity among the languages of the Sami, Finnish, and Hungarian peoples (all members of the Finno-Ugric language family).

==Cultural depictions==

<doc id="150891" wikidata="Q157781" url="?curid=150891" title="Christian VIII of Denmark">
<text>Christian VIII (18 September 1786 – 20 January 1848) was King of Denmark from 1839 to 1848 and, as Christian Frederick, King of Norway in 1814.

Christian Frederick was the eldest son of Hereditary Prince Frederick, a younger son of King Frederick V of Denmark and Norway. As his cousin Frederick VI had no sons, Christian Frederick was heir presumptive to the throne from 1808.

==Early years==
===Birth and family===

Prince Christian Frederick of Denmark and Norway was born late in the morning on 18 September 1786 at Christiansborg Palace, the principal residence of the Danish Monarchy on the island of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen. He was officially the eldest son of Hereditary Prince Frederick of Denmark and Norway and Duchess Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. His father was a younger son of the deceased King Frederick V of Denmark-Norway and his second wife, Duchess Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, and his mother was a daughter of Duke Louis of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

On 28 September 1786, the young prince was baptized with the names &quot;Christian Frederick&quot; in his mother&#x27;s chamber at Christiansborg Palace by the royal confessor Christian Bastholm. His godparents were King Christian VII (his uncle), the dowager queen Juliana Maria (his grandmother), Crown Prince Frederick (his cousin), Princess Louise Augusta (his cousin), and Hereditary Prince Frederick Christian of Augustenburg.

In the family, however, it was widely acknowledged that the biological father most likely was the Hereditary Prince&#x27;s aide-de-camp and hofmarschall Frederick von Blücher, who probably also fathered Christian Frederick&#x27;s three younger siblings: Princess Juliane Sophie, Princess Louise Charlotte and Prince Frederick Ferdinand. In a letter written by Crown Prince Frederick to his brother-in-law Duke Frederick Christian II of Augustenburg in 1805, he thus mentions the Hereditary Prince&#x27;s goodwill towards his hofmarschall and continues: 

When Prince Christian Frederick was born, his father&#x27;s half-brother, Christian VII, was the King of Denmark-Norway, but due to the king&#x27;s mental illness, he was not able to rule himself. From 1772, Hereditary Prince Frederick had ruled together with his mother, the Dowager Queen Juliane Marie, and their adviser Ove Høegh-Guldberg. In 1784, however, the king&#x27;s only son, the young Crown Prince Frederick (later King Frederick VI), had seized power in a palace revolution and was now the real ruler. In Prince Christian Frederick&#x27;s childhood, his family had a strained relationship with the Crown Prince and his family as a result of these power struggles, but gradually the relationship between the two branches of the royal family was normalized.

===Childhood and education===

Prince Christian Frederick spent the first years of his life with his siblings in the vast and magnificent Baroque Christiansborg Palace. As the family&#x27;s summer residence, Hereditary Prince Friedrich in 1789 bought the smaller and elegant country house, Sorgenfri Palace, on the banks of the small river Mølleåen in Kongens Lyngby, north of Copenhagen. On 26 February 1794, the family lost their Copenhagen home, as Christiansborg Palace was devastated by a fire. Instead the Hereditary Prince bought the &quot;Levetzau&#x27;s Palace&quot;, an 18th-century town house which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in the district Frederiksstaden in central Copenhagen. In november of the same year, when he was eight years old, his mother, who had long suffered from a fragile health, died at Sorgenfri the age of just 36 years.

Christian Frederick was raised conservatively according to the guidelines of minister Ove Høegh-Guldberg, who had been ousted from government in 1784 along with the hereditary prince. His upbringing was marked by a thorough and broad-spectrum education with exposure to artists and scientists who were linked to his father&#x27;s court. He inherited the talents of his highly gifted mother, and his love of science and art was instilled at an early age and would follow him throughout his life. His amiability and handsome features are said to have made him very popular in Copenhagen.

He was confirmed on 22 May 1803 in the chapel of Frederiksberg Palace together with his sisters Princess Juliane Sophie and Princess Louise Charlotte. A year and a half later, on 7 December 1805, the children&#x27;s father, Hereditary Prince Frederick, died at the age of 52, and the nineteen-year-old Prince Christian Frederik inherited his place as second-in-line in the succession as well as the two residences, Levetzau&#x27;s Palace and Sorgenfri Palace. As King Christian VII died on 13 March 1808, Crown Prince Frederick became king of Denmark and Norway as Frederick VI. Since the new king still had no male descendants, Christian Frederick thus became heir presumptive to the throne.

===First marriage===

On a visit to his mother&#x27;s relatives in Mecklenburg, Prince Christian Frederick stayed at his uncle&#x27;s court in Schwerin, where he fell in love with his cousin, Duchess Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Charlotte Frederica was a daughter of the reigning Duke Friedrich Franz I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and Princess Louise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. They married two years later, on 21 June 1806, at Ludwigslust.

The young couple first settled at Plön Castle in the Duchy of Holstein. It was here, that Charlotte Frederica gave birth to their first-born son, Prince Christian Frederick, who was born and died on 8 April 1807. From 1808 the couple lived in Copenhagen, where they took residence partly at Levetzau&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg, and partly at Sorgenfri Palace. On 6 October 1808, their second son and only surviving child was born, Prince Frederick Carl Christian, the future King Frederick VII of Denmark.

Nonetheless, their married life was unhappy. Charlotte Frederica was described as very beautiful in her youth, but her character was thought to be moody, capricious, frivolous and mythomaniac, qualities that were later said to recur in her son, Frederick VII. Her alleged affair with her singing teacher, Swiss-born singer and composer Édouard Du Puy, led to her removal from the court. For this reason, her husband divorced her in 1810, sent her into internal exile in the town of Horsens, and prohibited her from ever seeing her son again.

==King of Norway==

In May 1813, as the heir presumptive of the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway, Christian was sent as &quot;stattholder&quot; (Governor-general of Norway) to Norway to promote the loyalty of the Norwegians to the House of Oldenburg, which had been very badly shaken by the disastrous results of Frederick VI&#x27;s adhesion to the falling fortunes of Napoleon I of France. Christian did all he could personally to strengthen the bonds between the Norwegians and the royal house. Though his endeavours were opposed by the so-called Swedish party, which desired a dynastic union with Sweden, he placed himself at the head of the Norwegian party of independence after the Treaty of Kiel had forced the king to cede Norway to the king of Sweden. He was elected Regent of Norway by an assembly of notables on 16 February 1814.

This election was confirmed by the Norwegian Constituent Assembly convoked at Eidsvoll on 10 April, and on 17 May the constitution was signed and Christian was unanimously elected king of Norway under the name Christian Frederick (Kristian Frederik in Norwegian).
Christian next attempted to interest the great powers in Norway&#x27;s cause, but without success. On being pressed by the commissioners of the allied powers to bring about a union between Norway and Sweden in accordance with the terms of the treaty of Kiel, and then return to Denmark, he replied that, as a constitutional king, he could do nothing without the consent of the parliament (Storting), which would not be convoked until there was a suspension of hostilities on the part of Sweden.

Sweden refused Christian&#x27;s conditions and a short military campaign ensued in which the Norwegian army was defeated by the forces of the Swedish crown prince Charles John. The brief war concluded with the Convention of Moss on 14 August 1814. By the terms of this treaty, King Christian Frederick transferred executive power to the Storting, then abdicated the throne and returned to Denmark. The Storting in its turn adopted the constitutional amendments necessary to allow for a personal union with Sweden and on 4 November elected Charles XIII of Sweden as the new king of Norway, Charles II.

== Danish heir presumptive ==
=== Second marriage ===

Upon his return to Denmark, Christian married his second wife, Princess Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (daughter of Louise Augusta of Denmark, the only sister of Frederick VI) at Augustenborg Palace on 22 May 1815. The couple was childless and lived in comparative retirement as leaders of the literary and scientific society of Copenhagen until Christian ascended the throne of Denmark.

Christian had ten extramarital children, for whom he carefully provided. It has been suggested that these extramarital children included the fairy tale author Hans Christian Andersen, though there is little evidence to support this.

== King of Denmark ==
On 3 December 1839 he ascended the Danish throne as Christian VIII. The Liberal party had high hopes of &quot;the giver of constitutions.&quot; However, by this time, Christian had become more conservative, and disappointed his admirers by steadily rejecting every Liberal project. Administrative reform was the only reform he would promise. In his attitude to the growing national unrest in the twin duchies of Schleswig and Holstein he often seemed hesitant and half-hearted, which damaged his position there. It was not until 1846 that he clearly supported the idea of Schleswig being a Danish area.

King Christian VIII continued his predecessor&#x27;s patronage of astronomy, awarding gold medals for the discovery of comets by telescope and financially supporting Heinrich Christian Schumacher with his publication of the scientific journal &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;. It was during his reign that the last remnants of Danish India, namely Tranquebar in the south and Serampore in Bengal, were sold to the British in 1845.

His only legitimate son, the future Frederick VII (1808–1863) was married three times, but produced no legitimate issue. Since he was apparently unlikely to beget heirs, Christian wished to avert a succession crisis. Christian commenced arrangements to secure the succession in Denmark. The result was the selection of the future Christian IX as hereditary prince, the choice made official by a new law enacted on 31 July 1853 after an international treaty made in London.

King Christian died of sepsis in Amalienborg Palace in 1848 and was interred in Roskilde Cathedral on the island of Zealand, the traditional burial site for Danish monarchs since the 15th century.

Some historians and biographers believe that King Christian would have given Denmark a free constitution had he lived long enough; his last words are sometimes recorded as &quot;I didn&#x27;t make it&quot; (&quot;Jeg nåede det ikke&quot;).

<text>Crestline is a village in Crawford and Richland Counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. Crestline&#x27;s population was 4,525 at the 2020 census. It is the third largest municipality in Crawford County. The Crawford County portion of Crestline is part of the Bucyrus Micropolitan Statistical Area, while the small portion of the village that extends into Richland County is considered part of the Mansfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. Both sections form the Mansfield–Bucyrus, OH Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

===Early history===
The Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, or the &quot;Bee Line&quot; as it was known then, predated Crestline. Since there was no town between Shelby and Galion, it was decided that a station should be placed halfway for passenger convenience. The station was constructed where the line crossed the Leesville road.

Crestline was platted in 1852. It was once thought to be the highest point in Ohio and was named from its high elevation.

This station soon developed into a town, with a general store, post office, and a few homes. Early settlers in the village believed that the town was the watershed of the state, where streams to the north emptied into Lake Erie and those to the south emptied into the Ohio River, thus the name Crest Line. The town was not directly on the watershed line (but rather just north of the divide), but the name stuck and eventually became one word.

===Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Funeral Train===
Following his death by assassination, the body of Abraham Lincoln was brought from Washington, D.C. to its final resting place in Lincoln&#x27;s hometown of Springfield, Illinois, by funeral train. The train left Washington, D.C., on April 21, 1865, at 12:30 pm and traveled to Springfield, arriving on May 3, 1865. Several stops were made along the way, including Crestline on April 29, 1865, at 4:07 am.

===20th century===

During its heyday, Crestline was a division point for the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railway. The city housed major engine facilities and would often be the point where motive power was changed for the relatively flat runs to and from Chicago, Illinois. In addition to the town&#x27;s station being a stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s east–west trains, the station served as a transfer point to the New York Central Railroad&#x27;s northeast–southwest trains.

On November 1, 1903, two Pennsylvania line train cars carrying dynamite exploded, causing damage to the rail lines and several train cars. This disaster is noted as one of the catalysts which began the regulation of the shipping of hazardous substances.  

The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s engine facilities included a roundhouse on Crestline Road, decommissioned in 1968 in the aftermath of the merger between the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central. Demolition of the historic roundhouse commenced in 2007 after years of neglect. But, some buildings still stand. Today, Chicago, Fort Wayne and Eastern Railroad, CSX and Norfolk Southern trains operate in and around Crestline.

===21st century===
On September 4, 2017, at approximately 10:45 p.m. a tornado passed from the west to just north of the village causing extensive damage to rural properties near the village. The National Weather Service classified the twister as an EF-2 with winds above 115 miles per hour. This incident was a rare event.

<text>Dublin is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio. A suburb of Columbus, it falls within the jurisdictions of Franklin, Delaware, and Union counties. The population was 49,328 at the 2020 census. Dublin has the highest concentration of Asians of any Ohio city. The Dublin Irish Festival advertises itself as the largest three-day Irish festival in the world.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Native Americans from the Hopewell, Adena, Delaware, Shawnee, and Wyandot were among the first known inhabitants of the countryside that was to become Dublin, Ohio.

The Wyandot had moved to the Ohio countryside after being decimated by disease and a disastrous war with the Five Nations of the Iroquois in their homeland near Georgian Bay. In 1794, General Anthony Wayne defeated the Wyandot and other Ohio American Indian peoples at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, leading to the Wyandot surrendering most of their land in Ohio with the signing of the Treaty of Greenville.

Chief Shateyaronyah, an important leader known to locals as &quot;Leatherlips&quot;, had signed the Treaty of Greenville on August 3, 1795, and encouraged cooperation with white settlers near the end of his life. That policy of accommodating Europeans led to conflict with a movement led by two Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). Tenskwatawa reacted strongly against Leatherlips and condemned him to death for signing away native lands, and for &quot;witchcraft&quot;. More likely was that this was for his refusal to join the Shawnee. Rather than break the pledge that he signed in 1795, Leatherlips was killed in 1810. The Leatherlips sculpture in Scioto Park was created to honor Chief Shateyaronyah in 1990.

After the Revolutionary War, the United States Government gave of land along the Scioto River to Lieutenant James Holt as payment for his service. In 1802, Peter and Benjamin Sells from Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, purchased of this land for their brother, John. The site of the John Sells&#x27; original purchase is known as Historic Dublin.

===Post-Ohio statehood===
In 1808, John Sells brought his family to the region, and by 1810, he had begun to survey lots for the new village with his business partner, an Irish gentleman named John Shields. According to historians, Shields is responsible for naming the town after his birthplace:
In 1833, Dublin contained several mills and one store, and was incorporated in 1881.

In 1970, Dublin was still a small town with only 681 residents. However, the construction of Interstate 270 facilitated a population boom, spearheaded by the acquisition of major corporate headquarters such as Ashland Inc and Wendy&#x27;s International. In addition, the growth of the Muirfield Village Golf Club and its residential subdivision attracted people to the rapidly growing suburb. It was then officially declared a city in August 1987, after reaching a population of 5,000 residents. As part of this boom Dublin significantly expanded its area, annexing parts of Washington, Perry, Concord, and Jerome townships.

In 2020, the city began redeveloping the Bridge Street District. The project includes 400 apartments and condominiums, retail, offices, and other space along the Scioto River. During a survey for the new Wexner Medical Center, an African-American cemetery was discovered. In 2024, the city held a dedication ceremony which included local resident ancestors of some of the more than 20 people who are buried there.

==Geography==

Honda first established operations in Marysville in 1979.

As of that year, in some subdivisions in Dublin, Japanese make up 20–30% of the residents. The community includes Japanese restaurants. A Coldwell Banker real estate agent named Akiko Miyamoto stated in &quot;Car Talk&quot; that the services provided for Japanese speakers by the Dublin City School District attract Japanese expatriates to Dublin. Holly Zachariah of &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot; stated that &quot;It has been that way historically.&quot; According to the &quot;2013 Japanese Direct Investment Survey&quot; by the Consulate-General of Japan in Detroit, Dublin had 2,002 Japanese nationals, giving it the highest such population in the state.

<text>Westerville is a city in Franklin and Delaware counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. A northeastern suburb of Columbus as well as the home of Otterbein University, the population was 39,190 at the 2020 census.

Westerville was once known as &quot;The Dry Capital of the World&quot; for its strict laws prohibiting sales of alcohol and for being the home of the Anti-Saloon League, one of the driving forces behind Prohibition at the beginning of the 20th century.

==History==
===Native Americans===
Cultures have inhabited the Westerville area for several millennia. Paleo-Indians and their successor cultures inhabited the area between Big Walnut Creek and Alum Creek. The Wyandot were the primary inhabitants by the time Europeans arrived, living along Alum Creek. They were forced out of Ohio in 1843.

===Post-Ohio statehood===
The land that is today Westerville was settled by those of European ancestry around 1810. In 1818, Matthew, Peter, and William Westervelt, settlers of Dutch extraction, migrated to the area from New York. Matthew Westervelt donated land for the construction of a Methodist church in 1836, and the settlement was subsequently named in the family&#x27;s honor. In 1839, the Blendon Young Men&#x27;s Seminary was chartered in Westerville; Matthew Westervelt was one of its first trustees. The Church of the United Brethren in Christ bought the seminary in 1846, and the next year the seminary was reformed, and renamed Otterbein College after the church&#x27;s founder Philip William Otterbein. It continues today in Westerville as the private Otterbein University.

Westerville was platted by 1856, and officially incorporated in August 1858. The town&#x27;s population in that year was 275.

Throughout the Antebellum era, several homes in Westerville were stations on the Underground Railroad. Among these is the Hanby House, located one block from the college. Benjamin Russell Hanby had moved to Westerville in 1849, at the age of sixteen, to enroll at Otterbein University. Hanby went on to write many familiar hymns and songs, among them &quot;Darling Nelly Gray&quot; (inspired by his sympathy for Southern slaves), &quot;Who is He in Yonder Stall?&quot;, and the Christmas favorite &quot;Up On The Housetop&quot;. His home in Westerville, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was dedicated as a museum in 1937 and is now owned by the Ohio Historical Society and managed locally by the Westerville Historical Society. It is the only state memorial to a composer in the state of Ohio.

===&quot;Dry Capital of the World&quot;===
An 1859 town ordinance prohibited sales of alcohol in Westerville. By the 1870s, a burgeoning conflict between pro- and anti-temperance forces boiled over into the so-called &quot;Westerville Whiskey Wars&quot;. Twice, in 1875 and 1879, businessman Henry Corbin opened a saloon in Westerville, and each time the townspeople blew up his establishment with gunpowder. Westerville&#x27;s reputation for temperance was so significant that in 1909 the Anti-Saloon League moved its national headquarters from Washington, D.C. to Westerville. The League, at the forefront of the Prohibition movement, gained its greatest triumph when the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified in 1919. The League printed so many leaflets in support of temperance and prohibition—over 40 tons of mail per month—that Westerville, by then known as &quot;The Dry Capital of the World&quot;, was the smallest town in the nation to have a first class post office. The League&#x27;s Westerville headquarters was given to the Westerville Public Library in 1973 and now serves as a museum attached to the library. After Prohibition ended, Westerville remained dry for most of the twentieth century.

===Since 1915===
In 1916, Westerville became the first village (and second municipality) in Ohio to adopt a council-manager form of government, in which a city council makes policy but the town&#x27;s administrative and many of its executive governmental functions are vested in an appointed, professional manager. Westerville retains the council-manager system to the present day. The city elects seven council members at large for four-year terms; the council selects from among its own a member to serve as mayor, vice mayor, chair, and vice chair. Under the City Charter, the mayor is only &quot;the ceremonial head of the government&quot; of the city. The council additionally selects the city manager, who serves indefinitely. In 2007, David Collinsworth replaced David Lindimore as city manager after the latter&#x27;s tenure of twenty-two years. Collinsworth retired in January 2021 alongside assistant City Manager Julie Colley.

In 1995, the city annexed 941 non-dry acres of land to its north, which included several alcohol-selling businesses. Subsequently, voters have approved alcohol sales in old Westerville at a number of establishments through site-specific local options. In 2006 Michael&#x27;s Pizza served the first beer in Uptown Westerville in over 70 years. On October 15, 2019, Westerville hosted the fourth 2020 Democratic Primary Presidential Debate which had over 12 candidates on stage. To date, it is the largest primary debate in American history. In 2020 Westerville was named as the best suburban city in America based on a study conducted by Movoto Real Estate. The study, which surveyed criteria such as cost of living and crime, compared Westerville to 75 geographically diverse suburban cities across the nation.

==Education==

Otterbein University, a private four-year liberal arts college, was founded by the United Brethren Church in 1847 and is now home to over 3,000 students. The United Brethren Church has since merged with the Methodist Church and is now the United Methodist Church, with which the college continues to be affiliated.

Other colleges and universities in Westerville Ohio include Hondros College, Franklin University (branch), Dominion University, The Ohio State School of Cosmetology, Columbus State Westerville Center (branch) and Fortis College.

Westerville is served by the Westerville City School District. The district operates three high schools: Westerville South High School, an International Baccalaureate School, which opened in 1960 as Westerville High School; Westerville North High School (opened 1975); and Westerville Central High School (opened 2003). In addition, Westerville has five middle and sixteen elementary schools. The middle schools are Blendon, Genoa, Heritage, Minerva Park, and Walnut Springs. The elementary schools are Emerson (a magnet school that opened in 1896 as the Vine Street School), Hanby (magnet), Longfellow, Alcott, Annehurst, Cherrington, Fouse, Hawthorne, Huber Ridge, Mark Twain, McVay, Minerva France, Pointview, Robert Frost, Whittier, and Wilder.

==Transportation==
In the early days before the town&#x27;s incorporation, Westerville was connected to Columbus by a plank road with a toll of ten cents. Today, Westerville borders Interstate 71 and Interstate 270 (the Columbus Outerbelt), expressways that connect it with Columbus and other suburbs. Via the interstates, central Westerville is from downtown Columbus and from John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Central Ohio&#x27;s primary terminal for air passengers. State Route 3, the &quot;3-C Highway&quot; which connects Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati, is the chief north–south thoroughfare of the old town center, known as Uptown Westerville, through which it is called State Street.

Streetcars plied the avenues of Westerville from the late nineteenth century but service was discontinued in 1929. Today, Westerville offers little in the way of public transportation. The city itself operates no public buses, but the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) serves Westerville with five bus lines.

<doc id="150899" wikidata="Q1645063" url="?curid=150899" title="Milan, Ohio">
<text>Milan ( ) is a village in Erie and Huron counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 1,371 at the 2020 census. It is best known as the birthplace and childhood home of Thomas Edison.

The Erie County portion of Milan is part of the Sandusky Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Huron County portion is part of the Norwalk Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History and culture==
Milan village was platted by Ebenezer Scrooge in 1817 on the site of a previously abandoned Moravian Indian mission village, named &quot;Petquotting&quot;, (1805-1809). Scrooge dammed the Huron River below the village and established &quot;Scrooge&#x27;s Mills&quot;, a gristmill and sawmill in the river valley. Milan village, originally named &#x27;Beatty&#x27;, was incorporated as &#x27;Milan&#x27; in 1833, named after Milan, Italy. Prior to the advent of railroads, regional farmers had to bring their harvests to Lake Erie ports by wagon. The sandy and wet prairies north and west of Milan were not easily crossed by a wagon with a heavy harvest load. Beginning in 1826, local investors proposed a ship canal that would make Milan a lake port that could conveniently connect to the new Erie Canal, allowing direct regional commerce with New York City.

===1800s and the Milan Canal===
Construction of the Milan Canal began in 1833 and it opened to lake navigation on July 4, 1839. The peak year of commerce was 1847. For 15 years or more, the village prospered as one of the busiest ports on the Great Lakes. Large numbers of wagons bringing agricultural products to Milan would often line up for miles to the south.
During the canal era, Milan became the birthplace of businessman and inventor Thomas Alva Edison, and the small hillside brick home where he was born on February 11, 1847, is open to the public as a museum. He lived in Milan until he was 7 years of age, when his family moved to Port Huron, Michigan.

Local brokerages and trading houses exchanged the agricultural commodities of farmers for currency, hardware, and trade goods brought in across Lake Erie from the East by way of the Erie Canal. The Milan Canal was deep and directly connected to Lake Erie, allowing Lake Erie schooners to transport goods to and from Milan without the use of small, shallow-draft canal boats required on other canals. The confluence the deep ship-bearing canal, the great agricultural fertility of the regional Ohio soils, and the direct access to New York markets by way of the Erie Canal made Milan a retail center from the 1830s to the early 1850s. 
However, with the advent of railroads in the 1850s, the canal-borne prosperity terminated. In 1868, the canal&#x27;s feeder dam failed due to a flood, permanently ending Milan&#x27;s direct connection to the lake. The original canal route can be observed and followed today along the Erie MetroParks &quot;Huron River Greenway.&quot;

The deep canal and inland harbor also served as a ship building center, in part because of extensive local stands of white oak timber used in ship building. Approximately 60 ships were built in Milan between 1840 and 1867.

During the period, the canal-based prosperity allowed the construction of a large number of buildings of architectural note. Today, Milan retains a significant number of both residences and commercial buildings from the 19th century, representing typical architectural styles of the time.
From the late 1820s and into the 1830s, Federal Style buildings were constructed, many of which survive. In the 1840s and 50s, the Greek Revival style predominated in Milan, as it did in the rest of the Connecticut Western Reserve (the northeastern counties of Ohio). Today, Milan’s neighborhoods abound with original Greek Revival houses, along with a number of other later, Victorian architectural styles.

With the threat of proliferating railroads, mid-century canal interests were able to prevent their incursion into Milan. This effectively isolated the village from the flourishing post-Civil War economy that occurred in other Midwestern towns. Consequently, Milan’s development and expansion essentially terminated in the 1850s and 60s. Today, the majority of the canal-era mansions and other buildings remain intact, making Milan one of the finest sites for 19th-century architectural history in the Midwest. The Kelley Block on the village square, along with the impressive great houses on all of the village’s streets are remarkably preserved. In 2002, Milan was selected by The National Trust for Historic Preservation as a Distinctive Destination.

Melon farming prospered in the area due to sandy, fertile soil, and Milan hosts the &quot;Milan Melon Festival&quot; annually on Labor Day weekend. Although many residents commute to other cities for employment, the general culture of the area is decidedly rural, agricultural, and historic. Because of its limited development after the closure of the canal, Milan retains the ambiance of a 19th-century village with New England cultural and architectural affinities.

<doc id="150900" wikidata="Q2372709" url="?curid=150900" title="Vermilion, Ohio">
<text>Vermilion is a city in Erie and Lorain counties in the U.S. state of Ohio, on Lake Erie. Its population was 10,659 at the 2020 census. Located about 35 miles west of Cleveland and 17 miles east of Sandusky, it is part of the Cleveland metropolitan area and Sandusky micropolitan area.

== History ==
Vermilion was initially settled in the early 19th century and incorporated as a village in 1837. The city took its name from the nearby Vermilion River. It developed as a fishing and small-boat harbor. In 1847, the Congress of the United States built the Vermilion Lighthouse to aid navigation on Lake Erie.

As commerce grew in larger nearby cities, the Vermilion River proved inadequate to large commercial traffic. Later, recreational boating became very popular. During the early 20th century, the area became known as a resort community, featuring many beaches and cottages. Most structures were eventually converted to year-round use; many still are used as summer homes or vacation houses. Linwood Park in Vermilion is a good example.

Merging with the nearby village of Vermilion-on-the-Lake in 1960, Vermilion became a city, straddling Lorain and Erie Counties.

A local nonprofit group, Friends of Harbor Town, actively promotes tourism and the historical connection to Vermilion&#x27;s roots as a maritime community, using the slogan &quot;Harbor Town 1837&quot;.

<text>Canal Winchester is a city in Fairfield and Franklin counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The city is a suburb of Columbus. The population was 9,107 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Canal Winchester was founded in 1828 by Reuben Dove and John Colman. When construction of the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal came through Dove&#x27;s wheat field, he wanted to sue the state. The canal workmen instead convinced him that he would be better off laying out a town, because the area was midway between Columbus and Lancaster. On November 4, 1828, Dove and Colman recorded the first plat for Winchester, Ohio, in Violet Township, Fairfield County. Dove named the village after his father&#x27;s hometown of Winchester, Virginia.

Winchester flourished because of agriculture and transportation. The Ohio and Erie Canal brought passengers, freight and a means to transport grain to market. The first canal boat floated through Winchester in 1831. The village was named Canal Winchester when the post office was established in 1841, because there were five other locations in the state named Winchester.

A local legend explains how Canal Winchester received its post office. On Halloween, October 31, 1841, two teenage boys, as a prank, hooked two horses up to the foundation of the post office of the town of Waterloo and then pulled it across the street to Winchester. With this, the town of Waterloo was no more and Winchester was a legitimate village. The village was annexed to Madison Township, Franklin County, in 1851.

In May 1866, the Ohio Secretary of State granted incorporation papers for the Village of Canal Winchester.

In 1869, the railroad came to Canal Winchester, causing economic growth.

<doc id="150904" wikidata="Q367226" url="?curid=150904" title="Frederick III of Sicily">
<text>Frederick II (also Frederick III, &#x27;,&#x27;, &quot;&quot;); 13 December 1272 – 25 June 1337) was the regent of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1291 until 1295 and subsequently King of Sicily from 1295 until his death. He was the third son of Peter III of Aragon and served in the War of the Sicilian Vespers on behalf of his father and brothers, Alfonso ΙΙΙ and James ΙΙ. He was confirmed as king by the Peace of Caltabellotta in 1302. His reign saw important constitutional reforms: the &quot;Constitutiones regales&quot;, &quot;Capitula alia&quot;, and &quot;Ordinationes generales&quot;.

==Name==
Although the second Frederick of Sicily, he chose to call himself &quot;Frederick III&quot; (being one of the rare medieval monarchs who actually used a regnal number) – presumably because only some fifty years before, his well-known and remembered great-grandfather had ruled Sicily and also used an official ordinal: &quot;Fridericus secundus, imperator etc.&quot;. Thus, &quot;Fridericus tertius&quot; was better in line with the precedent of his ancestor&#x27;s ordinal. However, an anecdote attributes Frederick&#x27;s choice of numeral to him being the third son of Peter. The next man called Frederick to occupy the Sicilian throne was dubbed by later generations of historians as Frederick III: Frederick III the Simple, though he himself did not use an ordinal.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Frederick was born in Barcelona.

When his father died in 1285, he left the Kingdom of Aragon to his eldest son, Alfonso, and that of Sicily to his second son, James. When Alfonso died in 1291, James became king of Aragon and left Frederick as regent in Sicily. The war between the Angevins, who contested the title to Sicily from their peninsular possessions centred on Naples (the so-called Kingdom of Naples), and the Crown of Aragon for the possession of the island was still in progress, and although the Crown of Aragon was successful in Italy, James’ position in Spain became very insecure due to internal troubles and French attacks. Peace negotiations were begun with Charles II of Naples, but were interrupted by the successive deaths of two popes. At last, under the auspices of Pope Boniface VIII, James concluded a treaty, by which, in exchange for being left undisturbed in the rest of the territories belonging to the Crown of Aragon and promised possession of Sardinia and Corsica, he gave up Sicily to the Church, for whom it was to be held by the Angevins (Treaty of Anagni, 10 June 1295). The Sicilians refused to be made over once more to the hated French they had expelled in 1282 (in the Sicilian Vespers), and found a national leader in the regent Frederick. In vain the pope tried to bribe him with promises and dignities; he was determined to stand by his subjects, and was crowned king by the nobles at Palermo in 1296.

When Frederick heard that James was preparing to go to war with him, he sent a messenger, Mountainer Pérez de Sosa, to Catalonia in an effort to stir up the barons and cities against James in 1298. Mountainer carried with him an Occitan poem, &quot;Ges per guerra no.m chal aver consir&quot;, intended as a communication with his supporters in Catalonia. This communiqué seems to have had in mind Ponç Hug as a recipient, for the count penned a response (under the title &quot;con d&#x27;Empuria&quot;), &quot;A l&#x27;onrat rei Frederic terz vai dir&quot;, in which he praised Frederick&#x27;s tact and diplomacy, but told him bluntly that he would not abandon his sovereign. This poetic transaction is usually dated to January–March, Spring, or August 1296, but Gerónimo Zurita in the seventeenth century specifically dated the embassy of Mountainer to 1298.

===Reign===
Frederick reformed the administration and extended the powers of the Sicilian parliament, which was composed of the barons, the prelates, and the representatives of the towns.

His refusal to comply with the pope&#x27;s injunctions led to a renewal of the war. Frederick landed in Calabria, where he seized several towns, encouraged revolt in Naples, negotiated with the Ghibellines of Tuscany and Lombardy, and assisted the house of Colonna against Pope Boniface. In the meantime, James, who received many favours from the Church, married his sister Yolanda to Robert, the third son of Charles II. Unfortunately for Frederick, a part of the Catalan-Aragonese nobles of Sicily favoured King James, and both John of Procida and Roger of Lauria, the heroes of the war of the Vespers, went over to the Angevins, and the latter completely defeated the Sicilian fleet off Capo d&#x27;Orlando. Charles&#x27;s sons Robert and Philip landed in Sicily, but after capturing Catania were defeated by Frederick, Philip being taken prisoner (1299), while several Calabrian towns were captured by the Sicilians.

For two years more the fighting continued with varying success, until Charles of Valois, who had been sent by Boniface to invade Sicily, was forced to sue for peace, his army being decimated by disease. In August 1302 the Treaty of Caltabellotta was signed, by which Frederick was recognised king of Trinacria (the name Sicily was not to be used) for his lifetime, and was to marry Eleanor of Anjou, daughter of Charles II of Naples and Maria Arpad of Hungary. At Frederick&#x27;s death, the kingdom was to revert to the Angevins (this clause was inserted chiefly to allow Charles to save face) and Frederick&#x27;s children would receive compensation elsewhere. Boniface tried to induce King Charles to break the treaty, but the latter was only too anxious for peace. Finally, in May 1303, the pope ratified the treaty, albeit with changes and additions, which included Frederick agreeing to pay him a tribute.

For a few years Sicily enjoyed peace, and the kingdom was reorganised. However, on the descent of the emperor Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor into Italy, Frederick entered into an alliance with him, and in violation of the pact of Caltabellotta made war on the Angevins again (1313) and captured Reggio. He set sail for Tuscany to cooperate with the emperor, but on the latter&#x27;s death he returned to Sicily. Robert, who had succeeded Charles II in 1309, made several raids into the island, which suffered much material injury. A truce was concluded in 1317, but as the Sicilians had helped the north Italian Ghibellines in the attack on Genoa, and Frederick had seized some Church revenues for military purposes, Pope John XXII excommunicated him and placed the island under an interdict (1321) which lasted until 1335. An Angevin fleet and army, under Robert&#x27;s son Charles, was defeated at Palermo by Giovanni da Chiaramonte in 1325, and in 1326 and 1327 there were further Angevin raids on the island, until the descent into Italy of the next Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Bavarian distracted their attention. The election of Pope Benedict XII (1334), who was friendly to Frederick, promised a respite; but after fruitless negotiations the war broke out once more, and Chiaramonte went over to Robert, owing to a private feud.

In 1337 Frederick died at Paternò, and in spite of the Peace of Caltabellotta his son Peter II of Sicily succeeded him.

<text>New Holland is a village in Fayette and Pickaway counties in Ohio, United States. The population was 804 at the 2020 census.

The Pickaway County portion of New Holland is part of the Columbus Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Fayette County portion, often called West New Holland, is part of the Washington Court House Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== Name ==

The town was originally founded as Flemingsburgh (or Flemingsburg) on September 2, 1818, and was named for John Fleming, son of Captain Fleming of Berkeley County, Virginia, who settled in the area in 1802. The name was later changed to New Holland between 1818 and 1827. The village was named after Holland, the native land of a share of the first settlers. 

==History==

In 1818 the original settler&#x27;s native of Pennsylvania Dutch, Hollanders, and Germans settled on &quot;Four Corners,&quot; a tract of land in the Virginia Military District, granted to Wilkins Ogden in 1802. This tact was so called because it was, in a wilderness, the intersection of a stagecoach line running east and west, and an Indian foot trail going from north to south. This crossing is today the Main and Front Street intersection. 

The settlement soon outgrew its descriptive name and was then called Flemingsburgh, for John Fleming, son of Captain Fleming of Berkeley County, Virginia, who settled in New Holland in 1802. The name remained until about 1825 when the people were thinking about having a Post Office. The settlers being of Dutch descent, renamed their settlement New Holland, the name it remains today.

Most of the houses were log cabins build in a small cluster. There were few business places for trading at that time.

The state chartered New Holland as a village in 1834.

One of the most dramatic events in New Holland&#x27;s history came after the Civil War when a portion of General Sherman&#x27;s Union Army marched through the covered bridge on Zanesville Cincinnati Trace [U.S. Route 22] and through New Holland. This covered bridge, which spanned over North Fork of Paint Creek on U.S. Route 22, was built in 1840, stood until 1943. Some have claimed that the old, covered bridge is now preserved in the Henry Ford Museum at Dearborn, Michigan. While Henry Ford did express admiration for the bridge, its remnants were used as scrap wood. 

== Train Wreck ==

Much excitement was created on the evening of September 18, 1899, at 8 p.m., when two trains collided head on in the middle of town, at the railroad crossing located on North Main Street. 

Eastbound Engine 813 had been traveling at a high rate of speed and unbeknownst to its engineer, Charles Ditto, the train&#x27;s caboose and a few cars had become uncoupled at Kingsfred (located just west of Johnson&#x27;s Crossing in Union Township, Fayette County). As Engine 813 approached the village of New Holland Mr. Ditto spotted the oncoming westbound Engine 801. Setting off the train&#x27;s whistle, beginning about 1/2 mile outside of New Holland, Ditto attempted to signal to the brakeman to slow down for a stop, still unaware that the caboose, where the brakeman was located, had become unattached. Realizing what had happened, Ditto quickly put his train into reverse, but it was too late to avoid a collision with the other oncoming train. The engineer of Engine 801, Joe Todhunter, by this time had noticed the approaching Engine 813. In an attempt to save his train and a large amount of freight being carried by the train, uncoupled his engine and three cars, sending them on to meet the approaching train. Eyewitness accounts claimed that the impact of the two trains was so forceful that it could be heard for several miles around. Both engines raised high into the air upon impact and crashed to the ground. Engine 801, a newer engine, suffered heavy damage, with one of its cars being completely demolished. Engine 813 meanwhile was completely destroyed, its tender being overthrown and seven of its cars were demolished, with most of them being thrown across the tracks. The impact had forced one of the cars over another after its wheels were sheared off. Another box car was broken into pieces, with about half of it being thrown and crashing into the back of the Gooley Brother&#x27;s Implement Store. Fortunately, no injuries occurred as a result of the crash. Both engineers and firemen had jumped to safety just moments before the collision took place. Losses from the crash were estimated at $10,000 [roughly $373,891.67 today], and took workmen from about 10 p.m. that evening until the next morning to clean up the wreckage and debris.

== Village Government ==
First records of government date back to 1802. This was an abstract deed which listed the Mayor of Four Corners as John McDonald. The next date in the abstract which lists the mayor&#x27;s name is March 14, 1837, and he was Francis Wilson. Also, Reverend Wilson is connected with the date of November 18, 1835, as mayor.

The first completed records of city government date back to April 6, 1869, when the first council chamber was organized. W.W. Blanedin was the mayor and council members were G.W. Gooley, S.R. Collier, J.M. Turner, and Henry Judy. S.S. McCallister was the recorder and J.D. Miller, by appointment, was the Marshall. Council met at McCafferty&#x27;s hall on Saturday evening at seven o&#x27;clock. 

Many records have been destroyed, misplaced, or are unavailable so that a complete list of mayors is not available. This is as complete as could be gathered: 
=== Current Officers ===
The village currently is served by Joe Inskeep as mayor. The current Village Administrator is Harold DeSanto, Utility Clerk is Diane Fisk, Fiscal Officer is Carmen White, Clerk of Courts is Michele Ervin, Chief of Police is Jason Lawless, and Village Council Members are Greg Shaw &quot;(President Pro-Tempore)&quot;, Danny Kirkpatrick, Floyd Woolever, Zachary Fisk, Brittany Rodriquez, and Jimmy Thompson.

=== Controversy ===
On July 23, 2018, New Holland Police Sergeant Brad Mick was fired, after filing charges against his Mayor, Police Chief, and Former Police Chief. Mick charged New Holland Interim Police Chief David Conrad with forgery, Mayor Butch Betzko with complicity to forgery, and former Chief Jason Lawless with dereliction of duty and telecommunications harassment. In a statement, the attorney representing the Village said Mick &quot;abused his position,&quot; and was pursuing a &quot;personal agenda with these baseless charges.&quot; The village also accused him of violating &quot;the established chain of command&quot; and conducting &quot;an improper search and destruction of Village property.&quot; Mick released a statement saying: &quot;My termination does not undo the criminal acts by others, and it will not erase evidence or dismiss the charges. While it is disheartening and a violation of the law to be retaliated against and terminated for obeying the oath of office, it does not stop here.&quot;

The charges were later dropped, and Jason Lawless was appointed Police Chief again.

<text>In mathematics, the ideal class group (or class group) of an algebraic number field is the quotient group where is the group of fractional ideals of the ring of integers of , and is its subgroup of principal ideals. The class group is a measure of the extent to which unique factorization fails in the ring of integers of . The order of the group, which is finite, is called the class number of .

The theory extends to Dedekind domains and their fields of fractions, for which the multiplicative properties are intimately tied to the structure of the class group. For example, the class group of a Dedekind domain is trivial if and only if the ring is a unique factorization domain.

== History and origin of the ideal class group ==

Ideal class groups (or, rather, what were effectively ideal class groups) were studied some time before the idea of an ideal was formulated. These groups appeared in the theory of quadratic forms: in the case of binary integral quadratic forms, as put into something like a final form by Carl Friedrich Gauss, a composition law was defined on certain equivalence classes of forms. This gave a finite abelian group, as was recognised at the time.

Later Ernst Kummer was working towards a theory of cyclotomic fields. It had been realised (probably by several people) that failure to complete proofs in the general case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem by factorisation using the roots of unity was for a very good reason: a failure of unique factorization – i.e., the fundamental theorem of arithmetic – to hold in the rings generated by those roots of unity was a major obstacle. Out of Kummer&#x27;s work for the first time came a study of the obstruction to the factorization. We now recognise this as part of the ideal class group: in fact Kummer had isolated the &quot;p&quot;-torsion in that group for the field of &quot;p&quot;-roots of unity, for any prime number &quot;p&quot;, as the reason for the failure of the standard method of attack on the Fermat problem (see regular prime).

Somewhat later again Richard Dedekind formulated the concept of an ideal, Kummer having worked in a different way. At this point the existing examples could be unified. It was shown that while rings of algebraic integers do not always have unique factorization into primes (because they need not be principal ideal domains), they do have the property that every proper ideal admits a unique factorization as a product of prime ideals (that is, every ring of algebraic integers is a Dedekind domain). The size of the ideal class group can be considered as a measure for the deviation of a ring from being a principal ideal domain; a ring is a principal ideal domain if and only if it has a trivial ideal class group.

== Definition ==

If &quot;R&quot; is an integral domain, define a relation ~ on nonzero fractional ideals of &quot;R&quot; by &quot;I&quot; ~ &quot;J&quot; whenever there exist nonzero elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; of &quot;R&quot; such that (&quot;a&quot;)&quot;I&quot; = (&quot;b&quot;)&quot;J&quot;. (Here the notation (&quot;a&quot;) means the principal ideal of &quot;R&quot; consisting of all the multiples of &quot;a&quot;.) It is easily shown that this is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called the &quot;ideal classes&quot; of &quot;R&quot;.
Ideal classes can be multiplied: if [&quot;I&quot;] denotes the equivalence class of the ideal &quot;I&quot;, then the multiplication [&quot;I&quot;][&quot;J&quot;] = [&quot;IJ&quot;] is well-defined and commutative. The principal ideals form the ideal class [&quot;R&quot;] which serves as an identity element for this multiplication. Thus a class [&quot;I&quot;] has an inverse [&quot;J&quot;] if and only if there is an ideal &quot;J&quot; such that &quot;IJ&quot; is a principal ideal. In general, such a &quot;J&quot; may not exist and consequently the set of ideal classes of &quot;R&quot; may only be a monoid.

However, if &quot;R&quot; is the ring of algebraic integers in an algebraic number field, or more generally a Dedekind domain, the multiplication defined above turns the set of fractional ideal classes into an abelian group, the ideal class group of &quot;R&quot;. The group property of existence of inverse elements follows easily from the fact that, in a Dedekind domain, every non-zero ideal (except &quot;R&quot;) is a product of prime ideals.

==Properties==
The ideal class group is trivial (i.e. has only one element) if and only if all ideals of &quot;R&quot; are principal. In this sense, the ideal class group measures how far &quot;R&quot; is from being a principal ideal domain, and hence from satisfying unique prime factorization (Dedekind domains are unique factorization domains if and only if they are principal ideal domains).

The number of ideal classes (the of &quot;R&quot;) may be infinite in general. In fact, every abelian group is isomorphic to the ideal class group of some Dedekind domain. But if &quot;R&quot; is a ring of algebraic integers, then the class number is always &quot;finite&quot;. This is one of the main results of classical algebraic number theory.

Computation of the class group is hard, in general; it can be done by hand for the ring of integers in an algebraic number field of small discriminant, using Minkowski&#x27;s bound. This result gives a bound, depending on the ring, such that every ideal class contains an ideal norm less than the bound. In general the bound is not sharp enough to make the calculation practical for fields with large discriminant, but computers are well suited to the task.

The mapping from rings of integers &quot;R&quot; to their corresponding class groups is functorial, and the class group can be subsumed under the heading of algebraic K-theory, with &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;R&quot;) being the functor assigning to &quot;R&quot; its ideal class group; more precisely, &quot;K&quot;0(&quot;R&quot;) = Z×&quot;C&quot;(&quot;R&quot;), where &quot;C&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is the class group. Higher K groups can also be employed and interpreted arithmetically in connection to rings of integers.

==Relation with the group of units==
It was remarked above that the ideal class group provides part of the answer to the question of how much ideals in a Dedekind domain behave like elements. The other part of the answer is provided by the group of units of the Dedekind domain, since passage from principal ideals to their generators requires the use of units (and this is the rest of the reason for introducing the concept of fractional ideal, as well):

Define a map from &quot;R&quot;× to the set of all nonzero fractional ideals of &quot;R&quot; by sending every element to the principal (fractional) ideal it generates. This is a group homomorphism; its kernel is the group of units of &quot;R&quot;, and its cokernel is the ideal class group of &quot;R&quot;. The failure of these groups to be trivial is a measure of the failure of the map to be an isomorphism: that is the failure of ideals to act like ring elements, that is to say, like numbers.

== Examples of ideal class groups ==

* The rings Z, Z[ω], and Z[&quot;i&quot;], where ω is a cube root of 1 and &quot;i&quot; is a fourth root of 1 (i.e. a square root of −1), are all principal ideal domains (and in fact are all Euclidean domains), and so have class number 1: that is, they have trivial ideal class groups. 
*If &quot;k&quot; is a field, then the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, &quot;X&quot;3, ...] is an integral domain. It has a countably infinite set of ideal classes.

=== Class numbers of quadratic fields ===
If formula_1 is a square-free integer (a product of distinct primes) other than 1, then formula_2 is a quadratic extension of Q. If formula_3, then the class number of the ring formula_4 of algebraic integers of formula_2 is equal to 1 for precisely the following values of formula_1: formula_7. This result was first conjectured by Gauss and proven by Kurt Heegner, although Heegner&#x27;s proof was not believed until Harold Stark gave a later proof in 1967. (See Stark–Heegner theorem.) This is a special case of the famous class number problem.

If, on the other hand, &quot;d&quot; &gt; 0, then it is unknown whether there are infinitely many fields formula_2 with class number 1. Computational results indicate that there are a great many such fields. However, it is not even known if there are infinitely many number fields with class number 1.

For &quot;d&quot; &lt; 0, the ideal class group of formula_2 is isomorphic to the class group of integral binary quadratic forms of discriminant equal to the discriminant of formula_2. For &quot;d&quot; &gt; 0, the ideal class group may be half the size since the class group of integral binary quadratic forms is isomorphic to the narrow class group of formula_2.

For real quadratic integer rings, the class number is given in OEIS A003649; for the imaginary case, they are given in OEIS A000924.

==== Example of a non-trivial class group ====

The quadratic integer ring &quot;R&quot; = Z[] is the ring of integers of Q(). It does &quot;not&quot; possess unique factorization; in fact the class group of &quot;R&quot; is cyclic of order 2. Indeed, the ideal
: &quot;J&quot; = (2, 1 + )
is not principal, which can be proved by contradiction as follows. formula_4 has a norm function formula_13, which satisfies formula_14, and formula_15 if and only if formula_16 is a unit in formula_4. First of all, formula_18, because the quotient ring of formula_4 modulo the ideal formula_20 is isomorphic to formula_21, so that the quotient ring of formula_4 modulo formula_23 is isomorphic to formula_24. If &quot;J&quot; were generated by an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, then &quot;x&quot; would divide both 2 and 1 + . Then the norm formula_25 would divide both formula_26 and formula_27, so &quot;N&quot;(x) would divide 2. If formula_28 then formula_29 is a unit and formula_30, a contradiction. But formula_25 cannot be 2 either, because &quot;R&quot; has no elements of norm 2, because the Diophantine equation formula_32 has no solutions in integers, as it has no solutions modulo 5.

One also computes that &quot;J&quot; 2 = (2), which is principal, so the class of &quot;J&quot; in the ideal class group has order two. Showing that there aren&#x27;t any &quot;other&quot; ideal classes requires more effort. 

The fact that this &quot;J&quot; is not principal is also related to the fact that the element 6 has two distinct factorisations into irreducibles:
: 6 = 2 × 3 = (1 + ) × (1 − ).

== Connections to class field theory ==

Class field theory is a branch of algebraic number theory which seeks to classify all the abelian extensions of a given algebraic number field, meaning Galois extensions with abelian Galois group. A particularly beautiful example is found in the Hilbert class field of a number field, which can be defined as the maximal unramified abelian extension of such a field. The Hilbert class field &quot;L&quot; of a number field &quot;K&quot; is unique and has the following properties:

* Every ideal of the ring of integers of &quot;K&quot; becomes principal in &quot;L&quot;, i.e., if &quot;I&quot; is an integral ideal of &quot;K&quot; then the image of &quot;I&quot; is a principal ideal in &quot;L&quot;.
* &quot;L&quot; is a Galois extension of &quot;K&quot; with Galois group isomorphic to the ideal class group of &quot;K&quot;.

Neither property is particularly easy to prove.

<text>Swanton is a village located in Fulton and Lucas counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 3,897 at the 2020 census. Total area is .

==History==

A post office called Swanton has been in operation since 1827. The village takes its name from nearby Swan Creek.

In the heyday of steam power, Swanton was home to the A. D. Baker Company, a manufacturer of steam powered traction engines and road contractors&#x27; equipment. It was at the Baker Company that an improved valve gear for steam engines was developed. A Baker employee named Gifford is credited with the initial idea, which was subsequently developed into the Baker valve gear and patented in 1903. Baker valve gear was eventually manufactured by The Pilliod Company, another Swanton business. Baker valve gear from Pilliod saw widespread use on U.S. steam locomotives for railroads in the first half of the 20th century.

On February 15, 1992, Air Transport International Flight 805 crashed in Swanton, killing all four people on board.

On June 6, 2019, a vehicle left parked on the tracks next to the Main Street railroad crossing resulted in a derailment that knocked out power to the town and much of the surrounding area, and hampered traffic on one of the main rail lines linking the Midwest to the East Coast.

<text>Kettering is a city in Montgomery County, Ohio, United States. It is an inner suburb of Dayton. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 57,862, making it the most populous suburb in the Dayton metropolitan area.

==History==
The area where the city of Kettering now lies was settled from the late 1700s to the mid-1800s, largely as farmland. The population in the area started to grow, prompting the creation of (now defunct) Van Buren Township in 1841. In November 1952, township voters approved incorporating as the Village of Kettering. (In 1953, the western portion of the village voted to secede, forming a new township, which is now the City of Moraine). By 1955, the village&#x27;s population had grown to 38,118, which qualified it to claim city status, with the official proclamation by the state on June 24. The city is named for inventor Charles F. Kettering, who resided here in his home, Ridgeleigh Terrace, from 1914 until his death in 1958. Charles Kettering is known for his numerous inventions and contributions to Metro Dayton.

From the 1950s to the 1970s, Kettering&#x27;s population continued to grow, adding more than 30,000 residents. This growth was due in part to the many people who started migrating out of nearby Dayton after World War II. Since the 1980s, Kettering has experienced a slow decline in population due to an aging population and loss of manufacturing jobs.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is bordered by Dayton, Riverside, and Oakwood to the north; West Carrollton and Moraine to the west; Miami Township to the southwest; Centerville and Washington Township to the south; and Beavercreek and Sugarcreek Township to the east.

<doc id="150911" wikidata="Q730187" url="?curid=150911" title="Wright-Patterson Air Force Base">
<text>Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB) is a United States Air Force base and census-designated place just east of Dayton, Ohio, in Greene and Montgomery counties. It includes both Wright and Patterson Fields, which were originally Wilbur Wright Field and Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot. Patterson Field is approximately northeast of Dayton; Wright Field is approximately northeast of Dayton.

The host unit at Wright-Patterson AFB is the 88th Air Base Wing (88 ABW), assigned to the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center and Air Force Materiel Command. The 88 ABW operates the airfield, maintains all infrastructure and provides security, communications, medical, legal, personnel, contracting, finance, transportation, air traffic control, weather forecasting, public affairs, recreation and chaplain services for more than 60 associate units. The Air Force&#x27;s National Air Intelligence Center (NAIC) and the Space Force&#x27;s National Space Intelligence Center (NSIC) are also garrisoned there and are the Intelligence Community&#x27;s primary organizations for strategic air and space threat analysis.

The base&#x27;s origin begins with the establishment of Wilbur Wright Field on 22 May 1917 and McCook Field in November 1917, both established by the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps as World War I installations. McCook was used as a testing field and for aviation experiments. Wright was used as a flying field (renamed Patterson Field in 1931); Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot; armorers&#x27; school, and a temporary storage depot. McCook&#x27;s functions were transferred to Wright Field when it was closed in October 1927. Wright-Patterson AFB was established in 1948 as a merger of Patterson and Wright Fields.

In 1995, negotiations to end the Bosnian War were held at the base, resulting in the Dayton Agreement, ending the war.

The 88th Air Base Wing is commanded by Col. Travis W. Pond on an interim basis due to the removal of Col. Christopher B. Meeker who was relieved due to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead. Its Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Lloyd E. Morales. The base had a total of 27,406 military, civilian and contract employees in 2010. The Greene County portion of the base is a census-designated place (CDP), with a resident population of 1,821 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Prehistoric Indian mounds of the Adena culture at Wright-Patterson are along P Street and, at the Wright Brothers Memorial, a hilltop mound group.

Aircraft operations on land now part of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base began in 1904–1905 when Wilbur and Orville Wright used an plot of Huffman Prairie for experimental test flights with the Wright Flyer III. Their flight exhibition company and the Wright Company School of Aviation returned 1910–1916 to use the flying field.

World War I transfers of land that later became WPAFB include (including the Huffman Prairie Flying Field) along the Mad River leased to the Army by the Miami Conservancy District, the adjacent purchased by the Army from the District for the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot, and a complex for McCook Field just north of downtown Dayton between Keowee Street and the Great Miami River. In 1918, Wilbur Wright Field agreed to let McCook Field use hangar and shop space as well as its enlisted mechanics to assemble and maintain airplanes and engines under the direction of Chief of Air Service Mason Patrick.

After World War I, 347 German aircraft were brought to the United States—some were incorporated into the Army Aeronautical Museum (in 1923 the Engineering Division at McCook Field &quot;first collected technical artifacts for preservation&quot;). The training school at Wilbur Wright Field was discontinued. Wilbur Wright Field and the depot merged after World War I to form the Fairfield Air Depot. The Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in two days and purchased northeast of Dayton, including Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field.

In 1924, the committee presented the deeds to President Calvin Coolidge for the construction of a new aviation engineering center. The entire acreage (including the Fairfield Air Depot) was designated Wright Field, which had units such as the Headquarters, 5th Division Air Service (redesignated 5th Division Aviation in 1928), and its 88th Observation Squadron and 7th Photo Section. New facilities were built 1925–27 on the portion of Wright Field west of Huffman Dam to house all of the McCook Field functions being relocated.

===Wright and Patterson fields===
Wright Field was &quot;formally dedicated&quot; on 12 October 1927 when &quot;the Materiel Division moved from McCook Field to the new site&quot; At the time of the dedication expenditures of approximately $5 million had been involved in the new facility after 18 months work, with the total amount expected to rise to between $7 and $8 million. The ceremonies included the John L. Mitchell Trophy Race (won by Lt. I. A. Woodring of the 1st Pursuit Group—Speed: 158.968 mph) and Orville Wright raising the flag over the new engineering center.

On 1 July 1931, the portion of Wright Field east of Huffman Dam (land known today as Areas A and C of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base which included the Fairfield Air Depot and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field) was redesignated &quot;Patterson Field&quot; in honor of Lieutenant Frank Stuart Patterson. Lt. Patterson was the son of Frank J. Patterson, co-founder of National Cash Register.

Shortly before the end of WW1, 1Lt Patterson and observer 2Lt LeRoy Swan, both of the 137th Aero Squadron, were killed at Wright Field in the crash of their de Havilland DH.4 after its wings collapsed during a dive while firing at ground targets with a new synchronized-through–the–propeller machine gun. Patterson&#x27;s grave and memorial arch is at Woodland Cemetery and Aborateum in Dayton, Ohio.

===World War II===

The area&#x27;s World War II Army Air Fields had employment increase from approximately 3,700 in December 1939 to over 50,000 at the war&#x27;s peak. Wright Field grew from approximately 30 buildings to a facility with some 300 buildings and the Air Corps&#x27; first modern paved runways. The original part of the field became saturated with office and laboratory buildings and test facilities. The Hilltop area was acquired from private landowners in 1943–1944 to provide troop housing and services. 

The portion of Patterson Field from Huffman Dam through the Brick Quarters (including the command headquarters in Building 10262) at the south end of Patterson Field along Route 4 was administratively reassigned from Patterson Field to Wright Field. To avoid confusing the two areas of Wright Field, the south end of the former Patterson Field portion was designated &quot;Area A&quot;, the original Wright Field became &quot;Area B&quot;, and the north end of Patterson Field, including the flying field, &quot;Area C.&quot;

In February 1940 at Wright Field, the Army Air Corps established the Technical Data Branch (Technical Data Section in July 1941, Technical Data Laboratory in 1942). After Air Corps Ferrying Command was established on 29 May 1941, on 21 June an installation point of the command opened at Patterson Field. The Flight Test Training unit of Air Technical Command was established at Wright Field on 9 September 1944 (moved to Patterson Field in 1946, Edwards AFB on 4 February 1951).

Two densely populated housing and service areas across Highway 444, Wood City and Skyway Park, were geographically separated from the central core of Patterson Field and developed almost self-sufficient community status. (Wood City was acquired in 1924 as part of the original donation of land to the government but was used primarily as just a radio range until World War II. Skyway Park was acquired in 1943.) They supported the vast numbers of recruits who enlisted and were trained at the two fields as well as thousands of civilian laborers, especially single women recruited to work at the depot. Skyway Park was demolished after the war. Wood City was eventually transformed into Kittyhawk Center, the base&#x27;s modern commercial and recreation center.

In the fall of 1942, the first twelve &quot;Air Force&quot; officers to receive ATI field collection training were assigned to Wright Field for training in the technical aspects of &quot;crash&quot; intelligence (RAF Squadron Leader Colley identified how to obtain information from equipment marking plates and squadron markings. In July 1944 during the Robot Blitz, Wright Field fired a reconstructed German pulse-jet engine (an entire V-1 flying bomb was by 8 September at Republic Aviation.)

The first German and Japanese aircraft arrived in 1943, and captured equipment soon filled six buildings, a large outdoor storage area, and part of a flight-line hangar for Technical Data Lab study (TDL closed its Army Aeronautical Museum). The World War II Operation Lusty returned 86 German aircraft to Wright Field for study, e.g., the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, while the post-war Operation Paperclip brought German scientists and technicians to Wright Field, e.g., Ernst R. G. Eckert (most of the scientists eventually went to work in the various Wright Field labs.)

===UFO studies / sightings===
Project Sign (Project Grudge in 1949, Project Blue Book in March 1952) was WPAFB&#x27;s T-2 Intelligence investigations of unidentified flying objects (UFO) reports that began in July 1947. In 1951, the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) began analysis of crashed Soviet aircraft from the Korean war. In March 1952, ATIC established an Aerial Phenomena Group to study reported UFO sightings, including those in Washington, DC, in 1952. By 1969, the Foreign Technology Division (FTD) and its predecessor organizations had studied 12,618 reported sightings: 701 remained unexplained when the Air Force closed its UFO investigations, and a 1968 report concluded that &quot;there seems to be no reason to attribute [the unexplained sightings] to an extraterrestrial source without much more convincing evidence.&quot;

The FTD sent all of its case files to the USAF Historical Research Center, which transferred them in 1976 to the National Archives and Records Service in Washington, DC, which became the permanent repository of the Project Sign/Grudge/Blue Book records. In a 1988 interview, Senator Barry Goldwater claimed he had asked Gen. Curtis LeMay for access to a secret UFO room at WPAFB and an angry LeMay said, &quot;Not only can&#x27;t you get into it but don&#x27;t you ever mention it to me again.&quot;

===Technical base===
The Army Air Forces Technical Base (Air Force Technical Base before being designated a USAF base) was formed on 15 December 1945, under Brig Gen Joseph T. Morris, during the World War II drawdown by merging Wright Field, Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and—acquired by Wright Field for 1942 glider testing—Clinton Army Air Field. The Jamestown Radar Annex became a leased installation of the Technical Base in 1946, and the &quot;custodial units at Dayton and Clinton County AAFlds were discontinued in 1946&quot;.

An 8000-foot concrete runway with 1000-foot runoffs at each end was built 1946–1947 in Area C to accommodate very heavy bombers, initially referred to locally as the &quot;B-36 runway&quot;. The 1947 All-Altitude Speed Course at Vandalia became a detached installation of the Technical Base. After the USAF was created in September 1947, Morris&#x27; base headquarters was redesignated Headquarters, Air Force Technical Base, on 15 December 1947.

===USAF base===
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was redesignated from the Air Force Technical Base on 13 January 1948—the former Wright Field Areas A and B remained, while Patterson Field became &quot;Area C&quot; and Skyway Park became &quot;Area D&quot; of the installation. In 1951 all locally based flying activities were moved to the Area B flight line. The 1948 All-Altitude Speed Course, later the Missile Tracking Annex, at Sulphur Grove, Ohio became a detached installation of Wright-Patt.

Headquarters, Air Engineering Development Division, was at WPAFB from 1 January 1950 to 14 November 1950, followed by the Air Research and Development Command from 16 November 1950 to 24 June 1951 (began move to Baltimore on 11 May 1951). By 1952 the WPAFB headquarters of the Wright Air Development Center (WADC) included a Plans and Operations Department (WOO) and Divisions for Aeronautics (WCN), Flight Test (WCT), Research (WCR), Weapons Components (WCE), Weapons Systems (WCS). On 15 February, WADC medical examinations &quot;for the final selection of the Mercury astronauts were started&quot; at the Aerospace Medical Laboratory (Wright-Patt test pilots Neil Armstrong and Ed White became NASA astronauts.)

From 6 March 1950 to 1 December 1951, Clinton County Air Force Base was assigned as a sub-base of WPAFB, and from 1950 to 1955, Wright-Patt had two Central Air Defense Force fighter-interceptor squadrons (1 from 1955 to 1960).
===Cold War expansions===
In 1954, of land adjacent to the Mad River at the northeast boundary of the base, near the former location of the village of Osborn, were purchased for a Strategic Air Command dispersal site. Area D structures were demolished in 1957 (donated to the state in 1963 for Wright State University). In February 1958 the Wright Field (Area B) runways were closed to all jet traffic (1959 Area C operations included 139,276 takeoffs and landings, Area B had 44,699.) The West Ramp complex was built between August 1958 and July 1960.

The 4043rd Strategic Wing began KC-135 Stratotanker operations in February 1960 and B-52 Stratofortress operations in June 1960. On 1 July 1963, the wing was re-designated the 17th Bombardment Wing (Heavy) and continued its mission under this unit until 7 July 1975, when the last of its 11 B-52s was transferred to Beale Air Force Base, California. From 1957–1962, WADC&#x27;s Hurricane Supersonic Research Site in Utah was a detached installation of Wright-Patt.

The NORAD Manual Air Defense Control Center for 58th Air Division interceptors was at Wright-Patterson AFB by 1958, and Brookfield Air Force Station near the Pennsylvania state line became operational as an April 1952 – January 1963 sub-base of WPAFB. The 1954–79 &quot;Wright-Patterson Communications Facility #4&quot; was at Yellow Springs, Ohio (which also had the 1965–77 Celestial Guidance Research Site.)

WPAFB also had an Army Air Defense Command Post for nearby Project Nike surface-to-air missile sites of the Cincinnati-Dayton Defense Area were at Wilmington (CD-27, ); Felicity (CD-46, ); Dillsboro (CD-63), and Oxford (CD-78, ). The AADCP activated in the spring of 1960 and moved to Wilmington—with BIRDIE CCCS—by 1965 (closed March 1971). Wilkins Air Force Station was a 1961–8 Air Defense Command station of Wright-Patt, and Gentile Air Force Station (later the Gentile Defense Electronics Supply Center) was assigned to the base on 1 July 1962.

In December 1975, Advanced Range Instrumentation Aircraft transferred to the 4950th Test Wing at WPAFB. Following the July 1992 merging of WPAFB labs, the base&#x27;s Wright Laboratory included a Flight Dynamics Directorate. Superfund sites (39 initial areas) of WPAFB were found to be contaminated with chlorinated volatile organic compounds and benzene compounds (soils and groundwater), and an EPA/USAF Federal Facilities Agreement was signed in 1981 for remediation and continued investigation (the Installation Restoration Program for WPAFB identified 65 areas, including 13 landfills, 12 earth fill disposal zones, 9 fuel or chemical spill sites, 6 coal storage piles, 5 fire-training areas, 4 chemical burial sites, and 2 underground storage tanks). In November 1995, the &quot;Dayton Peace Accords&quot; held at WPAFB created the &quot;Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina&quot; signed in Paris on 14 December.

===Huffman Prairie designation===
Huffman Prairie was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1990 and named part of the 1992 Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park. The West Ramp facility switched from the 4950th Test Wing to AFRC&#x27;s 445th Airlift Wing with C-17 Globemaster III transports. The permanent party work force at WPAFB as of 30 September 2005, numbered 5,517 military and 8,102 civilian.

===Dayton Agreement===
In 1995, Alija Izetbegović, the President of Bosnia and Herzegovina; Franjo Tuđman, the President of Croatia; and Slobodan Milošević, the President of Serbia, arrived at Wright-Patterson AFB to commence negotiations to end the Bosnian War, an ethnic conflict that by 1995 was between the Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Bosniaks and the Croats (who had put aside their differences) on one side versus Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s Serbs on the other side. American diplomat Richard Holbrooke led the negotiations. Eventually an agreement was made to have Bosnia and Herzegovina have two internal entities, a Bosniak-Croat federation known as the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a Serb territory known as Republika Srpska.

===2019–22 coronavirus pandemic===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the base sent airmen from the 88th Medical Group to Detroit for two months, where they set up a COVID-19 vaccination site in support of the Federal Emergency Management whole-of-government COVID response. The base sent medical Air Force professionals to New York City after airmen from the 445th Airlift Wing were deployed to aid the city&#x27;s response.

The oldest and largest military aircraft museum in the world, it houses such aircraft as the only XB-70 Valkyrie in existence, an F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, and the World War II B-17 bomber, &quot;Memphis Belle&quot;.

==Role and operations==

Wright-Patterson AFB is &quot;one of the largest, most diverse, and organizationally complex bases in the Air Force&quot; with a long history of flight tests spanning from the Wright Brothers into the Space Age.

It is the headquarters of the Air Force Materiel Command, one of the major commands of the Air Force. &quot;Wright-Patt&quot; (as the base is colloquially called) is also the location of a major USAF Medical Center (hospital), the Air Force Institute of Technology, and the National Museum of the United States Air Force, formerly known as the U.S. Air Force Museum.

The 88th Air Base Wing consists of more than 5,000 officers, enlisted Air Force, civilian and contractor employees responsible for three primary mission areas: operating the installation; deploying expeditionary Airmen in support of the Global War on Terrorism; and defending the base and its people.

It is also the home base of the 445th Airlift Wing of the Air Force Reserve Command, an Air Mobility Command-gained unit which flies the C-17 Globemaster heavy airlifter. Wright-Patterson is also the headquarters of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center and the Air Force Research Laboratory.

Wright-Patterson is the host of the annual United States Air Force Marathon which occurs the weekend closest to the Air Force&#x27;s anniversary.

The base conducts neurotechnology research.

==Geography==
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base includes Area A (former Patterson Field and Wood City area) and Area B (former Wright Field). The USGS Geographic Names Information System separately designates the military installation, the airport, and the census-designated place (CDP). The CDP area, entirely in Greene County, primarily in Bath Township and extending south into Beavercreek Township, is , with of it (0.80%) being water. The southwest end of the base, now the National Museum of the United States Air Force, is within the city of Riverside in Montgomery County.

==Demographics==
In 2010, Wright-Patt had a total of 27,406 military, civilian and contract employees. As of the census of 2000, there were 6,656 people, 1,754 households, and 1,704 families residing on the base. The population density was 219.8/km2 (569.2/sq mi). There were 2,096 housing units at an average density of 69.2/km2 (179.2/sq mi). The racial makeup of the base was 76.11% White, 15.25% Black or African American, 0.45% Native American, 2.30% Asian, 0.12% Pacific Islander, 2.09% from other races, and 3.68% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 4.45% of the population.

There were 1,754 households, out of which 78.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 89.0% were married couples living together, 6.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 2.8% were non-families. 2.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and none had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.60 and the average family size was 3.64.

On the base the population was spread out, with 42.5% under the age of 18, 11.6% from 18 to 24, 41.5% from 25 to 44, 4.2% from 45 to 64, and 0.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 23 years. For every 100 females there were 105.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 104.1 males.

The median income for a household on the base was $43,342, and the median income for a family was $43,092. Males had a median income of $30,888 versus $21,044 for females. The per capita income for the base was $15,341. About 1.6% of families and 1.8% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.4% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

As of 30 September 2005, Wright-Patterson had base housing amounting to 2,012 single-family units, 300 units for unaccompanied enlisted personnel, and 455 visitor or temporary living units.

==Environmental problems==
In May 2016, the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency ordered a drinking water well on the base to be shut down because of water contamination with perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a persistent chemical used in firefighting foam. April 2016 water samples from two wells showed 110 parts per trillion of PFOS, which is above the new EPA lifetime threshold of 70 parts per trillion. In June 2016, the EPA asked the base commander to speedily clean up the wells to prevent the contaminants from reaching more wells on base and Dayton&#x27;s seven drinking water wells at Huffman Dam. Base officials stated in June 2020 that the on-base ground water tests confirmed that current PFOS contamination is below EPA required levels, a claim the City of Dayton disputes.

==In popular culture==
Hangar 18 in Area B is purported to be the repository of a crashed UFO from Roswell, New Mexico and UFO research in general.

Thrash metal band Megadeth released the song &quot;Hangar 18&quot; on their 1990 album &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;.

The base was featured in the young adult book series &quot;The 5th Wave&quot; and the 2016 film of the same name as the base of operations for &quot;The Others&quot;.

The base appears as the third level of the 1998 game Twisted Metal 3 which houses a large spacecraft that can be accessed.

==Notable people==
*Marcus Freeman, football player and coach, born on the base
*Steve Hertz, baseball player and coach, born on the base

<text>Fostoria (, ) is a city located at the convergence of Hancock, Seneca, and Wood counties in the northwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 13,046 at the 2020 Census, slightly down from 13,441 at the 2010 Census. It is approximately south of Toledo and north of Columbus. The community grew substantially during the end of the 19th century, coinciding with the northwest Ohio gas boom. Typical of Rust Belt cities, Fostoria peaked in size in 1970.

Fostoria was a major site for the glass industry, having over a dozen glass factories during the end of the 19th century. As the area&#x27;s gas supply became depleted, many of the factories closed or moved. The city is now known for its railroads, as approximately 100 trains pass through the city each day. As a result, the city is often visited by railfans, hosted by a railroad viewing park.

==History==
Fostoria was created in 1854 with the merger of the communities of Rome and Risdon. The combination of both communities&#x27; Methodist churches, on land donated by Charles W. Foster, led to the merger. To show their appreciation for Mr. Foster&#x27;s generosity, the new community was named Fostoria. Charles W. Foster&#x27;s son, Charles, became one of Fostoria&#x27;s most famous citizens—becoming the 35th governor of Ohio and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Benjamin Harrison.

Fostoria is known for its glass heritage and railroads: two CSX main lines and one NS main line intersect in downtown Fostoria, an area called the &quot;Iron Triangle.&quot; A natural gas boom in the 1880s, the railroad lines, and recruiting efforts by the community caused Fostoria to become home for numerous glass factories, including the Mambourg Glass Company (the city&#x27;s first glass factory), the Fostoria Glass Company, the Seneca Glass Company, the Novelty Glass Company, and others.

Although the boom in gas and glass is long over, railroads continue to be important to the community. More than 100 trains pass through Fostoria each day. The Fostoria Railroad Preservation Society, aided by a $815,760 grant from the Ohio Department of Transportation, completed a train viewing park in 2013 to help capitalize on the thousands of railfans who visit yearly.

<text>Frederick III (; 18 March 1609 – 9 February 1670) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1648 until his death in 1670. He also governed under the name Frederick II as diocesan administrator (colloquially referred to as prince-bishop) of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1623–29 and again 1634–44), and the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635–45).

The second-eldest son of Christian IV and Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, Frederick was only considered an heir to the throne after the death of his older brother Prince Christian in 1647. He instituted absolute monarchy in Denmark-Norway in 1660, confirmed by law in 1665 as the first in Western historiography. He also ordered the creation of the Throne Chair of Denmark.

After failed and costly aggressive wars under Christian IV, most Danes did not want to go to war again. According to Cathal Nolan, when Frederick III became king in 1648, he was excluded from the talks leading to the Peace of Westphalia and had to watch as Bremen was lost to rivaling Sweden, also freed from paying Oresund Tolls. In order to be elected king after the death of his father, Frederick III conceded significant influence to the nobility. As king, he fought losing wars against Sweden. He was defeated in the Dano-Swedish War of 1657–1658, and in the Dano-Swedish War of 1658–1660. However, when it seemed like king Charles X Gustav of Sweden was about to suffer a catastrophic defeat in the Second Northern War, Frederick III declared war on Sweden. Unexpectedly, Charles X Gustav crossed the frozen Belts to Zealand and appeared with 5,000 men near Copenhagen. Frederick III was unprepared and forced to sign the Treaty of Roskilde. 

Frederick disbanded the elective monarchy in favour of absolute monarchy, which lasted until 1814 in Norway and 1848 in Denmark. He married Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, with whom he fathered Christian V of Denmark.

== Early years ==
Frederick was born at Haderslev in Slesvig, the son of Christian IV and Anne Catherine of Brandenburg. In his youth and early manhood, there was no prospect of his ascending the Danish-Norwegian throne, as his older brother Christian was elected heir apparent of Denmark in 1608, and was proclaimed as heir apparent of Norway in 1610.

During his early childhood, he was raised under the supervision of Beate Huitfeldt. Frederick was educated at Sorø Academy and studied in the Netherlands and France. As a young man, he demonstrated an interest in theology, natural sciences, and Scandinavian history. He was a reserved and enigmatic prince who seldom laughed, spoke little, and wrote less, a striking contrast to Christian IV. Even though he lacked the impulsive and jovial qualities of his father, Frederick possessed the compensating virtues of moderation and self-control. On 1 October 1643 Frederick wed Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the daughter of George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, who had an energetic, passionate, and ambitious character. He was an enthusiastic collector of books and his collection became the foundation for the Copenhagen Royal Library.

=== Early offices ===
In his youth, Frederick became the instrument of his father&#x27;s political schemes in the Holy Roman Empire. He was granted administration of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635–45), the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1623–29 and again 1634–44), and named coadjutor of the Bishopric of Halberstadt. Thus, from an early age, he had considerable experience as an administrator. At the age of eighteen, he was the chief commandant of the Bremian fortress of Stade. During the Torstenson War of 1643–45, Frederick lost control of his possessions within the empire. He was then appointed commander in the royal shares in the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein by his father. His command was not successful, chiefly owing to his quarrels with the Earl-Marshal Anders Bille, who commanded the Danish forces. This was Frederick&#x27;s first collision with the Danish nobility, who afterwards regarded him with extreme distrust.

== Reign ==
=== Proclaimed king ===
The death of his elder brother Christian in June 1647 opened the possibility for Frederick to be elected heir apparent to the Danish-Norwegian throne. However, this issue was still unsettled when Christian IV died on 28 February 1648. After long deliberation among the Danish Estates and in (royal council), he was finally accepted as his father&#x27;s successor. On 6 July, Frederick received the homage of his subjects, and he was crowned on 23 November. However, due to misgivings about the rule of Christian IV, as well as Frederick&#x27;s previous confrontational administrations in Bremen and Verden and his quarrels with Anders Bille, he was only elected after he had signed a charter. The included provisions curtailing the already diminished royal prerogative in favour of increased influence for the .

In the first years of his reign, was the main power center of Danish politics. However, Frederick wielded more effective power than what the officially granted. He eventually succeeded in removing the two most influential members of from office in 1651: his brothers-in-law Corfitz Ulfeldt and Hannibal Sehested. Ulfeldt went into exile in Sweden where he turned traitor, while Sehested was restored to favour in 1660.

=== Defeated by Sweden ===
With all his good qualities, Frederick was not a man to recognize fully his own limitations and that of his country. But he rightly regarded the accession of Charles X of Sweden on 6 June 1654 as a source of danger to Denmark-Norway. He felt that temperament and policy would combine to make Charles an aggressive warrior-king: the only uncertainty was in which direction he would turn his arms first. Charles&#x27;s invasion of Poland in July 1655 came as a distinct relief to Frederick, even though the Polish War was full of latent peril to Denmark. Frederick was resolved upon a rupture with Sweden at the first convenient opportunity. When &quot;Rigsdagen&quot; assembled on 23 February 1657, it willingly granted considerable subsidies for mobilization and other military expenses. On 23 April he received the assent of the majority of &quot;Rigsraadet&quot; to attack Sweden&#x27;s German dominions. In the beginning of May, the still pending negotiations with that power were broken off, and on 1 June Frederick signed the manifesto justifying a war, which was never formally declared.

The Swedish king confounded all the plans of his enemies with the March across the Belts in January and February 1658. The effect of this unheard-of achievement of crossing the frozen sea to invade Danish territory was crushing. Frederick at once sued for peace. Yielding to the persuasions of the English and French ministers, Charles finally agreed to be content with mutilating, instead of annihilating, the Danish monarchy. The Treaty of Taastrup was signed on 18 February and the Treaty of Roskilde on 26 February 1658. The conclusion of peace was followed by a remarkable episode. Frederick expressed the desire to make the personal acquaintance of his conqueror and Charles X consented to be his guest for three days, 3 to 5 March, at Frederiksborg Palace. Splendid banquets lasting far into the night and intimate conversations between princes who had only just emerged from a mortal struggle seemed to point to nothing but peace and friendship in the future.

=== Assault on Copenhagen repelled ===
Charles&#x27;s suspicion of Denmark-Norway led him to a further assault on his neighbor. Terror was the first feeling produced at Copenhagen by the landing of the main Swedish army at Korsør on Zealand on 17 July 1658. None had anticipated the possibility of such a sudden and brutal attack, and everyone knew that the Danish capital was very inadequately fortified and garrisoned.

During this war, Frederick attained great popularity in the general public, as he rebuked the advice of his counsellors to flee Copenhagen with the memorable words &quot;I will die in my nest&quot; and actively led the defense of the city. On 8 August, representatives from all Estates in the capital urged the necessity of a vigorous resistance, and the citizens of Copenhagen, headed by the mayor Hans Nansen, protested their unshakable loyalty to the king and their determination to defend Copenhagen to the uttermost. The Danes had only three weeks of warning of the approaching danger, and the vast and dilapidated line of defence had at first only 2,000 regular defenders. But the government and the people displayed a memorable and exemplary energy under the constant supervision of the king and queen and mayor Nansen. By the beginning of September, all the breaches were repaired, the walls bristled with cannons, and 7,000 men were under arms.

So strong was the city by this time that Charles X, abandoning his original intention of carrying the place by assault, began a regular siege. This he also was forced to abandon when an auxiliary Dutch fleet reinforced and reprovisioned the garrison and defeated him on 29 October in the Battle of the Sound. The Dutch then assisted in the liberation of the Danish Isles in 1659. Thus, the Danish capital had saved the Danish monarchy. The war was ended by the Treaty of Copenhagen in May 1660, which confirmed the cession of Scania, Halland, and Blekinge from the Treaty of Roskilde, while Bornholm and parts of Schleswig reverted to Denmark.

=== Absolute monarchy ===

Frederick III profited by his spirited defense of the common interests of the country and the dynasty. The traditional loyalty of the Danish middle classes was transformed into enthusiasm for the king personally, and for a brief period Frederick found himself the most popular man in his kingdom. He made use of his popularity by converting the elective monarchy into an absolute monarchy by the Revolution of 1660. To ensure this conversion he instituted the 1660 state of emergency in Denmark. At the September 1660 gathering of the Estates, intended to solve the financial problems faced after the wars, Frederick played the different Estates against each other. He succeeded in gaining support for the hereditary monarchy, the annulment of the &quot;Haandfæstning&quot;, and the institution of absolute monarchical rule by decree.

During the last ten years of his reign, the king again took a relative obscure position while the new monarchy was built up and the country&#x27;s people tried to recover after the wars. New men came into government, which was marked by a rivalry between the ministers and councillors like Hannibal Sehested and the king&#x27;s favourite Kristoffer Gabel. During the early and mid 1660s there was an influential circle around Sehested, Frederik Ahlefeldt, Peter Bülche, Hans Svane, Jacob Petersen and Theodor Lente, who became increasingly opposed to Gabel. Frederick concentrated on changing the administrative structure from chancellery to resort colleges and replaced the administrative divisions of fiefs with &quot;amt&quot; counties. In 1665, the Kongeloven (&quot;Lex Regia&quot;) was introduced: the “constitution” of Danish-Norwegian absolute monarchy, and the first assertion of divine right underpinned by a written constitution in Europe. It decreed that the Monarch &quot;shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone.&quot; This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm.

In 1665, Frederick had an opportunity to repay the Netherlands for their support, by protecting the Return Fleet from the Dutch East Indies from the English navy. The English had blocked the English Channel, forcing the Return Fleet to sail all around the British Isles. The Dutch took refuge in Bergen, Norway, pursued by English warships. There they were protected by the fortress at the harbor, whose commander treated them as Danish allies. The English urged Frederick to seize the Return Fleet for himself, claiming that it was more valuable than the whole of his kingdom. Instead of protecting the Dutch, Frederick agreed to collaborate with the English in seizing the Return Fleet. But before the Danish-Norwegian fleet or word of the deal reached Bergen, the English attacked, and were defeated in the Battle of Vågen by the Dutch, supported by the fortress.

Frederick III died at Copenhagen Castle and is interred in Roskilde Cathedral.

== Marriage and issue ==
Frederick married Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg in Castle Glücksburg on 1 October 1643. The marriage had been arranged in 1640. Frederick was, at the time, archbishop of Bremen and not heir to the throne, and was not expected to succeed to the throne. The couple had eight children:

Also, he had with Margarethe Pape one illegitimate son, Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve.

<text>The Battle of Copenhagen of 1801 (Danish: &quot;Slaget på Reden&quot;, meaning &quot;the battle of the roadstead [of Copenhagen Harbour]&quot;), also known as the First Battle of Copenhagen to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Copenhagen in 1807, was a naval battle in which a British fleet fought and defeated a smaller force of the Dano-Norwegian Navy anchored near Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The battle came about over British fears that the powerful Danish fleet would ally with France, and a breakdown in diplomatic communications on both sides.

As the British ships entered the harbour of the Danish Navy, several of its ships took up station at the harbour&#x27;s roadstead, forming a blockade. The Danish fleet defended the capital with these ships and bastions on both sides of the harbour inlet. It was the second attempt by the British to try to prevent a Franco-Danish alliance, as the British had already entered Øresund with a fleet in August 1800, in order to persuade Denmark not to ally with France. The Danes agreed to the British terms upon hearing news of the assassination of Emperor Paul I of Russia, as his death meant the end of the Russian-led League of Armed Neutrality of which Denmark was a member.

==Background==
The battle was the result of multiple failures of diplomacy in the latter half of the 18th century. At the beginning of 1801, during the French Revolutionary Wars, Britain&#x27;s principal advantage over France was its naval superiority. The Royal Navy searched neutral ships trading with French ports, seizing their cargoes if they were deemed to be trading with France. It was in the British interest to guarantee its naval supremacy and all trade advantages that resulted from it. The Russian tsar, Paul, having been a British ally, arranged a League of Armed Neutrality comprising Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, and Russia, to enforce free trade with France. The British viewed the League to be very much in the French interest and a serious threat. The league was hostile to the British blockade and, according to the British, its existence threatened the supply of timber and naval stores from Scandinavia.

In early 1801, the British government assembled a fleet off Great Yarmouth at Yarmouth Roads, with the goal of breaking up the league. The British needed to act before the Baltic Sea thawed and released the Russian fleet from its bases at Kronstadt and Reval (now Tallinn). If the Russian fleet joined with the Swedish and Danish fleets, the combined fleets would form a formidable force of up to 123 ships-of-the-line. The British fleet was under the command of Admiral Hyde Parker, with Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson as second-in-command.

Frustrated by the delay, Nelson sent a letter to Captain Thomas Troubridge, a friend and a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty. This prompted the Earl of St Vincent (First Lord of the Admiralty) to send a private note, which resulted in the fleet sailing from Yarmouth on 12 March. Orders were sent to Parker to go to Copenhagen and detach Denmark from the league by &quot;amicable arrangement or by actual hostilities&quot;, to be followed by &quot;an immediate and vigorous attack&quot; on the Russians at Reval and then Kronstadt. The British fleet reached the Skaw (Danish: &quot;Skagen&quot;) on 19 March, where they met a British diplomat, Nicholas Vansittart, who told them that the Danes had rejected an ultimatum.
Although the Admiralty had instructed Parker to frustrate the league, by force if necessary, he was a naturally cautious person and moved slowly. He wanted to blockade the Baltic despite the danger of the combination of fleets; Nelson wanted to ignore Denmark and Sweden, who were both reluctant partners in the alliance, and instead sail to the Baltic to fight the Russians. In the end Nelson was able to persuade Sir Hyde to attack the Danish fleet currently concentrated off Copenhagen. Promised naval support for the Danes from Karlskrona, in Sweden, did not arrive, perhaps because of adverse winds. The Prussians had only minimal naval forces and also could not assist. On 30 March, the British force passed through the narrows between Denmark and Sweden, sailing close to the Swedish coast to put themselves as far from the Danish guns as possible; fortunately for the British, the Swedish batteries remained silent.

Attacking the Danish fleet would have been difficult as Parker&#x27;s delay in sailing had allowed the Danes to prepare their positions well. Most of the Danish ships were not fitted for sea but were moored along the shore with old ships (hulks), no longer fit for service at sea, but still powerfully armed, as a line of floating batteries off the eastern coast of the island of Amager, in front of the city in the King&#x27;s Channel. The northern end of the line terminated at the Tre Kroner forts (&#x27;Three Crowns&#x27; — Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, referring to the Kalmar Union, Three Crowns is also the Swedish coat of arms) armed with 68 guns (equal to twice the broadside of a typical ship-of-the-line). North of the fort, in the entrance to Copenhagen harbour, were two ships-of-the-line, a large frigate, and two brigs, all rigged for sea, and two more hulks. Batteries covered the water between the Danish line and the shore, and further out to sea a large shoal, the Middle Ground, constricted the channel. The British had no reliable charts or pilots, so Captain Thomas Hardy spent most of the night of 31 March taking soundings in the channel up to the Danish line. Even so, the British ships were not able to locate the deepest part of the channel properly and so kept too far to seaward.

==Battle==
===Preparations===
Parker gave Nelson the twelve ships-of-the-line with the shallowest drafts, and all the smaller ships in the fleet. Parker himself stayed to the north-east of the battle with the heavier ships – whose deeper drafts did not allow them to safely enter the channel – screening Nelson from possible external interference and moving towards Copenhagen to engage the northern defences. Nelson transferred his command from the large 98-gun to the shallower-draft 74-gun for this reason.

On 30 March, Nelson, and his second-in-command, Rear Admiral Thomas Graves, accompanied by Captain Domett and the commanding officer of the troops, Lieutenant Colonel William Stewart, sailed in the hired lugger &quot;Lark&quot; to reconnoitre the Danish defences at Copenhagen. They found the defences to be strong and so spent the evening discussing the plan. Fixed batteries had a significant advantage over ship borne cannon owing to their greater stability and larger guns, and the Danes could reinforce their ships during the battle. On the other hand, their ships were a motley collection, many of them small, and out-gunned if engaged by the whole of Nelson&#x27;s force.
Nelson&#x27;s plan was for the British ships to approach the weaker, southern end of the Danish defences in a line parallel to the Danish one. As the foremost ship drew alongside a Danish ship, it would anchor and engage that ship. The remainder of the line would pass outside the engagement until the next British ship drew alongside the next Danish ship, and so on. The frigate , together with small gun-brigs, would rake the Danish line from the south, and a force of frigates, commanded by Captain Edward Riou of , would attack the northern end of the line. Troops would land and assault the &quot;Tre Kroner&quot; fortress once the fleet had subdued the Danish line of ships. Bomb vessels would sit outside the British line and bombard the Danes by firing over it. Should the British be unable to subdue the stronger, northern defences, the destruction of the southern ships would be enough to allow the bomb vessels to approach within range of the city and force negotiations to prevent the bombardment of the city.

===Action===

With a southerly wind on 2 April, Nelson picked his way through the shoals. However, ran aground before entering the channel, and took no part in the battle. Then and ran aground on the Middle Ground, severely restricting their role in the battle. The loss of the three vessels required hurried changes in the line and weakened the force&#x27;s northern end.
The Danish batteries started firing at 10:05 am, the first half of the British fleet was engaged in about half an hour, and the battle was general by 11:30 am. Once the British line was in place there was very little manoeuvring. The British ships anchored by the stern about a cable from the line of Danish ships and batteries, which was relatively long range, and the two exchanged broadsides until a ship ceased firing. The British encountered heavy resistance, partly because they had not spotted the low-lying floating batteries, and partly because of the courage with which the Danes fought. The northern Danish ships, which were rigged and manned, did not enter the battle but remained on station as reserve units, even though the wind direction forced Parker&#x27;s squadron to approach only slowly.
At 1:00 pm, the battle was still in full swing. &quot;Prøvesteenen&quot;″s heavier fire would have destroyed if it had not been raked by &quot;Desirée&quot;, assisted by . suffered badly from the combined fires of &quot;Holsteen&quot; and &quot;Sjælland&quot;.

===Signal to retreat===
Admiral Parker could see little of the battle owing to gun smoke, but could see the signals on the three grounded British ships, with &quot;Bellona&quot; and &quot;Russell&quot; flying signals of distress and &quot;Agamemnon&quot; a signal of inability to proceed. Thinking that Nelson might have fought to a stand-still but might be unable to retreat without orders (the Articles of War demanded that all ranks &quot;do their utmost&quot; against the enemy in battle), at 1:30 pm Parker told his flag captain:I will make the signal of recall for Nelson&#x27;s sake. If he is in condition to continue the action, he will disregard it; if he is not, it will be an excuse for his retreat and no blame can be imputed to him.Nelson ordered that the signal be acknowledged, but not repeated. He turned to his flag captain, Thomas Foley, and said &quot;You know, Foley, I only have one eye — I have the right to be blind sometimes,&quot; and then, holding his telescope to his blind eye, said &quot;I really do not see the signal!&quot; Rear Admiral Graves repeated the signal, but in a place invisible to most other ships while keeping Nelson&#x27;s &quot;close action&quot; signal at his masthead. Of Nelson&#x27;s captains, only Riou, who could not see Nelson&#x27;s flagship &quot;Elephant&quot;, followed Parker&#x27;s signal. Riou withdrew his force, which was then attacking the &quot;Tre Kroner&quot; fortress, exposing himself to heavy fire, which resulted in his death and the deaths of several crew members onboard &quot;Amazon&quot;.

===End of the battle===

It was at this time that the battle swung decisively to the British, as their superior gunnery took effect. The guns of the dozen southernmost Danish ships had started to fall silent owing to the damage they had sustained, and the fighting moved northward. According to British eyewitness accounts, much of the Danish line had fallen silent by 2:00 pm. The cessation of firing left the way open for the British bomb vessels to approach Copenhagen. In addition, the reinforcements of the ships from the shore batteries were causing the latter to become ineffective.

&quot;Nyborg&quot; tried to leave the line with &quot;Aggershuus&quot; in tow, but both sank. The most northerly ship, the frigate &quot;Hjælperen&quot;, successfully withdrew. The Danish commander, Commodore Olfert Fischer, moved from &quot;Dannebrog&quot; at 11:30 am, when it caught fire, to &quot;Holsteen&quot;. When &quot;Indfødsretten&quot;, immediately north of &quot;Holsteen&quot;, struck its colours at about 2:30 pm, he moved on to the &quot;Tre Kroner&quot; fortress. There he engaged three of Parker&#x27;s ships, which had lost their manoeuvrability after being badly damaged and had drifted within range. &quot;Indfødsretten&quot; resumed firing after Captain Schrodersee was ferried to it and took command of the ship.

Perhaps because of inexperienced crews, several Danish ships fired on British boats sent out to them after their officers had signalled their surrender. Nelson said that he &quot;must either send on shore and stop this irregular proceeding, or send in our fire ships and burn them&quot; and went to his cabin to write a note to the Danes. He sent it with a Danish-speaking officer, Captain Sir Frederick Thesiger, under a flag of truce to the Danish-Norwegian regent, Crown Prince Frederik, who had been watching the battle from the ramparts of the Citadel. The note read:

All action ceased when Crown Prince Frederick sent his Adjutant General, Hans Lindholm (a Danish member of parliament), asking for the reason for Nelson&#x27;s letter. When he could not clearly communicate verbally, Lindholm was asked to put his message in written English, which he did, but being given a dull quill, he joked:
In reply, Nelson wrote a note:
which was sent back to the Crown Prince. He then referred Lindholm to Parker on . Following him there at 4:00 pm, a twenty-four-hour ceasefire was agreed.

==Aftermath==
After fighting had ended, the Danish flagship &quot;Dannebrog&quot; exploded at 4:30 pm, killing 250 men. By the end of the afternoon, three more badly-damaged British ships ran aground, including &quot;Elephant&quot;. The Danish-Norwegian ships had been partly manned by volunteers, many having little or no naval experience, and as they were not all listed after the battle, it is uncertain what the exact Danish-Norwegian losses were. Estimates vary between 1,135 and 2,215 captured, killed or wounded. The official report by Olfert Fischer estimated the Danish-Norwegian casualties to be between 1,600 and 1,800 captured, killed or wounded. According to the official returns recorded by each British ship, and repeated in dispatches from Nelson and forwarded by Parker to the Admiralty, British casualties were 963 killed and wounded.

Of the Danish ships engaged in the battle, two had sunk, one had exploded, and twelve had been captured. The British could not spare men for manning prizes as they suspected that further battles were to come. They burned eleven of the captured ships, and only one, &quot;Holsteen&quot;, was sailed to England with the wounded under surgeon William Fergusson. &quot;Holsteen&quot; was then taken into service with the Royal Navy and renamed (later ).

===Subsequent events===
The next day, Nelson landed in Copenhagen to open negotiations. Colonel Stewart reported that &quot;the population showed an admixture of admiration, curiosity and displeasure&quot;. In a two-hour meeting with the Crown Prince (who spoke English), Nelson was able to secure an indefinite armistice. He then tried to convince first Fischer (whom he had known in the West Indies), and then the Prince, of British protection against the Russians. Negotiations continued by letter and on 8 April Nelson returned in person with a formal agreement.

The one sticking point out of the seven articles was a sixteen-week armistice to allow action against the Russians. At this point Stewart claims that one of the Danes turned to another and said in French that disagreement might lead to a renewal of hostilities. &quot;Renew hostilities!&quot; responded Nelson, and turning to his interpreter said &quot;Tell him that we are ready in a moment; ready to bombard this very night!&quot; Hurried apologies followed (the British fleet now occupied positions that would allow the bombardment of Copenhagen) and agreement was reached and signed the next day. The armistice was reduced to fourteen weeks, but during it armed neutrality would be suspended and the British were to have free access to Copenhagen. Danish prisoners were also paroled. In the final hour of negotiations, the Danes found out (but not the British) that Tsar Paul had been assassinated. This resulted in the dissolution of the League of Armed Neutrality and allowed the Danes to accept British terms. The final peace agreement was then signed on 23 October 1801.

On 12 April, Parker sailed to Karlskrona and on the British approach, the Swedish fleet returned to the port where Parker attempted to persuade them to also leave the League. Parker refused to sail into the eastern Baltic and instead returned to Copenhagen, where he found that news of his lack of vigour had reached London. On 5 May, he was recalled and ordered to hand his command over to Nelson. Nelson sailed eastwards again and, leaving six ships-of-the-line at Karlskrona, he arrived at Reval on 14 May to find that the ice had melted and the Russian fleet had departed for Kronstadt. He also found out that negotiations for ending the armed neutrality had started and so withdrew on 17 May. As a result of the battle, Lord Nelson was created Viscount Nelson of the Nile.

This was not the end of the Danish-Norwegian conflict with the British. In 1807, similar circumstances led to another British attack, in the Second Battle of Copenhagen.

==Legacy==

The death of Tsar Paul of Russia changed the diplomatic scene and reduced the political importance of the battle, and material losses in the battle were of little importance to the fighting strength of either navy (the Danish side had taken great care to spare its first-class ships), it did however demonstrate that British determination to ensure continued naval superiority in the war against France was supreme.

<doc id="150916" wikidata="Q152756" url="?curid=150916" title="Frederick VIII of Denmark">
<text>Frederik VIII (; 3 June 1843 – 14 May 1912) was King of Denmark from 29 January 1906 until his death in 1912.

As the eldest son of King Christian IX, nicknamed the &quot;Father-in-law of Europe&quot;, Frederick was related to royalty throughout Europe. He was heir apparent to the Danish throne and served as crown prince for more than 42 years. During the long reign of his father, he was largely excluded from influence and political power. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1906, he acceded to the throne at the advanced age of 62. In many ways, Frederick VIII was a liberal monarch who was much more favorable to the new parliamentary system introduced in 1901 than his father had been, being reform-minded and democratically inclined. Due to his late accession to the throne, however, Frederick&#x27;s reign would last only six years, throughout which he was plagued by ill health.

Frederick VIII was married to Louise of Sweden, with whom he had eight children. Their eldest son succeeded his father as Christian X of Denmark, while their second son, Carl, ascended the Norwegian throne as Haakon VII in 1905.

==Early life==
Prince Frederick was born on 3 June 1843 in the Yellow Palace, an 18th-century town house at 18 Amaliegade, immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex, the principal residence of the Danish royal family in the district of Frederiksstaden in central Copenhagen. He was the eldest son and child of Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel-Rumpenheim. His father&#x27;s family was a cadet branch of the Danish royal House of Oldenburg, which was descended from Christian III and which had ruled as non-sovereign dukes in Schleswig-Holstein for eight generations. He was baptised on 22 June with the names &quot;Christian Frederik Vilhelm Carl&quot;, and was known as Prince Frederick. To the family he was known as &quot;Fredy&quot; throughout his life.
He had five younger siblings: Alexandra (1844–1925), William (1845–1913), Dagmar (1847–1928), Thyra (1853–1933) and Valdemar (1858–1939). Although they were of royal blood, the family lived a comparatively normal life. They did not possess great wealth; their father&#x27;s income from an army commission was about £800 per year and their house was a rent-free grace and favour property. Occasionally, Hans Christian Andersen was invited to call and tell the children stories before bedtime.

In 1853, it was clear that the main line of the Oldenburg dynasty would become extinct with King Frederick VII, who was elderly and childless. Frederick&#x27;s mother was very close to the succession, as she was a niece of the previous Oldenburg king, Christian VIII, through his sister. With the other heirs from the House of Hesse-Kassel having renounced their claims to the Danish throne in favour of Louise, who in turn relinquished her own claim, his father was eventually chosen as the heir presumptive. Accordingly, Frederick was created a Prince of Denmark.
On 19 October 1860, he was confirmed together with his sister Princess Alexandra in the chapel of Christiansborg Palace. After his confirmation, Prince Frederick was given an extensive military education, pursuing a career in the Royal Danish Navy alongside his brother Valdemar. In 1863, Frederick was sent to study political science at the University of Oxford, but returned to Denmark upon his father becoming king in November that year. As heir apparent to the throne, he was given a seat in the State Council and subsequently assisted his father in the duties of government. In 1864, he formally took part in the Second Schleswig War against Prussia and Austria.

The crown prince was a member of the Danish Order of Freemasons, serving as its Grand Master from 1871 until his death.

==Marriage==

Queen Louise wanted her eldest son to marry as well as had her two daughters, Alexandra and Dagmar. Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom had two yet unmarried daughters, Princess Helena and Princess Louise, and Queen Louise planned to have Frederick marry one of them. During his stay in England, Crown Prince Frederik actually took an interest in Princess Helena, and although his feelings were reciprocated, the connection did not materialize, as Queen Victoria opposed it. Victoria did not want her daughters to marry heirs to foreign thrones, as this would force them to live abroad, instead preferring German princes who could establish homes in England. In addition, Victoria had always been pro-German and another Danish alliance (Frederick&#x27;s sister, Alexandra, had married Victoria&#x27;s eldest son Edward, Prince of Wales), would not have been in line with her German interests.

After this failed marriage attempt, attention turned instead to Princess Louise of Sweden and Norway, the only daughter of King Charles XV of Sweden and Norway. Princess Louise belonged to the Bernadotte dynasty, which had ruled in Sweden since 1818, when the founder, Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, one of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s generals, was elected crown prince of Sweden in 1810 and later succeeded the throne as King Charles XIV John in 1818. He married Désirée Clary, who had once been engaged to the French Emperor. Charles XIV&#x27;s son, Oscar I, had married Josephine of Leuchtenberg, the granddaughter of Napoleon&#x27;s first wife, the Empress Josephine. King Oscar I and Queen Josephine were Princess Louise&#x27;s paternal grandparents.

The marriage was suggested as a way of creating friendship between Denmark and Sweden. Relations between the two countries had been tense after Sweden had not assisted Denmark during the war with Prussia in 1864. Frederick and Louise had met for the first time in 1862, but in 1868, Frederick was invited to Sweden to get to know Louise, and their meeting was described as a success. In July that same year, Crown Prince Frederick—then 25 years old—became engaged to the 17-year-old Princess Louise. A year later, they were married in the chapel at the Royal Palace in Stockholm on 28 July 1869. Louise was the first Swedish princess to be married into the Danish royal house since the Middle Ages, and the marriage was welcomed in all three Scandinavian countries as a symbol of the new Scandinavism.
On 10 August 1869, the newlyweds made their entrance into Copenhagen, where they received a warm welcome. As their residence, the couple was awarded Frederik VIII&#x27;s Palace, an 18th century palace which forms part of the Amalienborg Palace complex in central Copenhagen. As their country residence they received Charlottenlund Palace, located on the shores of the Øresund Strait 10 kilometers north of Copenhagen. Here they had a refuge far away from court life at Amalienborg and here several of their children were born. Frederick and Louise had four sons and four daughters born between 1870 and 1890: Prince Christian, Prince Carl, Princess Louise, Prince Harald, Princess Ingeborg, Princess Thyra, Prince Gustav and Princess Dagmar. Their eldest sons, Christian and Carl, would become kings of Denmark and Norway respectively. Due to the many children, Charlottenlund Palace was rebuilt to accommodate the large family, and in 1880–81, the palace was expanded with a dome and two side wings.

==Heir apparent to the throne==
Frederick was crown prince for 43 years and used the time to prepare carefully for his reign. Even though he, as heir apparent to the throne, had a seat in the Council of State, his father made sure to largely exclude him from influence and political power.

==Reign==

On 29 January 1906, King Christian IX died peacefully at the age of 87, after a reign of 43 years. Upon his father&#x27;s death, Frederick succeeded to the throne at the age of 62. He was proclaimed king from the balcony of Christian VII&#x27;s Palace at Amalienborg by the Prime Minister Jens Christian Christensen as Frederick VIII.

Due to his late accession to the throne, Frederick&#x27;s reign would last only six years, throughout which he was plagued by ill health. In many ways, Frederick VIII was a liberal monarch who was much more favorable to the new parliamentarian system than his father had been, being reform-minded and democratically inclined.

==Death==
On 14 May 1912, while on his return journey from a trip to Nice with his wife and four of his children, the king made a short stop in Hamburg, staying at the Hotel Hamburger Hof under the pseudonym &quot;Count Kronberg&quot;. That evening, Frederick—while incognito—went out for a stroll on the Jungfernstieg, during which he became faint and collapsed on a park bench at Gänsemarkt. He was discovered by a police officer who took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead; his cause of death was announced as a heart attack. As Frederick was incognito at the time and had no papers on him, his body was brought to the local morgue, where he was identified by the hotel manager the next morning.

Rumors soon began to circulate about a possible scandal involving the king, as the place where he collapsed and died at was near a well-known brothel. The local police did not disclose details about the investigation, for fear of causing distress to the royal family.

Frederick&#x27;s body was transported via a special train to Travemünde, after which he was brought back to Denmark by the royal yacht &quot;Dannebrog&quot;. After lying in state at the chapel of Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, he was interred in &quot;Christian IX&#x27;s Chapel&quot; in Roskilde Cathedral on the island of Zealand, the traditional burial site for Danish monarchs since the 15th century.

==Descendants==
The reigning families of Denmark, Norway, Belgium and Luxembourg are descended from King Frederick VIII; Denmark&#x27;s through his eldest son Christian X, and Norway&#x27;s through his second son, Haakon VII as well as through his daughter, Princess Ingeborg of Denmark. The royal family of Belgium and grand ducal family of Luxembourg are both also descended from Princess Ingeborg of Denmark.

== Titles, styles, honours, and arms ==

During his reign, the King&#x27;s full style was: &quot;His Majesty Frederick VIII, By the Grace of God, King of Denmark, of the Wends and of the Goths, Duke of Schleswig, Holstein, Stormarn, Dithmarschen, Lauenburg and Oldenburg.&quot;

<text>Plymouth is a village in Huron and Richland counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 1,707 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Plymouth was laid out in 1825. The village was named after Plymouth Rock. Plymouth was incorporated in 1834.

Plymouth was formerly the headquarters of the Plymouth Locomotive Works, a builder of industrial railroad locomotives. The factory closed in 1999. The company designed and built an automobile named Plymouth in the early part of the century, but it was not mass-produced, but there were trucks and tractors produced by Commercial Motor Truck Company under the Plymouth name in the same period. Later, Chrysler Motors developed the Plymouth Automobile Division, but thought the Ohio company had infringed on their name. A court battle ensued over the ownership of the name Plymouth, which Chrysler lost when it was determined the original Plymouth car preceded Chrysler&#x27;s by several years.

<doc id="150920" wikidata="Q2674175" url="?curid=150920" title="Utica, Ohio">
<text>Utica is a village in Knox and Licking counties in the U.S. state of Ohio, along the North Fork of the Licking River. The population was 2,064 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Utica was platted in 1815. The village was named after Utica, New York.

Utica was the largest hand blown window glass factory city in the US at the turn of the 20th century due to natural occurring silica and natural gas. The glass would be gathered in a molten ball and blown into a long tube. The ends would be cut off, the tube re-heated, cut, and laid flat creating the window glass. The glass companies closed with the 1929 crash and development of new glass.

<doc id="150921" wikidata="Q16845705" url="?curid=150921" title="Hunters' Lodges">
<text>The Hunters&#x27; Lodge was the last of a series of secret organizations formed in 1838 in the United States during the Rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada. The organization arose in Vermont among Lower Canadian refugees (the eastern division or Frères chasseurs) and spread westward under the influence of Dr Charles Duncombe and Donald McLeod, leaders of the short lived Canadian Refugee Relief Association, and Scottish-born former Mayor of Toronto William Lyon Mackenzie, drawing in support from many different areas in North America and Europe. They also absorbed Henry S. Handy&#x27;s &#x27;Secret Order of the Sons of Liberty&#x27; in Detroit into a Grand Lodge in Cleveland.

== Lodge organization ==
The Hunters Lodges were modelled on masonic lodges, and adopted similar secret signs, hierarchical orders, and rituals. The four degrees of the Lodge were: Snowshoe, Beaver, Grand Hunter and Patriot Hunter. Soldiers without rank were of the first degree, commissioned officers of the second, field officers of the third, and the highest ranking commissioned officers of the fourth degree.

They also utilized a secret code, sometimes printed in newspapers like the &quot;Buffalonian&quot;, to communicate orders.

Lodges existed across Vermont, western New York, Ohio and Michigan with particularly active sites being Watertown, Oswego, Salina (now Syracuse), Rochester, Buffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit.

== Convention and the Republic of Canada ==
In September 1838, 70 delegates from the western Hunters&#x27; Lodges attended a secret, week-long &quot;Patriot Congress&quot; in Cleveland, Ohio. They appointed a provisional Canadian republican government, electing:

# President A.D. Smith, &quot;chief justice of the peace at Cleveland&quot; 
# Vice-President Colonel Nathan Williams, &quot;a wholesale grocer&quot; in Cleveland
# Secretary of the Treasury Judge John Grant Jr, Oswego
# Secretary of War Donald McLeod
# Commander-in-chief of the &quot;Patriot Army of the West,&quot; Lucius V. Bierce, &quot;an attorney at Akron,&quot; mayor of Akron, Ohio.
# Commissary General, a man named Brunson, of Buffalo 
# Commodore of the Patriot Navy on Lake Erie, Gilman Appleby, former Captain of the &quot;Caroline&quot;
# Commodore of the Patriot Navy on Lake Ontario, Bill Johnston

To fund the war, they formed a joint stock bank, the Republican Bank of Canada, with Secretary of the Treasury John Grant, Jr. as President. They printed bills with pictures of Rebellion martyrs Samuel Lount and James Morreau on them. The official newspaper of the organization was the &quot;Bald Eagle&quot; published in Cleveland by Samuel Underhill.

== Politics ==
The leadership of the Patriot movement appears to have belonged to the small Equal Rights Party (known more popularly as the Locofocos). The small party emerged in 1836 in New York with a platform emphasizing radical republicanism, an end to the &quot;moneyed aristocracy&quot;, and &quot;Free Banking&quot;. The Republican Bank of Canada was formed on this basis. Dr Charles Duncombe was the author of &quot;Duncombe’s free banking: an essay on banking, currency, finance, exchanges, and political economy&quot; (Cleveland, Ohio, 1841); and &quot;Memorial to Congress upon the subject of Republican free banking&quot; (Cleveland, Ohio, 1841).

<doc id="150923" wikidata="Q1816799" url="?curid=150923" title="Plain City, Ohio">
<text>Plain City is a village in Madison and Union counties in the U.S. state of Ohio, along Big Darby Creek. The population was 4,065 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Until about 1800, the Ohio Country was inhabited by Mingo and Wyandot Indians, and there was an Indian village just north of present-day Plain City. After 1795, as white settlers began moving into the region, the area around present-day Plain City was referred to as Pleasant Valley. This name remained in use into the 20th century, appearing in the &quot;Ohio Guide&quot; of the late Depression era.

In 1814, Isaac Bigelow travelled to the area from Centre County, Pennsylvania, to pay for land purchased from his uncle, then returned to Pennsylvania to study medicine with his father. He returned in 1817, and settled in the Pleasant Valley area in 1818. He hired a surveyor named David Chapman, and laid out the town of Westminster on June 11, 1818. At the time, Westminster lay wholly within Darby Township in Madison County. In 1820, when Union County was formed, the county line was moved to the middle of Westminster. In 1823, the previous survey was resurveyed, additional territory was incorporated, and the town&#x27;s name was changed from Westminster to Pleasant Valley. From 1832 to 1851, there were six additions to the town limits. In 1851, due to there already being another town in Ohio named Pleasant Valley, the town changed its name to Plain City.

Previous to 1850, Plain City was a smaller trading point than Amity, but after a trunk-line for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad was laid through its corporation limits, business and manufacturing increased dramatically. The corporation limits were extended in 1868. As of 1875, the town contained five churches, one newspaper, one bank, one brick planing mill, one flour mill, four dry goods stores, three drug stores, three grocery stores, one jewelry store, one hotel, one carriage and wagon store, two harness shops, two wagon shops, two blacksmith shops, and a boot and shoe store.

The Farmers National Bank, a building at the intersection of State Route 161 and Chillicothe Street, was built in 1902, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The town clock, located at the same intersection, was dedicated on November 15, 1902.

An Amish settlement at Plain City that was founded in 1896 dissolved in 2011.

The village has grown in recent years with the addition of new housing developments. Darby Fields on the south side of the village broke ground in 2017. Darby Station on the east side of the village broke ground in 2022.

In 2024, Plain City was designated a Tree City USA.

<text>Alliance is a city in eastern Stark County, Ohio, United States. The population was 21,672 as of the 2020 census. It was established in 1854 by the merger of three smaller communities and was a manufacturing and railroad hub for much of the 20th century. It is associated with the state flower of Ohio, the scarlet carnation, and is known as the &quot;Carnation City&quot;. The University of Mount Union, a private liberal arts college established in 1846, is located in Alliance. Partially extending into Mahoning County, the city is part of the Canton–Massillon metropolitan area.

==History==

Alliance was founded in 1854 by the merger of three smaller communities called Williamsport, formed in 1827, Freedom, formed in 1838, and Liberty, formed in 1850 to act as a station and support hub for the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. A fourth community, Mount Union, was added in 1888. Alliance was incorporated as a city in 1889.

There are two popular theories regarding the origin of the city&#x27;s name. One holds that it was chosen because of the &quot;alliance&quot; of three small settlements into a larger entity. The other theory says the name reflects the fact that two major railroad lines, the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad and the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad, intersected at Alliance, once known as &quot;The Crossing&quot;.

On April 12, 1856, Alliance was directly struck by a tornado, causing extensive damage. A roof of a church was removed, and another church was moved off its foundation. A train that stopped at the Alliance Station was pushed off its rails. The destruction was estimated to be $15,000 to $20,000 (in 1856 dollars, ). A few injuries and one fatality were confirmed.

In 1923, Alliance Rubber Company was founded in Alliance. It was a manufacturer of rubber bands cut from discarded rubber rings into small strips.

Alliance&#x27;s Main Street was originally laid out to bring traffic to the train station, the heart of the city&#x27;s transportation hub. The railroads were central to industry and personal transportation, bringing in raw materials for factories and sending out finished goods. Due to this, Alliance is sometimes referred to as &quot;the town where Main Street is a dead end&quot;.

Alliance became a qualified Tree City USA as recognized by the National Arbor Day Foundation in 1982.

==Arts and culture==

Alliance is a town rich with social, industrial and railroad history, with the restored Glamorgan Castle, previous home of the owner of Morgan Engineering; the Haines House, a restored underground railroad home; and the Mabel Hartzell historic home; all three properties are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The name of Levi L. Lamborn, the man who cultivated the scarlet carnation, Ohio&#x27;s state flower, can still be seen on the facade of a building in the old downtown district. The Richardsonian Romanesque stone house of the Devine family is currently being renovated. The historic downtown area is experiencing a gradual renaissance, with the opening of a Saturday Farmers&#x27; Market on Main Street near the historic Caboose, and the renovation of a storefront on Main Street as an art gallery and live performance space, joining a scattering of antique shops and other businesses.

The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association relocated to the former Midland-Buckeye bank, at 260 East Main Street, in June 2011, opening the CFA Foundation&#x27;s Feline Historical Museum, the first of its kind of the United States.

Alliance was also home to the World War History &amp; Art Museum, located in College Plaza at 1300 East State Street. WWHAM had a dozen exhibits including a world class collection of 320 original paintings and drawings by the troops of World War I, an HO scale model of the German 2nd Panzer Division in 1944, and original art by the pilots and airmen of World War II. It closed to the public on April 17, 2014, and now does traveling shows.

===The Carnation City===
Alliance is commonly referred to as the Carnation City, having been given that designation by the Ohio General Assembly in 1959. Alliance gave Ohio its official state flower, the scarlet carnation. Alliance&#x27;s association with the carnation began in 1866 when an Alliance doctor, Levi L. Lamborn, purchased six potted carnation plants to grow in a greenhouse at his house. At that time this flower was rarely cultivated in the United States. In 1876 Lamborn ran against William McKinley for the Congressional seat from this district. The two men were personal friends, although they were political opponents. McKinley had expressed his admiration for Lamborn&#x27;s carnations, so before each of their political debates Lamborn gave McKinley a carnation to wear on his lapel. Mr. McKinley won the election and associated the carnation with his success, and wore carnations during his successful campaigns for Governor of Ohio and then President of the United States.

In 1884, Lamborn suggested that Ohio should make the carnation a state emblem. In 1904, three years after President McKinley&#x27;s assassination, the Ohio General Assembly designated the scarlet carnation as the official state flower as a &quot;token of love and reverence to the memory of William McKinley&quot;. On January 29 of each year (President McKinley&#x27;s birth anniversary), a bouquet of red carnations is placed in the hands of McKinley&#x27;s statue at the Capitol in Columbus.

Since 1960, Alliance has held an annual Carnation Festival during August.

Eight council members are elected as a legislature for 2-year terms, comprising four separate wards, three at-large districts, and a council president.

<text>Mineral Ridge is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in southern Trumbull and northern Mahoning counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 3,951 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb in the Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area. Mineral Ridge was named for valuable coal deposits near the original town site.

==History==
The area of Mineral Ridge was primarily a farming community, with some coal mining in the 1830s. In the mid-1850s, John Lewis, superintendent of the Mineral Ridge Coal Mines, discovered black band iron ore beneath the layers of coal ore, leading to a boom of companies working with the blast furnaces of Brier Hill, Niles, and later, Mineral Ridge itself. The main deposit of iron for Youngstown’s growing steel industry, this iron was known as “American Scotch Pig” and “Warner’s Scotch Pig.”

By the late 19th century, the mining industry was largely in decline and Mineral Ridge disincorporated in 1917. However, some mines did still operate into the Great Depression.

<text>Youngstown is a city in and the county seat of Mahoning County, Ohio, United States. It had a population of 60,068 at the 2020 census, making it the eleventh-most populous city in Ohio. The Youngstown–Warren metropolitan area had 430,591 residents in 2020. Youngstown is situated on the Mahoning River in Northeast Ohio, southeast of Cleveland and northwest of Pittsburgh.

Youngstown is a midwestern city located at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The city was named for John Young, an early settler from Whitestown, New York, who established the community&#x27;s first sawmill and gristmill. It was an early industrial city of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and became known as a center of steel production. With the movement of jobs offshore as the steel industry in the United States fell into decline in the 1970s, the city became exemplary of the Rust Belt. Youngstown has seen declines in population of nearly 65 percent within its city limits and about 15 percent in the metro area since 1960.

Downtown Youngstown has seen various revitalization efforts in the 21st century, including the Covelli Centre and Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre. Other notable institutions in the city include the Butler Institute of American Art, Mill Creek Park, Stambaugh Auditorium, and Youngstown State University. Youngstown&#x27;s first new downtown hotel since 1974—the DoubleTree by Hilton—opened in 2018 in the historic Stambaugh Building, adapted for this use.

==History==

===Founding===
Youngstown was named for New York native John Young, who surveyed the area in 1796 and settled there soon afterward. On February 9, 1797, Young purchased the township of from the Western Reserve Land Company for $16,085. The 1797 establishment of Youngstown was officially recorded on August 19, 1802.

The area that includes present-day Youngstown was part of the Connecticut Western Reserve, a section of the Northwest Territory that Connecticut initially did not cede to the federal government. Upon cession, Connecticut retained the title to the land in the Western Reserve, which it sold to the Connecticut Land Company for $1,200,000. While many of the area&#x27;s early settlers came from Connecticut, Youngstown attracted many Scots-Irish settlers from neighboring Pennsylvania. The first European Americans to settle permanently in the area were Pittsburgh native James Hillman and wife Catherine Dougherty. By 1798, Youngstown was the home of several families who were concentrated near where Mill Creek meets the Mahoning River. Boardman Township was founded in 1798 by Elijah Boardman, a member of the Connecticut Land Company. Also founded in 1798 was Austintown by John McCollum who was a settler from New Jersey.

As the Western Reserve&#x27;s population grew, the need for administrative districts became apparent. In 1800, territorial governor Arthur St. Clair established Trumbull County (named in honor of Connecticut Governor Jonathan Trumbull), and designated the smaller settlement of Warren as its administrative center, or county seat. In 1813, Trumbull County was divided into townships, with Youngstown Township comprising much of what became Mahoning County. The village of Youngstown was incorporated in 1848, and in 1867 Youngstown was chartered as a city. It became the county seat in 1876, when the administrative center of Mahoning County was moved from neighboring Canfield. Youngstown has been Mahoning County&#x27;s county seat to this day.

===Growth and industrialization===
The discovery of coal by the community in the early 19th century paved the way for the Youngstown area&#x27;s inclusion on the network of the famed Erie Canal. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal Company was organized in 1835, and the canal was completed in 1840. Local industrialist David Tod, who became Ohio governor during the Civil War, persuaded Lake Erie steamboat owners that coal mined in the Mahoning Valley could fuel their vessels if canal transportation were available between Youngstown and Cleveland. The railroad&#x27;s arrival in 1856 smoothed the path for further economic growth.

Youngstown&#x27;s industrial development changed the face of the Mahoning Valley. The community&#x27;s burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from Wales, Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of steel mills in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, Italy, and Greece.
In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Syria. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of Ku Klux Klan activity. The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and Italian and Irish Americans in neighboring Niles led Ohio Governor A. Victor Donahey to declare martial law. By 1928 the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field. Despite the prevalence of Irish Americans in Youngstown, their presence wasn&#x27;t always evident. When radio personality Pete Gabriel (who was Greek) came to Youngstown, he found out that there was no St. Patrick&#x27;s Day parade there at the time, so he started one.

The growth of industry attracted people from within the United States and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1871. In the 1880s, local attorney William R. Stewart was the second African American elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national Steel Strike of 1919, local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the Southern United States, many of whom were Black. This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace. Migration from the South rose dramatically in the 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the sharecropping system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.
Youngstown&#x27;s local iron ore deposits were exhausted by the early 20th century. Since the city is landlocked (the Mahoning River is not navigable), ore from Michigan and Minnesota had to arrive by rail from Cleveland and other Great Lakes port cities where large bulk carriers were unloaded. This put Youngstown at a competitive disadvantage to the iron and steel producers in Cleveland, Buffalo, Chicago and Detroit—all on Great Lake shores. Compared to these four cities, Youngstown had a higher cost of transporting raw materials to the mills, according to a &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; report published in January 1933. Higher transportation costs are one reason why Youngstown mills began their decline slightly earlier than manufacturing in other cities.

The city had a healthy position within the Midwest in terms of transportation connections. An airport built in 1930 hosted Capital and United Airlines flights through the region and to New York prior to the jet age of the latter 1950s. It was on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad mainline to Chicago with the &quot;Capital Limited&quot;. Likewise, Youngstown was on the Erie Railroad mainline, on its Chicago-Jersey City circuit, with trains such as the &quot;Atlantic Express/Pacific Express&quot; and the &quot;Lake Cities.&quot; The city was on the New York Central&#x27;s Pittsburgh-Buffalo circuit and the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s Pittsburgh-Cleveland circuit.

===Post-World War II decline===
The city&#x27;s population became more diverse after the end of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers. In the 1950s, the Latino population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church and the First Spanish Baptist Church of Ohio were among the largest religious institutions for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area. In 1951, city planners projected that Youngstown would grow to 200,000 to 250,000 in population due to continuously strong demand for domestic steel in western Europe, Japan, and South Korea, and so 12,000 acres on the city&#x27;s East Side were annexed and extended utilities in expectation of future housing projects, in addition to aggressive re-zoning for expanded commercial spaces throughout the city.

At 11:30 on Wednesday, September 6, 1967, only 9 of the 50 scheduled patrolmen arrived for work at the Youngstown Police Department. The others were not on strike. That was prevented by Ohio state law. The patrolmen, eventually numbering 300, along with another 300 city-employed firefighters, were instead attending &quot;continuous professional meetings&quot;, and would be until their demand for an immediate across-the-board raise of $1200 was met. By Saturday, the day they were ordered back to their jobs by a Common Pleas Court judge, citizens were reported as disturbed, rather than badly frightened, by the risks of police and fire services operating at about 30% normal headcounts. A car fire was the worst single incident. When ending the strike the judge also ordered the pay raise. Apart from a fruitless six-day &quot;sick call&quot; of police in Detroit in June 1967, Youngstown&#x27;s was the first major police strike since the Boston Police Strike in 1919. As the editorial writers at &quot;The Sheboygan Press&quot; of Sheboygan, Wisconsin put it, &quot;So we have seen the first successful strike by policemen and firemen. It is a precedent over which there should be little rejoicing.&quot;

The industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s, culminating with the September 19, 1977, closure of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Campbell Works after financial downturn due to changes in the steel manufacturing process and international competition. In response to subsequent challenges, the city has taken well-publicized steps to diversify economically, while building on some traditional strengths.

===Modern developments===

Downtown Youngstown has seen modest levels of new construction. In the 2000s, additions included the Nathaniel R. Jones Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in 2002, designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, the Mahoning County Children&#x27;s Services Center and George Voinovich Government Center in 2004, and both the Covelli Centre and Ohio Seventh District Court of Appeals in 2006.

In 2004, construction began on a 60-home upscale development called Arlington Heights, and a grant from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development allowed for the demolition of Westlake Terrace, a sprawling and dilapidated public housing project. Today, the site features a blend of senior housing, rental townhouses and for-sale single-family homes. Low real-estate prices and the efforts of the Youngstown Central Area Improvement Corporation have contributed to the purchase of several long-abandoned downtown buildings (many by outside investors) and their restoration and conversion into specialty shops, restaurants, and eventually condominiums. In addition, a $250 million New Urbanist revitalization of the Smoky Hollow neighborhood developed about 400 new residential units, university student housing, retail space, and a park.
In 2005, Federal Street, a major downtown thoroughfare that was closed off to create a pedestrian-oriented plaza, reopened to traffic. The downtown area has seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others. New construction has dovetailed with efforts to cultivate business growth. One of the area&#x27;s more successful business ventures in recent years has been the Youngstown Business Incubator, which fosters the growth of fledgling technology-based companies.

In line with these efforts to change the community&#x27;s image, the city government, in partnership with Youngstown State University, has organized an ambitious urban renewal plan known as &quot;Youngstown 2010&quot;. The stated goals of &quot;Youngstown 2010&quot; include the creation of a &quot;cleaner, greener, and better planned and organized Youngstown&quot;. In January 2005, the organization unveiled a master plan prepared by Urban Strategies Inc. of Toronto, which had taken shape during an extensive process of public consultation and meetings that gathered input from citizens. The plan, which included platforms such as the acceptance of a reduced population and an improved image and quality of life, received national attention and is consistent with efforts in other metropolitan areas to address the phenomenon of urban depopulation. &quot;Youngstown 2010&quot; received an award for public outreach from the American Planning Association in 2007.

On May 28, 2024, an explosion destroyed most of the first floor of the Realty Building in downtown Youngstown and severely damaged the floors above it, killing one bank employee and injuring seven. The explosion was suspected to have been caused by a natural gas leak.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Youngstown is in the Mahoning Valley on the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau. At the end of the last ice age, the glaciers left behind a uniform plain, with valleys such as that caused by the Mahoning River traversing the plain. Lakes created by glaciers that dammed small streams were eventually drained, leaving behind fertile terrain.

=== Climate ===
Youngstown has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;/&quot;Dfa&quot;), typical of the Midwestern United States, with four distinct seasons and lies within USDA hardiness zone 6a. Winters are cold and dry but typically bring a mix of rain, sleet, and snow with occasional heavy snowfall and icing. January is the coldest month with an average mean temperature of , with temperatures on average dropping to or below on 4.1 days and staying at or below freezing on 43 days per year. Snowfall averages per season, somewhat less than the snowbelt areas closer to Lake Erie. The snowiest month on record was in December 2010, while winter snowfall amounts have ranged from in 2010–11 to in 1948–49. Springs generally see a transition to fewer weather systems that produce heavier rainfall. Summers are typically very warm and humid with temperatures exceeding on 7.7 days per year on average; the annual count has been as high as 40 days in 1943, while the most recent year to not reach that mark is 2014. July is the warmest month with an average mean temperature of .

The all-time record high temperature in Youngstown of was established on July 10, 1936, which occurred during the Dust Bowl, and the all-time record low temperature of was set on January 19, 1994.

=== Neighborhoods ===
Downtown Youngstown consists of the original city layout designed by John Young and contains government buildings, banks and entertainment venues, including the Covelli Centre, Powers Auditorium and Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre. North of downtown is Youngstown State University and the Butler Institute of American Art. The Arlington, Mahoning Commons, Riverbend, Smoky Hollow and University neighborhoods surround downtown. The area is the least populous division of the city, but also its least residential by zoning. It is surrounded by the I-680 and Madison Avenue Expressway highway system.

The North Side consists of the Brier Hill, Crandall Park, North Heights, and Wick Park neighborhoods and the northern section of the Riverbend Industrial Park. Brier Hill was considered one of the city&#x27;s cultural hotbeds due to many Welsh, Irish, Italian, and African American migrants settling in it, but primarily was once viewed as the city&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot; as reflected by the Brier Hill-style pizza. Each year, at the end of August, the Brier Hill Fest attracts thousands of visitors from Northeast Ohio and Western Pennsylvania. The historic Crandall Park neighborhood was once home to the city&#x27;s wealthiest families, and many of the mansions of industrial executives are still including in the Crandall Park-Fifth Avenue Historic District.

Youngstown&#x27;s South Side is, and historically has been, the city&#x27;s densest and most populous division, with numerous neighborhoods from each of the city&#x27;s periods of expansion. The older neighborhoods in this area, namely Oak Hill, Erie, Warren, and Lower Gibson, were among the earliest settled outside of Youngstown during the 19th century and were annexed by the city by 1910. Later neighborhoods such as Fosterville, Newport, Lansingville, Buckeye Plat, and Cottage Grove came into being as industry and population expanded throughout the first half of the 20th century, being annexed in 1929 from the remainder of Youngstown Township. The Pleasant Grove and Brownlee Woods neighborhoods further south were also annexed in 1929 from Boardman Township. The South Side shares Mill Creek Park with the West Side.

The East Side is the largest of the city&#x27;s regions by area and consists of the East High, East Side, Hazelton, Landsdowne, Lincoln Knolls, Scienceville and Sharon Line/McGuffey Heights communities. The neighborhoods on the East Side closest to downtown Youngstown were among the earliest developed in the city. However, much of the East Side is undeveloped land annexed in the 1950s as part of a zoning effort for future development that never occurred.

The neighborhoods of Belle Vista, Cornersburg, Garden District, Kirkmere, Rocky Ridge, and Schenley on the West Side were built from the 1930s until the 1950s progressing southward, apart from the early Steelton neighborhood and industrial Salt Springs neighborhood. The West Side shares Mill Creek Park with the South Side and lies southwest of the Mahoning River.

==Economy==
=== Historical ===

Endowed with large deposits of coal and iron as well as &quot;old growth&quot; hardwood forests needed to produce charcoal, the Youngstown area developed a thriving steel industry, starting with the area&#x27;s blast furnace in 1803 by James and Daniel Heaton. By the mid-19th century, Youngstown was the site of several iron industrial plants, and because of easy rail connections to adjacent states, the iron industry continued to expand in the 1890s despite the depletion of local natural resources. At the turn of the 20th century, local industrialists began to convert to steel manufacturing, amid a wave of industrial consolidations that placed much of the Mahoning Valley&#x27;s industry in the hands of national corporations.

In the late 1930s, the community&#x27;s steel sector again gained national attention when Youngstown became a site of the so-called &quot;Little Steel Strike&quot;, an effort by the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, a precursor to United Steelworkers, to secure contract agreements with smaller steel companies. On June 21, 1937, strike-related violence in Youngstown resulted in two deaths and 42 injuries. Despite the violence, historian William Lawson observed that the strike transformed industrial unions from &quot;basically local and ineffective organizations into all-encompassing, nationwide collective bargaining representatives of American workers&quot;.

Between the 1920s and 1960s, the city was known as an important industrial hub that featured the massive furnaces and foundries of such companies as Republic Steel and U.S. Steel. At the same time, Youngstown never became economically diversified, as did larger industrial cities such as Chicago, Pittsburgh, Akron, or Cleveland. Hence, when economic changes forced the closure of plants throughout the 1970s, the city was left with few substantial economic alternatives. The September 19, 1977, announcement of the closure of a large portion of Youngstown Sheet and Tube, an event still referred to as &quot;Black Monday&quot;, is widely regarded as the death knell of the old area steel industry in Youngstown. In the wake of the steel plant shutdowns, the community lost an estimated 40,000 manufacturing jobs, 400 satellite businesses, $414 million in personal income, and from 33 to 75 percent of the school tax revenues. The Youngstown area has yet to fully recover from the loss of jobs in the steel sector.

The blow dealt to the community&#x27;s industrial economy in the 1970s was slightly mitigated by the auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured in an industrial complex on Youngstown&#x27;s Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown&#x27;s industrial economy had long been the General Motors Lordstown Assembly, which was the area&#x27;s largest industrial employer in the decades following the decline of the steel industry. Once one of the nation&#x27;s largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. The Lordstown Assembly was shuttered in March 2019 and is currently owned by Foxconn.

=== Current ===

The city&#x27;s largest employer is Youngstown State University (YSU), an urban public campus that serves about 15,000 students, just north of downtown.

Youngstown is the site of several steel and metalworking operations, though not to the extent of the past. The largest industrial employers within the city limits are Vallourec Star Steel Company, in the Brier Hill district, and Trivium Packaging. Steelite, a British ceramics manufacturer, has its U.S. headquarters based in Youngstown.

Youngstown&#x27;s downtown, which once underscored the community&#x27;s economic difficulties, is a site of new business growth. The Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI), in the heart of downtown, houses several start-up technology companies that have received office space, furnishings, and access to utilities. Some Incubator-supported companies have earned recognition, and a few are starting to outgrow their current space. &quot;Inc. Magazine&quot; rated one such company–Turning Technologies–as the fastest-growing privately held software company in the United States and 18th fastest-growing privately held company overall. To keep such companies downtown, the YBI secured approval to demolish a row of nearby vacant buildings to clear space for expansion. In 2014, the YBI was ranked as the top university-associated business incubator in the world by the Swedish University Business Incubator Index. In 2015, the YBI was the top University Associated Incubator in North America, and came in second to the Guinness Enterprise Centre in Dublin.

A number of products and enterprises introduced in Youngstown became national household names. Among them is Youngstown-based Schwebel&#x27;s Bakery, which was established in neighboring Campbell in the 20th century. The company now distributes bread products nationally. In the 1920s, Youngstown was the birthplace of the Good Humor brand of ice cream novelties, and the popular franchise of Handel&#x27;s Homemade Ice Cream &amp; Yogurt was established there in the 1940s. In the 1950s, Youngstown-born developer Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. established one of the country&#x27;s first modern shopping plazas in the suburban Boardman. The fast-food chain, Arby&#x27;s, opened the first of its restaurants in Boardman in 1964, and Arthur Treacher&#x27;s Fish &amp; Chips was headquartered in Youngstown in the late 1970s. More recently, the city&#x27;s downtown hosted the corporate headquarters of the now-defunct pharmacy chain store Phar-Mor, which was established by Youngstown native Mickey Monus.

== Culture ==
=== Entertainment ===
Despite the impact of regional economic decline, Youngstown offers an array of cultural and recreational resources. Youngstown&#x27;s newest venue is the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre; an outdoor venue opened in 2019 upon former industrial grounds in Downtown that hosts various musicians.

One of the city&#x27;s sports-related attractions is the Covelli Centre, which was funded primarily through a $26 million federal grant secured in 2000 by then-Congressman Jim Traficant. Located on the site of an abandoned steel mill, the large, high-tech facility opened in October 2005. It was formerly called the Chevrolet Center, and during planning it was known as the Youngstown Convocation Center. The centre&#x27;s main tenants are the Youngstown Phantoms, who play in the United States Hockey League. Previously, it was home to the Youngstown Steelhounds hockey team, who played in the CHL. The venue also hosts &quot;on ice&quot; musical shows and concerts.

Historically, one of the area&#x27;s most popular attractions was Idora Park in the Idora neighborhood of Youngstown&#x27;s south side. An urban amusement park, it operated from 1899 until it was closed after a large fire destroyed many of its premier rides in 1984.

===Theater===
The community&#x27;s culture center is Powers Auditorium, a former Warner Brothers movie palace that serves as the area&#x27;s primary music hall and a home for the Youngstown Symphony Orchestra. This downtown landmark is one of five auditoriums within the city. Ford Recital Hall was built in 2006 as an addition to newly renovated Powers Auditorium. Imposing and neo-classical Stambaugh Auditorium, on the city&#x27;s north side, has served for decades as a site of concerts and is often rented for private events. The facility also hosts the Stambaugh Youth Concert Band. Bruce Springsteen, who sang about the decline of Youngstown&#x27;s steel industry and its adverse effects on local workers in his ballad &quot;Youngstown&quot;, played at Stambaugh Auditorium on January 12, 1996, as part of his solo Ghost of Tom Joad Tour.

The Youngstown Playhouse, Mahoning County&#x27;s primary community theater, has served the area for more than 80 years, despite intermittent financial problems. Believed by some observers to be the nation&#x27;s oldest continuously operating community theater, the Youngstown Playhouse was the only community theater in Ohio to ever receive major institutional support from the Ohio Arts Council. The Oakland Center for the Arts, formerly in the downtown area, was a well-known venue for locally produced plays before it closed in 2015 due to poor management. In late 2016. the Oakland Center for the Arts was re-established with a new focus on youth and kids theatre.

Well known theatrical personalities from the Youngstown area include comedic actor Joe Flynn, screen actress Elizabeth Hartman, singer and Broadway performer Maureen McGovern, and television and screen actor Ed O&#x27;Neill.

===Museums===

The Butler Institute of American Art is on the northeastern edge of the Youngstown State University campus. Established by industrialist Joseph G. Butler Jr., in 1919, it was the first museum in the country dedicated to American art. Across the street from the Butler Institute stands the McDonough Museum of Art, YSU&#x27;s University Art Museum and the Mahoning Valley&#x27;s center for contemporary art. The McDonough, established in 1991, features changing exhibitions by regional, national and international artists and provides public access to the work of students, faculty and alumni from the Department of Art. The Clarence R. Smith Mineral Museum, also on the YSU campus, is operated by the university&#x27;s geology department and housed in a campus building.

To the immediate north of YSU is the Arms Family Museum of Local History. The museum, housed in a 1905 Arts &amp; Crafts style mansion on the main artery of Wick Avenue, is managed by the Mahoning Valley Historical Society. Once the estate of a local industrialist, it maintains period rooms that showcase the household&#x27;s original contents, including furnishings, art objects, and personal artifacts. The museum mounts rotating exhibits on topics related to local history. Recently, the museum opened the &quot;Anne Kilcawley Christman Hands-on History Room&quot;. The MVHS Archival Library operates in the estate&#x27;s former carriage house, near the back of the site.

The Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor sits south of the YSU campus on a grade overlooking the downtown area. This museum, owned and operated by the Ohio Historical Society, focuses on the Mahoning Valley&#x27;s history of steel production. Other museums include the Children&#x27;s Museum of the Valley, an interactive educational center in the downtown area, and the Davis Education and Recreation Center, a small museum that showcases the history of Youngstown&#x27;s Mill Creek Park.

On the city&#x27;s north side the Youngstown Steel Heritage Foundation is constructing the Tod Engine Heritage Park, featuring a collection of steel industry equipment and artifacts. The main exhibit is a 1914 William Tod Co. rolling mill steam engine that was built in Youngstown and used at the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Brier Hill Works. The Tod Engine is one of three remaining rolling mill engines in the United States and is a Mechanical and Materials Engineering Landmark.

==Parks and recreation==
Youngstown&#x27;s most popular resource is Mill Creek Park, a five-mile (8 km)-long stretch of woodland along the eponymous Mill Creek. Mill Creek Park is the oldest park district in Ohio, established as a township park in 1891. The park&#x27;s highlights include the restored 19th century Lanterman&#x27;s Mill, the rock formations of Bear&#x27;s Den, scores of nature trails, the Fellows Riverside Gardens and Education Center, the &quot;Cinderella&quot; suspension bridge, and two 18-hole Donald Ross golf courses. Mill Creek Park encompasses approximately , of drives and of foot trails. Its attractions include gardens, streams, lakes, woodlands, meadows, and wildlife.

Fellows Riverside Gardens&#x27; lookout point offers visitors contrasting views of the area. From the south side, the canopied woodlands overlooking Lake Glacier are visible; from the north side, visitors are presented with a view of downtown Youngstown. The park features two 18-hole golf courses. The North Course is on rolling terrain, while the South Course features narrow, tree-lined fairways. Other features include playgrounds, athletic fields, and picnic areas.

In 2005, Mill Creek Park was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. A plaque commemorating this event is near a memorial statue of Volney Rogers, the Youngstown attorney who set aside land for the creation of Mill Creek Park.

A smaller recreational area called Wick Park is on the city&#x27;s north side. Wick Park&#x27;s periphery is lined with early 20th-century mansions built by the city&#x27;s industrialists, business leaders, and professionals during Youngstown&#x27;s boom years. Stambaugh Auditorium, a popular venue for concerts and other public events, is near the park&#x27;s southwestern edge. Another small recreational area called Crandall Park is also on the north side. Crandall Park is surrounded by landscaped homes, tree-lined streets, and walkable access to shopping and recreation. Several cemeteries (notably historic Oak Hill Cemetery) and small recreational spaces are scattered throughout the city, including Homestead Park, John White Park, Lynn Park, Borts Pool and the Northside Pool.

==Sports==

Youngstown has enjoyed a long tradition of professional and semi-professional sports. The Mahoning Valley Scrappers, an MLB Draft League affiliate, have played at Eastwood Field since 1999. The Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League have played at the Covelli Centre since 2003. Amateur soccer club Mahoning Trumbull United SC has competed in the Northern Ohio Soccer League since 2023.

In earlier decades, the city produced scores of minor league baseball teams, including the Youngstown Ohio Works, Youngstown Champs, Youngstown Indians, Youngstown Steelmen, Youngstown Browns, Youngstown Gremlins, and Youngstown Athletics. Local enthusiasm for baseball was such that the community hosted championship games of the National Amateur Baseball Federation throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The area&#x27;s minor league baseball teams were supplemented by semi-professional football teams, including the Youngstown Patricians, who won the 1915 championship of the informal &quot;Ohio League&quot; (a direct predecessor to the National Football League), and the Youngstown Hardhats, who competed in the Middle Atlantic Football League in the 1970s and early 1980s. For three seasons, Youngstown was home to the Mahoning Valley Thunder of the now-defunct af2, the minor league for the Arena Football League until 2009 when the franchise ceased operations. In 2005, the Ohio Red Bulls semi-pro football team of the United States Football Association won their first championship. Local minor league basketball teams included the Youngstown Pride of the WBA from 1987 to 1992, the Youngstown Hawks of the IBA in 1999, and the Mahoning Valley Wildcats of the IBL in 2005. The Youngstown SteelHounds hockey team played in the Central Hockey League from 2005 until 2008.

Youngstown has produced many prominent athletes with connections to the city, including former world boxing champions Greg Richardson, IBF lightweight champion Harry Arroyo, College Football Hall of Fame end Bob Dove, Hall of Fame umpire Billy Evans, major league pitcher Dave Dravecky, NFL quarterback Bernie Kosar, NFL Running back Lynn Bowden Jr., IBF cruiserweight champion Jeff Lampkin, WBA lightweight champion Ray &quot;Boom Boom&quot; Mancini, major league manager Jimmy McAleer, WBC and WBO middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik, legendary baseball trainer &quot;Bonesetter&quot; Reese, major league outfielder George Shuba, and Heisman Trophy recipient Frank Sinkwich.

===Youngstown State Penguins===
The community has a lengthy tradition of collegiate sports. The Youngstown State Penguins compete in the Missouri Valley Football Conference. The Penguins, noted participants in FCS (I-AA) football, play their games at Stambaugh Stadium and enjoy one of the more supportive fan bases. All other YSU athletic teams compete in the Horizon League, which does not sponsor football. The Youngstown State men and women&#x27;s basketball teams hold their games at Youngstown State&#x27;s Beeghly Center. The teams average about 2,500 fans per game, a number that rose with a new style of play under former head coach Jerry Slocum. In addition, the YSU baseball and softball teams have enjoyed local support and success. The baseball team reached the NCAA super-regionals in 2005, and the softball team did so in 2006.

==Government and politics==

Youngstown is governed by a mayor who is elected every four years and limited to a maximum of two terms. Mayors are traditionally inaugurated on or around January 2. The city has tended to elect Democratic mayors since the late 1920s because of the local unions&#x27; support for Democratic candidates for office. Youngstown&#x27;s mayor is Jamael Tito Brown. Jay Williams was the city&#x27;s first African-American mayor and its first independent mayor since 1922.

Residents elect an eight-member city council composed of representatives of the city&#x27;s seven wards and a council president. The council traditionally meets every first and third Wednesday of the month. Meanwhile, the board of control, chaired by the Mayor, oversees contracts for public projects within the municipal limits.


In the Ohio General Assembly, Youngstown is located in the 59th State Representative District, represented by Lauren McNally (D), and in the 33rd Senate District, represented by Alessandro Cutrona (R). Federally, Youngstown has been located in Ohio&#x27;s 6th congressional district since 2023 after being redistricted. Its federal senator is Bernie Moreno (R). Like many urban areas in the U.S., Youngstown is a Democratic stronghold, although the remainder of Mahoning County has been trending to the right in recent elections. Youngstown has supported Democratic politicians in statewide elections throughout its history, including Sherrod Brown, Ted Strickland, and Richard Cordray. Youngstown has become a political backdrop for both Democrats and Republicans who go to the area to campaign on economic development and jobs.

Circa 1972 to 2016, the majority of voters in Mahoning County and Youngstown chose Democratic Party candidates in U.S. presidential elections. Tex Fischer stated that during the 2012 U.S. presidential election, area residents perceived Mitt Romney as being inauthentic, which contributed to his loss.

However in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the majority in those areas selected Donald Trump. Andrew Gumbell of &quot;The Observer&quot; stated that Trump gained popularity from 2017 to 2020 even though the Youngstown economy declined in the same period; Trump in 2017 made statements saying that he will revive the area economically. In the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Trump won the same areas by 13 points. Gumbell cited &quot;disillusioned working-class voters&quot; and their feelings for the rising popularity of Trump in the area; according to Gumbell, the voters perceive all politicians to be corrupt but Trump to be honest about being a corrupt person. Gumbell added the voters believe that Trump would abolish a system that disadvantages them, but that the majority of area voters do not believe that, in Gumbell&#x27;s words, that Trump will &quot;fix everything or believe him when he says he will.&quot;

=== Crime ===
Crime has been a lingering problem in many of the Rust Belt&#x27;s big and small urban communities, hampering economic recovery. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Youngstown was nationally identified with gangland slayings often committed with car bombs. The town gained the nicknames &quot;Murdertown, USA&quot; and &quot;Bomb City, USA,&quot; while the phrase &quot;Youngstown tune-up&quot; became a nationally popular slang term for car-bomb assassination. The image of Youngstown&#x27;s association with crime was reinforced by the construction of prisons inside the metropolitan area. As of 2012, three adult correctional facilities continue to operate within city limits: the Mahoning County Justice Center the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, and the Ohio State Penitentiary.

For decades, Youngstown was a haven for organized crime, and related corruption was ingrained into the fabric of its society. A 2000 publication in &quot;The New Republic&quot; listed a &quot;chief of police, the outgoing prosecutor, the sheriff, the county engineer, members of the local police force, a city law director, several defense attorneys, politicians, judges, and a former assistant U.S. attorney&quot; as controlled by the Mob. The city accelerated measures to limit the influence of organized crime upon all sectors of municipal life. In 2006 Youngstown was ranked by Morgan Quitno Press, a Kansas-based publishing and research company, as the 9th most dangerous city in the United States. After The Saturday Evening Post framed Youngstown as &quot;Crimetown U.S.A.&quot;, there was an interest by many to create documentaries or podcasts to get in-depth information about the corruption unfolding in the city. Released in July 2022, Marc Smerling released a podcast titled &quot;Crooked City&quot; to share some of those stories.

==Education==

Youngstown is served by the Public Library of Youngstown and Mahoning County system, with libraries located in the Downtown (Main), Brownlee Woods, East High, Newport, and Schenley (Michael Kusalaba) neighborhoods.

===Primary and secondary===
The Youngstown City School District manages public education within the city and covers almost all of the city limits. Since 2015, the state government has overseen the district&#x27;s operation due to district mismanagement. The district&#x27;s high school graduation rate has improved since the takeover, from 65% in 2015 to 88% in 2020. YCSD currently operates six elementary schools, three middle schools, and three high schools, as well as one alternative school and one technical school. The district extensively built new schools throughout the late 2000s, and sold many of its older buildings to local private schools.

At one time, the school district had eight dedicated public high schools (including now-defunct North, Rayen, South, and Wilson), but mergers since the 1990s have resulted in four secondary schools: Chaney High School, Choffin Career and Technical Center, East High School, and Youngstown Rayen Early College. The early college program, in cooperation with Youngstown State University, enables middle and high school students to attend classes both on campus and at YCSD schools and earn college credit.

The Diocese of Youngstown once oversaw more than 20 schools within the city. As a result of dwindling enrollment, only four Catholic schools now operate within Youngstown proper. These include two primary schools—St. Christine&#x27;s School and St. Joseph the Provider School—and two secondary schools, Cardinal Mooney High School and Ursuline High School. Several additional Catholic schools operate in the region which accept Youngstown students.

Youngstown hosts a small number of private schools. These include Valley Christian School, a nondenominational K-12 school; Akiva Academy, a progressive K–8 school in the Jewish Community Center; and the Montessori School of the Mahoning Valley, which offers alternative learning environments for students ranging from preschool to eighth grade. There are also various smaller, K-8 charter academies in the city, such as the Stambaugh Charter Academy and South Side Academy.

===Higher education===
Youngstown State University, the primary institution of higher learning in the Youngstown metropolitan area, traces its origins to a local YMCA program that began offering college-level courses in 1908. YSU joined the Ohio system of higher education in 1967. The university has an enrollment of about 11,000 undergraduate and graduate students within its seven colleges. The campus is just north of the city&#x27;s downtown and south of Youngstown&#x27;s historic Fifth Avenue district, a neighborhood of Tudor-, Victorian-, and Spanish Colonial Revival-style homes.

Eastern Gateway Community College operated a campus in downtown Youngstown from 2009 to 2024.

==Media==

=== Print ===
&quot;The Vindicator&quot; is the sole daily newspaper in the city, currently published as a zoned edition of Warren&#x27;s &quot;Tribune Chronicle&quot; in broadsheet. It formerly competed with the Warren-based paper, and the Lisbon-based &quot;Morning Journal&quot;, although they primarily covered their respective counties, with limited coverage of Mahoning County and Youngstown, until in June 2019 it was announced that &quot;The Vindicator&quot; would cease publication by mid-August of the same year. Although this newspaper carries the name of the old &quot;Vindicator&quot;, its scope is comparatively limited, with the majority of previous &quot;Vindicator&quot; journalists not being carried over to the new edition.

Other newspapers that print in Youngstown include bi-monthly &quot;The Business Journal&quot;, &quot;The Metro Monthly&quot;, and the bi-weekly &quot;The Jambar&quot;, published by the students of Youngstown State University on Tuesdays and Thursdays while classes are in session.

=== TV ===

With 273,480 television households, the Youngstown market is the nation&#x27;s 106th largest, according to Nielsen Media Research.

The market is served is served by four full power television stations. including WFMJ-TV (channel 21, NBC, with The CW channel 21.2 under the WBCB call letters), WKBN-TV (channel 27, CBS), WYTV (channel 33, ABC, with MNTV on 33.2), and WNEO channel 45 (PBS).

Low power station WYFX-LD channel 62 serves as Youngstown&#x27;s Fox affiliate, and is simulcast on WKBN 27.2.

The Youngstown area is served by the Western Reserve Transit Authority (WRTA) bus system, which is supported through Mahoning County property and sales taxes. WRTA, whose main terminal is in the downtown area, provides service throughout the city and into surrounding Mahoning and Trumbull counties. The downtown terminal serves as the Youngstown area&#x27;s Greyhound terminal.

=== Air ===
The Youngstown-Warren Regional Airport is the primary airport for the region. As of 2022, no commercial airlines serve the airport, with Allegiant Air ending service on January 4, 2018. The airport is home to the Youngstown Air Reserve Station and 910th Airlift Wing. Smaller general aviation airports in the city and vicinity include Lansdowne Airport and Youngstown Elser Metro Airport.

=== Rail ===
In the vicinity of the WRTA terminal is a former Baltimore and Ohio Railroad station. The historic terminal building served B&amp;O trains until 1971. Since converted into a banquet hall, it was a station along Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Three Rivers&quot; between Chicago and New York from 1995 to 2005. The nearest Amtrak service is the &quot;Capitol Limited&quot; at Alliance station 42 miles to the southwest. Freight rail lines owned by CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and the Youngstown and Southeastern Railroad still go through the area.

=== Rideshare ===
On June 23, 2016, Uber launched services in Youngstown, covering all of Mahoning County and most of Trumbull County.

<text>Carlisle ( ) is a city in northwestern Warren and southern Montgomery counties in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of Ohio. The city is in Franklin Township, Warren County, Ohio and German Township, Montgomery County, Ohio.

The Warren County portion of Carlisle is part of the Cincinnati–Middletown, OH-KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Montgomery County portion is part of the Dayton, OH Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Carlisle is known for an area landmark: a &quot;double UFO&quot; house off Chamberlain Road, which resembles two silver-colored flying saucers connected by a metal duct. This is actually two Futuro houses combined into one residence.

Just west of town, at the Twin Rivers Metro Park, is a protected archaeological site, the Carlisle Fort, a hilltop earthwork believe to have been built between 1,700 and 2,000 years ago, either as a fortress or as a Hopewell ceremonial site.

==History==
Carlisle had its start in 1850 when the railroad was extended to that point and a train station was built. The village was named for &quot;railroad man&quot; George B. Carlisle, who in the mid-19th century &quot;bought and platted a large section of the community&quot;. A post office was established at Carlisle in 1852, and remained in operation until 1961.

Carlisle&#x27;s population increased from 4,872 in the 1990 census to 5,121 in the 2000 census; passing the threshold of 5,000, its designation was changed from village to city. As of the 2010 census, the population was 4,915; this population loss caused Carlisle to once again become a village. In the 2020 census, the population was 5,501; on October 20, 2021, Carlisle regained city status.

<text>Springboro is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio. Regarded as a suburb of Cincinnati and Dayton, it is located mostly in Warren County in Clearcreek and Franklin Townships; with a small portion in Miami Township in Montgomery County. The city is part of the Miami Valley. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 19,062.

Springboro is located at the geographic center of the Cincinnati-Dayton Metroplex, the 14th largest urban area in the United States. Most of the city is located in Warren County, and is part of Metro Cincinnati. The far northern portion is in Montgomery County, the central county of Metro Dayton. Most of Springboro is served by the Springboro Community School District and its high school, Springboro High School.

==History==
Settled as early as 1796, Springboro was founded in 1815 by Jonathan Wright, as &quot;Springborough.&quot; Jonathan Wright&#x27;s father Joel was a surveyor who plotted Columbus and Dayton, Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky. Springboro was predominantly Quaker during its early years.

By the 1830s, two mills and a woolen factory in Springboro had been built up on the abundant springs for which the town was named.

As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Springboro played a significant role by providing hiding places for escaping slaves. On October 17, 1999, Springboro was the first city to erect an Ohio Underground Railroad Historic Marker. The dedication was part of the 4th Annual Ohio Underground Railroad Summit.

Beginning in the late 1990s, Springboro&#x27;s population began a boom that would redefine the city. Fueled by the growth of the Dayton Area, Springboro transformed from a sleepy town along I-75 into a real estate hotspot in the Miami Valley. Growth in Springboro led to a new highway exit being created at I-75 &amp; Austin Boulevard and the construction of three new schools by the SCCSD in the 2000s. Today Springboro is one of the most important suburbs in the Cincinnati-Dayton metro area due to its stronghold on the growth between the two major cities. The mayor of Springboro is John H. Agenbroad, who was reelected in 2019. The vast majority of new development occurred to the east of SR-741 (Main Street).

<doc id="150936" wikidata="Q2289399" url="?curid=150936" title="Elmore, Ohio">
<text>Elmore is a village in Ottawa and Sandusky counties in the U.S. state of Ohio. The population was 1,370 at the 2020 census.

The Ottawa County portion of Elmore is part of the Toledo Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Sandusky County portion is part of the Fremont Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Elmore is located in what used to be known as the Black Swamp, a sprawling area of marsh that covered the majority of northwest Ohio, and was primarily inhabited by Native Americans until the 19th century. It is believed that the Portage River, which runs alongside the village, most likely derives its name from early explorers who were forced to portage or carry their canoes and boats around the river&#x27;s intermittent shallows and rapids. German settlers during the first half of the 1800s began the long process of draining the land and clear cutting the dense forest exposing the nutrient rich soil, which, along with a once thriving railroad, provided the foundation for the village’s early growth and development. Elmore was surveyed and platted on October 2, 1851. The land surrounding Elmore is tabletop flat. Several sawmills in the vicinity provided the badly needed &quot;planks&quot; (boards) for the muddy &quot;plank road&quot;, designated as U.S. Route 20, between Fremont, Ohio and Perrysburg, Ohio. The Ohio Turnpike replaced US 20 as the main avenue across northern Ohio, but US 20 is still widely used. The building of the Turnpike in the 1950s affected every town along US 20, illustrated by abandoned motels and restaurants along its course.

Elmore was the site of the original manufacture of the Elmore automobile, one of the first companies bought up by W.C. Durant to form General Motors, until the factory was relocated to Clyde. The nearby beryllium plant is a key player in nuclear power, nuclear weaponry, and space program technology.

Present-day Elmore is a small community with a business district that has struggled to achieve success in recent years. The New York Central railroad has been gone for many decades, and the village has faced challenges related to a decreased transportation role after construction of the Ohio Turnpike, which bypassed the village. However, the increasing ease of modern travel and the construction of a Turnpike interchange in 1997 have created new opportunities for the village. Many locals commute to Toledo or other near-by cities and towns for work while the village promotes itself as a place for others to play. In recent years, the presence of several new stores has brought some success to the downtown area as a destination and village leaders have attempted to cultivate that image with various measures such as old-fashioned street posts and a refurbished train depot. In recent years, the annual Portage River Festival, various other local events, and a fairly well known headless motorcycle-riding ghost are what tend to bring people into the area.

In 2011, Elmore attracted national news coverage for its unique mayoral race featuring incumbent Lowell Krumnow and his older brother, Councilman James Krumnow.
