<text>is a professional baseball league and the highest level of baseball in Japan. Locally, it is often called , meaning simply &quot;Professional Baseball&quot;; outside of Japan, NPB is often referred to as &quot;Japanese baseball&quot;.

The roots of the league can be traced back to the formation of the in 1934. The first professional circuit for the sport in Japan, the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), was founded two years later and continued to play even through the final years of World War II. The organization that is today&#x27;s NPB was formed when the JBL reorganized in 1950, dividing its 15 teams into two leagues, which would meet in the annual season-ending Japan Series championship play-off series of games starting that year.

NPB comprises twelve teams divided equally in two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, a format which it has largely kept since . It has seen several waves of expansion and contraction, sometimes at the same time, to keep it at those numbers; most recently, in 2005, the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes merged with the Orix BlueWave to form the Orix Buffaloes, while the Rakuten Golden Eagles were added as an expansion team. As is common in Asian baseball (and unlike North American leagues), teams are generally named after their corporate owners, such as Yomiuri and Softbank. NPB also oversees two affiliated minor leagues, the Western League and the Eastern League.

Since the first Japan Series in , the Yomiuri Giants have the most championships with 22, and the most appearances with 37. Following the 2024 season, the Yokohama DeNA BayStars, who defeated the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks 4–2 in the 2024 Japan Series, are the reigning champions. The Japan Series has been contested 75 times as of 2024, with the Central League leading the Pacific League in wins, 38-37.

NPB was the only professional sports league in Japan until the foundation of the J.League in 1993. It is the eleventh-wealthiest professional sport league by revenue in the world, and the second-wealthiest baseball league, behind Major League Baseball (MLB); it is also the wealthiest sports league in Asia. NPB has the second-highest total season attendance of any league, also behind MLB, despite playing considerably fewer games per season.

==League structure==
Nippon Professional Baseball consists of two leagues, the Central League and the Pacific League, which each have six teams. There are also two secondary-level professional minor leagues, the Eastern League and the Western League, that play shorter schedules for developing players. NPB teams are allowed to have more than one minor league team as long as they are outside of the established minor league system, with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and Yomiuri Giants being the only teams taking advantage of this. As of 2023, the Hawks have three minor league teams, the Giants have two, and the other ten teams only have one minor league team each. Teams below the Eastern and Western Leagues play exhibition matches against various teams of collegiate, industrial, Shikoku Island League Plus, and other NPB minor league statuses.

The Central League and Pacific League operate as separate entities, unlike the four major professional sports leagues of North America whose leagues each operate as one singular entity. TV rights for games are always held by a game&#x27;s home team. The Pacific League has used the designated hitter (DH) rule since 1975, while the Central League has not used the DH outside of interleague play where a Pacific League team is the home team and in the 1985 Japan Series.

The season starts in late March or early April, and ends in October, with two or three all-star games in July. In recent decades prior to 2007, the two leagues each scheduled between 130 and 140 regular season games, with the 146 games played by the Central League in 2005 and 2006 being the only exception. Both leagues have since adopted 143-game seasons, 71 or 72 each at home and on road, facing their five respective intra-league opponents 25 times each and facing their six interleague opponents three times each in late May to early June in interleague play, with a separate champion being crowned for the team with the best record through the 18 games of interleague play. In general, Japanese teams play six games a week, with every Monday off (except on specific occasions, such as a game being played outside of the home team&#x27;s primary stadium or if a rainout forced a game to be postponed to a Monday). Unlike in Major League Baseball, doubleheaders have not been featured in NPB since the late 1990s.

Following the conclusion of each regular season, the top three teams from each league go on to play in the Climax Series championship play-off tournament, with the winner of each play-off tournament facing off in a best-of-seven championship series known as the Japan Series (known locally as the Nippon Series). Implemented in by the Pacific League (then known as the Pacific League Playoffs) and in by the Central League, the Climax Series is a two-stage system; in the &quot;First Stage&quot;, the second and third-place ranking teams face off in a best-of-three series played entirely in the second place team&#x27;s home stadium. In the case of an instance where the series ends 1–1–1, the higher seed always advances to the Final Stage. In the &quot;Final Stage&quot;, the winner of the First Stage will face off against the league&#x27;s pennant winner in a best-of-six series played entirely in the pennant winner&#x27;s home stadium. The higher seed always starts with a &quot;ghost win&quot;, or a 1–0 advantage in the series before any games have been played, meaning the higher seed only has to win three games whereas the lower seed has to win four games. In the event of a tie, the higher seed would subsequently only need to win two games. The winners of each league&#x27;s Final Stage then face off in the Japan Series, a best-of-seven series mirroring the format of the World Series. In the rare instance where the series ends 3–3–1 after seven games, a Game 8 will be played with unlimited innings at the stadium with home-field advantage. Hypothetically, a Japan Series can go up to 14 games in length if each of the first seven games resulted in a 12-inning tie. Since its inception, home-field advantage alternates from year to year between the CL and PL, with the CL representative getting home-field advantage in even years and the PL representative getting home-field advantage in odd years.

Since its adoption by both leagues in 2007, Climax Series does not determine who won each league&#x27;s pennant, rather the team with the best regular season record in each league wins the pennant, regardless of their result in the Climax Series. This has led to four occasions where the Japan Series champion did not win their league&#x27;s pennant that year, with those being the Chunichi Dragons, Chiba Lotte Marines, and the and Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. However, from to , the winner of the Pacific League Playoffs was given the Pacific League pennant for that year.

==Financial problems==
Financial problems plague many teams in the league. It is believed that all teams are operating with considerable subsidies, often as much as ¥6 billion (about US$44.9 million), from their parent companies. A raise in the salaries of players is often blamed, but from the start of the professional league, parent companies paid the difference as an advertisement. Most teams have never tried to improve their finances through constructive marketing. In addition, teams in the Central League historically saw much higher profits than the Pacific League, having popular teams such as the Giants and Tigers.

The number of metropolitan areas represented in the league increased from four to five in 1988, when the Nankai Hawks (now Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks) were sold to Daiei and moved to Fukuoka, nine years after the Nishitetsu Lions moved from Fukuoka to Tokorozawa to become the Seibu Lions, and from five to seven between 2003 and 2005, as the Nippon-Ham Fighters moved from Tokyo to Sapporo prior to the season. The Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes merged with the Orix BlueWave (becoming the Orix Buffaloes) in the middle of 2004, which caused a player strike that eventually resulted in the creation of the Tōhoku Rakuten Golden Eagles being founded in Sendai to maintain the 12-team balance before the season.

Until 1993, baseball was the only team sport played professionally in Japan. In that year, the J.League professional association football league was founded. The new league placed teams in prefectural capitals around the country—rather than clustering them in and around Tokyo—and the teams were named after their locations rather than after corporate sponsors, despite many clubs in the J.League still being owned and subsidized by corporate entities.

The wave of players moving to Major League Baseball, which began with Hideo Nomo &quot;retiring&quot; from the Kintetsu Buffaloes, then signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers, has also added to the financial problems. Attendance suffered as teams lost their most marketable players, while TV ratings declined as viewers tuned into broadcasts of Major League games. To discourage players from leaving to play in North America, or to at least compensate teams that lose players, Japanese baseball and MLB agreed on a posting system for players under contract. MLB teams wishing to negotiate with a player submit bids for a &quot;posting fee&quot;, which the winning MLB team would pay the Japanese team if the player signs with the MLB team. Free agents are not subject to the posting system, however, and some teams almost never post their players.

==History==

===Origins===
The first professional baseball team in Japan was founded by media mogul Matsutarō Shōriki in late 1934 and called the Dai Nippon Tokyo Yakyu Kurabu (&quot;the Great Japan Tokyo Baseball Club&quot;). After matching up with a team of visiting American All-Stars that included Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Charlie Gehringer, the team spent the 1935 season barnstorming in the U.S., winning 93 of 102 games against semi-pro and Pacific Coast League teams. According to historian Joseph Reaves, &quot;The only minor drawbacks to the team&#x27;s popularity in the States were their kanji characters and their cumbersome Japanese name. They rectified both by renaming themselves the Tokyo Kyojin [&#x27;Tokyo Giants&#x27;] and adopting a uniform identical to the New York Giants...&quot;

From 1936 to 1950, professional baseball in Japan was played under the banner of the Japanese Baseball League (JBL). The league&#x27;s dominant team during this period was the Tokyo Kyojin, which won nine league championships, including six in a row from 1938 to 1943. (The team was officially renamed the Yomiuri Giants in 1947.)

===NPB establishment===
After the 1949 season, the JBL team owners reorganized into the NPB; Daiei Stars owner Masaichi Nagata promoted a two-league system, which became the Pacific League (initially called the Taiheiyo Baseball Union) and the Central League. (Nagata became the first president of the Pacific League.) The league now known as Nippon Pro Baseball began play in the 1950 season.

Four JBL teams formed the basis of the Central League: the Chunichi Dragons, the Hanshin Tigers, the Yomiuri Giants, and the Shochiku Robins (formerly the Taiyō Robins). To fill out the league, four new teams were formed: the Hiroshima Carp, the Kokutetsu Swallows, the Nishi Nippon Pirates, and the Taiyō Whales.

Four JBL teams formed the basis of the Pacific League: the Hankyu Braves, the Nankai Hawks, the Daiei Stars, and the Tokyu Flyers. To fill out the league, three new teams were formed: the Kintetsu Pearls, the Mainichi Orions, and the Nishitetsu Clippers.

Matsutarō Shōriki, the Giants&#x27; owner, acted as NPB&#x27;s unofficial commissioner and oversaw the first Japan Series, which featured the Mainichi Orions defeating the Shochiku Robins 4 games to 2.

===Expansion and contraction===
The Central League&#x27;s Nishi Nippon Pirates existed for one season—they placed sixth in 1950, and the following season merged with the Nishitetsu Clippers (also based in Fukuoka) to form the Nishitetsu Lions. This brought the number of Central League teams down to an ungainly arrangement of seven. In 1952, it was decided that any Central League team ending the season with a winning percentage below .300 would be disbanded or merged with other teams. The Shochiku Robins fell into this category, and were merged with the Taiyō Whales to become the Taiyō Shochiku Robins in January 1953. This enabled the Central League to shrink to an even number of six teams.

In 1954 a new Pacific League team was founded, the Takahashi Unions, to increase the number of teams in that division to eight. Although the team was stocked with players from the other Pacific League teams, the Unions struggled from the outset and finished in the second division every season. In 1957, the Unions were merged with the Daiei Stars to form the Daiei Unions (and again bringing the number of Pacific League teams down to seven). The Unions existed for a single season, finishing in last place, 43-1/2 games out of first. In 1958, the Unions merged with the Mainichi Orions to form the Daimai Orions. This enabled the Pacific League to contract from the ungainly seven-team arrangement to six teams.

After these various franchise developments, by the end of the 1950s, Nippon Professional Baseball had contracted from the initial allotment of 15 teams down to the current number of 12.

===1960s and 1970s===
On September 1, 1964, Nankai Hawks&#x27; prospect Masanori Murakami became the first Japanese player to play in Major League Baseball when he appeared on the mound for the San Francisco Giants; he returned to Japan in 1966. Disputes over the rights to his contract eventually led to the 1967 United States – Japanese Player Contract Agreement; it would be almost 30 years before another Japanese player played in the Major Leagues.

Continuing their dominance from the JBL, the Yomiuri Giants won nine consecutive Japan Series championships from 1965 to 1973.

The Black Mist Scandal rocked Nippon Professional Baseball between 1969 and 1971. The fallout from a series of game-fixing scandals resulted in several star players receiving long suspensions, salary cuts, or being banned from professional play entirely; the resulting abandonment of baseball by many fans in Japan also led to the sale of the Nishitetsu Lions and the Toei Flyers.

From 1973 to 1982, in a forerunner to today&#x27;s Climax Series playoff rounds, the Pacific League employed a split season with the first-half winner playing against the second-half winner in a mini-playoff to determine its champion. In 1975, the Pacific League adopted the designated hitter rule. These were implemented in an attempt to draw fans back to Pacific League, as the Pacific League was hit significantly harder by the Black Mist Scandal than the Central League, with only the Hankyu Braves not having players involved in the incident.

===1980s and the &quot;Invincible Seibu&quot; ===
After being a second division team for much of the 1960s and 1970s, in 1983 the Seibu Lions began a period of sustained success. The team gained the moniker &quot;Invincible Seibu&quot; during the 1980s and 1990s due to their sustained domination of the league, winning 11 league championships and eight Japan Series championships between 1982 and 1994. The Lions had a powerful lineup in this period, loaded with sluggers such as Koji Akiyama, Kazuhiro Kiyohara, and Orestes Destrade. Their defense also benefited from the services of skilled players such as Hiromichi Ishige, Hatsuhiko Tsuji and catcher Tsutomu Ito. Among the pitchers employed by the Lions in this period was &quot;The Oriental Express&quot; Taigen Kaku, Osamu Higashio, Kimiyasu Kudoh, Hisanobu Watanabe, and relievers Yoshitaka Katori and Tetsuya Shiozaki.

American expatriate players made their mark in NPB in the 1980s, with players like the Lee brothers (Leron Lee and Leon Lee), Greg &quot;Boomer&quot; Wells, Randy Bass, and Ralph Bryant playing key roles on their NPB teams.

===Hideo Nomo and the exodus to MLB===
In 1995, star pitcher Hideo Nomo &quot;retired&quot; from the Kintetsu Buffaloes and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Nomo pitched over the span of 14 seasons in the Major Leagues before retiring in 2008. He won the Rookie of the Year Award in 1995. He twice led the league in strikeouts, and also threw two no-hitters (the only Japanese pitcher to throw a no-hitter in Major League Baseball until Hisashi Iwakuma achieved the feat in August 2015). Nomo&#x27;s MLB success led to more NPB players moving to Major League Baseball, and eventually led to the creation of the &quot;posting system&quot; in 1998.

Since Nomo&#x27;s exodus, more than 60 NPB players have played Major League Baseball. Some of the more notable examples include:
* Ichiro Suzuki: After nine years with the Orix BlueWave, in 2001 Ichiro was posted by the BlueWave and claimed by MLB&#x27;s Seattle Mariners. The first Japanese-born position player to be signed to the major leagues, Ichiro led the American League (AL) in batting average and stolen bases en route to being named AL Rookie of the Year and AL Most Valuable Player. Ichiro, a member of MLB&#x27;s 3,000-hit club, has established a number of MLB batting records, including the single-season record for hits with 262. He had ten consecutive 200-hit seasons, the longest streak by any player in history. Between his career hits in Japan&#x27;s and America&#x27;s major leagues, Ichiro has the most all-time top-flight hits. On August 27, 2022, Ichiro was enshrined in the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame. On January 21, 2025, Ichiro was elected to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) in his first year on the ballot, becoming the first Asian-born player to receive American baseball&#x27;s highest honor.
* Hideki Matsui: The slugger played 10 seasons for the Yomiuri Giants, and then in 2003 moved to MLB, where he starred for the New York Yankees for seven more seasons, including being named the Most Valuable Player for the 2009 World Series. He was the first power hitter from Japan to succeed in Major League Baseball.
* Kazuhiro Sasaki: He is a closer famed for his splitter, known as &quot;The Fang&quot;. In 2000, he won the American League Rookie of the Year Award after saving 37 games for the Mariners. In 2001, he was a vital contributor to the Mariners&#x27; extremely strong team that won an American League record 116 games, of which he saved 45. In 2001 and 2002, he was an All-Star. After 2003, he returned to Japan to pitch in the NPB until his retirement in 2005.
* Kazuo Matsui: After eight stellar seasons with the Seibu Lions, Matsui signed with the New York Mets on December 15, 2003, in 2004 becoming the first Japanese infielder to play with a Major League Baseball team. His seven seasons in Major League Baseball were not as successful, and he later returned to NPB. Matsui now resides as the manager of his former Lions team.
* Shohei Ohtani: He is a two-way player who was a five-time All-Star while playing for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters. Ohtani holds the record for fastest pitch in NPB history at . After signing with the Los Angeles Angels, Ohtani won the 2018 AL Rookie of the Year award. In 2021, he became the first player in MLB history to be named an All-Star as both a pitcher and a position player. After the conclusion of the season, Ohtani was unanimously named the AL Most Valuable Player.

===Merger and strike of 2004===

In September 2004, the professional Japanese players went on strike for the first time in over 70 years. The strike arose from a dispute that took place between the owners of the 12 professional Japanese baseball teams and the players&#x27; union (which was led by popular Yakult Swallows player-manager Atsuya Furuta), concerning the merging of the Osaka Kintetsu Buffaloes and the Orix BlueWave. The owners wanted to get rid of the financially defunct Buffaloes, and merge the two baseball leagues, since teams in the Central League saw much higher profits than the Pacific League, having popular teams such as the Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers. After negotiations, the owners agreed to guarantee the survival of the Chiba Lotte Marines and the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, leaving the Central League with six teams and the Pacific League with five.

A battle escalated between the players union and the owners, and reached its height when Yomiuri Giants owner Tsuneo Watanabe controversially remarked that Furuta was &quot;a mere player&quot;, implying that players had no say in what league would look like the next year. The dispute received huge press coverage (which mostly favored Furuta and the players&#x27; union) and was dubbed one of the biggest events in the history of Japanese baseball. Proposals and amendments concerning interleague games, player drafting, and management were also discussed between the players union and the owners during this period.

The strike was originally planned for all Saturday and Sunday games that month, starting from September 11, but was pushed back due to the agreement of another meeting between the union and the owners on September 10. The players decided to strike on September 18–19, 2004, when no progress was made in the negotiations, as there was insufficient time left in the season to hold discussions.

The dispute officially ended after the two groups reached consensus on September 23, 2004. As part of the agreement, the Buffaloes were allowed to merge with the Blue Wave (forming into the Orix Buffaloes); in addition, the Rakuten Golden Eagles were newly created (at a reduced &quot;entry fee&quot;) to keep the former six-team league structure. Other agreements included the leagues adopting interleague play to help the Pacific League gain exposure by playing the more popular Central league teams. All these changes took place before the 2005 season.

===Interleague play===

The two leagues began interleague play in 2005, with each team playing two three-game series (one home, one away) against each of the six teams in the other league. This was reduced to two two-game series in 2007. All interleague play games are played in a seven-week span near the middle of the season.

As of the end of the 2017 season, the Pacific League has won the most games in interleague play since it began in 2005 twelve times, with 2009 being the only time that the Central League has won more games.

===League championship series/Climax Series===

After 2004, a three-team playoff system was introduced in the Pacific League, dubbed the &quot;Pacific League Championship Series&quot;. The teams with the second- and third-best records play in the three-game first stage, with the winner advancing to the five-game final against the top team. The winner becomes the representative of the Pacific League to the Japan Series.

Since the Pacific League won every Japan Series after introducing this league playoff system, an identical system was introduced to the Central League in 2007, and the post-season intra-league games were renamed the &quot;Climax Series&quot; in both leagues. Player statistics and drafting order based on team records are not affected by these postseason games.

===Recent history===
In 2011, Miyagi Baseball Stadium, home of the Rakuten Eagles, was badly damaged by the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami.

The 2013 season featured a livelier baseball, which was secretly introduced into NPB, resulting in a marked increase in home runs league-wide. Tokyo Yakult Swallows outfielder Wladimir Balentien broke the NPB single-season home run record of 55, previously held by professional baseball&#x27;s all-time home run leader Sadaharu Oh in 1964, Tuffy Rhodes in 2001, and Alex Cabrera in 2002. Balantien finished the season with 60 home runs. Three-term NPB commissioner Ryōzō Katō was forced to resign over the scandal when the changed baseball was revealed.

Former Prime Minister Shinzō Abe&#x27;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party has proposed expanding NPB to 16 total teams by adding two expansion franchises in each of the country&#x27;s top-tier professional baseball leagues. The goal of such a move would be to energize the economies of the regions receiving the new teams. Okinawa, Shizuoka, Shikoku, and Niigata have been identified as regions that could play host to said teams.

The 2020 NPB season was delayed numerous times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially preseason games were set to be played without spectators, but with opening day of March 20 remaining unchanged. With the lifting of states of emergency over major Japanese cities, NPB announced that it would begin its regular season on 19 June behind closed doors. &quot;Warm-up&quot; games began 26 May. The shortened 120-game regular season began on 19 June. On 10 July, NPB began allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, with plans to further ease restrictions in the near future. On 19 September, attendance was expanded to a maximum of 20,000 fans per game, or 50% of stadium capacity.

==Expatriate baseball players in Japan==

For most of its history, NPB regulations imposed &quot;gaijin waku&quot;, a limit on the number of non-Japanese people per team to two or three—including the manager and/or coaching staff. Even today, a team cannot have more than four foreign players on a 25-man game roster, although there is no limit on the number of foreign players that it may sign. If there are four, they cannot all be pitchers nor all be position players. This limits the cost and competition for expensive players of other nationalities, and is similar to rules in many European sports leagues&#x27; roster limits on non-European players.

Nonetheless, expatriate baseball players in Japan have been a feature of the Japanese professional leagues since 1934. Hundreds of foreigners—particularly Americans—have played NPB. Taiwanese nationals Shosei Go and Hiroshi Oshita both starred in the 1940s. American players began to steadily find spots on NPB rosters in the 1960s. American players hold several NPB records, including highest single-season batting average (Randy Bass, .389), and the dubious record of most strikeouts in a season by a hitter (Ralph Bryant, 204). Americans rank #4 (Tuffy Rhodes, 55) and #7 (Randy Bass, 54) on the list of most home runs in a season, and #2 in single-season RBI (Bobby Rose, 153). Curaçaoan–Dutch outfielder Wladimir Balentien holds the NPB single-season home run record with 60 round-trippers in 2013.

Koreans have had an impact in the NPB as well, including such standout players as Lee Seung-yuop, Sun Dong-yol, Baek In-chun, Lee Jong-beom, and Dae-ho Lee. Venezuelans Alex Ramírez, Alex Cabrera, Bobby Marcano, and Roberto Petagine all had long, successful NPB careers. The Dominican third baseman José Fernández played eleven years in the NPB, compiling a .282 batting average with 206 home runs and 772 runs batted in.

Many of the most celebrated foreign players came to Japan after not finding success in the Major Leagues; see &quot;Big in Japan&quot;.

Since the 1970s, foreigners have also made an impact in Nippon Professional Baseball&#x27;s managing and coaching ranks, with Americans Bobby Valentine and Trey Hillman managing their respective teams to Japan Series championships.

==International play==
The Japan national baseball team, long composed of amateur players, began to include NPB players in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and has been composed of NPB players only since the 2004 Athens Olympics. As of 2023, the Japan national baseball team composed of NPB players had won three World Baseball Classics, one WBSC Premier 12, and one Olympic Games, and was ranked No. 1 in the WBSC World Rankings.

Since 1986 an All-Star team from Major League Baseball (MLB) is sent to a biennial end-of-the-season tour of Japan, dubbed as MLB Japan All-Star Series, playing exhibition games in a best-of format against the All-Stars from NPB or recently as of 2014 the national team Samurai Japan.

The 2014 series also celebrated the 80th anniversary of the establishment of Japan&#x27;s professional baseball by holding an exhibition game of a joint team of Hanshin Tigers and Yomiuri Giants against the MLB All-Stars at the Koshien Stadium on November 11, 2014.

<text>is a traditional Japanese rite of passage and festival day for three and seven-year-old girls, and five-year-old and sometimes three-year-old boys. It is held annually on November 15 and celebrates the growth and well-being of young children. As it is not a national holiday, it is generally observed on the nearest weekend.

==History==

 is said to have originated in the Heian period amongst court nobles who would celebrate the passage of their children into middle childhood, but it is also suggested that the idea was originated from the Muromachi period due to high infant mortality. The ages 3, 5 and 7 are consistent with East Asian numerology, which holds that odd numbers are lucky. The practice was set to the fifteenth of the month during the Kamakura period.

Its meaning is to celebrate the survival of children, as infant and child mortality rates were higher in previous centuries.

Over time, this tradition passed to the samurai class who added a number of rituals.

The first of these ceremonies, for three year-olds, is called , meaning &quot;hair-leaving&quot;; traditionally, from the period of seven days after birth until the age of three, a child&#x27;s head would be kept shaved.

The second of these ceremonies, for five year-old boys, is called . Similar to the Western practice of breeching, this marked the first time a young boy would wear formal attire (a and a ), associated with roles and responsibilities.

The third ceremony is , which is held for seven year-old girls. This ceremony marked the first time a young girl would wear an (a broad, stiff sash for a kimono) instead of simply wearing a kimono tied with attached strings or a lightweight, informal and scarf-like sash. Symbolizing the transition into womanhood, this practice began in the Kamakura period; originally, it was practiced for 9 year-old girls as well as boys, but in the Edo period transitioned into being performed for girls aged 7 only.

By the Meiji period, the practice of was adopted amongst commoners as well, and included the modern ritual of visiting a shrine to drive out evil spirits and wish for a long healthy life.

==Current practice==
 has changed little since the Meiji period. While the ritual regarding hair has been discarded, boys who are aged five and girls who are aged three or seven are still dressed in kimono—many for the first time—for visits to shrines. Three-year-old girls usually wear (a type of padded vest) with their kimono. Western-style formal wear is also worn by some children. A more modern practice is photography, and this day is well known as a day to take pictures of children. It is common to observe the rite based on the traditional way of calculating age, or , in which children are one year old at birth and gain a year on each New Year&#x27;s Day. In this case, girls celebrate in the year in which they would reach an age according to the modern calculation of two or six, and boys in the year in which they would reach an age according to the modern calculation of four.

<doc id="147796" wikidata="Q13393" url="?curid=147796" title="Onigiri">
<text>, also known as or , is a Japanese rice ball made from white rice. It is usually formed into triangular or cylindrical shapes, and wrapped in &quot;nori&quot; (seaweed). Onigiri traditionally have sour or salty fillings such as &quot;umeboshi&quot; (pickled Chinese plum), salted salmon, &quot;katsuobushi&quot; (smoked and fermented bonito), kombu, &quot;tarako&quot; or &quot;mentaiko&quot; (pollock roe), or &quot;takanazuke&quot; (pickled Japanese giant red mustard greens). Because it is easily portable and eaten by hand, onigiri has been used as portable food or bento from ancient times to the present day. Originally, it was used as a way to use and store left-over rice, but it later became a regular meal. Many Japanese convenience stores and supermarkets stock onigiri with various fillings and flavors. It has become so mainstream that it is even served in izakayas and sit-down restaurants. There are even specialized shops which only sell onigiri to take out. Due to the popularity of this trend in Japan, onigiri has become a popular staple in Japanese restaurants worldwide.

Onigiri is not a form of sushi and should not be confused with the type of sushi called &quot;nigirizushi&quot; or simply &quot;nigiri&quot;. Onigiri is made with plain rice (sometimes lightly salted), while sushi is made of rice with vinegar, sugar and salt. Onigiri makes rice portable and easy to eat as well as preserving it, while sushi originated as a way of preserving fish.

==History==

=== Prehistoric ===
On November 12, 1987, lumps of carbonized grains of rice, thought to be riceballs, were excavated from a building belonging to the Yayoi period (2000 years ago) in the Sugitani Chanobatake Ruins in Ishikawa Prefecture. The carbonized rice had traces which revealed that it was formed by human hands, thus it was initially documented as &quot;the oldest onigiri.&quot; In subsequent research, it was thought to be steamed and grilled, rather than boiled like today&#x27;s rice, similar to another dish called &quot;chimaki&quot;. Since then, it has been academically called the &quot;chimaki-shaped carbonized rice lumps (チマキ状炭化米塊)&quot;.

In Nakanoto, there is a replica of the relic on display at the roadside station Orihime-no-sato Nakanoto.

=== Pre-modern ===

Before the use of chopsticks became widespread, in the Nara period, rice was often rolled into a small ball so that it could be easily picked up. In the Heian period, rice was made into small rectangular shapes known as &quot;&quot; so that they could be piled onto a plate and easily eaten. At that time, onigiri were called &quot;tonjiki&quot; and often consumed at outdoor picnic lunches.

The first incarnation of the word &quot;onigiri&quot; is attested in the &quot;Hitachi no Kuni Fudoki&quot; (&quot;Hitachi Province Gazette&quot;), dated to 721 AD. In it, the word used is &quot;nigiri-ihi&quot; (握飯) or &quot;crumpled rice&quot;:

In Murasaki Shikibu&#x27;s 11th-century diary &quot;Murasaki Shikibu Nikki&quot;, she writes of people eating &quot;tonjiki&quot; rice balls. Other writings, dating back as far as the seventeenth century, state that many samurai stored rice balls wrapped in bamboo sheath as a quick lunchtime meal during war.

From the Kamakura period to the early Edo period, onigiri was used as a quick meal. This made sense as cooks simply had to think about making enough onigiri and did not have to concern themselves with serving. These onigiri were simply balls of rice flavored with salt. Nori did not become widely available until the Genroku era (1688–1704) of the mid-Edo period, when the farming of nori and fashioning it into sheets became widespread.

=== Modern ===

In the 1980s, a machine to make triangular onigiri was invented. Rather than rolling the filling inside, the flavoring was put into a hole in the onigiri and the hole was hidden by nori. Since the onigiri made by this machine came with nori already applied to the rice ball, over time the nori became moist and sticky, clinging to the rice.

A packaging improvement allowed the nori to be stored separately from the rice. Before eating, the diner could open the packet of nori and wrap the onigiri. The use of a hole for filling the onigiri made new flavors of onigiri easier to produce as this cooking process did not require changes from ingredient to ingredient. Modern mechanically wrapped onigiri are specially folded so that the plastic wrapping is between the nori and rice to act as a moisture barrier. When the packaging is pulled open at both ends, the nori and rice come into contact and are eaten together. This packaging is commonly found for both triangular onigiri and rolls (細巻き).

==Rice and shapes ==

Usually, onigiri is made with boiled white rice, though it is sometimes made with different varieties of cooked rice, such as:

* &quot;Okowa&quot; or &quot;kowa-meshi&quot;: glutinous rice cooked or steamed with vegetables 
* &quot;Sekihan&quot;: rice cooked with red azuki beans
* &quot;Maze-gohan&quot;: rice cooked with various preferred ingredients
* Fried rice
* Brown rice

The rice may be seasoned with salt, sesame, &quot;furikake&quot;, dried shiso flakes, and so on. Onigiri are typically triangular, but can come in many shapes, including round, cylindrical, rectangular, etc.

==Fillings==


Umeboshi, okaka, or tsukudani have long been frequently used as fillings for onigiri. Generally, onigiri made with pre-seasoned rice is not filled with ingredients. Plain (salt only) onigiri is called &quot;shio-musubi&quot;.

Typical fillings are listed below:
* Dressed dishes: tuna with mayonnaise (シーチキン), shrimp with mayonnaise, negitoro (ネギトロ), etc.
* Dried fish: roasted and crumbled mackerel (鯖), Japanese horse mackerel (鰺), etc.
* Dried food: katsuobushi, etc.
* Fish roe: mentaiko (明太子), tarako (たらこ), tobiko (とびこ), etc.
* Shiokara: squid, shuto, etc.
* Meats: kakuni, dongpo pork, char siu
* Tsukudani: nori, Hypoptychus dybowskii (小女子), Venerupis philippinarum (浅蜊), etc.
* Pickled fruits and vegetables: umeboshi, takana, nozawana, etc.
* Tenkasu: deep fried bits of batter

==Variants==
=== Yaki-onigiri ===

&quot;Yaki-onigiri&quot; (焼きおにぎり &quot;grilled onigiri&quot;) are first shaped by compacting white rice, then grilling it until brown, then coating with soy sauce or miso, and finally broiling it. Yaki-onigiri is also sold commercially as frozen food.

&quot;Miso-onigiri&quot; () is mainly in eastern Japan. Miso is used as fillings, sometimes mixed with green onion, or spread over and roasted as a variant of yaki-onigiri.

=== Age-onigiri ===
&quot;Age-onigiri&quot; (揚げおにぎり &quot;fried onigiri&quot;) are first shaped by compacting white rice, then frying it in a frying pan or wok using cooking oil until it is golden brown. Because of the oil, the flavor is richer than yaki-onigiri. If eating it as is, it can be seasoned with soy sauce, miso, or salt.

To eat it in a soup, first place it in a bowl. Add condiments such as chives, &quot;miyakogusa&quot;, wasabi, grated ginger, nori, umeboshi plum, and pour hot Japanese-style soup stock. Eat while breaking up the onigiri that have absorbed the soup stock.

There are several variations of the age-onigiri. For example, there is a version where the rice being fried has Japanese flavoring, such as &quot;takikomi gohan&quot;. There is also a Western style variation where melted cheese is used as the filling, the rice is deep-fried with western ingredients such as ketchup and curry, and the onigiri is topped with a western-style soup.

=== Bakudan-onigiri ===
&quot;Bakudan-onigiri&quot; (爆弾おにぎり &quot;bomb-shaped onigiri&quot;) are large, spherical rice balls wrapped entirely in &quot;nori&quot;, so that no rice is exposed. Like other onigiri, they are usually filled with dried fish and &quot;umeboshi&quot; plums. Bakudan-onigiri are known to be simple to make and easy to hold without getting the hands sticky.

=== Pork tamago-onigiri ===
Pork &quot;tamago-onigiri&quot; (ポーク玉子おにぎり &quot;pork egg onigiri&quot;) or &quot;onipō&quot; (おにポー) for short, is a variation from Okinawa Prefecture which combines rice, seaweed, pork, and eggs. It is similar to &quot;onigirazu&quot; (rice and lunch meat in sandwich form).

=== Other ===
* &quot;Tenmusu&quot; (): rice balls containing fried tempura. Originally from Tsu, Mie, and is well known in Nagoya cuisine.
* &quot;Samgak-gimbap&quot; () — Literally &quot;triangle gimbap&quot;. It originates from Japanese onigiri and is sold in convenience stores in South Korea. Fillings vary greatly; the expiration date is one day; it typically provides between of food energy.

== Trivia ==
* Onigiri has its own Unicode emoji: 🍙 (U+1F359)

== See also ==

* Arancinian Italian dish of fried, breadcrumb-coated rice balls, with various fillings
* CifantuanShanghainese rice balls, commonly eaten for breakfast
* Jumeokbapa Korean dish of Japanese onigiri-styled rice balls, with various fillings

<text>NHK World-Japan (formerly and also known simply as NHK World) is the international arm of the Japanese public broadcaster NHK. Its services are aimed at the overseas market, similar to those offered by other national public-service broadcasters, such as the British BBC (BBC World Service, the international feed of the BBC News channel, etc.), France 24, or the German DW. Contents are broadcast through shortwave radio, satellite, and cable operators throughout the world, as well as online and through its mobile apps. It is headquartered in Tokyo.

NHK World-Japan currently provides three main broadcast services: an English-language current affairs TV channel (NHK World TV), a multilingual radio service (NHK World Radio Japan), and a Japanese-language general/entertainment TV service (NHK World Premium). NHK World-Japan also makes most of its programming available through its website (either live or on demand). A Chinese version of the channel, NHK Huayu Shijie (NHK华语视界), which essentially provides news and select programs from NHK World-Japan with Mandarin dubbing and/or subtitles, was launched on January 15, 2019, and is only distributed online.

He was born Minoru Ōno (大野 穣), in Shiriuchi, Hokkaidō, to a fisherman. He was very poor due to the effects of World War II, and was forced to work while he studied.

==Music career==

When he was about to graduate from high school, he decided to become a singer. His debut single was called &quot;Bungacha-Bushi,&quot; which was released in 1962.

He has many famous songs, including &quot;Namida Bune&quot; (1962), &quot;Kyōdai Jingi&quot; (1965), &quot;Yosaku&quot; (1978) and &quot;Kita no Ryōba&quot; (1986). His 1965 song &quot;Kaerokana&quot; was written by lyricist Rokusuke Ei and composer Hachidai Nakamura. He is very popular in Japan partly due to his looks of a physical laborer, and he mostly sings in the spirit of Japan&#x27;s working class and rural laborers.

Kitajima regularly appeared on &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;, an annual end-of-year TV program where many major Japanese singers gather to perform, before announcing his retirement from the show in 2013. He participated a record 50 times, was the &quot;anchor&quot; (final solo performer) 13 times and led the grand finale 11 times. His participation included the infamous DJ Ozma performance at the &quot;57th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot;. He returned at the &quot;69th NHK Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; in 2018 for a special performance.

Kitajima released single on January 1, 2010 at the age of 73. It debuted at No. 10 on the Japanese Oricon weekly single charts. It became the first single to reach Top 10 by a solo artist in his 70s in Oricon charts history.

He does a lot of concerts overseas and is contributing a lot of work to the culture of Japanese music. 

==Other activities==
In addition to his singing career, Kitajima acted in the role of Tatsugorō on the television series &quot;Abarenbō Shōgun&quot;. During the quarter-century life of the series, he also sang its theme songs. He is also a successful owner of Thoroughbred racehorses including Kitasan Black.

<doc id="147800" wikidata="Q4346753" url="?curid=147800" title="Hiyayakko">
<text>is a Japanese dish made with chilled tofu and toppings.

== Variety of toppings ==

The choice of toppings on the tofu vary among households and restaurants, but a standard combination is chopped green onion with katsuobushi (dried skipjack tuna flakes) and soy sauce. Other toppings include:
* perilla leaf
* &quot;yuzu&quot; rind
* daikon radish
* sliced myoga ginger
* grated ginger
* sliced okra
* plum paste

== History and background ==

&quot;Hiyayakko&quot; is also known as &quot;hiyakko&quot; or &quot;yakko-dōfu&quot;. &quot;Hiya&quot; means cold, and &quot;yakko&quot; refers to the servants of samurai during the Edo period in Japan. They wore a vest on which the &quot;nail-puller crest&quot; was attached, on the shoulders; therefore, cutting something (e.g. tofu) into cubes was called . &quot;&quot;Hiyakkoi&quot; or &quot;hyakkoi&quot;&quot;, the Tokyo dialectal term equivalent to the standard Japanese , is also a possible etymology.

In the 1782 recipe book &quot;Tofu Hyakuchin&quot;, it is said that &quot;hiyayakko&quot; is so well known that it needs no introduction.

In haiku, &quot;hiyayakko&quot; is a season word for summer. This is because tofu is often enjoyed cold in the summer, warm and boiled in a broth in the winter.

<doc id="147804" wikidata="Q328709" url="?curid=147804" title="Tempura">
<text>is a typical Japanese dish that usually consists of seafood and vegetables that have been coated in a thin batter and deep-fried. Tempura originated in the 16th century, when Portuguese Jesuits brought the Western-style cooking method of coating foods with flour and frying, via Nanban trade.

==Preparation==

===Batter===
A light batter is made of iced water, eggs, and soft wheat flour (cake, pastry or all-purpose flour). Sometimes baking soda or baking powder is added to make the batter light. Using sparkling water in place of plain water has a similar effect. Tempura batter is traditionally mixed in small batches using chopsticks for only a few seconds, leaving lumps in the mixture that, along with the cold batter temperature, result in a unique fluffy and crisp tempura structure when cooked. The batter is often kept cold by adding ice or placing the bowl inside a larger bowl with ice. Overmixing the batter will activate wheat gluten, which causes the flour mixture to become soft and dough-like when fried.

Specially formulated tempura flour is available in supermarkets. This is generally light (low-gluten) flour and occasionally contains leaveners such as baking powder.
Tempura does not use breadcrumbs (panko) in the coating. Deep-fried foods that are coated with breadcrumbs are called &quot;furai&quot;, Japanese-invented Western-style deep-fried foods, such as &quot;tonkatsu&quot; or &quot;ebi furai&quot; (fried prawn).

No seasonings or salt are added to the batter, or the ingredients, except for some recipes recommending rinsing seafood in salt water before preparation.

===Frying===
Thin slices or strips of vegetables or seafood are dipped in the batter, then briefly deep-fried in hot oil. Vegetable oil or canola oil are most common; however, tempura was traditionally cooked using sesame oil. Many specialty shops still use sesame oil or tea seed oil, and it is thought certain compounds in these oils help to produce light, crispier batter.

The finished fry is pale whiteish, thin and fluffy, yet crunchy.

The bits of batter (known as &quot;tenkasu&quot;) are scooped out between batches of tempura so they do not burn and leave a bad flavor in the oil. A small mesh scoop (&quot;ami jakushi&quot;) is used for this purpose. &quot;Tenkasu&quot; are often reserved as ingredients in other dishes or as a topping.

===Ingredients===
Various seafood and vegetables are commonly used as the ingredients in traditional tempura.

====Seafood====

Types of seafood used in tempura include:

* prawn – &quot;ebi tempura&quot;
* shrimp
* squid
* scallop
* crab
* &quot;ayu&quot; (sweetfish)
* &quot;anago&quot; (conger eel)
* fish
* catfish
* white fish
* cod
* haddock
* pollock
* coley
* plaice
* skate
* ray
* Huss (Various fish species including &quot;Galeorhinus&quot;, &quot;Mustelus&quot;, &quot;Scyliorhinus&quot;, &quot;Galeus melastomus&quot;, &quot;Squalus acanthias&quot; – also known as spiny dogfish or &quot;rock salmon&quot;)
* rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish)
* whiting
* Japanese whiting – &quot;kisu&quot;
* sea bass
* sea perch
====Vegetables====


Vegetable tempura is called &quot;yasai tempura&quot;. All-vegetable tempura may be served as a vegetarian dish. Types of vegetables include:

* bamboo shoots
* bell pepper
* broccoli
* butternut squash
* carrot
* maize
* eggplant
* &quot;gobo&quot; (burdock, &quot;Arctium lappa&quot;)

====Others====
* egg

===Serving and presentation===

Cooked pieces of tempura are either eaten with dipping sauce, salted without sauce, or used to assemble other dishes. Tempura is commonly served with grated daikon and eaten hot immediately after frying. In Japan, it is often found in bowls of soba or udon soup in the form of shrimp, shiso leaf, or fritter. The most common sauce is tentsuyu sauce (roughly three parts &quot;dashi&quot;, one part &quot;mirin&quot;, and one part &quot;shōyu&quot;). Alternatively, skim tempura may be sprinkled with sea salt before eating. Mixtures of powdered green tea and salt or &quot;yuzu&quot; and salt are also used.
&quot;&quot; is a type of tempura made with mixed vegetable strips, such as onion, carrot, and burdock, and sometimes including shrimp or squid, which are deep fried as small round fritters.

Tempura is also used in combination with other foods. When served over &quot;soba&quot; (buckwheat noodles), it is called &quot;tempura soba&quot; or &quot;tensoba&quot;. Tempura is also served as a &quot;donburi&quot; dish where tempura shrimp and vegetables are served over steamed rice in a bowl (&quot;tendon&quot;) and on top of &quot;udon&quot; soup (&quot;tempura udon&quot;).

==History==

===Origins===
Earlier Japanese deep-fried food was either simply fried without breading or batter or fried with rice flour. However, toward the end of the 16th century, the technique of fritter-cooking with a batter of flour and eggs was acquired in Nagasaki by Portuguese missionaries. Peixinhos da horta was a dish often eaten during Lent or Ember days to fulfill the fasting and abstinence rules for Catholics. The word &quot;tempura&quot; originates from the Latin word &quot;tempora&quot;, a term referring to these fasting times (Spanish: &quot;Témporas&quot;). In those days, the ingredients were covered in thick batter containing flour, sugar and sake, and then fried in lard. As the batter already contained seasoning, it was eaten without dipping sauce.

In the early 17th century, around the Tokyo Bay area, tempura ingredients and preparation changed as the &quot;yatai&quot; (food cart) culture gained popularity. Making the best use of fresh seafood while preserving its delicate taste, tempura used only flour, eggs, and water as ingredients, and the batter was not flavored. As the batter was mixed minimally in cold water, it avoided the dough-like stickiness caused by the activation of wheat gluten, resulting in the crispy texture now characteristic of tempura. It became customary to dip tempura quickly in a sauce mixed with grated daikon just before eating it.

Today in Japan, mainstream tempura recipes originate from &quot;Tokyo-style&quot; (also known as “Edo-style“) tempura, invented at the food stalls along the riverside fish market in the Edo period. Tempura became popular largely due to the abundance of seafood. In addition, as oil extraction techniques advanced, cooking oil became cheaper. Serving deep-fried food indoors was prohibited during Edo because tempura oil was a fire hazard in Japanese buildings, which were made of paper and wood. Therefore, tempura gained popularity as fast food eaten at outdoor food stalls. It was skewered and eaten with a dipping sauce. Tempura is considered one of &quot;the Edo Delicacies&quot; along with soba (buckwheat noodles) and sushi, which were also food stall take-outs.

The modern tempura recipe was first published in 1671 in the cookbook called &quot;料理献立抄&quot;. After the Meiji period, tempura was no longer considered a fast-food item but developed as a high-class cuisine.

===Etymology===

The word &quot;tempura&quot;, or the technique of dipping fish and vegetables into a batter and frying them, comes from the word , a Latin word meaning &quot;times&quot;, &quot;time period&quot; used by both Spanish and Portuguese missionaries to refer to the Lenten period or Ember Days (&quot;ad tempora quadragesima&quot;), Fridays, and other Christian holy days. Ember Days, or &#x27; in Latin, refer to holy days when Catholics avoid meat and eat fish or vegetables instead. The idea that the word &quot;tempura&quot; may have been derived from the Portuguese noun &#x27;, meaning a condiment or seasoning of any kind, or from the verb &#x27;, meaning &quot;to season&quot; is also possible as the Japanese language could easily have assumed the word &#x27; as is, without changing any vowels as the Portuguese pronunciation, in this case, is similar to the Japanese. There is still today a dish in Portugal very similar to tempura called &quot;peixinhos da horta&quot;, &quot;garden fishes&quot;, which consists of green beans dipped in a batter and fried.

The term &quot;tempura&quot; is thought to have gained popularity in southern Japan; it became widely used to refer to any food prepared using hot oil, including some already existing Japanese foods. Today, particularly in western Japan, the word &quot;tempura&quot; is also commonly used to refer to &quot;satsuma-age&quot;, fried surimi fish cake which is made without batter.

==Variations==

===Japan===
In Japan, restaurants specializing in tempura are called &quot;tenpura-ya&quot;. Many restaurants offer tempura as part of a set meal or a &quot;bento&quot; (lunch box), and it is also a popular ingredient in take-out or convenience store &quot;bento&quot; boxes. The ingredients and styles of cooking and serving tempura vary greatly throughout the country, with importance placed on using fresh, seasonal ingredients.

Outside Japan (as well as recently in Japan), there are many nontraditional and fusion uses of tempura. Chefs all over the world include tempura dishes on their menus, and a wide variety of different batters and ingredients are used, including nontraditional broccoli, zucchini, asparagus and chuchu. More unusual ingredients may include nori slices, dry fruit such as bananas, and ice cream (&quot;tempura&quot;-based fried ice cream). American restaurants are known to serve tempura in the form of various types of meat, particularly chicken and cheeses, usually mozzarella. A variation is to use panko (breadcrumbs), which results in a crisper consistency than tempura batter, although in Japan this would be classified as a &quot;furai&quot; dish. Tempura (particularly shrimp) is often used as a filling in &quot;makizushi&quot;. A more recent variation of tempura sushi has entire pieces of sushi dipped in batter and tempura-fried.

In Bangladesh, the blossoms of pumpkins or marrows are often deep-fried with a gram of rice flour spice mix, creating a Bengali-style tempura known as kumro ful bhaja.

====Taiwan====
In Taiwan, tempura, as described in the preceding, is known as &quot;tiānfùluó&quot; () and can commonly be found on the menu in Japanese restaurants all over the island. A similar-sounding dish, &quot;tianbula&quot; () is usually sold at night markets. Tianbula is Japanese satsuma-age and was introduced to Taiwan under Japanese rule by people from Kyushu, where satsuma-age is commonly known as &quot;tempura&quot;.

<doc id="147805" wikidata="Q862557" url="?curid=147805" title="Osechi">
<text> (御節料理, お節料理 or おせち) are traditional Japanese New Year foods. are easily recognizable by their special boxes called &quot;jūbako&quot; (重箱), which resemble &quot;bentō&quot; boxes. Like &quot;bentō&quot; boxes, &quot;jūbako&quot; are often kept stacked before and after use. However not all parts of Japan, such as Suzu in Ishikawa, practice the custom of eating &quot;osechi&quot;.

Osechi is a food eaten to wish the family good health for the year, and the various dishes that make up osechi have their own roles to bring good luck in terms of longevity, prosperity of descendants, bountiful harvest, success in life, and financial success.

Originally, osechi was rice served high in a bowl to celebrate the five annual ceremonies (&quot;gosekku&quot;) from the Nara (610-794) to Kamakura periods (1185-1333). Osechi is influenced by the ritual of &quot;naorai&quot; (also known as &quot;kyōshoku&quot;), in which a person who prays eats with the Shinto &quot;kami&quot;. The old custom of offering osechi to the &quot;toshigami&quot; (Shinto deity) on the &quot;kamidana&quot; (household Shinto altar) before eating it with the family is a remnant of this ceremony.

Osechi changed greatly under the influence of &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot;, a banquet dish that was ritualized in &quot;daimyo&quot; (feudal lords) and the samurai society during the Muromachi period (1336-1573). Many of the standard dishes that make up osechi today are derived from honzen-ryōri. 

During the Edo period (1603-1868), osechi came to refer only to New Year&#x27;s dishes. With the economic development of Japanese society, the custom of osechi spread to the general public, the &quot;chōnin&quot; class, and a new custom began. From the late Edo period, some of the dishes in osechi began to be packed in &quot;jūbako&quot;, and from the Meiji era (1868-1912) to the Showa era (1912-1989), the variety of dishes packed in &quot;jūbako&quot; increased, becoming a luxurious dish sold in department stores.

==Examples of osechi dishes==
The dishes that make up &quot;osechi&quot; each have a special meaning celebrating the New Year. Some examples are:
*&quot;Daidai&quot; (橙, だいだい), Japanese bitter orange. &quot;Daidai&quot; means &quot;from generation to generation&quot; when written in different kanji as 代々. Like &quot;kazunoko&quot; below, it symbolizes a wish for children in the New Year.
*&quot;&quot; (伊達巻 or 伊達巻き or だてまき), sweet rolled omelette mixed with fish paste or mashed shrimp. They symbolize a wish for many auspicious days. On auspicious days (晴れの日, &quot;hare-no-hi&quot;), Japanese people traditionally wear fine clothing as a part of enjoying themselves. One of the meanings associated with the second kanji includes &quot;fashionability&quot;, derived from the illustrious dress of the samurai from Date Han.
*&quot;Kamaboko&quot; (蒲鉾, かまぼこ), broiled fish cake. Traditionally, slices of red and white &quot;kamaboko&quot; are alternated in rows or arranged in a pattern. The color and shape are reminiscent of Japan rising sun, and have a celebratory, festive meaning.
*&quot;Kazunoko&quot; (数の子, かずのこ), herring roe. &quot;Kazu&quot; means &quot;number&quot; and &quot;ko&quot; means &quot;child&quot;. It symbolizes a wish to be gifted with numerous children in the New Year.
*&quot;Konbu&quot; (昆布), a kind of seaweed. It is considered to sound like the word &quot;yorokobu&quot;, meaning &quot;joy&quot;.
*&quot;&quot; (黒豆, くろまめ), black soybeans. &quot;Mame&quot; also means &quot;health&quot;, symbolizing a wish for health in the New Year.

==History==
The term &quot;osechi&quot; is derived from the term &quot;o-setchiku&quot; (御節供), which originally referred to annual imperial court events and the food served at these events. New Year&#x27;s Day was one of the five annual ceremonies (&quot;gosekku&quot;) in the Imperial Court in Kyoto. This custom of celebrating particular days was introduced from China into Japan. 

The osechi of the Nara (710–794) and Heian periods (794–1185) were quite different from those of today. Osechi of those periods consisted of rice served high in bowls that the emperor served to court officials on the five annual ceremonies of the year. The officials would ceremonially eat a small portion of the rice at court and then take it home to eat with their families. Osechi is believed to have been influenced by the Shinto ritual of &quot;naorai&quot; (&quot;kyōshoku&quot;). &quot;Naorai&quot; is a ritual of eating with the &quot;kami&quot; in order to offer prayers to them. Examples of this ritual are the emperor&#x27;s enthronement ceremony, &quot;Daijōsai&quot;, and the old custom of eating osechi after offering it to the altar of the &quot;kamidana&quot; (household Shinto altar).

Even after the samurai class came to power in the Kamakura period (1185-1333), osechi consisted of rice served high in bowls.

Osechi changed greatly under the influence of &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot;, a banquet dish that was ritualized in &quot;daimyo&quot; (feudal lords) and the samurai society during the Muromachi period (1336-1573). Many of the standard dishes that make up osechi today are derived from &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot;. The three main foods known as &quot;iwaizakana&quot; (festive side dishes), such as &quot;kuromame&quot; (sugar-boiled black soybeans), &quot;tazukuri&quot; (dried
Japanese anchovy), and &quot;tataki gobo&quot; (burdock boiled in vinegar and soy sauce), which are essential to today&#x27;s osechi, were originally served as snacks with sake in &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot;. &quot;Kamaboko&quot;, &quot;datamaki&quot;, and &quot;kuri kinton&quot; (chestnuts &quot;wagashi&quot;), the staples of modern osechi, were also originally &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot;, and guests would take them home to eat after the banquet. During this period, carp was the most common fish dish for osechi.

During the Edo period (1603-1868), the term &quot;osechi&quot; came to refer only to New Year&#x27;s foods. During this period, Japan experienced dramatic economic development and merchants became wealthy, and osechi became part of the culture of the &quot;chōnin&quot; (townspeople) class from the Genroku era (1688-1704) onward, and &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot; became popular among the general public. Osechi came to include a variety of dishes seasoned mainly with salt. &quot;Pagrus major&quot; replaced carp as the most common fish dish. &quot;Zōni&quot; appeared in the Muromachi period (1336-1573) as a snack at wedding banquets of the upper samurai class and became a New Year&#x27;s dish for the common people during this period.

During this period, osechi consisted of two main components: &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot; (a main dish consisting of rice, fish, and &quot;nimono&quot; simmered dish) and , &quot;kuitsumi&quot; a New Year&#x27;s decoration. The &quot;kuitsumi&quot; consisted of rice placed on three sides of a white wooden stand decorated with &quot;mochi&quot;, abalone, &quot;kombu&quot;, chestnuts, persimmons, Japanese spiny lobster, mikan, pine, bamboo, and plum, etc. It was eaten on New Year&#x27;s Day with guests who came to greet the New Year, or pretended to be eaten as a ceremonial ritual.

In the late Edo period, osechi began to be placed in &quot;jūbako&quot; (tiered boxes) like today&#x27;s osechi. In the Kanto region, &quot;kurmame&quot;, &quot;kazunoko&quot; (eggs of the Pacific herring), and &quot;tazukuri&quot; were placed in stacked boxes, while in the Kansai region, &quot;kuromame&quot;, &quot;tazukuri&quot;, and &quot;tataki gobo&quot; were the three main ingredients of osechi.

During the Meiji era (1868-1912), various dishes that were originally &quot;honzen-ryōri&quot;, such as &quot;kamaboko&quot;, &quot;datamaki&quot;, &quot;kuri kinton&quot; and &quot;nimono&quot;, began to be placed in &quot;jūbako&quot;. With the modernization of Japanese society, women&#x27;s schools were established and osechi was taught as a dishs that housewives should master. The various regional styles of osechi that had existed until then were gradually standardized throughout the country.

With Japan&#x27;s rapid economic development after World War II, osechi became more luxurious and was sold in department stores, and some of the dishes began to incorporate &quot;yōshoku&quot; (Western-style foods).

<doc id="147806" wikidata="Q701075" url="?curid=147806" title="Okonomiyaki">
<text>is a Japanese teppanyaki savory pancake dish consisting of wheat flour batter and other ingredients (mixed, or as toppings) cooked on a &quot;teppan&quot; (flat griddle). Common additions include cabbage, meat, and seafood, and toppings include &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; sauce (made with Worcestershire sauce), &quot;aonori&quot; (dried seaweed flakes), &quot;katsuobushi&quot; (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger.

&quot;Okonomiyaki&quot; is mainly associated with two distinct variants from Hiroshima or the Kansai region of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country, with toppings and batters varying by area. The name is derived from the word , meaning &quot;how you like&quot; or &quot;what you like&quot;, and , meaning &quot;grilled&quot;. It is an example of ( in the Kansai dialect), or flour-based Japanese cuisine.

It is also called by an abbreviated name, &quot;okonomi&quot;, where the is a politeness prefix and means ‘favorite’.

A liquid-based &quot;okonomiyaki&quot;, popular in Tokyo, is called &quot;monjayaki&quot; (also written as ) and abbreviated as &quot;monja&quot;. Outside of Japan, it can also be found served in Manila, Taipei, Bangkok, and Jakarta by street vendors.

==History==
A thin crêpe-like confection called &quot;&quot; may be an early precursor to &quot;okonomiyaki&quot;. Records of the word appear as far back as the 16th century, as written about by tea master Sen no Rikyū, and though the dish&#x27;s ingredients are unclear, it may have included &quot;fu&quot; (wheat gluten). By the late Edo period (1603–1867), &quot;funoyaki&quot; referred to a thin crêpe baked on a cooking pot, with miso basted on one side. This confection is the ancestor of the modern confections , which is also called in Kyoto and Osaka, and &quot;taiko-yaki&quot; (also known as imagawayaki), which both use , a sweet bean paste.

In the Meiji era (1868–1912), , a related confection, was popular with children at , shops selling cheap sweets. This was made by drawing letters (&quot;monji&quot;) or pictures with flour batter on a &quot;teppan&quot; (iron griddle) and adding ingredients of choice. The confectionary was also called , from the onomatopoeia of the stall sellers beating drums to attract customers.

The first appearance of the word &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; was at a shop in Osaka in the 1930s. After the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake when people lacked amenities, it became a pastime to cook these crêpes, and after World War II (when there was a short supply of rice) &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; emerged as an inexpensive and filling dish for all ages, often with savory toppings, such as meat, seafood, and vegetables. This &quot;&quot;okonomiyaki&quot; boom&quot; saw household equipment and ingredients for the dish become commercially available. &quot;Monjiyaki&quot; also developed into the related modern dish , which has a more runny batter due to more added water, resulting in a different cooked consistency.

The &quot;&quot; (cheap Western-style cuisine) of Kyoto, which developed in the Taishō period (1912–1926), may have produced an early form of modern savory &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; in the form of a pancake with Worcestershire sauce and chopped scallion.

==Variations by region==

The dish is known for two distinct main variants, one in Kansai and Osaka and one in Hiroshima. Another variety is &quot;hirayachi&quot;, a thin and simple type made in Okinawa.

===Kansai area===
&quot;Okonomiyaki&quot; in the Kansai or Osaka style is the predominant version of the dish, found throughout most of Japan. The batter is made of flour, grated &quot;nagaimo&quot; (a long type of yam), &quot;dashi&quot; or water, eggs, shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (usually thinly sliced pork belly or American bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi, or cheese.

It is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and is sometimes referred to as a &quot;Japanese pizza&quot; or &quot;Osaka soul food&quot;. The dish can be prepared in advance, allowing customers to use a &quot;teppan&quot; or special hotplates to fry after mixing the ingredients. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers.

It is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on a teppan using metal spatulas that are later used to cut the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; is topped with ingredients that include &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; sauce (made with Worcestershire sauce), &quot;aonori&quot; (seaweed flakes), &quot;katsuobushi&quot; (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (&quot;beni shōga&quot;).

When served with a layer of fried noodles (either &quot;yakisoba&quot; or udon), the resulting dish is called , the name of which may be derived from the English word &quot;modern&quot; or as a contraction of , meaning &quot;a lot&quot; or &quot;piled high&quot; signifying the volume of food from having both noodles and &quot;okonomiyaki&quot;. is a thinner variation of &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; made with a great deal of scallions, comparable to Korean &quot;pajeon&quot; and Chinese green onion pancakes.

A variation called &quot;kashimin-yaki&quot; is made of chicken and tallow instead of pork in Kishiwada, Osaka. In Hamamatsu, takuan (pickled daikon) is mixed in okonomiyaki. Stewed sweet kintoki-mame is mixed in okonomiyaki in Tokushima Prefecture.

===Hiroshima area===

In the city of Hiroshima, there are over 2000 okonomiyaki restaurants, and the prefecture has more of those restaurants per capita than any other place in Japan. , a thin pancake topped with green onions and bonito flakes or shrimp, became popular in Hiroshima prior to World War II. After the atomic bombing of the city in August 1945, &quot;issen yōshoku&quot; became a cheap way for the surviving residents to have food to eat. Because the original ingredients were not always easy to obtain, many of the street vendors and shops began making it , using whatever ingredients were available.
The ingredients are layered rather than mixed. The layers are typically batter, cabbage, pork, and yakisoba. Optional items such as squid, octopus, dried bonito flakes, and other seafood, as well as nori flakes or powder, mung bean sprouts, egg, chicken, cheese, and other ingredients, depending on the preferences of the cook and the customer. Noodles (&quot;yakisoba&quot;, udon) are also used as a topping with fried egg and a generous amount of &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; sauce.

The amount of cabbage used is usually three to four times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts out piled very high and is pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef&#x27;s style and preference, and ingredients vary depending on the preference of the customer. This style is also called &quot;Hiroshima-yaki&quot; or &quot;Hiroshima-okonomi&quot;.

In and around the Hiroshima area, there are a number of variations on the style. is made with ground meat instead of pork belly in Fuchū, Hiroshima. Oysters (&quot;kaki&quot;) are mixed in okonomiyaki to make &quot;kaki-oko&quot; in Hinase, Okayama. On the island of Innoshima, a variety called (or for short) includes udon, bonito flakes, Worcestershire sauce, and vegetables fried with uncooked batter. Together with &quot;Onomichiyaki&quot;, in&#x27;oko is considered a B-class gourmet food along the Shimanami Kaidō. There is a restaurant in Hiroshima where customers can order jalapeños, tortilla chips, chorizo, and other Latin American items either in—or as a side dish to—okonomiyaki.

Otafuku, one of the most popular brands of okonomiyaki sauce, is based in Hiroshima and has an okonomiyaki museum and a cooking studio there. Okonomi-mura, in Naka-ku in Hiroshima, was the top food theme park destination for families in Japan according to an April 2004 poll.

===Okinawa===
&quot;Hirayachi&quot; ( &quot;hirayaachii&quot;) is a thin, very simple Okinawan pancake-like dish similar to buchimgae. It is basically &quot;a savory Okinawan crepe with leeks&quot;, and is sometimes called &quot;Okinawan style okonomiyaki&quot;. The name means &quot;fry flat&quot; in the Okinawan language.

People cook it at home, so there are few &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; restaurants in Okinawa, with none of them serving hirayachi. The ingredients consist of eggs, flour, salt, black pepper and green onions, fried with a little oil in a pan.

<text>The is an annual festival that takes place in Japan. Since 1873, the official Japanese New Year has been celebrated according to the Gregorian calendar, on January 1 of each year, . Prior to 1872, traditional events of the Japanese New Year were celebrated on the first day of the year on the modern Tenpō calendar, the last official lunisolar calendar.

==History==
Prior to the Meiji period, the date of the Japanese New Year had been based on Japanese versions of lunisolar calendar (the last of which was the Tenpō calendar) and, prior to Jōkyō calendar, the Chinese version. However, in 1873, five years after the Meiji Restoration, Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar and the first day of January became the official and cultural New Year&#x27;s Day in Japan.

==Traditional food==

The Japanese eat a selection of dishes during the New Year celebration called , typically shortened to &quot;osechi.&quot; Many of these dishes are sweet, sour, or dried, so they can be kept without refrigeration: the culinary traditions date to a time before households had refrigerators and when most stores closed for the holidays. There are many variations of &quot;osechi&quot;, and some foods eaten in one region are not eaten in other places (or are even considered inauspicious or banned) on New Year&#x27;s Day. Another popular dish is , a soup with &quot;mochi&quot; rice cake and other ingredients, which differ in various regions of Japan. It is also very common to eat buckwheat noodles called toshikoshi soba on ōmisoka (New Year&#x27;s Eve). Today, sashimi and sushi are often eaten, as well as non-Japanese foods. To let the overworked stomach rest, is prepared on the seventh day of January, a day known as .

==Mochi==

Another custom is to create and eat . Steamed is put into a wooden container and patted with water by one person while another person hits it with a large wooden mallet. Mashing the rice, it forms a sticky white dumpling. This is made before New Year&#x27;s Day and eaten during the beginning of January.

&quot;Mochi&quot; is made into a New Year&#x27;s decoration called , formed from two round cakes of mochi with a placed on top. The name &quot;daidai&quot; is supposed to be auspicious since it means &quot;several generations.&quot;

==Bell ringing==

At midnight on December 31, Buddhist temples all over Japan ring their bells a total of 108 times (Joya no Kane ) to symbolize the 108 earthly temptations in Buddhist belief, and to get rid of the 108 worldly desires regarding sense and feeling in every Japanese citizen. A major attraction is The Watched Night bell, in Tokyo. A traditional Japanese belief is that ringing bells can rid the sins of the passing year. The bell is rung 107 times on the 31st and once past midnight.

==Nenga==

The end of December and the beginning of January are the busiest for Japanese post offices. The Japanese have a custom of sending to their friends and relatives, similar to the Western custom of sending Christmas cards. The original purpose was to give faraway friends and relatives tidings of oneself and one&#x27;s immediate family— to tell those whom one did not often meet that he/she was alive and well.

Sending these greetings is timed so they will arrive on January 1. The post office guarantees delivery on that day if the cards are marked with the word &quot;nengajō&quot; and mailed between mid-December and a few days before year&#x27;s end. To deliver them on time, the post office usually hires students part-time.

It is customary to refrain from sending these postcards when there has been a death in the family during the year. In this case, a family member sends a simple to inform friends and relatives that they should not send New Year&#x27;s cards, out of respect for the deceased.

People get their &quot;nengajō&quot; from many sources. Stationers sell preprinted cards. Most of these have the Chinese zodiac sign of the New Year as their design, conventional greetings, or both. The Chinese zodiac has a cycle of 12 years. Each year is represented by an animal. The animals are, in order: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. 2020 was the year of the Rat and the most recent start of the cycle. Famous characters like Snoopy, (2006) and other cartoon characters like Mickey and Minnie Mouse, (2008) have been especially popular in their celebrated years.

Addressing is generally done by hand, and is an opportunity to demonstrate one&#x27;s handwriting (see &quot;shodō&quot;). The postcards may have spaces for the sender to write a personal message. Blank cards are available, so people can hand-write or draw their own. Rubber stamps with conventional messages and with the annual animal are for sale at department stores and other outlets, and many people buy ink brushes for personal greetings. Special printing devices are popular, especially among people who practice crafts. Computer software also lets artists create and print their own designs. Very social individuals, who have hundreds of cards to write, may go to print shops and choose from a wide variety of cards prepared with short messages, so the sender only has to address them. Despite the omnipresence of email, the &quot;nengajō&quot; remains very popular, although the younger generation sends hardly any cards. They prefer to exchange digital greetings via mobile phones, and in recent years the wider society gradually has come to accept digital greetings.

Conventional greetings include:

==&quot;Otoshidama&quot;==

On New Year&#x27;s Day, Japanese people have a custom known as &quot;&quot; where adult relatives give money to children. It is handed out in small decorated envelopes called &quot;pochibukuro&quot;, similar to Shūgi-bukuro or Chinese hóngbāo and to the Scottish handsel. In the Edo period, large stores and wealthy families would give out a small bag of mochi and a Mandarin orange to spread happiness all around. The amount of money given depends on the age of the child but is usually the same if there is more than one child so that no one feels slighted. It is not uncommon for amounts greater than ¥5,000 (approximately US$30) to be given.

==Poetry==
The New Year traditions are also a part of Japanese poetry, including haiku (poems with 17 syllables, in three lines of five, seven and five) and renga (linked poetry). All of the traditions above would be appropriate to include in haiku as &quot;kigo&quot; (season words). There are also haiku that celebrate many of the &quot;first&quot; of the New Year, such as the &quot;first sun&quot; (&quot;hatsuhi&quot;) or &quot;first sunrise&quot;, &quot;first laughter&quot; (&quot;waraizome&quot;—starting the New Year with a smile is considered a good sign), and first dream (&quot;hatsuyume&quot;). Since the traditional New Year was later in the year than the current date, many of these mention the beginning of spring.

Along with the New Year&#x27;s Day postcard, haiku might mention &quot;first letter&quot; (&quot;hatsudayori&quot;—meaning the first exchange of letters), &quot;first calligraphy&quot; (&quot;kakizome&quot;), and &quot;first brush&quot; (&quot;fude hajime&quot;).

== Takarabune ==

During the first three days of the New Year the Seven Lucky Gods are said to pilot through the heavens to human ports on the &quot;Takarabune&quot; or Treasure Ship. A picture of the ship forms an essential part of traditional Japanese New Year celebrations.

==Games==

It was also customary to play many New Year&#x27;s games. These include &quot;hanetsuki&quot;, &quot;takoage&quot; (kite flying), &quot;koma&quot; (spinning top), &quot;sugoroku&quot;, &quot;fukuwarai&quot; (whereby a blindfolded person places paper parts of a face, such as eyes, eyebrows, a nose and a mouth, on a paper face), and &quot;karuta&quot; (Japanese playing cards).

==Entertainment==
There are many shows created as the end-of-year, and beginning-of-year entertainment, and some being a special edition of the regular shows. For many decades, it has been customary to watch the TV show &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; aired on NHK on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The show features two teams, red and white, of popular music artists competing against each other.

== Sport ==
The final of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, the national association football elimination tournament in
New Year&#x27;s Day. The final has taken place on New Year&#x27;s Day since 1969 and is usually aired on NHK.

Mixed martial arts in Japan organizations such as Pride FC and Dream have held events on New Year&#x27;s Eve and Rizin Fighting Federation has held New Year&#x27;s Eve events since its founding in 2015.

==Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth==
Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, with accompanying chorus, is traditionally performed throughout Japan during the New Year&#x27;s season. In December 2009, for example, there were 55 performances of the symphony by various major orchestras and choirs in Japan.

The Ninth was introduced to Japan during World War I by German prisoners held at the Bandō prisoner-of-war camp.
Japanese orchestras, notably the NHK Symphony Orchestra, began performing the symphony in 1925. During World War II, the Imperial government promoted performances of the symphony, including on New Year&#x27;s Eve, to encourage allegiance to Japanese nationalism. After the war, orchestras and choruses, undergoing economic hard times during the reconstruction of Japan, promoted performances of the piece around New Years because of the popularity of the music with the public. In the 1960s, performances of the symphony at New Years became more widespread, including participation by local choirs and orchestras, and established the tradition which continues to this day.

==Little New Year==

There used to be also an associated festival of , traditionally celebrating the first full moon of the new year, on the 15th day of the first lunar month (approximately mid-February). This was celebrated around January 15, in various respects. The main events of &quot;koshōgatsu&quot; are rites and practices praying for a bountiful harvest; is traditionally eaten in the morning and is involved in the rice gruel divination ceremony. New Year decorations are taken down around this date and burnt in the Sagichō or Dondoyaki fire, and some temples hold events, such as Tōrin-in.

== Japanese Lunar New Year ==

Some regions of Japan, including Okinawa Prefecture and the Amami Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, used to celebrate Lunar New Year on the first day of the lunar calendar (around the first day of spring, in February of the Gregorian calendar). Nowadays, it is very rare to celebrate lunar new year as the new year is considered January 1.

<text>A mochi ( ; Japanese ) is a Japanese rice cake made of , a short-grain japonica glutinous rice, and sometimes other ingredients such as water, sugar, and cornstarch. The steamed rice is pounded into paste and molded into the desired shape. In Japan, it is traditionally made in a ceremony called . While eaten year-round, mochi is a traditional food for the Japanese New Year, and is commonly sold and eaten during that time.

Mochi is made up of polysaccharides, lipids, protein, and water. Mochi has a varied structure of amylopectin gel, starch grains, and air bubbles. In terms of starch content, the rice used for mochi is very low in amylose and has a high amylopectin level, producing a gel-like consistency. The protein content of the japonica rice used to make mochi is higher than that of standard short-grain rice.

Mochi is similar to , which is made with rice flour instead of pounded rice grains.

== History ==
Red rice was the original variant used in the production of mochi.
The cultural significance of mochi in Japan is unique, though it has elements in common with other auspicious foods in other Asian countries. According to archaeological research, the homemade production of mochi increased beginning in the 6th century (Kofun period), when earthenware steamers became popular in every household, mainly in eastern Japan.

In the , compiled in the late 8th century in the Nara period, a legend concerning mochi was described. According to the book, when a rich man made a flat mochi from leftover rice and shot an arrow at it, the mochi transformed into a white bird and flew away, and after that, the man&#x27;s rice field became desolate and barren. This legend shows that round white mochi was historically held to have spiritual power.

In the Heian period (794–1185), mochi was often used in Shinto events to celebrate childbirth and marriage. According to the compiled in the 12th century, emperors and nobilities used to put mochi into the mouths of babies that were 50 days old. In this period, it became customary in aristocratic society for the bride and groom to eat mochi together at the bride&#x27;s house three days after the wedding.

The first recorded accounts of mochi being used as a part of New Year&#x27;s festivities are from the Heian period. The nobles of the Imperial court believed that long strands of freshly made mochi symbolized long life and well-being, while dried mochi helped strengthen one&#x27;s teeth. Accounts of it can also be found in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.

The custom of (mirror mochi) began among the samurai class during the Muromachi period. are composed of two spheres of mochi stacked on top of one another, topped with a bitter orange (). In welcoming the New Year, samurai decorated with Japanese armour and Japanese swords and would place them in the (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed) to pray for the prosperity of their families in the New Year. When people ate after the New Year period, they avoided cutting it with a (knife) so as not to violate the , and smashed it with a wooden hammer after it naturally dried and cracked.

Mochi continues to be one of the traditional foods eaten around Japanese New Year and is sold and consumed in abundance around this time. A is placed on family altars () on December 28 each year.

== Seasonal specialties ==

===New Year===
* is a New Year&#x27;s decoration, which is traditionally broken and eaten in a ritual called (mirror opening) and placed on family altars on December 28.
* is a soup containing rice cakes. It is also eaten on New Year&#x27;s Day. In addition to mochi, contains vegetables such as taro, carrot, honeywort, and red and white colored .
* is traditionally made on New Year&#x27;s Day as an emblem of luck. This style of mochi preparation involves roasting the mochi over a fire or stove, then dipping it into water, and finally coating it with sugar and (soy flour).

=== Spring ===
The cherry blossom (sakura) is a symbol of Japan and signifies the onset of full-fledged spring. is a pink-coloured mochi surrounding sweet red bean paste and wrapped in an edible, salted cherry blossom leaf; this dish is usually made during the spring.

=== Children&#x27;s Day ===
Children&#x27;s Day is celebrated in Japan on May 5. On this day, the Japanese promote the happiness and well-being of children. and are made especially for this celebration. is white mochi surrounding a sweet red bean paste filling with a oak leaf wrapped around it.
 is a variation of a wrapped in bamboo leaves.

=== Girls&#x27; Day ===
 is a ceremonial dessert presented as a ritual offering on the days leading up to , or &quot;Girls&#x27; Day&quot; in Japan, on March 3 every year. is rhomboid-shaped mochi with layers of red, green, and white. The three layers are coloured with jasmine flowers, water caltrop, and mugwort.

== Traditional preparation ==

Traditionally, mochi making is an important cultural event in Japan that involves members of a local community or family. Although less common today, the traditional process still exists in most rural areas, as well as in urban temples, shrines, and community spaces, especially in the days leading up to the new year. The traditional process of mochi-pounding (called ) involves whole rice as the only ingredient and takes place in three basic steps:
# Polished glutinous rice is soaked overnight and steamed.
# The steamed rice is mashed and pounded with wooden mallets () in a traditional mortar (). The work involves two people, one pounding and the other turning and wetting the mochi. They must keep a steady rhythm or they may accidentally injure each other with the heavy . 
# The sticky mass is cut or formed into shapes, for example spheres.

== Modern preparation ==
The modern preparation of mochi uses a sweet flour of sweet rice (). The flour is mixed with water and cooked on a stovetop or in the microwave until it forms a sticky, opaque, white mass. This process is performed twice, stirring the mass in between until it becomes malleable and slightly transparent.

With modern equipment, mochi can be made at home, with the technology automating the laborious dough pounding. Household mochi appliances provide a suitable space where the environment of the dough can be controlled.

The assembly-line sections in mochi production control these aspects:
# Viscoelasticity or the products&#x27; chewiness by selecting specific species of rice
# Consistency of the dough during automated pounding process
# Size
# Flavourings and fillings

Varieties of glutinous and waxy rice are produced as major raw material for mochi. The rice is chosen for tensile strength and compressibility. One study found that in rice 172 and BC3, amylopectin distribution varied and affected the hardness of mochi. rice produced harder, brittle, grainy textures, all undesirable qualities except for ease of cutting. For mass production, the rice variety should be chewy, but easy to separate.

Generally, two types of machines are used for mochi production in an assembly line. One machine prepares the dough, while the other forms the dough into consistent shapes, unfilled or with filling. The first type of machine controls the temperature at which the rice gelatinizes. One study found that a temperature of corresponds to the gelatinization of mochi. When the temperature fell below this point, the hardening was too slow. It was concluded that a processing temperature below was unsuitable for dough preparation.

== Processing ==
Mochi is a variation of a low-calorie, low-fat rice cake. The cake has two essential raw materials, rice and water. Sticky rice (also called sweet rice, &quot;Oryza sativa&quot; var. &quot;glutinosa&quot;, glutinous sticky rice, glutinous rice, waxy rice, botan rice, &quot;biroin chal&quot;, mochi rice, pearl rice, and &quot;pulut&quot;), whether brown or white, is best for mochi-making, as long-grain varieties will not expand correctly. Water is essential in the early stages of preparation. Other additives such as salt and other seasonings and flavourings are important for nutritive value and taste. However, additives can cause breakage of the mass, so should not be added to the rice before the cake is formed. The balls of rice are then flattened and cut into pieces or shaped into rounds. The machines for mass production are a hugely expensive investment, and the product should have the proper moisture, to appeal to consumers.

== Preservation ==
While mochi can be refrigerated for a short storage period, it can also &quot;become hard and not usable.&quot; The recommended preservation method is by freezing. The best method for freezing involves wrapping each mochi cake tightly in a sealed plastic bag. Although mochi can be kept in a freezer for almost one year, the frozen mochi may lose flavor and softness or get freezer-burned. Food additives, such as modified tapioca starch, can also extend the shelf life of mochi.

== Ingredients ==
Mochi is relatively simple to make, as only a few ingredients are needed for plain mochi. The main ingredient is either or , Japanese sweet glutinous rice flours. Both and are made from , a type of glutinous short-grain rice. The difference between and comes from texture and processing methods. flour has been more refined and is a finer flour with a smoother, more elastic feel. is less refined and has a doughier texture.

Other ingredients may include water, sugar, and cornstarch (to prevent sticking). Additional other ingredients can be added to create different variations/flavors.

== Nutrition ==

Mochi is gluten- and cholesterol-free, as it is made from rice flour.

A single serving of has 96 calories (kilocalories), of fat, but no trans or saturated fat, of sodium, of carbohydrates, no dietary fiber, of sugar, and of protein.

== Chemistry and structural composition of glutinous rice ==
Amylose and amylopectin are both components of starch and polysaccharides made from D-glucose units. The big difference between the two is that amylose is linear because it only has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds. Amylopectin, though, is a branched polysaccharide because it has αlpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds with occasional αlpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds around every 22 D-glucose units. Glutinous rice is nearly 100% composed of amylopectin and almost completely lacks its counterpart, amylose, in its starch granules. A nonglutinous rice grain contains amylose at about 10–30% weight by weight and amylopectin at about 70–90% weight by weight.

Glutinous or waxy type of starches occur in maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice. An interesting characteristic of glutinous rice is that it stains red when iodine is added, whereas nonglutinous rice stains blue. This phenomenon occurs when iodine is mixed with iodide to form tri-iodide and penta-iodide. Penta-iodide intercalates between the starch molecules and stains amylose and amylopectin blue and red, respectively. The gelation and viscous texture of glutinous rice is due to amylopectin being more hygroscopic than amylose, thus water enters the starch granule, causing it to swell, while the amylose leaves the starch granule and becomes part of a colloidal solution. In other words, the higher the amylopectin content, the higher the swelling of the starch granule.

Though the amylopectin content plays a major role in the defined characteristic of viscosity in glutinous rice, factors such as heat also play a very important role in the swelling, since it enhances the uptake of water into the starch granule significantly.

The high amylopectin content of waxy or glutinous starches is genetically controlled by the waxy or wax gene. Its quality of greater viscosity and gelation is dependent on the distribution of the amylopectin unit chains. Grains that have this gene are considered mutants, which explains why most of them are selectively bred to create a grain that is close to having or has a 0% amylose content. The table below summarizes the amylose and amylopectin content of different starches, waxy and nonwaxy:

The soaking of the glutinous rice is an elemental step in the preparation of mochi, either traditionally or industrially. During this process, glutinous rice decreases in protein content as it is soaked in water. The chemicals that make up the flavour of plain or &quot;natural&quot; mochi are ethyl acetate, ethanol, 2-butanol, 2 methyl 1-propanol, 1-butanol, isoamyl alcohol, 1-pentanol and propane acid.

Mochi is usually composed solely of glutinous rice, however, some variations may include the additions of salt, spices and flavourings such as cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde). Food additives such as sucrose, sorbitol or glycerol may be added to increase viscosity and therefore increase gelatinization. Additives that slow down retrogradation are not usually added since amylopectin has a very stable shelf life due to its high amylopectin content.

==Viscoelasticity==
Mochi&#x27;s characteristic chewiness is due to the polysaccharides in it. The viscosity and elasticity that account for this chewiness are affected by many factors such as the starch concentration, configuration of the swollen starch granules, the conditions of heating (temperature, heating period and rate of heating) as well as the junction zones that interconnect each polymer chain. The more junction zones the substance has, the stronger the cohesiveness of the gel, thereby forming a more solid-like material. The perfect mochi has the perfect balance between viscosity and elasticity so that it is not inextensible and fragile but rather extensible yet firm.

Many tests have been conducted on the factors that affect the viscoelastic properties of mochi. As puncture tests show, samples with a higher solid (polysaccharide) content show an increased resistance and thereby a stronger and tougher gel. This increased resistance to the puncture test indicate that an increase in solute concentration leads to a more rigid and harder gel with an increased cohesiveness, internal binding, elasticity and springiness which means a decrease in material flow or an increase in viscosity. These results can also be brought about by an increase in heating time.

Sensory assessments of the hardness, stickiness and elasticity of mochi and their relationship with solute concentration and heating time were performed. Similar to the puncture test results, sensory tests determine that hardness and elasticity increase with increasing time of heating and solid concentration. However, stickiness of the samples increase with increasing time of heating and solid concentration until a certain level, above which the reverse is observed.

These relationships are important because too hard or elastic a mochi is undesirable, as is one that is too sticky and will stick to walls of the container.

==Health hazards==
Suffocation deaths are caused by mochi every year in Japan, especially among elderly people. In 2015, it was reported that according to the Tokyo Fire Department – which responds to choking cases – more than 100 people were hospitalised per year for choking on mochi in Tokyo alone. Also in Tokyo, between 2006 and 2009 there were 18 reported deaths resulting from choking on mochi. As a result of this risk, Japanese authorities put out yearly warnings, advising people to cut mochi into small pieces before consumption.

==Popular uses==
Mochi may be eaten alone as a major component of a main meal, and is used as an ingredient in other prepared foods.

===Confectionery===
Many types of traditional and (Japanese traditional sweets) are made with mochi. For example, is a soft round mochi stuffed with sweet filling, such as sweetened red bean paste () or white bean paste (). is a version containing a whole strawberry inside.

 is a green variety of mochi flavored with mugwort (). When is made with , it is called .

===Ice cream===

Small balls of ice cream are wrapped inside a mochi covering to make mochi ice cream. In Japan, this is manufactured by the conglomerate Lotte under the name , &quot;snow-viewing &quot;.

===Soup===
* or is a sweet azuki bean soup with pieces of mochi. In winter, Japanese people often eat it to warm themselves.
* (meaning &quot;power udon&quot;) is a dish consisting of udon noodles in soup topped with toasted mochi.
* . See New Year specialties below.

==Other variations==

* is a Japanese dumpling made from (rice flour).
* is not true mochi, but a jelly-like confection made from bracken starch and covered or dipped in (soybean flour) with sugar. It is popular in the summertime, and often sold from trucks, not unlike ice cream trucks in Western countries.
* is not a true mochi, but a popular traditional Japanese confection made of flour, rice powder, buckwheat, and red bean paste.
* is a thick, jelly-like dessert. It is made of red bean paste, agar, and sugar. There are two main types: and .
* is deep fried rice cake twisted into a rope shape. It is often consumed during the Japanese Star Festival called . There is some confusion about its origin based on evidence from historical records of a dish called , which some scholars believe was a confection while others think it was an early form of the wheat noodle . ( was made from a mixture of wheat flour and rice flour).
*&quot;Moffles&quot; (waffles made from toasted mochi) were introduced in about 2000. They are made in a specialized machine as well as a traditional waffle iron.
*Mochi donuts are a hybrid confection originally popularized in Japan by the chain Mister Donut before spreading to the United States via Hawaii. This confection is &quot;a cross between a traditional cake-like doughnut and chewy mochi dough similar to what&#x27;s wrapped around ice cream&quot;. The Mister Donut style, also known as &quot;pon de ring&quot;, uses tapioca flour and produces mochi donuts that are easy to pull apart. Another variation developed in the United States uses glutinous rice flour which produces a denser mochi donut akin to Hawaiian-style butter mochi. Mochi donuts made from glutinous rice flour &quot;typically contain half the amount of calories as the standard cake or yeast doughnut&quot;.

==Variations outside Japan==
In Taiwan, a traditional Hakka and Hoklo pounded rice cake was called &quot;teuchi&quot; or &quot;tauchi&quot; () and came in various styles and forms just like in Japan. Traditional Hakka mochi is served as glutinous rice dough, covered with peanuts (粢粑; &quot;zī bā&quot;) or sesame powder. Not until the Japanese era was Japanese-style mochi introduced and gained popularity. Nowadays, Taiwanese mochi (麻糬; &quot;máshǔ&quot;) often come with bean paste fillings.

In China, is made from glutinous rice flour mixed with a small amount of water to form balls and is then cooked and served in boiling water. is typically filled with black sesame paste or peanut paste and served in the water that it was boiled in.

In Hong Kong and other Cantonese regions, the traditional () is made of glutinous rice flour in the shape of a ball, with fillings such as crushed peanuts, coconut, red bean paste, and black sesame paste. It can come in a variety of modern flavors such as green tea, mango, taro, strawberry, and more.

In Philippines, a traditional Filipino sweet snack similar to Japanese mochi is called (). There is also another delicacy called &quot;espasol&quot; with a taste similar to Japanese , though made with roasted rice flour (not , roasted soy flour). The Philippines also has several steamed rice snacks with very similar names to mochi, including , , and . These are small steamed rice balls with bean paste or peanut fillings. However they are not derived from the Japanese mochi, but are derivatives of the Chinese (called in the Philippines). They are also made with the native process, which mixes ground slightly fermented cooked glutinous rice with coconut milk.

In Korea, (Hangul: ) varieties are made of steamed glutinous rice or steamed glutinous rice flour.

In Indonesia, is usually filled with sweet bean paste and covered with sesame seeds. comes from Sukabumi, West Java and Semarang, Central Java.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yoko Kamio. The story takes place in the fictional Eitoku Academy, an elite school for children from rich families. It tells the story of Tsukushi Makino, a girl from a middle-class family, whose mother enrolls her in an elite high school to compete with the families from her husband&#x27;s company. While at Eitoku, she encounters the F4, a gang of four boys who are children of Japan&#x27;s wealthiest families and who bully anyone that gets in their way.

The series was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Margaret&quot; magazine from October 1992 to January 2004, with its chapters collected in 37 &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes between 1992 and 2008. In North America, the manga is licensed by Viz Media.

The manga has been adapted into various mediums. It was first adapted as an audio drama released on CD from July 1993 to July 1994. This was followed by a Japanese live-action feature film in 1995, then an animated television series, produced by Toei Animation, that was broadcast by ABC from 1996 to 1997. The first live-action television adaptation was one produced in Taiwan, titled &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; (2001). After Taiwan&#x27;s &quot;Meteor Garden&quot;, a number of other live-action television adaptations have followed. A Japanese live-action series aired from 2005 to 2007 (and was followed by a 2008 film), a South Korean adaptation aired in 2009, a mainland Chinese adaptation, also titled &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; aired in 2018, and a Thai adaptation, &quot;F4 Thailand: Boys Over Flowers&quot;, was aired from 2021 to 2022.

In 1996, &quot;Boys Over Flowers&quot; won the 41st Shogakukan Manga Award for the &quot;shōjo&quot; category. By February 2015, the series had over 61 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time and the best-selling &quot;shōjo&quot; manga of all time. The series enjoys immense popularity in the Eastern Asia region.

==Plot==
 in Yamanote, Japan is a prestigious school that caters to children from upper-class families. Hence, Tsukushi Makino, who comes from a middle-class family, fulfills the literal meaning of her name, as she is initially considered to be the &quot;weed&quot; of the school. The school is ruled by the F4 (&quot;Flower Four&quot;), four young men from Japan&#x27;s wealthiest families. Tsukasa Domyoji is the son of the wealthiest, most powerful family in Japan. They initially bully Tsukushi when she stands up to them. However, Domyoji eventually takes an interest in her because she is the only girl in the school who stands up to him.
Tsukushi, however, is repulsed by his hot-headed nature and bullying demeanor, falling instead for soft-spoken and sensitive Rui Hanazawa, Tsukasa&#x27;s best friend since childhood.

The other two members of the F4 are Akira Mimasaka, the laid-back peacemaker of the group, and Sojirou Nishikado, an unrepentant playboy. They both usually have at least one girlfriend at any one time; Akira prefers older women because the women of his household (his mother and two younger sisters) are quite childish. Sojirou is happy to be in casual relationships with many women, although we later discover that at one time he was in love with a childhood friend. Over time, Tsukushi&#x27;s feelings towards Tsukasa evolve, as she begins to appreciate the degree of change that occurred in Tsukasa once he fell in love with her. However, because of the difference in social class, Tsukushi and Tsukasa&#x27;s relationship is blocked by Tsukasa&#x27;s mother, Kaede but supported by his elder sister, Tsubaki, who becomes friends with Tsukushi.

==Characters==
:
:The protagonist is a teenage high school girl whose name, Tsukushi, means &quot;weed&quot;. She is thus the &quot;weed&quot; that will challenge the &quot;Flower Four&quot; or F4. Tsukushi is one of the very few students studying at Eitoku High School to come from a middle-class family. Her mother pushed her to join Eitoku because the children of her father&#x27;s work colleagues all attend prestigious schools. Tsukushi is unhappy at Eitoku, but feels if she quietly exists for two years, she can survive it. However, after defending her friend who accidentally falls down a set of stairs and onto the leader of the F4, Tsukasa Domyoji, she, instead, receives a red card—a declaration of war. This officially marks her for future torment by the F4 and the rest of the student body.
:However, unlike most of the F4&#x27;s targets, Tsukushi retaliates by directly attacking Tsukasa. This unexpected retaliation and steadfast resistance to the hazing is one that he has never encountered from a target before, and falls in love with Tsukushi. Initially, Tsukushi hates all of the F4 except Rui Hanazawa, for whom she harbors romantic feelings. But, after Rui admits that he will never stop loving his childhood sweetheart Shizuka, Tsukushi slowly falls in love with Tsukasa and becomes friends with the F4.
:
:Tsukasa is the leader of the F4 group and the heir to the large Domyoji Enterprises. He grew up with the rest of the F4 as his mother was always overseas, and his older sister relocated to Los Angeles after her marriage. His mother, in particular, is cold towards him, and wants to control his life for the sake of preserving the family name.
:As the extremely hot-headed and volatile leader of the F4, Tsukasa uses his power to rule over the entire school. He uses an infamous red card and attaches it inside anyone&#x27;s locker who has made the F4, particularly him, upset. A red card gives the entire student body at Eitoku free rein to bully, prank, and humiliate the receiver until they decide to leave the school. However, Tsukushi&#x27;s declaration of war against the F4 after receiving the red card, retaliation against the student body and strong will, reminds Tsukasa of his beloved older sister, Tsubaki. He thus grows fond of Tsukushi, eventually falling madly in love with her.
:
:Rui is Tsukasa&#x27;s best friend and Tsukushi&#x27;s first romantic interest. He is generally quiet, distant, uninterested in people and is said to be autistic. He only opens up to his close friends and the model Shizuka Todo, to whom he was betrothed at birth. Rui admires Tsukushi&#x27;s courage in standing up to Tsukasa and eventually begins to help her. After he comes back from France and witnessing Shizuka&#x27;s marriage, Rui was very frustrated and slowly falls in love with Tsukushi. However, after learning that Tsukushi genuinely loves Tsukasa, Rui backs off.
:
:Sojirou is the biggest playboy of the F4. He is devoted to the practice of traditional Japanese tea ceremonies (which is his family&#x27;s business). For the most part, he and Akira usually work to keep the peace within the group and following Tsukasa.
:
:Akira is arguably the kindest and most mature member of F4. His family is very powerful in the Japanese underground (in the manga they own a large trading company). He keeps his cool and rarely loses his temper, although when he does, even Domyoji has to run for the hills. He has a pair of young twin sisters who annoy him due to their intense affection for him.
:
:Yuuki is Tsukushi&#x27;s childhood friend. The two work together at a dango shop after school. Yuuki cares a lot about Tsukushi&#x27;s feelings, and does not want anybody to hurt Tsukushi. Yuuki offers Tsukushi a lot of encouragement and advice about her situation with the F4.
:
:Shizuka is a rich heiress, a fashion model, and a childhood friend of the F4, particularly Rui. She was the first person who was able to get him to come out of his shell, and the two were inseparable for much of their childhood. She began a modeling career during her high school years, but at her twentieth birthday party she announces that she will give up her career as a model as well as her position as the Todou heiress to move to Paris and become a human rights lawyer. She was very kind toward Tsukushi, as she sees her as Rui&#x27;s romantic interest. Rui initially accompanies Shizuka to Paris at Tsukushi&#x27;s request, but their relationship suffers as Shizuka spends more and more time at work. Towards the end of the manga series, Rui tell&#x27;s Tsukushi that what happened between him and Shizuka is completely over and thats okay with him, they&#x27;re on good terms and are still friends.
:
:Kazuya is another one of Tsukushi&#x27;s childhood friends. He enrolls at Eitoku after his family comes into money through some real-estate deals. The other students at Eitoku draw a sharp distinction between Kazuya&#x27;s &quot;new money&quot; and their &quot;old money&quot;. The F4, in particular, mention this difference fairly often and consider him to be a nuisance as the story progresses, and simply tolerate him because of Tsukushi&#x27;s fondness for him.
:
:Makiko is one of Tsukushi&#x27;s only friends at Eitoku in the beginning of the series. Tsukushi rescues her from inevitable torment after she collides with Domyouji on the stairs. Although she is forced to break off their friendship to prevent becoming a target of abuse, Makiko finds ways to help Tsukushi, sending her secret messages of encouragement or to warn her of impending danger.
:
:Sakurako was the target of bullying as a young child, particularly by the F4, because she was born &quot;ugly&quot;. When she confessed her love to Domyoji, he traumatized her by making fun of her looks. She eventually moved to Germany because of her family&#x27;s business, and underwent plastic surgery to end the bullying. Many years later, she returns to Eitoku, where no one recognizes her now attractive face. She plans to take revenge on the F4, and befriends Tsukushi (who is unaware of her history). When she hears of Domyoji&#x27;s growing attraction to Tsukushi, she conspires with her friend Thomas to destroy her.
:
:Junpei is a &quot;kōhai&quot; of Tsukushi&#x27;s that saves her from being bullied after she gets back from her trip to Canada. He first appears as a nerdy boy, with glasses and an oblivious attitude. He is actually a famous model for a well-known magazine, hiding his identity in school through his glasses. Tskushi sees him as the only other person at school who thinks the way she thinks after he says he only needs to endure two more years. Junpei&#x27;s real motive is to lure Domyoji in order to take revenge for an injury his older brother endured. He uses Tsukushi as bait to lure Tsukasa to him and his friend, who are looking for vengeance after being humiliated by Tsukasa.
:
:Shigeru is the heiress of the Okawahara Corporation, and Tsukasa&#x27;s fiance for the arranged marriage created by his mother. Tsukasa neither likes nor wants to marry her, although she falls in love with him. She also befriends Tsukushi without knowing of her past relationship with Tsukasa.
:
:Tsubaki is Tsukasa&#x27;s elder sister, and closest friend. Although she bullies him, he adores and trusts her more than anyone else, as she raised him in the absence of their parents. After she graduated from Eitoku, she dated a working class man, which led to her mother forcing them apart so that Tsubaki could marry a wealthier man. Although she has obtained a degree of happiness in her marriage, she often gets sad and travels home to Japan when her husband is busy overseas. She begs Tsukasa not to make the same mistake in love. She sees Tsukushi as a younger sister, and always helps with her relationship with Tsukasa.
:
:Kaede is Tsukasa&#x27;s controlling mother and is the chairwoman of Domyoji Enterprises. She is a powerful and feared businesswoman who does everything she can to end Tsukasa&#x27;s relationship with Tsukushi. At one point, she tried to pay Tsukushi 50 million yen to get her to agree not to see Tsukasa again. However, Tsukushi&#x27;s mother refused the money and poured salt onto Kaede&#x27;s head because Kaede had insulted Tsukushi. Kaede then tried to force Tsukasa to marry Shigeru. When she found out that Tsukasa was going to break up with Shigeru, she became furious and forced Tsukasa to marry Shigeru quickly. When Shigeru and Tsukasa &quot;marry&quot;, she witnesses Shigeru&#x27;s true plan to set Tsukasa and Tsukushi up and even tries to stop it at first. But after knowing that Tsukushi truly cares about Tsukasa and everyone else, she accepts their relationship and eventual marriage.

<doc id="147811" wikidata="Q459911" url="?curid=147811" title="Takehiko Inoue">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. He is best known for the basketball series &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; (1990–1996), and the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; manga &quot;Vagabond&quot;, which are two of the best-selling manga series in history. Many of his works are about basketball, Inoue himself being a huge fan of the sport. His works sold in North America through Viz Media are &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, &quot;Vagabond&quot; and &quot;Real&quot;, although &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; was earlier translated by Gutsoon! Entertainment. In 2012, Inoue became the first recipient of the Cultural Prize at the Asia Cosmopolitan Awards.

==Early life and education==

Inoue was born in Isa, Kagoshima, and was fond of drawing since he was a child. During elementary and junior high school, Inoue joined the kendo and basketball clubs, becoming captain of the latter. In his third year at Kagoshima Prefectural Oguchi High School, Inoue took a summer course at an art preparatory school with the plan of enrolling into an art university, but such schools were too expensive so he ended up going to Kumamoto University near his hometown. There he majored in literature. His submission to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; caught the attention of editor Taizo Nakamura and, at the age of 20, Inoue dropped out of college to move to Tokyo and pursue a career as a manga artist.

==Career==
Before his debut, Inoue was an assistant to Tsukasa Hojo on &quot;City Hunter&quot;. He made his debut in 1988, when appeared in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine. It won the 35th annual Tezuka Award. His first serialization was in 1989 with &quot;Chameleon Jail&quot;, for which he was the illustrator of a story written by Kazuhiko Watanabe.

Inoue&#x27;s first real fame came with his next manga, &quot;Slam Dunk&quot;, about a basketball team from Shohoku High School. It was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from 1990 to 1996 and has sold over 170 million copies worldwide. In 1995 it received the 40th annual Shogakukan Manga Award for shōnen manga and in 2007 was declared Japan&#x27;s favorite manga. &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; was adapted into a 101 episode anime television series and four films. The manga&#x27;s popularity caused a surge of interest in basketball among Japanese youth, leading to Inoue and his publisher Shueisha creating the &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; Scholarship program in 2006 and Inoue receiving commendation from the Japan Basketball Association for helping popularize basketball in the country.

Inoue launched &quot;Buzzer Beater&quot; as an online comic in May 1996 on the Sports-i ESPN website (now J Sports). It is about a basketball team from Earth that attempts to compete on the intergalactic level, it appears on his official website in four languages: Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean. &quot;Buzzer Beater&quot; was produced into a 13 episode anime series in 2005. In 2007, a second 13 episode series was produced. Both seasons were animated by TMS Entertainment.

&quot;Vagabond&quot; was Inoue&#x27;s next manga, adapted from the fictionalized accounts by Eiji Yoshikawa of the samurai Miyamoto Musashi, which he began drawing in 1998. The series won the Kodansha Manga Award for General manga in 2000 and the Grand Prize of the 6th Osamu Tezuka Culture Awards in 2002, receiving his award alongside fellow mangaka, Kentaro Miura.

While still working on &quot;Vagabond&quot;, Inoue began drawing &quot;Real&quot; in 1999, his third basketball manga, which focuses on wheelchair basketball. It received an Excellence Prize at the 2001 Japan Media Arts Festival. Inoue also created character designs for the Xbox 360 RPG, &quot;Lost Odyssey&quot;, based on initial material provided by Hironobu Sakaguchi. Sakaguchi sought out Inoue for his talent of depicting &quot;people&quot; and his ability to &quot;illustrate the internal emotions of a character&quot; since the goal of the video game was to explain people.

In March 2011, Inoue painted large images of the Buddhist leader Shinran on twelve folding screens for display at the East Hongan Temple in Kyoto. The paintings include Shinran and Hōnen wading through water with a group of followers and an image Shinran with a bird.

In 2013, Inoue published an illustrated travel memoir on the life and architecture of Antoni Gaudí titled &quot;&quot;, detailing his thoughts and travels in Catalonia.

In 2013, Takehiko Inoue was appointed by the Japanese Foreign Ministry to serve as an ambassador to celebrate Japan and Spain 400 years of goodwill until July 31, 2014.

In 2022, Inoue made his directorial debut with the anime film adaptation of his &quot;Slam Dunk&quot; manga, titled &quot;The First Slam Dunk&quot;. Inoue also wrote the screenplay and story for the film. In 2024, he received the Best Director and Best Screenplay award for his work at the Tokyo Anime Award Festival.

<doc id="147812" wikidata="Q753910" url="?curid=147812" title="Soba">
<text>Soba ( or , &quot;buckwheat&quot;) are Japanese noodles made primarily from buckwheat flour, with a small amount of wheat flour mixed in. 
It has an ashen brown color, and a slightly grainy texture. The noodles are served either chilled with a dipping sauce, or hot in a noodle soup. They are used in a wide variety of dishes.

In Japan, soba noodles can be found at fast food venues like to expensive specialty restaurants. Dried soba noodles are sold in stores, along with &quot;men-tsuyu&quot;, or instant noodle broth, to make home preparation easy. 

The amino acid balance of the protein in buckwheat, and therefore in soba, is well matched to the needs of humans and can complement the amino acid deficiencies of other staples such as rice and wheat (see protein combining). The tradition of eating soba arose in the Edo period.

The word &quot;soba&quot; (蕎麦) means &quot;buckwheat&quot; (&quot;Fagopyrum esculentum&quot;). The full name for buckwheat noodles is &quot;soba-kiri&quot; (蕎麦切り &quot;buckwheat slices&quot;), but &quot;soba&quot; is commonly used for short. 

Historically, soba noodles were called &quot;Nihon-soba&quot;, &quot;Wa-soba&quot;, or &quot;Yamato-soba&quot;, all of which mean &quot;Japanese soba&quot;. This was meant to distinguish soba from wheat noodles of Chinese origin, such as ramen, sōmen, or udon.

In more recent times, &quot;soba&quot; can refer to noodles in general, regardless of origin or composition. For example, &quot;ramen&quot; was traditionally called &quot;chūka soba&quot; (中華そば) or &quot;shina soba&quot; (支那そば), both meaning &quot;Chinese noodles&quot;, though the word &quot;shina&quot; is now considered offensive. &quot;Soba&quot; can be used to refer to wheat noodles, as in &quot;aburasoba&quot; or &quot;yakisoba&quot;. In Okinawa, &quot;soba&quot; generally refers to Okinawa soba, also made from wheat flour.

==History==
===Background===
Traces of buckwheat have been found at Neolithic sites in Japan, dating to 4000-2000 BCE, during the Jōmon period.

Buckwheat cultivation was first recorded in the &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot;, in an imperial edict of 722 CE issued by Empress Genshō, instructing farmers to plant buckwheat in response to drought and famine. Another edict of 839 CE declared that buckwheat should be sown in August, and harvested in October, because the crop grows quickly in poor soil. However, buckwheat did not seem to be widely cultivated, and was only sporadically eaten as porridge.

In the 8th century, noodle-type foods of Chinese origin appeared in Japan. Later, the monk Enni (1202-1280) is traditionally credited for introducing noodles to Japan after returning from China.

The first specific reference to buckwheat noodles (&quot;soba-kiri&quot;) comes from a record of 1574, kept at Jōshō-ji temple, which documents that &quot;soba-kiri&quot; was served to workers repairing the main hall. More mentions of soba noodles follow throughout the early 1600s.

===Edo period===

Modern soba originates from the Edo period (1603-1868), centered around the city of Edo (modern Tokyo). The earliest references to soba are associated with Buddhist monasteries and tea ceremonies. 

The 1643 cookbook &quot;Ryōri Monogatari&quot; (料理物語) is the first to contain a recipe for making soba. After the Great Fire of Meireki in 1657, soba shops became increasingly common in Tokyo.

At first, soba was considered a low-class food, but its reputation improved by the 18th century, when it began to be eaten by samurai and other high status peoples. 

One estimate states that every city block had one or more restaurants serving soba. These soba establishments, many also serving sake, functioned much like modern cafes where locals would stop for a casual meal. In 1860, a meeting in Tokyo concerning the price of buckwheat was attended by 3,726 shops, indicating the popularity of soba. Soba was also sold from mobile food stalls called &quot;yatai&quot;.

At the time, much of the city&#x27;s population was susceptible to beriberi, due to high consumption of white rice, which is low in thiamine. Soba, which is high in thiamine, was regularly eaten to prevent beriberi.

=== Modern ===

Soba continues to be popular in modern times. Restaurants dedicated to soba include Sunaba, Chōju-an, Ōmura-an, Shōgetsu-an, Masuda-ya, and Maruka, some of which are &quot;yagō&quot;, or traditional establishments whose names have passed down over time. Some restaurants serve soba and udon together, since both are prepared and eaten in a similar manner.

Railway stations often sell soba, as it is a popular and inexpensive fast food. They are frequently purchased by busy salarymen. Soba continues to be sold at &quot;yatai&quot; food stalls.

There are regional differences in the consumption of soba. A common perception is that soba is more popular in the Kantō region (eastern Japan), while udon is more popular in the Kansai region (western Japan), though there are exceptions. As such, soba is considered the traditional noodle of choice for Tokyoites. 

Soba is traditionally eaten on New Year&#x27;s Eve in most areas of Japan. This soba is called &quot;toshikoshi soba&quot; (&quot;year-crossing soba&quot;). In the Tokyo area, there is also a tradition of giving out soba to new neighbors after a house move (&quot;hikkoshi soba&quot;), although this practice is now rare.

== Preparation ==

Soba is made by slicing dough into thin noodles. Historically, soba was made only from buckwheat flour, and was steamed in baskets, because they were too brittle to boil. Modern soba is usually made from a mix of 80% buckwheat flour, and 20% wheat flour.

Fresh soba, often served at restaurants, are generally cooked immediately after slicing, when the noodles are still moist and pliable. Store bought soba are dried and straight, and come in bundles.

==Types==

Like many Japanese noodles, soba noodles are often served drained and chilled in the summer, and hot in the winter with a soy-based dashi broth. Extra toppings can be added to both hot and cold soba. Toppings are chosen to reflect the seasons and to balance with other ingredients. Most toppings are added without much cooking, although some are deep-fried. Most of these dishes may also be prepared with udon.

===Cold soba===
Chilled soba is often served on a sieve-like bamboo tray called a &quot;zaru&quot;, sometimes garnished with bits of dried nori seaweed, with a dipping sauce known as &quot;soba tsuyu&quot; on the side. The &quot;tsuyu&quot; is made of a strong mixture of &quot;dashi&quot;, sweetened soy sauce (also called &quot;satōjōyu&quot;) and mirin. Using chopsticks, the diner picks up a small amount of soba from the tray and dips it in the cold &quot;tsuyu&quot; before eating it. Wasabi and sliced negi are often mixed into the &quot;tsuyu&quot;. Many people think that the best way to experience the unique texture of hand-made soba noodles is to eat them cold, since letting them soak in hot broth changes their consistency. After the noodles are eaten, many people enjoy drinking the water in which the noodles were cooked (&quot;sobayu&quot; ), mixed with the leftover tsuyu.

*&quot;Hadaka soba&quot; (naked soba 裸蕎麦): Cold soba served on its own.
*&quot;Hiyashi soba&quot; (): Cold soba served with various toppings sprinkled on top, after which the broth is poured on by the diner. It may include:
**tororo: puree of &quot;yamaimo&quot; (a Japanese yam with a mucilaginous texture)
**oroshi: grated daikon radish
**nattō: sticky fermented soybeans
**okura: fresh sliced okra
*&quot;Mori soba&quot; (): Basic chilled soba noodles served on a flat basket or a plate.
*&quot;Soba maki&quot;: A makizushi prepared as cold soba wrapped in nori.
* Soba salad: Cold soba mixed in the sesame dressing with vegetables. It is a modern and fusion cold soba dish mostly served outside Japan.
*&quot;Zaru soba&quot; (): &quot;Mori soba&quot; topped with shredded nori seaweed.

===Hot soba===
Soba is also often served as a noodle soup in a bowl of hot &quot;tsuyu&quot;. The hot &quot;tsuyu&quot; in this instance is thinner than that used as a dipping sauce for chilled soba. Popular garnishes are sliced long onion and shichimi tōgarashi (mixed chili powder).

==Noodle varieties==


Different flavors and types of soba noodles are available. In Japan, buckwheat is produced mainly in Hokkaido. Soba that is made with newly harvested buckwheat is called &quot;shin-soba&quot;. It is sweeter and more flavorful than regular soba.

Nagano Prefecture is famous for a variety of soba called &quot;shinshu soba&quot;, because the region&#x27;s volcanic soil and temperature extremes are suited for growing buckwheat. From the Kurohime and Togakushi highlands in the north to the Kaida highlands in the south, and the prefecture boasts the second-highest production of soba in Japan. Many facilities integrate cultivation, milling and cutting, and provide soba cutting courses for customers, a major leisure activity in Nagano. Only noodles containing 40% or more buckwheat flour can carry the &quot;shinshu&quot; name.

*&quot;Etanbetsu soba&quot;: named after the central region of Hokkaidō (around Asahikawa city)
*&quot;Izumo soba&quot;: named after Izumo in Shimane
*&quot;Izushi soba&quot;: named after Izushi in Hyōgo
*&quot;Shinshu soba&quot; or &quot;Shinano soba&quot;: named after the old names of Nagano Prefecture

== Outside Japan ==
A variation of Okinawa soba known as is popular in the city of Campo Grande, in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul due to influence of Okinawan immigrants. It is eaten all-year long at street markets or in special restaurants called &quot;sobarias&quot;. , the recipe has deviated from Okinawa style to suit Brazilian local preferences.

==Etiquette==
Soba is typically eaten with chopsticks, and in Japan, it is considered acceptable to slurp the noodles noisily. This is especially common with hot noodles, as drawing up the noodles quickly into the mouth helps cool them. However, quiet consumption of noodles is no longer uncommon.

==Delivery==

Food delivery services called &quot;demae&quot; (出前) originally served wealthy daimyō (lords) in the 1700s. Until the late Shōwa period (1926–1989), stacks of soba bowls were carried on the shoulders of deliverymen on bicycles. 

In March 1961, new cycling traffic laws added restrictions. Officials of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department stated: “To ride on a bicycle with piles of soba bowls on your shoulder is dangerous. It must be prohibited from the viewpoint of road traffic safety. But we will not place any stricter curb as they will lose more than half their customers,” and, “With this police assurance to overlook the illegal traffic practice, soba delivery boys will continue to race through the streets of Tokyo.”

Delivering large stacks of soba is no longer practiced. Modern restaurants deliver soba by scooters. The Honda Super Cub motorcycle was designed with soba delivery in mind.

==Nutritional value==
100 grams of cooked soba yields of energy. Soba contains all nine essential amino acids, including lysine, which common wheat does not contain.

Soba contains a type of polysaccharide that is easily digested. Soba noodles also contain antioxidants, including rutin and quercetin, and essential nutrients including choline, thiamine and riboflavin.

<text>Brazilian cuisine is the set of cooking practices and traditions of Brazil, and is characterized by European, Amerindian, African, and Asian (Levantine, Japanese, and most recently, Chinese) influences. It varies greatly by region, reflecting the country&#x27;s mix of native and immigrant populations, and its continental size as well. This has created a national cuisine marked by the preservation of regional differences.

Ingredients first used by native peoples in Brazil include cashews, cassava, &quot;guaraná&quot;, &quot;açaí&quot;, &quot;cumaru,&quot; and &quot;tucupi&quot;. From there, the many waves of immigrants brought some of their typical dishes, replacing missing ingredients with local equivalents. For instance, the European immigrants (primarily from Portugal, Italy, Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Poland, and Ukraine), were accustomed to a wheat-based diet, and introduced wine, leafy vegetables, and dairy products into Brazilian cuisine. When potatoes were not available, they discovered how to use the native sweet manioc as a replacement. Enslaved Africans also had a role in developing Brazilian cuisine, especially in the coastal states. The foreign influence extended to later migratory waves; Japanese immigrants brought most of the food items that Brazilians associate with Asian cuisine today, and introduced large-scale aviaries well into the 20th century.

The most visible regional cuisines belong to the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia. Minas Gerais cuisine has European influence in delicacies and dairy products such as feijão tropeiro, pão de queijo and Minas cheese, and Bahian cuisine due to the presence of African delicacies such as acarajé, abará and vatapá.

Root vegetables such as manioc (locally known as &quot;mandioca&quot;, &quot;aipim&quot; or &quot;macaxeira&quot;, among other names), yams, and fruit like açaí, cupuaçu, mango, papaya, guava, orange, passion fruit, pineapple, and hog plum are among the local ingredients used in cooking.

Some typical dishes are feijoada, considered the country&#x27;s national dish, and regional foods such as , feijão tropeiro, vatapá, moqueca capixaba, polenta (from Italian cuisine) and acarajé (from African cuisine). There is also &quot;caruru&quot;, which consists of okra, onion, dried shrimp, and toasted nuts (peanuts or cashews), cooked with palm oil until a spread-like consistency is reached; &quot;moqueca baiana&quot;, consisting of slow-cooked fish in palm oil and coconut milk, tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, garlic and topped with cilantro.

The national beverage is coffee, while cachaça is Brazil&#x27;s native liquor. Cachaça is distilled from fermented sugar cane must, and is the main ingredient in the national cocktail, caipirinha. 

Cheese buns (&quot;pão-de-queijo&quot;), and &quot;salgadinhos&quot; such as &quot;pastéis&quot;, &quot;coxinhas&quot;, &quot;risólis&quot; and &quot;kibbeh&quot; (from Arabic cuisine) are common finger food items, while &quot;cuscuz de tapioca&quot; (milled tapioca) is a popular dessert.

==Cuisine by Brazilian region==
===Regional cuisines===

There is not an exact single &quot;national Brazilian cuisine&quot;, but there is an assortment of various regional traditions and typical dishes. This diversity is linked to the origins of the people inhabiting each area.

For instance, the cuisine of Bahia is heavily influenced by a mix of African, Indigenous, and Portuguese cuisines. Chili (including chili sauces) and palm oil are very common. In the northern states, however, due to the abundance of forest and freshwater rivers, fish, fruits and cassava (including flours made of cassava) are staple foods. In the deep south, as in Rio Grande do Sul, the influence shifts more towards &quot;gaúcho&quot; traditions shared with its neighbors Argentina and Uruguay, with many meat-based products, due to this region&#x27;s livestock-based economy; the churrasco, a kind of barbecue, is a local tradition.

===Center-West Brazil&#x27;s cuisine===
In Goiás State, the pequi is used in many typical foods, especially the &quot;arroz com pequi&quot; (rice cooked with pequi), and in snacks, mostly as a filling for pastel, in this state is very common the presence of chestnuts, and palm trees. Also, a mixture of chicken and rice known as galinhada is very popular. The states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul received influence from neighboring countries in their cuisine, as well as the Pantanal area and its various rivers and extensive wetlands that cross these two states with a high abundance of fish.

===Southeast Brazil&#x27;s cuisine===
In Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, and Minas Gerais, feijoada is popular, especially as a Wednesday or Saturday lunch. Also consumed frequently is &quot;picadinho&quot; (literally, diced meat) and rice and beans. In Rio de Janeiro, besides the &quot;feijoada&quot;, a popular plate is any variation of grilled beef fillet, rice and beans, farofa, fried garlic and fried potatoes (&quot;batatas portuguesas&quot;), commonly called &quot;filé à Osvaldo Aranha&quot;. Seafood is very popular in coastal areas, as is roasted chicken (&quot;galeto&quot;). The strong Portuguese heritage also endowed the city with a taste for bolinhos de bacalhau (fried cod fritters), one of the most common street foods there.

In São Paulo, a typical dish is &quot;virado à paulista&quot;, made with rice, &quot;virado de feijão&quot; (similar to a &quot;tutu&quot;), sauteed kale, fried plantains or bananas and pork chops. São Paulo is also the home of pastel, a food consisting of thin pastry envelopes wrapped around assorted fillings, then deep-fried in vegetable oil. It is a common belief that they originated when Chinese and Japanese immigrants adapted the recipe of fried spring rolls to sell as snacks at weekly street markets. São Paulo is also known for &quot;parmegianna&quot;.

In Minas Gerais, the regional dishes include corn, pork, beans, chicken (including the very typical dish &quot;frango com quiabo&quot;, or chicken with okra), &quot;tutu de feijão&quot; (puréed beans mixed with cassava flour), and local soft-ripened traditional cheeses.

In Espírito Santo, there is significant Italian and German influence in local dishes, both savory and sweet. The state dish, though, is of Amerindian origin, called &quot;moqueca capixaba&quot;, which is a tomato and fish stew traditionally prepared in a &quot;panela de Goiabeiras&quot; (pot made of clay from Goiabeiras district in Vitória). Amerindian and Italian cuisine are the two main pillars of Capixaba cuisine. Seafood dishes, in general, are very popular in Espírito Santo, but unlike other Amerindian dishes, the use of olive oil is almost mandatory. Bobó de camarão, torta capixaba, and polenta are also very popular.

===Southern Brazil&#x27;s cuisine===

In Southern Brazil, due to the long tradition in livestock production and the heavy German immigration, red meat is the basis of the local cuisine.

Besides many of the pasta, sausage and dessert dishes common to continental Europe, &quot;churrasco&quot; is the term for a barbecue (similar to the Argentine or Uruguayan asado) which originated in southern Brazil. It contains a variety of meats which may be cooked on a purpose-built &quot;churrasqueira&quot;, a barbecue grill, often with supports for spits or skewers. Portable &quot;churrasqueiras&quot; are similar to those used to prepare the Argentine and Uruguayan asado, with a grill support, but many Brazilian &quot;churrasqueiras&quot; do not have grills, only the skewers above the embers. The meat may alternatively be cooked on large metal or wood skewers resting on a support or stuck into the ground and roasted with the embers of charcoal (wood may also be used, especially in the State of Rio Grande do Sul).

Since gaúchos were nomadic and lived off the land, they had no way of preserving food; the gauchos would gather together after butchering a cow, and skewer and cook the large portions of meat immediately over a wood-burning fire (not exactly as gauchos also produced charque). The slow-cooked meat basted in its own juices and resulted in tender, flavorful steaks. This style has inspired many contemporary churrascaria which emulates the cooking style where waiters bring large cuts of roasted meat to diners&#x27; tables and carve portions to order.

The &quot;chimarrão&quot; is the regional beverage, often associated with the gaúcho image.

The most typical dishes of Rio Grande do Sul cuisine are churrasco, chimarrão, arroz carreteiro, fried polenta, galeto, cuca, and sagu, among others. In the region there is a large consumption of wine, grape juice and white grape juice due to the south being the largest grape producer in the country, and artisanal cheeses and salamis. In the region, fig, grape and peach jellies and jams are also very common. One of the most famous is chimia. The consumption of vegetables preserved in water, vinegar, sugar, salt and spices, such as beets and cucumbers, is also typical of the Southern Region.

===Northeast Brazil&#x27;s cuisine===
The Northeastern Brazilian cuisine is heavily influenced by African cuisine from the coastal areas of Pernambuco to Bahia, as well as the eating habits of indigenous populations that lived in the region.

The &quot;vatapá&quot; is a Brazilian dish made from bread, shrimp, coconut milk, finely ground peanuts and palm oil mashed into a creamy paste.

The bobó de camarão is a dish made with cassava and shrimp (camarão).

The acarajé is a dish made from peeled black-eyed peas formed into a ball and then deep-fried in &quot;dendê&quot; (palm oil). Often sold as street food, it is served split in half and then stuffed with &quot;vatapá&quot; and &quot;caruru&quot;. Acarajé is typically available outside of the state of Bahia as well.

In other areas, more to the west or away from the coast, the plates are most reminiscent of the indigenous cuisine, with many vegetables being cultivated in the area since before the arrival of the Portuguese. Examples include &quot;baião de dois&quot;, made with rice and beans, dried meat, butter, &quot;queijo coalho&quot; and other ingredients. Jaggery is also heavily identified with the Northeast, as it is &quot;carne-de-sol&quot;, &quot;paçoca de pilão&quot;, and &quot;bolo de rolo&quot;.

Tapioca flatbreads or pancakes are also commonly served for breakfast in some states, with a filling of either coconut, cheese or condensed milk, butter, and certain meats. They can also be filled with dessert toppings as well.

===North Brazil&#x27;s cuisine===
The cuisine of this region, which includes the states of Acre, Amazonas, Amapá, Pará, Rondônia, Roraima, and Tocantins, is heavily influenced by indigenous cuisine. In the state of Pará, there are several typical dishes, including:

&quot;Pato no tucupi&quot; (duck in tucupi) – one of the most famous dishes from Pará. It is associated with the &quot;Círio de Nazaré&quot;, a local Roman Catholic celebration. The dish is made with &quot;tucupi&quot; (yellow broth extracted from cassava, after the fermentation process of the broth remained after the starch had been taken off, from the raw ground manioc root, pressed by a cloth, with some water; if added maniva, the manioc ground up external part, that is poisonous because of the cyanic acid, and so must be cooked for several days). After cooking, the duck is cut into pieces and boiled in &quot;tucupi&quot; sauce for some time. The &quot;jambu&quot; is boiled in water with salt, drained, and put on the duck. It is served with white rice and manioc flour and corn tortillas.

==Popular snacks==
Salgadinhos are small savoury snacks (literally &quot;salties&quot;). Similar to Spanish &quot;tapas&quot;, these are mostly sold in corner shops and are a staple at working-class and lower-middle-class family celebrations. There are many types of pastries:

** Pão de queijo (literally &quot;cheese bread&quot;), a typical Brazilian snack, is a small, soft roll made of manioc flour, eggs, milk, and minas cheese. It can be bought ready-made at a corner store or frozen and ready to bake in a supermarket and is gluten-free.
** Coxinha is a chicken croquette shaped like a chicken thigh.
** Pastéis (sing. &quot;pastel&quot;) are pastries with a wide variety of fillings. Similar to Spanish fried Empanadas but of Asian origin (and brought to Brazil by the Chinese diaspora and Japanese diaspora). Different shapes are used to tell apart the different flavours, the two most common shapes being half-moon (cheese) and square (meat). Size, flavour, and shape may vary greatly. They can be filled with various items, the most consumed being those filled with meat, cheese, chicken, heart of palm, without filling (called &quot;wind pastel&quot;), shrimp, chocolate with banana and cheese with guava paste.
** Bolinhos de bacalhau, fried cod fish pastries, found mainly in Rio de Janeiro, but also in other regions of the country.
** Empadas are snacks that resemble pot pies in a small scale. They can be filled with various items, the most popular being empadas filled with hearts of palm, shrimp, chicken and cheese.
** Quibe (also spelled as Kibe): extremely popular, it corresponds to the Levantine dish &quot;kibbeh&quot; and was brought to mainstream Brazilian culture by Syrian and Lebanese immigrants. It can be served baked, fried, or raw.
** Esfiha (also spelled as Esfirra): another Middle Eastern dish, despite being a more recent addition to Brazilian cuisine they are nowadays easily found everywhere, specially in Northeastern, Southern and Southeastern regions. They are pies/cakes with fillings like beef, mutton, cheese curd, or seasoned vegetables.

Other appetizers that can typically be found in Brazilian territory are: croquette, rissole, coxa-creme, cueca virada, bolinho de aipim (cassava pastries), among others.

==Popular dishes==


Brazilian cuisine is recognized around the world for its variety and quality. The city of São Paulo was chosen as the 7th main gastronomic destination in the world, for its recognized restaurants and bars. This Brazilian city comes after Rome, London, Paris, Dubai, Barcelona and Madrid. The city of São Paulo alone has more than 9,000 restaurants and bars.

* Rice and beans is an extremely popular dish, considered basic at a table; a tradition Brazil shares with several Caribbean nations. Brazilian rice and beans usually are cooked utilizing either lard or the nowadays more common edible vegetable fats and oils, in a variation of the Mediterranean sofrito locally called &quot;refogado&quot; which usually includes garlic in both recipes.
* In variation to rice and beans, Brazilians usually eat pasta (including spaghetti, lasagne, gnocchi, &quot;lamen&quot;, and &quot;bīfun&quot;), pasta salad, various dishes using either potato or manioc, and polenta as substitutions for rice, as well as salads, dumplings or soups of green peas, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, broad beans, , soybeans, lentils, &quot;moyashi&quot; (which came to Brazil due to the Chinese and Japanese tradition of eating its sprouts), &quot;azuki&quot;, and other legumes in substitution for the common beans cultivated in South America since Pre-Columbian times. It is more common to eat substitutions for daily rice and beans in festivities such as Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve (the tradition is lentils), as the follow-up of &quot;churrasco&quot; (mainly potato salad/carrot salad, called &quot;maionese&quot;, due to the widespread use of both industrial and home-made mayonnaise, which can include egg whites, raw onion, green peas, sweetcorn or even chayote squashes, and pronounced almost exactly as in English and French) and in other special occasions.
* Either way the basis of Brazilian daily cuisine is the starch (most often a cereal), legume, protein and vegetable combination. There is also a differentiation between vegetables of the &quot;verduras&quot; group, or greens, and the &quot;legumes&quot; group (no relation to the botanic concept), or non-green vegetables. 
* Churrasco is the main dish of southern Brazil. Over time, other regions of Brazil adopted churrasco and created other ways of making it. The restaurant specializing in churrasco is a churrascaria.

The typical Goiás chicken dish contains guariroba (a type of bitter palm) and pequi.
* is a typical dish of Parana State, Brazil. It is a slow-cooked meat stew prepared in a clay pot whose lid is sealed with a sort of clay made from wheat or cassava flour, hence the name (which means, literally, &quot;muddied&quot;). Traditionally, Barreado was made of buffalo meat, but nowadays it is usually made of beef, bacon, tomatoes, onion, cumin and other spices, placed in successive layers in a large clay urn, covered and then &quot;barreada&quot; (sealed) with a paste of ash and farinha (manioc flour), and then slowly cooked in a wood-fired oven for 12 to 18 hours. Nowadays pressure cookers and gas or electric ovens are more commonly used.
* Pizza is also extremely popular. It is usually made in a wood-fired oven with a thin, flexible crust, little or very little sauce, and a number of interesting toppings. While it is normal for a pizza to be thin and with few ingredients (the &quot;traditional&quot; Italian pizza), in Brazil it can have more than 100 flavors, savory (with ingredients such as , pepperoni, egg, tomato, poultry (either milled chicken meat or smoked turkey breast), catupiry, Canadian loin, tuna, onion and you can still find pizzas with more exotic flavors such as hamburger, stroganoff or sushi) or sweets (with flavors such as chocolate, banana with cinnamon, goiabada with cheese, fig, with scoops of ice cream, M&amp;Ms, etc.).Traditionally olive oil is poured over the pizza, but in some regions people enjoy ketchup, mustard and even mayonnaise on pizza.
* Cachorro quente is the Brazilian version of hot dogs. It is another dish that has been modified in Brazil, practically becoming a complete lunch. There, the most common version is the &quot;X-Tudo&quot; (in literal translation, cheese-everything), or &quot;Podrão&quot;, where, in addition to conventional bread and sausages with ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise, it is filled with a series of additional ingredients ranging from straw fries, grated Parmesan cheese, corn kernels, peas and olives to quail eggs.

Also noteworthy are:
* Special ethnic foods and restaurants that are frequently found in Brazil include Arab cuisine (Lebanese and Syrian), local variations of Chinese cuisine (nevertheless closer to the traditional than American Chinese cuisine), Italian cuisine, and Japanese cuisine (sushi bars are a constant in major metropolises, and people from Rio de Janeiro are more used to &quot;temaki&quot; than people from São Paulo, home of more than 70% of the Japanese diaspora in the country).

==Typical and popular desserts==


Brazil has a tradition of manufacturing jams and jellies from fresh tropical fruits, as Brazil is recognized worldwide as a country with great characteristics in food production, being one of the largest food exporters in the world. Brazilians inherited the taste and cultivation of sugar from the Portuguese who immigrated to Brazil. In the kitchens of the sugar farms, the wives of the farmers taught the subordinates how to properly mix the ingredients. This led to a growth in its commercialization in the Brazilian market, Portuguese recipes spread throughout the Brazilian colony and became part of the colonial food menu.

==Daily meals==

* Breakfast, the &quot;café-da-manhã&quot; (literally, &quot;morning coffee&quot;): every region has its own typical breakfast. It usually consists of a light meal, not uncommonly only a fruit or slice of bread paired with a cup of coffee. Traditional items include tropical fruits, typical cakes, crackers, bread, butter, cold cuts, cheese, requeijão, honey, jam, doce de leite, coffee (usually sweetened and with milk), juice, chocolate milk, or tea.
* Elevenses or brunch, the &quot;lanche-da-manhã&quot; (literally, &quot;morning snack&quot;): usually had between 9 and 11 am, consists of similar items as people have for breakfast.
* Midday dinner or lunch, the &quot;almoço&quot;: this is usually the biggest meal and the most common times range from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Traditionally, people will go back to their houses to have lunch with their families, although nowadays that is not possible for most people, in which case it is common to have lunch in groups at restaurants or cafeterias. Rice is a staple of the Brazilian diet, albeit it is not uncommon to eat pasta instead. It is usually eaten together with beans and accompanied by salad, protein (most commonly red meat or chicken) and a side dish, such as polenta, potatoes, corn, etc.
* Tea, the &quot;lanche-da-tarde&quot; or &quot;café-da-tarde&quot; (literally &quot;afternoon snack&quot; or &quot;afternoon coffee&quot;): it is a meal had between lunch and dinner, and basically everything people eat in the breakfast, they also eat in the afternoon snack. Nevertheless, fruits are less common.
* Night dinner or supper, the &quot;jantar&quot;: for most Brazilians, &quot;jantar&quot; is a light affair, while others dine at night. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pasta, hamburgers or hot-dogs, pizza or repeating lunchtime foods are the most common dishes.
* Late supper, the &quot;ceia&quot;: Brazilians eat soups, salads, pasta and what would be eaten at the elevenses if their &quot;jantar&quot; was a light one early at the evening and it is late at night or dawn. It is associated with Christmas and New Year&#x27;s Eve.

===Restaurant styles===
A simple and usually inexpensive option, which is also advisable for vegetarians, is &quot;comida a quilo&quot; or &quot;comida por quilo&quot; restaurants (literally &quot;food by kilo value&quot;), a buffet where food is paid for by weight. Another common style is the all-you-can-eat restaurant where customers pay a prix fixe. In both types (known collectively as &quot;self-services&quot;), customers usually assemble the dishes of their choice from a large buffet.

Rodízio is a common style of service, in which a prix fixe is paid, and servers circulate with food. This is common in churrascarias, pizzerias and sushi (Japanese cuisine) restaurants, resulting in an all-you-can-eat meat barbecue and pizzas of varied flavours, usually one slice being served at a time.

The regular restaurant where there is a specific price for each meal is called &quot;restaurante à la carte&quot;.

===Vegetarian===
Although many traditional dishes are prepared with meat or fish, it is not difficult to live on vegetarian food as well, at least in the mid-sized and larger cities of Brazil. There is a rich supply of all kinds of fruits and vegetables, and on city streets one can find cheese buns (&quot;pão de queijo&quot;); in some cities even the version made of soy.

In the 2000s, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília have gained several vegetarian and vegan restaurants. However outside big metropolises, vegetarianism is not very common in the country. Not every restaurant will provide vegetarian dishes and some seemingly vegetarian meals may turn out to include unwanted ingredients, for instance, using lard for cooking beans. Commonly &quot;meat&quot; is understood to mean &quot;red meat&quot;, so some people might assume a vegetarian eats fish and chicken. &quot;Comida por quilo&quot; and all-you-can-eat restaurants prepare a wide range of fresh dishes. Diners can more easily find food in such restaurants that satisfies dietary restrictions.

<doc id="147815" wikidata="Q5193357" url="?curid=147815" title="Cultural festival (Japan)">
<text>in Japan are annual open day events held by most schools, from nursery schools to universities at which their students display their artistic achievements. People who want to enter the school themselves or who are interested in the school may come to see what the schoolwork and atmosphere are like. Parents may also want to see what kind of work their children have been doing. The festivals are usually open to the public, especially at high schools and universities.

==Definition==
According to the curriculum guidelines of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, cultural festivals are part of special activities and are defined as &quot;events which aim to use the results of everyday learning to heighten motivation&quot;.

The cultural festivals are parts of regular lessons in elementary schools, junior high schools, and high schools, so the students are obligated to attend for graduation. In universities, the cultural festivals are placed as extracurricular activity, so attendance is not required.

Traditionally, most schools hold festivals on or around Culture Day (November 3), a Japanese national holiday. Normally it is held on a Saturday or Sunday; sometimes even both.

==Name==
&quot;Cultural festival&quot; (&quot;bunkasai&quot;) and &quot;university festival&quot; (&quot;daigaku-sai&quot;) are common nouns in Japanese, so particular names of cultural festivals depend on each school. For example, the festival at the University of Tokyo, Komaba Campus is named Komaba-sai.

===Names===
===Variations===
The school festivals of junior high schools and high schools may also sometimes be called , , or .

==Function==
Festivals are held to display the students&#x27; learning, but many people visit a festival as a recreational diversion. Alumni often take the opportunity to visit schools they once attended. Food is served, and often classrooms or gymnasiums are transformed into temporary restaurants or cafés. Dances, concerts and plays may be performed by individual volunteers or by various school clubs, such as the dance club, the literature club, the orchestra club, the band club, and the drama club.

Cultural festivals are intended to be a fun event, but are also the only opportunity each year for students to see what life is like in other schools. They are also intended to enrich people&#x27;s lives by increasing social interaction and fostering community ties.

==Cultural depictions==
Cultural festivals are frequently depicted in anime and manga. For example, the climax of &quot;A Silent Voice&quot; (2016) takes place at the &quot;bunkasai&quot;.

<doc id="147817" wikidata="Q377937" url="?curid=147817" title="Phoenix Park">
<text>The Phoenix Park () is a large urban park in Dublin, Ireland, lying west of the city centre, north of the River Liffey. Its perimeter wall encloses of recreational space. It includes large areas of grassland and tree-lined avenues, and since the 17th century has been home to a herd of wild fallow deer. The Irish Government is lobbying UNESCO to have the park designated as a World Heritage Site.

==History==

The park&#x27;s name is derived from the Irish &quot;fhionnuisce&quot;, meaning clear or still water.

After the Normans conquered Dublin and its hinterland in the 12th century, Hugh Tyrrel, 1st Baron of Castleknock, granted a large area of land, including what now comprises the Phoenix Park, to the Knights Hospitaller. They established an abbey at Kilmainham on the site now occupied by Royal Hospital Kilmainham. The knights lost their lands in 1537 following the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII of England. Eighty years later the lands reverted to the ownership of the King&#x27;s representatives in Ireland.

On the restoration of Charles II of England, his Viceroy in Dublin, the Duke of Ormond, established a royal hunting park on of the land in 1662. It contained pheasants and wild deer, making it necessary to enclose the entire area with a wall. The cost of building the park had amounted to £31,000 by 1669.

The park originally included the demesne of Kilmainham Priory south of the River Liffey. When the building of the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham commenced in 1680 for the use of veterans of the Royal Irish Army, the park was reduced to its present size, all of which is now north of the river. It was opened to the people of Dublin by the Earl of Chesterfield in 1745.

In the nineteenth century, the expanse of the park had become neglected. With management being taken over by the Commissioners of Woods and Forests, the renowned English Landscape architect, Decimus Burton, was retained to design an overall plan for the public areas of the park. The execution of the plan, which included new paths, gate-lodges (including the architecturally significant Chapelizod gate lodge ), levelling and tree planting, and relocating the Phoenix Column, took almost 20 years to complete. According to the park&#x27;s official site, 
:&quot;Burton&#x27;s involvement for nearly two decades represents the greatest period of landscape change since the Park&#x27;s creation by the Duke of Ormond.&quot;
In 1882, the park was the location for two politically inspired assassinations sometimes known as the Phoenix Park Murders. The Chief Secretary for Ireland (the British Cabinet minister with responsibility for Irish affairs), Lord Frederick Cavendish and the Under-Secretary for Ireland (chief civil servant), Thomas Henry Burke, were stabbed to death with surgical knives while walking from Dublin Castle. A small insurgent group called the Irish National Invincibles were responsible.

On 5 August 1933, Oscar Heron, Irish World War I flying ace of the British Royal Air Force, died in an accident at the park whilst taking part in a mock aerial combat for Irish Aviation Day.

During the Emergency thousands of tons of turf were transported from the bogs to Dublin and stored in high mounds along the main road of the park.

In October 2023 the park got its first ever shuttle bus service with the launch of Route 99, connecting the Park&#x27;s visitor center at Ashford Castle with Parkgate Street just outside the park, near Heuston Station.

==Features==

The park is split between three civil parishes: Castleknock to the northwest, Chapelizod to the south and St James&#x27; to the east. The last-named is mainly centred south of the River Liffey around St James&#x27; parish church. 

===Áras an Uachtaráin===

The residence of the president of Ireland, Áras an Uachtaráin, built in 1754, is located in the park. As the Viceregal Lodge, it was the official residence of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland until the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922.

===Dublin Zoo===

Dublin Zoo is one of Dublin&#x27;s main attractions. It houses more than 700 animals and tropical birds from around the world. The Zoological Society of Ireland was established in 1830 &quot;to form a collection of animals along the lines of London Zoo&quot;. It opened to the public on 1 September 1831 - making it the third oldest zoo in the world - with animals from the London Society. Within a year the zoo housed 123 species.

===Papal Cross===

The Papal Cross at the edge of Fifteen Acres was erected as a backdrop for the outdoor mass celebrated there by Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979, the first day of his pastoral visit to Ireland. The congregation numbered over one million, equal to Dublin&#x27;s population. The white Latin cross, which dominates its surroundings, is high and was built with steel girders. It was installed with some difficulty: after several attempts, the cross was eventually erected just a fortnight before the Pope arrived. When John Paul died in 2005, devotees gathered at the Papal Cross, praying and leaving flowers and other tokens of remembrance. Pope Francis celebrated mass here on the final day of his 2018 visit to Ireland.

===Monuments===

The Wellington Monument is a tall obelisk commemorating the victories of the Duke of Wellington. It is the largest obelisk in Europe and would have been even higher if the publicly subscribed funding had not run out. Designed by Robert Smirke, there are four bronze plaques cast from cannon captured at the Battle of Waterloo—three of which have pictorial representations of Wellington&#x27;s career while the fourth has an inscription at the base of the obelisk.

A second notable monument is the &quot;Phoenix Column&quot; (shown in the header photograph above), a Corinthian column carved from Portland Stone located centrally on Chesterfield Avenue, the main thoroughfare of the park, at the junction of Acres Road and the Phoenix, the main entrance to Áras an Uachtaráin. A contemporary account described it in the following terms:

&quot;About the centre of the park is a fluted column thirty feet high, with a phoenix on the capital, which was erected by the Earl of Chesterfield during his viceregality.&quot; (1747)

There is also a monument to commemorate Lord Cavendish and Thomas Henry Burke, who were killed in the park by the Irish National Invincibles. It is a 60 cm long cross, filled with a small amount of gravel and cut thinly into the grass.

===Deerfield Residence===
The Deerfield Residence (previously the &quot;Chief Secretary&#x27;s Lodge&quot;), originally built in 1776 was the former residence of the Chief Secretary for Ireland and before that was the Park Bailiff&#x27;s lodge. It has been the official residence of the United States Ambassador to Ireland since February 1927, and was until the early 1960s the Embassy of the United States in Dublin.

===Phoenix Park Visitor Centre and Ashtown Castle===
The oldest building in the park is Ashtown Castle, a restored medieval tower house dating from the 15th century. Restoration began in 1989 and it is located beside the visitor centre which houses interpretive displays on the 5,500 years of park and area history.

===People&#x27;s Gardens===

The gardens, located close to the Parkgate Street entrance, comprise an area of , and were re-opened in 1864. These gardens were initially established in 1840 as the Promenade Grounds. They display Victorian horticulture, including ornamental lakes, children&#x27;s playground, picnic area and bedding schemes. A statue is in the gardens dedicated to executed Easter Rising leader Seán Heuston. There is a plaque in honour of the Irish sculptor Jerome Connor on Infirmary Road, overlooking the gardens which he frequently visited. The opening hours are 8.00 am until dusk. Closing times vary during the year.

===Magazine Fort===
The Magazine Fort in the southeast of the park marks the location where Phoenix Lodge was built by Sir Edward Fisher in 1611. In 1734 the house was demolished when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset directed that a powder magazine be provided for Dublin. An additional wing was added to the fort in 1801 for troops. It was the scene of the Christmas Raid in 1939.

The magazine fort has been satirically immortalised in a jingle by Jonathan Swift who wrote:

&quot;&quot;Now&#x27;s here&#x27;s a proof of Irish sense,&quot; &quot;Here Irish wit is seen,&quot;
&quot;When nothing&#x27;s left that&#x27;s worth defence,&quot;
&quot;We build a Magazine&quot;.&quot;

===Other places of interest===

* In the southwestern corner of the park is an area known as the Furry Glen which has a series of short walks centred on a small lake with birds, plants and wildlife. The jay, normally a rather shy bird, is common and conspicuous here.
* State Guest House, Farmleigh, adjoins the park to the northwest.
* Headquarters of the Garda Síochána, the police service of Ireland, are located in the park.
* St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital, originally the Royal Hibernian Military School established in 1769, the building was subsequently developed as a hospital up until 1948. In 1964 the hospital became a facility for older people and today primarily provides accommodation to dependent older persons.
* National Ambulance Service College is located at Saint Mary&#x27;s Hospital on the Chapelizod side of the park. This building dates from 1766 and was formerly the Hibernian Military School. Ordnance Survey Ireland is located in Mountjoy House near the Castleknock Gate. The house was built in 1728 and was originally known as Mountjoy Barracks as it quartered the mounted escort of the Lord Lieutenant who resided in the Vice-Regal Lodge (now Áras an Uachtaráin).
* Adjoining the park to the southeast is the Irish Defence Forces&#x27; McKee Barracks. Built in 1888 as Marlborough Barracks it once housed 822 military horses.
* Ratra House at the back of the Aras, was the home of Civil Defence Ireland since the organisation was established in 1950 until 2006 when the headquarters was decentralised to Roscrea, County Tipperary. Named Ratra House by the first president of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, who retired to the house in 1945 from his presidency. He named it after his native Ratra Park in Frenchpark, County Roscommon where he had done much of his writing. Built in 1876, Winston Churchill lived there from age two to six.
* Grangegorman Military Cemetery lies just outside the walls of the park on Blackhorse Avenue.
* The park also contains several sports grounds for football, hurling, soccer, cricket and polo.
* Bohemian Football Club was founded in the Gate Lodge beside the North Circular Road entrance in 1890. The club played its first games in the park&#x27;s Polo Grounds.
* At Conyngham Road, near the South Circular Road junction, the regular wall takes on an unusual arch shape before levelling out again. This marks the point where the Liffey Bridge enters the park via a rail tunnel that continues on beneath the Wellington Monument. It is used regularly for goods traffic and Passenger services. It was used during the Second World War for storing emergency supplies of food. Iarnród Éireann opened the tunnel for commuter train traffic on 21 November 2016.
==Environment==
There are 351 identified plant species in the park; three of these are rare and protected. The park has retained almost all of its old grasslands and woodlands and also has rare examples of wetlands. Deer were introduced into the park in the 1660s; the current 400–450 fallow deer descend from the original herd. 30% of the park is covered by trees, mainly broadleaf.

A birdwatch survey in 2007–2008 found 72 species of bird including common buzzard, Eurasian sparrowhawk, common kestrel and Eurasian jay. The great spotted woodpecker, Ireland&#x27;s newest breeding bird has been seen in the park several times, but no sighting was recorded in 2015, and the long-eared owl has been confirmed as a breeding species in 2012.

The park also holds several brooks, and tributaries of the River Liffey.

In July and August 2006, the Minister for Health and Children, Mary Harney, issued three orders exempting two new community nursing units, to be built at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in the park, from the usual legally required planning permission, despite the Phoenix Park being a designated and protected national monument. A statement from the Department of Health and Children said the decision was made because of what it called the department&#x27;s &quot;emergency response to the accident and emergency crisis at the time&quot;, although the nursing units, in use since 2008, are mainly for geriatric care.

In a 2009 conservative management plan for the park, the Office of Public Works commented, &quot;... the erection, without the necessity of resorting to normal planning procedures, of two major developments in St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital illustrates the vulnerability of the Phoenix Park to internal development, which impacts significantly on the essential character of the park and its unique value as a historic designed landscape.&quot; In a section entitled &quot;Pressures and Threats on the Park&quot;, subsection &quot;Planning Issues&quot;, the document expressed concern that, &quot;Without appropriate planning designation, there is a risk that development can take place which is not in line with the co-ordinated vision of this Plan.&quot; The document warned of similar risks to the integrity of the park such as &quot;uncoordinated building and construction...and the current condition of certain historic buildings such as the Magazine Fort, the farm buildings below St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital and Mountjoy House in the Ordnance Survey Complex.&quot;

On 18 July 2022, a weather station in the park set a new record high temperature for July in Ireland of 33.0 °C.

==Events==

===Motor racing===

Motor racing first took place in the park in 1903 when the Irish Gordon Bennett Race Speed Trials were held on the main straight for both cars and motorcycles. This was followed in 1929 by the Irish International Grand Prix; the first of three Irish motor racing Grand Prix. Racing took place from 1932 until the beginning of the Second World War in 1939 and was revived again in 1949 with a sprint on the &quot;Oldtown&quot; circuit followed the next year by a full racing meeting again and has been used virtually continuously until today. Over the years seven different circuits have been used, two of which are named after the famous Ferrari World Champion racing driver Mike Hawthorn.

====Phoenix Park Motor Races====
After the Grand Prix events, motor racing continued at the park through the 1980s and 1990s and up to 2012, with many events broadcast live on RTÉ. It featured many drivers including Eddie Jordan, Eddie Irvine and Tommy Byrne.

===Great Ireland Run===
The Great Ireland Run, a 10 km running competition, has been held annually each April in the park since 2003. It includes races for professional runners and the public and the 2010 edition attracted over 11,000 participants. Athletes such as Sonia O&#x27;Sullivan and Catherina McKiernan are among the race&#x27;s past winners.

===Concerts===

Music concerts have been performed in the park by such acts as Coldplay, Duran Duran, Robbie Williams, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ian Brown, Justice, Kanye West, Arcade Fire, Tom Waits, Snow Patrol, Florence and the Machine, Swedish House Mafia, Snoop Dogg, Tinie Tempah, Calvin Harris, the Stone Roses and Ed Sheeran.

====Phoenix Park free festivals====
Ubi Dwyer organised one-day free events between 1977 and 1980. As &quot;International Times&quot; reported &quot;The Hollow in the Phoenix Park spun and danced to the rhythms of the World Peace Band, Free Booze, the Mod Quad Band, Frazzle, Speed, Stryder, Axis, Tudd, Skates to name but a few. The whole thing was organised by gentle Ubi Dwyer who was formerly involved in the Windsor affair of rock and the rest in England. Certainly, the Irish version was pleasantly good-humoured even if the amplification was too much for squares. A few chappies near the bandstand almost whipped themselves to death with their long hair as they responded to the bio-rhythms of the scene.&quot; U2 played at the 1978 festival.

===Phoenix Cricket Club===
Phoenix Cricket Club is the oldest cricket club in Ireland. Founded in 1830 by John Parnell, the father of Charles Stewart Parnell, the club is located in the park.

===Exhibition===
In April 2017 the Hearsum Collection, in collaboration with The Royal Parks of London and Ireland&#x27;s Office of Public Works, mounted an exhibition at Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park entitled &quot;Parks, Our Shared Heritage: The Phoenix Park, Dublin &amp; The Royal Parks, London&quot;, demonstrating the historical links between Richmond Park (and other Royal Parks in London) and Phoenix Park. This exhibition was also displayed at the Mall Galleries in London in July and August 2017.

==Popular culture==

The park is featured prominently in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot; and tangentially in &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

In general, Dublin postal districts on the Northside are odd numbers, while Southside codes are even. One exception is the Phoenix Park, which is on the Northside but forms part of even-numbered districts, the majority of which is in Dublin 8, and also includes an area bordering Chapelizod in the South-West that falls under the Dublin 20 postcode between the Chapelizod and Knockmaroon Gate Lodges (encompassing the St Mary&#x27;s Campus).

==Park rangers==
The park has its own piece of legislation the Phoenix Park Act, 1925 which includes giving powers to park rangers to remove and arrest of offenders who disobey its bye-laws, which include &quot;No person shall act contrary to public morality in the park&quot;.

Chief rangers of the park have included:
*Marcus Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon (1668–1669)
*Thomas Coningsby, 1st Earl Coningsby (1696–1702)
*Henry Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne (1698–1751) (joint)
*George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville (1736–1785) (joint)
*John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier (1734–1750)
*Nathaniel Clements (1751–1777)
*James Trail (1806–1808)
*Sir Charles Saxton, 2nd Baronet (1808–1812)

<text>Air Florida was an American low-cost carrier that operated under its own brand from 1972 to 1984. During the period from 1972 to 1978 Air Florida was an intrastate airline. Until a high-profile 1982 aircraft crash in Washington DC, Air Florida was considered an early success story of U.S. airline deregulation, having expanded rapidly from its original Florida network, including internationally to Europe and Latin America. After the crash, the airline struggled for over two and a half years before finally succumbing to bankruptcy in 1984.

After being grounded for three months in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, Air Florida flew again for 10 months in 1984 and 1985 under contract to Midway Airlines using the brand &quot;Midway Express&quot;, with Midway selling the tickets and doing the marketing. In 1985 it was sold to Midway.

==History==
===Intrastate origin===
Air Florida was based at Miami International Airport. Air Florida was initially organized as an intrastate airline by a group including Miami native Eli Timoner as chairman, Bill Spohrer as president, Jim Woodman as VP, Robert Bussey as Secretary and Reed Cleary as chief pilot. The inspiration was Pacific Southwest Airlines, the long-established California intrastate airline. Spohrer came from Convair 990 operator APSA, which may account for Air Florida&#x27;s initial focus on a 149-seat Convair 990 as an aircraft, to be leased from Modern Air Transport. Later the focus changed to an Eastern Air Lines DC-8 before settling on a Pan Am Boeing 707 purchased for $1.1mm. The inability to settle on an aircraft delayed Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval and thus start of the carrier.

FAA approval was needed for operational authority. As an intrastate airline, Air Florida had no need to obtain the approval of the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the now-defunct federal agency that then tightly economically regulated almost all US air transportation (e.g. as to where an airline could fly, how much it could charge, etc). Prior to 1972, there was no economic regulation of intrastate carriers in Florida. Such regulation started October 1, 1972. Air Florida, by first flying September 27, was grandfathered, but thereafter, so long as it remained an intrastate airline, Air Florida would be regulated by the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) as to matters like route entry and fares.

Ted Griffin, a former marketing director of Eastern Air Lines, became operational head from mid 1972, eventually taking the president title. The airline operated its first flights on September 27, 1972, offering twice-daily service in Florida between Miami (MIA), Orlando (MCO) and St. Petersburg (PIE) on &quot;triangle&quot; routings of MIA-MCO-PIE-MIA and MIA-PIE-MCO-MIA with a one way introductory fare of $12.00. By May 15, 1973, the airline acquired three Lockheed Electra turboprop aircraft, replacing the Boeing 707.

===Acker group investment===

Air Florida was unprofitable for most of its intrastate existence. In 1972 it attempted a $3.2mm initial public offering, but the market was unfavorable and it had to withdraw. The airline was acquired by a Timoner-controlled publicly listed company, Investment Property Builders (IPB) as a way to give it a stock price. IPB became Air Florida System, Inc, explaining why Air Florida&#x27;s holding company had a 1955 date of formation. In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Timoner and a Swiss bank (among others) of manipulating the IPB stock price in 1971. The airline was chronically underfunded and unable to upgrade to jets, which caused some travelers to avoid Air Florida, leaving Timoner scrambling for funds.

In December 1976, an investor group led by Ed Acker, previously a Braniff executive but at that time at an insurance company, led a recapitalization of Air Florida. Acker&#x27;s group put in $1.5mm, some creditors agreed to take stock in exchange for $2mm in debt, other creditors agreed to a standstill, allowing Air Florida to acquire DC-9 jets. Three DC-9s were financed by Carl Lindner&#x27;s American Financial Corp, which bought them from Air Canada and leased them to Air Florida in exchange for low-priced stock and warrants that, in early 1980, provided Lindner with a substantial payoff. In mid-1977, Acker became CEO and chairman, Timoner became president and COO, and Ted Griffin left the company. By February 1978, a turnaround was evident. The fleet comprised five DC-9s, with three more on the way. A company tag-line emphasized the change: &quot;All jet. All the time.&quot; September 1977 passenger traffic was up 400+%, in October up 600+%, for November 1977 thru January 1978, up over 350%. Year over year call center volume increased over 100%.

===Post intrastate===
In 1978, Congress passed the Airline Deregulation Act, which phased out Federal economic regulation of the airline industry starting in 1979. The CAB relaxed its stance in advance of the effective date and allowed Air Florida to fly to Washington, DC, and, in the Bahamas, Rock Sound and Nassau by year-end 1978.

No longer confined to its home state, Air Florida under Ed Acker was aggressive:
* Air Florida grew quickly, to the Northeast US, Caribbean, Central America and Europe. European routes required long-haul aircraft, such as DC-8s or DC-10s. By January 1981, the fleet included four DC-9s, 21 737s and a DC-10. The financial turnaround continued, with 1979 and 1980 showing solid profits. 1980 revenues were over five times those of 1978 (see nearby table).
* Air Florida initiated three attempted takeovers of other carriers, two of them materially larger than Air Florida. This was not unusual for the time. Frank Lorenzo&#x27;s Texas Air was another small carrier that made bids for much larger airlines in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

On August 27, 1981, Ed Acker left Air Florida to take up the CEO position at Pan Am, saying that Cunard told him the position of captain of the Titanic was no longer available, so he was seeking a comparable challenge. Timoner again became chairman and CEO.


===Flight 90 and aftermath===
On January 13, 1982, Air Florida suffered a fatal crash in Washington DC, with a Boeing 737 aircraft hitting a bridge and ending in the Potomac River. Video of rescue efforts were widely broadcast, as was an iconic image of the broken tail of the Air Florida aircraft being pulled from the river. Air Florida reservations dried up. Later in the year the National Transportation Safety Board investigation blamed the crash on the Air Florida pilots.

Air Florida&#x27;s fortunes turned for the worse even before the crash. A substantial financial loss in the fourth quarter of 1981 was driven by fierce fare wars, including by Pan Am now run by Ed Acker. Heavy losses continued into 1982, but even after the crash, Air Florida management continued to consider mergers, this time with Braniff, in distress as it headed towards a May 1982 bankruptcy and grounding. The economy was in trouble and airlines particularly so. In July, Timoner suffered a debilitating stroke, with Donald Lloyd-Jones becoming CEO. Lloyd-Jones was an American Airlines veteran who lost the heir-apparent competition at American to Bob Crandall and had joined Air Florida as president.

===Two years of struggle===
Central to Lloyd-Jones&#x27;s recovery strategy was shrinking Air Florida. From June 1982 to May 1984 the fleet dropped from 29 to 11.
* Air Florida shrank but did not simplify. It continued to fly to Europe, despite financials that showed Europe to be the worst of the three Air Florida geographies: US, Europe and Latin America (Latin American operations were consistently close-to-break-even or better). Indeed, even after it collapsed, the first operation Air Florida sought to resuscitate was its London route, yet it was the domestic 737 operation that survived the bankruptcy.
* It continued to fly Northeast to Florida routes in the face of brutal competition from Eastern and Pan Am – Eastern because New York to Miami was its marquee route since before WWII, a source of profits for decades. Pan Am for its part had bought National Airlines in 1979, which for decades shared that New York to Miami route with Eastern. Therefore that market was also important to Pan Am. But as much as Eastern and Pan Am lost on such routes, it did not have the proportionate impact on them as it did on Air Florida. As Eastern CEO Frank Borman noted in 1982, &quot;we bled seriously, but only from a vein, [Air Florida] bled from an artery&quot;.

High 1982 losses led Air Florida&#x27;s outside accountants to qualify that year&#x27;s financials with a going concern warning; they had reason to doubt Air Florida&#x27;s survival. Interest expense ballooned to $35mm in 1982 from $10mm in 1980, a serious problem for a shrinking company that had never generated an operating profit of more than $10mm. From 4Q83, the company did not meet its obligation of filing CAB reports and when it collapsed Air Florida had $27mm in accounts receivable – amounts uncollected from travel agencies, credit card processors, other airlines and so forth. This was a source of post-bankruptcy funding. Air Florida main lender declared a default on loans in July 1983, almost a year before the carrier Florida ceased operation. Headlines remained negative, as Air Florida tried increasingly creative ways to remain funded. Towards the end, the company funded itself in part by not making required payments to the employee credit union, payroll taxes and medical insurance.

===Chapter 11, Midway Express and sale===

In May 1984, Lloyd-Jones resigned abruptly after losing the confidence of the board. He was replaced by board chair, J.R.K. Tinkle. On July 3, the airline ceased operations and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The airline said it would fly again, but made little progress. Then, a week before a court deadline of late August, Tinkle approached Midway and a deal came together quickly, despite Midway&#x27;s then tight-focus on business travelers (including 100% first-class seating), a different target market from Air Florida&#x27;s clientele. Midway wasn&#x27;t in the best shape either. It made a substantial loss in 1983 and would make an even bigger loss in 1984. Tinkle said he picked Midway for its &quot;experienced personnel&quot;, &quot;$40mm in cash&quot; and &quot;a route system that has been very well run&quot;. It certainly had the cash to get Air Florida operating again. Attractions for Midway included Air Florida&#x27;s slots at New York LaGuardia and Washington National airports, and winter demand to offset the winter lull in Midway&#x27;s primarily east-west system.

Air Florida would fly 737s under contract to Midway under the brand-name &quot;Midway Express&quot; until the CAB gave permanent approval (it initially provided temporary approval) for a Midway acquisition, with Midway selling the seats. The deal was nominally $53mm, $35mm of which paid the FAA for three 737s (the FAA administered a federal aircraft loan guarantee program that had financed the aircraft). Many parties objected to the bankruptcy court, but Midway had the only offer so the judge approved it, putting 300 Air Florida employees back to work. In the end, Midway didn&#x27;t need to pay for the aircraft, instead a lessor bought them and leased them back to Midway. Midway supervised Air Florida under the eye of the court and provided it with working capital. On October 15, 1984, Air Florida dba Midway Express was back in the sky. Eastern sued to stop the deal. It had a prior deal with the Air Florida bankruptcy estate for the airport slots, but the FAA rejected it saying the slots weren&#x27;t airline property. Eastern said Midway Express was just a workaround to allow Midway to buy the slots, but the court noted the fact that Air Florida was back in operation was a pretty big difference.

In July 1985, Midway committed the cash and preferred stock it promised for the deal and on August 14, 1985, the bankruptcy court gave final approval to the sale of Air Florida to Midway, which Midway initially constituted as a subsidiary called &quot;Midway Airlines (1984)&quot;, painting the aircraft in Midway livery. In its 1985 annual report, Midway disclosed that Midway Express made a profit of $1.4mm in the period prior to acquisition.

==Legacy==

Air Florida was viewed as kind of cautionary story in how deregulation could go wrong. It was the &quot;little airline that could&quot; and a &quot;skyrocket&quot; of an airline that outgrew its management, had a terrible accident and was punished for it. Thomas Petzinger in the classic book &quot;Hard Landing&quot; about the airline industry of the era, leaves a similar impression, telescoping the period from Flight 90 to collapse in just a paragraph, making it sound like collapse occurred only months later.

Air Florida, in the form of Midway Express, had a material impact on Midway. After poor 1983 and 1984 results, Midway&#x27;s management changed in 1985 and new management restructured the airline. The new Midway was more like Midway Express than the all-business class airline it had been in 1984. In fact, the airline would eventually become all economy class, like Midway Express. Midway added more leisure destinations (like Phoenix and Las Vegas) to accompany Florida and by 1987 the 737 fleet increased to 12. The old Air Florida maintenance base in Miami became Midway&#x27;s maintenance base. This version of Midway did better than the old. Midway broke even on an operating basis in 1985 and made a solid profit in 1986, 1987 and 1988.

==Air Florida Commuter==

Air Florida Commuter was not an airline, but a system of affiliated commuter and regional air carriers that fed traffic into Air Florida&#x27;s hubs. In an arrangement commonly known as code-sharing, each airline painted their aircraft in Air Florida colors and their flights were listed in reservations systems as Air Florida flights. Air Miami became the first affiliate in 1980 and over a dozen other airlines became part of the system, including: Air Sunshine, Marco Island Airways, Florida Airlines, Key Air, Southern International, Skyway Airlines, North American Airlines, National Commuter Airlines, Gull Air, Pompano, Finair, Slocum, Atlantic Gulf, Skyway of Ocala and others. As Air Florida became financially strapped, the commuter system was dismantled in early 1984.

==Destinations==
Some of the above destinations in the U.S. and the Bahamas were served by commuter air carriers operating Air Florida Commuter service with prop and turboprop aircraft via respective code sharing agreements.

Air Florida also served Belize City, Belize; Charleston, South Carolina; Chicago (Midway Airport), Illinois; Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW Airport), Texas; Düsseldorf, Germany; Frankfurt, Germany; Houston (Hobby Airport), Texas; Paris, France; Madrid, Spain; Providence, Rhode Island; Providenciales, Turk and Caicos Islands; St. Petersburg, Florida; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Savannah, Georgia; and Zürich, Switzerland with mainline jet service at various times during its existence. In addition, Air Florida Commuter served Lakeland, Florida in early 1983.

==Fleet==
When Air Florida ceased operations in July 1984, it was operating the following aircraft:

===Retired fleet===
Air Florida operated the following aircraft prior to its demise:
*BAC One-Eleven (operated by British Island Airways in Europe to provide passenger feed for Air Florida&#x27;s transatlantic flights. The aircraft had &quot;Air Florida&quot; titles in addition to their British Island Airways titles)
*Boeing 707-320
*Boeing 727-100
*Boeing 727-200
*McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15RC
*Lockheed L-188C Electra
==Accidents and incidents==
*On August 10, 1980, Air Florida Flight 4, with 35 people on board, operated by a Boeing 737 from Miami International Airport to Key West International Airport, was taken over by a hijacker, who demanded to be flown to Cuba. He later surrendered in Havana.
*Three days later, on August 13, 1980, Air Florida Flight 707, another Boeing 737, flying the opposite direction of Flight 4, with 74 people on board, was hijacked by seven people. They demanded to be taken to Cuba, but later surrendered.
*On September 22, 1981, Air Florida Flight 2198, operated by a McDonnell-Douglas DC-10 carrying 71 occupants, suffered an uncontained engine failure after departing Miami, the aircraft returned to the airport and made a safe landing, no one was hurt.
*On January 13, 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed very shortly after takeoff from Washington National Airport due to atmospheric icing and pilot error, killing 74 of the 79 people on board, injuring four of the five survivors, and killing four people on the Interstate 395 14th Street Bridge, which the Boeing 737-200 crashed into before plunging into the ice covered Potomac River.
*On February 2, 1982, Air Florida Flight 710, a Boeing 737-200 with 77 people on board from Miami International to Key West International was hijacked. The hijacker wanted to be taken to Cuba, but he later surrendered.
*On July 7, 1983, Air Florida Flight 8 with 47 people on board was flying from Fort Lauderdale International Airport to Tampa International Airport. One of the passengers handed a note to one of the flight attendants, saying that he had a bomb, and telling them to fly the plane to Havana, Cuba. He revealed a small athletic bag, which he opened, and inside was an apparent explosive device. The airplane was diverted to Havana-José Martí International Airport, and the hijacker was taken into custody by Cuban authorities.

<text>The Under Secretary&#x27;s Lodge was formerly the Dublin residence of the British Under-Secretary for Ireland &quot;(the British Administration&#x27;s chief civil servant)&quot;. After the creation of the Irish Free State in 1922, the office of Under Secretary disappeared.

The residence was rented by the Irish Free State to the Vatican for use as the Apostolic Nunciature &quot;(papal embassy)&quot;. The Lodge was vacated by the Papal Nuncio in the mid 1970s, when he moved to a new purpose-built nunciature on the Navan Road in Dublin. It was intended to turn the Lodge into a Taoiseach&#x27;s residence &quot;(residence of the prime minister of Ireland)&quot;. But after some years&#x27; delay, it was decided that the Lodge (in a politically unappealing Georgian style) was in too poor a state of repair due to dry rot to be converted and so was demolished.

A preservable medieval tower house was found to be at the centre of the demolished Georgian building. It has been restored, and as Ashtown Castle it is used as an interpretative centre. Tours of Áras an Uachtaráin &quot;(residence of the President of Ireland)&quot; begin from the centre every Saturday.

While it served as the Apostolic Nunciature, one of its most famous residents was Giovanni Montini, later Pope Paul VI, who worked as a young diplomat there.</text><links>

<text>The Steward&#x27;s Lodge is a house which was originally part of the Farmleigh estate, alongside the Phoenix Park in Dublin. It is sometimes used as a residence by the Taoiseach of Ireland.

==History==
===Origins===
The Steward&#x27;s Lodge was originally built in the grounds of Farmleigh house – an 18th-century estate which was formerly owned by members of the Guinness family. Originally accessible within the grounds of the estate, the lodge was subsequently separated from Farmleigh during refurbishment works.

===Taoiseach&#x27;s residence===
There is no official residence of the Taoiseach, with each Taoiseach residing in either their own homes, or in an apartment in Dublin. In the 1970s, plans were made to turn the former Apostolic Nunciature (formerly the Under Secretary&#x27;s Lodge) in the Phoenix Park into an official residence. However, the plans fell through and the Georgian building was subsequently demolished.

In 2006, it was announced by the Office of Public Works that the Steward&#x27;s Lodge had been renovated, at a cost of nearly €600,000. It was speculated that the house would become the official private residence of the Taoiseach after the 2007 general election, and any official engagements would be carried out in the nearby Farmleigh or Government Buildings.

There was political sensitivity at government level about the project, with some concerned that it could be depicted as a lavish &quot;perk&quot; for the Taoiseach. In 2005, a spokeswoman for Bertie Ahern stated he had no interest in using it, and he remained resident in his private home in Drumcondra in Dublin. In 2008, it was reported that Brian Cowen might use it as his official residence. Media reports suggest that Garda concerns for the Taoiseach&#x27;s security precluded him from continuing to reside in his own Dublin home in the city centre. Cowen did not formally reside in the Steward&#x27;s Lodge, preferring to return to his family home in County Offaly, but he did use it &quot;from time to time&quot;. In 2011, it was reported that the then Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, would make use of the residence, however he used it very rarely. Former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar resided in his private apartment in Castleknock, but used the Lodge for occasional parties at his own expense. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland it was used as a residence by Varadkar due to its teleconferencing facilities.

In July 2024, it was reported that government security advisors were insisting that the Taoiseach and his family move into Steward&#x27;s Lodge for their security, following a number of anti-immigration disturbances and an increase in the number of attacks on politicians internationally.

<text>Celia Larkin, also known as Cecilia Larkin, is a former Irish civil servant and was the partner of the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Since 2020 she has worked for Limerick City and County Council as Limerick City Centre Revitalisation Manager.

==Relationship with Bertie Ahern==
Their relationship ended in April 2003. Ahern is separated, though not divorced, from his wife Miriam. There was some controversy in the media at Ahern&#x27;s public presentation of his partner. No other European Heads of Government had (at that time) similarly presented their partner at official engagements. Ahern was accused of hypocrisy in being associated with a woman other than his wife while being a practising Massgoer. The media discovered the couple had broken up when Larkin failed to co-host a diplomatic dinner for the visiting German Bundespräsident, although her name, along with that of the Taoiseach, was featured on the invitations.

Larkin, during the period of her relationship with Ahern, regularly acted as his consort. She also occasionally engaged in civic functions in a private capacity. For example, she launched a high speed ferry, the M.V. Jonathan Swift for Irish Ferries.

On 2 February 2008, it emerged at the Mahon Tribunal that a house was bought by Larkin in 1993, with money donated to Ahern&#x27;s constituency organisation in Drumcondra. There was no documentation to back up this loan to Larkin or to prove around IR£30,000 in other expenditure from this account. Dublin businessman Tim Collins, has denied that Ahern was joint holder of the so-called BT account from which Larkin was loaned IR£30,000 without documentation to describe the loan agreement. Tim Collins denied that the BT account referred to Bertie and Tim, even though he operated a joint account with Des Richardson known as the DT account.

==Other activities==
Since parting with Ahern, she has expanded her chain of beauty salons, and has appeared on reality television, in an RTÉ show &quot;The Restaurant&quot;.

In July 2005, Larkin was appointed to the board of the new National Consumer Agency, a government funded consumer watchdog.

As a mature student Larkin has graduated from the University of Limerick with a first class honors degree in Politics and International relations, graduating top of her class. She completed a post graduate course in University College London.

In 2016 she began worked for Thames Water in their HQ at Reading as External Affairs Manager. Now known as Cecilia Larkin, in 2020 she was appointed by Limerick City and County Council as Limerick City Centre Revitalisation Manager.

<doc id="147829" wikidata="Q1211716" url="?curid=147829" title="The Bounty (1984 film)">
<text>The Bounty is a 1984 British epic historical drama film directed by Roger Donaldson. It depicts the voyage and mutiny of HMS &quot;Bounty&quot;, with Robert Bolt&#x27;s screenplay adapting the 1972 book &quot;Captain Bligh and Mr. Christian&quot; by Richard Hough. It stars Mel Gibson as Fletcher Christian and Anthony Hopkins as William Bligh, with supporting roles played by Laurence Olivier, Daniel Day-Lewis, Liam Neeson, Bernard Hill and Edward Fox.

&quot;The Bounty&quot; began production in late 1978 under director David Lean as a long-time passion project, but multiple complications, including a prohibitively high budget and screenwriter Robert Bolt suffering from a heart attack, led to a period of development hell that ended with the hiring of newcomer director Donaldson. Filming took place primarily on-location in Donaldson&#x27;s home country of New Zealand, French Polynesia and England.

The film was made by Dino De Laurentiis Productions and Bounty Productions Ltd. and distributed by Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment in the UK, and Orion Pictures Corporation internationally. It premiered on 4 May 1984 and received generally positive reviews, with praise for Hopkins&#x27; portrayal of Bligh, and was noted by critics and historians as being a more historically accurate depiction of the mutiny than previous depictions, though reactions to Gibson&#x27;s performance were more polarized. &quot;The Bounty&quot; was entered into the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Palme d’Or.

== Plot ==

The court of inquiry of Commanding Lieutenant William Bligh for the loss of to mutineers begins. Via flashbacks, &quot;Bounty&quot; sets out from Portsmouth, England on 23 December 1787, on an expedition to Tahiti to gather breadfruit pods for transplantation in the Caribbean, Bligh electing to sail the ship west round the tip of South America to use the expedition to fulfill an ambition to circumnavigate the globe. After thirty-one days, the attempt to round Cape Horn fails due to harsh weather, and the ship is obliged to take the longer eastern route. Bligh replaces Fryer with his friend Fletcher Christian as second-in-command. Seaman James Valentine dies.

Arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh finds that due to the delays, the wind is against them for a quick return journey and they must stay on the island for four months longer than planned. Many of the weary crew, relieved to land, eventually develop a taste for the pleasures that island life offers, especially the native women; Christian immerses himself in the native culture, learning the language, submitting to Tahiti tattooing, making his relationship with Bligh tense. Three crew members, one of them, Charles Churchill, desert the ship, intent on staying on the island. Bligh hunts the men down and has them flogged. Huggan dies. When the ship leaves Tahiti, Fletcher is forced to leave his pregnant native lover, Mauatua, behind. The resumption of naval discipline on the return voyage turns Bligh into not willing to tolerate any disobedience whatsoever. He insists that the ship is filthy and orders the crew to clean up several times a day. Bligh subjects the crew to pressure, creating an atmosphere of tension. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for tongue-lashings, especially when he suggests to go around Cape Horn again.

Christian considers constructing a raft to escape; playing on his resentment against Bligh&#x27;s treatment of both him and the men, Ned Young persuades Christian to take the ship by force. After unsuccessfully warning the stubborn Bligh, Christian decides to take the ship and cast Bligh adrift without any killing. Bligh is roused from his bed and taken to the deck, and he is, along with those considered loyal to him, forced into a longboat, minimally supplied, and cast adrift. As Bligh and his crew stop for supplies on the island of Tofua, natives kill quartermaster John Norton. Bligh and his crew agree to try to reach the Dutch East Indies. Bligh talks down a heated Purcell, even giving him his share of food and insists that they not eat each other to survive. Bligh&#x27;s triumph pays off as he and his crew successfully reach Timor.

Christian and the mutineers sail back to Tahiti. King Tynah, however, is concerned that their mutiny could incite British punishment against his people. Realizing the folly of staying, the mutineers gather supplies, and are allowed to collect their girlfriends and native friends and sail away to try to find a safe refuge. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow Mauatua to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father. Churchill, along with others, stay, while Christian tries to get beyond reach of British punishment; the search for a safe haven is long and seemingly impossible, as any pursuing Royal Navy vessels will search all known islands and coastlines to find them. Some of the &quot;Bounty&quot; crew are so frustrated that they are ready to rebel against Christian to turn the ship back towards Tahiti. After Christian forces the crew to continue on, they find Pitcairn Island, a place not marked on British maps of the region. As the crew burn the &quot;Bounty&quot; making detection and escape virtually impossible, seaman John Adams notes to Christian that they will never get off the island or see England again. The judgment of Bligh&#x27;s court-martial is read by Admiral Hood: Bligh is exonerated of all blame of the loss of the &quot;Bounty&quot;, and is commended for courage and exemplary seamanship for the open boat voyage. Bligh, moved, sheathes his sword with a slight tremor, thanks Hood and departs. A resigned Christian watches &quot;Bounty&quot; sink.

===Development ===
====David Lean====
The film was originally a longstanding project of director David Lean and his frequent collaborator, Robert Bolt. They started working on a script in Bora Bora in October 1977. Lean and Bolt planned to make two films, one named &quot;The Lawbreakers&quot; that would deal with the voyage out to Tahiti and the subsequent mutiny, and the second named &quot;The Long Arm&quot;, which would be a study of the journey and the mutineers after the mutiny, as well as the admiralty&#x27;s response in sending out the frigate .

In November 1977, producer Dino De Laurentiis announced he would finance the project and make it after his version of the &quot;Hurricane&quot;. Phil Kellogg was to produce the films. In December of that year, Paramount announced they would finance and distribute. The intention was to shoot the film in Tahiti, where De Laurentiis had built a large facility for shooting &quot;Hurricane&quot;, including a brand-new hotel.

While working on the script, Lean directed a documentary, &quot;Lost and Found: The Story of Cook&#x27;s Anchor&quot;, about discovering an anchor that belonged to a ship of Captain Cook.

In August 1978, Lean said he expected each film to cost $25 million. &quot;With the high brow critics you&#x27;re as good as dead if you spend that sort of money on a film&quot;, he said. &quot;For that kind of money, the argument runs, anyone should be able to make a good picture. Which is absolute rubbish.&quot; A replica of &quot;The Bounty&quot; was built in New Zealand. A script was finished by November 1978.

Bernard Williams became attached as producer. He says Lean and De Laurentiis assumed both films could be made for $40 million in total, but Williams budgeted &quot;The Lawbreakers&quot; alone at $40 million. De Laurentiis decided he could not afford to proceed. &quot;Dino is no longer behind the project&quot;, said Kellogg in November, adding &quot;The first script is finished and the second is underway. I expect the pictures to go in about a year by now and we&#x27;ll make them back to back.&quot;

On 12 April 1979, Bolt suffered a massive heart attack, followed by a stroke two days later, with the second script incomplete. In August 1979 Anthony Hopkins announced Lean had asked him to play Bligh.

They looked at making the project as a seven-part TV series. Paramount were interested but decided to pull out after two months feeling the project was too &quot;masculine&quot; and lacked female interest. Lean tried to interest Sam Spiegel who persuaded the director to make just the one film. Lean had a go at the script himself.

Lean was ultimately forced to abandon the project after overseeing casting and the construction of the &quot;Bounty&quot; replica which cost $4 million. In June 1981 the producer was trying to sell the replica.

&quot;It was three years&#x27; work wasted&quot;, said Lean later. &quot;And the sad part is, it was the best script I&#x27;ve ever had. It was really a cracker it would have made a marvellous film. But after all that work they pulled the rug from under me.&quot;

De Laurentiis did not want to lose the millions he had already put into the project—$2 million in development costs plus the cost of the ship—and looked for another director.

====Roger Donaldson====
Donaldson was an Australian who had forged a career as director in New Zealand with &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot; and &quot;Smash Palace&quot;. The latter was the first New Zealand film to obtain a distributor in the U.S. Donaldson said he met with de Laurentiis to discuss filming a sequel to &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Donaldson worked on a new script for that film. &quot;Some time during that period I mentioned that I thought The Bounty sounded like an interesting project&quot;, Donaldson said. &quot;Well, when I finished with the Conan script, he didn&#x27;t really like it so I figured, well, I&#x27;m finished with Dino.&quot;

The producer then offered him &quot;The Bounty&quot; despite not having seen any of the director&#x27;s films and the fact that his biggest budget to date had been $1 million. (De Laurentiis later says he gave Donaldson the job on the basis of &quot;Smash Palace&quot;.)

&quot;Making the movie was something that, initially, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to do&quot;, said Donaldson. &quot;I thought it might be perceived as some sort of a remake. But I looked at it and decided I&#x27;d do it as long as I could do something completely on my own, not a remake at all, but based much more on fact—something to set the record straight.&quot;
&quot;I saw it as an intense personal drama about two friends who have a tragic and violent falling out—a drama in which your sympathies change as events change&quot;, Donaldson said. &quot;When you leave the movie, I hope that deep down you feel that you&#x27;ve understood a relationship between two men.&quot;

===Casting===
Anthony Hopkins was one of two actors considered for the role of Captain Bligh by David Lean. The other was Oliver Reed. Hopkins was approached as early as 1978.

In April 1980, when David Lean was still attached, Christopher Reeve was the favorite to play Fletcher Christian. Lean had enjoyed &quot;Superman&quot; and Katharine Hepburn had recommended Reeve to Lean. &quot;It&#x27;s not a remake&quot;, said Reeve. &quot;The other versions were just remakes of the first movie. This is the true story based on the diaries of those actually on the Bounty and from the trial of the mutineers. It&#x27;s the best screenplay I&#x27;ve ever read and it would be an honor and a privilege to accept the part of Christian.&quot;

Reeve stayed on the project through the change in director. However he dropped out at the last minute and was replaced by Mel Gibson. Gibson was looking for a project after &quot;The Night of the Running Man&quot; at MGM was cancelled. &quot;I liked the idea they were going to show Bligh and Christian as the young men they were&quot;, said Gibson. &quot;I also liked the idea of playing a role that Errol Flynn first attempted.&quot;

The role of Peter Heywood (who inspired the character &#x27;Roger Byam&#x27; in the novel and earlier film versions) was originally intended to be played by Hugh Grant.

Tevaite Vernette was spotted at Papeete Airport and offered the female lead. She had to be persuaded and only agreed to play the lead once filming began.

==Filming==
Filming started 25 April 1983. The final script was completed only the day before filming began.

The film was shot on location over 20 weeks in Mo&#x27;orea, French Polynesia, Port of Gisborne, New Zealand and at the Old Royal Naval College and the Reform Club, Pall Mall, London. Many of the shots of the ship were filmed in Opunohu Bay, Moorea, the bay where Captain James Cook anchored during 1777. Below-the-deck scenes were shot at Lee Studios outside London.

The replica of the &quot;Bounty&quot; used in the film was built in Whangārei, New Zealand, before the script was even completed at a cost of $4 million; the entire film cost $25 million. Donaldson said the boat &quot;has got to be the most expensive movie prop ever built. It&#x27;s exact right down to the hand stitching on the sails.&quot;

The director says filming on the ship was hard. &quot;It&#x27;s only 90 feet long and its design is archaic. So it rolled all the time and people were constantly seasick. It wasn&#x27;t a pleasant experience.&quot;

However, unlike many other films filmed on water, &quot;The Bounty&quot; was finished under budget.

As well as the New Zealand-built &quot;Bounty&quot;, Lean had also looked at refitting the frigate &quot;Rose&quot; to play the role of &quot;Pandora&quot;. The latter has since gone on to become HMS &quot;Surprise&quot; in Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;Master and Commander&quot;. For the storm sequences a detailed 25-foot model of the &quot;Bounty&quot; was built.

Gibson described the making of the film as difficult because of the long production time and bad weather: &quot;I went mad. They would hold their breath at night when I went off. One night I had a fight in a bar and the next day they had to shoot only one side of my face because the other was so messed up. If you see the film, you can see the swelling in certain scenes.&quot; Anthony Hopkins, who had battled with alcoholism until becoming abstinent in 1975, was worried about Gibson&#x27;s heavy drinking, saying, &quot;Mel is a wonderful, wonderful fellow with a marvellous future. He&#x27;s already something of a superstar, but he&#x27;s in danger of blowing it unless he takes hold of himself.&quot; Gibson, who likewise self-identified as an alcoholic, agreed with this concern, and added his admiration for the Welsh actor: &quot;He was terrific. He was good to work with because he was open and he was willing to give. He&#x27;s a moral man, and you could see this. I think we had the same attitudes.&quot;

Donaldson said Hopkins &quot;became Bligh&quot; during filming. &quot;So much so that you didn&#x27;t want to sit with him at breakfast.&quot;

Donaldson admits he and Hopkins clashed during filming. &quot;I&#x27;m a bit of a hard task-master&quot;, admitted Donaldson later. &quot;I won&#x27;t give up until I really think we&#x27;ve wrung everything we can out of every scene... It was 90 degrees in Tahiti and the humidity was 100%, and Tony was wearing this wool-serge uniform, done up to the neck. That was demanding, just physically.&quot;

===Music===
The score was composed by Vangelis. The soundtrack has never been officially released, but a two-CD limited edition bootleg was released by One World Music (OWM-95034) in 1995. The score for the tracks &quot;Opening Titles&quot; and &quot;Closing Titles&quot; were remade for the compilation album &quot;Themes&quot; released in 1989 by Polydor Records.

==Release==
&quot;The Bounty&quot; was screened out of competition as the closing film at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival on 23 May. It was released in the United States by Orion Pictures on 4 May 1984 and in the United Kingdom on 5 October 1984 by Thorn EMI Screen Entertainment.
Upon theatrical release in the U.K., the film received a 15 certificate rating.

===Home media===
&quot;The Bounty&quot; was released in the U.S. in 1984 and again in 1994 on the LaserDisc format.
The film was released as a special-edition DVD in the United Kingdom in March 2002 by Sanctuary with five extra features, including separate audio commentaries, first by the director Roger Donaldson, producer Bernie Williams and production designer John Graysmark and solo commentary by maritime historian Stephen Walters, a fifty-two-minute &#x27;making of&#x27; documentary narrated by Edward Fox, The Bounty on Film discussing the various Bounty films, original theatrical trailer and booklet. In the United States Twilight Time released a limited-edition Blu-ray on 10 March 2015 with little in terms of bonus material; however, it features an isolated score track by Vangelis. A special-edition DVD and Blu-ray with the same special features as the 2002 issue was released in Australia by Via Vision Entertainment on 5 December 2018.
On 2 January 2019 a Blu-ray was issued in the U.S. and Canada by Kino Lorber Studio Classic with the commentary tracks, Original theatrical trailer and image gallery. Australian label Imprint released a 2-disc Blu-ray box set on 28 June 2023, with a new 4K scan of the negative. Some of the special features included are a new 90-minute featurette of cast and crew interviews, new interview with director Roger Donaldson, new featurette of the score by Vangelis and two archive documentaries titled &#x27;A Fated Ship&#x27; surrounding the construction of &quot;The Bounty&quot; replica and &#x27;In Bligh&#x27;s Wake&#x27; charting the voyage of the replica from New Zealand.

== Historical accuracy ==
The film is generally regarded as more revisionist as well as a more historically accurate depiction of the mutiny than earlier film versions. According to director Donaldson, &quot;The major difference between our film and the other versions is that none of the others pointed out that Bligh and Christian were friends. They&#x27;d made voyages together before they sailed on the &quot;Bounty&quot;. And while they were on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, Bligh demoted another officer and promoted Christian, who was at that stage nothing but a midshipman, and made him second in command. What interested me was to explore how their relationship deteriorated from that point to where Christian leads a mutiny against Bligh.&quot; Unlike earlier versions, the film did not portray Bligh as a villain. According to Gibson, &quot;It was a kind of fresh look at Captain Bligh, and I think of all the renditions of who Bligh was, his was probably the closest. His Bligh was stubborn and didn&#x27;t suffer fools, but he was brilliant and just had a lot of bad luck.&quot; Bligh is portrayed as a man who is hot-tempered and foul-mouthed, but only scolds when necessary and is relatively sparing in his punishments, even clearly disliking the order to have his men flogged. On the one hand, he takes his sense of discipline and command too far when scolding Christian about the ship being filthy, exceeding the limits of the ship&#x27;s company, but after the mutiny, through a return of his good character and leadership qualities, successfully guides his loyalists and their open launch to safety. &quot;The Bounty&quot; also paints a far less heroic portrait of Christian. In Gibson&#x27;s description, &quot;Fletcher was just a lad of twenty-two and he behaved like one. The first time he decided to test his horns and fight for the herd, it was a mistake. He shouldn&#x27;t have done it.&quot; Gibson later expressed the opinion that the film did not go far enough in correcting the historical record.&quot;I think the main problem with that film was that it tried to be a fresh look at the dynamic of the mutiny situation, but didn&#x27;t go far enough. In the old version, Captain Bligh was the bad guy and Fletcher Christian was the good guy. But really Fletcher Christian was a social climber and an opportunist. They should have made him the bad guy, which indeed he was. He ended up setting all these people adrift to die, without any real justification. Maybe he&#x27;d gone island crazy. They should have painted it that way. But they wanted to exonerate Captain Bligh while still having the dynamic where the guy was mutinying for the good of the crew. It didn&#x27;t quite work.&quot; The film also portrays the sailors exploiting the islanders. Unlike earlier film versions, the native women are shown (accurately) totally bare-breasted. Gibson said, &quot;It was a complete culture shock and it was unbelievable to them. It was paradise in terms of personal freedoms—freedoms that shouldn&#x27;t have been taken advantage of. They exploited the people, fooled them and didn&#x27;t tell them the whole truth&quot;. Gibson chose to suddenly erupt in violent emotion during the mutiny scene because eyewitness accounts had described Christian as &#x27;extremely agitated&#x27; and &#x27;sweating and crying&#x27;.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Bounty&quot; grossed $8.6 million in the United States and Canada. In the U.S. and Canada the film grossed $2,622,306 in its opening weekend in 986 theatres.
It earned theatrical rentals worldwide of $18.3 million, against a production budget of $20 million.

=== Critical response ===
The film was generally well received by critics, with general praise for the film&#x27;s realism and historical accuracy as well as Hopkins&#x27; performance. On the aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes it has received a 74% rating from 19 critical reviews with an average rating of 6.28/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Thanks in large part to its cast, and Anthony Hopkins in particular, &quot;The Bounty&#x27;s&quot; retelling of the mutiny on HMS Bounty is an intelligent, engaging adventure saga.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, stating, &quot;this &quot;Bounty&quot; is not only a wonderful movie, high-spirited and intelligent, but something of a production triumph as well.&quot;

However, others were disappointed with the film, especially given its distinguished cast. Many critics singled out Gibson&#x27;s performance as bland, particularly when compared to the performances given by Clark Gable and Marlon Brando in two earlier adaptations. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated, &quot;Both Bligh and Christian are unfinished characters in a screenplay that may or may not have been tampered with... The movie seems to have been planned, written, acted, shot and edited by people who were constantly being over-ruled by other people. It&#x27;s totally lifeless. The film was entered into the 1984 Cannes Film Festival.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Bounty&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;By concentrating on the deadlock of the characters and the inevitable explosion, director Roger Donaldson has left many things unexamined: the Tahitians are not allowed to be much more than stereotype happy savages, for example. But his film is a powerful vision of the hell – and the wild beauty – of the high seas.&quot;

Anthony Hopkins later said &quot;It was such a sad mess of a film, such a botched job. Yet I&#x27;d put so much time and effort into the role. So right then and there I decided: Never again. I will no longer invest so much effort in something over which I have no control. It&#x27;s too frustrating. That film was a sort of turning point for me. For years I&#x27;d been trying to cultivate a don&#x27;t-give-a-damn attitude. After watching &#x27;The Bounty&#x27; I knew I had it.&quot; He and Donaldson later worked together on &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;.

Alex von Tunzelmann of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the film a grade of C, saying: &quot;&quot;The Bounty&quot; has an incredible cast and a fabulously well-put-together production, and pays impressive attention to historical accuracy – more than any of the previous cinematic recreations. With all this going for it, it&#x27;s a pity that the drama falls flat.&quot;

<text>Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk (7 March 185014 September 1937) was a Czechoslovak statesman, progressive political activist and philosopher who served as the first president of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1935. He is regarded as the founding father of Czechoslovakia.

Born in Hodonín, Moravia (then part of the Austrian Empire), Masaryk obtained a doctorate at the University of Vienna and was a professor of philosophy at the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University. He began his political career as a deputy of the Austrian &quot;Reichsrat&quot;, serving from 1891 to 1893 and from 1907 to 1914. He was an advocate of restructuring the Austro-Hungarian Empire into a federal state, but by the outbreak of the First World War, he had become a supporter of Czech and Slovak independence. He went into exile, and travelled around Europe to organise and promote the Czechoslovak cause. He played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Czechoslovak Legion, which fought against the Central Powers during the war. In 1918, Masaryk, along with his protégés Edvard Beneš and Milan Rastislav Štefánik, travelled to the United States to obtain support from President Woodrow Wilson and Secretary of State Robert Lansing. Their negotiations resulted in the Washington Declaration, which proclaimed the independence of a Czechoslovak state.

With the fall of Austria-Hungary in late 1918, the First Czechoslovak Republic received recognition from the Allied powers and Masaryk was recognised as head of its provisional government. He was formally elected president in November, and was reelected three times subsequently. Masaryk presided over a period of stability as Czechoslovakia emerged as a strong democratic state. He resigned from office in 1935 due to old age, and was succeeded by Beneš. He retired to the village of Lány and died two years later at the age of 87.

==Early life==
Masaryk was born to a poor, working-class family in the predominantly Catholic city of Hodonín, Margraviate of Moravia, in Moravian Slovakia (in the present-day Czech Republic, then part of the Austrian Empire). The nearby Slovak village of Kopčany, the home of his father Jozef, also claims to be his birthplace. Masaryk grew up in the village of Čejkovice, in South Moravia, before moving to Brno to study.

His father, Jozef Masárik, was Slovak, born in Kopčany, Slovakia. Jozef Masárik was a carter and, later, the steward and coachman at the imperial estate in the nearby town of Hodonín. Tomáš&#x27;s mother, Teresie Masaryková (née Kropáčková), was a Moravian of Slavic origin who received a German education. A cook at the estate, she met Masárik and they married on 15 August 1849.

==Education==
After grammar school in Brno and Vienna from 1865 to 1872, Masaryk attended the University of Vienna and was a student of Franz Brentano. He received his Ph.D. from the university in 1876 and completed his habilitation thesis, &quot;Der Selbstmord als soziale Massenerscheinung der modernen Civilisation&quot; (&quot;Suicide as a Social Mass Phenomenon of Modern Civilization&quot;), there in 1879. From 1876 to 1879, Masaryk studied in Leipzig with Wilhelm Wundt and Edmund Husserl. He married Charlotte Garrigue, whom he had met while a student in Leipzig, on 15 March 1878. They lived in Vienna until 1881, when they moved to Prague.

Masaryk was appointed professor of philosophy at the Czech Charles-Ferdinand University, the Czech-language part of Charles University, in 1882. He founded &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, a magazine devoted to Czech culture and science, the following year. &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, edited by Jan Otto, was first published on 15 October 1883.

Masaryk&#x27;s students included Edward Benes and Emanuel Chalupny.

Masaryk challenged the validity of the epic poems &quot;Rukopisy královedvorský a zelenohorský&quot;, supposedly dating to the early Middle Ages and presenting a false, nationalistic Czech chauvinism to which he was strongly opposed. He also contested the Jewish blood libel during the 1899 Hilsner trial.

Masaryk was greatly influenced by the 19th-century cult of science. The 19th century was an age of tremendous scientific and technological advances, and as such scientists enjoyed immense prestige. Masaryk believed that social problems and political conflicts were the results of ignorance, and that provided that one undertook a proper &quot;scientific&quot; approach to studying the underlying causes it would be possible to devise the correct solutions. As such, Masaryk saw his role as an educator who would enlighten the public from its ignorance and apathy.

==Politician==
Masaryk served in the Reichsrat from 1891 to 1893 with the Young Czech Party and from 1907 to 1914 in the Czech Progressive Party, which he had founded in 1900. At that time, he was not yet campaigning for Czech and Slovak independence from Austria-Hungary. Masaryk helped Hinko Hinković defend the Croat-Serb Coalition during their 1909 Vienna political trial; its members were sentenced to a total of over 150 years in prison, with a number of death sentences.

When World War I broke out in 1914, Masaryk concluded that the best course was to seek independence for Czechs and Slovaks from Austria-Hungary. He went into exile in December 1914 with his daughter, Olga, staying in several places in Western Europe, the Russian Empire, the United States and Japan. Masaryk began organizing Czechs and Slovaks outside Austria-Hungary during his exile, establishing contacts which would be crucial to Czechoslovak independence. He delivered lectures and wrote several articles and memoranda supporting the Czechoslovak cause. Masaryk was pivotal in establishing the Czechoslovak Legion in Russia as an effective fighting force on the Allied side during World War I, when he held a Serbian passport. In 1915 he was one of the first staff members of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (now part of University College London), where the student society and senior common room are named after him. Masaryk became professor of Slavic Research at King&#x27;s College London, lecturing on the problem of small nations. In January 1917, supported by Norman Hapgood, T. G. Masaryk wrote the first memorandum to president Wilson, concerning the need for the creation of an independent Czechoslovak state.

During World War I and afterwards, Masaryk supported the unification of the Kingdom of Serbia with the Kingdom of Montenegro.

Masaryk championed feminist causes, being influenced by his wife Charlotte Garrigue. Masaryk&#x27;s progressive ideas strongly influenced the Washington Declaration of Czechoslovak Independence.

==Czechoslovak Legion and US visit==

On 5 August 1914, the Russian High Command authorized the formation of a battalion recruited from Czechs and Slovaks in Russia. The unit went to the front in October 1914 and was attached to the Russian Third Army.

From its start, Masaryk wanted to develop the legion from a battalion to a formidable military formation. To do so, however, he realized that he would need to recruit Czech and Slovak prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian camps. In late 1914, Russian military authorities permitted the legion to enlist Czech and Slovak POWs from the Austro-Hungarian army; the order was rescinded in a few weeks, however, because of opposition from other areas of the Russian government. Despite continuing efforts to persuade the Russian authorities to change their minds, the Czechs and Slovaks were officially barred from recruiting POWs until the summer of 1917. Under these conditions, the Czechoslovak armed unit in Russia grew slowly from 1914 to 1917. Masaryk preferred to concentrate on elites rather than public opinion. On 19 October 1915, Masaryk gave the inaugural address at the newly opened School of Slavonic Studies at King&#x27;s College London on &quot;The Problem of Small Nations in the European Crisis&quot;, arguing that on both moral and practical grounds that the United Kingdom should support the independence efforts of &quot;small&quot; nations such as the Czechs. Shortly afterwards, Masaryk crossed the English Channel to go to Paris, where he delivered a speech in French at the &quot;Institut d&#x27;études slaves&quot; of the Sorbonne on &quot;Les Slaves parmi les nations&quot; (&quot;The Slavs Among the Nations&quot;), receiving what was described as a &quot;vigorous applause&quot;.

During the war, Masaryk&#x27;s intelligence network of Czech revolutionaries provided critical intelligence to the allies. His European network worked with an American counterespionage network of nearly 80 members, headed by Emanuel Viktor Voska (including G. W. Williams). Voska and his network, who (as Habsburg subjects) were presumed to be German supporters, spied on German and Austrian diplomats. Among other achievements, the intelligence from these networks was critical in uncovering the Hindu–German Conspiracy in San Francisco. Masaryk began teaching at London University in October 1915. He published &quot;Racial Problems in Hungary&quot;, with ideas about Czechoslovak independence. In 1916, Masaryk went to France to convince the French government of the necessity of dismantling Austria-Hungary. He consulted with his friend professor Pavel Miliukov, a leading Russian historian and one of the leaders of the Kadet Party, to introduce him to various members of Russian high society.

In early 1916, the Czechs and Slovaks in Russian service were reorganized as the First Czecho-Slovak Rifle Regiment. In a rare attempt to influence public opinion, Masaryk opened up an office on Piccadilly Circus in London whose exterior was covered with pro-Czechoslovak slogans and maps with the intention of attracting the interest of those walking by. One of Masaryk&#x27;s most important British friends was the journalist Wickham Steed who wrote articles in the newspapers urging British support for Czechoslovakia. Another important British contract for Masaryk was the historian Robert Seton-Watson, who also wrote widely in the British press urging British support for the &quot;submerged&quot; nations of the Austrian empire. After the 1917 February Revolution he proceeded to Russia to help organize the Czechoslovak Legion, a group dedicated to Slavic resistance to the Austrians. Miliukov became the new Russian foreign minister in the Provisional government, and proved very sympathetic towards the idea of creating Czechoslovakia. After the Czechoslovak troops&#x27; performance in July 1917 at the Battle of Zborov (when they overran Austrian trenches), the Russian provisional government granted Masaryk and the Czechoslovak National Council permission to recruit and mobilize Czech and Slovak volunteers from the POW camps. Later that summer a fourth regiment was added to the brigade, which was renamed the First Division of the Czechoslovak Corps in Russia (Československý sbor na Rusi, also known as the Czechoslovak Legion – Československá legie). A second division of four regiments was added to the legion in October 1917, raising its strength to about 40,000 by 1918.

Masaryk formed a good connection with Russian supreme commanders, Mikhail Alekseyev, Aleksei Brusilov, Nikolay Dukhonin and Mikhail Diterikhs, in Mogilev, from May 1917.

Masaryk travelled to the United States in 1918, where he convinced President Woodrow Wilson of the righteousness of his cause. On 5 May 1918, over 150,000 Chicagoans filled the streets to welcome him; Chicago was the centre of Czechoslovak immigration to the United States, and the city&#x27;s reception echoed his earlier visits to the city and his visiting professorship at the University of Chicago in 1902 (Masaryk had lectured at the university in 1902 and 1907). He also had strong links to the United States, with his marriage to an American citizen and his friendship with Chicago industrialist Charles R. Crane, who had Masaryk invited to the University of Chicago and introduced to the highest political circles (including Wilson). Except for president Wilson and the secretary of the state Robert Lansing this was Ray Stannard Baker, W. Phillips, Polk, Long, Lane, D. F. Houston, William Wiseman, Harry Pratt Judson and the French ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand. And Bernard Baruch, Vance McCormick, Edward N. Hurley, Samuel M. Vauclain, Colonel House too. At the Chicago meeting on 8 October 1918, Chicago industrialist Samuel Insull introduced him as the president of the future Czechoslovak Republic de facto and mentioned his legions. On 18 October 1918 he submitted to president Thomas Woodrow Wilson &quot;Washington Declaration&quot; (Czechoslovak declaration of independence) created with the help of Masaryk American friends (Louis Brandeis, Ira Bennett, Gutzon Borglum, Franklin K. Lane, Edward House, Herbert Adolphus Miller, Charles W. Nichols, Robert M. Calfee, Frank E. J. Warrick, George W. Stearn and Czech Jaroslav Císař) as the basic document for the foundation of a new independent Czechoslovak state. Speaking on 26 October 1918 as head of the Mid-European Union in Philadelphia, Masaryk called for the independence of Czechoslovaks and the other oppressed peoples of central Europe.

Masaryk&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; was paradigmatic of central European thought as he identified the Western powers as the &quot;bearers of higher humanitarian principles and democracy&quot; without regard to non-European peoples enduring colonialism or segregation in the United States. Czech historian writes that &quot;he implicitly identified humanity with the peoples of European stock&quot;.

Masaryk believed that Jews controlled the press and helped the nascent state of Czechoslovakia during its struggle for independence. Czech historian Jan Láníček comments that &quot;The great philosopher and humanist Masaryk was still using the same anti-Semitic trope found at the bottom of all anti-Jewish accusations.&quot;

==Leader of Czechoslovakia==



With the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, the Allies recognized Masaryk as head of the provisional Czechoslovak government. On 14 November of that year, he was elected president of Czechoslovakia by the National Assembly in Prague while he was in New York. On 22 December, Masaryk publicly denounced the Germans in Czechoslovakia as settlers and colonists.

Masaryk was re-elected three times: in May 1920, 1927, and 1934. Normally, a president was limited to two consecutive terms by the 1920 constitution, but a one-time provision allowed the first president–Masaryk–to run for an unlimited number of terms.

On paper, Masaryk had a somewhat limited role; the framers of the constitution intended to create a parliamentary system in which the prime minister and cabinet held actual power. However, a complex system of proportional representation made it all but impossible for one party to win a majority. Usually, ten or more parties received the 2.6 per cent of votes needed for seats in the National Assembly. With so many parties represented, no party even approached the 151 seats needed for a majority; indeed, no party ever won more than 25 per cent of the vote. These factors resulted in frequent changes of government; Masaryk&#x27;s tenure saw ten cabinets headed by nine statesmen. Under the circumstances, Masaryk&#x27;s presence gave Czechoslovakia a large measure of stability. This stability, combined with his domestic and international prestige, gave Masaryk&#x27;s presidency more power and influence than the framers of the constitution intended.

He used his authority in Czechoslovakia to create the Hrad (the Castle), an extensive, informal political network. Under Masaryk&#x27;s watch, Czechoslovakia became the strongest democracy in Central Europe. Masaryk&#x27;s status as a Protestant leading a mainly Catholic nation led to criticism, as did his promotion of the 15th-century proto-Protestant Jan Hus as a symbol of Czech nationalism.

There were founded &quot;The Masaryk Academy of Labour&quot;, for the scientific study of scientific management too, with the Masaryk&#x27;s supporting in Prague in 1918 and Masaryk University in Brno.

Masaryk visited France, Belgium, England, Egypt and the Mandate for Palestine in 1923 and 1927. With Herbert Hoover, he sponsored the first Prague International Management Congress, a July 1924 gathering of 120 global labour experts (of which 60 were from the United States), organized with Masaryk Academy of Labour. After the rise of Adolf Hitler, Masaryk was one of the first political figures in Europe to voice concern. 

Masaryk resigned from office on 14 December 1935, because of old age and poor health, and was succeeded by Edvard Beneš.

==Death and legacy==
Masaryk died less than two years after leaving office, at the age of 87, in Lány on 14 September 1937. He was buried next to his wife in a plot at Lány cemetery, where later the remains of Jan Masaryk and Alice Masaryková were laid to rest.

Masaryk did not live to see the Munich Agreement or the Nazi occupation of his country, and was known as the Grand (Great) Old Man of Europe.

===Intellectual legacy===
Masaryk&#x27;s unique combination of intellectual and political authority has made him a figure of interest to sociology and philosophy, especially within Czechoslovakia, where his significance has been analysed in depth by philosophers such as Jan Patočka (1991 monograph), Milan Machovec (1968 monograph) and others.

===Commemorations===
As the founding father of Czechoslovakia, Masaryk remains revered by Czechs and Slovaks.

Masaryk University in Brno, founded in 1919 as Czechoslovakia&#x27;s second university, was named after him when it was founded; after 30 years as Univerzita Jana Evangelisty Purkyně v Brně, it was renamed for Masaryk in 1990.

Commemorations of Masaryk have been held annually in the Lány cemetery on his birthday and day of death (7 March and 14 September) since 1989.

The Czechoslovak, now Czech Order of Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, established in 1990, is an honour awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to humanity, democracy and human rights.

He is commemorated by a number of statues, busts, plaques, coins and postage stamps. Although most are in or of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Masaryk has a statue on Embassy Row in Washington, D.C., and in the Midway Plaisance park in Chicago and is memorialized in San Francisco&#x27;s Golden Gate Park rose garden. A plaque with a portrait of Masaryk is on the wall of a hotel in Rakhiv, Ukraine, where he reportedly resided from 1917 to 1918, and a bust was erected in 2002 on Zakhysnykiv Ukrainy Square (former Druzhby Narodiv Square) in Uzhhorod, Ukraine.

Avenida Presidente Masaryk (President Masaryk Avenue) is a main thoroughfare in the exclusive Polanco neighbourhood of Mexico City. In 1999 the city of Prague donated a statue of Masaryk to Mexico City, one of the two originals made when the statue for the Prague Castle was being prepared for the 150th anniversary of his birth.

The community of Masaryktown, Florida, founded by Slovaks and Czechs, is named after him.

In Israel, Masaryk is considered an important figure and a national friend. A village was named after him - Kibbutz Kfar Masaryk near Haifa, which was largely founded by Jewish immigrants from Czechoslovakia. One of the main squares in Tel Aviv is Masaryk Square (he had visited the city in 1927). In Haifa, one of the junctions in the city was named after him as well. Many cities in Israel named streets after his name, including Jerusalem, Petach Tikva, Netanya, Nahariya and others. A Masaryk forest was planted in the Western Galilee.

Streets in Zagreb, Belgrade, Dubrovnik, Daruvar, Varaždin, Novi Sad, Smederevo and Split are named Masarykova ulica, and a main thoroughfare in Ljubljana is named after Masaryk. Streets named Thomas Masaryk can be found in Geneva and Bucharest.

Asteroid 1841 Masaryk, discovered by Luboš Kohoutek, is named after him.

==Philosophy==
Masaryk&#x27;s motto was &quot;Fear not, and steal not&quot; (). A philosopher and an outspoken rationalist and humanist, he emphasised practical ethics reflecting the influence of Anglo-Saxon philosophers, French philosophy and—in particular—the work of 18th-century German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder, who is considered the founder of nationalism. Masaryk was critical of German idealism and Marxism.

==Personal life==
Masaryk married Charlotte Garrigue in 1878, and took her family name as his middle name. They met in Leipzig, Germany, and became engaged in 1877. Garrigue was born in Brooklyn to a Protestant family with French Huguenots among their ancestors. She became fluent in Czech and published articles in a Czech magazine. Hardships during the World War I took their toll, and she died in 1923. Their son, Jan, was a Czechoslovak ambassador in London, foreign minister in the Czechoslovak government-in-exile (1940–1945) and in the governments from 1945 to 1948. They had four other children: Herbert, Alice, Eleanor, and Olga.

Born and raised a Catholic, Masaryk later became a Protestant; first joining the Reformed Church in Austria and later the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren in 1918 upon Czechoslovak independence, but he was mostly non-practising and rarely attended religious services. His conversion was influenced by the 1870 declaration of papal infallibility and by his wife Charlotte, who was raised as a Unitarian.

==Family tree==


==Books==
He wrote several books in Czech, including &quot;The Czech Question&quot; (1895), &quot;The Problems of Small Nations in the European Crisis&quot; (1915), &quot;The New Europe&quot; (1917), and &quot;The World Revolution&quot; (&quot;Svĕtová revoluce&quot;; 1925) translated into English as &quot;The Making of a State&quot; (1927).

<doc id="147836" wikidata="Q235449" url="?curid=147836" title="The Singing Nun">
<text>Jeanne-Paule Marie &quot;Jeannine&quot; Deckers (17 October 1933 – 29 March 1985), better known as and often called The Singing Nun in English-speaking countries, was a Belgian Catholic singer-songwriter and former member of the Dominican Order as Sister Luc Gabriel. She acquired widespread fame in 1963 with the release of the Belgian French song &quot;Dominique&quot;, which topped the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and other charts, along with her debut album. 

Owing partially to confusion over the terms of the recording contract, she was eventually reduced to poverty and also experienced a crisis of faith, leaving the order, though still remaining a Catholic. She died by suicide in 1985 with her life partner, Annie Pécher.

== Early years ==
She was born Jeanne-Paule Marie Deckers, in Laeken, Brussels, Belgium, on 17 October 1933. The daughter of a pâtisserie owner, she was educated in a Catholic school in Brussels. Her mother thought of her as a &quot;tomboy&quot; and was pleased when she decided to join the all-girl Guides Catholiques de Belgique (GCB). When she was fifteen she had a premonition that she would become a nun. 

She became an avid Girl Guide who bought her first guitar to play at Guide evening events. While studying for three years after high school, to obtain a diploma for teaching sculpture, she considered dedicating her life to religion in a Catholic convent. From the age of 21, between 1954 and 1959, she taught sculpture to youngsters. At scout camp in the summer of 1959 she met sixteen-year-old Annie Pécher, with whom she would develop a close relationship. She became convinced, however, that her new teaching profession did not suit her and she resigned. 

In September 1959 she entered the Missionary Dominican Sisters of Our Lady of Fichermont, headquartered in the city of Waterloo, where she took the religious name Sister Luc Gabriel.

== Career ==
While in the convent, Sister Luc Gabriel wrote, sang, and casually performed her own songs, which were so well received by her fellow nuns and visitors that her religious superiors encouraged her to record an album, which visitors and retreatants at the convent would be able to purchase.

In 1962, the album was recorded in Brussels at Philips; in 1963 the single &quot;Dominique&quot; became an international hit, and her album sold nearly two million copies. Sister Luc Gabriel became an international celebrity and took the stage name of (&#x27;Sister Smile&#x27;). She gave several live concerts and appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on television on 5 January 1964. &quot;Dominique&quot; was the first song by a Belgian artist to be a number one hit single in the United States. The song&#x27;s chorus &quot;Dominique, nique, nique&quot; caused some amusement among French listeners as the verb &quot;&quot; is slang for &#x27;have sex&#x27;, with &quot;nique&quot; thus being equivalent to &#x27;fuck(s)&#x27;; Deckers was unaware of this.

Sister Luc Gabriel found it difficult, however, having to live up to her publicity as &quot;a true girl scout,&quot; always happy and in a good mood. &quot;I was never allowed to be depressed,&quot; she remembered in 1979. &quot;The mother superior used to censor my songs and take out any verses I wrote when I was feeling sad.&quot;

In 1963 the General Music Company published a book of 15 Soeur Sourire songs with English lyrics provided by Noël Regney, who later claimed that he had co-written &quot;Dominique.&quot; Later that same year she was sent by her order to take theology courses at the University of Louvain. She liked the student life, if not her courses.

=== Effects of fame and further musical career ===
Deckers did not see much money from her international fame, and her second album, &quot;Her Joys, Her Songs&quot;, received little attention and disappeared almost as soon as it was released in 1964. Most of her earnings were taken by Philips and her producer, while the rest automatically went to her religious congregation, which earned at least $100,000 in royalties.

In 1966, a biographical film loosely based on Sister Luc Gabriel was released called &quot;The Singing Nun&quot; and starring Debbie Reynolds in the central role. Sister Luc Gabriel reportedly rejected the film as &quot;fiction&quot;.

Pulled between two worlds and increasingly in disagreement with the Catholic Church, Deckers left her convent in 1966 to pursue a life as a lay Dominican instead. She later reported that her departure resulted from a personality clash with her superiors, that she had been forced out of the convent and did not leave of her own free will. Convent superiors denied the other nuns contact with her as she was described as a &quot;bad influence&quot;. After she left, however, she continued to adhere as closely as she could to the disciplines of the convent, still considering herself a nun, praying several times daily, and maintaining a simple and chaste lifestyle.

When she left the convent, her record company made her give up her professional names, &quot;Sœur Sourire&quot; and &quot;The Singing Nun&quot;. She attempted to continue her musical career under the name Luc Dominique. Angered by what she saw as the Catholic Church&#x27;s failure to implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, she released a song in 1967 in support of contraception, &quot;Glory be to God for the Golden Pill&quot;. This led to a backlash from the Catholic hierarchy which saw a succession of her planned concerts cancelled. In 1968, Deckers turned to publishing, writing a book of inspirational verse, but that, too, failed to gain an audience.

Deckers went on to release an album titled &quot;I Am Not a Star in Heaven&quot; and developed a repertoire of religious songs and songs for children. Despite her renewed emphasis on music, Deckers&#x27; career failed to prosper. She blamed the album&#x27;s failure on not being able to use the names by which she had become known, saying that &quot;nobody knew who it was.&quot; When a second single, &quot;Sister Smile Is Dead&quot;, also failed, Deckers turned to teaching disabled youngsters in Wavre, Brabant, eventually opening her own school for autistic children. She eventually suffered a nervous breakdown, which was followed by two years of psychotherapy.

== Later years ==
In 1973, Deckers became involved with the Catholic Charismatic Renewal. Cardinal Leo Suenens requested that she write songs for the movement, and this led to a brief but successful return to the stage, including a visit to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she sang before several thousand people. Under the name &quot;Sister Smile&quot;, she released another album in 1979, which she described as containing &quot;honest, religious songs&quot; commenting that the album would help listeners to &quot;know who I really am.&quot;

In the late 1970s, the Ministry of Finance of Belgium said that she owed $63,000 in back taxes. Deckers countered that the royalties from her recording were given to her convent and therefore she was not liable for payment of any personal income tax. She then called on her former convent and her former record label, Philips. The sisters gave her what they considered to be her share (which enabled her to acquire an apartment in Wavre) on condition that she stop denigrating the congregation and sign a document stating that all accounts were balanced, but Philips, which had received 95% of the revenue, did nothing. 

Deckers ran into heavy financial problems. In 1982, she tried, once again as Sœur Sourire, to score a hit with a disco synthesizer version of &quot;Dominique&quot;, but this last attempt to resume her singing career failed. In addition to the other financial worries, the autism centre for children started by Deckers and Pécher had to close its doors for financial reasons in 1982. After this, Deckers tried to make a living by giving lessons in music and religion.

== Personal life ==
Deckers reconnected with Annie Pécher, whom she had known while at the University of Louvain. They developed a strong relationship, and shared an apartment until their deaths.

Frustrated by rumours that the relationship was sexual, Deckers wrote:
People at my record company think that two women who live together must be lesbians. They assert even that nuns in convents are in love. I deny these rumors as I testify against every creepy spirit. The answer is still obvious that I am not homosexual. I am loyal and faithful to Annie, but that is a whole other love in the Lord. Anyone who cannot understand this can go to the devil!

Biographer Catherine Sauvat asserts that despite this denial, Deckers did go on subsequently to have a sexual relationship with Pécher, though only after several years of life together.

== Death ==
Deckers and Pécher died by suicide, taking overdoses of barbiturates and alcohol on 29 March 1985. In their suicide note, they referenced their financial problems. They also wrote that they had not lost their faith and wanted a joint burial, according to the rites of the Catholic Church. They were buried together on 4 April 1985 in Chérémont Cemetery in Wavre, Brabant, the town where they died. The inscription on their tombstone reads, &quot;J&#x27;ai vu voler son âme / À travers les nuages&quot; (English: &quot;I saw her soul fly through the clouds&quot;), a line taken from her 1966 song &quot;Luc Dominique&quot;.

== In popular culture ==

=== Books ===

 (&quot;Sister Smile. Love me&quot;) is a 2005 biographical novel by Luc Maddelein and , inspired by Deckers&#x27; personal diaries and correspondence. It contains excerpts from the diaries. It was translated into French as (&quot;Sister Smile. Diary of a Tragedy&quot;).

=== Theatre ===

In 1996, &quot;The Tragic and Horrible Life of the Singing Nun&quot; premiered Off-Broadway at the Grove Street Playhouse. The play, which was written and directed by Blair Fell, was loosely based on events in Deckers&#x27; life. The production featured several musical numbers and followed the life of the title character, renamed Jeanine Fou, from her entry into the convent until her death with Pécher. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review stated the play &quot;milks much of its comic mileage from the incongruous, and willfully tasteless, pairing of its holy setting and its trashy, Jacqueline Susann-style dialogue ... In dressing up despair in barbed frivolity, Mr. Fell provides his own skewed equivalent of tragic catharsis.&quot; The Catholic League spoke out publicly against the production.

In 2006, a musical version of Fell&#x27;s play was staged during the New York Musical Theatre Festival, produced by George DeMarco and David Gerard, both of whom produced the 1996 production. Laura Daniel played Jeanine and received the NYMF Award for Outstanding Individual Performance. The musical featured music and lyrics by Andy Monroe and a book by Fell (who also contributed additional lyrics); it was directed by Michael Schiralli.

=== Films ===

&quot;The Singing Nun&quot; is a 1966 American semi-biographical film, directed by Henry Koster and with a screenplay by John Furia and Sally Benson. Based loosely on Deckers&#x27; life to that point in time, it stars Debbie Reynolds in the title role and also features Greer Garson, Ricardo Montalbán, Agnes Moorehead, Katharine Ross, Chad Everett, and Ed Sullivan as himself.

In 2009, &quot;Sœur Sourire&quot;, a Franco-Belgian biopic, directed by Stijn Coninx and starring Belgian actress Cécile de France as Deckers, was released. The film won the Magritte Award for Best Costume Design.

<text>Carlos Manuel Cecilio Rodríguez Santiago, also known as &quot;Blessed Charlie&quot; (November 22, 1918 – July 13, 1963), was a Catholic catechist and liturgist who was beatified by Pope John Paul II on April 29, 2001. He is the first Puerto Rican and the first Caribbean-born layperson in history to be beatified.

==Life==

===Early years===
Rodríguez was born in 1918, in Caguas, Puerto Rico, the son of Manuel Baudelio Rodriguez Rodriguez and Herminia Santiago Esteras, both from large, Catholic families. He was baptized at the nearby Sweet Name of Jesus Church (now the cathedral of the region) on May 4, 1919. Rodríguez was the second of five brothers and sisters. Two of his sisters married, while another became a Carmelite nun. His brother, José (Pepe) Rodriguez became a Benedictine monk and the first Puerto Rican to become abbot of his monastery.

In 1925, a fire destroyed the family&#x27;s residence and business, and they were forced to live with his mother&#x27;s parents. That same year, Rodríguez was enrolled to study at the Colegio Católico Notre Dame, attached to the parish church. After graduating the Catholic elementary school, he began to attend Gautier Benítez High School. His desire to become a priest was undermined by ill health. At that point, he began to develop ulcerative colitis. After two years at the local public high school, he transferred to the Academy of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in San Juan. His medical problems, however, caused him to leave before graduation. He returned to the family home and continued his high school studies as best he could while working as a clerk, finally receiving his diploma in May 1939. 

===Pastoral life===
While Rodríguez was working as an office clerk in various towns of the region, he dedicated his resources to promote a greater knowledge of the Catholic faith by promoting a greater understanding of the Catholic liturgy. Using articles on liturgical subjects he had translated and edited, he began publishing &quot;Liturgy&quot; and &quot;Christian Culture&quot;, which he dedicated innumerable hours. Rodríguez organized discussion groups in towns across the entire island and worked with Catholic social organizations to disseminate his ideas. He also taught catechism to high school students whose study aids he supplied out of his pocket. He was a Knight of Columbus.

In 1946 Rodríguez enrolled at the University of Puerto Rico in Río Piedras, to pursue higher studies, where his brother José and sister Haydée were already UPR faculty members. As his disciples grew in number, he moved into nearby Catholic University Center and organized another Liturgy Circle (later called the &quot;Círculo de Cultura Cristiana&quot;). Despite excellent grades and his love for studies, however, illness prevented him from completing his second year. Nonetheless, he was a voracious reader and, with only a year&#x27;s study, was able to master both the piano and the church organ. In 1948, he assembled along with Father McGlone, the parroquial chorus &quot;Te Deum Laudamus&quot;.

Rodríguez zealously promoted a renewal of the Catholic liturgy among bishops, clergy, and laypeople. He professed extreme devotion to the liturgy and worked to repair the loss of liturgical customs that had been abandoned over generations. He advocated for active participation of the laity in prayer, the use of the vernacular, and – most significantly – the observance of his much loved Paschal Vigil in its proper nighttime setting, after centuries of having this service celebrated on the morning of Holy Saturday. Increasingly convinced that “the liturgy is the life of the Church,&quot; he organized a &quot;Liturgy Circle&quot; in Caguas to foment better knowledge among the people. He expressed particular concern over the Easter vigil, saying that it had lost its ancient character as the focal night of the Christian year. To his delight, the Easter vigil was restored to its proper time near midnight by Pope Pius XII in 1952. One of his favorite sayings about this feast was &quot;Vivimos para esa noche&quot; (&quot;We live for that night&quot;). This is now the motto on his tomb, which is located in the Cathedral of Caguas.

===Death===
Rodríguez was diagnosed with rectal cancer following an operation in 1963 and died on July 13, 1963, at the age of 44.

==Veneration ==

Rodríguez did not care about possessions or money. As an adult, he only owned one pair of shoes. Those shoes are kept at his sister&#x27;s house, where people leave notes in them, asking for his prayers.

=== Beatification ===

In 1991, a Catholic priest from Spain, Mauro Meza, was authorized by the local bishop to take the story to the Vatican. In Rome, Meza initiated the process of inquiry that could lead to canonization. In 1981, a 42-year-old mother was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s malignant lymphoma. She and her husband had been friends of Rodríguez during his college years and knew of his death from cancer. She prayed to Rodríguez for intercession on her behalf. After fully recovering, she publicly attributed her recovery to the miracle of intercession.

On July 7, 1997, Pope John Paul II decreed Rodríguez&#x27;s heroic sanctity and service in his life. The process took a major step on April 29, 2001, when Rodríguez was beatified by Pope John Paul. Rodríguez is the first Puerto Rican person and the first Caribbean-born layperson in history to be beatified. In the entire Western Hemisphere, Rodríguez is only the second layperson to be beatified, the first being St. Kateri Tekakwitha.

The 1983 reform of the Catholic Church&#x27;s canon law has streamlined the canonization procedure considerably compared to the process carried out previously. Pope John Paul II established the new method, in his apostolic constitution of January 25, 1983, &quot;Divinus Perfectionis Magister&quot; and by the cardinal Pietro Palazzini, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. For Rodríguez to pass from Blessed to Saint, one more miracle (confirmed by the Vatican) is necessary.

==Legacy==
The Escuela Superior Católica de Bayamón (Bayamón Catholic High School) was renamed in 2001 after him as Colegio Beato Carlos Manuel Rodríguez.

<doc id="147840" wikidata="Q220105" url="?curid=147840" title="Galeazzo Ciano">
<text>Gian Galeazzo Ciano, 2nd Count of Cortellazzo and Buccari ( , ; 18 March 1903 – 11 January 1944), was an Italian diplomat and politician who served as Foreign Minister in the government of his father-in-law, Benito Mussolini, from 1936 until 1943. During this period, he was widely seen as Mussolini&#x27;s most probable successor as head of government.

He was the son of Admiral Costanzo Ciano, a founding member of the National Fascist Party; father and son both took part in Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome in 1922. Ciano saw action in the Italo-Ethiopian War (1935–36) and was appointed Foreign Minister on his return. Following a series of Axis defeats in the Second World War, Ciano began pushing for Italy&#x27;s exit, and he was dismissed from his post as a result. He then served as ambassador to the Vatican.

In July 1943, Ciano was among the members of the Grand Council of Fascism that forced Mussolini&#x27;s ousting and subsequent arrest. Ciano proceeded to flee to Germany but was arrested and handed over to Mussolini&#x27;s new regime based in Salò, the Italian Social Republic. Mussolini ordered Ciano&#x27;s death, and in January 1944 he was executed by firing squad.

Ciano wrote and left behind a diary that has been used as a source by several historians, including William Shirer in his &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich&quot; (1960) and in the four-hour HBO documentary-drama &quot;Mussolini and I&quot; (1985).

==Early life==
Gian Galeazzo Ciano was born in Livorno, Italy, in 1903. He was the son of Costanzo Ciano and his wife Carolina Pini; his father was an Admiral and World War I hero in the Royal Italian Navy (for which service he was given the aristocratic title of Count by Victor Emmanuel III). The elder Ciano, nicknamed &quot;Ganascia&quot; (&quot;The Jaw&quot;), was a founding member of the National Fascist Party and re-organizer of the Italian merchant navy in the 1920s. Costanzo Ciano was not above extracting private profit from his public office. He would use his influence to depress the stock of a company, after which he would buy a controlling interest, then increase his wealth after its value rebounded. Among other holdings, Costanzo Ciano owned a newspaper, farmland in Tuscany and other properties worth huge sums of money. As a result, his son Galeazzo was accustomed to living a high-profile and glamorous lifestyle, which he maintained almost until the end of his life. Father and son both took part in Mussolini&#x27;s 1922 March on Rome.

After studying Philosophy of Law at the University of Rome, Galeazzo Ciano worked briefly as a journalist before choosing a diplomatic career; soon, he served as an attaché in Rio de Janeiro. According Mrs. Milton E. Miles, in the 1920s in Beijing Ciano met Wallis Simpson, later the Duchess of Windsor, had an affair with her, and left her pregnant, leading to a botched abortion that left her infertile. The rumor was later widespread but never substantiated and Ciano&#x27;s wife, Edda Mussolini, denied it.

On 24 April 1930, when he was 27 years old, Ciano married Benito Mussolini&#x27;s daughter Edda Mussolini, and they had three children (Fabrizio, Raimonda and Marzio), though he was known to have had several affairs while married. Soon after their marriage, Ciano left for Shanghai to serve as Italian consul, where his wife had an affair with the Chinese warlord Zhang Xueliang.

==Political career==
===Minister of press and propaganda===
On his return to Italy in 1935, Ciano became the minister of press and propaganda in the government of his father-in-law. He volunteered for action in the Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935–36) as a bomber squadron commander. He received two silver medals of valor and reached the rank of captain. His future opponent Alessandro Pavolini served in the same squadron as a lieutenant.

===Foreign minister===

Upon his highly trumpeted return from the war as a &quot;hero&quot; in 1936, he was appointed by Mussolini as replacement Foreign Minister. Ciano began to keep a diary a short time after his appointment and kept it active up to his 1943 dismissal as foreign minister. In 1937, he was allegedly involved in planning the murder of the brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli, two exiled anti-fascist activists killed in the French spa town of Bagnoles-de-l&#x27;Orne on 9 June. Also in 1937, prior to the Italian annexation in 1939, Gian Galeazzo Ciano was named an Honorary Citizen of Tirana, Albania.

Before World War II, Mussolini may have been preparing Ciano to succeed him as &quot;Duce&quot;. At the start of the war in 1939, Ciano did not agree with Mussolini&#x27;s plans and knew that Italy&#x27;s armed forces were ill-prepared for a major war. When Mussolini formally declared war on France in 1940, he wrote in his diary, &quot;I am sad, very sad. The adventure begins. May God help Italy!&quot; Ciano became increasingly disenchanted with Nazi Germany and the course of World War II, although when the Italian regime embarked on an ill-advised &quot;parallel war&quot; alongside Germany, he went along, despite the terribly-executed Italian invasion of Greece and its subsequent setbacks. Prior to the German campaign in France in 1940, Ciano leaked a warning of imminent invasion to neutral Belgium.

Throughout 1941 and thereafter, Ciano made derogatory and sarcastic comments about Mussolini behind his back and was surprised that these comments were reported to the Duce, who did not take them lightly; for his part, Ciano ignored well-meaning friends who advised moderation. On top of that, friends and acquaintances sought his protection and aid on various matters not having to do with his official position, which in turn resulted in further caustic remarks. In addition, two relatively minor incidents wounded his overblown self-importance and vanity. One was his being excluded from a projected meeting between Mussolini and Franco. The other involved him being reprimanded for a rowdy celebration of an aviator in Bari; he wrote a letter to Mussolini stating that the Duce had &quot;opened a wound in him which can never be closed.&quot; His own self-worth seemed to cloud his judgement, forgetting that he had acquired his position by marrying Mussolini&#x27;s daughter.

In late 1942 and early 1943, following the Axis defeat in North Africa, other major setbacks on the Eastern Front, and with an Anglo-American assault on Sicily looming, Ciano turned against the doomed war and actively pushed for Italy&#x27;s exit from the conflict. He was silenced by being removed from his post as foreign minister. The rest of the cabinet was removed as well on 5 February 1943.

===Ambassador to the Holy See===
Ciano was offered the post of ambassador to the Holy See, and presented his credentials to Pope Pius XII on 1 March. In this role he remained in Rome, watched closely by Mussolini. The regime&#x27;s position had become even more unstable by the coming summer, however, and court circles were already probing the Allied commands for some sort of agreement.

On the afternoon of 24 July 1943, Mussolini summoned the Fascist Grand Council to its first meeting since 1939, prompted by the Allied invasion of Sicily. At that meeting, Mussolini announced that the Germans were thinking of evacuating the south. This led Dino Grandi to launch a blistering attack on his longtime comrade. Grandi put on the table a resolution asking King Victor Emmanuel III to resume his full constitutional powers – in effect, a vote leading to Mussolini&#x27;s ousting from leadership. The motion won by an unexpectedly large margin, 19–8, with Ciano voting in favor. Mussolini&#x27;s replacement was Pietro Badoglio, an Italian general in both World Wars. Mussolini did not expect the vote to have substantive effect, and showed up for work the next morning as usual. That afternoon, the king summoned him to Villa Savoia and dismissed him from office. Upon leaving the villa, Mussolini was arrested.

==Exile, trial and death==

Ciano was dismissed from his post by the new government of Italy put in place after his father-in-law was overthrown. Ciano, Edda and their three children fled to Germany on 28 August 1943 in fear of being arrested by the new Italian government. The Germans turned him over to Mussolini&#x27;s new government, the Italian Social Republic. He was then formally arrested on charges of treason. Under German and Fascist pressure, Mussolini had Ciano imprisoned before he was tried and found guilty. After the Verona trial and sentence, on 11 January 1944, Ciano was executed by a firing squad along with four others (Emilio De Bono, Luciano Gottardi, Giovanni Marinelli and Carlo Pareschi) who had voted for Mussolini&#x27;s ousting. As a further humiliation, the condemned men were tied to chairs and shot in the back, though Ciano managed to twist his chair around at the last minute to face the firing squad before uttering his final words, &quot;Long live Italy!&quot;

Ciano is remembered for his &quot;Diaries 1937–1943&quot;, a revealing daily record of his meetings with Mussolini, Hitler, Ribbentrop, foreign ambassadors and other political figures. Edda tried to barter his papers to the Germans in return for his life; Gestapo agents helped her confidant Emilio Pucci rescue some of them from Rome. Pucci was then a lieutenant in the Italian Air Force, but would find fame after the war as a fashion designer. When Hitler vetoed the plan, she hid the bulk of the papers at a clinic in Ramiola, near Medesano and on 9 January 1944, Pucci helped Edda escape to Switzerland with five diaries covering the war years which were then buried beneath a rose garden. The diary was first published in English in London in 1946, edited by Malcolm Muggeridge, covering 1939 to 1943. The complete English version was published in 2002.

==Children==
Gian Galeazzo and Edda Ciano had three children:

* Raimonda Ciano (Rome, 12 December 1933 – Rome, 24 May 1998), married to &quot;Nobile&quot; Alessandro Giunta (born 1929), son of &quot;Nobile&quot; Francesco Giunta (Piero, 1887–1971) and wife (m. Rome, 1924) Zenaida del Gallo Marchesa di Roccagiovine (Rome, 1902 – São Paulo, Brazil, 1988)
* Marzio Ciano, (Rome, 18 December 1937 – 11 April 1974), married Gloria Lucchesi

==In popular culture==

* A number of films have depicted Ciano&#x27;s life, including &quot;The Verona Trial&quot; (1962) by Carlo Lizzani, where he is played by Frank Wolff and &quot;Mussolini and I&quot; (1985) in which he was played by Anthony Hopkins.
* In Serbia there is a proverb: &quot;Living like Count Ciano&quot; – describing a flamboyant and luxurious life (Živi k&#x27;o grof Ćano/Живи к&#x27;о гроф Ћано).

<doc id="147842" wikidata="Q824202" url="?curid=147842" title="Tridentine Mass">
<text>The Tridentine Mass, also known as the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite or &quot;usus antiquior&quot; (), or the Traditional Latin Mass or the Traditional Rite is the liturgy in the Roman Missal of the Catholic Church codified in 1570 and published thereafter with amendments up to 1962. Celebrated almost exclusively in Ecclesiastical Latin, it was the most widely used Eucharistic liturgy in the world from its issuance in 1570 until its replacement by the Mass of Paul VI promulgated in 1969 (with the revised Roman Missal appearing in 1970.)

&quot;Tridentine&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;Tridentinus&quot;, &quot;related to the city of Tridentum&quot; (modern-day Trent, Italy), where the Council of Trent was held at the height of the Counter-Reformation. In response to a decision of that council, Pope Pius V promulgated the 1570 Roman Missal, making it mandatory throughout the Latin Church, except in places and religious orders with rites or uses from before 1370. 

Permissions for celebrating the Tridentine Mass have been adjusted by each modern pope, and most recently restricted by Pope Francis&#x27; &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Traditionis Custodes&quot; in 2021. This has been controversial among so-called Traditionalist Catholics: some material on the subject may be to some extent partisan. 

==Terminology==

The term &quot;Tridentine Mass&quot; applies to celebrations in accordance with the successive editions of the Roman Missal whose title attribute them to the Council of Trent (&quot;Missale Romanum ex decreto Sacrosancti Concilii Tridentini restitutum&quot;) and to the pope or popes who made the revision represented in the edition in question. The first of these editions is that of 1570, in which the mention of the Council of Trent is followed by a reference to Pope Pius V (&quot;Pii V Pont. Max. iussu editum&quot;). The last, that of 1962, mentions the popes only generically (&quot;Missale Romanum ex decreto SS. Concilii Tridentini restitutum Summorum Pontificum cura recognitum&quot;). Editions later than that of 1962 mention the Second Vatican Council instead of the Council of Trent, as in the 2002 edition: &quot;Missale Romanum ex decreto Sacrosancti Oecumenici Concilii Vaticani II instauratum auctoritati Pauli Pp. VI promulgatum Ioannis Pauli Pp. II cura recognitum&quot;.

Sometimes the term &quot;Tridentine Mass&quot; is applied restrictively to Masses in which the final 1962 edition of the Tridentine Roman Missal is used, the only edition still authorized, under certain conditions, as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass.

Some speak of this form of Mass as &quot;the Latin Mass&quot;. This too is a restrictive use of a term whose proper sense is much wider. The Second Vatican Council Mass also has its normative text, from which vernacular translations are made, in Latin, and, except at Masses scheduled by the ecclesiastical authorities to take place in the language of the people, it can everywhere be celebrated in Latin.

A few speak of the Tridentine Mass in general or of its 1962 form as the &quot;Gregorian Rite&quot;. The term &quot;Tridentine Rite&quot; is also sometimes met with, but Pope Benedict XVI declared it inappropriate to speak of the 1962 version and that published by later Popes as if they were two &quot;rites&quot;. Rather, he said, it is a matter of a twofold &quot;use&quot; of one and the same Roman &quot;rite&quot;. Hugh Somerville-Knapman, O.S.B., says that they should be separate rites, as the Mass promulgated at the Council of Trent was already the pre-existing liturgy of the Diocese of Rome and has direct continuity with the Mass practiced by the apostles, whereas the changes made in implementing the Mass of Paul VI are so great that it no longer resembles any Catholic liturgy practiced prior to the 20th century.

Other names for the edition promulgated by Pope John XXIII in 1962 (the last to bear the indication &quot;ex decreto Sacrosancti Concilii Tridentini restitutum&quot;) are the &quot;Extraordinary Form&quot;, or the &quot;usus antiquior&quot; (&quot;more ancient usage&quot; in Latin ).

Traditionalist Catholics, whose best-known characteristic is an attachment to the Tridentine Mass, frequently refer to it as the &quot;Traditional Mass&quot; or the &quot;Traditional Latin Mass&quot;. They describe as a &quot;codifying&quot; of the form of the Mass the preparation of Pius V&#x27;s edition of the Roman Missal, of which he said that the experts to whom he had entrusted the work collated the existing text with ancient manuscripts and writings, restored it to &quot;the original form and rite of the holy Fathers&quot; and further emended it. To distinguish this form of Mass from the Vatican II Mass, traditionalist Catholics sometimes call it the &quot;Mass of the Ages&quot;, and say that it comes down to us &quot;from the Church of the Apostles, and ultimately, indeed, from Him Who is its principal Priest and its spotless Victim&quot;.

==Language==
In most countries, the language used for celebrating the Tridentine Mass was and is Latin, which became the language of the Roman liturgy in the late 4th century. However, there have been numerous exceptions, primarily in missionary areas or for ancient churches with an established sacred-language tradition: 

* In Dalmatia and parts of Istria in Croatia, the liturgy was celebrated in Old Church Slavonic from the time of Cyril and Methodius, and authorization for use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.

* In the late 1500s, permission was granted for missionaries working in India to use Syriac for the mass.

* On June 27, 1615, Pope Paul V granted permission for Mass and the Divine Office to be celebrated, and the sacraments administered, in the Chinese language according to the Roman Rite, and Lodovico Buglio, S.J., carried out the translation of the Missal, the Ritual, and a large part of the Breviary into Chinese. This faculty was never used.

* Similarly, on April 17, 1624, permission was granted for the Discalced Carmelites to use Arabic at the mission in Persia, and on April 30, 1631, the Theatines were granted permission to use Georgian or Armenian at their mission in Georgia. 

* Permission to use Arabic was also extended to the Franciscans in the Holy Land in the nineteenth century. 

* Missionaries in Canada were authorized to use Mohawk and Algonquin translations of the ordinary and the proper of the Tridentine Mass at least through the middle 1800s. 
* In 1958, permission was given for Hindi to be used at masses in India.

After the publication of the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal, the 1964 Instruction on implementing the Constitution on Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council laid down that &quot;normally the epistle and gospel from the Mass of the day shall be read in the vernacular&quot;. Episcopal conferences were to decide, with the consent of the Holy See, what other parts, if any, of the Mass were to be celebrated in the vernacular.

Outside the Roman Catholic Church:

* The vernacular language was introduced into the celebration of the Tridentine Mass by some European Old Catholics (most Old Catholics use the Tridentine Mass, either in the vernacular or in Latin) and by Anglican Anglo-Catholics with the introduction of the English Missal. )

* Some Western Rite Orthodox Christians, particularly in the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America&#x27;s Western Rite Vicariate, use the Tridentine Mass in the vernacular with minor alterations under the title of the &quot;Divine Liturgy of St. Gregory&quot;. Latin Masses on days of the week other than Sunday are becoming common.

== Pope Pius V&#x27;s revision of the liturgy ==
At the time of the Council of Trent, the traditions preserved in printed and manuscript missals varied considerably, and standardization was sought both within individual dioceses and throughout the Latin West. Standardization was required also in order to prevent the introduction into the liturgy of Protestant ideas in the wake of the Protestant Reformation.

Pope Pius V accordingly imposed uniformity by law in 1570 with the papal bull &quot;Quo primum&quot;, ordering use of the Roman Missal as revised by him. He allowed only those rites that were at least 200 years old to survive the promulgation of his 1570 Missal. Several of the rites that remained in existence were progressively abandoned, though the Ambrosian rite survives in Milan, Italy and neighbouring areas, stretching even into Switzerland, and the Mozarabic rite remains in use to a limited extent in Toledo and Madrid, Spain. The Carmelite, Carthusian and Dominican religious orders kept their rites, but in the second half of the 20th century two of these three chose to adopt the Roman Rite. The rite of Braga, in northern Portugal, seems to have been practically abandoned: since 18 November 1971 that archdiocese authorizes its use only on an optional basis.

Beginning in the late 17th century, France and neighbouring areas, such as Münster, Cologne and Trier in Germany, saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops influenced by Jansenism and Gallicanism. This ended when Abbot Guéranger and others initiated in the 19th century a campaign to return to the Roman Missal.

Pius V&#x27;s revision of the liturgy had as one of its declared aims the restoration of the Roman Missal &quot;to the original form and rite of the holy Fathers&quot;. Due to the relatively limited resources available to his scholars, this aim was in fact not realised.

Three different printings of Pius V&#x27;s Roman Missal, with minor variations, appeared in 1570, a folio and a quarto edition in Rome and a folio edition in Venice. A reproduction of what is considered to be the earliest, referred to therefore as the &quot;editio princeps&quot;, was produced in 1998. In the course of the printing of the &quot;editio princeps&quot;, some corrections were made by pasting revised texts over parts of the already printed pages. There were several printings again in the following year 1571, with various corrections of the text.

==Historical variations==

In the Apostolic Constitution (papal bull) &quot;Quo primum&quot;, with which he prescribed use of his 1570 edition of the Roman Missal, Pius V decreed: &quot;We order and enjoin that nothing must be added to Our recently published Missal, nothing omitted from it, nor anything whatsoever be changed within it.&quot; This of course did not exclude changes by a Pope, and Pope Pius V himself added to the Missal the feast of Our Lady of Victory, to celebrate the victory of Lepanto of 7 October 1571. His immediate successor, Pope Gregory XIII, changed the name of this feast to &quot;The Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary&quot; and Pope John XXIII changed it to &quot;Our Lady of the Rosary&quot;.

Pius V&#x27;s work in severely reducing the number of feasts in the Roman calendar (see this comparison) was very soon further undone by his successors. Feasts that he had abolished, such as those of the Presentation of Mary, Saint Anne and Saint Anthony of Padua, were restored even before Clement VIII&#x27;s 1604 typical edition of the Missal was issued.

In the course of the following centuries new feasts were repeatedly added and the ranks of certain feasts were raised or lowered. A comparison between Pope Pius V&#x27;s Tridentine calendar and the General Roman Calendar of 1954 shows the changes made from 1570 to 1954. Pope Pius XII made a general revision in 1955, and Pope John XXIII made further general revisions in 1960 simplifying the terminology concerning the ranking of liturgical celebrations.

While keeping on 8 December what he called the feast of &quot;the Conception of Blessed Mary&quot; (omitting the word &quot;Immaculate&quot;), Pius V suppressed the existing special Mass for the feast, directing that the Mass for the Nativity of Mary (with the word &quot;Nativity&quot; replaced by &quot;Conception&quot;) be used instead. Part of that earlier Mass was revived in the Mass that Pope Pius IX ordered to be used on the feast.

===Typical editions of the Roman Missal===
In addition to such occasional changes, the Roman Missal was subjected to general revisions whenever a new &quot;typical edition&quot; (an official edition whose text was to be reproduced in printings by all publishers) was issued.

After Pius V&#x27;s original Tridentine Roman Missal, the first new typical edition was promulgated in 1604 by Pope Clement VIII, who in 1592 had issued a revised edition of the Vulgate. The Bible texts in the Missal of Pope Pius V did not correspond exactly to the new Vulgate, and so Clement edited and revised Pope Pius V&#x27;s Missal, making alterations both in the scriptural texts and in other matters. He abolished some prayers that the 1570 Missal obliged the priest to say on entering the church; shortened the two prayers to be said after the Confiteor; directed that the words &quot;&quot; (&quot;Do this in memory of me&quot;) should not be said while displaying the chalice to the people after the consecration, but before doing so; inserted directions at several points of the Canon that the priest was to pronounce the words inaudibly; suppressed the rule that, at High Mass, the priest, even if not a bishop, was to give the final blessing with three signs of the cross; and rewrote the rubrics, introducing, for instance, the ringing of a small bell.

The next typical edition was issued in 1634, when Pope Urban VIII made another general revision of the Roman Missal.

There was no further typical edition until that of Pope Leo XIII in 1884. It introduced only minor changes, not profound enough to merit having the papal bull of its promulgation included in the Missal, as the bulls of 1604 and 1634 were.

In 1911, with the bull &quot;Divino Afflatu&quot;, Pope Pius X made significant changes in the rubrics.

Pope Pius XII radically revised the Palm Sunday and Easter Triduum liturgy, suppressed many vigils and octaves and made other alterations in the calendar (see General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII). John XXIII&#x27;s 1960 Code of Rubrics were incorporated in the final 1962 typical edition of the Tridentine Missal, replacing both Pius X&#x27;s &quot;Additions and Changes in the Rubrics of the Missal&quot; and the earlier &quot;General Rubrics of the Missal&quot;.

The General Roman Calendar was revised partially in 1955 and 1960 and completely in 1969 in Pope Paul VI&#x27;s &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Mysterii Paschalis&quot;, again reducing the number of feasts.

===1962 Missal===

The Roman Missal issued by Pope John XXIII in 1962 differed from earlier editions in a number of ways.
* It incorporated the change made by John XXIII in 1962, when he inserted into the canon of the Mass the name of Saint Joseph, the first change for centuries in the canon of the Mass.
*In addition, the 1962 Missal removed the adjective &quot;perfidis&quot; from the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews.

In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI authorized, under certain conditions, continued use of this 1962 edition of the Roman Missal as an &quot;extraordinary form&quot;, alongside the later form, introduced in 1970, which he called the normal or ordinary form.

* This included a new replacement Good Friday Prayer for the Jews for the 1962 liturgy.

Pre-1962 forms of the Roman Rite, which some individuals and groups employ, are generally not authorized for liturgical use, but in early 2018 the Ecclesia Dei Commission granted communities served by the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter an indult to use, at the discretion of the Fraternity&#x27;s superior, the pre-1955 Holy Week liturgy for three years (2018, 2019, 2020).

== Liturgical structure ==
The Mass is divided into two parts, the Mass of the Catechumens and the Mass of the Faithful. Catechumens, those being instructed in the faith, were once dismissed after the first half, not having yet professed the faith. Profession of faith was considered essential for participation in the Eucharistic sacrifice.

This rule of the &quot;Didache&quot; is still in effect. It is only one of the three conditions (baptism, right faith and right living) for admission to receiving Holy Communion that the Catholic Church has always applied and that were already mentioned in the early 2nd century by Saint Justin Martyr: &quot;And this food is called among us the Eucharist, of which no one is allowed to partake but the man who believes that the things which we teach are true, and who has been washed with the washing that is for the remission of sins, and unto regeneration, and who is so living as Christ has enjoined&quot; (&quot;First Apology&quot;, Chapter LXVI).

===Before Mass===
Asperges (Sprinkling with holy water, Psalm 51:9, 3) is an optional penitential rite that ordinarily precedes only the principal Mass on Sunday. In the sacristy, a priest wearing an alb, if he is to celebrate the Mass, or surplice, if he is not the celebrant of the Mass, and vested with a stole, which is the color of the day if the priest is the celebrant of the Mass or purple if he is not the celebrant of the Mass, exorcises and blesses salt and water, then puts the blessed salt into the water by thrice sprinkling it in the form of a cross while saying once, &quot;Commixtio salis et aquæ pariter fiat in nomine Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti&quot; (May a mixture of salt and water now be made in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit). After that, the priest, vested in a cope of the color of the day, while the choir sings an antiphon and a verse of Psalm 50/51 or 117/118, sprinkles with the holy water the altar three times, and then the clergy and the congregation. This rite, if used, precedes the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. During the Easter season, the &quot;Asperges me...&quot; verse is replaced by the &quot;Vidi aquam...&quot; verse, and &quot;Alleluia&quot; is added to the &quot;Ostende nobis...&quot; verse and to its response.

Following the Asperges, Mass begins.

===Mass of the Catechumens===
The first part is the Mass of the Catechumens.

====Prayers at the foot of the altar====

The sequence of Prayers at the foot of the altar is:
* Sign of the cross
:The priest, after processing in—at solemn Mass with deacon, and subdeacon, master of ceremonies and servers, and at other Masses with one or more servers—and at Low Mass placing the veiled chalice on the centre of the altar, makes the sign of the cross at the foot of the altar. At Solemn Mass, the chalice is placed beforehand on the credence table.
* Psalm 42 ( MT, i.e. Masoretic numbering), known by its incipit &#x27;, is recited, except in Masses of the season during Passiontide and in Requiem Masses. It is preceded and followed by an antiphon of the same psalm: &quot;&#x27;&quot; (Translation: &quot;I shall go in to the altar of God: to God who giveth joy to my youth&quot;), is recited by the priest, alternating with the deacon and subdeacon (if present) or servers. 
* is recited:
*The double form of a prayer of general confession of sins, known by its incipit &quot;Confiteor&quot; (I confess), is recited:
::(Translation: I confess to almighty God, to blessed Mary ever Virgin, to blessed Michael the archangel, to blessed John the Baptist, to the holy apostles Peter and Paul, to all the saints, and to you, brethren, that I have sinned exceedingly in thought, word, and deed through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault. Therefore, I beseech blessed Mary ever Virgin, blessed Michael the archangel, blessed John the Baptist, the holy apostles Peter and Paul, all the saints and you, brethren, to pray for me to the Lord our God.) 
:The servers pray for the priest: &quot;May Almighty God have mercy on thee, forgive thee thy sins, and bring thee to life everlasting.&quot; Then it is the ministers&#x27; or servers&#x27; turn to confess sinfulness and to ask for prayers. They use the same words as those used by the priest, except that they say &quot;you, Father&quot;, in place of &quot;you, brethren&quot;, and the priest responds with the same prayer that the servers have used for him (but using the plural number) plus an extra prayer.
* The following verses are then said by priest and ministers (or servers):

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;::℣. Deus, tu conversus vivificábis nos.
::℟. Et plebs tua lætábitur in te.
::℣. Óstende nobis, Dómine, misericórdiam tuam.
::℟. Et salutáre tuum da nobis.
::℣. Dómine, exáudi orátionem meam.
::℟. Et clamor meus ad te véniat.
::℣. Dóminus vobíscum.
::℟. Et cum spíritu tuo.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;Thou wilt turn, O God, and bring us to life: (Ps. 84:7–8)
And thy people shall rejoice in thee.
Shew us, O Lord, thy mercy.
And grant us thy salvation.
O Lord, hear my prayer.
And let my cry come unto thee.
The Lord be with you.
And with thy spirit.&lt;/poem&gt;

The priest then says, &quot;&quot; (Let us pray). After this he ascends to the altar, praying silently &quot;Aufer a nobis, quæsumus, Dómine,
iniquitates nostras: ut ad Sancta sanctorum puris mereámur méntibus introíre. Per Christum Dóminum nostrum. Amen.&quot; (Translation: Take away from us our iniquities, we beseech thee O Lord, that with pure minds we may worthily enter into the holy of holies&quot;), a reference to Exodus 26:33–34, 1 Kings 6:16, 1 Kings 8:6, 2 Chronicles 3:8, Ezekiel 41:4, and others. He places his joined hands on the edge of the altar, so that only the tips of the small fingers touch the front of it, and silently prays that, by the merits of the Saints whose relics are in the altar, and of all the Saints, God may pardon all his sins. At the words &quot;&quot; (whose relics are here), he spreads his hands and kisses the altar.

====Priest at the altar====

* Introit
** The priest again makes the sign of the Cross while he begins to read the Introit, which is usually taken from a Psalm. Exceptions occur: e.g. the Introit for Easter Sunday is adapted from Wis 10:20–21, and the antiphon in Masses of the Blessed Virgin Mary was from the poet Sedulius. This evolved from the practice of singing a full Psalm, interspersed with the antiphon, during the entrance of the clergy, before the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar were added to the Mass in medieval times. This is indicated by the very name of &quot;Introit&quot;.
* Kyrie
** This part of Mass is a linguistic marker of the origins of the Roman liturgy in Greek. &quot;Kyrie, eleison; Christe, eleison; Kyrie, eleison.&quot; means &quot;Lord, have mercy; Christ have mercy;...&quot; Each phrase is said (or sung) three times.
* Gloria in excelsis Deo
** The first line of the &quot;Gloria&quot; is taken from Lk . The &quot;Gloria&quot; is omitted during the penitential liturgical seasons of Advent, Septuagesima, Lent, and Passiontide, in which violet vestments are worn, but is used on feasts falling during such seasons, as well as on Holy (Maundy) Thursday. It is always omitted for a Requiem Mass.
* The Collect
** The priest turns toward the people and says, &quot;Dominus vobiscum.&quot; The servers respond: &quot;Et cum spiritu tuo.&quot; (&quot;The Lord be with you.&quot; &quot;And with thy spirit&quot;). The Collect follows, a prayer not drawn directly from Scripture. It tends to reflect the season.

====Instruction====
* The priest reads the Epistle, primarily an extract from the letters of St. Paul to various churches. In his &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, Pope Benedict XVI has permitted this to be read in the vernacular language when Mass is celebrated with the people.
* Between the Epistle and the Gospel two (rarely three) choir responses are sung or said. Usually these are a Gradual followed by an Alleluia; but between Septuagesima Sunday and Holy Saturday, or in a Requiem Mass or other penitential Mass the Alleluia is replaced by a Tract, and between Easter Sunday and Pentecost the Gradual is replaced by a second Alleluia. On a few exceptional occasions (most notably Easter, Pentecost, Corpus Christi, and in a Requiem Mass), a Sequence follows the Alleluia or Tract.
** The Gradual is partly composed of a portion of a Psalm.
* The Gospel reading, an extract from one of the four Gospels
** Before the reading or chanting of the Gospel, the priest prays: &quot;Cleanse my heart and my lips, O almighty God, who didst cleanse the lips of the prophet Isaias...&quot;, a reference to Isaiah 6:6. In this passage, after being cleansed by the angel, Isaiah was instructed to prophesy.
* The Homily
** The rite of Mass as revised by Pope Pius V (the Tridentine Mass) does not consider a sermon obligatory and speaks of it instead as merely optional: it presumes that the Creed, if it is to be said, will follow the Gospel immediately, but adds: &quot;If, however, someone is to preach, the Homilist, after the Gospel has been finished, preaches, and when the sermon or moral address has been completed, the Credo is said, or if it is not to be said, the Offertory is sung.&quot; By contrast the Roman Missal as revised by Pope Paul VI declares that the homily may not be omitted without a grave reason from Mass celebrated with the people attending on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation and that it is recommended on other days.
* The Creed
** The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed, professing faith in God the Father, in God the Son, in God the Holy Spirit, and in the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. At the mention of the Incarnation, the celebrant and the congregation genuflect.

===Mass of the Faithful===
The second part is the Mass of the Faithful.

====Offertory====

* Offertory Verse
** After greeting the people once more (&quot;Dominus vobiscum/Et cum spiritu tuo&quot;) and giving the invitation to pray (&quot;Oremus&quot;), the priest enters upon the Mass of the Faithful, from which the non-baptized were once excluded. He reads the Offertory Verse, a short quotation from Holy Scripture which varies with the Mass of each day, with hands joined.
* Prayer of Humble Access
** The priest offers the host, holding it on the paten at breast level and praying that, although he is unworthy, God may accept &quot;this spotless host (or victim, the basic meaning of &quot;hostia&quot; in Latin) for his own innumerable sins, offences and neglects, for all those present, and for all faithful Christians living and dead, that it may avail unto salvation of himself and those mentioned. He then mixes a few drops of water with the wine, which will later become the Blood of Jesus, and holding the chalice so that the lip of the chalice is about the height of his lips, offers &quot;the chalice of salvation&quot;, asking that it may &quot;ascend with a sweet fragrance.&quot; He then prays a prayer of contrition adapted from Dan 3:39–40.
* Incensing of the offerings and of the faithful
** At a High Mass, the priest blesses the incense, then incenses the bread and wine. Among the prayers the priest says is Psalm 141:2–4: &quot;Let my prayer, O Lord, be directed as incense in Thy sight;...&quot;, which is prayed as he incenses the altar. The priest then gives the thurible to the deacon, who incenses the priest, then the other ministers and the congregation.
* Washing the hands
** The priest prays Psalm 26:6–12: &quot;I will wash my hands among the innocent...&quot;
* Prayer to the Most Holy Trinity
** This prayer asks that the Divine Trinity may receive the oblation being made in remembrance of the passion, resurrection and ascension of Jesus and in honour of blessed Mary ever Virgin and the other saints, &quot;that it may avail to their honour and our salvation: and that they may vouchsafe to intercede for us in heaven...&quot;
* Orate fratres, Suscipiat and Secret; Amen concludes Offertory
** Here the priest turns to the congregation and says the first two words, &quot;Orate, fratres&quot;, in an elevated tone and then turns around while finishing the exhortation in the secret tone. &quot;Pray, Brethren, that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father almighty.&quot;
** The altar servers respond with the Suscipiat to which the priest secretly responds, &quot;Amen.&quot;: &quot;Suscipiat Dominus sacrificium de manibus tuis, ad laudem et gloriam nominis sui, ad utilitatem quoque nostram, totiusque ecclesiæ suae sanctæ.&quot; A translation in the English is: &quot;May the Lord accept this sacrifice at your hands, to the praise and glory of His name, for our good and the good of all His Holy Church.&quot;
** The Priest then says the day&#x27;s Secret inaudibly, and concludes it with &quot;Per omnia sæcula sæculorum&quot; aloud.
** The altar servers and (in dialogue Mass) the congregation respond: &quot;Amen.&quot;

====Consecration====

* Preface of the Canon
**&quot;The Roman Canon dates in essentials from before St. Gregory the Great, who died in 604, and who is credited with adding a phrase to it. (See History of the Roman Canon.) It contains the main elements found in almost all rites, but in an unusual arrangement and it is unclear which part should be considered to be the Epiclesis.
** Dominus vobiscum. &quot;Et cum spiritu tuo.&quot; Sursum corda. &quot;Habemus ad Dominum.&quot; Gratias agimus Domino Deo nostro. &quot;Dignum et iustum est.&quot; The first part can be seen above at the Collect; the rest means: &quot;Lift up your hearts. We lift them up to the Lord. Let us give thanks to the Lord our God. It is right and just&quot;.
**Next a preface is prayed, indicating specific reasons for giving thanks to God. This leads to the Sanctus.
* Canon or rule of consecration
** Intercession (corresponding to the reading of the diptychs in the Byzantine Rite—a diptych is a two-leaf painting, carving or writing tablet.)
*** Here the priest prays for the living, that God may guard, unite and govern the Church together with the Pope and &quot;all those who, holding to the truth, hand on the catholic and apostolic faith&quot;. Then specific living people are mentioned, and the congregation in the church. Next, Mary ever Virgin, Saint Joseph, the Apostles, and some Popes and other Martyrs are mentioned by name, as well as a generic &quot;and all your Saints&quot;, in communion with whom prayer is offered.
** Prayers preparatory to the consecration
*** A prayer that God may graciously accept the offering and &quot;command that we be delivered from eternal damnation and counted among the flock of those you have chosen&quot;.
** Consecration (transubstantiation) and major elevation
*** The passage Lk 22:19–20 is key in this section. In &quot;Summa Theologiae&quot; III 78 3 Thomas Aquinas addresses the interspersed phrase, &quot;the mystery of faith&quot;. On this phrase, see &quot;Mysterium fidei&quot;.
** Oblation of the victim to God
***An oblation is an offering; the pure, holy, spotless victim is now offered, with a prayer that God may accept the offering and command his holy angel to carry the offering to God&#x27;s altar on high, so that those who receive the Body and Blood of Christ &quot;may be filled with every grace and heavenly blessing&quot;.
** Remembrance of the Dead
*** The priest now prays for the dead (&quot;those who have gone before us with the sign of faith and rest in the sleep of peace&quot;) and asks that they be granted a place of refreshment, light and peace. This is followed by a prayer that we be granted fellowship with the Saints. John the Baptist and fourteen martyrs, seven men and seven women, are mentioned by name.
** End of the Canon and doxology with minor elevation
*** The concluding doxology is: &quot;Per ipsum, et cum ipso, et in ipso, est tibi Deo Patri omnipotenti, in unitate Spiritus Sancti&quot;, (&quot;Through him, and with him, and in him, O God, there is to you, almighty Father, in the unity of the Holy Spirit&quot;, − spoken silently while making five signs of the cross with the host) &quot;omnis honor, et gloria.&quot; (&quot;all glory and honour.&quot; − still silently while briefly raising host and chalice a little together). This is followed by replacing the host on the corporal and the pall on the chalice and genuflecting. After this the priest sings or says aloud: &quot;Per omnia sæcula sæculorum&quot; (&quot;For ever and ever.&quot;) The response &quot;Amen&quot; symbolically ratifies the Canon prayer.

====Elevation candle====

Until 1960, the Tridentine form of the Roman Missal laid down that a candle should be placed at the Epistle side of the altar and that it should be lit at the showing of the consecrated sacrament to the people. In practice, except in monasteries and on special occasions, this had fallen out of use long before Pope John XXIII replaced the section on the general rubrics of the Roman Missal with his Code of Rubrics, which no longer mentioned this custom. On this, see Elevation candle.

====Communion====

:::::::::::*The Lord&#x27;s Prayer and Libera nos
::::::::::::*The &quot;Libera nos&quot; is an extension of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer developing the line &quot;sed libera nos a malo&quot; (&quot;but deliver us from evil&quot;). The priest prays that we may be delivered from all evils and that the Virgin Mary, Mother of God, together with the apostles and saints, may intercede to obtain for us peace in our day.
:::::::::::*Fraction of the Host
::::::::::::*During the preceding prayer, the priest breaks the consecrated Host into three parts, and after concluding the prayer drops the smallest part into the Chalice while praying that this commingling and consecration of the Body and Blood of Christ may &quot;be to us who receive it effectual to life everlasting.&quot;
:::::::::::* Agnus Dei
::::::::::::* &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; means &quot;Lamb of God&quot;. The priest then prays: &quot;Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us.&quot; He repeats this, and then adds: &quot;Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, grant us peace.&quot; The Mass of the Last Supper on Holy Thursday has &quot;have mercy on us&quot; all three times. In Requiem Masses, the petitions are &quot;grant them rest&quot; (twice), followed by &quot;grant them eternal rest.&quot;
* The Pax
**The priest asks Christ to look not at the priest&#x27;s sins but at the faith of Christ&#x27;s Church, and prays for peace and unity within the Church. Then, if a High Mass is being celebrated, he gives the sign of peace to the deacon, saying: &quot;Peace be with you.&quot;
*Prayers preparatory to the Communion
** In the first of these two prayers for himself, the priests asks that by Holy Communion he may be freed from all his iniquities and evils, be made to adhere to the commandments of Jesus and never be separated from him. In the second he asks: &quot;Let not the partaking of Thy Body, O Lord Jesus Christ...turn to my judgment and condemnation: but through Thy goodness may it be unto me a safeguard...&quot;
* Receiving of the Body and Blood of our Lord
** The priest quietly says several prayers here, before receiving Communion. The first is said in a low voice while taking up the Host onto the paten. The second of them, spoken three times in a slightly audible voice, while the priest holds the Host in his left hand and strikes his breast with his right, is based on : &quot;Lord, I am not worthy...&quot; Then, after having reverently consumed the Host, he takes up the chalice while in a low voice reciting : &quot;What shall I render to the Lord, for all the things he hath rendered unto me? I will take the chalice of salvation; and I will call upon the name of the Lord.&quot; immediately adding : &quot;Praising I will call upon the Lord: and I shall be saved from my enemies.&quot;

**If the priest is to give Communion to others, he holds up a small host and says aloud: &quot;Behold the Lamb of God ...&quot;, and three times: &quot;Lord, I am not worthy ...&quot;. He then gives Communion, first making with the host the sign of the cross over each communicant, while saying: &quot;May the Body of Our Lord Jesus Christ preserve your soul for eternal life. Amen.&quot;

==== Conclusion ====

* Prayers during the Ablutions
** The prayers now focus on what has been received, that &quot;we may receive with a pure mind&quot;, &quot;that no stain of sin may remain in me, whom these pure and holy sacraments have refreshed.&quot;
* Communion Antiphon and Postcommunion
** The communion antiphon is normally a portion of a Psalm. The Postcommunion Prayer is akin to the Collect in being an appropriate prayer not directly drawn from Scripture.
* Ite Missa est; Blessing
** &quot;Go, it is the dismissal.&quot; The word &quot;Mass&quot; derives from this phrase.
** After saying a silent prayer for himself, the priest then gives the people his blessing.
** Prior to the revisions of Pope Pius XII and Pope John XXIII, the &quot;Ite Missa est&quot; was replaced with &quot;Benedicamus Domino&quot; (&quot;Let us bless the Lord&quot;) on days in which the &quot;Gloria&quot; was not said and the rubrics required the priest to wear violet vestments (i.e., Masses of the season during Advent, Septuagesima, Lent and Passiontide; vigils; certain votive Masses). In the 1962 Missal, &quot;Benedicamus Domino&quot; is said only when the Mass is followed by another liturgical action, such as the Eucharistic Processions on Holy Thursday and Corpus Christi.
** In Requiem Masses, the &quot;Ite Missa est&quot; is replaced with &quot;Requiescant in pace&quot;, with the response being &quot;Amen&quot; instead of &quot;Deo gratias&quot;.
* The Last Gospel
** The priest then reads the Last Gospel, the beginning of the Gospel of John, , which recounts the Incarnation of the Son of God. On certain occasions, as for instance at the Day Mass on Christmas Day, another Gospel passage was read instead because that Gospel is read as the Gospel of the Mass, but Pope John XXIII&#x27;s revision of the rubrics decreed that on those and on other occasions the Last Gospel should simply be omitted.

=== Prayers of the priest before and after Mass ===
The Tridentine Missal includes prayers for the priest to say before and after Mass.

In later editions of the Roman Missal, including that of 1962, the introductory heading of these prayers indicates that they are to be recited &quot;pro opportunitate&quot; (as circumstances allow), which in practice means that they are merely optional and may be omitted. The original Tridentine Missal presents most of the prayers as obligatory, indicating as optional only a very long prayer attributed to Saint Ambrose (which later editions divide into seven sections, each to be recited on only one day of the week) and two other prayers attributed to Saint Ambrose and Saint Thomas Aquinas respectively.

In addition to these three prayers, the original Tridentine Missal proposes for the priest to recite before he celebrates Mass the whole of Psalms 83–85, 115, 129 (the numbering is that of the Septuagint and Vulgate), and a series of collect-style prayers. Later editions add, after the three that in the original Missal are only optional, prayers to the Blessed Virgin, Saint Joseph, all the angels and saints, and the saint whose Mass is to be celebrated, but, as has been said, treats as optional all the prayers before Mass, even those originally given as obligatory.

The original Tridentine Missal proposes for recitation by the priest after Mass three prayers, including the &quot;Adoro te devote&quot;. Later editions place before these three the Canticle of the Three Youths (Dan) with three collects, and follow them with the &quot;Anima Christi&quot; and seven more prayers, treating as optional even the three prescribed in the original Tridentine Missal.

=== Leonine Prayers ===
From 1884 to 1965, the Holy See prescribed the recitation after Low Mass of certain prayers, originally for the solution of the Roman Question and, after this problem was solved by the Lateran Treaty, &quot;to permit tranquillity and freedom to profess the faith to be restored to the afflicted people of Russia&quot;.

These prayers are known as the Leonine Prayers because it was Pope Leo XIII who on 6 January 1884 ordered their recitation throughout the world.

In 1964, with effect from 7 March 1965, the Holy See ended the obligation to recite the Leonine Prayers after Low Mass.

=== Participation of the faithful ===

The participation of the congregation at the Tridentine Mass is interior, involving eye and heart, and exterior by mouth.

Except in the Dialogue Mass form, which arose about 1910 and led to a more active exterior participation of the congregation, the people present at the Tridentine Mass do not recite out loud the prayers of the Mass. Only the server or servers join with the priest in reciting the prayers at the foot of the altar (which include the Confiteor) and in speaking the other responses. Most of the prayers that the priest says are spoken inaudibly, including almost all the Mass of the Faithful: the offertory prayers, the Canon of the Mass (except for the preface and the final doxology), and (apart from the Agnus Dei) those between the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and the postcommunion.

At a Solemn Mass or Missa Cantata, a choir sings the servers&#x27; responses, except for the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar. The choir sings the Introit, the Kyrie, the Gloria, the Gradual, the Tract or Alleluia, the Credo, the Offertory and Communion antiphons, the Sanctus, and the Agnus Dei. Of these, only the five that form part of the Ordinary of the Mass are usually sung at a Missa Cantata. In addition to the Gregorian Chant music for these, polyphonic compositions exist, some quite elaborate. The priest largely says quietly the words of the chants.

== Different levels of solemnity of celebration ==
There are various forms of solemnity of celebration of the Tridentine Mass:
* Papal Mass (Latin: &quot;Missa Pāpālis&quot;): celebrated by the Pope, served by a cardinal-bishop assisting priest, the Apostolic Deacon, more cardinal-deacons, and a greek-catholic deacon and subdeacon, in Latin and Greek, with many unique traditions and vestments. It is a higher form derivative of the pontifical high mass given the pope&#x27;s position as the Pontifex maximus.
* Pontifical High Mass (Latin: &quot;Missa pontificalis&quot;): celebrated by a bishop accompanied by an assisting priest, deacon, subdeacon, thurifer, acolytes and other ministers, under the guidance of a priest acting as Master of Ceremonies. Most often the specific parts assigned to deacon and subdeacon are performed by priests. The parts that are said aloud are all chanted, except that the Prayers at the Foot of the Altar, which before the reform of Pope Pius V were said in the sacristy, are said quietly by the bishop with the deacon and the subdeacon, while the choir sings the Introit. The main difference between a pontifical and an ordinary High Mass is that the bishop remains at his cathedra almost all the time until the offertory.
* Solemn or High Mass (Latin: &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;): offered by a priest accompanied by a deacon and subdeacon and the other ministers mentioned above.
* Missa Cantata (Latin for &quot;sung mass&quot;): celebrated by a priest without deacon and subdeacon, and thus a form of Low Mass, but with some parts (the three variable prayers, the Scripture readings, Preface, Pater Noster, and Ite Missa Est) sung by the priest, and other parts (Introit, Kyrie, Gloria, Gradual, Tract or Alleluia, Credo, Offertory Antiphon, Sanctus and Benedictus, Agnus Dei, and Communion Antiphon) sung by the choir. Incense may be used exactly as at a Solemn Mass with the exception of incensing the celebrant after the Gospel which is not done.
* Low Mass (Latin: &quot;Missa privata&quot;): the priest sings no part of the Mass, though in some places a choir or the congregation sings, during the Mass, hymns not always directly related to the Mass. Note: the term &quot;missa privata&quot; was discouraged in 1962 for the misunderstanding of &quot;privata&quot; to mean private/non-public rather than &#x27;deprived&#x27; of the fullness of ceremony.

In its article &quot;The Liturgy of the Mass&quot;, the 1917 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; describes how, when concelebration ceased to be practised in Western Europe, Low Mass became distinguished from High Mass:

:The separate celebrations then involved the building of many altars in one church and the reduction of the ritual to the simplest possible form. The deacon and subdeacon were in this case dispensed with; the celebrant took their part as well as his own. One server took the part of the choir and of all the other ministers, everything was said instead of being sung, the incense and kiss of peace were omitted. So we have the well-known rite of low Mass (&quot;missa privata&quot;). This then reacted on high Mass (&quot;missa solemnis&quot;), so that at high Mass too the celebrant himself recites everything, even though it be sung by the deacon, subdeacon, or choir.

On the origin of the &quot;Missa Cantata&quot;, the same source gives the following information about the Tridentine concept at the time:

:high Mass is the norm; it is only in the complete rite with deacon and subdeacon that the ceremonies can be understood. Thus, the rubrics of the Ordinary of the Mass always suppose that the Mass is high. Low Mass, said by a priest alone with one server, is a shortened and simplified form of the same thing. Its ritual can be explained only by a reference to high Mass. For instance, the celebrant goes over to the north side of the altar to read the Gospel, because that is the side to which the deacon goes in procession at high Mass; he turns round always by the right, because at high Mass he should not turn his back to the deacon and so on. A sung Mass (&quot;missa Cantata&quot;) is a modern compromise. It is really a low Mass, since the essence of high Mass is not the music but the deacon and subdeacon. Only in churches which have no ordained person except one priest, and in which high Mass is thus impossible, is it allowed to celebrate the Mass (on Sundays and feasts) with most of the adornment borrowed from high Mass, with singing and (generally) with incense.

A &quot;Missa brevis&quot; is a musical setting of a Mass where the choir and musicians do not perform some parts of the Ordinary of the Mass they potentially could, such as the Gloria or Creed. This is not related to the distinctions above.

== Revision of the Roman Missal ==
Pius XII began in earnest the work of revising the Roman Missal with a revision of the rites of Holy Week, which, after an experimental period beginning in 1951, was made obligatory in 1955.

On 4 December 1963, the Second Vatican Council decreed in Chapter II of its Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;:
[T]he rite of the Mass is to be revised ... the rites are to be simplified, due care being taken to preserve their substance. Parts which with the passage of time came to be duplicated, or were added with little advantage, are to be omitted. Other parts which suffered loss through accidents of history are to be restored to the vigor they had in the days of the holy Fathers, as may seem useful or necessary. The treasures of the Bible are to be opened up more lavishly so that a richer fare may be provided for the faithful at the table of God&#x27;s word ... A suitable place may be allotted to the vernacular in Masses which are celebrated with the people ... communion under both kinds may be granted when the bishops think fit...as, for instance, to the newly ordained in the Mass of their sacred ordination, to the newly professed in the Mass of their religious profession, and to the newly baptized in the Mass which follows their baptism...

The instruction &quot;Inter Oecumenici&quot; of 26 September 1964 initiated the application to the Mass of the decisions that the Council had taken less than a year before. Permission was given for use, only in Mass celebrated with the people, of the vernacular language, especially in the Biblical readings and the reintroduced Prayers of the Faithful, but, &quot;until the whole of the Ordinary of the Mass has been revised&quot;, in the chants (Kyrie, Gloria, Creed, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and the entrance, offertory and communion antiphons) and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people, and in the Our Father, which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest. Most Episcopal Conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations, generally different from country to country, and, after having them confirmed by the Holy See, published them in 1965. Other changes included the omission of Psalm 43 (42) at the start of Mass and the Last Gospel at the end, both of which Pope Pius V had first inserted into the Missal (having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy), and the Leonine Prayers of Pope Leo XIII. The Canon of the Mass, which continued to be recited silently, was kept in Latin.

Three years later, the instruction &quot;Tres abhinc annos&quot; of 4 May 1967 gave permission for use of the vernacular even in the Canon of the Mass, and allowed it to be said audibly and even, in part, to be chanted; the vernacular could be used even at Mass celebrated without the people being present. Use of the maniple was made optional, and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead.

Pope Paul VI continued implementation of the Council&#x27;s directives, ordering with Apostolic Constitution &quot;Missale Romanum&quot; of Holy Thursday, 3 April 1969, publication of a new official edition of the Roman Missal, which appeared (in Latin) in 1970.

===Opposition to the latest revisions of the liturgy===
Some Traditionalist Catholics reject to a greater or lesser extent the changes made since 1950. None advocate returning to the original (1570) form of the liturgy, though some may perhaps wish a re-establishment of its form before Pius X&#x27;s revision of the rubrics in 1911. Some are critical of the 1955 changes in the liturgy of Palm Sunday and the Easter Triduum and in the liturgical calendar (see General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII), and instead use the General Roman Calendar as in 1954. Others accept the 1955 changes by Pius XII, but not those of Pope John XXIII. Others again, in accordance with the authorization granted by Pope Benedict XVI in &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot;, use the Missal and calendar as it was in 1962. They argue that many of the changes made to the liturgy in 1955 and onward were largely the work of liturgist Annibale Bugnini, whom traditionalists say was more interested in innovation than the preservation of the apostolic traditions of the Church.

Some of them argue that, unlike earlier reforms, the revision of 1969–1970 which replaced the Tridentine Mass with the Mass of Pope Paul VI represented a major break with the past. They consider that the content of the revised liturgy is, in Catholic terms, seriously deficient and defective; some hold that it is displeasing to God, and that no Catholic should attend it.

When a preliminary text of two of the sections of the revised Missal was published in 1969, Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre (who later established Society of Saint Pius X) gathered a group of twelve theologians, who, under his direction, wrote a study of the text. They stated that it &quot;represents, both as a whole and in its details, a striking departure from the Catholic theology of the Mass as it was formulated in Session 22 of the Council of Trent&quot;. Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, a former Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, supported this study with a letter of 25 September 1969 to Pope Paul VI. Cardinal Antonio Bacci signed the same letter. The critical study became known as &quot;the Ottaviani Intervention&quot;. Cardinal Ottaviani subsequently stated in writing that he had not intended his letter to be made public, and that Pope Paul VI&#x27;s doctrinal exposition, on 19 November and 26 November 1969, of the revised liturgy in its definitive form meant that &quot;no one can be genuinely scandalized any more&quot;. 

From the 1960s onwards, Western countries have experienced a drop in Mass attendance. For example, in the United States, 75% of Catholics attended church weekly in 1958, declining to 25% attending by 2002; another study suggests a peak weekly attendance of 72% in 1959–60. Western countries also saw a decline in seminary enrollments and in the number of priests (in the United States, from 1,575 ordinations in 1954 to 450 in 2002), and a general erosion of belief in the doctrines of the Catholic faith. Opponents of the revision of the Mass liturgy argue, citing opinion poll evidence in their support, that the revision contributed to this decline. Others, pointing, among other considerations, to the fact that, globally, there are more priests and seminarians now than in previous years (in 1970, there were 72,991 major seminarians worldwide, in 2002, there were 113,199, an increase of 55%, at a time, however, when there was an increase of global population of 64%), suggests that the apparent decline of Catholic practice in the West is due to the general influence of secularism and liberalism on Western societies rather than to developments within the Church. In the United States however, Traditional Catholic parishes have been growing since 2007 even as overall Catholic attendance continues to decline. In 2021, it was estimated that 150,000 Catholics regularly attend the Tridentine Mass in the US, representing less than 1% of the 21 million Catholics regularly attending Mass throughout the US.

==Attitudes of Popes since the Second Vatican Council==
===Pope Paul VI===
Following the introduction of the Mass of Paul VI in 1969–1970, the Holy See granted a significant number of permissions for the use of the former liturgy. For example, elderly priests were not required to switch to celebrating the new form. In England and Wales, occasional celebrations of the Tridentine Mass were allowed in virtue of what became known as the &quot;Agatha Christie indult&quot;. However, there was no general worldwide legal framework allowing for the celebration of the rite. Following the rise of the Traditionalist Catholic movement in the 1970s, Pope Paul VI reportedly declined to liberalise its use further on the grounds that it had become a politically charged symbol associated with opposition to his policies.

===Pope John Paul II===
In 1984, the Holy See sent a letter known as &quot;Quattuor abhinc annos&quot; to the presidents of the world&#x27;s Episcopal Conferences. This document empowered diocesan bishops to authorise, on certain conditions, celebrations of the Tridentine Mass for priests and laypeople who requested them. In 1988, following the excommunication of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and the four bishops consecrated by him, the Pope issued the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot;, which stated that &quot;respect must everywhere be shown for the feelings of all those who are attached to the Latin liturgical tradition&quot;. The Pope urged bishops to give &quot;a wide and generous application&quot; to the provisions of &quot;Quattuor abhinc annos&quot;, and established the Pontifical Commission &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot; to oversee relations between Rome and Traditionalist Catholics.

===Pope Benedict XVI===
As a cardinal, Joseph Ratzinger was regarded as having a particular interest in the liturgy, and as being favourable towards the pre-Vatican II Mass. Before his election he celebrated it on number of occasions. He criticized the erratic way in which, contrary to official policy, many priests celebrated the post-Vatican II form.

In September 2006, the Pontifical Commission &quot;Ecclesia Dei&quot; established the Institute of the Good Shepherd, made up of former members of the Society of St. Pius X, in Bordeaux, France, with permission to use the Tridentine liturgy. This step was met with some discontent from French clergy, and thirty priests wrote an open letter to the Pope. In line with its previous stance, the Society of St Pius X rejected the move.

Following repeated rumours that the use of the Tridentine Mass would be liberalised, the Pope issued a &quot;motu proprio&quot; called &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; on 7 July 2007, together with an accompanying letter to the world&#x27;s bishops. The declaring that &quot;the Roman Missal promulgated by Paul VI is the ordinary expression of the &quot;lex orandi&quot; (law of prayer) of the Catholic Church of the Latin rite. Nevertheless, the Roman Missal promulgated by St. Pius V and reissued by St. John XXIII is to be considered as an extraordinary expression of that same &#x27;Lex orandi. He further stated that &quot;the 1962 Missal ... was never juridically abrogated&quot;. He replaced with new rules those of &quot;Quattuor Abhinc Annos&quot; on use of the older form: essentially, authorization for using the 1962 form for parish Masses and those celebrated on public occasions such as a wedding is devolved from the local bishop to the priest in charge of a church, and &quot;any priest of the Latin rite&quot; may use the 1962 Roman Missal in &quot;Masses celebrated without the people&quot;, a term that does not exclude attendance by other worshippers, lay or clergy. While requests by groups of Catholics wishing to use the Tridentine liturgy in parish Masses are to be dealt with by the parish priest (or the rector of the church) rather than, as before, by the local bishop, the Pope and Cardinal Darío Castrillón stated that the bishops&#x27; authority is not thereby undermined.

===Pope Francis===
Pope Francis on 16 July 2021 released an Apostolic Letter &quot;Motu Proprio&quot;, &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, on the use of the Roman Liturgy prior to the Reform of 1970. In &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, the Pope says &quot;the liturgical books promulgated by Saint Paul VI and Saint John Paul II, in conformity with the decrees of Vatican Council II, are the unique expression of the &quot;lex orandi&quot; of the Roman Rite&quot;. He also greatly restricted the use of the Tridentine Mass.

Pope Francis added that it is the exclusive competence of the local bishop to authorize the use of the 1962 Roman Missal in his diocese, according to the guidelines of the Apostolic See.

Pope Francis expressed to the Bishops of the world in his letter accompanying the motu proprio that there is a need in &quot;due time&quot; for those who are attached to the 1962 Mass to return to the celebration of the Mass of Paul VI.

In June 2022, Pope Francis issued the Apostolic Letter &quot;Desiderio Desideravi&quot;, where he stated that he did not believe the 1962 Missal was the path forward for the Church, insisting that the Church could not &quot;go back to the ritual form which the Council Fathers sought the need to reform&quot;.

In February 2023, Pope Francis issued a rescript, clarifying that bishops must obtain authorization from the Holy See before granting permission for parish churches to be used for Eucharistic celebrations with the preconciliar rite and before allowing priests ordained after 16 July 2021 to use the 1962 Roman Missal.

=== Present regulations and practice ===

The regulations set out in &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; provide that:
* The bishop of the diocese is the sole authority to decide whether the celebration of Mass according to the 1962 Roman Missal may take place in his diocese. He must abide by the following norms:
**The bishop must decide the locations and times when Mass according to the 1962 rubrics may take place. This cannot occur within parochial churches, nor can the bishop erect new personal parishes dedicated to the celebration of Mass according to the 1962 Missal. 
**The bishop must ensure that the existing communities that celebrate Mass according to the 1962 rubrics are effective for the spiritual growth of his people, and he has the option to revoke the permissions given to these communities. He may not authorize the establishment of new groups that gather for celebration according to the 1962 Roman Missal.
**The bishop should appoint a priest to act as a delegate for the pastoral care of the groups of the faithful attached to the 1962 liturgical rites. The priest must understand the Missal of 1962 well, must be well-versed in Ecclesiastical Latin, and must exhibit pastoral charity and a desire for ecclesial communion.
*Priests ordained before the publication of &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; (16 July 2021) who celebrated Mass according to the 1962 Missal before the publication of &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; should request permission from the bishop of the diocese to continue to celebrate Mass according to the 1962 rubrics.
*Priests ordained after the publication of &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; must submit a formal request to the bishop of the diocese in order to gain permission to celebrate Mass according to the 1962 Roman Missal. The bishop must then consult the Holy See before the bishop grants permission to the priest.
*The scriptural readings in a Mass celebrated according to the 1962 Missal are to be proclaimed in the vernacular according to the translation approved by the respective Episcopal Conference.
*Communities belonging to institutes of consecrated life and societies of apostolic life which use the 1962 Missal for conventual or &quot;community&quot; celebration in their oratories fall under the competence of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, which has the authority to grant and revoke permission to celebrate Mass according to the 1962 Missal.

The &quot;motu proprio Traditionis custodes&quot; abrogates all previous norms, instructions, permissions and customs that do not conform to it.

In December 2021, additional restrictions and guidelines were issued by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the form of a &quot;Responsa ad dubia:&quot;
* if a non-parish church, oratory or chapel cannot be found for a group to gather to celebrate the Mass according to the 1962 Missal, the diocesan bishop can ask the Holy See for permission to use a parish church; however, the Mass should not be listed in the parish schedule and when a non-parish church, oratory or chapel becomes available, the permission to celebrate the Mass in the parish church will be withdrawn.
* The diocesan bishop is only authorized to grant permission to personal parishes dedicated to the celebration of the 1962 Missal, to be able to celebrate the sacraments of Baptism, Reconciliation, Matrimony and Extreme Unction according to the pre-Vatican II Roman Ritual.
* The diocesan bishop is not authorized to grant permission for the use of the Pontificale Romanum (the Pontifical Missal) issued in 1962. This also means that the sacraments of Holy Orders and Confirmation may only be celebrated in the post-Vatican II form. 
* In order for a priest to be granted permission to celebrate the Mass according to the Missal of 1962, he must recognize the validity and legitimacy of concelebration and is not to refuse to concelebrate at the diocesan Chrism Mass.
* No vernacular lectionaries may be published that reproduce the cycle of readings from the 1962 Rite.
* The faculty to celebrate according to the 1962 missal, granted by a diocesan bishop to a priest, is restricted to the territory of that diocese.
* Deacons and instituted ministers participating in the celebration of Mass according to the 1962 missal, must have permission from the diocesan bishop to do so.
* A priest who has been granted faculties to celebrate the 1962 missal is not permitted to celebrate both the Mass according to the 1962 missal and the post-Vatican II missal on the same day.

In December 2021, in an interview with the &quot;National Catholic Register&quot;, Arthur Roche, the Prefect for the Congregation in charge of the implementation of &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot;, reiterated Pope Francis&#x27; statement that the Mass according to the Missal promulgated by Paul VI and John Paul II, is &quot;the unique expression of the lex orandi of the Roman Rite&quot;. Roche also emphasized that &quot;the liturgy is never simply a matter of personal tastes or preference&quot; and that the lex orandi is &quot;determined by the Church and not individual members&quot;. Roche also stated that continuing to allow the celebration of Mass according to the Tridentine form was a concession and that the promotion of the Tridentine Mass has &quot;been curtailed&quot;.

In February 2022, the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, a society of apostolic life dedicated to the celebration of the Traditional Liturgy, was granted full permission to celebrate the Traditional Mass, Breviary, Sacraments and the Pontifical Missal. The permission is restricted to the Fraternity&#x27;s churches and oratories, unless the local ordinary grants permission for priests of the fraternity to celebrate elsewhere in the Diocese, with the exception of private masses.

<text>John William Stevenson (born September 10, 1963) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer. He is the drummer, main songwriter, and only constant member of the California punk rock group Descendents since its inception. In late December 1981, he played a few concerts with the hardcore punk band Black Flag because their drummer, Robo was detained in England after a tour there. He went on to record with Black Flag on several of their albums until 1985, including the highly influential &quot;My War&quot;. After this, he focused his attention on Descendents and played with the band until lead singer Milo Aukerman left in 1987. After Milo&#x27;s departure, Bill and the other members of Descendents, Karl Alvarez and Stephen Egerton, recruited singer Dave Smalley of Dag Nasty, moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, and formed ALL. ALL went on to have two more singers, Scott Reynolds (1989–1993) and Chad Price (1993–present). Aukerman came back for the 1996 album &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, the 2004 album &quot;Cool to Be You&quot;, 2016&#x27;s &quot;Hypercaffium Spazzinate&quot; and the newest album &quot;9th and Walnut&quot;. All and Descendents continue to tour between Stevenson&#x27;s and Aukerman&#x27;s respective careers as a recording engineer and a biochemist.
Stevenson was born in Torrance, California and attended Mira Costa High School, with fellow members of the Descendents.

Stevenson, along with record producer Jason Livermore are the founders of the recording studio The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Currently, Stevenson is involved in Russ Rankin&#x27;s side project Only Crime with former members of GWAR and Converge.

In 2005, he became a member of instrumental group The Mag Seven, and produced the group&#x27;s album. He also played with The Lemonheads from 2005 to 2007, appearing on their 2006 self titled album, which he also helped produce.

Stevenson produced As I Lay Dying&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Awakened&quot;, the 2012 NOFX album &quot;Self Entitled&quot; as well as Rise Against&#x27;s seventh and ninth studio albums, &quot;The Black Market&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Generation&quot;, released July 15, 2014 and June 4, 2021 respectively.

One of Stevenson&#x27;s most recent works was the production of Frenzal Rhomb&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;The Cup of Pestilence&quot;, released April 7, 2023.

==Early life==
Bill Stevenson (birth name; John William Stevenson) was born on September 10, 1963. Stevenson grew up mostly with his father, Steve Stevenson. He describes his father as a cold man but present for him. Steve Stevenson worked two jobs and was out of the house 22 hours a day. Steve would come to give Bill food and put him to bed. Around the age of fourteen or fifteen, Stevenson started working for Keith Morris&#x27; father as a fisherman. He attended Mira Costa High School where he met his friends and future bandmates of Descendents.

==Career==
Stevenson is an original member of the Descendents forming in 1978. The Descendents put out a single called &quot;Ride the Wild / It&#x27;s a Hectic World&quot; in 1979. In 1982 they put out their first album &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;. After the album, singer Milo Aukerman went to college, the band played rarely, so Stevenson joined Black Flag. He left Black Flag in 1985 to reform the Descendents. The Descendents became All in 1988 after Aukerman left once again. The Descendents would form again from 1996 to 1997 and then in 2002, before going on hiatus. From 2003 to 2007, Stevenson played in smaller bands until All played shows again in 2008. In 2010, the Descendents reformed again.

===Membership timeline===
== Personal life ==
Bill Stevenson has never tried recreational drugs in his life other than alcohol, which he did not drink until later in life.

In recent years, Stevenson has had some health issues. He developed a brain tumor unknowingly around 2008, which remained for another two years before being removed. The tumor caused Stevenson to lose motivation and eventually made him gain weight, had a blood clot, diabetes and sleep apnea. In 2010, he had a successful surgery to remove it which helped him to gain his health back. In 2016, Stevenson revealed he had open heart surgery.

<doc id="147845" wikidata="Q217302" url="?curid=147845" title="Application-specific integrated circuit">
<text>An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC ) is an integrated circuit (IC) chip customized for a particular use, rather than intended for general-purpose use, such as a chip designed to run in a digital voice recorder or a high-efficiency video codec. Application-specific standard product chips are intermediate between ASICs and industry standard integrated circuits like the 7400 series or the 4000 series. ASIC chips are typically fabricated using metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) technology, as MOS integrated circuit chips.

As feature sizes have shrunk and chip design tools improved over the years, the maximum complexity (and hence functionality) possible in an ASIC has grown from 5,000 logic gates to over 100 million. Modern ASICs often include entire microprocessors, memory blocks including ROM, RAM, EEPROM, flash memory and other large building blocks. Such an ASIC is often termed a SoC (system-on-chip). Designers of digital ASICs often use a hardware description language (HDL), such as Verilog or VHDL, to describe the functionality of ASICs.

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are the modern-day technology improvement on breadboards, meaning that they are not made to be application-specific as opposed to ASICs. Programmable logic blocks and programmable interconnects allow the same FPGA to be used in many different applications. For smaller designs or lower production volumes, FPGAs may be more cost-effective than an ASIC design, even in production. The non-recurring engineering (NRE) cost of an ASIC can run into the millions of dollars. Therefore, device manufacturers typically prefer FPGAs for prototyping and devices with low production volume and ASICs for very large production volumes where NRE costs can be amortized across many devices.

== History ==
Early ASICs used gate array technology. By 1967, Ferranti and Interdesign were manufacturing early bipolar gate arrays. In 1967, Fairchild Semiconductor introduced the Micromatrix family of bipolar diode–transistor logic (DTL) and transistor–transistor logic (TTL) arrays.

Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) technology opened the door to the broad commercialization of gate arrays. The first CMOS gate arrays were developed by Robert Lipp, in 1974 for International Microcircuits, Inc. (IMI).

Metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) standard-cell technology was introduced by Fairchild and Motorola, under the trade names Micromosaic and Polycell, in the 1970s. This technology was later successfully commercialized by VLSI Technology (founded 1979) and LSI Logic (1981).

A successful commercial application of gate array circuitry was found in the low-end 8-bit ZX81 and ZX Spectrum personal computers, introduced in 1981 and 1982. These were used by Sinclair Research (UK) essentially as a low-cost I/O solution aimed at handling the computer&#x27;s graphics.

Customization occurred by varying a metal interconnect mask. Gate arrays had complexities of up to a few thousand gates; this is now called mid-scale integration. Later versions became more generalized, with different base dies customized by both metal and polysilicon layers. Some base dies also include random-access memory (RAM) elements.

== Standard-cell designs ==
In the mid-1980s, a designer would choose an ASIC manufacturer and implement their design using the design tools available from the manufacturer. While third-party design tools were available, there was not an effective link from the third-party design tools to the layout and actual semiconductor process performance characteristics of the various ASIC manufacturers. Most designers used factory-specific tools to complete the implementation of their designs. A solution to this problem, which also yielded a much higher density device, was the implementation of standard cells. Every ASIC manufacturer could create functional blocks with known electrical characteristics, such as propagation delay, capacitance and inductance, that could also be represented in third-party tools. Standard-cell design is the utilization of these functional blocks to achieve very high gate density and good electrical performance. Standard-cell design is intermediate between and in terms of its non-recurring engineering and recurring component costs as well as performance and speed of development (including time to market).

By the late 1990s, logic synthesis tools became available. Such tools could compile HDL descriptions into a gate-level netlist. Standard-cell integrated circuits (ICs) are designed in the following conceptual stages referred to as electronics design flow, although these stages overlap significantly in practice:
# Requirements engineering: A team of design engineers starts with a non-formal understanding of the required functions for a new ASIC, usually derived from requirements analysis.
# Register-transfer level (RTL) design: The design team constructs a description of an ASIC to achieve these goals using a hardware description language. This process is similar to writing a computer program in a high-level language.
# Functional verification: Suitability for purpose is verified by functional verification. This may include such techniques as logic simulation through test benches, formal verification, emulation, or creating and evaluating an equivalent pure software model, as in Simics. Each verification technique has advantages and disadvantages, and most often several methods are used together for ASIC verification. Unlike most FPGAs, ASICs cannot be reprogrammed once fabricated and therefore ASIC designs that are not completely correct are much more costly, increasing the need for full test coverage.
# Logic synthesis: Logic synthesis transforms the RTL design into a large collection called of lower-level constructs called standard cells. These constructs are taken from a standard-cell library consisting of pre-characterized collections of logic gates performing specific functions. The standard cells are typically specific to the planned manufacturer of the ASIC. The resulting collection of standard cells and the needed electrical connections between them is called a gate-level netlist.
# Placement: The gate-level netlist is next processed by a placement tool which places the standard cells onto a region of an integrated circuit die representing the final ASIC. The placement tool attempts to find an optimized placement of the standard cells, subject to a variety of specified constraints.
# Routing: An electronics routing tool takes the physical placement of the standard cells and uses the netlist to create the electrical connections between them. Since the search space is large, this process will produce a &quot;sufficient&quot; rather than &quot;globally optimal&quot; solution. The output is a file which can be used to create a set of photomasks enabling a semiconductor fabrication facility, commonly called a &#x27;fab&#x27; or &#x27;foundry&#x27; to manufacture physical integrated circuits. Placement and routing are closely interrelated and are collectively called place and route in electronics design.
# Sign-off: Given the final layout, circuit extraction computes the parasitic resistances and capacitances. In the case of a digital circuit, this will then be further mapped into delay information from which the circuit performance can be estimated, usually by static timing analysis. This, and other final tests such as design rule checking and power analysis collectively called signoff are intended to ensure that the device will function correctly over all extremes of the process, voltage and temperature. When this testing is complete the photomask information is released for chip fabrication.

These steps, implemented with a level of skill common in the industry, almost always produce a final device that correctly implements the original design, unless flaws are later introduced by the physical fabrication process.

The design steps also called design flow, are also common to standard product design. The significant difference is that standard-cell design uses the manufacturer&#x27;s cell libraries that have been used in potentially hundreds of other design implementations and therefore are of much lower risk than a full custom design. Standard cells produce a design density that is cost-effective, and they can also integrate IP cores and static random-access memory (SRAM) effectively, unlike gate arrays.

== Gate-array and semi-custom design ==


Gate array design is a manufacturing method in which diffused layers, each consisting of transistors and other active devices, are predefined and electronics wafers containing such devices are &quot;held in stock&quot; or unconnected prior to the metallization stage of the fabrication process. The physical design process defines the interconnections of these layers for the final device. For most ASIC manufacturers, this consists of between two and nine metal layers with each layer running perpendicular to the one below it. Non-recurring engineering costs are much lower than full custom designs, as photolithographic masks are required only for the metal layers. Production cycles are much shorter, as metallization is a comparatively quick process; thereby accelerating time to market.

Gate-array ASICs are always a compromise between rapid design and performance as mapping a given design onto what a manufacturer held as a stock wafer never gives 100% circuit utilization. Often difficulties in routing the interconnect require migration onto a larger array device with a consequent increase in the piece part price. These difficulties are often a result of the layout EDA software used to develop the interconnect.

Pure, logic-only gate-array design is rarely implemented by circuit designers today, having been almost entirely replaced by field-programmable devices. The most prominent of such devices are field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which can be programmed by the user and thus offer minimal tooling charges, non-recurring engineering, only marginally increased piece part cost, and comparable performance.

Today, gate arrays are evolving into structured ASICs that consist of a large IP core like a CPU, digital signal processor units, peripherals, standard interfaces, integrated memories, SRAM, and a block of reconfigurable, uncommitted logic. This shift is largely because ASIC devices are capable of integrating large blocks of system functionality, and systems on a chip (SoCs) require glue logic, communications subsystems (such as networks on chip), peripherals, and other components rather than only functional units and basic interconnection.

In their frequent usages in the field, the terms &quot;gate array&quot; and &quot;semi-custom&quot; are synonymous when referring to ASICs. Process engineers more commonly use the term &quot;semi-custom&quot;, while &quot;gate-array&quot; is more commonly used by logic (or gate-level) designers.

== Full-custom design ==

By contrast, full-custom ASIC design defines all the photolithographic layers of the device. Full-custom design is used for both ASIC design and for standard product design.

The benefits of full-custom design include reduced area (and therefore recurring component cost), performance improvements, and also the ability to integrate analog components and other pre-designed—and thus fully verified—components, such as microprocessor cores, that form a system on a chip.

The disadvantages of full-custom design can include increased manufacturing and design time, increased non-recurring engineering costs, more complexity in the computer-aided design (CAD) and electronic design automation systems, and a much higher skill requirement on the part of the design team.

For digital-only designs, however, &quot;standard-cell&quot; cell libraries, together with modern CAD systems, can offer considerable performance/cost benefits with low risk. Automated layout tools are quick and easy to use and also offer the possibility to &quot;hand-tweak&quot; or manually optimize any performance-limiting aspect of the design.

This is designed by using basic logic gates, circuits or layout specially for a design.

== Structured design ==
&quot;Structured ASIC design&quot; (also referred to as &quot;platform ASIC design&quot;) is a relatively new trend in the semiconductor industry, resulting in some variation in its definition. However, the basic premise of a structured ASIC is that both manufacturing cycle time and design cycle time are reduced compared to cell-based ASIC, by virtue of there being pre-defined metal layers (thus reducing manufacturing time) and pre-characterization of what is on the silicon (thus reducing design cycle time).

Definition from Foundations of Embedded Systems states that: 

This is effectively the same definition as a gate array. What distinguishes a structured ASIC from a gate array is that in a gate array, the predefined metal layers serve to make manufacturing turnaround faster. In a structured ASIC, the use of predefined metallization is primarily to reduce cost of the mask sets as well as making the design cycle time significantly shorter.

For example, in a cell-based or gate-array design the user must often design power, clock, and test structures themselves. By contrast, these are predefined in most structured ASICs and therefore can save time and expense for the designer compared to gate-array based designs. Likewise, the design tools used for structured ASIC can be substantially lower cost and easier (faster) to use than cell-based tools, because they do not have to perform all the functions that cell-based tools do. In some cases, the structured ASIC vendor requires customized tools for their device (e.g., custom physical synthesis) be used, also allowing for the design to be brought into manufacturing more quickly.

== Cell libraries, IP-based design, hard and soft macros ==
Cell libraries of logical primitives are usually provided by the device manufacturer as part of the service. Although they will incur no additional cost, their release will be covered by the terms of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and they will be regarded as intellectual property by the manufacturer. Usually, their physical design will be pre-defined so they could be termed &quot;hard macros&quot;.

What most engineers understand as &quot;intellectual property&quot; are IP cores, designs purchased from a third-party as sub-components of a larger ASIC. They may be provided in the form of a hardware description language (often termed a &quot;soft macro&quot;), or as a fully routed design that could be printed directly onto an ASIC&#x27;s mask (often termed a &quot;hard macro&quot;). Many organizations now sell such pre-designed cores – CPUs, Ethernet, USB or telephone interfaces – and larger organizations may have an entire department or division to produce cores for the rest of the organization. The company ARM &quot;only&quot; sells IP cores, making it a fabless manufacturer.

Indeed, the wide range of functions now available in structured ASIC design is a result of the phenomenal improvement in electronics in the late 1990s and early 2000s; as a core takes a lot of time and investment to create, its re-use and further development cuts product cycle times dramatically and creates better products. Additionally, open-source hardware organizations such as OpenCores are collecting free IP cores, paralleling the open-source software movement in hardware design.

Soft macros are often process-independent (i.e. they can be fabricated on a wide range of manufacturing processes and different manufacturers). Hard macros are process-limited and usually further design effort must be invested to migrate (port) to a different process or manufacturer.

== Multi-project wafers ==
Some manufacturers and IC design houses offer multi-project wafer service (MPW) as a method of obtaining low cost prototypes. Often called shuttles, these MPWs, containing several designs, run at regular, scheduled intervals on a &quot;cut and go&quot; basis, usually with limited liability on the part of the manufacturer. The contract involves delivery of bare dies or the assembly and packaging of a handful of devices. The service usually involves the supply of a physical design database (i.e. masking information or pattern generation (PG) tape). The manufacturer is often referred to as a &quot;silicon foundry&quot; due to the low involvement it has in the process.

== Application-specific standard product ==

An application-specific standard product or ASSP is an integrated circuit that implements a specific function that appeals to a wide market. As opposed to ASICs that combine a collection of functions and are designed by or for one customer, ASSPs are available as off-the-shelf components. ASSPs are used in all industries, from automotive to communications.

For example, two ICs that might or might not be considered ASICs are a controller chip for a PC and a chip for a modem. Both of these examples are specific to an application (which is typical of an ASIC) but are sold to many different system vendors (which is typical of standard parts). ASICs such as these are sometimes called application-specific standard products (ASSPs).

Examples of ASICs are Ethernet network interface controller, flash memory controller, etc. Some processors, such as GPU, are actually composed of many ASICs.

<text>Abstract expressionism in the United States emerged as a distinct art movement in the immediate aftermath of World War II and gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s, a shift from the American social realism of the 1930s influenced by the Great Depression and Mexican muralists. The term was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates. Key figures in the New York School, which was the center of this movement, included such artists as Arshile Gorky, Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Norman Lewis, Willem de Kooning, Adolph Gottlieb, Clyfford Still, Robert Motherwell, Theodoros Stamos and Lee Krasner among others.

The movement was not limited to painting but included influential collagists and sculptors, such as David Smith, Louise Nevelson, and others. Abstract expressionism was notably influenced by the spontaneous and subconscious creation methods of Surrealist artists like André Masson and Max Ernst. Artists associated with the movement combined the emotional intensity of German Expressionism with the radical visual vocabularies of European avant-garde schools like Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism.

Abstract expressionism was seen as rebellious and idiosyncratic, encompassing various artistic styles, and was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the Western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Contemporary art critics played a significant role in its development. Critics like Clement Greenberg and Harold Rosenberg promoted the work of artists associated with abstract expressionism, in particular Jackson Pollock, through their writings. Rosenberg&#x27;s concept of the canvas as an &quot;arena in which to act&quot; was pivotal in defining the approach of action painters. The cultural reign of abstract expressionism in the United States had diminished by the early 1960s, while the subsequent rejection of the abstract Expressionist emphasis on individualism led to the development of such movements as Pop art and Minimalism. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, influence of AbEx can be seen in diverse movements in the U.S. and Europe, including Tachisme and Neo-expressionism, among others.

The term &quot;abstract expressionism&quot; is believed to have first been used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine &quot;Der Sturm&quot; in reference to German Expressionism. Alfred Barr used this term in 1929 to describe works by Wassily Kandinsky. The term was used in the United States in 1946 by Robert Coates in his review of 18 Hans Hofmann paintings.

== Style ==
Technically, an important predecessor is Surrealism, with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Jackson Pollock&#x27;s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of André Masson, Max Ernst, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. The newer research tends to put the exile-surrealist Wolfgang Paalen in the position of the artist and theoretician who fostered the theory of the viewer-dependent possibility space through his paintings and his magazine &quot;DYN&quot;. Paalen considered ideas of quantum mechanics, as well as idiosyncratic interpretations of the totemic vision and the spatial structure of native-Indian painting from British Columbia and prepared the ground for the new spatial vision of the young American abstracts. His long essay &quot;Totem Art&quot; (1943) had considerable influence on such artists as Martha Graham, Isamu Noguchi, Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Around 1944 Barnett Newman tried to explain America&#x27;s newest art movement and included a list of &quot;the men in the new movement&quot;. Paalen is mentioned twice; other artists mentioned are Gottlieb, Rothko, Pollock, Hofmann, Baziotes, Gorky and others. Robert Motherwell is mentioned with a question mark. Another important early manifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist Mark Tobey, especially his &quot;white writing&quot; canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the &quot;all-over&quot; look of Pollock&#x27;s drip paintings.

The movement&#x27;s name is derived from the combination of the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as Futurism, the Bauhaus, and Synthetic Cubism. Additionally, it has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even to work that is neither especially abstract nor expressionist. California abstract expressionist Jay Meuser, who typically painted in the non-objective style, wrote about his painting &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;, &quot;It is far better to capture the glorious spirit of the sea than to paint all of its tiny ripples.&quot; Pollock&#x27;s energetic &quot;action paintings&quot;, with their &quot;busy&quot; feel, are different, both technically and aesthetically, from the violent and grotesque &quot;Women&quot; series of Willem de Kooning&#x27;s figurative paintings and the rectangles of color in Rothko&#x27;s Color Field paintings (which are not what would usually be called expressionist, and which Rothko denied were abstract). Yet all four artists are classified as abstract expressionists.

Abstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as Wassily Kandinsky. Although it is true that spontaneity or the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists&#x27; works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. With artists such as Paul Klee, Kandinsky, Emma Kunz, and later on Rothko, Newman, and Agnes Martin, abstract art clearly implied expression of ideas concerning the spiritual, the unconscious, and the mind.

Why this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American social realism had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the Great Depression, but also by the Mexican muralists such as David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of these painters. Abstract expressionism arose during the war and began to be showcased during the early forties at galleries in New York such as The Art of This Century Gallery. The post-war McCarthy era was a time of artistic censorship in the United States, but if the subject matter were totally abstract then it would be seen as apolitical, and therefore safe. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders.

While the movement is closely associated with painting, collagist Anne Ryan and certain sculptors in particular were also integral to abstract expressionism. David Smith, and his wife Dorothy Dehner, Herbert Ferber, Isamu Noguchi, Ibram Lassaw, Theodore Roszak, Phillip Pavia, Mary Callery, Richard Stankiewicz, Louise Bourgeois, and Louise Nevelson in particular were some of the sculptors considered as being important members of the movement. In addition, the artists David Hare, John Chamberlain, James Rosati, Mark di Suvero, and sculptors Richard Lippold, Raoul Hague, George Rickey, Reuben Nakian, and even Tony Smith, Seymour Lipton, Joseph Cornell, and several others were integral parts of the abstract expressionist movement. Many of the sculptors listed participated in the Ninth Street Show, a famous exhibition curated by Leo Castelli on East Ninth Street in New York City in 1951. Besides the painters and sculptors of the period the New York School of abstract expressionism also generated a number of supportive poets, including Frank O&#x27;Hara and photographers such as Aaron Siskind and Fred McDarrah, (whose book &quot;The Artist&#x27;s World in Pictures&quot; documented the New York School during the 1950s), and filmmakers—notably Robert Frank—as well.

Although the abstract expressionist school spread quickly throughout the United States, the epicenters of this style were New York City and the San Francisco Bay area of California.

== Art critics of the post–World War II era ==

In the 1940s there were not only few galleries (The Art of This Century, Pierre Matisse Gallery, Julien Levy Gallery and a few others) but also few critics who were willing to follow the work of the New York Vanguard.
There were also a few artists with a literary background, among them Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, who functioned as critics as well.

While the New York avant-garde was still relatively unknown by the late 1940s, most of the artists who have become household names today had their well-established patron critics: Clement Greenberg advocated Jackson Pollock and the color field painters like Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and Hans Hofmann; Harold Rosenberg seemed to prefer the action painters such as Willem de Kooning and Franz Kline, as well as the seminal paintings of Arshile Gorky; Thomas B. Hess, the managing editor of &quot;ARTnews&quot;, championed Willem de Kooning.

The new critics elevated their protégés by casting other artists as &quot;followers&quot; or ignoring those who did not serve their promotional goal.

In 1958, Mark Tobey became the first American painter since Whistler (1895) to win top prize at the Venice Biennale.

Barnett Newman, a late member of the Uptown Group, wrote catalogue forewords and reviews, and by the late 1940s became an exhibiting artist at Betty Parsons Gallery. His first solo show was in 1948. Soon after his first exhibition, Barnett Newman remarked in one of the Artists&#x27; Sessions at Studio 35: &quot;We are in the process of making the world, to a certain extent, in our own image.&quot; Utilizing his writing skills, Newman fought every step of the way to reinforce his newly established image as an artist and to promote his work. An example is his letter on April 9, 1955, &quot;Letter to Sidney Janis: — it is true that Rothko talks the fighter. He fights, however, to submit to the philistine world. My struggle against bourgeois society has involved the total rejection of it.&quot;

Strangely, the person thought to have had most to do with the promotion of this style was a New York Trotskyist: Clement Greenberg. As long-time art critic for the &quot;Partisan Review&quot; and &quot;The Nation&quot;, he became an early and literate proponent of abstract expressionism. The well-heeled artist Robert Motherwell joined Greenberg in promoting a style that fit the political climate and the intellectual rebelliousness of the era.

Greenberg proclaimed abstract expressionism and Pollock in particular as the epitome of aesthetic value. He supported Pollock&#x27;s work on formalistic grounds as simply the best painting of its day and the culmination of an art tradition going back via Cubism and Cézanne to Monet, in which painting became ever-&#x27;purer&#x27; and more concentrated in what was &#x27;essential&#x27; to it, the making of marks on a flat surface.

Pollock&#x27;s work has always polarised critics. Rosenberg spoke of the transformation of painting into an existential drama in Pollock&#x27;s work, in which &quot;what was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event&quot;. &quot;The big moment came when it was decided to paint &#x27;just to paint&#x27;. The gesture on the canvas was a gesture of liberation from value—political, aesthetic, moral.&quot;

One of the most vocal critics of abstract expressionism at the time was &quot;The New York Times&quot; art critic John Canaday. Meyer Schapiro and Leo Steinberg along with Greenberg and Rosenberg were important art historians of the post-war era who voiced support for abstract expressionism. During the early-to-mid-sixties younger art critics Michael Fried, Rosalind Krauss, and Robert Hughes added considerable insights into the critical dialectic that continues to grow around abstract expressionism.

== History ==

=== World War II and the Post-War period ===

During the period leading up to and during World War II, modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn&#x27;t flee perished. Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from Varian Fry) were Hans Namuth, Yves Tanguy, Kay Sage, Max Ernst, Jimmy Ernst, Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Castelli, Marcel Duchamp, André Masson, Roberto Matta, André Breton, Marc Chagall, Jacques Lipchitz, Fernand Léger, and Piet Mondrian. A few artists, notably Picasso, Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard remained in France and survived.

The post-war period left the capitals of Europe in upheaval, with an urgency to economically and physically rebuild and to politically regroup. In Paris, formerly the center of European culture and capital of the art world, the climate for art was a disaster, and New York replaced Paris as the new center of the art world. Post-war Europe saw the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada, and the works of Matisse. Also in Europe, Art brut, and Lyrical Abstraction or Tachisme (the European equivalent to abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. Serge Poliakoff, Nicolas de Staël, Georges Mathieu, Vieira da Silva, Jean Dubuffet, Yves Klein, Pierre Soulages and Jean Messagier, among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting. In the United States, a new generation of American artists began to emerge and to dominate the world stage, and they were called &quot;abstract expressionists&quot;.

==== Gorky, Hofmann, and Graham ====

The 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American abstract expressionism, a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from Matisse, Picasso, Surrealism, Miró, Cubism, Fauvism, and early Modernism via eminent educators in the United States, including Hans Hofmann from Germany and John D. Graham from Ukraine. Graham&#x27;s influence on American art during the early 1940s was particularly visible in the work of Gorky, de Kooning, Pollock, and Richard Pousette-Dart among others. Gorky&#x27;s contributions to American and world art are difficult to overestimate. His work as lyrical abstraction was a &quot;new language. He &quot;lit the way for two generations of American artists&quot;. The painterly spontaneity of mature works such as &quot;The Liver is the Cock&#x27;s Comb&quot;, &quot;The Betrothal II&quot;, and &quot;One Year the Milkweed&quot; immediately prefigured Abstract expressionism, and leaders in the New York School have acknowledged Gorky&#x27;s considerable influence. The early work of Hyman Bloom was also influential. American artists also benefited from the presence of Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Max Ernst, and the André Breton group, Pierre Matisse&#x27;s gallery, and Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s gallery The Art of This Century, as well as other factors. Hans Hofmann in particular as teacher, mentor, and artist was both important and influential to the development and success of abstract expressionism in the United States. Among Hofmann&#x27;s protégés was Clement Greenberg, who became an enormously influential voice for American painting, and among his students was Lee Krasner, who introduced her teacher, Hofmann, to her husband, Jackson Pollock.

==== Pollock and Abstract influences ====

During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock&#x27;s radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all Contemporary art that followed him. To some extent, Pollock realized that the journey toward making a work of art was as important as the work of art itself. Like Picasso&#x27;s innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near the turn of the century via Cubism and constructed sculpture, with influences as disparate as Navajo sand paintings, surrealism, Jungian analysis, and Mexican mural art, Pollock redefined what it was to produce art. His move away from easel painting and conventionality was a liberating signal to the artists of his era and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock&#x27;s process—the placing of unstretched raw canvas on the floor where it could be attacked from all four sides using artist materials and industrial materials; linear skeins of paint dripped and thrown; drawing, staining, brushing; imagery and non-imagery—essentially took art-making beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art.

The other abstract expressionists followed Pollock&#x27;s breakthrough with new breakthroughs of their own. In a sense the innovations of Pollock, de Kooning, Franz Kline, Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Richard Pousette-Dart, Robert Motherwell, Peter Voulkos, and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them. The radical Anti-Formalist movements of the 1960s and 1970s including Fluxus, Neo-Dada, Conceptual art, and the feminist art movement can be traced to the innovations of abstract expressionism. Rereadings into abstract art, done by art historians such as Linda Nochlin, Griselda Pollock and Catherine de Zegher critically shows, however, that pioneer women artists who have produced major innovations in modern art had been ignored by the official accounts of its history, but finally began to achieve long overdue recognition in the wake of the abstract expressionist movement of the 1940s and 1950s. Abstract expressionism emerged as a major art movement in New York City during the 1950s and thereafter several leading art galleries began to include the abstract expressionists in exhibitions and as regulars in their rosters. Some of those prominent &#x27;uptown&#x27; galleries included: the Charles Egan Gallery, the Sidney Janis Gallery, the Betty Parsons Gallery, the Kootz Gallery, the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, the Stable Gallery, the Leo Castelli Gallery as well as others; and several downtown galleries known at the time as the Tenth Street galleries exhibited many emerging younger artists working in the abstract expressionist vein.

==== Action painting ====

Action painting was a style widespread from the 1940s until the early 1960s, and is closely associated with abstract expressionism (some critics have used the terms action painting and abstract expressionism interchangeably). A comparison is often drawn between the American action painting and the French tachisme.

The term was coined by the American critic Harold Rosenberg in 1952 and signaled a major shift in the aesthetic perspective of New York School painters and critics. According to Rosenberg the canvas was &quot;an arena in which to act&quot;. While abstract expressionists such as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline and Willem de Kooning had long been outspoken in their view of a painting as an arena within which to come to terms with the act of creation, earlier critics sympathetic to their cause, like Clement Greenberg, focused on their works&#x27; &quot;objectness&quot;. To Greenberg, it was the physicality of the paintings&#x27; clotted and oil-caked surfaces that was the key to understanding them as documents of the artists&#x27; existential struggle.
Rosenberg&#x27;s critique shifted the emphasis from the object to the struggle itself, with the finished painting being only the physical manifestation, a kind of residue, of the actual work of art, which was in the act or process of the painting&#x27;s creation. This spontaneous activity was the &quot;action&quot; of the painter, through arm and wrist movement, painterly gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed, stained, scumbled and dripped. The painter would sometimes let the paint drip onto the canvas, while rhythmically dancing, or even standing in the canvas, sometimes letting the paint fall according to the subconscious mind, thus letting the unconscious part of the psyche assert and express itself. All this, however, is difficult to explain or interpret because it is a supposed unconscious manifestation of the act of pure creation.

In practice, the term abstract expressionism is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock&#x27;s energetic action paintings, with their &quot;busy&quot; feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to De Kooning&#x27;s violent and grotesque &quot;Women&quot; series. &quot;Woman V&quot; is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, &quot;Woman I&quot;, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian Meyer Schapiro saw the painting in de Kooning&#x27;s studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning&#x27;s response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; &quot;Woman II&quot;, &quot;Woman III&quot; and &quot;Woman IV&quot;. During the summer of 1952, spent at East Hampton, de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on &quot;Woman I&quot; by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time. The &quot;Woman series&quot; are decidedly figurative paintings.

Another important artist is Franz Kline. As with Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists, Kline was labelled an &quot;action painter&quot; because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brushstrokes and use of canvas; as demonstrated by his painting &quot;Number 2&quot; (1954).

Automatic writing was an important vehicle for action painters such as Kline (in his black and white paintings), Pollock, Mark Tobey and Cy Twombly, who used gesture, surface, and line to create calligraphic, linear symbols and skeins that resemble language, and resonate as powerful manifestations from the Collective unconscious. Robert Motherwell in his &quot;Elegy to the Spanish Republic&quot; series painted powerful black and white paintings using gesture, surface and symbol evoking powerful emotional charges.

Meanwhile, other action painters, notably de Kooning, Gorky, Norman Bluhm, Joan Mitchell, and James Brooks, used imagery via either abstract landscape or as expressionistic visions of the figure to articulate their highly personal and powerful evocations. James Brooks&#x27; paintings were particularly poetic and highly prescient in relationship to Lyrical Abstraction that became prominent in the late 1960s and the 1970s.

==== Color field ====
Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in Mark Rothko&#x27;s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what Clement Greenberg termed the Color field direction of abstract expressionism. Both Hans Hofmann and Robert Motherwell can be comfortably described as practitioners of Action painting and Color field painting. In the 1940s Richard Pousette-Dart&#x27;s tightly constructed imagery often depended upon themes of mythology and mysticism; as did the paintings of Gottlieb, and Pollock in that decade as well.

Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of abstract expressionism, especially the work of Rothko, Still, Newman, Motherwell, Gottlieb, Ad Reinhardt and several series of paintings by Joan Miró. Greenberg perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The Color Field painters sought to rid their art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like Motherwell, Still, Rothko, Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Mark Tobey, and especially Ad Reinhardt and Barnett Newman, whose masterpiece &quot;Vir heroicus sublimis&quot; is in the collection of MoMA, used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general, these artists eliminated recognizable imagery, in the case of Rothko and Gottlieb sometimes using symbols and signs as a replacement of imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of modern art, artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.

In distinction to the emotional energy and gestural surface marks of abstract expressionists such as Pollock and de Kooning, the Color Field painters initially appeared to be cool and austere, effacing the individual mark in favor of large, flat areas of color, which these artists considered to be the essential nature of visual abstraction, along with the actual shape of the canvas, which later in the 1960s Frank Stella in particular achieved in unusual ways with combinations of curved and straight edges. However, Color Field painting has proven to be both sensual and deeply expressive albeit in a different way from gestural abstract expressionism.

Although abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the New York School, and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an &quot;all-over&quot; approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the &quot;arena&quot; became a credo of Action painting, while the &quot;integrity of the picture plane&quot; became a credo of the Color field painters. Younger artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s as well including Alfred Leslie, Sam Francis, Joan Mitchell, Helen Frankenthaler, Cy Twombly, Milton Resnick, Michael Goldberg, Norman Bluhm, Grace Hartigan, Friedel Dzubas, and Robert Goodnough among others.
Although Pollock is closely associated with Action Painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly &quot;touch&quot; and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. Another critical view advanced by Greenberg connects Pollock&#x27;s allover canvasses to the large-scale &quot;Water Lilies&quot; of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Art critics such as Michael Fried, Greenberg and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock&#x27;s most famous works – his &quot;drip&quot; paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements. They note that these works often read as vast complexes of similarly-valued paint skeins and all-over fields of color and drawing, and are related to the mural-sized Monets which are similarly constructed of close-valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as fields of color and drawing. Pollock&#x27;s use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still&#x27;s case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic &quot;drip&quot; painting period of 1947–1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed &quot;Number 12, 1952&quot;, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection.

While Arshile Gorky is considered to be one of the founding fathers of abstract expressionism and a surrealist, he was also one of the first painters of the New York School who used the technique of &quot;staining.&quot; Gorky created broad fields of vivid, open, unbroken color that he used in many of his paintings as &quot;grounds.&quot; In Gorky&#x27;s most effective and accomplished paintings between the years 1941–1948, he consistently used intense stained fields of color, often letting the paint run and drip, under and around his familiar lexicon of organic and biomorphic shapes and delicate lines. Another abstract expressionist whose works in the 1940s call to mind the stain paintings of the 1960s and the 1970s is James Brooks. Brooks regularly used stain as a technique in his paintings from the late 1940s. Brooks began diluting his oil paint in order to have fluid colors with which to pour and drip and stain into the mostly raw canvas that he used. These works often combined calligraphy and abstract shapes. During the final three decades of his career, Sam Francis&#x27; style of large-scale bright abstract expressionism was closely associated with Color field painting. His paintings straddled both camps within the abstract expressionist rubric, Action painting and Color Field painting.

Having seen Pollock&#x27;s 1951 paintings of thinned black oil paint stained into raw canvas, Frankenthaler began to produce &quot;stain paintings&quot; in varied oil colors on raw canvas in 1952. Her most famous painting from that period is &quot;Mountains and Sea&quot;. She is one of the originators of the Color Field movement that emerged in the late 1950s. Frankenthaler also studied with Hans Hofmann.

Hofmann&#x27;s paintings are a symphony of color as seen in &quot;The Gate,&quot; 1959–1960. He was renowned not only as an artist but also as a teacher of art, both in his native Germany and later in the US. Hofmann, who came to the United States from Germany in the early 1930s, brought with him the legacy of Modernism. As a young artist in pre-First World War Paris, Hofmann worked with Robert Delaunay, and he knew firsthand the innovative work of both Picasso and Matisse. Matisse&#x27;s work had an enormous influence on him, and on his understanding of the expressive language of color and the potentiality of abstraction. Hofmann was one of the first theorists of color field painting, and his theories were influential to artists and to critics, particularly to Clement Greenberg, as well as to others during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1953 Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland were both profoundly influenced by Helen Frankenthaler&#x27;s stain paintings after visiting her studio in New York City. Returning to Washington, DC., they began to produce the major works that created the &quot;color field movement&quot; in the late 1950s.

In 1972 then Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler said:
==== In the 1960s after abstract expressionism ====

In abstract painting during the 1950s and 1960s, several new directions, like the Hard-edge painting exemplified by John McLaughlin, emerged. Meanwhile, as a reaction against the subjectivism of abstract expressionism, other forms of Geometric abstraction began to appear in artist studios and in radical avant-garde circles. Greenberg became the voice of &quot;Post-painterly abstraction;&quot; by curating an influential exhibition of new painting that toured important art museums throughout the United States in 1964. Color field painting, Hard-edge painting and Lyrical Abstraction emerged as radical new directions.

== Abstract expressionism and the Cold War ==

Since the mid-1970s it has been argued that the style attracted the attention, in the early 1950s, of the CIA, who saw it as representative of the US as a haven of free thought and free markets, as well as a challenge to both the socialist realist styles prevalent in communist nations and the dominance of the European art markets. The book by Frances Stonor Saunders, &quot;The Cultural Cold War—The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters&quot;, (published in the UK as &quot;Who Paid the Piper?: CIA and the Cultural Cold War&quot;) details how the CIA financed and organized the promotion of American abstract expressionists as part of cultural imperialism via the Congress for Cultural Freedom from 1950 to 1967. Notably Robert Motherwell&#x27;s series &quot;Elegy to the Spanish Republic&quot; addressed some of those political issues. Tom Braden, founding chief of the CIA&#x27;s International Organizations Division (IOD) and ex-executive secretary of the Museum of Modern Art said in an interview, &quot;I think it was the most important division that the agency had, and I think that it played an enormous role in the Cold War.&quot;

Against this revisionist tradition, an essay by Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called &quot;Revisiting the Revisionists: The Modern, Its Critics and the Cold War&quot;, asserts that much of that information concerning what was happening on the American art scene during the 1940s and 50s, as well as the revisionists&#x27; interpretation of it, is false or decontextualized. Other books on the subject include &quot;Art in the Cold War&quot;, by Christine Lindey, which also describes the art of the Soviet Union at the same time, and &quot;Pollock and After&quot;, edited by Francis Frascina, which reprinted the Kimmelman article.

== Consequences ==
Canadian painter Jean-Paul Riopelle (1923–2002), a member of the Montreal-based surrealist-inspired group Les Automatistes, helped introduce a related style of abstract impressionism to the Parisian art world from 1949. Michel Tapié&#x27;s groundbreaking book, &quot;Un Art Autre&quot; (1952), was also enormously influential in this regard. Tapié was also a curator and exhibition organizer who promoted the works of Pollock and Hans Hofmann in Europe. By the 1960s, the movement&#x27;s initial effect had been assimilated, yet its methods and proponents remained highly influential in art, affecting profoundly the work of many artists who followed. Abstract expressionism preceded Tachisme, Color Field painting, Lyrical Abstraction, Fluxus, Pop Art, Minimalism, Postminimalism, Neo-expressionism, and the other movements of the sixties and seventies and it influenced all those later movements that evolved. Movements which were direct responses to, and rebellions against abstract expressionism began with Hard-edge painting (Frank Stella, Robert Indiana and others) and Pop artists, notably Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Roy Lichtenstein who achieved prominence in the US, accompanied by Richard Hamilton in Britain. Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns in the US formed a bridge between abstract expressionism and Pop art. Minimalism was exemplified by artists such as Donald Judd, Robert Mangold and Agnes Martin.

However, many painters, such as Jules Olitski, Joan Mitchell and Antoni Tàpies continued to work in the abstract expressionist style for many years, extending and expanding its visual and philosophical implications, as many abstract artists continue to do today, in styles described as lyrical abstraction, neo-expressionist and others.

In the years after World War II, a group of New York artists started one of the first true schools of artists in America, bringing about a new era in American artwork: abstract expressionism. This led to the American art boom that brought about styles such as Pop Art. This also helped to make New York into a cultural and artistic hub.

<text>My War is the second studio album by American band Black Flag. It was the first of three full-length albums the band released in 1984. The album polarized fans due to the LP&#x27;s B-side, on which the band slowed down to a heavy, Black Sabbath-esque trudge after establishing expectations as a faster hardcore punk band on its first album, &quot;Damaged&quot; (1981).

After a period of legal troubles which prohibited the band from using its own name on recordings, Black Flag returned to the studio with a new approach to its music that incorporated a greater variety of styles, resulting in a sound orthodox punks found difficult to accept. The line-up had shrunk from five members to three: vocalist Henry Rollins, drummer Bill Stevenson, and co-founding guitarist Greg Ginn. Ginn doubled on bass guitar under the name &quot;Dale Nixon&quot; for the recording as bassist Chuck Dukowski left the band shortly before recording; the album includes two tracks Dukowski wrote.

The A-side of the LP is composed of six generally high-paced, thrashy hardcore tracks, featuring guitar solos unusual in punk music. On the B-side are three heavy tracks that each breach six-minutes with ponderously slow tempos and dark, unrelenting lyrics of self-hatred. The band members had grown their hair long when they toured the album in 1984, which along with the change in sound further alienated their hardcore skinhead fanbase. Despite mixed reception at the time of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;My War&quot; has come to gain a reputation as one of Black Flag&#x27;s seminal releases and had a major influence on the development of post-hardcore, sludge metal, grunge, and math rock.

==Background==
In 1978, Black Flag guitarist and cofounder Greg Ginn converted his ham radio business Solid State Transmitters to SST Records to release the band&#x27;s first EP &quot;Nervous Breakdown&quot;. Soon SST was releasing recordings by other bands as well, beginning with Minutemen&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid Time&quot; in 1980.

Black Flag recorded its first album &quot;Damaged&quot; in 1981 at Unicorn Studios and arranged a deal with the studio&#x27;s record label Unicorn Records, which had distribution with MCA Records. MCA label president Al Bergamo halted the release after hearing the record, calling it &quot;anti-parent&quot;—though SST co-owner Joe Carducci asserts this was a pretense for MCA to sever relations with the financially troubled Unicorn. The band obtained and distributed the already-pressed copies of &quot;Damaged&quot; and adorned it with a label displaying Bergamo&#x27;s &quot;anti-parent&quot; quote. Legal troubles erupted when SST claimed unpaid royalties from Unicorn and Unicorn successfully counter-sued, resulting in five days in jail for Ginn and co-founding bassist Chuck Dukowski and an injunction prohibiting the band from releasing material under its own name. The double album &quot;Everything Went Black&quot;—a compilation of earlier, unreleased material—appeared from SST in 1982 without the band&#x27;s name on it. Unicorn&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1983 freed the band from the injunction.

Ginn had grown frustrated with the hardcore punk scene, and told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in early 1983: &quot;[W]e&#x27;ve never been out to create this punk scene&quot; they had been credited with spearheading; &quot;We want people to listen to us as a band rather than as a stereotype ... A lot of what you call the punk scene is really backward, and it always has been.&quot; Following the release of &quot;Damaged&quot;, Black Flag absorbed a wider range of influences from the more experimental hardcore of Flipper, Void, and Fang. They listened to little contemporary punk. Ginn was drawn to Ronnie James Dio&#x27;s work in Black Sabbath and Dio, as well as earlier favorites from his pre-punk days, including Ted Nugent, Black Oak Arkansas, MC5, ZZ Top, Deep Purple, Uriah Heep, and others. Music journalist Andrew Earles believes the band was influenced by the tiny but growing doom metal scene led by Saint Vitus (who released via SST). Ginn jealously guarded the new material, fearing other bands would capitalize on the new approach, and bemoaned that fans were unaware of how the band had progressed since they were unable to release recordings.

The band toured extensively in North America and Europe to often hostile, violent hardcore punk crowds. The disciplined group rehearsed obsessively, but there was little friendship between members: vocalist Henry Rollins was introverted and Ginn cold and demanding. Dukowski felt that Rollins&#x27; vocal approach was better suited than that of the band&#x27;s earlier three singers to the new material he was writing such as &quot;I Love You&quot; and &quot;My War&quot;. Dukowski, who also wrote poetry and fiction, encouraged Rollins to write as well, and Rollins found inspiration in Dukowski&#x27;s bleak lyrical style.

The band recorded a set of ten demo tracks at Total Access studios in 1982 for a planned follow-up to &quot;Damaged&quot; on which Chuck Biscuits replaced &quot;Damaged&quot; drummer Robo. The rest of the lineup consisted of Ginn and former vocalist Dez Cadena on guitars, Rollins on vocals, and Dukowski on bass. The band explored new sounds on these tracks, which tended to feature a riff-heavy heavy-metal edge and noisy, energetic free guitar soloing from Ginn. The album never materialized, and the heavily bootlegged demos have never been officially released; re-recordings of several of the tracks from the session were to feature on &quot;My War&quot; and other later albums. The line-up did not last long—frustrated with the band&#x27;s legal troubles, Biscuits left in December 1982, replaced by Bill Stevenson, and in 1983 Cadena left to form DC3. Ginn had been frustrated with Dukowski&#x27;s sense of rhythm, and in Germany during a European tour in 1983 gave Dukowski an ultimatum to quit, or Ginn himself would leave. Dukowski left the band, but stayed on to co-run SST.

With Unicorn&#x27;s demise in 1983, Black Flag was able to release the material they had written since 1981. Eager to get back in the studio but still without a bassist, Ginn took on bass duties under the pseudonym &quot;Dale Nixon&quot; and practiced the new material with Stevenson up to eight hours a day, teaching the drummer to slow down and let the rhythm &quot;ooze out&quot; at a pace Stevenson was unused to; the band called this approach the &quot;socialist groove&quot;, as all beats were equally spaced. With Spot as producer and $200,000 in debt, Ginn, Rollins, and Stevenson headed to the studio to record &quot;My War&quot;.

==Music==
The sides on the original LP divide the tracks into stylistic halves. The first half features five tracks that are in the same style that the band originated on their previous album &quot;Damaged&quot; and closes with a noisy freak-out, &quot;The Swinging Man&quot;. Dukowski penned the opening title track. Ginn&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Decide&quot; follows, a gloomy ode to frustration: &quot;I conceal my feelings / So I don&#x27;t have to explain / What I can&#x27;t explain anyway&quot;. &quot;Beat My Head Against the Wall&quot; rails at conformity and the band&#x27;s experience with a major label: &quot;Swimming in the mainstream / Is such a lame, lame dream&quot;. Dukowski&#x27;s &quot;I Love You&quot; parodies pop ballads with lyrics of violence and dysfunction in a relationship gone wrong. Ginn and Rollins share credit on the metallic &quot;Forever Time&quot; and the noisy &quot;Swinging Man&quot;.

The second side&#x27;s three tracks each clock in at over six minutes. Reviewers have described them as an early cross-pollination between punk and metal, a plodding Black Sabbath-esque sludge metal, or proto-noise rock style, depending on how they are viewed. On &quot;Three Nights&quot;, Rollins compares himself to feces stuck to his shoe: &quot;And I&#x27;ve been grinding that stink into the dirt / For a long time now&quot;. Against a slow, heavy, start-and-stop bass riff and a constant drum thudding, Rollins closes &quot;Scream&quot; with a bellow after delivering the Ginn-penned lines: &quot;I may be a big baby / But I&#x27;ll scream in your ear / &#x27;Til I find out / Just what it is I am doing here&quot;. The closing track of &quot;Damaged&quot;, &quot;Damaged I&quot;, presaged this dark, heavier style, and a slower pace that brings the track length to nearly four minutes, the longest on the album.

==Reception and legacy==


&quot;My War&quot; was the first of four Black Flag releases in 1984, a year that also saw &quot;Family Man&quot;, &quot;Slip It In&quot;, and &quot;Live &#x27;84&quot; appear from SST. It is considered to be one of the first post-hardcore albums along with Hüsker Dü&#x27;s &quot;Zen Arcade&quot; and Minutemen&#x27;s &quot;Double Nickels on the Dime&quot; in the same year.

The album reached no. 5 on the UK Indie Charts. Black Flag toured the &quot;My War&quot; material from March 1984, with the Nig-Heist and Meat Puppets as opening acts. It had been a year since the band had toured, and Rollins, Ginn, and Stevenson had grown out their hair; punks associated long hair with the hippies and metalheads they loathed and found it dissonant with Rollins&#x27; accepted image as a hardcore skinhead.

&quot;My War&quot; polarized Black Flag fans; it alienated those who wanted the band to stay true to its simple hardcore roots and who were put off by the length of the songs, the riff-heaviness, and the solos—elements widely thought of as un-punk. 

Critics dissatisfied with the band&#x27;s direction compared it to heavy metal, though contemporary metal bands with such a sound were rare, and the band rejected the classification. The ideology of many fans and critics demanded that hardcore punk bands remain true to the genre&#x27;s roots, with short, fast songs, typically lacking solos. &quot;My War&quot; thus came across as a betrayal of those roots, and critics associated the differences with metal, a genre the hardcore punk community despised. Examples include Tim Yohannon disparaging the album in &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; as &quot;like Black Flag doing an imitation of Iron Maiden imitating Black Flag on a bad day&quot;, and Howard Hampton at the Boston &quot;Phoenix&quot; deriding it for &quot;resorting to standard machinations&quot;. Rollins countered critics, stating, &quot;Take the &#x27;metal&#x27; out of &#x27;heavy metal&#x27; and that&#x27;s what we are—it&#x27;s just heavy ... Heavy metal is a defined form. Black Flag is not a defined form.&quot; Ginn had long criticized the hardcore punk scene&#x27;s narrowmindedness, and following Black Flag&#x27;s breakup in 1986, and in reaction to criticism of Black Flag&#x27;s later output following its breakup in 1986, Ginn derided the underground scene as &quot;really conservative&quot;, whose audience &quot;demands something familiar&quot;.

The muffled sound of the album&#x27;s production has attracted criticism; Stevie Chick disparaged the lack of character in Ginn&#x27;s bass-playing on &quot;My War&quot; when compared to the 1982 demo of the same song with Dukowski on bass. Michael Azerrad praised the strength of the material while denigrating the &quot;frustrating lack of ensemble feel&quot; as the album was recorded without a full lineup. Critic Clay Jarvis commended the album, emphasizing the risks taken on it and its influence, calling it &quot;more a test than an album&quot;, and saying, &quot;independent music is stronger because Black Flag formulated it&quot;. John Dougan at AllMusic called the A-side of the album &quot;quite good&quot;, but described the B-side as &quot;self-indulgence masquerading as inspiration and about as much fun as wading through a tar pit&quot;. Robert Christgau considered the B-side a &quot;waste&quot;. Howard Hampton found it &quot;unbearably boring&quot;, and Tim Yohannon called the B-side &quot;sheer torture&quot;.

The album had a great influence on the &quot;hardcore-meets-Sabbath&quot; sounds of Mudhoney, Melvins, and Nirvana. The first punk concert Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain attended was a Black Flag show during the &quot;My War&quot; tour, and he listed &quot;My War&quot; on his list of top fifty albums. Mark Arm of Mudhoney related he was moved to tears at a Black Flag concert in 1983 when he was first exposed to &quot;Nothing Left Inside&quot;, and the experience inspired him to seek out bands like Black Sabbath. Mudhoney guitarist Steve Turner has said of the album&#x27;s impact on grunge, &quot;I swear, that record instantly made the Melvins slow down to a crawl. Because The Melvins when they started, they were a fairly tight hardcore band and &quot;My War&quot; came out and they suddenly slowed down. And I know it was a huge influence on us as well. Even in the Green River days.&quot;

<doc id="147849" wikidata="Q742767" url="?curid=147849" title="Dublin Castle">
<text>Dublin Castle () is a major Irish government complex, conference centre, and tourist attraction. It is located off Dame Street in central Dublin.

It is a former motte-and-bailey castle and was chosen for its position at the highest point of central Dublin. Until 1922 it was the seat of the British government&#x27;s administration in Ireland. Many of the current buildings date from the 18th century, though a castle has stood on the site since the days of King John, the first Lord of Ireland. The Castle served as the seat of English, then later British, government of Ireland under the Lordship of Ireland (1171–1541), the Kingdom of Ireland (1541–1800), and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801–1922).

After the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921, the complex was ceremonially handed over to the newly formed Provisional Government led by Michael Collins. It now hosts the inauguration of each President of Ireland and various State receptions.

The castle was built by the dark pool (&quot;Dubh Linn&quot;) which gave Dublin its name. This pool lies on the lower course of the River Poddle before its confluence with the River Liffey; when the castle was built, the Liffey was much wider, and the castle was effectively defended by both rivers. The Poddle today runs under the complex.

==Roles==

Dublin Castle has fulfilled a number of roles throughout its history. Originally built as a defensive fortification for the Norman city of Dublin, it later evolved into an official residence, used by the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland or Viceroy of Ireland, the representative of the monarch. The second-in-command in the Dublin Castle administration, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, also had his offices there. Over the years parliament and certain law courts met at the castle before moving to new purpose-built venues. It also served as the base for a military garrison and later also intelligence services.

Upon the formation of the Irish Free State in December 1922, the castle temporarily assumed the role of the Four Courts, the legal complex badly damaged during the Civil War; this arrangement would last for a decade.

It was decided in 1938 that the inauguration of the first President of Ireland, Douglas Hyde, would take place in the castle, and the complex has been host to this ceremony ever since. The castle is also used for hosting official state visits as well as more informal foreign affairs engagements, state banquets, including that for the historic visit of Queen Elizabeth II in 2011, and Government policy launches. It also acts as the central base for Ireland&#x27;s hosting of the European Presidency, approximately every 10 years. Two dedicated conference facilities, The Hibernia Conference Centre and The Printworks were installed for the European Presidencies of 1990 and 2013, and are made available for rental by the private sector too.

The castle&#x27;s State Apartments and their associated collection of historic materials form an accredited museum, and the castle complex is also home to a Garda Síochána unit and the Garda Museum, some parts of the Office of Public Works, some functions of the Irish Revenue Commissioners – and the Revenue Museum – and the Chester Beatty Library.

==History==


Dublin Castle was first founded as a major defensive work by Meiler Fitzhenry on the orders of King John of England in 1204, sometime after the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, when it was commanded that a castle be built with strong walls and good ditches for the defence of the city, the administration of justice, and the protection of the King&#x27;s treasure. Largely complete by 1230, the castle was of typical Norman courtyard design, with a central square without a keep, bounded on all sides by tall defensive walls and protected at each corner by a circular tower. Sited to the southeast of Norman Dublin, the castle formed one corner of the outer perimeter of the city, using the River Poddle as a natural means of defence along two of its sides. The city wall directly abutted the castle&#x27;s northeast Powder Tower, extending north and westwards around the city before rejoining the castle at its southwestern Bermingham Tower. 

In January 1592, Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell and brothers Art and Henry O&#x27;Neill escaped from the castle after a period of imprisonement. Once free of the castle, Henry O&#x27;Neill went his own direction and returned safely to Ulster, whereas O&#x27;Donnell and Art, alongside a guide sent to help them, continued south to the rural valley of Glenmalure, a rebel stronghold where they knew they would find safety. The escape and subsequent journey to Glenmalure at night in winter, during which Art died of exposure, has been commemorated officially every January since 2009 by the annual Art O&#x27;Neill Challenge endurance race/walk.

In 1620 the English-born judge Luke Gernon was greatly impressed by the wall: &quot;a huge and mighty wall, foursquare, and of incredible thickness&quot;. In the 17th century, the Earl of Arran described the Castle as &quot;the worst castle in the worst situation in Christendom&quot;.

The Poddle was diverted into the city through archways where the walls adjoined the castle, artificially flooding the moat of the fortress&#x27;s city elevations. One of these archways and part of the wall survive buried underneath the 18th-century buildings, and are open for public viewing.

Through the Middle Ages the wooden buildings within the castle square evolved and changed, the most significant addition being the Great Hall built of stone and timber, variously used as Parliament house, court of law and banqueting hall. The building survived until 1673, when it was damaged by fire and demolished shortly afterwards. The Court of Castle Chamber, the Irish counterpart to the English Star Chamber, sat in Dublin Castle in a room which was specially built for it about 1570. The Castle sustained severe fire damage in 1684. Extensive rebuilding transformed it from a medieval fortress to a Georgian palace. No trace of medieval buildings remains above ground level today, with the exception of the great Record Tower (–1230); it is the sole surviving tower of the original fortification, its battlements an early 19th-century addition.

In 1764, English traveller John Bush wrote: &quot;The Castle, as it is called from its having been the situation of one, I suppose, of which at present there are very few remains, is the residence of the lord lieutenant when in Ireland, but has very little of grandeur in its external appearance besides the large square court-yard, which it encloses. But the rooms, some of them, are large and elegant&quot;.

United Irishmen General Joseph Holt, a participant in the 1798 Rising, was incarcerated in the Bermingham Tower before being transported to New South Wales in 1799.

In 1884 officers at the Castle were at the centre of a homosexual scandal incited by the Irish Nationalist politician William O&#x27;Brien through his newspaper &quot;United Ireland&quot;.

In 1907 the Irish Crown Jewels were stolen from the Castle. Suspicion fell upon the Officer of Arms, Sir Arthur Vicars, but rumours of his homosexuality and links to socially important gay men in London, may have compromised the investigation. The jewels have never been recovered.

At the very beginning of the Easter Rising of 1916, a force of twenty-five Irish Citizen Army members were able to seize the entrance and guard room of the Castle before reinforcements for the small garrison arrived. During the Anglo-Irish War the Castle was the nerve centre of the British effort against Irish separatism. On the night of Bloody Sunday in 1920, three Irish Republican Army members Dick McKee, Conor Clune and Peadar Clancy, were tortured and killed there.

When the Irish Free State came into being in 1922, Dublin Castle ceased to function as the administrative seat. It served for some years as temporary Courts of Justice (the Four Courts, the home of the Irish courts&#x27; system, had been destroyed in 1922). After the courts vacated the premises, the Castle was used for state ceremonies. As President of the Executive Council, Éamon de Valera received credentials there from newly arrived ambassadors to Ireland on behalf of King George V in the 1930s. In 1938, Douglas Hyde was inaugurated as President of Ireland at the Castle. All inaugurations of subsequent presidents have taken place there since. President Erskine Hamilton Childers&#x27; lying-in-state took place there in November 1974, as did that of former President Éamon de Valera in September 1975.

==Buildings and architecture==
===State Apartments===
The State Apartments, located in the southern range of buildings of the Upper Yard, contain the rooms formerly used by the Lord Lieutenant for personal accommodation and public entertaining during the Castle Season. Today these richly decorated rooms are used by the Irish government for official engagements including policy launches, hosting of State Visit ceremonial, and the inauguration of the president every seven years. The apartments and their collections form an accredited museum.

The principal rooms of the state apartment complex include:

;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Hall

This is the grandest room of the state apartments, and contains one of the most important decorative interiors in Ireland. Formerly the ballroom of the Lord Lieutenant&#x27;s administration, today the room is used for presidential inaugurations. If a president of Ireland dies in office, such as Erskine H. Childers in 1974, it is here that he or she lies in state. It is one of the oldest rooms in the castle, dating from the 1740s, though its decoration largely dates from c. 1790, including the most significant painted ceiling in Ireland, executed by Vincenzo Valdre (c. 1742–1814). Composed of three panels, the ceiling depicts the coronation of King George III, Saint Patrick introducing Christianity to Ireland, and King Henry II receiving the submission of the Irish chieftains. The state dinner hosted by the President of Ireland to welcome Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland was held here on the evening of 18 May 2011.

Following the disestablishment of the Church of Ireland in 1871, the Order of St. Patrick, Ireland&#x27;s order of chivalry, moved its ceremonial home from St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral to St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall. The banners and hatchment plates of the knights who were living at the time when most of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, in December 1922, remain in place.

;Throne Room
Originally built as the Battleaxe Hall in the 1740s, it was converted to a presence chamber around 1790. The regal decoration dates from that time and from alterations in the 1830s. It contains a throne built for the visit of King George IV to Ireland in 1821.

;State Drawing Room
Remodelled in the 1830s as the principal reception room of the Lord Lieutenant and his household, today this room is reserved in use for the reception of foreign dignitaries. Largely destroyed by fire in 1941, the room was reconstructed with minor modifications in 1964–1968 by the OPW, making use of salvaged and replicated furnishings and fittings.

;State Dining Room
Also called the Picture Gallery, and formerly known as the Supper Room, this is the oldest room in the castle and largely retains its original decoration, having escaped major modification and fire over the years. It dates from Lord Chesterfield&#x27;s building of the State Apartments in the 1740s, and was intended for use as a supper room adjoining St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall and as a personal dining room. Today the room is still used for dining when conferences take place in St. Patrick&#x27;s Hall.

;State bedrooms
These former private quarters of the Lord Lieutenant were built as five interconnecting rooms running along the back of the building, adjoining the spine corridor that separates them from the state drawing room. Completely rebuilt in the 1960s following a fire in 1941, the rooms maintain the original courtly sequence and today are used as ancillary drawing and meeting rooms to the principal apartments. The last dignitary to stay in the royal bedrooms was Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who spent a night there with her husband Denis during one of the European Council meetings held in the 1980s.

;State Corridor
The most architectural space of the State Apartments, this expressive, deeply modelled corridor, was originally built c. 1758 to the designs of the Surveyor General, Thomas Eyre. Based on the early 18th-century corridor of Sir Edward Lovett Pearce in the former Parliament House on College Green, it features a marching procession of vaults and arches which were originally top-lit. Regrettably, an office storey was built over the skylights following complete reconstruction of the corridor in the 1960s as the result of a differential settlement with the reconstruction of the adjoining drawing room. The corridor features exact plaster casts of the original arch detailing, and the original doorcases and fireplaces were salvaged prior to rebuilding.

===Towers===
The castle includes towers at two corners; other towers that once existed within the complex.

;Bermingham Tower
The base of the original Bermingham Tower is one of the few remaining parts of the original castle. At the southwest corner of the castle, the tower has a modern upper part. It is unclear which member of the De Bermingham family the tower was named for; perhaps William or Walter or John or Sir Walter.

;Record Tower
The Record Tower at the southeast corner is another original part of the castle. Also known as the Wardrobe Tower, it originally dates from the 1220s. It was restored between 1810 and 1813 by Francis Johnston. It hosted the Garda Museum until its 2017 relaunch in the Treasury Building.

;Bedford Tower
Construction of Bedford Tower began in 1750, and was completed in 1761 by Thomas Eyre. The Guard House mirrors it.

;Powder Tower
The base of this tower can be seen in the basement of the northeast corner of the lower castle yard. It was also known as the Storehouse Tower and was built around 1228. Its calp walls were 3.7 metres thick, and the internal diameter was 6.1 metres. The base of this tower is still along the flow of the River Poddle. Surviving Viking defences remain under this section of the Castle.

;Cork Tower
This tower stood at the northwest corner of the medieval enclosure. The base remains behind the west range of the upper castle yard.

===Architecture===
John Cornforth described the Castle as &quot;not even a work of architecture&quot; but &quot;a piece of English make-do and mend&quot;.

==Government offices==
The complex houses, among other things, some offices of the Revenue Commissioners, including a Stamping Office in a 20th-century building at the end of the Castle Yard. The modern office block was designed by Frank du Berry, a senior OPW architect, in the late 1960s. The design was denounced by many groups, citing the unsympathetic nature of the four-storey block and the placement, which disrupted the rectangular layout of the Castle. Among the groups that objected were the Irish Georgian Society, An Taisce, and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland. Construction began anyway in 1970.

Some elements of the OPW are based in an old stables area, and some functions of the Garda Síochána are also based at the Castle.

==Tourism and culture==
The complex of buildings is usually open to the public, except during certain state functions. The crypt of the Chapel Royal is now used as an arts centre, and occasional concerts are held in the grounds of the Castle.

The castle complex also hosts the Chester Beatty Library, in a purpose-constructed facility, with a café, the Garda Museum, in the Treasury Building, and the Revenue Museum.

The former site of the &quot;dark pool&quot; on the Poddle was remodelled into a garden, with a water feature that commemorates fallen Gardaí, and a helipad.

Opposite the garden is a sculpture and plaque commemorating the volunteers of the 2003 Special Olympics World Summer Games.

==Operation==
Dublin Castle is maintained and managed by the Office of Public Works (OPW).

== Popular media ==
===Film===
Dublin Castle has appeared in numerous films including &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, &quot;Becoming Jane&quot; and &quot;The Medallion&quot;, as well as the television series &quot;The Tudors&quot;, where it doubles as the Vatican in the pilot.

===Festivals===
Part of Dublin Castle appears on the cover of the Jandek album &quot;Khartoum Variations&quot;.

=== Fiction ===
In George Moore&#x27;s &quot;A Drama in Muslin&quot;, Dublin Castle appears in a number of chapters as the venue for high society events associated with the Viceroy and the British administration in Dublin.

<doc id="147850" wikidata="Q2293395" url="?curid=147850" title="Slip It In">
<text>Slip It In is the fourth studio album by the American hardcore punk band Black Flag, released in 1984 by SST Records.

&quot;Slip It In&quot; is an extension of the sound Black Flag utilized on its second album &quot;My War&quot;: heavy, cathartic, intense, dense and progressive. The album pursued the newer, lengthier song arrangements that Black Flag would develop until its demise. It also features Henry Rollins&#x27; further development as a lyricist, contributing four of eight tracks on the album. This album also demonstrates Black Flag&#x27;s increasing use of instrumentals, where Greg Ginn demonstrates his increasingly more complex playing style.

==Recording and style==
&quot;Slip It In&quot; was recorded on a brief break on the continuous tour for &quot;My War&quot;, which saw Black Flag at their most ambitious. This year they would release three full-length albums and toured nearly constantly, with Rollins noting 178 performances for the year, and about that many for 1985. With Dukowski gone, Ginn ceded much of the spotlight to Rollins, who had expressed some discomfort over being the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; spokesman, while Ginn was the recognized leader (Ginn wrote the majority of the group&#x27;s songs and lyrics).

In many ways, &quot;Slip It In&quot; is a fusion of the styles utilized on their previous releases (with vocals), &quot;Damaged&quot; and &quot;My War&quot;. The songs are inspired by heavy metal, yet the material also shows traces of &quot;sludgy &#x27;pre-grunge&#x27; metal, hardcore punk, and thrash to blues rock and jazz.&quot; The track &quot;My Ghetto&quot; even contains traces of a musical style that would later become known as powerviolence. At the middle point of the album, there is an instrumental track called &quot;Obliteration&quot; which highlights Ginn&#x27;s chord progressions where Brandon Sideleau of Punknews.org claims that it &quot;mashes sludge and jazz into an ominous hybrid.&quot;

==Cover art==
The album cover features a provocative piece of Raymond Pettibon artwork, as many of Black Flag&#x27;s album/single covers and gig fliers do. The image is of a nun embracing a bare male leg. Bassist Kira Roessler has expressed complex feelings about the image. For example, she has said &quot;I didn&#x27;t really recognize that they might have interesting ideas about women and that me being in the band was controversial. I didn&#x27;t think that way until I saw the cover of &quot;Slip It In&quot; and I kind of realized, for one thing, they certainly didn&#x27;t glorify women. That cover does not glorify women.&quot; She has also indicated that she has come to terms with the cover art choice.

==Music video==
A low-budget music video was produced for the album&#x27;s title track. It revolves around a teacher lip syncing to the vocals to the song along with the class and cuts to clips to the band performing to the song. The video ends with the teacher telling about the album coming out and promoting their &quot;students&quot; to see them on their tour.

==Reception==

&quot;Slip It In&quot; has received mixed reviews over the years. Shortly after its release, Ira Robbins of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; dismissed the album, writing that it &quot;blurs the line between moronic punk and moronic metal. Songs are mostly built on trite riffs repeated endlessly; the rude lyrics of the title song are performed complete with enthusiastic sex noises for anyone who fails to grasp the point and/or be offended by it.&quot; Robert Christgau was also quite negative, despite reserving some praise for the song &quot;You&#x27;re Not Evil&quot;. 

In retrospective reviews, John Dougan of AllMusic wrote that while the album was a bit better than its predecessor and featured &quot;increasingly avant-garde and exciting&quot; guitarwork from Greg Ginn (which was compared to James Blood Ulmer), it &quot;still wanders a bit&quot;. Brandon Sideleau of Punknews.org calls it &quot;a classic and a landmark for independent music.&quot; He defends the title track, calling it a &quot;punk metal masterpiece often unfairly seen as sexist, when in reality it&#x27;s quite the opposite. Greg Ginn&#x27;s lyrics are raunchy and angry, but the song is more about people and their choices than anything else.&quot;

<text>Ian Thomas Garner MacKaye (; born April 16, 1962) is an American musician. Active since 1979, he is best known as the co-founder and owner of Dischord Records, a Washington, D.C.–based independent record label, and the frontman of hardcore punk band Minor Threat and post-hardcore band Fugazi. MacKaye was also the bassist for the short-lived band the Teen Idles, and frontman for Embrace, and Pailhead, a collaboration with the band Ministry. MacKaye is a member of The Evens, a two-piece indie rock group he formed with his wife Amy Farina in 2001. In 2015 he formed the band Coriky with Farina and his Fugazi band mate Joe Lally.

Along with his seminal band Minor Threat, he is credited with coining the term &quot;straight edge&quot; a philosophy that promotes abstinence from alcohol and other drugs, though MacKaye has stated that he did not intend to turn it into a movement.

A key figure in the development of hardcore punk and an independent-minded, do-it-yourself punk ethic, MacKaye has produced releases by Q and Not U, John Frusciante, 7 Seconds, Nation of Ulysses, Bikini Kill, Rites of Spring, Dag Nasty and Rollins Band.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Ian MacKaye was born in Washington, D.C., on April 16, 1962, and grew up in the Glover Park neighborhood of Washington, D.C. His father was a writer for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, first as a White House reporter, then as a religion specialist; the senior MacKaye remains active with the socially progressive St. Stephen&#x27;s Episcopal Church. In his capacities as a journalist in the White House Press Corps, MacKaye&#x27;s father was in the presidential motorcade when John F. Kennedy was killed in 1963. MacKaye&#x27;s paternal grandmother was Dorothy Cameron Disney MacKaye. She worked with Paul Popenoe on marriage advice columns and was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club. His grandfather was Milton MacKaye, also a magazine writer as well as an executive with the Office of War Information. According to MacKaye&#x27;s longtime friend, singer Henry Rollins, MacKaye&#x27;s parents &quot;raised their kids in a tolerant, super-intellectual, open-minded atmosphere.&quot;

MacKaye first learned to play piano as a child. He eventually took lessons, but quit when his mother placed him in a more academic environment. He first attempted guitar at around ten due to inspirations such as Jimi Hendrix, but again he quit when he was unable to understand the connection between piano and guitar.

MacKaye listened to many types of music, but was especially fond of mainstream hard rock such as Ted Nugent and Queen. MacKaye was introduced to punk rock in November of 1978 when a group of his friends, including future filmmaker Jem Cohen, lent him early British punk records such as Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot; and Generation X&#x27;s &quot;Generation X&quot;. The following year, MacKaye went to his first punk concert, watching The Cramps perform at nearby Georgetown University. He was particularly influenced by the California hardcore scene. MacKaye looked up to hardcore bands like Bad Brains and Black Flag and was childhood friends with Henry Garfield (who later changed his name to Henry Rollins).

===Early bands===
MacKaye&#x27;s first band consisted of one performance as the Slinkees in the summer of 1979, performing a song titled &quot;I Drink Milk.&quot; The band also recorded two demo tapes of covers as well as songs that would later be recorded by the Teen Idles.

The Slinkees evolved into the Teen Idles, in which MacKaye played bass guitar and sang back up vocals. The band was short-lived, breaking up in 1980, but released an EP, &quot;Minor Disturbance&quot;, the first record from MacKaye and bandmate Jeff Nelson&#x27;s newly-founded label, Dischord Records.

===Minor Threat===
After feeling creatively limited in the Teen Idles, MacKaye was determined to be the frontman and primary lyricist for his own band. He founded Minor Threat (1980–1983) with Nelson after the break up of their previous band. MacKaye cited the dynamic performance of singer Joe Cocker in &quot;Woodstock&quot; as a major influence on his own animated stage persona. The Teen Idles and Minor Threat were modestly successful in and around Washington, D.C., but would later be cited as two of the earliest and most influential hardcore punk groups, and as pioneers of the straight edge philosophy that rejects use of drugs (including alcohol), tobacco, and sex. In his early teens, MacKaye saw the negative effects of drug abuse on several close friends and one immediate family member, and he vowed to never use tobacco, alcohol, or other drugs. During their existence Minor Threat were inactive for several months due to Lyle Preslar being at college; during this hiatus MacKaye and Nelson briefly formed a new band which dissolved when Minor Threat reunited, Skewbald/Grand Union (1981–1982).

After Minor Threat broke up, MacKaye was active with several relatively short-lived groups, including Embrace (1985–1986) and Egg Hunt (1986). Pailhead (1987–1988), a collaboration between MacKaye and the industrial metal band Ministry, then consisting of Al Jourgensen, Paul Barker, and William Rieflin, featured MacKaye on lead vocals.

===Fugazi===

In 1987, MacKaye founded Fugazi, a band that has been cited as one of the most important post-hardcore groups. Fugazi set itself apart from most other bands by never playing a show with high-priced tickets. They would often turn down venue options for this very rule, and the band would go so far as to stop a show and have unruly concert goers escorted out of the venue – complete with a refund of their ticket money. The band famously turned down at least one offer to headline Lollapalooza because festival organizers refused to price tickets cheaply; MacKaye objected to the $30 ticket price. MacKaye also has never conducted an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine or any other similar publication, stating he would only do so if the magazine agreed to not advertise cigarettes or alcohol.

===The Evens===
MacKaye currently sings and plays baritone guitar in The Evens with drummer and vocalist Amy Farina of the Warmers. The band pride themselves on playing in non-standard locations, such as community centres, bookshops, or other atypical spaces. The Evens released their self-titled album in early 2005, breaking a three-year silence by MacKaye. Their second album, &quot;Get Evens&quot;, was released in November 2006. Their last album, titled &quot;The Odds&quot;, was released 2012.

===Coriky===

In 2018, MacKaye, along with Farina and Joe Lally (Fugazi, the Messthetics), debuted a new band. In February 2020, it was announced that the band, now called Coriky, would release their first album on March 27, 2020, however due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the album was pushed back to May 29, 2020. The debut single, &quot;Clean Kill&quot;, was released on February 11, 2020.

===Other projects===
In 1982, MacKaye sang lead vocals on one version of a Government Issue song titled &quot;Asshole&quot;. The previously unreleased track was featured on the &quot;20 Years of Dischord&quot; collection released in 2002. Backing vocals and collaborations – as, for example, with brother Alec MacKaye&#x27;s former band Ignition – are numerous.

MacKaye contributed an extra guitar track to &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;, the second single from Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Dirty&quot;.

In 1988, he recorded vocals with Ministry&#x27;s Al Jourgensen, Paul Barker, and Bill Rieflin for the band Pailhead&#x27;s EP titled &quot;Trait&quot;. He also co-wrote the song &quot;I Will Refuse&quot; which was also released by the Wax Trax! record label.

In February 2004, MacKaye produced the recording sessions for John Frusciante&#x27;s solo album titled &quot;DC EP&quot;. After working with MacKaye, Frusciante states &quot;Ian is one of the only living people who I really respect and look up to, so it was an honor and a pleasure as well as a great learning experience to hear his perspective.&quot;

MacKaye has also contributed guitar and backing vocals to Joe Lally&#x27;s solo albums &quot;There to Here&quot;, released in October 2006, and &quot;Nothing Is Underrated&quot;, released in November 2007.

Throughout his music career MacKaye has engineered and produced releases by a number of bands primarily on his Dischord label including 7 Seconds, Antelope, Bikini Kill, Black Eyes, Lungfish, Nation of Ulysses, One Last Wish, Q and Not U, Rites of Spring, Rollins Band, and others.

===Dischord Records===

MacKaye co-founded Dischord Records with Jeff Nelson in 1980 and it continued as a DIY project, whereby those involved learned how to produce records – MacKaye claims that they crafted 10,000 singles by hand for a Teen Idles release.

== Career ==

===Campaigning, business and activism===

Throughout his career, MacKaye has opted to advertise in independent and underground media and perform in unconventional venues. Such practices keep admission prices low (in the US$5–US$15 range) and allow fans of all ages to attend performances. Maintaining a low overhead and protecting monetary assets are also important ideals for MacKaye, who in the summer of 1990 formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd in order to shield his own and his bandmates&#x27; personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As Seth Martin, MacKaye&#x27;s financial adviser explained to the &quot;Washington Post&quot; in a 1993 interview: &quot;protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be a little harder to go after their personal assets.&quot;

MacKaye has also been known to rebuke concert violence and to confront crowd surfers and other unruly concert attendees who start fights. This is especially true of his days with Fugazi. When audience members became belligerent or violent at a Fugazi show, the band would cease to play (sometimes right in the middle of a song) and MacKaye would tell them to stop. If those people continued their deviant behavior, he would have their admission price refunded and have them ejected from the concert venue.

In 2007 MacKaye provided technical audio assistance to Alan Canfora, a former Kent State University student who, in 1970, was injured by a gunshot while protesting the U.S. invasion of Cambodia. MacKaye cleaned up a field recording of the incident made by another student. According to Canfora, a voice can be heard on the tape yelling, &quot;Right here! Get set! Point! Fire!&quot; before a 13-second volley of gunfire commences.

==Impact==
===Straight edge philosophy===

The song &quot;Straight Edge&quot; was written by MacKaye for his band Minor Threat and was released in 1981 on Minor Threat&#x27;s self-titled EP. It was a song that described his personal life free of drugs, alcohol and &quot;sex as a conquest&quot;, though claimed he was not attempting to force the lifestyle on others. The song came about through MacKaye moving away from DC as a teenager, briefly to Palo Alto, California, and returning to find friends addicted to alcohol &amp; drugs. 

His decision to abstain from substances began to influence youth culture as Minor Threat gained popularity through numerous live shows and sales of their EP. Although to MacKaye the song did not represent a philosophy or a movement, over time people adopted the philosophy of the song and many bands began to label themselves &quot;straight edge&quot;, founding the straight edge movement. Although straight edge is not explicitly supportive of vegetarianism, MacKaye has stated that he is a vegetarian because he regards it as a logical progression of his views. He follows a strict vegan diet. In interviews especially in his later life, MacKaye has often become annoyed with questions about being the founding father of a movement he never intended to start:

Although &quot;Straight Edge&quot; gets the most attention, MacKaye wrote other songs with Minor Threat describing his clean lifestyle as well, most notably &quot;Out of Step (With the World),&quot; in which he said &quot;I don&#x27;t smoke. I don&#x27;t drink. I don&#x27;t fuck. At least I can fucking think.&quot; &quot;In My Eyes&quot; is also at least partially about his philosophies, with lines such as &quot;You tell me it calms your nerves; you just think it looks cool.&quot;

==Equipment==

===Guitars===
*Gibson SG – MacKaye&#x27;s main guitar with Fugazi was a white mid 1970&#x27;s Gibson SG. He also frequently used another mid 1970s brown SG. Both guitars are fitted with DiMarzio Super Distortion humbuckers in the bridge position. 
*Creston Electric Instruments Baritone – MacKaye uses a Danelectro baritone guitar with The Evens.

===Amplification===
*Marshall JCM 800 100 watt 2203 [Horizontal Input] (also seen with footage of late 70&#x27;s era Marshall JMP 100 watt 2203 Master Volume Model.)

*Note: Guitars were plugged directly into the high gain input in his JCM 800s, his presence and treble were set very low and the bass and mids cranked on the amp.
*Fender Tweed Deluxe, used when performing with The Evens.

===Effects===
Contrary to popular belief, he has never used any effects.

==Personal life==
MacKaye currently lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife Amy Farina and their son Carmine Francis Farina MacKaye, who was born on May 24, 2008.

In 2012, MacKaye&#x27;s wife threw him a surprise 50th birthday party which included many guests from the late 1970s and early 1980s DC punk/hardcore scene, many of whom had not seen each other in 20 years.

MacKaye&#x27;s younger brother Alec MacKaye has also been active in several notable bands, such as Untouchables, the Faith, Ignition and The Warmers, which included Ian&#x27;s wife Amy. His musical collaborations with Ian are limited but he is known for appearing in the iconic photograph used for many Minor Threat releases including &quot;Complete Discography&quot;.

He has been close friends with Henry Rollins since childhood and was the first person to take the stage at Rollins&#x27; 50th birthday performance at the National Geographic Explorers&#x27; Hall in Washington DC on February 13, 2011. They speak to each other every week by phone, usually on Sundays.

Despite persistently voting Democratic, MacKaye does not explicitly consider himself a Democrat. He has explained that he votes solely for the politician he believes is least likely to engage in war. He also noted that he had voted for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. When further probed for a summation of his political views, he explained: My rule of thumb in terms of voting for presidential elections always boils down to one thing. Whoever becomes the president of this country is what the people of this country deserve, because it was either they voted for that person or they allowed that election to be rigged, or they didn&#x27;t put enough of a fight about it. However, the rest of the world does not deserve whoever our president is. It shouldn&#x27;t be their problem at all. It&#x27;s our problem. Our country has an enormous impression on the rest of the world. In my opinion at least, the most visceral effect on the rest of the world is war, essentially murder. This country has excelled in murdering people in other places, certainly in the last 10 years. So my rule of thumb in terms for voting is voting for the person who is electable and is least likely to engage in war. And that is it. It&#x27;s a very simple equation.

==Works outside of music==

The documentary revisits the band&#x27;s sources of inspiration, with MacKaye playing a defining role. He was also interviewed in the documentary film &quot;Breadcrumb Trail: The Story of Slint&quot;, made about the band Slint.&quot;&quot;

MacKaye was also featured in professional skateboarder Mike Vallely&#x27;s documentary film &quot;Drive&quot; (2002).

In 2024 MacKaye was featured in the documentary &quot;Cover Your Ears&quot; produced by &quot;Prairie Coast Films&quot; and directed by &quot;Sean Patrick Shaul&quot;, discussing music censorship.

===Books===
MacKaye has contributed to several books, including &quot;The Idealist&quot; by Glen E. Friedman (Burning Flags Press, 1998, updated 2004, ); a foreword to indie-punk band photographer Pat Graham&#x27;s photobook &quot;Silent Pictures&quot;; an introduction to Susie Horgan&#x27;s photobook &quot;Punk Love&quot;, &quot;Interrobang?! Anthology on Music and Family&quot;, edited by Sharon Cheslow; and is interviewed in &quot;American Heretics: Rebel Voices In Music&quot; by Ben Myers (Codex Books, 2002). MacKaye is also featured in the Friedman book &quot;Keep Your Eyes Open&quot; (), a collection of Fugazi photos taken by Friedman over the course of the band&#x27;s career.

He also had a conversation with photographer Jim Saah, included in the photozine &quot;In My Eyes&quot;,() published by Argentinian publishing house Walden Editora in 2018.

<text>The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit of time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. More simply, the speed of sound is how fast vibrations travel. At , the speed of sound in air, is about , or in or one mile in . It depends strongly on temperature as well as the medium through which a sound wave is propagating. 

At , the speed of sound in dry air (sea level 14.7 psi) is about .

The speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in dry air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.

In colloquial speech, &quot;speed of sound&quot; refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: typically, sound travels most slowly in gases, faster in liquids, and fastest in solids. 

For example, while sound travels at in air, it travels at in water (almost 4.3 times as fast) and at in iron (almost 15 times as fast). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 m/s (39,370 ft/s), about 35 times its speed in air and about the fastest it can travel under normal conditions.

In theory, the speed of sound is actually the speed of vibrations. Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids) and a different type of sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs only in solids. Shear waves in solids usually travel at different speeds than compression waves, as exhibited in seismology. The speed of compression waves in solids is determined by the medium&#x27;s compressibility, shear modulus, and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material&#x27;s shear modulus and density.

In fluid dynamics, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound (in the same medium) is called the object&#x27;s Mach number. Objects moving at speeds greater than the speed of sound (&quot;&quot;) are said to be traveling at supersonic speeds.

==Earth==

In Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the speed of sound varies greatly from about at high altitudes to about at high temperatures.

==History==

Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s 1687 &quot;Principia&quot; includes a computation of the speed of sound in air as . This is too low by about 15%. The discrepancy is due primarily to neglecting the (then unknown) effect of rapidly fluctuating temperature in a sound wave (in modern terms, sound wave compression and expansion of air is an adiabatic process, not an isothermal process). This error was later rectified by Laplace.

During the 17th century there were several attempts to measure the speed of sound accurately, including attempts by Marin Mersenne in 1630 (1,380 Parisian feet per second), Pierre Gassendi in 1635 (1,473 Parisian feet per second) and Robert Boyle (1,125 Parisian feet per second). In 1709, the Reverend William Derham, Rector of Upminster, published a more accurate measure of the speed of sound, at 1,072 Parisian feet per second. (The Parisian foot was . This is longer than the standard &quot;international foot&quot; in common use today, which was officially defined in 1959 as , making the speed of sound at 1,055 Parisian feet per second).

Derham used a telescope from the tower of the church of St. Laurence, Upminster to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half-second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including North Ockendon church. The distance was known by triangulation, and thus the speed that the sound had travelled was calculated.

===Compression and shear waves===

In a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A longitudinal wave is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, and is the same process in gases and liquids, with an analogous compression-type wave in solids. Only compression waves are supported in gases and liquids. An additional type of wave, the transverse wave, also called a shear wave, occurs only in solids because only solids support elastic deformations. It is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the &quot;polarization&quot; of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of orthogonal polarizations.

These different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an earthquake, where sharp compression waves arrive first and rocking transverse waves seconds later.

The speed of a compression wave in a fluid is determined by the medium&#x27;s compressibility and density. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility and density, but with the additional factor of shear modulus which affects compression waves due to off-axis elastic energies which are able to influence effective tension and relaxation in a compression. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material&#x27;s shear modulus and density.

==Equations==
The speed of sound in mathematical notation is conventionally represented by &quot;c&quot;, from the Latin &quot;celeritas&quot; meaning &quot;swiftness&quot;.

For fluids in general, the speed of sound &quot;c&quot; is given by the Newton–Laplace equation:
formula_1
where
* formula_2 is a coefficient of stiffness, the isentropic bulk modulus (or the modulus of bulk elasticity for gases);
* formula_3 is the density.

formula_4, where formula_5 is the pressure and the derivative is taken isentropically, that is, at constant entropy &quot;s&quot;. This is because a sound wave travels so fast that its propagation can be approximated as an adiabatic process, meaning that there isn&#x27;t enough time, during a pressure cycle of the sound, for significant heat conduction and radiation to occur.

Thus, the speed of sound increases with the stiffness (the resistance of an elastic body to deformation by an applied force) of the material and decreases with an increase in density. For ideal gases, the bulk modulus &quot;K&quot; is simply the gas pressure multiplied by the dimensionless adiabatic index, which is about 1.4 for air under normal conditions of pressure and temperature.

For general equations of state, if classical mechanics is used, the speed of sound &quot;c&quot; can be derived as follows:

Consider the sound wave propagating at speed formula_6 through a pipe aligned with the formula_7 axis and with a cross-sectional area of formula_8. In time interval formula_9 it moves length formula_10. In steady state, the mass flow rate formula_11 must be the same at the two ends of the tube, therefore the mass flux formula_12 is constant and formula_13. Per Newton&#x27;s second law, the pressure-gradient force provides the acceleration:
formula_14

And therefore:

formula_15

If relativistic effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the relativistic Euler equations.

In a non-dispersive medium, the speed of sound is independent of sound frequency, so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO2 which &quot;is&quot; a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at ultrasonic frequencies (greater than ).

In a dispersive medium, the speed of sound is a function of sound frequency, through the dispersion relation. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the phase velocity, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the group velocity. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see optical dispersion for a description.

==Dependence on the properties of the medium==
The speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the shear modulus), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on compressibility.

In fluids, only the medium&#x27;s compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the hot chocolate effect.

In gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the heat capacity ratio (adiabatic index), while pressure and density are inversely related to the temperature and molecular weight, thus making only the completely independent properties of &quot;temperature and molecular structure&quot; important (heat capacity ratio may be determined by temperature and molecular structure, but simple molecular weight is not sufficient to determine it).

Sound propagates faster in low molecular weight gases such as helium than it does in heavier gases such as xenon. For monatomic gases, the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that the atoms move in that gas.

For a given ideal gas the molecular composition is fixed, and thus the speed of sound depends only on its temperature. At a constant temperature, the gas pressure has no effect on the speed of sound, since the density will increase, and since pressure and density (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density—just as in liquids—but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio which can be independently derived from temperature and molecular composition (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (assuming the molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (for which the heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.

In non-ideal gas behavior regimen, for which the Van der Waals gas equation would be used, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.

Humidity has a small but measurable effect on the speed of sound (causing it to increase by about 0.1%–0.6%), because oxygen and nitrogen molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of water. This is a simple mixing effect.

==Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics==
In the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the temperature. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, the speed of sound is dependent &quot;solely&quot; upon temperature; see &quot;&quot; below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.

Since temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to , sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. The decrease of the speed of sound with height is referred to as a negative sound speed gradient.

However, there are variations in this trend above . In particular, in the stratosphere above about , the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the ozone layer. This produces a positive speed of sound gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the thermosphere above .

==Details==
===Speed of sound in ideal gases and air===

For an ideal gas, &quot;K&quot; (the bulk modulus in equations above, equivalent to &quot;C&quot;, the coefficient of stiffness in solids) is given by
formula_16
Thus, from the Newton–Laplace equation above, the speed of sound in an ideal gas is given by
formula_17
where
* &quot;γ&quot; is the adiabatic index also known as the &quot;isentropic expansion factor&quot;. It is the ratio of the specific heat of a gas at constant pressure to that of a gas at constant volume (formula_18) and arises because a classical sound wave induces an adiabatic compression, in which the heat of the compression does not have enough time to escape the pressure pulse, and thus contributes to the pressure induced by the compression;
* &quot;p&quot; is the pressure;
* &quot;ρ&quot; is the density.

Using the ideal gas law to replace &quot;p&quot; with &quot;nRT&quot;/&quot;V&quot;, and replacing &quot;ρ&quot; with &quot;nM&quot;/&quot;V&quot;, the equation for an ideal gas becomes
formula_19
where
* &quot;c&quot;ideal is the speed of sound in an ideal gas;
* &quot;R&quot; is the specific molar gas constant;
* &quot;k&quot; is the Boltzmann constant;
* &quot;γ&quot; (gamma) is the adiabatic index. At room temperature, where thermal energy is fully partitioned into rotation (rotations are fully excited) but quantum effects prevent excitation of vibrational modes, the value is for diatomic gases (such as oxygen and nitrogen), according to kinetic theory. Gamma is actually experimentally measured over a range from 1.3991 to 1.403 at , for air. Gamma is exactly for monatomic gases (such as argon) and it is for triatomic molecule gases that, like , are not co-linear (a co-linear triatomic gas such as is equivalent to a diatomic gas for our purposes here);
* &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature;
* &quot;M&quot; is the molar mass of the gas. The mean molar mass for dry air is about ;
* &quot;n&quot; is the number of moles;
* &quot;m&quot; is the mass of a single molecule.

This equation applies only when the sound wave is a small perturbation on the ambient condition, and the certain other noted conditions are fulfilled, as noted below. Calculated values for &quot;c&quot;air have been found to vary slightly from experimentally determined values.

Newton famously considered the speed of sound before most of the development of thermodynamics and so incorrectly used isothermal calculations instead of adiabatic. His result was missing the factor of &quot;γ&quot; but was otherwise correct.

Numerical substitution of the above values gives the ideal gas approximation of sound velocity for gases, which is accurate at relatively low gas pressures and densities (for air, this includes standard Earth sea-level conditions). Also, for diatomic gases the use of requires that the gas exists in a temperature range high enough that rotational heat capacity is fully excited (i.e., molecular rotation is fully used as a heat energy &quot;partition&quot; or reservoir); but at the same time the temperature must be low enough that molecular vibrational modes contribute no heat capacity (i.e., insignificant heat goes into vibration, as all vibrational quantum modes above the minimum-energy-mode have energies that are too high to be populated by a significant number of molecules at this temperature). For air, these conditions are fulfilled at room temperature, and also temperatures considerably below room temperature (see tables below). See the section on gases in specific heat capacity for a more complete discussion of this phenomenon.

For air, we introduce the shorthand
formula_20

In addition, we switch to the Celsius temperature , which is useful to calculate air speed in the region near (). Then, for dry air,
formula_21

Substituting numerical values
formula_22
formula_23
and using the ideal diatomic gas value of , we have
formula_24

Finally, Taylor expansion of the remaining square root in formula_25 yields
formula_26

A graph comparing results of the two equations is to the right, using the slightly more accurate value of for the speed of sound at .

===Effects due to wind shear===
The speed of sound varies with temperature. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is refracted upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an acoustic shadow at some distance from the source. Wind shear of 4 m/(s · km) can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature lapse rate of . Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction, eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs because there is a wind gradient; the fact that sound is carried along by the wind is not important.

For sound propagation, the exponential variation of wind speed with height can be defined as follows:
formula_27
where
* &quot;U&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) is the speed of the wind at height &quot;h&quot;;
* &quot;ζ&quot; is the exponential coefficient based on ground surface roughness, typically between 0.08 and 0.52;
* &quot;dU&quot;/&quot;dH&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) is the expected wind gradient at height &quot;h&quot;.

In the 1862 American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only (six miles) downwind.

===Tables===
In the standard atmosphere:
* &quot;T&quot;0 is (= = ), giving a theoretical value of (= = = = ). Values ranging from 331.3 to may be found in reference literature, however;
* &quot;T&quot;20 is (= = ), giving a value of (= = = = );
* &quot;T&quot;25 is (= = ), giving a value of (= = = = ).

In fact, assuming an ideal gas, the speed of sound &quot;c&quot; depends on temperature and composition only, not on the pressure or density (since these change in lockstep for a given temperature and cancel out). Air is almost an ideal gas. The temperature of the air varies with altitude, giving the following variations in the speed of sound using the standard atmosphere—&quot;actual conditions may vary&quot;.

Given normal atmospheric conditions, the temperature, and thus speed of sound, varies with altitude:

==Effect of frequency and gas composition==

===General physical considerations===
The medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result, the speed of sound can vary with frequency.

The limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the mean free path increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes. The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the sound wave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.

The molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher speed of sound (over 9% higher) because they have a higher &quot;γ&quot; (...) than diatomics do (). Thus, at the same molecular mass, the speed of sound of a monatomic gas goes up by a factor of
formula_28

This gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for speeds of sound at room temperature in helium vs. deuterium, each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases; the figure is 75% in monatomic gases and 68% in diatomic gases).

In this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see heat capacity). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas give the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between the speed of sound in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.

===Practical application to air===
By far, the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.

The speed of sound is raised by humidity. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature.

The dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about as the frequency rises from to . For audible frequencies above it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.

As shown above, the approximate value 1000/3 = 333.33... m/s is exact a little below and is a good approximation for all &quot;usual&quot; outside temperatures (in temperate climates, at least), hence the usual rule of thumb to determine how far lightning has struck: count the seconds from the start of the lightning flash to the start of the corresponding roll of thunder and divide by 3: the result is the distance in kilometers to the nearest point of the lightning bolt. Or divide the number of seconds by 5 for an approximate distance in miles.

==Mach number==

Mach number, a useful quantity in aerodynamics, is the ratio of air speed to the local speed of sound. At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature.
Aircraft flight instruments, however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a Pitot tube is dependent on altitude as well as speed.

==Experimental methods==
A range of different methods exist for the measurement of the speed of sound in air.

The earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by William Derham and acknowledged by Isaac Newton. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the Church of St Laurence in Upminster, England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance/time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 metres, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.

===Single-shot timing methods===
The simplest concept is the measurement made using two microphones and a fast recording device such as a digital storage scope. This method uses the following idea.

If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:
# The distance between the microphones (), called microphone basis.
# The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones ().

Then .

===Other methods===
In these methods, the time measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time (frequency).

Kundt&#x27;s tube is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the nodes and antinodes visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.

A tuning fork can be held near the mouth of a long pipe which is dipping into a barrel of water. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to where &quot;n&quot; is an integer. As the antinodal point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.

Here it is the case that &quot;v&quot; = &quot;fλ&quot;.

===High-precision measurements in air===
The effect of impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical desiccants can be used to dry the air, but will, in turn, contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave &quot;the most probable value of the standard speed of sound to date.&quot; The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at but corrected for temperature in order to report them at . The result was for dry air at STP, for frequencies from to .

==Non-gaseous media==

===Speed of sound in solids===

====Three-dimensional solids====
In a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent
on the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In earthquakes, the corresponding seismic waves are called P-waves (primary waves) and S-waves (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by
formula_29
formula_30
where
* &quot;K&quot; is the bulk modulus of the elastic materials;
* &quot;G&quot; is the shear modulus of the elastic materials;
* &quot;E&quot; is the Young&#x27;s modulus;
* &quot;ρ&quot; is the density;
* &quot;ν&quot; is Poisson&#x27;s ratio.

The last quantity is not an independent one, as . The speed of pressure waves depends both on the pressure and shear resistance properties of the material, while the speed of shear waves depends on the shear properties only.

Typically, pressure waves travel faster in materials than do shear waves, and in earthquakes this is the reason that the onset of an earthquake is often preceded by a quick upward-downward shock, before arrival of waves that produce a side-to-side motion. For example, for a typical steel alloy, , and , yielding a compressional speed &quot;c&quot;solid,p of . This is in reasonable agreement with &quot;c&quot;solid,p measured experimentally at for a (possibly different) type of steel. The shear speed &quot;c&quot;solid,s is estimated at using the same numbers.

Speed of sound in semiconductor solids can be very sensitive to the amount of electronic dopant in them.

====One-dimensional solids====
The speed of sound for pressure waves in stiff materials such as metals is sometimes given for &quot;long rods&quot; of the material in question, in which the speed is easier to measure. In rods where their diameter is shorter than a wavelength, the speed of pure pressure waves may be simplified and is given by:
formula_31
where is Young&#x27;s modulus. This is similar to the expression for shear waves, save that Young&#x27;s modulus replaces the shear modulus. This speed of sound for pressure waves in long rods will always be slightly less than the same speed in homogeneous 3-dimensional solids, and the ratio of the speeds in the two different types of objects depends on Poisson&#x27;s ratio for the material.

===Speed of sound in liquids===

In a fluid, the only non-zero stiffness is to volumetric deformation (a fluid does not sustain shear forces).

Hence the speed of sound in a fluid is given by
formula_32
where is the bulk modulus of the fluid.

====Water====
In fresh water, sound travels at about at (see the External Links section below for online calculators). Applications of underwater sound can be found in sonar, acoustic communication and acoustical oceanography.

====Seawater====

In salt water that is free of air bubbles or suspended sediment, sound travels at about ( at , and 3% salinity by one method). The speed of sound in seawater depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature (a change of ~ ), and salinity (a change of 1‰ ~ ), and empirical equations have been derived to accurately calculate the speed of sound from these variables. Other factors affecting the speed of sound are minor. Since in most ocean regions temperature decreases with depth, the profile of the speed of sound with depth decreases to a minimum at a depth of several hundred metres. Below the minimum, sound speed increases again, as the effect of increasing pressure overcomes the effect of decreasing temperature (right). For more information see Dushaw et al.

An empirical equation for the speed of sound in sea water is provided by Mackenzie:
formula_33
where
* &quot;T&quot; is the temperature in degrees Celsius;
* &quot;S&quot; is the salinity in parts per thousand;
* &quot;z&quot; is the depth in metres.

The constants &quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2, ..., &quot;a&quot;9 are
formula_34
with check value for , , . This equation has a standard error of for salinity between 25 and 40 ppt. See for an online calculator.

(The Sound Speed vs. Depth graph does &quot;not&quot; correlate directly to the MacKenzie formula.
This is due to the fact that the temperature and salinity varies at different depths.
When &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are held constant, the formula itself is always increasing with depth.)

Other equations for the speed of sound in sea water are accurate over a wide range of conditions, but are far more complicated, e.g., that by V. A. Del Grosso and the Chen-Millero-Li Equation.

===Speed of sound in plasma===
The speed of sound in a plasma for the common case that the electrons are hotter than the ions (but not too much hotter) is given by the formula (see here)
formula_35
where
* &quot;m&quot;i is the ion mass;
* &quot;μ&quot; is the ratio of ion mass to proton mass ;
* &quot;T&quot;e is the electron temperature;
* &quot;Z&quot; is the charge state;
* &quot;k&quot; is Boltzmann constant;
* &quot;γ&quot; is the adiabatic index.

In contrast to a gas, the pressure and the density are provided by separate species: the pressure by the electrons and the density by the ions. The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.

== Mars ==
The speed of sound on Mars varies as a function of frequency. Higher frequencies travel faster than lower frequencies. Higher frequency sound from lasers travels at , while low frequency sound travels at .

==Gradients==

When sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean, there is a layer called the &#x27;deep sound channel&#x27; or SOFAR channel which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.

In the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher refractive index, sound waves will refract towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined to a sheet of glass or optical fiber. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.

A similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. Project Mogul successfully used this effect to detect a nuclear explosion at a considerable distance.

<text>A straightedge or straight edge is a tool used for drawing straight lines, or checking their straightness. If it has equally spaced markings along its length, it is usually called a ruler.

Straightedges are used in the automotive service and machining industry to check the flatness of machined mating surfaces. They are also used in the decorating industry for cutting and hanging wallpaper.

True straightness can in some cases be checked by using a laser line level as an optical straightedge: it can illuminate an accurately straight line on a flat surface such as the edge of a plank or shelf.

A pair of straightedges called winding sticks are used in woodworking to make warping easier to perceive in pieces of wood.

Three straight edges can be used to test and calibrate themselves to a certain extent, however this procedure does not control twist. For accurate calibration of a straight edge, a surface plate must be used. 

==Compass-and-straightedge construction==
An idealized straightedge is used in compass-and-straightedge constructions in plane geometry.

It may be used:
* Given two points, to draw the line connecting them
* Given a point and a circle, to draw either tangent
* Given two circles, to draw any of their common tangents
* Or any of the other numerous geometric constructions

The idealized straightedge is:
* Infinitely long
* Infinitesimally thin (i.e. point width)
* Always assumed to be without graduations or marks, or the ability to mark
* Able to be aligned to two points with infinite precision to draw a line through them

It may not be marked or used together with the compass so as to transfer the length of one segment to another.

It is possible to do all compass and straightedge constructions without the straightedge. That is, it is possible, using only a compass, to find the intersection of two lines given two points on each, and to find the tangent points to circles. It is not, however, possible to do all constructions using only a straightedge. It &quot;is&quot; possible to do them with straightedge alone given a circle and its center.
