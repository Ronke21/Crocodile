<doc id="151290" wikidata="Q838112" url="?curid=151290" title="Wheeling, West Virginia">
<text>Wheeling is a city in Ohio and Marshall counties in the U.S. state of West Virginia. The county seat of Ohio County, it lies along the Ohio River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains within the state&#x27;s Northern Panhandle. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 27,062, making it the fifth-most populous city in West Virginia and the most populous in the Northern Panhandle. The Wheeling metropolitan area had a population of 139,513 in 2020. Wheeling is located about west of Pittsburgh and east of Columbus via Interstate 70.

Wheeling was settled in 1769 on land contested between colonial Pennsylvania and Virginia, and later grew to become Virginia&#x27;s largest city west of the Appalachians. During the American Civil War, Wheeling was the host of the Wheeling Conventions that led to the separation of West Virginia from Virginia and served as the state capital from 1861 to 1870, and again from 1875 to 1885. It became a manufacturing center in the late nineteenth century due to its location along major transportation routes, including the Ohio River, National Road, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. After the decline of heavy industry and substantial population loss following World War II, Wheeling&#x27;s major industries now include healthcare, education, law and legal services, entertainment and tourism, and energy.

==History==
===Arrival of early Europeans===
The origins of the name &quot;Wheeling&quot; are disputed. One of the more credible explanations is that the word comes from the Lenni-Lenape phrase &quot;wih link&quot; or &quot;wee lunk&quot;, which meant &quot;place of the head&quot; or &quot;place of the skull.&quot; This name supposedly referred to a white settler who was scalped and decapitated. His severed head was displayed at the confluence of Wheeling Creek and the Ohio River. Earlier sources say that the head was that of a Native American prisoner, not a settler. Native Americans had inhabited the area for thousands of years. In the 17th century, the Iroquois from present-day New York state conquered the upper Ohio Valley, pushing out other tribes and maintaining the area as their hunting ground.

Originally explored by the French, Wheeling still has a lead plate remnant that the explorer Céloron de Blainville buried in 1749 at the mouth of Wheeling Creek to mark his claim. Later, Christopher Gist and George Washington surveyed the land, in 1751 and 1770, respectively.

===Establishment of European settlement===
During the fall of 1769, Ebenezer Zane explored the Wheeling area and established claim to the land via &quot;tomahawk rights&quot;, the practice of girdling a few trees at a prominent site and marking the bark with the initials or name of the person making the claim. He returned the following spring with his wife Elizabeth and his younger brothers, Jonathan and Silas; they established the first permanent European settlement in the Wheeling area, naming it Zanesburg. Other families joined the settlement, including the Shepherds (see Monument Place), the Wetzels, and the McCollochs (see McColloch&#x27;s Leap).

In 1787, the United States gave Virginia this portion of lands west of the Appalachians, and some to Pennsylvania at its western edge, to settle their claims. By the Northwest Ordinance that year, it established the Northwest Territory to cover other lands north of the Ohio River and west to the Mississippi River. Settlers began to move into new areas along the Ohio.

In 1793, Ebenezer Zane divided the town into lots, and Wheeling was officially established as a town in 1795 by legislative enactment. The town was incorporated on January 16, 1805. On March 11, 1836, the town of Wheeling was incorporated into the city of Wheeling.

By an act of the Virginia General Assembly on December 27, 1797, Wheeling was named the county seat of Ohio County.

===Fort Henry===
Originally dubbed &quot;Fort Fincastle&quot; in 1774, the fort was later renamed Fort Henry in honor of Virginia&#x27;s American governor, Patrick Henry. In 1777, Native Americans of the Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo tribes joined to attack pioneer settlements along the upper Ohio River, which were illegal according to the Crown&#x27;s Proclamation of 1763. They hoped an alliance with the British would drive the colonial settlers out of their territory.

Local men defended the fort, later joined by recruits from Fort Shepherd (in Elm Grove) and Fort Holliday. The native force burned the surrounding cabins and destroyed livestock.

During the first attack of the year, Major Samuel McColloch led a small force of men from Fort Vanmetre along Short Creek to assist the besieged Fort Henry. Separated from his men, McColloch was chased by attacking natives. Upon his horse, McColloch charged up Wheeling Hill and made what is known as McColloch&#x27;s Leap down its eastern side.

In 1782, a native army along with British soldiers attempted to take Fort Henry. During this siege, Fort Henry&#x27;s supply of ammunition was exhausted. The defenders decided to dispatch a man to secure more ammunition from the Zane homestead. Betty Zane volunteered for the dangerous task. During her departing run, she was heckled by both native and British soldiers. After reaching the Zane homestead, she gathered a tablecloth and filled it with gunpowder. During her return, she was fired upon but was uninjured. As a result of her heroism, Fort Henry remained in American control.

===Role as transportation hub===
The National Road arrived in Wheeling in 1818, linking the Ohio River to the Potomac River, and allowing goods from the Ohio Valley to flow through Wheeling and on to points east. As the endpoint of the National Road, Wheeling became a gateway to early westward expansion. In 1849 the Wheeling Suspension Bridge crossed the Ohio River and allowed the city to expand onto Wheeling Island. Lessons learned in constructing the bridge were used in the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge. Rail transportation reached Wheeling in 1853 when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad connected Wheeling to Pennsylvania, Maryland, and markets in the Northeast. A new bridge connected the city to Bellaire, Ohio, just across the river, and to western areas of the U.S.

===Anti-slavery sentiment===
Much of the area had been settled by yeoman farmers, few of whom owned slaves. With the railroad, a larger industrial or mercantile middle class developed that depended on free labor; it felt either disinterest or hostility to slavery. The &quot;Wheeling Intelligencer&quot; newspaper expressed the area&#x27;s anti-secession sentiment as tensions rose over slavery and national issues. The city became part of the movement of western areas to secede from Virginia after the beginning of the Civil War, hosting the Wheeling Convention of 1861. It served as the provisional capital of the Restored Government of Virginia from 1861 to 1863, and became the first capital of West Virginia after the state seceded from Virginia and was admitted to the Union in its own right in 1863. From the acceptance of the new state of West Virginia into the union until the Restored Government of Virginia&#x27;s move to Alexandria in August of the same year, Wheeling was the state capital of both West Virginia and Virginia.

The growing German population, which included immigrants after the 1848 Revolutions, was firmly anti-slavery. The Germans of Wheeling organized the &quot;First West Virginia Artillery&quot; to oppose the Confederacy and played a role in the initial movement to separate from Virginia. The Germans&#x27; culture influenced the city, such as their &quot;German Singing Societies&quot;, the first of which began in 1855.

===Post-Civil War growth===

Although Wheeling lost its position as state capital in 1865, it continued to grow. In the late nineteenth century, Wheeling was the new state&#x27;s prime industrial center. One early nickname (until an 1885 strike) was &quot;Nail City&quot;, reflecting the iron manufacture in several mills, which dated from the 1840s. Mills transformed pig iron into sheets that could be cut, and some mills also produced boiler plates, stoves, barrel rings, and/or ornamental ironwork. Noted businesses of the era included the Bloch Brothers Tobacco Company (owned by state senator Jesse A. Bloch, who would in 1913 introduce legislation that became the state&#x27;s Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act), and later steel concerns after development of the Bessemer process. Wheeling Steel Corporation was created in 1920 and grew after a 1927 strike caused J.P. Morgan and other investors to sell National Tube Company, which had been created in 1899, six years after local owners had consolidated five plants in the area as Wheeling Steel &amp; Iron Company.

In 1866, Lincoln School opened in Wheeling to serve African American students. Lincoln High School was taught by Laura Grayson-Morison. A new building for Lincoln High School opened in the early 1940s; the school closed with desegregation in 1954.

Wheeling had considerable associations with the American labor movement. In 1904 it became the first city in the country to refuse a proposed Andrew Carnegie gift of a free library, because of the industrialist&#x27;s labor record, especially the notorious Homestead Strike of 1892. By contrast, cigar tycoon Augustus Pollack (despite once rousing controversy by a plan to use convict labor) left many bequests to the labor movement, which erected a memorial statue. The city&#x27;s earliest union was the United Nailers (1860, which later merged into the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers), followed by the cigar makers in 1862. The 1877 railroad strike at Martinsburg, West Virginia, reached Wheeling and spread nationwide. In 1897, Eugene Debs, Mother Jones, and Samuel Gompers were among the speakers at a national labor convention in Wheeling to discuss a nationwide coal strike.

With industry, Wheeling reached its peak of population in 1930. As the city grew, prosperous Wheeling residents built fine houses, especially on Wheeling Island, but slums also expanded. As a result of that growth, an ordinance was passed regulating personal cesspools, including a ban on pipe communications with other homes and businesses unless offensive smells were properly trapped.

=== Modern decline and revitalization efforts ===
The Great Depression, and later changes and restructuring in heavy industry following World War II, led to a loss of working-class jobs and population. Capitalizing on its rich architectural heritage, Wheeling has worked to revive its Main Street with the Downtown Wheeling Streetscape project. Additionally, the city has been redeveloping the historic 1400 Market Street, just one block east of Main Street.

==Arts and culture==

The city of Wheeling has a rich and varied history. West Virginia Independence Hall was the site of the Wheeling Convention, two meetings held in 1861 that ultimately reversed Virginia&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession. 26 counties in Virginia&#x27;s north and west voted against secession from the Union and created the new state of West Virginia, which the United States quickly admitted. Later in 1861 and continuing to 1863, the building was the site of many heated debates during the First Constitutional Convention of West Virginia, including the name of the new state. The oldest building in the area is Shepherd Hall (Monument Place), built in 1798.
Wheeling is home to Centre Market, formerly Wheeling&#x27;s market house. Built in 1853, the market house and the surrounding area have been adapted for use as retail shops and restaurants.

The first official memorial monument in the state of West Virginia dedicated specifically to men killed in the Vietnam War, was dedicated in Wheeling, with full military honors, in a Memorial Day 1986 ceremony. The monument was erected in front of the flagpole near the main shelter of Bethlehem Community Park in the village of Bethlehem, just southeast of Wheeling.
The roughly 6-foot-high granite memorial consists of a large bronze dedication plaque with the names of KIAs from the Wheeling/Ohio County region. Below the dedication plaque is a bronze map of South Vietnam, complete with names of 28 major cities.

===Theater===

Fans of theater have several options in Wheeling. The Capitol Theatre hosts numerous touring musical performances. The Oglebay Institute&#x27;s Towngate Theatre in Center Wheeling has produced plays for over 35 years.

===Music===
Wheeling has a long tradition of live musical performance and radio broadcasting. With over 2,500 seats, The Capitol Theatre is the largest theatre in West Virginia. Opened in 1928, The Capitol was home to &quot;It&#x27;s Wheeling Steel&quot;, a popular radio program in the early 1940s featuring musical performances by workers at a local steel plant. The Capitol has welcomed musical performances of all types, from Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, and Tammy Wynette, to Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, B.B. King, and Black Sabbath. Other past performers include Jerry Seinfeld, David Copperfield, and George Carlin.

The Wheeling Symphony Orchestra is housed at the Capitol Theatre and performs a range of contemporary, classical, and seasonal arrangements.

Wheeling is also home to the Victoria Theater, the oldest theater in West Virginia. The 700-seat Victorian-style theater was home to the WWVA Jamboree program from 1933 to 1936. More recently, it has been the site for the &quot;Wheeling Jamboree&quot;, a local initiative started in 2009 and modeled after the original WWVA Jamboree (which changed its name in the 1960s to Jamboree U.S.A.). The original WWVA Jamboree ran from 1933 to 2007, making it the second-longest-running country radio program and variety show in the country, after the &quot;Grand Ole Opry&quot; in Nashville, Tennessee.

Live music emanates from the amphitheatre at the Wheeling Heritage Port several nights per week from mid-spring through late fall. The waterfront park area hosts festivals, concerts, movie nights, celebrations, a regatta, and numerous visits from the &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Mississippi&quot; and &quot;American Queen&quot; riverboats. The Port holds over 8,000 spectators and has become a city focal point.

Formerly held in nearby Belmont County, Ohio, Jamboree In The Hills draws over 100,000 country music fans to the Wheeling area every July.

==Sports==

Wheeling, known as Nail City, is home to the Wheeling Nailers hockey team. The Nailers play in the WesBanco Arena (formerly the Wheeling Civic Center), and are part of the North division of the Eastern Conference of the ECHL.

==Parks and recreation==

Wheeling features several municipal parks, including Oglebay Resort &amp; Conference Center and Wheeling Park. Ohio County has six golf courses, including designs by renowned golfer Arnold Palmer and architect Robert Trent Jones.

In October 2007 the City of Wheeling opened the state&#x27;s first concrete skateboard park. The facility was designed and built by world-renowned skatepark builder Grindline, of Seattle, Washington. The park consists of 60% bowls and 40% street elements; it is located within the Chambers Ballfield Complex in the Elm Grove section of the city. An addition to the street section of the park was completed by Grindline in November 2009. A covered shelter, restrooms, and webcam are installed. The park is lighted and open 24/7.

===Live racing and gaming===
Wheeling is the home of Wheeling Island Hotel-Casino-Racetrack, located on Wheeling Island. Formerly known as Wheeling Downs, the facility features live greyhound racing, slots, poker games, and casino-style table games.

The Ohio County measure passed, but the Jefferson County one failed. A similar measure was successfully adopted in Hancock County on June 30, 2007.

==Government==

Under West Virginia law, cities may adopt a form of government called the Manager-Mayor Plan, under which Wheeling operates. The elected mayor presides over meetings of the Wheeling City Council, which has six members elected from geographic wards. City Council members serve four-year terms. The City Council also confirms executive nominations for members to various boards, which have limited regulatory authority, including the Planning Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals, and the Traffic Commission. The City Manager serves as Chief Executive and Administrative Officer for the city.

The current mayor of Wheeling is Denny Magruder, and the current city manager is Robert Herron. The current members of the City Council are Tony Assarro (1st Ward), Ben Seidler (2nd Ward), Connie Cain (3rd Ward), Vice-Mayor Jerry Sklavounakis (4th Ward), Ty Thorngate (5th Ward), and Dave Palmer (6th Ward). City elections were held on May 14, 2024, and the current term began on July 1, 2024. City elections will be held again on May 14, 2028.


===City flag===

The current flag for the city was adopted on September 4, 2018, in conjunction with the celebration of the city&#x27;s 250th anniversary the following year. Its design and symbolism are credited to the Wheeling Committee on Retention and the Wheeling 250 subcommittee.

The flag features two horizontal blue bars to represent Wheeling Creek and the Ohio River, with a white bar in between. The three bars also symbolize the three major modes of transportation found in Wheeling history: river, road, and rail. Representing five distinct eras of Wheeling history, five stars are centered in a row in the white bar: The Indigenous Star, The Frontier Star, The Transportation Star, The Statehood Star, and The Industrial Star.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary===
As elsewhere in West Virginia, K–12 schools are organized at the county level of government. The public school system, Ohio County Schools, consists of 14 schools: nine elementary schools; four middle schools, which include Triadelphia Middle, nominated for the blue ribbon school award; and the nationally recognized Wheeling Park High School. Several parochial and private schools, including Wheeling Central Catholic High School, the Linsly School, and Wheeling Country Day School are located in the city.

===Postsecondary===
Wheeling is the hub of higher education in the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia. Wheeling University, a private university and the only Catholic college in the state of West Virginia, is located here.

The main campus of West Virginia Northern Community College has recently been expanding with centers in downtown Wheeling; it focuses on job training and community development. Also located in close proximity to the city are West Liberty University (formerly West Liberty State College), a four-year university, and private Bethany College, giving area residents a wide variety of educational options.

==Media==

Located close to Pittsburgh, Wheeling is heavily influenced by its broadcast media outlets, which are easily received in the area. Besides broadcast stations, Wheeling&#x27;s cable providers carry AT&amp;T SportsNet Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh-centric news/talk channel PCNC as its &quot;home&quot; sports and information sources.

In addition to the Pittsburgh outlets, the Wheeling television market is served by ABC/CBS affiliate WTRF-TV Channel 7, PBS affiliate W30CO-D Channel 30, and NBC/FOX affiliate WTOV-TV Channel 9 in nearby Steubenville, Ohio. Cable television provider Comcast serves the city, parts of which Centre TV also services.

Wheeling is home to WWVA 1170 AM, the state&#x27;s only 50,000-watt AM station, which can be heard throughout the East Coast at night. WVLY 1370 AM and WKKX 1600 AM provide local news, sports, and talk. On the FM dial, WVKF 95.7, WKWK 97.3, WOVK 98.7, and WEGW 107.5 provide the area with various music genres. The Wheeling area is the home of WDUQ-LP, a listener-supported commercial-free station, which also serves as the local Pacifica affiliate. Pittsburgh&#x27;s radio stations provide Wheeling with coverage. Several translators and repeater stations provide NPR and American Family Radio networks. Wheeling also has a student-run radio station, WPHP 91.9, operated by Wheeling Park High School students. WPHP plays top 40 songs and also covers all of the Wheeling Park Patriots&#x27; football and basketball games.

The city is home to &quot;The Intelligencer&quot; and the &quot;Wheeling News-Register&quot; newspapers, owned by Wheeling-based Ogden Newspapers Inc. &quot;The Intelligencer&quot; is published weekday mornings and Saturdays, while the &quot;News-Register&quot; is published weekday afternoons and Sundays. &quot;The Times-Leader&quot; of Martins Ferry, Ohio, another Ogden Newspapers Inc. paper, also covers Wheeling issues. &quot;In Wheeling&quot; magazine is published quarterly and covers society and events in the city. Two local websites, &quot;Weelunk&quot; and &quot;Dateline: Wheeling,&quot; serve as independent news sources for the city.

==Transportation==
===Roads and bridges===
Interstate 70 and its spur Interstate 470 run through the city east–west and link it with suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to the east and Ohio to the west. U.S. Route 40/National Road links downtown with residential neighborhoods to the east. West Virginia Route 2 connects Wheeling with Moundsville to the south and Weirton to the north. U.S. Route 250 also runs through the city.

The Fort Henry Bridge and Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge carry I-70 and I-470, respectively, over the Ohio River. The historic Wheeling Suspension Bridge, completed in 1849, which was part of National Road, connects downtown and Wheeling Island; currently it is closed for safety reasons, by order of the state highway department, to vehicular traffic. I-70 passes under Wheeling Hill through the Wheeling Tunnel.

===Bus===
Bus transportation to points throughout North America is available from Wheeling through Greyhound Lines. The bus terminal, the Robert C. Byrd Intermodal Transportation Center, was built with $11.1 million in federal funds.

The East Ohio Authority and the Ohio Valley Regional Transit Authority (OVRTA), which share the Intermodal Transportation Center as the hub for hub-and-spoke routes, provide regional transportation through West Virginia and Eastern Ohio.

Wheeling operated streetcars from the 1880s until 1943 under the Wheeling Traction Company and Co-operative Transit Company. Buses replaced streetcar operations due to operating costs.

<text>Appleton () is a city in and the county seat of Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. A small portion of the city also extends into Calumet and Winnebago counties. It is situated on the Fox River, southwest of Green Bay and north of Milwaukee. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 75,644, making it the sixth-most populous city in Wisconsin. It is the principal city of the Appleton metropolitan statistical area, which had 243,147 residents in 2020 and is included in the greater Fox Cities region of Wisconsin.

Appleton serves as the heart of the Fox River Valley, which is home to Lawrence University, the Fox Cities Exhibition Center, Fox Cities Performing Arts Center, Fox River Mall, Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium, Appleton International Airport, and the Valley&#x27;s two major hospitals: St. Elizabeth Hospital and ThedaCare Regional Medical Center–Appleton. It also hosts regional events such as Octoberfest and the Mile of Music.

==History==

===Native American history===
The territory where Appleton is today was formerly occupied by the Ho-Chunk and the Menominee. The Menominee Nation ceded the territory to the United States in the Treaty of the Cedars in 1836. In the Menominee language, Appleton is known as &quot;Ahkōnemeh&quot;, or &quot;watches for them place&quot;.

The first European settlers in Appleton were fur traders seeking to do business with Fox River Valley Native Americans. Hippolyte Grignon built the White Heron in 1835 to house his family and serve as an inn and trading post.

===European settlement===
Appleton was settled in 1847. It was founded as three unincorporated villages along the Fox River. From south to north along the river, these were Grand Chute, Appleton, and Lawesburg. In 1853, the three were merged into the single incorporated Village of Appleton. John F. Johnston was the first resident and village president. Lawrence University, also founded in 1847, was backed financially by Amos A. Lawrence and originally known as the Lawrence Institute. Samuel Appleton, Lawrence&#x27;s father-in-law from New England who never visited Wisconsin, donated $10,000 to the newly founded college library, and the town took his name in appreciation.

The paper industry, beginning with the building of the first paper mill in the city in 1853, has been at the forefront of the development of Appleton. In order to provide electricity to the paper industry, the nation&#x27;s first hydro-electric central station, the Vulcan Street Plant on the Fox River, began operation on September 30, 1882. The power plant also powered the Hearthstone House, the first residence in the world powered by a centrally located hydroelectric station using the Edison system.

Shortly thereafter, in August 1886, Appleton was the site for another national first, the operation of a commercially successful electric streetcar company. Electric lights replaced gas lamps on College Avenue in 1912. Appleton also had the first telephone in Wisconsin, and the first incandescent light in any city outside of the East Coast.

The community was incorporated as a city on March 2, 1857, with Amos Story as its first mayor. Early in the 20th century, it adopted the commission form of government. In 1890, 11,869 people lived in Appleton; in 1900, there were 15,085; in 1910, 16,773; in 1920, 19,571; and in 1940, 28,436.

Significant annexations to the city, taken from the Town of Grand Chute, were performed in the next two decades. The first, the &quot;Glendale&quot; district, was completed on November 8, 1941, growing Appleton north past Glendale Avenue. Another became official on December 22, 1950, after multi-year disputes, when the unincorporated villages of Bell Heights and Whispering Pines were annexed into the city from Grand Chute. Bell Heights added new area to the northwest edge of Appleton, and Whispering Pines, to the northeast, would include land where Appleton Memorial Hospital would later be built. Bell Heights and Whispering Pines increased the population of the city by ten percent, and its area by twenty percent, overnight.

Appleton&#x27;s tallest building, the 222 Building was built in 1952. The Valley Fair Shopping Center, built in 1954, laid claim to being the first enclosed shopping mall in the United States, although this claim is disputed by other malls. In 2007 most of the structure was demolished, leaving only its east wing and a movie theater. A Pick &#x27;n Save Food Center now stands in its place.

From approximately 1930–1970, Appleton was a sundown town: black people were not allowed to stay overnight, and none lived within its city limits by 1930. In 1936, the Institute of Paper Chemistry tried to hire the famous African-American chemist Percy Julian, but could not figure out how to do this without running afoul of what was stated as &quot;an arcane law on the City of Appleton&#x27;s books&quot;. A fight over Julian&#x27;s employment ensued, and he was hired by Glidden in Chicago instead. Appleton&#x27;s sundown status was largely de facto and not de jure; it stood by unwritten consensus and enforcement, such as by police strongly encouraging black people to leave town after dark. A partial exception was made for opera singer Marian Anderson when she sang at Lawrence University in 1941; she was allowed to stay overnight in the Conway Hotel, but even then was not allowed to eat dinner in public.

Following the Flint water crisis, a report of Wisconsin Rust Belt cities showed high levels of lead contamination in the water of Appleton, with children under the age of 1 testing positive for lead. With a state average of 1.9 per 100 for this age group, Appleton tested at 4.5 per 100 for the same age group.

Being inland from Lake Michigan, Appleton is prone to temperature extremes. The hottest temperature recorded was during the 1936 Dust Bowl and the coldest was in 1929. The coldest maximum on record is set in 1994 and the warmest minimum being in 1912.

In 1852 Charley Lindemann immigrated to the area and began a settlement among the Native American Menominee and Potawatomi tribes. His wife named the community after her home town of Kiel, Germany. Two years later, Col. Henry F. Belitz, later nicknamed the &quot;Father of Kiel&quot;, built a hotel and mill along the north side of the Sheboygan River. A road was built across Wisconsin to connect Green Bay with Milwaukee area communities. The bridge was built across the Sheboygan River in 1858 connecting Kiel with Sheboygan. In the late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, Kiel became a manufacturing area with businesses specializing in brick, wood shoes, machine, and furniture manufacturing.

A book called &quot;Yellowbird&quot; written by Kielite Henry Goeres in the late 1800s recounts - in a blend of fact and fiction - the early history of the settlement in the 1850s when European settlers interacted with Native Americans in the area.

Kiel was incorporated as a village in 1892 and later incorporated as a city. The city continues to retain a diverse manufacturing and commercial base.

In 2022, a Title IX investigation was opened into three students at Kiel Middle School for sexual harassment. The students allegedly refused to use a fellow student&#x27;s preferred gender pronouns. A series of bomb threats against the school district were made in the days following the investigation, forcing the district to evacuate the schools on May 23 and to cancel classes on May 24. On May 26 the school district announced that the remainder of the school year would be conducted virtually. The city government cancelled the city&#x27;s Memorial Day parade on the same day. As of June 3, the investigations had been closed by the district, and attorneys were looking to clear the students&#x27; records.

== Community life ==
Each year in August, Kiel holds the Kiel Community Picnic or &quot;Kiel Picnic&quot; in City Park. At present, the Kiel Picnic runs for four days from a Thursday through a Sunday. The Kiel Parade is held on Fremont Street on the Sunday of the Kiel Picnic. Traditionally, the firing of a cannon announced the start of the picnic. Each year in February, Kiel holds its Ice Sculpting Contest on Fremont Street. Sponsored teams compete for prizes. Kiel has a significant amount of German heritage, and each June, the city holds &quot;German Days&quot; in City Park.

The Kiel Municipal Band, a community marching band, traces its origins to the late 1800s. The band is known for its signature tune &quot;Invincible Fidelity&quot;. The city has several public parks and walking trails. The Solomon Biking Trail is a biking trail that runs between Kiel and the nearby city of New Holstein.

<text>Eau Claire ( ; lit. &quot;clear water&quot;) is a city in Eau Claire and Chippewa counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It is the seat of Eau Claire County. It had a population of 69,421 in 2020, making it the state&#x27;s eighth-most populous city. It is the principal city of the Eau Claire metropolitan area, known locally as the Chippewa Valley, which had 172,007 residents in 2020.

Eau Claire is at the confluence of the Eau Claire and Chippewa rivers on traditional Ojibwe, Dakota, and Ho-Chunk land. The area&#x27;s first permanent European American settlers arrived in 1845, and Eau Claire was incorporated as a city in 1872. The city&#x27;s early growth came from its extensive logging and timber industries. After Eau Claire&#x27;s lumber industry declined in the early 20th century, the city&#x27;s economy diversified to encompass manufacturing and Eau Claire became an educational center with the opening of the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire in 1916. Eau Claire is also a regional commercial and business center and home to the headquarters of home improvement store chain Menards.

Eau Claire is known regionally for its arts and music scenes and is the hometown of indie folk band Bon Iver, whose lead singer Justin Vernon co-curated the city&#x27;s annual Eaux Claires Music &amp; Arts Festival. Eau Claire is the second fastest-growing major city in Wisconsin after Madison, with 5.4% population growth between 2010 and 2020.

==Etymology==
Eau Claire took its name from Eau Claire County. &quot;Eau Claire&quot; is the singular form of the original French name, &quot;Eaux Claires&quot;, meaning &quot;Clear Waters&quot;, for the Eau Claire River. According to local legend, the river was so named because early French explorers journeying down the rain-muddied Chippewa River, came upon the confluence with the Eau Claire River, and excitedly exclaimed &quot;Voici l&#x27;eau claire!&quot; (&quot;Here is the clear water!&quot;). Now the city motto, this appears on the city seal.


== History ==

The Eau Claire area was first visited by Europeans in the late 17th century. It had been occupied for thousands of years before European fur traders began settling there for trade with local Native American tribes.

The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien, signed in 1825, established the Chippewa River &quot;half a day&#x27;s march below the falls&quot; as the boundary between the Sioux and Chippewa, and the &quot;Clear Water River, a branch of the Chippewa&quot; as the boundary between the Chippewa and Winnebago.

The first permanent European-American settlers arrived in 1845, and the city was officially incorporated in 1872. Extensive timber was harvested and logging was the major industry during this time; many sawmills were built as part of the lumber industry. Sawmills and other manufacturing made Eau Claire an industrial city by the late 19th century.

The city was founded near the confluence of the Eau Claire and Chippewa rivers as three separate settlements. The main section of downtown is on the site of the original European-American village, where Stephen McCann, in partnership with J. C. Thomas, put up three buildings in 1845. Although these structures were erected primarily to establish a claim to the land site, the McCann family moved into one of them and became the first permanent settlers.

West Eau Claire, founded in 1856, was across the river, near the site of the current county courthouse, and was incorporated in 1872. Between a mile and a half and two miles downstream, the Daniel Shaw &amp; Co. lumber company founded Shawtown, beyond the west end of what is now the Water Street historic district. Shawtown was annexed to the city of Eau Claire by the 1930s. By the 1950s, the entire city had spread far enough to the east to adjoin Altoona.
In 1916, the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire was founded, which marked the turn from a mostly lumber production based economy into one centered around manufacturing, education, and healthcare.

In 1917, Gillette Safety Tire Company built a large factory in Eau Claire along the Eau Claire River less than a mile where the rivers meet. The factory mainly created rubber tires and tubing. It had about 1,600 workers in 1920, producing almost 500 tires and 500 rubber tubing everyday. These numbers have increased every year since it opened in 1917. In 1931, United States Rubber Company agreed to purchase Gillette, a sale not completed until 1940 owing to the Great Depression. Due to the start of World War II, the US War Department brought the facility in 1942 to use as an ammunition plant. At the height of the war effort, the plant had over 6,000 employees. Toward the end of the war, the government sold the building back to its original owners, and it was quickly converted back to manufacturing tire products. Throughout the decades after the war, the plant received multiple expansions and was renamed Uniroyal in 1967.

In 1991, Uniroyal, one of the largest factories in Eau Claire at the time, announced it would shutter the facility, ultimately causing 1,358 workers to lose their jobs. Although this factory shutdown was detrimental to Eau Claire&#x27;s economy, the unemployment rate fell from 1991 to 1992. Today the complex, now named Banbury Place, is used as a small business incubator and leased to existing businesses and organizations.

==Government==
In November 1909 a movement to change the city government from the aldermanic to the commission form was launched by the West Side Boosters, the forerunners of the Water Street, Eau Claire Business Men. The campaign that preceded the February 15 election was heated. Local rallies and mass meetings were held. The 20 members of the common council were about equally split about the change. The final vote was 1,867 for change and 995 against.

Since switching from a mayoral system in 1948, Eau Claire has had a city manager-city council form of government. The city council is a nonpartisan 11-member governing council consisting of five members elected from aldermanic districts in odd-numbered years, five members elected at large in even-numbered years, and an elected city council president, elected at large in odd-numbered years.

The council&#x27;s legislative meetings are held on the second and fourth Tuesday of each month. Public hearings are held on the Monday evenings before legislative sessions. All meetings are held in the City Council Chambers at City Hall in downtown Eau Claire. Meetings are televised live on public-access television channel 97 and digital cable channel 994 and simulcast on radio station WRFP 101.9 FM.

Eau Claire is represented by Derrick Van Orden in the United States House of Representatives, and by Ron Johnson and Tammy Baldwin in the United States Senate. Jeff Smith represents Eau Claire in the Wisconsin Senate, and Jodi Emerson and Christian Phelps in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

There are 13 elementary schools and three middle schools in the Eau Claire Area School District. In addition, there is the Chippewa Valley Montessori Charter School, which follows the teaching of Maria Montessori. Eau Claire also has two private high schools: Regis High School and Immanuel Lutheran High School.

In 1872, the Wisconsin Central Railroad cleared its right of way through the forest which would become Abbotsford, heading north for Ashland. Rails were built through the town site in 1874.

However, they found that Colby Hill was not a good site for a junction and rail yard, so they instead planned the east–west line 2.5 miles north of Colby. The place was called Colby Junction from 1879 to 1880, then renamed for Edwin H. Abbott of the Wisconsin Central.

<text>Cambridge is a village in Dane (mostly) and Jefferson counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 1,638 at the 2020 census. Of this, 1,539 were in Dane County, and 99 were in Jefferson County.

== History ==

===Settlement–1890 ===
The settlement of Cambridge dates back to October 15, 1847, when the farmer Joseph Keyes filed plans with the Register of Deeds of Dane County. The first structure in the area was a dam on the northern part of Koshkonong Creek. By the late 1880s, Cambridge had grown into a community of about 700 people with shops, hotels, and a post office. Future inventor Ole Evinrude lived there. In 1890 a devastating fire broke out, destroying most of the businesses and parts of Main Street.

===1900s–2000s===
The town was rebuilt by 1910, following the fire, and the invention of the automobile ignited tourism. Nearby Lake Ripley became a destination for many Chicago travelers.

<doc id="151304" wikidata="Q1569885" url="?curid=151304" title="Edgerton, Wisconsin">
<text>Edgerton is a city in Rock and Dane counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 5,945 at the 2020 census. Of this, 5,799 were in Rock County, and 146 were in Dane County. Known locally as &quot;Tobacco City U.S.A.&quot; because of the importance of tobacco growing in the region, Edgerton continues to be a center for the declining tobacco industry in the area.

==History==
Originally called Fulton Station, Edgerton was named after a 19th-century businessman, Elisha W. Edgerton, or his brother Benjamin Hyde Edgerton, a civil engineer.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Edgerton was the center of the tobacco industry in southern Wisconsin. At one time, there were as many as 52 tobacco warehouses dotting the streets of the city. Queen Anne style mansions along Edgerton&#x27;s Washington Street testify to the wealth and prominence some merchants once had. The 1890s Carlton Hotel, once located on Henry Street, also once served as an additional reminder of the tobacco industry&#x27;s influence. Although built by a brewing firm, the hotel (which burned to the ground in the 1990s) was frequented by tobacco buyers and sellers.
===Edgerton Bible case===
In 1886, Catholic parents in Edgerton protested the reading of the King James Bible in the village schools because they considered the Douay version the correct translation. The school board argued that Catholic children could ignore the Bible readings or sit in the cloakroom while the rest of the children listened to the reading of a Protestant version of the Bible. Because the school board refused to change its policy, several families brought suit on the grounds that the schools&#x27; practice conflicted with the Wisconsin Constitution, which forbade sectarian instruction in public schools.

The circuit court rejected their argument, deciding in 1888 that the readings were not sectarian because both translations were of the same work. The parents appealed their case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, which overruled the circuit court on March 18, 1890, concluding that reading the Bible did—in fact—constitute sectarian instruction and thus illegally united the functions of church and state.

Seventy years later, when the U.S. Supreme Court banned prayer from the public schools in 1963, the Edgerton Bible case was one of the precedents cited by Justice William Brennan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. None of the area is covered with water, except for Saunders Creek, although the city is within a five-minute drive of Lake Koshkonong.
Lake Koshkonong is the third largest lake in Wisconsin, and though very shallow, provides a place for water sports. Skiing, tubing, and fishing are common activities on the lake or the Rock River, which feeds it. The Rock River runs all the way to the Mississippi.

==Arts and culture==

===Annual cultural events===
Because Edgerton was once the center of the tobacco growing region in Wisconsin, the community&#x27;s annual celebration is called Tobacco Days. The community celebration includes live music, food, family entertainment, a craft fair, an open-air market, living history events and demonstrations, tobacco demonstrations, citywide rummage sales, a men&#x27;s slow pitch softball tournament, book sales, a parade, and a car show.

The Sterling North Book and Film Festival, which takes place annually the last weekend in September, brings together authors and filmmakers with the community.

===Tourism===
The Sterling North Home and Museum is the childhood home of authors Sterling North and Jessica Nelson North MacDonald. North&#x27;s most famous book, &quot;Rascal&quot;, was set in Edgerton and he used the town as the setting for several of his books, referring to it as &quot;Brailsford Junction&quot;.

The Pomeroy and Pelton Tobacco Warehouse, known as the T. W. Dickinson &amp; Son Tobacco Warehouse after it was purchased by Weetman Dickinson, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the oldest free-standing brick warehouse in Wisconsin.

Edgerton is also known for its association with Pauline Jacobus. Jacobus and her husband, Oscar Jacobus, were responsible for the first artistic pottery created in Chicago in the mid-1880s. By 1888, the couple had moved their business to Edgerton. Although Oscar&#x27;s death and an economic depression disrupted the business in the 1890s, Pauline Jacobus continued making pottery in Edgerton until a fire in the early 1900s that destroyed her rural Edgerton home, &quot;The Bogart&quot;. Much admired and sought-after as an American art form, &quot;Pauline Pottery&quot; is recognized in antique and art galleries throughout the world. A log cabin from the old Bogart site and the factory warehouse where Pauline Pottery was first made in Edgerton still survive.

<text>Blanchardville is a village in Iowa and Lafayette counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 825 at the 2010 census. Of this, 648 were in Lafayette County, and 177 were in Iowa County.

==History==
The community was originally settled by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) in the early 1840s, who named it Zarahemla. The Mormon settlers mined lead ore and farmed. Blanchardville&#x27;s first mill was built in 1840.

In 1856, Alvin Blanchard moved to the area from his farm near Dodgeville. He purchased the mill on the Pecatonica river from the Mormons, who mostly left the area. Along with Cyrus Newkirk, he platted the village which currently bears his name in 1857. The village received its first post office the next year. The Yankee settlers established a Methodist church in 1852. A Norwegian Lutheran congregation shared the church from 1864 until 1892 when their own separate church was built. The village&#x27;s most prominent ethnic group is the Norwegians, as the village is between the large historic Blue Mounds and Wiota Norwegian settlements. Yankee, Irish, Swiss, and German settlers were in the village also and in 1898 the first Catholic church was built. Nearby rural churches in the area included Norwegian Lutheran congregations in York, Yellowstone, and Adams townships, and an Irish Catholic congregation in Yellowstone as well.

The village&#x27;s main park, McKellar Park, was given to the village in 1930 by the wife of the most prominent village doctor, Dr. Archibald McKellar, after his death. Today the park is host to many activities including an annual car show and Fathers&#x27; Day Barbeque. The school district is Pecatonica Area Schools, formed after combining with the neighboring village of Hollandale in 1971. The school mascot is the Viking, in tribute to the strength of a Norwegian Heritage.

<text>Bayside is a village in Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. The population was 4,482 at the 2020 census. Of this, 4,378 were in Milwaukee County, and only 104 were in Ozaukee County.

==Geography==
Bayside is located at (43.180275, -87.904735).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land. Lake Michigan borders the eastern edge of Bayside. Most of the village is in Milwaukee County, but a small portion at the end of Lake Drive bordering Fish Creek is in Ozaukee County.

==History==
The land that became Bayside was originally inhabited by Native Americans, who surrendered their land to the United States Federal Government in the 1830s. However, it is possible that the Potawatomi Chief Waubeka maintained a summer camp in Bayside and a winter camp in the Ozaukee County community that bears his name as late as 1845.

In the 19th century, the community was part of the Town of Milwaukee, and most of the land was used for logging and then farming by the early Dutch-American settlers.

In 1885, the Uihlein family, which owned the Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company, began purchasing land in Bayside, which became Nine Mile Farm, where the company bred draft horses for the brewery. The Uihlein family also kept chickens and cows on the property, and began reforesting the area around 1910. In 1969, the Schlitz Foundation considered getting rid of the land, which caused a debate in Bayside over whether it should become a public space or private developments. In 1971, the foundation donated the land to the National Audubon Society to create a nature center, which today is the 185-acre Schlitz Audubon Nature Center.

In the 1890s and early 20th century, prominent Milwaukeeans, including Jacob Donges and Frederick Usinger, began to construct summer homes in the &quot;Fairy Chasm&quot; community near Lake Michigan. The Fish Creek Park Company, organized in 1892, was one group that built vacation homes in Ozaukee County portion of what would become Bayside.

Bayside grew rapidly during the post-war suburbanization and economic prosperity. Many of the homes in the village were constructed between 1950 and 1980. The village incorporated on February 13, 1953, to prevent annexation by the City of Milwaukee, as happened to other communities in the county, including the Town of Milwaukee and the Town of Granville. In 1955, some of the residents of the Fairy Chasm community in Ozaukee County petitioned to join Bayside. The southern part joined the village, while the northern portion became part of the City of Mequon.

==Education==
Two public primary school districts serve Bayside. The Fox Point-Bayside School District serves the eastern part of the village, where students attend Stormonth Elementary and Bayside Middle Schools. The western part of the village is served by the Maple Dale-Indian Hill School District, where students attend Indian Hill Elementary and Maple Dale Middle Schools. Nicolet High School in Glendale serves all students residing in Bayside.

The village of Bayside is served by its own police department but contracts out its fire fighting and EMS services to the North Shore Fire Department.

<text>St Ives (, meaning &quot;St Ia&#x27;s cove&quot;) is a seaside town, civil parish and port in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. The town lies north of Penzance and west of Camborne on the coast of the Celtic Sea. In former times, it was commercially dependent on fishing. The decline in fishing, however, caused a shift in commercial emphasis, and the town is now primarily a popular seaside resort, notably achieving the title of Best UK Seaside Town from the British Travel Awards in both 2010 and 2011. St Ives was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1639. St Ives has become renowned for its number of artists. It was named best seaside town of 2007 by &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper.

==History==

===Early history===

The origin of St Ives is attributed in legend to the arrival of the Irish saint Ia of Cornwall, in the 5th century. The parish church bears her name, and the name St Ives derives from it.

The Sloop Inn, which lies on the wharf was a fisherman&#x27;s pub for many centuries and is dated to &quot;circa 1312&quot;, making it one of the oldest inns in Cornwall. The town was the site of a particularly notable atrocity during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. The English provost marshal, Anthony Kingston, came to St Ives and invited the portreeve, John Payne, to lunch at an inn. He asked the portreeve to have the gallows erected during the course of the lunch. Afterwards the portreeve and the Provost Marshal walked down to the gallows; the Provost Marshal then ordered the portreeve to mount the gallows. The portreeve was then hanged for being a &quot;busy rebel&quot;.

The seal of St Ives is &quot;Argent, an ivy branch overspreading the whole field Vert&quot;, with the legend &quot;Sigillum Burgi St Ives in Com. Cornub. 1690&quot;.

During the Spanish Armada of 1597, two Spanish ships, a bark and a pinnace, had made their way to St Ives to seek shelter from the storm which had dispersed the Spanish fleet. They were captured by the English warship &quot;Warspite&quot; of Sir Walter Raleigh leaking from the same storm. The information given by the prisoners was vital to learning the Armada&#x27;s objectives.

===Later history===
Pedn Olva Mine, a former copper mine, at Pedn Olva Point adit, operated in St Ives before 1911, when the engine house on Pedn Olva Point was demolished, now the site of the Pedn Olva Hotel.

The modern seaside resort developed as a result of the arrival of the St Ives Bay branch line from St Erth, part of the Great Western Railway in 1877. With it came a new generation of Victorian seaside holidaymakers. Much of the town was built during the latter part of the 19th century. The railway, which winds along the cliffs and bays, survived the Beeching cuts and has become a tourist attraction itself.

In 1952, the Royal Navy warship ran aground near the town. The ship was later salvaged, repaired and returned to service. A propeller believed to be from HMS &quot;Wave&quot; was washed ashore in 2008.

In 1999, the town was the first landfall of the solar eclipse of 11 August 1999. The Tate St Ives displayed an exhibition called &quot;As Dark as Light&quot;, with art by Yuko Shiraishi, Garry Fabian Miller and local schoolchildren, to celebrate the event. A live BBC programme with the astronomer Patrick Moore was clouded out and the eclipse was missed.

===Fishing===

From medieval times fishing was important at St Ives; it was one of the most important fishing ports on the north Cornish coast. The original pier&#x27;s construction date is unknown but the first reference to St Ives having a pier was in 1478 in William Worcester&#x27;s &#x27;Itinerary&#x27;. The pier was re-built by John Smeaton between 1766 and 1770 after falling into disrepair. It was lengthened at a later date. The octagonal lookout with a cupola belongs to Smeaton&#x27;s design.

A. K. Hamilton Jenkin describes how the St Ives fisherman strictly observed Sunday as a day of rest. St Ives was a very busy fishing port and seining was the usual method of fishing. Seining was carried out by a set of three boats of different sizes, the largest two carrying seine nets of different sizes. The total number of crew was seventeen or eighteen. However this came to an end in 1924. In the decade 1747–1756 the total number of pilchards dispatched from the four principal Cornish ports of Falmouth, Fowey, Penzance, and St Ives averaged 30,000 hogsheads annually (making a total of 900 million fish). Much greater catches were achieved in 1790 and 1796. In 1847 the exports of pilchards from Cornwall amounted to 40,883 hogsheads or 122 million fish while the greatest number ever taken in one seine was 5,600 hogsheads at St Ives in 1868. The bulk of the catch was exported to Italy: for example, in 1830, 6,400 hogsheads were sent to Mediterranean ports. From 1829 to 1838, the yearly average for this trade was 9,000 hogsheads.

While commercial fishing is much reduced, the harbour is still in use, often for recreational boating, tourist fishing and day trips to the nearby seal colonies on the Carrack Rocks and other locations along the coast. Recently, a class of Victorian fishing boat unique to St Ives, known as a &quot;jumbo,&quot; has been replicated by boatbuilder Jonny Nance to celebrate the town&#x27;s maritime heritage. Today&#x27;s jumbos are operated by the St Ives Jumbo Association.

===Lifeboat===
The first lifeboat was stationed in the town in 1840. In 1867 the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) built a boathouse at Porthgwidden beach. It proved to be a difficult site to launch from, and in 1867 it was replaced by a building in Fore Street. In 1911 a new boathouse was built on the Quay, and then in 1993 a larger station was built at the landward end of the West Pier. Since its inception in 1839, thirty eight RNLI medals have been awarded to rescuers from St Ives, 18 silver medals and 20 bronze.

Seven crewmen died in the St Ives lifeboat tragedy of 1939. In the early hours of 23 January 1939 there was a Force 10 storm blowing with gusts up to . The lifeboat &quot;John and Sara Eliza Stych&quot; was launched at 3 o&#x27;clock to search for a ship reported in trouble off Cape Cornwall. It rounded the Island where it met the full force of the storm as it headed westwards. It capsized three times and drifted across St Ives Bay when its propeller was fouled. The first time it turned over four men were lost; the second time one more; the third time left only one man alive. He scrambled ashore when the boat was wrecked on rocks near Godrevy Point.

===Sharks===
On 28 July 2007 there was a suspected sighting of a great white shark. The chairman of the Shark Trust said that &quot;it was impossible to make a conclusive identification and that it could have also been either a Mako or a Porbeagle shark&quot;. Coastguards dismissed the claims as &quot;scaremongering&quot;. On 14 June 2011 there was a suspected sighting of an oceanic whitetip shark; the Shark Trust said that the chances of the species being in British waters were &quot;very small&quot;. On 18 July 2017 a suspected blue shark was spotted close to the harbour. On 16 July 2018, another blue shark was spotted in the harbour, prompting the Shark Trust to ask people to &quot;give it plenty of space&quot;.

==Geography==

St Ives is on the western shore of St Ives Bay, its harbour sheltered by St Ives Island (a headland) and Smeaton&#x27;s pier. Close to the harbour, in the old part of the town, the streets are narrow and uneven while its wider streets are in the newer parts of the town on rising ground. The town has four beaches: Porthmeor a surfing beach, Porthgwidden a small sandy cove, Harbour by the working port and Porthminster which has almost half a mile of sand. St Ives has an oceanic climate and has some of the mildest winters and warmest summers in Britain and Northern Europe. It is therefore a popular tourist resort in the summer, and also benefits from an amount of sunshine per year that is above the national average. The South West Coast Path passes through the town.

==Tourism==

St Ives has been a popular tourist destination since the St Ives Bay Line opened in 1877, allowing visitors to easily get to the town. St Ives has been named the best UK seaside town by The Guardian in 2007, and by the British Travel Awards in 2010 and 2011. In 2020, St Ives was named the most expensive seaside resort in the UK. The town has the second highest visitor-related spend in the UK, with tourists spending £85 million per year. Around 540,000 day trippers and 220,000 staying tourists visit St Ives every year, with the tourism industry accounting for around 2,800 jobs in the area.

Like in the rest of Cornwall, tourism has been criticised for bringing about problems in seasonal work and affordable housing in St Ives. In 2016, St Ives residents voted to ban second-home owners from buying new build housing, with 83% in favour. This came after average house prices in the town had been pushed up to over £320,000, almost 14 times the median annual earnings of someone in Cornwall. In 2019, the Financial Times reported that average house price was £351,800, saying that the new build policy had failed to stem the number of second homes. St Ives also faces a shortage of rentals; in 2021, while there were over 1,000 properties in the town available for short-term holiday let, there was only one long-term house available to rent.

==Politics and administration==
St Ives&#x27; local government administration has a two-tier structure, consisting of St Ives Town Council and Cornwall Council, both elected statutory bodies.

===St Ives Town Council===

The first tier of local government in St Ives is the Town Council, with a membership of 16 elected town councillors from three wards. The council is responsible for providing grant funding to local organisations, public footpaths, bus shelters, beach patrols, traffic control and allotments. It is a statutory body which is consulted regarding planning decisions in the town&#x27;s area and makes recommendations to the planning authority, Cornwall Council. It is based at St Ives Guildhall.

Before 1974, St Ives Borough Council was the principal local authority for what now forms the civil parish of St Ives. Since the reform of local government in 1974, St Ives has an elected town council. The area overseen by the Town Council of St Ives includes Lelant, Carbis Bay, Halsetown and St Ives. The elected town council members also become charter trustees of the original borough charter (for the duration of their term in office) which dates back to 1639 entitling them to carry out various ceremonial functions such as appointing a Mayor, awarding freedom of the borough to individuals, representing the Borough at formal occasions such as Remembrance Sunday wearing formal ceremonial robes and using the Coat of Arms. Typically, the Mayor of the Town of St Ives is also the Mayor of the Borough of St Ives. However, most of the other principal local authority functions for St Ives were undertaken by Penwith District Council and the Cornwall County Council. From 1 April 2009 Penwith and the other five Cornish district councils were replaced by a unified council, Cornwall Council.

===Cornwall Council===
Like St Ives Town Council, Cornwall Council is a statutory body incorporated by Act of Parliament. Cornwall Council is the second tier of local government in the area and is a unitary authority with a far wider range of powers. The Council deals with roads, street lighting, highways, social services, children and family care, schools and public libraries. From 2009 to 2021, St Ives parish was covered by three divisions, so electing three of the 123 councillors on the council. Between 2009 and 2013, the parish was represented by the St Ives North, St Ives South and Lelant and Carbis Bay. From 2013 to 2021, it was covered by the St Ives East, St Ives West and Lelant and Carbis Bay divisions.

At the 2021 local elections, the number of councillors on Cornwall Council was decreased from 123 to 87. St Ives parish is currently covered by two of these divisions, St Ives West and Towednack and St Ives East, Lelant and Carbis Bay. Both divisions elect one councillor.

==Religion==
 St Ia&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Ia of Cornwall, an Irish holy woman of the 5th or 6th century, and St Andrew, the patron saint of fishermen. In 1408 the townsmen attempted to get a papal bull to authorise the consecration of their church and cemetery, but they did not achieve this, so they continued without the rights of baptism or burial. However, they undertook the building of the present church between 1410 and 1434 as a chapel of ease, St Ives being within the parish of Lelant. They were able to obtain the right to a font in 1428 but consecration of the cemetery only in 1542. For over a century the vicars of Lelant had resisted demands from the inhabitants of St Ives and Towednack for the right of sepulture but in 1542 the right was granted so the vicars transferred their residence to St Ives and abandoned the vicarage of Lelant. There was damage to the church in 1697 when a storm broke through the sea-wall and damaged the roof and a large window over the altar.

There are chapels dedicated to St Nicholas on the headland of St Ives Island and St Leonard on the quay which were used by the fishermen and have been converted for other uses. The former chapel of St Nicholas was partially demolished by the War Office in 1904 but rebuilt in 1909, possibly by E. H. Sedding, from the old materials. It is plain and rectangular and has since been converted into the New Gallery.

The Roman Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart and St Ia was built in 1909 to a design by A J C Scoles. There are also two Methodist chapels, one in Fore Street of 1831, and another of 1845 higher up the valley, and a Congregational chapel of 1800.

==Culture==
===Art===

J. M. W. Turner arrived in St Ives in 1811. In 1884, James Whistler and Walter Sickert visited on the improved railway. Bernard Leach and Shōji Hamada set up the Leach Pottery in 1920. Leach, who was a studio potter and art teacher and is known as the &quot;Father of British studio pottery&quot;, learned pottery under the direction of Shigekichi Urano (Kenzan VI) in Japan where he also met Shōji Hamada. They promoted pottery from the point of view of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. Leach produced work until 1972, and the Victoria and Albert Museum held an exhibition of his work in 1977. The Leach Pottery remains operational and houses a small museum showcasing work by Leach and his students.

In 1928, the Cornish artist Alfred Wallis and Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood met at St Ives and laid the foundation for the St Ives School artists&#x27; colony there. In 1939, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo settled in St Ives, attracted by its beauty. In 1993, a branch of the Tate Gallery, the Tate St Ives, opened. The Tate has owned the Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden since 1980, as well as her Palais de Danse studio since 2015. The town attracted artists from overseas such as Maurice Sumray who moved from London in 1968, and Piet Mondrian, and continues to do so today with younger artists such as Michael Polat, who took up residence there from his native Germany in 1999.

Before the 1940s, most artists in St Ives and West Cornwall belonged to the St Ives Society of Artists, but events in the late 1940s led to a dispute between the abstract and figurative artists in the group. In 1948, the abstract faction broke away to form the Penwith Society of Artists led by Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson.

In 1962 Frederick Spratt took a sabbatical in Britain for one year, where he lived and painted representationally in St Ives.

The studio pottery Troika was set up in 1963.

In 2010, a BBC Four film, &quot;The Art of Cornwall&quot;, presented by James Fox said that the St Ives artists &quot;went on to produce some of the most exhilarating art of the twentieth century...for a few dazzling years this place was as famous as Paris, as exciting as New York and infinitely more progressive than London.&quot; The programme explored the lives and works of the key figures and their contributions in establishing St Ives as a major centre of British art from the 1920s onwards.

===Museums===
The Barbara Hepworth Museum and her sculpture garden are the responsibility of Tate St Ives. It was the wish of the late sculptor to leave her work on public display in perpetuity. The St Ives Museum has exhibits illustrating local history and culture, including mining, fishing, agriculture and domestic life.

===Festivals===

John Knill, a former mayor, constructed the Knill Steeple, a granite monument overlooking the town. In 1797, Knill laid down instructions for the celebration of the Knill Ceremony, which was to take place every five years on 25 July (St James&#x27;s Day). The ceremony involves the Mayor of St Ives, a customs officer, and a vicar accompanied by two widows and ten girls who should be the &quot;daughters of fishermen, tinners, or seamen&quot;. The ceremonies used to have athletic games, called the &quot;Knillian games&quot;, which included Cornish wrestling.

A second celebration, of perhaps greater antiquity, is St Ives Feast, a celebration of the founding of St Ives by St Ia, which takes place on the Sunday and Monday nearest to 3 February each year. It includes a civic procession to Venton Ia, the well of St Ia, and other associated activities. It is one of the two surviving examples of Cornish Hurling (in a gentler format than its other manifestation at St Columb Major).

A third festival is the St Ives May Day, a modern revival of West Cornwall May Day celebrations that were once common throughout west Cornwall.

The St Ives September Festival celebrated its 30th anniversary in September 2008. It is one of the longest running and widest ranging Festivals of the Arts in the UK lasting for fifteen days and includes music (folk, jazz, rock, classical &amp; world), poetry, film, talks and books. It was founded in 1978 as a joint venture by local entrepreneurs and the International Musicians Seminar. Many local artists open up their studios to allow visitors to see how their art is produced. There is free music in many pubs almost every night, and concerts. Many events are held at the Western Hotel or St Ives Guildhall. St Ives has a 500-seat theatre which hosts some of the festival events.

===Literature and popular culture===

Early-20th-century figures in St Ives appear in Virginia Woolf&#x27;s reflections contained in &quot;A Sketch of the Past&quot;, from &quot;Moments of Being,&quot; &quot;... I could fill pages remembering one thing after another. All together made the summer at St. Ives the best beginning to life imaginable. Her 1927 novel &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot; is said to have been influenced by the view from Talland House where she stayed with her parents on family holidays.

This St Ives is generally believed to be the one referred to in the famous nursery rhyme &quot;As I was going to St Ives&quot;.

The Cornish language poet Mick Paynter is resident in St Ives.

Modern-day novelist Elizabeth Day, author of &quot;The Party,&quot; writes many of her novels whilst staying in St Andrews Street in St Ives.

The &quot;Ulysses Moore&quot; series of books, written by Pierdomenico Baccalario are based in the hypothetical village of Kilmore Cove near Zennor and St Ives.

Helen Dunmore&#x27;s novel &quot;Zennor in Darkness&quot; is set locally, at the time of the First World War, when D. H. Lawrence and his German wife came to Cornwall to escape the war in London.

The St Ives Literature Festival is an annual week-long event, started in 2008, in May. Open air performances are held in Norway Square and the St Ives Arts Club, as well as talks, workshops and live music.

===Film and TV===
In 1978/1979 the town, the pub The Sloop Inn and Barnoon Cemetery were filmed and appeared in Jerry Jameson&#x27;s film &quot;Raise the Titanic&quot; released in 1980. The final scenes with Alec Guinness were meant to have occurred in a local church but a unusually strong storm a few days earlier had damaged the building rendering it unsuitable for filming.

In 1989, a public television crew from Alaska shot scenes for a docudrama about American artist Sydney Mortimer Laurence (1865-1940), who was a member of the St. Ives Arts Club in the late 19th century. Several St. Ives residents, in period costumes, appeared as extras in the production. &quot;Laurence of Alaska,&quot; which won two regional Emmy Awards, was produced by KAKM, Alaska Public Television, and later aired on public stations across the U.S.

The Discovery Travel and Living programme &quot;Beach Café&quot;, featuring Australian chef Michael Smith, was filmed in St Ives.

===Local media===
Regional TV news is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from either the Redruth or Caradon Hill TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cornwall on 103.9 FM, Heart West on 107.0 FM, and Coast FM, a community radio station that broadcast to the town on 96.5 FM.

The St. Ives Times &amp; Echo is the town’s local weekly newspaper.

==Sport==

St Ives is the home of St Ives Rugby Football Club (founded 1889) who play at the Recreation Ground on Alexandra Road. Once one of the dominant clubs in Cornish rugby, they currently play in Tribute Western Counties West league, (tier 7 of the English rugby union system). There is also a football team, St Ives Town F.C., who play in the Cornwall Combination (division 12 of the English football system). Their ground is at Lelant Saltings.

===Cornish wrestling===
Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, were held in the following places over the last two centuries:
* The Knill mausoleum.
* Tregenna Park.
* The Drill field.
* The Moor field, The Belyars.

==Transport==
St Ives railway station is linked to the Paddington to Penzance main rail route via the St Ives branch line which runs frequent services from St Erth. The line was opened in 1877 by the St Ives branch railway, but became part of the Great Western Railway in 1878. Before 2019, the park &amp; ride facility for visitors to St Ives ran from Lelant Saltings railway station. The station had been opened on 27 May 1978 specifically for this purpose. After development works at St Erth station in 2019 to improve transport links, the park and ride was moved there. The branchline also links the St Ives to nearby Carbis Bay and Lelant.

The town also has regular services by National Express coaches from London Victoria Coach Station, Heathrow and other places in Britain. First Kernow buses also connect St Ives to nearby towns and villages, such as Zennor, Penzance and Truro.

The nearest airports to St Ives are Newquay and Land&#x27;s End Airport, near St Just. Private jets, charters and helicopters are served by Perranporth Airfield.

==Twinning==
St Ives is twinned with Camaret-sur-Mer () in Brittany, France and has friendship agreements with Laguna Beach, California and Mashiko, Tochigi, Japan.

In the Menominee language this place is known as &quot;Sakēmāēwataenoh&quot;, meaning &quot;mosquito place&quot;, likely due to its riverside location. The Menominee sold this land to the United States in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars, which saw over four million acres of land in Wisconsin sold after years of negotiation about how to accommodate the Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brothertown peoples who were being removed from New York to Wisconsin.

Following the treaty which made the land available for purchase, New London was established by European-American settlers in 1852 and was named after New London, Connecticut by Reeder Smith, a founder whose father was from there. Reeder Smith built the plank road between Appleton and Stevens Point. New London became a lumber center and the terminus of steamboats plying the Wolf River from Oshkosh.

<text>Frannie is a town in Big Horn and Park counties in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The population was 157 at the 2010 census.

In 1894, Frannie&#x27;s post office opened. Postmaster Morris, the town&#x27;s first postmaster, had a daughter named Frannie, and the town was named after her. Until 1954, the legal status of Frannie was that of an unincorporated area taking in parts of Big Horn and Park Counties. In 1954, the town was incorporated. Under Wyoming law (WS 15-3-101), Frannie now has the status of an incorporated town having less than 4,000 people.

The town has a mayor-council form of government in which the governing body comprises the mayor and the council, together. The governing body has authority over the budget, other fiscal matters, and other major issues affecting the town. The current mayor is
Steven Richardson, whose current term expires in 2026.

Frannie receives natural gas service from Frannie-Deaver Utilities, a privately held company in Frannie. Since 1955 the town has provided municipal (potable) water service. In 2000 the town installed a sanitary sewer system. The town contracts for its trash collection and fire-fighting services. Fire protection is provided by the Big Horn County Fire District #5 in Deaver, Wyoming. Police coverage is provided primarily by the Big Horn County Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

==Geography==
US Highway 310 (locally known as &quot;Ash St.&quot;) is the main road through the town. All but 19 of the town&#x27;s population is found east of US 310. The town is also located two miles south of the Montana border and is the northernmost town in Wyoming&#x27;s Bighorn Basin—a mountain desert region which relies on a network of canals and pipelines to provide irrigation and potable water for the population, farming, and ranching activities.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. The Town boundaries, at its eastern end, follow the Sage/Frannie Creek.

Among Wyoming towns Frannie has a unique geographic characteristic: it is the only town having boundaries which include parts of two counties—Big Horn (pop. 138) and Park (pop. 19). Accordingly, visitors to Frannie are greeted with a welcoming sign which includes the phrase &quot;Biggest Little Town In Wyoming.&quot; Locals say this designation is because &quot;it took two counties to hold our town!&quot; Included in the Park County portion of Frannie is the post office and two of the town&#x27;s three businesses. The Town Hall is located within the Big Horn County portion.

<doc id="151321" wikidata="Q314963" url="?curid=151321" title="Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly">
<text>Jules-Amédée Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly (2 November 1808 – 23 April 1889) was a French novelist, poet, short story writer, and literary critic. He specialised in mystery tales that explored hidden motivation and hinted at evil without being explicitly concerned with anything supernatural. He had a decisive influence on writers such as Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam, Henry James, Léon Bloy, Marcel Proust and Carmelo Bene.

==Biography==
Jules-Amédée Barbey — the d&#x27;Aurevilly was a later inheritance from a childless uncle — was born at Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte, Manche in Lower Normandy. In 1827 he went to the Collège Stanislas de Paris. After getting his baccalauréat in 1829, he went to Caen University to study law, taking his degree three years later. As a young man, he was a liberal and an atheist, and his early writings present religion as something that meddles in human affairs only to complicate and pervert matters. In the early 1840s, however, he began to frequent the Catholic and legitimist salon of Baronne Almaury de Maistre, niece of Joseph de Maistre. In 1846 he converted to Roman Catholicism.

His greatest successes as a literary writer date from 1852 onwards, when he became an influential literary critic at the Bonapartist paper &quot;Le Pays&quot;, helping to rehabilitate Balzac and effectually promoting Stendhal, Flaubert, and Baudelaire. Paul Bourget describes Barbey as an idealist, who sought and found in his work a refuge from the uncongenial ordinary world. Jules Lemaître, a less sympathetic critic, thought the extraordinary crimes of his heroes and heroines, his reactionary opinions, his dandyism and snobbery were a caricature of Byronism.

Beloved of fin-de-siècle decadents, Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly remains an example of the extremes of late romanticism. Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly held strong Catholic opinions, yet wrote about risqué subjects, a contradiction apparently more disturbing to the English than to the French themselves. Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly was also known for having constructed his own persona as a dandy, adopting an aristocratic style and hinting at a mysterious past, though his parentage was provincial bourgeois nobility, and his youth comparatively uneventful. Inspired by the character and ambience of Valognes, he set his works in the society of Normand aristocracy. Although he himself did not use the Norman patois, his example encouraged the revival of vernacular literature in his home region.

Jules-Amédée Barbey d&#x27;Aurevilly died in Paris and was buried in the cimetière du Montparnasse. During 1926 his remains were transferred to the churchyard in Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte.

==Quotations==
* &quot;Next to the wound, what women make best is the bandage.&quot;
* &quot;The mortal envelope of the Middle Age has disappeared, but the essential remains. Because the temporal disguise has fallen, the dupes of history and of its dates say that the Middle Age is dead. Does one die for changing his shirt?&quot;
* &quot;In France everybody is an aristocrat, for everybody aims to be distinguished from everybody. The red cap of the Jacobins is the red heel of the aristocrats at the other extremity, but it is the same distinctive sign. Only, as they hated each other, Jacobinism placed on its head what aristocracy placed under its foot.&quot; 
* &quot;In the matter of literary form it is the thing poured in the vase which makes the beauty of the vase, otherwise there is nothing more than a vessel.&quot; 
* &quot;Books must be set against books, as poisons against poisons.&quot;
* &quot;When superior men are mistaken they are superior in that as in all else. They see more falsely than small or mediocre minds.&quot; 
* &quot;The Orient and Greece recall to my mind the saying, so coloured and melancholic, of Richter: &#x27;Blue is the colour of mourning in the Orient. That is why the sky of Greece is so beautiful&#x27;.&quot; 
* &quot;Men give their measure by their admiration, and it is by their judgements that one may judge them.&quot;
* &quot;The most beautiful destiny: to have genius and be obscure.&quot;

<text>Jean Barbeyrac (; 15 March 1674 – 3 March 1744) was a French jurist and translator. A French Huguenot, he translated influential works by Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, Richard Cumberland and others into French.

==Life==
Born at Béziers in Lower Languedoc, he was the nephew of Charles Barbeyrac, a distinguished physician of Montpellier. He moved with his family into Switzerland after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes. After spending some time at Geneva and Frankfurt am Main, he became professor of &quot;belles-lettres&quot; in the French school of Berlin. Then, in 1711, he was called to the professorship of history and civil law at Lausanne, finally settling as professor of public law at Groningen.

==Works==
His fame rests chiefly on the preface and notes to his translation of Samuel Pufendorf&#x27;s treatise &quot;De Jure Naturae et Gentium&quot;, translated as &quot;Of the Law of Nature and Nations&quot;, 4th ed., 1729, London, by B. Kennett et al. Barbeyrac&#x27;s preface appears in this fourth edition with the title: &#x27;Containing an Historical and Critical Account of the Science of Morality, and the Progress It has Made in the World, From the Earliest Times Down to the Publication of This Work&#x27;. In the fundamental principles, he follows almost entirely John Locke and Pufendorf; but he works out with great skill the theory of moral obligation, referring it to the command or will of God. He indicates the distinction, developed more fully by Thomasius and Kant, between the legal and the moral qualities of action. The principles of international law he reduces to those of the law of nature, and in so doing opposes many of the positions taken up by Grotius. He rejects the notion that sovereignty in any way resembles property, and makes even marriage a matter of civil contract. Barbeyrac also translated Grotius&#x27;s &quot;De Jure Belli et Pacis&quot;, Cumberland&#x27;s &quot;De Legibus Naturae&quot;, and Pufendorf&#x27;s smaller treatise &quot;De Officio Hominis et Civis&quot;.

Among his own productions are a treatise, &quot;De la morale des pères&quot;, a history of ancient treaties, &quot;Histoire des anciens traitez&quot;, contained in the &quot;Supplement au Corps universel diplomatique du droit des gens&quot;, and the curious &quot;Traité du jeu&quot; (1709), in which he defends the morality of games of chance.

<text>Tate Liverpool is an art gallery in Liverpool, Merseyside, England, and part of Tate, along with Tate St Ives, Cornwall, Tate Britain, London, and Tate Modern, London. The gallery was an initiative of the Merseyside Development Corporation. Tate Liverpool was created to display work from the Tate Collection which comprises the national collection of British art from the year 1500 to the present day, and international modern art. The gallery also has a programme of temporary exhibitions. Until 2003, Tate Liverpool was the largest gallery of modern and contemporary art in the UK outside London.

==History==

Housed in a converted warehouse within the Albert Dock on Liverpool&#x27;s waterfront, the gallery was opened on 24 May 1988 by Prince Charles, an event covered by BBC Two television. The original conversion was done by James Stirling but the building was given a major refurbishment in 1998 to create additional gallery space.

In 2007, the foyer area was redesigned by architects Arca to create an updated appearance and better proportions, as well as to improve visitor handling. The gallery café was also redesigned by Peter Blake and Liverpool-based architects, Architectural Emporium. The centrepiece of the space is a new timber desk with an undulating orange fascia, which links to the retained colour scheme of the original conversion work by Stirling. A colour-changing wall acts as a backdrop to the simplified brick volume, visible from across Albert Dock. Behind the scenes, Arca also made alterations to the hospitality, cloakroom, events and education areas.

==Renovation==
The gallery closed in October 2023 for renovation work. Originally planned to take two years, it was announced in February 2025 that it was instead expected to reopen in spring 2027. Costing around £29.7 million, the works will see the galleries refurbished and the creation of new social spaces. During this period, the gallery has a temporary presence at RIBA North in Mann Island.

==Events ==
The gallery has played host to various events, including celebrations during the 2023 Eurovision Song Contest, performances as part of the Liverpool Biennial and Light Night and has hosted the Turner Prize awards ceremony twice, in 2007 and 2022.

<doc id="151325" wikidata="Q23100" url="?curid=151325" title="Merseyside">
<text>Merseyside ( ) is a ceremonial and metropolitan county in North West England. It borders Lancashire to the north, Greater Manchester to the east, Cheshire to the south, the Welsh county of Flintshire across the Dee Estuary to the southwest, and the Irish Sea to the west. The largest settlement is the city of Liverpool.

The county is highly urbanised, with an area of and a population of 1.42 million. After Liverpool (552,267), the largest settlements are Birkenhead (143,968), St Helens (102,629), and Southport (94,421). For local government purposes the county comprises five metropolitan boroughs: Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, and Liverpool. The borough councils collaborate through a combined authority called Liverpool City Region, which also includes the Cheshire borough of Halton.

What is now Merseyside was a largely rural area until the Industrial Revolution, when Liverpool and Birkenhead&#x27;s positions on the Mersey Estuary enabled them to expand. Liverpool became a major port, heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade and in supplying cotton to the mills of Lancashire, and Birkenhead developed into a centre for shipbuilding. Innovations during this period included the first inter-city railway, the first publicly-funded civic park, advances in dock technology, and a pioneering elevated electrical railway. The county was established in 1974, before which the entirety of the Wirral was in Cheshire and the remainder of the county was in Lancashire.

Merseyside is notable for its sport, music, and cultural institutions. The Merseybeat genre developed in what is now the county, which has also produced many artists and bands, including the Beatles. The county contains several football clubs, with Everton and Liverpool playing in the Premier League. The Royal Liverpool and Royal Birkdale golf clubs have hosted The Open Championship 22 times between them, and the Grand National is the most valuable jump race in Europe. National Museums Liverpool comprises nine museums and art galleries.

==History==

Merseyside was designated as a &quot;Special Review&quot; area in the Local Government Act 1958, and the Local Government Commission for England started a review of this area in 1962, based around the core county boroughs of Liverpool, Bootle, Birkenhead and Wallasey. Further areas, including Widnes and Runcorn, were added to the Special Review Area by Order in 1965. Draft proposals were published in 1965, but the commission never completed its final proposals as it was abolished in 1966.

Instead, a Royal Commission was set up to review English local government entirely, and its report (known as the Redcliffe-Maud Report) proposed a much wider Merseyside metropolitan area covering southwest Lancashire and northwest Cheshire, extending as far south as Chester and as far north as the River Ribble. This would have included four districts: Southport/Crosby, Liverpool/Bootle, St Helens/Widnes and Wirral/Chester. In 1970 the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (which operates today under the &quot;Merseytravel&quot; brand) was set up, covering Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral and Knowsley, but excluding Southport and St Helens.

The Redcliffe-Maud Report was rejected by the incoming Conservative government, but the concept of a two-tier metropolitan area based on the Mersey area was retained. A White Paper was published in 1971. The Local Government Bill presented to Parliament involved a substantial trimming from the White Paper, excluding the northern and southern fringes of the area, excluding Chester, Ellesmere Port, and, for the first time, including Southport, whose council had requested to be included. Further alterations took place in Parliament, with Skelmersdale being removed from the area, and a proposed district including St Helens and Huyton being subdivided into what are now the metropolitan boroughs of St Helens and Knowsley.

Merseyside was created on 1 April 1974 from areas previously part of the administrative counties of Lancashire and Cheshire, along with the county boroughs of Birkenhead, Wallasey, Liverpool, Bootle, and St Helens. Following the creation of Merseyside, Merseytravel expanded to take in St Helens and Southport.

Between 1974 and 1986 the county had a two-tier system of local government with the five boroughs sharing power with the Merseyside County Council. In 1986 the government of Margaret Thatcher abolished the county council along with all other metropolitan county councils, and so its boroughs are now effectively unitary authorities.

==Geography==
Merseyside is divided into two parts by the Mersey estuary; the Wirral is on the west side of the estuary, upon the Wirral Peninsula, and the rest of the county lies on the east side. The eastern part of Merseyside borders onto Lancashire to the north and Greater Manchester to the east, with both parts of the county bordering Cheshire to the south. The territory comprising the county of Merseyside previously formed part of the administrative counties of Lancashire (east of the River Mersey) and Cheshire (west of the River Mersey). The two parts are linked by the two Mersey Tunnels, the Wirral line of Merseyrail, and the Mersey Ferry.

===Green belt===

Merseyside contains green belt interspersed throughout the county, surrounding the Liverpool urban area, as well as across the Mersey in the Wirral area, with further pockets extending towards and surrounding Southport, as part of the western edge of the North West Green Belt. It was first drawn up from the 1950s. All the county&#x27;s districts contain some portion of belt.

Ipsos MORI polls in the boroughs of Sefton and Wirral in the 2000s showed that in general, residents of these boroughs identified slightly more strongly to Merseyside than to Lancashire or Cheshire respectively, but their affinity to Merseyside was more likely to be &quot;fairly strong&quot; than &quot;very strong&quot;.

==Local government==
===Metropolitan boroughs===
Merseyside comprises the metropolitan boroughs of Liverpool, Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens and Wirral.

===Combined authority===

The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority, which includes the five boroughs of Merseyside and the Borough of Halton in Cheshire, oversees functions given to it under the area&#x27;s devolution deal with the UK government, such as transport, housing, innovation, employment, energy, tourism, and trade, and some responsibilities relating to crime and justice. 

The combined authority is led by the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram, who was elected in 2017 and re-elected in 2021 and in 2024.

===County-level functions===
Following the abolition of the county council, some local services are run by joint-boards of the five metropolitan boroughs; these include the:

*Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner and Merseyside Police
*Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service
*Merseyside Recycling and Waste Authority
*Merseyside Pension Scheme, administered by Wirral Council, with offices in Liverpool

== Healthcare ==

The planning and commissioning of care within Merseyside is the responsibility of an integrated care system, NHS Cheshire and Merseyside, which covers NHS and other care services within the Cheshire and Merseyside areas. It also oversees Cheshire and Merseyside Health and Care Partnership. NHS Cheshire and Merseyside serves a combined population of 2.7 million .
==Economy==


== Transport ==
=== Road ===

Merseyside is served by six motorways: the M58 to the north, M56 to the south, M6 &amp; M62 to the east and M53 to the west. The M57 acts as an outer ring road and bypass for the city of Liverpool itself. The River Mersey is crossed by Queensway Tunnel and Kingsway Tunnel, which link Liverpool to Birkenhead and Wallasey respectively, and by the Silver Jubilee Bridge and Mersey Gateway Bridge, which link Runcorn and Widnes. The Mersey Gateway Bridge opened in 2017 and is designed to improve transport links between Widnes and Runcorn and other key locations in the vicinity.

National Cycle Route 56 and National Cycle Route 62 pass through the region, the former along the Wirral and the latter from Southport to Runcorn. Major bus companies are Stagecoach Merseyside and Arriva North West. Liverpool One bus station serves as a terminus for national coach travel.

=== Rail ===

Liverpool Lime Street mainline station is Merseyside&#x27;s primary intercity railway station, being used by 10.46 million passengers in 2021–22. Train services are provided by Avanti West Coast, London Northwestern Railway, TransPennine Express, West Midlands Trains, Transport for Wales and Northern, and serve destinations across the UK.

Merseyrail is the county&#x27;s urban rail system and is operated by Merseytravel, the combined passenger transport executive for the Liverpool City Region. The network has 66 stations on two lines; the Northern Line covers the centre of the county, and the Wirral Line covers the eponymous peninsula. The two lines meet in Liverpool City Centre, and Liverpool Central is the county&#x27;s most-used station, with 10.75 million passengers in 2021–22. The network extends to Ormskirk in Lancashire, and Ellesmere Port and Chester in Cheshire. Merseytravel brands the network in the east of the county as the &#x27;City Line&#x27;, but the services on it are not operated by Merseyrail. The Borderlands line connects the west of the Wirral to Wales, and is operated by Transport for Wales Rail.

=== Maritime ===
 
Liverpool Cruise Terminal provides facilities for long-distance passenger cruises. Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines and Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages use the terminal to depart to Iceland, France, Spain and Norway. Peel Ports have also planned a second cruise terminal as part of the Liverpool Waters project.

==== Ferries ====

Prince&#x27;s Landing Stage on Liverpool&#x27;s Pier Head serves Isle of Man Steam Packet Company summer service to the Isle of Man (and Mersey Ferries). The Twelve Quays ferry port in Birkenhead serves winter Isle of Man ferry service and Stena Line services to Belfast, Northern Ireland. Almost three quarters of a million people travel these Irish Sea ferry services.

The Mersey Ferry has operated since the 1200s, currently between Wirral and Liverpool City Centre at Seacombe, Woodside and Liverpool Pier Head. In 2009–2010 it had 684,000passengers using the service.

==== Commercial ====
The Port of Liverpool handles most commercial shipping, but the Birkenhead Docks complex in Great Float on the Wirral peninsula still handles some freight.

The Port of Liverpool is a container port that handles over 33milliontonnes of freight cargo per year, making it the fourth busiest port in the United Kingdom .
It serves more than 100 global destinations including Africa, Australia, China, India, the Middle East and South America. Imports include grain and animal feed, timber, steel, coal, cocoa, crude oil, edible oils and liquid chemicals; there are exports of scrap metal for recycling. A second container terminal, Liverpool2 at Seaforth, can handle Post-Panamax vessels and doubled the port&#x27;s capacity when it opened in 2016.

=== Air ===
Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the county&#x27;s international airport. It is in Speke, southeast of Liverpool city centre, with 5 million departures in 2020. Flights are primarily operated by easyJet and Ryanair, and over 70 destinations are served by the airport, including regular flights to the Near East and North Africa.

The airport is planning substantial expansion, and is forecast to handle more than 12million passengers by 2030, as well as targeting permanent direct long haul flights and significantly larger terminal facilities.

==Sport==

Merseyside is host to several football league football clubs including Everton, Liverpool and Tranmere Rovers and several non-league football clubs including Marine A.F.C. and Southport F.C. Golf courses include Royal Liverpool Golf Club, Royal Birkdale Golf Club, Hillside Golf Club and Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club. Cricket clubs include the historic Aigburth Cricket Ground. Aintree Motor Racing Circuit hosted the British Grand Prix biennially between 1955 and 1961, and finally in 1962. Aintree Racecourse hosts the Grand National and there is also Haydock Park Racecourse. Totally Wicked Stadium hosts Rugby League and Hoylake hosts sailing (such as the Southport 24 Hour Race) and is Britain&#x27;s premier location for sand yachting. A ski slope facility is found at The Oval (Wirral).

<text>Theodore Leopold Friedman (June 6, 1890 – August 25, 1971), known as Ted Lewis, was an American entertainer, bandleader, singer, and musician. He fronted a band and touring stage show that presented a combination of jazz, comedy, and nostalgia that was a hit with the American public before and after World War II. He was known by the moniker &quot;Mr. Entertainment&quot; or Ted &quot;Is Everybody Happy?&quot; Lewis. He died of lung failure in August 1971.

==Early life==

Lewis was born in Circleville, Ohio, to Pauline and Benjamin Friedman. His father ran Friedman’s Bazaar, a ladies bargain store in Circleville. Lewis went on a street car every night to play in the high school band in Chillicothe, Ohio. Lewis, who was raised Jewish, joined an Episcopal church to sing in the choir next to a girl he liked. Lewis was fired from Henry Goldsmith&#x27;s music store in Columbus, Ohio because whenever he demonstrated a clarinet for a customer people thought he had gone crazy. His brother Edgar Harrison (C.E. 1913) went to Ohio State University.

==Career==
Lewis was one of the first Northern musicians to imitate the style of New Orleans jazz musicians who came to New York in the 1910s. He first recorded in 1917 with Earl Fuller&#x27;s Jazz Band, then engaged at Rector&#x27;s restaurant in Manhattan, a band which was attempting to copy the sound of the city&#x27;s newest sensation, the Original Dixieland Jass Band, which was playing at Reisenweber&#x27;s restaurant in New York City.

Although the piccolo was the first instrument Lewis learned, he also played the C-melody saxophone but was known principally as a clarinetist throughout his long career. His primary instrument was a B♭ Albert System clarinet.

Based on his earliest recordings, Lewis did not seem able to do much on the clarinet other than trill in its upper register. Promoting one recording the Victor catalog stated: &quot;The sounds as of a dog in his dying anguish are from Ted Lewis&#x27; clarinet&quot;. As his career gained momentum he refined his style under the influence of the first New Orleans clarinetists to relocate in New York, Larry Shields, Alcide Nunez, and Achille Baquet.

By 1919, Lewis was leading his own band with whom he starred in the Broadway musical revue &quot;The Greenwich Village Follies of 1919&quot;. He had a recording contract with Columbia Records, which marketed him as their answer to the Original Dixieland Jass Band who recorded for Victor records. For a time (as the company did with Paul Whiteman) Columbia gave him a special record label featuring his picture.

At the start of the 1920s, he was being promoted as one of the leading lights of the mainstream form of jazz popular at the time. Although Lewis&#x27;s clarinet style became increasingly corny, he certainly knew what good clarinet playing sounded like, for he hired musicians like Benny Goodman, Jimmy Dorsey, Frank Teschemacher, and Don Murray to play clarinet in his band. Over the years his band also included jazz greats Muggsy Spanier on trumpet and George Brunies on trombone. Ted Lewis&#x27;s band was second only to the Paul Whiteman band in popularity during the early 1920s, and arguably played a more authentic form of jazz with less pretension than Whiteman.

Lewis recorded for Columbia from 1919 to 1933. Subsequently, he recorded for Decca from 1934 through the 1940s. In 1932, Lewis recorded &quot;In a Shanty in Old Shanty Town&quot;, which he had performed in the film &quot;The Crooner&quot; with his orchestra. The recording reached number one in radio polls and remained there for ten weeks.

One of Lewis&#x27;s most memorable songs was &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot; with which he frequently closed his act. Around 1928, Lewis noticed an usher named Eddie Chester mimicking his movements during his act. He hired Chester to follow him on stage as his shadow during &quot;Me and My Shadow&quot;. Chester was followed by four African-American shadows, the most famous being Charles &quot;Snowball&quot; Whittier, making Ted Lewis one of the first prominent white entertainers to showcase African-American performers (arguably in stereotypical ways) onstage, on film, and eventually on network television.

Ted Lewis and His Orchestra was one of the featured entertainers at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition – Pageant of the Pacific on Treasure Island (Sunday, August 13, 1939, Program of Special Attractions and Events indicates that the Ted Lewis Orchestra performed from 2:45 to 3:45 p.m. and from 5:00 to 6:00 p.m. in the Temple Compound and from 8:30 to 11:30 p.m. in the Treasure Island Music Hall for a free dance).

Lewis&#x27;s band continued to play in the same general style throughout the Great Depression, but was essentially the musical backdrop for his act as a showman. He remained successful during an era when many bands broke up. Through it all he retained his famous catchphrase &quot;Is everybody happy?&quot; and &quot;Yessir!&quot;.

Lewis adopted a battered top hat for sentimental, hard-luck tunes (he called himself &quot;The High-Hatted Tragedian of Song&quot;). Frequently he would stray from song lyrics, improvising patter around them. This gave the effect of Lewis &quot;speaking&quot; the song spontaneously: &quot;When ma&#x27; baby... when ma&#x27; baby smiles at me... &quot;gee,&quot; what a wonderful, wonderful &quot;light&quot; that &quot;comes&quot; to her eyes... look at that &quot;light, &quot;folks...&quot;

Lewis kept his band together through the 1950s and continued to make appearances in Las Vegas and on television, appearing as the mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; and &quot;Person To Person&quot; in the 1950s, and &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot; and others in the 1960s and 1970s.

True to his vaudeville beginnings, he created a visual as well as a musical act. His physical presence with props like his top hat, white-tipped cane and clarinet combined with bits of visual humor and dancing were as important to him and as crucial to his popularity as his music.

==Films==
Lewis and his band appeared in a few early talkie movie musicals in 1929, notably the Warner Brothers revue &quot;The Show of Shows&quot;. The first of several films (1929, 1941, and 1943) titled with Lewis&#x27; catchphrase, &quot;Is Everybody Happy?&quot; also premiered in 1929, while 1935 saw Lewis and his band performing several numbers in the film &quot;Here Comes the Band&quot;.

In 1941 the band was recruited at the last minute, along with the Andrews Sisters, to furnish musical numbers for the Abbott and Costello comedy &quot;Hold That Ghost&quot; (1941), released by Universal Studios on August 6, 1941. Musical numbers cut from the feature were released by Universal separately on September 3, 1941, in a short subject entitled &quot;Is Everybody Happy?&quot;

In 1943 Columbia Pictures mounted a feature-length biographical film of Lewis—yet again titled &quot;Is Everybody Happy?&quot;—with actor Michael Duane portraying the bandleader and lip synching to Lewis&#x27;s recordings.

There is an extended caricature of Lewis in the Warner Brothers short &quot;Speaking of the Weather&quot; (Tashlin, 1937), playing &quot;Plenty of Money and You&quot;, and a briefer one (performed by Daffy Duck) in Person to Bunny (1960).

==Personal life==
Lewis married Adah Becker (1897 – May 31, 1981) in 1915. She was a ballerina when Ted met her that same year in Rochester New York. Only six weeks later they were married in three separate ceremonies on the same day, first by a justice of the peace, next by a rabbi and finally on stage that night. They remained married for 56 years until Ted&#x27;s death. Adah gave up her dance career to become his secretary and business manager. Ted and Adah moved into a 15-room apartment overlooking New York City&#x27;s Central Park and once they got married, and remained there for the rest of their lives.

Lewis died in his sleep in New York on August 25, 1971, of lung failure at the age of 81. Following a Jewish funeral service in New York City, his body was brought to Circleville where thousands walked past his coffin. Rabbi Jerome D. Folkman officiated, and remarked, &quot;The song has ended, but the memory lingers on.&quot; The burial was held at the local Forest Cemetery. Lewis&#x27;s stone, in the family plot, has his famous hat and cane inscribed upon it. His wife Adah, who died on May 31, 1981, rests beside him.

Upon his death, the City of New York, Yale and Harvard Universities and the Smithsonian Institution asked Adah for his memorabilia. She politely declined, saying Ted wanted everything to come back to the &quot;Capital of the World&quot;, Circleville, Ohio. She opened The Ted Lewis Museum, a modest storefront located across the street from where he was born, on June 5, 1977. Celebrities, relatives, friends and Ted Lewis admirers from everywhere attended the dedication. A theatre within the museum allows visitors to see Ted Lewis&#x27; TV and movie performances.

<doc id="151328" wikidata="Q151120" url="?curid=151328" title="Charles the Bold">
<text>Charles Martin (10 November 1433 – 5 January 1477), called the Bold, was the last duke of Burgundy from the House of Valois-Burgundy, ruling from 1467 to 1477. He was the only legitimate son of Philip the Good and his third wife, Isabella of Portugal. As heir and as ruler, Charles vied for power and influence with rivals such as his overlord, King Louis XI of France. In 1465 Charles led a successful revolt of Louis&#x27;s vassals in the War of the Public Weal.

After becoming the Duke of Burgundy in 1467, Charles pursued his ambitions for a kingdom, independent from France, that would stretch contiguously from the North Sea in the north to the borders of Savoy in the south. For this purpose, he acquired Guelders and Upper Alsace; sought the title King of the Romans; and gradually became an enemy of the Germans. Charles married Margaret of York for an English alliance. He arranged the betrothal between his sole child, Mary, with Maximilian of Austria.

A passionate musician and patron of the arts, Charles supported the production of illuminated manuscripts and music. His court was famously known as a centre of arts, chivalry, and etiquette. He was obsessed with order and regulation and issued many ordinances throughout his rule, dictating military matters, legislation, and diplomacy in the minutest detail. Charles was religious and his patron saint was Saint George. He turned down multiple requests from the pope and the Venetians to undertake a crusade against the Ottoman Turks.

Towards the end of his life, Charles became engaged in a multi-national conflict called the Burgundian Wars (1474–1477), where he fought to retain ownership of Upper Alsace against an alliance of Swiss, German, and Alsatian polities called the Lower League. After his unsuccessful siege of Neuss, he was defeated by the Swiss at the battles of Grandson and Morat. Charles was killed during the Battle of Nancy on 5 January 1477, fighting against Duke René II of Lorraine and his Swiss army. His death triggered the War of the Burgundian Succession and led to the end of the Burgundian State. Charles&#x27;s daughter, Mary, was the last of Charles&#x27;s dynasty. Mary&#x27;s son, Philip of Austria, inherited the Burgundian Netherlands.

== Background ==
The House of Valois-Burgundy began with Philip the Bold, the fourth son of John II, King of France. Philip became the Duke of Burgundy in 1363. In 1369, Philip married Margaret of Male, the heiress of Louis II, Count of Flanders, who would inherit the wealthy lands of Flanders, Rethel, Antwerp, and Mechelen, along with the territories bordering Flanders and Burgundy: the counties of Artois, Franche-Comté, and Nevers. Philip expanded his influence in the Low Countries further by contracting marriage alliances. He was heavily involved in the royal court of France, especially after the death of his brother, Charles V, and during the troublesome reign of his successor, Charles VI. When Philip died in 1404, his lands were divided between his three sons, John, Anthony, and Philip.

John the Fearless, Philip the Bold&#x27;s eldest son, inherited the Duchy of Burgundy and the major part of his maternal inheritance the following year. The division of Philips&#x27;s lands reduced John&#x27;s income severely and by 1407, his treasury was nearly empty. John was forced to borrow money. To restore his influence, John turned to French politics and bitterly vied for power in the French court against the king&#x27;s brother, Louis of Orleans. In 1407, John ordered the assassination of Louis and sparked the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. John himself was assassinated in the conflict in 1419.

John was succeeded by his only son, Philip the Good. Unlike his father and grandfather, Philip distanced himself from French politics. He forged alliances elsewhere, marrying Isabella of Portugal in 1430. Isabella was Philip&#x27;s third wife after Michelle of Valois and Bonne of Artois, who both died without producing any children. Philip the Good desired a strong, centralised duchy ruled by a prestigious dynasty with a new, non-French cultural heritage.

Philip then began his territorial expansion in France; bringing Arras, Péronne, Roye, and Picardy into his realm. In 1420, he purchased the county of Namur, a town located in the Holy Roman Empire, from Jean III. He used warfare to seize the counties of Hainaut, Holland, Friesland, and Zeeland from his cousin, Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut, and won them completely by 1433. When Philip of Saint Pol died suddenly and unexpectedly in 1430, Philip inherited the Duchy of Brabant and three principalities: Brabant, Limburg, and Lotharingia. The Holy Roman Emperor, Sigismund, unsuccessfully sought to curb the expansions until his death in 1437. The French and Burgundians reconciled in 1435 at the Congress of Arras.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===
Charles Martin (second forename) was born on 10 November 1433 in Dijon, capital of the Duchy of Burgundy. He was the third child of Philip the Good with his third wife Isabella of Portugal and the only one to survive past infancy. His mother, fearing that she would lose another child, consecrated the infant to the Blessed Sacrament. Philip the Good arrived in Dijon in late November to celebrate the birth. He made his son a knight of the Golden Fleece and the count of Charolais in France. The Golden Fleece was a knightly order created by Philip in 1430, and Charolais was a title given to the heirs of the dukes of Burgundy. Charles was baptised on 20 November, with Count Charles of Nevers and Antoine from the influential de Croÿ family as his sponsors; he was named after the count of Nevers, Philip the Good&#x27;s stepson through his second wife, Bonne of Artois.

In early spring 1434, Isabella and her son moved to the mountain fortress of Talant, in fear of multiple outbreaks of plague in Burgundy. In winter, the Duchess and her son travelled to Paris to join Philip the Good. En route, they stayed in Bruges, where a rebellion against Philip the Good was brewing. In 1436, when Isabella and her entourage were to leave the city, rebels forcefully arrested them near the city gate. The rebellion was suppressed in 1438, when Philip the Good blockaded the city and forced the rebels to surrender.

During infancy, Charles was described as a robust child. Philip the Good assigned many tutors for the young Charles, the most important among them being Antoine Haneron, professor of rhetoric in the University of Louvain. Like his father, Charles developed a fondness for reading histories, chronicles, and historical romances. Charles aspired to become a conqueror like Alexander the Great. The fact that both he and Alexander had fathers named Philip stimulated his imagination and further encouraged his ambition.

Until the age of six, Charles was brought up by his cousins, John and Agnes of Cleves, who both were the children of Mary of Burgundy, the daughter of John the Fearless. Of the two, Agnes was more prominent in Charles&#x27;s early education. Agnes and Charles were constantly in his mother&#x27;s company.

In 1435, with the Treaty of Arras, Philip the Good reconciled with Charles VII, King of France, marking the end of the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War. As a sign of good faith in his new ally, Charles VII also allowed a marriage between one of his daughters and Philip&#x27;s heir and sent his daughters to Burgundy. Philip chose Catherine, the king&#x27;s ten-year-old daughter, to marry the six-year-old Charles. The two were married on 11 June 1439, during a ceremony accompanied by concerts, jousts, and banquets in the city of Saint-Omer. The two were put under the care of a governess, but were often separated from each other to spend their time with hobbies in line with their ages. Catherine died on 30 July 1446, and her death was deeply mourned at the Burgundian court.

In 1441, Philip the Good appointed Jean d&#x27;Auxy, of Auxi-le-Château, as the eight-year-old Charles&#x27;s guardian. D&#x27;Auxy later served as Charles&#x27;s chamberlain, from 1456 to 1468. At the age of 12, Charles began to participate in the public affairs of his father&#x27;s realm. In 1445, he accompanied his father on a rare state visit to Holland and Zealand.

=== Youth ===
In 1449, the wealthy city of Ghent rebelled against Burgundian rule in response to new taxes on salt. Charles took part in the fighting; however, to keep him out of danger, Philip the Good falsely told Charles that his mother Isabella was seriously ill in Lille. Charles left shortly before the decisive Battle of Gavere in 1453. In Lille, his mother honoured him with a feast, and to everyone&#x27;s surprise, encouraged him to return to the battlefield and fight for his inheritance. By that time, Philip the Good had won the battle and defeated the rebellious burghers.

Charles remained a widower for eight years until he married Isabella of Bourbon in 1454. Isabella was the daughter of Agnes of Burgundy, and was Philip the Good&#x27;s niece. Her father, Charles I, Duke of Bourbon, sent her as a child to the Burgundian court as a ward of Isabella of Portugal. A shy and pliant young woman, Isabella was adored by Philip the Good, who saw an opportunity to renew the Treaty of Arras (which had been debased by Charles VII&#x27;s threatening actions towards Burgundy) by marrying a Bourbon to his son. Charles was not aware of his father&#x27;s intention until the night before his marriage on 31 October; he did not resist the match. With his marriage, the town of Chinon was incorporated into Philip the Good&#x27;s realm, as part of Isabella&#x27;s dowry.

== Struggle for power ==

=== Disputes with Philip the Good ===
From 1454 to 1464, Charles was excluded from power—the ducal council and the Burgundian court—by his father, Philip the Good. In 1454, Philip appointed Charles &quot;governor and lieutenant-general in absence&quot; while he attended the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. Philip hoped to meet Emperor Frederick III and attach him to his aspirations for a crusade to retake Constantinople from the Ottomans. However, the emperor did not show up. Even as regent, Charles held little to no power compared to his mother, the duchess, and his father. Nevertheless, Charles still was able to issue documents in his own name. His regency was short-lived, for Philip returned to Burgundy on 7 or 9 August, and Charles returned to his former powerless position.

Charles was on bad terms with his father due to his exclusion from power, and their bad relations climaxed in 1457, when Charles wanted to appoint Antoin Rolin, the of Aymeries, as his chamberlain. Antoin was the son of Nicolas Rolin, Philip the Good&#x27;s chancellor. The Duke, wary of the power his chancellor might get with this appointment, refused his son&#x27;s request and instead proposed Philip I of Porcéan, high bailiff of Hainault and a member of the influential House of Croÿ. Charles distrusted Philip, because he suspected that the Croÿ family accepted money from Charles VII to undermine Philip the Good, and refused his father&#x27;s proposal. Philip was so furious that Charles&#x27;s mother feared for Charles&#x27;s life and had him removed from court. Charles fled to Dendermonde (today in northern Belgium) and Philip got lost in the forests of Soignies trying to find his son. Through the mediation of Isabella of Bourbon, who was pregnant with Charles&#x27;s child, Philip and his son reached a truce.

When Charles&#x27;s daughter, Mary, was born on 13 February 1457, neither Charles nor his father attended her baptism, for both wanted to avoid each other. Nicolas Rolin was removed from the chancellery, and Rolin&#x27;s close ally, Jean Chevrot, was removed from the ducal council. Consequently, de Croÿ became more powerful. Charles left the court for his personal estate at Le Quesnoy in Hainaut. There, he was entrusted with minor tasks regarding the Flemish subjects of his father. He also constructed the Blue Tower castle in Gorinchem as his personal seat in 1461. He attempted to formalise his status as the heir to the Burgundian State, which in turn prompted his father to cut off his allowance. Charles was deprived of any money to pay his staff or otherwise maintain his estate. According to Burgundian court chronicler Georges Chastellain, in 1463, Charles dismissed his staff because he could not pay their salaries, however, his staff were adamant to serve him and even offered him a share of their money. According to German historian Werner Paravicini, such acts of altruism were typical of that time, rendring the account more plausible.

In 1462, Charles survived a poisoning attempt on his life by Jehan Coustain, . Coustain was executed in Rupelmonde. Charles blamed de Croÿ for the assassination attempt, while de Croÿ came to believe that Charles had staged this attempt. By the end of 1463, the disputes between Charles and his father caused the States General of the Burgundian Netherlands to intervene. In 5 February 1464, Charles made a speech, attacking de Croÿ&#x27;s family, to the deputies assembled at Ghent. Charles and Philip the Good reconciled in June 1464, after they met in Lille, although de Croÿ maintained his hold on power. Later that year, Charles assumed full power by arguing that Philip was becoming senile. Charles put pressure on de Croÿ, but Philip protected de Croÿ by threatening Charles. Ten days later, the States General gave Charles full power by appointing him . His first act was to confiscate de Croÿ&#x27;s estates; de Croÿ and his family were banished to France, where their French patron, Louis XI, gave them no support.

=== Rivalry with Louis XI ===
In 1457, Louis, Dauphin of France and the heir to Charles VII, suddenly arrived at Philip the Good&#x27;s court at Brussels. Philip saw his guest as an opportunity to mend his relations with the crown and took the dauphin in, indulging him with kindness, showing humility, and refusing all the king&#x27;s requests to send the dauphin back. At Philip&#x27;s expense, Louis lived in Genappe, where he led a comfortable life. Charles VII attempts to regain his son failed. He reportedly said: &quot;My cousin Burgundy is feeding a fox who will eat up all his chickens&quot;. Louis would go on to become Philip&#x27;s favourite, in consequence of Philip&#x27;s quarrel with his son.

In contrast to Louis&#x27;s friendship with Philip the Good, Louis and Charles disliked each other. However, Charles asked the dauphin to be godfather to his daughter, Mary. Charles&#x27;s hatred for Louis increased when the latter ascended to the French throne after the death of his father on 22 July 1461. Louis was crowned king on 31 August in Reims under the regnal name Louis XI, with Philip the Good personally placing the crown on his head. While the duke thought that the hostilities between France and Burgundy were at an end, the new king at his coronation ceremony refused to participate in the feast sponsored by Philip in his honour. The latter thus returned to his realm disappointed. Charles feared Louis&#x27;s intention was to demolish the Burgundian defensive system in Picardy, and he was furious when a crisis occurred in autumn 1463 regarding the Somme towns, land belonging to his father. De Croÿ persuaded Philip to agree to amend the Treaty of Arras, which had given him cities such as Saint-Quentin, Abbeville, Amiens, Péronne, and Montdidier. Philip agreed to accept 400,000 gold &quot;écus&quot; from Louis to return those cities to the crown domains. When Charles was chosen as in 1464, he provoked a war against Louis by forming the League of the Public Weal.

The League of the Public Weal was a confederation of prominent French princes — Charles of Berry (the king&#x27;s brother), Francis II, Duke of Brittany, John II, Duke of Bourbon, and Jacques and John d&#x27;Armagnac — which was formed to undermine Louis XI&#x27;s authority. They declared Charles of Berry the regent of France and appointed Francis II as the captain general of the army. With the threat of rebellion looming, Louis offered to pardon all the dukes and lords. Minor lords accepted the pardon, but the dukes persisted with their demands. The members of the league chose Charles as their leader and began amassing an army. The League became the most dangerous in a series of princely revolts against the French crown; one chronicle recorded the number of the participants against Louis XI to be seven dukes, twelve counts, two lords, one marshal, and 51,000 men-at-arms.

To counteract the rebels, Louis XI amassed an army and sent it southwards to central France to defeat John II of Bourbon. Charles soon mustered an army of 25,000 men and marched towards Paris. Louis and his army hastily returned to Paris to defend the city against Charles&#x27;s army. On 15 July, Charles reached the village of Montlhéry; in search of his allies&#x27; armies, he discovered that the royal army was camped in Arpajon, a few miles south. On learning of Charles&#x27;s position, Louis moved to fight him.

On 16 July 1465, the two armies met and fought the Battle of Montlhéry. Charles placed himself next to the defensively positioned Burgundian vanguard, led by Louis of Saint-Pol. He attacked into the French left flank led by Charles IV, Count of Maine. Charles was pursuing the fleeing count and his army, when the French vanguard counterattacked, and Charles was wounded in the throat. He evaded capture and returned to his lines. After his return, he ordered his gunners to shoot at the king&#x27;s army; by his account, 1,200–1,400 men and a large number of horses were killed. In the late evening, Louis XI retreated eastwards to Paris.

While each side claimed victory in the battle, neither side achieved all their objectives. Charles could not capture Louis on the battlefield, and Louis could not prevent Charles from joining his allies. In spite of his ability to form his battle troops in a cohesive battle order, Charles had yet to become an able tactician. The rebel armies joined in the town of Étampes and began marching towards Paris on 31 July. The rebels laid siege to Paris, during which Charles directed his gunfire at the city&#x27;s walls. The rebels successfully entered the city when a nobleman named Charles de Melun opened the Saint-Antoine gate for them. Louis XI was then forced to negotiate. The parties signed the Treaty of Conflans, which ceded the rule of Normandy to Charles, Duke of Berry, and returned the Somme lands to Burgundy.

=== Ascension ===
On 12 June 1467, Philip the Good suddenly fell ill. For the next few days, he could hardly breathe and constantly vomited. Charles was summoned from Ghent to immediately come to his father. By the time he arrived, Philip had fallen unconscious and was struggling to breathe; he died on 15 June. Charles arranged for his father&#x27;s funeral to be held in St. Donatian&#x27;s Cathedral; the funeral was attended by 1200 persons from both Charles&#x27;s and Philip&#x27;s households. The cathedral was lit by 1400 candles which heated the inside of the church so much that holes had to be made in the windows to cool the air. Charles showed extreme emotions during the funeral: he shook, trembled, pulled his hair, and kept shouting and crying. The Court Chronicler, Georges Chastellain, doubted the sincerity of Charles&#x27;s distress, expressing astonishment that he could show such emotion.

Fourteen days later, Charles officially became the Duke of Burgundy. In celebration, he paraded through the city of Ghent on 28 June 1467, emulating Caesar. This Joyous Entry caused an uproar in the city. The people demanded an end to the humiliating penalties imposed on them after the revolt of 1449. Charles left the city with his daughter, the ten-year-old Mary, and the treasure kept by Philip the Good in the Prinsenhof of Ghent. The following January, Charles coerced the mayors of Ghent into asking for his pardon. Then, he abolished their governmental rights and announced that only he could appoint the town government, in contravention of Philip IV&#x27;s constitution of 1301.

=== The third marriage ===
On 26 September 1465, Charles&#x27;s wife, Isabella of Bourbon, died of tuberculosis at the age of 31. Court chronicles briefly recorded the long months of her illness. The most important part of her life for these chronicles was her marriage to Charles—during which she had only brought him one daughter and no male heirs—and the fact that she and Charles purportedly fell in love during what was initially merely a political marriage. Charles, busy with the political negotiations after the War of the Public Weal, could not attend her funeral.

Within weeks of Isabella of Bourbon&#x27;s death, Charles&#x27;s mother sought an English marriage for her son. She sent Guillaume de Clugny, one of Charles&#x27;s close advisors, to London to negotiate with Edward IV for a marriage between his sister, Margaret of York, and Charles. To prevent an English-Burgundian alliance, Louis XI proposed the hand of his daughter, the four-year-old Anne, to Charles in marriage. Charles refused this proposal. In the Spring of 1466, an embassy led by Edward Woodville, Edward IV&#x27;s brother-in-law, arrived in Burgundy to propose two marriages between the English royal family and the Burgundians: one between Margaret of York and Charles, and the other between Mary, Charles&#x27;s daughter, and George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence, Edward IV&#x27;s younger brother. Woodville&#x27;s visit failed in its purpose, as Charles was not interested in marrying his young daughter to the Duke of Clarence.

In October 1467, Edward IV publicly ratified the marriage between Charles and his sister, and Margaret of York appeared before the &quot;Magnum Concilium&quot; of Kingston upon Thames and formally gave her consent to the marriage. Charles welcomed the English delegation—led by Edward and Anthony Woodville—to Burgundy, and then had her mother accompany him to negotiate the final marriage treaty. The marriage treaty and the alliance was signed and ratified in February 1468, while the marriage ceremony was delayed to eight months later. Since Charles and Margaret were fourth-degree cousins, they needed a Papal dispensation to legitimise their marriage. As the dispensation was the groom&#x27;s duty, Charles sent a delegation to Rome. The delegation took until May 1469 to win the dispensation. Edward IV announced the marriage of his sister to Charles and dubbed him as &quot;a mighty Prince who bears no crown&quot;.

Charles and Margaret were married on 3 July at Damme, a town three miles from Bruges. For their wedding ceremony, Charles prepared nine receptions, each ending with a jousting match. He wished to outdo his father&#x27;s famous Feast of the Pheasant. The wedding displayed the power and wealth of the dukedom. At the end of the ceremonies, Charles left his wife alone to catch up on sleep; the two did not spend their wedding night together.

Charles and Margaret never had children. They spent little time together: only three weeks during the first six months after their marriage, one-quarter of the time during the years 1469 and 1470, and only three weeks throughout 1473. According to contemporary jurist, Filips Wielant, Charles housed Margaret far away from him because he did not want women to hamper his court life.

=== Territorial expansion ===
Like his father, Charles pursued territorial expansion; however, whereas Philip the Good pursued this policy by peaceful means, Charles vied for territory through conflict. In the Netherlands, he sought to expand his realm to the north-east: the Duchy of Guelders. Although it was never a part of the Burgundian lands, the duchy was dependent on Burgundian trade. In 1463, Adolf of Egmond rebelled against his father, the ruling duke, Arnold. With Philip the Good&#x27;s support, Adolf usurped the duchy and imprisoned his father in 1465. Adolf&#x27;s treatment of his father caused a scandal that resonated as far as Rome, where the Pope sought a mediator to end the conflict in Guelders. In 1471, Charles was appointed as the mediator; he marched into Guelders and restored Arnold to power. Adolf was placed under house arrest, and then to prison after a failed escape attempt. To retain Burgundian assistance, Arnold made Charles the Regent of Guelders; when Arnold died in February 1473, having left no heirs but his imprisoned son, he bequeathed the duchy to Charles.

However, Charles&#x27;s inheritance met with opposition. The Estates of Guelders, and the towns of Nijmegen, Arnhem, and Zutphen rejected Arnold&#x27;s will, and Louis XI asked Frederick III, the Holy Roman Empire, to confiscate the duchy. Frederick III was diplomatically close to Charles and did not intervene. Charles subdued the rebelling cities and the nobles of Guelders by force. On 9 June 1473, with a sizeable army, he entered the city of Maastricht without resistance. Roermond and Venlo quickly surrendered. Moers, whose count, Vincent von Moers, was the leader of the resistance, yielded to Charles&#x27;s artillery. The only serious conflict was the siege of Nijmegen, which only surrendered after inflicting severe losses on the Burgundian army. After the successful conquest of Guelders, Charles imposed heavy taxes and replaced the aldermen in the region. Charles gave more power to the ducal judicial officers to control the rebellious cities and to impose a centralised administration.

The Burgundian state under Charles was divided into two separate areas, the Duchy of Burgundy in the south and Flanders in the north. To unify them, Charles needed the Duchy of Lorraine and Alsace. On 21 March 1469, he received Sigismund, Archduke of Austria to his court to negotiate the purchase of Sigismund&#x27;s lands in Upper Alsace. Sigismund was in a desperate financial situation and eagerly agreed to sell. With this purchase, Charles acquired a claim to the city of Ferrette, close to the Swiss border, alarming the Swiss Confederacy. Charles&#x27;s rights and income from his new territories were severely limited because most of the land rights were mortgaged to local nobles. Charles&#x27;s deputy in the area, Peter von Hagenbach, imposed harsh taxes on the people. Soon, several towns of Alsace formed a league against Hagenbach. For the most part, Charles ignored the area.

=== Meeting the Emperor at Trier ===
Charles greatly desired to transform the Duchy of Burgundy into a kingdom, to free it from the limitations of vassalage to the French crown and to enhance his personal stature. The only way for Charles to realise such a transformation was within the framework of the Holy Roman Empire. At Charles&#x27;s request, Sigismund of Austria proposed Charles to be the next king of the Romans, the title of the successor of the emperor, with the marriage between the Emperor&#x27;s son and the Charles&#x27;s daughter as an inducement. As one of the richest men in the Europe, and also an ally of the rebellious princes in the empire, the Hungarians, and the Bohemians, Charles was a coveted ally for Emperor Frederick III, who agreed to receive him at Trier.

In October 1473, both parties reached Trier: the Emperor with his son Maximilian and 2,500 horsemen, while the Burgundian entourage consisted of 13,000 men at arms (including artillery), Burgundian nobility, bishops, and treasures and relics. Despite all the grandeur, Frederick III was disappointed that Charles had not brought his daughter, amidst rumours spread by Habsburg adversaries alleging that Mary was physically defective. Charles wished to become the king of the Romans and to succeed Frederick as emperor. In return, Maximilian would inherit the Burgundian State, and later become emperor. In addition, Charles wanted to become a prince-elector, taking the Bohemian seat in the Electoral College, and be recognised as the duke of Guelders.

Although Charles received recognition for his possession of the Duchy of Guelders, he still was not recognised as king of the Romans, in part because Frederick III was convinced that the prince-electors would not vote for Charles to receive the title. During the conference, Charles ignored and alienated the prince-electors. When he realised how much he needed their support, Charles tried to impress them with displays of his wealth, but the Germans were not swayed. Charles&#x27;s decision to only interact with the emperor, and not the prince-electors, was a fatal mistake, showing an utter ignorance of German political norms.

As an alternative, Frederick III proposed to elevate the Duchy of Burgundy to a kingdom; Charles accepted. The two parties planned for Frederick III to crown Charles in the Trier Cathedral on 25 November. However, the next day the Emperor secretly departed from Trier, embarking on the Moselle at dawn. Charles became enraged, locked himself in his room and smashed the furniture to pieces. But he did not break the betrothal between Maximilian and Mary, hoping that he could still become a king.

== Policies ==

=== Legislation ===
Upon his ascension as duke in 1468, Charles sought to dismantle the jurisdiction of the Parlement of Paris as the highest juridical power within his country. The cities and institutions in Burgundy relied on the parlement for challenging legal decisions. This irritated the Dukes of Burgundy who detested any reliance on France. Philip the Good had established an itinerant, but less powerful, court of justice that travelled all across the country. Charles established a central sovereign court in Mechelen under his 1473 ordinance of Thionville. The city would house the new Court of Auditors, which previously resided in Lille and Brussels. The language of this parliament was French, with two-thirds of its personnel being Burgundian. The Mechelen parliament only held authority in the Low Countries. In the Burgundian mainlands, Charles established another parliament whose seat moved between Beaune and Dole.

In Charles&#x27;s own words, the proper administration of justice was &quot;the soul and the spirit of the public entity.&quot; He was recognised as the first sovereign to make a serious effort to impose peace and justice upon the Low Countries, and he was regarded as &quot;a prince of Justice&quot; by historian Andreas van Haul, a century after his death. However, Georges Chastellain criticized Charles for his lack of mercy while imposing justice. Charles damaged his relations with his people by inspecting and regulating every aspect of their lives, and he was unnecessarily harsh. Charles wanted to reduce the influence of the local aldermen, who were viewed by the commoners as the local court, and he undermined the Mechelen parliament. To both increase his grip on the seats of justice and to fill up his treasury, Charles dismissed the aldermen and sold their offices to the highest bidders; only the wealthiest subjects came to hold those positions. Many institutions protested against these practices, but Charles persisted because he constantly needed to fund his armies.

=== Religion ===
Charles the Bold was religious, and regarded himself as more devout and pious than any ruler of his day. He considered his sovereignty as bestowed upon him by God and thus owed his power to God alone. From a young age, Charles chose Saint George as his patron saint. He kept a sword purported to have belonged to Saint George in his treasury, and he revered other warrior saints, such as Saint Michael. He commissioned a prayer book, from Lieven van Lathem, which was completed in 1469. The opening diptych of the manuscript, as well as two other pieces, demonstrate Charles&#x27;s devotion to Saint George. In Margaret of York&#x27;s copy of &quot;La Vie de Sainte Colette&quot;, she and Charles are shown as devotees of Saint Anne. Multiple modern scholars, such as Jeffrey Chipps Smith, have made a connection between the saint and the duke from the fact that both were married three times. According to Nancy Bradley Warren, the portrayal of Charles and Saint Anne may have been a way to legitimise his marriage to Margaret and reassure those who were dubious regarding an alliance with England.

Throughout his reign, Charles faced multiple requests to pledge his men to a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. Pope Sixtus IV sent three instructions to the papal legate at the Burgundian court, Lucas de Tollentis, directing him to encourage Charles to undertake a crusade against the Ottomans. Tollentis reported to the Pope on 23 June 1472 that Charles was &quot;resolved in our favour&quot;, and the welfare of Christendom was never far from his mind. Charles may have considered an expedition to the east as the climax of his life&#x27;s work; however, during his lifetime, he never undertook a crusade nor did he make preparations for it as his father had. Only for a short time, between late 1475 and early 1476, did he seriously consider a crusade and that was only after a meeting with Andreas Palaiologos, the deposed Despot of the Morea, who agreed to cede his claim as the Emperor of Trebizond and Constantinople to Charles.

=== Diplomacy ===

Charles the Bold pursued a risky and aggressive foreign policy. Trying to have as many allies as possible, he considered everyone, aside from Louis XI, as his ally. In 1471, he made a list of his nineteen allies. He increased the number to twenty-four by the next year and had twenty-six allies in 1473, in contrast to Louis XI&#x27;s fifteen allies. Some of these relations, such as with Scotland, were only formalities. The kings of Scotland and Denmark would also sign treaties with Louis XI and appear on his list of allies.

Initially, Charles was hesitant about an alliance with Matthias Corvinus, the king of Hungary. However, the mutual friendship with the Kingdom of Naples brought Burgundy and Hungary closer to each other, and in his pursuit to ally with Frederick III&#x27;s opponents, Charles made contact with Matthias. Charles hoped that by supporting Matthias&#x27; claim to the Kingdom of Bohemia, Matthias would back him in the electoral college. In November 1474, the two successfully concluded a treaty by which they agreed to partition the Holy Roman Empire between themselves, with Charles becoming the king of the Romans and having the lands along the Rhine under his authority while Matthias would acquire Breslau and Bohemia. In 1473, through negotiations with the new Duke of Lorraine, René II, Charles obtained the right to pass his armies through the duke&#x27;s lands, and assign Burgundian captains to important fortifications in Lorraine, essentially turning the duchy into a Burgundian protectorate. Among Charles&#x27;s other allies were Amadeus IX, Duke of Savoy, whose wife, Yolande of Valois, Louis XI&#x27;s sister, drove the duchy into an alliance with Burgundy on the basis of their shared dislike of Louis XI.

The intense rivalry between Louis XI and Charles kept both rulers always prepared for an eventual war. The suspicious death of Charles of Valois, Duke of Berry, the king&#x27;s brother, in 1472, prompted Charles to raise arms to avenge his ally&#x27;s death, stating that Berry had been poisoned by Louis. After a short conflict, the two ceased their fighting in the winter 1473 without any talk of peace. Neither would declare war on the other for the rest of their reigns. In 1468, Charles and Louis tried to make peace, which astonished the rest of France. Their peace talks soon turned into hostility once Charles learned that Louis had his hands in a recent rebellion in Liége. Afterwards, Charles imprisoned Louis in the city of Péronne and coerced him into signing a treaty favourable to Burgundy, with conditions such as forfeiting the Duke of Burgundy from paying homage, guarantying Charles&#x27;s sovereignty over Picardy, and abolishing French jurisdiction over Burgundian subjects. Louis reluctantly agreed to all the demands and signed the Treaty of Péronne. However, the crown did not abide by the treaty terms and Franco-Burgundian relations remained poor.

==== In Italy ====
At the start of Louis XI&#x27;s reign, Italy&#x27;s triple alliance between the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Florence, and the Kingdom of Naples, allowed the influence of France grow in the peninsula, for Milan and Florence were long-standing allies of Louis. To remedy this, Charles enlarged Burgundy&#x27;s sphere of influence in Italy to dwarf that of France. The first Burgundian alliance with an Italian ruler was with King Ferdinand I of Naples, a ruler admired by both Charles and Louis.

Ferdinand was the legitimised bastard of Alfonso I, and the Pope did not recognize his claim to the throne. Meanwhile, René of Anjou, the deposed King of Naples, persistently sought his title back. In the constant fear of an invasion from René or his heirs with the support of Louis XI, Ferdinand allied himself with Charles, who made Ferdinand a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1473. Charles constantly toyed with the idea of marrying his daughter, Mary, to Ferdinand&#x27;s second son, Frederick of Naples, who visited the Burgundian court in 1469 and 1470. In 1474, when war with Louis XI was on the horizon, Ferdinand&#x27;s participation was dependent on his son&#x27;s marriage to Mary. Charles hinted at his willingness to give his daughter&#x27;s hand to Frederick, and Ferdinand dispatched his son to Burgundy on 24 October 1474. Although Frederick became a lieutenant and close military advisor to Charles, he failed in his ultimate mission of marrying Mary.

The Duchy of Milan was France&#x27;s most important ally in the Italian peninsula; Milan&#x27;s ruler, Galeazzo Maria Sforza was attached to the King of France through his marriage with Louis&#x27; niece, Bona of Savoy. Charles tried to form an alliance with Milan. In 1470, he offered Galeazzo membership in the Order of the Golden Fleece, on the premise of an alliance, but was rejected. One time he even included Milan on one of his lists of allies, which caused Galeazzo to protest. To bring Galeazzo into alliance, Charles started a rumour that he wished to conquer Milan. Concerns about a probable war, and Charles&#x27;s bringing diplomatic pressure to isolate Milan from France, persuaded Galeazzo to sign a treaty, on 30 January 1475 at Moncalieri, that formed an alliance between Savoy, Burgundy, and Milan. As a result of this treaty, diplomatic relations between the two duchies were established, and Galeazzo sent Giovanni Pietro Panigarola as his envoy to Burgundy.

Charles&#x27;s relation with the Republic of Venice was based on his willingness to launch a crusade against the Turks. With Ferdinand of Naples&#x27;s insistence, the senate of Venice agreed to a treaty against the King of France on 20 March 1472. From then on, Venice constantly urged Charles to uphold his part of the bargain and support them in their war with the Ottomans. Charles&#x27;s inaction led to gradual estrangement from Venice. For instance, when he wanted to recruit the Venetian &quot;condottiero&quot; Bartolomeo Colleoni (who would have brought with him 10,000 men at arms) to his ranks, the Venetian government did not allow Colleoni to go. Charles spent two years negotiating with the Venetian ambassadors, but in the end, was unsuccessful in convincing them. By 1475, the alliance between Venice and Burgundy had ceased to seem like a genuine union.

The Italian peninsula saw a shift in spheres of influence after the Treaty of Moncalieri in 1475. Charles the Bold triumphantly replaced Louis XI as the dominant influence in Italian politics, with three of four major secular powers in the region—Milan, Naples, and Venice—all aligned with him. Only Florence remained a French ally, though they remained neutral toward Charles on the basis of their mutual alliance with Venice. Charles successfully eliminated any possible Italian support for France, and now could count on the support of his Italian allies if a war with France ensued. However, from 1472, relations with France amounted to a truce, and remained as such during rest of Charles&#x27;s reign.

=== Arts ===
The Burgundian court under Charles the Bold was famous and magnificent. It was seen as a place to learn arts and etiquette and where chivalry and courtly life were more intact than in the rest of the Europe. For this reason, the Burgundian court was the host to many young noblemen and princes from all across the continent. Even future generations admired Charles&#x27;s court. Philip II, for instance, at the urging of his father, Charles V, introduced the &quot;ceremonial of the court of Burgundy&quot; into Spain, using Olivier de la Marche&#x27;s account of Charles the Bold&#x27;s court. Charles&#x27;s Burgundian court thus became the idealized courtly life that sparked inspiration throughout 17th century Spain. While Charles&#x27;s court did not differ much from those of his contemporaries, certain special features increased the court&#x27;s appeal: the number of knights and nobles, the sacred image of the ruler who was distant from other courtiers, and the splendour of the court. Charles, like his predecessors, displayed his glamour through extravagant patronage of the arts.

During Charles&#x27;s reign, the production of illuminated manuscripts flourished. After his ascension in 1467, Charles provided considerable funds for projects left incomplete after his father&#x27;s death and commissioned new projects as well. As a patron of Renaissance humanism, he commissioned the translation of Quintus Curtius Rufus&#x27;s &quot;Histories of Alexander the Great&quot; into French to replace the inadequate &quot;Roman d&#x27;Alexandre en prose&quot;. He commissioned the Portuguese Vasco de Lucena and Jehan de Chesne to respectively translate Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot; and Caesar&#x27;s &quot;De bello Gallico&quot; into French. In 1468, he commissioned Guillaume Fillastre to compose a &quot;didactic chronicle&quot; called &quot;Histoire de Toison d&#x27;Or&quot; containing moral and didactic stories of Jason, Jacob, Gideon, Mesha, Job, and David. He employed the finest calligraphers and illuminators to engross his ordinances; the Ordinance of 1469 was illuminated by Nicolas Spierinc and was distributed among Charles&#x27;s courtiers. His prayer book illuminated by Lieven van Lathem is considered a masterpiece of Flemish illumination that influenced great illuminators such as the Master of Mary of Burgundy. Charles and his wife Margaret were patrons of Simon Marmion, who illuminated a breviary and a panel painting for them.

Charles was a patron of music and was a capable musician. In his 1469 ordinance, Charles gave a clear view of what his musical entourage should be: a concert band, ceremonial trumpeters, chamber musicians, an organist, and the chapel musicians, whose music had more variety than that of Philip the Good&#x27;s chapel. He brought his chapel with himself on his campaigns and had choristers sing a new song to him every night in his chambers. Charles was a patron of the composer Antoine Busnois, who became his choirmaster; his court musicians also included Hayne van Ghizeghem and Robert Morton. His favourite song was &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot;, a song that may have been written for him. Charles composed a motet that was sung in the Cambrai Cathedral, presumably in the presence of Guillaume Du Fay, one of the most well-known composers of his era. Among his other works were chansons and secular songs. Although no pieces from his motet or chansons remain, two songs are attributed to him: (&quot;of the Duke of Burgundy&quot;) and (&quot;Duke Charles&quot;). Both are from Italian songbooks wherein no name of the composers is mentioned. Nevertheless, the songs have uncanny similarities to each other: in voice ranges, in their use of pitch C, their musical form (), and both songs start with the phrase &quot;Ma dame&quot;. According to the musicologist David Fallows, with such similar traits, the songs are most likely both composed by Charles in the 1460s. Charles also liked to sing; however, he did not have a good singing voice.

=== Military ===
When Charles became the Duke of Burgundy, his army functioned under a feudalistic system, with most of its men either recruited through summons or hired under contract. The majority of his army consisted of French nobles, and their retainers, and English archers; this army suffered from an inefficient distribution of resources and slow movement. Having lived through a period of peace under Philip the Good, the army scarcely trained and was unprepared. Furthermore, in comparison to other armies of Europe, their structure was outdated. To remedy these problems, Charles issued a series of military ordinances, between 1468 and 1473, that not only would revolutionise the Burgundian army, but also would influence every European army in the 16th century. The first of these ordinances, addressed to the Marshal of Burgundy, contains instructions on who could be recruited to the army and describes the personnel of the artillery: namely, masons, assistants, cannoneers, and carpenters. The second ordinance, issued at Abbeville in 1471, proclaimed the formation of a standing army, called , made up of 1250 lances fournies, who were accompanied by 1200 crossbows, 1250 handgunners, and 1250 pikemen. A squad consisted of a man-at-arms, a mounted page, a mounted swordsman, three horse archers, a crossbowmen, and a pikeman. Charles designed a uniform for each of the companies (Cross of Burgundy inscribed on the ducal colours). He also designed an overlapping military hierarchy that sought to preclude the infighting between captains and their subordinates that would arise in a pyramidal hierarchy.

The last of these ordinances, issued at Thionville, marked the culmination of Charles&#x27;s martial administration. The organisation of a squad was categorised to the merest detail; specific battle marches were created to keep order between the men; a soldier&#x27;s equipment were explained in detail, and discipline among the ranks was regarded as of the utmost importance. Charles forbade individual soldiers to have a camp follower, instead, he permitted each company of 900 to have 30 women in their ranks who would attend to them. He set brutal rules against defaulters and deserters. In 1476, he appointed Jehan de Dadizele to arrest deserters. Those guilty of encouraging soldiers to desert were to be executed and the deserters were to return to the army. Charles intended for his soldiers to tutor their compatriots about these new conditions in private settings without a disciplinarian presiding over them. Charles&#x27;s erratic pace in promulgating new, detailed reforms every few years was too much for his captains and men-at-arms to sufficiently implement.

Charles&#x27;s ordinances were mostly inspired by Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Cyropaedia&quot;. After observing how Cyrus the Great achieved the willing obedience of his subjects, Charles became obsessed with discipline and order among his men-at-arms. He applied Xenophon&#x27;s comments in the Abbeville ordinance, thus ensuring that through a complex chain of command, his soldiers would both command and obey. The influence of Vegetius&#x27;s &quot;De re militari&quot; is also quite apparent in Charles&#x27;s writings. Vegetius suggested that soldiers were to be recruited from men offering themselves to a martial life; afterwards, they would swear an oath to stay loyal to the duke. Charles adapted both ideas in his 1471 ordinance. Charles&#x27;s 1473 ordinance included exercises from Vegetius to keep soldiers disciplined and prepared.

The Burgundian standing army struggled with recruitment. Although the army had enough men-at-arms, pikemen, and mounted archers, it lacked culverins and foot archers. To solve this problem, Charles diversified his army and recruited from other nationalities. Italian mercenaries were his favourite and by 1476 filled most of his ranks. Despite the constant warning from military authors of the past against the recruitment of mercenaries, contemporary chronicler Jean Molinet praised Charles for his brilliant solution, saying that he was favoured by both heaven and earth and thus above the &quot;commandments of philosophers&quot;.

== Burgundian Wars ==

=== League of Constance ===
Over the span of five years, Charle&#x27;s deputy in Upper Alsace, Peter von Hagenbach, alienated his Alsatian subjects; antagonized the neighbouring Swiss Confederacy, who felt threatened by his rule; and showed aggressive intentions towards the city of Mulhouse. As a result, the Swiss sought alliances with German towns and Louis XI. By February 1473, a handful of free cities had combined to end Burgundian rule in Alsace.

The cities of Strasbourg, Colmar, Basel, and Sélestat offered money to Sigismund of Austria to buy back Alsace from Charles; but Charles was determined to keep it and refused to sell. To emphasize his claim, Charles toured the province around Christmas 1473, reportedly with an army. He tried to make peace with the Swiss, who questioned his sincerity. Charles&#x27;s threats prompted the Swiss to ally themselves with their former enemy, Sigismund.

In April 1474, the rebelling Alsatian cities and the Swiss formed the League of Constance to drive Charles and Peter von Hagenbach from Alsace, and rebellion quickly broke out. The league overthrew Hagenbach, put him on trial, and on 9 May executed him. Upon hearing this news, Charles was enraged. In August, he sent an army led by Peter&#x27;s brother, Stefan von Hagenbach, into Alsace. After Charles refused again to give up control of Alsace, the League of Constance officially declared war on him. Hagenbach&#x27;s death might be considered the catalyst to the conflict now called the &quot;Burgundian Wars&quot;.

=== Siege of Neuss ===
When Alsace rose up against Burgundian authority, Charles was already preoccupied with another campaign, in Cologne. Charles aided the Archbishop of Cologne, Ruprecht against a rebellion, hoping to turn the electorate into a Burgundian protectorate. He held peace talks at Maastricht on 14 May 1474, which failed. From 22 June, he planned to lay siege to Colognian cities and force Ruprecht&#x27;s subjects to accept the latter&#x27;s terms. The first of his targets was the city of Neuss, which Charles needed to control in order to guarantee Burgundian supply lines for an attack on Cologne. Neuss was expected to fall within a few days, and many contemporary historians feared its fall would open up Germany to the Burgundians.

On 28 July 1474, Charles&#x27;s army reached the southern gate of Neuss. Its artillery immediately began bombardment to breach the walls. To isolate the city, Charles assigned men to every gate, blockaded the river across Neuss with fifty boats, and secured the two isles adjacent to the city. Despite all attempts, communications between Neuss and the outside world continued. In September, the Burgundian night watch caught a man swimming in the river with a letter detailing Emperor Frederick&#x27;s intention to attack the Burgundian besiegers. Upon learning of Frederick&#x27;s plan, Charles intensified the barrage, and attempted to drain the city&#x27;s moat by diverting the River Erft and sinking overloaded barges into the Rhine.

Residents of Neuss endured the constant bombardment, and refused to surrender even though their food had been reduced from cows to snails and weeds. Their resistance gained admiration from all the contemporary chronicles. Emperor Frederick was slow to amass an army. When he had gathered 20,000 German forces in Spring 1475, he took seventeen days to march from Cologne to Zons, their encampment. Charles was constantly petitioned by his brother-in-law, Edward IV of England, to leave the siege and join Edward in fighting the French. But in the face of the Emperor&#x27;s forces, Charles did not want to withdraw and lose face. The Emperor had no desire to fight the Burgundians and limited his involvement in the conflict to a few skirmishes. The conflict quickly came to an end after an emissary from the Pope threatened both sides with excommunication, and all parties signed a peace treaty on 29 May 1475.

Charles left Neuss on 27 June. The city had been so badly damaged that it was on the verge of surrender. His propagandists presented him as the Caesar of their age who had brought a humiliating defeat on the German forces. After signing the peace treaty, hundreds of German soldiers lined up to see him. According to one chronicle, many of them threw themselves at Charles and worshipped him. However, the Siege of Neuss cost Burgundy dearly in army strength and strategic opportunities. Besides the number of men and equipment lost, this siege also cost Charles a chance to destroy Louis XI and France. Edward IV, after seeing no support from his ally, agreed to sign the Treaty of Picquigny with Louis XI; the terms of the treaty included a seven-year truce and a marriage alliance between the two kingdoms. Charles had to sign a treaty with Louis as well, so that he would be free to march south and deal with the League of Constance, whose members now also included René II of Lorraine.

=== Battle of Grandson ===

Charles commenced his full-fledged invasion against the Swiss and their allies immediately after signing the peace treaty with Louis XI. Splitting his army into two parts, he advanced through Lorraine with no resistance and captured the capital city of Nancy. At the beginning of 1476, Charles besieged the recently captured castle of Grandson which was fortified by a garrison from Bern. Despite the many relief forces sent to defeat the Burgundians, the Swiss were unable to relieve the city from the siege, and Charles recaptured Grandson, executing all of the Bernese garrison as retaliation for Swiss brutality in Burgundian towns. On 1 March, Charles, expecting the Swiss army to march towards him for a battle, decided to leave Grandson and head northwards for a mountain pass north of the town of Concise. As he had foreseen, the Swiss army marched from Neuchâtel, with their vanguard, made up of eight thousand men, several hours ahead of the rest of their army. The vanguard reached the mountain pass first and surprised the Burgundian army.

Charles quickly rallied his troops, ordered his artillery to fire at the enemy lines, and then launched an attack. Meanwhile, the Swiss had knelt down to pray, which the Burgundians may have mistaken for submission, which only motivated the Burgundians more for the attack. The initial charge, commanded by , Lord of Grandson, failed to penetrate the Swiss defensive line, with Louis himself killed in the process. Charles then made a second attack. In order to lure the enemy further down the valley to give his artillery a better target, Charles soon retreated.

However, the rest of Charles&#x27;s army mistook his tactical retreat for a complete withdrawal. Around this time, the rest of the Swiss army had reached the valley, announcing their arrival by bellowing their horns. The Burgundians panicked and abandoned their positions, ignoring Charles&#x27;s pleas to stay in line. The panicking army even forsook their camp at Grandson, leaving it for the Swiss to capture. The Battle of Grandson became a humiliating defeat for Charles the Bold, as his army&#x27;s cowardice had caused him the loss of many valuable treasures and all of his artillery and supplies. For two or three days after the battle, Charles refused any food or drink. By 4 March, he began to reorganize his army in hopes of giving battle two weeks later.

=== Battle of Morat ===
Charles retreated to Lausanne, where he reorganised his army. He demanded more artillery and men-at-arms from his lands; in Dijon, anything made of metal was melted to make cannon; in occupied Lorraine, he confiscated all artillery. He received funds from all his allies, and men from Italy, Germany, England, and Poland came to join his army. At the end of May, he had amassed 20,000 men in Lausanne, outnumbering the local population. He trained these men from 14 to 26 May while he himself grew sicker by the day, resulting in stagnation among his troops. With the supply lines delayed, and the payment long overdue, Charles&#x27;s army had to cut costs. Many horse archers went on foot instead. The army, though magnificent in appearance, was incohesive and unstable.

On 27 May, Charles and his army began their slow march towards the fortress of Morat. His main objective was the city of Bern; to eliminate all support for the city, he first needed to conquer Morat. He arrived at Morat on 9 June and immediately besieged the fortress. By 19 June, after several assaults on the fortress and with several of its walls destroyed, Morat sent a message to Bern, asking for help. On 20 June, the (&quot;oath companion&quot;) arrived at Morat. The forces were larger than the army at Grandson; the Swiss commanders estimated themselves to be 30,000 men, while recent historians believe it was 24,000. Charles expected a decisive battle in the wake of 21 June but no attack came. The Swiss instead attacked the following day, 22 June, a holy day attributed to the Ten thousand martyrs, catching the slumbering Burgundians by surprise. Charles was too slow in organizing his troops for a counterattack: he himself tarried in putting on his armour, and before his men finished taking their positions, the Swiss army had already reached them. The Burgundian army soon abandoned their posts and fled for their lives.

The battle was a total victory for the Swiss, and a slaughter of the fleeing Burgundian army ensued. Many retreated into Lake Morat and drowned. Some climbed the walnut trees, and were shot dead with arquebuses and hand cannons. The Swiss showed no mercy to men who surrendered. They killed knights, soldiers, and high officials alike. Charles himself fled with his men and rode for days until he reached Gex, Ain. The Milanese ambassador, Panigarola, reported that Charles laughed and made jokes after his defeat at Morat. He refused to believe he was defeated and continued to think God was on his side.

== Death ==

=== Battle of Nancy ===

While Charles may have wanted to continue the war against the Swiss, his plans changed drastically when Nancy was reconquered by René II on 6 October. In need of money, Charles took a large loan from the Medici bank with which he assembled 10,000 hastily gathered men. The rest of his army consisted of the Italian mercenaries under the command of the , the Burgundian garrison in Nancy, and 8,000 reinforcements from the Netherlands. Charles arrived before Nancy at 11 October and by 22 October had begun bombarding the city walls. The siege continued throughout the harsh winter. Charles was hoping that he could enter the city before any of Rene&#x27;s allies came to raise the siege.

Meanwhile, René spent November and December negotiating with the Swiss to hire an army of mercenaries and with Louis XI to pay the Swiss. He was eventually successful with both and marched towards Nancy from Basel on 26 December with 9,000 Swiss mercenaries. Between 31 December and 3 January 1477, the Count of Campobasso and his Italian mercenaries deserted the Burgundians. They joined René and fought the Burgundians in the forthcoming battle.

On 5 January, in heavy snow, René and his army marched towards the Burgundian position. The snow obscured their movements, and they outflanked the Burgundian army by marching around towards their front, where Charles had not placed pickets. Around noon they attacked the Burgundians, whose artillery was too slow to engage with the quickly approaching army. Charles tried to rally his men, but to no avail, for the Burgundians were already fleeing from the battlefield. Meanwhile, the Alsatian and Swiss infantry encircled Charles and his horsemen. In the River Meurthe he fell from his horse, and was struck on his head with a halberd, which pierced his helmet and went into his skull. Half of the Burgundian army died during the battle or while retreating. Only those who escaped the fifty kilometers to Metz survived.

=== Burial ===
The corpse of Charles the Bold was found two days after the battle, when it was found lying on the ice-bound river, with half of his head frozen. It took a group consisting of Charles&#x27;s Roman valet, his Portuguese personal physician, his chaplain, Olivier de la Marche, and two of his bastard brothers to identify the corpse through a missing tooth, ingrown toenail, and long fingernails. His body was moved to Nancy with full honours, where it was displayed for five days. René buried him in the Saint-George collegiate church of Nancy. In Artois, people refused to believe he was dead; they believed he had escaped to Germany to undergo seven years of penance, and would reappear again.

Margaret of York, Charles&#x27;s wife, requested the return of his body, but René refused. Over 70 years after Charles&#x27;s death, on 22 September 1550, Charles V exhumed the body and brought it to Luxembourg to strengthen his claim over Burgundy. Three years later, Charles&#x27;s bones were again exhumed to their final resting place, the Church of Our Lady, Bruges, beside his daughter, Mary of Burgundy. In 1559, Philip II ordered the construction of a monument over the tomb of Charles, which was completed in 1563. Philip would hold masses for the repose of the soul of Charles and commemorated the date of his death, 5 January.

=== Aftermath ===

Louis XI learned of Charles&#x27;s death even before it reached Burgundy; he took advantage of the lack of leadership to invade Burgundy through Picardy, Artois, and Mâcon only three weeks after the Battle of Nancy. Ghent rose in rebellion, executing two of Charles&#x27;s closest collaborators, William Hugonet and Guy of Brimeu. Charles&#x27;s former conquests, Liége and Guelders, rapidly sought their independence, and in Luxembourg a struggle broke out about whether to recognize Mary of Burgundy as Charles&#x27;s successor. Sigismund of Austria and the Swiss vied for Franche-Comté; Holland, Zeeland, Frisia, and Hainault were claimed by the Count Palatine and the Duke of Bavaria.

Mary, the sole child of Charles, and Margaret of York, his widow, were confronted by a crisis. To secure her legitimacy as ruler, Mary signed the Great Privilege on 11 February 1477 and restored powers to the States General in Flanders, Brabant, Hainaut, and Holland. To secure an alliance with the Habsburgs, Mary married Maximilian, son of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, in August 1477. Maximilian used a combination of diplomacy and military strength to defend and regain territories from Louis XI, though France kept the geographic Duchy of Burgundy; he also quelled several internal revolts to preserve a great deal of the Burgundian State. Mary died on 27 March 1482, and passed her lands and the title of Duke of Burgundy to her son and heir, Philip.

== Historiography and legacy ==
Charles the Bold&#x27;s untimely death directly led to the sudden collapse of the Burgundian State. He had no legitimate male heir to succeed him and he did not provide a capable husband for his daughter that he could train and prepare for succession. He was obsessed with uniting the &quot;lands over there&quot; (Low Countries) and the &quot;lands over here&quot; (Burgundy proper) through Lorraine, and sought to forge a national identity independent from that of the French. He spent his few years as the Duke of Burgundy in securing a crown and forging a new kingdom to unite his subjects, and to enhance his own glory. However, his efforts inadvertently united his German enemies under the banner of a &quot;German nation&quot; opposing Charles, whom they called &quot;The Grand Turk of the West&quot;.

Charles&#x27;s death marks a significant moment in the modern history of Lorraine; in Nancy, the victory of René II is still remembered fondly. The Swiss victory at Morat was a confirmation of their national identity, a mark of pride, and a preservation of their independence. The Battle of Morat contributed to the decline of feudalism and heralded the end to the concept of chivalry. German-language historiography treats Charles ambivalently; he is seen both as a tragic representative of the fall of the Middle Ages, and as an immoral and flawed prince. Until recently, Swiss literature generally presented Charles negatively.

Charles&#x27;s death and the crisis of 1477 was an inspiration to two authors, Olivier de La Marche and , who wrote &quot;Le chevalier délibéré&quot; and &quot;Den droom van Rouere op die doot van hertoge Kaerle van Borgonnyen saleger gedachten&quot;, respectively, about his death. The hatred between Charles the Bold and Louis XI was an inspiration for the 17th-century French moralistic dialogues by authors such as François Fénelon, who in his &quot;Dialogues of the dead&quot; portrays Charles and Louis reconciling by drinking from the River Styx.

<text>Antoine Alexandre Barbier (11 January 1765 – 5 December 1825) was a French librarian and bibliographer.

He was born in Coulommiers (Seine-et-Marne). He took priest&#x27;s orders, from which, however, he was finally released by the pope in 1801. In 1794 he became a member of the temporary commission of the arts, and was charged with the duty of distributing among the various libraries of Paris the books that had been confiscated during the French Revolution. In the execution of this task he discovered the letters of Huet, bishop of Avranches, and the manuscripts of the works of Fénelon.

He became librarian successively to the French Directory, to the Conseil d&#x27;Etat, and in 1807 to Napoleon, from whom he carried out a number of commissions. He produced a standard work in his &quot;Dictionnaire des ouvrages anonymes et pseudonymes&quot; (4 vols., 1806—1809). Only the first part of his &quot;Examen critique des dictionnaires historiques&quot; (1820) was published.

He had a share in the foundation of the libraries of the Louvre, of Fontainebleau, of Compiègne and Saint-Cloud; under Louis XVIII he became administrator of the king&#x27;s private libraries, but in 1822 he was deprived of all his offices. Barbier died in Paris, aged 60.

<text>Henri Auguste Barbier (29 April 1805 – 13 February 1882) was a French dramatist and poet.

Barbier was born in Paris, France. He was inspired by the July Revolution and poured forth a series of eager, vigorous poems, denouncing the evils of the time. They are spoken of collectively as the &quot;Iambes&quot; (1831), though the designation is not strictly applicable to all. As the name suggests, they are modelled on the verse of André Chénier. They include &quot;La Curée&quot;, &quot;La Popularité&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Idole&quot;, &quot;Paris&quot;, &quot;Dante&quot;, &quot;Quatre-vingt-treize&quot; and &quot;Varsovie&quot;. The rest of Barbier&#x27;s poems are forgotten, and when, in 1869, he received the long delayed honour of admission to the Académie française, Montalembert expressed the general sentiment with &quot;Barbier? mais il est mort!,&quot; but actually he died at Nice in 1882.

Barbier collaborated with Léon de Wailly in the libretto of Berlioz&#x27; opera &quot;Benvenuto Cellini&quot;, and his works include two series of poems on the political and social troubles of Italy and England, printed in later editions of &quot;Iambes et poèmes&quot;.

<text>Louis Barbier (1593–1670), known as Abbé de la Rivière, was a French bishop, born in Vandélicourt, near Compiègne, France. He entered the church and made his way until he was appointed tutor and then became the friend and adviser of Gaston d&#x27;Orléans, brother of Louis XIII. He thus gained an entrance to the court, became grand almoner of the queen, and received the revenue of rich abbeys, such at Saint-Père-en-Vallée.

In March 1655 he was named bishop of Langres, but he spent his time at court, where he was always in demand, and where he gained great sums by gambling. He died very rich.

He willed 100 écus to the person who would write his epitaph, and got the following on his tomb:

<text>Balak son of Zippor ( &quot;Bālāq&quot;) was a king of Moab described in the Book of Numbers in the Hebrew Bible, where his dealings with the prophet and sorcerer Balaam are recounted. Balak tried to engage Balaam the son of Beor for the purpose of cursing the migrating Israelite community. On his journey to meet the princes of Moab, Balaam is stopped by an angel of the Lord after beating his female donkey. The Lord then &quot;opened the mouth of the donkey&quot; to tell him there was an angel with a drawn sword facing him. He tells the angel he will return home: &quot;I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood against me on the road&quot;. The angel instructs Balaam to attend the meeting with the princes of Moab but to &quot;say only what I tell you&quot;. According to Numbers 22:2, and Joshua 24:9, Balak was the son of Zippor.

In the preceding chapter of Numbers, the Israelites, seeking the Promised Land following their Exodus from Egypt, had defeated the Canaanites at a place named Hormah, as well as the Amorites and the people of Bashan, and next approached Moab. The biblical narrative stresses the fears of the people of Moab, who were &#x27;exceedingly afraid&#x27; and &#x27;sick with dread&#x27; (NKJV) or &#x27;terrified&#x27; (GNT). Their fears appear to relate to the size of the Israelite population and the consequent resource depletion which could be expected if they were permitted to occupy Moabite land.

Balak initially conferred with his Midianite allies in order to block Israelite settlement, before sending his elders (along with Midianite elders) to seek Balaam&#x27;s curse on them. The Midianites appear to have been co-located with the Moabites - according to the Targum of Jonathan, they were one alliance of people at this time and therefore had a common interest in preventing Israelite settlement of the area.

After his mission with Balaam to curse Israelites failed, Balak decided to ally with Midianites to gather their women in order to lead Israelites men astray in adultery.

Sources detailing the story of Balak:
* - This is the only time in the Bible that Balak is not mentioned in direct conjunction with Balaam. 

According to the Pulpit Commentary, Balak seems to be mentioned by name on a papyrus in the British Museum; Gardiner and Caminos, however, transcribe and translate this name as &quot;Baꜥalry&quot;. In 2019, Israel Finkelstein, Nadav Na&#x27;aman and Thomas Römer proposed the common reading of &quot;House of David&quot; in the Mesha Stele is actually &quot;Balak&quot;.

==The Zohar==

The Zohar, the basic text of the Kabbalah, offers a special interpretation to the Balak being &quot;The Son of Zippor&quot;. In Hebrew, &quot;Zippor&quot; (ציפור) means &quot;bird&quot;. According to the Zohar, this was not the name of Balak&#x27;s father but rather referred to a magical metal bird which Balak made use of. As the Zohar recounts, such a bird has a head made of gold, a mouth made of silver and wings made of copper mixed with silver, and its body is made of gold; once the bird is made, it should be put during the day in a window facing the Sun and during the night in a window facing the Moon, while burning incense in front of it for seven days and seven nights. Thereupon, the bird would start talking and foretelling of what is about to happen. Only the most skilled of wizards could construct such a bird. Balak, the greatest wizard of his age, managed it. The bird was always sitting on Balak&#x27;s shoulder and whispering in his ear, and therefore he was nicknamed &quot;Son of the Bird&quot;. The Zohar further recounts that the bird spoke true words of prophecy in Balak&#x27;s ear and warned him not to set himself against the Sons of Israel, and also foretold of the harsh punishment in store for himself and for the Moabits. Nevertheless, Balak persisted in his wrong way and was punished exactly as the bird foretold.

==New Testament==
Revelation 2:12 - 2:14 refers to Balak.

==Apocrypha==
Balak is mentioned in chapter 10 of 2 Meqabyan, a book considered canonical in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

==Weekly Torah Portion==
Balak is the name of the weekly parshah or portion in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading, constituting which tells the story of Balak.

== Etymology ==

There are various proposed etymologies for the name &quot;Balak&quot;, all having to do with children or &quot;waste&quot; - The name &quot;Balak&quot; is in modern times claimed to come from the sparsely used Hebrew verb (balaq), waste or lay waste (Isaiah 24:1,3; Jeremiah 51:2). There are no derivations of this verb besides this name. Other proposals are: Devastator (BDB Theological Dictionary), Empty (NOBS Study Bible Name List), or Wasting (Jones&#x27; Dictionary of Old Testament Proper Names).

<text>Giovanni Francesco Barbieri (February 8, 1591 – December 22, 1666), better known as (il) Guercino (), was an Italian Baroque painter and draftsman from Cento in the Emilia region, who was active in Rome and Bologna. The vigorous naturalism of his early manner contrasts with the classical equilibrium of his later works. His many drawings are noted for their luminosity and lively style.

==Biography==


Giovanni Francesco Barbieri was born into a family of peasant farmers in Cento, a town in the Po Valley mid-way between Bologna and Ferrara. Being cross-eyed, at an early age he acquired the nickname by which he is universally known, Guercino (a diminutive of the Italian noun , meaning &#x27;squinter&#x27;). Mainly self-taught, at the age of 16, he worked as apprentice in the shop of Benedetto Gennari, a painter of the Bolognese School. An early commission was for the decoration with frescos (1615–1616) of Casa Pannini in Cento, where the naturalism of his landscapes already reveals considerable artistic independence, as do his landscapes on canvas &quot;Moonlit Landscape&quot; and &quot;Country Concert&quot; from the same era. In Bologna, he was winning the praise of Ludovico Carracci. He always acknowledged that his early style had been influenced by study of a Madonna painted by Ludovico Carracci for the Capuchin church in Cento, affectionately known as &quot;La Carraccina&quot;.

&quot;St William Receiving the Monastic Habit&quot; (1620, Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna, Italy), painted for St Gregory Church in Bologna, was Guercino&#x27;s largest ecclesiastical commission at the time and is considered a high point of his early career.

His painting &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot; from around 1618–1622 contains the first known usage anywhere of the Latin motto, later taken up by Poussin and others, signifying that death lurks even in the most idyllic setting. The dramatic composition of this canvas (related to his &quot;Flaying of Marsyas by Apollo&quot; (1617–1618) created for The Grand Duke of Tuscany, which shares the same pair of shepherds) is typical of Guercino&#x27;s early works, which are often tumultuous in conception. He painted two large canvases, &quot;Samson Seized by Philistines&quot; (1619) and &quot;Elijah Fed by Ravens&quot; (1620), for Cardinal Serra, a Papal Legate to Ferrara. Painted at a time when it is unlikely that Guercino could have seen Caravaggio&#x27;s work in Rome, these works nevertheless display a starkly naturalistic Caravaggesque style.

==Rome==
Guercino was recommended by Marchese Enzo Bentivoglio to the newly elected Bolognese Ludovisi Pope, Pope Gregory XV in 1621. The years he spent in Rome, 1621–23, were very productive. From this period are his frescoes &quot;Aurora&quot; at the casino of the Villa Ludovisi, the ceiling in San Crisogono (1622) of &quot;San Chrysogonus in Glory&quot;, the portrait of Pope Gregory XV (now in the Getty Museum), and the &quot;St. Petronilla Altarpiece&quot; for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican (now in the Museo Capitolini).

==Return to Bologna==
Following the death of Gregory XV in 1623, Guercino returned to his hometown of Cento. In 1626, he began his frescoes in the Duomo of Piacenza. The details of his career after 1629 are well documented in the account book, the &quot;Libro dei Conti di Casa Barbieri&quot;, that Guercino and his brother Paolo Antonio Barbieri, a notable painter of still lifes, kept updated, and which has been preserved. Between 1618 and 1631, Giovanni Battista Pasqualini produced 67 engravings that document the early production of Guercino, which is not included in the &quot;Libro dei Conti&quot;. In 1642, following the death of his commercial rival Guido Reni, Guercino moved his busy workshop to Bologna, where he was now able to take over Reni&#x27;s role as the city&#x27;s leading painter of sacred subjects. In 1655, the Franciscan Order of Reggio paid him 300 ducats for the altarpiece of &quot;Saint Luke Displaying a Painting of the Madonna and Child&quot; (now in Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City). The Corsini also paid him 300 ducats for the &quot;Flagellation of Christ&quot; painted in 1657.
==Style==
Guercino was remarkable for the extreme rapidity of his executions: he completed no fewer than 106 large altarpieces for churches, and his other paintings amount to about 144. He was also a prolific draftsman. His production includes many drawings, usually in ink, washed ink, or red chalk. Most of them were made as preparatory studies for his paintings, but he also drew landscapes, genre subjects, and caricatures for his own enjoyment. Guercino&#x27;s drawings are known for their fluent style in which &quot;rapid, calligraphic pen strokes combined with dots, dashes, and parallel hatching lines describe the forms&quot;.

Despite presumably having monocular vision due to a &#x27;lazy&#x27; right eye, Guercino showed remarkable facility to imply depth in his works, perhaps assisted by an enhanced perception of light and shade thanks to compensation by the healthy eye. Other artists with different types of strabismus include Rembrandt, Dürer, Degas, Picasso and (possibly) Leonardo da Vinci.

His lively treatment of the Aurora myth (1621, Villa Aurora, Rome, Italy), painted for the pope&#x27;s nephew, Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi. challenges the more measured representation of the same subject painted by Guido Reni at Palazzo Rospigliosi on behalf of a Ludovisi family rival and makes a statement of political triumph. Some of his later works are closer to the style of Reni, and are painted with much greater luminosity and clarity than his early works with their prominent use of chiaroscuro. 

==Pupils==
Guercino continued to paint and teach until the end of his life, amassing a notable fortune. He died on December 22, 1666, in Bologna. As he never married, his estate passed to his nephews and pupils, Benedetto Gennari II and Cesare Gennari. Other pupils include Giulio Coralli, Giuseppe Bonati of Ferrara, Cristoforo Serra of Cesena, Father Cesare Pronti of Ferrara, Sebastiano Ghezzi, Sebastiano Bombelli, Lorenzo Bergonzoni of Bologna, Francesco Paglia of Brescia., Benedetto Zallone of Cento, Bartolomeo Caravoglia, Giuseppe Maria Galeppini of Forli, and Matteo Loves.

==Works==

== Exhibitions ==
A groundbreaking exhibition held at the Archiginnasio of Bologna in 1968 provided the most complete panorama of Guercino&#x27;s work to date, including paintings from the later parts of his career after the death of Pope Gregory XV, which had previously attracted relatively little attention. For the fourth centenary of the artist&#x27;s birth in 1991, an expanded exhibition was organized by the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna in conjunction with the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt and the National Gallery of Art, Washington. Both these exhibitions were curated by Guercino&#x27;s biggest modern champion, Denis Mahon, who was responsible for their catalogues. In 2011–2012, a large exhibition was displayed at Palazzo Barberini in Rome, dedicated to the memory of Mahon, who had recently died. An exhibition displayed at the National Museum in Warsaw in 2013–2014 offered another extensive presentation of the artist&#x27;s work.

<doc id="151336" wikidata="Q1630744" url="?curid=151336" title="Musical bow">
<text>The musical bow (bowstring or string bow, a subset of bar zithers) is a simple string instrument used by a number of African peoples as well as Indigenous peoples of the Americas. It consists of a flexible, usually wooden, stick 1.5 to 10 feet (0.5 to 3 m) long, and strung end to end with a taut cord, usually metal. It can be played with the hands or a wooden stick or branch. It is uncertain if the musical bow developed from the hunting bow, though the San or Bushmen people of the Kalahari Desert do convert their hunting bows to musical use.

Types of bow include mouth-resonated string bow, earth-resonated string bow, and gourd-resonated string bow.

== History ==

There is speculation that the hunting bow may have been used as a musical instrument from as early as circa 13,000 B.C. Henri Breuil surveyed the Trois Frères in France caves and made an engraving that attempted to reproduce a c. 13,000 B.C. cave painting into a black-and-white lithograph engraving. His engraving showed a mysterious figure, a &quot;man camouflaged to resemble a bison,&quot; in the midst of a mass of herd-animals, &quot;herding the beasts and playing the musical bow.&quot; The artwork is confused, and those who are trying to reproduce the art in color have had to work to bring out legible images. One interpretation of the &quot;magician-hunter&quot; image considers his hunting-bow to be a musical bow, used as a single-stringed musical instrument.

Whether the bow in the cave illustration is a musical instrument or the hunting tool in a paleolithic hunt, musicologists have considered whether the bow could be a possible relative or ancestor to the chordophone: the lute, lyre, harp, and zither family. Curt Sachs said that there was good reason not to consider &quot;hunters&#x27; bows&quot; as likely musical bows. One reason was that the oldest known musical bows were 10 feet long, useless for hunting, and that &quot;musical bows were not associated with hunters&#x27; beliefs and ceremonies.&quot; Sachs considered the musical bows important, however. He pointed out that the name for the Greek lute, &quot;pandura&quot; was likely derived from &quot;pan-tur&quot;, a Sumerian word meaning &quot;small bow.&quot; He considered this evidence in support of the theory that the musical bow was ancestral to the pierced lute.

The bows used for music required a resonator, a hollowed object like a bowl, a gourd, or a musician&#x27;s mouth, in order to produce audible sound. Although the musical bow could be manipulated to produce more than one tone, instruments were developed from it that used one note per string. Since each string played a single note, adding strings added new notes for instrument families such as bow harps, harps, and lyres. In turn, this led to being able to play dyads and chords. Another innovation occurred when the bow harp was straightened out and a bridge used to lift the strings off the stick-neck, creating the lute.
Musical bows are still used in a number of cultures today. It can be found as far south as Eswatini, and as far east as eastern Africa, Madagascar, and Réunion. and also outside of Africa, as in the case of berimbau, malunga (derivations of the African musical bow) or the Appalachian mouth-bow.

== Playing ways ==

The usual way to make the bow sound is to pluck the string, although sometimes a subsidiary bow is used to scrape the string, much as on a violin. The Onavillu of Kerala sounds when struck with a thin stick. Unlike string instruments used in classical music, however, they do not have a built-in resonator, although resonators may be made to work with the bow in a number of ways.

The most usual type of resonator consists of a gourd attached to the back of the string bearer. The bow may also be stood in a pit or gourd on the ground, or one end of it may be partially placed in the mouth. This last method allows the size of the resonator to be varied as the instrument is played, thus allowing a melody to be heard consisting of the notes resonating in the player&#x27;s mouth. As well as these various forms of resonators, the bow is frequently played without a resonator at all.

In Africa, the musical bow is usually played by a solo performer. In capoeira, the berimbau is played as part of the roda, a musical group standing in a circle, in the centre of which the capoeiristas perform or play. The Appalachian mouth-bow can be played amplified in old-time music jams.

== In Africa ==
&quot;See&quot;: Uhadi musical bow &quot;See&quot;:Umuduri

Due to the nature of their construction and playing, musical bows are quiet instruments, therefore needing a resonator to resound. The resonator can either be a gourd (as in &quot;uhadi&quot;, &quot;umakhweyana&quot;, &quot;segankure&quot;, &quot;xitende&quot;, &quot;berimbau&quot;, etc.) or the player&#x27;s mouth (as in &quot;umrhubhe&quot;, &quot;umqangala&quot;, &quot;tshihwana&quot;, &quot;xizambi&quot;, etc.)

Musical bows are the main instruments of the Nguni and Sotho people, the predominant peoples of South Africa. Historians believe that many of the musical bows came from Khoisan peoples. Although there are many differences between musical bows, all of them share two things: a resonator, and at least two fundamental notes.

The strongest notes are the fundamentals, the deepest notes produced by the string, whereas the higher notes (the harmonic partials) are produced by the resonator.

There are at least two fundamental notes produced by all musical bows, an &quot;open&quot; (when the player does not shorten it or touch it) and a &quot;closed&quot; (where the string is shortened or stopped by the player&#x27;s hand). In Xhosa they are called &quot;vu&quot; (from the word &quot;Vuliwe&quot;, &#x27;open&#x27;) and &quot;ba&quot; (from &quot;Banjiwe&quot;, &#x27;held&#x27;) respectively. These two notes can already be on the string, if it is divided or stopped by a string attached to the gourd, as in the case of &quot;umakhweyana&quot;, &quot;xitende&quot;, &quot;berimbau&quot;, &quot;hungu&quot;, etc. The pitch difference between a &quot;vu&quot; and a &quot;ba&quot; is usually about a whole tone. In certain places, it can be closer to a semitone (e.g. Zulu) or closer to a minor third (Tsonga).

Some of those instruments have more than two notes, for example the Zulu &quot;umakhweyana&quot; and the Tsonga &quot;xitende&quot; have three, whereas the Venda &quot;tshihwana&quot; has four.

The most popular musical bow today is the Brazilian adaptation of the musical bow, the berimbau, most commonly associated with the jogo de capoeira.

Kse diev, a gourd resonated &quot;musical bow cum stick&quot; whose string is made out of copper, is used in Cambodia and is considered one of the oldest Cambodian instruments, with bas-reliefs going back to the 12th century AD. Has been thought of as musical bow; under Hornbostel-Sachs classification, it is a &quot;Musical bow cum stick&quot; because it has only one curved end to flex. Under Hornbostel-Sachs, musical bows are defined as flexible and curved string bearers or as stick zithers with both ends flexible and curved.
Malunga, a musical bow made of bamboo, gut strings, and a coconut gourd is used by the Siddi people of India, of African origin.

Belembaotuyan is found in Guam, probably introduced through trade between South America and Asia in the nineteenth century.

In the Caribbean, on the island of Curaçao, the benta is a one-stringed musical bow, played using the mouth as a resonating chamber. Most probably brought to the island by Africans from Ghana, Angola, Nigeria during the slave trade, it is played as a leading instrument in &quot;muzik di zumbi&quot;, ghost music (zumbi means ghost).
The name refers to the spooky atmosphere on the plantations since there was no electricity, and the hauling wind carries the sound of the music in all directions. 
It is mostly accompanied by drum, hoe and &quot;wiri&quot; (scraper of a serrated piece of iron). 
The Curaçaoan benta resembles the Brazilian berimbao, the Indian malunga, the Hawaiïan ukeke, and string bows of several African countries.

A variant called the &quot;whizzing bow&quot;, which is swung with the arm in a circle is played in Central America, China, Indonesia, and west Africa.

<text>Mary of Burgundy (; ; 13 February 1457 – 27 March 1482), nicknamed the Rich, was a member of the House of Valois-Burgundy who ruled the Burgundian lands, comprising the Duchy and County of Burgundy and the Burgundian Netherlands, from 1477 to her death. 

As the only child of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, and his wife Isabella of Bourbon, Mary inherited the Burgundian lands at the age of 19 upon the death of her father in the Battle of Nancy on 5 January 1477. In order to counter the appetite of the French king Louis XI for her lands, she married Maximilian of Austria, with whom she had two children. The marriage kept large parts of the Burgundian lands from disintegration, but also changed the dynasty from Valois to Habsburg (the Duchy of Burgundy itself soon became a French possession). This was a turning point in European politics, leading to a French–Habsburg rivalry that would endure for centuries. Long after Mary&#x27;s death, her husband became Holy Roman Emperor. Their son became King Philip I of Castile, and their daughter, Margaret, became Duchess of Savoy.

==Early years==
Mary of Burgundy was born in Brussels at the ducal castle of Coudenberg, to Charles the Bold, then known as the Count of Charolais, and his wife Isabella of Bourbon. Her birth, according to the court chronicler Georges Chastellain, was attended by a clap of thunder ringing from the otherwise clear twilight sky. Her godfather was Louis, Dauphin of France, in exile in Burgundy at that time; he named her for his mother Marie of Anjou. Reactions to the child&#x27;s birth were mixed: the baby&#x27;s grandfather, Duke Philip the Good, was unimpressed, and &quot;chose not to attend the [baptism] as it was only for a girl&quot;, whereas her grandmother Isabella of Portugal was delighted at the birth of a granddaughter. Her illegitimate aunt Anne was assigned to be responsible for Mary&#x27;s education and assigned Jeanne de Clito to be her governess. Jeanne remained a friend to Mary later in life and was one of her most constant companions.

==Heir presumptive==
Philip the Good died in 1467 and Mary&#x27;s father assumed control of the Burgundian State. Since her father had no living sons at the time of his accession, Mary became his heir presumptive. Her father controlled a vast and wealthy domain made up of the Duchy of Burgundy, the Free County of Burgundy, and the majority of the Low Countries. As a result, her hand in marriage was eagerly sought by a number of princes. The first proposal was received by her father when she was only five years old, in this case to marry the future King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Later she was approached by Charles, Duke of Berry; his older brother, King Louis XI of France, was intensely annoyed by Charles&#x27;s move and attempted to prevent the necessary papal dispensation for consanguinity.

As soon as Louis succeeded in producing a male heir who survived infancy, the future King Charles VIII of France, Louis wanted him to be the one to marry Mary, even though he was thirteen years younger than Mary. Nicholas I, Duke of Lorraine, was nine years older than Mary and controlled a duchy that lay alongside Burgundian territory, but his plan to combine his domain with hers was ended by his death in 1473 (he started having stomach pains three days before his death; poison was suspected). Another suitor was George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence (supported by his sister Margaret of York, Mary&#x27;s stepmother), but his brother Edward IV, King of England, prevented the match for both political and personal reasons (he initially wanted to support his brother-in-law Anthony Woodville). The king&#x27;s move angered the duke, who seemed to lose control and restarted conflicts with his brother, which ultimately led to his death.

==Reign==
Mary assumed the rule of her father&#x27;s domains upon his defeat in battle and death on 5 January 1477. In addition to the Duchy and County of Burgundy, her territories included the duchies of Limburg, Brabant, Luxembourg, and the counties of Namur, Holland, Hainaut. King Louis XI of France seized the opportunity to attempt to take possession of the Duchy of Burgundy proper and also the regions of Franche-Comté, Picardy and Artois.

She called on her people to stay loyal to the house of Burgundy (there are still extant letters that Mary wrote to the Duchy of Burgundy and Arras asking for their support). Louis XI took over Arras, but the people refused to submit without her approval. Eighteen burgesses were decapitated by the king as they were discovered trying to go to see her. He ordered a mass expulsion and renamed the town Franchise.

The king of France was anxious that Mary should marry his son Charles and thus secure the inheritance of the Low Countries for his heirs, by force of arms if necessary. By February 1477, neither her advisors nor the States General imagined that they could resist the French army. Chancellor Hugonet led a delegation to discuss the prospect of Mary&#x27;s marriage to the six-year-old Dauphin (later King Charles VIII). The negotiation ended in failure as Louis XI demanded unacceptable terms, including the surrender of the Duchy of Burgundy and the French territories acquired by Philip the Good and Charles the Bold. The king then betrayed her secret letters to the burghers of Ghent, who then seized two men who were named in those letters – Hugonet and the Sire d&#x27;Humbercourt, two of her father&#x27;s most influential councilors, and despite her pleadings, executed them on 3 April 1477. They then took away her other advisors too. Koenigsberger suspects that Louis XI might have forged the letters.

===The Great Privilege===
Mary was compelled to sign a charter of rights known as the Great Privilege in Ghent on 10 February 1477, the occasion of her formal recognition as her father&#x27;s heir (the &quot;Joyous Entry&quot;). Under this agreement, the provinces and towns of Flanders, Brabant, Hainaut, and Holland recovered all the local and communal rights that had been abolished by the decrees of the dukes of Burgundy in their efforts to create a centralised state on the French model out of their disparate holdings in the Low Countries. In particular, the Parliament of Mechelen (established formally by Charles the Bold in 1470) was abolished and replaced with the pre-existing authority of the Parlement of Paris, which was considered an amenable counterweight to the encroaching centralisation undertaken by both Charles the Bold and Philip the Good. The duchess also had to undertake not to declare war, make peace, or raise taxes without the consent of these provinces and towns and only to employ native residents in official posts. The Great Privilege also determined that Nederlands would be the language of the joint States-General.

===Marriage===

Mary soon made her choice among the many suitors for her hand by selecting Archduke Maximilian of Austria (future Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I), who became her co-ruler. The marriage took place at Ghent on 19 August 1477, she was 20 years old, while he was two years younger. Mary&#x27;s marriage into the House of Habsburg initiated two centuries of contention between France and the Habsburgs, a struggle that climaxed with the War of the Spanish Succession in the years 1701–1714.
When they had time, the couple indulged themselves with dancing, hunting, music and the love for animals. Mary tried to teach him iceskating, which he struggled to master. They read romances together. Soon after the wedding, she brought falcons into their bedroom (which they shared instead of living in separate apartments, and which already had a dog). Mary nursed the children herself, ordered the menus and dined out with merchants from Dijon. Mary cheered for her husband in tournaments, during which he proved a magnificent jouster, not just in feats of strength but in the luxury he lavished on the equipments, horses, accessories and ornaments as well. At first, they talked to each other in Latin.

According to Haemers and Sutch, the original marriage contract stipulated that Maximilian could not inherit her Burgundian lands if they had children – this means that, the fact the couple produced heirs would give Maximilian troubles later. Some report that the original marriage contract stipulated that only common children of Mary and Maximilian could claim her Burgundian inheritance after her death. But one month after their marriage, she made an amendment that designated Maximilian as the heir in the case they had no children - a clause that the estates would try to repudiate after her death.

===Co-rule with Maximilian===

With Maximilian by her side, Mary&#x27;s position became stronger, politically and militarily. Although he came with no money nor army, nor support from the Empire, and no prior experience in governance, his competence in military matters and his prestige as the son of an emperor boosted the stability of her realms. He took over the war effort, concerning both military and financial details.

By this time, the Burgundian side had lost a lot of military captains owing to defections to France both before and after Charles the Bold&#x27;s death. The loss of the Duchy of Burgundy cut down the whole government&#x27;s backbone, consisting of high administrators and military commanders who came from the French-speaking nobility in Burgundy and Picardy. Philip of Cleves, her cousin and childhood friend (who had been put forth as a bridegroom candidate for Mary by his father Adolf of Cleves; Mary and Philip were rumoured to be former love interests, although this is disputed by Arie de Fouw), whom she appointed as Stadtholder-General in 1477, now acted as Maximilian&#x27;s lieutenant as Admiral of the Netherlands. Despite the reputation of the Burgundian court as luxurious and rich, Charles the Bold had lost his whole fortune in his last three disastrous campaigns. The Low Countries were rich but the Estates were reluctant to pay. Moreover, the Burgundian state had lost one quarter of its tax revenue and due to new restrictions, a half of its government revenue in total. Thus the initial financial situation was very tense and Mary had to pawn a lot of her heirlooms to finance their armies. She also had to yield to the estates&#x27; demands regarding some of their privileges, in exchange for final support for Maximilian&#x27;s war against France.

Violet Soen shows that by political manipulation, Mary managed to tie the powerful Croÿ family to the crown.

Mary would not gain back the Duchy of Burgundy, occupied by the French king, but she was able to keep her remaining lands intact. In 1478–1479, Maximilian carried out a campaign against the French and reconquered Le Quesnoy, Conde and Antoing. He defeated the French forces at Guinegate (modern Enguinegatte), on 7 August 1479. Despite winning, he had to abandon the siege of Thérouanne and disband his army, either because the Netherlanders did not want him to become too strong or because his treasury was empty. In addition, he proved as ruthless as Charles in suppressing rebellions in the Low Countries. When conflicts broke out again between the Hooks and the Cods, the archduke was able to put the conflict under control and assured the Cod domination, disregarding the Great Privilege in the process. After a five-year hiatus (because most of the members had either died in Charles the Bold&#x27;s wars or defected to France), the Order of the Golden Fleece also got reorganized by Maximilian, as the new sovereign of the order.

However, within the marriage, Mary retained her political primacy. Her subjects looked at Maximilian&#x27;s foreigner status and his military ambitions with suspicion. They feared that he would prolong the war to regain the Duchy of Burgundy, and also that new successes would strengthen him and make him a second coming of Charles the Bold, whose legacy had left them with a feeling of distaste – a fear that would prove not unreasonable, considering his autocratic and militaristic tendencies during his later regency. Moreover, according to Philippe de Commines, Maximilian was too young, in a foreign land, had been &quot;brought up very badly&quot; and thus did not have the slightest idea how to conduct affairs of the state. Mary and Margaret tried to teach him French and Dutch but he proved a lazy student. Mary accompanied Maximilian on his many journeys, acting as the buffer between the German-speaking prince and their subjects. According to Juan Luis Vives, a near contemporary author, when her subjects approached her on political matters, she would consult her husband &quot;whose will she regarded as law&quot;, but she was always able to administer everything according to her own wishes and Maximilian, a mild husband, would never oppose her will. She managed internal affairs and attended all assemblies where the couple needed to raise revenue. Burgundian coinage showed that Maximilian was never endowed with the official rank that contemporary royal husbands such as Ferdinand of Aragon achieved in their wives&#x27; possessions. Apparently, she could impose her will on her spouse in military matters as well, as shown in the two times she tried to do this. In one case, recounted by Maximilian in the manuscript of the &quot;Weisskunig&quot;, his advisors tried to prevent him from unleashing war against a stronger French army who had concentrated at the front, but he was determined to carry it out. The advisors asked for help from Mary, who told him he could go but should come back to say farewell to her first. When he went back, she had him promptly locked up in his own apartment. After long negotiations, he agreed to go dancing instead and was let out. In her official images and presentation, she was presented as an active, commanding ruler, usually on horseback and with a hawk. She adopted a more pacifistic image than her father, but her position as the rightful ruler was emphasized while Maximilian, armored and armed, tended to be shown behind his wife. This was in contrast with the profile portraits that Maximilian commissioned during his later reign as emperor, where she was often shown as the passive side.

In order to bolster support for the government, she focused the most on public appearances, especially public shows of piety.

The 1482 winter was harsh and France had declared a salt blockade, but the political situation in the Netherlands was overall positive; the French aggression was temporarily checked, and internal peace was in large measure restored.

Towards the end of her rule, there was an event that exarcebated the division between the central government and other factions: the murder of Jehan (or Jan) van Dadizeele, on 20 October 1481. At the time, there were angry accusations against Maximilian and Filips van Horne (1421-1488),Lord of Gaasbeek, one of his closest counsellors. In 2023, a letter written by Frederik van Horn and preserved at the &quot;Gelders Archief&quot; (found by Haemers and van Driel) shows that van Horn was the person who committed the murder. According to van Horn, after the murder of Dadizeele, Mary wrote a letter to him, declaring that Dadizeele was a villain and a traitor who tried to replace her and Maximilian&#x27;s faithful servants with the people he chose, as he saw fit, and that she would see the killing as revenge for herself. Haemers opines that she herself seemed to be preparing to kill Dadizeele (in the case van Horn was honest about Mary&#x27;s letter – at the time, he was trying to justify his act and get a pardon), but in reality, was not the perpetrator. Ultimately, Mary chose to pardon and defend Frederik van Horn. This decision would later help to lead to the Flemish revolts against Maximilian (1482–1492).

==Death and legacy==

In 1482, a falcon hunt in the woods near Wijnendale Castle was organised by Adolph of Cleves, Lord of Ravenstein, who lived in the castle. Mary loved riding and was hunting with Maximilian and knights of the court when her horse tripped, threw her in a ditch, and then landed on top of her, breaking her back. She died several weeks later on 27 March from internal injuries, having made a detailed will. She was buried in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges on 3 April 1482. She was pregnant.

Maximilian was devastated. She had initially hidden the extent of her injury to calm him down. When he continued to display uncontrollable grief, she had to force him out of her chamber so that she could discuss matters of the state with her nobles, concerning which she asked them to keep their loyalty oath to him and their children. Maximilian was not present when she said her last words.

The bankrupted court honoured her with a glorious funeral, as Maximilian melted down the silverware for the occasion.

Her two-year-old daughter, Margaret of Austria, was sent in vain to France, to marry the Dauphin, in an attempt to please Louis XI and persuade him not to invade the territories owned by Mary.

Louis was swift to re-engage hostilities with Maximilian and forced him to agree to the Treaty of Arras of 1482, by which Franche-Comté and Artois passed for a time to French rule, only to be recovered by the Treaty of Senlis of 1493, which established peace in the Low Countries. Mary&#x27;s marriage into the House of Habsburg proved to be a disaster for France because the Burgundian inheritance later brought it into conflict with Spain and the Holy Roman Empire.

In 1493, Emperor Frederick III died. Maximilian became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Empire and relinquished control of the Netherlands to his and Mary&#x27;s son Philip. By this time, rebellions against Maximilian&#x27;s authority had been subdued by force and a strong ducal monarchy was established. He made sure that during their son&#x27;s inauguration, Philip confirmed only the rights granted to territories by the time of Philip the Good.

Olga Karaskova summarizes scholarly opinions on Mary&#x27;s rule as follows:

In 2019, she was added to the Canon of the Netherlands. The committee headed by James Kennedy explained that, &quot;her Habsburg marriage determined the international position of the Netherlands for centuries.&quot; and that &quot;her personality and the leniency of her government&quot; preserved &quot;the unity of the core regions of the Burgundian Netherlands.&quot;, even if most of the functions of the head of state were carried out by the energetic husband.

Maximilian tended to describe Mary as the Grand Dame, who could stand next to him as sovereigns. The devotion the people of the Low Countries had towards Mary (often idealized as earthly representation of the Virgin Mary) helped Maximilian, their children and the central government in the turbulent period following her death.

==In arts and popular culture==

===Arts and legends under the rule of Mary, Maximilian and the Habsburgs===
*The Faust legend is strongly based on a legend involving Mary, Maximilian and the priest, abbot and humanist Johannes Trithemius (1462–1516), who was suspected by many to be a necromancer. Through his 1507 account, Trithemius was the first author who mentioned the historical Doctor Faustus. Being summoned to the emperor&#x27;s court in 1506 and 1507, he also helped to &quot;prove&quot; Maximilian&#x27;s Trojan origins. In his 1569 edition of his Tischreden, Martin Luther writes about a magician and necromancer (understood to be Trithemius) who summoned Alexander the Great and other ancient heroes, as well as the emperor&#x27;s deceased wife Mary of Burgundy, to entertain Maximilian. In his 1585 account, Augustin Lercheimer (1522–1603) writes that after Mary&#x27;s death, Trithemius was summoned to console a devastated Maximilian. Trithemius conjured a shade of Mary, who looked exactly like her likeness when alive. Maximilian also recognized a birthmark on her neck, that only he knew about. He was distraughted by the experience though, and ordered Trithemius never to do it again. An anonymous account in 1587 modified the story into a less sympathetic version. The emperor became Charles V, who, despite knowing about the risk of black magic, ordered Faustus to raise Alexander and his wife from death. Charles saw that the woman had a birthmark, that he had heard about. Later, the woman in the most well-known story became Helen of Troy.
In her lifetime, Mary&#x27;s preferred symbols, which were often associated with her official image, were the falcon and the horse. Ann M.Roberts notes that the falcon seemed to be a substitute for the sword (which was used by her grandfather and father for their seals), that denoted her status and prowess and also seemingly equated her skills as a huntress with her husband&#x27;s skills as a military leader. Also according to Roberts, the posthumous portraits produced during her husband&#x27;s later reign (which were much more numerous) show a completely different image: he tended to utilize the profile portraits that portrayed her as a young (with less personal features and only recognizable by her items, such as the &quot;hennin&quot;, the brocaded garment, necklaces and brooches), virtuous, pious, passive bride whose wealth he possessed and could do with as he wanted and for whom he constructed a mythology of romantic love between the two.

Olga Karaskova also opines that the manner she was placed in the premier position and her seal superimposed on his in their seals seems to indicate the conception she had of herself and the way she wanted to be seen by her contemporaries. During Maximilian&#x27;s later reign, he commissioned numerous portrayals of Mary for various purposes. According to Karaskova, the symbol of the falcon did not disappear, but returned as Maximilian needed to assert his and their descendants&#x27; right of inheritance. In public portraits, the image of Mary holding a falcon returned once during the inauguration of Charles V. In addition, Maximilian commissioned portraits of Philip the Fair and Charles V holding falcons (thus establishing a connection between them and Mary), so he had to depend on the iconography created by Mary and associated with her, that had not been erased from the memory of their contemporaries. In the &quot;Old Prayer Book of Maximilian of Austria&quot; (&quot;l&#x27;Ancien livre de prières de Maximilien d&#x27;Autriche&quot;, 1486, Vienne, ÖNB, Cod. 1907, f. 61v), there are the depiction of three falcons that seemingly symbolize Mary, Philip the Fair and Maximilian: Mary was with Philip while Maximilian was chasing another bird, symbolically protecting wife and child, next to the German eagle and the combined coat-of-arms of the Houses of Austria and Burgundy. Maximilian also had a tendency to virtually &quot;promote&quot; Mary to the status of Empress in these posthumous portrayals: an image created by Jörg Kölderer in preparation for Mary&#x27;s statue in Maximilian&#x27;s cenotaph showed a coat-of-arms that incorporated her husband&#x27;s symbols as King of the Romans or Holy Roman Emperor (that she could not have used in life).

There was also a type of iconography created for the emperor&#x27;s private use (instead of being used as a political declaration to the public), created by Bernhard Strigel: Mary, also presented in the imperial style as his empress, queen Ehrenreich and eternal companion, was shown with falcons outside the window and a hunting scene on her corsage, which seemed to imply courtly love and the days of happiness for the emperor. This iconography also seemed to be connected to the diptych &quot;Portrait of Emperor Maximilian and his family&quot; by Bernhard Strigel (mentioned below).
In the &quot;Book of Hours of Mary and Maximilian&quot; (Berlin, SM, Kupferstichkabinett, Ms. 78 B 12, f. 220v.), the falcon and the hunt scene were shown, not as display of political significance, but only tragedy. Karaskova suggests that the coincidence that combined the Duchess&#x27;s favourite mode of portrayal and the manner of her death must have had an impact on the illustrator as well as the commissioner, in this case Maximilian. According to the documentary &quot;Der letzte Ritter&quot; by Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), in his conversations with their daughter Margaret, the emperor associated the call of the falcon with &quot;the blackest day of his life&quot; (he remained a passionate falconer though – In his cenotaph, where there are also Mary&#x27;s and his statues, the belt of Mary&#x27;s grandfather, Philip the Good, displays the image of a male falconer and a female falconer).
Karaskova comments that the type of profile portraits that Roberts considers to be the products of Maximilian&#x27;s preferences (which also presented her as youthful and wealthy) seemed to have existed and been copied since her lifetime and connected her to her ancestors, especially Philip the Bold, who also had such profile portraits. After his marriage to Bianca Maria in 1494, Maximilian also presented himself with both of his wives simultaneously. There was a notable tendency, expressed most clearly in the representations of genealogical trees (one commissioned in 1497, and another ten years later): outwardly, the group looked united, but Maximilian turned his back on Bianca to face the mother of his children (Unterholzner also notes that Maximilian always concentrated on the children of his first marriage in terms of succession politics, despite the fact that this was very risky; later, as the mother of his only (legitimate) children, Mary of Burgundy only became more important).
Later, her children Philip and Margaret preferred to utilize the images of the undisputed dukes (which were shown in public spaces) instead of those of the disputed duchess to consolidate their rule, but that does not mean they displayed emotional disavowal towards her, as shown by the famous diptych commissioned by Margaret to commemorate her mother and created by Jan Mostaert in 1520. Charles V, however, focused on his paternal ancestors, especially on Maximilian and Mary as true progenitors of his house.
The falcon also returned and her role as Duchess of Burgundy was also highlighted.
*The massive semi-autobiographical works (commissioned by Maximilian, who was also likely their main author) like the epic poems &quot;Theuerdank&quot; and &quot;Freydal&quot;, and the chivalric novel &quot;Weisskunig&quot; are in parts tribute to their love and marriage. As Queen Ehrenreich (Rich in Honour) in &quot;Theuerdank&quot;, Mary urged the knight Theuerdank (Noble Thought, alter ego of Maximilian) to go on a crusade.

Even during her lifetime, she became the centre of a cult that associated her with the Virgin Mary. It was not unusual for young women to be associated with the Virgin back then, but the similarity in their name made it easier and more provoking in the case of Mary. After her death, both Maximilian and her Burgundian subjects dedicated much artworks and propaganda to this cult.
*In the Book of Hours of Mary of Burgundy (1477), which was commissioned for her (likely first by Margaret of York and then by Maximilian, who as a new husband or new father, began to celebrate his wife and son as the images of the Virgin and Jesus), the Virgin has a notable role. An image that attracts scholarly debate is the portrayal of Mary sitting at a window-ledge imagining or having a mystical vision in which she herself and her ladies in waiting kneeling before the Virgin and the infant Christ. The Virgin here is the pivot of overlapping devotional function of the Book and the rosary. This is also an early example of the association between Mary of Burgundy and the Virgin Mary. Natalie Harris Bluestone opines that even though this association started during her lifetime, it seemed to be motivated by others. Glenn Burger remarks that, &quot;bringing the bodily Mary of Burgundy alongside her imagined devotional self and her spiritual counterpart, the Virgin Mary, moves us beyond things as they are into a teleological mode of reading that stabilizes temporal and spatial relations in ideologically satisfying ways.&quot; The motif of the dog, later seen many times in depictions of Mary and Maximilian (together or separately), for example as part of her sarcophagus or in Maximilian&#x27;s First Prayer Book, also seemed to first appeared here.

Noa Turel argues that Mary and her step-mother Margaret of York did willingly join the courtly &quot;theater of devotion&quot; that cast Margaret as Saint Anne and Mary as the Virgin, which are demonstrated by their actions and their self-insertions in the manuscripts associated with the Baptism of Philip the Fair (whose claims to territories through matrilineal inheritance would be strengthened through this association, which also cast him as the infant Jesus). Turel opines that the reason the chronicler Olivier de la Marche only offered a brief description of this important event was that as &quot;Premier maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;, he likely had to accompany Maximilian to the battlefield at the time of the baptism.
*In Jean Molinet&#x27;s &quot;Le naufrage de la Pucelle&quot; (1477), the Pucelle was an allegory of both the Virgin Mary and Mary of Burgundy. With the death of her father, the Pucelle was left in charge of their ship, which was attacked by whales and other sea monsters that represented France. Her companion Cœur Leal consoled her by the examples of warrior women like Semiramis, Zenobia, Artemisia or Joan of Arc. He emphasized, though, the story of the Manekine by Jean Wauquelin, who overcame her circumstance by passive resistance to suffering. Here passive resistance was portrayed in a good light, as Molinet linked it to the stable time under Mary&#x27;s grandfather Philip the Good, who in Molinet&#x27;s works was often contrasted with Charles the Bold, whose reign brought Burgundy to ruin. Finally, an eagle (symbol of Maximilian) appeared and saved the ship. When Molinet depicted them as pagan deities, like in &quot;Bergier sans Soulas&quot; (1485), Mary was portrayed as Lune (Moon, Diana), Maximilian was Apollon, Phoebus, Titan or King of Ilion, Philip was Jupiter, Margaret of Austria was Venus, while the King of France was Pan and the King of England was Neptune.

The motif of the Virgin and the Eagle would be seen again during Maximilian&#x27;s &quot;joyous entry&quot; into Antwerp (1478), on one of the tableaux the city presented him. An eagle was shown offering his own blood to the maiden. The symbol for both Antwerp and Burgundy was also a virgin, while the eagle was the symbol of the House of Habsburg. The Antwerp (later, his loyal ally in his later turbulent regency) community seemed to welcome Maximilian as their saviour, but also wanted to subtly remind him of limits to his powers and his responsibilities as ruler together with Mary.

*In one of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s most famous works, the Feast of the Rosary, the Virgin Mary (representation of Mary of Burgundy) was depicted holding the infant Jesus (representation of Philip the Fair) while placing a rosary on the head of a kneeling Maximilian. When the Fraternity of the Rosary was established in 1475 in Cologne, Maximilian and his father Frederick III were present and among the earliest members. Already in 1478, in &quot;Le chappellet des dames&quot;, Molinet, as the Burgundy court chronicler, placed a symbolic rosary on the head of Mary of Burgundy. Similarly, in 1518, one year before the emperor&#x27;s own death, under the order of Zlatko, Bishop of Vienna, Dürer painted &quot;The death of the Virgin&quot;, which was also the scene of the deathbed of Mary of Burgundy, with Maximilian, Philip of Spain, Zlatko and other notables around the couch. Philip was presented as a young St. John while Maximilian bowed down as one of the Apostles. The work was last seen in the 1822 sale of the Fries collection.
*The famous diptych of Maximilian&#x27;s extended family (after 1515), painted by Bernhard Strigel, labels Mary of Burgundy as &quot;Mary Cleophas, believed to be sister of the Virgin Mary&quot; while Maximilian was labeled as Cleophas, brother of Joseph. This painting was likely commissioned to commemorate the 1516 double wedding (between House of Habsburg and House of Hungary) and then bequeathed to the scholar Johannes Cuspinian as a sign of imperial favour (it would become part of his family altar).
*The Alamire manuscript VatS 160, a choir book sent to Pope Leo X as a gift likely by a member of Burgundian-Habsburg family or a person close to Maximilian, contains numerous references to the connection between the Virgin Mary and Mary of Burgundy. For example, the work &quot;Missa Ave regina celorum&quot; by the composer Jacob Obrecht (d.1505) is a tribute to both the Virgin Mary and Mary of Burgundy. Here, Mary became the deceased heavenly Mother, Friend and Queen of Emperor Maximilian. 

===Later depictions===
*Mary was the main character in the 1674 novel &quot;Histoire secrète de Marie de Bourgogne&quot; by Charlotte-Rose de Caumont de La Force. The work was a part of the era&#x27;s literary fairy tale vogue, which was welcomed enthusiastically by contemporaries.
*In the nineteenth century, together with her grandson Charles V, the painters Hans Memling and Jan van Eyck, Mary became a powerful national symbol of Belgium, representing an era in which &quot;the national interest was perceived to have flourish&quot;. The depictions had a local dimension as well, showing the particular cities as &quot;receiving the great and the good&quot;. A popular trope was the scene of Mary visiting Memling (which Graham and Wintle compare to the relationship between Maximilian I and Dürer in German imagination, or between the Princess of Orange and Bartholomeus van der Helst as depicted by Dutch artists. The first painter who depicted this scene was Nicaise de Keyser in 1847, followed by Eduoard Wallays in the 1860s (in both cases, the scene of the visit was the Hospital of Saint John).
*Mary was the main character in the 1833 eponymous novel &quot;Mary of Burgundy, or The Revolt of Ghent&quot; by George Payne Rainsford James. In the novel, she was depicted as the representation of maternalistic feudalism that the author espoused.
*The German dramatist Hermann Hersch wrote a one-act comedy in 1853 and a five-act tragedy in 1860 about her life. Other characters include Maximilian, von Ravenstein, Lady Hallwyn, John of Cleves etc.
*In &quot;Hieronymus Rides: Episodes in the Life of a Knight and Jester at the Court of Maximilian, King of the Romans&quot;, a 1912 novel, written by Anna Coleman Ladd, Mary was once loved by the jester and knight Hieronymus, who served his half-brother Maximilian.
*There are two paintings involving Mary and Maximilian among the principal historical paintings of the painter Anton Petter (1791 – 1858): one is &quot;Der Einzug Kaiser Maximilians I.in Gent&quot; (1822, Belvedere, Wien) in which Mary presented their son to her husband and the other is &quot;Kaiser Maximilian I und Maria von Burgund&quot; which describes their meeting.(1813, Joanneum at Graz).
*An equestrian statue of Mary named &quot;Flandria Nostra&quot; stands in Golden Fleece Muntplein, created by Jules Lagae.
*In the 1994 historical romance &quot;Marie de Bourgogne: la princesse aux chaînes&quot; by André Besson, Mary loved Philippe de Ravenstein (Philip of Cleves) but had to sacrifice her feelings for raison d&#x27;État.
*&quot;Maximilian – Das Spiel von Macht und Liebe&quot; (&quot;Maximilian: The Game of Power and Love&quot;), released in the United States as &quot;Maximilian and Marie De Bourgogne&quot; or simply &quot;Maximilian&quot;, a 2017 German-Austrian three-part historical miniseries directed by Andreas Prochaska, starring Jannis Niewöhner as Maximilian I and Christa Théret as Mary of Burgundy, recounts the story of their marriage and love.
*&quot;Maximilian – ein wahrer Ritter&quot; is a 2019 musical written by Florian and Irene Scherz about Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy.
*In 2021, a docufiction, entitled &quot;Marie de Bourgogne : seule contre tous&quot; (&quot;Mary of Burgundy: alone versus all&quot;), is dedicated to her as part (Season 15) of the program &quot; Secrets d&#x27;Histoire&quot; and presented by Stéphane Bern.

*There is a huge mural (created in 2019) in the centre of Bruges, named &quot;Maria Van Bourgondië&quot; (by Jeremiah Persyn), with Mary of Burgundy, still remembered as a strong and gentle ruler, as the central character, depicted as a Jesus-like figure with symbols of great religions, while Maximilian, whose rule coincided (and contributed to) the beginning of the 500-year decline of Bruges, is in the guise of the Brugge Fool (‘’Brugse Zot’’, the symbol of Bruges), riding a swan and holding a halfmoon. Other symbols of Bruges like the Basilica of Holy Blood and the Church of Our Lady are also featured.
*The Austrian artist Wilhelm Koller painted &quot;&quot;. She is shown holding her young son, who was playing with a dog. Eörsi remarks that the painting echoes Saint Luke painting the Virgin.
*Daniel Sternefeld (1905–1986) composed &quot;Zang en dans aan het hof van Maria Van Bourgondië&quot; (&quot;Songs and dances at the Court of Mary of Burgundy&quot;), for chamber or orchestra.
*Miroir de Marie by Maxime Benoît-Jeannin is a 2021 novel about her life.
*In May 2022, a monument in Jabbeke was erected, created by the sculptor Livia Canestraro, depicting her fall from horse.

<doc id="151340" wikidata="Q973228" url="?curid=151340" title="Rudy Vallée">
<text>Hubert Prior Vallée (July 28, 1901 – July 3, 1986), known professionally as Rudy Vallée, was an American singer, saxophonist, bandleader, actor, and entertainer. He was the first male singer to rise from local radio broadcasts in New York City to national popularity as a &quot;crooner&quot;.

== Early life ==
Vallée was born in Island Pond, Vermont on July 28, 1901, the son of Catherine Lynch and Charles Alphonse Vallée. His maternal grandparents were English and Irish, while his paternal grandparents were French Canadians from Quebec. He grew up in Westbrook, Maine. On March 29, 1917, he enlisted in the US Navy in Portland, Maine to fight in World War I, but authorities discovered he was only 15 and had given the false birth date of July 28, 1899. He was discharged at the Naval Training Station in Newport, Rhode Island on May 17, 1917, after 41 days of active service.

== Career ==
=== Music ===

After playing drums in his high school band, Vallée played clarinet and saxophone in bands around New England as a teenager. The popularity of the saxophone and an unexpected reply from his idol Rudy Wiedoeft prompted Vallée to perfect his technique. He paid Columbia Records to make four &quot;personal records&quot;, which he used for audition purposes with a number of bands. From 1924 to 1925, he played with the Savoy Havana Band at the Savoy Hotel in London, where band members discouraged his attempts to become a vocalist. He returned to the United States, briefly attending the University of Maine. While at the University of Maine, he initiated into Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity on December 5, 1921. He transferred to Yale University in 1924, from which he earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy in 1927. As a Yale student he led the football band and was the lead saxophonist in the Yale Collegians with Peter Arno, who became a cartoonist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.

After graduation, he formed Rudy Vallée and the Connecticut Yankees, having named himself after saxophonist Rudy Wiedoeft. With this band (formed in 1928), which included two violins, two saxophones, a piano, a banjo, and drums, he began singing as a member of a trio and as a soloist. He had a thin, wavering tenor voice and seemed more at home singing sweet ballads than jazz songs. But his singing, saxophone playing, and the innovative arrangements he wrote for his band attracted attention from a rapidly increasing number of listeners, especially from young women. In 1928 he started performing on the radio, first at New York station WABC, leading his Yale Collegians Orchestra, and then on WEAF and the NBC Red Network beginning in February 1929.

He became one of the first crooners. Singers needed strong voices to fill theaters in the days before microphones. Crooners had soft voices that were suited to the intimacy of radio; the microphones, in this case, promoted direct access to &quot;a vulnerable and sensuous interior,&quot; or in other words, &quot;a conjured intimacy&quot;. 
Vallée was one of the first celebrity radio vocalists. Flappers pursued him wherever he went. His live appearances were usually sold out. Contrary to popular belief, he did not have screaming girls at his appearances. However, his voice still failed to project in venues without microphones and amplification, so he often sang through a megaphone, a device he had used when leading the Yale football band. A caricature of him singing this way was depicted in the Betty Boop cartoon &quot;Poor Cinderella&quot; (1934). Another caricature is in &quot;Crosby, Columbo, and Vallee&quot;, which parodies him, Bing Crosby, and Russ Columbo.

In the words of a magazine writer in 1929,

At the microphone he is truly a romantic figure. Faultlessly attired in evening dress, he pours softly into the radio&#x27;s delicate ear a stream of mellifluous melody. He appears to be coaxing, pleading and at the same time adoring the invisible one to whom his song is attuned.
Vallée had his share of detractors as well as fans when his popularity was at its height. &quot;Radio Revue&quot;, a radio fan magazine, held a contest in which people wrote letters explaining his success. The winning letter, written by a man who disliked Vallée&#x27;s music, said, &quot;Rudy Vallee is reaping the harvest of a seed that is seldom sown this day and age: LOVE. The good-looking little son-of-a-gun really and honestly LOVES his audience and his art. He LOVES to please listeners—LOVES it more than he does his name in the big lights, his mug in the papers. He loved all those unseen women as passionately as a voice can love, long before they began to purr and to caress him with two-cent stamps.&quot;

Vallée made his first commercial recordings in 1928 for Columbia&#x27;s low-priced labels Harmony, Velvet Tone, and Diva. He signed with RCA Victor in February 1929 and remained with the company through 1931, leaving after a heated dispute with executives over song selections. He then recorded for the short-lived Hit of the Week label which sold rather poor quality records laminated onto a cardboard base. In August 1932, he signed with Columbia and remained with the label through 1933. Vallée returned to RCA Victor in June 1933; his records were initially issued on Victor&#x27;s low-priced Bluebird label until November 1933, when he was back on the standard Victor label. He remained with RCA Victor until signing with ARC in 1936. ARC issued his records on the Perfect, Melotone, Conqueror and Romeo labels until 1937, when he again returned to RCA Victor.

With his group the Connecticut Yankees, Vallée&#x27;s best-known recordings include &quot;The Stein Song&quot; (a.k.a. University of Maine school song) in 1929 and &quot;Vieni, Vieni&quot; in the latter 1930s.

His last hit record was a reissue of &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;, popularized in the 1942 film &quot;Casablanca&quot;. Due to the 1942-44 AFM recording ban, RCA Victor reissued the version he had recorded in 1931. During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard to help direct the 11th district Coast Guard band as a chief petty officer. He was promoted to lieutenant and led the 40-piece band to great success. In 1944, he was placed on the inactive list and returned to radio.

According to George P. Oslin, Vallée on July 28, 1933, was the recipient of the first singing telegram. A fan telegraphed birthday greetings, and Oslin had the operator sing &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;.

=== Radio and film ===

In 1929, Vallée began hosting &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot;, a popular radio show with guests such as Fay Wray and Richard Cromwell in dramatic skits. Vallée continued hosting radio shows such as the Royal Gelatin Hour, Vallee Varieties, and The Rudy Vallee Show through the 1930s and 1940s.

When Vallée took his contractual vacations from his national radio show in 1937, he insisted his sponsor hire Louis Armstrong as his substitute. This was the first instance of an African-American hosting a national radio program. Vallée wrote the introduction for Armstrong&#x27;s 1936 book &quot;Swing That Music&quot;.

In 1929, Vallée made his first feature film, &quot;The Vagabond Lover&quot;, for RKO Radio. His first films were made to cash in on his singing popularity. While his initial performances were rather wooden, his acting greatly improved in the late 1930s and 1940s, and by the time he began working with Preston Sturges in the 1940s, he had become a successful comedic supporting player. He appeared opposite Claudette Colbert in Sturges&#x27;s classic 1942 screwball comedy &quot;The Palm Beach Story&quot;. Other films in which he appeared include &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;, &quot;Unfaithfully Yours&quot; and &quot;The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer&quot;.

In 1955, Vallée was featured in &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot;, co-starring Jane Russell, Alan Young, and Jeanne Crain. The production was filmed on location in Paris. The film was based on the Anita Loos novel that was a sequel to her acclaimed &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. &quot;Gentlemen Marry Brunettes&quot; was popular throughout Europe at the time and was released in France as &quot;A Paris Pour les Quatre&quot; &quot;(&quot;Paris for the Four&quot;)&quot;, and in Belgium as &quot;Tevieren Te Parijs&quot;.

Vallée performed on Broadway as J.B. Biggley in the 1961 musical &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; and reprised the role in the 1967 film version. He appeared in the 1960s &quot;Batman&quot; television series as the villain Lord Marmaduke Ffogg and in 1971 as a vindictive surgeon in the &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode &quot;Marmalade Wine&quot;.

===Vallee-Video===
From 1948 to 1952, Vallée owned Vallee-Video, a television production company formed in the early days of national TV broadcasts. The company was incorporated on April 3, 1948. Vallée made 16mm film shorts for television, including &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; and &quot;Under a Campus Moon&quot;, in which he appeared himself. Ed Wynn, Pinky Lee, Buddy Lester and Cyril Smith also appeared in Vallee-Video productions. Comedy sequences in the productions featured dubbed-in laughter.

In 1949, Vallee-Video produced one of the first cartoon shows on television, &quot;Tele-Comics&quot;.

Vallee-Video&#x27;s breakthrough in 1952 would have been a 15-minute television show based on the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; comic strip starring Vallée&#x27;s friend Ralph Byrd, who played the character in four successful &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; theatrical serials from 1937 to 1941. Vallée sold the show as a pilot to NBC. Vallée and Byrd also worked on a proposed radio show based on the comic strip &quot;Hawkshaw the Detective&quot;. However, Byrd died in August 1952, bringing the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; production to a halt, and spelling the end for Vallee-Video.

== Personal life ==
Vallée was a Republican who strongly supported Richard Nixon&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign, saying: &quot;Every chance I get I sound off for Nixon. I&#x27;m advocating that &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; reprint &#x27;Cuba, Castro and JFK,&#x27; a very brilliant article. I also send in checks from time to time.&quot; Nixon had written the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; article in November 1964.

Vallée maintained an estate at Kezar Lake in Maine.

Vallée died of cancer at his Los Angeles estate known as Silvertip on July 3, 1986 while watching the televised centennial ceremonies of the restored Statue of Liberty. His wife Eleanor said that his last words were: &quot;I wish we could be there; you know how I love a party.&quot;

===Relationships===
Vallée was married four times. During his divorce from his first wife Fay Webb, she alleged that &quot;Vallée is possessed of a violent, vicious, and ungovernable temper, and given to the use of blasphemy and the use of intemperate, vile, and vituperative language, particularly when applied to [her]&quot;. She accused him of committing adultery with three women, including actress Alice Faye. Vallée denied the allegations and charged infidelity on her part. The judge found him &quot;not guilty of any misconduct or maltreatment of Webb which detrimentally affected her health, physical or medical condition.&quot;

He married Jane Greer on December 2, 1943 in Hollywood, but they separated after three months and divorced on July 27, 1944. His fourth and final wife Eleanor wrote a memoir titled &quot;My Vagabond Lover&quot;.

===Temperament===
NBC announcer George Ansbro wrote in his memoirs that Vallée &quot;had quite a temper and a very foul mouth... almost always the butt of his nastiness was the orchestra... his outbursts were mean-spirited, and he didn&#x27;t care who overheard&quot;. However, Alton Cook wrote, &quot;Vallée may be fuming at his orchestra, but a Vallée hour rehearsal never quite loses its air of being a gathering of old friends... Rudy is grimly serious about rehearsal. He sometimes has his band spend a quarter-hour going over one short passage that doesn&#x27;t satisfy him. On those occasions his temper wears thin...&quot;

In a heated dispute with producer George White on the set of the 1934 film &quot;George White&#x27;s Scandals&quot;, White struck Vallée in the jaw. Dorothy Brooks wrote in 1936, &quot;Other stars on the air have their troubles, their disagreements, and yet you don&#x27;t read about their ending in black eyes. Only Rudy Vallee seems to figure in endings of this kind.&quot; In an interview with Brooks, Vallée claimed he found fighting &quot;savage and stupid&quot; and &quot;the wrong way to try to solve problems, because it never solves them.&quot; When asked why he fought, he replied, &quot;I just lost my temper. I&#x27;ll admit I have a too-quick temper.&quot;

==Legacy==
In 1995, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him.

For his work in radio, Vallée was inducted into the Vermont Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 2011.

<doc id="151343" wikidata="Q7716590" url="?curid=151343" title="The Best... Album in the World...Ever!">
<text>The Best... Album in the World...Ever! is a compilation album brand from Circa Records (trading under the &#x27;strategic marketing&#x27; brand name of EMI Records/Virgin Records). It was the brainchild of marketer Stephen Pritchard at Virgin Records.

Usually the album&#x27;s title is made of the main title, genre and maybe issue number (so albums would include &quot;The Best Ibiza Album in the World...Ever!&quot;, &quot;The Best Rock Album in the World...Ever!&quot; etc.). However, on a number of indie music collections, the genre aspect was replaced by a full list of artist names. Due to this, these were just normally listed as The Best Album in the World...Ever!, and featured many Britpop acts, as well as dance acts such as Chemical Brothers.

Although most albums use the &quot;Album in the World...Ever!&quot; suffix, some towards the late 1990s change the suffix to &quot;Anthems...Ever!&quot;, with a plural on the theme (example the album &quot;The Best Celtic Anthems...Ever!&quot;). Some even just use &quot;...Ever!&quot; as a suffix (such as &quot;The Best TV Ads...Ever!&quot;)

Many of the albums in the series were compiled by Ashley Abram.

==History==
The series started with &quot;The Best...Dance Album in the World...Ever!&quot; (1993) which was a success, spending four weeks at number one on the UK Compilation Chart and ending up as the third biggest selling compilation of the year. The &quot;Dance&quot; strand led to a fourteen volume subseries. Other successful subseries included &quot;Air Guitar&quot;, &quot;Sixties&quot;, &quot;Club Anthems&quot; and the aforementioned alternative rock &quot;Best...Album in the World Ever&quot;s.

&quot;The Best Club Anthems...Ever!&quot;, featuring house, big beat, techno and electronica was released in 1997, and there have been 16 sequels. One difference from &quot;The Best Dance Album in the World..Ever!&quot; and &quot;The Best Club Anthems...Ever&quot; series is that &quot;Club Anthems&quot; originally had its tracks mixed, although this stopped beginning with 2003&#x27;s &quot;Very Best Club Anthems&quot; release.

&quot;The Best Air Guitar Album in the World...Ever!&quot;, referred to in retrospect as &quot;Air Guitar I&quot;, released 5 November 2001, was compiled by Brian May. A sequel was released in November 2002 and another in November 2003, the latter proclaiming itself to be the last &quot;Air Guitar Album in the World...Ever!&quot;. Both sequels were again compiled by Brian May. In 2005, a 3CD &quot;The Best of the Best Air Guitar Album in the World...Ever!&quot; was released. Whilst &quot;Air Guitar III&quot; proclaimed to be the final volume, the liner notes written by May in &quot;The Best of the Best&quot; start with &quot;OK, we lied.&quot;

Sometimes, the albums have captured a moment of popularity for things other than music, such as &quot;The Best TV Ads...Ever!&quot;, a compilation released in May 2000 of songs from current and famous TV adverts, which was released just days after the &quot;100 Greatest TV Ads&quot; poll from Channel 4 and &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; aired on the former. Furthermore, many other albums with a similar concept followed from other labels, including &quot;Switched On&quot; from rival label Telstar, &quot;Classic Ads&quot; from Universal, &quot;Commercial Breaks&quot; from Beechwood Music and the similarly titled &quot;Commercial Break&quot; from Castle Music.

The series was immensely popular, and most of the volumes performed well in the compilation charts, with some even making number one. The series started to become subject to popular culture parodies, such as spoof band Shirehorses titling their first album from 1997 &quot;The worst...album in the world...ever...EVER!&quot;. Blur, who appeared on some of the albums in the series, were originally going to title their 2000 compilation &quot;&quot; as &quot;Best Blur Album in the World Ever&quot;.

The series originally featured a globe on each album cover, to represent the world, as referred to in the album titles. When the &quot;Anthems...Ever!&quot; and the simply &quot;...Ever!&quot; titles started to appear in 1997, the globe didn&#x27;t usually appear on the cover. The globe continued to be featured on &quot;in the World...Ever!&quot; covers nonetheless, although in 2001–02, it started to become absent from the album covers of &quot;in the World...Ever!&quot; albums too, as it is absent from the &quot;Air Guitar&quot; covers and one of the &quot;Dance&quot; covers.

==List of compilations==
==The Best... Album in the World... Ever!==

These albums have the genre of indie/alternative music.

These albums finished in 1998, although the series was picked up again in 2001 under a new name, &quot;The Album:&quot;.

The brand new &quot;The Album:&quot; series spawned six more volumes (although a hiatus was present in two of its five active years)

===Volumes I &amp; II (2003)===
Following the success of Volume 2, Volumes 1 and 2 were compiled into a box set, released in the same original CD boxes, but a slipcase had been placed over them displaying new artwork. The cover subtitles the set &quot;4 CD Deluxe Limited Edition&quot;.

===Best of the Best (2005)===
In 2005, the series returned with a 3-CD album titled &quot;The Best of the Best Air Guitar Albums in the World Ever&quot;.

==&quot;The Best Scottish Album in the World...Ever!&quot;==
This album was released 9 June 1997. It is notable for being perhaps the only widely available compilation album that features Wolfstone, who feature with their song &quot;Battle&quot;, credited as &quot;The Battle&quot;. At the end of the second disc is the Dunblane cover of the song &quot;Knockin&#x27; on Heaven&#x27;s Door&quot;. All royalties from the recording of this song were sent to charities. The previous compilation &quot;Hits 97&quot; also sent royalties from the song to charity.

*The same album also started another tradition which was slightly different packaging. Previous volumes featured a border on the cover with small circles in each corner, although this new tradition was short, and the border re-appeared for the last three albums in the series, starting with &quot;The Best Club Anthems Classics&quot;.
*The series was very successful. It offered a third alternative to the Now Dance series, with the other alternative being &quot;The Best Dance Album&quot; series.

<text>Greetland is a village situated within the metropolitan borough of Calderdale, West Yorkshire, England. It falls within the Calderdale Ward of Greetland and Stainland. According to the 2011 Census, this ward had a population of 11,389. Geographically, Greetland is approximately 1 mile (1.6 km) west of Elland and 2.5 miles (4.0 km) south of Halifax.

Historical records from 1870–1872, documented in John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales, describe Greetland as a village and chapelry in the Halifax parish, West Riding of Yorkshire. The village is noted to have been situated 1 mile west of the Elland railway station and 3 miles south-southwest of Halifax. 

It had amenities such as a post office under Halifax&#x27;s jurisdiction during that period. The chapelry formed a part of the Elland-cum-Greetland township. The population at the time was 2,584, with local industries including stone quarries and several large mills producing woollens, worsted, and cotton.

==History==
The origins of Greetland may trace back to a Roman settlement, potentially identified as &quot;Cambodunum&quot;. This hypothesis is supported by the discovery of a Roman altar stone, dated to 208 AD, found in 1597 at Bank Top in Greetland.

From 1844 to 1962, Greetland was served by the Greetland railway station.

Greetland was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Halifax, in 1894 Greetland became an urban district, on 31 December 1894 Greetland became a civil parish, being formed from the part of the parish of Elland with Greetland in Greetland Urban District, on 1 April 1937 the district was abolished and merged with Elland Urban District. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished and merged with Elland. In 1931 the parish had a population of 4299.

The passage of Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield passed through the village on 6 July 2014. The race route traversed east to west, originating from neighbouring Barkisland, through West Vale, and concluding in Elland. One of the stage&#x27;s climbs, the Category 3 Côte de Greetland, occurred here at the 119.5-kilometre mark. Cyril Lemoine of Cofidis secured 2 points in the King of the Mountain competition, with David de la Cruz of Team Netapp-Endura earning the remaining point.

==Geography==
Greetland is situated primarily around Stainland, Saddleworth and Rochdale Roads, with much of the village on one side of the steep hill that separates the latter two roads. Saddleworth Road and Rochdale Road meet at a double traffic junction in a small commercial area called West Vale.
&quot;The old part of Greetland was strung out along what is now the B6113 to the west. In the late 19C a new town known as West Vale developed in the valley, and a school and church were built (SE097213). The name stems from being at the western end of Elland, although it is at the eastern end of Greetland which was an independent authority only from 1894 to 1937.&quot; .
==Landmarks==

===Clay House===

Clay House was built for John Clay and the Clay family around 1650, although there is a 1296 mention of a house owned by Robert Clay on the site. The grounds of the house were opened as a park in 1924, and in 1929 a war memorial was built in the hall. The house is frequently used for weddings and its main hall can seat over 100 people. Its corridors and grand rooms are well known in the area, with a large central staircase, traditional wooden panelling from the 1600s and paintings. The house is currently managed by Calderdale Council. There is another war memorial on the eastern wall of the house. Clay House is the starting point of the Calderdale Way.

===Calderdale Way===
Greetland is the start of the Calderdale Way, a long-distance footpath popular with ramblers.

=== Public Houses ===
====Druid&#x27;s Arms (closed 2004)====

Perhaps the oldest public house in Greetland, the Druids Arms is known locally as the &quot;Rat&quot;. The sign outside the pub was altered by the current landlord to reflect this.

The pub has been at the centre of a planning dispute with local residents. Since its closure on 17 October 2004, the landlord has applied for planning permission to turn the pub into flats. However, a local residents&#x27; committee is attempting to launch objections to the proposed change.

The Druids Arms appears in local folklore:
Greetland is the home of &#x27;Brandy Hole Wood&#x27;. The origin of the wood&#x27;s name is ingrained in local folklore. It is said by local residents that, in order to avoid paying excessive tax on his stockpiled alcohol, a pre-20th century landlord of the Druids Arms would roll barrels of spirits into the wood in order to hide them. When the taxman came to take an inventory of the pub&#x27;s cellar he could not account for the hidden barrels, and so the landlord avoided paying tax on the barrels stashed in the woods.

According to another version of the story, it was the locals who hid the brandy in the wood, and concerned at his lost revenue, the landlord of the Druids Arms informed the taxman of the hidden stash. This is what earned the pub the nickname &quot;The Rat&quot;.

The cottage attached to the pub was sold in March 2008, and was extended in 2022.

====Golden Fleece (closed 2008)====
This pub came to nationwide media attention in early January 2008. The landlord, who was later found to have been trading under his son&#x27;s alcohol licence, had been publicly flouting the smoking ban that was introduced throughout England in July 2007. It was alleged that he had allowed customers to smoke inside his pub, and had either taken down non-smoking signs or written over them with &#x27;Smoking Allowed&#x27;. The pub had allegedly received support from smokers and non-smokers alike in Halifax, Bradford, Huddersfield and Leeds. The landlord stated that he had received phone calls of support from Germany, Croatia and the USA. He announced in 2008 that he would open another pub in Huddersfield,The College Arms, where he would also allow his customers to smoke. He said that he wished to create a small smoking area, leaving most of the pub a non-smoking venue.

==Education==

Schools include Greetland Junior and Infant School and the West Vale Primary School, Greetland Infant School on Saddleworth Road, (for children aged 4–6), and Greetland Junior School, on School Street/Rochdale Road (for children aged 6–11).

Greetland Academy has two campuses, one on School Street, the other on Saddleworth Road.

Greetland has schools for both Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2. The Key Stage 1 school, Sunnybank, is on Saddleworth Road. The Key Stage 2 mixed school, Greetland Academy School, is on School Street, and teaches approximately 383 pupils within an age range of 4 to 11.
==Sport==

Sporting facilities in Greetland include the &quot;Greetland Community Centre&quot;, which consists of an indoor multi-purpose pitch, as well as several outdoor natural grass pitches. The venue also has a small bar area that was voted club of the year 2007 by CAMRA. 

The community centre is home to the Greetland Goldstars Football Club and Elland Boxers rugby club, which has various teams in different age groups playing in the local junior football leagues.

Their motto is &quot;To win fairly and to lose with honour&quot;.

The club achieved FA Charter Standard Development Club Status in January 2007.

Founded in 1858 the &quot;Greetland Cricket &amp; Bowling Club&quot; is still active and the club competes in the &quot;Halifax League&quot;, playing host to teams from around Calderdale and Kirklees. The pitch is on the banks of a small river and is prone to flooding.

The Greetland Social Club has three table tennis teams which play in the Halifax Table Tennis League.

Various local rugby league teams play at the Greetland All Rounders rugby ground. The site contains an indoor bar and meeting area and a floodlit outdoor pitch. The ground is often used for community events and is used regularly by the district Scout Groups.

===Scouts===
Greetland has a Scout Group operating as the 5th Greetland Scout Group, which comprises Beavers, Cubs and Scouts. Explorer Scouts operate from the nearby West Vale HQ. The group is based in the St Thomas&#x27; Church Hall. Other venues are used when holding meetings for special events and activities. The group is part of the Pennine Calder District Scouts.

<doc id="151347" wikidata="Q358374" url="?curid=151347" title="John I of Aragon">
<text>John I (27 December 1350 – 19 May 1396), called by posterity the Hunter or the Lover of Elegance, or the Abandoned in his lifetime, was the King of Aragon from 1387 until his death.

==Biography==
John was the eldest son of Peter IV and his third wife, Eleanor, who was the daughter of Peter II of Sicily. He was born in Perpignan, capital of the Rousillon, which at that time was part of the Principality of Catalonia, in the Crown of Aragon. He was a man of insignificant character, with a taste for verse. He was a Francophile and married Violant of Bar against the wishes of his father, who had wanted him to marry a princess of Sicily. His last marriage was happy. His wife frequently participated in government, since the king was often ill.

Once on the throne, John abandoned his father&#x27;s relatively Anglophile policy and made an alliance with France. He continued Aragon&#x27;s support for the Pope of the Avignon line, Clement VII, in the Western Schism. John also made an alliance with Castile, and confirmed in 1388 a treaty with Navarre fixing borders between these kingdoms.

In 1389–90, the Aragonese battled the troops of the Count of Armagnac, John III, who was attempting to conquer the lands of the vassal Kingdom of Majorca. The attack went from Empordà to Girona. The invaders were defeated in 1390 by Aragonese troops commanded by John&#x27;s brother Martin.

During 1388–90, John gradually lost all lands of the Duchies of Athens and Neopatras in Greece.
In 1391, John promulgated legislation on Jews in different cities of the Kingdom of Aragon. Also in 1391, his administration faced a revolt in the vassal kingdom of Sicily, where the population had proclaimed Louis II of Naples as king.

John was a protector of culture of Barcelona. He established in 1393 the Consistory of Barcelona (&quot;jocs florals&quot;), imitating the same office in Toulouse.

Aragon had been attempting to subjugate Sardinia since the reign of James II, and gradually the Aragonese had conquered most of the island. However, in the 1380s, the remaining independent principality Arborea became a fortress of rebellion and the Aragonese were rapidly driven back by Eleanor de Bas-Serra. The Aragonese continued in John&#x27;s reign to attempt to suppress rebels in Sardinia and regain lost territories. However, during John&#x27;s reign, practically the whole of Sardinia was lost.

John&#x27;s reign was characterized by disastrous financial administration.

He died during a hunt in forests near Foixà by a fall from his horse. Leaving no sons, he was succeeded by his younger brother Martin.

==Family and children==
From his first marriage on 24 June 1373 to Martha of Armagnac (18 February 1347 - 23 October 1378), daughter of Count Jean I of Armagnac:
*James (Valencia, 24 June 1374 - Valencia, 22 August 1374)
*Joanna (Daroca, October 1375 - Valencia, September 1407), who married on 4 June 1392 at Barcelona to Mathieu, Count of Foix. Together they claimed the throne of Aragon after her father&#x27;s death. Matthew of Foix invaded Aragonese territories, but was driven back by the new King Martin. Joanna died soon after, childless.
*John (Barcelona, 23 July 1376 24/31 July 1376)
*Alfonso (9 September 1377 1377)
*Eleanor (Zaragoza, 13 July 1378 Zaragoza, 1378)

From his second marriage on 2 February 1380 to Yolande of Bar (c. 1365 - 3 July 1431), daughter of Robert I, Duke of Bar and Marie of Valois:
* James (22 March 1382 1 September 1388), Duke of Girona and Count of Cervera
* Yolande (Zaragoza 1384 - Saumur 14 November 1442), married on 2 December 1400 to Louis II of Naples
* Ferdinand (18 March 1389 - Monzón, October 1389), Duke of Girona and Count of Cervera

<doc id="151348" wikidata="Q2342139" url="?curid=151348" title="Guiseley">
<text>Guiseley ( ) is a town in the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is situated south of Otley and Menston and is now a north-western suburb of Leeds.

It sits in the Guiseley and Rawdon ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. At the 2001 census, Guiseley with Rawdon had a population of over 21,000, increasing to 22,347 at the 2011 Census.

The A65 Otley Road, which passes through the town, is the main shopping street. Guiseley railway station has regular train services into Leeds, Bradford and Ilkley stations on the Wharfedale Line.

==Etymology==
The name of Guiseley is first attested in an eleventh-century copy of a charter from around 972, as &quot;Gislicleh&quot;; it next appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Gisele&quot; and similar variants. The early spelling suggests that the first element of the name is an Old English personal name &quot;Gīslic&quot;. No such name is otherwise attested, but it is a plausible nickname form of names beginning in &quot;Gīsl-&quot;, such as &quot;Gīslbeorht&quot;. The second element comes from the Old English word &quot;lēah&quot; (&#x27;open land in woodland&#x27;). Thus the name seems once to have meant &#x27;Gīslic&#x27;s clearing&#x27;.

The etymologies of local field- and street-names were studied in detail by Henry R. Daniels.

==History==
There have been Stone Age and Bronze Age finds in Guiseley and a Roman road, Road 72b, ran nearby on Guiseley Moor. A Saxon settlement existed around a spring which is now called Guiseley Wells and provided drinking water.

It was a largely farming community until the 18th century, when cottage-based woollen industry arose. In Victorian times it became industrialized, acquiring a railway connection in 1865 and a town hall (now Guiseley Theatre) in 1867.

Guiseley was an ancient parish in the West Riding of Yorkshire from the 12th century. The parish also included the townships of Carlton, Horsforth, Rawdon and Yeadon, all of which became separate civil parishes in 1866. In 1894 Guiseley became an urban district, on 1 April 1937 the district was abolished to form Aireborough Urban District, part also went to Ilkley Urban District. On 1 April 1937 the parish was abolished to form Aireborough, part also went to Ilkley. In 1931 the parish had a population of 5,607. In 1974 Aireborough was itself abolished and absorbed into the City of Leeds Metropolitan District in the new county of West Yorkshire.

==St Oswald&#x27;s Church==
Guiseley&#x27;s church, dedicated to St Oswald, was the centre of a large parish that included many surrounding villages. It was used by generations of the Longfellow family. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s 5th great-grandfather left here for the New World in the 17th century. The rector of St Oswald&#x27;s for several decades was Rev. Robert More (died in 1642), the father-in-law of the English explorer, Captain Christopher Levett. Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell were married at St Oswald&#x27;s and became the parents of six children, including Anne, Branwell, Charlotte and Emily Brontë.

==Business==

Crompton Parkinson was a major employer until its factory closed in 2004. The town was the home of Silver Cross, a pram manufacturer, whose factory was operational from 1936 to 2002.

The town is known for Harry Ramsden, whose fish and chip shop traded from a small shed next to the tram terminus at White Cross. In 1930 he opened &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest fish and chip shop&quot;. The original restaurant was closed in December 2011. The Wetherby Whaler group purchased the site and planned a £500,000 refurbishment to open during the summer of 2012. The new Wetherby Whaler restaurant opened on 22 May 2012.

==Amenities==
Guiseley has two retail parks: Guiseley Retail Park in the centre of town, and Westside Retail Park between Guiseley and Yeadon. The town has a Morrisons supermarket, charity shops and beauty stores on Otley Road, as well as many pubs, bars, takeaways and restaurants located around the town and a leisure centre with a swimming pool and gym on The Green.

Many of the retail outlets in the town have been established on the converted sites of old factories or mills. Recently, an increasing number of stores of well-known leading brands such as Argos, TK Maxx, Marks &amp; Spencer (food), Asda Living, Currys, Costa Coffee, Next and Sports Direct have been opened in the area. McDonald&#x27;s, KFC and Subway all have stores in the town.

==Places of worship==
In addition to St Oswald&#x27;s, there is also Guiseley Methodist Church and Guiseley Baptist Church, which was built in 1883 on Oxford Road in the old town, and the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses on Otley Road. St Oswald&#x27;s is now part of a united parish with St Paul&#x27;s Church in Esholt.
==Sports and recreation==

Guiseley&#x27;s professional football team, Guiseley A.F.C., play at Nethermoor Park. They played in the Conference North during the 2014–15 season, gaining promotion to the Conference Premier through the playoffs. Guiseley Cricket Club shares the club house and plays in the Airedale-Wharfedale Senior Cricket League. Aireborough RUFC play at Nunroyd Park. Local philanthropist Jonathan Peate gave Nethermoor Park (Guiseley) and Nunroyd Park (between Yeadon and Guiseley) to local people in the early 20th century. Two other parks were regenerated in 2011/12, Springfield Road and Parkinson&#x27;s Park. Parkinson&#x27;s Park was given to Guiseley in the 1930s by Frank and Albert Parkinson. By 2002 it had become a wasteland with frequent occurrences of antisocial behaviour. It is now owned by Bellway Homes.

Guiseley is also home to England Athletics registered running club Airecentre Pacers.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, and Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire. The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Gazette &amp; Observer&quot; and &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;.

==Schools==
Guiseley School on Fieldhead Road was built as a secondary modern in the 1960s and is sometimes known as Fieldhead School. Aireborough Grammar School opened in 1910 and closed in 1991.

<doc id="151349" wikidata="Q848509" url="?curid=151349" title="Tel Lachish">
<text>Lachish (; ; ) was an ancient Canaanite and later Israelite city in the Shephelah (&quot;lowlands of Judea&quot;) region of Canaan on the south bank of the Lakhish River mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible. The current &quot;tell&quot; by that name, known as Tel Lachish () or Tell el-Duweir (), has been identified with Lachish. Today, it is an Israeli national park operated and maintained by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. It lies near the present-day moshav of Lakhish, which was named in honor of the ancient city.

Lachish was first mentioned in the Amarna letters. In the Book of Joshua, Lachish is cited as one of the cities conquered by the Israelites for joining the league against the Gibeonites (). The territory was later assigned to the tribe of Judah according to Joshua 15:39 and became part of the united Kingdom of Israel. Following the kingdom&#x27;s partition, Lachish emerged as one of the most important cities in the Kingdom of Judah, second only to the capital, Jerusalem.

Lachish is best known for its siege and conquest by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 701 BCE, an event famously depicted on the Lachish reliefs, which can be seen today in the British Museum. According to the Book of Jeremiah, Lachish and Azekah were the last two Judean cities to fall to the Neo-Babylonian Empire before the conquest of Jerusalem according to Jeremiah 34:7. One of the Lachish letters, written in 597–587 BCE, warns of the impending Neo-Babylonian destruction. It reads: &quot;Let my lord know that we are watching over the beacon of Lachish, according to the signals which my lord gave, for Azekah is not seen.&quot; This pottery inscription can be seen at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The siege ramp at Lachish, designed for deploying battering rams against the city during the Neo-Assyrian siege, is the oldest known in the world and the sole example found in the ancient Near East.

==History==


===Neolithic===
Occupation at the site of Lachish began during the Pottery Neolithic period (5500–4500 BCE). Flint tools from that period have been found.

===Early Bronze===
Major development began in the Early Bronze Age (3300–3000 BCE). By the end of the Early Bronze, Lachish had become a large settlement. Most of the recovered pottery is of Khirbet Kerak Ware.

===Middle Bronze (Levels VIII–IX)===
The MBA period has not been extensively excavated at the site. During the Middle Bronze (2000–1650 BCE), the settlement developed.

In the Middle Bronze I, the mound was resettled. Remains of a cult place and an assemblage of votive cultic vessels were found in Area D.

In the Middle Bronze IIA, the development continued.

In the Middle Bronze IIB-C, Lachish became a major city in the Southern Levant. An impressive glacis-like structure was constructed around the city, which shaped its present steep slopes and sharp corners. The proposed glacis fronted a city wall built of massive stones. In Area P, a large mudbrick fortress was excavated. Finds from the fortress include 4 scarabs and a number of scarab sealings. These were of &quot;both the local Canaanite MB IIC style and the Hyksos style&quot;. Radiocarbon dating produced a date in the mid-16th century BCE. By the end of Middle Bronze IIC the city was destroyed by fire. Some features originally ascribed to the Iron Age by the early excavators have now been redated to the MBA and LBA.

===Late Bronze (Levels VI–VII)===

In the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE), Lachish was re-established and developed slowly, eventually becoming one of the large and prosperous cities of the Southern Levant. It is first attested as rkjšꜣ (&quot;Lakisha&quot;) in a New Kingdom text, the Papyrus Hermitage 1116A.

Lakhish came under the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, which expelled the Hyksos and established an empire that was most powerful following the military campaigns of Thutmose III. During the Amarna Period (), several letters were written to the pharaoh and were discovered as part of the Amarna archive. It is mentioned in the Amarna letters as Lakisha/Lakiša (EA 287, 288, 328, 329, 335).

During the 20th Dynasty of Egypt, the empire of the New Kingdom of Egypt started to lose its control in the Southern Levant. A bronze object bearing the cartouche of Ramesses III may be associated with the city gate. While Lachish had prospered under Egyptian hegemony, fire destroyed it around 1150 BCE. It was rebuilt by Canaanites, who built two temples. However, this settlement was soon destroyed by another fire around 1130 BCE (cf. nearby fortified Eglon, Canaan). The site then remained sparsely occupied for a long time (Level V). The reasons for this may have been rebellions and invasions by the Sea Peoples.

Four mass graves were found at the site with over 1500 individuals interred, about half women and children. The tombs themselves dated to the Late Bronze Age but the burials contained few dateable elements so it is uncertain if the burials date to the LBA or later.

===Iron Age (Levels II–IV)===
Rebuilding of the city began in the Early Iron Age, during the 10th and 9th centuries BCE, when it was part of the Kingdom of Judah. The unfortified settlement may have been destroyed by the pharaoh Shoshenq I, founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt. In the first half of the 9th century BCE, under the Judahite kings Asa and Jehoshaphat, Lachish became an important city in the kingdom. It was heavily fortified with massive walls and ramparts. A royal palace was built on a platform in the center of the city. Lachish was the foremost among several towns and fortified strongholds guarding the valleys that lead up to Jerusalem and the interior of the country against enemies who usually approached from the coast.

====Siege by Sennacherib, Assyrian rule====

In 701 BCE, during the revolt of Hezekiah, king of Judah, against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, it was besieged and captured by Sennacherib despite the defenders&#x27; determined resistance. Some scholars believe that the fall of Lachish occurred during a second campaign in the area by Sennacherib ca. 688 BCE. The site now contains the only remains of an Assyrian siege ramp discovered. Sennacherib later devoted a whole room in his &quot;Palace without a rival&quot;, the southwest palace in Nineveh, for artistic representations of the siege on large alabaster slabs, most of which are now on display in the British Museum. They hold depictions of Assyrian siege ramps, battering rams, sappers, and other siege machines and army units, along with Lachish&#x27;s architecture and its final surrender. Combined with the archaeological finds, they give a good understanding of siege warfare of the period. Modern excavation of the site has revealed that the Assyrians built a stone and dirt ramp up to the level of the Lachish city wall, thereby allowing the soldiers to charge up the ramp and storm the city. Excavations revealed approximately 1500 skulls in one of the caves near the site, and hundreds of arrowheads on the ramp and at the top of the city wall, indicating the ferocity of the battle. The city occupied an area of .

====Babylonian occupation====

Lachish fell to the Neo-Babylonian emperor Nebuchadnezzar II in his campaign against Judah in 586 BCE. The city was finally destroyed in 587 BCE. Residents were exiled as part of the Babylonian captivity. During Babylonian occupation, a large residence was built on the platform that had once supported the Israelite palace. At the end of the captivity, some exiled Jews returned to Lachish and built a new city with fortifications.

Under the Achaemenid Empire (Level I), a large altar known as the Solar Shrine on the east section of the mound was built. The shrine was abandoned after the area fell in the hands of Alexander the Great. The tell has been unoccupied since then.

==Identification==
Initially, Lachish was identified by Flinders Petrie with Tell el-Hesi, an identification supported when a relevant cuneiform tablet was found there. The tablet mentions Zimredda a governor of who is known from one of the Amarna Letters (EA 333). The current identification of &quot;Tell ed-Duweir&quot; as Lachish was first suggested by William F. Albright in 1929 and subsequently accepted by many scholars. This suggestion is strong but circumstantial, based mostly on the geographic location of the site, the writing of Eusebius, the royal reliefs of Sennacherib, the site excavations, and an ostracon found there. Israeli archaeologist and historical geographer, M. Avi-Yonah, thought to place Lachish at the ancient ruin of Qobebet Ibn ‘Awwad, near the former Palestinian Arab village by the same name, rather than at &quot;Tell ed Duweir&quot;. The place has been extensively excavated.

==Archaeological exploration==
===Starkey-Tufnell expedition (1932–1939)===

The first expedition at Lachish, then Tell ed-Duweir, from 1932 to 1939, was the Starkey-Tufnell British expedition which included James Leslie Starkey as expedition leader, Olga Tufnell, G.L. Harding and C. Inge. It was funded by Charles Marston and Henry Wellcome with the aim of finding the Biblical city of Lachish. They succeeded in finding Lachish, with a &quot;wealth of well-stratified pottery&quot;, a &quot;key part of the ceramic corpus of Palestine&quot;, and the Lachish letters, c. &quot;written to the commander of the garrison at Lachish shortly before it fell to the Babylonians in either 589 or 586 B.C.&quot; Starkey was murdered in 1938 while travelling to Jerusalem to open the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum. Tufnell, Harding and Inge remained for the 1938–9 season. Tufnell returned to London and over the next two decades, worked at the Institute of Archaeology in London, &quot;sorting, collating, studying and presenting the material found at Lachish&quot;. She completed her final publication &quot;Lachish IV&quot; in 1957. She had already become a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1951.

===Aharoni expedition (1966, 1968)===
The second was an Israeli expedition directed by Yohanan Aharoni that took place over two seasons in 1966 and 1968. The dig, which focused mainly on the &quot;Solar Shrine&quot;, was worked on behalf of Hebrew University and Tel Aviv University. Aharoni published the findings in his 1975 publication, &quot;Investigations at Lachish: The sanctuary and the residency&quot;.

===Ussishkin expedition (1973 and 1994)===
The third expedition, 1973 and 1994, by a Tel Aviv University Institute of Archaeology and Israel Exploration Society team was led by David Ussishkin. Excavation and restoration work was conducted between 1973 and 1994 by a Tel Aviv University Institute of Archaeology and Israel Exploration Society team led by David Ussishkin. The excavation focused on the Late Bronze (1550–1200 BCE) and Iron Age (1200–587 BCE) levels. The Ussishkin expedition&#x27;s comprehensive 5-volume report set a new standard in archaeological publication. According to Yosef Garfinkel, &quot;The Starkey-Tufnell and Ussishkin expeditions set new standards in excavation and publication. They revolutionized our understanding of various aspects of Lachish, such as the later history of Judah and the pre-Israelite Late Bronze Age Canaanite city.&quot; Excavations of Tel Lachish continued in 2012 under the auspices of Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology, conducted by Nissim Golding-Meir.

A Linear A inscription was also found at the site.

===Garfinkel expedition (2013)===
In 2013, a fourth expedition to Lachish was begun under the direction of Yosef Garfinkel, Michael G. Hasel, and Martin G. Klingbeil to investigate the Iron Age history of the site on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the Institute of Archaeology, Southern Adventist University. Other consortium institutions include Virginia Commonwealth University, Oakland University and Korea Biblical Geography Research Institute. The excavations were concentrated in the northeast corner of the site near the location of the Middle Bronze Age gate and fortress. In the topsoil, unstratified, was found a dark blue diorite scarab of the Egyptian New Kingdom period.

In 2014, during the Fourth Expedition to Lachish, led by archaeologist Saar Ganor, a small potsherd with letters from a 12th-century BCE alphabet, was found in the ruins of a Late Bronze Age temple. One researcher called it, a &quot;once in a generation&quot; find.

A fifth expedition, running from 2015 to 2016, was conducted as part of developing the site as a national park. A gate shrine of Level III, destroyed during the Assyrian assault and a toilet installation were found. It has been suggested that the toilet, in a gate shrine, was part of Hezekiah&#x27;s campaign against idolatry. Two altars in the shrine also had their horns damaged in possible desecration.

===Digs since 2017===

The Korean Lachish Excavation Team led by Hong Soon-hwa, reported that they had &quot;uncovered a wide range of 10th century BCE items, from houses with earthenware items and cooking stoves, to animal bones, olive seeds, spearheads, fortress walls and other objects&quot; on July 5, 2017.

Since 2017, the Austro-Israeli excavation is exploring the Middle and Late Bronze Age strata at the site. The project is conducted a joint project of Hebrew University and the Institute for Oriental and European Archaeology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences and is co-directed by Felix Höflmayer and Katharina Streit. The project is funded by the Austrian Science Fund.

In 2018 a pottery sherd, dated to the 15th century BCE, was found with alphabetic text. This fills a gap in the development history of alphabetic writing. In 2019 a hieratic ostracon was found, dated to the time of the Egyptian 18th Dynasty. It is described by the excavators as a name list with allocated provisions in Canaanite.

==Select inscriptions==

===Inscriptions in Proto-Canaanite===
As many as 12 purported Proto-Canaanite inscriptions had been discovered at Lachish by 2022. Six were discovered in the Starkey-Tufnell excavations, two during the renewed excavations by Ussishkin, and four in more recent excavations. At least three of the purported inscriptions are likely to have been merely figural pottery designs or pseudo-inscriptions Among the well-known legitimate inscriptions are the Lachish Ewer, Lachish Bowl, the Cypriot Bowl Fragment, and the Ivory Lice Comb.

The few known inscriptions from the Late Bronze Age, the 13th and part of the 12th century BCE, show a certain &quot;linearisation&quot; when compared to the earlier, Proto-Sinaitic script, but the undergone process is not yet understood.

====Ivory lice comb (18th c. BCE)====

In 2016, an inscribed elephant ivory lice comb dating to about 1700 BCE was found at Lachish during the Garfinkel excavations. The find is purported to bear the oldest sentence found written in the early Canaanite script. In the &quot;editio princeps&quot;, the authors suggest to read 15 letters, constituent of a wish to eradicate lice. They offer the following translation: &quot;May this tusk root out the lice of the hai[r and the] beard.&quot;

====Cypriot bowl fragment (15th c. BCE)====
In 2018, an inked rim fragment of a Cypriot White Slip II milk bowl was discovered, dating to the mid fifteenth century BCE. The inscription consists of nine letters. The authors of the &quot;editio princeps&quot; offer to read two words on the inscription, &quot;ʿbd&quot; meaning &quot;servant, slave&quot; and &quot;npt&quot; meaning &quot;honey, nectar.&quot; The inscription is, however, too fragmentary to suggest much else but represents one of the earliest examples of alphabetic writing from the Levant.

====Lachish ewer (13th c. BCE)====
Inscribed ewer, found in the Fosse Temple III at Level VII, which dates it back to the 13th century BCE.

====Lachish bowl (13th c. BCE)====
The Lachish bowl was discovered in Tomb 527 at Lachish Level VII, dated to the 13th century BCE.

====Lachish bowl fragment (12th c. BCE)====
The Lachish bowl fragment was discovered in a Level VII context and dated to the 12th century BCE.

====Lachish jar sherd (12th c. BCE)====
The &quot;Lachish jar sherd&quot;, found in 2014 in a stratigraphic context (Level VI) which allows dating it to around 1130 BCE, contains a fragmentary early alphabetic inscription. The remaining nine letters, nine of them in three lines, are perfectly discernable, but they cannot be convincingly combined into words and the words into a text. The undecipherable inscription still is of great palaeographic interest, given the scarcity of Late Bronze Age West Semitic inscriptions found in controlled excavations, as it adds to our knowledge about the evolution of alphabetic script.

===Inscriptions in Paleo-Hebrew===
The first archaeological expedition, the Starkey-Starkey-Tufnell (1932–1939) uncovered the Lachish letters, which were &quot;written to the commander of the garrison at Lachish shortly before it fell to the Babylonians in either 589 or 586 B.C.&quot; The Hebrew letters were written on pieces of pottery, so-called ostraca. Eighteen letters were found in 1935 and three more in 1938, all written in Paleo-Hebrew script. They were from the latest occupational level immediately before the Babylonian siege of 587 BCE. At the time, they formed the only known corpus of documents in classical Hebrew that had come down to us outside of the Hebrew Bible.

====LMLK seals====
Another major contribution to Biblical archaeology from excavations at Lachish are the LMLK seals, which were stamped on the handles of a particular form of ancient storage jar, meaning &quot;of the king&quot;. More of these artifacts were found at this site (over 400; Ussishkin, 2004, pp. 2151–9) than any other place in Israel (Jerusalem remains in second place with more than 300). Most of them were collected from the surface during Starkey&#x27;s excavations, but others were found in Level 1 (Persian and Greek era), Level 2 (period preceding Babylonian conquest by Nebuchadnezzar), and Level 3 (period preceding Assyrian conquest by Sennacherib). It is thanks to the work of David Ussishkin&#x27;s team that eight of these stamped jars were restored, thereby demonstrating lack of relevance between the jar volumes (which deviated as much as 5 gallons or 12 litres), and also proving their relation to the reign of Biblical king Hezekiah. Ussishkin observed that &quot;The renewed excavations confirmed Tufnell&#x27;s suggestion that Level III had been destroyed in 701 BCE. All the royal storage jars, stamped and unstamped alike, date to the reign of Hezekiah, to shortly before the Assyrian conquest.&#x27;

==Fake Darius inscription==
In 2022, Eylon Levy, an adviser to the Israeli president Isaac Herzog, found an inscribed potsherd while visiting Tel Lachish. The sherd bore an Aramaic inscription that read &quot;Year 24 of Darius,&quot; which if genuine would have indicated a date of 498 BCE. The find appeared significant, because it would have been the first time that an inscription bearing the name of Darius the Great had been found in the territory of Yehud Medinata, then a province of the Achaemenid Empire ruled by Darius. Levy reported it to Saar Ganor of the Israel Antiquities Authority—the director of excavations at Tel Lachish—who concluded after laboratory testing that the sherd was authentic, probably a receipt for goods received or shipped. This led to widespread coverage of the find in the international press.

Subsequently the Israel Antiquities Authority issued a statement saying that the sherd was not authentic and had been created by an expert demonstrating inscription techniques to her students. She had come forward after the publicity surrounding the find, and explained she had used an original scrap of worthless pottery from the site and engraved the writing on it. She then discarded it at the tourist section.

<text>Deliberation is a process of thoughtfully weighing options, for example prior to voting. Deliberation emphasizes the use of logic and reason as opposed to power-struggle, creativity, or dialogue. Group decisions are generally made after deliberation through a vote or consensus of those involved.

In legal settings a jury famously uses deliberation because it is given specific options, like guilty or not guilty, along with information and arguments to evaluate. In &quot;deliberative democracy&quot;, the aim is for both elected officials and the general public to use deliberation rather than power-struggle as the basis for their vote.

Individual deliberation is also a description of day-to-day rational decision-making, and as such is an epistemic virtue.

==Trial juries==

In countries with a jury system, the jury&#x27;s deliberation in criminal matters can involve both rendering a verdict and determining the appropriate sentence. In civil cases, the jury decision is whether to agree with the plaintiff or the defendant and rendering a resolution binding actions by the parties based on the results of the trial.

Typically, a jury must come to a unanimous decision before it delivers a verdict; however, there are exceptions. When a jury does not reach a unanimous decision and does not feel it is possible to do so, they declare themselves a &quot;hung jury&quot;, a mistrial is declared, and the trial will have to be redone at the discretion of the plaintiff or prosecutor.

One of the most famous dramatic depictions of this phase of a trial in practice is the film &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;.

==In political philosophy==
In political philosophy, there is a wide range of views regarding how political deliberation becomes possible within particular governmental regimes. Political philosophy embraces deliberation alternatively as a crucial component or as the death-knell of democratic systems. Contemporary democratic theory contrasts democracy with authoritarian regimes. This leads to differing definitions of deliberation within political philosophy. In a broad sense, deliberation involves interaction guided by specific norms, rules, or boundaries. Deliberative ideals often include &quot;face-to-face discussion, the implementation of good public policy, decision making competence, and critical mass.&quot;

The origins of philosophical interest in deliberation can be traced to Aristotle&#x27;s concept of , understood as &quot;prudence&quot; or &quot;practical wisdom&quot;, and its exercise by individuals who deliberate in order to discern the positive or negative consequences of potential actions.

Many modern political philosophers believe that strict norms, rules, or fixed boundaries either in how subjects eligible for political deliberation are formed (John Rawls) or in the types of qualifying arguments (Jürgen Habermas) can hinder deliberation and render it unfeasible.

&quot;Existential deliberation&quot; is a term introduced by emotional public sphere theorists. They argue that political deliberation is an inherent state, not a deployable process. Therefore, deliberation is infrequent and possibly occurs only in face-to-face interactions. This concept aligns with radical deliberation insights, suggesting that politics emerges sporadically as potential within an otherwise inert social environment.

&quot;Pragmatic deliberation&quot; represents the epistemic variation of existential deliberation, focusing on assisting groups in achieving positive outcomes that both aggregate and reshape the perspectives of the affected public.

Advocates of &quot;public deliberation&quot; as an essential democratic practice focus on processes of inclusiveness and interaction in making political decisions. The validity and reliability of public opinion improve with the development of &quot;public judgment&quot; as citizens consider multiple perspectives, weigh possible options, and accept the outcomes of decisions made together.

===Radical deliberation===

Radical deliberation refers to a philosophical view of deliberation inspired by the events of the student revolution in May 1968. It aligns with political theories of radical democracy from figures like Michel Foucault, Ernesto Laclau, Chantal Mouffe, Jacques Rancière, and Alain Badiou. These theories emphasize political deliberation as a means of engaging diverse perspectives, setting the stage for political possibilities. In their view, radical democracy remains open-ended and susceptible to changes beyond individual influence. Instead, it&#x27;s shaped by the discourse resulting from contingent gatherings within larger political entities.

Michel Foucault employs &quot;technologies of discourse&quot; and &quot;mechanisms of power&quot; to explain how deliberation can be hindered or emerge through discourse technologies that give a semblance of agency by reproducing power dynamics among individuals. The concept of &quot;mechanisms&quot; or &quot;technologies&quot; presents a paradox. On one hand, these technologies are intertwined with the subjects who utilize them. On the other, discussing the coordinating machine or technology implies an infrastructure organizing society collectively. This notion suggests distancing individuals from the means of their organization, offering a god&#x27;s-eye view of the social that is coordinated by the movement of its parts.

Chantal Mouffe employs &quot;the democratic paradox&quot; to establish a self-sustaining political model founded on inherent contradictions. These unresolved contradictions fuel productive tensions among subjects who acknowledge each other&#x27;s right to speak. According to Mouffe, the only stable political foundation is the configuration of the social and the certainty of . This signifies that societal re-articulations will persist. Here, process prevails over content: the liberal/popular sovereignty paradox propels radical democracy. functions as a mechanism—an interface connecting human and language machinery, fostering the conditions for ongoing reconfiguration: a positive feedback loop within politics.

Chantal Mouffe and Jacques Rancière hold contrasting views regarding the conditions of politics. For Mouffe, it involves internal rearrangements of existing social structures through &quot;articulations&quot;. Conversely, Rancière sees it as the intrusion of an unaccounted-for externality. In the realm of political &quot;arithmetical/geometric&quot; distinctions, there&#x27;s a clear nod to mechanics or mathematics. Politics endures by perpetuating a dynamic between homeostasis and reconfiguration, akin to what N. Katherine Hayles terms &quot;pattern&quot; and &quot;randomness&quot;. This cycle relies on counting what&#x27;s within the police order. The political mechanism facilitates future reconfigurations by adding new elements, reshaping the social fabric, and then returning to equilibrium, ensuring the perpetuity of an incomplete &quot;whole&quot;. Once more, it&#x27;s a rhetorical paradox driving politics—a foundational arbitrariness in determining who can speak and who can&#x27;t.

<text>John II (Spanish: &quot;Juan II&quot;, Catalan: &quot;Joan II&quot;, Aragonese: &quot;Chuan II&quot; and ; 29 June 1398 – 20 January 1479), called the Great (&quot;el Gran&quot;) or the Faithless (&quot;el Sense Fe&quot;), was King of Aragon from 1458 until his death in 1479. As the husband of Queen Blanche I of Navarre, he was King of Navarre from 1425 to 1479. John was also King of Sicily from 1458 to 1468.

== Biography ==

John was born at Medina del Campo (in the Crown of Castile), the son of King Ferdinand I of Aragon and Eleanor of Alburquerque. In his youth he was one of the &quot;infantes&quot; (princes) of Aragon who took part in the dissensions of Castile during the minority and reign of John II of Castile. Until middle life he was also lieutenant-general in Aragon for his brother and predecessor Alfonso V, whose reign was mainly spent in Italy. In his old age he was preoccupied by incessant conflicts with his Aragonese and Catalan subjects, with Louis XI of France, and in preparing the way for the marriage of his son Ferdinand with Isabella I of Castile which brought about the union of the crowns of Aragon and Castile and which was to create the Monarchy of Spain. His troubles with his subjects were closely connected with tragic dissensions within his own family. In 1432, John II appointed the baron Don Juan Vélaz de Medrano, lord of Igúzquiza, Learza, etc., as his royal chamberlain in an attempt to manage the royal household.

John was first married to Blanche I of Navarre of the House of Évreux. By right of Blanche he became king of Navarre, and on her death in 1441 he was left in possession of the kingdom for his lifetime. But one son, Charles, given the title &quot;Prince of Viana&quot; as heir of Navarre, had been born of the marriage. John quickly came to regard this son with jealousy. After his second marriage, to Juana Enríquez, it grew into absolute hatred, being encouraged by Juana. John tried to deprive his son of his constitutional right to act as lieutenant-general of Aragon during his father&#x27;s absence. Charles&#x27;s cause was taken up by the Aragonese, however, and the king&#x27;s attempt to make his second wife lieutenant-general was set aside.

There followed the long Navarrese Civil War, with alternations of success and defeat, ending only with the death of the prince of Viana, possibly by poison administered by his father in 1461. The institutions of the Principality of Catalonia, who had adopted the cause of Charles and who had grievances of their own, called in a succession of foreign pretenders in the ten years&#x27; Catalan Civil War. John spent his last years contending with them. He was forced to pawn Roussillon, his Catalan possession on the north-east of the Pyrenees, to King Louis XI of France, who refused to part with it.

In his old age John was blinded by cataracts, but recovered his eyesight with an operation (couching) conducted by his physician Abiathar Crescas, a Jew. The Catalan revolt was pacified in 1472, but until his death in 1479 John carried on a war, in which he was generally unfortunate, with his neighbor the French king. He was succeeded by Ferdinand, his son by his second marriage, who was already married to Isabella I of Castile. With his death and son&#x27;s accession to the throne of Aragon, the unification of the realms of Spain under one royal house began in earnest.

== Marriages and issue==
From his first marriage to Blanche of Navarre, John had the following children:
*Charles, Prince of Viana (1421–1461), married Agnes of Cleves (1422–1448), no legitimate issue.

From his second marriage to Juana Enríquez, John had the following children:
*Ferdinand II of Aragon (1452-1516). Married Isabella I of Castile.
*Joanna of Aragon (1455–1517). Married Ferdinand I of Naples.

<doc id="151354" wikidata="Q728551" url="?curid=151354" title="Harewood, West Yorkshire">
<text>Harewood ( ) is a village, civil parish, former manor and ecclesiastical parish, in West Yorkshire, England, today in the metropolitan borough of the City of Leeds. The civil parish population at the 2011 census was 3,734.

==Etymology==
The name of Harewood is first attested in the tenth-century Rushworth Gospels manuscript, in the form &quot;æt Harawuda&quot; (&#x27;at Harewood&#x27;); it is next attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Hareuuode&quot;. Although consideration has been given to an origin involving the Old English word &quot;hār&quot; (&#x27;grey&#x27;), commentators agree that, as the name&#x27;s present-day form suggests, the name comes from the Old English words &quot;hara&quot; (&#x27;hare&#x27;) and &quot;wudu&quot; (&#x27;wood&#x27;). Thus it once meant &#x27;wood characterised by hares&#x27;.

==Location==
Harewood sits in the Harewood ward of Leeds City Council and Elmet and Rothwell parliamentary constituency.

The A61 from Leeds city centre to Harrogate passes through the village. The A659 from Collingham joins the A61 outside the main entrance to Harewood House ( ) to descend the slopes of the Wharfe valley before continuing towards Pool-in-Wharfedale.

==Amenities==

The Harewood Arms public house and hotel is opposite the entrance to the Harewood Estate.

Other facilities in the village include a medical centre, mobile library, cemetery, community cafe, and a village hall.

It is the location of the UK&#x27;s longest motorsport hillclimb, Harewood speed Hillclimb (pronounced ). The exterior set for the soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; is located in the Harewood estate.

==Education==
Harewood C of E Primary School is a state-funded faith school which stands opposite the grounds of the Harewood estate on the A61 and was built by the estate in 1864 for estate workers&#x27; children. In 2005 and 2008 the school was awarded &quot;outstanding&quot; grading following Ofsted inspections. The school maintains its historic links with the estate, the children regularly use its grounds and educational facilities.

Gateways School is an independent private school with a sixth form. The junior school and nursery are co-educational, admitting boys and girls to age 11.

==Manor==
The manor of Harewood was the seat of the de Romelli family, from which it passed by marriage of the heiress Avice de Romelli to her husband William de Curcy II (d. circa 1130), feudal baron of Stoke Curcy (now Stogursey) in Somerset, whose granddaughter and eventual heiress Alice de Curcy (sister and heiress of William de Curcy IV (d.1194)) married Warin FitzGerold (1167-post-1216), eldest son and heir of Henry FitzGerold (d.1174/5), Chamberlain to King Henry II. Alice&#x27;s daughter and sole heiress was Margaret FitzGerold, who married Baldwin de Redvers (1200–1216), eldest son and heir apparent of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon (d.1217) and father of Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon. The eventual heiress was Isabel de Forz, eldest daughter of Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon (1217–1245). Her heir to the manor of Harewood was her distant cousin Warin de Lisle (d.1296) of Cambridgeshire, whose paternal grandmother was Alice FitzGerold. The De Lisle family then moved their seat to Rougemont Castle within the manor of Harewood. Warin&#x27;s son was Robert de Lisle, 1st Baron Lisle (title created 1311) called &quot;of Rougemont&quot; to distinguish his family from the unrelated Baron Lisle &quot;of Wootton, Isle of Wight&quot;, created in 1299. The site of Rougemont Castle was abandoned in about 1366 when the Lisle family built Harewood Castle nearby, of which much of the ruined stone structure survives, also hidden in overgrown woodland. Harewood Castle itself was abandoned as a residence soon after 1600 when it was owned by Sir William Wentworth of Gawthorpe Hall. The manor of Harewood containing both ruined castles was purchased in 1738 by the Lascelles family, which built there as its seat the surviving palatial 18th-century mansion known as Harewood House, still owned by the family, which was created Earl of Harewood in 1812.

==Harewood House==

Harewood House, a country house was designed by architects John Carr and Robert Adam, and built between 1759 and 1771 for Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood. Its garden of more than is set in a landscape of designed by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown.

==All Saints&#x27; Church==

All Saints&#x27; Church, the former parish church, stands to the west of the village, in the grounds of Harewood House which was built in the 18th century. The village was relocated in the late 18th century, leaving the church isolated from the village population. It is a Grade I listed building but is no longer used regularly for worship and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

==Harewood Parish Council==
The area covered by the parish council includes Harewood, Slaid Hill, Wigton Moor and Wike. Wigton Moor is the most populous part of the parish. Weardley was served by its own parish council from 1866 until 1 April 1937, when its parish was abolished and it merged with Harewood. The parish council manages and maintains Harewood Cemetery.

<text>Maria Anna Angelika Kauffmann ( ; 30 October 1741 – 5 November 1807), usually known in English as Angelica Kauffman, was a Swiss Neoclassical painter who had a successful career in London and Rome. Remembered primarily as a history painter, Kauffman was a skilled portraitist, landscape and decoration painter. She was, along with Mary Moser, one of two female painters among the founding members of the Royal Academy in London in 1768.

== Early life ==
Kauffman was born at Chur in Graubünden, Switzerland. Her family moved to Morbegno in 1742, then Como in Lombardy in 1752 at that time under Austrian rule. In 1757, she accompanied her father to Schwarzenberg in Vorarlberg/Austria where her father was working for the local bishop. Her father, Joseph Johann Kauffmann (1707–1782), was a relatively poor man but a skilled Austrian muralist and painter, who was often travelling for his work. He trained Angelica and she worked as his assistant, moving through Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. Angelica, a child prodigy, rapidly acquired four languages from her mother, Cleophea Lutz (1717–1757): German, Italian, French and English.

She also was a talented singer and showed talent as a musician. Angelica was forced to choose between opera and art. She quickly chose art as a Catholic priest told her that the opera was a dangerous place filled with &quot;seedy people.&quot; By her twelfth year she had already become known as a painter, with bishops and nobles sitting for her.

In 1757, her mother died and her father decided to move to Milan. Later visits to Italy of long duration followed. She became a member of the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in 1762. Kauffman and her family moved to Florence in June 1762, where the young artist first discovered the painting style that was coined Neoclassical painting. Moving to Rome in January 1763, Kauffman was introduced to the British community. While learning more English and continuing her portraiture, a few months later the family moved again to Naples. There Kauffman studied works by the Old Masters, and had her first painting sent to a public exhibition in London. Later in 1763, she visited Rome, returning again in 1764. From Rome, she passed to Bologna and Venice, everywhere feted for her talents and charm. Writing from Rome in August 1764 to his friend Franke, Winckelmann refers to her popularity; she was then painting his picture, a half-length; of which she also made an etching. She spoke Italian as well as German, he says, and expressed herself with facility in French and English – one result of the last-named accomplishment being that she became a popular portraitist for British visitors to Rome. &quot;She may be styled beautiful,&quot; he adds, &quot;and in singing may vie with our best virtuosi&quot;. In 1765, her work appeared in England in an exhibition of the Free Society of Artists. She moved to England shortly after and established herself as a leading artist.

== Years in Great Britain ==

While in Venice, Kauffman was persuaded by Lady Wentworth, the wife of the British ambassador, to accompany her to London. One of the first pieces she completed in London was a portrait of David Garrick, exhibited in the year of her arrival at &quot;Mr Moreing&#x27;s great room in Maiden Lane.&quot; The rank of Lady Wentworth opened society to her, and she was everywhere well received, the royal family especially showing her great favour. Her firmest friend, however, was Sir Joshua Reynolds. In his pocketbook her name as &quot;Miss Angelica&quot; or &quot;Miss Angel&quot; appears frequently; and in 1766 he painted her, a compliment which she returned by her &quot;Portrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds&quot;. Another instance of her intimacy with Reynolds is to be found in her variation of Guercino&#x27;s &quot;Et in Arcadia ego&quot;, a subject which Reynolds repeated a few years later in his portrait of Mrs Bouverie and Mrs Crewe.

In 1767 Kauffman was seduced by an imposter going under the name Count Frederick de Horn, whom she married, but they were separated the following year. It was probably owing to Reynolds&#x27;s good offices that she was among the signatories to the petition to the King for the establishment of the Royal Academy. In its first catalogue of 1769, she appears with &quot;R.A.&quot; after her name (an honour she shared with one other woman, Mary Moser); and she contributed the &quot;Interview of Hector and Andromache&quot;, and three other classical compositions. She spent several months in Ireland in 1771, as a guest of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Viscount Townshend, and undertook a number of portrait commissions there. Her notable Irish portraits include those of Philip Tisdall, the Attorney General for Ireland, and his wife Mary, who acted as her patron, and of Henry Loftus, 1st Earl of Ely and his family, including his niece Dorothea Monroe, the most admired Irish beauty of her time. It appears that among her circle of friends was Jean-Paul Marat, then living in London and practising medicine, with whom she may have had an affair.
Her friendship with Reynolds was criticized in 1775 by fellow Academician Nathaniel Hone, who courted controversy in 1775 with his satirical picture &quot;The Conjurer&quot;. It was seen to attack the fashion for Italian Renaissance art and to ridicule Sir Joshua Reynolds, leading the Royal Academy to reject the painting. It also originally included a nude caricature of Kauffman in the top left corner, which he painted out after she complained to the academy. The combination of a little girl and an old man has also been seen as symbolic of Kauffman and Reynolds&#x27;s closeness, age difference, and rumoured affair.

From 1769 until 1782 Kauffman was an annual exhibitor with the Royal Academy, sending sometimes as many as seven pictures, generally on classical or allegoric subjects. One of the most notable was &quot;Leonardo expiring in the Arms of Francis the First&quot; (1778).

In 1773, she was appointed by the Academy with others to decorate St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, a scheme that was never carried out, and it was she who, with Biagio Rebecca, painted the ceiling of the Academy&#x27;s old lecture room at Somerset House.

==History painting==

While Kauffman produced portraits, and self-portraits, she identified herself primarily as a history painter, an unusual designation for a woman artist in the 18th century. History painting was considered the most elite and lucrative category in academic painting during this time period and, under the direction of Sir Joshua Reynolds, the Royal Academy made a strong effort to promote it to a native audience more interested in commissioning and buying portraits and landscapes. Despite Kauffman&#x27;s popularity in British society and her success there as an artist, she was disappointed by the relative apathy of the British towards history painting. Ultimately, she left Britain for Rome, where history painting was better established, held in higher esteem and patronized.

History painting, as defined in academic art theory, was classified as the most elevated category. Its subject matter was the representation of human actions based on themes from history, mythology, literature, and scripture. This required extensive learning in biblical and Classical literature, knowledge of art theory and practical training that included the study of anatomy from the male nude. Most women were denied access to such training, especially the opportunity to draw from nude models; yet Kauffman managed to cross the gender boundary. It is unclear as to how she gained the knowledge of the male anatomy that she had, but there is speculation that she studied plaster casts of statues. The male characters in her artworks are seen as being more feminine than most painters would choose to display, which may be a result of her lack of formal training in male anatomy.

== Later years in Rome ==

In 1781, after her first husband&#x27;s death (she had long been separated from him), she married Antonio Zucchi (1726–1795), a Venetian artist then resident in England. Shortly afterwards she retired to Rome, where she befriended, among others, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; yet, always restive, she wanted to do more and lived for another 25 years with much of her old prestige intact.

In 1782, Kauffman&#x27;s father died, as did her husband in 1795. In 1794, she painted, &quot;Self-Portrait Hesitating Between Painting and Music&quot;, in which she emphasises the difficult choice she had faced in choosing painting as her sole career, in dedication to her mother&#x27;s death. She continued at intervals to contribute to the Royal Academy in London, her last exhibit being in 1797. After this she produced little, and in 1807 she died in Rome, being honoured by a splendid funeral under the direction of Canova. The entire Academy of St Luke, with numerous ecclesiastics and virtuosi, followed her to her tomb in Sant&#x27;Andrea delle Fratte, and, as at the burial of Raphael, two of her best pictures were carried in procession.

== Legacy ==
By the time of her death she had made herself what she considered to be a renowned artist. This explains why her funeral was directed by the well-known Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova. Canova designed her funeral based on the funeral of the Renaissance master Raphael.

By 1911, rooms decorated with her work were still to be seen in various places. At Hampton Court was a portrait of the duchess of Brunswick; in the National Portrait Gallery, a self-portrait (NPG 430).

There were other pictures by her in Paris, at Dresden, in the Hermitage at St Petersburg, in the Alte Pinakothek at Munich, in Kadriorg Palace, Tallinn (Estonia) and in the Joanneum Alte Galerie at Graz. The Munich example was another portrait of herself, and there was a third in the Uffizi at Florence. A few of her works in private collections were exhibited among the Old Masters at Burlington House.

Kauffman is well known for the numerous engravings from her designs by Schiavonetti, Francesco Bartolozzi and others. Those by Bartolozzi especially found considerable favour with collectors. Charles Willson Peale (1741–1827), artist, patriot, and founder of a major American art dynasty, named several of his children after notable European artists, including a daughter, Angelica Kauffman Peale.

A biography of Kauffman was published in 1810 by Giovanni Gherardo De Rossi. The book was the basis of a romance by Léon de Wailly (1838), and it prompted the novel contributed by Anne Isabella Thackeray to the &quot;Cornhill Magazine&quot; in 1875 entitled &quot;Miss Angel&quot;.

The novelist Miranda Miller published a novel &quot;Angelica, Paintress of Minds&quot;, which purports to be an autobiography written during Kauffman&#x27;s last days in Rome. The Historical Novel Society says of the novel: &#x27;Kauffmann is presented as hard-working, loyal, kind, sometimes susceptible but more determined than she thinks she is.&#x27;

From September 2018 to August 2019, the Royal Academy hosted an exhibition by Sarah Pickstone, &quot;An Allegory of Painting,&quot; that paid homage to works by Kauffman that the Academy had commissioned. Pickstone&#x27;s &quot;The Rainbow&quot; reinterpreted Kauffman&#x27;s &quot;Colour&quot;, with &quot;Belvedere&quot; a response to Kauffman’s &quot;Design&quot;.

=== The Angelika Kauffmann Museum ===

The Angelika Kauffmann Museum in Schwarzenberg, Vorarlberg (Austria) was established in 2007. This location is in the same area that her father called home. The annually changing exhibitions focus on different aspects and themes of her artistic work. In the 2019 exhibition &quot;Angelika Kauffmann – Unknown Treasures from Vorarlberg Private Collections&quot;, many of her paintings were shown to the public for the first time, as a large proportion of her oeuvre is owned by private collectors. The museum is housed in the so-called &quot;Kleberhaus&quot;, an old farmhouse (1556) in the typical architectural style of the region.

<doc id="151357" wikidata="Q314278" url="?curid=151357" title="Thomas Chippendale">
<text>Thomas Chippendale (June 1718 – 1779) was an English woodworker in London, designing furniture in the mid-Georgian, English Rococo, and Neoclassical styles. In 1754 he published a book of his designs in a trade catalogue titled &quot;The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker&#x27;s Director&quot;—the most important collection of furniture designs published in England to that point which created a mass market for furniture—upon which success he became renowned. According to the Victoria and Albert Museum, &quot;so influential were his designs, in Britain and throughout Europe and America, that &#x27;Chippendale&#x27; became a shorthand description for any furniture similar to his &quot;Director&quot; designs&quot;.

The designs are regarded as representing the current British fashion for furniture of that period and are now reproduced globally. He was buried 16 November 1779, according to the records of St Martin-in-the-Fields, in the cemetery since built upon by the National Gallery. Chippendale furniture is highly valued; a padouk cabinet that was offered for auction during 2008 sold for £2,729,250.

==Life==

Chippendale was born in Otley in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England in June 1718. He was baptised on 5 June. He was the only child of John Chippendale (1690–1768), joiner, and his first wife Mary (née Drake; 1693–1729). He received an elementary education at Prince Henry&#x27;s Grammar School, Otley. The Chippendale family had long been involved with the wood working trades and so he probably received his basic training from his father, though it is believed that he was also trained by Richard Wood in York, before he relocated to London. Wood later ordered eight copies of the &quot;Director&quot;. On 19 May 1748, he married Catherine Redshaw at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Mayfair and they had five sons and four daughters.

During 1749, Chippendale rented a modest house in Conduit Court, near Covent Garden. In 1752, he relocated to Somerset Court, off the Strand. In 1754, Chippendale relocated to 60–62 St Martin&#x27;s Lane in London, where for the next 60 years the family business operated, until 1813 when his son, Thomas Chippendale (Junior), was evicted for bankruptcy. During 1754, he also began a partnership with James Rannie, a wealthy Scottish merchant, who put money into the business at the same time as Chippendale produced the first edition of the &quot;Director&quot;. Rannie and his bookkeeper, Thomas Haig, probably cared for the finances of the business. His wife, Catherine, died during 1772. After James Rannie died in 1766, Thomas Haig seems to have borrowed £2,000 from Rannie&#x27;s widow, which he used to become Chippendale&#x27;s partner. One of Rannie&#x27;s executors, Henry Ferguson, became a third partner and so the business became Chippendale, Haig and Co. Thomas Chippendale (Junior) assumed management of the business in 1776 allowing his father to retire. He relocated to what was then called Lob&#x27;s Fields (now known as Derry Street) in Kensington. Chippendale married Elizabeth Davis at Fulham Parish Church on 5 August 1777. He fathered three more children. In 1779, Chippendale relocated to Hoxton where he died of tuberculosis and was buried at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 16 November 1779.

There is a statue and memorial plaque dedicated to Chippendale outside The Old Grammar School Gallery in Manor Square, in his home town of Otley, near Leeds, Yorkshire. There is a full-size sculpted figure of Thomas Chippendale on the façade of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

==Work==

After working as a journeyman cabinet maker in London, during 1754, he became the first cabinet-maker to publish a book of his designs, titled &quot;The Gentleman and Cabinet Maker&#x27;s Director&quot;. It is regarded as the &quot;first comprehensive trade catalogue of its kind&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;customers could browse, select a design and then order a piece of furniture&quot;.

Three editions were published, the first in 1754, followed by a virtual reprint in 1755, and finally a revised and enlarged edition in 1762, by which time Chippendale&#x27;s illustrated designs began to show signs of Neoclassicism. Chippendale had considerable competition during his active years, most notably from Ince and Mayhew. From the 1760s Chippendale was influenced heavily by the Neoclassical work of architect Robert Adam.

=== Notable works ===
Chippendale was much more than just a cabinet maker, he was an interior designer who advised on other aspects of decor such as soft furnishings and even the colour a room should be painted. During the company&#x27;s period of greatest success, he worked with other specialists to provide fully decorated and furnished rooms or houses, once the principal construction was done. Chippendale often received large-scale commissions from aristocratic clients. Twenty-six of these commissions have been identified. Here furniture by Chippendale can still be seen. The locations include:
* Sledmere House, Yorkshire, for Sir Christopher Sykes ();
* Nostell Priory, Yorkshire, for Sir Roland Winn (1766–85);
* Blair Castle, Perthshire, for the Duke of Atholl (1758);
* Wilton House, for Henry, 10th Earl of Pembroke ();
* For the actor David Garrick, both in town and at his villa at Hampton, Middlesex;
* Normanton Hall, Rutland and other houses for Sir Gilbert Heathcote (1768–78) that included the management of a funeral for Lady Bridget Heathcote, 1772;
* Harewood House, Yorkshire, for Edwin Lascelles (1767–78);
* Newby Hall, Yorkshire, for William Weddell ();
* Temple Newsam, Yorkshire, for Lord Irwin (1774);
* Paxton House, Berwickshire, Scotland, for Ninian Home (1774–91);
* Burton Constable Hall, Yorkshire for William Constable (1768–79);
* Petworth House, Sussex and other houses for George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont (1777–79);
* Dumfries House, Ayrshire, Scotland, for the 5th Earl of Dumfries.
Chippendale collaborated in furnishing interiors designed by Robert Adam, and at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, and Melbourne House, London, for Lord Melbourne, with Sir William Chambers ().

== Collaborations ==
Chippendale&#x27;s &quot;Director&quot; was used by many other cabinet makers. Consequently, recognisably &quot;Chippendale&quot; furniture was produced in Dublin, Philadelphia, Lisbon, Copenhagen and Hamburg. Catherine the Great and Louis XVI both possessed copies of the &quot;Director&quot; in its French edition. The Director shows four main styles: English with deep carving, elaborate French rococo in the style of Louis XV furniture, Chinese style with latticework and lacquer, and Gothic with pointed arches, quatrefoils and fret-worked legs. His favourite wood was mahogany; in seat furniture he always used solid wood rather than veneers.

==Thomas Chippendale the younger==
The workshop was continued by his son, Thomas Chippendale, the younger (1749–1822), who worked in the later Neoclassical and Regency styles, &quot;the rather slick delicacy of Adam&#x27;s final phase&quot;, as Christopher Gilbert assessed it. A bankruptcy and sale of remaining stock in the St. Martin&#x27;s Lane premises in 1804 did not conclude the company&#x27;s latest phase, as the younger Chippendale supplied furniture to Sir Richard Colt Hoare at Stourhead until 1820.

==Pop culture==
Created by The Walt Disney Company in 1943, the names Chip &#x27;n&#x27; Dale (lead characters in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;) are a pun on Chippendale. He is briefly mentioned by name in the opening of the 2022 film &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale: Rescue Rangers&quot;.

A Chippendale commode is the centre of the story in Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Parson&#x27;s Pleasure&quot;, a 1980 episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;.
