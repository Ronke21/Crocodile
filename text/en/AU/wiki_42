<doc id="151232" wikidata="Q51691" url="?curid=151232" title="Amarillo, Texas">
<text>Amarillo ( ; Spanish for &quot;yellow&quot;) is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the county seat of Potter County, though most of the southern half of the city extends into Randall County. It is the 16th-most populous city in Texas and the most populous city in the Texas panhandle. The estimated population of Amarillo was 200,393 as of April 1, 2020, comprising nearly half of the panhandle&#x27;s population. The Amarillo metropolitan area had an estimated population of 308,297 as of 2020.

The city of Amarillo, originally named Oneida, is situated in the Llano Estacado region. The availability of the railroad and freight service provided by the Fort Worth and Denver Railway contributed to the city&#x27;s growth as a cattle-marketing center in the late 19th century.

Amarillo was once the self-proclaimed &quot;Helium Capital of the World&quot; for having one of the country&#x27;s most productive helium fields. The city is also known as &quot;The Yellow Rose of Texas&quot; (as the city takes its name from the Spanish word for yellow), &quot;Yellow City&quot; for its name, and &quot;Rotor City, USA&quot; for its V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft assembly plant. Amarillo operates one of the largest meat-packing areas in the United States. Pantex, the only nuclear weapons assembly and disassembly facility in the country, is also a major employer. The location of this facility also gave rise to the nickname &quot;Bomb City&quot;.

==History==

During April 1887, John T. Berry, from Abilene, Texas, established a site for a town, choosing a well-watered section along the right-of-way of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway that was building across the Texas Panhandle. Barry and merchants from Colorado City, Texas wanted to make his new townsite the region&#x27;s main trading center. On August 30, 1887, the site won the election for a county seat to be established for Potter County. Availability of the railroad&#x27;s freight service made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.

The settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo (the Spanish word for the color yellow). This probably had been suggested by yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer, or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores. Early residents originally pronounced the city&#x27;s name more similar to the Spanish pronunciation , but it later was supplanted by the current pronunciation.

On June 19, 1888, Henry B. Sanborn, who is given credit as the &quot;Father of Amarillo&quot;, and his business partner Joseph F. Glidden began buying land to move Amarillo to the east after arguing that Berry&#x27;s site was on low ground and would flood during rainstorms. Sanborn offered to trade lots in the new location to businesses in the original city&#x27;s site and help with the expense of moving to new buildings. His incentives gradually won over some people who moved their businesses to Polk Street in the new commercial district. Heavy rains almost flooded Berry&#x27;s part of the town in 1889, prompting even more people to move to Sanborn&#x27;s location. This eventually led to another county-seat election, which made Sanborn&#x27;s site the new county seat in 1893.

By the late 1890s, Amarillo had emerged as one of the world&#x27;s busiest cattle-shipping points, and its population grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an increase in wheat and small grains production during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.

The United States government bought the Cliffside Gas Field with high helium content in 1927 and the Federal Bureau of Mines began operating the Amarillo Helium plant two years later. The plant was the sole producer of commercial helium in the world for many years. The U.S. National Helium Reserve is stored in the Bush Dome Reservoir at the Cliffside facility.
Amarillo was hit by the Dust Bowl in the 1930&#x27;s and entered an economic depression.

World War II led the establishment of Amarillo Army Air Field in east Amarillo and the nearby Pantex Army Ordnance Plant, which produced bombs and ammunition. After the end of the war, both of the facilities were closed. The Pantex Plant was reopened in 1950 and produced nuclear weapons throughout the Cold War.

In 1949, a deadly F4 tornado devastated much of Amarillo, shortly after nightfall on May 15, tearing through the south and east sides of the city, killing seven people, and injuring more than 80 others. The tornado touched down southwest of Amarillo, near Hereford, then tracked northward, on a collision course with Amarillo. The tornado, shortly after 8 pm, ripped through Amarillo&#x27;s most densely populated areas, demolishing almost half of the city, and causing catastrophic damage and loss of life.

In 1951, the army air base was reactivated as Amarillo Air Force Base and expanded to accommodate a Strategic Air Command B-52 Stratofortress wing. The arrival of servicemen and their families ended the city&#x27;s depression. Between 1950 and 1960, Amarillo&#x27;s population grew from 74,443 to 137,969. However, the closure of Amarillo Air Force Base on December 31, 1968, contributed to a decrease in population to 127,010 by 1970. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Amarillo&#x27;s population as 6.1% Hispanic and 88.5% non-Hispanic white.

In the 1980s, ASARCO, Iowa Beef Processors (present-day Tyson Foods), Owens-Corning, and Weyerhaeuser built plants at Amarillo. The Eastridge neighborhood houses many immigrants from countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Burma, many finding employment at the nearby Iowa Beef Processors plant. The following decade, Amarillo&#x27;s city limits encompassed in Potter and Randall Counties. Interstate 27 highway connecting Lubbock to Amarillo was built mostly during the 1980s.

In May 1982, a strong F3 tornado struck Amarillo&#x27;s western suburbs, devastating parts of Dawn, and Bushland. No fatalities were reported.

Following the lead of the Fort Worth and Denver City Railway, predecessors of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad had established services to and from Amarillo. These three carriers maintained substantial freight and passenger depots and repair facilities in the city through most of the 20th century and were major employers within the community.

U.S. Routes 60, 87, 287, and 66 intersect at Amarillo, making it a major tourist stop with numerous motels, restaurants, and curio shops.

==Geography==
Amarillo is located near the middle of the Texas Panhandle. It does not share similar weather characteristics with south and east Texas. It is situated in the grasslands of the Texas Panhandle and is surrounded by dense prairie. Amarillo is infamous for its unpredictable weather patterns, with broad daily temperature changes, raging winds, devastating hailstorms and &quot;northers&quot;, long periods of drought, late frosts, spring tornadoes, dust storms, and floods.

Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have taken place over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. The region&#x27;s surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in playa lakes. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with of it land and of it (0.50%) covered by water. The Amarillo metropolitan area covers four counties: Armstrong, Carson, Potter, and Randall. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado state capitals than it does to Austin. 

Flowing about northeast of Amarillo is the Canadian River, which divides the Western High Plains ecological region. The southern divide of the Western High Plains is the Llano Estacado or Staked Plains geographical region. The river is dammed to form Lake Meredith, a major source of drinking water in the Texas Panhandle region. The city is situated near the Panhandle Field, in a productive gas and oil area, covering in Hartley, Potter, Moore, Hutchinson, Carson, Gray, Wheeler, and Collingsworth Counties. The Potter County portion had the nation&#x27;s largest natural gas reserve. Approximately south of Amarillo is Palo Duro Canyon. The tallest peak is reported to be underground in northeastern Potter County under the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument.

===Climate===

Like most of the Texas Panhandle, Amarillo has a temperate semi-arid climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Both the city and most of the county as a whole lie in USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a. Amarillo is characterized by a winter season featuring large diurnal temperature variation, great day-to-day variability, possible sudden and/or severe Arctic air outbreaks (in Texas, called &quot;blue northers&quot;), possible blizzards and hot summers with generally low humidity. The average annual precipitation is . Much of Amarillo&#x27;s precipitation falls during heavy convective showers and thunderstorms during the late spring and summer months.

According to &#x27;Cities Ranked and Rated&#x27; (Bert Sperling and Peter Sander), Amarillo averages 48 days per year during which thunder and lightning is reported. This is above the national average. These storms can be severe: Amarillo and the Texas Panhandle are situated in the western portion of &quot;Tornado Alley&quot; and are prone to severe weather events, occurring primarily between April and July. Severe thunderstorms can produce damaging straight-line winds, large hail, tornadoes, and flash flooding. Amarillo is no stranger to devastating tornadoes. Tornadoes have occurred in and around the city in 1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 2001, 2007, and most recently in 2013, 2015 and 2016. The strongest tornado to ever hit Amarillo was a deadly F4 tornado that struck the city in the nighttime hours of May 15, 1949. Amarillo suffered a direct hit, causing catastrophic damage and loss of life in Amarillo&#x27;s most densely populated areas. The tornado devastated the south and east sides of the city, killing 7 people, and injuring more than 80 others. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July. Sunny weather prevails year-round, with nearly 3300 hours of bright sunshine annually. The National Weather Service in Amarillo forecasts and provides climatic data for the city.

Extreme temperatures range from on February 12, 1899 to on June 26, 2011, but lows do not typically dip to in most years, while highs above are seen on 4.7 days on average. On average, there are 5.9 days of lows at or below , 8.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing, and 61 days of + highs. Unlike in the Rio Grande Valley or eastern portions of Texas, days where the low does not fall below are relatively rare, due to the aridity and elevation. Blizzards occur occasionally, but snowfall is typically light, averaging nearly seasonally and the median figure is near . Amarillo is also recorded as the windiest city in the U.S. by the Weather Channel.

Amarillo is considered the regional economic center for the Texas Panhandle, as well as Eastern New Mexico and the Oklahoma Panhandle. The meat packing industry is a major employer in Amarillo; about one-quarter of the United States&#x27; beef supply is processed in the area. The city also holds the headquarters for the Texas Cattle Feeders Association. Petroleum extraction is also a major industry. The helium industry decreased in significance after the federal government privatized local operations in the late 1990s. Bell Helicopter Textron opened a helicopter assembly plant near the city&#x27;s international airport in 1999.

The city&#x27;s largest employer in 2005 was Tyson Foods, with 3,700 employees. The Amarillo Independent School District was next with 3,659 employees followed by Pantex, Baptist St. Anthony&#x27;s Health Care System, City of Amarillo, Northwest Texas Healthcare System, Amarillo College, Walmart, and United Supermarkets.

Approximately of agricultural land surrounds the city with corn, wheat, and cotton as the primary crops. Other crops in the area include sorghum, silage, hay, and soybeans. The Texas Panhandle, particularly in Hereford, Texas, serves as a fast-growing milk producing area as several multimillion-dollar state of the art dairies were built in the early 2000s.

The Amarillo Economic Development Corporation (AEDC), funded by a city sales tax, provides aggressive incentive packages to existing and prospective employers. In the mid-to-late 1990s, the AEDC gained notoriety by sending mock checks to businesses across the country, placing full-page advertisements in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and paying an annual $1 million subsidy to American Airlines to retain jet service. The AEDC is largely responsible for bringing Bell Helicopter Textron&#x27;s development of the V-22 Osprey hybrid aircraft and the future site of Marine One assembly in Amarillo.

From 2020 to 2021, Amarillo experienced its greatest amount of economic development in 30 years. Amazon, Asset Protection Unit, and Texas Tech University Vet School were named some major organizations contributing to the city and metropolitan area&#x27;s economic growth. Through the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas, the Amarillo Chamber of Commerce announced a new initiative to help local businesses rebound from the pandemic. Its tourism industry also rebounded.

==Arts and culture==


Several natural attractions are near the city. The Palo Duro Canyon State Park is the United States&#x27; second largest canyon system, after the Grand Canyon and is located south of Amarillo. The canyon is a prominent mountain biking destination and hosts the annual 50-mile Palo Duro Canyon Trail Run. Palo Duro has a distinct hoodoo that resembles a lighthouse. Another natural landmark near the city, the Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is located north of Amarillo. It had been the site for prehistoric inhabitants to obtain flint in order to make tools and weapons. About southeast of Amarillo in Briscoe County is Caprock Canyons State Park and Trailway, the state park is the home of the official Texas State Bison Herd captured and taken care of by cattle rancher Charles Goodnight.

Local millionaire Stanley Marsh 3 funded many public art projects in the city including the Cadillac Ranch, located west of Amarillo on Interstate 40, a monument of painted Cadillac automobiles that were dug into the ground head first. Marsh also participated in an ongoing art project called the Dynamite Museum, which consists of thousands of mock traffic signs. These signs, bearing messages such as &quot;Road does not end&quot; or displaying a random picture, are scattered throughout the city of Amarillo. Besides these works, close to the city is the final earthwork of Robert Smithson (and another commission by Marsh), &quot;Amarillo Ramp&quot;.

The city has events and attractions honoring the cowboy and Texas culture. During the third week of September, the Tri-State Fair &amp; Rodeo brings participants mostly from Oklahoma, New Mexico and Texas to Amarillo since 1921. On the Tri-State Exposition grounds, the Amarillo National Center is a special events center for events ranging from national equestrian competitions to motor sports and rodeos. The World Championship Ranch Rodeo sponsored by the Working Ranch Cowboys Association is held every November in the Amarillo Civic Center. The Amarillo Livestock Auction on Bull Road holds a free-to-the-public cattle auction on Tuesdays.

The nonprofit community theater group, Amarillo Little Theatre, has its season run from September to May. The theater group&#x27;s two facilities, the Mainstage and the Adventure Space, are located west of Amarillo&#x27;s downtown. The Pioneer Amphitheater, located in nearby Palo Duro Canyon, is the setting for the outdoor musical drama &quot;Texas,&quot; which plays nightly during the summer. The musical depicts a story about the history of Texas Panhandle settlers throughout the years. In 2002, the producers changed its name to &quot;Texas Legacies&quot; after retiring the previous script that was used for 37 years for a more historically accurate one, but attendance declined over the next four seasons, so it was decided to revert to the original Paul Green script in 2006.

The Amarillo Public Library is affiliated with the Harrington Library Consortium. The consortium consists of public, college, and school libraries located in the Texas Panhandle that share resources and cooperate with one another. Other members include Amarillo&#x27;s public schools, Amarillo College, Canyon Area Library, Lovett Memorial Library in Pampa, Texas, and Hutchinson County Library in Borger, Texas.

In addition, the AQHA and Center City of Amarillo co-sponsor the project, &quot;Hoof Prints of the American Quarter Horse&quot; consisting of horse statues located in front of several Amarillo businesses, such as the downtown Amarillo National building, Nationwide Insurance, and Edward Jones. An area business would purchase a horse statue for a local artist to paint.

Two of the Amarillo area&#x27;s higher education institutions have at least one museum in their campuses. The Amarillo Art Center , opened in 1972, is a building complex with the Amarillo Museum of Art (AMoA) and concert hall located on the Washington Street Campus of Amarillo College. Located on the campus of West Texas A&amp;M University, the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum claims to be the largest historical museum in Texas.

The museum, now rebuilding its collection as Texas Air &amp; Space Museum, is located on American Drive on the south side of the airport.

===Cityscape===
Most of Amarillo&#x27;s population growth and commercial development is occurring in the southern and northwestern parts of the city. Similar to many towns in the Texas Panhandle, the city&#x27;s downtown has suffered economic deterioration throughout the years. To help revitalize it, the Center City of Amarillo organization was formed to establish partnerships with groups that have a large presence in the city. Since its conception in the 1990s, Center City has sponsored public art projects and started block parties in the downtown area.

The 31-story FirstBank Southwest Tower was opened in Amarillo&#x27;s downtown in 1971. Completed in the same year as the FirstBank Southwest Tower, the Amarillo National Bank Plaza One building houses the headquarters of Amarillo National Bank, the city&#x27;s largest financial institution. The Santa Fe Building, completed in 1930 as the regional office of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, was vacant for several years until 1995 when Potter County bought it for $426,000 to gain new office spaces.
Amarillo&#x27;s historic homes and buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places reflect the economic growth from around 1900 to the start of World War II. Polk Street contains many of the city&#x27;s historic downtown buildings and homes. The large historic homes on this street were built close to downtown, and homes were located on the west side of the street as a symbol of status because they would be greeted with the sunrise every morning.

The city of Amarillo&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department operates over 50 municipal parks, including a skatepark west of the city. Amarillo&#x27;s largest parks are Medical Park, Thompson Memorial Park, and Memorial Park, near Amarillo College&#x27;s Washington Street Campus. From 1978 to 2002, the Junior League of Amarillo and the city of Amarillo&#x27;s Parks and Recreation Department co-sponsored Funfest, a family entertainment festival, benefiting the city parks and the league&#x27;s Community Chest Trust Fund. Funfest was held in Thompson Memorial Park during Memorial Day weekend.

Another part of Amarillo&#x27;s sporting history was its roots in professional wrestling. Amarillo residents Dory Funk, Stanley Blackburn and Doc Sarpolis promoted the territory for several decades. Funk&#x27;s sons, Dory Funk, Jr. and Terry Funk, were National Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Champions representing Amarillo.

==Government==
===Local government===
In 1913, Amarillo became the first Texas city and the fifth in United States to use the council-manager form of municipal government, with all governmental powers resting in a legislative body, called a council (before 2014, it was called a commission). Five elected commissioners, one of whom is the mayor, comprise the council. All serve a two-year term. The commission&#x27;s role is to pass ordinances and resolutions, adopt regulations, and appoint city officials including the city manager. Although the mayor serves as a presiding officer of the commission, the city manager is the administrative head of the municipal government and is responsible for the administration of all departments. The city commission meets on Tuesday of each week.

==Infrastructure==
===Air transportation===
Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport is a public airport located east of the central business district of Amarillo, north of Interstate 40. A portion of the former Amarillo Air Force Base was converted to civilian use and became part of the airport. The airport is named after NASA astronaut Rick Husband, an Amarillo native and commander of the final flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;, STS-107, which disintegrated on re-entry killing Husband and his crewmates. Several major air carriers offer non-stop service to Dallas, Houston, Austin, Denver, Phoenix and Las Vegas.

Tradewind Airport is a public-use general aviation airport located in Randall County, south of Amarillo&#x27;s central business district. The airport covers and has two asphalt-paved runways and one helipad.

Buffalo Airport is a public-use general aviation airport located in Randall County, south of Amarillo&#x27;s central business district. The airport covers and has two grass runways.

===Ground transportation===
Local transit services in the city have been available since 1925 and have been provided through the City of Amarillo&#x27;s Amarillo City Transit (ACT) department since 1966; before that time the system was privately owned. ACT operates bus services that include fixed route transit and demand response paratransit which are designed for people with disabilities. Each year ACT transports approximately 350,000 passengers on the fixed route and 30,000 paratransit passengers.

Amarillo has no passenger rail service but remains an important part of the rail freight system. The last passenger train out of the city was the Santa Fe Railroad&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Chief,&quot; from Chicago, in 1971. The &quot;Texas Zephyr&quot; between Denver and Dallas last served Amarillo in 1967.

The BNSF Railway complex in Amarillo continues to serve a heavy daily traffic load, approximately 100â110 trains per day. The Union Pacific Railroad also sends substantial shipments to or through Amarillo. In addition to intermodal and general goods, a big portion of rail shipments are of grains and coal. There have been various proposals over the years to add passenger service. One, the &quot;Caprock Chief&quot;, would have seen daily service as part of a Fort Worth, TexasâDenver, Colorado service, but it failed to gain traction.
The streets in Amarillo&#x27;s downtown area conform to a grid pattern. The city&#x27;s original street layout was set up by William H. Bush. Beginning at the west end of the town moving to the east, Bush named the north to south streets for past United States presidents, in chronological order except for John Quincy Adams because the surname had been taken by the second president, John Adams. The last president so honored was Grover Cleveland; as the city expanded eastward the pattern was not continued.

While the streets running northâsouth are designated &#x27;streets&#x27;, eastâwest streets are numbered and are designated &#x27;avenues&#x27;. North of the Fort Worth &amp; Denver (now BNSF) railyard, the numbers are &quot;NW&quot; (northwest) west of Polk Street and &quot;NE&quot; (northeast) east of Polk. South of the railyard (including the downtown-city center area), numbers are officially &quot;SW&quot; (southwest) west of Polk, and &quot;SE&quot; (southeast) east of Polk. Colloquially, though, most tend to dub the SW and SE avenues as W (west) and E (east), respectively. One example of the numbering difference is the former U.S. Highway 66 routing west of downtown and into the San Jacinto neighborhood. Most call it &#x27;West Sixth Street&#x27; instead of SW Sixth Avenue.

In 1910, the Amarillo voters had approved to pay for street paving with bricks. As of 2003, the city still has of brick streets in some parts of the downtown area. In 2002, the city spent $200,000 to restore one block of brick street on Ninth Avenue between Polk and Tyler streets.

===Major highways===
Amarillo is served by two interstate highways: I-27 and I-40. Amarillo is also the northern terminus for I-27, of which less than one mile (~1.6Â km) is located in Potter County. The highway terminates at the city&#x27;s main westâeast highway, Interstate 40, just north of the PotterâRandall county line. The roadway continues northward into downtown Amarillo via U.S. 60, 87, and 287, via a series of four one-way streets including Buchanan, Pierce, Fillmore and Taylor. North of downtown the highway becomes US 87 &amp; 287 and continues northward to Dumas.

Interstate 40, the city&#x27;s major eastâwest thoroughfare, was completed entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across the center of the city. Previously, Route 66 had been the city&#x27;s major eastâwest highway, generally following Amarillo Boulevard to the north of the downtown area and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which had been an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the downtown area and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district (now now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses), passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Boulevard before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.
Loop 335 circles around Amarillo in all four directions and consists of four-lane roadway on its northeast and southwest quadrants and two-lane paving to the southeast and northwest.

Amarillo is also mentioned in the song &quot;Route 66&quot;.

===Future freeways===
In 2015, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) published the plans for the all new Loop 335 freeway that encircles the city of Amarillo. TxDOT has planned multiple multi-level interchanges that intersect with Interstate 40, Interstate 27, and U.S. 287 and 87. The first interchange, on the East side of Amarillo, is a multi-level interchange that provides access to both directions of the I-40 Expressway and Loop 335. On the northern side of Amarillo, the loop will be completely reconstructed to an Interstate-Grade freeway with complete grade separations and will be expanded to four lanes. It also includes a stack interchange that will connect the new freeway to the future I-27 Ports to Plains Corridor (Highway 287, 87). I-27 in Southern Amarillo will be entirely reconstructed from Buffalo Stadium Rd. at the Canyon E-Way Interchange to Palo Duro Canyon State Park. It will accommodate six lanes at the mainlane bridge along with a complete stack interchange with direct connectors to and from I-27. Furthermore, another triple-level interchange will be built to accommodate Soncy Road, Helium Road, I-27 and the new loop. Also, another new mainlane bridge that accommodates up to six lanes is also in the works for I-40 near Helium Rd. providing easier access to the new freeway. Although construction started in 2016, the entire project, which includes converting the entire loop to Interstate Specifications, was not expected to be complete until 2024.

===Medical centers and hospitals===

Amarillo is home to medical facilities including Baptist St. Anthony&#x27;s and Northwest Texas Hospitals, the Don &amp; Sybil Harrington Cancer Center, Bivins Memorial Nursing Home, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Texas Tech School of Pharmacy, and Texas Panhandle Mental Health and Mental Retardation. All are located in the Harrington Regional Medical Center, the first specifically designated city hospital district in Texas.

Baptist St. Anthony&#x27;s, known locally as BSA, had some of its services listed on the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;s &quot;Top 50 Hospitals&quot; from 2002 to 2005. BSA was a result of a 1996 merger between the Texas Panhandle&#x27;s first hospital, St Anthony&#x27;s, with High Plains Baptist Hospital. The BSA Hospice &amp; Life Enrichment Center provides important services to the Amarillo area. The BSA facility, opened in 1985, was the first free-standing hospice west of the Mississippi River to be built and opened without debt.
Northwest Texas Hospital is home to the area&#x27;s only Level III designated trauma center.

The Thomas E. Creek Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center is located east of Harrington Regional Medical Center. The facility opened in 1940 and was renamed in 2005, honoring the 18-year-old Amarillo Marine who had been posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Construction began in 2006 for a new Texas State Veterans Home in northwest Amarillo. The United States government, through the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, provided the funding to build the facility; the Texas government will run it after construction is completed. The Ussery-Roan Texas State Veterans Home opened in 2007.

===Utilities===
Drinking water is provided by the City of Amarillo and its Utilities Division. Amarillo&#x27;s water supply used to come from both from Lake Meredith and the Ogallala Aquifer. Due to the lake&#x27;s low water level, water is now only supplied by the aquifer. Lake Meredith is located northeast of Amarillo and in 2005 it contained at least of water. By 2011, lake levels had dropped so much due to the Texas drought that the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority voted to stop using it entirely. However, increased rainfall in recent years has helped the lake regain much of its volume. Generally, the city&#x27;s daily water production averages between .

Collection and disposal of the city&#x27;s trash and garbage are the responsibilities of the City of Amarillo&#x27;s Solid Waste Collection and Solid Waste Disposal Departments. Amarillo&#x27;s non-hazardous solid waste is collected for burial in the city&#x27;s landfill. The City of Amarillo also operates recycling collection centers, one located near the downtown area and four at fire stations in the city. Other utilities are primarily provided by private organizations. Natural gas is distributed by Atmos Energy. Electric power service is distributed by Xcel Energy, through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Amarillo-based Southwestern Public Service Company. Wired telephone service is mainly provided by AT&amp;T. Cable television is primarily provided by Suddenlink Communications.

==In popular culture==
===Outside media attention===
The city gained national media attention in 1998 when local cattlemen unsuccessfully sued television talk show host Oprah Winfrey for comments made on her show connecting American beef to mad cow disease, costing them and their industry millions of dollars. In order to attend the trial in Amarillo, she temporarily relocated her show to the Amarillo Little Theatre for nearly a year. During the trial, Winfrey hired Dallas-based jury consultant Phil McGraw to aid her attorneys on selecting and analyzing the members of the jury. McGraw would later become a regular guest on Winfrey&#x27;s television show and subsequently started his own talk show, &quot;Dr. Phil&quot;, in 2002.

Another notable trial in Amarillo was the Fort Worth-area murder case of T. Cullen Davis, which involved one of the richest men in the United States, his former wife, and her daughter and boyfriend. The trial was moved from Fort Worth to Amarillo in 1977 on a change of venue. The 1997 murder of Brian Deneke and subsequent trial also brought national attention because it highlighted social divisions in the community that mirrored those in America as a whole. The defendant in the trial was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and received a light sentence. The movie Bomb City is based on the events surrounding Deneke&#x27;s murder.

The small town of Tulia, Texas, approximately south from Amarillo, was the scene of a controversial drug sting in 1999. Local civil rights attorney Jeff Blackburn took up the case of the Tulia defendants, which became a &quot;cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre&quot; and resulted in the exoneration and pardon of the defendants. A federal lawsuit directed at the officials responsible for the sting operation was held in Amarillo. In the final settlement, the City of Amarillo agreed to pay $5Â million in damages to the former Tulia defendants; disband the Panhandle Regional Narcotics Task Force that it set up to oversee the sting operation; and require early retirement for two Amarillo Police Department officers who were responsible for supervising the sting&#x27;s sole undercover agent.

On May 5, 2020, Amarillo ranked 13th in the nation for Highest Average Daily Growth Rate of COVID-19 cases by the New York Times.

* &quot;A Quick Death In Texas&quot; (Clutch)
* &quot;Running Gun&quot; (Marty Robbins)
* &quot;Two Lane Blacktop&quot; (Rob Zombie) 

Tony Christie&#x27;s 1971 cover of &quot;Is This the Way to Amarillo&quot;, written by Neil Sedaka and Howard Greenfield, topped the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks in 2005, breaking the record for the longest time taken for a song to top the UK Singles Chart after its original release set by Jackie Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Reet Petite&quot; in December 1986. Christie&#x27;s record was broken 16 years later when &quot;Last Christmas&quot; by Wham! topped the UK Singles Chart in January 2021, 36 years and 1 month after its original release (a record subsequently broken in June 2022 when &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; by Kate Bush topped the chart 36 years and 10 months after it originally entered the chart).

===In film and television===
The Amarillo Film Commission is a division of the Amarillo Convention and Visitor Council that was created to provide film crews with locations and other assistance when filming in Amarillo. Amarillo was the setting for several motion pictures, including &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, &quot;Switchback&quot;, and &quot;The Plutonium Circus&quot;, the 1995 South by Southwest Film Festival winner for best documentary feature. Amarillo also features heavily in the &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; episode of the same name, the third of the show&#x27;s second season, in which protagonist Jimmy McGill visits the city to solicit clients.

<text>Alba ( ) is a town located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 69 and Farm To Market Road 17 on the western edge of Wood County, Texas, United States, south of Lake Fork and approximately ten miles west of Quitman. The population was 473 in the 2020 U.S. Census.

==History==
A gunsmith named Joseph Simpkins was likely the first to settle the area, arriving here with his family from Missouri around 1843. The area was previously alternately known as Albia and Simpkins&#x27; Prairie. Theories on how the community got its name differ; one claims it was because the town had been intended for white settlers only while another claims it was named for the son of a railroad official.

The Alba Oilfield was discovered just south of Alba in 1848 by F.R. Jackson.

The Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad came through Alba in 1881. One of the earliest shipments to Alba is reported to have been a telegraph office and, reportedly one of the first telegraphs received told details of the assassination of President James Garfield. Later that year, Alba also received a post office. It closed briefly in 1882 but reopened that same year.

By 1882, a townsite had been laid out and a number of merchants were opened in the area to serve the influx of railroad-tie cutters; population was 50 by 1884 and 300 by 1896.

A lignite coal deposit was discovered near Alba around 1900 and in 1902 and 1903, the Texas Short Line Railway was constructed to ship coal from Alba and nearby Hoyt to Grand Saline in Van Zandt County. By 1911, five area mines produced about 40,000 tons of coal per month. Population was around 1,500 by this year. Unlike other coal mines in the state, those at Alba were forced to use convict labor, because Alba was a sundown town that banned African Americans and Hispanics from living or working there.

By 1990, the boundaries of Alba had expanded in to nearby Rains County, and the city had a population of 489, which dropped to 430 in 2000.

In 2008, the town received national attention following the Caffey family murders.

<text>Overton is a city in Rusk and Smith counties in the U.S. state of Texas. Overton lies in two counties as well as two metropolitan areas. The Rusk County portion of the city is part of the Longview Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the Smith County portion is part of the Tyler Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The population was 2,275 at the 2020 census.

==History==

It was known to the Choctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks who lived in the area as Tiyuk Hekia (Standing Pine); many years later, when it was incorporated, it became known as Overton.

The town was named after Major Frank Overton, an early settler and landowner who donated some of his land for the town site. It was platted in 1873 and a post office was granted that year.

Overton was originally intended to be a crossroads for two railroads. In 1875, the Henderson and Overton Branch Railroad, long, was completed and was later joined by the International-Great Northern. When the nearby communities of Bellview, Jamestown, Rocky Mount, and Salem were all bypassed by the railroad, Overton gained the businesses and people who wanted to benefit from the railroad lines. The town offered lots for businesses to relocate, and many took the offer.

The Masons and Odd Fellows built the first school, and a church was constructed in 1875. By 1888 the population had increased to 500 and had all essential businesses, including a newspaper. Overton prospered as an agricultural community, and in 1904 the population had reached 568.

Oklahoman wildcatter C. M. &quot;Dad&quot; Joiner was drilling his third well in 1930, and the town of Overton helped raise the funds he needed to drill. When the well came in, Overton shared in Joiner&#x27;s success, as churches, schools, and a refinery were built. Hubbard College was founded during this time as well. The town&#x27;s once agrarian-based economy suddenly revolved entirely around the production of oil.

Overton&#x27;s population skyrocketed from 426 in 1931 to 3,000 in 1933. By 1936 it was up to 4,500 and the town went through the Great Depression relatively unscathed. But by the end of World War II the population had declined by halfâreaching just 2,000 in the 1950s and remaining at that level through the 1970s. In the 1980s Overton was Rusk County&#x27;s &quot;second city&quot; with a population of 2,430 in 1983. By the 1990s Overton extended into neighboring Smith County.

The City of Overton has had a storied history with radical groups claiming the site as their base of operations. The Republic of Texas operated within the city limits from the early 2000s, up until the building was mysteriously burned down. Overton has a historical voting base consisting primarily of older, Republican-leaning voters.

<text>Newark is a city in Tarrant and Wise counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 1,096 in 2020.

==History==
According to the &quot;Handbook of Texas&quot;, settlement began in the mid-1850s, referring to the community as Caddo Village because of numerous remnants of the Caddo Indian culture found along the banks of the West Fork of the Trinity River. After the Rock Island Railroad reached the town in 1893, officials surveyed town lots; the community was named after Newark, New Jersey, perhaps the hometown of G. K. Foster, the civil engineer who helped survey the town. Newark was a prosperous farming community until the 1920s. It regained its status as a retail market for area farmers by the end of the 1940s. In 1951 Newark incorporated.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="151238" wikidata="Q1997485" url="?curid=151238" title="Littleport">
<text>Littleport is a town in East Cambridgeshire, in the Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, England. It lies about north-east of Ely and south-east of Welney, on the Bedford Level South section of the River Great Ouse, close to Burnt Fen and Mare Fen. There are two primary schools, Millfield Primary and Littleport Community, and a secondary, Vista Academy. The Littleport riots of 1816 influenced the passage of the Vagrancy Act 1824.

==History==
With an Old English name of &quot;Litelport&quot;, the village was worth 17,000 eels a year to the Abbots of Ely in 1086.

The legendary founder of Littleport was King Canute. A fisherman gave the king shelter one night, after drunken monks had denied him hospitality. After punishing the monks, he made his host the mayor of a newly founded village.

The Littleport Riots of 1816 broke out after war veterans from the Battle of Waterloo returned home, only to find they could get no work and grain prices had gone up. They took to the streets and smashed shops and buildings until troops were brought in. St George&#x27;s church registers were destroyed in the riots. The remaining registers start from 1754 (marriages), 1756 (burials), and 1783 (baptisms). Some original documents to do with the riots are held in Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies at the County Record Office, Cambridge.

In 2003, a Harley-Davidson statue was unveiled in Littleport to mark the centenary of the motorcycle company. William Harley, father of the company&#x27;s co-founder William Sylvester Harley, was born in Victoria Street, Littleport, in 1835 and emigrated to the United States in 1859.

==Governance==
Littleport is a civil parish with an elected council. Town council meetings are held in the Barn.

The second tier of local government in Littleport was Ely Rural District from 1894 to 1974, when East Cambridgeshire District Council was formed based in Ely. The third tier is Cambridgeshire County Council.

The parish belongs to the parliamentary constituency of Ely and East Cambridgeshire.

==Economy==
Thomas Peacock, who founded the gentlemen&#x27;s tailoring chain Hope Brothers, was born in Littleport in 1829. Peacock had several shops in London starting from one in Ludgate Hill. The first three-storey Hope Brothers shirt and collar-making factory was opened in the village in 1881 in White Hart Lane. By 1891 it was employing 300â400 women and children. It had a social club and library. For a period in the 1940s and 1950s, Hope Brothers also manufactured the England football kit. The factory was later taken over by Burberry.

From 1979 to 1983, the firm of Jim Burns guitars was based in Padnal Road in Littleport. It produced guitars such as the Steer, popularized by Billy Bragg.

==Little Ouse==
Littleport Parish includes the hamlet of Little Ouse which comes under the Littleport East ward. Little Ouse is now wholly residential: the pub &quot;(Waterman&#x27;s Arms)&quot; and the Church of St John the Evangelist have become private dwellings.

The lowest trig point in Britain is near Little Ouse; it sits at below sea level.

==Climate==

Cambridgeshire&#x27;s average annual rainfall of makes it one of Britain&#x27;s driest counties. Protected from the cool onshore coastal breezes east of the region, the county is warm in summer and cold and frosty in winter.

The nearest Met Office weather station is Cambridge NIAB.

Several other local weather stations report periodic figures to the internet. For example, via Weather Underground, Inc.

==World War II==
On 16 December 1944, British double agent Eddie Chapman was flown on a mission to Britain by the Germans in a fast and manoeuvrable small fighter plane, that took off from a forward Luftwaffe fighter station on the Dutch coast. The purpose of the mission was to monitor the accuracy of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 rockets falling on London and then to report back their effect on the morale of the population in order to improve the performance and devastation of the attacks. After following the bombs to London, Chapman&#x27;s fighter rerouted to East Anglia to enable him to bail out over flat ground.

The fighter had been converted for parachuting by cutting a small trap door in the floor. The low-flying fighter was picked up by a British night-fighter and attacked over the dropping zone. Chapman scrambled head first through the trap door, with his parachute initially getting stuck. Whilst floating down to the ground he witnessed the British night-fighter re-engage the German fighter, which burst into flames and exploded in a fireball as it hit the ground killing the remaining crew. Chapman landed near Apes Hall, Littleport, in the middle of the night. He woke the farm foreman George Convine by banging on the hall door. To avoid difficult questions, Corvine was told by Chapman that he was a crashed British airman and that he needed him to call the police.

==Local folklore and legends==
===Black dog hauntings===
Littleport is home to two different legends of spectral black dogs, which have been linked to the Black Shuck folklore of the East of England but differ in significant aspects.

The local folklorist W. H. Barrett tells a story set before the English Reformation, of a local girl gathering wild mint from a nearby mere, who is rescued from a lustful friar by a huge black dog, both of which are killed in the struggle. The local men throw the body of the friar into the mere, but bury with honour the dog, which is then said to haunt the area.

Cambridgeshire folklorist Enid Porter tells stories from the 19th century of a black dog haunting the A10 road between Littleport and the neighbouring hamlet of Brandon Creek. Local residents are kept awake on dark nights by the sounds of howling and travellers hear trotting feet behind them and feel hot breath on the back of their legs. Local legend says that the dog is awaiting the return of its owner, who drowned in the nearby River Great Ouse in the early 1800s. This haunting reportedly ended in 1906, when a local resident drove his car into something solid, which was never found, next to the spot where the dog&#x27;s owner supposedly drowned.

===Cultural reference===
Littleport provided the inspiration for Great Deeping, the imaginary location of the &quot;Paradise Barn&quot; children&#x27;s novels by Victor Watson, set in the Second World War.

The 1944 Race was held on the River Great Ouse between Littleport and Queen Adelaide, Cambridgeshire, near Ely. The Boat Race 2021 was held here because of the COVID-19 pandemic and safety issues with Hammersmith Bridge on the Thames.

<text>Anderson Mill is a neighborhood of Austin and a former census-designated place (CDP) in Travis and Williamson counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 7,199 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Anderson Mill is located at (30.455050, -97.809262). This is about north of downtown Austin.

==History==

Anderson Mill is named after Thomas Anderson. He moved from Virginia to Texas in the 1850s. In the 1860s he set up a mill there to make gunpowder for the Confederate Army.

After the war Anderson converted the mill to a gristmill. He later also started a cotton gin. In 1884 the area had a population of 30. It had received a post office in 1876 but this office was discontinued in 1884. After Anderson&#x27;s death in 1894 the community was abandoned. In 1936 a historical marker was placed to mark the spot. It was not until the late 20th century with the growth of the area as a suburb of Austin that Anderson Mill came back into existence.

The area was included in a municipal utility district (MUD) in 1973, which was first named the Williamson County Municipal Utility District Number 1. The first houses were built in 1975, and construction continued into 1985 with the completion of approximately 3400 homes. In 1988, at the MUD&#x27;s request, the Texas Water Commission approved a name change to the Anderson Mill Municipal Utility District. The district provided water, wastewater, trash collection. parks and recreation facilities and services. The area has seven neighborhood parks, two junior olympic swimming pools, eight lighted tennis courts, six extensive playscapes, two basketball courts, three sand volleyball courts, six pavilions of various sizes, an athletic field with both soccer and softball fields and nearly six miles of hike and bike trails that meander through the neighborhood following Lake Creek and its tributaries. In 2008, the growing City of Austin annexed the MUD and took over the water and wastewater services. An agreement with the City of Austin and the MUD allowed the residents of the district to voted to create the Anderson Mill Limited District which would retain possession of all the park and recreation facilities. The Limited District would maintain all the park and recreation facilities and provide recreation services to district residents. This service would be supported by both activity fees and a property tax.

<text>Cedar Park is a city and a suburb of Austin in the state of Texas, approximately northwest of the center of Austin. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population was 77,595, and in 2022 was estimated to be 77,642.

==History==

Before the arrival of European settlers in the 19th century, the Cedar Park area was inhabited by Native American tribes including the Tonkawa, the Lipan Apache, and the Comanche. A Paleoamerican archaeological site (named the Wilson-Leonard site) was discovered in Cedar Park in 1973 that showed evidence of continual habitation of the area since circa 5000 BC.

In the mid-19th century the community was known as Running Brushy, named after a spring that formed the headwaters of a creek of the same name. In 1873 George and Harriet Cluck, after having run cattle up the Chisholm Trail for many years, bought of land that included the Running Brushy spring. Their ranch formed the core of the community that would one day become Cedar Park.

Ten years later, the railroad came through. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad, which connected the state capitol with the cities of Burnet and Lampasas to the north, was finished in 1882 and passed through Running Brushy and the Cluck ranch. The community was at this point renamed Bruggerhoff, after a railroad company official. However, the name was generally disliked by locals, being both hard to spell and pronounce. In 1887, Emmett Cluck (son of George and Harriet) changed the community name to Cedar Park. In 1892, a &quot;strolling park&quot; of was built near the train depot. Austinites would ride the train to Cedar Park for day trips to the park.

Cedar Park changed little until the 1950s and 1960s, when the growth of nearby Austin spilled over. On February 24, 1973, the citizens of Cedar Park voted to incorporate. The estimated population was 1,765. A library followed in 1978.

On May 27, 1997, a strong and destructive F3 tornado struck the town. The tornado was one of 20 confirmed tornadoes that occurred during the 1997 Central Texas Tornado outbreak.

On December 9, 2016, Cedar Park unveiled the flag design that won. On August 8, 2019, the City Council voted to rescind that particular design after &quot;pushback on social media&quot; from residents. As of September 2021, the city has no formal flag.

Leander was established in 1882 on land sold by the Austin and Northwestern Railroad Co. to prospective citizens. The town was named in honor of Leander &quot;Catfish&quot; Brown, one of the railroad officials responsible for the completion of the line.

Tumlinson Fort, the first white settlement in Williamson County, was established in early January 1836 at the headwaters of Brushy Creek, four miles south of present-day Leander. With the purpose of protecting white settlers from attacks by Comanche Indians, a company of Texas Rangers occupied the post until late February, when the invasion of Santa Anna made it necessary for the post to be abandoned, soon after which it was burned by the Comanche.

The Webster Massacre occurred near present-day Leander in August 1839, when a party of about 30 settlers traveling westward through the area were attacked by Comanche Indians and all but three were killed.

It was near Leander that the Leanderthal Lady, a skeleton dating back 10,000 to 13,000 years, was discovered; the site was one of the earliest intact burials found in the United States.

<text>Pflugerville ( ) is a city in Travis County, Texas, United States, with a small portion in Williamson County. The population was 65,191 at the 2020 census. Pflugerville is a suburb of Austin and part of the AustinâRound Rockâ Metropolitan Statistical Area. It was named after the original German settlers who farmed the area starting in 1849. The city was first incorporated in July of 1965. The vast majority of the city lies within Travis County, but small parts of it extend into Williamson County. 

==History==
===Pfluger homestead===
The area was initially settled by German immigrant Henry Pfluger Sr. (1803â1867) and members of his family from late 1849 into early 1850. Pfluger had been a wealthy farmer in Germany, but lost all of his property during the revolutions of 1848. He arrived in the country with $1,600 and purchased of land two miles (3Â km) east of Austin from John Liese, a brother-in-law who had immigrated before him. In 1853, Pfluger paid Liese $960 for a tract of land in an area known as Brushy Knob. There, the family lived in a five-room log cabin and raised corn, wheat, rye, beans, sweet potatoes, and sugar cane. The Pfluger family also owned several slaves, some of whom were fluent in German.

===Community development===
The beginnings of a community did not develop until after the Civil War.

During the 1870s, a school and Lutheran church were established at the settlement. The first commercial business in the community was a general store built by Louis Bohls in 1890. Two local organizations, the German-American Mutual Assistance Foundation, to insure residents against natural disasters; and &quot;Pflugerville Schuetzen und Kegel Verein,&quot; a shooting and bowling club, were started. Pflugerville&#x27;s post office opened in 1893, with Louis Bohls serving as its first postmaster.

The population reached approximately 250 during the mid-1890s, and a small downtown developed, although most residents did their banking and shipping in Round Rock, eight miles (13Â km) to the northwest.

Wooden buildings were erected on Main Street and Pecan Street, many by Conrad Pfluger, one of Henry Pfluger Sr.&#x27;s eight sons.

In 1904, the MissouriâKansasâTexas Railroad (MKT) completed its track between Georgetown and Austin, passing just outside Pflugerville. Its close proximity to the line caused the community to grow rapidly.

On February 19, 1904, the town site of Pflugerville was platted by George Pfluger and his son, Albert, dedicating streets and alleys for the town from the Alexander Walter and C. S. Parrish Surveys in Travis County. The plat consisted of sixteen blocks, rights-of-way, and the depot grounds to the MKT. The first addition to the town was the six-block Wuthrich Addition, platted on November 22, 1904. The first cotton gin was built by Otto Pfluger in 1904. It was destroyed by fire in 1931 and a new one was built at the same location.

On June 8, 1906, the Farmers State Bank of Pflugerville opened with William Pfluger as its president and A.W. Pfluger as cashier.

The first issues of the &quot;Pflugerville Press&quot;, a weekly newspaper, began publishing on August 7, 1907 and operated through October 29, 1942.

In 1910, black workers who worked in the Pflugerville cotton industry were not allowed to move into the town. Farmer La Rue Norton, who owned of land west of Pflugerville, set aside an acre and sold lots to the workers at $50 each. County records listed the settlement as Pflugerville&#x27;s Colored Addition in April 1910.

The first German Day celebration in Pflugerville took place on May 29, 1910.

In 1913, H.S. Pfluger built the Sky Dome Theater, which showed motion pictures to the accompaniment of a player piano on Friday and Saturday nights. It closed in 1928.

In the early 1920s, Pflugerville was home to an estimated 500 residents.

During that period, several area school districts consolidated with Pflugerville High School.

===1930 to 1964===
Around 580 people lived in the community in 1930. The arrival of the Great Depression halted what had been a lengthy period of growth in Pflugerville. The population fell slightly to 500 in 1940. In the years immediately after World War II, the community lost around a quarter of its population as citizens moved to Austin and other larger cities with greater employment opportunities. Despite the challenges of population loss and limited economic development, Pflugerville managed to survive.

The community gained national attention when the Pflugerville Panthers won 55 consecutive football games from 1958 to 1962. 
===Incorporation and growth===
Efforts to incorporate Pflugerville culminated in an election on July 24, 1965. A total of 102 votes were cast, with 60 (58.8%) supporting the proposition and 42 (41.2%) opposed. The town was incorporated under a commission form of government. On April 4, 1970, an election was held that changed the form of government from commissioner to aldermanic, providing for an elected mayor and five aldermen.

Pflugerville&#x27;s population began to rebound after its incorporation, and by the 1970 census, it stood at 549. That figure had risen to 745 by 1980.

A weekly newspaper, the &quot;Pflugerville Pflag,&quot; began publication in 1980.

During most of the 1980s, new development made Pflugerville one of the fastest-growing cities in Texas. Estimates from the late 1980s were as high as 3,900. Although a statewide recession slowed the boom, Pflugerville&#x27;s population grew to 4,444 in 1990.
===1990 to 2000s===
Throughout the 1990s, the city of Austin experienced a rapid rise in its population. This was also the case in suburban areas surrounding the city. Pflugerville more than doubled in size by the next census in 2000. Since then, Pflugerville has grown by approximately 20,000, with the total number of residents approaching 40,000 as of 2008. The 2010 Census placed Pflugerville&#x27;s population at 46,936, but with annexations since the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates it to be 59,245 as of July 1, 2016. According to data from 2000, 2010, and 2017 population estimates compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau, Pflugerville has the largest percentage black population out of all suburban cities in the Austin metro.

Pflugerville elected its first Hispanic Mayor, Victor Gonzales, in 2016.

===2000 to 2023===
As of 2021, the population of Pflugerville continues to grow rapidly, reaching a total of 66,884.

==Geography==
Pflugerville is 14 miles (23Â km) northeast of downtown Austin along FM 1825 (Pecan Street) in northern Travis County. It is northeast of the Colorado River.

According to the 2010 United States Census Bureau, the city has a total land area of 22.32 square miles. It has 40.39 square miles in the extraterritorial jurisdiction. The city has one body of water, Lake Pflugerville, created in 2005 to serve as a water reservoir and recreation area, and two creeks, Gilleland Creek and Wilbarger Creek. A local school group, Wilbarger Water Watchers, in association with the LCRA, monitors the waters of Wilbarger Creek to ensure it meets the United States Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s national standard.

==Economy and transportation==
In response to a recent influx of higher sales tax revenue, the City Council lowered the property tax rate annually from 2003 to 2014. In 2015 an increase in the property tax rate was announced for the first time in more than a decade, to pay for $53 million in transportation and park bond projects approved by voters in a 2014 bond election.

While a mile-long stretch of Interstate 35 is often said by local media and residents to be in Pflugerville, the city of Austin actually controls this land, either as part of the city or through its extraterritorial jurisdiction. In November 2006, the first parts of a central Texas tollway system opened, including State Highway 130 and State Highway 45, increasing accessibility to Pflugerville. Approximately three miles of 130 run through Pflugerville, including the intersection of 45 and 130.

One such development, Stone Hill Town Center, has opened, and includes retailers, a movie theater and a St. David&#x27;s HealthCare 24-hour emergency care facility. With its close proximity to the Austin Executive Airport and SH 130, the connectivity of the area is attracting businesses and bringing jobs to Pflugerville.

Before the Stone Hill development and the nearby Pfluger Crossing (a development that includes a Walmart Supercenter) opened their first stores in 2007, the city&#x27;s two largest retailers were an Albertsons grocery store (which operated from 1996 to 2006) near Pflugerville High School and an H-E-B grocery store (operating since 2000) east of downtown.

===Pflugerville Community Development Corporation===
The Pflugerville Community Development Corporation (PCDC) has overseen economic development for the city since late 2009 as a Texas 4B Economic Development Corporation that collects a one-half cent sales tax on taxable goods purchased in the City of Pflugerville for the purpose of promoting economic development. The PCDC is a separate entity that reports to City Council.

In 2010, RRE Austin Solar broke ground on what will be one of the nation&#x27;s largest solar farms, the 60 MW Pflugerville Solar Farm, but as of July 2013 no significant construction had begun.

PCDC has helped to develop the 130 Commerce Center, at the corner of State Highway 130 and Pecan (FM 1825), an office park with FedEx, TrackingPoint, Community Impact Newspaper, and D-bats, as well as two hotels and a conference center anticipated in 2016. EOS and Medway Plastics are planned tenants.
On August 6, 2013, the city agreed on a development deal with Harvest Family Entertainment to build the sixth and largest Hawaiian Falls water park just south of the intersection of State Highway 130 and State Highway 45 across from Stone Hill Town Center. The proposed $21 million endeavor would consist of a 15-acre water park along with a 5-acre adventure park that would become the largest water park in the company. Hawaiian Falls Pflugerville opened in June 2014. The operator of Hawaiian Falls water and adventure parks defaulted on the October 2015 payment for Hawaiian Falls Pflugerville, and requested a deferment. The operator caught up with payments by December 18, 2015, but again defaulted on lease payments beginning in September 2016. The city began negotiations with Typhoon Texas to take over the water park lease.

In 2020, Amazon began construction on a distribution center in Pflugerville. The distribution center has been reported to bring 1,000 full-time jobs and be one of the largest distribution centers in the state. In partnership, the City Council signed an agreement in which Amazon agrees to invest $250M and create 1,000 fulltime jobs and the Pflugerville Community Development Corporation will use money earmarked for economic development to make additional roadway and intersection improvements along FM 1825/Pecan St to support the project.

Curative, Inc. opened a lab in Pflugerville in 2020 bringing hundreds of jobs. The company processes COVID-19 testing results.

Amenities include restrooms, playgrounds, group shelters, picnic tables with grills, concession building for rent, and a water play area.

Hawaiian Falls opened a water park and adventure park in Pflugerville on Memorial Day weekend, 2014. The water park is now known as Typhoon Texas. Typhoon Texas has celebrated more than 3 seasons in Pflugerville and recently opened a new restaurant, The Patio entertainment venue.

In 2015, the city purchased a tract of land for a community park with a new sports complex and nature areas for $4.276 million. The first phase opened of 1849 Park with soccer fields for local league play and soccer fields.

In 2023, the City announced itself as the Trail Capital of Texas and is working toward the official designation. Based on the Parks and Open Space Master Plan, the emerged theme was trails as a true amenity in the city.

==Education==

Public education in Pflugerville in the vast majority of the city is provided by the Pflugerville Independent School District (PfISD). The district encompasses all or part of six municipalities, including Pflugerville, Austin, Coupland, Hutto, Manor and Round Rock.

<text>Round Rock is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, in Williamson County (with a small part in Travis County), which is a part of the Greater Austin metropolitan area. Its population is 119,468 according to the 2020 census.

The city straddles the Balcones Escarpment, a fault line in which the areas roughly east of Interstate 35 are flat and characterized by having black, fertile soils of the Blackland Prairie, and the west side of the Escarpment, which consists mostly of hilly, karst-like terrain with little topsoil and higher elevations and which is part of the Texas Hill Country. Located about north of downtown Austin, Round Rock shares a common border with Austin near Texas State Highway 45.

In August 2008, &quot;Money&quot; named Round Rock as the seventh-best American small city in which to live. Round Rock was the only Texas city to make the Top 10. In a CNN article dated July 1, 2009, Round Rock was listed as the second-fastest-growing city in the country, with a population growth of 8.2% in the preceding year.

According to the 2008 ratings from the Texas Education Agency, the Round Rock Independent School District ranks among the best in the state. Of 42 schools within it, 12 were rated exemplary and 11 were recognized.

Round Rock is perhaps best known as the international headquarters of Dell, which employs about 16,000 people at its Round Rock facilities. The presence of Dell along with other major employers, an economic development program, major retailers such as IKEA, a Premium Outlet Mall, and the mixed-use La Frontera center, have changed Round Rock from a sleepy bedroom community into its own self-contained &quot;super suburb&quot;.

==History==

===Prehistory===

Round Rock and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9,200 BCE. The area&#x27;s earliest known inhabitants lived during the late Pleistocene (Ice Age), and are linked to the Clovis culture around 9,200 BCE based on evidence found at the much-studied Gault Site, midway between Georgetown and Fort Cavazos. One of the most important discoveries in recent times is the ancient skeletal remains dubbed &quot;the Leanderthal Lady&quot; because of its age and proximity to Leander, Texas. The site is west of Round Rock and was discovered by accident by Texas Department of Transportation workers while drilling core samples for a new highway. The site has been studied for many years and samples carbon date to this particular Pleistocene period around 10,500 years ago.

Prehistoric and Archaic period &quot;open occupation&quot; campsites are also found throughout the county along streams and other water sources, including Brushy Creek in Round Rock and the San Gabriel River in Georgetown, north. These archeology dig sites show a much greater volume United States evidence of Archaic period inhabitants based on relics and flint tools recovered from burned rock middens.
The earliest known &quot;historical&quot; Native American occupants, the Tonkawa, were a flint-working, hunting people who followed the buffalo on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to aid them in their hunts.

===Post-Archaic Native American history===

During the 18th century, the Tonkawa made the transition to a horse culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Apparently, small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye Native Americans lived in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements. After they were crowded out by white settlement, the Comanches raided settlements in the county until the 1860s. In the late 19th century, Native Americans were being pushed out of Central Texas.

As the area developed into a rural Anglo community, some of the modern paved roads followed the original Native-American pathways. One famous immigration route passed through Round Rock and is called the &quot;Double File Trail&quot; because the path was wide enough for two horsemen to ride side-by-side. It is part of a longer trail from North Texas that crossed the San Gabriel River in Georgetown, Brushy Creek in Round Rock, and the Colorado River in Austin. An elementary school in the Round Rock school district, Double File Trail Elementary School, is named for the trail.

===19th-century history===
In 1851, a small community was formed on the banks of Brushy Creek, near a large round and anvil-shaped rock in the middle of the creek. This round rock marked a convenient low-water crossing for wagons, horses, and cattle. The first postmaster called the community &quot;Brushy&quot;, and the creek was called &quot;Brushy Creek&quot;, but in 1854, at the suggestion of the postmaster, the small settlement was renamed Round Rock in honor of this now famous rock. After the Civil War, Jesse Chisholm began moving cattle from South Texas through Round Rock on the way to Abilene, Kansas. The route he established, which crossed Brushy Creek at the round rock, became known as the Chisholm Trail. Most of the old buildings, including the old Saint Charles Hotel, have been preserved. This historic area is now called &quot;Old Town&quot;.
Downtown Round Rock was the site of a historic gunfight and subsequent capture (and death) of the 19th-century American train robber Sam Bass, by the Texas Ranger Division on July 19, 1878. The Rangers followed Bass and his gang after they robbed the Fort Worth-to-Cleburne train. Bass was tracked to Round Rock, and as he attempted to flee, Bass was shot and killed in a gun battle by Ranger George Herold and Ranger Sergeant Richard Ware. Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy A.W. Grimes was killed in the shootout. Near Ware was Soapy Smith, a noted con man, and his cousin Edwin, who witnessed Ware&#x27;s shot. Soapy exclaimed, &quot;I think you got him.&quot; The event is known locally as the &quot;Sam Bass Shootout&quot;. This shootout is recreated each year at the July 4 Frontier Days Celebration in Old Settlers Park. Bass is buried in Round Rock Cemetery, northwest of &quot;Old Town&quot; on Sam Bass Road. His original headstone can be found on display at the Round Rock Public Library.

===20th-century history===

====Cotton====

In the first half of the 20th century, the county&#x27;s wealth came from the cotton fields. Cotton, row crops, grapes, and truck farming were the predominant subsistence east of Interstate 35. West of the Balcones divide, ranchers raised cattle, sheep, and to a lesser extent, goats. Due to Round Rock&#x27;s favorable geographic location over the rich, fertile &quot;blackland prairie&quot; soils also known locally as the &quot;black waxy&quot; (due to the soil&#x27;s high clay content), cotton was the largest economic driver at that time. Because of the soil and climate, this ecoregion is ideally suited to crop agriculture. Nearby Taylor, Texas, east of Round Rock, was the primary cotton center where the crop was hauled for ginning (its seeds mechanically removed) at the cotton gin, compressed into bales, and shipped by train. Austin was also a cotton center for a time once the railroad arrived there in the 1870s. Cotton production and cattle raising, on a much smaller scale, continues today, although primarily east of Round Rock.

====Chisholm Trail Crossing Park====

To preserve the heritage of the famous crossing, a Chisholm Trail Crossing Park was developed to provide visitors with a simulated scene of Round Rock&#x27;s historical role in the Chisholm cattle drive. Commemorative plaques in the park tell of the history of Round Rock. The bronze sculptures of four steers with pioneer woman Hattie Cluck and her son, Emmitt, were commissioned by the city through donations from Round Rock residents. The sculptures depict Round Rock&#x27;s history as a crossing location along the Chisholm Trail. The project plans include 18 to 20 additional bronze statues over time.

====Old Settlers Association====
Following the end of the American Civil War, a group of Confederate veterans held a reunion in Georgetown on August 27, 1904, for the old settlers of Williamson County and their descendants. The invitation promised &quot;good music, plenty to eat, and above all a warm welcome.&quot; The event was well-attended, and reunionsânow called Old Settlers Association (OSA) reunionsâhave been held annually ever since. After the initial one, the event was moved to Round Rock and eventually a structure was built (along with three restored log cabins) in the Palm Valley area of Round Rock, in front of Old Settlers Park, just off Highway 79 in east Round Rock. All members of the organization are descendants of Williamson County residents prior to 1904. OSA has about 50 active members and 300 members in all. The Old Settlers Association today is a social and educational group, with the purpose of facilitating social activities, as well as collecting and preserving important historical information and facts. The facilities are rented for meetings, arts and craft and collectable shows, events, parties, weddings and rehearsal dinners.

====Economic impact of Interstate 35====

In the 1950s, planners of the new Interstate Highway System proposed to route Interstate 35 through Taylor, whose population and cotton industry made it the county&#x27;s economic powerhouse. Highway Commissioner DeWitt Greer called for the &quot;interregional&quot; highway to go through Taylor on its way from Dallas to Austin, but some Taylor leaders and other citizens fought the idea, worried about the possibility of cutting farmers off from all or part of their fields, traffic noise, damage to country life, loss of farmland, and unwanted right-of-way acquisitionâit was proposed to be an astounding wide, unheard of before this time. No one even knew what an &quot;Interregional Highway&quot; would look like, unless they had traveled to Germany to see the Autobahn or the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut. Instead, they wanted improvements to the farm-to-market roads and a straight route to Austin.

Meanwhile, Round Rock leaders sought the highway and its potential economic benefits. Mayor Louis Henna lobbied the Highway Commission. In June 1956, the 15-year debate over the form, funding, and route of the Interstate was resolved. Due to the heavy lobbying, and not wanting to antagonize Taylor, the highway was built along the edge of the Balcones Fault line, running through Round Rock. The precise route was not without opposition, however, as the new road cut off &quot;Old Town&quot; to the west from what had become the more recent &quot;downtown&quot; area east of Interstate 35. The Interstate eventually made Round Rock into a viable and vibrant commercial center, while Taylor withered with the decline of the cotton industry. Today, it is a minor, modest town with a smaller population, while Round Rock has thrived and rapidly grown into the largest city in the county, attracting Dell Computer and major retail centers. The transformation of Round Rock is detailed in a book by Linda Scarborough (publisher of the &quot;Williamson County Sun&quot; newspaper) titled &quot;Road, River and Ol&#x27; Boy Politics: A Texas County&#x27;s Path from Farm to Supersuburb&quot; published by Texas State Historical Press.

====Life as a suburb community====

By the 1990s, Round Rock was primarily a suburb, with the majority of its employed residents working in Austin and then returning home after work to places such as Round Rock and Georgetown, where housing and land were less expensive. In the 1990s, Round Rock had few major employers and jobs other than local retail and other services, or ranching and farming. In the late 1990s, though, that began to change as economic development became a major focus of the city and the Chamber of Commerce. Dell Corporation moved its headquarters to Round Rock, which has provided a significant number of jobs with 16,000 employees at its Round Rock headquarters.&quot;(See also the Business and economic development section in this article.)&quot;

==Geography==

Round Rock is north of downtown Austin, and south of Georgetown. Its elevation is . According to the US Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which are land and (0.50%) is covered by water. Prior to the 2010 census, the city annexed part of the Brushy Creek CDP, increasing its area to , of which of it is land and is water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by generally hot, humid summers and mild, cool winters. According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification, Round Rock has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

The city was heavily damaged by a high-end EF2 tornado on March 21, 2022. The tornado continued well northeast of the city afterwards, causing additional damage before dissipating. Sixteen people were injured.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 119,468 people, 41,896 households, and 29,962 families residing in the city. The 42,580 housing units had 32,338 owner-occupied homes with a median value of $172,500. Of the 41,896 households, 29.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.5% were married couples living together, 11.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.4% were not families.

Round Rock, with a population of more than 130,000, is located 15 miles north of Austin in the Central Texas Hill Country. It is the 28th most populous city in Texas, according to Texas Demographic Center.

==Economy==


The City of Round Rock has maintained a high quality of life while becoming a major center for economic growth in Central Texas, with industry clusters in clean energy, advanced manufacturing, life sciences, and computer/software development.

Round Rock has more than 20 major employers including: Cerilliant Corporation, Cintas, Dell, Dresser, Emerson Process Management, Hospira, IKEA, KoMiCo Technology Inc., Round Rock Premium Outlets, Prudential Overall Supply, Sears Customer Care, Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corp, Tekscend Photomask, and TECO-Westinghouse.

===Dell corporate headquarters===
Dell, a multinational computer and information technology corporation based in Round Rock, develops, sells and supports computers and related products and services. The company employs about 11,500 people in the Round Rock facilities, and as of 2017, about 138,000 people worldwide. Dell was originally based in Austin after its formation in 1984 as &quot;PC&#x27;s Limited&quot; by UT college student Michael Dell. With the need for significant space as it expanded, the City of Round Rock in 1996 offered Dell a &quot;Chapter 380&quot; agreement by offering to split sales tax revenue from in-state sales 50/50 between Dell and the city. (A &quot;Chapter 380&quot; agreement is named for the chapter in Vernon&#x27;s Statues that permits sales tax revenue sharing for economic development purposes.) It was the first time such an agreement had been used in Central Texas and among the first in the state. As of 1999, approximately half of the general fund of the City of Round Rock originates from sales taxes generated from the Dell headquarters. Today, the company is one of the largest technology companies in the world, listed as number 38 on the &quot;Fortune 500&quot; (2010). &quot;Fortune&quot; also lists Dell as the #5 most admired company in its industry.
As part of its clean energy program in 2008, Dell switched the power sources of the Round Rock headquarters to more environmentally friendly ones, with 60% of the power coming from TXU Energy wind farms and 40% coming from the Austin Community Landfill gas-to-energy plant operated by Waste Management, Inc.

===Commercial and retail===
Round Rock&#x27;s largest commercial and office business center is La Frontera, at the intersection of Loop 1, SH 45, and IH-35. La Frontera combines multi-tenant offices, company headquarters facilities, of retail, and several apartment complexes and other smaller retail and housing centers. The project also includes Williamson County&#x27;s largest hotel, the Austin North Marriott, which provides space for large conferences, meetings, and banquets â a first for the county and an important component of Round Rock&#x27;s economic efforts. The center is also home to the Texas Guaranteed Student Loan Corporation, and Emerson Process Management. The retail portion is the second-largest outdoor commercial project in the Austin-Round Rock metro area. La Frontera was developed by Bill Smalling and Don Martin, with Fort Worth financier Ed Bass as financial partner.

In 2006, a retail-only hub opened in Round Rock at the corner of IH-35 and Highway 1431 (now renamed &quot;University Boulevard&quot;), across the street from IKEA. The major-retailer center includes the Simon Property Group&#x27;s Premium Outlets Mall, as well as numerous other retail stores and restaurants. The project was developed by Simon Property Group, with other portions by Barshop and Oles of Austin.

==Sports==
Round Rock is home to the Round Rock Express, a Triple-A Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League, owned by RSR Sports (Nolan Ryan, Don Sanders, Reid Ryan) and was founded by Reid Ryan, son of Baseball Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan. As of August 2010, Nolan Ryan is also the new owner of the major league Texas Rangers ball club. Home games for the Express are played at the Dell Diamond, a facility that is owned by the City of Round Rock and leased long-term to RSR Sports, which runs and maintains the facility.

Round Rock opened a free public skate park in 2007 behind the Clay Madsen Recreation Center on Gattis School Road.

Round Rock is the self-proclaimed &quot;Sports Capital of Texas&quot;. The city&#x27;s Old Settlers Park offers a professionally designed disc golf course, cricket, cross country running, twenty-field baseball complex, five-field softball complex, and seven soccer facilities in addition to the Rockin&#x27; River Family Aquatic Center.

The 11th annual US Quidditch Cup championship quidditch tournament was hosted in Round Rock in April 2018.

==Government==
===City government===
The city of Round Rock is managed through a council-manager form of government. The city council is composed of six city council members and the mayor. The mayor and all council members are elected at large and serve the entire city, not by geographic precincts. The mayor &quot;pro tem&quot; is appointed annually by council members. City Council positions are not full-time jobs. The council appoints a full-time city manager, who manages the daily affairs of the city, and all council meetings are held at 221 E. Main Street, in downtown Round Rock, on the second and fourth Thursdays of each month at 7 pm, unless indicated otherwise. Council meetings are televised.

===County government===
The Commissioners Court is the overall governing and management body of Williamson County, consisting of five members. The county judge presides as chairman over the court, and is elected every four years by all voters in the county. Four commissioners are elected by single-member precincts every four years. While the majority of Round Rock is within Precinct 1, all four precincts include some portions of the city. 

===State and national representation===

* Texas House of Representatives: State Representative District 52: Caroline Harris (R)
* Texas Senate District 5: Charles Schwertner (R)
* US Congress â Congressman John R. Carter (R), Congressional District 31
* US Congress â Congressman Michael McCaul (R), Congressional District 10

===Other political subdivisions===
Municipal utility districts, commonly referred to as &quot;MUDs&quot;, play a significant role in Round Rock. Each is a special-purpose district that provides public utilities such as water, wastewater, storm water, and sometimes roads, parks, solid waste, and other infrastructure and services to the residents of each district. MUDs are typically formed by a residential developer as a means to install utilities and roads to a project when a city is not ready or able to provide them. The developer gets reimbursed over time from the fees levied by the MUD, and at some point the area may be annexed by the city to bring the development into the city&#x27;s tax base once the basic infrastructure costs are paid off. The MUD is represented by its own board of directors, who are voted on by the residents of the district, and it has the authority to condemn land, add additional land area, and levy fees in lieu of property taxes to maintain the utilities and other facilities.

Ten MUDs are in Round Rock: Brushy Creek, Fern Bluff, Highlands at Mayfield Ranch, Meadows at Chandler Creek, Paloma Lake, Parkside at Mayfield Ranch, Siena, Teravista, Vista Oaks, and Walsh Ranch. Total population living within these MUDs is 47,648 (2010 city estimate).

Round Rock&#x27;s largest district is Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District. Brushy Creek MUD was formed as Williamson County Municipal Utility District No. 2 in October 1977 with of land. An annexation in 1983 increased the District to . The district name was changed to Brushy Creek Municipal Utility District in August 1990. The MUD provides a wide range of city-like services including parks and recreation, full utilities, road maintenance and a Home Owner&#x27;s Association. Services a MUD can offer, however are also limited by law (for example they cannot offer library services).

Another similar but somewhat smaller MUD in Round Rock&#x27;s is Fern Bluff Municipal Utility District in the Wyoming Springs area of town. Both MUDs play a significant role in local governance and maintenance of basic utilities.

From time to time, elections to the boards were contentious and heated debates arose regarding other MUD issues. Round Rock does not often annex a MUD to avoiding having to take on the aging infrastructure replacement and upkeep costs.

==Education==

===Public education===
Round Rock Independent School District, a Texas Education Agency recognized school district, is in southern Williamson County and northwest Travis County, and includes all the City of Round Rock and portions of the cities of Austin and Cedar Park.
The area covers encompassing high-tech manufacturing and urban retail centers, suburban neighborhoods, and farm and ranch land. Roughly 45,00 students attend the district&#x27;s five high schools, ten middle schools, 32 elementary schools, and two alternative learning centers. 

In August 2010, the district opened its fifth high school (Cedar Ridge High School), a ninth-grade center reverted to a middle school, and the district&#x27;s 31st elementary school opened in the Stone Oak subdivision. &quot;The average student-teacher ratio for the district is 16. The annual dropout rate for students in grades 7â12 is 1.1%, and more than 77% of the district&#x27;s graduating seniors take the SAT and ACT college entrance exams, scoring well above state and national averages.&quot; The property tax rates are significantly higher than the national average, and the schools&#x27; performance reflects the tax dollars invested.

*Students: 44,781 (as of fall 2010)
*Languages spoken: 77
*Average SAT score: 1628 (the state average is 1462 and the national average is 1509)
*Average ACT score: 24.1 (the state average is 20.8 and the national average is 21.0)
In the annual report released July 30, 2010, the Round Rock Independent School District received the highest possible rating (&quot;Exemplary&quot;) for 25 of its schools, the highest number so rated in any of the suburban districts in Central Texas. These schools are: Westwood High School. Canyon Vista, Walsh, and Cedar Valley middle schools. Spicewood, Forest North, Caraway, Brushy Creek, Laurel Mountain, Fern Bluff, Canyon Creek, Great Oaks, Teravista, Cactus Ranch, Sommer, Deep Wood, Robertson, Pond Springs, Live Oak, Old Town, Jollyville, Forest Creek, Blackland Prairie, Union Hill and Gattis elementary schools. In 2010, the school district as a whole was rated &quot;academically recognized&quot;, a significant step above 2009 when the school district was rated &quot;academically acceptable&quot; by the Texas Education Agency.

Round Rock is partially served by Leander Independent School District &amp; Pflugerville Independent School District

===Higher education===
Round Rock also has a number of higher education opportunities. In 1990, the city, under the leadership of then-City Manager Bob Bennett, planning director Joe Vining, and local citizen Mike Swayze envisioned and oversaw creation of the Texas State University Round Rock Campus (or Round Rock Higher Education Center). The concept was envisioned as a way to lure colleges and universities to jointly provide education, training, and degree opportunities on part-time and full-time bases. The center used various empty facilities around town, and many of the initial training programs were targeted to help educate students for work at local companies, such as Dell, which had specialized needs. In 2008, an educational campus and the first RRC buildingâthe Avery Buildingâwas opened through the combined efforts of Texas State University, Austin Community College, and Temple College in order to provide a broader range of educational opportunities, specialized training, and varying degree programs including post graduate degrees. The campus is in the heart of the emerging Avery Center development which houses Seton Williamson, the A&amp;M Health Science Center and other medical campuses. By the end of 2009 1,700 students were enrolled in the programs. Texas State University has taken on the lead role in this effort and of land for the facility and additional buildings were donated by the Avery family of Round Rock, whose family members were early settlers on the land surrounding the center. Construction on the second Texas State campus building is underway and construction is nearly complete on this additional classroom building. &quot;(See also Texas State University Round Rock Campus)&quot;

The city is also home to the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center Round Rock, which opened its doors in December 2010. The campus is designed to eventually accommodate as many as 17 additional buildings over time as money is appropriated each biennium by the Texas Legislature.

In August 2010, Austin Community College&#x27;s largest campus to date opened adjacent to the Texas State University center. ACC is constructing five additional buildings with a total of to accommodate up to 5,000 students in its first phase. All three campuses are adjacent to each other within the burgeoning Avery Farms development.

The newest component of higher education is the School of Nursing at Texas State University, housed within the university&#x27;s College of Health Professions. Other programs offered by the college are health information management, health services research, and physical therapy.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Major highways====
* Interstate 35
* U.S. Highway 79 (the southern terminus is here)
* State Highway 45
* State Highway 45 Toll Rd
* State Highway 130 Toll Rd

====Toll roads====

In November 2006, the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority (CTRMA) opened the first segment of the region&#x27;s first toll road system. Both State Highway 130 and State Highway 45 toll roads run through portions of Round Rock and provide greatly increased mobility to the city, albeit with strong regional opposition to the high-toll charges to motorists. State Highway 130 runs just south of Austin Bergstrom International Airport at US Highway 183 and connecting to Interstate 35 north of Georgetown, and passes through the easternmost portion of Round Rock. It provides Round Rock residents with quick access to the Austin airport for about $6 each way. The project, when completed, will end at Interstate 10 just east of Seguin, about east-northeast of San Antonio essentially creating a parallel roadway to Interstate 35.

State Highway 45 is part of an eventual loop that runs east from State Highway 183 in Cedar Park to 130 at Pflugerville (east of Round Rock) where it merges with the SH 130 toll road, and then intersects with the southern portion of SH 45 near Buda, south of Austin. SH 45 passes through the entire southern portion of Round Rock. Highway 45 provides much faster access between Round Rock and Austin, alleviating what was previously a major bottleneck at Interstate 35. The project includes a tolled extension to Loop 1 (also known locally as the &quot;Mopac Expressway&quot;) and allows direct access from to I-35 to Loop 1 by use of flyover connections rather than ground level intersections. The toll roads also provide access to the Dell headquarters and its considerable number of employees. Together, both toll roads significantly improve mobility in Round Rock.

===Health care===

Round Rock has a wide array of hospitals and extensive health care services. Many of these facilities serve not only Round Rock, but the greater Williamson county area, as well as North Austin.

* Saint David&#x27;s Round Rock Medical Center was the first major hospital in Round Rock, opening its doors as Round Rock Hospital in 1984. It is a for-profit hospital with a Level II Trauma center as part of the extensive St. David&#x27;s system.
* Scott &amp; White Healthcare in Temple opened a satellite hospital in Round Rock in 2007. It is on University Boulevard. The facility has full hospital services, but also transfers some patients to its primary Temple campus. Scott &amp; White is a non-profit collaborative health care system based in Temple. Scott &amp; White Healthcare - Round Rock serves residents of Williamson and North Travis counties, including the Austin/Round Rock metropolitan area. Facilities include Scott &amp; White Hospital; Round Rock, Scott &amp; White Hospital; Taylor and 15 additional primary care and specialty clinic locations in: Burnet, Cedar Park, Georgetown, Hutto, Leander, Pflugerville, Round Rock and Taylor.

* Ascension Seton Williamson, formerly Seton Medical Center Williamson, is the newest hospital in Round Rock, opening in 2009 on University Boulevard. A level II trauma center, it is next to the Texas State University campus, the new Austin Community College (ACC) campus that opened in fall 2010, and the Round Rock campus of the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center. The facility is building out its planned expansion space ahead of schedule. It is part of the Seton Healthcare Family that is affiliated with the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and Ascension Health.
* Another entrant into the health-care field in Round Rock, opened in December 2009, is the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center. The building is the first of up to seventeen buildings expected to be built in coming years. The facility also houses administrative offices, classrooms and a Lone Star Circle of Care clinic, where health care students will train.
* In 2010, the latest component of higher education is the School of Nursing at Texas State University, housed within the university&#x27;s College of Health Professions. Other programs offered by the college are health information management, health services research, and physical therapy.
* Lone Star Circle of Care (LSCC) is a grant-funded organization dedicated to serving the health needs of the uninsured and underinsured in Williamson County and nearby areas. They have grown from one clinic in Georgetown in January 2001 to today having eighteen community clinics serving Central Texas. They provided 130,000 patient visits for medically underserved adults and children in 2009. Grants come from the Scott &amp; White Foundation, Seton Foundation, the Michael &amp; Susan Dell Foundation, Georgetown Health Foundation, St. David&#x27;s Foundation, and many others. In May 2010 the Seton family of hospitals awarded LSCC a $3 million grant for pediatric care. And the new A&amp;M Health Science Center is partnering with the Lone Star Circle of Care for a clinical hub which opened in A&amp;M&#x27;s existing building in December 2009.

==Filming locations==

*The 1974 horror movie cult classic &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; was filmed at various Central Texas locations with a majority of shooting at two houses across the road from each other on an old stretch of County Road 172 later diverted in the middle 1980s on what is known as Quick Hillânow the site of the La Frontera commercial development in Round Rock. The movie is based on the real-life crimes of Ed Gein, who killed multiple people, mutilated their bodies and used parts of them to make things such as lamp shades in Wisconsin in the 1950s.
Tours of local sites are still conducted by avid film buffs. In the early 1980s, the movie&#x27;s dilapidated two-story house â abandoned long before the movie&#x27;s filming and across the road from the movie&#x27;s main Texas Chainsaw House built in 1910 and occupied before and after filming â was torched by local area high school students leaving a charred limestone skeleton of the mostly wooden frame. In 1998, the Texas Chainsaw House was disassembled and moved to Kingsland, Texas, where it was reassembled and fully restored and operates as a restaurant at The Antlers Hotel.
*Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, &quot;Blood Simple&quot; is a 1984 American neo-noir crime film. It was the directorial debut of the Coen brothers, and the first major film of cinematographer Barry Sonnenfeld. The film&#x27;s title derives from the Dashiell Hammett novel &quot;Red Harvest&quot;, in which &quot;blood simple&quot; is a term coined to describe the addled, fearful mindset people are in after a prolonged immersion in violent situations. &quot;Blood Simple&quot; was re-released theatrically in 2000 and on DVD in 2001 in a &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot;.
*A majority of the 2002 Disney film &quot;The Rookie&quot;, starring Dennis Quaid and Rachel Griffiths, was shot at and around the minor-league baseball stadium in Round Rock known as Dell Diamond. It is inspired by the true story of Jim Morris who had a brief but famous Major League Baseball career.
*&quot;The Simple Life&quot;: (TV Season 2, episode 15). &quot;The Simple Life&quot; is a reality television series that was broadcast from December 2, 2003, to August 5, 2007. The first three seasons aired on Fox, and the final two on E!. The comedic show depicts two wealthy young socialites (Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie) as they struggle to do manual, low-paying jobs such as cleaning rooms, doing farm work, serving meals in fast-food restaurants and working as camp counselors. Season 2, Episode 15 took place during a Round Rock Express baseball game.
*Written and co-produced by Elgin native Jake Helgren, the movie &quot;A Dogwalker&#x27;s Christmas Tale&quot; (2015) had many scenes shot in and around Round Rock. These included downtown Round Rock around the public library and at Star Coffee Company, the Round Rock Dog Depot, and some sidewalk scenes in Mayfield Ranch subdivision.

<text>Monahans is a city in Ward and Winkler counties in Texas, United States, that is the county seat of Ward County. A very small portion of the city extends into Winkler County. The population was 6,953 at the 2010 census. In 2020, the population was estimated at 7,836.

==History==

The Permian Basin, home to Monahans and Midland-Odessa combined statistical area, is wide and long; Monahans is &quot;The Center of the Permian Basin&quot;. The basin was formed during the Permian period, the final portion of the Paleozoic era. At the time, it was an ocean filled with abundant aquatic life.

In 1583, Spanish explorer Antonio de Espejo crossed this area on his way through present-day New Mexico. The Indians in the Monahans region were called &quot;vaqueros&quot; by these Spanish explorers because they hunted the &quot;hump-backed cattle&quot; or bison. Records of Spanish exploring the &quot;Los Medanos&quot; (the sand dunes) outside Monahans can be traced to the early 1770s.

Located in a region where native Comanches, Mescalero, and Lipan Apache Indians once roamed, Monahans&#x27; history as a community extends back to the late 1880s with the expansion of the Texas and Pacific Railway across the South Plains. For the few people living in West Texas, the building of a transcontinental railroad through the area meant the arrival of civilization. In the summer of 1881, Texas and Pacific Railroad contracted with surveyor John Thomas Monahan, who discovered that the lack of water for the laying crew and their animals would slow down construction of the rail. Monahan&#x27;s digging of a water well produced an abundance of good water ( a day) and was instrumental in the success of the city. Prior to this solution, water had to be hauled to the area from Big Spring, Texas.

The availability of cheap land encouraged settlers to form a small community on the track known as Monahans Well. When oil was discovered in the area in 1926, though, the community changed directions. Oil discovery brought people of many occupations and of varied interests to Monahans. The local economy began to change from an agricultural to an industrial economy.

In June 1994, a temperature of 120Â Â°F was recorded in Monahans, a still-standing record-holder for highest-ever Texan temperature.

<text>Green River is a city in Emery County, Utah, United States. The population was 847 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The city of Green River is located on ancestral Ute lands, in the home locale of the Seuvarits/Sheberetch band of Ute people. The Old Spanish Trail trade route passed across the Green River in the area of modern Green River from 1829 into the 1850s.

John Wesley Powell embarked on the first of two voyages down the Green River from Green River, Wyoming, more than 200 miles to the north of Green River, Utah, in May 1869 and floated the river to its confluence with the Colorado and beyond. Powell left a detailed account of the river and the surrounding landscape and prepared the first thorough maps of the river basin. Powell left his mark in other ways as well. He and his men named most of the canyons, geographic features, and rapids along the Green River during his two voyages in 1869 and 1871. Powell also paved the way for later generations of explorers and scientists interested in the unique geology of the basin of the Green River.

The settlement of the Green River started as a river crossing for the U.S. mail. In 1876, Mr. Blake set up a ferry and way station on the east side of the river. It became a stopover for travelers with a ferry transporting people, supplies, and animals across the river. Today, the river is primarily used for recreational and education rafting, canoeing, and kayaking trips. The &quot;Gates of Lodore&quot; portion is most common for recreational trips, as it can be completed in 3-6 days.

The line commonly known as the Utah Division of the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad was built in 1883, and a train station was opened. The west side of the river became known as &quot;Greenriver&quot; (later changed to &quot;Green River&quot;), and the east side of the river became known as &quot;Elgin&quot;, and is still sometimes referred to by that name today. With the railroad coming, the town quickly went from a small farm hamlet to a boom town, with workers coming to build the bridge and the roadbed for the railroad. After the railroad&#x27;s completion, the Green River became a fueling and watering stop for the railroad, with switching yards and engine sheds. A hotel called the Palmer House was built and became the scheduled meal stop for trains from both directions for many years. Green River enjoyed the railroad boom until 1892, when the railroad transferred most of its operations to Helper. The population of the town declined significantly.

Throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the mining of uranium played a significant role in the economy of Green River. Several trucking companies hauled ore from mines in the Four-Corners Mining District west of Green River, the San Rafael Swell, the Henry Mountains, and the area that is now Lake Powell.

The U.S. Air Force built the Green River Launch Complex outside Green River in 1964. It was an annex of the U.S. Army&#x27;s White Sands Missile Range. From 1964 to 1973, the Air Force launched 141 Athena missiles from the Green River complex, near the Crystal Geyser, as part of research to improve nuclear missiles.

==Geography==

The city is located on the banks of the Green River, a major tributary of the Colorado River. The San Rafael Swell region is located west of the city, while Canyonlands National Park lies to the south. Today located exclusively in Emery County, the city was split between Emery and Grand counties until January 6, 2003, when Emery County&#x27;s boundaries were expanded to follow the city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Green River has a land area of , and a water area .

Interstate 70 passes just south of the city, with access from Exits 160 and 164. Grand Junction, Colorado and Denver lie to the east. Cove Fort, I-70&#x27;s western terminus, is to the west with Las Vegas via Interstate 15 from Cove Fort. Price lies to the northwest on US Routes 6 and 191 as well as Salt Lake City via Interstate 15 from Spanish Fork.

===Climate===

Green River has a moderate desert climate (KÃ¶ppen &quot;BWk&quot;).

The median income for a household in the city was $42,361. About 21.1% of the population were below the poverty line.

==Economy==
Located approximately from both Richfield, Utah, and Grand Junction, Colorado, Green River&#x27;s local economy primarily caters to serving passers-by on Interstate 70, since there are no services on I-70 westbound between Green River and Salina, away. The economy relies heavily on hotels, fast food, and a few other restaurants and gas stations. A large natural gas field has been discovered south of the city. The field is operated by Delta Petroleum, headquartered in Denver, Colorado.

Green River is famous for its melons, sold during the growing season, and has an annual Melon Days Festival. It is also a popular freeride mountain biking spot.

A proposed nuclear power plant, the Blue Castle Project, is located approximately five miles west-northwest of the town.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Green River station, operating its &quot;California Zephyr&quot; daily in both directions between Chicago and Emeryville, California.

Interstate 70, along with U.S. 6, U.S. 191, and U.S. 50, also passes through Green River, the first eastbound services after Salina and the final westbound services, because the two cities are apart, the longest stretch of the interstate with no services in the United States.

The Main road in Green River is a short State road, SR 19, with Business I-70.

<text>Draper is a city in Salt Lake and Utah counties in the U.S. state of Utah, about south of Salt Lake City along the Wasatch Front. As of the 2020 census, the population is 51,017, up from 7,143 in 1990.

Draper is part of two metropolitan areas; the Salt Lake County portion is in the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, while the Utah County portion is in the Provo-Orem metropolitan area.

Draper has two UTA TRAX stations (Draper Town Center, 12300/12400 South and Kimball&#x27;s Lane 11800 South) as well as one on the border with Sandy (Crescent View 11400 South). A FrontRunner commuter rail station serves the city&#x27;s west side. The city has around 5 FLEX bus routes connecting neighboring communities and two bus routes to Lehi Frontrunner Station and River/Herriman, connecting at Draper Town Center and the Draper Frontrunner Stations.

The Utah State Prison was located in Draper from 1951 to 2022, near Point of the Mountain, alongside Interstate 15. State politicians voted to condemn the facility, and prisoners were moved to the Utah State Correctional Facility.

The city is home of 1-800 Contacts and a large eBay campus.

==History==
In the fall of 1849, Ebenezer Brown brought cattle to graze along the mountain stream of South Willow Creek. The next spring, Ebenezer moved with his wife Phebe (&quot;Phebe Draper Palmer Brown&quot;) and their family to settle in Sivogah, the Native American name for the area, which means &quot;Willows.&quot; By the end of 1850, residents of the small settlement consisted of Ebenezer Brown and his three children (by a prior marriage), Phebe Draper Palmer Brown and her two children (by a prior marriage), and Phebe&#x27;s brother, William Draper Jr. and his large family numbering about fifteen. Consequently, by the end of the settlement&#x27;s first year, most residents were members of the Draper Family, and William Draper Jr. was soon called to be the presiding elder for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the area. During this time, the Drapers mainly farmed, and Ebenezer Brown ranched and sold cattle to immigrants heading to the gold fields of California along what became the Mormon Road. More settlers moved to Draper in the next few years. Later the area was called South Willow Creek. By 1852, 20 families lived along the creek. In 1854, the first post office was established with the name Draperville in recognition of William Draper Jr. and its other Draper residents. The town&#x27;s name in later years was shortened to Draper. (William Draper Sr., father of both William and Phebe Draper, who was older at the time of his family&#x27;s settlement of Draper is buried in the town cemetery.)

Hostilities with the Native Americans began in 1854, and a fort was established where the local settlers lived during the winters of 1855 and 1856. The fort was never completed, as the feared hostilities did not materialize, and its former location is now the site of the Draper Historical Park and the aptly-named Fort Street.

In the 1940s, Draper was known as the &quot;Egg Basket of Utah.&quot; Eggs produced in Draper were marketed from coast to coast, and the co-op furnished eggs for the military troops in the South Pacific during WWII. The poultry business was the single most important economic industry in Draper during this time. One large poultry farm was the Washburn Poultry Farm, run by Bruce D. Washburn, with over 10,000 chickens during the 1950s.

Draper remained a small farming community until the late 1990s when its population began growing exponentially from 7,257 in 1990 to an estimated 47,710 in 2018.

Draper was incorporated as a city in 1978.

==Geography==

Draper City is nestled in the far southeast corner of the Salt Lake Valley, with the Wasatch Mountain Range on the east and the Traverse Ridge Mountain on the south. At the Point of the Mountain, Draper is known for being one of the most popular and best wind areas in the country for hang gliding and paragliding.

Draper lies roughly midway between Salt Lake City and Provo. Draper is bordered by Riverton and Bluffdale to the west, South Jordan to the northwest, Sandy to the north, Alpine to the southeast, Highland to the south, and Lehi to the southwest.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.05%, is water.

===Climate===

Draper&#x27;s climate is roughly identical to other Salt Lake City suburbs. However, due to being further away from the Great Salt Lake, varied elevation, and from the downtown urban heat island effect, Draper experiences a slightly drier winter and more extremes in temperatures.

The average temperatures in winter and summer, respectively, are 30Â Â°F to 50Â Â°F, and 80Â Â°F to 100Â Â°F. Springs are usually mild and wet, while fall can sometimes become an Indian summer with drier weather. Monsoonal moisture from the south usually brings afternoon thunderstorms in July and August. Draper falls on the border of the humid continental/subtropical climatic zones and is technically a cool/warm semi-arid desert environment, but with summer monsoonal moisture. Snow usually falls regularly from November through March.

<doc id="151250" wikidata="Q316115" url="?curid=151250" title="Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n">
<text>Alfonso IX (15 August 117123 or 24 September 1230) was King of LeÃ³n from the death of his father Ferdinand II in 1188 until his own death.

He took steps towards modernizing and democratizing his dominion and founded the University of Salamanca in 1218. In 1188 he summoned the first parliament reflecting the fullest representation of the citizenry ever seen in Western Europe, the Cortes of LeÃ³n.

Alfonso took part in the Reconquista, conquering several territories within Extremadura, capturing MÃ©rida and Badajoz in 1230, which allowed for the eventual conquest of Seville during the reign of his son Ferdinand III. He was also involved in numerous conflicts with Pope Celestine III, being interdicted on account of the nature of his marriages.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Alfonso was born in Zamora. He was the only son of King Ferdinand II of LeÃ³n and Urraca of Portugal. His father was the younger son of Alfonso VII of LeÃ³n and Castile, who divided his kingdoms between his sons, which set the stage for conflict in the family until the kingdoms were re-united by Alfonso IX&#x27;s son Ferdinand III of Castile.

Alfonso IX had great difficulty in obtaining the throne through his given birthright. In July 1188 his cousin Alfonso VIII of Castile required the younger Alfonso to recognize the elder as overlord in exchange for recognizing the younger&#x27;s authority in LeÃ³n.

=== Reign ===
The convening of the Cortes de LeÃ³n in the cloisters of the Basilica of San Isidoro would be one of the most important events of Alfonso&#x27;s reign. The difficult economic situation at the beginning of his reign compelled Alfonso to raise taxes on the underprivileged classes, leading to protests and a few town revolts. In response, the king summoned the Cortes, an assembly of nobles, clergy and representatives of cities, and subsequently faced demands for compensatory spending and greater external control and oversight of royal expenditures. Alfonso&#x27;s convening of the Cortes is considered by many historians, including John Keane, to be instrumental to the formation of democratic parliaments across Europe. Note that Iceland had already held what may have been what is Europe&#x27;s first parliament, the Ãingvellir, in 930. However, the Cortes&#x27; 1188 session predates the first session of the Parliament of England, which occurred in the thirteenth century.

In spite of the democratic precedent represented by the Cortes and the founding of the University of Salamanca, Alfonso is often chiefly remembered for the difficulties his successive marriages caused between him with Pope Celestine III. He was first married in 1191 to his first cousin, Theresa of Portugal, who bore him two daughters, and a son who died young. The marriage was declared null by the papal legate Cardinal Gregory for consanguinity.

After Alfonso VIII of Castile was defeated at the Battle of Alarcos, Alfonso IX invaded Castile with the aid of Muslim troops. He was summarily excommunicated by Pope Celestine III. In 1197, Alfonso IX married his first cousin once removed, Berengaria of Castile, to cement peace between LeÃ³n and Castile. For this second act of consanguinity, the king and the kingdom were placed under interdict by representatives of the pope. In 1198, Pope Innocent III declared Alfonso and Berengaria&#x27;s marriage invalid, but they stayed together until 1204. The annulment of this marriage by the pope drove the younger Alfonso to again attack his cousin in 1204, but treaties made in 1205, 1207, and 1209 each forced him to concede further territories and rights. The treaty in 1207 is the first existing public document in the Castilian dialect.

The Pope was, however, compelled to modify his measures by the threat that, if the people could not obtain the services of religion, they would not support the clergy, and that heresy would spread. The king was left under interdict personally, but to that he showed himself indifferent, and he had the support of his clergy.

In 1211 Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n and Galicia gave the castle of AlcaÃ±ices to the Templar Order, where inhabitants celebrated the great victories of the order.
=== Death ===
Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n and Galicia died on 24 September 1230. His death was particularly significant in that his son, Ferdinand III of Castile, who was already the King of Castile, also inherited the thrones of LeÃ³n and Galicia from his father. This was thanks to the negotiations of his mother, Berengaria, who convinced her stepdaughters to renounce their claim on the throne. In an effort to consolidate his power over LeÃ³n quickly, Ferdinand III abandoned a military campaign to capture the city of JaÃ©n immediately upon hearing news of his father&#x27;s death and traveled to LeÃ³n to be crowned king. This coronation united the Kingdoms of LeÃ³n and Castile which would go on to dominate the Iberian Peninsula.

== Marriages and issue ==
Alfonso IX married twice, both times to near relatives, and remarkably, both of his marriages were annulled for consanguinity. Apart from the eight children born of these two marriages, Alfonso also fathered numerous progeny with women of lower rank.

=== Marriages and legitimate issue ===
In 1191, Alfonso married his first cousin Theresa of Portugal, who was his mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s daughter. Theresa was the daughter of King Sancho I of Portugal and Queen Dulce of Aragon. The marriage was annulled five years later, on grounds of consanguinity but three children had been born by then, being:
* Sancha (1191before 1243) unmarried and without issue. She and her sister Dulce became nuns or retired to the monastery of San Guillermo Villabuena in LeÃ³n, where she died before 1243.
* Ferdinand (1192/11931214), unmarried and without issue.
* Dulce (1193/11941248).

On 17 November 1197, Alfonso IX married his first cousin once removed, the &quot;infanta&quot; Berengaria of Castile. Berengeria was the daughter of King Alfonso VIII of Castile and his wife Queen Leonor of England. Her paternal grandfather, Sancho III of Castile, had been a brother of Alfonso&#x27;s own father Ferdinand II of LeÃ³n. Thus, both Alfonso IX and Berengaria belonged to the same dynasty or family. The marriage was annulled on grounds of consanguinity, but not before five children had been born, namely:
* Eleanor (119811 November 1202).
* Constance (died in 1242), became a nun at the Abbey of Santa MarÃ­a la Real de Las Huelgas, Burgos, where she died.
* Ferdinand III of Castile (1199/12011252). King of Castile in 1217 after the death of Henry I of Castile and of LeÃ³n in 1230 after the death of his father.
* Alfonso (died in 1272), Lord of Molina &quot;jure uxoris&quot; due to his first marriage to Mafalda GonzÃ¡lez de Lara.
* Berengaria of LeÃ³n (died in 1237), in 1224 married John of Brienne,

=== Affairs and illegitimate issue ===
Alfonso also fathered many illegitimate children. After the annulment of his first marriage and before marrying for the second time, he had a relationship which lasted about two years with InÃ©s ÃÃ±iguez de Mendoza, daughter of IÃ±igo LÃ³pez de Mendoza and MarÃ­a GarcÃ­a. This affair produced a daughter born around 1197:
* Urraca Alfonso, the wife of Lope DÃ­az II de Haro, Lord of Biscay.

Alfonso had another relationship afterwards with a noblewoman from Galicia, EstefanÃ­a PÃ©rez de Faiam. She was the daughter of Pedro MenÃ©ndez Faiam, who confirmed several royal charters of King Alfonso IX, and the granddaughter of Menendo Faiam, who also confirmed several diplomas issued in Galicia as of 1155 by King Ferdinand II of LeÃ³n. In 1211, Alfonso gave her lands in Orense where her family, as can be inferred from her last will dated 1250, owned many estates, as well as in the north of Portugal. After the relationship ended, EstefanÃ­a married Rodrigo SuÃ¡rez with whom she had further issue. In her will, she asked to be buried in the Monastery of FiÃ£es in northern Portugal. Alfonso IX and EstefanÃ­a were the parents of possibly two sons, but definitely of one, being:
* Ferdinand Alfonso of LeÃ³n (born in 1211), died young.

According to Spanish historian Julio GonzÃ¡lez, after his relationship with EstefanÃ­a, the king had a lover from Salamanca, of unknown origin, whose name was Maura and with whom he had issue:
* Fernando Alfonso de LeÃ³n (/1218Salamanca, 10 January 1278), archdeacon of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, who had issue with Aldara de Ulloa.

Alfonso also had a relationship with a noblewoman from Portugal, Aldonza MartÃ­nez de Silva, daughter of Martim Gomes da Silva and his wife Urraca Rodrigues, which lasted from 1214 to 1218. Three children were born to them:
* Rodrigo (), lord of Aliger and Castro del RÃ­o, and Adelantado of the March of Andalusia, he married InÃ©s RodrÃ­guez, daughter of Rodrigo FernÃ¡ndez de Valduerna, Lord of Cabrera and &quot;alfÃ©rez&quot; of King Alfonso IX.
* Aldonza (died after 1267). Married count Pedro Ponce de Cabrera, and had issue. They are the ancestors of the Ponce de LeÃ³n family.
* Teresa Alfonso of LeÃ³n, the wife of NuÃ±o GonzÃ¡lez de Lara &quot;el Bueno&quot;.

Some families that arrive to Los Altos de Jalisco in Mexico like Gutierrez descend from the union of Alfonso with Aldonza MartÃ­nez de Silva

King Alfonso&#x27;s most long-lasting extra-marital relationship, which began in 1218 and lasted until his death in 1230, was with Teresa Gil de Soverosa. A member of the Portuguese nobility, Teresa was the daughter of Gil Vasques de Soverosa and his first wife MarÃ­a Aires de Fornelos. They had four children, all of them born between 1218 and 1230:
* Sancha (d. 1270). Married Simon Ruiz, Lord of Los Cameros. She later became a nun at the convent of Santa Eufemia de Cozuelos which she had founded.
* MarÃ­a (died after July 1275). Her first marriage was with Ãlvaro FernÃ¡ndez de Lara. She was then the concubine of her nephew King Alfonso X of Castile and, according to the Count of Barcelos, her second husband was Suero Arias de Valladares.
* MartÃ­n (died 1268/1272), married to Maria Mendes de Sousa, founders of the Monastery of Sancti-SpÃ­ritus, Salamanca. There was no issue from this marriage.
* Urraca (d. after 1252). First married GarcÃ­a Romeu, and then Pedro NÃºÃ±ez de GuzmÃ¡n.

Although Alfonso IX is supposed to have had another son, Pedro Alfonso de LeÃ³n, there is no documentary proof that he was the king&#x27;s son or that he was the Grand Master of the Order of Santiago.

<text>Park City is a city in Utah, United States. Most of the city is within Summit County, with some portions extending into Wasatch County. It is considered to be part of the Wasatch Back. The city is southeast of downtown Salt Lake City and from Salt Lake City&#x27;s east edge of Sugar House along Interstate 80. The population was 8,396 at the 2020 census. On average, the tourist population greatly exceeds the number of permanent residents.

After a population decline following the shutdown of the area&#x27;s mining industry, the city rebounded during the 1980s and 1990s through an expansion of its tourism business. According to 2021 data, the city brought in a yearly average of $529.8 million to the Utah economy as a tourist hot spot, $80 million of which was attributed to the Sundance Film Festival. The city has two major ski resorts: Deer Valley Resort and Park City Mountain Resort (combined with Canyons Village at Park City) and one minor resort: Woodward Park City (an action sports training and fun center). Both Deer Valley and Park City Mountain Resorts were the major locations for ski and snowboarding events at the 2002 Winter Olympics, and are expected to reprise these roles for the 2034 Winter Olympics. Although they receive less snow and have a shorter ski season than do their counterparts in Salt Lake County, such as Snowbird resort, they are much easier to access.

In 2015, Park City Ski Resort and Canyons resorts merged, creating the largest ski area in the U.S. In all, the resort boasts 17 slopes, 14 bowls, 300 trails and of lifts.

The city is the main location of the United States&#x27; largest independent film festival, the Sundance Film Festival; home of the United States Ski Team; training center for members of the Australian Freestyle Ski Team; the largest collection of factory outlet stores in northern Utah; the 2002 Olympic bobsled/skeleton/luge track at the Utah Olympic Park; and golf courses. Some scenes from the 1994 film &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; were shot in the city. Outdoor-oriented businesses such as backcountry.com, Rossignol USA, and Skullcandy have their headquarters in Park City. The city has many retailers, clubs, bars, and restaurants, and has nearby reservoirs, hot springs, forests, and hiking and biking trails.

In the summertime, many valley residents of the Wasatch Front visit the town to escape high temperatures. Park City is usually cooler than Salt Lake City as it lies mostly higher than above sea level, while Salt Lake City is situated at an elevation of about .

In 2011, the town was awarded a Gold-level Ride Center designation from the International Mountain Bicycling Association for its mountain bike trails, amenities and community. Park City Municipal, along with Basin Recreation manage bike trails in Park City.

Park City is served by &quot;The Park Record&quot; (the oldest continually published non-daily paper in Utah, and one of the oldest in the U.S.), TownLift (online news), and KPCW (a local NPR news/radio affiliate).

== History ==

The area was traveled by the early Mormon pioneers on their journey to where they settled and built Salt Lake City. One of their leaders, Parley P. Pratt, explored the canyon in 1848. He was given a charter the following year to build a toll road through it, which was finished in 1849. The basin at the top of the canyon was an ideal place to graze, and a few families settled. Early on, the area was deeded to Samuel Snyder, Heber C. Kimball and Jedediah Grant. The settlers named it &quot;Parley&#x27;s Park City&quot;, which was shortened to &quot;Park City&quot; upon the town&#x27;s incorporation in 1884. The first known discovery of ore in this area was by men serving under Colonel Patrick E. Connor, who invited his men to prospect in the area after having been relocated from Gold Rush-era California. The finding of silver, gold and lead sparked the first silver mines in Park City in the 1860s. Park City&#x27;s large mining boom brought large crowds of prospectors setting up camps around the mountain terrain, marking the first mining settlements. Although it was not the first find, the Ontario silver mine, discovered by Herman Buden in 1872 and quickly purchased by George Hearst through his business partner R. C. Chambers, was the first major producer.
Another prominent mining family was that of William Montague Ferry Jr. Ferry Moved to Utah from West Michigan already a very wealthy man. He had previously been a Colonel in the Union Army, mayor of Grand Haven, and was son of wealthy businessman William Montague Ferry. Ferry was followed by a group of other wealthy Michiganders (including his brother Edward Payson Ferry) who came to be the social elites of the town. The Ferry family owned numerous mines including the Marsac Silver mining Company and the Silver King Coalition Mines. Col Ferry also donated the land for Westminster College and unsuccessfully ran for governor of Utah. Edward Ferry&#x27;s son W. Mont Ferry was mayor of Salt Lake City.

In 1880, a spur line was established to the Echo station of the First transcontinental railroad. By 1892 the Silver King Mine and its owners Thomas Kearns and David Keith took the spotlight as one of the most famous silver mines in the world. While silver mines were doing well in Utah, other mines around the world were not doing as well, which drew many of these miners to Park City. The town flourished with crowds of miners and wealth, but by the 1950s, the town nearly became a ghost town. This was due in part to a drop in the price of silver.


The town was nearly destroyed by fire in 1898. Another accident occurred in 1902 when 34 miners were killed in an explosion in the Daly West Mine.

The transformation of Park City into a ski destination town is primarily attributed to declining silver and metal prices during and following World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. The mining community never fully recovered and so the town turned to skiing. The silver industry was suffering when &#x27;Parkite&#x27; miners presented to Utahns Inc. a proposal for a ski resort called Treasure Mountain. United Park City Mines, who owned the land the resort would be built on, received a land-redevelopment grant from the John F. Kennedy Administration. Treasure Mountains (now Park City Mountain Resort) opened in 1963 on of land the miners owned with mineral rights. This is said to be when tourists first largely began to visit Park City. This marks the beginning of the ski industry largely promoted by the Utah State Legislation as a destination resort.

Since the rise of the skiing and tourist economy, Park City houses more tourists than residents. It has become a place of fame through the 2002 Winter Olympic Games and provides more attractions than ever before. In the 1950s, Utah began to use Park City as a mountain getaway, and not until D. James Canon promoted winter sports in Utah, with the promotional scheme of &quot;Ski Utah&quot; and &quot;The Greatest Snow on Earth&quot; did many drive to see the city. Utah drew in over 648,000 tourists in 1970 and now a yearly average of 4 million tourists. In a town with a population of 8,000, the average number of tourists in Park City is 600,000 per year. This significant increase in visitors could be credited to promotional material that is distributed by the Utah Publicity and Tourist Council. Growth has accelerated in the last few decades, and Park City is now one of the most affluent resort towns in the United States.

According to the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, in 2012 travel, tourism and recreation generated $7.4 billion in spending and $960.6 million in state and local tax revenue for the State of Utah. That same year Utah&#x27;s total gross domestic product was $128 billion, making tourism 5.8% of GDP for the Utah economy as a whole. Park City draws in 3,006,071 average annual visitors; in the winter 1,603,775, and in the summer 1,402,296. Park City benefits from the average nightly visitor spending $100 to $350. Currently, Park City primarily relies on its tourist industry from skiing to restaurants to hiking and biking. The makeover of Park City has stimulated a culture of expenditure, adventure, wealth, and this is included in their promotional material.

To this day, there are still more than of old silver-mine workings and tunnels beneath the slopes at Park City Mountain Resort and neighboring Deer Valley. On Main Street, 64 Victorian buildings are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. There are many remaining mine buildings, mine shafts (most blocked off from outsiders with large steel doors), and hoists, including the weathered remains of the California-Comstock and Silver King Mines and the water towers once used to hydrate one of the biggest mines, the Silver King, provide some history of this mining town transformed into a skiing resort.

<text>Scottsville is a town in Albemarle and Fluvanna counties in the U.S. state of Virginia. The population was 522 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Charlottesville Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Scottsville Museum provides online archives.

According to Scottsville&#x27;s website, the town &quot;served as Virginia&#x27;s westernmost center of government and commerce during the 1700s, when rivers were the primary means of travel in the new American wilderness.&quot; During the late 18th and the 19th centuries attempts were made to improve navigability along the James, as well as other central Virginian rivers. Part of this was the construction of a canal running roughly parallel with the James west from Richmond. Scottsville was the largest port town along this route, called the James River and Kanawha Canal. The ultimate goal of this project was to connect the Atlantic with the Ohio River via the Kanawha River. These aims were not achieved, due to interruption by the American Civil War and the efficiency of the railroads. It did however succeed in making Scottsville a busy, prominent town. In fact, thanks to a wagon road connecting Staunton to Scottsville, all of the agricultural wealth of the Shenandoah Valley poured into town en route to Richmond and the sea, thereby making Scottsville the largest grain market in the state. Trade was disrupted when Union soldiers broke the canal works in the area. Then the train came, the tracks being laid directly on the towpath of the old canal, a monument to its demise. Eventually, the train too stopped taking passengers, leaving Scottsville a sleepy country town on a coal line.

Located near Scottsville, the Hatton Ferry serves as a seasonal crossing of the James River and has been the location of a ferry since the late 1870s.

Scottsville was the birthplace of Thomas Staples Martin, who served five terms as a Democrat in the United States Senate representing Virginia. Born at Scottsville in 1847, Martin served in the Confederate Army, then went on to practice law.

The Scottsville Historic District, Cliffside, High Meadows, Mount Ida, and Mount Walla are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In September 2019, the Albemarle County Board of Supervisors approved a plan to adjust the town&#x27;s boundaries. The adjustment accounts for the expansion of the Scottsville Volunteer Fire Department and for a clarification of a boundary line along the James River.

==Geography==
Scottsville is located at (37.8022, -78.4969).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 1.5Â square miles (4.0Â km2), all land.

==Transportation==
The main highways serving Scottsville are Virginia State Route 6 and Virginia State Route 20. SR 6 extends westward towards Waynesboro and eastward towards Richmond. SR 20 extends northward towards Charlottesville and southward towards Dillwyn.

==Education==
The Scottsville museum website provides detailed information about and photographs of the school provision in Scottsville.

In the Jim Crow era, education was racially segregated until the 1960s. Segregated provision was made by Scottsville School and Esmont High School.

Today, education is provided by Monticello High School, Leslie Walton Middle School and Scottsville Elementary School.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 556 people, 256 households, and 145 families living in the town. The population density was 360.2 people per square mile (139.1/km2).

==Floods==
Scottsville has not flooded since the levee was constructed in 1985. Since 1870, Scottsville has had twenty-one floods (defined as water levels of twenty feet or more above the average low water level). In 1985, the Army Corps of Engineers built a levee around the lowest portion of Scottsville, providing protection against further floods. Mayor A. Raymon Thacker spearheaded the movement to build the levee starting after Hurricane Agnes to prevent any more floods affecting Scottsville. The levee has been very effective preventing numerous floods in the post levee era.

<text>Grottoes is a town in Rockingham and Augusta counties in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The population was 2,899 at the 2020 census. The town lies right on the border with Augusta County, and several commercial, residential, and recreational lots have portions within Augusta County.

The town is part of the Harrisonburg Metropolitan Statistical Area, while the small portion that extends into Augusta County is part of the StauntonâWaynesboro Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Grottoes is home to Grand Caverns, America&#x27;s oldest show cave (opened for tours in 1806).

==History==
The town was previously known as Liola in the 1880s, then briefly called Grottoes (meaning &quot;caves&quot;) in 1889. A group of land speculators formally founded Shendun, a combination of &quot;Shenandoah&quot; and the Gaelic word &quot;dun&quot; meaning &#x27;castle&#x27; or &#x27;fortified hill&#x27;, in 1892. Through a series of financial missteps, the Shendun Corporation went bankrupt in 1893. On March 11, 1912 the name was officially changed back to Grottoes.

Situated between the South Fork of the Shenandoah River and Brown&#x27;s Gap, the town benefited from easy access to surrounding towns and natural resources. In 1933 a Civilian Conservation Corps Camp No. 1369 was established 3 miles east of Grottoes, and they built trails and roads into Shenandoah National Park that still exist today. The former CCC camp also served as Civilian Public Service Camp No. 4, a place for conscientious objectors to serve during World War II, and around 100 young Mennonite men lived and worked within four main categories: Soil Conservation, Forestry Service, National Park Service, and Land Reclamation Service.
Grand Caverns was designated a National Natural Landmark by the National Park Service in 1973. The Stephen Harnsberger House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

==Geography==
Grottoes is located at (38.267385, â78.824868) in the Shenandoah Valley. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

The geographical location, within 15 miles of Waynesboro, Staunton, Harrisonburg, and Elkton, continues to be a major asset of the town. Additionally Grottoes is 43 miles from Charlottesville, 87 miles from Winchester, and 105 miles from Roanoke. Major geographic features in the area include Skyline Drive, Massanutten Peak, and Natural Chimneys.

==Transportation==
The main highways providing access to Grottoes are U.S. Route 340 and Virginia State Route 256. US 340 provides northâsouth access, connecting to Interstate 64 near Waynesboro and U.S. Route 33 near Elkton. SR 256 provides access to and from the west, connecting to Interstate 81 near Weyers Cave.

Previous routes of transport included overland through Brown&#x27;s Gap to the east, by rail on the Norfolk Southern (formerly the Shenandoah Valley Railroad), or by water on the South Fork to nearby Port Republic and then on the Shenandoah River all the way to Harpers Ferry, WV.

<doc id="151256" wikidata="Q2480691" url="?curid=151256" title="Ramsey Abbey">
<text>Ramsey Abbey was a Benedictine abbey in Ramsey, Huntingdonshire (now part of Cambridgeshire), England. It was founded about AD 969 and dissolved in 1539.

The site of the abbey in Ramsey is now a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Most of the abbey&#x27;s buildings were demolished after the dissolution but surviving structures are Grade I and Grade II* listed buildings. Ramsey Abbey Gatehouse is in the care of the National Trust and the Church of St Thomas Ã  Becket, Ramsey was one of the buildings of the abbey.

==The Abbey==
Ramsey Abbey was founded in 969 by Oswald, Bishop of Worcester on land donated by Ãthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia (Earl Ailwyn), where he had already built a wooden chapel for three monks. The foundation was part of the mid-10th century English Benedictine reform, in which Ely and Peterborough were also refounded. Ãthelwine gave the new foundation properties including an estate at nearby Bodsey and Houghton Mill.

The Frankish scholar Abbo of Fleury came to Ramsey at Oswald&#x27;s invitation during the period 985â7, when his fortunes at Fleury Abbey were at a low ebb. He wrote two surviving works for his students while he was there; the &quot;Passio S. Eadmundi&quot; and the &quot;questiones grammaticales&quot;.
The important Ramsey Psalter or Psalter of Oswald (British Library, Harley MS 2904) is an Anglo-Saxon illuminated psalter of the last quarter of the tenth century. Certain liturgical features have suggested that it was intended for use at Ramsey Abbey, or for the personal use of Ramsey&#x27;s founder Oswald of Worcester. This is not to be confused with another Ramsey Psalter in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (MS M. 302), made between 1286 and 1316.

Ãthelwine at the suggestion of Oswald of Worcester founded a small hermitage for three hermits with a wooden chapel at a location indicated by the actions of a bull, on the island of Ramsey with impassible fen on three sides. Impressed by the story Oswald sent a prior, Germanus and twelve monks from Westbury-on-Trym to form the Abbey. Starting in 969, a large stone-built church was built over the next five years. Two towers stood up at the topmost points of the roofs, the smaller one at the front of the church towards the west, &#x27;offered a beautiful sight from afar&#x27; to people coming to the island. The larger one, in the middle of a four-armed structure rested on four columns stabilised by connecting arches. This abbey building remained until a Norman abbot had a grander church built in the 12th century.

In 1143 Geoffrey de Mandeville expelled the monks, used the abbey as a fortress and considerably damaged the buildings. The abbey suffered for three centuries from disputes with the bishops of Ely over the manors of Chatteris and Somersham. It paid 4,000 eels yearly to Peterborough Abbey for access to its quarries of limestone at Barnack.

In the order of precedence for abbots in Parliament, Ramsey was third after Glastonbury and St Alban&#x27;s.

The abbey was an international centre of Hebrew scholarship in the late Middle Ages. It prospered until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537. At the time of the Dissolution there were 34 monks.

In 1787 Mark Noble noted:
==After the Dissolution==
In 1540 the Crown sold the abbey lands to Sir Richard Williams (alias Cromwell). He used most of the abbey buildings as a source of stone for walls and cottages at hand, and to provide good Barnack stone for new buildings. He had part of the abbey gatehouse dismantled and re-erected at Hinchingbrooke House. Much stone was taken to Cambridge to build Gonville and Caius, King&#x27;s and Trinity colleges. Stone was taken for the tower for the parish church of St Mary the Virgin in Godmanchester. This included a doorway from the abbey that was dismantled and re-erected as the west doorway of St Mary&#x27;s. As late as 1672 stone for a new tower for Ramsey&#x27;s own parish church of St Thomas Ã  Becket was also taken from the Abbey.
Around 1600 Sir Henry Williams (alias Cromwell) had a house built on the site of the abbey church. Six bays of the 13th-century Lady Chapel survive as the basement of the house.

In 1737 Coulson Fellowes, later MP for Huntingdonshire, bought the house. It passed down through several generations of the family. In 1804â06 William Henry Fellowes had the abbey house enlarged to designs by Sir John Soane. In 1889 his son Edward Fellowes was created 1st Baron de Ramsey. In 1931 at the coming of age of John Ailwyn Fellowes, 4th Baron de Ramsey the family moved its seat to Abbots Ripton Hall. In 1937 the Fellowes leased the building for 99 years to Ramsey Abbey School. In 1952 Major The Hon. Henry Rogers Broughton gave the gatehouse to the National Trust in memory of his late wife The Hon. Diana Broughton ().

==Surviving buildings and artefacts==

Ramsey Abbey House, the Gatehouse, and the parish church of St Thomas Ã  Becket all survive, along with part of the abbey&#x27;s medieval precinct wall.

Ramsey Abbey House, the former 17th century home of Sir Henry Cromwell and latterly the seat of the Fellowes family, is currently part of Abbey College, Ramsey. The Bodsey monastic grange survives as the Grade-I listed Bodsey House.

The Abbey Gatehouse is a National Trust property. This is believed to be an inner gatehouse, the main outer gatehouse was removed by Sir Henry Williams (alias Cromwell), the son and heir of Sir Richard, to form the main gateway to Hinchingbrooke House in Huntingdon, his newly built winter residence. Today what remains of the gatehouse also forms a part of the Abbey College.

The Church of St Thomas Ã  Becket, Ramsey was built in about 1180 or 1190 as either the &quot;hospitium&quot; or the infirmary of the abbey. It was originally an aisled hall with a chapel at the east end with a vestry on the north side and the warden&#x27;s lodgings on the south, but both these have been demolished. The building was converted into a parish church in about 1222.

When Whittlesey Mere was drained, a thurible and other silver items were found in the bed of the mere and, from the ram&#x27;s head on one of these pieces, were believed to have come from the Abbey. The thurible (or censer), and an incense boat are now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. Also found in the bed were blocks of quarried stone, that are conjectured to have fallen from a barge on the way to the Abbey.

<doc id="151257" wikidata="Q295268" url="?curid=151257" title="Alfonso VIII of Castile">
<text>Alfonso VIII (11 November 11555 October 1214), called the Noble (El Noble) or the one of Las Navas (el de las Navas), was King of Castile from 1158 to his death and King of Toledo. After having suffered a great defeat with his own army at Alarcos against the Almohads in 1195, he led the coalition of Christian princes and foreign crusaders who broke the power of the Almohads in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, an event which marked the arrival of a tide of Christian supremacy on the Iberian Peninsula.

His reign saw the domination of Castile over LeÃ³n and, by his alliance with Aragon, he drew those two spheres of Christian Iberia into close connection.

==Regency and civil war==
Alfonso was born to Sancho III of Castile and Blanche, in Soria on 11 November 1155. He was named after his grandfather Alfonso VII of LeÃ³n and Castile, who divided his kingdoms between his sons. This division set the stage for conflict in the family until the kingdoms were re-united by Alfonso VIII&#x27;s grandson, Ferdinand III of Castile.

His early life resembled that of other medieval kings. His father died in 1158. Though proclaimed king when only two years of age, Alfonso was regarded as merely nominal by the unruly nobles to whom a minority was convenient. Immediately, Castile was plunged into conflicts between the various noble houses vying for ascendancy in the inevitable regency. The devotion of a squire of his household, who carried him on the pommel of his saddle to the stronghold of San Esteban de Gormaz, saved him from falling into the hands of the contending factions. The noble houses of Lara and Castro both claimed the regency, as did the boy&#x27;s uncle, Ferdinand II of LeÃ³n. In 1159 the young Alfonso was put briefly in the custody of GarcÃ­a GarcÃ©s de Aza, who was not wealthy enough to support him. In March 1160 the Castro and Lara met at the Battle of Lobregal and the Castro were victorious, but the guardianship of Alfonso and the regency fell to Manrique PÃ©rez de Lara.

Alfonso was put in the custody of the loyal village Ãvila. At barely fifteen, he began restoring his kingdom to order. It was only by surprise that he recovered his capital Toledo from the hands of the Laras.

==Marriage and foreign relations==
During the regency, his uncle Sancho VI of Navarre took advantage of the chaos and the king&#x27;s minority to seize lands along the border, including much of La Rioja. In 1170, Alfonso sent an embassy to Bordeaux to Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine to seek the hand of their daughter Eleanor. The marriage treaty helped provide Alfonso with a powerful ally against his uncle. In 1176, Alfonso asked his father-in-law to arbitrate the disputed border territories. While Alfonso received back much that had been taken from him, he had to pay significant monetary compensation.

In 1186, he recuperated part of La Rioja from the Kingdom of Navarre.

In 1187, Alfonso negotiated with Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, who was seeking to marry his son Conrad to Alfonso&#x27;s eldest child and heiress, Berengaria. In April 1188, they agreed on a treaty in Seligenstadt, which made clear that she was the heiress of Castile after any sons of Alfonso and that Conrad would only co-rule as her spouse. That became relevant in her ultimate succession to the throne even though the marriage to Conrad was never consummated and later annulled. The treaty also documented traditional rights and obligations between the sovereign and the nobles in Castile. In July 1188, Alfonso convened his court in CarriÃ³n de los Condes to allow the nobles to review and ratify the treaty. At that court, Alfonso knighted both Conrad and Alfonso IX of LeÃ³n, who would ultimately marry Berengaria. The younger Alfonso had come to seek the support and acknowledgement of his ascent to the throne of LeÃ³n from his older cousin. The elder Alfonso granted that in exchange for acknowledgement that the king of Castile was overlord of the king of LeÃ³n.

The relationship between the cousins Alfonso continued to be filled with conflict. In 1194, the papal legate negotiated a treaty between them to temporarily end the conflict. However, after Castile was defeated at the Battle of Alarcos, the younger Alfonso seized the opportunity to again attack his cousin. Castille defended itself with papal support. A more lasting peace was achieved finally by the older Alfonso&#x27;s daughter Berengaria marrying the younger Alfonso in 1197. The annulment of this marriage by the pope drove the younger Alfonso to again attack his cousin in 1204, but treaties made in 1205, 1207, and 1209 each forced him to concede further territories and rights. The treaty in 1207 is the first existing public document in the Castilian dialect.

Around 1200 when his brother in law John was on the English throne, Alfonso began to claim that Gascony was part of Eleanor&#x27;s dowry, though there was nothing in the marriage treaty to indicate this. In 1205, he invaded, hoping to make good on his claim. By 1208, he gave up on the venture, though his heirs would come back to this claim generations later.

==Reconquista==

In 1174, he ceded UclÃ©s to the Order of Santiago and afterwards this became the order&#x27;s principal seat. From UclÃ©s, he began a campaign which culminated in the Conquest of Cuenca in 1177. The city surrendered on 21 September, the feast of Saint Matthew, ever afterwards celebrated by the citizens of the town.

Alfonso took the initiative to ally all Christian kingdoms of the peninsulaâNavarre, LeÃ³n, Portugal, and Aragonâagainst the Almohads. By the Treaty of Cazola of 1179, the zones of expansion of each kingdom were defined.

After founding Plasencia (CÃ¡ceres) in 1186, he embarked on a major initiative to unite the Castilian nobility around the Reconquista.

In 1195, after the treaty with the Almohads was broken, he came to the defence of Alarcos on the river Guadiana, then the principal Castilian town in the region. At the subsequent Battle of Alarcos, he was roundly defeated by the caliph Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur. The reoccupation of the surrounding territory by the Almohads was quickly commenced with Calatrava falling first. For the next seventeen years, the frontier between Moor and Castilian was fixed in the hill country just outside Toledo.

Finally, in 1212, through the mediation of Pope Innocent III, a crusade was called against the Almohads. Castilians under Alfonso, Aragonese and Catalans under Peter II, Navarrese under Sancho VII, and Franks under the archbishop of Narbonne, Arnaud Amalric, all flocked to the effort. The military orders also lent their support. Calatrava first, then Alarcos, and finally Benavente were captured before a final battle was fought at Las Navas de Tolosa near Santa Elena on 16 July. The caliph Muhammad al-Nasir was routed and Almohad power broken.

==Cultural legacy==
Alfonso was the founder of the first Spanish university, a &quot;studium generale&quot; at Palencia, which, however, did not survive him. His court also served as an important instrument for Spanish cultural achievement. Alfonso and his wife Eleanor of England were the first to make the AlcÃ¡zar of Segovia as their residence when this fortress was still at its early stages.

Alfonso died at Gutierre-MuÃ±oz and was succeeded by his surviving son, Henry I.

Alfonso was the subject for Lion Feuchtwanger&#x27;s novel &quot;Die JÃ¼din von Toledo&quot; (&quot;The Jewess of Toledo&quot;), in which is narrated an affair with a Jewish subject in medieval Toledo in a time when Spain was known to be the land of tolerance and learning for Jews, Christians, and Muslims. The titular Jewish woman of the novel is based on Alfonso&#x27;s paramour, Rahel la Fermosa. Scholars continue to debate the historical truth of this relationship. The 1919 film &quot;The Jewess of Toledo&quot; by Franz HÃ¶bling is also based on this relationship.

==Children==
With Eleanor of England, Alfonso had 11 children:
Through his daughters, Berengaria and Blanche, he was the grandfather of two monarchs who became saints of the Roman Church.

<text>Farmville is a town in Prince Edward and Cumberland counties in the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is the county seat of Prince Edward County. The population was 7,473 at the 2020 census. It was in a major tobacco growing area. Coal mining and brick making also occurred in the area.

Farmville developed near the headwaters of the Appomattox River in central Virginia; the waterway was long its main transportation access to other markets. In the 19th century, a railroad was constructed here. Since the late 20th century, the former railway has been converted to the High Bridge Trail State Park, a more than rail trail park. US 15, VA 45 and US 460 now intersect at Farmville. The town is the home of Longwood University and is the town nearest to HampdenâSydney College.

== History ==
Near the headwaters of the Appomattox River, the town of Farmville was formed in 1798 and incorporated in 1912.

===Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System===
Between 1795 and 1890, Farmville was the end of the line for the Upper Appomattox Canal Navigation System, built to improve navigation on the river. Enslaved African Americans built the canal system that allowed commodity crops of tobacco and farm produce to be loaded on a James River bateau in Farmville and shipped to Petersburg, Virginia. The canals were used until railroads were constructed in this area.

Many of the boatmen who worked near Farmville were free people of color. They lived in the Israel Hill community. Israel Hill was home to both White people and free African-American laborers, craftsmen, and farmers freed from the end of the Revolutionary War to around 1810. People of African and European descent worked for the same wages, built a church together, and could have resort to the court of law within the 350-acre town.

===Local coal===
John Flournoy was the first to mine coal near Farmville. He started in 1833 working on a seam, which was two feet thick. In 1837 the General Assembly granted a charter to The Prince Edward Coal Mining Company to mine and sell coal. This company was still in operation into the 1880s.

Another coal pit in the 1880s was worked on the W.W. Jackson property. The coal from this small pit was used to fuel his blacksmith shop on the same property.&quot; The coal deposits are part of the Farmville Basin, one of the Eastern North America Rift Basins west of modern-day, Virginia State Route 45.

===Southside Railroad===
In the 1850s, the Southside Railroad from Petersburg to Lynchburg was built through Farmville. The route, which was subsidized by a contribution from Farmville, required an expensive crossing of the Appomattox River slightly downstream, which became known as the High Bridge. This became the Atlantic, Mississippi and Ohio Railroad in 1870; the Norfolk and Western Railway took it over, and now the line is part of the Norfolk Southern Railway.

The bridge and the rail line from Burkville to Pamplin City was converted by Virginia Department of Parks and Recreation into High Bridge Trail State Park, based on a rail to trail project.

===Piedmont Mine===
The Virginia General Assembly chartered the Piedmont Coal Company for John Dalby in 1860. The mine was near Buckingham Plank Road, Virginia State Route 600 in Cumberland, a mile and a half west of Raines Tavern, Virginia.

Without rail transportation close to Raines Tavern, the transportation cost of getting the coal to Farmville and then by rail to Richmond was too high to sell it at a competitive price. The coal was sold locally to people in the area for heating their homes.

During the American Civil War, the mines continued to operate but then production fell off. Coal was still there, though, Daddow and Bannon documented seven or eight coal seams and anthracite in 1866.

===Civil War===

Confederate General Robert E. Lee retreated through Farmville as he escaped the Union Army. Farmville was the object of the Confederate Army&#x27;s desperate push to get rations to feed its soldiers near the end of the American Civil War. The rations had originally been destined for Danville, but an alert quartermaster ordered the train back to Farmville. Despite an advance of the cavalry commanded by Fitzhugh Lee, the Confederate Army was checked by the arrival of Union cavalry commanded by Gen. Philip Sheridan and two divisions of infantry. General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia found itself soon surrounded. He surrendered at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.

The Prince Edward county seat was moved from Worsham to Farmville in 1871.

===Independent Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery===
The Independent Order of Odd Fellows Cemetery, also known as the Odd Fellows Cemetery, is in Farmville, Virginia. Several prominent state legislators and civil rights advocates who were African American are buried in the cemetery. The cemetery also has approximately 31 headstones from World War I.

====Burials====
*James W. D. Bland, state senator
*Tazewell Branch (1828â1925) House of Delegates member
*Nathaniel M. Griggs, member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Virginia Senate
*L. Francis Griffin, civil rights campaigner who sued to stop segregation in Prince Edward County, Virginia&#x27;s public schools

===Clay brick kiln===
There was a brick-making industry in Farmville, using the clay of the Farmville Basin. In 1874, M.R. Murkland built a kiln for his hand-formed bricks. He made around 600,000 bricks each year. The Triassic clay of the Farmville Basin was mixable and plastic enough and would not shrink too much, which made it suitable for bricks.

===Rail transport ===

Rail Transport from Cumberland County helped Cumberland farmers sell fruits, vegetables and timber to Farmville markets. From 1884 to 1917, the Farmville and Powhatan Railroad, later named the Tidewater and Western Railroad, was important to Cumberland County residents for markets and transportation and the telegraph. The owners hoped that the line could ship products all the way to the end of the line in Chester, Virginia and docks in the Tidewater region to make the railroad profitable. The line had trouble competing with the Standard gauge Southside Railroad.

====Coal to ship over rails====
It was rumored that the coal near Farmville would draw the Orange &amp; Keysville Railway which was chartered, graded and the right of way was purchased, between Farmville and Hampden Sydney. However, the rails were never laid down. The coal field was idle until 1891 when the Farmville Coal and Iron Company began leasing land, selling stock and reopened the Piedmont mines. The company built a one and a half mile spur rail line from the Farmville and Powhatan Railroad to the mine. This railroad provided transport from the mine to the docks at Bermuda Hundred in the Tidewater region. On Jan. 24, 1891, an editor of âThe Financial Mining Recordâ suggested that the Farmville Coal &amp; Iron Company, did not have enough coal production to justify a fraction of its stock price. The Norfolk and Western Railway, since 1883, had been bringing in coal from a new coal mine. The Pocahontas Coalfield which could provide coal more cheaply and ship the coal on a larger standard gauge, class one railroad. This decreased to the economic viability of mining coal in the Richmond and Farmville Basins. The Farmville Coal and Iron Company went bankrupt a few years later, possibly before any coal was mined.

The Farmville Coal &amp; Iron Company did bring positive change. They requested that the town build an electric power plant and a waterworks. Designation of the power plant was established in 1890 and the water works were designated in 1893.

===Farmville Lithia Springs===
Farmville Lithia Springs bottled and sold mineral water from Farmville from 1884 to 1901. The lithia springs were considered as a possible destination for tourists but the investors decided to bottle the water and ship it. The water was tested and found to be superior to waters from Carlsbad, Germany. Lithia Springs Water from Farmville was shipped domestically and internationally for water cure. The springs were just north of the Appomattox River from Farmville.

Lithia Springs water contained the following minerals naturally occurring in the water.
*Lithia water
*Magnesium
*Chalybeate
*Iodine
*Alum

===Economic disparity among diverse groups===
In 1897, economic conditions were different for African-Americans, and white people in Farmville. Even though there were twice as many black people as white people, white people owned ten times the value of real estate. Without land or inherited wealth, black people found it difficult to get established. There were black shop keepers, bricklayers, tobacco workers, the shop keepers got money to buy their stores as laborers in New York. Many black men left to go north to make money leaving women behind. Among the black community, Israel Hill Hamlet was more stable, than other places because they owned their land.

===&quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot;===

Farmville and Prince Edward County Public Schools were the source of &quot;Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County&quot; (1952â54), a case incorporated into &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the landmark case that overturned school segregation in the United States. Among the cases consolidated into the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, the &quot;Davis&quot; case was the only one involving student protests.

R.R. Moton High School, an all-black school in Farmville named for Robert Russa Moton, suffered from terrible conditions due to underfunding by white officials in the segregated state. The school did not have a gymnasium, cafeteria, or teachers&#x27; restrooms. Teachers and students did not have desks or blackboards, and due to overcrowding, some students had to take classes in a school bus parked outside. The school&#x27;s requests for additional funds were denied by the all-white school board. Students had protested against the poor conditions.

As a result of the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, in 1959 the Board of Supervisors for Prince Edward County refused to appropriate any funds for the County School Board; in massive resistance, it effectively closed all public schools rather than integrate them. Wealthy white students usually attended all-white private schools (segregation academies) that formed in response. Black and poorer white students had to go to school elsewhere or forgo their education altogether. Prince Edward County&#x27;s public schools remained closed for ten years. When they finally reopened, the system was fully integrated.

Prince Edward Academy was the longest-surviving of the segregation academies, still teaching students in 2019. Although technically integrated at that point, the school had few students of color. Prince Edward Academy was renamed the Fuqua School in honor of J. B. Fuqua, a wealthy businessman who was raised nearby and who has endowed the school.

The former R.R. Moton High School building was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1998 for its significance to the Civil Rights Movement. It houses the Robert Russa Moton Museum, a center for the study of civil rights in education. In 2015, Longwood University and Moton Museum entered into a formal affiliation to advance understanding of the history of the struggle for civil rights.

==Infrastructure==

===Volunteer fire fighting===
The Farmville Volunteer Fire Department is designated as Company 1 in Prince Edward County after being the first fire department established in the county in 1870. The FFD provides services to nearly 10,000 people in their first due, which comprises the entire town of Farmville, and into the immediately surrounding area of Prince Edward County, Buckingham County, and Cumberland County.

Firefighting apparatus include an engine, ladder truck, and a rescue-squad. The department&#x27;s fleet also contains an Emergency Medical Services quick response pick-up truck, and a support pick-up truck, along with a hazmat, decontamination, and spill/leak supply trailer.

===Water===
Farmville&#x27;s water and sewer services are publicly owned and operated by the Town of Farmville work crew. The town&#x27;s water treatment plant draws its water supplies from the Appomattox River. Water from the river is treated to kill any waterborne pathogens. After that process all sedimentation is removed through a series of filtration tanks. The water plant sells a portion of this removed sedimentation to be mixed with topsoil and then to be made ready for farm use. The excess sedimentation is recycled back into the Appomattox. The water plant can store 200,000 gallons of fresh water which can be transferred to Farmville&#x27;s water towers when needed. Currently Farmville averages 1 million gallons of water usage per day, and its water plant is capable of producing up to 3 million gallons. The water is used by the majority of the town and the Prince Edward schools.

The town of Farmville is located within the Piedmont Region and has many tributaries which filter into the Appomattox River. After the water reaches the Appomattox River it drains into the James River and then is distributed into the Chesapeake Bay. Within Farmville there are several different areas which are a concern due to high amounts of heterotrophic bacteria and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, classified as coliform bacteria they live within the intestines of warm blooded animals. The strain of &quot;E. coli&quot; which is of most concern is the 0157 H7 strain because it can produce dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, and in extreme cases even death. There are a couple of drains which are located within Farmville and its neighboring counties which are of concern, including Gross Creek, which usually exceeds the standards of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The wastewater plant covers a more extensive area which includes all residents of Farmville, Prince Edward schools, Hampden Sydney and north to the Cumberland County Court area. The plant treats approximately 1.7 million gallons a day and is capable of handling 2.4 million gallons. The wastewater undergoes an extensive treatment process based on parameters set by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality before being released back into the Appomattox River downstream of Farmville. All residents of Farmville are required to use the public sewage line. The only exception is granted to residents who have been using a private septic system prior to being annexed to the town. Both the water plant and the water treatment plant undergo a consumer confidence test every spring and have never received any violations. Contamination levels in the town&#x27;s waterways are currently being checked bimonthly to monitor the water quality of creeks and streams leaving Farmville. Tests are conducted to see if the town&#x27;s water pipes are leaching any pollutants into the environment and to detect any other sources of contamination. The information from test results is available at the Virginia DEQ website.

<doc id="151262" wikidata="Q1373638" url="?curid=151262" title="Occoquan, Virginia">
<text>Occoquan () is a town in eastern Prince William County, Virginia founded in 1804. The population was 934 at the 2010 United States Census. The current mayor is Earnest W. Porta Jr. Today, the town is a restored artists&#x27; community, with shops, outdoor dining, ghost walks, and a town boat dock, as well as historic buildings dating back to the 19th century.

== History ==
Occoquan is derived from an Algonquian Doeg Indian word, meaning &quot;at the end of the water&quot;. Located on the Occoquan River, Occoquan was long a site of indigenous peoples&#x27; habitation. Like the British colonists after them, they relied on the river for transportation and trade, as well as fish. Early in the 1600s Capt. John Smith sailed and explored the Occoquan River. In 1608, when the first European reached Northern Virginia, the Tauxenent tribe (also known by the English as the &quot;Dogues&quot;) had its main village at the mouth of the Occoquan River. This tribe was more closely associated with neighbors such as the Piscataways (located across the Potomac River in what is now Maryland) than the other Algonquian-speaking tribes to the south. The local chief was called a Tayac, who was subservient to an &quot;emperor&quot; located in Prince Georgeâs County.

By 1765, Anglo-American colonists had established an industrial settlement at Occoquan, with grist mills and tobacco warehouses. The Merchants Mill established by Quaker Nathaniel Ellicot may have been the first automated grist mill in the nation. It operated for 175 years until destroyed by fire.

During the Civil War, the post office passed letters and packages between North and South. River silting reduced ship traffic to Occoquan and ended its days as a port, as did the shift in traffic to railroads.

== Local attractions ==

A number of structures in town, including many in the downtown commercial area, are part of the Occoquan Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Rockledge, the former house of the town&#x27;s founder, is also listed as a significant structure on the NRHP.

Historic houses in Occoquan include a 17th-century house at 206 Mill Street and Rockledge Manor, a Georgian mansion built in 1758 by John Ballandine and British architect William Buckland. Two hotels in the town date back to the early 1800s: the Hamill Hotel built in 1804 and the Occoquan Inn built in 1810. The oldest brick structure in Occoquan, the Hamill Hotel once housed Confederate troops under General Wade Hampton. 

The Mill House Museum in Occoquan is operated daily except Wednesdays by the Occoquan Historical Society. The Odd Fellows Hall on 308 Commerce Street dates back to 1889 but was renovated to add an upstairs porch.

Clarksville was the first incorporated town in the county of Mecklenburg. In 1818, the town was named after its founder, Clark Royster. Settlers populated the area quickly because of the temperate climate and the fine tobacco soil.

By 1832, Clarksville was recognized as one of the fastest-growing towns in Virginia. The Clarksville Tobacco Market was so large and important that the Roanoke Navigation Company was formed to transport the crop by way of the Roanoke River to Petersburg, a major export town, and other areas. A plank road was built from Clarksville to Petersburg (distance of for overland transport. In years to follow, the Roanoke Valley Railroad was built from Clarksville to Manson, North Carolina.

By 1848, Clarksville was known as a major market for leaf tobacco and a tobacco-manufacturing center. Large shipments of tobacco were exported to Europe. In 1860, R. H. Moss and Brothers Factory in Clarksville was producing more manufactured tobacco than any other establishment in Virginia or the Carolinas. To date, Clarksville proudly claims the title of the oldest continuous tobacco market in the world.

<doc id="151266" wikidata="Q1376615" url="?curid=151266" title="Gordonsville, Virginia">
<text>Gordonsville is a town in Orange County in the Commonwealth of Virginia in the United States. Located about 19 miles northeast of Charlottesville and 65 miles northwest of Richmond, the population was 1,402 at the 2020 census.

The town celebrated its bicentennial in 2013, two hundred years after local innkeeper Nathaniel Gordon was appointed the area&#x27;s first postmaster, thus officially creating the area known as Gordonsville. It was strategically important during the Civil War, due to its location on the Virginia Central Railroad.

Gordonsville claims to have influenced the popularity of fried chicken in the United States; it bills itself as the &quot;Fried Chicken Capital of the World.&quot;

==History==

=== Pre-Civil War ===
In 1787, Nathaniel Gordon purchased 1,350 acres (5.46 square km) of land, then known as &quot;Newville,&quot; from a cousin of President James Madison.

In 1794, or perhaps earlier, Gordon applied for and was granted a license to operate a tavern there, which, as was typical of the time, was used as a place to eat, lodge and discuss local matters. It sat at the intersection of two highways: &quot;The Fredericksburgh Great Road,&quot; a stage route from Charlottesville, through Orange, to Fredericksburg; and &quot;The Richmond Road,&quot; which led from the Virginia capital, through Louisa, west over the Blue Ridge Mountains into the Shenandoah Valley. President Thomas Jefferson described the tavern in 1802 as a &quot;good house&quot; when recommending the best route south to Charlottesville from the recently established national capital on the Potomac. The building was known as Gordon&#x27;s Tavern, Gordon Tavern and later as Gordon Inn. The commemorative marker at the site lists prominent Americans as guests at the tavern: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, James &amp; Philip P. Barbour, James Waddel, William Wirt and Henry Clay. Another famous visitor was Major General the Marquis de Lafayette.

Gordon was named the first postmaster of the area in 1813, and the area became known as Gordonsville. At the time of Gordon&#x27;s death in 1820, Gordonsville had, in addition to the tavern, a post office, several homes, a general mercantile store and a blacksmith shop. Nathaniel willed his land and tavern to his son, John, and near that same time Dr. Charles Beale (husband of Nathaniel&#x27;s daughter, Mary) purchased adjoining land near what is currently Main Street. The later division and sale of lots from this property, and the construction of adjacent roads, would foster growth of the town up to and during the Civil War.

In 1839, the General Assembly authorized the extension of the Louisa Railroad (later the Virginia Central Railroad) from Louisa Courthouse to Gordonsville, which ushered in growth and prosperity for Gordonsville. It became a center of trade for the plantations and farms in the surrounding countryside. Two new roadways, the Blue Ridge Turnpike and the Rockingham Turnpike, were built to connect the town to New Market and Harrisonburg, respectively.

In 1854, the Orange &amp; Alexandria Railroad completed its line into Gordonsville, connecting the area with northern portion of Virginia. Over the next few years, both railroad lines were extended, increasing Gordonsville&#x27;s role as a transportation hub. The rail depots were constructed next to what is now S. Main Street.

Nathaniel Gordon&#x27;s original tavern burned down in 1859. Richard F. Omohundro, who owned the land at the time, rebuilt what is now known as the Exchange Hotel. Following its completion in 1860, the hotel offered elegant lodging for rail passengers and other travelers. During the Civil War, it was used as a receiving hospital that saw more than 70,000 patients. It is now known as the Civil War Exchange Museum and is arguably the most historically and architecturally significant building in Gordonsville.

=== During the Civil War and after ===
Gordonsville and the railroads which intersected there were of vital importance to the Confederacy for troop mobility and supplies. Troops from Richmond on the way to the First Battle of Bull Run on July 21, 1861, came through town. During the war years, Robert E. Lee, James Longstreet, Stonewall Jackson, Richard S. Ewell and A. P. Hill spent time in Gordonsville. Major Gen. Philip Sheridan led a raid in the direction of Gordonsville and Charlottesville but was stopped by Wade Hampton&#x27;s Confederate cavalry in the vicinity of Trevilian Station. Gordonsville was threatened many times but was always successfully defended by the Confederates. The Civil War ended in 1865 and with Gordonsville being largely unscathed, passenger rail service was quickly reestablished.

Gordonsville was officially incorporated into a town in 1870 by an act of the Virginia General Assembly. The population then was approximately 1,500. In the following years it was &quot;a flourishing and fast improving town&quot; and its prosperity gave rise to then-superior educational facilities and fine examples of period architecture, many of which are still standing on N. Main and W. Baker Streets. Gordonsville had the unique reputation as a fast-food emporium in the 1870s, with an active market of food vendors serving rail travelers as they stopped in the town. As alternative rail lines and roads were constructed bypassing Gordonsville, it morphed into a quiet, rural market town. Fires in 1916 and 1920 destroyed much of the downtown, with only a handful of buildings surviving to this day. Damage was repaired and buildings were rebuilt, largely shaping modern-day Gordonsville. The town has remained economically stable through current times, as has its population.

In the early 1970s, following the 100-year anniversary of the town&#x27;s incorporation, a nonprofit organization named Historic Gordonsville Inc. was formed. As of August 2013, the company owned a large number of properties downtown, including the Exchange Hotel. Their renovation and preservation efforts have helped maintain the historic commercial core of Gordonsville. House Bill 847 was passed by the Virginia Assembly in 1996, which amended Â§10.1-2212 of the Virginia Code to add Historic Gordonsville, Inc. to the listing of historical societies eligible to receive appropriations from the Virginia Department of Historical Resources.

=== Places of historical significance ===
The Gordonsville Historic District, Black Meadow, Exchange Hotel, and Rocklands are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic district and the Exchange Hotel are both within the town limits of Gordonsville; Black Meadow and Rocklands are nearby.

==Geography==
Gordonsville is located at (38.134628, -78.187068).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 0.9Â square miles (2.4Â km), all of which is land.

<text>King&#x27;s College, formally The King&#x27;s College of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas in Cambridge, is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. This college lies beside the River Cam and faces out onto King&#x27;s Parade in the centre of the city.

King&#x27;s was founded in 1441 by King Henry VI soon after founding its sister institution, Eton College. Initially, King&#x27;s accepted only students from Eton College. However, the king&#x27;s plans for King&#x27;s College were disrupted by the Wars of the Roses and the resultant scarcity of funds, and then his eventual deposition. Little progress was made on the project until 1508, when King Henry VII began to take an interest in the college, probably as a political move to legitimise his new position. The building of the college&#x27;s chapel began in 1446, and was finished in 1544 during the reign of Henry VIII.

King&#x27;s College Chapel is regarded as one of the finest examples of late English Gothic architecture. It has the world&#x27;s largest fan vault, while its stained-glass windows and wooden chancel screen are considered some of the finest from their era. The building is seen as emblematic of Cambridge. It houses the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Every year on Christmas Eve, the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols (a service originally devised for Truro Cathedral by Edward White Benson in 1880, adapted by the college dean Eric Milner-White in 1918) is broadcast from the chapel to millions of listeners worldwide.

== History ==
=== Foundation ===

On 12 February 1441, King Henry VI issued letters patent founding a college at Cambridge for a rector and 12 poor scholars. This college was to be named after Saint Nicholas upon whose feast day Henry had been born. The first stone of the college&#x27;s Old Court was laid by the King on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1441 on a site which lies directly north of the modern college and which was formerly a garden belonging to Trinity Hall. William Millington, a fellow of Clare College (then called Clare Hall) was installed as the rector.
Henry directed the publication of the college&#x27;s first governing statutes in 1443. His original modest plan for the college was abandoned, and provision was instead made for a community of 70 fellows and scholars headed by a provost. Henry had belatedly learned of William of Wykeham&#x27;s 1379 twin foundations of New College, Oxford and Winchester College, and wanted his own achievements to surpass those of Wykeham. The King had founded Eton College on 11 October 1440 but, up until 1443, King&#x27;s and Eton had been unconnected. However, that year the relationship between the two was remodelled upon Wykeham&#x27;s successful institutions and the original sizes of the colleges scaled up to surpass Wykeham&#x27;s. A second royal charter which re-founded the now much larger King&#x27;s College was issued on 12 July 1443. On 1 September 1444, the Provosts of King&#x27;s and Eton and the Wardens of Winchester and New College formally signed the &quot;Amicabilis Concordia&quot; (&quot;friendly agreement&quot;) in which they bound their colleges to support one another legally and financially.

Members of King&#x27;s were to be recruited entirely from Eton. Each year, the provost and two fellows travelled to Eton to impartially select the worthiest boys to fill any vacancies at the college, always maintaining the total number of scholars and fellows at exactly 70. Membership of King&#x27;s was a vocation for life. Scholars were eligible for election to the fellowship after three years of probation, irrespective of whether they had achieved a degree or not. Undergraduates at King&#x27;s â unlike those from other colleges â did not have to pass university examinations to achieve their BA degree and instead had only to satisfy the college. Every fellow was to study theology, save for two who were to study astronomy, two civil law, four canon law, and two medicine; all fellows save those studying secular subjects were obliged to take Holy Orders and become priests, on pain of expulsion. In 1445, a Papal Bull from Eugenius IV exempted college members from parish duties, and in 1457, an agreement between the provost and chancellor of the university limited the chancellor&#x27;s authority and gave the college full jurisdiction over internal matters.

=== Henry VI, Henry VII and Henry VIII ===
The original plans for Old Court were too small comfortably to accommodate the larger college community of the second foundation, and so in 1443 Henry VI began to purchase the land upon which the modern college now stands. The gateway and south range of Old Court had already been built, but the rest was completed in a temporary fashion to serve until the new court was ready. The new college site was itself left unfinished and the &quot;temporary&quot; Old Court buildings, arranged to accommodate 70, served as the permanent residential fabric of the college until the beginning of the 19th century. Henry&#x27;s grand design for the new college buildings survives in the 1448 &quot;Founder&#x27;s Will&quot;, which describes his vision in detail. The new college site was to be centred on a great courtyard, bordered on all sides by adjoining buildings: a chapel to the north; accommodation and the entrance gate to the east; further accommodation and the provost&#x27;s lodge to the south; and a library, hall and buttery to the west. Behind the hall and buttery was to be another courtyard, and behind the library a cloistered cemetery including a magnificent bell tower.
The first stone of the chapel was laid by the King on St James&#x27;s Day, 25 July 1446. The King encouraged support for the college. In 1448, John Conches, former prior of Wootton Wawen gave the priory&#x27;s lands to &quot;John Chedworth provost of the king&#x27;s college of St. Mary and St. Nicholas Cantebrigge and the scholars thereof, and to their successors.&quot; Within a decade Henry&#x27;s engagement in the Wars of the Roses meant that funds began to dry up. By the time of Henry&#x27;s deposition in 1461, the chapel walls had been raised 60Â ft high at the east end but only 8Â ft at the west; a building line which can still be seen today as the boundary between the lighter stone below and the darker above. Work proceeded sporadically until a generation later in 1508 when the Founder&#x27;s nephew Henry VII was prevailed upon to finish the shell of the building. The interior had to wait a further generation until completion by 1544 with the aid of Henry VIII. The chapel was the only part of Henry VI&#x27;s &quot;Founder&#x27;s Will&quot; to be realised.
It has been speculated that the choice of the college as a beneficiary by the two later Henrys was a political one, with Henry VII in particular concerned to legitimate a new, post-civil war Tudor regime by demonstrating patronage of what was by definition the King&#x27;s College. Later building work on the chapel is marked by an uninhibited branding with the Tudor rose and other symbols of the new establishment, quite against the precise instructions of the &quot;Founder&#x27;s Will&quot;.

=== Front Court completed ===

The college remained as the Old Court, chapel and a few small surrounding buildings for nearly two-hundred years until in 1724 the architect James Gibbs provided a new plan to complete the courtyard of which the chapel formed the north side. Although his design was for the courtyard to be closed by three similar detached Neoclassical buildings, due to lack of funds only the western of these was constructed. The first stone of what became known as the Gibbs&#x27; Building was laid by Provost Andrew Snape, at the time also vice-chancellor of the university, on 25 March 1723 and the building completed six years later.
Front Court was finally completed in 1828 under plans drawn up by William Wilkins. The courtyard was closed by a screen and gatehouse to the east; and residential staircases either side of a hall to the south. The southern buildings continued towards the river with a library and Provost&#x27;s lodge. All these buildings were, at the college&#x27;s insistence, built in the Gothic Revival style rather than Wilkins&#x27;s preferred Neoclassical.

With the courtyard to the south of the chapel now able to accommodate the college, the land to the north was sold to the university in 1828. This was the site of the world&#x27;s first bonsai tree, cultivated in King&#x27;s College in the mid 18th century. The university demolished most of the original Old Court buildings in order to make room for an extension to the University Library; only the gateway arch opposite Clare College survives. The library subsequently moved away from this site, known as the Old Schools, and the buildings are currently used for the main administrative offices of the university.

=== Victorian reforms and expansion ===

Under the provostship of Richard Okes, from 1850 until his death in 1888, the college began a period of reform. On 1 May 1851 it was agreed to abolish the privilege of King&#x27;s members to be granted a degree without passing the university examinations. In 1861 the college statutes were amended so as to expand the college and, more radically, to allow for the election of non-Etonian King&#x27;s members: the new statutes provided for 46 Fellows, 24 scholarships reserved for boys from Eton, and 24 &quot;open&quot; scholarships for boys from any school. At the same time all formal obligation to take Holy Orders â unenforced since the 17th century â was removed. The statutes were again amended in 1882, this time ensuring fellowships were not always for life and were awarded on merit after submissions of original research. In his 1930 memoir &quot;As We Were, A Victorian Peep Show&quot;, E. F. Benson, an alumnus of King&#x27;s, recollected the peculiar behaviour of some of the surviving Life Fellows from his undergraduate years of 1887â1890 and before. Of one he wrote, &quot;He then shuffled out on to the big lawn, with a stick in his hand, and he prodded with it at the worms in the grass, muttering to himself, &#x27;Ah, damn ye: ye haven&#x27;t got me yet.&#x27;&quot; The first non-Etonian students were admitted to study at King&#x27;s in 1865, and the first non-Etonian scholars and the first non-Etonian fellow were elected in 1873. These reforms continued over subsequent decades and there are now no special privileges for Etonians at King&#x27;s.
Expansion of the college through the 1861 statutes necessitated more building work to accommodate the larger community. In 1869, the area along King&#x27;s Parade between the Wilkins&#x27; Buildings and King&#x27;s Lane was built upon after a design by George Gilbert Scott. When completed a year later, the new courtyard formed was named after Walter Chetwynd, a fellow of the college. However, after subsequent plans to expand college accommodation fell through, King&#x27;s opened negotiations to amalgamate with St Catharine&#x27;s College. Although St Catharine&#x27;s had been founded by Robert Woodlark (sometimes spelled Wodelarke), a Provost of King&#x27;s, the college declined the invitation to combine. Eventually, in 1893, the east and south wings of another new courtyard within King&#x27;s â designed by George Frederick Bodley and overlooking the river â were completed.

=== 20th century ===

In 1909, the south range of a third new courtyard â named after its architect Aston Webb â was built to the south of the library. In 1927, designs by G.Â L.Â Kennedy completed Bodley&#x27;s Court with a new northern range, and Webb&#x27;s Court with a new Provost&#x27;s Lodge on its western side.

In 1930, a Cambridge Borough Police officer was shot by a student who also shot his tutor in the same incident.

On 1 September 1939, the day of the German invasion of Poland and the cause of the UK&#x27;s entrance into World War II, permission was sought from the College Council to remove the stained glass from the east window of the chapel. By the end of 1941, all the ancient glass had been removed to various cellars in Cambridge for safekeeping. Despite most of the windows of the chapel being covered over by sheets of tar-paper, which rattled loudly in the wind, the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols continued to be broadcast from the chapel every Christmas Eve throughout the war â even though the name of the college could not be broadcast for security reasons. King&#x27;s took the opportunity of these years to clean, repair and photograph the glass. By 1949, all the windows had been restored.
In 1961, the property millionaire Alfred Ernest Allnatt offered King&#x27;s the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens, which he had purchased in 1959 for a world-record price. The college accepted &quot;this munificent gift&quot; with the intention of displaying the painting in the chapel, possibly as an altarpiece. The painting was initially displayed in the antechapel but a significant faction of the fellowship â including Michael JaffÃ© and the Provost Noel Annan â were determined for the painting to become the focal point of an entirely redesigned east end planned by the architect Sir Martyn Beckett, who was &quot;philosophical about the furore this inevitably occasioned â which quickly became acceptance of a solution to a difficult problem.&quot;

As the first stage of this project, the Edwardian reredos and 17th-century wood panelling were removed and the Rubens installed in their stead behind the altar in April 1964. The painting was so big that the raised floor of the chapel&#x27;s east end, required by the 1448 &quot;Founder&#x27;s Will&quot;, would have to be levelled so as to prevent the baroque artwork obscuring the bottom of the Tudor east window. However 20 fellows and the honorary fellow E.Â M.Â Forster signed a letter urging the college to reverse its plan and &quot;admit that it has made a mistake&quot;; the levelling of the floor nevertheless went ahead. The newly refitted east end opened in 1968 and proved highly controversial, with the &quot;Architects&#x27; Journal&quot; criticising it as &quot;motivated not by the demands of liturgical worship but by those of museum display.&quot;

The last main-site building to be erected by the college was the Keynes Building, finished in 1967 and named after the former college bursar John Maynard Keynes. This building enclosed Chetwynd Court along with the Wilkins&#x27; and Scott&#x27;s buildings, and provided more than 70 en-suite accommodation rooms along with other facilities.

The first women students arrived at King&#x27;s in 1972, one of the first three previously all-male colleges to admit women.

The college, along with most others at the university, had been all-male since its foundation. However, under the provost Edmund Leach, King&#x27;s together with Churchill and Clare became the first three previously all-male colleges to admit women.

Henry VI is not completely forgotten at the college. The Saturday after the end of Michaelmas term each year is Founder&#x27;s Day, which begins with a Founder&#x27;s Eucharist in the chapel, followed by a Founder&#x27;s Breakfast with ale and culminating in a sumptuous dinner in his memory called &quot;Founder&#x27;s Feast&quot; to which all members of college in their third year of studies are invited.

== Buildings and grounds ==
=== Chapel ===
The College Chapel, an example of late Gothic architecture, was built over a period of a hundred years (1446â1531) in three stages. The Chapel features the world&#x27;s largest fan vault ceiling; 26 large stained-glass windows, 24 of which date from the 16th century; and Peter Paul Rubens&#x27;s painting the &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; as an altarpiece.

The chapel is actively used as a place of worship and also for some concerts and college events. The Chapel choir consists of organ scholars, choral scholars (male students from the college and other colleges) and choristers (boys educated at the nearby King&#x27;s College School). The choir sings services on most days in term-time, and also performs concerts and makes recordings and broadcasts. In particular, it has broadcast its Nine Lessons and Carols on the BBC from the Chapel on Christmas Eve for many decades. Additionally, there is a mixed-voice Chapel choir of male and female students, King&#x27;s Voices, which sings evensong on Mondays during term-time.

== Academic profile ==
The unofficial Tompkins Table comparing academic performance ranked King&#x27;s 12th out of a total of 29 rated colleges at the University of Cambridge in 2019. In terms of first-class degrees, King&#x27;s ranked 9th in the university with 31.3% of final year students achieving a first.

King&#x27;s offers all undergraduate courses available at the university, except for education, land economy and veterinary medicine, although Directors of Studies for Anglo-Saxon Norse &amp; Celtic and Management Studies visit from other colleges. With more than 100 fellows and some 420 undergraduate students, King&#x27;s has one of the highest ratios of fellows to students of all the Cambridge colleges.

Since its foundation, the college has housed a library, providing books for all students, covering all the subjects offered by King&#x27;s. Around 130,000 books are held: some available for teaching and for reference, others being rare books and manuscripts. The library operates a user-oriented purchasing policy: students and Directors of Studies recommend new purchases in their subject. There is both Wi-Fi and Ethernet internet access throughout the library as well as a library computer room. Special collections include a separate Music Library, the Keynes Library, a Global Warming collection, and an Audio Visual Library.

== Intake and access profile ==

The college has gradually broadened its intake to include many students from state schools, often having the highest proportion of maintained school acceptances of the undergraduate colleges. This has led to accusations of reactionary bias against public school pupils and of affirmative action (positive discrimination), although the relatively high proportion of state-school students reflects the far greater number of applications from pupils at maintained schools in comparison to other Cambridge colleges.

King&#x27;s has established a Schools Liaison Officer post in order to provide support to students, whatever their background, and schools and colleges of any type to find out more about the University of Cambridge and the college. King&#x27;s is the link Cambridge college for schools in North East England through Cambridge University Area Links Scheme.

Generally, the atmosphere at King&#x27;s is considered to be easier than that of other colleges to integrate into for students from a working-class or minority background. However, a survey conducted by Varsity Newspaper in January 2009 revealed that the average parental income of students who participated in the survey at King&#x27;s was higher than the university average.

In June 2018, Dr. Priyamvada Gopal alleged racial profiling by college porters at the gate of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Gopal said that she was subjected to racial profiling and aggression by the porters and gatekeepers of King&#x27;s and said porters frequently hassled non-white staff and students at the gates. While several students and staff corroborated her accusations, a King&#x27;s College spokeswoman denied wrongdoing by staff. As a result of the attention the issue received, Cambridge University students came forward describing similar experiences. Gopal said that she received hate mail following her announcement. Gopal announced that she would no longer supervise students at King&#x27;s until there was a resolution to the long-standing problem. Many students from Asian heritages have corrobated racial profiling by porters, who often mistake Asian students to be tourists.

== Student life ==
King&#x27;s has its own student unions, both for undergraduates (King&#x27;s College Student Union or KCSU) and for graduates (King&#x27;s College Graduate Society or KCGS). Students at King&#x27;s have used both organisations to assist in the decision-making processes in the college itself and the university. The college students have a reputation for radical political activity going back to the late 1960s, and the college has not infrequently been the centre of demonstrations, rent strikes and so forth, sparked by political events.

There are a number of rooms around college which students can book out to hold society events. Societies who commonly do this include King&#x27;s Politics, The Turing Maths Society, The History Society, The Marxist Society, Keynes Economics Society and King&#x27;s Feminist Society.

The main bar at King&#x27;s is the site of many social events, open mic nights, and informal meetings and debates between students, whilst a venue known as the Bunker (formerly the Cellar), a second bar in a basement of the college, acts occasionally as a music or dance-night venue and most recently the set for a King&#x27;s Drama productions including Sartre&#x27;s &quot;No Exit&quot; and a series of monologue showcase events. Even more recently, the Bunker has been used by the King&#x27;s Electronic Music Society, allowing students to learn how to DJ.

Whereas many Cambridge colleges celebrate May Week with a May Ball (which actually falls in June), since the early 1980s King&#x27;s has instead held a June Event (an informal version of a May Ball with fancy dress) known as The King&#x27;s Affair. This takes place annually on the Wednesday night of May Week (usually around 20 June), and is attended by around 1,500 students, occupying the Front Court, bar, Hall and Chapel. Past performers have included the Stranglers, Fatboy Slim, Noah and the Whale and, in 2009, Clean Bandit. There are also large student-run college parties at the end of each term known as Mingles.

=== Sports ===
King&#x27;s has a number of competitive and casual sports clubs. King&#x27;s College Boat Club has the largest active membership of any club in King&#x27;s. In 2013 the first men&#x27;s boat qualified to race in the Temple Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta. After several years of poor performances, the boat club has returned to success in the Lent and May Bumps, with blades being awarded four times in 2023, including twice to the first women&#x27;s VIII. Another major club is the King&#x27;s Mountaineering and Kayaking Association, which has a fleet of kayaks for use on the River Cam (which runs through the college) and regularly runs climbing, walking and kayaking trips for students of the college during university vacations. Its rugby team is joint with Corpus Christi and Clare colleges and consequently known as CCK. Its historic crest is the hallowed Elephant of Wisdom.

==Music==
King&#x27;s College is home to the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, which was founded in the 15th century and is now one of today&#x27;s most well-renowned representatives of the English choral tradition. In 2013, the choir launched its own label, King&#x27;s College Recordings, allowing it to gain more artistic freedom over its releases. Its releases and worldwide fame have led to global tours and performances. The Choir of King&#x27;s College sings evensong and Eucharist services on all days of the week apart from Mondays, with two services on a Sunday. It is currently led by the incumbent Director of Music, Daniel Hyde.

The other resident choir of the college is the mixed-voice choir King&#x27;s Voices, founded in October 1997 under Dr John Butt, with the intention of giving women in King&#x27;s the opportunity to sing in the chapel and be eligible for choral awards within the college. Currently, the choir sings evensong every Monday in university term, as well as performing at King&#x27;s College Music Society (KCMS) and college events throughout the year. King&#x27;s Voices has also appeared on albums alongside the Choir of King&#x27;s College, most recently in the Te Deum and Magnificat of the &quot;Collegium Regale&quot; service by Herbert Howells on a double album of music by Howells. Sopranos in King&#x27;s Voices also featured in a live recording of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Saint Nicolas&quot; alongside the BBC Singers and Britten Sinfonia as part of Sir Stephen Cleobury&#x27;s Farewell Concert, broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2019. The choir&#x27;s current director is Ben Parry, who is assistant director of Music at King&#x27;s.

== Entrepreneurship and business at King&#x27;s ==
In 2014, King&#x27;s College established an Entrepreneurship Prize opened to King&#x27;s College students with alumni as judges, including Hermann Hauser, and Stuart Lyons, the former chairman of Beales. In 2021, it launched the King&#x27;s Entrepreneurship Lab to &quot;support students with a future interest in innovation, entrepreneurship, and business&quot; co-directed by King&#x27;s fellows Kamiar Mohaddes and Thomas Roulet, who are faculty at the Cambridge Judge Business School. In 2022, it received an additional donation from the Gatsby Foundation to enlarge its scope.

The college has had a number of notable alumni in business, including Alfred Allen Booth, Phil Vincent, Nancy Zhang and famous innovators such as Charles Townshend.

== People associated with King&#x27;s ==

<text>Saltville is a town in Smyth and Washington counties in the U.S. state of Virginia. The population was 1,824 at the 2020 census. It is part of the KingsportâBristol (TN)âBristol (VA) Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is a component of the Johnson CityâKingsportâBristol, TN-VA Combined Statistical Area â commonly known as the &quot;Tri-Cities&quot; region.

==History==
Saltville was named for the salt marshes in the area. Prior to European settlement, these marshes attracted local wildlife. Excavations at the SV-2 archaeological site in the area have recovered several well preserved skeletons of now extinct species dating back to the last ice age. Indigenous peoples of varying cultures hunted at the marshes. The historic Native American people in the area were the Chisca.

Archaeologists in 1992 proposed the existence of a prehistoric &quot;Saltville Complex Petty Chiefdom&quot;, with a paramount village located at the Northwood High School site, 44SM8. They reported &quot;Saltville style gorgets&quot; as well as iron and copper materials, scattered across the region.

During the spring of 1567, Spanish conquistador Hernando Moyano de Morales led a force of 15-20 soldiers northward from Fort San Juan in Joara, a city in what is now western North Carolina. The force attacked and burned the Chisca village of Maniatique, which may have been located at or near the site of Saltville.

During the American Civil War, Saltville was one of the Confederacy&#x27;s main saltworks. The saltworks were considered vital to the Confederate war effort because the salt was used in preserving meat for Confederate soldiers and civilians. Because of its importance, the town was attacked by Northern forces intent on destroying the saltworks. On October 2, 1864, the First Battle of Saltville was fought there. In the battle Union forces attacked Saltville but were defeated by Confederate troops. Following the battle a number of wounded black troops were murdered in what was dubbed the &quot;Saltville Massacre.&quot; (Shortly after the war Champ Ferguson was tried, convicted, and executed for war crimes for this and other killings.)

Two months later General George Stoneman, a Union cavalry commander, led a second attack on the saltworks (known as the Second Battle of Saltville). This time the Confederates were defeated and the saltworks were destroyed by Union troops. The loss of the Saltville works was considered a major blow to the Confederacy&#x27;s dwindling resources.

Preston House, Saltville Battlefields Historic District, Saltville Historic District, and the Scott-Walker House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Hydrazine rocket fuel made by Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation&#x27;s plant in Saltville was used to power the rocket that took the first humans to the moon in the Apollo 11 mission.


===Muck Dam collapse===
Saltville was the location of the infamous &quot;Muck Dam&quot; break on December 24, 1924, which allowed the release of a huge volume of liquid chemical waste (stored there by the Mathieson Alkali Company) into the north fork of the Holston River taking the lives of nineteen people who lived along the river. The river remained polluted and virtually dead for several decades afterward.

<text>Woodland is a city in Clark and Cowlitz counties in Washington, United States. Most residents live within Cowlitz County, in which the majority of the city lies. It is part of the Longview, Washington Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 6,531 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
Named for its wooded setting by Christopher Columbus Bozarth, the community&#x27;s first merchant and postmaster, at the suggestion of his wife. Identically or similarly named unincorporated communities (without post offices) with the same name source exist in Pierce, Snohomish, Island, and Grays Harbor counties.

==History==
Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company retiree Adolphous Le Lewes (alternate spelling: Lewis) established a homestead at the mouth of what is today known as the Lewis River, in 1849 (The Lewis River is the namesake of A. Le Lewes, not Meriwether Lewis as is generally believed). Two Iowa families, related by marriage, came next: the Solomon Strongs filed a claim in September 1850 and the Squire Bozarths filed a claim in December of the same year. Bozarth built the first frame house in present-day Woodland and named it &quot;Woodland Farm House.&quot; Other early settlers include Columbia Lancaster, Milly Bozarth (wife of Squire), McKenzie and Jane Caples, and Brandt and Hans Kraft. After a few years, Christopher Columbus Bozarth (Better known as C.C., and the namesake for C.C. street in Woodland), a son of Squire Bozarth, opened a store and named it &quot;Woodland,&quot; after his father&#x27;s farm. Woodland eventually grew on the spot where the store was located.

Woodland was not the first trading center on the Lewis River bottoms. Pekin (now known as part of the Woodland Bottoms) deserves that credit. The Pekin store and Post Office was established in 1867 or 1868 by James Woods and F.H. Marsh. Pekin continued as the trading center until the Woodland store and Post Office were established. Woodland was more centrally located and on higher ground. Rarely did the June floods cover the streets of Woodland, but Pekin, built on stilts, was flooded nearly every June.

On March 26, 1856, the only recorded Indian attack occurred when some members of the Yakima tribe came down to burn out the settlers. Indian Zack, one of the few surviving Cowlitz tribe members, had already warned the settlers who evacuated to the Block House in St. Helens until the Yakimas returned to east of the Cascade Mountains. There was previously a monument to Indian Zack at a water fountain at Horseshoe Lake Park.

Woodland was platted by A.W. Scott on October 14, 1889, the same year that Washington gained statehood. The community officially incorporated as a city on March 27, 1906, and L. Hopf was the first mayor. In 1907, the first sewer system was begun, and the first telephone service contract was granted to Northwestern Telephone. At that time, there were daily stops by the steamers the &quot;Alarm&quot; and the &quot;Lucy Mason&quot;, as well as railroad service from Kalama to Portland. In 1913, the Lewis River bridge was built at Woodland. Prior to that time, there was only ferry service across the river. The present bridges where Interstate 5 crosses the Lewis, and the dike creating Horseshoe Lake were begun in 1940. In 1925, the Woodland Fire Department was organized and a fire station was erected. The first hotels and restaurants were built in the 1890s. The Woodland Grange now occupies the building that was the Hobb Hotel.

In 1948, Woodland experienced one of the greatest floods in its short history, with &quot;Old Town Woodland&quot; being one of the hardest-hit areas. Woodland experienced another great flood in 1996, which mostly affected the Northeast residential section of the city. President Bill Clinton visited the city during the flood of 1996, using the Woodland High School football field as a landing pad for his helicopter.

===Hulda Klager===
Woodland is perhaps best known as the home of Hulda Klager (1863â1960), who was a prolific breeder of lilacs. Known as the &quot;Lilac Lady,&quot; Klager (nÃ©e Thiel) was long the pride of Woodland. She immigrated from Germany to Wisconsin in 1865, when she was just two years old, and came West when her family bought a farm in Woodland. Later she married and settled down on the family farm. When a friend gave her a book about Luther Burbank, she began creating flowers, hybridizing new varieties of roses, dahlias, even apples, and lilacs in particular. By 1920 she had created such a magnificent array of new hand-pollinated lilacs that she opened her garden on Lilac Week every spring for visitors. The floodwaters of 1948 rolled over her garden, destroying every shrub and hand-pollinated lilac. The loss grieved those who visited her garden or who had purchased her lilacs. From all over the Northwest, people sent starts of her lilacs from their own gardens. By 1950, at the age of eighty-seven, Klager, who loved flowers and who had been honored by the state of Washington as well as such organizations as the nationally famous arboretum at Cambridge, Massachusetts, again opened her home for Lilac Week. After her death in 1960, the Woodland Federated Garden Club, shocked that the garden might be bulldozed for industry, succeeded in raising money to buy it and have it declared a state and national historic site.

In 1964, her house and lilac gardens were saved from being torn down to make room for an industrial site, and are currently maintained as a state and National Historic Landmark by the Lilac Society.

<text>Auburn is a city in King County, Washington, United States (with a small portion crossing into neighboring Pierce County). The population was 87,256 at the 2020 Census. Auburn is a suburb in the Seattle metropolitan area, and is currently ranked as the 15th most populous city in the state of Washington.

The Muckleshoot Indian Reservation lies to the south and southeast.

==History==

Before the first European arrived in the Green River Valley in the 1850s, the area was home to the Muckleshoot people, who were temporarily driven out by Indian wars later that decade. Several settler families arrived in the 1860s, including Levi Ballard, who set up a homestead between the Green and White rivers. Ballard filed for a plat to establish a town in February 1886, naming it Slaughter for an officer slain during the Indian wars in 1855.

Slaughter was incorporated on June 13, 1891, but its name was changed two years later to Auburn on February 21, 1893, by an action of the state legislature. Newer residents had disliked the name and its connection to the word &quot;&quot;, especially after the town&#x27;s hotel was named the Slaughter House. The name Auburn was chosen in honor of Auburn, New York, for the areas&#x27; shared reliance on hops farming.

The White and Green Rivers have been a major part of the history and culture of Auburn since the area was settled with multiple locations in the city being named after either of the two rivers. Frequent flooding from the rivers caused numerous problems for the people living in the community with one outcome being the creation of Mountain View Cemetery over on one of the hills overlooking the valley. It was not until the completion of the Mud Mountain Dam and the Howard A. Hanson Dam, along the White River and Green River respectively, that the flooding would cease and allow the city to grow without the aforementioned hurdle impeding the growth.

In 1917 the city, in response to the growing of the Japanese community, donated some of the land in Pioneer Cemetery to the White River Buddhist Church. A little over ten years later, Rev. Giryo Takemura, minister of the church at the time, and his future son-in-law, Chiyokichi Natsuhara, raised money to replace the old wooden sticks and columns that had been in use as gravestones at the Cemetery with more durable concrete markers. The interwar period saw several Japanese-American baseball teams from the area compete in the courier league with the White River All-Stars enjoying particularly large success winning four of the July 4th tournaments.
In 1930 a Japanese bath house was constructed outside of Neely Mansion by the then current tenants.

With the Attack on Pearl Harbor during the Second World War, Japanese immigrants and the Japanese-American community as a whole were largely seen with unwarranted distrust by the majority white population, including in Auburn. Executive Order 9066, issued by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, led to the city&#x27;s Japanese-American population being relocated to internment camps. After the war, of about 300 Japanese families living in Auburn only around twenty-five returned. In 1980, the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians found that this detainment was an unjust act in its report.

A local real estate developer announced plans for a large planned community in the hills southeast of Auburn in 1979, using of assembled plots. The neighborhood was named Lakeland Hills and began construction in 1985, growing to 80 homes in its first three years. Auburn and Bonney Lake competed to annex the entirety of Lakeland Hills in the late 1990s, with Auburn voting in 1997 to become the third King County city to annex portions of Pierce County. The two cities reached a compromise on water utility rights in the Pierce County portion of the neighborhood that allowed Auburn to complete its annexation of Lakeland Hills by the end of the decade. By 2007, the development had 3,600 homes with 6,000 residents, a new elementary school, and a shopping center.

In 2008, Auburn annexed the West Hill and Lea Hill neighborhoods of unincorporated King County, adding 15,000 residents and expanding its land area by 26 percent. A exclave of Kent, the Bridges neighborhood, was annexed by Auburn on January 1, 2024, after the two cities agreed to the transfer to simplify municipal services in the area. The neighborhood had originally been annexed by Kent in 1987 for use as a water reservoir, which was never built and instead developed into residential use. It was then surrounded by Lea Hill, later annexed into Auburn.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Two rivers, the White River and, to a greater extent, the Green River flow through Auburn.

Historically, the Stuck River ran through the settlement of Stuck, which is now a small pocket of unincorporated King County within southern Auburn. In 1906, the flow of the White River was diverted into the Stuck&#x27;s channel near today&#x27;s Game Farm Park.

References to the Stuck River still appear in some property legal descriptions and place names (e.g., Stuck River Drive) within Auburn, but today it is essentially indistinguishable from the southern White River.

Auburn has many large roads nearby and within city limits, including State Route 167 (commonly referred as the &quot;Valley Freeway&quot;) and State Route 18. Auburn also has its own transit center, Auburn station in downtown, that serves as a major hub for southern King County. Sound Transit buses connect the Auburn Transit Center directly to Federal Way, Sumner, and Kent, while King County Metro buses connect it to Green River Community College, the Super Mall, and Auburn Way.

Sounder commuter trains travel from Auburn to Downtown Seattle in approximately 30 minutes, and to Lakewood station in less than 35 minutes.

Until 1987, Auburn was home to a steam locomotive roundhouse and diesel engine house of the Northern Pacific Railway, the BNSF Railway of today. BNSF maintains a rail yard and small car repair facility, along with maintenance-of-way facilities at the former NP yard. The Auburn Municipal Airport serves the general aviation community.

===Police===
The Auburn Police Department is located within the Justice Building, along with the Municipal Court and jail.

<text>Bothell () is a city in King and Snohomish counties in the U.S. state of Washington. It is part of the Seattle metropolitan area, situated near the northeast end of Lake Washington in the Eastside region. It had a population of 48,161 residents as of the 2020 census.

The city lies along the Sammamish River, the historic home of the indigenous Sammamish people, and is adjacent to Kenmore and Woodinville. It was established in 1870 and platted by David Bothell and his family in 1888, shortly before the arrival of railroads in the area. The town was incorporated in 1909 and originally relied on logging and farming; in the mid-20th century, it became a bedroom community for workers commuting to Seattle and later other Eastside cities. Interstate 405 connects the city to other areas of the Eastside and functions as a bypass of Seattle.

Bothell&#x27;s modern economy is centered around biotechnology and high-tech companies that have facilities that were developed in the late 20th century along North Creek and in the Canyon Park neighborhood, which was annexed by the city in 1992. The annexation also expanded the city limits into Snohomish County. The University of Washington Bothell was established in 1990 and opened its permanent shared campus with Cascadia College in 2000. Bothell redeveloped its downtown in the 2010s and 2020s and has seen an increase in residential density and its population as a result.

==History==

The Sammamish River valley from Lake Washington to Issaquah Creek was first inhabited by the indigenous Sammamish people (), a Coast Salish group with an estimated population of 80 to 200 around 1850. The Sammamish had a major winter village, , at the mouth of the Sammamish River, between what is now Bothell and Kenmore. Although the Sammamish resisted removal efforts by settlers, they were eventually removed to Fort Kitsap following the 1855â1856 Puget Sound War. Some Sammamish continued to live in the area and worked as laborers and farmers, but the village of was later destroyed.

The first Homestead Act claims to modern-day Bothell were filed in 1870 by Columbus S. Greenleaf and George R. Wilson, an English immigrant, on adjoining plots of land. The area along the lower Sammamish River, then named Squak Slough, was mostly marshlands and had not been surveyed at the time of Wilson&#x27;s arrival; Greenleaf filed for his claim in June 1870 on land that Wilson had originally sought. Eight families settled in the area in the next six years and were followed by Canadian businessman George Brackett, who began commercial logging in 1877 on on the modern-day site of Wayne Golf Course. Brackett also established Brackett&#x27;s Landing, which had a sawmill and steamboat dock served by traffic from Seattle and Issaquah.

In 1884, Brackett sold of his timberland to David Bothell, a settler and American Civil War veteran from Pennsylvania. Bothell and his two sons built a home and shingle mill on the property the following year and later opened a boarding house with his wife. The boarding house was destroyed by a fire and replaced by the Bothell Hotel at another location, where the townsite was platted on April 25, 1888. The settlement was named for the Bothell family by the first postmaster Gerhard Ericksen, who had bought the boarding house property. At the time, the area had two hotels, several lumber mills, and a school. Bothell originally shared schools with Woodinville until a separate school district was established in 1885; the first classes at Bothell&#x27;s schoolhouse were held in March 1886. The school district was merged with North Creek in 1897 and ten years later, a dedicated school building was constructed to accommodate the growing student population.

The Seattle, Lake Shore and Eastern Railway was constructed along the Sammamish River to connect Seattle to the transcontinental Northern Pacific Railway as well as coal from mines near Issaquah. The tracks reached Bothell in November 1888 and a boxcar was placed at Brackett&#x27;s Landing to serve as a temporary station; it was moved east to Bothell in 1890 and later replaced by a depot building. A county road was built between Bothell and neighboring Woodinville to the east. Several logging railroads were also constructed in the Bothell area, stretching as far north as modern-day Canyon Park, to transport logs to local mills; one included a trestle bridge across the Sammamish River. Bothell grew rapidly following the railroad&#x27;s opening; by the end of the 1880s, it had telegraph service, a general store, a butcher, and a drugstore with a practicing doctor. Many of the new residents were Scandinavian or Eastern European immigrants, along with emigrants from the Midwest. The first churches in the area were established by these immigrants in the mid-1880s. Two of the local mills were destroyed in fires in 1893 and 1894 and were later replaced with a larger facility that produced 80,000 shingles per day.

===Early 20th century===

Bothell was incorporated as a fourth-class town on April 14, 1909, eight days after a narrow 79â70 vote in favor. George Bothell, one of the sons of David Bothell and a former state legislator, was elected as the first mayor. At the time, the town had a population of 599 residents, a bank, four general stores, and three saloons. A dozen buildings on Main Street were destroyed or damaged by a fire on April 11, 1911, including the Ericksen general store where the town&#x27;s records had been kept. A fire department was established in 1913 and new building regulations were enacted by the town government in response to the fire. The Pacific Highway was completed through the town in August 1912, connecting to Everett and Seattle. A section west of Bothell was the first to be paved in brick; it was inaugurated on May 29, 1913, by Washington governor Ernest Lister.

Steamship traffic on the Sammamish River waned after the arrival of the railroad and completion of the Pacific Highway. The river itself was dredged and straightened by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1916. The water level on Lake Washington was lowered by by the opening of the Lake Washington Ship Canal in Seattle the following year; the lowering prevented several steamships and other riverboats from traversing the mouth of the Sammamish River. By the end of the decade, Bothell had a water system, telephone service, a library, and several fraternal organizations with chapters or lodges in the area. The logging economy declined during the early 20th century and was replaced by agriculture on the cleared land, including dairy and poultry farms. Passenger traffic on the railroad, now under the management of Northern Pacific, ceased in 1938.

A new high school was opened in 1923 and followed by an adjacent junior high school building in 1931, now known as the Anderson School. Several civic projects were completed during the Great Depression by the Works Progress Administration, including construction of a new town hall that also housed the fire department and library when it opened in 1938. Bothell remained a rural community until the development of suburban housing areas after World War II as the Seattle metropolitan area experienced a major population boom. A new high school opened in 1953 along with five elementary schools by the end of the decade to accommodate a growing number of students. The first major annexations in the town&#x27;s history were made in 1954; by the end of the decade, the boundaries extended south of the Sammamish River.

===Mid-to-late 20th century===

Bothell was reclassified as a city in 1960 after its population had surpassed the state&#x27;s threshold for cityhoodâ1,500 residents. The city&#x27;s sewer system was completed that same year and the water system was switched from local wells to the Tolt pipeline, operated by Seattle Public Utilities, in 1963. The sewage system was incorporated into the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle system in 1967, which bypassed its outflow to Lake Washington but restricted new residential development south of the Sammamish River. Bothell developed further into a bedroom community after the completion of Interstate 405 in 1968, which passes east of downtown and intersects State Route 522. Another routing for the freeway west of the city was also considered before it was rejected, along with a later proposal to route State Route 522 on a freeway around the south side of downtown. By 1970, Bothell had annexed neighborhoods as far east as the outskirts of Woodinville, then seeking annexation or incorporation. The city&#x27;s mayorâcouncil government was replaced by a councilâmanager system in 1973 following voter approval of a proposition the year before.

In 1974, plans to build a regional shopping mall were announced on the site of a truck farm adjacent to the Interstate 405 and State Route 522 interchange east of downtown Bothell. It was described as similar in size to Southcenter Mall in Tukwila and would include a motel, two movie theaters, and office space. The city government sought the new shopping mall to improve its local tax base and approved a rezoning of the property for commercial use, but the proposal was opposed by local environmental groups due to the potential impact on North Creek, which flows through the site. The environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the city government over the rezoning, which the King County Superior Court found to violate state laws on land use fairness and conflicts of interest within the planning commission. The ruling was upheld by the Washington Supreme Court in 1978 and the property was instead rezoned into an office park under new regulations for the North Creek Valley, which was designated as a special district.

The remaining farmland in the North Creek Valley was developed into facilities for high tech and light industrial companies beginning in the 1980s, encompassing of office space. The developments were required by the special district to restore wetlands along North Creek and other waterways as part of environmental mitigation, but the artificial wetlands initially saw limited success in controlling invasive species and regulating soils. Bothell continued to develop into a center of high tech employment alongside Canyon Park, an unincorporated area to the north in Snohomish County, with a combined 4,300 jobs added between 1985 and 1987. Several office parks were also developed in nearby Woodinville, which Bothell unsuccessfully attempted to annex in 1985 for a shopping center; the community later incorporated as a separate city in 1993.

In 1990, the University of Washington opened its northern branch campus in Bothell at an office park building. A permanent campus, shared with Cascadia Community College, opened in September 2000 at a site that was originally proposed for a separate shopping mall east of downtown; the mall had been blocked by the Washington State Department of Ecology due to its effects on wetlands near North Creek. Bothell annexed the Canyon Park area in 1992, becoming a dual-county city and nearly doubling its population by adding 11,400 people. The annexation prevented the competing proposal for a new city, tentatively named North Creek, from claiming the area and its existing industrial parks that employed 20,000 people. The addition of Canyon Park and additional development increased Bothell&#x27;s population by 144Â percent to over 30,000 residents by 2000. The 1990s also saw more technology businesses relocate to Bothell, including biotechnology firms, call centers, and manufacturers of medical equipment and electronics.

===21st century===

The city government commissioned a plan in 2000 to address worsening traffic congestion throughout Bothell that was blamed, in part, on recent development. The plan would use additional street connections to form a more cohesive grid, but was negatively received by residents who opposed higher traffic volumes. A separate plan to widen portions of State Route 527 (the BothellâEverett Highway) was completed in 2005 using funding from commercial development along the corridor. In the late 2000s, the city government adopted a downtown plan to revitalize Main Street and add denser housing and mixed-use development in the area. The plan involved the acquisition of various parcels and demolition of 15 buildings to allow for roadwork and the expansion of the Park at Bothell Landing.

Construction of the $150Â million downtown redevelopment program began in 2010 with the realignment of State Route 522 at its intersection with the BothellâEverett Highway, which was completed in 2013. The BothellâEverett Highway was rebuilt as a wide boulevard in 2017 that includes separate laneways for parking and landscaped dividers. A new city hall opened in October 2015 to consolidate several city departments into one building. The city also annexed of King County in 2014 and added 6,000 residents. The downtown redevelopment yielded 1,300 new apartment units and townhouses by 2020, including middle housing. Between 2010 and 2020, Bothell&#x27;s population increased by more than 40Â percent and the share of minority residents also increased to 33Â percent.

A major fire in downtown broke out at the Mercantile Building on July 22, 2016, damaging and closing more than 20 businesses. Among the destroyed buildings was the Bothell Mall, which housed several small businesses. The fire hindered the Main Street portion of the redevelopment program and required $4.7Â million in state aid for rebuilding. Main Street was rebuilt as a shared space between vehicles and other modes with curbless sidewalks and parallel parking separated by dining areas and planter boxes. A one-block section was closed to all vehicular traffic in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic to encourage its use as an outdoor gathering space and dining area to revitalize business in downtown. The program was successful and became a permanent fixture during the summer months.

==Geography==

Bothell is located along the Sammamish River near its mouth at the northeast end of Lake Washington. It is one of six cities in Washington that are in multiple counties, as the city straddles King and Snohomish counties. The boundary between the counties is at Northeast 205th Street / 244th Street Southwest; because most streets in Bothell are numbered and not named, northâsouth streets that cross the county line often change numbers. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Bothell has a total area of , all of it classified as land. The city is predominantly suburban, with 41.4Â percent of land area zoned for single-family homes, 13Â percent for denser housing, 10.5Â percent for parks and open space, and 8Â percent for commercial development.

The city&#x27;s western border with Kenmore follows 86th and 84th avenues, with the exception of Inglemoor High School; within Snohomish County, the western border follows 7th Place West. The northern city limits of Bothell is defined by 216th Street Southwest on the west side of Interstate 405 and State Route 524 (Maltby Road) through Thrasher&#x27;s Corner. The eastern boundary follows 35th Avenue Southeast in Snohomish County; on the King County site, it is shared with Woodinville and follows 130th Avenue Northeast on the north side of the Sammamish River and 124th Avenue Northeast on the south side of the river. The southern border with Kirkland follows Simonds Road and Northeast 145th Street to Interstate 405 and jumps north to follow part of the Tolt pipeline right-of-way. The city&#x27;s urban growth area in Snohomish County includes unincorporated areas that border Brier to the west and Mill Creek to the north.

Most of the city lies in the drainage basins of the Sammamish River or its tributaries North Creek and Swamp Creek; a portion also lies in the Juanita Creek basin, which drains directly into Lake Washington. These creeks are also home to spawning Kokanee salmon, Chinook salmon, bull trout, and other freshwater fish. The Sammamish River formed following the retreat of the Cordilleran ice sheet during the Vashon Glaciation period approximately 15,000 years before present. The glaciers cut across several northâsouth channels that now form Bothell&#x27;s seven hills, which include areas south of the Sammamish River that are prone to landslides. The highest point in the city is Nike Hill, named for its former Nike missile silo, that sits above sea level. Bothell has several wetlands, including a area along North Creek that was restored by University of Washington Bothell in the 2000s. Since its restoration, the wetlands have become home to large groups of crows, up to 16,000 at a time, that commute from around the Seattle region to roost in Bothell. The university hosts an annual &quot;Crow Watch&quot; event in November with presentations and a viewing party.

The Bothell area is also home to several private schools, including those affiliated with local churches. Among them are campuses of the Cedar Park Christian School system, including a high school in Bothell; the Providence Classical Christian School, a Kâ12 school founded in 1997; and St. Brendan&#x27;s Catholic School, founded in 1966 and administered by the Archdiocese of Seattle. The Clearwater School, a Sudbury school with student-controlled learning; two Montessori schools; the Evergreen Academy; and the Washington Preparatory School are also located in and around Bothell.

===Higher education===

Bothell is home to two post-secondary educational institutions, Cascadia College and the University of Washington Bothell (UW Bothell), which share a single campus east of downtown near Interstate 405 and State Route 522. UW Bothell is one of three campuses of the University of Washington and serves 6,000 students , of which approximately 30Â percent reside in Snohomish County. Cascadia College, a two-year community college, had fewer than 3,000 enrolled students in 2019.

UW Bothell was established by the state government in 1989 alongside another branch campus in Tacoma to serve students who had graduated from two-year community colleges. Its first classes were held in October 1990 at a Canyon Park office building. At the same time, the state government approved plans to establish another community college on the Eastside to relieve overcrowding at colleges in Bellevue and Shoreline. The state government proposed replacing UW Bothell and the planned community college with a new four-year university in 1992, but opted instead to have both institutions share space on the intended site for the latter; the shared campus opened in September 2000. Further attempts to merge the institutions were rejected by students and the state government, who instead authorized an expansion of UW Bothell from an upper division school to a four-year institution beginning in 2006.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
Bothell lies at the intersection of Interstate 405, a major freeway bypass of Seattle, and State Route 522, which provides connections to Seattle and Monroe. Other highways in the city&#x27;s northern neighborhoods include State Route 524, which travels west to Lynnwood and east to Maltby; and State Route 527 (the BothellâEverett Highway), which connects Bothell to Mill Creek and Everett. Prior to the opening of the new Pacific Highway between Everett and Seattle in 1927, U.S. Route 99 was routed through Bothell on modern-day State Route 522 and State Route 527.

Public transportation within the city is provided by several operators that serve hubs at the University of Washington Bothell campus, Canyon Park Park and Ride on Interstate 405, and Downtown Bothell. King County Metro has local routes connecting Bothell to nearby cities, as well as express routes traveling to North Seattle and the main University of Washington campus. Sound Transit Express operates express routes from Bothell to Seattle&#x27;s Roosevelt station via State Route 522 and along Interstate 405 to Lynnwood and Downtown Bellevue. Community Transit primarily serves Snohomish County with connections at its Canyon Park hub, which is also the terminus of the Swift Green Line, a bus rapid transit line on State Route 527 that debuted in 2019. The agency&#x27;s routes connect Bothell to Lynnwood, Mill Creek, and Everett. These agencies, along with the Washington State Department of Transportation, also operate park-and-ride lots that have a total capacity of 965 vehicles.

As part of the Sound Transit 3 program, two Stride bus rapid transit lines are planned to be built through Bothell by 2029. The S2 Line will follow Interstate 405 between Lynnwood and Bellevue with stops at the University of Washington Bothell campus and Canyon Park when it opens in 2029; the S3 Line on State Route 522 between Shoreline South/148th station in Shoreline and Bothell will open in 2028 with stations in Downtown Bothell and at the University of Washington Bothell campus. An extension of the Swift Green Line from Canyon Park to Downtown Bothell and the UW Bothell campus is planned to open by 2031.

In July 2019, the city government launched its dockless electric scooter sharing program with Lime.

===Utilities===

The delivery of electric power to residents, businesses, and buildings in Bothell is split between two providers serving different sides of the KingâSnohomish county line. The Snohomish County Public Utility District provides electricity for the Snohomish County side of Bothell, along with the rest of the county; Puget Sound Energy provides electricity for the King County side and natural gas service for all of Bothell. The Bothell city government contracts with Recology for all curbside garbage, recycling, and yard waste collection and disposal. The company also has a store in Canyon Park that sells products made from recycled materials and accepts hazardous materials for recycling. Waste Management handles garbage and recycling collection outside of city limits and was also responsible for some annexed areas of Bothell until 2021.

Bothell has four water districts that provide tap water service within its city limits: the Alderwood Water and Wastewater District serving Canyon Park and the northern neighborhoods; the Bothell Water District serving Downtown Bothell and nearby neighborhoods; the Northshore Utility District serving western and southern Bothell; and the Woodinville Water District serving a small area in the city&#x27;s southeastern outskirts. Alderwood sources its water from Spada Lake in Snohomish County through the City of Everett; the other three districts purchase their water from Seattle Public Utilities, which sources its supply from the Tolt River watershed in King County. The water districts also manage the wastewater and sewage systems for their respective service areas, which are pumped to the Brightwater sewage treatment plant near Woodinville for treatment. The city government is also responsible for stormwater collection and treatment using a system of storm pipes that flow into catchment ponds and detention vaults.

===Healthcare===

The city&#x27;s nearest general hospital is EvergreenHealth Kirkland, a Level III trauma center located in the Totem Lake neighborhood of Kirkland. The King County portion of Bothell is part of the public hospital district that manages EvergreenHealth and elects one member to its board of commissioners. The northwestern outskirts of the city in Snohomish County are part of the Verdant Health Commission (Snohomish County Public Hospital District No. 2), which formerly operated Stevens Hospital (now Swedish Health Services Edmonds). Bothell is home to several small community and urgent care clinics operated by regional healthcare providers, including The Everett Clinic, HealthPoint, Indigo Health, Pacific Medical Centers, and ZoomCare. A clinic run by Public Health â Seattle &amp; King County in southern Bothell served over 4,200 annual clients until its closure in 2014.

<doc id="151276" wikidata="Q171136" url="?curid=151276" title="Joanna of Castile">
<text>Joanna of Castile (6 November 1479 â 12 April 1555), historically known as Joanna the Mad (), was the nominal queen of Castile from 1504 and queen of Aragon from 1516 to her death in 1555. She was the daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Joanna was married by arrangement to the Austrian archduke Philip the Handsome on 20 October 1496. Following the deaths of her elder brother John, elder sister Isabella, and nephew Miguel between 1497 and 1500, Joanna became the heir presumptive to the crowns of Castile and Aragon. When her mother died in 1504, she became queen of Castile. Her father proclaimed himself governor and administrator of Castile.

In 1506, Joanna&#x27;s husband Philip became king of Castile &quot;jure uxoris&quot; as Philip I, initiating the rule of the Habsburgs in the Spanish kingdoms. Philip died that same year. Despite being the ruling queen of Castile, Joanna had little effect on national policy during her reign as she was declared insane and confined in the Royal Palace in Tordesillas under the orders of her father, who ruled as regent until his death in 1516, when she inherited his kingdom as well. Her son Charles I became king, and during his reign Joanna was nominally co-monarch but remained confined until her death. Joanna died aged 75 in 1555, at which point her son Charles, the Holy Roman Emperor, became the sole ruler of Castile and Aragon.

==Early life==
Joanna was born on 6 November 1479 in the city of Toledo in the Kingdom of Castile. She was the fourth but third surviving child and the second daughter of Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, both members of the House of TrastÃ¡mara.

She had a fair complexion and brown eyes, and her hair colour was between strawberry-blonde and auburn, like her mother and her sister Catherine. Her siblings were Isabella, Queen of Portugal; John, Prince of Asturias; Maria, Queen of Portugal; and Catherine, Queen of England.

===Education===
Joanna was educated and formally trained for a significant marriage that, as a royal family alliance, would extend the kingdom&#x27;s power and security as well as its influence and peaceful relations with other ruling powers. As an &quot;Infanta&quot; (princess), she was not expected to be heiress to the throne of either Castile or Aragon, although through deaths she later inherited both thrones.

Joanna&#x27;s academic education consisted of canon and civil law, genealogy and heraldry, grammar, history, languages, mathematics, philosophy, reading, spelling and writing. Among the authors of classical literature she read were the Christian poets Juvencus and Prudentius, Church fathers Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, Saint Gregory, and Saint Jerome, and the Roman statesman Seneca.

In the Castilian court Joanna&#x27;s main tutors were the Dominican priest AndrÃ©s de Miranda; educator Beatriz Galindo, who was a member of the queen&#x27;s court; and her mother, the queen. Joanna&#x27;s royal education included court etiquette, dancing, drawing, equestrian skills, music, and the needle arts of embroidery, needlepoint, and sewing. She studied the Iberian Romance languages of Castilian, Leonese, Galician-Portuguese and Catalan, and became fluent in French and Latin. She learned outdoor pursuits such as hawking and hunting. She was skilled at dancing and music; she played the clavichord, the guitar, and the monochord.

===Marriage===

In 1496, 16-year-old Joanna was betrothed to 18-year-old Philip of Austria, in the Low Countries. Philip&#x27;s parents were Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and his first wife, Duchess Mary of Burgundy. The marriage was one of a set of family alliances between the Habsburgs and the TrastÃ¡maras designed to strengthen both against growing French power.

Joanna entered a proxy marriage at the Palacio de los Vivero in the city of Valladolid, Castile, where her parents had secretly married in 1469. In August 1496 Joanna left from the port of Laredo in northern Castile on the Atlantic&#x27;s Bay of Biscay. Except for 1506, when she saw her younger sister Catherine, the then-Dowager Princess of Wales, she would never see her siblings again.

Joanna began her journey to Brabant in the Low Countries, which consisted of parts of the present day Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and Germany, on 22 August 1496. The formal marriage took place on 20 October 1496 in Lier, north of present-day Brussels. Between 1498 and 1507, she gave birth to six children, two boys and four girls, all of whom grew up to be either emperors or queens.

===Princess of Asturias===
The death of Joanna&#x27;s brother John, the stillbirth of John&#x27;s daughter, and the deaths of Joanna&#x27;s older sister Isabella and Isabella&#x27;s son Miguel made Joanna heiress to the Spanish kingdoms. Her remaining siblings were Maria (1482â1517) and Catherine (1485â1536), younger than Joanna by three and six years respectively.

In 1502, the Castilian &quot;Cortes&quot; of Toro recognised Joanna as heiress to the Castilian throne and Philip as her consort. She was named Princess of Asturias, the title traditionally given to the heir of Castile. Also in 1502, the Aragonese &quot;Cortes&quot; gathered in Zaragoza to swear an oath to Joanna as heiress; however, the Archbishop of Zaragoza, Alonso de AragÃ³n expressed firmly that this oath could only establish jurisprudence by way of a formal agreement on the succession between the &quot;Cortes&quot; and the king.

In 1502, Philip, Joanna and a large part of their court traveled to Toledo for Joanna to receive fealty from the Cortes of Castile as Princess of Asturias, heiress to the Castilian throne, a journey chronicled in great detail by Antoon I van Lalaing (). Philip and the majority of the court returned to the Low Countries in the following year, leaving a pregnant Joanna in Madrid, where she gave birth to her fourth child, Ferdinand, later a central European monarch and Holy Roman Emperor as Ferdinand I.

==Reign==
===Queen of Castile===

====Succession====
Upon the death of her mother in November 1504, Joanna became queen regnant of Castile and her husband &quot;jure uxoris&quot; its king in 1506. Joanna&#x27;s father, Ferdinand II, lost his monarchical status in Castile although his wife&#x27;s will permitted him to govern in Joanna&#x27;s absence or, if Joanna was unwilling to rule herself, until Joanna&#x27;s heir reached the age of 20.

Ferdinand refused to accept this; he minted Castilian coins in the name of &quot;Ferdinand and Joanna, King and Queen of Castile, LeÃ³n and Aragon&quot;, and, in early 1505, persuaded the &quot;Cortes&quot; that Joanna&#x27;s &quot;illness is such that the said Queen DoÃ±a Joanna our Lady cannot govern&quot;. The &quot;Cortes&quot; then appointed Ferdinand as Joanna&#x27;s guardian and the kingdom&#x27;s administrator and governor.

Joanna&#x27;s husband, Philip, was unwilling to accept any threat to his chances of ruling Castile and also minted coins in the name of &quot;Philip and Joanna, King and Queen of Castile, LÃ©on and Archdukes of Austria, etc.&quot; In response, Ferdinand embarked upon a pro-French policy, marrying Germaine de Foix, niece of Louis XII of France (and his own great-niece), in the hope that she would produce a son to inherit Aragon and perhaps Castile.

In the Low Countries, Joanna was kept in confinement, but when her father-in-law Maximilian (in semi-secrecy) visited them on 24 August 1505 she was released to welcome him. Maximilian tried to comfort Joanna with festivities and she spent weeks accompanying him in public events, during which she acted like a wise, prudent queen, as noted by the Venetian ambassador. To entertain Joanna, Philip and Maximilian (who was dressed incognito) jousted against each other at night, under torchlight. Maximilian told Philip that he could only succeed as a monarch if husband and wife were &quot;una cosa medesima&quot; (one and the same). After this, the couple reconciled somewhat. When Philip tried to gain support from Castilian nobles and prelates against Ferdinand though, Joanna firmly refused to act against her father.

Ferdinand&#x27;s remarriage merely strengthened support for Philip and Joanna in Castile, and in late 1505 the pair decided to travel to Castile. Before they boarded the ship, Joanna forbade a ship with female attendants to join the trip, fearing that Philip would have illicit relationships with them. This action played right into Philip&#x27;s and Ferdinand&#x27;s propaganda against her. Leaving Flanders on 10 January 1506, their ships were wrecked on the English coast and the couple were guests of Henry, Prince of Wales (later Henry VIII), and Joanna&#x27;s sister Catherine of Aragon at Windsor Castle. They weren&#x27;t able to leave until 21 April, by which time civil war was looming in Castile.

Philip apparently considered landing in Andalusia and summoning the nobles to take up arms against Ferdinand in Aragon. Instead, he and Joanna landed at A CoruÃ±a on 26 April, whereupon the Castilian nobility abandoned Ferdinand en masse. Ferdinand met Philip at VillafÃ¡fila on 27 June 1506 for a private interview in the village church. To the general surprise, Ferdinand had unexpectedly handed over the government of Castile to his &quot;most beloved children&quot;, promising to retire to Aragon. Philip and Ferdinand then signed the Treaty of VillafÃ¡fila secretly, agreeing that Joanna&#x27;s &quot;infirmities and sufferings&quot; made her incapable of ruling and promising to exclude her from government and deprive the Queen of crown and freedom.

Ferdinand promptly repudiated the second agreement the same afternoon, declaring that Joanna should never be deprived of her rights as Queen Proprietress of Castile. A fortnight later, having come to no fresh agreement with Philip, and thus effectively retaining his right to interfere if he considered his daughter&#x27;s rights to have been infringed upon, he abandoned Castile for Aragon, leaving Philip to govern in Joanna&#x27;s stead.
====Philip&#x27;s death====
By virtue of the agreement of VillafÃ¡fila, the procurators of the &quot;Cortes&quot; met in Valladolid, Castile on 9 July 1506. On 12 July, they swore allegiance to Philip I and Joanna together as King and Queen of Castile and LeÃ³n and to their son Charles as their heir-apparent. This arrangement only lasted for a few months.

On 25 September 1506, Philip died after a five-day illness in the city of Burgos in Castile. The probable cause of death was typhoid fever but there were rumors that his father-in-law, Ferdinand II, had poisoned him. Joanna was pregnant with their sixth child, a daughter named Catherine (1507â1578), who later became Queen of Portugal.

By 20 December 1506, Joanna was in the village of Torquemada in Castile, attempting to exercise her rights to rule alone in her own name as Queen of Castile. The country fell into disorder. Her son and heir-apparent Charles, later Charles I, was a six-year-old child being raised in his aunt&#x27;s care in northern European Flanders; her father, Ferdinand II, remained in Aragon, allowing the crisis to grow.

A regency council under Archbishop Cisneros was set up, against the queen&#x27;s orders, but it was unable to manage the growing public disorder; plague and famine devastated the kingdom with supposedly half the population perishing of one or the other. The queen was unable to secure the funds required to assist her to protect her power. In the face of this, Ferdinand II returned to Castile in July 1507. His arrival coincided with a remission of the plague and famine, a development which quieted the instability and left an impression that his return had restored the health of the kingdom.

====Father&#x27;s regency====

Ferdinand II and Joanna met at Hornillos, Castile, on 30 July 1507. Ferdinand then constrained her to yield her power over the Kingdom of Castile and LeÃ³n to himself. On 17 August 1507, three members of the royal council were summoned â supposedly in her name â and ordered to inform the grandees of her father Ferdinand II&#x27;s return to power: &quot;That they should go to receive his highness and serve him as they would her person and more.&quot; However, she made it evident that this was against her will, by refusing to sign the instructions and issuing a statement that as queen regnant she did not endorse the surrender of her own royal powers.

Nonetheless, she was thereafter queen in name only, and all documents, though issued in her name, were signed with Ferdinand&#x27;s signature, &quot;I the King&quot;. He was named administrator of the kingdom by the &quot;Cortes&quot; of Castile in 1510, and entrusted the government mainly to Archbishop Cisneros. He had Joanna confined in the Royal Palace in Tordesillas, near Valladolid in Castile, in February 1509 after having dismissed all of her faithful servants and having appointed a small retinue accountable to him alone. At this time, some accounts claim that she was insane or &quot;mad&quot;, and that she took her husband&#x27;s corpse with her to Tordesillas to keep it close to her.

====Son as co-monarch====
As a result of the death of her father, Ferdinand II, on 23 January 1516, Joanna became Queen of Aragon. Cisneros and the regency council hid the news of her father&#x27;s death from her, pretending he still lived and ruled. Her then-17-year-old son Charles arrived in Asturias at the Bay of Biscay in October 1517. Until his arrival, the Crown of Aragon was governed by Archbishop Alonso de AragÃ³n (an illegitimate son of Ferdinand) and her Crown of Castile was governed by Cardinal Francisco JimÃ©nez de Cisneros. On 4 November, Charles and his sister Eleanor met their mother Joanna at Tordesillas â there they secured from her the necessary authorisation to allow Charles to rule as her co-King of Castile and LeÃ³n and of Aragon. Despite her acquiescence to his wishes, her confinement would continue and Charles expanded the deceptions surrounding her, later hiding the 1519 death of Emperor Maximilian from her. The Castilian &quot;Cortes&quot;, meeting in Valladolid, spited Charles by addressing him only as &quot;Su Alteza&quot; (&quot;Your Highness&quot;) and reserving &quot;Majestad&quot; (&quot;Majesty&quot;) for Joanna. However, no one seriously considered rule by Joanna a realistic proposition.

In 1519, Charles I ruled the Crown of Aragon and its territories and the Crown of Castile and its territories, in personal union. In addition, that same year Charles was elected Holy Roman Emperor. The kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (and Navarre) remained in personal union until their jurisdictional unification in the early 18th century by the Nueva Planta decrees, while Charles eventually abdicated as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in favour of his brother Ferdinand, and as King of Spain in favour of his son Philip â an act that represented the &quot;transition from a universal empire to defence of the interests of the &#x27;Austrian family&#x27; (austriacismo), in other words, to a close alliance between two parts of the dynasty, aimed at guaranteeing the hegemony of Catholicism and of the dynasty within Europe&quot;.

====Revolt of the Comuneros====
In 1520, the Revolt of the Comuneros broke out in response to the perceived foreign Habsburg influence over Castile through Charles V. The rebel leaders demanded that Castile be governed in accordance with the supposed practices of the Catholic Monarchs. In an attempt to legitimise their rebellion, the Comuneros turned to Joanna. As the sovereign monarch, had she given written approval to the rebellion, it would have been legalised and would have triumphed.

In an attempt to prevent this, Don Antonio de Rojas Manrique, Bishop of Mallorca, led a delegation of royal councillors to Tordesillas, asking Joanna to sign a document denouncing the Comuneros. She demurred, requesting that he present her specific provisions. Before this could be done, the Comuneros in turn stormed the virtually undefended city and requested her support.

The request prompted Adrian of Utrecht, the regent appointed by Charles V, to declare that Charles would lose Castile if she granted her support. Although she was sympathetic to the Comuneros, she was persuaded by Ochoa de Landa and her confessor Fray John of Ãvila that supporting the revolt would irreparably damage the country and her son&#x27;s kingship, and she therefore refused to sign a document granting her support. The Battle of Villalar confirmed that Charles would prevail over the revolt.

====Forced confinement====
Charles ensured his domination and throne by having his mother confined for the rest of her life in the now-demolished Royal Palace in Tordesillas, Castile. Joanna&#x27;s condition degenerated further. She apparently became convinced that some of the nuns that took care of her wanted to kill her. Reportedly it was difficult for her to eat, sleep, bathe, or change her clothes. Charles wrote to her caretakers: &quot;It seems to me that the best and most suitable thing for you to do is to make sure that no person speaks with Her Majesty, for no good could come from it&quot;.

Her late mother&#x27;s lady-in-waiting, Catalina de Medrano y Bravo de Lagunas, along with her husband, Hernando de Sandoval y Rojas, took part in the custody and care of Joanna in Tordesillas. Joanna also had her youngest daughter, Catherine of Austria, with her during Ferdinand II&#x27;s time as regent, 1507â1516. Her older daughter, Eleanor of Austria, had created a semblance of a household within the palace rooms. In her final years, Joanna&#x27;s physical state began to decline rapidly, with mobility ever more difficult.

== Death ==
Joanna died on Good Friday, 12 April 1555, at the age of 75 in the Royal Palace at Tordesillas. She is entombed in the Royal Chapel of Granada in Spain, alongside her parents, Isabella I and Ferdinand II, her husband Philip I and her nephew Miguel da Paz, Prince of Asturias.

==Disputed mental health claims==
As a young woman, Joanna was known to be highly intelligent. Claims regarding her as &quot;mad&quot; are widely disputed. It was only after her marriage that the first suspicions of mental illness arose. Some historians believe she may have had melancholia, a depressive disorder, a psychosis, or a case of inherited schizophrenia. She may also have been unjustly painted as &quot;mad&quot; as her husband Philip the Handsome and her father, Ferdinand, had a great deal to gain from Joanna being declared sick or incompetent to rule.

The narrative of her purported mental illness is perpetuated in stories of the mental illness of her maternal grandmother, Isabella of Portugal, Queen of Castile, who, in widowhood, was exiled by her stepson to the castle of ArÃ©valo in Ãvila, Castile.

==Legacy==

Bethany Aram argues that while she seemed to be unable or unwilling to rule herself, Joanna&#x27;s major (political) significance lay with her defense of the rights of her descendants and thus the Habsburg dynasty. While she did have affection for Philip, her refusal to bury her husband (and attempt to bring his corpse to Granada so that he would lie beside her mother) was likely an attempt to ward off suitors and create a connection between Charles and Castile. Facing the leaders of the Comunero Revolt, she again chose the Habsburg dynasty over her Castilian heritage. Her fecundity provided Charles with many Habsburg siblings (and by extensions, these siblings&#x27; children) who upheld his rule. Sara T. Nalle agrees with Aram that this was Joanna&#x27;s major success, while pointing out that Aram seems to gloss over the fact that Joanna&#x27;s contemporaries did see her as different. Nalle opines that overall, Joanna was a troubled individual who, not trained for the political world, found herself surrounded by strong personalities, and had to face a shocking amount of cruelty and deceit.

<doc id="151277" wikidata="Q1018225" url="?curid=151277" title="St Neots">
<text>St Neots is a town and civil parish in the Huntingdonshire district of Cambridgeshire, England. It is west of Cambridge. The areas of Eynesbury, Eaton Ford, Eaton Socon, and Wintringham form part of the town.

The town centre lies on the eastern bank of the River Great Ouse. The town is close to the A1 road (north-south), as well as the A421 and A428 roads which link Cambridge to Bedford and Milton Keynes. St Neots railway station is on the Great Northern route between London and Peterborough. St Neots had a population of 33,410 in 2021.

==Toponymy==
The town is named after the ninth century monk Saint Neot, whose bones were brought to St Neots Priory from Cornwall in around 980AD, resulting in pilgrims visiting in large numbers. Before the founding of the priory the area had been part of the parish of Eynesbury. As the town around the priory grew it became a separate parish of St Neots in the twelfth century. The two were administratively reunited in 1876 when Eynesbury was absorbed into St Neots.

==History==
===Early history===
Remains of Iron Age settlement have been found in the town centre; a Roman encampment was located in the town. It became known as Eynesbury, after Ernulf, a local leader.

Neot was a holy man who founded a monastery near the present-day Cornish village of St Neot. When he died, his remains were kept there as holy relics, and many pilgrims visited, making donations. In the later tenth century a priory was established immediately north of the village of Eynesbury in what is now St Neots. The landowners, Leofric and his wife Leoflaed, obtained Neot&#x27;s remains (leaving an arm in Cornwall), realising that they would attract pilgrims, and their money, to their priory. This was successful, and the priory became rich and famous, and the area became known as St Neots. St Neots subsequently became a separate parish from Eynesbury sometime between 1113 and 1204, with the boundary between them being a stream called Hen Brook.

About this time, the settlement to the west of the River Ouse was known as Ea-tun, meaning &quot;waterside village&quot;. In Norman times, a sub-division of a Baron&#x27;s area of control was called a &quot;soke&quot; and in French the area was called the Soka de Eton, and later Eaton Socon. Before the river was bridged, people waded across it, and this was called a &quot;ford&quot;, from which the immediate area became called Eaton Ford.

The Priory was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century, and the relics of St Neot were lost.

The River Great Ouse was made navigable from St Ives to Bedford, via St Neots, in 1629, increasing river-borne trade in the town.
The Second English Civil War began in April 1648. The Parliamentarians under Oliver Cromwell were in control, but King Charles I planned to overthrow them by force of arms. An attempt to seize London by his supporters, the Royalists, failed. A group of them retreated to St Neots and planned to spend the night of 9 July resting in the town. In the small hours of 10 July Parliamentary troops attacked, taking them by surprise, and the battle centred on the market square area. Many Royalists were killed or taken prisoner.

In the 18th and 19th centuries the town enjoyed prosperity through corn milling and brewing, and from stagecoach traffic and from 1850 its railway connection. Eaton Socon was on the Great North Road and had inns used as a staging post and overnight stop for stagecoaches travelling between London and York; some of the routes ran via St Neots instead of Eaton Socon, and intersected with traffic on the eastâwest route from the Eastern Counties and the Midlands.

Between 1851 and 1885 George Bower&#x27;s &quot;Vulcan Iron Foundry&quot; was a major employer, supplying equipment for gasworks throughout the British Isles and worldwide.

===1900 onwards===
Eaton Ford and Eaton Socon, lying on the west side of the River Great Ouse, were formerly within Bedfordshire, but in 1965 they were incorporated into the urban district of St Neots.

Technology-based industries operate in some of the town&#x27;s light industrial estates, and there is Little Barford Power Station neighbouring the town. 

Recent developments in St Neots have expanded the population in the last few years: to the east of the local train station are the developments of Love&#x27;s Farm, with more than 1,000 houses being built in the late 2010s and early 2020s. There is more to Love&#x27;s Farm, as the second phase, to the south of phase 1, is Wintringham, planned to be a vibrant community with 2,000 homes, and there is a selection of two primary schools: Wintringham Primary Academy and the Roundhouse Community Primary School. Into the east of Love&#x27;s Farm, there are developments to upgrade Cambridge Road (B1428) between the A428 junction and the Bret Road junction at Wintringham. This will support the eastern expansion of St Neots, and make way for Monkfields, the next development and Phase 3 of Love&#x27;s Farm. L&amp;Q Estates, the developers of Monkfields, have stated that construction work on site is expected to begin in spring 2024 with roads and infrastructure, hence Cambridge Road, and the first homes expected to be completed in 2026.

==Culture and community==
St Neots Museum is housed in the town&#x27;s former Victorian Police Station and Magistrates Court. It has local history collections covering the town&#x27;s rich past including a display about James Toller, the Eynesbury Giant, a resident from the 18th century who measured over 8Â ft in height. There is also a gallery with temporary exhibitions by local creatives including fine art, ceramics, sculpture and illustration. The museum organises a variety of specialist and family events from walks, talks, one-day festivals, temporary and touring exhibitions.

St Neots general market is held on the market square every Thursday. A further farmers market is held on the market square every second and fourth Saturday.

The theatre community includes the Riverside Theatre Company, who stage productions, run workshops and have groups for all ages; VAMPS formed in 1961 as the St Neots and District Operatic Society and stage popular musicals and variety shows; St Neots Players, formed in the late 1920s as a play-reading group with past members who used to perform the annual Shakespeare, Pantomime and other mid-season productions at the Kings Head Hotel in the Stables Theatre; and Stageworks, a performing arts group offering classes, holiday programmes, workshops and a college offering full-time training to students aged 16 years and over that prepares students for musical theatre and acting, SJ School of Dance, Pocket Productions, and Peppercorns Academy.

The local creative community is served by Neotists, a community interest company for creative professionals with members covering design, illustration, art, photography and IT, which commissions local creatives to collaborate on projects, run workshops and events for the community and provide opportunities and connections for professionals working in the creative industry.
In 2023, the Neotists organised the St Neots Festival, a music and performing arts festival in Priory Park.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering St Neots, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: St Neots Town Council, Huntingdonshire District Council and Cambridgeshire County Council. The district and county councils also form part of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

The town council is based at the Priory Centre, on the banks of the River Great Ouse. The council consists of 21 elected councillors including a town mayor and a deputy town mayor. With a budget (2020â2021) of Â£1.8 million, its operations cover cemeteries and &quot;closed&quot; churchyards (those that are full), public conveniences, allotments, play areas, bus shelters in rural locations, and some residual footway lighting (but not street lighting).

===Administrative history===
The historic parish of St Neots was governed by its vestry, in the same way as most rural areas, until 1819 when the more built-up part of the parish was given improvement commissioners. In 1876 the commissioners&#x27; district was reconstituted as a local government district run by an elected local board. The district was enlarged at the same time to also include part of the neighbouring parish of Eynesbury, including the old village itself.

Such local government districts were in turn reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. That act also said that parishes could no longer straddle district boundaries, and so in 1895 the two parishes of St Neots and Eynesbury were both reduced to just cover the parts within the St Neots Urban District. The part of St Neots parish outside the urban district became a parish called St Neots Rural, and the part of Eynesbury outside the urban district became a parish called Eynesbury Hardwicke.
In 1938 the urban district council bought a large early 19th century house called Cressner (or Cressener) House at 12 Huntingdon Street and converted it to become its offices and meeting place. The urban district was enlarged in 1965 to take in part of the parish of Eaton Socon from Bedfordshire, including the old village of Eaton Socon and the Eaton Ford area, which by that time were effectively part of the built-up area of the town.

St Neots Urban District was abolished in 1974, with district-level functions transferring to the new Huntingdon District Council (later renamed Huntingdonshire District Council). A successor parish was created covering the area of the former urban district. The parish council declared the parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot; and appoint a mayor. In 1989 the town council moved to new offices in an extension to the Priory Centre. The parishes of St Neots Rural and Eynesbury Hardwicke were both abolished in 2010 and divided between St Neots and Abbotsley.

===Parliamentary constituency===
St Neots is in the parliamentary constituency of St Neots and Mid Cambridgeshire. The member of parliament is Ian Sollom of the Liberal Democrats.
Prior to the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, St Neots was part of Huntingdon constituency.

==Housing and town management==

St Neots experienced considerable growth in the 1960s and later, when much new housing was built to accommodate families from London, as part of the London overspill plan. Further housebuilding followed and in 2010, the Loves Farm development was built, with 1,400 houses to the east of the railway line; further construction is continuing further east in 2020â2023, followed by a further 2,800 houses in 2021 in the nearby Wintringham development. Expansion of light industry facilities was incorporated in the original overspill planning, and has also been continued more recently.
The population of St Neots in 2011 was 31,165; in 2021 it was around 33,000. This figure is expected to rise further still in the coming decade. St Neots&#x27; position as a traditional town location, with plentiful industrial sites and good transport facilities encourages this expansion. The Loves Farm estate will be extended eastwards, and the Wintringham Estate is under construction, and will infill a substantial part of the space between Cambridge Road and the by-pass.

The town is to benefit from the Government Future High Streets Fund. Huntingdonshire District Council will manage the expenditure of Â£12.8million.

==Sport and leisure==
St Neots has a semi-professional non-League football team, St Neots Town F.C., who play at Rowley Park Stadium. The club are currently members of the Southern Football League Division 1 Central.

The town also has a rugby club St Neots RUFC, a rowing club St Neots Rowing Club, two Dragon Boat teams and a table tennis club, the St Neots Table Tennis club.

Huntingdonshire District Council operates a leisure centre complex in Eynesbury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, squash courts, sports hall, tennis courts, all weather pitches, creche, and cafe. The site is part of the council&#x27;s &#x27;One Leisure&#x27; brand, which has other sites in Huntingdon and St Ives.

The Great Ouse river passes through the centre of the town, through Regatta Meadows and Riverside Park and linking to Eaton Socon providing opportunities for riverside leisure walks, and forms part of the Ouse Valley Way walking route.

Riverside Park is close to the town centre and covers with a beautiful mile-long waterside frontage. The park has a cafe, parking for 250 cars, a large children&#x27;s activity area, a skate park, and a miniature railway, Riverside Miniature Railway. During the summer concerts are occasionally held on Sunday afternoons in the park.

Barford Road Pocket Park in Eynesbury, hosts weekly parkrun and junior parkrun events.

To the north of the town is Paxton Pits Nature Reserve providing walks through its of lakes, meadow, grassland, scrub and woodland. The reserve is famous for its nightingales and cormorants and is home to a wide variety of other birds, insects, mammals and flora.

The Rowley Arts Centre was opened in May 2014 and includes a six-screen cinema operated by Cineworld and a complex with three restaurants and a gym. It was named after Peter Rowley, an American playwright, author and critic who was Lord of the Manor of St Neots and who donated Â£1million towards the development from the profit he made from selling the land on which the Love&#x27;s Farm development was built. The complex was subsequently purchased as an investment by Huntingdonshire District Council for Â£7.6 million in 2019.

St Neots has a ten pin bowling centre with 16 lanes, which was built on part of the site of the outdoor swimming pool that closed in 2003. Originally the intention for the remainder of the site was to build a new outdoor pool, but these plans were not realised. Discussions are ongoing about the creation of a splash park on the remaining part of the site

There are two golf courses: St Neots Golf Club and Wyboston Lakes.

==Parish church==
St Neots parish church is dedicated to St Mary.

The late 12th-century parish church was almost completely rebuilt in the 15th century, making it one of the largest and grandest medieval churches in modern Cambridgeshire. In the 19th century, it was provided with a high quality set of stained glass windows depicting the life of Jesus Christ. It is considered to be a very fine building, and has been called the Cathedral of Huntingdonshire.

Writing originally in 1958 before the enlargement of the town and the reconstruction of the bridge, John Betjeman said:

The good small market community has a medieval bridge over the Ouse and a well-proportioned Market Square, but the church is tucked away on the fringe of the town. It is almost everything a good town church should be: a luxurious Perpendicular building with perhaps the finest tower in the county, faced in ironstone and pebbles with ashlar dressings â an agreeable contrast in colour and texture. The roof is almost flat â although not over-elaborate it is very English and most satisfying. There are several Perpendicular screens.

==Media==
Regional local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio East, Star Radio, HCR FM and Black Cat Radio, a community based radio station.

The &quot;Hunts Post&quot; is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Transport==

===Rail===

St Neots railway station is served by generally half-hourly trains north to Peterborough and south to Horsham via London St Pancras and Gatwick Airport, with additional peak time commuter services in the mornings and evenings to and from London King&#x27;s Cross. Journeys are typically around 45 minutes to London King&#x27;s Cross, 55 minutes to St Pancras, and a little under two hours to Gatwick Airport.

St Neots was the 423rd busiest station in the UK in 2018â19 (out of 2560) with 1.3 million journeys beginning or ending there.

St Neots station footbridge has access to the car park and taxi rank on the west side, and the district of Love&#x27;s Farm on the east side. There are lifts to the platforms.

East West Rail is a plan to establish a railway between Oxford and Cambridge. Construction is underway on the western section between Oxford and Bedford. The company&#x27;s preferred route between Bedford and Cambridge has been announced, which includes a station at Tempsford south of St Neots, where the new line and the existing East Coast Main Line will intersect.

===Road===

St Neots lies adjacent to the A1 trunk road which links the town by road with London and the northeast of England and Scotland. The town is also linked with Cambridge to the east by the A428 road and Bedford and Milton Keynes by the A421 road at Black Cat roundabout on the A1 just south of the town.

Six miles to the north the A14 trunk road provides westward and eastward access to the Midlands and East Anglia respectively.

Historically the Great North road which forms the A1 passed through Eaton Socon until new alignment of the A1 road, forming a bypass, opened in 1971.

The A45 road between Bedford and Cambridge passed through the town centre until the St Neots Bypass opened in December 1985 (subsequently re-designated as the A428). There is major scheme for a new road connecting the Black Cat roundabout and the A428 at Caxton Gibbet, avoiding St Neots completely. A Â£507million contract has been awarded to Skanska for the construction.

===Bus===
St Neots is served by the Stagecoach 905 service which operates between Bedford Bus Station and Cambridge Parkside on a typically half-hourly basis.

Whippet Bus Company operates a 61/63 circular service between the town centre, Eaton Ford, Eaton Socon, Eynesbury, and the railway station, on a typically hourly frequency with some additional journeys, six days a week. As of October 2022, Whippet Bus Company operate a 66 bus service between St Neots and Huntingdon, Godmanchester and Fenstanton.

===Air===
St Neots is within an hour&#x27;s drive from London Luton Airport and London Stansted Airport, and has a direct train service to London Gatwick Airport.

===Cycling===
St Neots is on Route 12 of the Sustrans national cycle route that connects Colchester and Oxford via Harwich, Felixstowe, Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Sandy, Bedford and Milton Keynes.
A foot and cycle bridge across the River Great Ouse was opened in 2011, linking Eaton Socon and Eynesbury, enabling pupils attending Ernulf Academy to avoid cycling through the town centre and improving connections to existing cycle paths. The scheme was a Sustrans Connect2 project, and supported by Cambridgeshire County Council and Huntingdonshire District Council.

==Geography==
St Neots is just over 49 miles north of Charing Cross, London. It is close to the south-western boundary of Huntingdonshire District, and the northern boundary of Bedfordshire. Both the city of Cambridge about east and Bedford about southwest) are nearby. The city of Milton Keynes is to the west and Peterborough is to the north. The A428 road makes the boundary with Little Barford and Northern Bedfordshire, and the Paxton Bridge makes it impeccably easy driving to Little Paxton and makes the shortest separation from the 2 parishes, apart from the very busy A1.

St Neots lies in the valley of the River Great Ouse, partly on the flood plain and partly on slightly higher ground a little further from the water. The Great Ouse is a mature river, once wide and shallow but now controlled by weirs and sluices and usually constrained in a well-defined channel.
Tributaries entering the Great Ouse in the town are the River Kym, Hen Brook, Duloe Brook and Colmworth Brook. The area is generally low-lying. Riverside Park, an amenity adjacent to St Neots Bridge, remains set aside as a flood-meadow, subject to flood, protecting dwellings and commercial property from a swollen reach.

St Neots developed at the site of a ford where overland routes converged. This was replaced by a medieval bridge, and today there are two further crossings just outside the town, one to the north and another to the south.

The soil is mainly light, overlying gravel beds â gravel extraction is a local industry. Older disused gravel pits, such as the nearby Paxton Pits and Wyboston Leisure Park, have been converted to nature reserves and amenity areas. Away from the river, the higher land is mainly a heavy clay soil with few large settlements. Much of the land is used for arable farming.

===Climate===
The climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe. Eastern areas of the United Kingdom, such as East Anglia, are drier, cooler, less windy and also experience the greatest daily and seasonal temperature variations. Protected from the cool onshore coastal breezes, Cambridgeshire is warm in summer and cold and frosty in winter.

Highest daytime temperature in 2020 was 22Â Â°C and lowest 5Â Â°C; corresponding night-time temperatures were 15Â Â°C and â1Â Â°C. Rainfall in 2020 varied between 21 and 41Â mm per month, with more rain in the summer months; there was some snowfall in December 2020 and January and April 2021.

== International relations ==

St Neots is twinned with Faches-Thumesnil, Nord, Hauts-de-France

==Notable residents==

<text>Enumclaw ( ) is a city in King County, Washington, United States. The population was 12,543 at the 2020 census.

The Enumclaw Plateau, on which the city resides, was formed by a volcanic mudflow (lahar) from Mount Rainier approximately 5,700 years ago.

==History==
The name Enumclaw is derived from the Sahaptin word /inÉ¨mÉ¬Ã¡/, meaning &quot;he who makes noise&quot;, from to /Ã­nÉ¨mn/, &quot;to neigh, bray, sing&quot;, and /-É¬a/, &quot;he who&quot;. Sometimes it is said that &quot;Enumclaw&quot; translates as &quot;place of evil spirits&quot;, apparently referring to Enumclaw Mountain, located about to the north. According to legend the mountain&#x27;s name was derived from an evil incident that occurred there, or to the occasional powerful windstorms from the east that affect the region. Native American mythology tells the story of two brothers â Enumclaw and Kapoonis â who were turned into thunder and lightning, respectively, by their father. The City of Enumclaw says the name means &quot;thundering noise&quot;.

One of the first white settlers in south King County was Allen L. Porter. In 1853, he claimed a parcel on the White River, about three miles (5Â km) west of the site of Enumclaw. He maintained a troubled relationship with the local Smalkamish tribe (some of the ancestors of the Muckleshoot tribe) for some time, and in 1855 his cabin was burned to the ground. Porter, who had been warned in advance by a friend in the tribe, hid in the woods until they had left. After warning the settlers at Fort Steilacoom, he left the area, moving to Roy. He would never return to Enumclaw.

Enumclaw itself was homesteaded in 1879 by Frank and Mary Stevenson. In 1885, the Northern Pacific Railroad routed their transcontinental mainline through the site, accepting their offer of cleared, level land on which to build a siding. Confident that the area would grow, the Stevensons filed a plat with King County that same year. They built a hotel and gave away lots for a saloon and a general store.

At first the people called the town &#x27;Stevensonville&#x27; after the founders, who soon refused the honor. One resident suggested &#x27;Enumclaw,&#x27; which was the name of the strange sawed-off promontory north of town. The name&#x27;s uniqueness gained favor with the locals.

On January 11, 1895, Mount Baldy, a small peak above the town, &quot;erupted&quot; with tremendous fire and smoke, although no losses or damage were reported, and the conflagration was minimized by residents. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s the area was farmed for hops. When the hops crop failed due to pests and economic downturn, the residents turned to dairy farming, which has been a mainstay ever since. The first census listing Enumclaw in 1900 put the population at 483 people.

In the 1890s, the Northern Pacific Railroad rerouted their line through Palmer, a few miles to the east of town. In 1910, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad routed a branch line through Enumclaw.

The city was incorporated on January 27, 1913. In 1929, a much-anticipated route to Eastern Washington was opened across the Naches Pass Highway. In the 1950s Enumclaw Insurance Group greatly expanded its business and the home office became a major employer in the town. The company is an insurer doing business in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah.

In 2005 the Enumclaw horse sex case occurred on a farm five miles (8Â km) northwest of Enumclaw towards Auburn, in unincorporated King County. A Boeing aerospace engineer named Kenneth Pinyan from Gig Harbor died after receiving anal sex from a horse at the farm. The case and the surrounding media attention led to Washington State banning bestiality.

==Geography==
The city is located in the midst of flat, level farmlands and dairy farms in the east Puget Sound lowlands. The flat geography in the middle of mountainous territory is due to the ancient Osceola Mudflow from nearby Mount Rainier.

The city is unique in the fact that it is landlocked by farm preservation on three sides and by protected forest lands to the east. The city is nestled against the Cascade foothills.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

While Enumclaw is entirely located in King County, the city owns some park property within the boundaries of Pierce County.

===Climate===
This region experiences very warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above 71.6Â°F (22Â°C). According to the KÃ¶ppen climate classification system, Enumclaw has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps. Enumclaw typically runs about 5 degrees warmer than Seattle in the summer and 5 degrees colder than Seattle in the winter. The city of Enumclaw is generally above the fog while the area to the West of the city can see dense fog due to the proximity to the Green and White Rivers as well as Lake Tapps. Snow is moderate with a typical year seeing about 6 to 8 inches total.

Enumclaw recorded the highest wind speeds for a community in the state during the November 2024 Northeast Pacific bomb cyclone, reaching .

==Economy==
In contrast to other towns with big-box stores, Enumclaw has chosen a different path for its downtown that is filled with small local boutiques and non-chain restaurants and bistros. Several companies, including Helac, Nor-Pac Seating, Nether Industries, and Hill AeroSystems, maintain major offices in the city. The remoteness of Enumclaw has made the picturesque, quintessential place to work from home and enjoy a bit of country life with all the conveniences. With the median home valued at $753,000, Enumclaw has gained many professionals, firefighters, police officers, downhill ski lovers as well as people who enjoy quick hiking access to Mt. Rainier. Enumclaw has the most dairy farms in production (16 Grade &quot;A&quot;) within the King and Pierce County region. Enumclaw has celebrated its close ties with its ag community and has many farm road stands as well as a Farmers Market that runs Spring through Fall. Many restaurants feature Farm to Fork food offerings.

===Tourism===
Enumclaw is the gateway to Mount Rainier National Park and the Crystal Mountain ski area. It is located along the Chinook Scenic Byway (SR 410), which provides seasonal access to the Yakima Valley and Eastern Washington. Enumclaw has four state parks in close proximity: Nolte, Flaming Geyser, Kanaskat Palmer, and Federation Forest. The Thunder Dome Car Museum chose Enumclaw as its location to build a major museum with vintage cars and paraphernalia. Enumclaw has become a basecamp for those wanting to ski at Crystal or hike Mt. Rainier during day and play at night. Enumclaw is well known for the King County Fair (the oldest county fair west of the Mississippi), Scottish Highland Games, AKC dog show (largest in the nation), Sundays on Cole festival every Sunday during the summer and the huge Sidewalk Street Fair the runs the third week in July. Enumclaw, in partnership with King County is just completing the last section of bike trail and a bridge that will connect Enumclaw to Puyallup with 23 miles of trail.

<text>Pacific is a city in King and Pierce counties in the State of Washington. Located primarily in King County, the population was 7,235 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Pacific was platted on April 10, 1906, by real estate promoter Clarence Dayton Hillman as &quot;C.D. Hillman&#x27;s Pacific City Addition to the City of Seattle&quot;. The development would take advantage of the nearby Puget Sound Electric Railway, which provided connections to Seattle and Tacoma. It was officially incorporated as a town on August 10, 1909.

In 1995, it annexed a portion of unincorporated Pierce County.

Record-breaking rains in November 2006 pushed the White River over its river banks along Pacific City Park, creating a temporary lake.

===2009 flooding===

On January 8, 2009, the Army Corps of Engineers released water from the Mud Mountain Dam into the White River. The action was done to relieve pressure in the reservoir, which had reached its capacity due to heavy rain that was causing flooding around the Puget Sound region. A large amount of water was released very quickly, causing rapid and massive flooding in Pacific. Those affected had virtually no notice of the impending disaster. One of those affected by the flooding was noted local and international musician Jerry Miller, a founding member of Moby Grape, who had recently moved to Pacific from Tacoma. Miller lost virtually all of his possessions, including over forty years of memorabilia from his music career. Assistance to those affected by the flooding was provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

<doc id="151282" wikidata="Q1873442" url="?curid=151282" title="Weirton, West Virginia">
<text>Weirton ( ) is a city in Hancock and Brooke counties in the U.S. state of West Virginia. Located along the Ohio River in the state&#x27;s Northern Panhandle, the city&#x27;s population was 19,163 as of the 2020 census, making it the seventh most populous city in the state.

Weirton was established in 1947 after the consolidation of various small towns in the vicinity of the Weirton Steel Corporation, founded by Ernest T. Weir in 1909. It is a principal city of the WeirtonâSteubenville metropolitan area, which had a population of 116,903 residents in 2020; it is also a major city in the western part of the PittsburghâNew CastleâWeirton combined statistical area.

==History==

Holliday&#x27;s Cove Fort was a Revolutionary War fortification constructed in 1774 by soldiers from Fort Pitt. It was located in what is now downtown Weirton, along Harmons Creek (named for Harmon Greathouse), about three miles from its mouth on the Ohio River. It was commanded by Colonel Andrew Van Swearingen (1741â1793) and later by his son-in-law, Captain Samuel Brady (1756â1795), the famous leader of Brady&#x27;s Rangers. In 1779, over 28 militia were garrisoned at Hollidays Cove. Two years earlier, Colonel Van Swearingen led a dozen soldiers by longboat down the Ohio to help rescue the inhabitants of Ft. Henry in Wheeling in a siege by the British and Indian tribes in 1777. That mission was memorialized in a WPA-era mural painted on the wall of the Cove Post Office by Charles S. Chapman (1879â1962). The mural features Col. John Bilderback, who later gained infamy as the leader of the massacre of the Moravian Indians in Gnadenhutten in 1782.

A small village called Holliday&#x27;s Cove â which is now most of downtown Weirton â was founded on the site in 1793. In 1909, Ernest T. Weir arrived from neighboring Pittsburgh and built a steel mill, later known as the Weirton Steel Corporation, just north of Holliday&#x27;s Cove. An unincorporated settlement called Weirton grew up around the mill that, by 1940, was said to be the largest unincorporated city in the United States. By then Hollidays Cove and two other outlying areas, Weirton Heights, and Marland Heights, which as their names suggest were on hilltops or ridges surrounding the &quot;WeirâCove&quot; area, had also incorporated.

On July 1, 1947, all of these areas â Hollidays Cove, Marland Heights, Weirton Heights, and unincorporated Weirton â merged and formed the city of Weirton as it currently exists. Thomas E. Millsop, the head of the Weirton Steel division of the other Ernest T. Weir company, National Steel Corporation, was elected as the city&#x27;s first mayor. The city charter was approved by voters in 1950.

The Weirton Steel Corporation was once a fully integrated steel mill employing over 12,000 people. At one point was the largest private employer and the largest taxpayer in West Virginia. Due to reorganization of the steel industry, not only within the United States but worldwide, the Weirton mill faced declines in production. During the early 1980s the employees of Weirton Steel endeavored to purchase the mill from National Steel Corporation as the largest Employee Stock Ownership Program in the nation, saving the mill from bankruptcy. However, by 2003 the corporation was forced to file bankruptcy after generating more than $700 million in losses since 1998. In 2004, International Steel Group acquired the 3,000-worker plant before merging with international giant ArcelorMittal. By 2016, only the tin-plating section of the mill, though still one of the country&#x27;s largest tin-plate makers, was in operation with only 800 workers. In 2020, Ohio-based Cleveland-Cliffs purchased the tin mill. In February 2024, Cleveland-Cliffs announced permanent closure of the mill and layoff of its remaining 800 workers.

In May 2023, Form Energy began construction at the Weirton mill site for a manufacturing facility producing iron-air batteries for electrical storage.

Some civic leaders are attempting to attract businesses and homeowners from the neighboring Pittsburgh metropolitan area, marketing Weirton as a bedroom community, taking advantage of the close proximity to the Pittsburgh International Airport and Interstate 70.

Weirton is home to a number of sites on the National Register of Historic Places including: Johnston-Truax House, Marland Heights Park and Margaret Manson Weir Memorial Pool, People&#x27;s Bank, Dr. George Rigas House, and the Peter Tarr Furnace Site.

==Economy==

Historically, Weirton&#x27;s economy, as well as that of the region, was dominated by the steel industry, with the biggest employer being Weirton Steel Corporation. Over the years as the steel industry declined, the local economy has become more diversified, with retail services and medical services recording the largest increases. Weirton Medical Center is a large 238 bed hospital that services patients from all over the region, and is one of the city&#x27;s largest employers today employing over 1,000 people.

In December 2022, Form Energy announced it will build a plant to manufacture iron-air batteries for grid- scale electrical storage in Weirton.

Due to the area&#x27;s close proximity to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, there is also a growing number of workers who work in Pittsburgh and commute from Weirton.

==Government==
=== Police ===
There have been three fatal shootings by police officers in the history of the Weirton department. The third, in 2016, was a case of suicide by cop. The first officer on the scene recognized the situation, determined that the situation posed no immediate threat, and started talking to the distressed citizen, who was holding an unloaded gun and telling the officer to &quot;Just shoot me&quot;. An officer who arrived subsequently shot the man dead on his fourth attempt, less than 10 seconds after arriving on the scene.

The police department fired the first officer for not killing the man first. The police chief said in sworn testimony that although he had fired the officer for not shooting the man soon enough, the department&#x27;s policy prohibits officers from shooting people whom they believe do not pose a threat. Shortly after this admission that the officer was fired for correctly following the department policy on the legitimate use of force, the city settled a lawsuit for wrongful termination.

The land was given to James Montgomery as a wedding present from his father-in-law, Levi Morris, who owned all the land.

The town&#x27;s late-19th century growth was due to the construction of the Kanawha &amp; Michigan Railroad across the river and the connection of the Virginian Railway at nearby Deepwater.

==Economy==

The Federal Bureau of Prisons facility Federal Prison Camp, Alderson, where media mogul Martha Stewart was imprisoned, is the largest employer in Alderson. A portion of FPC Alderson is located in unincorporated Monroe County, while the other portion of the prison lies in unincorporated Summers County.

The Alderson Federal Prison Camp is located on the spot on which the earliest settlers of the area chose to settle and called their settlement &quot;Baughman&#x27;s Fort&quot;. Baughman&#x27;s Fort was built in the 1750s and the settlement was supposedly destroyed by Native Americans shortly thereafter, though no factual evidence exists to support this theory. Few archaeological remains of the early fort remain after the building of the Federal Prison Camp in the early 20th century. Only notations in early journals refer to the location of the fort.

Betty Alderson, who is married to a descendant of the original founders of Alderson, stated &quot;every business profited&quot; when Martha Stewart was incarcerated at Alderson and media attention was focused on the community. Residents planted bulbs into a garden that was to be named &quot;Martha&#x27;s Garden.&quot;

==Local events==
&quot;Alderson has gained fame for its elaborate Fourth of July festivities, as much a fitting celebration of small-town America as it is an observance of the nation&#x27;s holiday.&quot; It is also one of the oldest celebrations in the state. It currently has one of the largest Fourth of July celebrations in West Virginia, attracting approximately 15,000 people during the parade. It is unique by offering many family activities. Over six days, events include a fireman&#x27;s rodeo, band shows, a car show, a parade, various races on the Greenbrier River, as well as a parade and fireworks. 

The Alderson Strawberry Festival began in 2016, and occurs during Memorial Day weekend every year. This festival celebrates strawberries, and the local farmers provide the strawberries for the event.

==Notable people==
* Mittie Frances Clarke Point wrote many of her novels here at &quot;The Cedars&quot;.
* Ada Beatrice Queen Victoria Louise Virginia Smith, better known as Bricktop (August 14, 1894 â February 1, 1984) was an American dancer, singer, vaudevillian, and self-described saloon-keeper who owned the nightclub Chez Bricktop in Paris from 1924 to 1961, as well as clubs in Mexico City and Rome. She has been called &quot;...one of the most legendary and enduring figures of 20th-century American cultural history.

<text>Philip the Handsome (22 June/July 1478 â 25 September 1506), also called the Fair, was ruler of the Burgundian Netherlands and titular Duke of Burgundy from 1482 to 1506, as well as the first Habsburg King of Castile (as Philip I) for a brief time in 1506.

The son of Maximilian of Austria (later Holy Roman Emperor as Maximilian I) and Mary of Burgundy, Philip was not yet four years old when his mother died as a result of a riding accident, and upon her death, he inherited the Burgundian Netherlands. Despite his young age, Philip quickly proved himself an effective ruler beloved by his people in the Low Countries, pursuing policies that favored peace and economic development, while maintaining a steady course of the government building.

In 1496, Philip&#x27;s father arranged for him to marry Joanna, the second daughter of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Around the same time, Philip&#x27;s sister, Margaret, was given in marriage to Joanna&#x27;s brother John, Prince of Asturias. After the deaths of her brother John, sister Isabella, and nephew Miguel, Joanna became heiress presumptive to the thrones of Castile and Aragon. Most of Philip&#x27;s time in Spain was spent consolidating his power, often leading to conflicts with his wife and her father. Joanna became queen of Castile when her mother died in 1504. Philip was proclaimed king in 1506, but died a few months later, leaving his wife distraught with grief. Joanna&#x27;s father, Ferdinand II of Aragon, and her own son, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, were quick to seize power, confining the queen for the rest of her life on account of her alleged insanity.

Philip was the first Habsburg monarch in Spain, and every Spanish monarch since his son Charles V has been one of his descendants. Philip died before his father, and therefore never inherited his father&#x27;s territories or became Holy Roman Emperor. However, his son Charles eventually united the Habsburg, Burgundian, Castilian, and Aragonese inheritances. By inheriting the Burgundian Netherlands and acquiring much of Spain and its possessions in the New World by marriage to Joanna, Philip was instrumental in greatly enhancing the territories of the Habsburgs, and his progeny would rule over vast European territories for the next five centuries.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Philip was born in Bruges on 22 June/July 1478, the son of the future Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife Mary, Duchess of Burgundy. He was born in the County of Flanders (today in Belgium) during the reign of his grandfather Frederick III. When Philip was born, King Louis XI of France, the chief opponent of his parents, spread the rumour that the child was actually a girl, not a boy. When Philip&#x27;s baptism was organized, his step-grandmother Margaret of York showed the boy naked to the populace, so that any doubt about the child&#x27;s sex would disappear. The child was named in honour of his maternal great-grandfather, Philip the Good, paternal grandfather of his mother Mary. In his first presentation to the father, the parents expressed double dynastic pride. Mary said: âSir, look at your son and our child, young Philip of imperial seed.â Maximilian kissed the baby, and replied, âO noble Burgundian blood, my offspring, named after Philip of Valois.â

Philip was only four years old when his mother died in 1482, resulting in him succeeding her as ruler of the Burgundian possessions under the guardianship of his father. A period of turmoil ensued which witnessed sporadic hostilities between, principally, the large towns of Flanders (especially Ghent and Bruges) and the supporters of Maximilian. Philip became caught up in events and his custody was taken away by a council appointed by the Netherlandish Estates as part of the larger Flemish campaign to support their claims of greater autonomy, which they had wrested from Mary of Burgundy in an agreement known as the Great Privilege of 1477. It was only in the summer of 1485 that Maximilian, marching into Ghent with German troops and forcing its leader Jan Coppenhole to flee, could embrace his son again. Young Philip was then brought to Mechelen and delivered to the loving care of Margaret of York. 

By 1492, the rebellions were completely suppressed. Maximilian revoked the Great Privilege and established a strong ducal monarchy, undisturbed by particularism. But he would not reintroduce Charles the Bold&#x27;s centralizing ordinances. Since 1489 (after his departure), the government under Albert III, Duke of Saxony, had made more efforts in consulting representative institutions and showed more restraint in subjugating recalcitrant territories. Notables who had previously supported rebellions returned to city administrations. The Estates General continued to develop as a regular meeting place of the central government. By the time Maximilian handed over the government to Philip, Habsburg rule was a matter of fact.

Despite tumultuous political conditions, the early death of Philip&#x27;s mother as well as the separation from his father and sister, Philip&#x27;s young life did not lack luxuries. He was educated for the needs of a person of his social class. He became accomplished in archery, tennis, stick fighting, hunting. He also proved a valiant knight, like his father. He was a good dancer and conversationalist. He also inherited his parents&#x27; passion for music. Although, this boisterousness would not manifest in his manners as a politician. 

Constant campaigning caused Maximilian, the father, to be absent from the young Philip&#x27;s life (he returned to battles only two months after Philip&#x27;s birth). Later, emotional problems made Maximilian try to avoid returning to the Netherlands, and he would miss both the 1494 inauguration and 1496 wedding of his son. Philip&#x27;s tutors since arriving at Mechelen were Olivier de la Marche and FranÃ§ois de Busleyden, who would later be his chancellor in Flanders.

===Ruler of Burgundian lands===
In 1493, Frederick III died, thus Philip&#x27;s father Maximilian I became de facto leader of the Holy Roman Empire. Burdened with his new responsibilities and personally exasperated by his relationship with the Burgundian lands, he decided to transfer power to the 15-year-old Philip. The news was welcomed by Burgundian lands, as the new ruler was native-born, spoke the language, was peace-loving and trusted his advisors, while Maximilian was warlike and did not respect the Great Privilege. From this year, Philip was in control of the government. As King of the Romans, Maximilian did not accept homage from Philip though, a signal that he intended to exercise direct control over the lands. His defeated subjects were too exhausted to resist.

At his inauguration in 1494, one of Philip the Fair&#x27;s first administrative acts was the abolition of the Great Privilege. He swore to maintaining only the privileges granted at the time of Philip the Good. As during the revolts, many of the rebels had claimed Philip as their rightful and natural prince (as opposed to his father), Philip capitalized on this to restore several of his great-grandfather and grandfather&#x27;s centralizing policies, while abandoning their expansionism.
Philip was an inexperienced ruler and had a reputation for accommodating and trusting advisors, but also had a backbone. Philip freed himself from his father&#x27;s control. Although Busleyden was temporarily disgraced when Maximilian summoned his son in 1496 to Germany, he was soon restored. In 1497, Philip replaced Jean Carondelet, the chancellor Maximilian had appointed, with Thomas de Plaine, who was devoted to his interests. His pursuit of peace with France frustrated Maximilian, who was waging war against Charles VIII of France. Philip reconciled the regionalism represented by the Great Privilege with the harsh centralization the country had experienced under Charles the Bold, softening the rigorous demands of both sides while giving in to neither. He reimposed the Parliament of Mechelen (renamed as the Great Council, which was placed in Mechelen in December 1501 â de jure from 1504) and reclaimed royal domains. He placated France while reopening the trade route with England in the Magnus Intercursus. His policies gained him the love of the country. Patricia Carson opines, though, that it was clear from the beginning that this was not meant to last, as Philip would never be able to focus on Burgundian lands forever. He was the heir of his father as Holy Roman Emperor. What the Low Countries could not have foreseen, was that Philip would one day claim the throne in Spain as well, as the husband of Joanna.
From the time of Philip, the government in the Low Countries constituted a compromise between the states and the Empire (although, at this time, Burgundian lands had not become part of imperial circles yet, which would be confirmed in 1512 and formalized in 1548). The chancellor of Burgundy became responsible for the government&#x27;s practical work in the absence of the emperor while the Great Council (&quot;Hoge Raad&quot;) acted as the country&#x27;s highest body of judicial power.

Philip&#x27;s policy was focused on maintaining peace and economic development for his Burgundian lands. Maximilian wanted to recover Guelders, but his son wanted to keep a neutral policy and thus the father was left fighting Charles of Egmond over Guelders on his own. Only at the end of his reign, Philip decided to deal with that threat together with his father. Guelders had been weakened because of the continuous state of war and other problems. That would turn out to be the only campaign in Philip&#x27;s life. The duke of Cleves and the bishop of Utrecht, hoping to share spoils, gave Philip aid. Maximilian invested his own son with Guelders and Zutphen. Within months, Philip conquered the whole land and Charles of Egmond was forced to prostrate himself in front of his sovereign at the palace of Rosendaal. Charles was then forced to follow Philip wherever he went. In October 1505, they were in Brussels. But after that, Charles was able to escape and start the war again. Philip was not in a good position to make good his claims yet, because by this time he needed to depart to Spain to claim the Castilian throne.

At the same time, while he often carefully avoided direct confrontation with the French king, in promoting his Great Council, he slowly eroded the capacity of intervention of the Parlement of Paris in Flanders and Artois, lands under the sovereignty of France. This process would be completed by Charles V in 1521. In August 1505, this resulted in written protests from King Louis XII of France, who accused him of usurpation of the rights of the sovereign and threatened Philip with sanctions. To this, Maximilian, who at this time was with Philip after returning from Gelderland, angrily sent threats and stated that he would defend his son. Philip reacted in a concilliatory manner, stating that he had consulted Maximilian and did not mean to offend Louis.

Philip (and later his son Charles V) joined his father in patronising the devotion of the Seven Sorrows that associated his own mother Mary of Burgundy, who had died young and been idealised in vernacular literature, with the Virgin Mary. The devotion, with its strong current of patriotism and Burgundian nostalgia, successfully helped to rally loyalty to the ruling family in the turbulence after Mary&#x27;s death. The same devotion was later used to promote dynastic and territorial unity.
He visited Germany several times:
*On 31 August 1496, he came to Lindau to represent his father at the Reichstag of Lindau (1496â 1497) because Maximilian could not come to the Diet personally. 
*In 1498, he accompanied his father to the Reichstag in Freiburg.
*In 1505, he attended the Reichstag at Hagenau, where he and his father met the minister of the king of France, the Cardinal of Amboise.

===The Castilian inheritance===
The marriage was one of a set of family alliances between the Habsburgs and the TrastÃ¡maras, designed to strengthen the two dynasties against growing French power, which had increased significantly thanks to the policies of Louis XI and the successful assertion of regal power after the war with the League of the Public Weal. The matter became more urgent after Charles VIII&#x27;s invasion of Italy (known as the First Peninsular War). This was a matter of compromise for Philip. While assuring his pro-French advisors that he would maintain peaceful policies towards France, the marriage pleased Maximilian while allowing a partial, prudent emergence from France&#x27;s shadow. Although, Philip did put efforts in safeguarding the 1493 Treaty of Senlis. His independent tendency frustrated both Maximilian and his new parents-in-law.

On 20 October 1496, he married Joanna, daughter of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile, in Lier, Belgium.

Philip&#x27;s sister Margaret married John, Prince of Asturias, the only son of Ferdinand and Isabella and heir apparent to the unified crowns of Castile and Aragon. The double alliance was never intended to let the Spanish kingdoms fall under Habsburg control. At the time of her marriage to Philip, Joanna was third in line to the throne, with John and their sister Isabella married and hopeful of progeny.
In 1500, shortly after the birth of Joanna and Philip&#x27;s second child (the future Emperor Charles V), in Flanders, the succession to the Castilian and Aragonese crowns was thrown into turmoil. The heir apparent, John, had died in 1497 very shortly after his marriage to Margaret of Austria. The crown thereby seemed destined to devolve upon his and Joanna&#x27;s elder sister Isabella, wife of Manuel I of Portugal. She died in 1498, while giving birth to a son named Miguel da Paz, to whom succession to the united crowns of Castile, Aragon and Portugal now fell; however, the infant was sickly and died during the summer of 1500.

The succession to the Castilian and Aragonese crowns now fell to Joanna. Because Ferdinand could produce another heir, the Cortes of Aragon refused to recognize Joanna as heir presumptive to the Kingdom of Aragon. In the Kingdom of Castile, however, the succession was clear. Moreover, there was no Salic tradition that the Castilian Cortes could use to thwart the succession passing to Joanna. At this point, the issue of Joanna&#x27;s supposed mental incompetence moved from courtly annoyance to the center of the political stage, since it was clear that Philip and his Burgundian entourage would be the real power-holders in Castile.
In 1502, Philip, Joanna, and a large part of the Burgundian court traveled to Spain to receive fealty from the Cortes of Castile as heirs, a journey chronicled in intense detail by Antoon I van Lalaing (), the future Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland. Philip and the majority of the court returned to the Low Countries in the following year, leaving a pregnant Joanna behind in Madrid, where she gave birth to Ferdinand, later Holy Roman Emperor.

Although Joanna was deeply in love with Philip, their married life was rendered extremely unhappy by his infidelity and political insecurity, during which time he constantly attempted to usurp her legal birthright of power. This led in great part to the rumours of her insanity from reports of depressive or neurotic acts committed while she was being imprisoned or coerced by her husband, rumors that benefited Philip politically. Most historians now agree she was merely clinically depressed at the time, not insane as commonly believed. Before her mother&#x27;s death, in 1504, husband and wife were already living apart.

===King of Castile===
In 1504, Philip&#x27;s mother-in-law, Queen Isabella of Castile, died, leaving the Crown of Castile to Joanna. Isabella I&#x27;s widower and former co-monarch, King Ferdinand II, endeavored to lay hands on the regency of Castile, but the nobles, who disliked and feared him, forced him to withdraw. Philip was summoned to Spain, where he was recognized as king.
However, en route to Spain in January 1506, Philip and Joanna were caught in a storm and shipwrecked off the Dorset coast, forcing them on the shore near Melcombe Regis. 
The nearest important gentleman in the locality was Sir Thomas Trenchard, seated at Wolfeton House, who gave shelter and entertainment to the royal couple. The future minister John Russell attended the couple on this occasion, after which Philip recommended him to Henry VII.
Having been conducted to the palace of King Henry VII by Russell, the couple stayed as the king&#x27;s guests but were in fact hostages for the duration of their stay. To get released Philip was forced to sign a treaty with Henry VIIâthe so-called &quot;&quot;âwhich included a mutual defense pact, the extradition of rebels, including the Earl of Suffolk, Edmund de la Pole, who as an exile was a guest of Philip in the Low Countries, and a trade agreement which allowed English merchants to import cloth duty-free into the Low Countries. After handing over Edmund, Philip and Joanna were allowed to leave England after a stay of six weeks.

Philip and Joanna landed at Corunna on 28 April 1506, accompanied by a body of German mercenaries. Father- and son-in-law mediated under Cardinal Cisneros at Remesal, near Puebla de Sanabria, and at Renedo, the only result of which was an indecent family quarrel, in which Ferdinand professed to defend the interests of his daughter, who he said was imprisoned by her husband. In meetings between 20 and 27 June, mediated by Cardinal Cisneros, the senior churchman in Spain, Ferdinand accepted that his &#x27;most beloved children&#x27; (Joanna and Philip) should take over control of Castile.

The two kings then agreed that Joanna was neither fit nor inclined to rule &#x27;considering her infirmities and sufferings, which for the sake of honour are not expressed&#x27; and further that if &#x27;the said most serene Queen, either from her own choice or from being persuaded by other persons should attempt to meddle in the government both would prevent it&#x27;. It suited both her father and her husband that she be regarded as incapable.
On 27 June 1506, the Treaty of VillafÃ¡fila was signed between Ferdinand and Philip, with Philip being proclaimed King of Castile by the Cortes of Valladolid. Yet on the same day Ferdinand drew up secret documents repudiating all the agreements on the grounds of coercion, claiming that he would never otherwise have signed treaties that did &#x27;such enormous damage to the said most serene Queen, my daughter, and me&#x27;. Having left his options for the future open, he departed for Aragon. Philip appointed GarcÃ­a Laso de la Vega (diplomat and commander, Comendador Mayor de LÃ©on under the Catholic Monarch, died 1512) as President of the Royal Council.

Even before leaving the Low Countries, Philip had ordered the total suspension of Spanish Inquisition activities. When he arrived in Spain, he proposed to the Cortes that the Inquisitor General should be deposed and the Council of Inquisition should be dissolved. His early death prevented the plan from materializing, but Ferdinand later reacted to this by splitting the Holy Tribunal, thus Castile and Aragon would each possess their own Inquisition organization. The 4,000 landsknechte who followed him to Spain presumably helped to overcome the last opposition to the military reform started by Gonzalo de Cordoba and Gonzalo de Ayora.

As Duke of Burgundy and King of Castile, Philip expanded the Habsburg postal system established by his father. In 1500, the centre of the system was transferred to Brussels by Franz von Taxis, whom Philip made his postmaster-general. Shortly after becoming King of Castile, as he realized that his bureaucrats were unable to govern the postal system, he made an agreement (later renewed by Charles of Burgundy) with the Taxis that allowed them to operate unhampered by interference from the state, as long as they maintained standards in accordance with the Habsburgs&#x27; interests. Behringer notes that, &quot;The terminology of the early modern communications system and the legal status of its participants were invented at these negotiations.&quot; On 18 January 1505 Philip unified communication between Germany, the Netherlands, France and Spain by adding stations in Granada, Toledo, Blois, Paris and Lyon. 

His arrival introduced the Burgundian household model into Spain, but his early death forced it to wait until Charles V&#x27;s reign to become a firmly-established element of the Spanish court.

After one month in La CoruÃ±a, he returned to Burgos and set about to appoint his men to strategic fortresses, the Royal Council as well as financial offices. He granted the Castle of Segovia and some other important fortresses to Don Juan Manuel (who was ironically Ferdinand&#x27;s former servant, and had become Philip&#x27;s favourite after the archbishop of BesanÃ§on died.

He ran into financial troubles as parts of his army remained unpaid and he granted generous financial conditions to Ferdinand to hasten his departure.

Cauchies writes that, in Spain, Philip found himself in the same situation his father had been during his Burgundian days. Until this day, he has been accused of being a foreign, spendthrift prince, a mere transitional monarch who was supported by bad advisors who disregarded the interests of the country. Philip would not live to see a better day like his father had, though.

===Patronage of the arts===

Philip was an important patron of Hieronymus Bosch. In 1504, he commissioned Bosch to paint a large triptych of The Last Judgement. The work cannot be found now, but likely had some relation to the smaller triptych of the same subject in Vienna (painted by the same artist), as the face of the saint on the right outer wing seems to be that of Philip.

Philip&#x27;s chapel had some of the most distinguished musicians in Europe: Henry Bredemers, Pierre de La Rue, Alexander Agricola, Marbrianus de Orto and Antoine Divitis. Josquin Desprez sometimes composed for him as well. The contemporary Venetian ambassador wrote home: &quot;Three things [here] are of the highest excellence: silkÂ ..., tapestryÂ ..., [and] music, which certainly can be said to be perfect.&quot; Perhaps influenced by Maximilian, Philip actively supported instrumental music. There seemed to be a lend-lease arrangement of some kind between the courts of father and son, as the trombonist Augustine Schubinger worked for both Maximilian and Philip. Other outstanding wind players supported by Philip included Hans Nagel
and Jan Van den Winckel.
Philip realized the potential of the printing industry regarding its ability to disseminate information, but when it came to private taste, he had an aversion towards printed books and preferred manuscripts, especially musical manuscripts, which became popular diplomatic gifts under his reign. The chief musical scribe was the priest Martin Bourgeois. The court also employed other scribes and calligraphers. The grandees of the realm also adopted the taste of their sovereign. 

His patronage of manuscripts though could not compare with that of his ancestors Philip the Bold and Philip the Good, as he died young and manuscript production had declined overall by the end of the fifteenth century. One manuscript produced for him, a world chronicle by Johannes de Vico from Douai (Cod. 325, &quot;Ãsterreichische Nationalbibliothek&quot; in Vienna, 660 Ã 430mm), is unrivalled in comparison with his predecessor&#x27;s manuscripts though. The layout and content display many unique features. The heraldic program on fol.17v seems to correspond to the situation of the 1498 Treaty of Paris, when Philip sided with the French king and the papacy against his father (who is referred to as emperor in the lineage of Holy Roman Emperors and the inscription that introduces the commissioner, but otherwise appears not in his own right but as the consort of Mary of Burgundy and guardian of Philip; Frederick III, Philip&#x27;s paternal grandfather, on the other hand, is given a lengthy section; also the book does not mention Philip&#x27;s Burgundian ancestors or King Louis IX of France, who frequently features in French universal chronicles of the fifteenth century). 

Philip was a patron to Desiderius Erasmus, who praised him for making peace with France and advised him that after God, a prince&#x27;s duty was owed first to &quot;patria&quot; (the nation) and not to &quot;pater&quot; (father, in this case Maximilian).

===Death and aftermath===
However, Philip died suddenly at Burgos, apparently of typhoid fever, on 25 September 1506, although a poisoning (assassination) was widely spoken of at the time, and is what his wife believed to be the cause of Philip&#x27;s death. His wife supposedly refused to allow his body to be buried or part from it for a while. Philip I is entombed at the Royal Chapel of Granada (Capilla Real de Granada), alongside his wife, and her parents Isabella I and Ferdinand II. Cauchies even proposes plague as a possible cause of death, as at this point Philip seemed to be exhausted, having overworked himself (the workload was so enormous that despite being a passionate hunter all his life, Philip was unable to exercise this hobby for just once, as he wrote to his father in July 1506) and there were known incidents of plague in the environment. Philip had shown a level of prudence about the food served to him: a letter of the experienced German commander Wolfgang von FÃ¼rstenberg (who commanded the Landsknechte and was attached to Philip&#x27;s entourage by Maximilian) to Maximilian shows that in A CoruÃ±a, Philip ate only at FÃ¼rstenberg&#x27;s table because he distrusted other sources of food. Nevertheless, Maximilian unhesitatingly and openly blamed Louis XII for his beloved son&#x27;s death in front of the Imperial Diet. 

In the aftermath, a delegation of the States General of the Netherlands was sent to Austria to offer the regency to Maximilian. The depressed emperor tried to evade them to their surprise. In 1507, he finally received them and decided that Philip&#x27;s sister, Margaret of Austria, would become the governor. In April 1517, the States General welcomed the appointment of another native of the Netherlands.

In Spain, hearing about Philip&#x27;s death. the opponents of the Inquisition made a move. The marquis of Priego attacked the Inquisition&#x27;s prison and liberated its prisoners. The procurator was arrested. Diego RodrÃ­guez Lucero, the inquisitor of Cordoba, managed to flee. &quot;The canons, the municipality and the nobilityâthe marquis of Priego and the count of Cabraâall denounced the excesses, corruption and abuses of the inquisitor&quot;. This later caused Ferdinand to declare Grand Inquisitor Deza to be responsible. Deza was forced to resign and was replaced with Cardinal Cisneros, who arrested Lucero in 1508.

===Epithets===
His good looks earned him the nickname &quot;the Handsome&quot; or &quot;the Fair&quot;.

Many contemporaries noticed Philip&#x27;s physical attractiveness. Vincenzo Querini, the Venetian ambassador, described Philip as &quot;physically beautiful, vigorous and rich&quot; (&quot;bello di corpo, gagliardo e prospero&quot;). Peter Martyr d&#x27;Anghiera and Lorenzo de Padilla also noted his good looks. When Louis XII of France saw him, the king said, &quot;What a handsome prince!&quot; (&quot;Que voilÃ  un beau prince&quot;).&quot;

He was a slim sportsman who liked to dress in a sumptuous style and knew how to impress women. His skills in knightly exercises and the hunt was such that even as a youth, he acted as teacher of the princes sent to his court.

Joan-Lluis Palos suggests that the epithet might come also from his riding style and his behaviours as a sportsman. When he visited Castile in 1502, he astonished his hosts when he displayed his riding skills by leaping from one horse to another. He also admired a Spanish riding style (inspired by the Muslims), called &quot;Ã  la jineta&quot;, with bent knees and short stirrups. He learned this from RÃ¡mon of Cardona, Master of King Ferdinand&#x27;s stable, in a matter of days. According to , he &quot;played all sports as a pastime, and was fonder of la pelota [handball] than any other.&quot; He also appeared to prefer the luxurious &quot;Moorish&quot; dressing style to the Spanish one.
A 1611 dictionary explains thus:
&quot;jinete&quot; [rider] might come from &quot;cinete&quot;, which is &quot;Cinetum&quot; in Arabic, and means ornament, from the word &quot;ceyene&quot;, to beautify or make beautiful [&quot;hermosear o ser hermoso&quot;], from the gallantry of riders when they rally to festivities with their turbans and feathers, fitted Moorish dresses and boots and the harnesses of their rich horses.

Philip also had the nickname &quot;Croit-Conseil&quot; (Believer of Counsel or Believer of Council), chosen for him by Olivier de La Marche. This nickname has sometimes been interpreted as portraying a malleable prince who allowed his advisors to control the country. According to Catherine Emerson, attending to &quot;conseil&quot; is actually a cardinal virtue of a prince, which La March attributed to both Philip the Good and his great-grandson. Anna Margarete Schlegelmilch also writes that the nickname is not derogative in any way. Both La March and other contemporaries like Jean Molinet thought that it was a good sign when a young ruler was open to the words of prudent and wise advisors. It corresponds to the ruling style of a prince who, out of the desire to attain peace and economic recovery for a country that had recently experienced too much turbulence, tried to balance his government between the rights of the prince, the nobles and the provinces, gave his Estates a say in the matters of war and peace, and relied upon confidants whose families had served his ancestors for generations (the &quot;conseil ducal&quot; had 14 members, including Engelbert II of Nassau, William de CroÃ¿, John III of Bergen).

===Legacy===

Philip was a figure often eclipsed in history books by his parents, Mary and Maximilian, partly also by his tragic wife Joanna I, and even more so by his son, Charles V. In his 2003 biography &quot;Philippe le Beau: le dernier duc de Bourgogne&quot; (&quot;Philip the Handsome: the last Duke of Burgundy&quot;), Belgian historian Jean-Marie Cauchies writes that Philip, who died young, still at the beginning of his political ascendancy, was not yet an aspirant for universal monarchy like his son later, but remained above all the heir and continuator of the dukes of Burgundy. Surrounded by ambitious ministers with very divergent views, facing his father (the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire), his parents-in-law (the Catholic monarchs), and the king of France, his choices as a leader presented him as the &quot;enfant terrible&quot; of international European politics. According to Cauchies, he was not a &quot;great man&quot;, or had not lived long enough to show himself as such. He had not shown the stature or the creativity of his father, and could not claim the scope that Charles V reached either. But he personified the prince of peace and concord, the promise of better days, and his education, his manners, his court displayed the essence of Burgundian culture.

Belgian historian Jonathan Dumont, while reviewing &quot;Le Royaume inachevÃ© des ducs de Bourgogne (XIVeâXVe siÃ¨cles)&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Illusion of the Burgundian State&quot;) Ãlodie Lecuppre-Desjardin, notes that historiography dealing with the Burgundian state building project should not end with Charles the Bold, as attempts to build a monarchical and state-ideal became particularly visible under Philip the Handsome and extended into the early years of Charles of Habsburg. If there was a rupture, it happened only with the 1519 imperial election.

James Kennedy notes that by most accounts, Philip was &quot;an ideal prince, well acquainted with and well disposed toward the Low Countries.&quot;

German historÃ­an Klaus Oschema argues that the Burgundian-Habsburg alliance&#x27;s situation in the West, and especially their ascension in Spain, was far from being guaranteed in the beginning. It was the work of Philip and his sister Margaret that made their father&#x27;s expansion strategy in the West possible and paved the way for the Habsburgs&#x27; ultimate success.

Some criticize him for being a sadist in private life though, regarding his treatment of Joanna, that he &quot;held Juana in a vicious cycle of affection, abuse, and intimidation from which she was constitutionally unable to escape.&quot; He had a loving relationship with Margaret, who had been separated from him for a long time though. When they said goodbye to each other in 1497, Margaret told her brother these prophetic words, with a taste of gallows humour, &quot;Don&#x27;t make me cry, I will need to swallow enough salt water.&quot;

===Depictions in arts===

*Peter Frey, a composer active in the first half of the sixteenth century, wrote a song about Philip&#x27;s 1506 journey and visit to Santiago.
*There are two &quot;historical songs&quot; in the Netherlands about Philip&#x27;s journey and death, which also paint a negative picture of Joanna. One of them accuses her of poisoning Philip.
*&quot;Absalon, fili mi&quot; is a motet, possibly commissioned by Maximilian to commemorate Philip&#x27;s death, and written by Pierre de la Rue, although there are controversies on the matter.
*&quot;Arch of Philip IV&quot; by Peter Paul Rubens, Jacob Jordaens and Cornelis de Vos (1614) features the marriage of Philip and Joanna on the main panel of one side.
*Maximilian&#x27;s Cenotaph in Innsbruck features (measuring ), also considered one of the most notable staues of the group.
*There are various depictions of the scene of Philip&#x27;s death and Joanna in mourning. &quot;DoÃ±a Joanna the Mad&quot; (1877) by the Spanish painter Francisco Pradilla is a notable example. Others include &quot;&quot; (1836) by Charles de Steuben, &quot;&quot; (1866) by Lorenzo VallÃ©s.
*Philip is depicted in a miniature in the &quot;Freydal&quot; tournament book jousting with his father, Maximilian, who is in the guise of the book&#x27;s eponymous hero. The scene is anachronistic as the tournament book, commissioned by Maximilian between 1512 and 1515, tells a fictionalised story, through allegory, of how Maximilian met Philip&#x27;s mother.

==Family==
At the beginning of their marriage, Philip had genuine affection for Joanna. But his education, which was influenced by Franco-Burgundian traditions, contributed to a model of rulership &quot;exclusively male&quot;, thus he never saw Joanna as his political equal and could not accept that she tried to forge her own political identity. Maximilian tried to reconcile the couple, telling Philip that he could only succeed as a ruler if husband and wife acted as &quot;una cosa medesima&quot; (one and the same), but despite Philip&#x27;s efforts, Joanna would not cooperate in his power struggle against her own father. In the end, his controlling and manipulative behaviours, together with Ferdinand&#x27;s ambitions and Joanna&#x27;s depression, ruined the marriage and led to Joanna&#x27;s personal tragedies. Philip and Joanna of Castile had:
* Eleanor (1498â1558), queen consort of Portugal and France
* Charles V (1500â1558), king of Spain, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire
* Isabella (1501â1526), queen consort of Denmark, Norway and Sweden
* Ferdinand (1503-1564), emperor of the Holy Roman Empire (1556-1564)
* Mary (1505â1558), queen consort of Hungary and Bohemia, governor of the Spanish Netherlands
* Catherine (1507â1578), queen consort of Portugal

<text>Nitro is a city in Kanawha and Putnam counties in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It takes its name from a World War I era nitrocellulose plant. The population was 6,618 according to the 2020 census. It is part of the Charleston metropolitan area.

==History==
Nitro was incorporated in 1932 by Circuit Court. The name Nitro derives from nitrocellulose, the main ingredient in smokeless gunpowder. The Nitro area was to be the American ammunition production facility during World WarI. Daniel C. Jackling &quot;supervised the construction and operation&quot; of the plant, which by the time of the armistice &quot;was producing one hundred thousand pounds of high explosives per day.&quot;

Its name was selected by the United States government because of the establishment there, during World WarI, of a large federal plant for the manufacture of explosives. The city is known as &quot;a Living Memorial to World WarI.&quot;

==Education==

The city&#x27;s public school students do not all attend the same schools, because West Virginia school districts are divided strictly along county lines, without regard to city boundaries.

Kanawha County residents are served by the following schools in the city:
* Nitro Elementary School (public)
* Nitro High School (public)

There is no public middle school in Nitro on either side of the county line, nor is there any public school within the Putnam County portion of the city. Middle school students in Kanawha County must bus to Andrew Jackson Middle School in Cross Lanes. Putnam County students must bus to Rock Branch Elementary, Poca Middle, and Poca High.

==Environment==
The reach of the Kanawha River Valley between Belle and Nitro is known locally as the &quot;Chemical Valley&quot;, which, at its peak in the late 1950s and early 1960s, was the leading producer of chemicals in the world (Henry, 1974). During World WarI the government built an $80 million complex in Nitro to manufacture explosives and chemicals for the war effort.

The site was located on an cow pasture on the Kanawha River on the flat river valley floodplain. The facility had just been placed in operation when the war ended in November 1918. The first shipment of powder was also the last. Local authorities then sought various chemical companies to occupy the facility which had excellent infrastructure in utilities, transportation and new housing for workers. It was hoped that the former gunpowder complex would become a major chemical manufacturing center, especially for the emerging dye industry in the U.S. that relied on coal and coke by-products as feedstock.

The Kanawha River and water in the adjacent alluvium have been adversely affected by industrial activities (Messinger, 1997).

The chemical manufacturing history of Nitro resulted in environmental impairment, including the Fike/Artel Chemical Site (EPA ID: WVD047989207), which is on the National Priorities List Superfund. The site was placed on the EPA National Priorities List in 1983. The site is a former World WarI chemical munitions plant at which subsequent chemical manufacturing, reclamation and disposal was allegedly conducted.

The Solutia Inc. Nitro Plant, located on the east bank of the Kanawha River approximately one-half mile north of the City of Nitro in Putnam County, is being investigated through the RCRA program. From 1918 to 1921, the facility manufactured explosives including &quot;nitro-powder&quot; to support World WarI. When explosives manufacturing processes ceased, the facility was purchased and used for a variety of industries. In 1971, the buildings were used by a heavy chemical company Fike Chemical and further investigation showed improper waste remediation. RCRA Corrective Action activities at this facility are being conducted under the direction of EPA Region 3 and the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection.

Other RCRA Corrective Action facilities include Great Lakes Chemicals Company (formerly FMC Corporation) and Union Carbide Corp. - PTO (a subsidiary of The Dow Chemical Company).

Due to manufacturing activities, Nitro became known for a distinctive chemical smellâespecially in the area of the I-64 bridge. However, the recent shift away from manufacturing in the region has significantly reduced air pollution issues.

===Agent Orange===
In February 2012, Monsanto agreed to settle a case covering dioxin contamination around a plant in Nitro that had made Agent Orange. Monsanto agreed to pay up to $9 million for cleanup of affected homes, $84 million for medical monitoring of people affected, and the community&#x27;s legal fees.

===Scientific Research Activities===
In 2001 Clonaid operated a lab in Nitro that was tied to the Raelians. It was located inside a rented room within a former high school. The FDA said that the equipment in the lab was state-of-the-art and had been bought by former West Virginia state legislator Mark Hunt.

===Cancer Cluster===
For over 50 years, the Monsanto plant in Nitro, West Virginia, created dioxin waste while producing herbicides, Agent Orange (during the Vietnam War), and different forms of rubber. Recent and past literature has established a link between the Monsanto plant and increased cancer cases within the region. Although evidence seems to support the occurrence of clustering within the Nitro and Saint Albans areas, further epidemiological and spatial studies are required.
