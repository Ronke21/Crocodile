<text>Odessa () is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the county seat of Ector County with portions extending into Midland County.

Odessa&#x27;s population was 114,428 at the 2020 census, making it the 34th-largest city in Texas; it is the principal city of the Odessa metropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Ector County. The metropolitan area is also a component of the larger Midland–Odessa combined statistical area, which had a 2020 census population of 359,001.

The city is famous for being featured in the book &quot;Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream&quot;, and the movie adaption, &quot;Friday Night Lights.&quot;

In 1948, Odessa was also the home of First Lady Barbara Bush, and the onetime home of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Former President George H. W. Bush has been quoted as saying &quot;At Odessa we became Texans and proud of it.&quot;

==History==

Odessa was founded in 1881 as a water stop and cattle-shipping point on the Texas and Pacific Railway. The first post office opened in 1885. Odessa became the county seat of Ector County in 1891 when the county was first organized. It was incorporated as a city in 1927, after oil was discovered in Ector County on the Connell Ranch southwest of Odessa.

With the opening of the Penn Field in 1929, and the Cowden Field in 1930, oil became a major draw for new residents. In 1925, the population was just 750; by 1929, it had risen to 5,000. For the rest of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s population and economy grew rapidly during each of a succession of oil booms (roughly in the 1930s–1950s, 1970s, and 2010s), often with accompanying contractions during the succeeding busts (particularly in the 1960s and 1980s).

=== Etymology ===
Odessa is said to have been named after Odesa, a coastal city in Southern Ukraine, (historically spelled &quot;Odessa&quot;) because of the local shortgrass prairie&#x27;s resemblance to Ukraine&#x27;s steppe landscape.

==Geography==
Odessa is located along the southwestern edge of the Llano Estacado in West Texas. It is situated above the Permian Basin, a large sedimentary deposit that contains significant reserves of oil and natural gas.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; are land and (0.05%) is covered by water.

===Climate===
Odessa has a hot semiarid climate typical of West Texas. Summers are hot and sunny, while winters are cool and dry. Most rainfall occurs in late spring and summer; snowfall is rare. The area exhibits a large diurnal temperature range and frequent high winds.

==Economy==

Historically, the Odessa economy has been primarily driven by the area&#x27;s oil industry, booming and busting in response to rises and falls in the crude oil price. Many of the city&#x27;s largest employers are oilfield supply companies and petrochemical processing companies. In recent decades, city leaders have begun trying to decrease the city&#x27;s reliance on the energy industry to moderate the boom-bust cycle and develop greater economic sustainability.

Odessa has also taken steps to diversify the energy it produces. In 2009, a wind farm has been constructed in northern Ector County. Around the same time, a coal pollution mitigation plant had been announced for a site previously entered in the Futuregen bidding. The plant will be run by Summit Power and will be located near Penwell. This plant was supposed to lead to the creation of 8,000 jobs in the area. Plans were also in place for a small nuclear reactor called the High-Temperature Teaching and Test Reactor to be run as a test and teaching facility in conjunction with the nuclear engineering department at University of Texas of the Permian Basin.

Odessa&#x27;s main enclosed shopping mall, Music City Mall, used to include an indoor ice skating rink.

===Largest employers===
As in many municipalities, some of the largest employers are in the education, government, and healthcare industries. Outside of those areas, the city&#x27;s major employers are concentrated in the oil industry. According to the city&#x27;s 2021 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city were:

Odessa has a council–manager government, with a city council of five councillors (elected from geographic districts) and a mayor (elected at-large). The council appoints and directs other city officials, including the city manager, and sets the city&#x27;s budget, taxes, and other policies.

In the 2014 fiscal year, the Odessa government had $179.1 million in revenues, $146.3 million in expenditures, $454 million in total assets, and $203 million in total liabilities. The city&#x27;s major sources of public revenues were fees for services (such as public utilities), sales taxes, and property taxes, and its major expenses were for public safety and for water and sewer service.

On December 14, 2022, the Odessa City Council voted to make Odessa a &quot;sanctuary city for the unborn.&quot; In a 6–1 vote, Mayor Javier Joven and council members Denise Swanner, Mark Matta, Gilbert Vasquez, Chris Hanie, and Greg Connell established Odessa as the 62nd city to &quot;outlaw&quot; abortion. The new city ordinance makes a person civilly liable if any person aids, abets, or assists anybody in an abortion operation.

In October 2024, the city gained national attention after voting 5–2 to implement a transgender bathroom ban, in which any transgender person found using a publicly owned bathroom not matching their assigned gender at birth could be charged with trespassing. The ban was particularly notable for creating a private right to sue, under which any cisgender individual may seek damages from the transgender person of at minimum $10,000 in addition to attorney and court fees. A month later, they expanded the law to cover all restrooms public or private, and allow anyone to sue regardless of if they&#x27;re an Odessa or even Texas resident.

<text>Mansfield is a suburban city in the U.S. state of Texas, and is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The city is located mostly in Tarrant County, with small parts in Ellis and Johnson counties. Its location is approximately 30 miles from Dallas and 20 miles from Fort Worth, and is adjacent to Arlington. As of the 2020 census, the population was 72,602, up from 56,368 in 2010.

==History==
The first wave of European settlers arrived in the rolling Cross Timbers country of north central Texas in the 1840s. Primarily of Scotch-Irish origins, these pioneer farmers came for the most part from southern states, following the frontier as it shifted west of the Mississippi. They entered an area where Native Americans had been living for thousands of years. The Comanche posed a serious threat to the settlers, and in 1849, the U.S. Army established Fort Worth to protect the farms along the sparsely populated frontier.

The area southeast of the fort (and of the Trinity River) was well protected and presumably fairly well settled by the early 1850s. In one well-documented case, eight related families migrated to the area in 1853 from Illinois. Three of the four Gibson brothers in this group established homesteads about northwest of present-day Mansfield. This settlement, which became known as the Gibson Community, included a school and a church building by 1860.

When Ralph Sandiford Man and Julian Feild arrived around 1856 and built a grist mill at the crossroads that was to become the center of Mansfield, the beginnings of the community probably existed in the oak groves bordering Walnut Creek (originally called Cedar Bluff Creek). The Walnut Creek Congregation of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church had organized itself in 1854. Members met in each other&#x27;s homes, so it is suspected that there was a cluster of houses in the area.

In 1856, Julian Feild purchased in the Mansfield area. Man and Feild completed their three-story brick grist mill sometime between 1856 and 1859. The mill, which produced flour and meal, was the first built in North Texas to utilize steam power and enjoyed patronage as far south as San Antonio and as far north as Oklahoma. The location of the mill in southeastern Tarrant County perhaps reflects the advanced state of wheat cultivation in the area and the ready availability of wood to feed the mill&#x27;s steam boilers.

Feild opened a general merchandise store at the same time as the mill, located across Broad Street. He built a log house for his family, which also served as an inn for travelers and customers. By 1860, the nucleus of the future city existed. The first post office was established that year, with Julian Feild as postmaster.

During the American Civil War, the Man and Feild Mill supplied meal and flour to the Confederate States Army, hauling it to Shreveport, Louisiana, and Jefferson City, Missouri. As was common practice, the owners tithed ten percent of the mill&#x27;s production to the Confederacy. The small community around the mill was unique in Tarrant County in that it prospered throughout the Civil War. &quot;Feild&#x27;s Freighters&quot;, assembled in ox-drawn wagon trains, went as far as Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where a part of the Indian Wars raged in the southern plains in the late 1860s and 1870s.

The prospering community which had grown up around the Man and Feild mill took on the name of &quot;Mansfeild&quot;, a combination of the names of the founders. Repeated misspellings over the years resulted in the acceptance of the conventional spelling of &quot;Mansfield.&quot; The town incorporated in 1890, continuing to be a hub for the surrounding farmland.

In 1956, a federal court ordered the Mansfield Independent School District to desegregate; the first such order in Texas. Protests by 300 whites in front of Mansfield High School, to prevent three black students from enrolling, touched off one of the longest-running desegregation battles of the Civil Rights Movement. Mansfield&#x27;s school quietly desegregated in 1965 as it faced a lack of federal funds.

<text>Venus is a city in Johnson and Ellis counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 4,361 in 2020.

==History==

The town was originally named &quot;Gossip&quot; until its development in the late 1880s. A man by the name of J.C. Smythe purchased of abandoned cornfields in the northeastern corner of Johnson County and began to plan a townsite. He named his new town &quot;Venus&quot; after the daughter of a local doctor. By 1888 the new town had a post office and a population of around 10 residents. Being at the junction of two major railroads, Venus prospered and for a time was one of the fastest-growing communities in Johnson County. By the 1920s, Venus had its own schools (including a small college), several businesses, a weekly newspaper (the &quot;Venus Express&quot;), and a population that exceeded 800.

The Great Depression had massive negative impact, however, and in the 1930s the town began to decline. Growth of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex just to the north hastened its decline, with many of its residents relocating to the growing urban area in search of work. By 1940 the population had fallen to 200, and the only remaining operating business was the drug store.

Venus began to recover somewhat in the late 1940s, and the population soon increased back to over 300. Growth was slow but steady throughout the remainder of the 20th century; by 1990 there were 977 residents and the town had spread into neighboring Ellis County. The 2000 census listed the population as 910, but the population more than tripled to 2,960 in 2010, due largely to the southward expansion of the Metroplex.

==Geography==

Venus is located in northeastern Johnson County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

U.S. Route 67 passes through the town north of its center; the highway leads northeast to the center of Midlothian and west to Alvarado. Downtown Dallas and Fort Worth are each away, Dallas to the northeast and Fort Worth to the northwest.

===Climate===

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Venus has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,361 people, 909 households, and 740 families residing in the town.
==Education==

Venus is served by Venus Independent School District (www.venusisd.net), with grades K–1 attending Venus Primary School, 2–5 attending Venus Elementary, 6–8 attending Venus Middle School, and 9–12 attending Venus High School. The small portion of Venus that lies in Ellis County is served by the Midlothian Independent School District or Maypearl Independent School District.

<doc id="151177" wikidata="Q982016" url="?curid=151177" title="Bruceville-Eddy, Texas">
<text>Bruceville-Eddy is a city in McLennan and Falls counties in the U.S. state of Texas. Its population was 1,413 at the 2020 census.

Most of the city is in McLennan County and is part of the Waco metropolitan statistical area. A small southern portion is in Falls County.

==Geography==

Bruceville-Eddy is located in southwestern McLennan County and is situated along Interstate 35, south of Waco and north of Temple. Access is available from Exit 315 (the Eddy or southern end of town) and Exit 318 (the Bruceville or northern end). Texas State Highway 7 leads east from Exit 315 to Marlin.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The community of Bruceville-Eddy began as two separate settlements: Bruceville and Eddy. Both communities became stations on the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad (Katy Railroad) in 1882.

===Bruceville===
Bruceville was named for Lucien N. Bruce, who donated land for the railroad station. Most of Bruceville&#x27;s residents came from the community of Mastersville, located two miles to the north, that the railroad had bypassed. By 1900, Bruceville had approximately 289 residents and several businesses. An independent school district was formed in 1904. A bank operated in Bruceville from 1907 to 1927. The community had a population around 500 during the 1930s and 1940s, but began to decline in the postwar years. By 1964, the number of inhabitants had fallen to 175 and decreased to just 25 in 1970.

===Eddy===
Initially known as &quot;Marvin&quot;, the community was renamed after the railroad arrived in 1882, to honor rail division superintendent Everett B. Eddy. By the mid-1880s, the community was home to 150 people, three general stores, two churches, a school, and a gristmill. Throughout the 1890s, Eddy continued to experience rapid growth, with some estimates placing the total population as high as 700. A bank opened in 1901 and received a national charter in 1915. In 1928, the schools in Bruceville and Eddy were consolidated, the first such merger in McLennan County. By the late 1920s, Eddy had roughly 450 residents. The population declined to 350 by the mid-1940s, but rose to around 600 in the 1960s as road improvements made commuting easier for locals.

===Incorporation===
In April 1974, the communities of Bruceville and Eddy incorporated as a single entity known as Bruceville-Eddy. The population stood at 1,038 in 1980 and grew slightly to 1,075 by 1990. That figure rose further, to 1,490, by 2000.

Owing to its unique history, Bruceville-Eddy operated two separate post offices after it was incorporated. Eddy&#x27;s post office, located at 100 Franklin Road, operates under the ZIP code 76524. The post office in Bruceville was located at 203 First Street and had the ZIP code 76630. On June 1, 2009, it was closed due to foundation problems that caused the building to be deemed unsafe. All postal operations were transferred to Eddy.

==Demographics==

<text>Whitewright is a town in Fannin and Grayson Counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 1,725 at the 2020 census, up from 1,604 at the 2010 census.

The Grayson County portion of Whitewright is part of the Sherman–Denison Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The settlement was established in 1878, when New York investor and financier William Whitewright Jr. (1815–1898), after whom the community was named, purchased a tract of land in the path of the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, which was then extending its tracks across the county from Sherman to Greenville. Whitewright had the land surveyed as a townsite and left two of his agents, Jim Reeves and Jim Batsell, to sell lots in the new community. Likely due to the combination of its rail connection and its location in the center of perhaps the richest farmland in the county near the headwaters of Bois d&#x27; Arc Creek, Whitewright soon attracted settlers and businesses.

Within 10 years of its founding, the community had incorporated and supported a private school, Grayson College, a public school, a newspaper, and several businesses, including three hotels, two cotton gins, and two banks. Jas. A. Batsell served as the first postmaster beginning on April 8, 1878. In 1885, Peter McKenna took over as postmaster, and the facility was officially commissioned as the Whitewright post office on December 7, 1888.

By 1900, the population of Whitewright was 1,804. Although the population declined slightly, to 1,563 in 1910 and 1,666 in 1920, the business community flourished. By the mid-1920s, both the Missouri-Kansas-Texas and the Cotton Belt served the town, and 68 businesses, including two banks and manufacturers of cottonseed oil and flour, operated locally. Whitewright served as a marketing, retail, and commercial center for the farmers of the surrounding area, who produced such crops as cotton, wheat, and corn.

The population rose from 1,480 in 1936 to 1,537 by the late 1940s. The number of businesses, however, declined from 60 to 46. During the 1970s and 1980s, seven factories, producing goods ranging from sausage to clothing to fertilizers, employed local workers. By 1989, Whitewright had 26 businesses, and in 1990, the population was 1,713. In 2000, the community had 1,740 inhabitants and 106 businesses.

===1911 Fire===

On June 12, 1911, a fire that started in a trash pile and was fanned by high winds destroyed most of the Whitewright business district. Along with the fire station and city hall, 43 business were destroyed and 75 residences were damaged, 27 of those destroyed. Units from the Denison and Sherman fire departments were called to assist, but the fire was reported under control before the Sherman department could get underway.

===Quedlinburg treasures===

Whitewright was the home of US Lieutenant Joe Tom Meador, who after World War II looted several major pieces of art from a cave near Quedlinburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. On April 19, 1945, American troops occupied Quedlinburg. Various treasures of art were secured in a cave near the castle Altenburg. Meador was responsible for the security of the cave. Meador, a soldier with good knowledge of art, recognized the importance of the treasures (among them being the Gospel of Samuel and the Crystals of Constantinople). He sent the treasures to Whitewright via army mail, and the art was placed in a safe at the First National Bank of Whitewright.

Meador died in 1980, and his heirs tried to sell 10 pieces of &quot;Beutekunst&quot; (looted art) on the international art market. After a long search and judicial processes, the art was returned to Germany in 1992 and were investigated because of damages to the pieces. At first, those stolen artifacts were exhibited in Munich and Berlin, but were finally returned to Quedlinburg in 1993. However, two of the pieces stolen by Meador are still in the United States at an unknown location.

<doc id="151181" wikidata="Q974536" url="?curid=151181" title="Cinco Ranch, Texas">
<text>Cinco Ranch is a census-designated place and master-planned community located in the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the city of Houston within Fort Bend and Harris counties in the U.S. state of Texas. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 4.9 square miles (12.8 km2).The population was 16,899 at the 2020 census. It lies approximately west of the Harris County seat of Houston and north of the Fort Bend County seat of Richmond. Cinco Ranch is considered to be part of the Greater Katy area and is roughly 10 miles southeast of the city of Katy.

== History ==

The Cinco Ranch community goes back to before Texas became a republic. In the 1820s, pioneer Moses Austin was granted by the Spanish government the authority to settle 300 families in the valleys of the Brazos and Colorado rivers. He died before he was able to accomplish this, but his son Stephen F. Austin was able to complete his father&#x27;s wishes, even under the newly established Mexican government. One of the men who moved into these 300 slots of land (each one over ) was Randolph Foster, whose land spread across Fort Bend and Waller counties and upon which Native Americans lived along with wild horses, deer, and buffalo. 

Foster&#x27;s daughter married Thomas Blakeley, cattleman and future sheriff of Fort Bend County. Their son, Bassett Blakeley, took after his father and grandfather and soon grew into a cowboy and cattleman. Bassett Blakeley owned of land and 14,000 head of Brahman cattle, along with his grandfather&#x27;s land. The cowhands of his Blakeley Ranch annually drove 10,000 head of cattle to the railheads in Kansas.

In 1937, Blakeley sold the working ranch to William Wheless, who convinced four of his friends, J.S. Abercrombie, W.B. Pryon, H.G. Nelms, and R.A Ramos to become partners at the ranch. In a nod to its Spanish roots, they called it Cinco Ranch (&quot;cinco&quot; means &quot;five&quot; in Spanish). Only the Wheless family lived on the ranch, but all of the families visited on many holidays and weekends, making use of a huge clubhouse complete with two-bedroom wings. The ranch was not merely involved in cattle—it also had several acres of rice—for years, the main output of Katy, Texas—and peanut production.

In February 1984, the largest raw land transaction in the history of Houston took place when Cinco Ranch Venture, consisting of U. S. Home, the Mischer Corporation, and American General Corporation, purchased Cinco Ranch for a master-planned development. American General eventually bought out the other partners. In 1997, Cinco Ranch and other American General land development assets were purchased by Terrabrook, a wholly owned subsidiary of real estate investor Westbrook Partners. In 2003, Cinco Ranch and other Terrabrook developments were purchased by San Diego–based Newland Real Estate, LLC (Newland). Also in 2003, Newland purchased west of the Grand Parkway (SH-99) and contiguous to Cinco Ranch. This acquisition along with several smaller parcels that were subsequently purchased by Newland ultimately increased the size of Cinco Ranch to approximately . In 2010, Newland purchased an additional for future Cinco Ranch expansion. This land is located at the intersection of FM 1463 and Corbitt Road, and is not contiguous with the rest of Cinco Ranch. Cinco Ranch now totals and is expected to have over 14,000 homes at build-out, which is currently projected to be around 2016.

===Public libraries===
Cinco Ranch is served by the Cinco Ranch Branch Library of the Fort Bend County Libraries system, located across from Cinco Ranch High School and one block from Texas State Highway 99 (Grand Parkway). The library first opened as the Katy/Fort Bend Branch Library in a room on the campus of the University of Houston System at Cinco Ranch in June 1998. In 1999 the branch, which outgrew its first location, moved to the former Cinco Ranch development company sales office as a result of the efforts of the Katy/Fort Bend Friends. The community asked for a larger library, and Fort Bend County judge Jim Adolphus organized efforts to have a library established. Adolphus negotiated the donation of a library site from Terrabrook, a developer in Cinco Ranch, and secured a challenge grant. In addition, Adolphus and Fort Bend County judge candidate Bob Hebert co-hosted a fundraising gala for the challenge grant. The Cinco Ranch community, led by the Katy/Fort Bend Friends association, worked with Fort Bend County officials to find funds for the construction of a new library. The current library opened on April 3, 2004.

<doc id="151182" wikidata="Q981796" url="?curid=151182" title="Katy, Texas">
<text>Katy is a city in the U.S. state of Texas. It is in the Greater Katy area, itself forming the western part of the Greater Houston metropolitan area. Homes and businesses may have Katy postal addresses without being in the City of Katy. The city of Katy is approximately centered at the tripoint of Harris, Fort Bend, and Waller counties. The population was 21,894 at the 2020 census.

First formally settled in the mid-1890s, Katy was a railroad town along the Missouri–Kansas–Texas (MKT) Railroad which ran parallel to U.S. Route 90 (today Interstate 10) into downtown Houston. Katy obtained its name when the MKT Railroad dropped its Missouri waypoint and the junction became known as the KT stop. The fertile floodplain of Buffalo Bayou, which has its source near Katy, and its tributaries made Katy and other communities in the surrounding prairie an attractive location for rice farming. Beginning in the 1960s, the rapid growth of Houston moved westward along the new Interstate 10 corridor, bringing Katy into its environs. Today, Katy lies at the center of a broader area known as Greater Katy, which has become heavily urbanized.

While largely subsumed into Greater Houston, the town of Katy is still notable for Katy Mills Mall, Katy High School&#x27;s football dominance (eight state-championships), and its historic town square along the former right-of-way of the MKT railroad.

==History==

The City of Katy sits on Karankawa tribal lands. European colonist&#x27;s first record of contact with tribe is in 1528. Over the next 250 years the area was trafficked by French and Spanish European colonists seeking land and trade opportunities. By 1779, the Karakawa were at war with Spanish settlers. In 1790 the war ended and shortly after settlement begins.

In the early 1800s Katy came be to be known as &quot;Cane Island&quot;, named for the creek that runs through the area, a branch of Buffalo Bayou. The creek was filled with tall cane, not native to the area. It was presumed to have been planted by either the Karankawa Indians or Spanish explorers to aid in fur trapping until the 1820s.

In 1845 James J. Crawford received a land grant that included this area. The hot summers and thick clay soil made it difficult to attract settlers to the area. Freed slaves and their families including Thomas (Mary) Robinson and Milto McGinnis, along with Mr. Crawford, Peter Black, and John Sills were the only recorded residents of Cane Island in 1875.

In 1895, James Oliver Thomas laid out a town, and in January 1896 the town of Katy was named through Thomas&#x27;s post office application. The name &quot;Katy&quot; was derived from the MKT Railroad Company, which was commonly referred to as &quot;the K-T&quot; (also its stock exchange symbol). This common designation soon evolved into &quot;the Katy&quot;, and since the railroad company and its trains held a key depot station located today&#x27;s city, the general location came to be known as Katy.
The anticipations of prosperity would bring growth to the new town which was developed around the original train stop and railroad tracks. By the early 1900s many families had come by train and wagon to establish Katy. Cotton and peanuts and corn were the first successful crops, but rice soon became the primary commodity crop. Katy later became known for rice farming; the first concrete rice driers in the state of Texas were built here in 1944 and still stand as landmarks. The farming community well supported local businesses as several hotels, stores, livery stables and saloons were prospering.

On September 8, 1900, the town&#x27;s early efforts were swept clean by the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900, the deadliest hurricane in U.S. history. All but three of the original Katy homes were lost in the storm—The Wright House, The Featherson House, and The Morrison-Freeman House. Despite this, three major homes were built in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane and another six more over the following decade. Cane Island was rebuilt quickly and continued to grow.

Humble Oil opens the Katy Gas Field in 1943, which goes on to become one of the principal suppliers of allied forces and eventually becomes one of the most productive gas fields in the State of Texas. Today, what was Humble Oil is now Exxon which continues to operate and oversee the expansive underground pipeline network in the region.

In 1945 the City of Katy was incorporated. C. L. Baird was the first mayor. The city&#x27;s limits were determined by finding the area that contained the most residents and was reasonably sized so that it could be managed by city services.

The construction and opening of Interstate 10 in 1966 allowed for rapid development of the area, as Houston expanded westward. Large sections of the K-T railway are removed to allow for the I-10 expansion, officially marking the end of passenger rail through the region. I-10 is widened further in 2008 to 14 lanes with TXDOT plans for additional widening forthcoming.

==Geography==
The City of Katy is located at the three-border junction of Harris, Fort Bend, and Waller counties, along Interstate 10, west of downtown Houston and east of Sealy. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Katy is often further defined as either &quot;Old Towne Katy&quot; or &quot;Greater Katy&quot;. Old Towne Katy refers to the portion of Katy that was incorporated in 1945. Its boundaries, as defined by the Katy Independent School Divisions zoning, run just south of Kingsland Blvd, stretching across Interstate 10 to Morton Road. Katy Fort Bend Road and Cane Island Creek act as the east and west boundaries, The Greater Katy area includes the city of Katy plus large sections of unincorporated land surrounding the city corresponding to the boundaries of the Katy Independent School District.

Greater Katy includes communities such as Cinco Ranch, Green Trails, Grayson Lakes, Seven Meadows, Pine Mill Ranch, Silver Ranch, Firethorne, Grand Lakes, and Young Ranch. It also encompasses suburban developments from the 1970s and 1980s, such as Memorial Parkway, Kelliwood and Nottingham Country.

Old Towne Katy&#x27;s new residential communities include Pin Oak Village, The Falls at Green Meadows, Cane Island and The Enclave. Large developments underway have included new residential communities boarding the east border of Mary Joe Peckham Park and the Katy Boardwalk. The City of Katy&#x27;s government has also placed a large focus on the downtown redevelopment plan which included the new city hall building and an upcoming downtown green space. Further projects included Typhoon Texas Water Park, Katy Independent School District&#x27;s Legacy Football Stadium, Katy Independent School District&#x27;s Rhodes Stadium, Momentum Indoor Climbing Center, REI Climb Store and the YMCA at Katy Main Street.

The City of Houston&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction stretches well west of Katy. This means that a few unincorporated lands in the Katy area could be annexed by the City of Houston at some time in the future, though it is unlikely since Houston is unable to provide basic services to these isolated areas. The city of Katy&#x27;s extraterritorial jurisdiction, meanwhile, is limited to parcels of land west and north of the city itself.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Katy has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. The area is located in the Western Gulf Coastal Grasslands, or the coastal prairie.

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, there were 21,894 people, 7,199 households, 5,804 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 7,563 housing units. The racial makeup of the city was 59.3% White, 6.8% African American, 0.7% Native American, 7.8% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 9.9% from some other races and 15.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino residents of any race were 28.0% of the population.

Places of worship in the modern-day Katy area represent non-denominations as well as the denominations of Catholicism, Islam, Latter-Day Saints, Judaism, Hinduism, and Protestantism.

==Economy==
Several corporations are headquartered in areas surrounding Katy.

Igloo Corporation is headquartered west of Katy in unincorporated Waller County. Academy Sports and Outdoors has its corporate offices and product distribution center in unincorporated western Harris County.

BP America is headquartered in the Houston Energy Corridor and is the area&#x27;s largest employer, with 5,500 employees on its Westlake campus as of 2009. BP&#x27;s Katy operations include engineering and business support for much of BP&#x27;s onshore operations in the contiguous United States, as well as its operations in the Gulf of Mexico.

In 2017, Amazon constructed a 1 million-square-foot distribution center near the intersection of Highway 90 and Woods Road. In 2021, it was estimated that new development projects were near completion to stimulate the local economy.

With the economy improving after 2009, retail centers were developed throughout Katy to accommodate the rapid residential growth. The major retail growth is taking place along Katy Fort Bend Road near the east entrance to the Katy Mills shopping mall. In August 2010, H-E-B Food &amp; Drug opened a new store at I-10 and Pin Oak. In July 2013, Costco announced that it would open a store at the southwest corner of Grand Parkway and I-10 in 2014. Construction began in August 2013. The new store was planned for completion by early spring 2014 and would be Costco&#x27;s fourth Houston-area location.

In September 2018, Katy Asian Town, in proximity to the City of Katy, was established. This multicultural dining, shopping and residential area is anchored by Asian grocer, HMart and Japanese book retailer Kinokuniya. Cultural activities held in Katy Asian Town include Chinese New Year with lion dancing performances, as well as open market art and comics events outside Kinokuniya. Katy Asian Town is also home to the Andretti Indoor Karting and Games facility, featuring kart racing, video gaming, virtual reality attractions and dining.
The Katy Area Economic Development Council serves as the economic development organization for the area. Founded in 2003, the Katy Area Economic Development Council&#x27;s (Katy Area EDC) mission is to establish the Katy area as the premier location for families and businesses through planned economic growth and economic development. Since its inception, the Katy Area EDC has grown to over 210 members, has a budget of $900,000 and has assisted in the creation of over 16,200 jobs and more than $2.5 billion in capital investment. Katy Area EDC is a full-service private, non-profit, 501 (c) 6 economic development corporation.

==Government and infrastructure==
Katy is a home-rule city, chartered in 1945. Residents within the city limits are governed by a nonpartisan city council made up of five councilmembers and the mayor. The city is split into two wards; two council members are elected from each ward, and one council member and the mayor are elected at-large. The mayor appoints a councilmember to serve as mayor pro tempore with a council vote of approval.

Residents within the city limits pay city taxes and receive municipal police, fire, EMS, and public works service. The city has territory in three counties, each of which has its own representative governments. The counties have a greater influence on area outside the incorporated city limits.

The Katy area lies in three counties. Residents in unincorporated Harris, Fort Bend and Waller counties are governed by those counties. The county residents elect representative county commissioners who represent them on the county courts of each county, presided over by the county judge of each county.

Harris County Precinct Three, headed by Tom Ramsey as of 2021, serves the Harris County portion of Katy. The Fort Bend County portion of Katy is under Fort Bend County Precinct Three headed by Andy Meyers.

Harris Health System (Harris County&#x27;s hospital district) operates the Danny Jackson Health Center in the Bear Hunter Plaza in a nearby area of Harris County. Fort Bend County does not have a hospital district. OakBend Medical Center serves as the county&#x27;s charity hospital which the county contracts with.

<text>Turpentine (which is also called spirit of turpentine, oil of turpentine, terebenthine, terebenthene, terebinthine and, colloquially, turps) is a fluid obtained by the distillation of resin harvested from living trees, mainly pines. Principally used as a specialized solvent, it is also a source of material for organic syntheses.

Turpentine is composed of terpenes, primarily the monoterpenes alpha- and beta-pinene, with lesser amounts of carene, camphene, limonene, and terpinolene. 

Substitutes include white spirit or other petroleum distillates – although the constituent chemicals are very different.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;turpentine&quot; derives (via French and Latin) from the Greek word, &quot;τερεβινθίνη&quot;, &quot;terebinthine&quot; in English, in turn the feminine form (to conform to the feminine gender of the Greek word, which means &#x27;resin&#x27;) of an adjective (τερεβίνθινος) derived from the Greek noun (τερέβινθος) for the terebinth tree.

Although the word originally referred to the resinous exudate of terebinth trees (e.g. Chios turpentine, Cyprus turpentine, and Persian turpentine), it now refers to that of coniferous trees, namely crude turpentine (e.g. Venice turpentine is the oleoresin of larch), or the volatile oil part thereof, namely oil (spirit) of turpentine; the latter usage is much more common today.

==Source trees==


Important pines for turpentine production include: maritime pine (&quot;Pinus pinaster&quot;), Aleppo pine (&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;), Masson&#x27;s pine (&quot;Pinus massoniana&quot;), Sumatran pine (&quot;Pinus merkusii&quot;), longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;), loblolly pine (&quot;Pinus taeda&quot;), slash pine (&quot;Pinus elliottii&quot;), and ponderosa pine (&quot;Pinus ponderosa&quot;).

==Converting crude turpentine to oil of turpentine==

Crude turpentine collected from the trees may be evaporated by steam distillation in a copper still. Molten rosin remains in the still bottoms after turpentine has been distilled out. Such turpentine is called gum turpentine. The term &quot;gum turpentine&quot; may also refer to crude turpentine, which may cause some confusion.

Turpentine may alternatively be extracted from destructive distillation of pine wood, such as shredded pine stumps, roots, and slash, using the light end of the heavy naphtha fraction (boiling between ) from a crude oil refinery. Such turpentine is called wood turpentine. Multi-stage counter-current extraction is commonly used so fresh naphtha first contacts wood leached in previous stages and naphtha laden with turpentine from previous stages contacts fresh wood before vacuum distillation to recover naphtha from the turpentine. Leached wood is steamed for additional naphtha recovery prior to burning for energy recovery.

=== Sulfate turpentine ===
When producing chemical wood pulp from pines or other coniferous trees, sulfate turpentine may be condensed from the gas generated in Kraft process pulp digesters. The average yield of crude sulfate turpentine is 5–10 kg/t pulp. Unless burned at the mill for energy production, sulfate turpentine may require additional treatment measures to remove traces of sulfur compounds.

==Industrial and other end uses==

===Solvent===
As a solvent, turpentine is used for thinning oil-based paints, for producing varnishes, and as a raw material for the chemical industry. Its use as a solvent in industrialized nations has largely been replaced by the much cheaper turpentine substitutes obtained from petroleum such as white spirit. A solution of turpentine and beeswax or carnauba wax has long been used as a furniture wax.

===Lighting===
Spirits of turpentine, called camphine, was burned in lamps with glass chimneys in the 1830s through the 1860s. Turpentine blended with grain alcohol was known as burning fluid. Both were used as domestic lamp fuels, gradually replacing whale oil, until kerosene, gas lighting and electric lights began to predominate.

===Source of organic compounds===
Turpentine is also used as a source of raw materials in the synthesis of fragrant chemical compounds. Commercially used camphor, linalool, alpha-terpineol, and geraniol are all usually produced from alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, which are two of the chief chemical components of turpentine. These pinenes are separated and purified by distillation. The mixture of diterpenes and triterpenes that is left as residue after turpentine distillation is sold as rosin.

===Niche uses===
* Turpentine is also added to many cleaning and sanitary products due to its antiseptic properties and its &quot;clean scent&quot;. 
* In early 19th-century America, spirits of turpentine (camphine) was burned in lamps as a cheap alternative to whale oil. It produced a bright light but had a strong odour. Camphine and burning fluid (a mix of alcohol and turpentine) served as the dominant lamp fuels replacing whale oil until the advent of kerosene, electric lights and gas lighting. 
* Honda motorcycles, first manufactured in 1946, ran on a blend of gasoline and turpentine, due to the scarcity of gasoline in Japan following World War II. The French Emeraude rocket uses a similar fuel mixture. Turpentine has also been researched as a potential biofuel for mixing into gasoline.
* In his book &quot;If Only They Could Talk&quot;, veterinarian and author James Herriot describes the use of the reaction of turpentine with resublimed iodine to &quot;drive the iodine into the tissue&quot;, or perhaps just impress the watching customer with a spectacular treatment (a dense cloud of purple smoke).

==Safety and health considerations==

Turpentine is highly flammable, so much so that it has been considered as an automotive fuel.

Turpentine was added extensively into gin during the Gin Craze.

Turpentine&#x27;s vapour can irritate the skin and eyes, damage the lungs and respiratory system, as well as the central nervous system when inhaled, and cause damage to the renal system when ingested, among other things. Ingestion can cause burning sensations, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, convulsions, diarrhea, tachycardia, unconsciousness, respiratory failure, and chemical pneumonia. 

The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for turpentine exposure in the workplace as 100 ppm (560 mg/m3) over an 8-hour workday. The same threshold was adopted by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) as the recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 800 ppm (4480 mg/m3), turpentine is immediately dangerous to life and health.

===Folk medicine===
Turpentine and petroleum distillates such as coal oil and kerosene, were used in folk medicine for abrasions and wounds, as a treatment for lice, and when mixed with animal fat, as a chest rub or inhaler for nasal and throat ailments. Vicks chest rubs still contain turpentine in their formulations, although not as an active ingredient.

Turpentine, now understood to be dangerous for consumption, was a common medicine among seamen during the Age of Discovery. It was one of several products carried aboard Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s fleet during the first circumnavigation of the globe. Taken internally it was used as a treatment for intestinal parasites. This is dangerous, due to the chemical&#x27;s toxicity.

Turpentine enemas, a very harsh purgative, had formerly been used for stubborn constipation or impaction. They were also given punitively to political dissenters in post-independence Argentina.

<text>Mission Bend is a census-designated place (CDP) around Texas State Highway 6 within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of Houston in Fort Bend and Harris counties in the U.S. state of Texas; Mission Bend is northwest of the city hall of Sugar Land and southwest of Downtown Houston. The population was 36,914 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Mission Bend began in the early 1980s. The area gained population between 1980 and 1990. In 1990, the community had 24,945 residents. By 2000, many of the area&#x27;s residents commuted to Houston.

The City of Houston did a limited purpose annexation of a portion of the Mission Bend area after the year 2000, therefore reducing the CDP&#x27;s territory.

==Geography==

Mission Bend is located at (29.693667, -95.661721).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.41%, is water.

==Demographics==
Mission Bend first appeared as a census designated place in the 1990 U.S. Census.

===2020 census===
As of the 2020 United States census, there were 36,914 people, 10,864 households, and 8,997 families residing in the CDP.

<text>Missouri City is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, within the metropolitan area. The city is mostly in Fort Bend County, with a small portion in Harris County. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 74,259, an increase over the figure of 67,358 tabulated in 2010. 

== History ==
The area in which Missouri City is now located holds a significant part in the history of Texas that dates back to its early days as part of the United States. In August 1853, the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway (BBB&amp;C), began operating its first of rail line that stretched from Harrisburg (now Houston) to Stafford&#x27;s Point (now Stafford). It was the first railroad to begin operating in Texas, and the first standard gauge railroad west of the Mississippi River.

The railway continued its extension westward until, in 1883, it linked with its eastward counterpart, completing the Sunset Route from Los Angeles to New Orleans. Today, the route of the BBB&amp;C (now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad) is still an important and heavily operated railroad line.

In 1890, two real estate investors from Houston (R. M. Cash and L. E. Luckle) purchased of land directly on the route of the BBB&amp;C, only a mile and a half from its first stop at Stafford&#x27;s Point. They advertised the property as &quot;a land of genial sunshine and eternal summer&quot; in St. Louis, Missouri, and its surrounding areas. Three years later, W. R. McElroy purchased in the same vicinity, and in an effort to promote the area jointly with Cash and Luckle in St. Louis, he named it &quot;Missouri City&quot;. Its first settlers were, however, from Arlington, Texas, between Dallas and Fort Worth.

The settlement was officially registered in Texas in 1894, and began to take shape as a railroad town along Main Street and Blue Ridge Road, now known as US 90A and Texas Parkway, respectively. Its growth took an unexpected turn when, on February 14, 1895, shortly after the first group of settlers had arrived, the town was hit with a blizzard. This discouraged some of the newcomers, who gave up and moved elsewhere. Those unwavered stayed and found success in farming and ranching.

Among its first businesses were a blacksmith shop, a depot, and a general store, which also housed the first post office. The first Catholic church was built in 1913, but was destroyed by a hurricane in 1915. The new church built to replace it stood until 1990.

Oil was discovered at Blue Ridge southeast of town in 1919; soon after, a salt mine opened there. Missouri City became the railroad shipping point for these two resources. In 1925, at the same location, natural gas was discovered. After a pipeline had been constructed the following year, Missouri City became the first town in Fort Bend County to make use of natural gas.

With the benefit of a railroad, Missouri City had already been home to commuters who, by train, traveled to adjacent towns such as Stafford&#x27;s Point and Sugar Land to work. With the increase of automobiles and the improvement of roads and highways in the early part of the 20th century, the developing community of Missouri City gradually attracted a wealth of newcomers. This gave birth to a new generation of commuters, replacing railroad commuting that eventually became obsolete. By the 1950s, the town began to take shape as a notable &quot;bedroom community&quot; suburb of Houston.

After fear and rumor spread of possible annexation of the unincorporated town by Houston, town leaders scrambled to piece together a city government. On March 13, 1956, the community that began as a small settlement more than 55 years earlier was incorporated.

Missouri City has since seen tremendous economic growth, moving eastward, southward, and then westward. The city was first made over by Fondren Park (in Harris County), near US 90A, in the early 1960s, followed by Quail Valley, along Cartwright Road between Texas Parkway and Murphy Road, in the late 1960s. Unlike neighboring Houston, Missouri City has been a zoned city since 1981. Multifamily complexes (e.g. apartments and condominiums) are a rare find because of the current zoning ordinance.
In the 1980s, an influx of middle-class African Americans – most of them first-time homeowners – were attracted to developing communities south and west of Houston. Many of them made the subdivisions of Missouri City home. Teal Run and other unincorporated areas east of Highway 6 became ethnically diverse before neighborhoods farther west. Many of the newcomers were employees within nearby Houston work centers (e.g., Texas Medical Center and Greenway Plaza). In 2000, Missouri City was named a model city for middle-class African Americans by Black Entertainment Television. Today, Missouri City is a prime example of wealthy, majority-Black suburbs in the U.S.

The Missouri City area&#x27;s recent upscale, master-planned residential developments include Lake Olympia, south of Quail Valley, and portions of Riverstone, south of State Highway 6. The nearby unincorporated area of Sienna Plantation, also located south of Highway 6, is situated on and around land once occupied by plantations, where among other things, sugarcane and cotton were harvested.

In 2018 Yolanda Ford became the first black mayor and first female mayor of Missouri City. In 2020, Ford lost her campaign for reelection.

<text>Stafford is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, in the metropolitan area. The city is mostly in Fort Bend County, with a small part in Harris County. As of the 2020 census, Stafford&#x27;s population was 17,666, down from 17,693 at the 2010 census.

==History==
William Stafford established a plantation with a cane mill and a horse-powered cotton gin in 1830. On April 15, 1836, during the Texas Revolution, the forces of Antonio López de Santa Anna stopped at Stafford&#x27;s plantation and ordered it burned. Stafford rebuilt his plantation and resided there until his 1840 death. A settlement called &quot;Stafford&#x27;s Point&quot; was established around the plantation; it became a townsite in August 1853, when the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos and Colorado Railway began stopping there. Stafford&#x27;s Point had a post office from 1854 to 1869. &quot;Staffordville&quot; had a post office from January 5 to February 26, 1869. The settlement, now known as Stafford, operated a post office from 1869 to 1918; the post office reopened in 1929.

In 1884, Stafford had 50 residents, two general stores, and a grocer. By 1896, it had a population of 300. By 1914, the population fell to 100. In 1931, 320 people lived in Stafford. This increased to 400 in 1946. Stafford incorporated as a city in 1956.

==Geography==
Stafford is in eastern Fort Bend County at (29.624186, –95.563359). A small part of the city extends northeast into Harris County. It is bordered by Houston to the north, Meadows Place to the northwest, Sugar Land to the west, and Missouri City to the south and east.

The Southwest Freeway (Interstate 69) passes through northwest Stafford, leading northeast to the center of Houston and southwest to Rosenberg. U.S. 90 Alternate passes through Stafford as Main Street, leading west to Sugar Land and northeast to the Houston East End.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Stafford has an area of , of which is land and , or 0.58%, is water.

===Climate===

Stafford&#x27;s climate is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Stafford has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

===Extraterritorial jurisdiction===

Stafford has two areas of extraterritorial jurisdiction. They are within the Houston Independent School District, including an area at Beltway 8 and Stafford Road and another area between Beltway 8 and Murphy Road. One area within the Alief Independent School District is next to the City of Meadows Place along Interstate 69/U.S. Route 59. Areas in the Fort Bend Independent School District include part of Fifth Street and an area around U.S. Route 90 Alternate, Dulles Avenue, and Avenue E. The City of Stafford has avoided annexing these areas, because doing so would give it territory in school districts other than the Stafford Municipal School District (SMSD) and the city wants its city limits and the SMSD to have the same area. The SMSD cannot annex these areas without the other school districts&#x27; permission.

==Economy==
Stafford has not had a municipal property tax since 1995. Though it is known as a bedroom community of the greater Houston area, an estimated four times as many people work in Stafford on a weekday, which is evidence of the large amount of commercial activity that helps the city financially. Many corporations large and small, including FedEx, UPS and Tyco, maintain significant operations in Stafford.
Originally, Stafford was an agricultural community. As of 2009, it has operations from commercial, manufacturing, retail, service, and wholesale industries that pay sales and franchise taxes to the city. Stafford is known internationally for attracting valve manufacturing companies; it has 11. Stafford has 15 business parks, a shopping center, and 19 hotels and motels.

Texas Instruments (TI) operates a production facility in Stafford, where it manufactures wafers used in cell phones, high-definition televisions, and solar devices. The plant first opened in 1967. In 2009, TI, which had around 1,500 employees in its Stafford office that year, was the city&#x27;s largest employer. In 2012, the company announced it was closing its Stafford plant because industry demand for larger, more efficient wafers increased and the company, in lieu of upgrading the Stafford plant to accommodate production of larger wafers, opted to shift production to newer plants. Of the 1,000 employees at the plant during that year, TI laid off 500 and sent 500 to another facility. Mayor Leonard Scarcella said the closure would adversely affect Stafford.

About 15 years ago, TI comprised about 25% of the city&#x27;s economy and by 2012, it stood at about one-tenth of that, or 2.5%. Some jobs at the plant were scheduled to end in July 2012.

==Government and infrastructure==

===Local government===
The City of Stafford stopped levying nonschool property taxes in 1995. It is the only Houston-area city and the most populous city in Texas to do so. Sales and franchise taxes from businesses fund the city.

From 1969 to 2020, Stafford&#x27;s mayor was Leonard Scarcella. By 2018, he was the longest-serving mayor in the United States. On June 28, 2020, Scarcella died at age 79. In December 2020, Cecil Willis was elected mayor.

The Stafford City Hall, Stafford Police Department, and Municipal Court buildings are on South Main, adjacent to one another. The Stafford Volunteer Fire Department operates out of three fire stations.

The city is governed by its Home Rule Charter, which resembles the US Constitution. The Charter Review Commission reviews the charter every five years. The most recent review was in 2018. The commission consisted of:

Ash Hamirani

Jonathan Montoya

Hector Acevedo

Christeen Seymour

Lawrence Vaccaro Jr.

Vice Chairperson Ettienne Zak

Chairperson Robert Sorbet

== Education ==
=== Colleges and universities ===
Stafford MSD (and therefore the city) is served by the Houston Community College System. The HCCS Southwest College includes the Stafford Campus at 10041 Cash Road. In spring 2012, the enrollment at the Stafford Campus was 8,139. Stafford is also home to North American University, a small private university with an enrollment of roughly 800 students.

=== Primary and secondary schools ===
==== Public schools ====
The city has the only municipal school district (Stafford Municipal School District) in all of Texas. In 1977, Stafford broke away from the Fort Bend Independent School District (FBISD), which caused several rounds of federal litigation; by 1981, it was declared that the Stafford Municipal School District was constitutional. Almost all of Stafford was in FBISD, with a minuscule portion in the Houston Independent School District. All of Stafford is now zoned to the Stafford Municipal School District, Texas&#x27;s only municipal school district controlled by the city. Residents pay property taxes to the school district.

When most of Stafford was a part of FBISD, Staffordshire Elementary was in Stafford. Staffordshire housed Black students in grades 1–4. Black secondary school students attended the M.R. Wood School in Sugar Land. At the time FBISD formed in 1959, white students could attend one of two elementary schools, and they attended a middle school in Sugar Land and a high school site in Missouri City; the latter two sites now house Lakeview Elementary School and Missouri City Middle School. Dulles High School became the high school for white students in FBISD. In September 1965 Fort Bend ISD desegregated and Staffordshire School closed. Staffordshire students were reassigned to E. A. Jones Elementary School in Missouri City. Dulles Junior High School served as FBISD&#x27;s sole junior high school from March 1965 to August 1975. Dulles High became the only zoned high school for students of all races in FBISD until Willowridge High School in Houston opened in 1979.

==== Private schools ====

Everest Academy (Pre-K–5), a school of the Darul Arqam Schools, is in Stafford. Sugar Creek Montessori School also has a campus in Stafford.

=== Public libraries ===
Fort Bend County Libraries&#x27; Mamie George Branch is in Sugar Land, on Dulles Avenue next to Dulles Middle School. The Mamie George Library, a library designed by Wylie W. Vale and Associates, opened in November 1974. It was named after Mamie George, a philanthropist from Fort Bend County. The George Foundation donated funds for the building, and the Fort Bend Independent School District donated the land the library was built on. The library was renovated in 1991. In 1996 the small-business-center materials were moved from the Missouri City Branch to the Mamie George Branch.

== History ==
Friendswood, situated in the northwestern corner of Galveston County, has the distinction of being the only permanent town in Texas that started as a Quaker colony. It was established in 1895 by a group of Quakers led by T. Hadley Lewis and Frank J. Brown. They were looking for a &quot;promised land&quot; to start a colony of the people who belonged to the religious denomination called Friends or Quakers.
From its founding, life in Friendswood revolved around church and school. After the small church and school building was demolished in the 1900 Storm, the two-dozen families living in Friendswood erected a large two-story frame structure for their church and school. The building, called The Academy, housed the school and sanctuary until a larger, stone building replaced it.
Through the 1940s, Friendswood was predominately a small, remote, farming Quaker community with less than 500 citizens. The economy depended largely on growing and preserving Magnolia figs. After 1950, it became increasingly a suburban bedroom community, as Houstonians discovered the idyllic country setting the farmlands were converted to subdivision home-sites. The community became a city when it incorporated in 1960.

==Climate and Weather ==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, Friendswood has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

Friendswood has a historical reputation among Friends, Friendswood inhabitants, for extreme weather due to the close proximity to Galveston Island and therefore the Gulf of Mexico. In recent history Friendswood was devastated by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, a category 4 hurricane, along with Hurricane Beryl of 2024. After numerous major storms swept through southeastern Texas, where Friendswood is located, residents began building houses above ground to avoid flooding. Major flooding is caused by the rise of Clear Creek, a body of water near the suburbs of Polly Ranch.

==Legacy==
The 2014 novel &quot;Friendswood&quot;, set in the area, was written by René Steinke.

<doc id="151192" wikidata="Q982639" url="?curid=151192" title="League City, Texas">
<text>League City is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, in Galveston County, within the metropolitan area. The population was 114,392 at the 2020 census.

The city of League City has a small portion north of Clear Creek within Harris County zoned for residential and commercial uses. It is home to several waterside resorts, such as South Shore Harbor Resort and Conference Center and Waterford Harbor and Yacht Club Marina, popular with residents of nearby Houston. Between 2000 and 2005, League City surpassed Galveston as Galveston County&#x27;s largest city.

==History==
League City was settled at the former site of a Karankawa Indian village. Three families, the Butlers, the Cowarts, and the Perkinses, are considered to be the founding families of the city. The Winfield Family has also recently been acknowledged as a founding family by the City Government. The Cowart family settled on a creek now called Cowart&#x27;s Creek after them (now often called &quot;Coward&#x27;s Creek&quot;). The Perkins family built on a creek notably lined with magnolia trees and named it Magnolia Bayou. The Butler family settled inland. The Winfield Family purchased land in League City from the great nephew of Stephen F. Austin and moved there, to a place near what is now Hobbs Road.

The first resident of the town proper, George W. Butler, arrived from Louisiana in 1854 and settled at the junction of Clear Creek and Chigger Bayou. The area was known as Butler&#x27;s Ranch or Clear Creek until J. C. League acquired the land from a man named Muldoon on his entering the priesthood. League laid out his townsite along the Galveston, Houston, and Henderson Railroad, already established in the area. This began a small feud over the name, as Butler was the postmaster. The name was changed several times, alternating between Clear Creek and the new League City. In the end, League City was chosen.

In 1907, League had two railroad flatcars of live oak trees left by the railroad tracks. These were for the residents to plant on their property. Butler and his son Milby supervised the planting of these trees, now known as the Butler Oaks. Many of them line Main Street to this day.

Starting in the early 1970s, the bodies of 30 murdered women were discovered in Galveston County, with 4 being discovered in League City, and more have gone missing from the same area. This location has become known as the Texas Killing Fields.

In the 2000s, rising real estate costs in Galveston forced many families to move to other areas, including League City. This meant an influx of children out of Galveston ISD and into other school districts like Clear Creek ISD and Dickinson ISD.

==Geography==
League City is located southeast of Houston, and the same distance northwest of Galveston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.22%, is water.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the Houston area, League City features a humid subtropical climate characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters (corresponding to Cfa in Köppen Climate Classification).

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 census, there were 114,392 people, 41,352 households, and 30,430 families residing in the city. There were 43,493 housing units.

==Arts and culture==
===Public library===
The Helen Hall Library, a member of the Galveston County Library System, is operated by the city and located at 100 West Walker Street. The League City Public Library was renamed after Hall in 1985. During that year a $2.5 million bond to expand the library passed. The library received a two-story adult services wing and a renovation of the original structure, which housed the children&#x27;s and audio-visual services sections; the projects were completed by 1988. As of 2008 Hall, with of space, is the largest and busiest unit of the Galveston County Library System.

Circa 2019 the library&#x27;s history club began operations. It meets once per month. As of 2021, according to the librarian specializing in history, Caris Brown, the history club had a number of people going to meetings despite the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in Texas.

In 2022 two League City city council members created a resolution which would have a board of 15 people decide whether content is obscene, and if so, prevent the library from having tax dollars to house said material ruled obscene.

==Parks and recreation==
The Perry Family YMCA is located at 1701 League City Parkway. The branch, which cost US$10.7 million to build was named after Bob Perry, a homebuilder who donated $1 million. The North Galveston County YMCA began in 1993 and later moved into the Perry YMCA. John P. McGovern and his wife, Katherine, donated the site used for the Perry YMCA.

Hometown Heroes Park is a public community park covering 28.71 acres that includes a recreation center, basketball/volleyball courts, competition size swimming pool, and sports fields.

==Government==
League City became an incorporated city in 1962. League City&#x27;s government consists of seven council members and the mayor. The mayor is a full voting member of the council. The city&#x27;s charter is purported to be a strong mayor form of government, but this issue has been debated for years. By ordinance, a city administrator position was created under Mayor Leonard Cruse. The ordinance was amended in May 2010 to create a council-manager government. According to the ordinance, &quot;...shall consist of a mayor and council members, elected by the people and responsible to the people, and a city manager, appointed by and responsible to the council for proper administration of the affairs of the city.&quot;

In 2011 an officer accused the police chief, Michael Jez, of giving officers ticket quotas, which are illegal in the state of Texas. In November city council voted to place Chief Jez on administrative leave. The council did not give a reason and Jez cited philosophical differences for the separation. Much speculation was made that the decision was a reaction to the allegation made, but neither side ever admitted to any wrongdoing.

In 2014, the police department moved to a new joint Public Safety Building that is shared with Police and Fire administration as well as housing the police department, dispatch, and the city jail. The building is across the street from the old police department that now houses other city offices that were previously in leased space. The city held an open house in January 2015 to serve as a grand opening to the public, allowing citizens to come see the inner workings of the police department.

<text>Nixon is a city, self-described as a &quot;compact neighborhood,&quot; at U.S. Highway 87 and the junction of Karnes, Gonzales and Wilson counties; alongside the Clear Fork Creek in the Juan J. Tejada League, in the U.S. state of Texas. Approaching 100 city blocks, the Nixon urban-area is defined by its schools at its north-end in the neighborhood of Rancho; with the southwest boundary hosting its industrial park and meat packing facilities, upon the 87-corridor towards Pandora and the county seat of Floresville.

The population was 2,341 at the 2020 census. Nixon is located primarily within Gonzales County; however, most of its major employers and assets are alongside the eastern Wilson County line. The city has a total area of , all land. The Wilson County portion of Nixon is part of the San Antonio Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Nixon was formed across the landholdings of the Nixon family through the end of the 19th century, beginning as a 14,000 acre plantation south of Luling and north of Belmont. In the early 20th century through the present day, Nixon continually consolidated southward at John T. Nixon&#x27;s land closer to the original settlements of Cuero, Goliad and Indianola, once acting as a rail station; this confluence once having the original name of &quot;Rancho,&quot; so named for its free-range cattle industry.

The city is served primarily by employers that include a publicly-traded oil refinery, a chicken slaughterhouse, and its municipal services, especially the Nixon-Smiley Consolidated Independent School District. In 2018, the aggregate income of urban Nixon was an estimated $58,035,500. In 2019 according to the Texas Department of Transportation, the aggregate annual-average-daily-traffic (AADT) of urban Nixon was rated at 22,928 vehicles.

==Services==

===Blue Dolphin===
===Holmes Foods===

In 1925, near the Wilson County line of Nixon, Holmes Foods began as an ice plant that processed and slaughtered chickens across the street, in what is now-presently the 44,000+ square-foot facility&#x27;s parking lot. Eventually expanding to turkeys, &quot;heavy hens,&quot; broilers and ducks.

As of 2010, ranking 30th out of 37 national &quot;poultry integrators,&quot; the facility slaughtered 700,000 broiler chickens per week at an average of 4 pounds each. During this time, 310 out of the &quot;400+&quot; facility employees processed these chickens into an &quot;eight-piece cut,&quot; a major portion of the service offered by the facility.

This facility produces 50% of the local wastewater which is stored in 3 lagoons, later sprayed over half-a-mile of hay meadows for cattle ranching.

===Recreational vehicle parks===

The majority of the city&#x27;s major arteries are zoned as &quot;recreational vehicle parks,&quot; under a city-managed licensing program.

==History==
The history of Nixon is defined by the dissolution and struggle of some of its major institutions.

===Old Nixon===
In 1852, Robert T. Nixon at the northern Gonzales—Guadalupe County line founded the original settlement of Nixon, now known as the ghost town &quot;Old Nixon;&quot; a former 14,000 acre plantation between Belmont-Luling.

The Old Nixon facility, despite being fenced at 14,000 acres at its precipice, began at an original capitalization of $800 for 400 acres of land; with no original &quot;free land&quot; grants of early Texas. During Juneteenth 1865, the plantation was not affected by the abolishment of slavery, as the plantation had no slaves. Cattle and horse-breeding were the primary occupations of this enterprise, the latter being featured in The Quarter Horse journal of July 1947; featuring the early 1900s, when the Old Nixon plantation under Dr. J.W. Nixon, hosted the first &quot;Joe Bailey&quot; Quarter Horse, a foremost founding sire of the breed.

In 1899, Old Nixon at Guadalupe County had a cotton gin (Nixon-family owned), two schools, a church, a blacksmith, several residences; alongside &quot;Wagner&#x27;s Store&quot; and &quot;Nixon and Stephens: Dealers in Dry Goods, Notions, Fine Groceries and General Merchandise.&quot; The latter was owned by W.H. Stephens and Sam Nixon. Robert T. Nixon&#x27;s brother John T. Nixon lived at Rancho near what is now northern Nixon in southern Gonzales County. The name of Nixon was later taken from the former town and applied to the new town formed on John T. Nixon&#x27;s land.

The only remaining establishment of the original Old Nixon settlement is its cemetery.

====Rancho-Nixon====

While Old Nixon was being founded, the settlement of Rancho grew at the northern boundary of present-Nixon and the country store of Paul Murray, on land he purchased in 1849. His store was located at the intersection of roads that led to the important settlements of San Antonio, Gonzales, Seguin, Cuero, Goliad and Indianola. Murray had come to Texas from Mississippi and was soon followed by many of his Mississippi neighbors. They came in search of farm land, but soon abandoned the plow to adopt the cowboy culture of the area, as unbranded range cattle were everywhere and free for the taking.

The name &quot;Rancho&quot; was the first name given to the developing Nixon settlement as a ranching culture developed. Some of the earliest open range branding codes in Texas originated here in 1866, as local stockmen were gathering cattle herds to be driven to northern markets by Rancho cowboys. These codes facilitated the system of marking and tracking the cattle that mingled together in open, unfenced ranges. A post office was officially established in 1855, and Rancho grew to have several businesses, as well as a school and two churches.

Rancho began a rapid decline in population when the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railroad bypassed the town in 1906, and many residents relocated to the new railroad town of Nixon, two miles to the south. The post office closed in 1911, and by that time, many of Rancho&#x27;s buildings had been moved to Nixon and most of Rancho&#x27;s residents had relocated to the new town. Although virtually no visible evidence of the town of Rancho remains, the town&#x27;s short existence stands as a reminder of the hundreds of similar towns that fell prey to the railroads that crossed Texas during the late 19th century.

====Union-Nixon====

Near the Wilson County—portion of Nixon, the town of Union or &quot;Union Valley&quot; had its postal services moved to Nixon in 1915. Settled before the American Civil War, the town had a population as high as 300 and several stores before its general consolidation into the Nixon community alongside FM 1681.

In 1947, the Union area had a nominal population of 50, with 22 reported in 1990 through 2000.

===Urban Nixon===

Nixon as an urban development began in 1869, at the site of its First Baptist Church within its 100-block grid on Texas Avenue, near Wilson County. The San Antonio Baptist Association established a local mission here under Reverend T. Christmas and Reverend J.F. Hines.

The congregation had established a sanctuary one-mile north in Rancho, and consolidated it into the Nixon congregation upon the city&#x27;s incorporation in 1907. In 1921, they began to partner with the congregation in Leakey, Texas, west of San Antonio.

The Nixon First Baptist Church is considered an original cultural founder of the community.

====Nixon News====
In the early 20th century, Nixon had a local newspaper titled &quot;Nixon News&quot;. It was forced to cease publication in September 1921. The editor cited reasons ranging from a lack of advertisement in the paper, lack of support from local businesses and apathy from the general community. &quot;The Daily Advocate&quot; newspaper of Victoria, Texas, during this period, suggested that the downscaling of another significant Texan paper was a related trend.

The trade-name of the paper returned as early as 1980 through 1986, serving as an executive over three annual city festivals; celebrating Nixon&#x27;s overall production of a broad-range of poultry products and byproducts, purportedly the highest in the State of Texas at that time. At present Nixon News is, again, no longer published but was considered award-winning in &quot;Community Service&quot; by the Texas Press Association in 1980.

Through 2013 until 2017, the trade-named resumed its most recent operation as an online newspaper titled “The Nixon News” with publications on local politics. This third-iteration of the publication is no longer published as well.

====Nixon intersection====
Since approximately 2015, the Nixon intersection of U.S. Highway 87 and Texas State Highway 80 has been marked by the Texas Department of Transportation having to hire and replace multiple contractors, after continual delay to install traffic signals over three-and-a-half years; an installation that would normally be a &quot;routine upgrade.&quot; The Nixon City Manager hypothesized the delays began with a first contractor &quot;not working in a timely manner.&quot; After a first contractor, time was consumed by an initial six-month delay, another set of construction bids and years of replacement of prior work.

====COVID-19====
In late March 2020, the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Gonzales County was discovered in Nixon.

The Nixon area is primarily served by the journals of record &quot;Wilson County News&quot; newspaper of Floresville and &quot;The Gonzales Inquirer&quot; newspaper of Gonzales.

===Crime===

In 2013, Kenneth Johnson of Nixon confessed to sexually assaulting two girls, ages 13 and 14, after a witness told Nixon police he saw Johnson rape an intoxicated teenager at a Nixon residence.

In 2018, 15-foot-long bleachers were stolen from the Nixon Little League baseball field; they were taken by truck in an act lasting three minutes.

In 2019, Nixon experienced significant acts of burglary and car theft, as well as issues of drugs and child-abuse being described as &quot;most distinguishable.&quot;

====Operation Torch====

In early 2020, the Texas Department of Public Safety Criminal Investigations Division and the Nixon Police Department targeted the sale of crystal meth in the Gonzales—Wilson County area, under the name Operation Torch. A significant number of arrest warrants were served in the Nixon-Pandora-Stockdale-Smiley municipal-area. The investigation began with analysis of the local impact of meth distribution in Nixon, eventually uncovering a &quot;drug network of distributors.&quot; Five of the targeted subjects, fifteen in total, were from the Nixon area. During this time period, eleven arrests were made, with four remaining at-large.

====Texas Sheltered Care====
In 2007, a former private facility in Nixon, &quot;Texas Sheltered Care&quot;, that held children caught illegally crossing the US-Mexico border, was ordered closed due to allegations of sexual abuse. It operated under contract of the federal government&#x27;s Department of Health and Human Services. Its 72 residents were sent to other shelters outside of Nixon, due to a lack of confidence of being able to reopen in the city. Immigration lawyers were forced to abandon their Nixon practices that served the detainees in the facility. The FBI and local authorities investigated the alleged incidents, with an accused staff member fired. The accused was later criminally charged and sentenced to prison.

==Notable people==

* Little Joe, Tejano singer
* Andre Marrou, 1992 Libertarian Party presidential nominee
* Chris Marrou, former news anchor for KENS 5-TV in San Antonio
* Carlton McKinney, retired professional basketball player

=== Manuel Zepeda ===

In 2018, former Nixon city manager and local substitute teacher, Manuel Zepeda, was charged with 11 sexual felonies against children.

=== Auvye Trammel ===

In 2011, former Nixon councilman Auvye Trammel, having once served 21 years on the city council through two terms, was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for connections with drug trafficking marijuana from Mexico; Trammel had posted bail for a known trafficker. He had also been prior charged for a chase involving the trafficker.

The then-current Nixon police chief was fired during the trafficking investigation just prior to Trammel&#x27;s arrest; the former chief cites reasons of retaliation for investigating the then-councilman, while the city claims he failed to meet occupational standards.

<text>Clarksville City is a city in Gregg and Upshur counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 780 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first settlers arrived in the area before 1845. There was a stagecoach stop at the home of William W. Walters, which was later owned and operated by Warren P. Victory. Though first known as &quot;Gilead&quot;, the post office was named &quot;Point Pleasant&quot; in 1852. It closed in 1867. The community withered when the railroad bypassed it in 1873 and Gladewater was established. With the advent of the East Texas Oil Field in 1930, so many homes, businesses, and oil-company camps and offices sprang up along the highway that it was called the Main Street of Texas, and street numbers were designated from Longview to Gladewater. The area around George W. Clark&#x27;s home on the site of the old stagecoach stop became known as &quot;Clarksville&quot;.

After extensive paving projects and other civic improvements in the 1940s and the construction of Lake Gladewater in 1952, the nearby city of Gladewater had a high tax rate and was extending its boundaries. Industrialists in the area to the east became alarmed at the prospect of being taken into Gladewater and taxed more. A movement to incorporate, spearheaded by several oil companies and the L. W. Pelphrey Company, a general contractor specializing in oilfield construction, culminated in a vote to establish Clarksville City on September 14, 1956. Pelphrey was elected mayor and served until his death in August 1961. The bypassed portion of Old Highway 80 is named Pelphrey Drive in his honor.

The population dwindled as drilling reached the state allowable and producing wells became automated. Cities Service Oil Company closed its office and camp in the early 1960s, and Sun Oil Company soon followed. After a population low of 359 in the 1960s, growth was steady. In 1990 Clarksville City had 720 residents and twenty businesses. In 2000 the population was 806. The town has an elected mayor and council with a city manager form of government. The city hall was built in 1962 and doubled in size in 1991. A Texas historical marker for the old community of Point Pleasant is at the city hall.

<doc id="151196" wikidata="Q275459" url="?curid=151196" title="Acute radiation syndrome">
<text>Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), also known as radiation sickness or radiation poisoning, is a collection of health effects that are caused by being exposed to high amounts of ionizing radiation in a short period of time. Symptoms can start within an hour of exposure, and can last for several months. Early symptoms are usually nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. In the following hours or weeks, initial symptoms may appear to improve, before the development of additional symptoms, after which either recovery or death follow.
ARS involves a total dose of greater than 0.7 Gy (70 rad), that generally occurs from a source outside the body, delivered within a few minutes. Sources of such radiation can occur accidentally or intentionally. They may involve nuclear reactors, cyclotrons, certain devices used in cancer therapy, nuclear weapons, or radiological weapons. It is generally divided into three types: bone marrow, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular syndrome, with bone marrow syndrome occurring at 0.7 to 10 Gy, and neurovascular syndrome occurring at doses that exceed 50 Gy. The cells that are most affected are generally those that are rapidly dividing. At high doses, this causes DNA damage that may be irreparable. Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure and symptoms. Repeated complete blood counts (CBCs) can indicate the severity of exposure.
Treatment of ARS is generally supportive care. This may include blood transfusions, antibiotics, colony-stimulating factors, or stem cell transplant. Radioactive material remaining on the skin or in the stomach should be removed. If radioiodine was inhaled or ingested, potassium iodide is recommended. Complications such as leukemia and other cancers among those who survive are managed as usual. Short-term outcomes depend on the dose exposure.
ARS is generally rare. A single event can affect a large number of people, as happened in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the Chernobyl nuclear power plant disaster. ARS differs from chronic radiation syndrome, which occurs following prolonged exposures to relatively low doses of radiation.

==Signs and symptoms==

Classically, ARS is divided into three main presentations: hematopoietic, gastrointestinal, and neurovascular. These syndromes may be preceded by a prodrome. The speed of symptom onset is related to radiation exposure, with greater doses resulting in a shorter delay in symptom onset. These presentations presume whole-body exposure, and many of them are markers that are invalid if the entire body has not been exposed. Each syndrome requires that the tissue showing the syndrome itself be exposed (e.g., gastrointestinal syndrome is not seen if the stomach and intestines are not exposed to radiation). Some areas affected are:

# Hematopoietic. This syndrome is marked by a drop in the number of blood cells, called aplastic anemia. This may result in infections, due to a low number of white blood cells, bleeding, due to a lack of platelets, and anemia, due to too few red blood cells in circulation. These changes can be detected by blood tests after receiving a whole-body acute dose as low as , though they might never be felt by the patient if the dose is below . Conventional trauma and burns resulting from a bomb blast are complicated by the poor wound healing caused by hematopoietic syndrome, increasing mortality.
# Gastrointestinal. This syndrome often follows absorbed doses of . The signs and symptoms of this form of radiation injury include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain. Vomiting in this time-frame is a marker for whole body exposures that are in the fatal range above . Without exotic treatment such as bone marrow transplant, death with this dose is common, due generally more to infection than gastrointestinal dysfunction.
# Neurovascular. This syndrome typically occurs at absorbed doses greater than , though it may occur at doses as low as . It presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, headache, or decreased level of consciousness, occurring within minutes to a few hours, with an absence of vomiting, and is almost always fatal, even with aggressive intensive care.

Early symptoms of ARS typically include nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue, fever, and a short period of skin reddening. These symptoms may occur at radiation doses as low as . These symptoms are common to many illnesses, and may not, by themselves, indicate acute radiation sickness.

===Dose effects===
A similar table and description of symptoms (given in rems, where 100 rem = 1 Sv), derived from data from the effects on humans subjected to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the indigenous peoples of the Marshall Islands subjected to the Castle Bravo thermonuclear bomb, animal studies and lab experiment accidents, have been compiled by the U.S. Department of Defense.

A person who was less than from the atomic bomb &quot;Little Boy&quot; hypocenter at Hiroshima, Japan, was found to have absorbed about 9.46 grays (Gy) of ionizing radiation. The doses at the hypocenters of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings were 240 and 290 Gy, respectively.

===Skin changes===
Cutaneous radiation syndrome (CRS) refers to the skin symptoms of radiation exposure. Within a few hours after irradiation, a transient and inconsistent redness (associated with itching) can occur. Then, a latent phase may occur and last from a few days up to several weeks, when intense reddening, blistering, and ulceration of the irradiated site is visible. In most cases, healing occurs by regenerative means; however, very large skin doses can cause permanent hair loss, damaged sebaceous and sweat glands, atrophy, fibrosis (mostly keloids), decreased or increased skin pigmentation, and ulceration or necrosis of the exposed tissue. 

As seen at Chernobyl, when skin is irradiated with high energy beta particles, moist desquamation (peeling of skin) and similar early effects can heal, only to be followed by the collapse of the dermal vascular system after two months, resulting in the loss of the full thickness of the exposed skin. Another example of skin loss caused by high-level exposure of radiation is during the 1999 Tokaimura nuclear accident, where technician Hisashi Ouchi had lost a majority of his skin due to the high amounts of radiation he absorbed during the irradiation. This effect had been demonstrated previously with pig skin using high energy beta sources at the Churchill Hospital Research Institute, in Oxford.

==Cause==

ARS is caused by exposure to a large dose of ionizing radiation (&gt; ~0.1 Gy) over a short period of time (&gt; ~0.1 Gy/h). Alpha and beta radiation have low penetrating power and are unlikely to affect vital internal organs from outside the body. Any type of ionizing radiation can cause burns, but alpha and beta radiation can only do so if radioactive contamination or nuclear fallout is deposited on the individual&#x27;s skin or clothing. 

Gamma and neutron radiation can travel much greater distances and penetrate the body easily, so whole-body irradiation generally causes ARS before skin effects are evident. Local gamma irradiation can cause skin effects without any sickness. In the early twentieth century, radiographers would commonly calibrate their machines by irradiating their own hands and measuring the time to onset of erythema.

===Accidental===
Accidental exposure may be the result of a criticality or radiotherapy accident. There have been numerous criticality accidents dating back to atomic testing during World War II, while computer-controlled radiation therapy machines such as Therac-25 played a major part in radiotherapy accidents. The latter of the two is caused by the failure of equipment software used to monitor the radiational dose given. Human error has played a large part in accidental exposure incidents, including some of the criticality accidents, and larger scale events such as the Chernobyl disaster. Other events have to do with orphan sources, in which radioactive material is unknowingly kept, sold, or stolen. The Goiânia accident is an example, where a forgotten radioactive source was taken from a hospital, resulting in the deaths of 4 people from ARS. Theft and attempted theft of radioactive material by clueless thieves has also led to lethal exposure in at least one incident.

Exposure may also come from routine spaceflight and solar flares that result in radiation effects on earth in the form of solar storms. During spaceflight, astronauts are exposed to both galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and solar particle event (SPE) radiation. The exposure particularly occurs during flights beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). Evidence indicates past SPE radiation levels that would have been lethal for unprotected astronauts. GCR levels that might lead to acute radiation poisoning are less well understood. The latter cause is rarer, with an event possibly occurring during the solar storm of 1859.

===Intentional===

Intentional exposure is controversial as it involves the use of nuclear weapons, human experiments, or is given to a victim in an act of murder. The intentional atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in tens of thousands of casualties; the survivors of these bombings are known today as . Nuclear weapons emit large amounts of thermal radiation as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, to which the atmosphere is largely transparent. This event is also known as &quot;flash&quot;, where radiant heat and light are bombarded into any given victim&#x27;s exposed skin, causing radiation burns. Death is highly likely, and radiation poisoning is almost certain if one is caught in the open with no terrain or building masking-effects within a radius of 0–3 km from a 1 megaton airburst. The 50% chance of death from the blast extends out to ~8 km from a 1 megaton atmospheric explosion.

Scientific testing on humans within the United States occurred extensively throughout the atomic age. Experiments took place on a range of subjects including, but not limited to; the disabled, children, soldiers, and incarcerated persons, with the level of understanding and consent given by subjects varying from complete to none. Since 1997 there have been requirements for patients to give informed consent, and to be notified if experiments were classified. Across the world, the Soviet nuclear program involved human experiments on a large scale, which is still kept secret by the Russian government and the Rosatom agency. The human experiments that fall under intentional ARS exclude those that involved long term exposure. Criminal activity has involved murder and attempted murder carried out through abrupt victim contact with a radioactive substance such as polonium or plutonium.

==Pathophysiology==
The most commonly used predictor of ARS is the whole-body absorbed dose. Several related quantities, such as the equivalent dose, effective dose, and committed dose, are used to gauge long-term stochastic biological effects such as cancer incidence, but they are not designed to evaluate ARS. To help avoid confusion between these quantities, absorbed dose is measured in units of grays (in SI, unit symbol &quot;Gy&quot;) or rad (in CGS), while the others are measured in sieverts (in SI, unit symbol &quot;Sv&quot;) or rem (in CGS). 1 rad = 0.01 Gy and 1 rem = 0.01 Sv.

In most of the acute exposure scenarios that lead to radiation sickness, the bulk of the radiation is external whole-body gamma, in which case the absorbed, equivalent, and effective doses are all equal. There are exceptions, such as the Therac-25 accidents and the 1958 Cecil Kelley criticality accident, where the absorbed doses in Gy or rad are the only useful quantities, because of the targeted nature of the exposure to the body.

Radiotherapy treatments are typically prescribed in terms of the local absorbed dose, which might be 60 Gy or higher. The dose is fractionated to about 2 Gy per day for &quot;curative&quot; treatment, which allows normal tissues to undergo repair, allowing them to tolerate a higher dose than would otherwise be expected. The dose to the targeted tissue mass must be averaged over the entire body mass, most of which receives negligible radiation, to arrive at a whole-body absorbed dose that can be compared to the table above.

===DNA damage===
Exposure to high doses of radiation causes DNA damage, later creating serious and even lethal chromosomal aberrations if left unrepaired. Ionizing radiation can produce reactive oxygen species, and does directly damage cells by causing localized ionization events. The former is very damaging to DNA, while the latter events create clusters of DNA damage. This damage includes loss of nucleobases and breakage of the sugar-phosphate backbone that binds to the nucleobases. The DNA organization at the level of histones, nucleosomes, and chromatin also affects its susceptibility to radiation damage. Clustered damage, defined as at least two lesions within a helical turn, is especially harmful. While DNA damage happens frequently and naturally in the cell from endogenous sources, clustered damage is a unique effect of radiation exposure. Clustered damage takes longer to repair than isolated breakages, and is less likely to be repaired at all. Larger radiation doses are more prone to cause tighter clustering of damage, and closely localized damage is increasingly less likely to be repaired.

Somatic mutations cannot be passed down from parent to offspring, but these mutations can propagate in cell lines within an organism. Radiation damage can also cause chromosome and chromatid aberrations, and their effects depend on in which stage of the mitotic cycle the cell is when the irradiation occurs. If the cell is in interphase, while it is still a single strand of chromatin, the damage will be replicated during the S1 phase of the cell cycle, and there will be a break on both chromosome arms; the damage then will be apparent in both daughter cells. If the irradiation occurs after replication, only one arm will bear the damage; this damage will be apparent in only one daughter cell. A damaged chromosome may cyclize, binding to another chromosome, or to itself.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is typically made based on a history of significant radiation exposure and suitable clinical findings. An absolute lymphocyte count can give a rough estimate of radiation exposure. Time from exposure to vomiting can also give estimates of exposure levels if they are less than 10 Gy (1000 rad).

==Prevention==

A guiding principle of radiation safety is &quot;as low as reasonably achievable&quot; (ALARA). This means try to avoid exposure as much as possible and includes the three components of time, distance, and shielding.

===Time===
The longer that humans are subjected to radiation the larger the dose will be. The advice in the nuclear war manual entitled &quot;Nuclear War Survival Skills&quot; published by Cresson Kearny in the U.S. was that if one needed to leave the shelter then this should be done as rapidly as possible to minimize exposure.

In chapter 12, he states that &quot;[q]uickly putting or dumping wastes outside is not hazardous once fallout is no longer being deposited. For example, assume the shelter is in an area of heavy fallout and the dose rate outside is 400 roentgen (R) per hour, enough to give a potentially fatal dose in about an hour to a person exposed in the open. If a person needs to be exposed for only 10 seconds to dump a bucket, in this 1/360 of an hour he will receive a dose of only about 1 R. Under war conditions, an additional 1-R dose is of little concern.&quot; In peacetime, radiation workers are taught to work as quickly as possible when performing a task that exposes them to radiation. For instance, the recovery of a radioactive source should be done as quickly as possible.

===Shielding===
Usually, matter attenuates radiation, so placing any mass (e.g., lead, dirt, sandbags, vehicles, water, even air) between humans and the source will reduce the radiation dose. This is not always the case, however; care should be taken when constructing shielding for a specific purpose. For example, although high atomic number materials are very effective in shielding photons, using them to shield beta particles may cause higher radiation exposure due to the production of bremsstrahlung x-rays, and hence low atomic number materials are recommended. Also, using material with a high neutron activation cross section to shield neutrons will result in the shielding material itself becoming radioactive and hence more dangerous than if it were not present.

There are many types of shielding strategies that can be used to reduce the effects of radiation exposure. Internal contamination protective equipment such as respirators are used to prevent internal deposition as a result of inhalation and ingestion of radioactive material. Dermal protective equipment, which protects against external contamination, provides shielding to prevent radioactive material from being deposited on external structures. While these protective measures do provide a barrier from radioactive material deposition, they do not shield from externally penetrating gamma radiation. This leaves anyone exposed to penetrating gamma rays at high risk of ARS.

Naturally, shielding the entire body from high energy gamma radiation is optimal, but the required mass to provide adequate attenuation makes functional movement nearly impossible. In the event of a radiation catastrophe, medical and security personnel need mobile protection equipment in order to safely assist in containment, evacuation, and many other necessary public safety objectives.

Research has been done exploring the feasibility of partial body shielding, a radiation protection strategy that provides adequate attenuation to only the most radio-sensitive organs and tissues inside the body. Irreversible stem cell damage in the bone marrow is the first life-threatening effect of intense radiation exposure and therefore one of the most important bodily elements to protect. Due to the regenerative property of hematopoietic stem cells, it is only necessary to protect enough bone marrow to repopulate the exposed areas of the body with the shielded supply. This concept allows for the development of lightweight mobile radiation protection equipment, which provides adequate protection, deferring the onset of ARS to much higher exposure doses. One example of such equipment is the 360 gamma, a radiation protection belt that applies selective shielding to protect the bone marrow stored in the pelvic area as well as other radio sensitive organs in the abdominal region without hindering functional mobility.

===Reduction of incorporation===
Where radioactive contamination is present, an elastomeric respirator, dust mask, or good hygiene practices may offer protection, depending on the nature of the contaminant. Potassium iodide (KI) tablets can reduce the risk of cancer in some situations due to slower uptake of ambient radioiodine. Although this does not protect any organ other than the thyroid gland, their effectiveness is still highly dependent on the time of ingestion, which would protect the gland for the duration of a twenty-four-hour period. They do not prevent ARS as they provide no shielding from other environmental radionuclides.

===Fractionation of dose===

If an intentional dose is broken up into a number of smaller doses, with time allowed for recovery between irradiations, the same total dose causes less cell death. Even without interruptions, a reduction in dose rate below 0.1 Gy/h also tends to reduce cell death. This technique is routinely used in radiotherapy.

The human body contains many types of cells and a human can be killed by the loss of a single type of cells in a vital organ. For many short term radiation deaths (3–30 days), the loss of two important types of cells that are constantly being regenerated causes death. The loss of cells forming blood cells (bone marrow) and the cells in the digestive system (microvilli, which form part of the wall of the intestines) is fatal.

==Management==

Treatment usually involves supportive care with possible symptomatic measures employed. The former involves the possible use of antibiotics, blood products, colony stimulating factors, and stem cell transplant.

===Antimicrobials===
There is a direct relationship between the degree of the neutropenia that emerges after exposure to radiation and the increased risk of developing infection. Since there are no controlled studies of therapeutic intervention in humans, most of the current recommendations are based on animal research.

The treatment of established or suspected infection following exposure to radiation (characterized by neutropenia and fever) is similar to the one used for other febrile neutropenic patients. However, important differences between the two conditions exist. Individuals that develop neutropenia after exposure to radiation are also susceptible to irradiation damage in other tissues, such as the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and central nervous system. These patients may require therapeutic interventions not needed in other types of neutropenic patients. The response of irradiated animals to antimicrobial therapy can be unpredictable, as was evident in experimental studies where metronidazole and pefloxacin therapies were detrimental.

Antimicrobials that reduce the number of the strict anaerobic component of the gut flora (i.e., metronidazole) generally should not be given because they may enhance systemic infection by aerobic or facultative bacteria, thus facilitating mortality after irradiation.

An empirical regimen of antimicrobials should be chosen based on the pattern of bacterial susceptibility and nosocomial infections in the affected area and medical center and the degree of neutropenia. Broad-spectrum empirical therapy (see below for choices) with high doses of one or more antibiotics should be initiated at the onset of fever. These antimicrobials should be directed at the eradication of Gram-negative aerobic bacilli (i.e., Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas) that account for more than three quarters of the isolates causing sepsis. Because aerobic and facultative Gram-positive bacteria (mostly alpha-hemolytic streptococci) cause sepsis in about a quarter of the victims, coverage for these organisms may also be needed.

A standardized management plan for people with neutropenia and fever should be devised. Empirical regimens contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, amikacin).

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for ARS is dependent on the exposure dose, with anything above 8 Gy being almost always lethal, even with medical care. Radiation burns from lower-level exposures usually manifest after 2 months, while reactions from the burns occur months to years after radiation treatment. Complications from ARS include an increased risk of developing radiation-induced cancer later in life. According to the controversial but commonly applied linear no-threshold model, any exposure to ionizing radiation, even at doses too low to produce any symptoms of radiation sickness, can induce cancer due to cellular and genetic damage. The probability of developing cancer is a linear function with respect to the effective radiation dose. Radiation cancer may occur after ionizing radiation exposure following a latent period averaging 20 to 40 years.

==History==
Acute effects of ionizing radiation were first observed when Wilhelm Röntgen intentionally subjected his fingers to X-rays in 1895. He published his observations concerning the burns that developed that eventually healed, and misattributed them to ozone. Röntgen believed the free radical produced in air by X-rays from the ozone was the cause, but other free radicals produced within the body are now understood to be more important. David Walsh first established the symptoms of radiation sickness in 1897.

Ingestion of radioactive materials caused many radiation-induced cancers in the 1930s, but no one was exposed to high enough doses at high enough rates to bring on ARS.

The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in high acute doses of radiation to a large number of Japanese people, allowing for greater insight into its symptoms and dangers. Red Cross Hospital Surgeon Terufumi Sasaki led intensive research into the syndrome in the weeks and months following the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Sasaki and his team were able to monitor the effects of radiation in patients of varying proximities to the blast itself, leading to the establishment of three recorded stages of the syndrome. Within 25–30 days of the explosion, Sasaki noticed a sharp drop in white blood cell count and established this drop, along with symptoms of fever, as prognostic standards for ARS. Actress Midori Naka, who was present during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, was the first incident of radiation poisoning to be extensively studied. Her death on 24 August 1945 was the first death ever to be officially certified as a result of ARS (or &quot;Atomic bomb disease&quot;).

There are two major databases that track radiation accidents: The American ORISE REAC/TS and the European IRSN ACCIRAD. REAC/TS shows 417 accidents occurring between 1944 and 2000, causing about 3000 cases of ARS, of which 127 were fatal. ACCIRAD lists 580 accidents with 180 ARS fatalities for an almost identical period. The two deliberate bombings are not included in either database, nor are any possible radiation-induced cancers from low doses. The detailed accounting is difficult because of confounding factors. ARS may be accompanied by conventional injuries such as steam burns, or may occur in someone with a pre-existing condition undergoing radiotherapy. There may be multiple causes for death, and the contribution from radiation may be unclear. Some documents may incorrectly refer to radiation-induced cancers as radiation poisoning, or may count all overexposed individuals as survivors without mentioning if they had any symptoms of ARS.

===Notable cases=== 
The following table includes only those known for their attempted survival with ARS. These cases exclude chronic radiation syndrome such as Albert Stevens, in which radiation is exposed to a given subject over a long duration. The table also necessarily excludes cases where the individual was exposed to so much radiation that death occurred before medical assistance or dose estimations could be made, such as an attempted cobalt-60 thief who reportedly died 30 minutes after exposure. The result column represents the time of exposure to the time of death attributed to the short and long term effects attributed to initial exposure. As ARS is measured by a whole-body absorbed dose, the exposure column only includes units of gray (Gy).

==Other animals==
Thousands of scientific experiments have been performed to study ARS in animals. There is a simple guide for predicting survival and death in mammals, including humans, following the acute effects of inhaling radioactive particles.

<text>Gladewater is a city in Gregg and Upshur counties in the U.S. state of Texas with a 2020 census population of 6,134.

In the early 20th century, Gladewater was an oil boom town. In 1995, the Texas Legislature proclaimed it the &quot;Antique Capital of East Texas.&quot;

==History==

Gladewater was founded by the Texas and Pacific Railway Company in 1873 on land bought from Jarrett Dean and Anderson White. A community called St. Clair, to the east, moved to Gladewater when the railroad announced that the only mail stop in the area would be there; residents from Point Pleasant, also bypassed by the railroad, moved to Gladewater. The first post office at Gladewater was established on August 22, 1873. The town&#x27;s name probably originated from its proximity to Glade Creek, a tributary of the Sabine River that rose in a rather barren region called the Glades.

In 1874, Gladewater was incorporated with a mayor-alderman government. The incorporation lapsed, and a new charter was not obtained until 1931, when an influx of population necessitated organized city government. In 1955 Gladewater adopted a council-mayor form of government. The population grew slowly during the nineteenth century; the town had only 163 people in 1880 and 259 in 1900. In the area around Gladewater lumbering was a major activity, although farming was also important; cotton was the major crop. In 1908 the town had ten stores, one bank, two blacksmith shops, two hotels, a gin, a sawmill, and a planing mill. It continued to grow slowly until 1931.
On April 7, 1931, the first Gladewater oil well blew in. It was located outside town in the Sabine River bottom. Oil production led to a population increase during the 1930s from about 500 to around 8,000 people. In 1940, after the oil boom, Gladewater had a population of 4,454. Civic improvements in the 1940s included an extensive paving project and a commercial airfield. Between 1940 and 1960 the population grew to 5,742. Lake Gladewater, constructed on Glade Creek in 1954, provides recreation for city residents.

During the 1970s Gladewater moved from an oil-oriented to a more diversified economy, primarily because of depletion of oil resources in the area. The movement of salt water into the western edge of the large East Texas Oil Field affected Gladewater first. By 1980 the town had a total of 6,548 residents, 4,311 in Gregg County and 2,237 in Upshur County. The economy in the 1980s depended on the oil industry and related activities and on the manufacture of such products as furniture, clothing, paper products, and boats. The lumber and agricultural industry was still a driver for the economy as well. By 1990 the community had become well known for its numerous antique stores. Notable annual festivals include the East Texas Gusher Days in April, the Gladewater Roundup Rodeo in June, the Arts and Crafts Festival in September, and Christmas in November.

In 1935, the Boston Red Sox franchise had a minor league baseball team in Gladewater, the Gladewater Bears. The minor league stadium has since been turned into a city park. The predominant features of the stadium are long gone, but the stadium is located near the Lee Building in Gladewater.

<text>Kilgore is a city in Gregg and Rusk counties in Texas, United States. Located where Interstate 20 and US 259 converge just south of the Sabine River. Over three-fourths of the area within city limits are located in Gregg County, the remainder in Rusk County. The population was 12,975 at the 2010 census and 13,376 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Kilgore was founded in 1872 when the International–Great Northern Railroad completed the initial phase of rail line between Palestine and Longview. The rail company chose to bypass New Danville, a small community about southeast of Longview, in lieu of a new townsite platted on sold to the railroad by Constantine Buckley Kilgore, the town&#x27;s namesake. That way the railroad gained the profits from sale and development of the lands.

A post office was built in Kilgore in 1873 and with a station and transportation for getting commodity crops to market, the city soon began drawing residents and businesses away from New Danville. By 1885, the population had reached 250, and the community had two cotton gins, a church, and a school (for white children only). The racially segregated Kilgore Independent School District was organized in 1910. By 1914 the town had two banks, several businesses, and a reported population of 700. The 1920s showed continued steady growth, and by 1929 Kilgore was home to an estimated 1,000 residents.

Prosperity came to a halt, however, when Kilgore was dealt severe blows by a steep decline in cotton prices (on which most of the town&#x27;s economy was still based), and the effects of the Great Depression. Businesses began to close and, by the middle of 1930, the population had fallen to 500; the community appeared destined to become a ghost town. Many Blacks joined the Great Migration out of the South to northern, midwestern, and western cities for work.

Kilgore&#x27;s fortunes changed dramatically on October 3, 1930, when wildcatter Columbus M. &quot;Dad&quot; Joiner struck oil near the neighboring town of Henderson. The well known as the Daisy Bradford #3, marked the discovery of the vast East Texas Oil Field. Seemingly overnight Kilgore was transformed from a small farming town on the decline into a bustling boomtown. The Daisy Bradford #3 was subsequently followed by the Lou Della Crim No. 1 and many others. By 1936, the population had increased to more than 12,000, and Kilgore&#x27;s skyline was crowded with oil derricks.

Oil production continued at a breakneck pace throughout the early 1930s, with more than 1,100 producing oil wells within city limits at the height of the boom. The explosive growth left most civic services overwhelmed, and as a result Kilgore was forced to incorporate in 1931. With the city flooded with male workers and roustabouts, law enforcement struggled to keep order among the shanties, tents, and ramshackle honky-tonks that crowded Kilgore&#x27;s main streets. On one occasion, they had to summon help from the Texas Rangers to keep the peace. By the mid-1930s the oil boom was almost over and most of the small oil companies and wildcatters had sold out to major corporations. The boom was essentially over by 1940. But oil production has remained central to the city&#x27;s economy. The population, which fluctuated wildly throughout the 1930s, stabilized at around 10,000 in the 1950s. A 2015 estimate placed it at just under 15,000 residents.

In the 1940s Kilgore had over 1,000 wooden oil derricks. One acre was known by the nickname &quot;The world&#x27;s richest acre.&quot; Now there are 60 steel replicas of the derricks in the city topped with stars. The city is Texas&#x27; City of Stars.

<text>Longview is a city in, and county seat of, Gregg County, Texas, United States. Longview is located in East Texas, where Interstate 20 and U.S. highways 80 and 259 converge just north of the Sabine River. According to the 2020 U.S. census, the city had a population of 81,638. Longview is the principal city of the Longview metropolitan statistical area, comprising Gregg, Upshur, and Rusk counties. The population of the metropolitan area as of 2021 census estimates was 287,858.

Longview was established in 1870 in what was at the time southern Upshur County; the town incorporated in 1871. After Gregg County was created in 1873, Longview was voted the county seat. Today, Longview is considered a major hub city for the region, as is the nearby city of Tyler. Companies with significant presence in Longview include Eastman Chemical, Trinity Rail Group, AAON Coil Products, Komatsu Mining, Dollar General and Old Navy/GAP. Colleges and universities in the area include LeTourneau University, Kilgore College, and the University of Texas at Tyler&#x27;s Longview University Center.

==History==
The modern-day city of Longview was founded in 1869. In 1870, O.H. Methvin, Sr. sold to the Southern Pacific Railroad for one dollar to persuade them to build their line in the direction of land he owned. Later that year, he sold another for $500 in gold. He hoped the coming of the railroad would increase the value of the rest of his land.

Two railroad surveyors coined the name of the town when they stated, &quot;What a long view!&quot; from the porch of Methvin&#x27;s home. In June 1871, Longview was incorporated as the first town in Gregg County.

In 1884, the Mobberly Hotel opened for business servicing railroad travelers and as the center of social gatherings for Longview. The hotel featured cherrywood furniture with carved bed posts, marble-top washstands, linen tablecloths, electric crystal chandeliers, and a fireplace in every room. Mobberly was located in the junction part of town near the train depot. The hotel was destroyed by fire on June 13, 1965.

On May 23, 1894, Bill Dalton and three members of his posse robbed the First National Bank of Longview. Several men died in the resulting gunfight, bandit Jim Wallace along with citizens J. W. McQueen, Charles Learn, and George Buckingham. The robbers escaped with 2,000$ in cash and some unsigned bank notes. The Gregg County Historical Museum holds its exhibit on the event within the bank vault which was robbed, and holds a yearly event to mark the anniversary of the occasion.

In the Longview race riot in July 1919, a reporter for &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; was in Longview looking into the mysterious death of a black man named Lemuel Walters. An armed white mob attacked a home where the reporter, S.L. Jones, was staying, and attempted to batter their way in. A gunfight began between the attackers and the men in the house. Eventually, Jones made a getaway. The white men then began to burn buildings in the black section of the town.

==History==
The Santa Fe Railroad wanted to follow a straight line from Plainview to Lubbock. A straight-line survey was run and it went east of the present site of Abernathy. This route did not please the residents of Hale Center, which had been established since the 1890s. They influenced the Santa Fe to come southwest out of Plainview to serve them, and from there the Santa Fe followed an approximate straight line into Lubbock. 
The developers of the town sites along the new railroad wanted to organize a town on a section north of the present town of Abernathy. The owners, who lived in Wisconsin, were contacted. They thought gold might be on the land and refused to sell. Therefore, the last section south in Hale County was chosen as the town site. 
Originally owned by John Y. Ligon, the section that was to become the Abernathy town site was purchased by J.C. Roberds from E.S. and W.L. Stanfield. When the South Plains Investment Company was formed by Roberds, Dr. M.C. Overton, and Monroe Abernathy, Mr. Roberds deeded the section to the firm and became the president of the firm. Dr. Overton was secretary and Mr. Abernathy was treasurer. 
On June 18, 1909, the official survey of the town site was recognized by Gov. T.M. Campbell. The town site was platted on July 8, 1909, and was named for M.C. Abernathy. Mr. Monk was the resident agent for the company, and a small frame office building was built. Lots and blocks were sold from there. 
Since several buildings were already in Bartonsite and none in Abernathy, the founding fathers here contracted with J.J. Barton to move some of the buildings to Abernathy. In the late summer of 1909, the move began. Buildings were placed on rollers. The latest equipment—steam-driven tractors—hooked on. The exodus began to huff and puff toward the new town. The tractors did not move but about three or four miles per hour, so it was a long trip. A two-story yellow hotel, a lumberyard, blacksmith shop, and three or four residences were some of the roughly 10 buildings moved. 
The first train came to Abernathy in the early fall of 1909. This was not a regular train, but some cars added to the work train. 
The depot was constructed in 1909. C.E. Stout was the first local agent for the Santa Fe. 
The section where the town of Abernathy was being developed was fenced, and gates had to be opened when entering and leaving town. The streets and block corners were laid off with 2 x 4 stubs. These stubs denoted streets for the next few years, until a grader finally came in to run ditches. 
Town residents had free range on the section, and their milk cows and horses and mules were turned loose to graze. The stock would stray out of the section, and range cattle would come into town, when someone happened to leave the gates open. The ladies had to stand guard at their clotheslines to keep the livestock from ruining their laundry. When a load of feed was brought to town, the cattle and horses had to be chased away until it was unloaded in stack lots or barns. Trains running through the town section frequently hit the livestock. 
Behind most of the houses were outhouses, barns, and windmills. Nearly every home had its own windmill, although a few families hauled water. Generally, gardens and cow lots were integral parts of each household. 
Although the City of Abernathy was founded in 1909, it was not incorporated until 1924. An election was called for September 12, 1924. The first mayor was F.W. Struve, and aldermen elected were R.M. Hardesty, N.C. Hix, Sam W. Smith, T.B. Stone, and E.B. Lindsey.

==Schools==

The Abernathy Independent School District has an elementary school, middle school, and high school, with a district-wide enrollment of 768 students.

==In popular culture==

<text>Tomball ( ) is a city in Harris County in the U.S. state of Texas, a part of the Houston metropolitan area. The population was 12,341 at the 2020 U.S. census. In 1907, the community of Peck was renamed Tomball for local congressman Thomas Henry Ball, who had a major role in the development of the Port of Houston.

==History==

European settlement began in the Tomball area in the early 19th century, where newcomers found an open, fertile land that received adequate rainfall—perfect conditions for farming and raising cattle. It was on a land granted in 1838 to William Hurd&#x27;s heirs. In 1906 the area began to boom. Railroad line engineers often noticed that the Tomball area was on the boundary between the low hills of Texas and the flat coastal plains of the Gulf, making it an ideal location for a train stop. The railroad could load more cargo on each car, because the topography gently sloped toward the Galveston ports and provided an easier downhill coast. Thomas Henry Ball, an attorney for the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railroad, convinced the railroad to run the line right through downtown Tomball. Soon after, people came in droves to this new train stop. Hotels, boarding houses, saloons, and mercantile stores all began to spring up in the area. At first, people called the area Peck, after a chief civil engineer of the railroad line. However, on December 2, 1907, the town was officially named Tom Ball, later to be shortened to one word, for Mr. Ball.

In 1913, Baptist minister J.H. Gambrell, president of the Anti-Saloon League, urged his fellow prohibitionists to unite behind a Democratic candidate for governor. Ball was their man.

His opponent in 1914 was the wily James E. Ferguson, the candidate of anti-prohibitionist &quot;Constructive Democrats.&quot; Ferguson&#x27;s platform was short and to the point: &quot;Whereas, I, James Ferguson, am as well qualified to be Governor of Texas as any damn man in it; and Whereas, I am against prohibition and always will be; and Whereas, I am in favor of a square deal for tenant farmers: Therefore, be it resolved, that I will be elected.&quot;

Ball, the teetotaling man of rectitude, might have won, but Ferguson&#x27;s men visited Tomball and found to their delight that the rough and ready railroad town was no &quot;saloon-less world.&quot; They brought back photos of Tomballians staggering out of at least four saloons (&quot;shot of whiskey 10 cents, schooner of beer a nickel&quot;) &quot;and also discovered houses of ill repute doing a &quot;brisk business&quot; near the depot&quot;. The Ferguson campaign plastered the state with photos of a town named for a prohibitionist, where little, it seemed, was prohibited.

Ferguson also wondered why, if Ball was a teetotaler, he was a member of the Houston Club. As Texas historian James Haley tells the story, the man whose campaign slogan was &quot;Play Ball,&quot; played right into Ferguson&#x27;s hands by responding, lamely, that he enjoyed the club&#x27;s literary pursuits, whereupon Ferguson happily produced records showing that the club had recently spent $112 on reading materials and $10,483.15 for liquor. Tomball resigned from the race as a result and later stated &quot;If they had not named that town after me I would have been the next governor of Texas&quot;

Geophysical prospecting predicted the discovery of the Tomball Oil Field before the discovery well was drilled on 27 May 1933. Production was from the Cockfield Formation at a depth of about . The discovery produced an oil boom with many oil companies subsequently showing interest in the area. By 1935, 2,750,000 barrels of oil had been produced from 200 wells. Humble Oil Company, struck a deal with the town through which they would provide water and natural gas free of charge to the residents in exchange for rights to drill on the land. This agreement lasted until 1988.

Tomball incorporated in 1933. Because of the 1933 incorporation, Houston did not incorporate Tomball&#x27;s territory into its city limits.

<text>Fruela I ( – 14 January 768), also referred to as Froila I and nicknamed &quot;the Cruel,&quot; was the King of Asturias from 757 until his assassination. He was the eldest son of Alfonso I and continued his father&#x27;s war against the Moors. Pelayo, the founder of the Kingdom of Asturias, was his maternal grandfather.

During his reign, he suppressed uprisings from both the Basques and the Galicians; following his victory over the Basques, he took a Basque noblewoman from Alava named Munia as his wife. Basque country was relatively untouched following the revolt; on the contrary, Fruela laid waste to Galicia after suppressing the uprising. He also defeated a Cordoban army led by Omar, son of Abd al-Rahman I; Omar was killed as a result of the battle. The city of Oviedo was also founded during his reign when the abbot Máximo and his uncle Fromestano erected a church in honor of Saint Vincent there in 761.

Fruela personally assassinated his brother, Vimarano, leading to him being nicknamed &quot;the Cruel.&quot; He had feared that Vimarano&#x27;s popularity would lead to him taking the throne; in an act of repentance, he adopted Vimarano&#x27;s son, Vermudo, as his own. The killing of Vimarano outraged the nobility, however, and he in turn was assassinated by his own men in Cangas de Onís. He was succeeded by his cousin, Aurelius; his son, Alfonso, would later become King of Asturias. He and his wife Munia are buried together in the cathedral of Oviedo.

<doc id="151205" wikidata="Q982190" url="?curid=151205" title="Stamford, Texas">
<text>Stamford is a city on the border of Jones and Haskell counties in west-central Texas, United States. The population was 2,907 at the 2020 census. Henry McHarg, president of the Texas Central Railroad, named the site in 1900 for his hometown of Stamford, Connecticut. The city is home to the Texas Cowboy Reunion.

Stamford is on U.S. Highway 277 and State Highway 6. Most of the city is in Jones County. The portion of the city within Jones County is part of the Abilene, Texas metropolitan area.

==History==
While the town was named by Henry King McHarg for Stamford, Connecticut, the townsite was donated by the family of Swante Magnus Swenson. Mr. Swenson was the first Swedish immigrant to Texas. He became one of the largest landowners in Texas, and by 1860, his holdings in West Texas approached . These ranches, which spread across 12 Texas counties, became known as the SMS Ranches. Later reorganized as the Swenson Land and Cattle Company, it is headquartered in Stamford to this day. Mr. Swenson had two sons, Eric Pierson and Swen Albin, who became known as the Swenson brothers. They ran SMS Ranches, and even developed a Morab horse-breeding program near the city.

Swante M. Swenson is largely responsible for initiating and supporting Swedish immigration to Texas, starting in 1847. Mr. Swenson assisted Swedish immigrants with the cost of their passage from Sweden to Texas in exchange for their labor. In 1899, the Swenson brothers persuaded Henry McHarg, president of the Texas Central Railroad, to extend the railroad through their land. The brothers then founded Stamford in 1900 and provided the townsite of . The town and surrounding area were then partially settled by immigrants from Sweden. Many of the cotton farmers who moved to the area bought tracts of land from the Swenson brothers. Stamford&#x27;s main street is named Swenson.

In 1900, the railroad arrived in Stamford, when the independent Texas Central Railway completed its line from Albany to the town. In 1906–7, the Texas Central built another line, connecting Stamford with Rotan. By 1908, Stamford was connected to points north and east, through a line of the Wichita Valley Railroad running south from Seymour and commissioned expressly for this purpose.

Stamford College was founded as Stamford Collegiate Institute in September 1907 by the Northwest Texas Methodist Conference. Drought and World War I caused declining enrollments, and the college was closed in 1918 after a fire. The president of Stamford College went on to found McMurry University in Abilene.

In 1930, the Swensons were largely responsible for the founding of the annual Texas Cowboy Reunion.

The city&#x27;s general-aviation airport, Arledge Field, began operation in April 1941 as an Army Air Corps training center during World War II.

For the city&#x27;s first half century, order was kept by police chief George G. Flournoy. A small, crippled, cigar-chewing man, Flournoy began each day&#x27;s work with target shooting at a stump outside city hall.

In 1967, the rail line which connected Stamford to Albany and Waco was abandoned by the Missouri, Kansas &amp; Texas Railway, which had leased the Texas Central since 1914. Though the line from Stamford to Rotan was reacquired by the Texas Central Railway, it was sold three years later to the Fort Worth &amp; Denver Railway Company, and subsequently abandoned.

== Texas Cowboy Reunion ==
The first annual Texas Cowboy Reunion was held on June 28, 1930. It was established as a tribute to Texas cowboys, to preserve their traditions, and to lift the Depression-era morale. The first year was a success, as over 12,000 attendees watched three days of calf roping, bronco riding, steer riding, and the rodeo&#x27;s first exhibition of wild-cow milking. The Old Timers&#x27; Association, a group composed of retired cowboys, was formed for historical commemoration.

Will Rogers made one of his last public appearances at the Texas Cowboy Reunion in 1935, less than two months before he died. In 1937, when rural West Texas was at its most populous, a record 70,000 visitors made their way to the event. Wild-cow milking was not Stamford&#x27;s only contribution to modern rodeo events. Subsequent years had the creation of double mugging, a staple of Texas rodeos and ranch rodeo competitions. The worldwide phenomenon of barrel racing was modernized in Stamford, where the now-ubiquitous cloverleaf pattern was first used. In 1940, the American Quarter Horse Association held its first show at the Texas Cowboy Reunion. With a contestant roster made up primarily of working cowboys and regular folks, the event came to be billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest amateur rodeo&quot;. In the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas, candidate Coke Stevenson participated in the event and rode down the street on horseback, which won him many cheers.

Today, the event is held for four days each year around July 4 at the Texas Cowboy Reunion Grounds in Stamford. Annual events include a grand parade, four rodeo performances, a matched horse race, ropings, chuckwagon and barbecue cookoffs, daily barbecue meals, a Western art show and sale, fiddling and poetry performances, and dances.

==Culture==

===Elvis Presley===

<text>Mabank ( ) is a town in Henderson and Kaufman counties in Texas, United States. Its population was at the 2020 census.

==History==
Prior to the existence of Mabank in early 1900, the community of Lawndale was formed in the late 1880s. The community was noted for its agriculture in many areas, including cotton. With the Texas Trunk Railroad missing the community by a mile, though, ranchers Mason and Eubank decided to capitalize on the Texas Trunk and set aside one square mile of land and named it &quot;Mabank&quot;.

Mabank is a combination of the names Eubank and Mason, and is located southwest of the former community of Lawndale. Being only a mile away from Lawndale and located on the railroad, its citizens, churches, and businesses naturally decided to move there, thus attracting, over a brief period of about two years, much of what was Lawndale. This included the &quot;Lawndale Courier&quot;—the local newspaper that renamed itself the &quot;Mabank Courier&quot;.

The population, although small, remained relatively stable until the completion of Cedar Creek Reservoir in 1965. The town has since shown increases in population. Many of the descendants from the Masons and Eubanks still have connections to the town.

==Geography==
Mabank is located in the southeastern corner of Kaufman County. The town limits extend south into Henderson County. U.S. Route 175 runs through the northern side of the town, leading northwest to Kaufman and southeast to Athens. Downtown Dallas is northwest of Mabank.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.45%, is covered by water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 4,050 people, 1,175 households, and 720 families residing in the town.

==Education==

Mabank is served by the Mabank Independent School District. The schools are Central Elementary, Southside Elementary, Lakeview Elementary, Mabank Intermediate School, Mabank Jr. High, and Mabank High School.

==Parks and recreation==
Mabank is located on the northern and eastern edge of Cedar Creek Reservoir, a popular destination for weekend visitors from the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

==Notable people==
* Lindley Beckworth, former U.S. Congressman and judge
* Isiah Robertson, former NFL player who started the &quot; House of Isaiah&quot;, a drug treatment program in Mabank
* Randal Tye Thomas, 13th mayor of Gun Barrel City, Texas, (at the age of 21), from 2000 to 2001

About 21.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 2.93.

In the city, the population was distributed as 26.4% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 25.8% from 25 to 44, 24.0% from 45 to 64, and 16.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

Fritch is primarily a bedroom community, with the majority of citizens commuting to nearby Borger and Amarillo for work. Major employers in the area include Pantex, ConocoPhillips, and Agrium, all located within a short distance of Fritch. Due to its nature as a commuting town, Fritch differs from most small towns in the region, which rely more on agriculture as their economic base. Though several large ranches are adjacent to the town, little to no farming occurs due to the uneven topography, and the town has few agriculture-related services.

==Recreation==
Fritch is located adjacent to the Lake Meredith National Recreation Area, which offers residents and visitors ample opportunities for outdoor activities including boating, fishing, camping, hiking, and seasonal hunting. Alibates Flint Quarries National Monument is southwest of Fritch along Lake Meredith. The city is home to the Lake Meredith Historical Museum.

<text>Tadeusz Kantor (6 April 1915 – 8 December 1990) was a Polish painter, assemblage and Happenings artist, set designer and theatre director. Kantor is renowned for his revolutionary theatrical performances in Poland and abroad. Laureate of Witkacy Prize – Critics&#x27; Circle Award (1989).

== Life and career ==
Kantor was born to Marian Kantor-Mirski and Helena Berger. His family were staunch Catholics. His mother was related to composer and conductor Krzysztof Penderecki, through her German father. Born in Wielopole Skrzyńskie, Galicia (then in Austria-Hungary, now in Poland), Kantor graduated from the Cracow Academy in 1939. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, he founded the Independent Theatre, and served as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków as well as a director of experimental theatre in Kraków from 1942 to 1944. After the war, he became known for his avant-garde work in stage design including designs for &quot;Saint Joan&quot; (1956) and &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (1956). Specific examples of such changes to standard theatre were stages that extended out into the audience, and the use of mannequins instead of real-life actors.

In 1955, with a group of visual artists disenchanted with the growing institutionalization of avant-garde, he formed a new theatre ensemble called Cricot 2. In the 1960s, Cricot 2 gave performances in many theatres in Poland and abroad, gaining recognition for their stage &quot;happenings&quot;. His interest was mainly with the absurdists and Polish writer and playwright Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (also known as &quot;Witkacy&quot;). Stage productions of Witkacy&#x27;s plays &quot;The Cuttlefish&quot; (1956) and &quot;The Water Hen&quot; (1969) were regarded as his best achievements during this time. A 1972 performance of &quot;The Water Hen&quot; was described as &quot;the least-publicised, most talked-about event at the Edinburgh festival&quot;.

&quot;Dead Class&quot; (1975) was the most famous of his theatre pieces of the 1970s. A TV-Movie of the production was made in 1977, directed by Andrzej Wajda. In that play, Kantor himself played the role of a teacher who presided over a class of apparently dead characters who are confronted by mannequins representing the characters&#x27; younger selves. He had begun experimenting with the juxtaposition of mannequins and live actors in the 1950s.

His later works of the 1980s were very personal reflections. As in &quot;Dead Class&quot;, he would sometimes represent himself on stage. In the 1990s, his works became well known in the United States due to presentations at Ellen Stewart&#x27;s La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club.

Throughout his life, Kantor had an interested and unique relationship with Jewish culture. Despite being a nominal Catholic, Kantor incorporated many elements of what was known as &quot;Jewish theatre&quot; into his works.

Kantor died in Kraków.

The new Centre for the Documentation of the Art of Tadeusz Kantor, was opened in Krakow in 2014.

<doc id="151210" wikidata="Q15029" url="?curid=151210" title="Hu Jintao">
<text>Hu Jintao (born 21 December 1942) is a Chinese retired politician who served as the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 2002 to 2012, the sixth president of China from 2003 to 2013, and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) from 2004 to 2012. He was a member of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee, China&#x27;s de facto top decision-making body, from 1992 to 2012. Hu was the fifth paramount leader of China from 2002 to 2012.

Hu rose to power through the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), notably as Party Committee secretary for Guizhou province and the Tibet Autonomous Region, where his harsh repression of dissent gained him attention from the highest levels. He moved up to first secretary of the CCP Central Secretariat and vice president under CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin. Hu was the first leader of the Communist Party from a generation younger than those who participated in the civil war and the founding of the republic. Influential sponsors from the older generation promoted his rapid rise, including Song Ping, Hu Yaobang, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin.

During his term in office, Hu reintroduced state control in some sectors of the economy that were relaxed by the previous administration, and was conservative with political reforms. Along with his colleague Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, Hu presided over nearly a decade of consistent economic growth and development that cemented China as a major world power. He sought to improve socio-economic equality domestically through the Scientific Outlook on Development, which aimed to build a &quot;Harmonious Socialist Society&quot; that was prosperous and free of social conflict. Under his leadership, the authorities also cracked down on social disturbances, ethnic minority protests, and dissident figures, which also led to many controversial events such as the unrest in Tibet and the passing of the Anti-Secession Law. In foreign policy, Hu advocated for China&#x27;s peaceful rise, pursuing soft power in international relations and a corporate approach to diplomacy. Throughout Hu&#x27;s tenure, China&#x27;s influence in Africa, Latin America, and other developing regions increased.

Hu possessed a modest and reserved leadership style. His tenure was characterized by collective leadership and consensus-based rule. These traits made Hu an enigmatic figure in the public eye. His administration was known for its focus more on technocratic competence. At the end of his tenure after ten years in office, Hu won praise for retiring voluntarily from all positions. He was succeeded by Xi Jinping. Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu is the only living former paramount leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Early life, education, and family==

Hu Jintao was born on 21 December 1942 in Tai County, Jiangsu province, which was under Japanese occupation at the time. He is a direct descendant of the Ming dynasty general Hu Zongxian, known for fighting Japanese pirates. His branch of the family migrated from Jixi County, Anhui to Taizhou during his grandfather&#x27;s generation. Though his father owned a small tea trading business in Taizhou, the family was relatively poor. His mother was a teacher and died when he was 7, and he was raised by an aunt. Hu&#x27;s father was denounced during the Cultural Revolution, an event that (together with his relatively humble origins) apparently had a deep effect upon Hu, who diligently tried to clear his father&#x27;s name.

He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in April 1964. That year he graduated from Tsinghua University after studying hub hydropower stations at the Water Conservancy Engineering Department. He worked as a political counselor at Tsinghua. In July 1965, Hu began work as an engineer.

In 1968, during the Third Front construction, Hu volunteered for his service in Gansu and worked on the construction of Liujiaxia Hydroelectric Station while also managing CCP affairs for the local branch of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. From 1969 to 1974, he worked for Sinohydro Engineering Bureau.

In 1970, Hu married Liu Yongqing, whom he had met at Tsinghua University when they were studying there. They have two children together, Hu Haifeng and Hu Haiqing, their children-in-law named Julia Wong and Daniel Mao. Unlike Wen Jiabao, the premier, he never granted a public one-on-one interview with the media. He has been noted for his liking of table tennis and ballroom dancing. Hu is also said to possess a photographic memory that became evident in his high school days.

==Early political career==
In 1973, Hu was transferred to the Construction Department of Gansu as a secretary. The next year he was promoted to deputy senior party secretary. In 1980, Deng Xiaoping implemented the &quot;Four Transformations&quot; program, which aimed to produce communist leaders who were &quot;more revolutionary, younger, more knowledgeable, and more specialized.&quot; In response to this nationwide search for young party members, Song Ping, the first secretary of CCP Gansu Committee (Gansu&#x27;s governor) discovered Hu Jintao and promoted him several ranks to the position of deputy head of the commission. Another protégé of Song, Wen Jiabao, also became prominent at the same time.

In 1982, Hu was promoted to the position of Communist Youth League Gansu Branch secretary and was appointed as the director of the All-China Youth Federation. His mentor, Song Ping, was transferred to Beijing as Minister of Organization of the Chinese Communist Party, and was in charge of senior cadres&#x27; recommendation, candidacy and promotion. With the support of Hu Yaobang (no relation) and Deng Xiaoping, Hu was assured of a bright future in the party. At Song Ping&#x27;s suggestion, in 1982 central CCP authorities invited Hu to Beijing to study at the Central Party School. Soon after, he was transferred to Beijing and appointed to a position in the secretariat of the Communist Youth League Central Committee (&quot;CY Central&quot;). Two years later Hu was promoted to first secretary of CY Central, thus its actual leader. During his term in the Youth League, Hu escorted Hu Yaobang, who was CCP general secretary then, in visits around the country. Hu Yaobang, himself a veteran coming from the Youth League, could reminiscence his youth through Hu&#x27;s company.

===Leading the party in Guizhou===
In 1985, Communist Party general secretary Hu Yaobang pushed for Hu Jintao to be transferred to Guizhou as the provincial Committee secretary of the Chinese Communist Party. Hu attempted to improve the economy of the backwater province, and reputedly visited all of its eighty-six counties. While in Guizhou, Hu was careful to follow Beijing&#x27;s directives and had a reputation of being &quot;airtight&quot;; he rarely would offer his views on policy matters in public. While Hu was generally seen as an official with integrity and honesty, some locals preferred his predecessor Zhu Houze. In 1987, Hu Jintao handled the local students protest parallel to the Democracy Wall carefully, whereas in Beijing similar protests resulted in Hu Yaobang&#x27;s forced resignation.

===Tenure in Tibet===
Hu Yaobang was purged by Deng Xiaoping in 1987 due to his &#x27;liberal&#x27; tendencies, and his departure from the political scene was initially seen as unfavourable towards Hu Jintao, who drew criticism from party elders for failing to criticize the ousted reformer. In 1988, Hu Jintao was transferred to become Party Regional Committee secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while also taking on the role of Political commissar of the local People&#x27;s Liberation Army units. This made Hu effectively the number-one figure in the vast, restive region. A number of Tibetans have long been opposed to government policy in the region. Unrest and ethnic conflict were brewing, particularly anti-Han sentiments among segments of ethnic Tibetan society. Minor clashes had been occurring since 1987, and when the scale of unrest grew, Hu responded with the deployment of some 1,700 People&#x27;s Armed Police into Lhasa in February 1989 in an attempt to warn against further disturbance. Increased clashes culminated in serious rioting in Lhasa&#x27;s core on 5 March 1989, five days before the 30th anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan uprising. What occurred after is a matter of dispute. Rioters accused the police of shooting them arbitrarily, and the police claimed that they had acted in self-defense. In addition, there was speculation that Hu delayed his orders to clamp down on the protesters until late into the evening, when the police chief was forced to act because the situation was spiraling out of control. The protesters were suppressed early into the next day, and Hu asked Beijing to declare martial law on 8 March.

Hu&#x27;s role in the demonstrations and rioting on 5 March was never made clear. While it is general protocol that Hu must have at least implicitly approved the use of force against protesters, whether he actually gave orders throughout 5 March is a matter of debate. In addition, John Tkacik cites that Hu had been coordinating with the Chengdu Military Region for troops to be on full alert as the situation progressed. Some diplomatic analysts linked what they saw as Hu&#x27;s brutal use of force to the suppression of activists and students in Tiananmen Square, which took place three months later. Whether Hu provided &quot;inspiration&quot; for the PLA on 4 June is a matter of debate, but it was clear that Hu&#x27;s actions in Lhasa earned him unprecedented attention in the upper echelons of party power, including by &quot;paramount leader&quot; Deng Xiaoping. When tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square, Hu was one of the first regional leaders to publicly declare his support for the central authorities.

Hu experienced high-altitude sickness in June 1990, and returned to Beijing, but remained in his position for another two years, during which he achieved little. His departure to Beijing was seen, however, simply as a pretext to return to the center of Chinese politics, which led to some doubts as to whether or not he was as ill as he had claimed. Martin Seiff of United Press International commented on Putin and Hu: &quot;Both are tough and able authoritarians who had extensive experience of repressing dissent on their rise to the top.&quot;

==Rise to power==

Before the opening of the 14th National Congress of the CCP in 1992, senior party leaders, including Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the CCP Politburo Standing Committee (PSC) to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.). Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders. Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest (aged 49 in October 1992) member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.

In 1992, Hu took charge of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party as its first secretary, which oversaw day-to-day operations of the CCP Central Committee, and the Central Party School, which was convenient for him to bring up his own supporters among senior CCP cadres. Hu was also put in charge of the ideological work of the CCP. Although Hu was considered heir apparent to Jiang, he always took great care to ensure that Jiang be at the center of the spotlight. In late 1998, Hu promoted Jiang&#x27;s unpopular movement of the &quot;Three Stresses&quot;&quot;stress study, stress politics, and stress healthy trends&quot;giving speeches to promote it. In 2001, he publicized Jiang&#x27;s Three Represents theory, which Jiang hoped to place himself on the same level as other Marxist theoreticians. In 1998, Hu became vice president, and Jiang wanted Hu to play a more active role in foreign affairs. Hu became China&#x27;s leading voice during the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.

==Leadership==
===Succeeding Jiang===

On 15 November 2002, after the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, a new Hu Jintao-led Politburo nominally succeeded Jiang&#x27;s, while Hu became the CCP general secretary, effectively making him the paramount leader. Additionally, Wen Jiabao became the premier. However, Jiang was re-elected to the post of chairman of the Central Military Commission, the top military body, despite Hu taking over as the general secretary. Jiang resigned as CMC chairman in September 2004, his last official post. Following Jiang&#x27;s stepping-down, Hu had officially taken on the three institutions in the People&#x27;s Republic of China where power lie; the party, the state, as well as the military.

Deng Xiaoping appointed three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, and was instrumental in the ousting of two of them, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. His third and final selection, Jiang Zemin, won Deng&#x27;s continued, although ambiguous, backing and was the only general secretary in Communist Chinese history to voluntarily leave his post when his term ended.

Although Jiang, then 76, stepped down as general secretary and from the Politburo Standing Committee to make way for a younger leadership, there was speculation that Jiang would retain significant influence because Hu was not associated with Jiang&#x27;s influential Shanghai clique, to which six out of the nine members of the all-powerful Standing Committee were believed to be linked. However, later developments show that many of its members had shifted their positions. Zeng Qinghong, for example, moved from a disciple of Jiang to serving as an intermediary between the two factions.

Hu was mostly conservative on political reforms during his tenure. In the beginning of 2006, Hu launched the &quot;Eight Honors and Eight Shames&quot; movement in a bid to promote a more selfless and moral outlook amongst the population. At the 17th CCP National Congress, Hu was re-elected as general secretary of the Central Committee and chairman of the CCP Central Military Commission on 22 October 2007. At the 11th National People&#x27;s Congress, Hu was re-elected as president on 15 March 2008. He was also re-elected as chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission.

===Domestic policy===
====SARS crisis====
The first crisis of Hu&#x27;s leadership happened during the outbreak of SARS in 2003. Following strong criticism of China for initially covering up and responding slowly to the crisis, he dismissed several party and government officials, including the health minister, who supported Jiang, and the Mayor of Beijing, Meng Xuenong, widely perceived as Hu&#x27;s protégé.


====Economic policies====
Hu and Wen Jiabao took a more conservative approach towards reforms, and began to reverse some of Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s reforms in 2005. Observers note that the government adopted more egalitarian and populist policies. The administration increased subsidies and control over the health care sector, increased funding for education, halted privatization, and adopted a loose monetary policy, which led to the formation of a U.S.-style property bubble in which property prices tripled.

The privileged state sector was the primary recipient of government investment, which, under the new administration, promoted the rise of large national champions which could compete with large foreign corporations. During Hu&#x27;s administration, the Chinese government increasingly funded the consolidation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), supplying massive subsidies and favoring SOEs in regulatory matters. These efforts helped SOEs to crowd out foreign and domestic private sector competitors. Nevertheless, the share of SOEs in the total number of companies have continued to fall, dropping to 5%, though their share of total output remained at 26%. Exchange rates for the yuan were also liberalized and the peg to the U.S. dollar was broken, leading the yuan to rise by 31% against the dollar from 2005 to 2012. China&#x27;s economic growth has averaged around 10% under Hu, while the economy surpassed the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan.

After taking over, Hu and Wen proposed to set up a Harmonious Society which aimed at lessening inequality and changing the style of the &quot;GDP first and Welfare Second&quot; policies. They focused on sectors of the Chinese population that had been left behind by the economic reform, and took a number of high-profile trips to the poorer areas of China with the stated goal of understanding these areas better. Hu and Wen Jiabao also attempted to move China away from a policy of favouring economic growth at all costs and toward a more balanced view of growth that includes factors in social inequality and environmental damage, including the use of the green gross domestic product in personnel decisions. Jiang&#x27;s clique, however, maintained control in most developing areas; as a result, Hu and Wen&#x27;s macroeconomic regulation measures faced great resistance.

==== Media ====
In media policy, Hu discussed the idea of &quot;channeling&quot; public opinion, a term he first used in a 23 January 2007 Politburo meeting. Hu stated that the Party should &quot;grasp the online discourse power, enhance our ability to channel online discussions, emphasize the art of &#x27;channeling&#x27;, actively leverage new technologies, increase positive coverage, and promote a positive mainstream discourse.&quot; In an online discussion via the Strong China Forum, Hu stated that China should &quot;strengthen our traditional media and new media and form a new setting for channeling public opinion&quot;.

====Tibet====

=== Foreign policy ===

Under Hu&#x27;s leadership, China continued its style of developmental diplomacy which had been adopted under Deng Xiaoping and continued by Jiang Zemin. China&#x27;s international behavior continued to be generally pragmatic and predictable. Hu pledged that China would seek peaceful development in a harmonious world to assure the international community that China&#x27;s economic growth offered opportunities and benefits rather than conflicts. The key attributes of a harmonious world view of foreign policy are building and accepting a world where countries diverge in their paths of national development and political systems, coexistence of diverse civilizations, and rejected unilateralism and hegemonic ambitions.

In 2006, Hu articulated the four phases of China&#x27;s foreign policy developmental objectives: (1) big powers were the key, (2) periphery countries the priority, (3) developing countries the foundation, and (4) multilateralism the stage.

In 2009, Chinese leader Hu Jintao called for a bolstered arms control agenda at the United Nations General Assembly, joining United States President Barack Obama&#x27;s earlier calls for a nuclear-free world.

Throughout Hu&#x27;s tenure, China&#x27;s cooperation with global south countries increased.

He sought to develop China&#x27;s relationship with Japan, which he visited in 2008. He downgraded relations with Russia because of unfulfilled deals.

Hu emphasized an international relations premise of &quot;shared responsibility&quot;: China would contribute to global common good, but it must not adversely affect its core interests in doing so, and its commitments must be conditional to those of other nations. In the analysis of academic Suisheng Zhao, under Hu&#x27;s leadership, &quot;China remained a reluctant rising power and selectively took on global and regional obligations. Chinese foreign policy became omnidirectional, multilevel, and multidimensional.&quot;

====Taiwan====
Early in his leadership, Hu faced a pro-independence counterpart in then Republic of China (ROC) president Chen Shui-bian. Chen called for talks without any preconditions, repudiating the 1992 Consensus. Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had continued to express an ultimate goal of de jure Taiwanese independence, and made statements on the political status of Taiwan that the PRC considers provocative. Hu&#x27;s initial response was a combination of &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; approaches. On the one hand, Hu expressed a flexibility to negotiate on many issues of concern to Taiwan. On the other hand, he continued to refuse talks without preconditions and remained committed to Chinese unification as an ultimate goal. While Hu gave some signs of being more flexible with regard to political relationships with Taiwan as in his May 17 Statement, where he offered to address the issue of &quot;international living space&quot; for Taiwan, Hu&#x27;s government remained firm in its position that the PRC would not tolerate any attempt by the Taiwanese government to declare de jure independence from China.

After Chen&#x27;s re-election in 2004, Hu&#x27;s government changed tactics, conducting a no-contact policy with Taiwan due to Chen and the DPP&#x27;s independence leanings and repudiation of the 1992 consensus. The government maintained its military build-up against Taiwan, and pursued a vigorous policy of isolating Taiwan diplomatically. In March 2005, the Anti-Secession Law was passed by the National People&#x27;s Congress, formalizing &quot;non-peaceful means&quot; as an option of response to a declaration of independence in Taiwan.

Hu&#x27;s government increased contacts with the Kuomintang (KMT), its former foe in the Chinese Civil War, and still a major party in Taiwan. The increased contacts culminated in the 2005 Pan-Blue visits to mainland China, including a historic meeting between Hu and then-KMT chairman Lien Chan in April 2005. This was the first meeting between the leaders of the two parties since the conclusion of World War II.

On 20 March 2008, the Kuomintang under Ma Ying-jeou won the presidency in Taiwan, and a majority in the Legislative Yuan. Thereafter Hu immediately turned to a more &#x27;soft&#x27; diplomatic approach and opened the way to a thaw in relations between the two sides. A series of historic meetings between the CCP and KMT have followed. On 12 April 2008, Hu Jintao met with Taiwan&#x27;s vice president-elect Vincent Siew in the latter&#x27;s role as chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market Foundation during the Boao Forum for Asia. On 28 May 2008, Hu met with KMT chairman Wu Po-hsiung, the first meeting between the heads of the CCP and the KMT as ruling parties. During this meeting, Hu and Wu agreed that both sides should re-commence official dialogue under the 1992 consensus – that &quot;both sides recognize there is only one China, but agree to differ on its definition.&quot; Wu committed the new government in Taiwan against Taiwanese independence; Hu committed his government to addressing the concerns of the Taiwanese people in regard to security, dignity, and &quot;international living space&quot;, with a priority given to allowing Taiwan to participate in the World Health Organization.

In addition to the party-to-party dialogue, de facto governmental dialogue took place via the Straits Exchange Foundation and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits in June 2008 on the basis of the 1992 Consensus, with the first meeting held in Beijing. Both Hu and his new counterpart Ma Ying-jeou agreed that the 1992 Consensus is the basis for negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan strait. On 26 March 2008, Hu Jintao held a telephone talk with then US president George W. Bush, in which he became the first Chinese leader to officially recognize the 1992 Consensus. After several months of negotiations, in December 2008, the two sides agreed on the resumption of the Three Links, i.e., a re-opening of mail, trade, and direct air links between the two sides. Relations continued to be cordial between the two sides during Hu&#x27;s tenure, and trade increased immensely, culminating in the signing of the preferential trade agreement Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in 2010.

===Transition to Xi===
On 15 November 2012, immediately after the 18th CCP National Congress, Xi was elected to the posts of general secretary of the CCP and chairman of the CMC by the 18th Central Committee, succeeding Hu. On 14 March 2013, he was succeeded by Xi as president.

==After retirement==
Since his retirement, Hu has kept a low-profile, rarely making public appearances. In September 2013, Hu visited an ancestral family home in Huangshan, Anhui, though the trip was not covered by state media. In April 2014, he made an appearance in Hunan, visiting Hunan University and other historical sites. He attended the 19th CCP National Congress in October 2017. He also attended the 70th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October 2019, and the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021.

=== 20th Communist Party Congress ===
At the closing ceremony of the 20th CCP National Congress on 22 October 2022, Hu, who had been sitting next to Xi, was pulled from his seat and escorted out of the hall by two men in suits and with name badges. This incident occurred before the votes that day, which Hu was absent from as a result. Xinhua News Agency, China&#x27;s official press agency, stated that Hu was not feeling well, while foreign news speculated about whether Hu was genuinely sick or whether this was a deliberate political signal by Xi. The incident was not broadcast in China and both Hu&#x27;s and his son&#x27;s names were blocked by Chinese censors.

=== Jiang Zemin&#x27;s funeral ===
Following the death of his predecessor Jiang Zemin, Hu was appointed to serve on the funeral committee, ranked 36th on the list out of over 700 names. Hu Jintao appeared in public alongside Xi Jinping on 5 December 2022, attending the farewell ceremony before Jiang&#x27;s body was cremated in Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. He was accompanied by an aide.

==Legacy==
Hu presided over a decade of consistent economic growth, led China through the storm of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed, and increased China&#x27;s international stature immensely. China&#x27;s achievements under Hu included modernizing China&#x27;s infrastructure, launching China&#x27;s first crewed space probe, and sponsoring two successful international events: the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai Expo. In addition, Hu&#x27;s &quot;soft approach&quot; to Taiwan, coinciding with the election of a Kuomintang government in Taipei, improved the relationship between mainland China and Taiwan. Trade and contact between the two sides increased significantly during Hu&#x27;s tenure. In addition, Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao&#x27;s populist policies have resulted in the elimination of agricultural taxes for farmers, more flexible policies towards migrant workers living in cities, more balanced development between the coastal regions and the hinterlands, enforcing minimum wage in cities and the promotion of sustainable and affordable housing developments. The response to the SARS public health crisis and the massive expansion of health insurance coverage for middle- to low-income citizens earned Hu accolades domestically. Generally speaking, these policies have been well received by the Chinese public.

In foreign policy, Hu&#x27;s critics say that his government was overly aggressive in asserting its new power, overestimated its reach, and raised the ire and apprehension of various neighbours, including Southeast Asian countries, India, and Japan. Such policies are also said to be provocative towards the United States. Domestic critics, including the country&#x27;s elites, intellectuals, and particularly dissidents, point to various shortcomings of the Hu administration and his failure in implementing his signature &quot;Socialist Harmonious Society&quot; policy. They cite, for example, that China&#x27;s internal security budget exceeded its military budget during Hu&#x27;s tenure as protests and other &#x27;mass incidents&#x27; continued to increase across the country. China&#x27;s Gini coefficient climbed to 0.47 by 2010, indicating a potentially unsustainable gap between the rich and the poor. The Hu administration&#x27;s inability to rein in the wealth gap and its renewed emphasis on the role of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the economy led some economists to believe that Hu missed a critical opportunity for reform and structural adjustment. Hu&#x27;s increased support for SOEs, including to merger and consolidate, is a trend that has continued during the administration of Xi Jinping.

Hu&#x27;s tough-on-corruption policies saw mixed results. While there were some attempts to increase transparency in the expenditures of official organs and bureaucrats, deeply entrenched systemic issues that were contributing to the growth of corruption remained unresolved. In addition, the massive corruption scandal that ensnared the military shortly after Hu&#x27;s departure from office showed that Hu was unable to tackle entrenched interests in the military. In his own departing speech at the 18th Party Congress, Hu emphasized the potentially devastating effects that unchecked corruption would have on the party and the country. Moreover, the Hu administration&#x27;s insistence on censorship and the curtailing of freedom of speech drew extensive criticism from human rights organizations and Western governments, while artists and writers inside the country chided increased restrictions on cultural expressions during Hu&#x27;s term. Although in the early years of his tenure Hu attempted to pioneer a form of &quot;intraparty democracy&quot; that called for greater participation from lower-ranked members to determine policy and select the leadership, there was little evidence of meaningful changes to the party&#x27;s governing structure and decision-making process. His focus on intraparty democracy did result in the Politburo work report system and the invitation of approximately 200 members of the Central Committee to cast nonbinding votes for Politburo candidates.

Consensus-based decision-making became a hallmark of the Hu era. Hu was never a strongman, did not rule with an iron fist, and was often seen as first-among-equals with his Politburo Standing Committee colleagues. Some called China&#x27;s political landscape during Hu&#x27;s era one of &quot;nine dragons taming the water&quot; (), that is, nine PSC members each ruling over their own fief. In addition, Hu not only faced a profusion of special interest groups and political factions within the party, his ability to implement a cohesive program was also constrained by the influence of former leader Jiang Zemin. Consequently, there is debate on how much power Hu held personally to effect change. Nevertheless, within the context of the system he was placed in, Hu was credited for being an effective mediator and consensus-builder. Hu also won praise for stepping down as military chief in favour of his successor Xi Jinping, and at the same time relinquishing his position as general secretary. This was seen as a message to the establishment and Jiang Zemin that elders should retire according to protocol and avoid meddling in the affairs of their successors.

==Political positions==

===Scientific Outlook on Development===

Political observers indicate that Hu distinguished himself from his predecessor in both domestic and foreign policy. Hu&#x27;s political philosophy during his leadership is summarized by three slogans — a &quot;Harmonious Socialist Society&quot; domestically and &quot;Peaceful Development&quot; internationally, the former aided by the Scientific Development Concept, which seeks integrated sets of solutions to arrays of economic, environmental and social problems, and recognizes, in inner circles, a need for cautious and gradual political reforms. The Scientific Outlook on Development was written into the CCP and State Constitutions in 2007 and 2008, respectively. The role of the Party has changed, as formulated by Deng Xiaoping and implemented by Jiang Zemin, from a revolutionary party to a ruling party. During his tenure he continued the Party&#x27;s modernization, calling for both &quot;Advancement&quot; of the Party and its increasing transparency in governance.

What emerges from these philosophies, in Hu&#x27;s view, is a country with a systematic approach to national structure and development that combines dynamic economic growth, a free market energized by a vigorous &quot;nonpublic&quot; (i.e., private) sector, heavy-handed political and media control, personal but not political freedoms, concern for the welfare of all citizens, cultural enlightenment, and a synergistic approach to diverse social issues (the Scientific Development Perspective) that lead, in Hu&#x27;s vision, to a &quot;Harmonious Socialist Society&quot;. In the view of the Chinese government, these philosophies, which have created a new &quot;China Model&quot; of governance, serve as a legitimate alternative to the West&#x27;s &quot;Democracy Model&quot;, particularly for developing countries. In Hu&#x27;s words, &quot;A Harmonious Socialist Society should feature democracy, the rule of law, equity, justice, sincerity, amity and vitality.&quot; Such a society, he says, will give full scope to people&#x27;s talent and creativity, enable all the people to share the social wealth brought by reform and development, and forge an ever-closer relationship between the people and government. Hu even emphasized the potential of religious communities to contribute to economic and social development under the banner of &quot;Building a Harmonious Socialist Society.&quot;

Some observers attribute the political origins of low-carbon development strategy to Hu&#x27;s Scientific Outlook on Development, although some industrial support in this area had already begun before Hu&#x27;s formulation of the Scientific Outlook on Development.

Western criticism of Hu, particularly regarding human rights, exposes his hypersensitivity to social stability but does not lay as much emphasis on his fresh commitment to address China&#x27;s multi-faceted social problems. Hu&#x27;s pragmatic, non-ideological agenda had two core values—maintaining social stability to further economic development and sustaining Chinese culture to enrich national sovereignty. In domestic policy, he seems to want more openness to the public on governmental functions and meetings. Recently, China&#x27;s news agency published many Politburo Standing Committee meeting details. He also cancelled many events that are traditionally practiced, such as the lavish send-off and welcoming-back ceremonies of Chinese leaders when visiting foreign lands. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership under Hu also focused on such problems as the gap between rich and poor and uneven development between the interior and coastal regions. Both party and state seem to have moved away from a definition of development that focuses solely on GDP growth and toward a definition which includes social equality and environment effects.

In June 2007, Hu gave an important speech at the Central Party School that was indicative of his position of power and his guiding philosophies. In the speech Hu used a very populist tone to appeal to ordinary Chinese, making serious note of the recent challenges China was facing, especially with regards to income disparity. In addition, Hu noted the need for &quot;increased democracy&quot; in the country.

===Moral guidance===
In response to the great number of social problems in China, in March 2006, Hu Jintao released the &quot;Eight Honors and Eight Shames&quot; as a set of moral codes to be followed by the Chinese people, and emphasized the need to spread the message to the youth. Alternatively known as the &quot;Eight Honors and Disgraces&quot;, it contained eight poetic lines which summarized what a good citizen should regard as an honor and what to regard as a shame. It has been widely regarded as one of Hu Jintao&#x27;s ideological solutions to the perceived increasing lack of morality in China after Chinese economic reforms brought in a generation of Chinese predominantly concerned with earning money and power in an increasingly frail social fabric.

It has become a norm for Chinese communist leaders to make their own contributions to Marxist–Leninist theory. Whether this is Hu&#x27;s contribution to Marxist–Leninist theory is debatable, but its general reception with the Chinese public has been moderate. Its promotion, however, is visible almost everywhere: in classroom posters, banners on the street, and electronic display boards for the preparation of the 2008 Olympics, and Expo 2010 in Shanghai. The codes differ from the ideologies of his predecessors, namely, Jiang&#x27;s Three Represents, Deng Xiaoping Theory, and Mao Zedong Thought in that the focus, for the first time, has been shifted to codifying moral standards as opposed to setting social or economic goals.

== Public image ==
&quot;Newsweek&quot; named Hu the second most powerful person in the world in 2009, referring to him as &quot;the man behind the wheel of the world&#x27;s most supercharged economy.&quot; &quot;Forbes&quot; also named him the second most powerful person in the world later that year. Hu was named the 2010 World&#x27;s Most Powerful Person by &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot;. Hu was listed four times (2008, 2007, 2005 and 2004) on the Time 100 annual list of most influential people. In 2010, Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit and non-governmental organization with the stated aim of safeguarding the right to freedom of information, included Hu among the list of press freedom predators.

The population was 53,818 at the 2010 census, down from 57,755 at the 2000 census. In 2020, its population was 56,039. In the 19th century, initial attempts to settle the area had all failed, mostly. However, in 1895, Arthur Stilwell founded Port Arthur, and the town quickly grew, being incorporated as a city in 1898. It soon developed into a seaport and, eventually, became the center of a large oil-refinery network. The Rainbow Bridge across the Neches River connects Port Arthur to Bridge City.

Due to its location on the Gulf of Mexico, Port Arthur is vulnerable to hurricanes and other intense tropical weather, as well as extreme heatwaves, high humidity, and freak tornadoes. Since its inception, the city has experienced several incidences of extreme weather resulting in significant damages and casualties.

==History==
Aurora was an early settlement attempt near the mouth of Taylor Bayou on Sabine Lake, about long and wide. It is a saltwater estuary formed by the confluence of the Neches and Sabine Rivers. Through its tidal outlet, Sabine Pass, Sabine Lake drains some of Texas and Louisiana into the Gulf of Mexico.

The town was conceived in 1837, and in 1840 promoters led by Almanzon Huston were offering town lots for sale. Some were sold, but Huston&#x27;s project failed to attract many settlers. The area next was known as &quot;Sparks&quot;, after John Sparks, who moved his family to the shores of Sabine Lake near the site of Aurora. The Eastern Texas Railroad, completed between Sabine Pass and Beaumont, Texas, passed west of Sparks. However, the American Civil War soon began, and rail lines were removed. In 1886, a destructive hurricane hit the coast, causing the remaining residents to dismantle their homes and move to Beaumont. By 1895, Aurora had become a ghost town.

Arthur Stilwell led the resettling of the area as part of his planned city as the southern terminus of his Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad, predecessor to the Kansas City Southern Railway. Stilwell named the city Port Arthur after himself, not the British Royal Navy Lieutenant who gave his name to Port Arthur, China.

Pleasure Island now separates the city from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. The man-made island was created between 1899 and 1908 by the Corps of Engineers to support development of the port.

Arthur Stilwell founded the Port Arthur Channel and Dock Company to manage the port facilities. The port officially opened with the arrival of the British steamer &quot;Saint Oswald&quot; in 1899.

When oil was discovered at Spindletop, the J.M. Guffey Petroleum Company, later Gulf Oil, had run pipelines to Port Arthur as a shipping point and a location for an oil refinery. In November 1901, the first tanker, the &quot;Cardium&quot;, departed with Spindletop oil. The refinery was enlarged in 1902, and a pipeline connected to the Glenn Pool Oil Reserve in Oklahoma. The Texas Company, later Texaco, also started building a refinery in 1902. By 1916, the Port Arthur refinery was one of the three largest in the United States.

In 1977, a slate of four black candidates (McElroy, Benjamin, Linden, and Strawder) challenged four white city council members, including Mayor Bernis Sadler. The &quot;torrid&quot; election (as the Port Arthur News described it) led to the 1982 Supreme Court voting rights decision in City of Port Arthur v. United States.

In 2015, the city council proposed an ordinance to declare Port Arthur a &quot;film friendly city&quot;. In October 2021, Governor Abbott announced that the city had officially been declared a &quot;film friendly city&quot; by the Texas Film Commission.

===Tropical cyclones===
==== Hurricane of September 12, 1897 ====
Celebrations in Port Arthur on completion of the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad between Kansas City and Port Arthur occurred Saturday, September 11, 1897. The celebrations brought additional people into town. The next day, a major hurricane hit Port Arthur. Water flowed five feet deep in the streets. People loaded into the unfinished railroad roundhouse seeking shelter; the building promptly collapsed, killing four. In the end, 13 people died, homes were destroyed, and a pleasure pier was severely damaged.

==== Hurricane Audrey ====
In June 1957, Hurricane Audrey made landfall just east of Port Arthur in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, as a category 3 hurricane. The storm caused extensive wind damage around the city and significant storm surge flooding just east in Southwest Louisiana.

==== Hurricane Rita ====
On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita made landfall between Sabine Pass, Texas, and Johnson Bayou, Louisiana, as a category 3 hurricane. A wind gust of was recorded in Port Arthur.

==== Hurricane Ike ====
On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike made landfall on Galveston Island as a category 2 hurricane. Due to the storm&#x27;s unusually large size, effects were widespread and were felt across much of Southeast Texas. Port Arthur sustained significant wind damage and many of the city&#x27;s residents lost power. The Port Arthur seawall protected the city from the major flooding that surrounding cities experienced.

==== Hurricane Harvey ====
On August 29, 2017, after Harvey made a second landfall at tropical storm status, 26 inches of rain fell in a single day at the airport near Port Arthur, triggering widespread flash flooding in the city. According to the Port Arthur mayor Derrick Freeman, 20,000 homes were flooded with up to 6 ft of water. On August 30, Freeman posted on Facebook, &quot;Our whole city is underwater right now.&quot;

==== Hurricane Laura ====
On August 25, 2020, with Hurricane Laura expected to make landfall as a major hurricane having Port Arthur in its direct path, Port Arthur was evacuated. However, turning almost due north, Laura ended up making its final landfall near Cameron, Louisiana.

=== Climate ===

==Economy==

Home to a large portion of United States oil refining capacity, Port Arthur has seen renewed investment in several key installations. Motiva Enterprises began undertaking a major addition to its western Port Arthur refinery, expanding capacity to . This $10.0 billion project is the largest U..S refinery expansion to occur in 30 years. Premcor Refining (now Valero) completed a $775 million expansion of its petrochemical plant, and BASF/Fina commenced operations of a new $1.75 billion gasification and cogeneration unit on premises of its current installation, which had just completed its own $1 billion upgrade. These operations are supported by the Port of Port Arthur, one of Texas&#x27; leading seaports.

The city was the site of an oil spill in 2010, when an oil tanker and barge collided, causing 450,000 gallons of oil to spill into the Sabine/Neches waterway alongside the city.

===Central business district disintegration===
The commercial center of Port Arthur was at its peak in the early 1900s. Together with the effects of suburbanization, which drew off wealthier residents to new housing away from town, gradually taking businesses with them, from 1960 until 1974, successive waves of economic recession caused much distress in the town. The central business district has many boarded up and vacant locations.

====Hotel Sabine====
The Hotel Sabine opened at 600 Proctor Street in 1929 and operated as the Vaughn Hotel until the mid-1930s. At 118 feet, 10 stories, and the tallest building in Port Arthur, the building is of Beaux-Arts architecture style, built with steel-reinforced concrete and brick on 640 steel-laced wooden cypress pilings driven 60 ft into the ground. It was overdesigned and overbuilt due to lack of knowledge on the strength of concrete in the 1920&#x27;s. The hotel closed down in the mid-1980s.

The &quot;Port Arthur News&quot; reported August 28, 2010, that &quot;DWA (Digital Workforce Academy) Buys Sabine Hotel&quot;, By November 2011, the hotel was reported to be slated for demolition. The cost of renovations were estimated at $10–12 million and demolition estimates as $500,000 to $1.2 million. As of April, 2021, Motiva was still considering buying the hotel, but remained uncertain and uncommitted to it.

Hurricane Rita struck a direct hit on the Proctor Street Seawall, and damaged many downtown businesses and homes. As economic activity picked up in the region, calls for downtown revitalization have been advanced. The true center of commercial activity has gravitated from downtown to other areas. The main shopping center is Central Mall, opened outside the downtown in 1982.

==Arts and culture==
Port Arthur&#x27;s Museum of the Gulf Coast is recognized as the area&#x27;s definitive collection of items and displays for figures from Port Arthur and the surrounding communities.

UGK, perhaps Texas&#x27;s most influential hip-hop group, originated in Port Arthur before relocating to Houston.

<text>Burleson ( ) is a city in Johnson and Tarrant counties in the U.S. state of Texas. It is a suburb of Fort Worth. At the 2010 census it had a population of 36,690, and in 2019 it had an estimated population of 48,225. By the 2020 census, its population grew to 48,132 with a 2024 census-estimated population of 57,625.

==History==
The Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, known as &quot;the Katy&quot;, extended its service from Denison to Waco. In 1880 the segment from Fort Worth to Alvarado was being laid out, and a midway depot was needed. Grenville M. Dodge, representing the railroad, purchased land for the depot and a town surrounding it from Rev. Henry C. Renfro at the site of what is now called &quot;Old Town&quot; Burleson. As part of the agreement, Renfro named the town &quot;Burleson&quot;, in honor of his teacher Rufus Columbus Burleson, the president of Baylor University. The first lot was sold on October 10, 1880, the date now considered the city&#x27;s &quot;founding day&quot;.

The Burleson Post Office opened in 1882, inside a retail establishment, as was common for small towns at the time. On February 20, 1895, a fire burned down most of the business district, along with several houses. One of the Katy workers, J. C. Jones, had stayed in Burleson and opened a water works for the town, drilling a deep well that provided dozens of hydrants for the residents, but they were not sufficient to extinguish the fire. By the end of the 1800s, Burleson was a bustling rural town, with farms all around, schools, a grocery store, cotton gins and grist mills, a general store, a druggist, a bank, and a jeweler. In 1899, a group of nine women formed a society for cultural advancement and called it the Eumathian Club. The women acquired books, loaned them, and held readings, discussions, and music recitals.

In 1909 the Texas Legislature passed a bill forming the Burleson Independent School District. Construction began in 1912 of the Northern Texas Traction Company interurban line between Fort Worth and Cleburne, with Burleson as a stop along the way. The first day of service was September 1, 1912, with 1,200 passengers on the ten passenger runs that day. Two freight runs per day were made as well. The interurban line provided for the first time two very important things to Burleson: easy access to Fort Worth and Cleburne, and electricity. The interurban station was operated out of a drugstore, whose proprietor became ticket master, and who served travelers pastries and soda from the soda fountain. The old drugstore/station still exists, as the Burleson Heritage Museum at the Burleson Visitor Center, as do two of the interurban cars.

That year, a petition was sent to a Johnson County judge proposing to incorporate the &quot;Town of Burleson&quot;, including a survey of the town limits that included most of the original town as set out by Grenville Dodge. An election was held, the petition passed, and the county judge ordered it so. On May 21, 1912, Burleson was incorporated.

The 1920 census showed the population of Burleson to be 241. In 1930 the population was 591. Due to the increasing popularity of automobiles, combined with the Great Depression, the interurban line closed in 1931. In 1940 the population decreased to 573, as people had left Burleson during the depression to find jobs wherever they could. In 1950 the population was 791, and grew to 2,345 in 1960, perhaps partly due to the opening of Interstate 35 through the town that year. By 1970 the population was 7,713, by 1980 11,734. In 1990 the population of Burleson was 16,113. In 2000 the population had grown to 20,976, and in 2010 there were 36,690 people in Burleson.

<doc id="151215" wikidata="Q128295" url="?curid=151215" title="Abilene, Texas">
<text>Abilene ( ) is a city in Taylor and Jones counties, Texas, United States. Its population was 125,182 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Abilene metropolitan statistical area, which had a population of 176,579 as of 2020. Abilene is home to three Christian universities: Abilene Christian University, McMurry University, and Hardin–Simmons University. It is the county seat of Taylor County. Dyess Air Force Base is located on the west side of the city.

Abilene is located on Interstate 20, which forms a rounded bypass loop along the northern side of the city, between exits 279 on its western edge and 292 on the east. The city is located west of Fort Worth. Multiple freeways form a loop surrounding the city&#x27;s core: I-20 on the north, US 83/84/277 on the west, and Loop 322 to the east. The former Texas and Pacific Railway, now part of the Union Pacific mainline, divides the city into well-established north and south zones. The historic downtown area is on the north side of the railroad, while the growing south of downtown Abilene &quot;SODA&quot; district is located on the south side of the tracks.

==History==
Established by cattlemen as a stock shipping point on the Texas and Pacific Railway in 1881, the city was named after Abilene, Kansas, the original endpoint for the Chisholm Trail. The T&amp;P had bypassed the town of Buffalo Gap, the county seat at the time. Eventually, a landowner north of Buffalo Gap, Clabe Merchant, known as the father of Abilene, chose the name for the new town. According to a Dallas newspaper, about 800 people had already begun camping at the townsite before the lots were sold. The town was laid out by Colonel J. Stoddard Johnson, and the auction of lots began early on March 15, 1881. By the end of the first day, 139 lots were sold for a total of $23,810, and another 178 lots were sold the next day for $27,550.

Abilene was incorporated soon after being founded in 1881, and residents began to set their sights on bringing the county seat to Abilene. In a three-to-one vote, they won the county election to do so. In 1888, the Progressive Committee was formed to attract businesses to the area, and in 1890 renamed itself as the Board of Trade. By 1900, 3,411 people lived in Abilene. In that decade, the Board of Trade changed its name to the 25,000 Club, in the hope of reaching a population of 25,000 by the next census. By 1910, though, the population had increased only to 9,204. Another group was formed, the Young Men&#x27;s Booster Club, which became the Abilene Chamber of Commerce in 1914.

The cornerstone was laid in 1891 for Simmons College, the first of three universities in Abilene. It later developed as Hardin–Simmons University. Childers Classical Institute was founded in 1906, and developed as Abilene Christian University, the largest of the three. In 1923, McMurry College was founded; it later expanded its offerings as McMurry University.

In the late 20th century, Abilene succeeded in gaining branches of Texas State Technical College and Cisco College. Headquarters of the latter institution are located in the city.

In 1940, Abilene raised the money to purchase land to attract establishment of a U.S. Army base southwest of town. It was named Camp Barkeley. When fully operational, it was twice the size of Abilene, with 60,000 men. When the base closed after World War II, many worried that Abilene could become a ghost town, but as the national economy boomed, many veterans returned to start businesses in Abilene.

In the early 1950s, to advocate for an Air Force base, residents raised to purchase of land. The southern block of congressmen gained approval for such a base here. For decades, Dyess Air Force Base has been the city&#x27;s largest employer, with 6076 employees in 2007.

From 1950 to 1960, Abilene&#x27;s population nearly doubled, from 45,570 to 90,638. In 1960, a second high school was added to the city&#x27;s school system, Cooper High School.

In 1966, the Abilene Zoo was established near Abilene Regional Airport. The following year, one of the most important bond elections in the city&#x27;s history passed for the funding of the construction of the Abilene Civic Center and the Taylor County Coliseum, as well as major improvements to Abilene Regional Airport. In 1969, the Woodson elementary and high school for black students closed as the city integrated its school system, more than 10 years after the US Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional.

In 1982, Abilene became the first city in Texas to create a downtown reinvestment zone. Texas State Technical College opened an Abilene branch three years later. The 2,250-bed French Robertson Prison Unit was built in 1989. A half-cent sales tax earmarked for economic development was created after the decline in the petroleum business in the 1980s. A branch of Cisco College was located in the city in 1990.

Several major projects of restoration and new construction: The Grace Museum and Paramount Theatre, and development of Artwalk in 1992, sparked a decade of downtown revitalization. In 2004, Frontier Texas!, a multimedia museum highlighting the history of the area from 1780 to 1880, was constructed. That year, an $8 million, Cisco Junior College campus was built at Loop 322 and Industrial Boulevard. Simultaneously, subdivisions and businesses started locating along the freeway, on the same side as the CJC campus. This area attracted Abilene growth on the loop.

Abilene has become the commercial, retail, medical, and transportation hub of a 19-county area more commonly known as &quot;The Big Country&quot;, but also known as the &quot;Texas Midwest&quot;. It is part of the Central Great Plains ecoregion. By the end of 2005, commercial and residential development had reached record levels in and around the city.

<doc id="151217" wikidata="Q49242" url="?curid=151217" title="Corpus Christi, Texas">
<text>Corpus Christi ( ; ) is a coastal city in the South Texas region of the U.S. state of Texas and the county seat and largest city of Nueces County with portions extending into Aransas, Kleberg, and San Patricio counties. It is southeast of San Antonio and southwest of Houston. Its political boundaries encompass Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi Bay. Its zoned boundaries include small land parcels or water inlets of three neighboring counties.

The city&#x27;s population was 316,239 in 2022, making it the eighth-most populous city in Texas. The Corpus Christi metropolitan area had an estimated population of 442,600. It is also the hub of the six-county Corpus Christi-Kingsville combined statistical area, with a 2013 estimated population of 516,793. The Port of Corpus Christi is the fifth-largest in the United States. The region is served by the Corpus Christi International Airport.

Corpus Christi is home to Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, one of two locations training primary student pilots and advanced multiengine pilots of the US Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.

==Etymology==
The city&#x27;s name means &quot;body of Christ&quot; in Ecclesiastical Latin, in reference to the Christian sacrament of Holy Communion. The name was given to the settlement and surrounding bay by Spanish explorer Alonso Álvarez de Pineda in 1519, as he discovered the lush semitropical bay on the Western Christian feast day of Corpus Christi.

==History==


Spaniard Alonso Alvarez de Pineda traveled in 1519 to this bay on the day of the religious Feast of Corpus Christi, so named the semitropical bay Corpus Christi.

Cabeza de Vaca may have passed through Corpus Christi in the 1500s, but the first European to study the Nueces River and Corpus Christi Bay was Joaquín de Orobio y Basterr in 1747. A few years later, José de Escandón organized a colony of about 50 families to settle the head of the bay, though this was short-lived.

In 1839, the first known permanent settlement of Corpus Christi was established by Colonel Henry Lawrence Kinney and William P. Aubrey as Kinney&#x27;s Trading Post, or Kinney&#x27;s Ranch. It was a small trading post that sold supplies to a Mexican revolutionary army camped about west.
In July 1845, U.S. troops commanded by General Zachary Taylor set up camp there in preparation for war with Mexico, where they remained until March 1846. About a year later, the settlement was named Corpus Christi and was incorporated on September 9, 1852.

The Battle of Corpus Christi was fought between August 12 and August 18, 1862, during the American Civil War. United States Navy forces blockading Texas fought a small land and sea engagement with Confederate forces in and around Corpus Christi Bay and bombarded the city. Union forces defeated Confederate States Navy ships operating in the area, but were repulsed when they landed on the coast.

In November 1873, seven Mexican shepherds were lynched by a mob near the city. The crime was never solved.
The Port of Corpus Christi was opened in 1926, and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station was commissioned in 1941.

In February 1929, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) was founded in Corpus Christi. This organization was created to battle racial discrimination against Hispanic people in the United States. Since its founding, LULAC has grown and now has a national headquarters in Washington, D.C.

In March 1949, the American GI Forum (AGIF) was founded in Corpus Christi. Currently, AGIF focuses on veteran&#x27;s issues, education, and civil-rights issues. This organization was founded after concerns over the segregation of Mexican-American veterans from other veterans groups and the denial of medical services based on race by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

The 1919 Storm devastated the city, killing hundreds on September 14. Only three structures survived the storm on North Beach. To protect the city, the seawall was built. The city also suffered damage from Hurricane Celia in 1970 and Hurricane Allen in 1980, but little damage from Hurricane Ike in 2008. In 2017, the city was affected by Hurricane Harvey, then by Hurricane Hanna in 2020. Rough surf from Hurricane Laura caused one death and one injury at a beach in the city in late August 2020, just a month after Hanna.

&quot;Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District&quot; (1970) was the first case to extend the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot; decision (1954) to Mexican Americans. It recognized them as a minority group that could be and was frequently discriminated against. Such segregation and discrimination were ruled unconstitutional. Judge Woodrow Seals found that the school board consciously fostered a system that perpetuated traditional segregation. This included a system that bused Anglo students to schools out of their neighborhoods, renovated old schools in black and Mexican-American neighborhoods rather than building new ones, assigned black and Hispanic teachers to segregated schools, and limited hiring of such teachers at other schools; the school board also lacked a majority-to-minority busing system.

In 2012, Corpus Christi was ranked as the second-least literate city in the U.S. in a study by Central Connecticut State University.

==Geography ==

Corpus Christi is situated on fluvial deposits that are of Holocene—Pleistocene age. Although no solidified rock occurs naturally at the surface, the Deweyville Formation of sand, silt, clay, and gravel, is locally indurated with calcium carbonate (caliche) deposits. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey&#x27;s storm surge eroded down to shale bedrock at a depth around 40 feet in Packery Channel, an artificial pass cut between North Padre and Mustang Islands. This feature has become a gathering place for game fish, and can be identified from the surface by its whirlpool-like current. The large, shallow bay makes Corpus Christi an ideal feeding place for birds, which is one reason why Corpus Christi is known as the &quot;Bird Capital&quot; of North America; consequently, the San Diego Audubon Society has designated Corpus Christi as &quot;America&#x27;s birdiest place&quot;.
According to the United States Census Bureau, Corpus Christi has a total area of 460.2 square miles (1,192.0 km2), of which 154.6 mi2 (400.5 km2, 33.60%) are land and 305.6 mi2 (791.5 km2, 66.40%) are covered by water.

===Annexation===
Since its founding, the city has annexed nearby lands and waters for growth and development purposes. The original area encompassed several city blocks in present-day downtown Corpus Christi with the majority of city expansion occurring in the 20th century.

The city&#x27;s location beside Corpus Christi Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and Laguna Madre provides opportunities for water sports and nature tourism. Waterfowl hunting is available in the region for duck, geese, coot, and teal. White-winged dove and mourning dove are also hunted on private leases. The brushland inland from Corpus Christi is also ideal for hunting feral hogs and white-tailed deer.

===Fishing===
Fishing is a popular recreational activity in Corpus Christi, including fishing from various piers around Corpus Christi Bay, wade fishing in Oso Bay, and fishing from the Gulf of Mexico at Packery Channel or at Bob Hall Pier.

===Wind sports===
The city has one of the highest average wind speeds of coastal cities in North America. This, combined with the Bay Front area located along Ocean Drive, makes the city an important destination for wind sports such as kite boarding, wind surfing, kite flying, wing foiling, and sailing. In 1990, Corpus Christi hosted the Windsurfing World Championships. In 2018, Corpus Christi hosted the 2018 Youth Sailing World Championships, and in 2022, the J/24 World Championship.

===Skating===
The Corpus Christi Skate Park opened on February 17, 2007. It is located in Cole Park on the shoreline of the Corpus Christi Bay near downtown. The concrete park includes a skating bowl and a street course with stairs, railings, and flat surfaces.

===Birdwatching===

Being a coastal city, Corpus Christi is a good spot for seabird watching. Popular spots include Blucher Park in downtown, the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge along Oso Bay, Hazel Bazemore County Park along the Nueces River in Calallen, and the South Texas Botanic Garden and Nature Center along the Oso Creek.

The Audubon Outdoor Club of Corpus Christi, founded in 1957, promotes birding culture and protects habitat for birds in the Coastal Bend region of Texas, with five sanctuaries owned or managed by the club within Corpus Christi. The club hosts field trips and public meetings monthly.

==Government==
===Municipal government===
In 1852, the City of Corpus Christi was incorporated. Texas&#x27; 31st Legislature chartered the city as a political and corporate municipal entity in 1909. By ordinance, the city possesses power to &quot;fix, alter and extend its boundaries.&quot;

Corpus Christi is under a council-manager municipal government. The elected city council is the primary authority in municipal matters such as enacting local legislation, determining policies, and appointing the city manager. Together, the city council and city manager execute laws and administer the municipal government. Organized by governmental sectors of city council, city management, city secretary, and several city departments, Corpus Christi is seated in Nueces County.

Peter Zanoni, former deputy city manager of San Antonio, was appointed city manager in May 2019. Upon appointment, Zanoni created two new positions in his leadership team and appointed Michael Rodriguez as his Chief of Staff and Constance Sanchez as Chief Financial Officer. The city manager works alongside Assistant City Manager Steven Viera. The city&#x27;s intergovernmental relations director is Tammy Embrey. Rebecca L. Huerta serves as the city secretary.

Former City Manager Margie C. Rose was appointed in 2016 and served as the first African-American city manager in Corpus Christi. Rose resigned in 2018. Selman served as interim city manager in 2018 following Rose&#x27;s resignation and until the appointment of Zanoni.

The Corpus Christi City Charter was adopted by public referendum in 1987, with amendments to the entire charter conducted January 19, 1991, and April 3, 1993. Further revisions to the charter were conducted on November 2, 2004, November 7, 2006, and November 8, 2016. The charter consists of 10 articles and 41 sections regarding stipulations of home rule government, city council and city manager procedures, administration, planning, boards and commissions, etc. The Code of Ordinances of Corpus Christi was codified through Ordinance No. 028493, and adopted Feb. 23, 2010.
From 2012 to 2016, Nelda Martinez was mayor of Corpus Christi, the first Hispanic woman to the hold the office.

On January 19, 2017, Corpus Christi Mayor Dan McQueen resigned from office after 37 days, an outgrowth of a comment by McQueen claiming that the city council members were only high school graduates and he was an engineer. He does not have an engineering degree and some college graduates are on the city council.

===State and federal representation===
The Texas 13th Court of Appeals is located in the Nueces County Courthouse in Corpus Christi.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Corpus Christi Parole Office in Corpus Christi.

The United States Postal Service operates the Corpus Christi Post Office, the city&#x27;s main post office, and several station post offices.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
Corpus Christi is home to several institutions of higher learning: Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, Del Mar College, Saint Leo University-Corpus Christi, and numerous vocational schools, including Southern Careers Institute, South Texas Vo-Tech, Career Centers of Texas-Corpus Christi, and Vogue Cosmetology School. The city is also home to Stark College and Seminary (formerly known as the South Texas School of Christian Studies), located on Ward Island alongside Texas A&amp;M-Corpus Christi.

Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi is a component of the Texas A&amp;M University System. It was formerly known as Corpus Christi State University, Texas A&amp;I University at Corpus Christi, and the University of Corpus Christi.

Saint Leo University-Corpus Christi Education Center is located at Corpus Christi&#x27;s Naval Air Station.

Del Mar College is a local community college designated for the entire Corpus Christi city limits. It began in the 1940s at a location behind Wynn Seale Jr. High School. The main campus began with the administration building, which was constructed after World War II on Del Mar. The college grew to encompass a good portion of a residential addition called Southmoreland built from the Bohemian farmlands in the late 1930s. Del Mar now includes a west campus located in the area of Corpus Christi that once was Cliff Maus Airport. Del Mar College is expanding their footprint with the unveiling of their new Southside Campus near Oso Creek. The new Southern branch campus will serve the recent growing Southside area.

Southern Careers Institute offers career training at two Corpus Christi locations, primarily in the medical, business, and cosmetology fields.

In 2015, WalletHub ranked Corpus Christi near the bottom, 138 out of 150 cities in America, for its low educational level and low-income opportunities. To improve literacy levels in the city, a multiyear effort has been made to promote reading through annual literacy festivals. Started by First Lady Laura Bush and the Texas Book Festival, a series of book festivals is held each spring.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Corpus Christi is served by Corpus Christi International Airport and Interstate 37. Interstate 69E/U.S. Highway 77 connects the city to Brownsville and Victoria. Texas State Highway 44 is a main thoroughfare that connects Corpus Christi to Laredo and the western part of South Texas by way of Interstate 69W/U.S. Highway 59, Interstate 35, and U.S. Highway 83. The inner-city public transportation is provided by Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority with its 28 bus routes. Corpus Christi had a streetcar system functioning from 1910 to 1931 and a railway station (passenger service ended in 1965). Despite the convenience of a large harbor, the city does not have a passenger port. 
The city of Corpus Christi has a lower than average percentage of households without a car. In 2015, 8.5% of Corpus Christi households lacked a car, which decreased to 7.9% in 2016. The national average was 8.7% in 2016. Corpus Christi averaged 1.77 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.

The city is accessed by two major bridges, the Harbor Bridge (US 181) and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway (PR 22). Both bridges are maintained by the Texas Department of Transportation.

===Water===
Drinking water for the city is supplied by three reservoirs, Lake Corpus Christi, the Choke Canyon Reservoir, and Lake Texana. Through an effective regional partnership with the Nueces River Authority and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, a pipeline was built which transports water from Lake Texana to the city&#x27;s O.N. Stevens Water Treatment Plant. It was named the Mary Rhodes Pipeline, after the late mayor. Phase two of the pipeline is underway to draw water from the Colorado River. All reservoirs are outside the city limits, but Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir are managed directly by the public utility of the City of Corpus Christi. To support future water needs, plans are being completed to build a desalinization plant.

<text>Normangee is a town in Leon and Madison counties in Texas, United States. Its population is 495 as of 2020.

==History==
The railroads were pushing the frontier westward and the Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway (T&amp;BV) and the Houston and Texas Central Railway (H&amp;TC) were built between Houston and Dallas in 1904–1905, but the railways passed through Robert Rogers&#x27; land, approximately two miles west of Rogers Prairie. So on January 26, 1907, S.B. Phillips filed for record a plat of the new town, Normangee, located in the southwestern corner of the Robert Rogers land grant at the junction of the Old San Antonio Road and the two new railroads. When the H&amp;TC was being built through this region, railroad officials placed a town every eight miles. A small community, known as Rogers Prairie, existed two miles east of where the railroad line was built. Norman G. Kittrell was the county judge of Leon County at the time. The railroad named the new town after Judge Kittrell. Since there was already a Norman, Oklahoma, the town renamed itself Normangee.

<text>Midland is a city in the U.S. state of Texas and the county seat of Midland County with small portions extending into Martin County. The population was 132,524 as of the 2020 census. Located in the Permian Basin in West Texas, Midland is a major center for American oil and natural gas production.

Midland is the principal city of the Midland, Texas metropolitan statistical area, which includes all of Midland County, the population of which was 169,983 in the 2020 U.S. Census. The metropolitan area is part of the larger Midland–Odessa combined statistical area, which had a population of 340,391 in the 2020 census. Residents of Midland are referred to as &#x27;Midlanders&#x27;.

Midland was founded as the midway point between Fort Worth and El Paso on the Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1881. The city has many connections to the Bush family; it was the onetime home of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush and the hometown of former First Lady Laura Bush. The Bush Family Home State Historic Site is located in Midland.

== History ==


Midland was established in June 1881 as Midway Station, on the Texas and Pacific Railway. Its name came from its central location between Fort Worth and El Paso, but because there were already other towns in Texas named Midway, the city changed its name to Midland in January 1884 when it was granted its first post office.

Midland became the county seat of Midland County in March 1885, when that county was first organized and separated from Tom Green County. By 1890, it had become one of the state&#x27;s most important cattle shipping centers. The city was incorporated in 1906, and by 1910 established its first fire department, along with a new water system.

Midland was changed significantly by the discovery of oil in the Permian Basin in 1923 when the Santa Rita No. 1 well began producing in Reagan County, followed shortly by the Yates Oil Field in Iraan. Midland became the West Texas oil fields&#x27; administrative center. During World War II, it had the nation&#x27;s largest bombardier training base. A second boom began after the war, with the discovery and development of the Spraberry Trend, still the country&#x27;s third-largest oil field by total reserves. Yet another boom period took place during the 1970s, with the high oil prices associated with the oil and energy crises. Today, the Permian Basin produces one fifth of the nation&#x27;s total petroleum and natural gas output.

Midland&#x27;s economy still relies heavily on petroleum, but the city has also become a regional telecommunications and distribution center. By August 2006, a busy period of crude oil production had caused a significant workforce deficit. According to the Midland Chamber of Commerce, at that time there were almost 2,000 more jobs available in the Permian Basin than there were workers to fill them.

In 1959, John Howard Griffin wrote a history of Midland, &quot;Land of the High Sky.&quot;

=== &quot;Avery v. Midland County&quot; ===
In 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case &quot;Avery v. Midland County&quot;. Midland mayor Hank Avery had sued Midland County, challenging the electoral-districting scheme in effect for elections to the County Commissioner&#x27;s Court. The county districts geographically quartered the county, but Midland, in the northwestern quarter, had 97% of the county&#x27;s population. A judge, elected on an at-large basis, provided a fifth vote, but the result was that the three rural commissioners, representing only 3% of the county&#x27;s population, held a majority of the votes.

The Court held that the scheme violated the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection clause. A dissenting minority held that this example of the Warren Court&#x27;s policy of incorporation at the local-government level exceeded its constitutional authority.

=== Cityscape ===


Nicknamed &quot;The Tall City&quot;, Midland has long been known for its downtown skyline. Most of downtown Midland&#x27;s major office buildings were built during a time of major Permian Basin oil and gas discoveries. The surge in energy prices in the mid-1980s sparked a building boom downtown. For many years, the 22-story Wilco Building in downtown was the tallest building between Fort Worth and Phoenix. Today, the tallest is the 24-story Bank of America Building, at . Four buildings over tall were planned in the 1980s, including one designed by architect I.M. Pei.

The great oil bust of the mid-1980s killed any plans for future skyscrapers. A private development group was planning to build Energy Tower at City Center, which was proposed to be 870 feet tall, with 59 floors (six floors underground and 53 above). If it had been built, it would have been Texas&#x27;s sixth-tallest building.

<doc id="151226" wikidata="Q249367" url="?curid=151226" title="Montgomery bus boycott">
<text>The Montgomery bus boycott was a political and social protest campaign against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system of Montgomery, Alabama. It was a foundational event in the civil rights movement in the United States. The campaign lasted from December 5, 1955—the Monday after Rosa Parks, an African-American woman, was arrested for her refusal to surrender her seat to a white person—to December 20, 1956, when the federal ruling &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; took effect, and led to a United States Supreme Court decision that declared the Alabama and Montgomery laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional.

==Background==

Before the bus boycott, Jim Crow laws mandated the racial segregation of the Montgomery Bus Line. As a result of this segregation, African Americans were not hired as drivers, were forced to ride in the back of the bus, and were frequently ordered to surrender their seats to white people even though black passengers made up 75% of the bus system&#x27;s riders. Many bus drivers treated their black passengers poorly beyond the law: African-Americans were assaulted, , and left stranded after paying their fares.

The year before the bus boycott began, the Supreme Court and Warren Court decided unanimously, in the case of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, that racial segregation in schools was unconstitutional. The reaction by the white population of the Deep South was &quot;noisy and stubborn&quot;. Discontented white southerners joined the White Citizens&#x27; Council as a result of the decision.

Although it is often framed as the start of the civil rights movement, the boycott occurred at the end of many black communities&#x27; struggles in the South to protect black women, such as Recy Taylor, from racial violence. The boycott also took place within a larger statewide and national movement for civil rights, including court cases such as &quot;Morgan v. Virginia&quot;, the earlier Baton Rouge bus boycott, and the arrest of Claudette Colvin, among others, for refusing to give up her seat on a Montgomery bus.

==History==
Under the system of segregation used on Montgomery buses, the ten front seats were reserved for white people at all times. The ten back seats were supposed to be reserved for black people at all times. The middle section of the bus consisted of sixteen unreserved seats for white and black people on a segregated basis. White people filled the middle seats from the front to back, and black people filled seats from the back to front until the bus was full. If other black people boarded the bus, they were required to stand. If another white person boarded the bus, then everyone in the black row nearest the front had to get up and stand so that a new row for white people could be created; it was illegal for white and black people to sit next to each other. When Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat for a white person, she was sitting in the first row of the middle section.

Often when boarding the buses, black people were required to pay at the front, get off, and reenter the bus through a separate door at the back. Occasionally, bus drivers would drive away before black passengers were able to reboard. National City Lines owned the Montgomery Bus Line at the time of the Montgomery bus boycott. Under the leadership of Walter Reuther, the United Auto Workers donated almost $5,000 () to the boycott&#x27;s organizing committee.

===Rosa Parks===
Rosa Parks (February 4, 1913 – October 24, 2005) was a seamstress by profession; she was also the secretary for the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP. Twelve years before her history-making arrest, Parks was stopped from boarding a city bus by driver James F. Blake, who ordered her to board at the rear door and then drove off without her. Parks vowed never again to ride a bus driven by Blake. As a member of the NAACP, Parks was an investigator assigned to cases of sexual assault. In 1945, she was sent to Abbeville, Alabama, to investigate the gang rape of Recy Taylor. The protest that arose around the Taylor case was the first instance of a nationwide civil rights protest, and it laid the groundwork for the Montgomery bus boycott.
In 1955, Parks completed a course in &quot;Race Relations&quot; at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where nonviolent civil disobedience had been discussed as a tactic. On December 1, 1955, Parks was sitting in the foremost row in which black people could sit (in the middle section). When a white man boarded the bus, the bus driver told everyone in her row to move back. At that moment, Parks realized that she was again on a bus driven by Blake. While all of the other black people in her row complied, Parks refused, and she was arrested for failing to obey the driver&#x27;s seat assignments, as city ordinances did not explicitly mandate segregation but did give the bus driver authority to assign seats. Found guilty on December 5, Parks was fined $10 plus a court cost of $4&quot;&quot; (combined total ), and she appealed. This movement also sparked riots leading up to the 1956 Sugar Bowl.

===E. D. Nixon===
Some action against segregation had been in the works for some time before Parks&#x27; arrest, under the leadership of E. D. Nixon, president of the local NAACP chapter and a member of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. Nixon intended that her arrest be a test case to allow Montgomery&#x27;s black citizens to challenge segregation on the city&#x27;s public buses. With this goal, community leaders had been waiting for the right person to be arrested, a person who would anger the black community into action, who would agree to test the segregation laws in court, and who, most importantly, was &quot;above reproach&quot;. When Colvin was arrested in March 1955, Nixon thought he had found the perfect person, but the teenager turned out to be pregnant. Nixon later explained, &quot;I had to be sure that I had somebody I could win with.&quot; Parks was a good candidate because of her employment and marital status, along with her good standing in the community.

Between Parks&#x27; arrest and trial, Nixon organized a meeting of local ministers at Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s church. Though Nixon could not attend the meeting because of his work schedule, he arranged that no election of a leader for the proposed boycott would take place until his return. When he returned, he caucused with Ralph Abernathy and Rev. E.N. French to name the association to lead the boycott to the city (they selected the &quot;Montgomery Improvement Association&quot;, &quot;MIA&quot;), and they selected King (Nixon&#x27;s choice) to lead the boycott. Nixon wanted King to lead the boycott because the young minister was new to Montgomery and the city fathers had not had time to intimidate him. At a subsequent, larger meeting of ministers, Nixon&#x27;s agenda was threatened by the clergymen&#x27;s reluctance to support the campaign. Nixon was indignant, pointing out that their poor congregations worked to put money into the collection plates so these ministers could live well, and when those congregations needed the clergy to stand up for them, those comfortable ministers refused to do so. Nixon threatened to reveal the ministers&#x27; cowardice to the black community, and King spoke up, denying he was afraid to support the boycott. King agreed to lead the MIA, and Nixon was elected its treasurer.

===Boycott===

On the night of Parks&#x27; arrest, the Women&#x27;s Political Council, led by Jo Ann Robinson, printed and circulated a flyer throughout Montgomery&#x27;s black community that read as follows:

Another woman has been arrested and thrown in jail because she refused to get up out of her seat on the bus for a white person to sit down. It is the second time since the Claudette Colvin case that a Negro woman has been arrested for the same thing. This has to be stopped. Negroes have rights too, for if Negroes did not ride the buses, they could not operate. Three-fourths of the riders are Negro, yet we are arrested, or have to stand over empty seats. If we do not do something to stop these arrests, they will continue. The next time it may be you, or your daughter, or mother. This woman&#x27;s case will come up on Monday. We are, therefore, asking every Negro to stay off the buses Monday in protest of the arrest and trial. Don&#x27;t ride the buses to work, to town, to school, or anywhere on Monday. You can afford to stay out of school for one day if you have no other way to go except by bus. You can also afford to stay out of town for one day. If you work, take a cab, or walk. But please, children and grown-ups, don&#x27;t ride the bus at all on Monday. Please stay off all buses Monday.

The next morning there was a meeting led by the new Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) head, King, where a group of 16 to 18 people gathered at the Mt. Zion Church to discuss boycott strategies. At that time Rosa Parks was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; she asked someone if she should say something, but they replied, &quot;Why, you&#x27;ve said enough.&quot; A citywide boycott of public transit was proposed, with three demands: 1) courteous treatment by bus operators, 2) passengers seated on a first-come, first-served basis, with black people seated in the back half and white people seated in the front half, and 3) black people would be employed as bus operators on routes predominately taken by black people.

This demand was a compromise for the leaders of the boycott, who believed that the city of Montgomery would be more likely to accept it rather than a demand for full integration of the buses. In this respect, the MIA leaders followed the pattern of 1950s boycott campaigns in the Deep South, including the successful boycott a few years earlier of service stations in Mississippi for refusing to provide restrooms for Black people. The organizer of that campaign, T. R. M. Howard of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership, had spoken on the lynching of Emmett Till as King&#x27;s guest at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church only four days before Parks&#x27;s arrest. Parks was in the audience and later said that Emmett Till was on her mind when she refused to give up her seat.

The MIA&#x27;s demand for a fixed dividing line was to be supplemented by a requirement that all bus passengers receive courteous treatment by bus operators, be seated on a first-come, first-served basis, and that Black people be employed as bus drivers. The proposal was passed, and the boycott was to commence the following Monday. To publicize the impending boycott it was advertised at black churches throughout Montgomery the following Sunday.

On Saturday, December 3, it was evident that the black community would support the boycott, and very few Black people rode the buses that day. On December 5, a mass meeting was held at the Holt Street Baptist Church to determine if the protest would continue. Given twenty minutes notice, King gave a speech asking for a bus boycott and attendees enthusiastically agreed. Starting December 7, J Edgar Hoover&#x27;s FBI noted the &quot;agitation among negroes&quot; and tried to find &quot;derogatory information&quot; about King.

The boycott proved extremely effective, with enough riders lost to the city transit system to cause serious economic distress. Martin Luther King later wrote, &quot;[a] miracle had taken place.&quot; Instead of riding buses, boycotters organized a system of carpools, with car owners volunteering their vehicles or themselves driving people to various destinations. Some white housewives also drove their black domestic servants to work. When the city pressured local insurance companies to stop insuring cars used in the carpools, the boycott leaders arranged policies at Lloyd&#x27;s of London.

Black taxi drivers charged ten cents per ride, a fare equal to the cost to ride the bus, in support of the boycott. When word of this reached city officials on December 8, the order went out to fine any cab driver who charged a rider less than 45 cents. In addition to using private motor vehicles, some people used non-motorized means to get around, such as cycling, walking, or even riding mules or driving horse-drawn buggies. Some people also hitchhiked. During rush hours, sidewalks were often crowded. As the buses received few, if any, passengers, their officials asked the City Commission to allow stopping service to black communities. Across the nation, black churches raised money to support the boycott and collected new and slightly used shoes to replace the tattered footwear of Montgomery&#x27;s black citizens, many of whom walked everywhere rather than ride the buses and submit to Jim Crow laws.

In response, opposing whites swelled the ranks of the White Citizens&#x27; Council, the membership of which doubled during the course of the boycott. The councils sometimes resorted to violence: King&#x27;s and Abernathy&#x27;s houses were firebombed, as were four black Baptist churches. Boycotters were often physically attacked. After the attack at King&#x27;s house, he gave a speech to the 300 angry African Americans who had gathered outside. He said:

King and 88 other boycott leaders and carpool drivers were indicted for conspiring to interfere with a business under a 1921 ordinance. Rather than wait to be arrested, they turned themselves in as an act of defiance.

King was ordered to pay a $500 fine or serve 386 days in jail. He ended up spending two weeks in jail. The move backfired by bringing national attention to the protest. King commented on the arrest by saying: &quot;I was proud of my crime. It was the crime of joining my people in a nonviolent protest against injustice.&quot;

Also important during the bus boycott were grassroots activist groups that helped to catalyze both fund-raising and morale. Groups such as the Club from Nowhere helped to sustain the boycott by finding new ways of raising money and offering support to boycott participants. Many members of these organizations were women and their contributions to the effort have been described by some as essential to the success of the bus boycott.

===Victory===

Pressure increased across the country. The related civil suit was heard in federal district court and, on June 5, 1956, the court ruled in &quot;Browder v. Gayle&quot; (1956) that Alabama&#x27;s racial segregation laws for buses were unconstitutional. As the state appealed the decision, the boycott continued. The case moved on to the United States Supreme Court. On November 13, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the district court&#x27;s ruling.

The bus boycott officially ended on December 20, 1956, after 382 days. The Montgomery bus boycott resounded far beyond the desegregation of public buses. It stimulated activism and participation from the South in the national Civil Rights Movement and gave King national attention as a rising leader.

== Aftermath ==
White backlash against the court victory was quick, brutal, and, in the short term, effective. Two days after the inauguration of desegregated seating, someone fired a shotgun through the front door of Martin Luther King&#x27;s home. A day later, on Christmas Eve, white men attacked a black teenager as she exited a bus. Four days after that, two buses were fired upon by snipers. In one sniper incident, a pregnant woman was shot in both legs. On January 10, 1957, bombs destroyed five black churches and the home of Reverend Robert S. Graetz, one of the few white Montgomerians who had publicly sided with the MIA.

The city suspended bus service for several weeks on account of the violence. According to legal historian Randall Kennedy, &quot;When the violence subsided and service was restored, many black Montgomerians enjoyed their newly recognized right only abstractly ... In practically every other setting, Montgomery remained overwhelmingly segregated ...&quot; On January 23, a group of Klansmen (who would later be charged for the bombings) lynched a black man, Willie Edwards, on the pretext that he was dating a white woman.

The city&#x27;s elite moved to strengthen segregation in other areas, and in March 1957 passed an ordinance making it &quot;unlawful for white and colored persons to play together, or, in company with each other ... in any game of cards, dice, dominoes, checkers, pool, billiards, softball, basketball, baseball, football, golf, track, and at swimming pools, beaches, lakes or ponds or any other game or games or athletic contests, either indoors or outdoors.&quot;

Later in the year, Montgomery police charged seven Klansmen with the bombings, but all of the defendants were acquitted. About the same time, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled against Martin Luther King&#x27;s appeal of his &quot;illegal boycott&quot; conviction. Rosa Parks left Montgomery due to death threats and employment blacklisting. According to Charles Silberman, &quot;by 1963, most Negroes in Montgomery had returned to the old custom of riding in the back of the bus.&quot;

The National Memorial for Peace and Justice contains, among other things, a sculpture &quot;dedicated to the women who sustained the Montgomery Bus Boycott&quot;, by Dana King, to help illustrate the civil rights period. The memorial opened in downtown Montgomery, Alabama on April 26, 2018.

<text>San Patricio is a city in San Patricio County in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 384 at the 2020 census.

In the 2000 U.S. Census, a portion of San Patricio was indicated as being in Nueces County. As of the 1990 U.S. Census, the 2010 U.S. Census, and the 2020 U.S. Census, that particular area is indicated as being in San Patricio County.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, San Patricio, located at (27.959196, -97.773134), has a total area of 3.9 square miles (10.0 km), of which 3.8 square miles (9.9 km) is land and 0.04 square mile (0.1 km) (1.03%) is water.

==History==
The town was founded in 1829 by empresarios James McGloin and John McMullen. They had received approval from the Mexican government to settle 200 Irish Catholic families on the land—the name meaning Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. Empresario James Power was involved as well.

The Battle of San Patricio was fought near the town in 1836 during the Texas Revolution.

With the approval of the General Council, Texas revolutionaries James Grant, Frank W. Johnson and Robert C. Morris collaborated on plans to lead an assault on the Mexican town of Matamoros. Recruiting some 300 men, several of whom were native to San Antonio, they gathered provisions from the Alamo and Presidio La Bahia for their expedition. The men needed mounts for their long journey and divided into groups as they traveled toward the coast to capture wild horses.

On February 27, 1836, Mexican General José de Urrea&#x27;s advanced reconnaissance patrol discovered Frank W. Johnson and about 34 Texians camped at the abandoned Irish settlement of San Patricio. In a surprise attack at 3:30am, Mexican troops fired on the Texian Army and killed about 10 (7 of them Hispanics) and captured 18. Johnson and four others who were captured managed to escape and rejoin James Fannin&#x27;s command at Goliad. One man, Daniel J. Toler, escaped capture. The men killed were buried in the Old Cemetery on the Hill in San Patricio.

Grant and Morris&#x27;s party was also surprised by Urrea&#x27;s army as they camped at Agua Dulce Creek. On March 2, the Mexicans surprised them, killing both Grant and Morris and twelve others. The survivors were taken captured and imprisoned at Matamoros.

In 1846, San Patricio became the second county seat of San Patricio County after Nueces County was partitioned from San Patricio County. In 1893, the county seat was moved to Sinton.

<text>Mineral Wells is a city in Palo Pinto and Parker Counties in the U.S. state of Texas. The population was 14,820 at the 2020 census. The city is named for mineral wells in the area, which were highly popular in the early 1900s.

==History==

In 1919, Mineral Wells hosted the spring training camp for the Chicago White Sox, the year of the famous &quot;Black Sox&quot; scandal involving &quot;Shoeless&quot; Joe Jackson. Mineral Wells also hosted spring training for the Cincinnati Reds and St. Louis Cardinals in the 1910s and early 1920s. The baseball field was located in the center of town.

==Military History==

Mineral Wells military history dates back to 1864 with the organization of Company 1, 4th Texas Infantry. By January 1925, the War Department approved the site that would become Camp Wolters, the training ground for the 56th Cavalry Brigade of the Texas National Guard.

In 1956, the base began operations as the Primary Helicopter Center of the United States Army that would provide basic training and primary flight training for all rotary-wing aviators. The Vietnam War created an increased need for pilots. To meet the demand, Fort Wolters increased operations to become the training site for helicopter pilots for the Marine Corp in 1968 and the Air Force in 1970. Nearly every helicopter pilot that flew in Vietnam was trained at Fort Wolters.

Fort Wolters was deactivated in 1973. The 8,500 acres was then parsed out to the city of Mineral Wells, private businessmen, Weatherford College, and Lake Mineral Wells State Park.

==State Park==
Mineral Wells is very well known for the state park which features fishing, camping, horse riding, biking, hiking trails and rock climbing. One attraction is Penitentiary Hollow, a popular rock climbing area.

==Geography==
Mineral Wells lies east of the Brazos River and Palo Pinto Mountains.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 21.2 square miles (54.9 km), of which 20.5 square miles (53.0 km) are land and 0.7 square mile (1.9 km) (3.45%) is covered by water.

Mineral Wells is west of Fort Worth and east of Abilene.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. The Köppen climate classification describes the weather as humid subtropical, and uses the code &quot;Cfa&quot;.

==Demographics==

According to the 2020 United States census, the city had a population of 14,820 individuals, residing in 4,958 households, and belonging to 3,329 families. This represents a decrease of 12.54% compared to the figures reported in the 2000 Census.

==Government==

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates the Mineral Wells District Parole Office in Mineral Wells. The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) operated the Mineral Wells Pre-Parole Transfer Facility in the Fort Wolters Industrial Park on behalf of the TDCJ. It closed in August 2013. The correctional facility, which had been operated by CCA since 1995, is located on the property of the former Fort Wolters in Palo Pinto County and in Mineral Wells. It can house up to 2,100 prisoners. As of March 2013, its annual payroll was $11.7 million, and it was among the largest employers in Mineral Wells, with about 300 employees. On Monday March 4, 2013, the Texas Senate Senate Finance Committee voted 11–4 to close the correctional facility. Mike Allen, the mayor of Mineral Wells, criticized the closure, saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll lose right at over 300 jobs, and 300 jobs in a community of 17,000 ... is devastating. This means a lot to this community.&quot; John Whitmire, the head of the Texas Senate Criminal Justice Committee, said, &quot;We&#x27;re sitting on about 12,000 empty [prison] beds, so it just makes good business sense ... that we not operate it, and we take those savings and plow them back into additional public-safety programs.&quot;

The United States Postal Service operates the Mineral Wells Post Office. Zip codes are 76067 and 76068.

==Education==
Mineral Wells is served by the Mineral Wells Independent School District, and by the Community Christian School.

Weatherford College operates a branch campus on the old Fort Wolters facility.

<doc id="151230" wikidata="Q793929" url="?curid=151230" title="Azle, Texas">
<text>Azle ( ) is a city west of Fort Worth in Parker and Tarrant Counties in the U.S. state of Texas. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 13,369.

Azle is the home of the Azle Marching Green Pride marching band and the Fighting Azle Hornets.

==History==

The first recorded settlement at the site occurred in 1846, when James Azle Steward, a young doctor, moved into a log cabin built by a Dutchman named Rumsfeldt. Other settlers came and established themselves near the local streams, Ash Creek, Silver Creek, and Walnut Creek. Steward helped establish the first cemetery, Ash Creek. The oldest graves there are those of Dave Morrison (1849–1874) and W. P. Gregg (1833–1874). The first post office opened in 1881, and the town took the name of O&#x27;Bar, in honor of the man who obtained the postal service. A short time later in 1883, the name was changed to Azle at the request of Steward, who donated the land for a townsite. The community&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture. Several crops were grown, including wheat, corn, peanuts, sorghum, and cotton. Watermelons, cantaloupes, peaches, plums, and pears were also produced. Dairy farming became important in the early decades of the 20th century, when local milk products were sold to creameries in Fort Worth. Azle&#x27;s population grew steadily, and by 1920, the census recorded 150 residents. By 1933, State Highway 34 (later State Highway 199) had reached Azle from Fort Worth, greatly improving transportation between the town and the city. Also, Eagle Mountain Lake was formed by a dam on the Trinity River, east of Azle.

In the late 1930s, electricity was supplied to Azle and the surrounding countryside. The population grew between 1940 and 1960 from 800 to 2,696. It was 5,822 by 1980. After the 1930s, agriculture gradually declined; fields were converted from wheat and corn production to housing developments. Manufacturing increased, and in 1984, Azle had 26 businesses. In 1985, the population was estimated at more than 7,000. In 1990, the population was 8,868. It grew to 9,600 by 2000.
