<text>Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American singer, guitarist and songwriter. He was one of the main figures of the outlaw country subgenre that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. The critical success of his album &quot;Shotgun Willie&quot; (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot; (1975) and &quot;Stardust&quot; (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana.

Nelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended Baylor University for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a disc jockey at radio stations in his native Texas, and at several radio stations in the Pacific Northwest, all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot;, &quot;Hello Walls&quot;, &quot;Pretty Paper&quot;, and &quot;Crazy&quot;. In 1960 he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join Ray Price&#x27;s band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, &quot;...And Then I Wrote&quot;. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with RCA Victor and joined the Grand Ole Opry the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to Austin, Texas. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the Armadillo World Headquarters.

In 1973, after signing with Atlantic Records, Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as &quot;Shotgun Willie&quot; and &quot;Phases and Stages&quot;. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot;, along with Waylon Jennings, Jessi Colter, and Tompall Glaser. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot; and recording hit songs like &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, &quot;To All the Girls I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;, and &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;, he joined the country supergroup The Highwaymen, along with fellow singers Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson. In 1985, he helped organize the first Farm Aid concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.

In 1990, Nelson&#x27;s assets were seized by the Internal Revenue Service, which claimed that he owed $32million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released &quot;The IRS Tapes: Who&#x27;ll Buy My Memories?&quot;; the profits of the double album—destined to the IRS—and the auction of Nelson&#x27;s assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.

Nelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;, followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major liberal activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the biodiesel brand Willie Nelson Biodiesel, whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.

==Early life and education==
Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas, on April 29, 1933, the son of Ira Doyle Nelson and Myrle Marie (&quot;née&quot; Greenhaw). His birthday was incorrectly recorded by Dr. F. D. Sims as April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. Nelson traces his genealogy to the American Revolutionary War, in which his ancestor John Nelson served as a major. His parents moved to Texas from Arkansas in 1929 to look for work. His grandfather, William, worked as a blacksmith, while his father worked as a mechanic. His mother left soon after he was born, and his father remarried and also moved away, leaving Nelson and his sister Bobbie to be raised by their grandparents, who taught singing back in Arkansas and started their grandchildren in music. Nelson&#x27;s grandfather bought him a guitar when he was six, and taught him a few chords, and Nelson sang gospel songs in the local church alongside Bobbie. He wrote his first song at age seven, and when he was nine, he played guitar for local band Bohemian Polka. During the summer, the family picked cotton alongside other Abbott residents. Nelson disliked picking cotton, so he earned money by singing in dance halls, taverns, and honky tonks from age 13, which he continued through high school. His musical influences were Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Bob Wills, Lefty Frizzell, Ray Price, Ernest Tubb, Hank Snow, Django Reinhardt, Frank Sinatra, and Louis Armstrong.

Nelson attended Abbott High School, where he was a halfback on the football team, guard on the basketball team, and shortstop in baseball. He also raised pigs with the Future Farmers of America. While still at school, he sang and played guitar in The Texans, a band formed by his sister&#x27;s husband, Bud Fletcher. The band played in honky-tonks, and also had a Sunday morning spot at KHBR in Hillsboro, Texas. Meanwhile, Nelson had a short stint as a relief phone operator in Abbott, followed by a job as a tree trimmer for the local electric company, as well as a pawn shop employee. After leaving school in 1950, he joined the U.S. Air Force; he served for eight months before being medically discharged because of issues with his back. Upon his return, he married Martha Matthews in 1952, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at Baylor University, where he joined the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, until dropping out to pursue a career in music. He worked as a nightclub bouncer, autohouse partsman, saddle maker, and tree trimmer again. He later joined Johnny Bush&#x27;s band.

Nelson moved with his family to Pleasanton, Texas, where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at KBOP. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio. With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: &quot;The Storm Has Just Begun&quot; and &quot;When I&#x27;ve Sung My Last Hillbilly Song&quot;. He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them. He then had stints working for KDNT in Denton, KCUL, and KCNC in Fort Worth, where he hosted &quot;The Western Express&quot;, taught Sunday school, and played in nightclubs. He then decided to move to San Diego but, when he was unable to find a job there, he hitchhiked to Portland, Oregon, where his mother lived. When nobody picked him up, he ended up sleeping in a ditch before hopping a freight train bound for Eugene. A truck driver drove him to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach Portland.

==Music career==
===Beginnings (1956–1971)===
Nelson was hired by KVAN in Vancouver, Washington, and appeared frequently on a television show. He made his first record in 1956, &quot;No Place for Me&quot;, that included Leon Payne&#x27;s &quot;Lumberjack&quot; on the B-side. The recording failed. Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs.
He made several appearances in a Colorado nightclub, later moving to Springfield, Missouri. After failing to land a spot on the &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot;, he started to work as a dishwasher. Unhappy with his job, he moved back to Texas. After a short time in Waco, he settled in Fort Worth, and quit the music business for a year. He sold Bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door, and eventually became a sales manager for the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;.

After his son Billy was born in 1958, the family moved to Houston, Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the Esquire Ballroom to sell his original songs to house band singer Larry Butler. Butler refused to purchase the song &quot;Mr. Record Man&quot; for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club. Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in Pasadena, Texas, where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey. During this time, he recorded two singles for Pappy Daily on D Records &quot;Man With the Blues&quot;/&quot;The Storm Has Just Begun&quot; and &quot;What a Way to Live&quot;/&quot;Misery Mansion&quot;. Nelson then was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to work as an instructor in his school. He sold &quot;Family Bible&quot; to Buskirk for $50 and &quot;Night Life&quot; for $150. &quot;Family Bible&quot; turned into a hit for Claude Gray in 1960.

Nelson moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1960, but was unable to find a label to sign him. During this period he often spent time at Tootsie&#x27;s Orchid Lounge, a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show&#x27;s stars and other singers and songwriters. There Nelson met Hank Cochran, a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with Buddy Emmons and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing &quot;Hello Walls&quot; at Tootsie&#x27;s, Faron Young decided to record it. After Ray Price recorded Nelson&#x27;s &quot;Night Life&quot;, and his previous bassist Johnny Paycheck quit, Nelson joined Price&#x27;s touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the Cherokee Cowboys, his songs became hits for other artists, including &quot;Funny How Time Slips Away&quot; (Billy Walker), &quot;Pretty Paper&quot; (Roy Orbison), and, most famously, &quot;Crazy&quot; by Patsy Cline. Nelson and Cochran also met Cline&#x27;s husband, Charlie Dick at Tootsie&#x27;s. Dick liked a song of Nelson&#x27;s he heard on the bar&#x27;s jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of &quot;Crazy&quot;. Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it. &quot;Crazy&quot; became the biggest jukebox hit of all time.
Nelson signed with Liberty Records and was recording by August 1961 at the Bradley Studios in Nashville. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including &quot;Willingly&quot; (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, Shirley Collie, which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No. 10) and &quot;Touch Me&quot; (his second Top Ten, stalling at No. 7). Nelson&#x27;s tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled &quot;...And Then I Wrote&quot;, released in September 1962. In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in Las Vegas. He then worked on the west coast offices of Pamper Records, in Pico Rivera, California. Since the job did not allow him the time to play music of his own, he left it and bought a ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, outside of Nashville. Fred Foster of Monument Records signed Nelson in early 1964, but only one single was released: &quot;I Never Cared For You&quot;.

By the fall of 1964, Nelson had moved to RCA Victor at the behest of Chet Atkins, signing a contract for $10,000 per year. &quot;Country Willie – His Own Songs&quot; became Nelson&#x27;s first RCA Victor album, recorded in April 1965. That same year he joined the Grand Ole Opry, and he met and became friends with Waylon Jennings after watching one of his shows in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1967, he formed his backing band &quot;The Record Men&quot;, featuring Johnny Bush, Jimmy Day, Paul English and David Zettner. During his first few years on RCA Victor, Nelson had no significant hits, but from November 1966 through March 1969, his singles reached the Top 25 in a consistent manner. &quot;One in a Row&quot; (#19, 1966), &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (#24 during a 16-week chart run in 1967), and his cover of Morecambe &amp; Wise&#x27;s &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot; (#13, March 1969) were Nelson&#x27;s best-selling records during his time with RCA.

By 1970, most of Nelson&#x27;s songwriting royalties were invested in tours that did not produce significant profits. In addition to the problems in his career, Nelson divorced Shirley Collie in 1970. In December, his ranch in Ridgetop, Tennessee, burned down. He interpreted the incident as a signal for a change. He moved to a ranch near Bandera, Texas, and married Connie Koepke. In early 1971 his single &quot;I&#x27;m a Memory&quot; reached the top 30. After he recorded his final RCA single, &quot;Mountain Dew&quot; (backed with &quot;Phases, Stages, Circles, Cycles and Scenes&quot;), in late April 1972, RCA requested that Nelson renew his contract ahead of schedule, with the implication that RCA would not release his latest recordings if he did not. Due to the failure of his albums, and particularly frustrated by the reception of &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s Wine&quot;, although his contract was not over, Nelson decided to retire from music.

===Outlaw country and success (1972–1989)===
Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the burgeoning hippie music scene (see Armadillo World Headquarters) rejuvenated the singer. His popularity in Austin soared as he played his own brand of country music marked by country, folk and jazz influences. In March, he performed on the final day of the &quot;Dripping Springs Reunion&quot;, a three-day country music festival aimed by its producers to be an annual event. Despite the failure to reach the expected attendance, the concept of the festival inspired Nelson to create the &quot;Fourth of July Picnic&quot;, his own annual event, starting the following year.

Nelson decided to return to the recording business; he signed Neil Reshen as his manager to negotiate with RCA, who got the label to agree to end his contract upon repayment of $14,000. Reshen eventually signed Nelson to Atlantic Records for $25,000 per year, where he became the label&#x27;s first country artist. He formed his backing band, &quot;The Family&quot;, and, by February 1973, he was recording his acclaimed &quot;Shotgun Willie&quot; at Atlantic Studios in New York City.
&quot;Shotgun Willie&quot;, released in May 1973, earned excellent reviews but did not sell well. The album led Nelson to a new style, later stating that &quot;Shotgun Willie&quot; had &quot;cleared his throat&quot;. His next release, &quot;Phases and Stages&quot;, released in 1974, was a concept album about a couple&#x27;s divorce, inspired by his own experience. Side one of the record is from the viewpoint of the woman, and side two is from the viewpoint of the man. The album included the hit single &quot;Bloody Mary Morning&quot;. The same year, he produced and starred in the pilot episode of PBS&#x27; &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;.

Nelson then moved to Columbia Records, where he signed a contract that gave him complete creative control, made possible by the critical and commercial success of his previous albums. The result was the critically acclaimed and massively popular 1975 concept album &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. Although Columbia was reluctant to release an album with primarily a guitar and piano for accompaniment, Nelson and Waylon Jennings insisted. The album included a cover of Fred Rose&#x27;s 1945 song &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot;, that had been released as a single previous to the album, and became Nelson&#x27;s first number one hit as a singer. Throughout his 1975 tour, Nelson raised funds for PBS-affiliated stations across the south promoting &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;. The pilot was aired first on those stations, later being released nationwide. The positive reception of the show prompted PBS to order ten episodes for 1976, formally launching the show.

As Jennings was also achieving success in country music in the early 1970s, the pair were combined into a genre called outlaw country, since it did not conform to Nashville standards. The album &quot;Wanted! The Outlaws&quot; in 1976 with Jessi Colter and Tompall Glaser cemented the pair&#x27;s outlaw image and became country music&#x27;s first platinum album. Later that year Nelson released &quot;The Sound in Your Mind&quot; (certified gold in 1978 and platinum in 2001) and his first gospel album &quot;Troublemaker&quot; (certified gold in 1986).

In the summer of 1977, Nelson discovered that Reshen had been filing tax extensions and not paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since he took over as his manager. In June, a package containing cocaine was sent from Reshen&#x27;s office in New York to Jennings in Nashville. The package was followed by the DEA, and Jennings was arrested. The charges were later dropped, since Reshen&#x27;s assistant, Mark Rothbaum, stepped in and took the charges. Rothbaum was sentenced to serve time in jail. Impressed by his attitude, Nelson fired Reshen and hired Rothbaum as his manager. In 1978, Nelson released two more platinum albums. One, &quot;Waylon &amp; Willie&quot;, was a collaboration with Jennings that included &quot;Mammas Don&#x27;t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys&quot;, a hit single written and performed by Ed Bruce. Though observers predicted that &quot;Stardust&quot; would ruin his career, it went platinum the same year. Nelson continued to top the charts with hit songs during the late 1970s, including &quot;Good Hearted Woman&quot;, &quot;Remember Me&quot;, &quot;If You&#x27;ve Got the Money I&#x27;ve Got the Time&quot;, and &quot;Uncloudy Day&quot;.
During the 1980s, Nelson recorded a series of hit singles including &quot;Midnight Rider&quot;, a 1980 cover of the Allman Brothers song which Nelson recorded for &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;, the soundtrack &quot;On the Road Again&quot; from the movie &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, and a duet with Julio Iglesias titled &quot;To All the Girls I&#x27;ve Loved Before&quot;.
In 1982, &quot;Pancho &amp; Lefty&quot;, a duet album with Merle Haggard produced by Chips Moman, was released. During the recording sessions of &quot;Pancho and Lefty&quot;, Johnny Christopher, a session guitarist and the co-writer of &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;, tried to pitch the song to an uninterested Haggard. Nelson, who was unaware of Elvis Presley&#x27;s version of the song, asked him to record it. Produced by Moman, the single of the song was released, as well as the album &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;. The single topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Country Singles, while it reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The release won three awards during the 25th Annual Grammy Awards: Song of the Year, Best Country Song and Best Male Country Vocal Performance. The single was certified platinum, while the album was certified quadruple-platinum and later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008.

Meanwhile, two collaborations with Waylon Jennings were released: &quot;WWII&quot; in 1982, and &quot;Take it to the Limit&quot; in 1983. In the mid-1980s, Nelson, Jennings, Kristofferson, and Johnny Cash formed The Highwaymen, a supergroup who achieved platinum record sales and toured the world. Meanwhile, Nelson became more involved with charity work, such as singing on &quot;We are the World&quot; in 1984. In 1985, Nelson had another success with &quot;Half Nelson&quot;, a compilation album of duets with a range of artists such as Ray Charles and Neil Young. In 1980, Nelson performed on the south lawn of the White House. The concert of September 13 featured First Lady Rosalynn Carter and Nelson in a duet of Ray Wylie Hubbard&#x27;s &quot;Up Against the Wall Redneck Mother&quot;. Nelson frequently visited the White House, where, according to the biography by Joe Nick Patoski, &quot;Willie Nelson: An Epic Life&quot;, he smoked marijuana on the White House roof.

=== Later career (1990s–2000s) ===
In 1996, Nelson re-recorded the tracks &quot;Hello Walls&quot; with the band the Reverend Horton Heat, and &quot;Bloody Mary Morning&quot; with the Supersuckers, for 

&quot;Twisted Willie&quot;, a tribute album featuring rock versions of Nelson&#x27;s songs performed by artists such as Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, Jerry Cantrell, Mark Lanegan, L7, the Presidents of the United States of America, and Jello Biafra, among others. Proceeds from the sale of the record went to Nelson&#x27;s Farm Aid.

During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson toured continuously, recording several albums including 1998&#x27;s critically acclaimed &quot;Teatro&quot;, and performed and recorded with other acts including Phish, Johnny Cash, and Toby Keith. His duet with Keith, &quot;Beer for My Horses&quot;, was released as a single and topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts for six consecutive weeks in 2003, while the accompanying video won an award for &quot;Best Video&quot; at the 2004 Academy of Country Music Awards. A USA Network television special celebrated Nelson&#x27;s 70th birthday, and Nelson released &quot;The Essential Willie Nelson&quot; as part of the celebration. Nelson also appeared on Ringo Starr&#x27;s 2003 album, &quot;Ringo Rama&quot;, as a guest vocal on &quot;Write One for Me&quot;.

Nelson was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani, and Keith Richards. In the following year of 2005, Nelson released a reggae album entitled &quot;Countryman&quot; which featured Toots Hibbert of Toots and the Maytals on the song &quot;I&#x27;m a Worried Man&quot;.

Nelson headlined the 2005 Tsunami Relief Austin to Asia concert to benefit the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which raised an estimated $75,000 for UNICEF. Also in 2005, a live performance of the Johnny Cash song &quot;Busted&quot; with Ray Charles was released on Charles&#x27; duets album &quot;Genius &amp; Friends&quot;. Nelson&#x27;s 2007 performance with jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis at the Lincoln Center, was released as the live album &quot;Two Men with the Blues&quot; in 2008; reaching number one in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Jazz Albums and number twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The same year, Nelson recorded his first album with Buddy Cannon as the producer, &quot;Moment of Forever&quot;. Cannon acquainted Nelson earlier, during the production of his collaboration with Kenny Chesney on the duet &quot;That Lucky Old Sun&quot;, for Chesney&#x27;s album &quot;Lucky Old Sun&quot;. In 2009 Nelson and Marsalis joined with Norah Jones in a tribute concert to Ray Charles, which resulted in the &quot;Here We Go Again: Celebrating the Genius of Ray Charles&quot; album, released in 2011.

===2010s===

In 2010, Nelson released &quot;Country Music&quot;, a compilation of standards produced by T-Bone Burnett. The album peaked number four in &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums, and twenty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was nominated for Best Americana Album at the 2011 Grammy Awards. In 2011 Nelson participated in the concert &quot;Kokua For Japan&quot;, a fund raising event for the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan which raised $1.6 million.

In February 2012, Legacy Recordings signed a deal with Nelson that included the release of new material, as well as past releases that would be selected and complemented with outtakes and other material selected by him. With the new deal, Buddy Cannon returned to produce the recordings of Nelson. After selecting the material and the sound of the tunes with the singer, Cannon&#x27;s work method consisted in the recording of the tracks with studio musicians, with the takes later completed on a separate session by Nelson with his guitar. Cannon&#x27;s association to Nelson also extended to songwriting, with singer and producer composing the lyrics by exchanging text messages.

Nelson&#x27;s first release for the Legacy Recordings was &quot;Heroes&quot;, that included guest appearances by his sons Lukas and Micah of the band Insects vs Robots, Ray Price, Merle Haggard, Snoop Dogg, Kris Kristofferson, Jamey Johnson, Billy Joe Shaver and Sheryl Crow. The album reached number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums. His 2013 release &quot;To All the Girls...&quot;, a collection of duets with all female partners, featured among others Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Rosanne Cash, Sheryl Crow, Mavis Staples, Norah Jones, Emmylou Harris, Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert. The album entered &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country Albums at number two, marking his highest position on the chart since the release of his 1989 &quot;A Horse Called Music&quot;, and extending his record to a total of forty-six top ten albums on the country charts. Nelson scored as well his second top ten album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, with the release entering at number nine.
Nelson&#x27;s following release was &quot;Band of Brothers&quot;, in 2014, the first Nelson album to feature the most newly self-penned songs since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Spirit&quot;. Upon its release, it topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country albums chart, the first time since 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Promiseland&quot;, the last Nelson album to top it. The release reached number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, Nelson&#x27;s highest position on the chart since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Always on My Mind&quot;. In December 2014, a duet with Rhonda Vincent, &quot;Only Me&quot;, topped &quot;Bluegrass Unlimited&#x27;s&quot; National Airplay chart. In June 2015, his collaboration with Haggard &quot;Django and Jimmie&quot; topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Country albums chart and reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2017, Nelson released &quot;God&#x27;s Problem Child&quot;. The release, consisting mostly of Nelson originals co-written with Cannon, entered the Top country albums at number one, while it reached number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

In 2018, Nelson sang a song written by Daniel Lanois called &quot;Cruel World&quot; for the soundtrack of Rockstar Games&#x27;s action-adventure video game &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot;. Lanois wrote the song especially for Nelson. When a hurricane prevented Nelson from recording the song, the production team sent the track to Josh Homme in the hopes that he could record it in time for the game&#x27;s release. Nelson was ultimately able to record the song in time in Los Angeles; the team considered combining the two versions into a duet, but ultimately included both versions in the game. Also in 2018, Nelson was one of several artists on &quot;Restoration&quot;, a cover album containing various country renditions of songs originally by Elton John, on which he performed &quot;Border Song&quot;. His 2019 release &quot;Ride Me Back Home&quot; charted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Country Albums chart. For the title-track, Nelson received the Grammy Award for Best Country Solo Performance.

===2020s===
Following the U.S. coronavirus pandemic lockdowns that began in March 2020, Nelson livestreamed a series of benefit concerts. The first two raised $700,000 for people who had suffered financial loss due to effects on the U.S. economy. The third, which was held on April 20, 2020, was a variety show titled &quot;Come and Toke It&quot;. Some of the content was cannabis-themed, and some of the proceeds will be used to support The Last Prisoner Project, a restorative justice program relating to persons convicted of cannabis related crimes. The same year, Nelson was approached by Karen O of The Yeah Yeah Yeahs to collaborate. They chose to perform David Bowie and Queen&#x27;s Under Pressure.

For his releases of &quot;The Willie Nelson Family&quot; (2021) and &quot;A Beautiful Time&quot; (2022), Nelson received four nominations for the 65th Annual Grammy Awards winning in two categories: Best Country Solo Performance and Best Country Album. In December 2022, Mark Rothbaum announced the release of a five-part documentary entitled &quot;Willie Nelson and Family&quot; released at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival. In 2023, Nelson performed at two concerts at the Hollywood Bowl celebrating his 90th birthday and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2024, Nelson was featured in the &quot;Smoke Hour ★ Willie Nelson&quot; and &quot;Smoke Hour II&quot; interludes of Beyoncé&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Carter&quot; album, the second album in her trilogy project. With the death of Kris Kristofferson in September 2024, Nelson became the last surviving member of The Highwaymen.

==Other ventures==
Nelson&#x27;s acting debut was in the 1979 film &quot;The Electric Horseman&quot;, followed by appearances in &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, and &quot;Barbarosa&quot;. He played the role of Red Loon in &quot;Coming Out of the Ice&quot; in 1982 and starred in &quot;Songwriter&quot; two years later. He portrayed the lead role in the 1986 film version of his album &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. Other movies that Nelson acted in include &quot;Wag the Dog&quot;, &quot;Gone Fishin&#x27;&quot; (as Billy &#x27;Catch&#x27; Pooler), the 1986 television movie &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (with Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, and Kris Kristofferson), &quot;Half Baked&quot;, &quot;Beerfest&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, &quot;Surfer, Dude&quot; and &quot;Swing Vote&quot;. He has also made guest appearances on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (1986&#x27;s &quot;El Viejo&quot; episode); &quot;Delta&quot;; &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;; &quot;The Simpsons&quot;; &quot;Monk&quot;; &quot;Adventures in Wonderland&quot;; &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;; &quot;King of the Hill&quot;; &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;; &quot;Swing Vote&quot;; and &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;.
In 1988 his first book, &quot;&quot;, was published. &quot;The Facts of Life: And Other Dirty Jokes&quot;, a personal recollection of tour and musical stories from his career, combined with song lyrics, followed in 2002. In 2005 he co-authored &quot;Farm Aid: A Song for America&quot;, a commemorative book about the twentieth anniversary of the foundation of Farm Aid. His third book, co-authored with long-time friend Turk Pipkin, &quot;The Tao of Willie: A Guide to the Happiness in Your Heart&quot;, was published in 2006. In 2007 a book advocating the use of bio-diesel and the reduction of gas emissions, &quot;On The Clean Road Again: Biodiesel and The Future of the Family Farm&quot;, was published. His next book, &quot;A Tale Out of Luck&quot;, published in 2008 and co-authored by Mike Blakely, was Nelson&#x27;s first fictional book. In 2012, it was announced the release of a new autobiography by Nelson, &quot;Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die: Musings from the Road&quot;. Released on November 13, it was named after the song from his album &quot;Heroes&quot;. The book contained further biographical details, as well as family pictures and stories about Nelson&#x27;s political views, as well as his marijuana advocacy. The artwork of the book was designed by Nelson&#x27;s son, Micah, and the foreword written by Kinky Friedman. In 2015, the publication of a second Nelson autobiography entitled &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Story: My Life&quot; co-authored with David Ritz, the book was published on May 5, 2015. &quot;Pretty Paper&quot;, another collaboration with Ritz was published the following year.

In 2002, Nelson became the official spokesman of the Texas Roadhouse, a chain of steakhouses. Nelson heavily promoted the chain and appeared on a special on Food Network. The chain installed &quot;Willie&#x27;s Corner&quot;, a section dedicated to him and decked out with Willie memorabilia, at several locations. In 2004, Nelson and his wife Annie became partners with Bob and Kelly King in the building of two Pacific Bio-diesel plants, one in Salem, Oregon, and the other at Carl&#x27;s Corner, Texas (the Texas plant was founded by Carl Cornelius, a longtime Nelson friend and the eponym for Carl&#x27;s Corner). In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel (&quot;Bio-Willie&quot;), a company that was marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops. The fuel was made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in diesel engines. Nelson registered his company with Earth Biofuels and he became a board member. In 2007, Nelson forfeited six million shares of the company as he left the board. By 2008, he reopened Willie&#x27;s Place, a truck stop in Carl&#x27;s Corner, Texas. The U.S. Bankruptcy Court allowed Nelson to invest in it. The establishment had about 80 employees, and was used as a concert hall with a bar and a dance floor. Willie&#x27;s Place also featured BioWillie pumps. At the time, the government of the United States offered a one dollar tax credit to producers of biodiesel. As the competition grew, the tax credit was discontinued while the prices of fossil fuels continued to drop. Nelson and his partners defaulted the $4,75 million loan they took for the construction of Willie&#x27;s Place. Nelson then paid $35,000 back, while a judge later rejected the request of his creditors to receive more money from him. TravelCenters of America bought Willie&#x27;s Place during its foreclosure in 2011. The BioWillie plant was then put on the market for sale. Nelson kept the trademark for BioWillie, which is sold in the islands of Maui and Hawaii. Meanwhile, Nelson owns shares of Big Island Biodiesel in Hawaii and SeQuential-Pacific Biodiesel in Oregon.

In 2010, Nelson founded with the collaboration of producers and filmmakers Luck Films, a company dedicated to produce feature films, documentaries and concerts. The next year, he created the Willie&#x27;s Roadhouse show which aired on channel 56 of SiriusXM radio. The channel was a result of the merger of his two other channels &quot;The Roadhouse&quot; and &quot;Willie&#x27;s Place&quot;. In November 2014, it was announced that Nelson would be the host of the television series &quot;Inside Arlyn&quot;, shot at Arlyn Studio in Austin, Texas. The thirteen-episode first season would feature artists being interviewed by Nelson and Dan Rather, followed by a performance. The series concept received attention from cable channels that requested to see the pilot episode. Following the legalization of marijuana in different states, Nelson announced in 2015 through spokesman Michael Bowman the establishment of his own marijuana brand, Willie&#x27;s Reserve. Plans to open chain stores in the states where marijuana was legalized were announced, to be expanded state-to-state if marijuana legalization is further expanded. Bowman called the brand &quot;a culmination of (Nelson&#x27;s) vision, and his whole life&quot;.

In 2017, Nelson appeared as himself in Woody Harrelson&#x27;s live film, &quot;Lost in London&quot;. In June 2017, he appeared alongside Merle Haggard in the documentary &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon. They performed a song Haggard had composed for the film, &quot;The Only Man Wilder Than Me&quot;, and Bob Wills&#x27;s classic &quot;Old Fashioned Love&quot;, which they recorded live direct to disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. It was the last filmed performance of the pair. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; commented that &quot;in the final performance of Sessions, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard perform the duet &#x27;The Only Man Wilder Than Me.&#x27; Haggard has a look of complete joy on his face throughout the session in the old-timey recording setup once used by his musical heroes.&quot;

==Music style==
Nelson uses a variety of music styles to create his own distinctive blend of country music, a hybrid of jazz, pop, blues, rock and folk. His &quot;unique sound&quot;, which uses a &quot;relaxed, behind-the-beat singing style and gut-string guitar&quot; and his &quot;nasal voice and jazzy, off-center phrasing&quot;, has been responsible for his wide appeal, and has made him a &quot;vital icon in country music&quot;, influencing the &quot;new country, new traditionalist, and alternative country movements of the 1980s and 1990s&quot;.

===Guitars===

In 1969, the Baldwin company gave Nelson an amplifier and guitar with their &quot;Prismatone&quot; pickup. During a show in Helotes, Texas, Nelson left the guitar on the floor of the stage, and it was later stepped on by a drunk man.
He sent it to be repaired in Nashville by Shot Jackson, who told Nelson that the damage was too great. Jackson offered him a Martin N-20 classical guitar, and, at Nelson&#x27;s request, moved the pickup to the Martin. Nelson purchased the guitar unseen for $750 and named it after Roy Rogers&#x27; horse &quot;Trigger&quot;. The next year Nelson rescued the guitar from his burning ranch.

Constant strumming with a guitar pick over the decades has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar&#x27;s body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no pickguard since classical guitars are meant to be played fingerstyle instead of with picks. Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson&#x27;s friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches. The first signature on the guitar was Leon Russell&#x27;s, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar. In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: &quot;When Trigger goes, I&#x27;ll quit&quot;. He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent arrived there, and then deliver it to him in Maui. Nelson then concealed the guitar in his manager&#x27;s house until his debt was paid off in 1993.

==Political views and activism==
Nelson is vocal supporter of a number of causes. Along with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, he set up Farm Aid in 1985 to assist and increase awareness of the importance of family farms, after Bob Dylan&#x27;s comments during the Live Aid concert that he hoped some of the money would help American farmers in danger of losing their farms through mortgage debt. The first concert included Dylan, Billy Joel, B.B. King, Roy Orbison, and Neil Young among many others, and raised over $9 million for America&#x27;s family farmers. Besides organizing and performing in the annual concerts, Nelson is the president of the board of Farm Aid.

Nelson is a co-chair of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) advisory board. He has worked with NORML for years, promoting marijuana legalization. In 2005 Nelson and his family hosted the first annual &quot;Willie Nelson &amp; NORML Benefit Golf Tournament&quot;, leading to a cover appearance and inside interview in the January 2008 issue of &quot;High Times&quot; magazine. After Nelson&#x27;s arrest for possession of marijuana in 2010, he created Willie Nelson&#x27;s TeaPot Party under the motto &quot;Tax it, regulate it and legalize it!&quot; Nelson got 19 write-in votes for President of the United States in the Minnesota Legal Marijuana Now presidential primary held on March 5, 2024.

In 2001, following the September 11 attacks, Nelson participated in the benefit telethon &quot;&quot;, leading the rest of the celebrities singing the song &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. In 2010, during an interview with Larry King, Nelson expressed his doubts with regards to the attacks and the official story. Nelson explained that he could not believe that the buildings could collapse due to the planes, attributing instead the result to an implosion.
Nelson supported Dennis Kucinich&#x27;s campaign in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries. He raised money, appeared at events, and composed the song &quot;Whatever Happened to Peace on Earth?&quot;, criticizing the war in Iraq. He recorded a radio advertisement asking for support to put musician/author Kinky Friedman on the ballot as an independent candidate for the 2006 Texas gubernatorial election. Friedman promised Nelson a job in Austin as the head of a new Texas Energy Commission due to his support of bio-fuels. In January 2008, Nelson filed a suit against the Texas Democratic Party, alleging that the party violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution by refusing to allow co-plaintiff Kucinich to appear on the primary ballot because he had scratched out part of the loyalty oath on his application.

Nelson is an advocate for better treatment for horses and has been campaigning for the passage of the American Horse Slaughter Prevention Act (H.R. 503/S. 311) alongside the Animal Welfare Institute. He is on its board of directors and has adopted a number of horses from &quot;Habitat for Horses&quot;. In 2008, Nelson signed on to warn consumers about the cruel and illegal living conditions for calves raised to produce milk for dairy products. He wrote letters to Land O&#x27;Lakes and Challenge Dairy, two of the major corporations that use milk from calves raised at California&#x27;s Mendes Calf Ranch, which employs an intensive confinement practice that was the subject of a lawsuit and campaign brought by the Animal Legal Defense Fund. Nelson is seen in the film &quot;The Garden&quot; supporting the impoverished community South Central Farm in Southern Los Angeles.

A supporter of the LGBT movement, Nelson published in 2006 through iTunes a version of Ned Sublette&#x27;s &quot;Cowboys Are Frequently, Secretly Fond of Each Other&quot;, that met instant success. During an interview with &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; in 2013, regarding the Defense of Marriage Act and same-sex marriage in the United States, Nelson responded to a comparison the interviewer made with the civil rights movement, stating: &quot;We&#x27;ll look back and say it was crazy that we ever even argued about this&quot;. He also presented two logos with the pink equal sign, symbol of the LGBT movement. The first one, featured the sign represented with two long braids; while the second one, featured the sign represented with two marijuana cigarettes. The use of the logos became popular quickly in social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

In June 2018, Nelson deplored the Trump administration family separation policy. During his Fourth of July Picnic, he performed a song with Beto O&#x27;Rourke, the Democratic candidate for the Senate election in Texas. Nelson endorsed O&#x27;Rourke, and received negative reactions from the conservative part of his followers. On September 29, 2018, Nelson offered a free concert in Austin supporting the candidate&#x27;s run. The last number he performed was &quot;Vote &#x27;Em Out&quot;, a new track that was subsequently released as a single.

==Personal life==
Nelson has been married four times and has eight children. His first marriage was to Martha Matthews from 1952 to 1962. The couple had three children: Lana, Susie, and Willie &quot;Billy&quot; Hugh Jr. The latter died by suicide in 1991. The marriage was marked by violence, with Matthews assaulting Nelson several times, including one incident when she sewed him up in bedsheets and beat him with a broomstick. Nelson&#x27;s next marriage was to Shirley Collie in 1963. The couple divorced in 1971, after Collie found a bill from the maternity ward of a Houston hospital charged to Nelson and Connie Koepke for the birth of Paula Carlene Nelson. Nelson married Koepke the same year, and they had another daughter, Amy Lee Nelson. Following a divorce in 1988, he married his current wife, Annie D&#x27;Angelo, in 1991. They have two sons, Lukas Autry and Jacob Micah. In 2012, Nelson learned that he fathered a daughter with his friend Mary Haney. Born on January 22, 1953, Rene Butts (born Lynda Renee Barley) met Nelson and she shared a picture of both of them on Father&#x27;s Day in 2016. Butts died in 2017.

Nelson owns &quot;Luck, Texas&quot;, a ranch in Spicewood, and also lives in Maui, Hawaii with several celebrity neighbors. While swimming in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson&#x27;s lung collapsed. He was taken to the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled. Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended. He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco. In 2008, he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke. In 2004, Nelson underwent surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar. On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery. In 2012, he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson&#x27;s health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas. After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent stem-cell therapy in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.

During his childhood, Nelson grew interested in martial arts. He ordered self-defense manuals on jujitsu and judo that he saw advertised in &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; comic books. Nelson started to formally practice kung fu after he moved to Nashville, in the 1960s. During the 1980s, Nelson began training in taekwondo and now holds a second-degree black belt in that discipline. During the 1990s, Nelson started to practice the Korean martial art GongKwon Yusul. In 2014, after 20 years in the discipline, his Grand Master Sam Um presented him with a fifth-degree black belt in a ceremony held in Austin, Texas. A 2014 &quot;Tae Kwon Do Times&quot; magazine interview revealed that Nelson had developed an unorthodox manner of training during the lengthy periods of time he was on tour. Nelson would conduct his martial arts training on his tour bus &quot;The Honeysuckle Rose&quot; and send videos to his supervising Master for review and critique.

In March 2021, Nelson recorded a version of the popular standard &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Seeing You&quot; that was used on a public service announcement by the Ad Council to encourage COVID-19 vaccination in the United States. Earlier in January 2021, Nelson and his sister received the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. In May 2022, Nelson postponed several shows after he contracted COVID-19. Nelson&#x27;s wife detailed that he was severely affected by the illness, and that he received a treatment including Paxlovid, monoclonal antibodies, and steroids. Nelson resumed his tour in September 2022. During June 2024, Nelson had to cancel his performances at Outlaw Music Festival due to health complications and was ordered to rest for four days by a doctor.

===Legal issues===
Nelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977, after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.

In 1994, Texas Highway patrolmen found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented his attending the Grammy awards that year. While traveling to Ann W. Richards&#x27; funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. Nelson received six months probation.

On November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in Sierra Blanca, Texas, for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of $2,500. Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a $100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing &quot;Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain&quot; for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking. Nelson&#x27;s lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a $500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement. The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence. Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.

===Issues with the Internal Revenue Service===
In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson&#x27;s assets, claiming that he owed $32 million. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson&#x27;s situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired his manager Neil Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson&#x27;s income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased by the end of the decade.

His lawyer, Jay Goldberg, negotiated the sum to be lowered to $16 million. Later, Nelson&#x27;s attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid $6 million, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement. Nelson released &quot;The IRS Tapes: Who&#x27;ll Buy My Memories?&quot; as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put his money in illegal tax shelters. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount and Nelson cleared his debts by 1993.

==Legacy==
Nelson is widely recognized as an American icon. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1993, and he received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1998. In 2011, Nelson was inducted to the National Agricultural Hall of Fame, for his labor in Farm Aid and other fund raisers to benefit farmers. In 2015 Nelson won the Gershwin Prize, the lifetime award of the Library of Congress. In 2018, The Texas Institute of Letters inducted him among its members for his songwriting. He was included by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on its &quot;100 Greatest Singers&quot; and &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists&quot; lists.

In 2003, Texas Governor Perry signed bill No. 2582, introduced by State Representative Elizabeth Ames Jones and Senator Jeff Wentworth, which funded the &quot;Texas Music Project&quot;, the state&#x27;s official music charity. Nelson was named honorary chairman of the advisory board of the project. In 2005, Democratic Texas Senator Gonzalo Barrientos introduced a bill to name of the Travis County section of State Highway 130 after Nelson, and at one point 23 of the 31 state senators were co-sponsors of the bill. The legislation was dropped after two Republican senators, Florence Shapiro and Wentworth, objected, citing Nelson&#x27;s lack of connection to the highway, his fund raisers for Democrats, his drinking, and his marijuana advocacy.

An important collection of Willie Nelson materials (1975–1994) became part of the Wittliff collections of Southwestern Writers, Texas State University, San Marcos, Texas. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson&#x27;s IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson&#x27;s friend Bill Wittliff, who wrote or co-wrote &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, &quot;Barbarosa&quot; and &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;. In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson&#x27;s fans.

In April 2010, Nelson received the &quot;Feed the Peace&quot; award from The Nobelity Project for his extensive work with Farm Aid and overall contributions to world peace. On June 23, 2010, he was inducted into the Library of Congress&#x27;s National Recording Registry. Nelson is an honorary trustee of the Dayton International Peace Museum.
In 2010, Austin, Texas renamed Second Street to Willie Nelson Boulevard. The city also unveiled a life-size statue to honor him, placed at the entrance of &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;&#x27; new studio. The non-profit organization Capital Area Statues commissioned sculptor Clete Shields to execute the project. The statue was unveiled on April 20, 2012. The date selected by the city of Austin unintentionally coincided with the number 4/20, associated with cannabis culture. In spite of the coincidence and Nelson&#x27;s advocacy for the legalization of marijuana, the ceremony was scheduled also for 4:20 pm. During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song &quot;Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die&quot;. The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award, which was also named after him. In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the Berklee College of Music. The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the &quot;Austin City Limits&quot; Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.

For many years, Nelson&#x27;s image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of Stuff Magazine Nelson was interviewed about his long locks. &quot;I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don&#x27;t know, probably in the 70&#x27;s.&quot; On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair, and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home. In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings&#x27; sobriety.

Nelson&#x27;s touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist Mickey Raphael, bassist Bee Spears, drummer/percussionist Billy English (Paul&#x27;s younger brother), and guitarist Jody Payne. The current lineup only includes Nelson himself, Raphael, and Billy English from the classic lineup, as Jody Payne retired (before dying in 2013), Bee Spears died in 2011, Paul English died in 2020, and Willie&#x27;s sister Bobbie Nelson died in 2022. &quot;Willie &amp; Family&quot; tours North America in the bio-diesel bus &quot;Honeysuckle Rose&quot;, which is fueled by Bio-Willie. Nelson&#x27;s tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the &quot;Honeysuckle Rose I&quot; in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in Nova Scotia, Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the &quot;Honeysuckle Rose V&quot;.

<text>Osterholz is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is bounded by (from the west and clockwise) the districts of Wesermarsch, Cuxhaven, Rotenburg and Verden, and by the city of Bremen.

==History==
Originally the prince-archbishops of Bremen ruled the area comprising today&#x27;s district. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1807 the ephemeral Kingdom of Westphalia annexed the Duchy, before France annexed it in 1810, there comprising a part of the département Bouches-du-Weser. In 1813 the Duchy was restored to the Electorate of Hanover, which - after its upgrade to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1814 - incorporated the Duchy in a real union and the Ducal territory became part of the Stade Region, established in 1823. In 1866 the Kingdom of Hanover fell to Prussia, forming the Province of Hanover. The Prussian administration established districts in 1885, among them the district of Osterholz.

==Geography==
The southern part of the district is part of the Bremen metropolitan area. In the north there is the &quot;Teufelsmoor&quot; (&quot;dead moor&quot; (lit. &quot;devil&#x27;s moor&quot;)), one of the largest existing fens in Germany. Large marshes extend on both sides of the River Hamme, which runs through the district from north to south to join the River Wümme. The Wümme forms the southern border and is a tributary of the Weser; the Weser forms the western border of Osterholz.

<text>Rotenburg is a district (&quot;Landkreis&quot;) in Lower Saxony, Germany. It is landlocked by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Stade, Harburg, Heidekreis, Verden, Osterholz and Cuxhaven.

==History==

In medieval times the region was part of the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden. After the Protestant Reformation the bishoprics became secular principalities, colloquially called Bremen-Verden, and finally parts of the Kingdom of Hanover.

The present district was established in 1977 by merging the former districts of Rotenburg and Bremervörde.

==Geography==

The Wümme River runs through the district from east to west. The marshy area to both sides of the river is called the &quot;Wümmeniederung&quot; (Wümme Depression).

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms displays:
* a lion carrying a cross; the lion was the heraldic animal of Hanover, the cross is symbolising the Prince-Bishopric of Verden
* two criss-crossed keys from the arms of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen

<doc id="149714" wikidata="Q1169161" url="?curid=149714" title="Das Judenthum in der Musik">
<text>&quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot; (German for &quot;Judaism in Music&quot;, but perhaps more accurately understood in contemporary language as &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;), is an antisemitic essay by composer Richard Wagner which criticizes the influence of Jews and their &quot;essence&quot; on European art music, arguing that they have not contributed to its development but have rather commodified and degraded it. 

It alleges that Jews infiltrated the music industry not through their artistic capabilities, but because of their control over financial resources. In particular it discusses the music of Jewish composers Felix Mendelssohn and Giacomo Meyerbeer, acknowledging its technical proficiency but criticizing it as lacking genuine artistic passion. According to Wagner, authentic art is rooted in immersion within the organic life of a culture, and Jews, indicated as being outsiders to this culture, are capable of only making artificial or superficial contributions.

It was first published under a pseudonym in the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot; (&quot;NZM&quot;) of Leipzig in September 1850. It was republished in 1869, this time bearing Wagner&#x27;s name, with expanded commentary on the original publication&#x27;s purpose, response and the purported negative impact on Wagner and his associates&#x27; careers.

==Background==
There is debate over the translation of the title, &quot;Das Judenthum in der Musik&quot;, into English. The article&#x27;s first translator, William Ashton Ellis, gave it the title &quot;Judaism in Music&quot;. &quot;Judaism&quot; in modern English tends to refer to the Abrahamic religion of the Jews. &quot;Judenthum&quot; however in 19th-century Germany carried a much broader meaning, including the culture and social practices of the Jews. It also carried a pejorative sense associating Jews with money-making. Karl Marx in his 1843 essay &quot;On the Jewish Question&quot; uses the word in this sense, in which he associates Jews intrinsically with capitalist enterprise. Wagner also intended this latter dual meaning, given the context of the essay in which he uses &quot;Judenthum&quot; almost synonymously with &quot;commercialism&quot;; this usage is also reflected in his personal letters.

Wagner&#x27;s essay primarily attacks Jewish culture, artistic taste, and alleged economic power and commercialism, rather than the Jewish race or religion. In the essay Wagner speaks of the need to emancipate both Jews and non-Jews from &quot;Judenthum&quot;. For this reason, alternative translations of the title have been given, including &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot; and &quot;Jewry in Music&quot;.

The essay was written during his exile in Zürich after participating in the May Uprising in Dresden, part of the Revolutions of 1848. It follows &quot;Art and Revolution&quot; and &quot;The Artwork of the Future&quot; in a series of polemical essays intended to provoke controversy and discussion over the purpose and future direction of European art. Wagner had a radical mindset at the time, and was formulating what would become his magnum opus, the 16-hour long music drama &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;, with which he intended to revitalize German art and society, which he perceived to be in decline.

In these previous essays, Wagner criticized the perceived shallowness of the then-popular French grand opera, such as that of the celebrated Jewish composer Giacomo Meyerbeer. Wagner was emboldened to write again on the subject, this time from a fully antisemitic perspective, after learning of the great success of Meyerbeer&#x27;s 1849 opera &quot;Le prophète&quot;, and reading a series of essays written by his close associate Theodor Uhlig, criticizing &quot;Le prophète&quot; as exemplifying inferior &quot;Hebrew artistic taste&quot;.

==The original article of 1850==
The first version of the article appeared in the &quot;NZM&quot; under the pseudonym of K. Freigedank (&quot;K. Freethought&quot;). In an April 1851 letter to Franz Liszt, Wagner stated that he used a pseudonym &quot;not out of fear, but to prevent the question being dragged down by the Jews to a purely personal level&quot;. Ironically, this same letter also reveals Wagner&#x27;s deep personal antipathy for Meyerbeer as partially motivating the essay, who reminds him of the “darkest” period of his life.

In the essay, Wagner criticizes the artistry of Jews. Wagner argues that Jewish participation in European music represents not a contribution to its enrichment, but rather a symptom of a cultural epoch in decline.

Wagner uses Felix Mendelssohn and a contemporary, unnamed Jewish opera composer (Meyerbeer) as examples to argue that while Jewish artists may achieve technical proficiency, their works ultimately fail to resonate deeply with the spirit of true artistry. This disconnect stems from an inherent outsider perspective that Jewish artists have towards European cultural traditions, which prevents them from creating art that genuinely reflects these traditions&#x27; spirit. 

Wagner’s negative assessment of Meyerbeer&#x27;s music was not in isolation, but was in fact in tune with the prevailing critical consensus in Germany at the time, according to which Meyerbeer&#x27;s works displayed &quot;rhythmic monotony and undue eclecticism, elevating contrived effect above genuine dramatic tension&quot;. Wagner accuses Meyerbeer&#x27;s audience in Paris as seeking cheap distractions from their boredom, rather than desiring engagement with a real art that challenges and elevates them.

Wagner reflects on an emotional &quot;instinctive repulsion&quot; towards Jews that remains in European society at large despite high-minded liberal social emancipation efforts, and a lack of genuine integration or acceptance of Jews. Wagner argues this repulsion needs to be acknowledged and discussed, rather than suppressed and ignored, so once the specific details of its triggering are understood, could steps be taken to resolve the social friction between Jews and non-Jews.

Despite calls for understanding and reconciliation, the essay is rife with insulting and provocative antisemitism. Wagner harshly attacks the Hebrew language, speech patterns, and appearance of Jews as aesthetically unpleasing and unsuited for artistic expression. In one metaphor, Wagner suggests that just as worms consume a body after it has died, so do Jews take over a European culture&#x27;s music after its native vitality has diminished.

==Reception of the 1850 article==
&quot;NZM&quot; had a very small circulation, estimated at 1500–2000 readers. Despite Wagner&#x27;s hoping to create a sensation and open public debate, the response was muted. A single letter of complaint was sent to Franz Brendel, the editor of &quot;NZM&quot;, from Mendelssohn&#x27;s old colleague Ignaz Moscheles. He and ten other professors at the Leipzig Conservatory (founded by Mendelssohn in 1843) requested that Brendel resign from the conservatory&#x27;s board. Brendel kept his position. The article was poorly received even amongst Wagner&#x27;s associates, most notably composer Franz Liszt, who was embarrassed by the article and thought it to be a passing phase or mere fit of pique.

==The 1869 republishing==
Seeking to explain to friends the source of the unprecedented hostility towards himself and his artwork by music critics in the press, Wagner republished his essay in 1869 under his own name along with expanded commentary on the original&#x27;s purpose and reception. Some edits were made to the original 1850 text, toning down its offensive language.

Wagner defends his use of a pseudonym in the original publication of the essay, having wanted to prevent the discussion from being diverted to personal matters, which he believed would happen if his real name was attached. Despite this, Wagner was soon recognized as the essay&#x27;s author. 

According to Wagner, while the original essay itself was ignored in an effort to stifle the conversation it sought to provoke, critics pivoted to attacking him in other areas, such as his other published art writings and stage works, in a &quot;reverse persecution&quot; by the Jewish intelligentsia which Wagner asserts controls the press. This included the significant mocking of himself and Liszt as the &quot;prophets&quot; of the &quot;Music of the Future&quot; in the newspapers, led by music critic Eduard Hanslick, who initially supported Wagner but later turned on him around 1854, with his publication of &quot;On the Beautiful in Music&quot;. Hanslick&#x27;s theory of aesthetic beauty based on formal structure, which Wagner derides in his essay as &quot;Jewish&quot;, was at odds with Wagner&#x27;s own theories based on relatively formless passionate expression. 

Wagner argues at length against Hanslick&#x27;s &quot;Music Judaism&quot;, which includes not just Jewish musicians but any composer who adopts this diluted style. He cites Robert Schumann as a composer whose youthful and spirited compositions turned superficial and pretentious in later years due to the influence of &quot;Music Judaism&quot;.

In closing, Wagner appeals to the Jewish people directly, acknowledging the significant talents and virtues within Jewish society and suggesting that the oppression faced by the German spirit under Judaism is even more burdensome for the Jews themselves. Wagner expresses a hope, albeit faint, that open criticism of their relationship with Judaism might encourage even those within the Jewish community to fight for their &quot;true emancipation&quot;. He argues for the necessity of openly addressing the challenges of assimilating the Jewish people into German culture, not to halt cultural decline through exclusion, but to foster a shared development towards higher human qualities.

==Reception of the 1869 article and aftermath==
Once again many of Wagner&#x27;s supporters were troubled by the essay&#x27;s provocation. By this time, Wagner was a well-known public figure and the publication brought many responses in the press. Productions of &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; were hissed, and a Berlin production of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; had to be delayed. Ironically, when the &quot;Lohengrin&quot; production proceeded, it was enthusiastically received by the Jews in attendance. When Wagner heard this news, he was dismayed at the implication that the Jews had &quot;forgiven&quot; him for having written the &quot;hasty&quot; article, rather than grasped its true purpose.

Despite making his anti-Jewish sentiments publicly known, Wagner enjoyed close friendships with a circle of notable Jews. These included the conductor Hermann Levi (who premiered &quot;Parsifal&quot; in 1882), the pianists Carl Tausig and , the writer Heinrich Porges, and others.

In his later years, Wagner&#x27;s antipathy towards Jews and &quot;Judenthum&quot; would apparently soften as he became more humanist, less focused on politics and more concerned with metaphysical and spiritual matters. Heavily influenced by the philosophy of Schopenhauer and the Indian religions Buddhism and Hinduism, Wagner came to regard the true problem facing humanity as what he called &quot;Weltenwahn&quot;: &quot;World-madness&quot;, similar to the concept of &quot;Maya&quot; in these religions: a delusion blinding society brought on by materialism, greed, and lust for power, which perpetuates human suffering. Wagner would name his final private residence in Bayreuth as &quot;Wahnfried&quot;: &quot;Peace-from-madness&quot;.

Rather than needing emancipation from &quot;Judenthum&quot;, Wagner notes in his late essay &quot;Know Thyself&quot; (&quot;Erkenne dich Selbst&quot;, 1881) that this &quot;madness&quot; arises from within German society itself just as much as Jewish society, though Germans blame their troubles on external elements like the Jews rather than identifying the source within themselves:

What we don&#x27;t understand, we attack. And if we end up hurting ourselves in the process, we convince ourselves that it was someone else who hurt us. Who wouldn&#x27;t see this happening again today when observing the current movement against Jews with this idea in mind?

Wagner writes of the need for a spiritual awakening for all of humanity to realize their shared &quot;simple, sacred dignity&quot;. Only once society has woken up, will there &quot;be no more Jews&quot;, not due to their physical eradication, or even loss of their essence due to assimilation, but because such a noble process will result in the end of division and conflict based on all such superficial identities, with humanity recognizing itself as one. These themes are explored in his final opera &quot;Parsifal&quot;.

That Wagner wanted nothing to do with the racial antisemitic movements growing in the late 19th century at the time, positing notions of superior and inferior races which would become the foundation of Nazism, is confirmed in his private letters:

From the modern antisemitic movement I stand completely distant. In an upcoming issue of the Bayreuther Blätter there will appear an article [&quot;Know Thyself&quot;] by me that ardently announces that it will actually be impossible for me to associate myself with that movement.

Despite these sentiments, after Wagner&#x27;s death in 1883, racialist antisemites such as the British-born Houston Stewart Chamberlain and Winifred Williams would descend on Bayreuth and its annual festival, taking it over, expelling Jewish musicians, and transforming it into a theater for the Nazis to subject Wagner&#x27;s stage works to racist interpretations, with Adolf Hitler appearing there often as an honored guest.

==Recent reception==
&quot;Das Judenthum&quot; would not create the serious controversy Wagner sought to provoke until the 1950s and 1960s, when scholars began researching a possible link between Wagner and his works with the philosophy and policies of Nazi Germany, most notably the Final Solution resulting in the Holocaust.

Hitler was known to be an enthusiastic admirer of Wagner&#x27;s music, and the music was frequently played during Nazi party rallies (along with the music of other German composers) as exemplifying German cultural supremacy. While Hitler owned several of Wagner&#x27;s music manuscripts as prized possessions, there is no evidence Hitler and other Nazi leadership members read &quot;Das Judenthum&quot; or were even aware of its existence. As the essay was largely regarded as an embarrassment to the early Wagnerites, there was just one reprint of the essay in Weimar in 1914, before the Nazis came to power. During the Nazi era there were two further publications: in Berlin in 1934 and in Leipzig in 1939. Neither of these appear to have been large editions with significant readership.

Despite the limited impact of the essay&#x27;s publications on German cultural affairs, it has since served as an important document to understand the nature of Wagner&#x27;s antisemitic worldview and whether this antisemitism is present in his stage works. Scholars such as Theodor Adorno have asserted that it is present, but this is strongly disputed by others. The topic remains under considerable debate in both academia and amongst the opera-going public. With a few controversial exceptions, Wagner has not been publicly performed in what is today the modern state of Israel since 1938.

Some writers such as Bryan Magee have sought to make a qualified defense of Wagner&#x27;s originality of thought in &quot;Das Judenthum&quot;, despite acknowledging its malevolence. However, other scholars argue a more comprehensive consideration of the essay&#x27;s contents weakens his argument. Music historians have written to debunk the anti-Jewish thesis and arguments appearing in Wagner&#x27;s essay.

<text>Small Brown Bike is a band from Marshall, Michigan, United States that started in 1996. The trademark of Small Brown Bike is their &quot;double vocals&quot; backed by melodies. Their sound is often identified as being similar to other post-hardcore bands, such as Avail, Hot Water Music and Dillinger Four. Throughout their existence, Small Brown Bike have toured three times with Dead Season between 1999 and 2000 and once with Thoughts of Ionesco in 1999. Their last show was in 2004 at The Fireside Bowl in Chicago, after already agreeing to split up. Former members Mike Reed and Dan Jaquint later created the band LaSalle, with Reed&#x27;s wife playing bass guitar. Ben Reed also started the Great Sea Serpents based out of Chicago, IL. Mike and Ben have also formed the band Able Baker Fox with former drummer Jeff Gensterblum and Nathan Ellis from the Casket Lottery. Their first album &quot;Voices&quot; was released in January 2008.

The band name is derived from working on bicycles as they grew up together.

The band announced a return to songwriting on October 6, 2009, via their new website.

Guitarist Travis Dopp died of cancer on December 13, 2023.

<doc id="149717" wikidata="Q638210" url="?curid=149717" title="Four temperaments">
<text>The four temperament theory is a theory which suggests that there are four fundamental personality types: sanguine, choleric, [[melancholic]], and phlegmatic. Most formulations include the possibility of mixtures among the types where an individual&#x27;s personality types overlap and they share two or more temperaments. Greek physician Hippocrates (c. 460 – c. 370 BC) described the four temperaments as part of the ancient medical concept of humourism, that four bodily fluids affect human personality traits and behaviours. Modern medical science does not define a fixed relationship between internal secretions and personality, although some psychological personality type systems use categories similar to the Greek temperaments.

The four temperament theory was abandoned after the 1850s.

== History ==
Temperament theory has its roots in the ancient theory of humourism. It may have originated in Mesopotamia, but it was Greek physician Hippocrates (460–370 BC) (and later Galen) who developed it into a medical theory. He believed that certain human moods, emotions, and behaviours were caused by an excess or lack of body fluids (called &quot;humours&quot;), which he classified as blood, yellow bile, black bile, and phlegm, each of which was responsible for different patterns in personalities, as well as how susceptible one was to getting a disease. Galen (AD 129 – c. 200) developed the first typology of temperament in his dissertation &quot;De temperamentis&quot;, and searched for physiological reasons for different behaviours in humans. He classified them as &quot;hot/cold&quot; and &quot;dry/wet&quot; taken from the four elements. There could also be balance between the qualities, yielding a total of nine temperaments. The word &quot;temperament&quot; itself comes from Latin &quot;temperare&quot;, &quot;to mix&quot;. In the ideal personality, the complementary characteristics were exquisitely balanced among warm-cool and dry-moist. In four less-ideal types, one of the four qualities was dominant over all the others. In the remaining four types, one pair of qualities dominated the complementary pair; for example, warm and moist dominated cool and dry. These last four were the temperamental categories which Galen named &quot;sanguine&quot;, &quot;choleric&quot;, &quot;melancholic&quot;, and &quot;phlegmatic&quot; after the bodily humours. Each was the result of an excess of one of the humours which produced the imbalance in paired qualities.

For example, if a person tends to be too happy or &quot;sanguine&quot;, one can assume they have too much blood in proportion to the other humours, and can medically act accordingly. Likewise for being too calm and reserved or &quot;phlegmatic&quot; from too much phlegm; excessively sad or &quot;melancholic&quot; from too much black bile; and too angry or &quot;choleric&quot; from excess yellow bile.

The properties of these humours also corresponded to the four seasons. Thus blood, which was considered hot and wet, corresponded to spring. Yellow bile, considered hot and dry, corresponded to summer. Black bile, cold and dry, corresponded to autumn. And finally, phlegm, cold and wet, corresponded to winter.

These properties were considered the basis of health and disease. This meant that having a balance and good mixture of the humours defined good health, while an imbalance or separation of the humours led to disease. Because the humours corresponded to certain seasons, one way to avoid an imbalance or disease was to change health-related habits depending on the season. Some physicians did this by regulating a patient&#x27;s diet, while some used remedies such as phlebotomy and purges to get rid of excess blood. Even Galen proposed a theory of the importance of proper digestion in forming healthy blood. The idea was that the two most important factors when digesting are the types of food and the person&#x27;s body temperature. This meant that if too much heat were involved, then the blood would become &quot;overcooked.&quot; This meant that it would contain too much of the yellow bile, and the patient would become feverish. Lack of sufficient heat was believed to result in an excess of phlegm.

Persian polymath Avicenna (980–1037 AD) extended the theory of temperaments in his &quot;Canon of Medicine&quot;, which was a standard medical text at many medieval universities. He applied them to &quot;emotional aspects, mental capacity, moral attitudes, self-awareness, movements and dreams.&quot; Nicholas Culpeper (1616–1654) suggested that the humors acted as governing principles in bodily health, with astrological correspondences, and explained their influence upon physiognomy and personality. He proposed that some people had a single temperament, while others had an admixture of two, a primary and secondary temperament.

Modern medical science has rejected the theories of the four temperaments, though their use persists as a metaphor within certain psychological fields. Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), Erich Adickes (1866–1925), Alfred Adler (1879–1937), Eduard Spranger (1914), Ernst Kretschmer (1920), and Erich Fromm (1947) all theorised on the four temperaments (with different names) and greatly shaped modern theories of temperament. Hans Eysenck (1916–1997) was one of the first psychologists to analyse personality differences using a psycho-statistical method called factor analysis, and his research led him to believe that temperament is biologically based. The factors that he proposed in his book &quot;Dimensions of Personality&quot; were neuroticism (N), the tendency to experience negative emotions, and extraversion (E), the tendency to enjoy positive events, especially social ones. By pairing the two dimensions, Eysenck noted how the results were similar to the four ancient temperaments.

In the field of physiology, Ivan Pavlov studied on the types and properties of the nervous system, where three main properties were identified: strength, mobility of nervous processes and balance between excitation and inhibition, and derived four types based on these three properties.

Other researchers developed similar systems, many of which did not use the ancient temperament names, and several paired extraversion with a different factor which would determine relationship and task-orientation. Examples are DISC assessment and social styles. One of the most popular today is the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, attributed to the work of David Keirsey, whose four temperaments were based largely on the Greek gods Apollo, Dionysus, Epimetheus, and Prometheus, and were mapped to the 16 types of the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). They were renamed as Artisan (SP), Guardian (SJ), Idealist (NF), and Rational (NT). C.G. Jung&#x27;s &quot;Psychological Types&quot; surveys the historical literature of the &#x27;four humors&#x27; and related discussions extensively and in depth and proposes a psychoanalytic integration of the material.

== Modern views, implementations and restatements ==
Waldorf education and anthroposophy believe that the temperaments help to understand personality. They also believe that they are useful for education, helping teachers understand how children learn. Christian writer Tim LaHaye has attempted to repopularize the ancient temperaments through his books.

James David Barber developed &quot;The Presidential Character&quot;, wherein active relates to hot, passive relates to cold, positive relates to moist, and negative relates to dry. If one were to make a Punnett square of these characters, one can find an Active–Positive, Passive–Positive, Active–Negative, or Passive–Negative individual. This diagram was made after an influential study of the U.S. presidency, hence the name.

Robert R. Blake created &quot;The Managerial Grid&quot;, wherein high concern for production relates to hot, low concern for production relates to cold, high concern for people relates to moist, and low concern for people relates to dry. If one were to make the same Punnett square of these characters, one can find a Team Management, a Country Club Management, a Task Management, or an Ineffective Management individual.

The National Christian Counselors Association of Richard and Phyllis Arno, licensed the FIRO-B istrument in the 1980&#x27;s, and derived from it a theory of five temperaments, where the classical phlegmatic temperament is deemed to be a neutral temperament, whereas the &quot;relationship-oriented introvert&quot; position traditionally held by the phlegmatic is declared to be a new &quot;fifth temperament&quot; called &quot;Supine&quot; (meaning &quot;lying on the back&quot;). This instrument is used by many Christian ministries
== Usage ==
The 18th-century classical composer Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach composed a trio sonata in C minor known as &quot;Sanguineus et Melancholicus&quot; (Wq 161/1). In the 20th century, Carl Nielsen&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (Op.16) is subtitled &quot;The Four Temperaments&quot;, each of the four movements being inspired by a sketch of a particular temperament. Paul Hindemith&#x27;s Theme and Four Variations for string orchestra and piano is also known as &quot;The Four Temperaments&quot;: although originally conceived as a ballet for Léonide Massine, the score was ultimately completed as a commission for George Balanchine, who subsequently choreographed it as a neoclassical ballet, using the theory of the temperaments as a point of departure.

The 19th-century French author Émile Zola used the four temperaments as a basis for his novel &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot;.

<text>John Banim (3 April 1798 – 30 August 1842), was an Irish novelist, short story writer, dramatist, poet and essayist, sometimes called the &quot;Scott of Ireland.&quot; He also studied art, working as a painter of miniatures and portraits, and as a drawing teacher, before dedicating himself to literature.

==Early life==
John Banim was born in Kilkenny, Ireland. His father was a farmer and shopkeeper. At age four, his parents sent him to a local dame schools where he learned the basics of reading and grammar. At age five, Banim was sent to the English Academy at Kilkenny where his older brother Michael (1796–1874) was a student. This school is described in Michael Banim&#x27;s novel &quot;Father Connell&quot;. It is believed to have been situated in Rothe House. After five years at the English Academy, John Banim was sent to a seminary run by a Reverent Magrath, considered to be the finest Roman Catholic school in Ireland. After a year at the seminary, Banim transferred to another academy run by a teacher named Terence Doyle.

Throughout his school years, Banim read avidly and wrote his own stories and poems. As a boy, he invented a birthday tradition where he would gather all of his writings from the previous year, re-read them critically, and then burn the ones he found lacking. When he was ten, Banim visited the poet Thomas Moore, bringing along some of his own poetry in manuscript. Moore encouraged Banim to continue writing and gave him a season ticket to his private theatre in Kilkenny, where Moore himself was performing at the time.

At age 13, Banim entered Kilkenny College, where he devoted himself specially to drawing and miniature painting. He pursued his artistic education for two years in the schools of the Royal Dublin Society, and afterwards taught drawing in Kilkenny. The 18-year-old Banim soon fell in love with one of his pupils, a 17-year-old girl named Anne. However, the girl&#x27;s parents disapproved of their relationship and sent her out of town. Anne died two months later of tuberculosis. Her death made a deep impression on Banim, who himself contracted spinal tuberculosis.

==Career==
===Dublin===
After about a year and a half of recovery and lack of direction, Banim started painting portraits and started contributing stories to the Leinster Gazette. He soon became the paper&#x27;s editor.

In 1820, Banim moved to Dublin after deciding to pursue his writing. In Dublin, he connected with an old student friend, the artist Thomas J. Mulvaney, who aided and advised him. At this time, the Dublin artists where trying to obtain a Charter of Incorporation and a government grant. Banim had been contributing to several Dublin newspapers and used his position to help strengthen the artists&#x27;s claim. In 1820, the artists were granted their charter, and they gave an address and a considerable sum of money to Banim for his support. Much of Banim&#x27;s money went to paying off his debts.

Banim became friends with the writer Charles Phillips, who helped Banim with his writing. Banim had thought of going to London, but Phillips convinced him to stay in Dublin. Phillips advised Banim on his poetry and showed his early poem &quot;Ossian&#x27;s Paradise&quot; to several publishers; it was published in 1821 as &quot;The Celt&#x27;s Paradise&quot;.

While still in manuscript, the poem had been shown to Sir Walter Scott, who enjoyed reading it. After the publication of &quot;The Celt&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, Banim focused on writing a classical tragedy. Banim&#x27;s play &quot;Damon and Pythias&quot; was performed at Covent Garden on 28 May 1821, with William Macready as &quot;Damon&quot; and Charles Kemble as &quot;Pythias&quot;. It was later performed at the Theatre Royal, Dublin.

In 1821, Banim visited Kilkenny to pay the last of his debts. During his visit he discussed his future plans for novels and stories with his brother Michael. While in Kilkenny, he lodged in the home of a close friend of his father, a man named John Ruth. He spent his days in the company of his brother and of John Ruth&#x27;s three daughters. In a few weeks, Banim fell in love with the youngest daughter, Ellen Ruth. Before asking her to marry him, Banim returned to Dublin to take care of his affairs. He returned to Kilkenny in February 1822, and, after a courtship of five months, he and Ellen were married.

In 1822, he planned, in conjunction with Michael, a series of tales illustrative of Irish life, which should be for Ireland what the Waverley Novels were for Scotland; the influence of his model is distinctly traceable in his writings. Another influence were the tales of everyday life by John Galt.

===London===
He then set out for London, where he supported himself and his wife by writing for magazines and for the stage. Their first residence was at No. 7, Amelia Place, Brompton, the former home of John Philpot Curran. Towards the end of 1822 his wife fell ill, and in November gave birth to a stillborn child. Her illness required John to do more work to meet the costs of her treatment. In 1823 John&#x27;s own earlier illness returned. He was sick for several months before recovering, his finances, by that time, greatly diminished.

Unable to do much work for the weekly papers because of his illness, he began doing more work for monthly periodicals. This allowed him the time to do more carefully written and serious work. He also wrote librettos for Thomas Arne of the English Opera House. Around this time he was visited by the writer Gerald Griffin, new to London, and in need of guidance. Banim befriended Griffin and did everything he could to assist him, helping to edit his plays and to have them submitted for production. Griffin said the following of Banim in a letter:&quot;What would I have done if I had not found Banim? I should never be tired of talking about and thinking of Banim. Mark me! he is a man – the only one I have met since I left Ireland, almost.&quot;

Banim published a volume of miscellaneous essays anonymously in 1824, called &quot;Revelations of the Dead Alive&quot;. He met the American author Washington Irving the same year, finding him to be a good hearted and genuine man, while other literary celebrities he had met had disappointed him. The first series of &quot;Tales of the O&#x27;Hara Family&quot; appeared in April 1825, achieving immediate and decided success. One of the most powerful of them, &quot;Crohoore of the Bill Hook&quot;, was by Michael Banim. The two had worked on the &quot;Tales&quot; through correspondence during 1823–24, periodically sending each other their completed work to be read and criticised. Banim and Gerald Griffin were still close friends, despite a misunderstanding that had temporarily parted them, and Griffin was often called upon to offer criticism on the &quot;Tales&quot;.
After the publication of &quot;Tales of the O&#x27;Hara Family&quot;, John began work on his novel &quot;The Boyne Water&quot;, a story of Protestant – Catholic relations during the Williamite War. He travelled back to Ireland, spending time in Derry and Belfast, to do research on the novel, which was published in 1826. That same year, a second series of &quot;Tales of the O&#x27;Hara Family&quot; was published, containing the novel, &quot;The Nowlans&quot;.

Upon visiting John in London, in the summer of 1826, Michael found that his brother&#x27;s illness had aged him and made him appear much older than his 28 years. The next effort of the &quot;O&#x27;Hara family&quot; was almost entirely the production of Michael. &quot;The Croppy, a Tale of 1798&quot; (1828), a novel of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, is hardly equal to the earlier tales, though it contains some wonderfully vigorous passages. &quot;The Mayor of Windgap&quot;, and &quot;The Ghost Hunter&quot; (both by Michael Banim), &quot;The Denounced&quot; (1830) and &quot;The Smuggler&quot; (1831) followed in quick succession, and were received with considerable favour. Most of these deal with the darker and more painful phases of life, but the feeling shown in his last, &quot;Father Connell&quot;, is brighter and more tender.

In 1827, John became friends with the young writer John Sterling. He accompanied Sterling on an excursion to Cambridge, which temporarily restored Banim&#x27;s health. His illness soon returned, along with consequent poverty. He continued to write, and encouraged Michael in his writing of &quot;The Croppy&quot;. In July 1827 John&#x27;s second child, a daughter, was born. In 1828 John&#x27;s novel &quot;The Anglo-Irish of the Nineteenth Century&quot; was published anonymously, but wasn&#x27;t well received by critics or the public.

After another misunderstanding with Gerald Griffin, the two resumed their friendship through correspondence in the middle of 1828. Their friendship was of high importance to both writers, and brought them much satisfaction. During this time John and his wife lived in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where they had moved for the sake of John&#x27;s health, and then Sevenoaks in Kent. In 1829 they moved to Blackheath, London for business purposes.

In the Autumn of 1829, he went to France on the recommendation of his doctors. While in France he wrote &quot;The Smuggler&quot;, which went unpublished until 1831 due to a dispute with the publisher. He also submitted a novel called &quot;The Dwarf Bride&quot; for publication, but the manuscript was lost by the publisher. In June 1830 his mother died. John was unable to return to Kilkenny to see her due to his increasingly frail health. The family moved first to Boulogne on medical advice, and then to Paris. He continued to make something of a living contributing to periodicals and writing plays. In 1831 his first son was born. His son&#x27;s birth improved John&#x27;s state of mind after the death of his mother, but it also placed him in deeper financial need. In 1832 he suffered an attack of cholera but survived.

At the end of 1832, his second son was born. Soon after, in January 1833, a movement to relieve his wants was set on foot by the entreaties of Ellen Banim to John&#x27;s literary friends, and then by the English press, headed by John Sterling and his father in The Times. Contributions were also collected in Ireland. A sufficient sum was obtained to remove him from any danger of actual want. Among the contributors were Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey and Sir Robert Peel in England and Samuel Lover in Ireland.

==Later life==
In 1833, he and his wife moved to Paris, in the hope that John would find a doctor who could help him with his condition. He was diagnosed as having an inflammation of the lower spine, and subjected to often excruciating treatments, which provided no relief. The death of his youngest son came early in 1834. He stayed in Paris throughout 1834, doing what writing he was capable of and spending time in the society of the distinguished literary men of the city. His oldest son died at the beginning of 1835, of croup.

While in France, Banim suffered a stroke; in 1835 he returned to Kilkenny by slow stages. He returned to Ireland in July 1835, taking up residence in Dublin. On meeting him again in August, Michael Banim found his condition to be that of a complete invalid. He was often in pain and had to use opiates to sleep, but during the short intervals between the attacks of his illness, he was able to enjoy conversation and the company of his brother and friends. In September he returned to Kilkenny and was received with an address from the citizens of Kilkenny showing their appreciation of him, and a subscription from them of £85. After a short stay in his childhood home, he settled in Windgap Cottage, then a short distance from Kilkenny. He passed the remainder of his life there, dying on 13 August 1842 at the age of forty-four.

==Legacy==
His strength lies in the delineation of the characters of the Irish lower classes, and the impulses, often misguided and criminal, by which they are influenced, and in this he showed remarkable power.

An assessment in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition (1911) reads:
:&quot;The true place of the Banims in literature is to be estimated from the merits of the O&#x27;Hara Tales; their later works, though of considerable ability, are sometimes prolix and are marked by too evident an imitation of the Waverley Novels. The Tales, however, are masterpieces of faithful delineation. The strong passions, the lights and shadows of Irish peasant character, have rarely been so ably and truly depicted. The incidents are striking, sometimes even horrible, and the authors have been accused of straining after melodramatic effect. The lighter, more joyous side of Irish character, which appears so strongly in Samuel Lover, receives little attention from the Banims.&quot;

<text>Glastonbury Tor is a tor near Glastonbury in the English county of Somerset, topped by the roofless St Michael&#x27;s Tower, a Grade I listed building. The site is managed by the National Trust and has been designated a scheduled monument. The Tor is mentioned in Celtic mythology, particularly in myths linked to King Arthur, and has several other enduring mythological and spiritual associations.

The conical hill of clay and Blue Lias rises from the Somerset Levels. It was formed when surrounding softer deposits were eroded, leaving a hard cap of sandstone exposed. The slopes of the hill are terraced, but the method by which they were formed remains unexplained.

Archaeological excavations during the 20th century sought to clarify the background of the monument and church, but some aspects of their history remain unexplained. Artefacts from human visitation have been found, dating from the Iron Age to Roman eras. Several buildings were constructed on the summit during Saxon and early medieval periods; they have been interpreted as an early church and monks&#x27; hermitage. The head of a wheel cross dating from the 10th or 11th century has been recovered. The original wooden church was destroyed by an earthquake in 1275, and the stone Church of St Michael was built on the site in the 14th century. Its tower remains, although it has been restored and partially rebuilt several times.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name &quot;Glastonbury&quot; is unclear, but when the settlement was first recorded in the late 7th and early 8th centuries it was called . Of the latter name, &quot;Glestinga&quot; is obscure and may derive from an Old English word or Celtic personal name. It may derive from a person or kinship group named Glast. The second half of the name, , is Anglo-Saxon in origin and could refer to either a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure.

&quot;Tor&quot; is an English word referring to &quot;a bare rock mass surmounted and surrounded by blocks and boulders&quot;, deriving from the Old English . The Celtic name of the Tor was , or sometimes , meaning &#x27;Isle of Glass&#x27;. At this time the plain was flooded, the isle becoming a peninsula at low tide.

==Location and landscape==
The Tor is in the middle of the Summerland Meadows, part of the Somerset Levels, rising to an elevation of . The plain is reclaimed fen above which the Tor is clearly visible for miles around. It has been described as an island, but actually sits at the western end of a peninsula washed on three sides by the River Brue.

The Tor is formed from rocks dating from the early Jurassic Period, namely varied layers of Lias Group strata. The uppermost of these, forming the Tor itself, are a succession of rocks assigned to the Bridport Sand Formation. These rocks sit upon strata forming the broader hill on which the Tor stands; the various layers of the Beacon Limestone Formation and the Dyrham Formation. The Bridport Sands have acted as a caprock, protecting the lower layers from erosion. 

The iron-rich waters of Chalice Well, a spring at the base of the Tor, flow out as an artesian well impregnating the sandstone around it with iron oxides that have reinforced it to produce the caprock. Iron-rich but oxygen-poor water in the aquifer carries dissolved iron (II) &quot;ferrous&quot; iron, but as the water surfaces and its oxygen content rises, the oxidised iron (III) &quot;ferric&quot; iron drops out as insoluble &quot;rusty&quot; oxides that bind to the surrounding stone, hardening it.

The low-lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana when the Tor appears to rise out of the mist. This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian term &quot;Fata Morgana&quot; is derived from the name of Morgan le Fay, a powerful sorceress in Arthurian legend.

===Terraces===
The sides of the Tor have seven deep, roughly symmetrical terraces, or lynchets. Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations. They may have been formed as a result of natural differentiation of the layers of Lias stone and clay or used by farmers during the Middle Ages as terraced hills to make ploughing for crops easier. Author Nicholas Mann questions this theory. If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces, it would be expected that the effort would be concentrated on the south side, where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield, but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side, which would provide little benefit. Additionally, none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced, even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved.

Other explanations have been suggested for the terraces, including the construction of defensive ramparts. Iron Age hill forts including the nearby Cadbury Castle in Somerset show evidence of extensive fortification of their slopes. The normal form of ramparts is a bank and ditch, but there is no evidence of this arrangement on the Tor. South Cadbury, one of the most extensively fortified places in early Britain, had three concentric rings of banks and ditches supporting an enclosure. By contrast, the Tor has seven rings and very little space on top for the safekeeping of a community. It has been suggested, that a defensive function may have been linked with Ponter&#x27;s Ball Dyke, a linear earthwork about east of the Tor. It consists of an embankment with a ditch on the east side. The purpose and provenance of the dyke are unclear. It is possible that it was part of a longer defensive barrier associated with New Ditch, three miles to the south-west, which is built in a similar manner. It has been suggested by Ralegh Radford that it is part of a great Celtic sanctuary, probably 3rd century BC, while others, including Philip Rahtz, date it to the post-Roman period and link it to the Dark Age occupation on Glastonbury Tor. The 1970 excavation suggests the 12th century or later. The historian Ronald Hutton also mentions the alternative possibility that the terraces are the remains of a medieval &quot;spiral walkway&quot; created for pilgrims to reach the church on the summit, similar to that at Whitby Abbey.

Another suggestion is that the terraces are the remains of a three-dimensional labyrinth, first proposed by Geoffrey Russell in 1968. He states that the classical labyrinth (Caerdroia), a design found all over the Neolithic world, can be easily transposed onto the Tor so that by walking around the terraces a person eventually reaches the top in the same pattern. Evaluating this hypothesis is not easy. A labyrinth would very likely place the terraces in the Neolithic era, but given the amount of occupation since then, there may have been substantial modifications by farmers or monks, and conclusive excavations have not been carried out. In a more recent book, Hutton writes that &quot;the labyrinth does not seem to be an ancient sacred structure&quot;.

==History==
===Pre-Christian===
Some Neolithic flint tools recovered from the top of the Tor show that the site has been visited, perhaps with a lasting occupation, since prehistory. The nearby remains of Glastonbury Lake Village were identified at the site in 1892, which confirmed that there was an Iron Age settlement in about 300–200 BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens. There is no evidence of permanent occupation of the Tor, but finds, including Roman pottery, do suggest that it was visited on a regular basis.

Excavations on Glastonbury Tor, undertaken by a team led by Philip Rahtz between 1964 and 1966, revealed evidence of Dark Age occupation during the 5th to 7th centuries around the later medieval church of St. Michael. Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker&#x27;s forge, two burials oriented north–south (thus unlikely to be Christian), fragments of 6th-century Mediterranean amphorae (vases for wine or cooking oil), and a worn hollow bronze head which may have topped a Saxon staff.

===Christian settlement===
During the late Saxon and early medieval period, there were at least four buildings on the summit. The base of a stone cross demonstrates Christian use of the site during this period, and it may have been a hermitage. The broken head of a wheel cross dated to the 10th or 11th century was found partway down the hill and may have been the head of the cross that stood on the summit. The head of the cross is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton.

The earliest timber church, dedicated to St Michael, is believed to have been constructed in the 11th or 12th century; from which post holes have since been identified. Associated monk cells have also been identified.

In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.

St Michael&#x27;s Church was destroyed by an earthquake on 11 September 1275. According to the British Geological Survey, the earthquake was felt in London, Canterbury and Wales, and was reported to have destroyed many houses and churches in England. The intensity of shaking was greater than 6 on the Richter scale (7 MSK), with its epicentre in the area around Portsmouth or Chichester, South England.

A second church, also dedicated to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating the foundations of the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There was also a portable altar of Purbeck Marble; it is likely that the Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey.

St Michael&#x27;s Church survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 when, except for the tower, it was demolished. The Tor was the place of execution where Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, was hanged, drawn and quartered along with two of his monks, John Thorne and Roger James. The three-storey tower of St Michael&#x27;s Church survives. It has corner buttresses and perpendicular bell openings. There is a sculptured tablet with an image of an eagle below the parapet.

===Post-dissolution===

In 1786, Richard Colt Hoare of Stourhead bought the Tor and funded the repair of the tower in 1804, including the rebuilding of the north-east corner. It was then sold to the Very Rev. Hon. George Neville-Grenville and included in the Butleigh Manor until the 20th century. The last owner of the Tor was Robert Neville-Grenville who wished to give the Tor to the National Trust along with the Glastonbury Tribunal. After his death in 1936 it was sold to The National Trust who raised money by Public Subscription for its upkeep.

The National Trust took control of the Tor in 1937, but repairs were delayed until after the Second World War. During the 1960s, excavations identified cracks in the rock, suggesting the ground had moved in the past. This, combined with wind erosion, started to expose the footings of the tower, which were repaired with concrete. Erosion caused by the feet of the increasing number of visitors was also a problem and paths were laid to enable them to reach the summit without damaging the terraces. After 2000, enhancements to the access and repairs to the tower, including rebuilding of the parapet, were carried out. These included the replacement of some of the masonry damaged by earlier repairs with new stone from the Hadspen Quarry.
A model vaguely based on Glastonbury Tor (albeit with a tree instead of the tower) was incorporated into the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. As the athletes entered the stadium, their flags were displayed on the terraces of the model.

==Mythology and spirituality==
The Tor seems to have been called &quot;Ynys yr Afalon&quot; (meaning &quot;The Isle of Avalon&quot;) by the Britons and is believed by some, including the 12th and 13th century writer Gerald of Wales, to be the Avalon of Arthurian legend. The Tor has been associated with the name Avalon, and identified with King Arthur, since the alleged discovery of his and Queen Guinevere&#x27;s neatly labelled coffins in 1191, recounted by Gerald of Wales. Author Christopher L. Hodapp asserts in his book &quot;The Templar Code for Dummies&quot; that Glastonbury Tor is one of the possible locations of the Holy Grail, because it is close to the monastery that housed the Nanteos Cup.

The Tor has been a place of Christian pilgrimage at least since the 11th-century and continues to be so, both because of the long-standing dedication to St. Michael the Archangel (the patron of many sacred mountains and hills) and more recently because of the martyrdoms of the three beatified Benedictine monks on its summit in the 16th-century Abbot Whiting, John Thorne and Roger James. 

With the 19th-century resurgence of interest in Celtic mythology, the Tor became associated with Gwyn ap Nudd, the first Lord of the Otherworld (Annwn) and later King of the Fairies. The Tor came to be represented as an entrance to Annwn or to Avalon, the land of the fairies. The Tor is supposedly a gateway into &quot;The Land of the Dead (Avalon)&quot;.

A persistent myth of more recent origin is that of the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But the vast majority of the land said by Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.

The Tor and other sites in Glastonbury have also been significant in the modern-day Goddess movement, with the flow from the Chalice Well seen as representing menstrual flow and the Tor being seen as either a breast or the whole figure of the Goddess. This has been celebrated with an effigy of the Goddess leading an annual procession up the Tor.

It is said that Brigid of Kildare is depicted milking a cow as a stone carving above one of the entrances to the tower.

<text>Prince Alexandre de Merode (May 24, 1934 – November 19, 2002) was a member of the Belgian princely House of Merode and was the head of drug testing policy for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) until his death.

Merode was born in Etterbeek, Belgium.

Merode&#x27;s position at the IOC was not without criticism. Following allegations of doping at the 1984 Summer Olympics, samples from suspected drug cheats were never actually tested. The prince claimed that the paperwork was accidentally discarded when the Los Angeles organizing committee converted his temporary office back into a suite immediately after the closing ceremony; however, he has been accused of deliberately destroying the evidence.

Following record-shattering performances by Chinese female swimmers in the 1990s and a doping scandal during the 1998 Tour de France, international sport created the World Anti-Doping Agency, effectively removing control of drug testing from the IOC and Merode.

In 1998, Merode backed up claims that certain athletes were using the controversial abortion doping procedure for performance-enhancing benefits; however, he did not provide any proof.

In May 2000, he tendered his resignation as head of the IOC medical commission; however, he withdrew his resignation when IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch asked him to stay.

He died of lung cancer on November 19, 2002. He never married.

<text>Edward Vincent Bracken (February 7, 1915 – November 14, 2002) was an American actor. Bracken came to Hollywood prominence for his comedic lead performances in the films &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot; and &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot; both from 1944, both of which have been preserved by the National Film Registry. During this era, he also had success on Broadway, with performances in plays like &quot;Too Many Girls&quot; (1940).

Bracken&#x27;s later movie roles include &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983), &quot;Oscar&quot; (1991), &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992), &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; (1993), and &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot; (1994).

==Life and career==

Edward Vincent Bracken was born in Astoria, Queens, New York on February 7, 1915, the son of Joseph L. and Catherine Bracken. Bracken performed in vaudeville at the age of nine and gained fame with the Broadway musical &quot;Too Many Girls&quot; in a role he reprised for the 1940 film adaptation. He had performed in a short film series called &quot;The Kiddie Troupers&quot; (one of many &quot;Our Gang&quot;-like series) prior to that, but that film was his big break. In 1936, Bracken enjoyed success on Broadway with his starring run in the Joseph Viertel play &quot;So Proudly We Hail&quot;. The military drama, co-starring Richard Cromwell, opened to much fanfare but closed after 14 performances at the 46th Street Theatre. 

In the 1940s, director Preston Sturges cast Bracken in two of his films, &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;, opposite Betty Hutton, and &quot;Hail the Conquering Hero&quot;. Due to the popularity of these films, Eddie Bracken was a household name during World War II. He made numerous radio broadcasts and had his own program, &quot;The Eddie Bracken Show&quot;.

In 1953, Bracken left Hollywood. He appeared on Broadway in &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot;; &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;; &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;; and &quot;Sugar Babies&quot;. His last appearance on Broadway was in the musical &quot;Dreamtime&quot;, directed by David Niles at the Ed Sullivan Theater, at the age of 77.

Bracken&#x27;s television roles between 1952 and 2000 include an episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; as Rose Nylund&#x27;s ex-childhood boyfriend from St. Olaf, as well as an episode of &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; playing a stubborn old man who refuses to believe that he has died. After nearly 30 years out of feature films, he returned to perform character roles, including the sympathetic &quot;Walley World&quot; theme park founder Mr. Roy Walley in &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Vacation&quot; (1983) and Duncan&#x27;s Toy Chest toy store owner Mr. Duncan in &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; (1992). Bracken also had a long career with Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey, starring in dozens of productions in the 1980s–early 2000s. One high point was their production of &quot;Show Boat&quot; in which he played Captain Andy Hawkes. This production was broadcast on PBS in 1990. He also played a cameo in Patrick Read Johnson&#x27;s 1994 film, &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, as one of the veterans in the old soldier&#x27;s home.

Bracken acted in films with two actors who later became U.S. Presidents: Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. He co-starred in &quot;The Girl from Jones Beach&quot; with Reagan in 1949, and Trump played a minor part in &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; in 1992.

Bracken campaigned for Republican Thomas E. Dewey during the 1944 U.S. presidential election campaign.

===Death===
On November 14, 2002, Bracken died in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, of complications from surgery for a crushed disk in his neck at the age of 87. His wife of 63 years, Connie Nickerson, a former actress, died in August 2002, just three months before his death. He met Connie when they performed together in a road company of the Broadway play &quot;What a Life&quot; in 1938. Together Eddie and Connie had five children: two sons (Michael and David) and three daughters (Judy, Carolyn and Susan).

===Hollywood Walk of Fame===
For his contributions to radio and television, Bracken has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, at 1651 Vine Street and 6751 Hollywood Boulevard respectively.

<text>Batley is a market town in the Kirklees district, in West Yorkshire, England, south-west of Leeds, north-west of Wakefield and Dewsbury, south-east of Bradford and north-east of Huddersfield, in the Heavy Woollen District. In 2011, the population was 48,730.

Batley Town Hall, designed in the neoclassical style, was paid for by public subscription and opened as the local mechanics&#x27; institute in 1854. The town was the home of Batley Variety Club, which was frequented by many notable musical acts, from 1967 onwards.

==History==

=== Middle Ages ===
Batley is recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &#x27;Bateleia&#x27;. After the Norman conquest, the manor was granted to Elbert de Lacy and in 1086 was within the wapentake of Morley. It subsequently passed into the ownership of the de Batleys, and by the 12th century had passed by marriage to the Copley family. Their residence at Batley Hall was held directly from the Crown; at this time the district was part of the Duchy of Lancaster. 

There has been a church in Batley since the 11th century. Batley Parish Church was built in 1485 and contains parts of a 13th-century predecessor. Despite Batley being an ancient settlement, this is all that remains of any great antiquity.

Howley Hall in Soothill was built during the 1580s by Sir John Savile, a member of the great Yorkshire landowners, the Savile family. The house was besieged during the English Civil War in 1643 before the Battle of Adwalton Moor but appears to have sustained no serious damage. It continued to be occupied during the 17th century but fell into disrepair. Howley Hall was destroyed in 1730. Among the numerous ruins that are still present are the cellars of its great hall.

Methodism came to Batley in the 1740s through the evangelism of John Nelson, a lay preacher from Birstall and frequent companion of the movement&#x27;s founder John Wesley. Two leading figures in the early Methodist movement, John William Fletcher and Mary Bosanquet, were married at All Saints Church in Batley in 1781. By the 1780s meetings were being held in the town and the first Methodist chapel was established around 1800.

=== Industrial Revolution ===
During the late 18th century, the main occupations in the town were farming and weaving. The Industrial Revolution reached Batley in 1796 with the arrival of its first water powered mills for carding and spinning. During the next half century the population grew rapidly, from around 2,500 at the start of the 19th century to 9,308 at the 1851 census. The parish of Batley at this point included Morley, Churwell and Gildersome, with a total population of 17,359.

Before the industrial revolution, wool was made in Batley for centuries as a cottage industry. Samuel Jubb, a 19th-century mill owner and local historian, noted that this was &quot;a manufacture for which the place is well adapted, on account of its possessing a good supply of water and coal, and its central situation in relation to the principal local markets, being about equidistant from Leeds, Huddersfield, Bradford, Halifax, and Wakefield.&quot; The water he referred to was not the beck but the large aquifer beneath the town, which was tapped for cleaning and dying wool.

A toll road built in 1832 between Gomersal and Dewsbury had a branch to Batley (the present day Branch Road) which allowed for &quot;the growing volumes of wool, cloth and coal&quot; to be transported. Until then there had only been foot and cart tracks. Around the same time there were strikes in the mills, which led to an influx of Irish workers who settled permanently. Initially this led to antagonism from residents, due to the lower wages paid to the Irish workers and general anti-Roman Catholic sentiment, but this faded in time. By 1853 Catholic services were held regularly in the town; its first Roman Catholic church, St Mary of the Angels, was not built until 1870 and is still in existence.

By 1848 there was a railway station in Batley, and in 1853 Batley Town Hall was erected. It was enlarged in 1905, and is in the Neoclassical style, with a corbelled parapet and pilasters rising to a centre pediment. In 1868 Batley was incorporated as a municipal borough, the former urban district of Birstall was added to it in 1937.

1853 also saw the establishment of a small confectionery shop by Michael Spedding. His business expanded, moving to larger premises in 1927 becoming Fox&#x27;s Biscuits. Today, along with Tesco, it is one of the largest employers in the town.

During the late 19th century, Batley was the centre of the shoddy and mungo trade in which wool, rags and clothes were recycled by reweaving them into blankets, carpets and uniforms. In 1861 there were at least 30 shoddy mills in Batley. The owners of the recycling businesses were known as the &quot;shoddy barons&quot;. There was a &quot;shoddy king&quot; and a &quot;shoddy temple&quot;, properly known as the Zion Chapel. This imposing building in the town centre was opened in 1870, and reflected the popularity of the Methodist movement. The chapel is still active today. In 1875 local woman Ann Ellis led a weavers strike against the shoddy mill owners who were planning to reduce wages.

At the close of the 19th century, growth in population changed the form of governmental institutions above the parish of Batley; the Morley division of the wapentake of Agbrigg and Morley was disused as special purpose districts were formed.

The library was built in 1907 with funds donated by the philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. The library has been modernised, with a microfilm viewer, and reels of the Batley News dating back 120 years. The newspaper was founded by James Fearnsides – a local printer. His grandson, Clement, later became the mayor of Batley. The first records of coal mining in Batley date back to the 16th century at White Lee; the last pit in the town closed in 1973.

=== Post-industrial history ===
On the nights of 14 and 15 March 1941, the West Yorkshire area as a whole was subject to a Nazi air raid. Batley came through relatively unscathed with one unexploded ordnance being located near the Healey Mill area (opposite Healey Community Centre to be precise) whilst Cleckheaton, located north-west, suffered from seven bombs that exploded as intended. Leeds, located north-east, went through two nights of damage as, &quot;The raid caused more than 100 serious fires, damaged over 4,500 buildings and resulted in 65 people losing their lives.&quot;

The manufacture of shoddy continued into the postwar period. A doctor posted to Batley hospital in 1952 described the town as &quot;one of the last reminders of the industrial revolution as described by Dickens&quot;, riven by economic inequality and &#x27;Victorian&#x27; diseases like rickets:

In 1974, responsibility for local government passed to Kirklees Metropolitan Council, with its headquarters in Huddersfield.

=== 21st century ===
Batley&#x27;s Labour MP Jo Cox was shot and stabbed to death outside her constituency surgery in Birstall in June 2016. The politically-motivated murder, carried out by a local man in the name of white supremacy, was the first assassination of a sitting British MP since 1990. Her seat was filled by Labour candidate Tracy Brabin in a by-election later the same year, uncontested by the other major parties.

Brabin was elected the first Mayor of West Yorkshire in 2021, triggering a high profile by-election in which Labour expected to struggle to retain the formerly safe red wall seat. Former Labour MP George Galloway ran for the Workers Party of Britain, on a platform criticising newly-elected Labour leader Keir Starmer and targetting issues important to the local South Asian Muslim community. Labour candidate Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Jo Cox, ultimately won the election by a narrow margin, following a campaign focused on local issues. The governing Conservative&#x27;s surprise loss was blamed on poor campaigning and a scandal involving Health Secretary Matt Hancock in the weekend prior to the by-election. In the 2024 general election, Labour lost the new Dewsbury and Batley constituency to Iqbal Mohamed, who was one of four independent candidates who won seats in heavily Muslim areas largely due to Labour&#x27;s stance on the war in Gaza.

==Demography==

From the end of the 1950s, the need for cheap labour in the town&#x27;s textile industries drew in migrant labourers from Gujarat, Punjab, Pakistan and India. The South Asian population of Batley is now around 33% in Batley West and 54% in Batley East.

==Geography==
Batley includes the districts of Batley Carr, Carlinghow, Cross Bank, Hanging Heaton, Healey, Lamplands, Carlton Grange Mount Pleasant, Soothill, Staincliffe, Upper Batley and White Lee.

As Batley shares boundaries with both Dewsbury and Heckmondwike, parts of Batley Carr, Hanging Heaton and Staincliffe are part of Dewsbury, while part of White Lee is in Heckmondwike. There is an area of Ossett known as Healey, which is identical in name to the Batley district of Healey; the Ossett area is sometimes referred to as &quot;Healey Mills&quot; due to the very large congregation of mills that once existed in that area.

==Transport==

Batley bus station serves the town and is owned and maintained by West Yorkshire Metro. It is situated in Batley town centre and can be accessed from Bradford Road and St. James&#x27;s Street. It was re-built by Metro in April 2005 replacing the previously owned Arriva Yorkshire site. There are six stands and a real-time information board at the bus station. Arriva Yorkshire is the main operator.

Batley railway station is on the Huddersfield line between Leeds and Manchester.

==Culture==

Wilton Park (Batley Park) is a large park between the town centre and Birstall. In its grounds are the Milner K. Ford Observatory (built in 1966 and home to the Batley &amp; Spenborough Astronomical Society) and Bagshaw Museum. The museum is located in a house built by the &quot;shoddy baron&quot;, George Sheard, and features local history, natural history, curios from around the world, and an Ancient Egyptian exhibition. The museum (originally the Wilton Park Museum) is named after its first curator Walter Bagshaw, a Batley councillor and extensive traveller.

The Yorkshire Motor Museum had a small but varied collection of cars dating back to 1885, and reflecting local car makers as well as more famous marques. The museum closed in 2010.

Batley Art Gallery, in the Batley Library building, features contemporary art, craft and photography.

Between 1966 and 1977 the Batley Variety Club was frequented by many notable acts including Louis Armstrong, Johnny Mathis, Eartha Kitt, the Bee Gees, Roy Orbison, the Hollies and Cliff Richard among others. For a brief period it was named &quot;Crumpets&quot;, after which it was closed for four years surviving numerous applications to have the building demolished. The club was then known as the Frontier nightclub from the late 1970s onwards. The Frontier was sold to businessmen in April 2005 and continued to operate as a nightclub whilst hosting variety shows and sporting events such as boxing, snooker and darts. The Frontier closed its doors for the final time in 2016 and following a £2 million refurbishment was successfully transformed into JD gym.

A dramatic society was founded in October 1913 at Shelton&#x27;s café at 53 Commercial Street to present dramatic works to raise funds for Batley and District Hospital. On 8 January 1914 at a meeting in the Temperance Hall, it was decided that it would be known as the “Batley Amateur Thespian Society” and it became affiliated with the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.

==In popular culture==

Batley was used for location filming of the fictional town of Barfield in the 1955 film &quot;Value for Money&quot;, starring John Gregson and Diana Dors. &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; had a series of recurring sketches in which the members of the Batley Ladies Townswomen&#x27;s Guild would present famous plays or musicals, or re-enact various historical battles (such as the Battle of Pearl Harbor), by charging at each other, swinging handbags and wrestling in the mud.

<doc id="149738" wikidata="Q7810332" url="?curid=149738" title="Titus Salt">
<text>Sir Titus Salt, 1st Baronet (20 September 1803 – 29 December 1876) was an English manufacturer, politician and philanthropist in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, who is best known for having built Salt&#x27;s Mill, a large textile mill, together with the attached village of Saltaire, West Yorkshire.

==Early life==
Titus Salt was born in 1803 to Daniel Salt, a drysalter, and Grace Smithies, daughter of Isaac Smithies, of Old Manor House, Morley where the Salt family were to live. Titus attended a local dame school and then Batley Grammar School. In 1813, the Salt family moved to a farm at Crofton near Wakefield and Daniel became a sheep farmer. Titus attended “the day school connected with Salem Chapel” in Wakefield and later, the grammar school.

Titus made a long-standing friend at the day school - his teacher, Enoch Harrison. In 1853, Harrison was a guest at Salt&#x27;s Mill&#x27;s opening banquet on Salt&#x27;s 50th birthday.

==Career==
Salt&#x27;s first job was as a wool-stapler in Wakefield but the family moved to Bradford in 1820, bringing that post to a close. Whilst father Daniel set up as a dealer in wool, Titus spent two years learning about textile manufacture at William Rouse and Sons before joining his father&#x27;s company which traded in Russian Donskoi wool amongst others. Donskoi was widely used in the woollens trade but not in the manufacture of worsted cloth. Titus encouraged the Bradford spinners to use Donskoi in worsted manufacture, with no success. So father and son decided to utilise it themselves and set up as spinner and manufacturer. The experiment was a success.

Between 1833 and 1835, the Salt business changed significantly. Daniel retired; Titus&#x27;s brother Edward joined; Titus struck out on his own; and the family partnership was dissolved.

During this same period, Titus embarked on experiments with alpaca wool from Peru. The first documentary record of Salt encountering the wool is in his Day Book. On 27 June 1835, Salt recorded one bag of “Peruvian wool”.

The story of Salt&#x27;s discovery of the fibre is well known, not least because it was published by Charles Dickens in a slightly fictionalised form in the magazine &quot;Household Words&quot;. Salt came upon bales of alpaca wool in a warehouse in Liverpool and, after taking some samples away to experiment, came back and bought the consignment. According to Balgarnie, his friend and biographer, the tale is substantially true.

Though he was not the first in England to work with the fibre, he was the creator of the lustrous and subsequently fashionable cloth called &#x27;alpaca&#x27;. It was this that transformed Salt from successful young businessman to the largest employer in Bradford. 

Around 1850, he decided to build a mill large enough to consolidate his textile manufacture in one place. However, he &quot;did not like to be a party to increasing that already over-crowded borough [Bradford]&quot; and bought land three miles from Bradford, in Shipley, next to the River Aire, the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Midland Railway. In 1851, the construction of the factory began. Saltaire Mills, now known as Salt&#x27;s Mill, opened with that grand banquet, on his 50th birthday, 20 September 1853. The construction of the village of Saltaire, with its houses, almshouses, shops, schools, an infirmary, a club and institute, baths and washhouses, started in the following year. In 1858–59, he built the congregational church, now Saltaire United Reformed Church, later donating land on which the Wesleyan chapel was built by public subscription in 1866–68.

Famously, he forbade &#x27;beershops&#x27; in Saltaire, but the common supposition that he was teetotal himself is untrue.

Salt was a private man and left no written statement of his purposes in creating Saltaire, but he told Lord Harewood at the opening of Salt&#x27;s Mill that he had built the place &quot;to do good and to give his sons employment&quot;.
In David James&#x27;s assessment:
&quot;Salt&#x27;s motives in building Saltaire remain obscure. They seem to have been a mixture of sound economics, Christian duty, and a desire to have effective control over his workforce. There were economic reasons for moving out of Bradford, and the village did provide him with an amenable, handpicked workforce. Yet Salt was deeply religious and sincerely believed that, by creating an environment where people could lead healthy, virtuous, godly lives, he was doing God&#x27;s work. Perhaps, also, diffident and inarticulate as he was, the village may have been a way of demonstrating the extent of his wealth and power. Lastly, he may also have seen it as a means of establishing an industrial dynasty to match the landed estates of his Bradford contemporaries. However, Saltaire provided no real solution to the relationship between employer and worker. Its small size, healthy site, and comparative isolation provided an escape rather than an answer to the problems of urban industrial society&quot;.

Saltaire was named alongside Hyde, Egerton (then Turton), Tottington (Bury), Bollington, Holbeck (Leeds), Belper and Copley as an example of workers&#x27; colonies built by British rural factory owners in the Austrian economist Emil Sax&#x27;s 1869 book &quot;Die Wohnungszustände der arbeitenden Classen und ihre Reform&quot;. Sax reported that &quot;the employers&#x27; main motive for building dwellings for their workers&quot; was to increase their productivity by shortening their walking commute, and construed the projects as &quot;housing reform&quot;. In &quot;The Housing Question&quot;, Friedrich Engels objected to this view and explained that the colonies constituted a &quot;cottage system&quot; in which the employers doubled as landlords, and could thereby impose monopoly prices and prevent strikes with the threat of eviction. On these grounds, he commented, &quot;for factory production in the rural districts expenditure on workers&#x27; dwellings was a necessary part of the total investment of capital, and a very profitable one, both directly and indirectly&quot;.

==Public life==
Titus was a politically active and conscientious citizen, arguing for change and financially supporting it. In the 1830s, both Daniel and Titus were founders of the Bradford Reform Society. In 1838, he made a gift to the Bradford Mechanics Hall Building Fund, signalling his support for the education of working people and, in 1842, in response to pollution, he installed Rodda Smoke Burners in the chimneys of his mills. As mayor of Bradford, he tried to persuade the council to require all of the town&#x27;s factory owners to install them, but he was unsuccessful.

He occupied many public positions. Before Bradford&#x27;s incorporation as a borough, he was elected as Constable on two consecutive years. At incorporation in 1847, he was elected as a senior alderman. He became the second Mayor of Bradford, in office from 1848 to 1849, and was one of the first borough magistrates. In 1857, Salt was President of the Bradford Chamber of Commerce. Later, he was Deputy Lieutenant for the West Riding of Yorkshire and appointed to the Riding&#x27;s Commission of the Peace.

From 1859 until he retired through ill health on 1 February 1861, Salt served as Liberal Member of Parliament for Bradford. At the 1859 hustings which would choose him as the party&#x27;s candidate, Salt spoke of the political positions he had taken in his life: &quot;Mr. Salt then came forward and said he had always been of the opinion that the intelligent working classes were entitled to the exercise of the franchise. He need not tell them that he had advocated all the great questions relating to the liberties of the people - amongst others, the Catholic Emancipation Bill, and the Repeal of the Corn Laws, which he supported from first to last. In fact, he had ever supported all measures for the extension of freedom, whether civil, commercial, or religious. He would, if returned to parliament, support Lord John Russell&#x27;s Reform Bill, as a practical measure . He was an advocate of peace; of non-interference in European politics. He believed the ballot was necessary for the protection of the working classes who possessed votes&quot;. 

After he agreed to exhibit at the 1867 Paris Exposition, Salt was awarded the French Légion d&#x27;honneur for his exemplary philanthropic approach to business in founding Saltaire. On 30 October 1869, he was created a Baronet, of Saltaire and Crow Nest in the County of York.

==Philanthropy==
&quot;One of the most celebrated traits of Sir Titus Salt was his philanthropy&quot;, say Barlo and Shaw. They list many of his gifts and estimate that the total value was &quot;approx.£139,000&quot;. However, they warn that their list &quot;should not be regarded as complete&quot; and a new study has confirmed this caution. It identifies a total of 269 gifts with an original value of nearly £170,000 and says that “At today&#x27;s prices, this represents more than £16,000,000”.

Most of Salts&#x27; gifts benefitted the Bradford area but Hull, Scarborough and Grimsby feature along with places many hundred miles from northern England. In 1867, Salt provided the funds to pay for the first Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat to be stationed at Stromness, Orkney. The boat was duly named &quot;Saltaire&quot;.

Several gifts benefitted people from outside Britain. For example “sufferers of a fire in Hamburg” in 1842; “Hungarian refugees” in 1850; and the “sick and wounded of the armies of the two Nations engaged in war on the Continent” in 1870.

==Personal life and death==
On 21 August 1830, Salt married Caroline, daughter of George Whitlam, of Great Grimsby. They had eleven children, six sons and five daughters. The children all have a street named after them in Saltaire.
* William Henry Salt born 5 December 1831
* George Salt born 22 April 1833 
* Amelia Salt born 29 November 1835
* Edward Salt born 3 April 1837
* Herbert Salt born 17 April 1840
* Fanny Caroline Salt born 7 August 1841 died aged 19 on 4 August 1861
* Titus Salt, commonly known as Titus Salt Jr, born 28 August 1843
* Whitlam Salt born 20 October 1846 died 5 April 1851 aged 4
* Mary Salt born 30 April 1849 died 14 May 1851 aged 2
* Helen Salt born 19 June 1852
* Ada Salt born 18 November 1853
In 1876 Salt died at his home, Crow Nest, Lightcliffe, near Halifax. &quot;Estimates vary, but the number of people lining the route [of the funeral cortege, from Lightcliffe to Bradford to Saltaire] probably exceeded 100,000.&quot;

Salt was buried at Saltaire Congregational Church as were his wife and many of his children.

<text>Bingley is a market town and civil parish in the metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. It is sited on the River Aire and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The town had a population of 18,040 at the 2021 Census.

==History==
In 1775, a farmer near Bingley discovered a chest of silver coins, of which some dated to the rule of Julius Caesar, on his land.

===Founding===
Bingley was likely founded by the Saxons, by a ford on the River Aire. This crossing gave access to Harden, Cullingworth and Wilsden on the southern side of the river.
The origins of the name are from the Old English personal name &quot;Bynna&quot; + &quot;ingas&quot; (&quot;descendants of&quot;) + &quot;lēah&quot; (&quot;clearing in a forest&quot;). Altogether, this would mean the &quot;wood or clearing of the Bynningas, the people called after Bynna&quot;.

===Normans===
In the Domesday Book of 1086, Bingley is listed as &quot;Bingheleia&quot;:

&quot;m In Bingheleia hb. Gospatric iiij car&#x27; tra e&#x27; ad gld. tra ad ii car&#x27; Ernegis de burun h&#x27;t. &amp; Wast&#x27; e&#x27;. T.R.E. val, iiij lib&#x27;. Silva past&#x27; ii leu&#x27; lg&#x27; &amp; i lat&#x27;. Tot&#x27; m&#x27; e iiij leu&#x27; lg&#x27; &amp; ii lat&quot;&#x27;

which roughly translated reads:

In Bingheleia, Gospatric has a manor of four carucate of land to be taxed, land for two ploughs. Ernegis de Burun has it and it is waste. In the time of King Edward the Confessor it was valued at four pounds. Woodland pasture two leagues long and one broad. All the manor is four long and two broad.

===Medieval===
The ford was superseded by Ireland Bridge. Bingley was a manor which extended several miles up and down the Aire valley, extending upstream to Marley on the outskirts of Keighley and downstream to Cottingley. Bingley became a market town with the grant of a Market Charter in 1212 by King John.

According to the poll tax returns of 1379, Bingley had 130 households, and probably around 500 people. The nearby towns of Bradford, Leeds and Halifax had about half this population. Therefore, at this time Bingley was the largest town in the area.

No records tell of how Bingley fared in the Black Death that swept Europe in the 14th century. Approximately one third of all the people in Europe died of this plague, sometimes wiping out whole towns and villages. According to the 1379 Poll tax records, the nearby town of Boulton had no survivors worth taxing.

===Tudors===
In 1592, Bingley was shown on a map by Yorkshire map-maker Christopher Saxton as a single street with about 20 houses on each side. The church sits at the west end of the street opposite a single large house, possibly a manor house. Since Bingley was a market town, the market stalls would have been set up on either side of the main street. One of the oldest buildings in Bingley is a coaching inn, the Old White Horse Inn, on the flatter north bank of the River Aire by Ireland Bridge.

===Industrial Revolution===
Like many towns in the West Riding, Bingley prospered during the Industrial Revolution. The Bingley section of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was completed in 1774, linking the town with Skipton, and Bradford via the Bradford Canal. The canal passes through the town centre and ascends the side of the valley via the Bingley Five Rise and Bingley Three Rise Locks. Several woollen and worsted mills were built and people migrated from the surrounding countryside to work in them. Many came from further afield such as Ireland in the wake of the Great Famine. A railway and line goods yard were constructed bringing further trade. The villages of Gilstead and Eldwick became conurbated with Bingley. The Bingley Building Society was also founded in this period.


===Post-industrial===
Bingley Teacher Training College opened in 1911 with Helen Wodehouse as principal. The first intake of students was 102 women from in and around the then West Riding of Yorkshire. Before its closure in 1979, the college produced approximately 16,000 teachers.

The Beeching Axe demolished the goods yard, although the station still has trains to Leeds, Bradford, Skipton, Morecambe and Carlisle. The textile mills have largely been closed. The Damart mill still stands and trades in textiles. Since 1995 the tannery, Bingley Mill &amp; Andertons, have been converted into flats. The most cramped and outdated terraced housing was partly replaced with council housing, Bingley Arts Centre and the headquarters of the Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society. Further council housing was built up the hill towards Gilstead including three tower blocks, which were later demolished in 2020. In the wake of Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s reforms of council housing much of the council estate was sold and a substantial portion has been knocked down and rebuilt as private housing. The Bingley Permanent Building Society merged with the Bradford Equitable Building Society to form the Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society in 1964. It was decided to site the corporate headquarters in Bingley. This brought several thousand jobs to the town, but the building itself did not meet with universal acclaim and was demolished in 2015. The Bradford and Bingley collapsed in the 2008 credit crunch.

=== Criminal ===
Bingley&#x27;s most infamous son is Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who was convicted of the murders of 13 women and the attempted murder of seven others.

Mark Rowntree, a spree killer, started his murderous campaign in Bingley before moving on to Eastburn and Leeds. He was convicted in 1976 of four murders.

In 1966, bookie Fred Craven was brutally murdered in his betting shop on Wellington Street, Bingley. Craven, who was well known in the area because of his short stature (he was 4 ft 7in tall), had gone into his shop to collect papers despite there being no racing that day. It is believed that he had £200 in his wallet (£3,200.00 in 2015 prices) which went missing. Mr Craven suffered extensive injuries at the hands of the killer. Because the local constabulary had a very narrow time frame for the murder, and the fact the killer must have been covered in blood, they anticipated a quick arrest. The Craven murder remains unsolved, but rumours that Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, was responsible for his murder resurfaced in 2017. ITV Calendar News asked Sutcliffe about Craven&#x27;s death and also that of a taxi driver on Bingley Moor. In what was described as a &quot;bizarre letter&quot;, Sutcliffe responded that he was not responsible for either crime to presenter Christine Talbot.

== Road history ==
The main road through Bingley has been re-sited twice in its history. In 1904, a new cut of the road heading north west out of the town created a mini-bypass between All Saints Parish Church and the Railway. The cobbled road around the front of the church became Old Main Street. A huge section of the graveyard was taken out to lay the new road and the gravestones were used as flags on the paths around the church. A small section of the graveyard still exists on the east side of the new road bounded by the old path to Treacle Cock Alley and the railway.

Plans had been on the table for a trunk road through Bingley and the Aire valley since at least 1970. In 1992 preparatory work was undertaken to lengthen Park Road bridge so that the Leeds Liverpool Canal could be moved slightly to the east. This work would allow the formation of the new road to be sandwiched between the railway and the canal. In 1998, the Government, gave the go ahead for the trunk road to be constructed.

===Post-relief road Bingley===

In 2004, the Bingley Relief Road opened. The £47.9 million road stretches from Crossflatts to Cottingley, threading through Bingley between the railway and the canal. One of the most expensive parts of the construction was moving a stretch of the canal. The construction involved the removal of Treacle Cock Alley pedestrian tunnel and the Tin Bridge, which have been replaced by the Three Rise Bridge, and the Britannia Bridge

In 2004, the average home price in Bingley rose 30% to £196,850 – the second fastest appreciating area in the UK (after the nearby Hebden Bridge).

The road was a target of road protest camp where protesters occupied tree houses for nearly two years.

==Governance==

Bingley was part of the Wapentake of Skyrack, which was in turn part of the West Riding of Yorkshire. The ancient parish of Bingley included the chapelry of Morton and several other hamlets, including Cullingworth. In 1866, the parish was divided into the new civil parishes of Bingley and Morton. In 1898, Bingley Urban District was formed; by 1926, all council administration had been transferred to Myrtle Grove which became the town hall. In 1974 the urban district and civil parish were abolished and absorbed into the City of Bradford Metropolitan District in the new county of West Yorkshire. Bingley became a ward in the Bradford metropolitan district. A civil parish called Bingley Town Council was established on 1 April 2016 following a petition to Bradford Council in October 2015. This followed a two-year campaign by the Bingley Community Council Group. Elections were held in May 2016 for the first councillors for the new Bingley Town Council. It has 16 councillors representing eight wards: Bingley Central, Crossflatts, Lady Lane and Oakwood, Eldwick, Gilstead, Priestthorpe, Crownest and Cottingley.

===Councillors===

==Transport==
Bingley railway station is situated in the town centre. It is a stop on the Airedale Line, part of the West Yorkshire Metro railway network, with services to , and . Services are operated by Northern Trains.

The A650 connects Bingley to Keighley and Skipton to the north-west, and to Shipley and Bradford to the south-east. Through traffic has been diverted onto the new dual carriageway avoiding the town centre.

Bingley is served by several bus routes, operated by two companies.

First West Yorkshire:
* 680 between Bradford and Bingley
* 616 / 619 between Bradford and Eldwick 
* 622 between Bingley and Bradford.

Keighley Bus Company:
* 662 between Bradford and Keighley
* 60 between Leeds and Keighley 
* K17 / K19 between Keighley and Cullingworth.

Leeds Bradford International Airport is located to the east.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal passes through the town. There are several flights of locks in the Bingley section, the famous Five Rise Locks, the smaller Three Rise and a further two lock flight at Dowley Gap. The canal climbs steeply up the side of the Aire Valley through this section.

==Climate==
As with all of the United Kingdom, Bingley experiences a maritime climate (Cfb), characterised cool to mild weather, with often cloudy and damp conditions. This is amplified by Bingley&#x27;s hilly northern situation. The nearest official met office weather station for which data is available is &#x27;Bingley No. 2&quot;, actually located a couple of miles south of the town centre and at a relatively high 262 metres above sea level – More elevated than all of the urbanised area of Bingley. It is therefore likely that temperatures in central Bingley, at as little as 80 metres above sea level, tend to be 1 to 1.5 °C milder year round – though on cold clear nights this may be reversed as a temperature inversion takes hold.

The highest temperature recorded since 1980 at Bingley was 31.6 °C (88.9 °F) during August 1990. More recently the temperature fell to −10.8 °C (12.6 °F) on 20 December 2010.

==Education==
Bingley provides a range of primary and secondary schools. The secondary schools are Beckfoot School, Bingley Grammar School and Samuel Lister Academy. Bingley Grammar School was founded in the 16th century and is one of the oldest schools in the country. Heather Bank School was a private preparatory school which closed in the 1970s. Beckfoot Grammar School moved into new, purpose-built, premises in June 2011 and the old buildings were demolished in 2012.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter and the Keighley relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire, and Rombalds Radio, a community based radio station that broadcasts online.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Keighley News&quot; and &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;.

==Culture==
Bradford City Council organises an annual music festival, Bingley Music Live in Myrtle Park. The festival evolved from Music At Myrtle and features a range of musical genres including rock, alternative rock, indie rock and pop music. It is held at the end of August. First held in 2007, it was shortlisted in the &#x27;Best New Festival&#x27; category of the Virtual Festival Awards. The ethos of the event is to present high quality music at an affordable price and give a platform for local bands from across West Yorkshire to a large audience. Artists such as The Charlatans, Happy Mondays, Scouting for Girls, The Automatic, Echo &amp; The Bunnymen, Doves, The Zutons, Editors, Desert Eskimo, Calvin Harris, James, The Enemy, Seasick Steve and Professor Green have performed at Bingley Music Live since 2007.

Each year Bingley Show is held in Myrtle Park and is one of the largest one day shows in Europe. Its focus is on the horticultural and agricultural nature that reflects Bingley and its environs. The Bingley show has been held every year since 1867 apart from in 2012 when the event was cancelled due to flooding.

Bingley Little Theatre is both a venue and a major amateur group, with eight productions a year as well as studio pieces.

The first Airedale Terrier was bred in Bingley.

<text>The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is a canal in Northern England, linking the cities of Leeds and Liverpool.

Over a distance of , crossing the Pennines, and including 91 locks on the main line. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal has several small branches, and in the early 21st century a new link was constructed into the Liverpool docks system.

==History==

===Background===
In the mid-18th century the growing towns of Yorkshire, including Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford, were trading increasingly. While the Aire and Calder Navigation improved links to the east for Leeds, links to the west were limited. Bradford merchants wanted to increase the supply of limestone to make lime for mortar and agriculture using coal from Bradford&#x27;s collieries and to transport textiles to the Port of Liverpool. On the west coast, traders in the busy port of Liverpool wanted a cheap supply of coal for their shipping and manufacturing businesses and to tap the output from the industrial regions of Lancashire. Inspired by the effectiveness of the wholly artificial navigation, the Bridgewater Canal opened in 1759–60. A canal across the Pennines linking Liverpool and Hull (by means of the Aire and Calder Navigation) would have obvious trade benefits.

A public meeting took place at the Sun Inn in Bradford on 2 July 1766 to promote the building of such a canal. John Longbotham was engaged to survey a route. Two groups were set up to promote the scheme, one in Liverpool and one in Bradford. The Liverpool committee was unhappy with the route originally proposed, following the Ribble valley through Preston, considering that it ran too far to the north, missing key towns and the Wigan coalfield. A counter-proposal was produced by John Eyes and Richard Melling, improved by P.P. Burdett, which was rejected by the Bradford committee as too expensive, mainly because of the valley crossing at Burnley. James Brindley was called in to arbitrate, and ruled in favour of Longbotham&#x27;s more northerly route, though with a branch towards Wigan, a decision which caused some of the Lancashire backers to withdraw their support, and which was subsequently amended over the course of development. In 1768 Brindley gave a detailed estimate of a distance just less than built at a cost of £259,777 (equivalent to about £32.67 million as of 2014).
The (10 Geo. 3. c. 114) was passed in May 1770 authorising construction, and Brindley was appointed chief engineer and John Longbotham clerk of works; following Brindley&#x27;s death in 1772, Longbotham carried out both roles.

===Construction===

====First phase====
A commencement ceremony was held at Halsall, north of Liverpool on 5 November 1770, with the first sod being dug by the Hon. Charles Mordaunt of Halsall Hall. The first section of the canal opened from Bingley to Skipton in 1773. By 1774 the canal had been completed from Skipton to Shipley, including significant engineering features such as the Bingley Five Rise Locks, Bingley Three Rise Locks and the seven-arch aqueduct over the River Aire, at Dowley Gap. Also completed was the branch to Bradford. On the western side, the section from Liverpool to Newburgh was dug. By the following year the Yorkshire end had been extended to Gargrave, and by 1777 the canal had joined the Aire and Calder Navigation in Leeds. From Liverpool it had reached Wigan by 1781, replacing the earlier and unsatisfactory Douglas Navigation. By now, the subscribed funds and further borrowing had all been spent, and work stopped in 1781 with the completion of the Rufford Branch from Burscough to the River Douglas at Tarleton. The war in the American colonies and its aftermath made it impossible to continue for more than a decade.

====Second phase====

In 1789 Robert Whitworth developed fresh proposals to vary the line of the remaining part of the canal, including a tunnel at Foulridge, lowering the proposed summit level by , using a more southerly route in Lancashire. These proposals were authorised by a fresh act of Parliament, the (30 Geo. 3. c. 65), together with further fund-raising, and in 1791, construction of the canal finally recommenced south-westward from Gargrave, heading toward Barrowford in Lancashire. By this time planning for the competing Rochdale Canal was under way and it was likely to offer a more direct journey to Liverpool via Manchester and the Bridgewater Canal. The same year John Rennie surveyed a branch of the Rochdale between Todmorden and Burnley.
In 1794 an agreement was reached with the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal company to create a link near Red Moss near Horwich. The company&#x27;s experiences running the two sections of the canal had shown that coal not limestone would be its main cargo, and that there was plenty of income available from local trade between the settlements along the route. With this in mind in the same year, the route was changed again with a further act of Parliament, the (34 Geo. 3. c. 94), moving closer to that proposed by Burdett.

The Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal company proposed another link from Bury to Accrington. This new link would have been known as the Haslingden Canal. The Peel family asked the canal company not to construct the crossing over the River Hyndburn above their textile printworks; such a crossing would have required the construction of embankments, and reduced the water supply to their factories. Consequently, Accrington was bypassed and the Haslingden Canal was never built.
Yet more fund-raising took place, as the Foulridge Tunnel was proving difficult and expensive to dig. The new route took the canal south via the expanding coal mines at Burnley, Accrington and Blackburn, but would require some sizable earthworks to pass the former. The completion in 1796 of the Foulridge Tunnel and the flight of seven locks at Barrowford enabled the canal to open to eastern Burnley. At a cost of £40,000 (about £3.65 million in 2014). The tunnel became the most expensive single item in the whole project.

At Burnley, rather than using two sets of locks to cross the shallow Calder valley, Whitworth designed the Burnley Embankment, a long and up to high earthwork. It would also require another tunnel nearby at Gannow and a sizeable cutting to allow the canal to traverse the hillside between the two. It took 5 years to complete this work, with the embankment alone costing £22,000, about £1.55 million in 2014 (comparing the historic opportunity cost of £22,000 in 1801 with 2014). Whitworth died aged 64, on 30 March 1799 and Samuel Fletcher, previously the inspector of works took over as engineer. Once the Burnley work was completed, the canal opened to Enfield near Accrington in 1801. It would be another 9 years until it reached Blackburn only 4 miles away. Following the French Revolution, Britain had been at war with France from 1793 to 1802. The peace proved temporary, with the Napoleonic Wars beginning the following year. High taxes and interest rates during this period made it difficult for the company to borrow money, and the pace of construction inevitably slowed.

====Third phase====
In 1804 Samuel Fletcher also died and his brother Joseph and son James were jointly appointed to replace him and they were provided with Gannow House in Burnley. In 1805 they estimated the cost of linking Enfield to Red Moss would be £245,275 and £101,725 for the shorter continuation to Wigan (totalling about £27.36 million in 2014). The planned link with the Manchester, Bolton and Bury did not materialize.

The latest plan for the route had it running parallel to, and then crossing the southern section of the Lancaster Canal, but common sense prevailed and the Leeds and Liverpool connected with the Lancaster Canal between Aspull and Johnson&#x27;s Hillock. The main line of the canal was thus completed in 1816.
There had been various unsuccessful negotiations to connect the canal to the Bridgewater Canal at Leigh but agreement was finally reached in 1818, and embodied in the (59 Geo. 3. c. cv) and the connection was opened in 1820, thus giving access to Manchester and the rest of the canal network. The Bridgewater Canal, like most of Brindley&#x27;s designs was for boats of length, whereas the Leeds and Liverpool had been designed for broad boats of length. There was naturally a desire by the longer boats to reach Liverpool and the locks of the westerly end of the canal were extended to in 1822.

James Fletcher continued as engineer until his death in 1844.

===Operation===
The canal took almost 50 years to complete; in crossing the Pennines the Leeds and Liverpool had been beaten by the Huddersfield Narrow Canal and the Rochdale Canal. The most important cargo was always coal, with over a million tons per year being delivered to Liverpool in the 1860s. Even in Yorkshire, more coal was carried than limestone. Once the canal was fully open, receipts for carrying merchandise matched those of coal. The heavy industry along its route, together with the decision to build the canal with broad locks, ensured that (unlike the other two trans-Pennine canals) the Leeds and Liverpool competed successfully with the railways throughout the 19th century and remained open through the 20th century.

===20th century===
The canal suffered some damage during the Second World War. It was breached when a German bomb fell on it in Bootle. The canal in West Lancashire was part of Britain&#x27;s defensive plans against invasion. Along the canal there were tank traps, bunkers and blockhouses. Some buildings such as barns and pubs along the canal were fortified. There are still some remaining concrete pillboxes and brick built blockhouses.

===21st century===

In August 2010, a 60-mile stretch of the canal was closed due to the low reservoirs, following the driest start to the year since records began. It was reopened the following month, although some restrictions remained.
The £22 million Liverpool Canal Link was completed in 2009, joining the Leeds and Liverpool Canal with the City Centre.

On 11 October 2021 the stretch between Barrowford and Blackburn was closed following a breach in the canal appearing between bridges 109 and 110.

Later that month, lock numbers 73 and 80 were among 142 sites across England to receive part of a £35-million grant from the government&#x27;s Culture Recovery Fund.

==Route==

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal is long and crosses the country from Liverpool to Leeds, via East Lancashire and the Pennines. It was generally built with locks long and wide.



From Liverpool to Appley Locks, the canal runs for without locks, across the West Lancashire Coastal Plain.

The two main side-branches both connect to other waterways. The Rufford Branch links into the River Douglas and, via the Ribble Link and the River Ribble to the previously isolated Lancaster Canal. The Leigh Branch from Wigan leads to the Bridgewater Canal and thus to Manchester and the Midlands.

The canal at Aintree passes close to the racecourse and gives the name to the course&#x27;s Canal Turn.

<doc id="149743" wikidata="Q1542536" url="?curid=149743" title="The Atlantic">
<text>The Atlantic is an American magazine and multi-platform publisher based in Washington, D.C. It features articles on politics, foreign affairs, business and the economy, culture and the arts, technology, and science.

It was founded in 1857 in Boston as The Atlantic Monthly, a literary and cultural magazine that published leading writers&#x27; commentary on education, the abolition of slavery, and other major political issues of that time. Its founders included Francis H. Underwood and prominent writers Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and John Greenleaf Whittier. James Russell Lowell was its first editor. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the magazine also published the annual &quot;The Atlantic Monthly Almanac&quot;. The magazine was purchased in 1999 by businessman David G. Bradley, who fashioned it into a general editorial magazine primarily aimed at serious national readers and &quot;thought leaders&quot;; in 2017, he sold a majority interest in the publication to Laurene Powell Jobs&#x27;s Emerson Collective.

The magazine was published monthly until 2001, when 11 issues were produced; since 2003, it has published 10 per year. It dropped &quot;Monthly&quot; from the cover with the January/February 2004 issue, and officially changed the name in 2007. In 2024, it announced that it will resume publishing monthly issues in 2025.

In 2016, the periodical was named Magazine of the Year by the American Society of Magazine Editors. In 2022, its writers won Pulitzer Prizes for feature writing and, in 2022, 2023, and 2024 &quot;The Atlantic&quot; won the award for general excellence by the American Society of Magazine Editors. In 2024, it was reported that the magazine had crossed one million subscribers and become profitable, three years after losing $20 million in a single year and laying off 17% of its staff.

As of 2024, the website&#x27;s executive editor is Adrienne LaFrance, the editor-in-chief is Jeffrey Goldberg, and the CEO is Nicholas Thompson. 

==Founding==
===19th century===

In the autumn of 1857, Moses Dresser Phillips, a publisher from Boston, created &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. The plan for the magazine was launched at a dinner party, which was described in a letter by Phillips:

At that dinner he announced his idea for the magazine:

&quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s first issue was published in November 1857, and quickly gained notability as one of the finest magazines in the English-speaking world.

In 1878, the magazine absorbed &quot;The Galaxy&quot;, a competitor monthly magazine founded a dozen years previously by William Conant Church and his brother Francis P. Church; it had published works by Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Ion Hanford Perdicaris and Henry James.

In 1879, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; had offices in Winthrop Square in Boston and at 21 Astor Place in New York City.

==Literary history==
A leading literary magazine, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; has published many significant works and authors. It was the first to publish pieces by the abolitionists Julia Ward Howe (&quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; on February 1, 1862), and William Parker, whose slave narrative, &quot;The Freedman&#x27;s Story&quot; was published in February and March 1866. It also published Charles W. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The New Education&quot;, a call for practical reform that led to his appointment to the presidency of Harvard University in 1869, works by Charles Chesnutt before he collected them in &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot; (1899), and poetry and short stories, and helped launch many national literary careers. In 2005, the magazine won a National Magazine Award for fiction.

Editors have recognized major cultural changes and movements. For example, of the emerging writers of the 1920s, Ernest Hemingway had his short story &quot;Fifty Grand&quot; published in the July 1927 edition. Harking back to its abolitionist roots, in its August 1963 edition, at the height of the civil rights movement, the magazine published Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s defense of civil disobedience, &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;, under the headline &quot;The Negro Is Your Brother&quot;.

The magazine has published speculative articles that inspired the development of new technologies. The classic example is Vannevar Bush&#x27;s essay &quot;As We May Think&quot; (July 1945), which inspired Douglas Engelbart and later Ted Nelson to develop the modern workstation and hypertext technology.

&quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; founded the Atlantic Monthly Press in 1917; for many years, it was operated in partnership with Little, Brown and Company. Its published books included &quot;Drums Along the Mohawk&quot; (1936) and &quot;Blue Highways&quot; (1982). The press was sold in 1986; today it is an imprint of Grove Atlantic.

In addition to publishing notable fiction and poetry, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; has emerged in the 21st century as an influential platform for longform storytelling and newsmaker interviews. Influential cover stories have included Anne Marie Slaughter&#x27;s &quot;Why Women Still Can&#x27;t Have It All&quot; (2012) and Ta-Nehisi Coates&#x27;s &quot;A Case for Reparations&quot; (2014). In 2015, Jeffrey Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Obama Doctrine&quot; was widely discussed by American media and prompted response by many world leaders.

As of 2022, writers and frequent contributors to the print magazine included James Fallows, Jeffrey Goldberg, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Caitlin Flanagan, Jonathan Rauch, McKay Coppins, Gillian White, Adrienne LaFrance, Vann R. Newkirk II, Derek Thompson, David Frum, Jennifer Senior, George Packer, Ed Yong, and James Parker.

On August 2, 2023, it was announced that Jeffrey Goldberg, who had served as editor-in-chief of The Atlantic since 2016, had been named as Washington Week&#x27;s tenth moderator, and that the politics and culture publication would also enter into an editorial partnership with the television program – which was retitled accordingly as Washington Week with The Atlantic – similar to the earlier collaboration with the National Journal. The first episode under the longer title, and with Goldberg as moderator, was the one broadcast on August 11, 2023.

==Political viewpoint==
In 1860, three years into publication, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s then-editor James Russell Lowell endorsed Republican Abraham Lincoln for his first run for president and also endorsed the abolition of slavery.

In 1964, Edward Weeks wrote on behalf of the editorial board in endorsing Democratic President Lyndon B. Johnson and rebuking Republican Barry Goldwater&#x27;s candidacy.

In 2016, during the 2016 presidential campaign, the editorial board endorsed a candidate for the third time in the magazine&#x27;s history, urging readers to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in a rebuke of Republican Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy.

After Trump prevailed in the November 2016 election, the magazine became a strong critic of him. In March 2019, a cover article by editor Yoni Appelbaum called for the impeachment of Donald Trump: &quot;It&#x27;s time for Congress to judge the president&#x27;s fitness to serve.&quot;

In September 2020, it published a story, citing several anonymous sources, reporting that Trump referred to dead American soldiers as &quot;losers&quot;. Trump called it a &quot;fake story&quot;, and suggested the magazine would soon be out of business.

In 2020, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, and urged its readers to oppose Trump&#x27;s re-election bid. In early 2024, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; published a special 24-article issue titled &quot;If Trump Wins,&quot; warning about a potential second term for Trump being worse than his first. In October, the publication endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in her presidential bid against Trump in the 2024 election.

==Format==
=== &quot;Aspen Ideas Festival&quot; ===

In 2005, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and the Aspen Institute launched the Aspen Ideas Festival, a ten-day event in and around the city of Aspen, Colorado. The annual conference features 350 presenters, 200 sessions, and 3,000 attendees. The event has been called a &quot;political who&#x27;s who&quot; as it often features policymakers, journalists, lobbyists, and think tank leaders.

On January 22, 2008, TheAtlantic.com dropped its subscriber wall and allowed users to freely browse its site, including all past archives. By 2011 &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s web properties included TheAtlanticWire.com, a news- and opinion-tracking site launched in 2009, and TheAtlanticCities.com, a stand-alone website started in 2011 that was devoted to global cities and trends. According to a &quot;Mashable&quot; profile in December 2011, &quot;traffic to the three web properties recently surpassed 11 million uniques per month, up a staggering 2500% since &quot;The Atlantic&quot; brought down its paywall in early 2008.&quot;

===&quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot;===
In 2009, the magazine launched &quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot; as a stand-alone news aggregator site. It was intended as a curated selection of news and opinions from online, print, radio, and television outlets. At its launch, it published op-eds from across the media spectrum and summarized significant positions in each debate. It later expanded to feature news and original reporting.

Regular features in the magazine included &quot;What I Read&quot;, describing the media diets of people from entertainment, journalism, and politics; and &quot;Trimming the Times&quot;, the feature editor&#x27;s summary of the best content in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;The Atlantic Wire&quot; rebranded itself as &quot;The Wire&quot; in November 2013, and was folded back into &quot;The Atlantic&quot; the following year.

In August 2011, it created its video channel. Initially created as an aggregator, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s video component, Atlantic Studios, has since evolved in an in-house production studio that creates custom video series and original documentaries.

===&quot;CityLab&quot;===
In September 2011, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; launched &quot;CityLab&quot;, a separate website. Its co-founders included Richard Florida, urban theorist and professor. The stand-alone site has been described as exploring and explaining &quot;the most innovative ideas and pressing issues facing today&#x27;s global cities and neighborhoods.&quot; In 2014, it was rebranded as &quot;CityLab.com&quot;, and covers transportation, environment, equity, life, and design. Among its offerings are Navigator, &quot;a guide to urban life&quot;; and Solutions, which covers solutions to problems in a dozen topics.

In December 2011, a new Health Channel launched on TheAtlantic.com, incorporating coverage of food, as well as topics related to the mind, body, sex, family, and public health. Its launch was overseen by Nicholas Jackson, who had previously been overseeing the Life channel and initially joined the website to cover technology. TheAtlantic.com has also expanded to visual storytelling, with the addition of the &quot;In Focus&quot; photo blog, curated by Alan Taylor.

In 2015, TheAtlantic.com launched a dedicated Science section and in January 2016 it redesigned and expanded its politics section in conjunction with the 2016 U.S. presidential race.

In 2015, &quot;CityLab&quot; and Univision launched &quot;CityLab Latino&quot;, which features original journalism in Spanish as well as translated reporting from the English language edition of &quot;CityLab.com&quot;. The site has not been updated since 2018.

In early December 2019, Atlantic Media sold &quot;CityLab&quot; to Bloomberg Media, which promptly laid off half the staff. The site was relaunched on June 18, 2020, with few major changes other than new branding and linking the site with other Bloomberg verticals and its data terminal.

In September 2019, TheAtlantic.com introduced a digital subscription model, restricting unsubscribed readers&#x27; access to five free articles per month.

In June 2020, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; released its first full-length documentary, &quot;White Noise&quot;, a film about three alt-right activists.

==Praise, retractions, legal issues, and controversies ==

*In June 2006, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; named &quot;The Atlantic&quot; one of the top ten English-language magazines, describing it as the &quot;150-year-old granddaddy of periodicals&quot; because &quot;it keeps us smart and in the know&quot; with cover stories on the then-forthcoming fight over &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. It also lauded regular features such as &quot;Word Fugitives&quot; and &quot;Primary Sources&quot; as &quot;cultural barometers&quot;.
*On January 14, 2013, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s website published &quot;sponsor content&quot; promoting David Miscavige, the leader of the Church of Scientology. While the magazine had previously published advertising looking like articles, this was widely criticized. The page comments were moderated by the marketing team, not by editorial staff, and comments critical of the church were being removed. Later that day, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; removed the piece from its website and issued an apology.
*In 2019, the magazine published an expose on the allegations against movie director Bryan Singer that &quot;sent Singer&#x27;s career into a tailspin&quot;. It was originally contracted to &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, but the writers moved it there due to what &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Ben Smith described as Hearst magazines&#x27; &quot;timid&quot; nature. &quot;There&#x27;s not a lot of nuance here&quot;, Jeffrey Goldberg said. &quot;They spiked a story that should have been published in the public interest for reasons unknown.&quot;
*In June 2020, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; faced legal action in Japan that claimed defamation and invasion of privacy in the article &quot;When the Presses Stop&quot; by Molly Ball, published in the January/February 2018 edition, which led to numerous removals, corrections and clarifications after a settlement was reached in January 2024. The lawsuit highlighted fact-checking and ethical concerns, bringing attention to the magazine&#x27;s editorial practices.
*On November 1, 2020, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; retracted an article, &quot;The Mad, Mad World of Niche Sports Among Ivy League–Obsessed Parents&quot;, after an inquiry by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. An 800-word editor&#x27;s note said, &quot;We cannot attest to the trustworthiness and credibility of the author, and therefore we cannot attest to the veracity of the article.&quot; The article&#x27;s author, freelancer Ruth Shalit Barrett, had left the staff of &quot;The New Republic&quot; in 1999 amid allegations of plagiarism. On January 7, 2022, Barrett sued the magazine for defamation. The lawsuit claimed &quot;The Atlantic&quot; misrepresented Barrett&#x27;s background and destroyed her journalistic career through what it publicly said about her. In legal filings, Barrett argued that &quot;The Atlantic&quot;&#x27;s handling of allegations and errors in another article written by Molly Ball demonstrated inconsistency in the magazine&#x27;s editorial standards and accountability measures. Barrett asserted that the factual inaccuracies and ethical violations in Ball&#x27;s piece, as highlighted by a separate defamation lawsuit that resulted in a settlement and numerous retractions and corrections to Ball&#x27;s story, were “transgressions far more numerous and incomparably worse” than any mistakes attributed to her own work. 
*On February 5, 2024, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; cut ties with contributor Yascha Mounk after he was accused of rape. He called the allegation &quot;categorically untrue.&quot;

==Ownership and editors==
By its third year, it was published by Boston publishing house Ticknor and Fields, which later became part of Houghton Mifflin, based in the city known for literary culture. The magazine was purchased in 1908 by editor at the time, Ellery Sedgwick, and remained in Boston.

In 1980, the magazine was acquired by Mortimer Zuckerman, property magnate and founder of Boston Properties, who became its chairman. On September 27, 1999, Zuckerman transferred ownership of the magazine to David G. Bradley, owner of the National Journal Group, which focused on Washington, D.C. and federal government news. Bradley had promised that the magazine would stay in Boston for the foreseeable future, as it did for the next five-and-a-half years.

In April 2005, however, the publishers announced that the editorial offices would be moved from their longtime home at 77 North Washington Street in Boston to join the company&#x27;s advertising and circulation divisions in Washington, D.C. Later in August, Bradley told &quot;The New York Observer&quot; that the move was not made to save money—near-term savings would be $200,000–$300,000, a relatively small amount that would be swallowed by severance-related spending—but instead would serve to create a hub in Washington, D.C., where the top minds from all of Bradley&#x27;s publications could collaborate under the Atlantic Media Company umbrella. Few of the Boston staff agreed to move, and Bradley then commenced an open search for a new editorial staff.

In 2006, Bradley hired James Bennet, the Jerusalem bureau chief for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, as editor-in-chief. Bradley also hired Jeffrey Goldberg and Andrew Sullivan as writers for the magazine.

In 2008, Jay Lauf joined the organization as publisher and vice-president; as of 2017, he was publisher and president of &quot;Quartz&quot;.

In early 2014, Bennet and Bob Cohn became co-presidents of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and Cohn became the publication&#x27;s sole president in March 2016 when Bennet was tapped to lead &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s editorial page. Jeffrey Goldberg was named editor-in-chief in October 2016.

On July 28, 2017, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; announced that Laurene Powell Jobs (the widow of former Apple Inc. chairman and CEO Steve Jobs) had acquired majority ownership through her Emerson Collective organization, with a staff member of Emerson Collective, Peter Lattman, being immediately named as vice chairman of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. David G. Bradley and Atlantic Media retained a minority share position in this sale.

In May 2019, technology journalist Adrienne LaFrance became executive editor.

In December 2020, former &quot;Wired&quot; editor-in-chief Nicholas Thompson was named CEO of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

<text>Boston Spa is a village and civil parish in the Leeds Metropolitan District in West Yorkshire, England. Situated south of Wetherby, Boston Spa is on the south bank of the River Wharfe across from Thorp Arch. According to the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 4,006 rising to 4,079 in the 2011 census.

It sits in the Wetherby ward of Leeds City Council and the Wetherby and Easingwold parliamentary constituency.

==Etymology==
Boston Spa&#x27;s name is not attested before appearing on printed maps in 1771, when it was labelled &quot;Thorp Spaw&quot;, presumably &#x27;the spa associated with Thorp Arch&#x27; (the nearest settlement). The Boston element is attested in 1799 as &quot;Bostongate&quot; and in 1822 as Boston, probably the surname of a local family, whose name derives from Boston, Lincolnshire, and their name was given to the settlement that grew up around the spa.

==History==

The Boston Spa hoard, a Romano-British coin hoard dating to the mid second-century AD and comprising a grey ware vessel and 172 silver &quot;denarii&quot;, was found in the town in 1848.

In 1744, John Shires established a spa resort when he discovered sulphur springs in the magnesian limestone. It was originally known as &quot;Thorp Spaw&quot;. In 1753, the Tadcaster to Otley road that passes through Boston Spa was turnpiked. In the same year, Joseph Taite built a house to accommodate visitors, it became the Royal Hotel which is still standing, but converted into flats and shops. By 1819, Boston Spa had a population of more than 600, and several inns and other houses offering accommodation had been built. Spa baths were built to allow visitors to take the waters. The spa declined when Harrogate became popular as a spa town.

The Boston Spa and Thorp Arch Conservation Area, designated in 1969, extended across Boston Spa and Thorp Arch parishes. It was revised and divided in 2009, restricting the boundaries to Boston Spa parish and reshaped to exclude areas of late-20th-century estate housing to the south of the High Street. The conservation area boundary focuses on the historic settlement. It was extended to the west, to encompass West End, an area of dwellings constructed during the Second World War to house workers from Thorp Arch munitions factory. The war had a major effect on Boston Spa&#x27;s population, society and surroundings, and the buildings stand as a testament to that history.

== Governance ==
When Boston Spa was founded in 1744 it was in the township of Clifford in the old parish of Bramham, in the upper division of the wapentake of Barkston Ash, in the West Riding of Yorkshire. From 1866 to 1896, it was part of the civil parish of Clifford with Boston, and became a separate civil parish in 1896. The parish was in Wetherby Rural District in the West Riding of Yorkshire until 1974, when it was transferred to the City of Leeds in the new county of West Yorkshire.

==Geography==
Boston Spa is in the north-east of the City of Leeds district about three miles south-east of Wetherby and immediately north of Clifford on the Collingham to Tadcaster road, the A659. It is at a bridging point on the south side of the River Wharfe, linked to Thorp Arch on the north bank by Thorp Arch Bridge. The village, surrounded by rolling, arable farmland, developed along High Street with Bridge Road at the centre. 

The village is on the narrow Permian Magnesian Limestone ridge that runs north-south from North Yorkshire to Nottinghamshire.

==Amenities==

Boston Spa has a post office, a small library and a filling station. There are three public houses, (the Admiral Hawke and the Fox and Hounds both owned by Samuel Smith Old Brewery) and the Crown Hotel on the high street owned by an independent group of investors, a small Costcutter supermarket in the former Royal Hotel and several independent retailers in the village centre (a butcher, hardware shop and several takeaway restaurants).

The Crown Hotel closed in 2012 and was subject to a public inquiry as to its future use. Arguments presented in 2014 by Tesco that the premises &quot;had little or no use as a hotel facility&quot; were accepted at appeal.
The Boston Spa branch of the British Library, the Document Supply Service, is north-east of the village in the Thorp Arch Trading Estate. The branch contains the British Library newspaper collection.

There are two churches St Mary&#x27;s Parish Church and Boston Spa Methodist Church. 

==Education==
The village primary schools are: Primrose Lane Primary School, St Edward&#x27;s Catholic Primary School and St Mary&#x27;s CE Primary School.

Close by in Clifford, is Boston Spa Academy, the local secondary school taking pupils from areas which also feed comprehensives in Wetherby, Garforth and Pendas Fields. The school has success in sports and science teaching, and caters for pupils undertaking GCSEs, A levels, GNVQs and those with special needs according to its Ofsted reports.

Other educational establishments in Clifford include the children&#x27;s hospice Martin House and St John&#x27;s Catholic School for the Deaf which has a UK-wide catchment.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds, Heart Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire, Hits Radio West Yorkshire and Tempo FM, a community based station which broadcast from Wetherby. Local newspaper is served by the &quot;Wetherby News&quot;.

==Housing==
Boston Spa has a mix of private and council houses. Most of the council housing is situated around Clifford Moor Road and Wickham Avenue. The east side of Boston Spa comprises mainly larger houses. There are many Georgian villas and town houses on High Street.

==Events==
The village annual gala is held in June. Since 2009 a beer festival takes place in the village hall.
The village hall has hosted a nationally renowned weekly jazz night since January 2005 and an annual arts festival usually in October.

==Sport and recreation==
Boston Spa Hockey Club is a field hockey club that competes in the North Hockey League and the Yorkshire &amp; North East Hockey League.

The route of The White Rose Way, a long-distance walk from Leeds to Scarborough, North Yorkshire passes through the village. As does the Ebor Way which passes over the river at Thorp Arch village before continuing towards Tadcaster.

<doc id="149748" wikidata="Q300502" url="?curid=149748" title="A Night at the Roxbury">
<text>A Night at the Roxbury is a 1998 American comedy film based on a recurring sketch on television&#x27;s long-running &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; called &quot;The Roxbury Guys&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; regulars Will Ferrell, Chris Kattan, Molly Shannon, Mark McKinney, and Colin Quinn star. This film expands on the original &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketches where the Roxbury Guys were joined by that week&#x27;s host, and bobbed their heads to Haddaway&#x27;s hit song &quot;What Is Love&quot; while being comically rejected by women at various clubs.

Other roles include Jennifer Coolidge as a police officer, Chazz Palminteri&#x27;s uncredited role as gregarious night club impresario Mr. Benny Zadir, and Colin Quinn as his bodyguard Dooey. Former &quot;SNL&quot; cast member Mark McKinney has a cameo as a priest officiating a wedding.

==Plot==
Steve and Doug Butabi are sons of a wealthy businessman and in their spare time, enjoy frequenting nightclubs, where they bob their heads in unison to Eurodance, a European subgenre of electronic dance music, and fail miserably at picking up women. Their goal is to party at the Roxbury, a fabled Los Angeles nightclub where they are continually denied entry by a hulking bouncer.

By day, the brothers work at an artificial plant store owned by their wealthy father, Kamehl. They spend most of their time goofing off, daydreaming about opening a club as cool as the Roxbury together, and Doug using credit card transactions as an excuse to flirt with a card approval associate via telephone that he calls &quot;Credit Vixen.&quot; The store shares a wall with a lighting emporium owned by Fred Sanderson. Mr. Butabi and Mr. Sanderson hope that Steve and Emily, Sanderson&#x27;s daughter, will marry, uniting the families and the businesses to form the first plant-lamp emporium.

After a day at the beach, the brothers decide that night was to be the night they would finally get into the Roxbury. Returning home, Doug gets into a heated argument with their father about going out clubbing instead of staying home. Their father has planned a dinner party with Emily and her parents. The angered Mr. Butabi then refuses them access to their BMW and their cell phones. They are given enormous cell phones by their mother, Barbara, and allowed use of the plant store&#x27;s Ford Econoline delivery van. The brothers go to the Roxbury when they are asked their names, being told they are not on the list and are denied entry.

After discovering that they might bribe their way into the club, the brothers drive around looking for an ATM slamming on the brakes again and again while in traffic causing them to get into a fender-bender with Richard Grieco. Grieco explains to the girl with him in the passenger seat that his Ferrari is a racing car and therefore illegal. To avoid a lawsuit, Grieco uses his fame to get them into the popular club. There, they meet the owner of the Roxbury, Benny Zadir, who listens to their idea for their own nightclub. He likes them and sets up a meeting with them for the next day. The brothers also meet a pair of women at the Roxbury: Vivica and Cambi, who see them talking to Zadir and think that the brothers are rich. The women later sleep with Doug and Steve, leading the brothers to think they are in serious relationships.

On the way to the after-party at Mr. Zadir&#x27;s house, the brothers annoy his driver and bodyguard Dooey by making him stop to buy fluffy whip and making jokes about sleeping with his parents. As revenge, the next day, Dooey refuses them entry into Zadir&#x27;s office for their meeting. He tells the brothers that Zadir was drunk out of his mind last night and does not know who they are. In reality, Zadir wanted to see them, but does not have their contact information.

Vivica and Cambi break up with the Butabi brothers after realizing they are not actually wealthy. Afterwards, the brothers argue over who is at fault for their sudden misfortune and Doug moves out of their shared bedroom and into the guest house. Meanwhile, Steve is forced into an engagement with Emily by his father. The wedding is held in the backyard of the Butabi residence, but is interrupted by Doug. The brothers reconcile and leave, but their friend and personal trainer Craig, reveals his feelings for Emily, and marries her. Afterwards, Grieco consoles Mr. Butabi to help him understand that Steve was not ready for marriage, and that Butabi is too hard on Doug.

After the Butabi brothers reconcile with their father and Doug moves back into their bedroom, the film ends as the brothers happen upon a hot new club. The building is unique in that the exterior is constructed to resemble the interior of a nightclub, and the interior resembles a street—this was an idea pitched by Doug and Steve to Zadir earlier in the film. Attempting to enter, they&#x27;re asked their names and much to their surprise are told they are on the list. They walk into the club where they find Zadir and Zadir reveals that to reward their idea, he has made them part-owners of the club. Their new-found success comes full circle when they meet two women in the club: Doug&#x27;s phone operator from the credit card company (&quot;Credit Vixen&quot;) and a police officer with whom Steve flirted while getting a ticket.

==Production==
Based on the sketch known as &quot;The Roxbury Guys&quot;, Amy Heckerling was a fan and asked co-creator Steve Koren to write a film script based on it. His original draft was described as being similar to &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, but Heckerling was unimpressed as she considered the characters to be from Los Angeles and the sons of an immigrant who was disappointed in their lifestyle. Several jokes ended up on the cutting room floor including a gag where the Butabi brothers meet a coke dealer in the bathroom who offers them the substance by calling it different names. After finally breaking down and telling them what it is he is selling, the brothers were to respond by saying that they do not do drugs.

In May 2019, Kattan claimed in his memoir that he was pressured by producer Lorne Michaels to have sex with Amy Heckerling so she would direct the film (although she ultimately only produced, rather than directed it). This incident ultimately ended his friendship with Ferrell.

==Reception==
&quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; was heavily panned by critics. On review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, it received a rating of 11% and an average rating of 3.4/10 based on 54 reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; has the same problems as the worst &quot;SNL&quot; movies: one-note characters and plots unreasonably stretched to feature-length runtime&quot;. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; acknowledged the film&#x27;s appeal, but reasoned that it was &quot;a lot like the brothers themselves: undeniably pathetic but strangely lovable. Still, do you really want to spend an hour and a half with them in a dark room?&quot; Roger Ebert observed that &quot;the sad thing about &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; is that the characters are in a one-joke movie, and they&#x27;re the joke... It&#x27;s the first comedy I&#x27;ve attended where you feel that to laugh would be cruel to the characters.&quot;

<text>Euglena is a genus of single cell flagellate eukaryotes. It is the best known and most widely studied member of the class Euglenoidea, a diverse group containing some 54 genera and at least 200 species. Species of &quot;Euglena&quot; are found in fresh water and salt water. They are often abundant in quiet inland waters where they may bloom in numbers sufficient to color the surface of ponds and ditches green (&quot;E. viridis&quot;) or red (&quot;E. sanguinea&quot;).

The species &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot; has been used extensively in the laboratory as a model organism.

Most species of &quot;Euglena&quot; have photosynthesizing chloroplasts within the body of the cell, which enable them to feed by autotrophy, like plants. However, they can also take nourishment heterotrophically, like animals. Since &quot;Euglena&quot; have features of both animals and plants, early taxonomists, working within the Linnaean two-kingdom system of biological classification, found them difficult to classify. It was the question of where to put such &quot;unclassifiable&quot; creatures that prompted Ernst Haeckel to add a third living kingdom (a fourth kingdom &quot;in toto&quot;) to the &quot;Animale&quot;, &quot;Vegetabile&quot; (and &quot;Lapideum&quot; meaning &quot;Mineral&quot;) of Linnaeus: the Kingdom Protista.

==Form and function==
When feeding as a heterotroph, &quot;Euglena&quot; takes in nutrients by osmotrophy, and can survive without light on a diet of organic matter, such as beef extract, peptone, acetate, ethanol or carbohydrates. When there is sufficient sunlight for it to feed by phototrophy, it uses chloroplasts containing the pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b to produce sugars by photosynthesis. &quot;Euglena&#x27;s&quot; chloroplasts are surrounded by three membranes, while those of plants and the green algae (among which earlier taxonomists often placed &quot;Euglena&quot;) have only two membranes. This fact has been taken as morphological evidence that &quot;Euglena&#x27;s&quot; chloroplasts evolved from a eukaryotic green alga. Thus, the similarities between &quot;Euglena&quot; and plants would have arisen not because of kinship but because of a secondary endosymbiosis. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has lent support to this hypothesis, and it is now generally accepted.

&quot;Euglena&quot; chloroplasts contain pyrenoids, used in the synthesis of paramylon, a form of starch energy storage enabling &quot;Euglena&quot; to survive periods of light deprivation. The presence of pyrenoids is used as an identifying feature of the genus, separating it from other euglenoids, such as &quot;Lepocinclis&quot; and &quot;Phacus&quot;.

&quot;Euglena&quot; have two flagella rooted in basal bodies located in a small reservoir at the front of the cell. Typically, one flagellum is very short, and does not protrude from the cell, while the other is long enough to be seen with light microscopy. In some species, such as &quot;Euglena mutabilis&quot;, both flagella are &quot;non-emergent&quot;—entirely confined to the interior of the cell&#x27;s reservoir—and consequently cannot be seen in the light microscope. In species that possess a long, emergent flagellum, it may be used to help the organism swim. The surface of the flagellum is coated with about 30,000 extremely fine filaments called mastigonemes.

Like other euglenoids, &quot;Euglena&quot; possess a red eyespot, an organelle composed of carotenoid pigment granules. The red spot itself is not thought to be photosensitive. Rather, it filters the sunlight that falls on a light-detecting structure at the base of the flagellum (a swelling, known as the paraflagellar body), allowing only certain wavelengths of light to reach it. As the cell rotates with respect to the light source, the eyespot partially blocks the source, permitting the &quot;Euglena&quot; to find the light and move toward it (a process known as phototaxis).
&quot;Euglena&quot; lacks a cell wall. Instead, it has a pellicle made up of a protein layer supported by a substructure of microtubules, arranged in strips spiraling around the cell. The action of these pellicle strips sliding over one another, known as metaboly, gives &quot;Euglena&quot; its exceptional flexibility and contractility. The mechanism of this euglenoid movement is not understood, but its molecular basis may be similar to that of amoeboid movement.

In low moisture conditions, or when food is scarce, &quot;Euglena&quot; forms a protective wall around itself and lies dormant as a resting cyst until environmental conditions improve.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Euglena&quot; reproduce asexually through binary fission, a form of cell division. Reproduction begins with the mitosis of the cell nucleus, followed by the division of the cell itself. &quot;Euglena&quot; divide longitudinally, beginning at the front end of the cell, with the duplication of flagellar processes, gullet and stigma. Presently, a cleavage forms in the anterior, and a V-shaped bifurcation gradually moves toward the posterior, until the two halves are entirely separated.

Reports of sexual conjugation are rare, and have not been substantiated.

==Historical background and early classification==

Species of &quot;Euglena&quot; were among the first protists to be seen under the microscope.

In 1674, in a letter to the Royal Society, the Dutch pioneer of microscopy Antonie van Leeuwenhoek wrote that he had collected water samples from an inland lake, in which he found &quot;animalcules&quot; that were &quot;green in the middle, and before and behind white.&quot; Clifford Dobell regards it as &quot;almost certain&quot; that these were &quot;Euglena viridis&quot;, whose &quot;peculiar arrangement of chromatophores...gives the flagellate this appearance at low magnification.&quot;

Twenty-two years later, John Harris published a brief series of &quot;Microscopical Observations&quot; reporting that he had examined &quot;a small Drop of the Green Surface of some Puddle-Water&quot; and found it to be &quot;altogether composed of Animals of several Shapes and Magnitudes.&quot; Among them, were &quot;oval creatures whose middle part was of a Grass Green, but each end Clear and Transparent,&quot; which &quot;would contract and dilate themselves, tumble over and over many times together, and then shoot away like Fish.&quot;

In 1786, O.F. Müller gave a more complete description of the organism, which he named &quot;Cercaria viridis&quot;, noting its distinctive color and changeable body shape. Müller also provided a series of illustrations, accurately depicting the undulating, contractile movements (metaboly) of &quot;Euglena&quot;&#x27;s body.

In 1830, C. G. Ehrenberg renamed Müller&#x27;s &quot;Cercaria&quot; &quot;Euglena viridis&quot;, and placed it, in keeping with the short-lived system of classification he invented, among the Polygastrica in the family Astasiaea: multi-stomached creatures with no alimentary canal, variable body shape but no pseudopods or lorica. By making use of the newly invented achromatic microscope, Ehrenberg was able to see &quot;Euglena&quot;&#x27;s eyespot, which he correctly identified as a &quot;rudimentary eye&quot; (although he reasoned, wrongly, that this meant the creature also had a nervous system). This feature was incorporated into Ehrenberg&#x27;s name for the new genus, constructed from the Greek roots &quot;eu-&quot; (well, good) and glēnē (eyeball, socket of joint).

Ehrenberg did not notice &quot;Euglena&quot;″s flagella, however. The first to publish a record of this feature was Félix Dujardin, who added &quot;filament flagelliforme&quot; to the descriptive criteria of the genus in 1841. Subsequently, the class Flagellata (Cohn, 1853) was created for creatures, like &quot;Euglena&quot;, possessing one or more flagella. While &quot;Flagellata&quot; has fallen from use as a taxon, the notion of using flagella as a phylogenetic criterion remains vigorous.

==Recent phylogeny and classification==

In 1881, Georg Klebs made a primary taxonomic distinction between green and colorless flagellate organisms, separating photosynthetic from heterotrophic euglenoids. The latter (largely colorless, shape-changing uniflagellates) were divided among the Astasiaceae and the Peranemaceae, while flexible green euglenoids were generally assigned to the genus &quot;Euglena&quot;.

As early as 1935, it was recognized that this was an artificial grouping, however convenient. In 1948, Pringsheim affirmed that the distinction between green and colorless flagellates had no taxonomic justification, although he acknowledged its practical appeal. He proposed something of a compromise, placing colorless, saprotrophic euglenoids in the genus &quot;Astasia&quot;, while allowing some colorless euglenoids to share a genus with their photosynthesizing cousins, provided they had structural features that proved common ancestry. Among the green euglenoids themselves, Pringsheim recognized the close kinship of some species of &quot;Phacus&quot; and &quot;Lepocinclis&quot; with some species of &quot;Euglena&quot;.

The idea of classifying the euglenoids by their manner of nourishment was finally abandoned in the 1950s, when A. Hollande published a major revision of the phylum, grouping organisms by shared structural features, such as the number and type of flagella. If any doubt remained, it was dispelled in 1994, when genetic analysis of the non-photosynthesizing euglenoid &quot;Astasia longa&quot; confirmed that this organism retains sequences of DNA inherited from an ancestor that must have had functioning chloroplasts.

In 1997, a morphological and molecular study of the Euglenozoa put &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot; in close kinship with the species &quot;Khawkinea quartana&quot;, with &quot;Peranema trichophorum&quot; basal to both. Two years later, a molecular analysis showed that &quot;E. gracilis&quot; was, in fact, more closely related to &quot;Astasia longa&quot; than to certain other species recognized as &quot;Euglena&quot;. In 2015, Ellis O&#x27;Neill and Professor Rob Field have sequenced the transcriptome of &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot;, which provides information about all of the genes that the organism is actively using. They found that &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot; has a whole host of new, unclassified genes which can make new forms of carbohydrates and natural products.

The species &quot;Euglena viridis&quot; was found to be genetically closer to &quot;Khawkinea quartana&quot; than to the other species of &quot;Euglena&quot; studied. 
Recognizing the polyphyletic nature of the genus &quot;Euglena,&quot; Marin et al. (2003) have revised it to include certain members traditionally placed in &quot;Astasia&quot; and &quot;Khawkinea&quot;.

==Human consumption==
The taste of powdered euglena is described as dried sardine flakes, and contains minerals, vitamins and docosahexaenoic acid, an omega-3 acid. The powder is used as ingredient in other foods. Kemin Industries sells a euglena nutraceutical supplement ingredient featuring dried &quot;Euglena gracilis&quot; with high levels of beta glucan.

==Feedstock for biofuel production==
The lipid content of &quot;Euglena&quot; (mainly wax esters) is seen as a promising feedstock for production of biodiesel and jet fuel. Under the aegis of Itochu, a start-up company called Euglena Co., Ltd. has completed a refinery plant in Yokohama in 2018, with a production capacity of 125 kiloliters of bio jet fuel and biodiesel per year.

<text>Better Than Ezra is an American alternative rock band based in New Orleans, Louisiana, and signed with Round Hill Music. The band formed in 1988 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and consists of Kevin Griffin (vocals and guitar), Tom Drummond (bass guitar), Michael Jerome (drums), and James Arthur Payne Jr. (guitar, keyboards). The band has released nine studio albums, most recently 2024&#x27;s &quot;Super Magick&quot;. They are best known for their 1993 multi-platinum album &quot;Deluxe&quot; and the 1995 single &quot;Good,&quot; which reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart.

== History ==
=== Formation and early success ===
Better Than Ezra was formed in 1988 by vocalist and guitarist Kevin Griffin, lead guitarist Joel Rundell, bassist Tom Drummond, and drummer Cary Bonnecaze. All four members were attending Louisiana State University at the time of Better Than Ezra&#x27;s formation. Better Than Ezra&#x27;s first public performance was at Murphy&#x27;s in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, also in 1988. Though many theories abound, the band refuses to disclose the origin of its name. A possibility is it was a tribute to Joel Rundell&#x27;s grandfather, who was named Ezra. Another possibility is a quote from the novel &quot;Earth Abides&quot; by George R. Stewart. In chapter two of part two, the main character, Ish, remarks to himself that he is better than Ezra, another character, at the task at hand. Fans of the group often refer to themselves as Ezralites.

Better Than Ezra circulated a demo cassette tape later in 1988, the &quot;Chime Street Demo&quot;. While not an official release, this demo is sought after by the band&#x27;s fans, and traded by collectors. In 1990 the band released a cassette-only album, &quot;Surprise&quot;.

Joel Rundell, the band&#x27;s lead guitarist, died by suicide on August 8, 1990. The remaining three members of the band took some time off to reassess its future following Rundell&#x27;s death. However, Griffin, Drummond and Bonnecaze reunited Better Than Ezra as a trio by the end of 1990. The trio continued playing house parties and fraternity shows across the southern United States during the early 1990s.

The band released its first nationally distributed album, &quot;Deluxe&quot;, in 1993 on its own indie label, Swell Records, which caught the attention of major record labels and radio. Better Than Ezra signed with Elektra Records in 1995. Elektra rereleased &quot;Deluxe&quot; in 1995, and the single &quot;Good&quot; reached the No. 1 position on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart which helped push the album to platinum record status by the end of 1995.

Success came quickly to Better Than Ezra. Tom Drummond commented later in a 1998 interview with CNN, &quot;It took us seven years to get signed, and then seven weeks to get to No. 1&quot;, when describing the overnight success of &quot;Deluxe&quot; and its single &quot;Good&quot;.

=== 1996–2000 ===
After &quot;Deluxe&quot; major label release, original drummer Cary Bonnecaze left the band in 1996. He was replaced by drummer Travis McNabb, formerly of the band Vigilantes of Love, who was tapped to play on the band&#x27;s upcoming album, &quot;Friction, Baby&quot;. Bonnecaze&#x27;s departure set off a series of lawsuits and counter-suits between Bonnecaze and Better Than Ezra. Bonnecaze, who took his suit to the United States District Court in New Orleans, argued that the band owed him money &quot;based on his role in fortifying the band&#x27;s reputation,&quot; according to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. He asked for approximately $1 million in damages. A settlement was reached between the band and Bonnecaze on August 5, 1999. The exact terms of the settlement were not released at the time, though Better Than Ezra&#x27;s manager John Isbell was quoted as saying that Bonnecaze received &quot;way less&quot; than the one million dollars he had originally requested.

Better Than Ezra released their second major label album, &quot;Friction, Baby&quot;, in 1996 through Elektra Records. The album produced the hits &quot;Desperately Wanting&quot; and &quot;King of New Orleans&quot;. &quot;Friction, Baby&quot; was not as commercially successful as &quot;Deluxe&quot;, but has sold almost 500,000 units as of 1999.

The trio began work on their third major release, &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot;, soon after the end of touring for &quot;Friction, Baby&quot;. The album was recorded between mid-January and late-April at a studio in New Orleans. The album was produced by record producer Malcolm Burn, who had formerly produced Iggy Pop and U2, and released on August 25, 1998. The album was described as &quot;experimental&quot; and a significant departure from their previous two albums. Griffin described the album in 1998 as &quot;guitar driven ... rhythmic.&quot; Likewise, Tom Drummond described the band&#x27;s thinking on its third major album, &quot;We thought the third album was a very important record, because generally a band either makes or breaks on the third record. We wanted it to be a record that didn&#x27;t necessarily sound like what people expected.&quot; Despite the emphasis on guitar experimentation, two tracks, &quot;One More Murder&quot; and &quot;Je ne m&#x27;en souviens pas&quot; contain no guitars.

The single &quot;At the Stars&quot; debuted, and peaked, at number 78 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band was dropped by Elektra Records following the release of &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot; in 1999.

=== 2000–2008 ===

The band released the B-Sides and rarities collection &quot;Artifakt&quot; on its own &quot;Ezra Dry Goods/Fudge&quot; label in 2000. &quot;Artifakt&quot; was only sold online and at concerts. Tom Drummond, the band&#x27;s bassist, noted in 2002, &quot;It&#x27;s basically an album full of rarities.&quot;

Better Than Ezra, now no longer with Elektra Records, signed with the Beyond Music label and began work on new material. Drummond explained the reasoning for choosing a smaller label, &quot;We decided we wanted to be big fish in a small pond instead of a little fish in a big pond. We just wanted to be with a label who wanted success as much as we did.&quot;

Griffin, Drummond and McNabb spent 18 months working on &quot;Closer&quot;, their follow-up album to 1998&#x27;s &quot;How Does Your Garden Grow?&quot; and their first new material since being dropped by Elektra Records. The album was recorded in New Orleans in the band&#x27;s own studio, which allowed the members to focus on creating music rather than rental costs per day. &quot;Closer&quot; was mixed in Los Angeles by Better Than Ezra and the album&#x27;s producer, Brad Wood. However, the band felt that some tracks needed scratching. Producer Brad Wood&#x27;s management company recommended DJ Swamp, who had previously worked with Beck, to mix several tracks. The use of a DJ for two of the album&#x27;s tracks, the first single &quot;Extra Ordinary&quot; and &quot;Recognize&quot;, marked a departure for the band, who hadn&#x27;t previously employed a DJ before.

&quot;Closer&quot; was released on August 7, 2001. Better Than Ezra launched a tour in support of the album on July 26, 2001. The first single off the album, &quot;Extra Ordinary&quot;, which had been mixed by DJ Swamp, was inspired by an AC/DC song. The album&#x27;s promotion hit a snag after its record label, Beyond Music, was closed down following a business dispute towards the end of 2002, shortly after &quot;Closer&quot; release. Beyond Music&#x27;s closure left &quot;Closer&quot; out of print for several years. In June 2009, Better Than Ezra announced that it had acquired the rights to &quot;Closer&quot; and would re-release it in the Fall of 2009 with two new previously unreleased tracks, &quot;Simple Song&quot; and &quot;Screwed Up and Beautiful.&quot;

In June 2001, Better Than Ezra filmed a series of commercials for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;College GameDay&quot;. The promo features the band while sports analyst Lee Corso crowd surfs to the stage, where he continues his sports reporting.

On September 28, 2004, the band simultaneously released their first live concert DVD, as well as an official live album, both entitled &quot;Live at the House of Blues, New Orleans&quot; through Sanctuary Records. The DVD and album were filmed and recorded at two separate shows at the House of Blues in New Orleans during the summer of 2004.

A Greatest Hits collection was released on March 15, 2005, through Rhino Entertainment, a division of the Warner Music Group.

The band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Before the Robots&quot; (Artemis Records) was released on May 31, 2005. In 2005, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; creator Marc Cherry used the band&#x27;s song &quot;Juicy&quot; as the background music for the second season of the show&#x27;s promotional advertisements, which Griffin credited with bringing attention to the album. The song &quot;Juicy&quot; has also been heard in the background in commercials for Applebee&#x27;s restaurants.

=== Since 2009 ===
Longtime drummer Travis McNabb left Better Than Ezra in February 2009 and their last performance together was Family Gras in Metairie, Louisiana. The primary reason given for his departure was the demand on his time by country and bluegrass group, Sugarland, with whom McNabb had previously been touring for some time. The split was amicable, with bassist Tom Drummond saying, &quot;It&#x27;s bittersweet. He&#x27;s fantastic. We&#x27;re still good friends, and there are no hard feelings. We&#x27;ll miss him. But this is an opportunity he needed to take.&quot; Announced at the same time was McNabb&#x27;s replacement, New Orleans–based drummer Michael Jerome, formerly of the band Pleasure Club. In addition, Better Than Ezra announced the May 12, 2009, release date for their seventh studio album, entitled &quot;Paper Empire&quot;, which is produced by Warren Huart and singer Kevin Griffin. The first single, &quot;Absolutely Still&quot;, was released for iTunes purchase on March 17.

On May 22, 2013, Griffin confirmed that the band plans to release their first new album since 2009 later in the year.

On February 10, 2014, it was announced that the band had signed with The End Records for the release of their eighth studio album. The album, &quot;All Together Now&quot;, was released on September 9, 2014.

On August 29, 2014, the twenty-fifth anniversary edition of &quot;Surprise&quot; was released. According to original drummer Cary Bonnecaze, &quot;The family of Joel Rundell (our original guitarist who passed away in 1990) and I own the original recording, and we thought that with 2014 being the 25th anniversary of its original release, it would be a good time to release it.&quot;

On June 1, 2018, BTE released a new track called &quot;GRATEFUL&quot; via The End Records.

On August 13–14, 2021, Better Than Ezra played a pair of sold-out shows at the House of Blues New Orleans in order to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their second album &quot;Friction, Baby&quot;. During these shows, the band played the album in its entirety, as well as some other fan-favorite songs. A few months later, the band returned to the same venue to play their album &quot;Closer&quot; in its entirety to another sold-out crowd.

In October 2022, during their &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; tour, Griffin revealed that the band would be releasing a new album in 2023. &quot;Mystified&quot;, a single from the forthcoming album, was released on July 18, 2023.
The band&#x27;s latest single, &quot;Contact High,&quot; was released on November 3, 2023.

On March 8, 2024, the band&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Super Magick&quot; was announced, and the single &quot;Live a Little&quot; was released. After some brief delays, Super Magick was released on May 3, 2024, on Round Hill Records.

<text>The Sorcerer is a home computer system released in 1978 by the video game company Exidy, of Sunnyvale, California, and later marketed as a small business computer system under their Exidy Systems subsidiary. Based on the Zilog Z80 and the general layout of the emerging S-100 standard, the Sorcerer was comparatively advanced when released, and especially when compared to the contemporary and more commercially successful Commodore PET and TRS-80. Sorcerer sales worldwide, of around 20,000 units, is comparable to the TRS-80 model II, both targeting Small or Home Business Computer users. The overall concept originated with Paul Terrell, formerly of the Byte Shop, a pioneering computer store. Coincidentally, the TRS-80 model I was designed by Steve Leininger, a former Byte Shop employee.

Lacking financial investment from its parent company, which was focused on the coin-operated arcade game market, and which, unlike Apple, did not wish to seek venture capital, the Sorcerer was sold primarily through international distributors and technology licensing agreements. Distribution agreements were made with Dick Smith Electronics in Australia and Liveport in the UK, as well as with Compudata in the Netherlands, which included a manufacturing license to build, market and distribute the Sorcerer in Europe. Compudata developed the design into the Tulip line of computers in Europe. The Sorcerer remains relatively unknown outside these markets.

After a deal with Recortec (makers of the TRS-80 clone, called variously &quot;Video Genie&quot; or &quot;PMC-80&quot;) fell through in August 1980, Exidy Systems was sold to a Wall Street venture capital firm, Biotech, in summer 1981, which sold it on to Dynasty Computer Corp., Texas, in February, 1982. Dynasty re-branded it as the &quot;smart-ALEC&quot;, and sold around 3,000 bundles. 

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Paul Terrell was operating RepCo in California, selling power supplies and test instruments to electronics manufacturers. A suggestion by Ed Roberts of MITS led Paul to start one of the first personal computer stores, the Byte Shop, in 1975. By 1977, the first store at El Camino Real in Mountain View, had grown into a chain of 58 stores, which Terrell then sold to John Peers of Logical Machine Corporation.

Prior to selling Byte Shop, Terrell had introduced an S-100 based kit called the Byt8, to be sold alongside the MITS Altair and other S-100 compatible systems. 

Terrell, always looking for new ventures, saw a gap in the market for a small business computer that was user-friendly, affordable, came fully equipped, and importantly without the need for any customer-assembly. At the time, the Commodore PET and Tandy TRS-80 offered the out-of-the-box experience he considered essential, yet the TRS-80 required a costly computer monitor, and both machines had low-resolution graphics capabilities. The Apple II had superior graphics and color, but required some user assembly before being operational.

Looking for a suitable name, Terrell noted &quot;Computers are like magic to people, so let&#x27;s give them computer magic with the Sorcerer computer.&quot;

===Design===
From his days at RepCo, Terrell knew H.R. &quot;Pete&quot; Kauffman and Howell Ivy of Exidy, a successful coin-operated arcade game manufacturer. Terrell noted &quot;Their graphic designs with a computer were so good they would take quarters out of my pocket.&quot; Howell, VP of Engineering, was a computer enthusiast and was interested in Terrell&#x27;s concept. From its outset, the Sorcerer design was aimed as a small business computer. The wish list of design improvements over existing designs went like this:

* A keyboard computer that could plug into a television set like the Apple II and TRS-80, but also plug into a computer monitor to display high resolution graphics.
* An easily programmable graphics character set like the Commodore PET, so aspiring programmers could write BASIC language programs with graphical user interfaces, like word processors and spreadsheets. The Sorcerer design was eloquent with the highest resolution in the marketplace, and innovative because the graphic characters could be reprogrammed to represent any kind of 8x8 character the programmer wanted, unlike the fixed graphic character set on the Commodore PET. Howell did such a good job in this area of the design that it was to achieve a “Most Innovative” award at the Consumer Electronics Show after its introduction.
* The fastest microcomputer chip with the most software compatibility in the marketplace. The Exidy Sorcerer used the Z80 Processor from Zilog Corp. (the same as the TRS-80 from Tandy, while the Apple II and Commodore PET used the 6502 processor from MOS Technology) which allowed it to run the same BASIC language software that was becoming one of the first standards in the personal computer industry, Micro-Soft BASIC. Exidy was one of the first companies to license software from Micro-Soft after they parted ways from MITS, Inc. and before they moved from New Mexico to Seattle to become Microsoft.
* Plug-In software cartridges so the computer user could immediately begin using the computer at power-on. The user would not have to load a program from tape or disk to start operating the computer. Exidy would provide three program cartridges under license: Microsoft 8K BASIC, Word Processor Cartridge (which was seen as the “Killer App“ for Exidy, as the Spreadsheet was to Apple), and an Assembler Cartridge (for programmers to write their own custom software for proprietary applications). Blank EEPROM cartridges were provided for custom applications, for which design possibly had in mind foreign language character sets that would have helped to make the Exidy Sorcerer more internationally popular.
* An expansion unit designed to the industry standard S-100 bus so that all of the low cost peripheral products then currently available could be attached to expand the computer system. This would allow a Sorcerer system to expand as its small business user grew.

=== Launch in the US ===
The Sorcerer made its debut at the Long Beach Computer Show on 28 April, 1978. The standard plug-in attachments to the keyboard case (included in the base price of the unit) were a printer port for hard copy devices, cassette port for mass storage, and serial port for communications. Some of these interfaces were included with competing products and some were add-on.

The Exidy Sorcerer was competitively priced at $895 and went to market in Long Beach, California in April 1978 and generated a 4,000 unit back-log on introduction. Shipments did not start until later that summer.

=== Successes outside the US ===
Export of personal computers was complicated by the requirement of US Government State Department approval but this was more than offset by the financial advantage afforded by the customary export terms of sale under letter of credit, yielding immediate cash, as compared to chasing payments from domestic retailers on 30-day credit terms. Exidy was thus keen to concentrate on international sales though recognizing the importance of its US presence for development and marketing purposes.

Exidy took this to another level by licensing production both domestically and internationally, increasing total production and market penetration without calling on cash flow. With its unique programmable character set for foreign language characters, the Exidy Sorcerer was in a league of its own. Advance royalty payments and license fees made this business a priority for Exidy, Inc.

The first Sorcerers sold in the UK were imported direct from the US by a small company based in Cornwall called Liveport Ltd. The base price was . Liveport also eventually designed and built extra plug-in ROM-PAC cartridges and an add-on floppy disk drive (based on Micropolis units) that did not require the expensive S-100 chassis. Sorcerer sales in continental Europe were fairly strong, via their distributor, &quot;Compudata Systems&quot;. The machine had its greatest commercial success in 1979 when the Dutch broadcasting company TELEAC, in a move to be emulated later by the BBC with its BBC Micro, decided to introduce its own home computer. The Belgian company DAI was originally contracted to design the machine but they failed to deliver and Compudata delivered several thousand Sorcerers instead.

Sales in Europe were strong and, when the Dutch Government endorsed computers for small business, Compudata decided to license the Exidy design for local construction in the Netherlands with government support. After several years of Exidy production, Compudata developed their own 16-bit Intel 8088–based machine called the Tulip, replacing the Sorcerer in 1983. One of the largest computing user groups in the Netherlands was the ESGG (Exidy Sorcerer Gebruikers Groep) which published a monthly newsletter in two editions, Dutch and English. For some time, they were the largest group in the HCC (Hobby Computer Club) federation. The Dutch company De Broeders Montfort was a major firmware manufacturer.

The Sorcerer was successful in Australia as a result of strong promotion by its exclusive agent Dick Smith Electronics, though there was price resistance as it was considered beyond the means of most hobbyists. The Sorcerer Computer Users group of Australia (SCUA) actively supported the Sorcerer long after Exidy discontinued it, with RAM upgrades, speed boosts, the &quot;80-column card&quot;, and even a replacement monitor program, SCUAMON.

== Description ==

The Sorcerer design combined elements of the popular MITS-derived S-100 bus architecture, not yet standardised, with custom display and i/o circuitry, all housed within a custom &quot;closed&quot; case. The ROM-pac idea came from Howell Ivy&#x27;s days at Ramtek, where he started working on arcade games before joining Exidy. The machine included the Zilog Z80 and various bus features needed to run the CP/M operating system; a port of CP/M was done by the four-man software team at Exidy led by Vic Tolomei, in consultation with Digital Research. The &quot;closed&quot; case featured a built-in keyboard similar to later machines like the Commodore 64, and the Atari 8-bit computers. The Sorcerer&#x27;s keyboard was a high quality unit with full &quot;throw&quot;. The keyboard included a custom &quot;Graphics&quot; key, which allowed easy entry of the extended character set, without having to overwork the Control key, the more common solution on other machines. Leading its peers, the Sorcerer included lower-case characters in ROM, as well as user-programmable characters stored in RAM.

Unlike most S-100 CP/M machines of its era, the Sorcerer did not have any internal expansion slots, and everything that was needed for basic computing was built-in. A standard video monitor was required for display, and optionally a standard audio cassette deck was needed for data storage. The Sorcerer included a small ROM containing a simple monitor program, written by John Borders, which allowed the machine to be controlled at the machine language level, as well as load programs from cassette tape or cartridges. The cartridges, known as &quot;ROM PAC&quot;s in Exidy-speak, were built by replacing the internal tape in an eight-track tape cartridge with a circuit board and edge connector to interface with the Sorcerer. These allowed the Sorcerer to run applications immediately on start-up, rather than having to load them from tape cassette like its peers.

The machine was usable without any expansion, but if the user wished to use S-100 cards they could do so with an external expansion chassis. This was plugged in via a 50-way ribbon cable to the expansion slot in the rear of the Sorcerer. The Exidy S-100 chassis is a large external cage which included a full set of S-100 slots, allowing the Sorcerer to be used as a &quot;full&quot; S-100 machine. 

Using the same S-100 expansion slot, a user could directly attach floppy disks and boot from them into CP/M (without which the disks were not operable). A later form factor of the Sorcerer combined the floppies, and a small monitor into a single box, that resembled the TRS-80 model II. A Winchester drive was also later offered. 

=== Graphics === 
Graphics on the Sorcerer were impressive, with a resolution of , when most machines of the era supported a maximum of . These lower resolutions were a side effect of the inability of the video hardware to read the screen data from RAM fast enough; given the slow speed of the machines they would end up spending all of their time driving the display. The key to building a usable system was to reduce the total amount of data, either by reducing the resolution, or by reducing the number of colors.

The Sorcerer instead chose another method entirely, which was to use definable character graphics. There were 256 characters to choose from for each screen location. The Sorcerer character set was divided into two halves: the lower half was fixed in ROM and contained the usual ASCII character set; while the upper half was defined in a dedicated region of RAM. This character RAM would be loaded with a default set of graphics from ROM at reset, but could be re-programmed and used in lieu of pixel-addressable graphics. In fact, the machine was actually drawing a display ( pixel characters) which was well within the capabilities of the hardware. However, this meant that all graphics had to lie within a checkerboard pattern on the screen, and the system was generally less flexible than machines with &quot;real&quot; graphics. In addition, the high resolution was well beyond the capability of the average color TV, a problem they solved by not supporting color. In this respect the Sorcerer was similar to the PET and TRS-80 in that it had only &quot;graphics characters&quot; to draw with. Given these limitations, the quality of the graphics on the Sorcerer was otherwise excellent. The programmable character RAM offered significant advantages, which included the ability to provide a form of animation by re-defining individual character bitmaps at runtime. Clever use of several characters for each graphic allowed programmers to create smooth motion on the screen, regardless of the character-cell boundaries. 

=== Sound === 
A more surprising limitation, given the machine&#x27;s genesis, is the lack of sound output. Enterprising developers standardized on use of two pins of the parallel port, to which users were expected to attach a speaker.

=== Software ===
A &quot;Standard BASIC&quot; cartridge was included with the machine. This cartridge was essentially the common Microsoft BASIC already widely used in the CP/M world. One modification was the addition of single-stroke replacements for common BASIC commands, pressing would insert the word codice_1 for instance, allowing for higher-speed entry. The machine included sound in/out ports on the back that could be attached to a cassette tape recorder, so BASIC could load and save programs to tape without needing a disk drive. An &quot;Extended BASIC&quot; cartridge requiring 16 KB was also advertised, but it is unclear if this was actually available; Extended BASIC from Microsoft was available on cassette. Another popular cartridge was the &quot;Word Processor PAC&quot; which contained a version of the early word processor program Spellbinder. 

=== Third Party Add-ons ===
Numerous third party hardware and software applications were developed for the Sorcerer and the S-100 bus. Examples include:
* The Montfort Brothers made an EPROM PAC with a rechargeable battery inside and 16 KB RAM with an external write-protect switch. Thus bootable software could be uploaded to the pack and kept for a longer period.
* Montfort also made a general purpose IO (GPIO) ROM PAC, which includes 8K RAM and an I/O port with individually- or group-addressable I/O lines.

Numerious active user groups, particularly in Australia (SCUA), the Netherlands (ESGG), the U.K. (ESC) and the U.S. (SUG), published regular newsletters including The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice. Many of these can be found in the various internet archives, see links below.

=== RAM expansion ===
Many CP/M machines were designed to allow the full 16-bit address space of 64 KB to be populated by memory. This was problematic on the Exidy Sorcerer. 32 KB could easily be populated. Another 16 KB was the ROM cartridge address space. This could be populated, but required disabling the ROM cartridge capability. The last 16 KB was required by the system for I/O, particularly for the video, and would have required extensive system modification.

== Exidy Systems ==
After the deal to sell the Exidy Data System Division to Recortec fell through in August 1980, Exidy Systems was incorporated in January 1981, with the express purpose to sell the Sorcerer design rights and business unit off. 

Terrell continued to evolve system designs that would grow with small business-users. The System 80 Desktop Computer of 1981 combined the Sorcerer with a 12&quot; display, dot matrix printer and business software, for which the contemporary benchmark was perhaps the Xerox Diablo 3100. This was followed by the Multi-Net 80 also in 1981, using multiple Winchester disk drives, a centralised &quot;timeshare global module&quot; running MP/M and CP/NET, to which up to 16 Sorcerers with a Terminal ROM-pac inserted could inter-connect. These were early networked systems, although it is not clear if any of these were ever sold. This is the timeframe when Exidy Systems was sold to Biotech. Terrell departed Exidy Systems in January 1982.

<doc id="149765" wikidata="Q1426945" url="?curid=149765" title="Labelle">
<text>Labelle was an American funk rock band that originated out of the Blue Belles, a girl group who were a popular vocal group of the 1960s and 1970s. The original group was formed after the disbanding of two rival girl groups in the area around Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, and Trenton, in New Jersey: &quot;the Ordettes&quot; and &quot;the Del-Capris&quot;, forming as a new version of the former group, then later changing their name to the Blue Belles (and further Bluebelles). The founding members were Patti LaBelle (born Patricia Louise Holt), Cindy Birdsong, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash.

As the Bluebelles, and later Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles, the group found success with ballads in the doo-wop genre: &quot;Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;. After Birdsong departed to join The Supremes in 1967, the band, following the advice of Vicki Wickham, changed its look, musical direction, and style to re-form as the progressive soul group Labelle in 1971. Their recordings of that period became cult favorites for dealing with subjects not typically addressed by female black groups. Finally, after adapting glam rock and wearing outlandish space-age and glam costumes, the band found success with the proto-disco smash hit &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; in 1974, leading to the album &quot;Nightbirds&quot; achieving gold success. They were the first contemporary pop group and first black pop band to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House. They were also the first black vocal group to appear on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine.

Each of the band members later went on to begin solo careers after the end of a tour in 1976, going on to have significant solo success. Nona Hendryx followed an idiosyncratic muse into a solo career that often bordered on the avant-garde; but reaching a new audience with the respected 2017 release &quot;Shine&quot;, by Soul Clap, which was a widely played in clubs in the UK, US clubs and Ibiza while being picked and released by the famous record label Defected Records. Sarah Dash became a celebrated session singer; and Patti LaBelle enjoyed a very successful Grammy-winning career, with several top-20 R&amp;B hits between 1982 and 1997, a number-one pop hit with &quot;On My Own&quot;, and lifetime-achievement awards from the Apollo Theatre, World Music Awards, and BET Awards.

The group reunited for their first new album in 32 years, &quot;Back to Now&quot; in 2008. They performed together regularly until the death of Dash on September 20, 2021, at the age of 76.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1960, a sixteen-year-old teenager, Patricia &quot;Patsy&quot; Holte won her first talent contest in a Philadelphia high school. Following this, she sought to form her own singing group the following year called the Ordettes. Holte formed the group with singers Jean Brown, Yvonne Hogen and Johnnie Dawson. The group gained a local following. Dawson was eventually replaced by Sundray Tucker. By 1961, Jean Brown and Yvonne Hogan had ditched the group to get married and Patti and Sundray carried on as soloists.

Later in 1961, Patti and Sundray&#x27;s manager Bernard Montague contacted two singers from the Trenton, New Jersey singing group the Del-Capris, Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash. Eventually Hendryx and Dash became official replacements for Brown and Hogan as the Ordettes. The group soon began working with musician Morris Bailey. Bailey and Montague&#x27;s schedule led to Tucker leaving the group after which another singer, Cindy Birdsong, from Camden New Jersey, joined the group. The grouping of Holte, Dash, Hendryx and Birdsong toured the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, gaining a following in the eastern U.S.

In 1962, Chicago-based group The Starlets had traveled to Philadelphia to do sessions for producer Bobby Martin and record label owner Harold Robinson, president of Newtown Records. One of the sessions included a cover of the standard, &quot;I Sold My Heart to the Junkman&quot;. At the time of the song&#x27;s release, the group had a hit with the song &quot;Better Tell Him No&quot; and were unable to promote the song due to them being signed to another label. The song was credited under the name &quot;The Blue Belles&quot;. The Ordettes auditioned by singing the song. Before hearing the group, Robinson turned them down due to being unimpressed with Patti&#x27;s looks but upon hearing her singing, he changed his mind and signed the group to Newtown.

When &quot;I Sold My Heart&quot; became popular, Robinson sent the Ordettes to promote it under the assumed name of the Blue Belles. After a televised performance at &quot;American Bandstand&quot; featuring the Ordettes, the Starlets&#x27; manager sued Harold Robinson and Bobby Martin. Around the same time, Robinson was also sued for having another group use the name &quot;Blue Belles&quot;. Following the aftermath of the ordeals, Robinson gave Patti Holte a new name, &quot;Patti LaBelle&quot;, and the group&#x27;s name was rechristened as Patti LaBelle and The Blue Belles.

===Sweethearts of the Apollo===
Following several releases such as &quot;Academy Award&quot; and &quot;Tear After Tear&quot;, the group recorded their first national hit under their new name in 1963 with the release of the ballad, &quot;Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)&quot;, first released under Newtown, before it received national distribution from King Records. As a result, the record reached the top 40 on both the pop and R&amp;B charts, formally launching the group to national stardom. Frequent performances at the Apollo Theater helped to give the group the nickname &quot;Sweethearts of the Apollo&quot;. Newtown released two albums on the group before Harold Robinson sold Newtown in 1963. Cameo-Parkway soon signed them and re-released the Newtown single, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, at the end of the year. The record became another top-40 hit for the group in 1964 and became one of Patti LaBelle&#x27;s first signature performances. They later recorded another charted hit with &quot;Danny Boy&quot;. In 1965, the group opened for the Rolling Stones during a lengthy American tour. Shortly afterwards, Atlantic Records signed the act to the label, in hopes of bringing the group mainstream success. Their first Atlantic single, &quot;All or Nothing&quot;, briefly made a dent on the pop charts in 1966. They had a notable entry as background singers of Wilson Pickett&#x27;s first major hit, &quot;634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)&quot;. In 1966, Atlantic released the group&#x27;s first studio album, &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, which included &quot;All or Nothing&quot; and the title track, later to be a standard for Patti.

Around this time, the group also began touring Europe, mainly in the UK, where they performed on the show, &quot;Ready, Steady, Go&quot;. During club performances, the group was backed up musically by a pub band called Bluesology, whose pianist was a teenager named Reg Dwight, later known as Elton John. Following the UK tour, the group kept in touch with one of the show&#x27;s producers, Vicki Wickham. In early 1967, the group had another charted single with the song &quot;Take Me for a Little While&quot; and released their second Atlantic album, &quot;Dreamer&quot;. Around this time, Aretha Franklin had signed with Atlantic Records, leading Atlantic to focus its efforts on her rather than on the Blue Belles. That same year, Cindy Birdsong abruptly left the group to join The Supremes, replacing original member Florence Ballard. After completing a tour where Sundray Tucker briefly rejoined the group to fill in for Birdsong, the remaining members carried on as a trio.

As grittier soul and heavy rock dominated much of Atlantic&#x27;s time, the group was let go from their contract in 1970. Bernard Montague, who was managing groups such as The Delfonics, also left them, leaving them seeking new managers. After nearly signing a contract with Herb Hamlett and Frankie Crocker, they eventually picked Vicki Wickham to work with them. Wickham later credited Dusty Springfield with convincing her to hire the group to perform on &quot;Ready, Steady, Go&quot; in London.

===Reinvention===
Wickham advised the group to move to London and change their entire image and sound, much to the chagrin of Patti LaBelle, who feared the group would alienate their older fans with a new laid back &quot;earthier&quot; look. Wickham also advised them to change their name to simply &quot;Labelle&quot;. Ditching the wigs and dresses, Labelle settled on Afros and jeans. They debuted this new look while backing The Who during a stop in New York. Following this, Labelle signed a contract with Track Records, The Who&#x27;s label, which received distribution from Warner Bros. Records. In 1971, the group released their first album, simply titled &quot;Labelle&quot;, quickly following it up with the 1972 album &quot;Moon Shadow&quot;. The albums featured the group bringing in gospel soul renditions of rock hits such as &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. While not commercially successful, the albums were critically acclaimed and established the act as a progressive soul unit, recording more daring material such as &quot;Morning Much Better&quot; and &quot;Touch Me All Over&quot;.

In 1971, Labelle were invited to record backing vocals to a covers album being recorded by Laura Nyro. The resulting album, &quot;Gonna Take a Miracle&quot;, led to the group reaching the charts for the first time and establishing a rapport with Nyro, who later invited them to perform with her at Carnegie Hall. In 1973, they recorded an album for RCA Records titled &quot;Pressure Cookin&#x27;&quot;, featuring a wildly interpretive covers medley of the songs &quot;Something in the Air&quot; and &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;. It was around this time that Labelle changed up their act again. Under the advice of Larry LeGaspi, the group began performing in space suits, feathers, and studded costumes.

===Success===
In 1974, Wickham had the group signed to Epic Records where they recorded their breakthrough album, &quot;Nightbirds&quot;, in New Orleans with producer Allen Toussaint. While Hendryx eventually wrote the majority of the album, Epic released the Kenny Nolan and Bob Crewe composition &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; as a single in August 1974. The song&#x27;s rock-soul mixture helped the song to sell to listeners and by March 1975, the song had become the group&#x27;s first number-one single, reaching the top of both the Billboard Hot 100 and the R&amp;B singles chart. It also became an international hit. The album also included the follow-up hit &quot;What Can I Do for You?&quot;.

&quot;Nightbirds&quot; eventually sold more than one million copies and was certified gold. During the album&#x27;s promotion, the group became the first rock group to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House. Wickham billed the October 6, 1974 performance &quot;Wear Something Silver&quot;, to adapt to Labelle&#x27;s own silver-colored space outfits, worn by Patti LaBelle. Building on their success, in the spring of 1975, Labelle became the first African-American vocal group to make the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Later in 1975, the group released a critically acclaimed follow-up, &quot;Phoenix&quot;. That same year, the group contributed background vocals to several songs on Elton John&#x27;s hit album, &quot;Rock of the Westies&quot;. In 1976, they released their third album for Epic, &quot;Chameleon&quot;, which included the tracks &quot;Get You Somebody New&quot;, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Shame&quot; and &quot;Who&#x27;s Watching the Watcher&quot;.

===Breakup===
Despite critical acclaim for their follow-ups to the &quot;Nightbirds&quot; album, &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Chameleon&quot; failed to repeat the success of &quot;Nightbirds&quot; as the group struggled to have another hit. By 1976, tensions had developed within the group, with the act&#x27;s three members splintered on its sound and direction. Patti LaBelle had wanted the group to record more soul, Nona Hendryx wanted the group to go further into funk rock, and Sarah Dash wanted to record songs in a more disco direction.

During a show in Baltimore on December 3, 1976, Hendryx wandered off the stage and into the audience at the beginning of &quot;(Can I Speak To You Before You Go To) Hollywood&quot;. Labelle&#x27;s stage manager was able to steer Hendryx backstage, but Hendryx locked herself in her dressing room and beat her head against the wall until it began to bleed severely. She was removed from the theater in restraints.

After the incident, LaBelle advised the group to disband, fearing for the other members&#x27; well-being and that the mounting tension could also put an end to their friendship. Hendryx and Dash agreed and the trio formally announced their split at the end of 1976 after fourteen years together.

===Solo careers and reunions===
Following her departure from the Blue Belles, Cindy Birdsong enjoyed success as member of The Supremes, singing on hits such as &quot;Up the Ladder to the Roof&quot;, &quot;Stoned Love&quot;, &quot;Nathan Jones&quot; and &quot;Floy Joy&quot;. Birdsong left the group in 1972 to start a family, returned in 1973, then left again in 1976, and thereafter only recorded sporadically as a solo artist in the 80s, briefly joining The Former Ladies of the Supremes alongside former Supremes members Jean Terrell and Scherrie Payne.

The Labelle song &quot;(Can I Speak to You Before You Go To) Hollywood&quot;, from &quot;Pressure Cookin&quot;&#x27;, was allegedly written by Hendryx as a response to Birdsong&#x27;s departure, featuring each member of the group singing verses. Sarah Dash found some solo success after signing with Don Kirshner&#x27;s label, with the disco single &quot;Sinner Man&quot;. Dash eventually sang backup for the Rolling Stones and sang for Keith Richards&#x27; spinoff group X-pensive Winos. The more experimental Nona Hendryx has recorded in various genres including hard rock, hip-hop, house and new age, and charting with the singles, &quot;Keep It Confidential&quot; and &quot;Why Should I Cry?&quot; Patti LaBelle became an international solo superstar following Labelle&#x27;s breakup, recording crossover hits such as &quot;New Attitude&quot;, &quot;Stir It Up&quot; and &quot;On My Own&quot;, resulting in Grammy wins and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

In 1991, Patti LaBelle reunited with Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash on the track, &quot;Release Yourself&quot;, from LaBelle&#x27;s Grammy-winning album, &quot;Burnin&quot;. The trio reunited onstage at the Apollo Theater in 1991 to perform the song on LaBelle&#x27;s second concert performance video while promoting the release of &quot;Burnin&quot;&#x27;. In addition to &quot;Release Yourself&quot;, Hendryx and LaBelle composed the gospel-flavored ballad &quot;When You&#x27;ve Been Blessed (Feels Like Heaven)&quot;. In 1995, the trio reunited again for the dance single, &quot;Turn it Out&quot;, for the soundtrack to the film, &quot;To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar.&quot; The song became their first charted hit in nineteen years peaking at number-one on the Billboard dance singles chart. Four years later, the original Blue Belles (including Cindy Birdsong) reunited to receive an award from the R&amp;B Foundation for Lifetime Achievement. In 2006, the trio of LaBelle, Dash and Hendrix briefly came together to record a Hendryx-written track called &quot;Dear Rosa&quot; for the soundtrack to a film called &quot;Preaching to the Choir.&quot; In 2008, Labelle announced their reunion and released their first studio album in 32 years, the critically acclaimed &quot;Back to Now&quot;.

That year, the trio went back on tour together which carried through the spring of 2009. In an interview with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Patti LaBelle explained why she, Dash and Hendryx waited over 32 years to record a full-length album: &quot;You don&#x27;t want to half-step something this important...it was about finding the right time and place. We were never ones to do anything on anyone else&#x27;s time anyway; we were always unconventional. I still have my glitter boots to prove it.&quot;

The group performed a triumphant show at the Apollo Theatre in New York City on December 19, 2008. They continued to perform with each other sporadically; Dash sang with Patti LaBelle at a LaBelle concert two days before her death on September 20, 2021.

==Legacy and influence==
Years after their breakup in 1976, Labelle&#x27;s influence has been reflected by groups such as En Vogue, Destiny&#x27;s Child and The Pussycat Dolls, who recorded the Labelle hit, &quot;Far As We Felt Like Goin&#x27;&quot; from the &quot;Phoenix&quot; album. Their biggest hit, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; continues to be covered, with its successful covers being renditions by All Saints and the Grammy-winning number-one hit collaboration between singers Christina Aguilera, Pink and Mýa and rapper Lil&#x27; Kim in 2001 (recorded for the &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; soundtrack.) The song was also covered by Madchester-era indie group The Happy Mondays, who spliced it with &quot;Kinky Afro&quot;. The group&#x27;s 1960s hit, &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, was covered by Sam Harris (who also covered their rendition of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;), and sampled by Kanye West in an early version of his song, &quot;Homecoming&quot; (which sampled the group&#x27;s &quot;walk on&quot; intro) while their 1970s hit, &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Shame&quot; was sampled by Nelly on his song, &quot;My Place&quot;. Their 1973 song, &quot;Goin&#x27; On a Holiday&quot;, was also sampled in several hip-hop songs (sampling the group&#x27;s vocal bridge, &quot;goin&#x27;, goin&#x27;, goin&#x27;, goin&#x27;...on...&quot;).

The group has been called pioneers of the disco movement for the proto-disco singles &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; and &quot;Messin&#x27; With My Mind&quot;. In turn, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; has been also called one of the first mainstream disco hits (Jones and Kantonen, 1999). In 2003, &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; was inducted to the Grammy Hall of Fame. In 2009, their songs &quot;It Took a Long Time&quot; and &quot;System&quot; were featured in Lee Daniels&#x27; film &quot;Precious&quot;.

<text>Microsoft BASIC is the foundation software product of the Microsoft company and evolved into a line of BASIC interpreters and compiler(s) adapted for many different microcomputers. It first appeared in 1975 as Altair BASIC, which was the first version of BASIC published by Microsoft as well as the first high-level programming language available for the Altair 8800 microcomputer.

During the home computer craze of the late-1970s and early-1980s, BASIC was ported to and supplied with many home computer designs. Slight variations to add support for machine-specific functions, especially graphics, led to a profusion of related designs like Commodore BASIC and Atari Microsoft BASIC.

As the early home computers gave way to newer designs like the IBM Personal Computer and Macintosh, BASIC was no longer as widely used, although it retained a strong following. The release of Visual Basic reboosted its popularity and it remains in wide use on Microsoft Windows platforms in its most recent incarnation, Visual Basic .NET.

==Altair BASIC and early microcomputers==
The Altair BASIC interpreter was developed by Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates using a self-written Intel 8080 emulator running on a PDP-10 minicomputer. The MS dialect is patterned on Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s BASIC-PLUS on the PDP-10, which Gates had used in high school. The first versions supported integer math only, but Monte Davidoff convinced them that floating-point arithmetic was possible, and wrote a library which became the Microsoft Binary Format.

Microsoft BASIC family of 8-bit interpreters (Altair BASIC, TRS-80 BASIC, etc), features and commands inspired by DEC&#x27;s PDP-10 BASIC-PLUS include: the single byte tokens for keywords, % for integers, $ for strings, 4-byte floating points Microsoft Binary Format, : statement separator, # for file handles, random file access (FIELD, GET, PUT, LSET, RSET), and more. Microsoft&#x27;s BASIC builtin line editor, the EDIT command, was inspired by the TOPS-10 EDIT text editor&#x27;s Alter subcommand.

Altair BASIC was delivered on paper tape and in its original version took 4 KB of memory. The following functions and statements were available:

codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23, codice_24, and codice_25.

There were no string variables in 4K BASIC and single-precision 32-bit floating point was the only numeric type supported. Variable names consisted of one letter (A–Z) or one letter followed by one digit (0–9), thus allowing up to 286 numeric variables.

For machines with more memory, the 8 KB version added 31 additional statements and support for string variables and their related operations like MID$ and string concatenation. String variables were denoted with a $ suffix, which remained in later versions of the language. Later on, Microsoft released the 12K Extended BASIC, which included double precision 64-bit variables, codice_26...codice_27...codice_28 structures, user defined functions, more advanced program editing commands, and descriptive error messages as opposed to error numbers. Numeric variables now had three basic types, % denoted 16-bit integers, # denoted 64-bit doubles, and ! denoted 32-bit singles, but this was the default format so the ! is rarely seen in programs.

The extended 8 KB version was then generalized into BASIC-80 (8080/85, Z80), and ported into BASIC-68 (6800), BASIC-69 (6809), and 6502-BASIC. The 6502 had somewhat less dense assembler code and expanded in size to just under 8K for the single precision version, or 9K for a version using an intermediate 40-bit floating point format in place of the original 32-bit version. This new 40-bit format became the most common as it was used on most 6502-based machines of the era. It was also ported to the 16-bit BASIC-86 (8086/88).

The final major release of BASIC-80 was version 5.x, which appeared in 1981 and added support for 40-character variable names, codice_29...codice_30 loops, dynamic string allocation, and several other features. BASIC 5.x removed the ability to crunch program lines.

The core command set and syntax are the same in all implementations of Microsoft BASIC and, generally speaking, a program can be run on any version if it does not use hardware-specific features or double precision numbers (not supported in some implementations).

==Licenses to home computer makers==
After the initial success of Altair BASIC, Microsoft BASIC became the basis for a lucrative software licensing business, being ported to the majority of the numerous home and other personal computers of the 1970s and especially the 1980s, and extended along the way. Contrary to the original Altair BASIC, most home computer BASICs are resident in ROM, and thus are available on the machines at power-on in the form of the characteristic &quot;codice_31&quot;. prompt. Hence, Microsoft&#x27;s and other variants of BASIC constitute a significant and visible part of the user interface of many home computers&#x27; rudimentary operating systems.

Microsoft used its DECsystem-20 to produce assembly code for dozens of different computer systems and CPUs from the same source code, using conditional compilation. By 1981, Microsoft BASIC was so popular that even companies that already had a BASIC licensed the language, such as IBM for its Personal Computer, and Atari, which sold both Atari Microsoft BASIC and its own Atari BASIC. IBM&#x27;s Don Estridge said, &quot;Microsoft BASIC had hundreds of thousands of users around the world. How are you going to argue with that?&quot; Microsoft licensed similar versions to companies that competed with each other. After licensing IBM Advanced BASIC (BASICA) to IBM, for example, Microsoft licensed the compatible GW-BASIC to makers of PC clones, and sold copies to retail customers. The company similarly licensed an Applesoft-compatible BASIC to VTech for its Laser 128 clone.

===Extended BASIC-80===

* Tangerine Microtan 65
* Spectravideo SV-318 and SV-328

Known variants:
* &quot;NCR Basic Plus 6&quot;, released in the first quarter of 1977 for the NCR 7200 model VI data-entry terminal. The adaptation of Microsoft&#x27;s Extended BASIC-80 was carried out by Marc McDonald in 1976/1977.

===Disk BASIC-80===

MBASIC is available for CP/M-80 and ISIS-II. Also available for TEKDOS.

MBASIC is a stripped-down BASIC-80 with only hardware-neutral functions. However, due to the popularity of CP/M, the great majority of Z80 machines ran MBASIC, rather than a version customized for specific hardware (TRS-80 BASIC was one of the few exceptions). Microsoft&#x27;s CP/M card for the Apple II included a modified version of MBASIC that incorporated some of the graphics commands from Applesoft BASIC, such as codice_32, but the full command set is not supported.

===Standalone Disk BASIC-80===

The first implementation to use an 8-bit variant of the File Allocation Table (FAT) was a BASIC adaptation for an Intel 8080-based NCR 7200, 7520, or 7530 data-entry terminal with 8-inch floppy disks in 1977/1978.

===BASIC compiler===
Microsoft offered a BASIC compiler for BASIC-80 under CP/M, by 1980 or before. The compiler executable was named BASCOM or BASCOM32.

===TRS-80 Level II/III BASIC===
The TRS-80 computer was offered initially with an adaption of Li-Chen Wang&#x27;s Tiny BASIC (Level I BASIC); within a few months this was replaced by a port of BASIC-80 which incorporated some of Level I BASIC&#x27;s command set, particularly the commands for setting graphics characters. Level II BASIC contained some of the features of Extended BASIC, although due to the need to include Level I commands such as codice_33 and codice_34, other features such as descriptive error messages still had to be left out; these were subsequently added into TRS-80 Disk BASIC.

The TRS-80 Model 4 had a newer disk-based BASIC that utilized the BASIC-80 5.x core, which included support for 40-character variable names. Thus the ability to crunch program lines (without spaces between keywords and arguments) was no longer possible as it had been in Level II. It was no longer necessary to reserve string space. New features included user defined functions (codice_35) and access to TRSDOS 6 system functions via a codice_36 keyword. A modified version published later by OS provider Logical Systems, in the LS-DOS Version 6.3 update, added single-letter access to BASIC control functions (like codice_1 and codice_38) and direct access to LS-DOS supervisor calls. The program edit environment was still line-oriented. The facility available in Level II to sort arrays (codice_39) was not available; programmers and users had to devise their own workarounds.

===BASIC-86===
The first implementation as a standalone disk-based language system was for Seattle Computer Products S-100 bus 8086 CPU card in 1979. It was utilizing an 8-bit FAT file system.

Microsoft also offered a version of Standalone BASIC-86 for SBC-86/12 for Intel&#x27;s 8086 Single Board Computer platform in 1980.

===Texas Instruments BASIC===
This is the version of BASIC used on the TI-99/4A home computer. Although very similar to Microsoft BASIC, it was not written by Microsoft as was widely rumored. According to TI Engineer H. Schuurman, &quot;They (in the form of Bob Greenberg of Microsoft) were contracted to develop BASIC for the SR-70 (which is also sometimes referred to as the 99/7), but the BASIC for the 99/4 was developed in-house.&quot; TI-99/4 BASIC was based on Dartmouth BASIC and complies to the American National Standard for minimal BASIC (ANSI X3.60-1978).

===6502 BASIC===
Microsoft ported BASIC-80 to the 6502 during the summer of 1976; it was mostly a straight port of the 8K version of BASIC-80 and included the same prompts asking for memory size and if the user wanted floating point functions enabled or not (having them active used an extra 135 bytes of memory). The earliest machines to use 6502 BASIC were the Ohio Scientific Model 500 and KIM-1 in 1977. 6502 BASIC included certain features from Extended BASIC such as user-defined functions and descriptive error messages, but omitted other features like double precision variables and the codice_3 codice_41 statement. As compensation for not having double precision variables, Microsoft included 40-bit floating point support instead of BASIC-80&#x27;s 32-bit floating point and string allocation was dynamic (thus the user did not have to reserve string space like in BASIC-80). However, vendors could still request BASIC with 32-bit floating point for a slightly smaller memory footprint; as one example, Disk BASIC for the Atari 8-bits used 32-bit floating point rather than 40-bit.

Standard features of the 9K version of Microsoft 6502 BASIC included:

* codice_42 statement to detect a key press.
* Line crunching program lines do not require any spaces except between the line number and statement.
* Only supported variable types are character string, single precision floating point, and 16-bit signed integer (saves space in arrays, otherwise useless and slower than floating point, as all calculations are done in floating point anyway).
* Long variable names can be used, but only the first two characters are significant.
* Dynamic string allocation.

6502 BASIC lacked a standardized set of commands for disk and printer output; these were up to the vendor to add and varied widely with each implementation.

Later implementations of 6502 Basic (1983–) had many vendor specific improvements; for example later versions of Commodore BASIC had the following:
* Disk commands (codice_43, codice_44, codice_45, codice_46, codice_47, codice_48, codice_49, codice_50, codice_51, codice_52, codice_53, etc.)
* Graphics commands (codice_54, codice_55, codice_56, codice_57 (of background, border, etc.), codice_58, codice_59)
* Graphics block copy and logical operation with the existing graphical screen (codice_60 and codice_61 with codice_62, codice_63, codice_64, etc.)
* Sprite definition, displaying and animation commands on C128, even saving sprites to binaries
* Sound commands (codice_65, codice_66), later on at C=128 Music commands (ADSR and SID filter programming (codice_67 and codice_68), codice_69, codice_70 commands)
* Signs of more structured programming: codice_26–codice_27–codice_28, codice_74–codice_75–codice_29/codice_77–codice_78.
* Extended I/O commands for special features: codice_79, function keys

===BASIC-68 and BASIC-69===
Microsoft catalogs from the 1980s also showed the availability of BASIC-68 and BASIC-69 for the Motorola 6800 and 6809 microprocessors respectively, running the FLEX operating systems, and also mention OEM versions for Perkin-Elmer, Ohio Nuclear, Pertec and Societe Occitane d&#x27;Electronique systems.
It seems likely this is what is also the basis for the Microsoft/Epson BASIC in the Epson HX-20 portable computer, which has two Hitachi 6301 CPUs, which are essentially a &quot;souped up&quot; 6801. Most of the core features in BASIC-68 and BASIC-69 were copied directly from BASIC-80.

BASIC-69 was notably also licensed to Tandy, where it formed the nucleus of Color BASIC on the TRS-80 Color Computer. Not to be confused with BASIC09, a very different BASIC created by Microware as the main language for its OS-9, the other OS available on the Color Computer (Microware also wrote version 2.0 of Extended Color BASIC when Microsoft refused to do it). Microsoft BASIC was also included in the Dragon 32 / 64 computers that were built in Wales and enjoyed some limited success in the UK home computer market in the early 1980s. Dragon computers were somewhat compatible with the Tandy TRS-80, as they were built on very similar hardware.

===MSX===
Microsoft produced a ROM-based MSX BASIC for use in MSX home computers, which used a Z80 processor. This version supported the graphics and sound systems of the MSX computers; some variants also had support for disk drives.

==Modern descendants==
No variety of Microsoft BASIC (BASICA, GW-BASIC, QuickBasic, QBasic) is currently distributed with Microsoft Windows or DOS. However, versions that will still run on modern machines can be downloaded from various Internet sites or be found on old DOS disks.

The latest incarnation of Microsoft BASIC is Visual Basic .NET, which incorporates some features from C++ and C# and can be used to develop Web forms, Windows forms, console applications and server-based applications. Most .NET code samples are presented in VB.NET as well as C#, and VB.NET continues to be favored by former Visual Basic programmers.

In October 2008, Microsoft released Small Basic. The language has only 14 keywords. Small Basic Version 1.0 (12 June 2011) was released with an updated Microsoft MSDN Web site that included a full teacher curriculum, a Getting Started Guide, and several e-books. Small Basic exists to help students as young as age eight learn the foundations of computer programming and then graduate to Visual Basic via the downloadable software, Visual Studio Express, where they can continue to build on the foundation by learning Visual C#, VB.NET, and Visual C++.

<doc id="149769" wikidata="Q1112860" url="?curid=149769" title="Excretory system">
<text>The excretory system is a passive biological system that removes excess, unnecessary materials from the body fluids of an organism, so as to help maintain internal chemical homeostasis and prevent damage to the body. The dual function of excretory systems is the elimination of the waste products of metabolism and to drain the body of used up and broken down components in a liquid and gaseous state. In humans and other amniotes (mammals, birds and reptiles), most of these substances leave the body as urine and to some degree exhalation, mammals also expel them through sweating.

Only the organs specifically used for the excretion are considered a part of the excretory system. In the narrow sense, the term refers to the urinary system. However, as excretion involves several functions that are only superficially related, it is not usually used in more formal classifications of anatomy or function.

As most healthy functioning organs produce metabolic and other wastes, the entire organism depends on the function of the system. Breaking down of one of more of the systems is a serious health condition, for example kidney failure.

==Systems==
===Urinary system===

The kidneys are large, bean-shaped organs which are present on each side of the vertebral column in the abdominal cavity. Humans have two kidneys that are supplied with blood from the renal artery. The kidneys remove from the blood the nitrogenous wastes such as urea, as well as salts and excess water, and excrete them in the form of urine. This is done with the help of millions of nephrons present in the kidney. The renal vein (or kidney vein) carries the filtrated blood away from the kidneys. Urine passes from the kidneys though the ureters to the urinary bladder and is ejected through the urethra during urination.

==== Kidneys ====
The kidney&#x27;s primary function is the elimination of waste from the bloodstream by production of urine. They perform several homeostatic functions such as:-

# Maintain volume of extracellular fluid
# Maintain ionic balance in extracellular fluid
# Maintain pH and osmotic concentration of the extracellular fluid.
# Excrete toxic metabolic by-products such as urea, ammonia, and uric acid.

The way the kidneys do this is with nephrons. There are over 1 million nephrons in each kidney; these nephrons act as filters inside the kidneys. The kidneys filter needed materials and waste. Needed materials go back into the bloodstream; unneeded materials become urine and are expelled through the urethra.

In some cases, excess wastes crystallize as kidney stones. They grow and can become painful irritants that may require surgery or ultrasound treatments. Some stones are small enough to be forced into the urethra.

==== Ureter ====
The ureters are muscular ducts that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. In the human adult, the ureters are usually 25–30 cm (10–12 in) long. In humans, the ureters arise from the renal pelvis on the medial aspect of each kidney before descending towards the bladder on the front of the psoas major muscle. The ureters cross the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the iliac arteries (which they run over). This &quot;pelviureteric junction&quot; is a common site for the impaction of kidney stones (the other being the uteterovesical valve). The ureters run posteriorly on the lateral walls of the pelvis. They then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the back, at the vesicoureteric junction, running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimeters. The backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as ureterovesical valves. In the female, the ureters pass to the bladder through the mesometrium.

==== Urinary bladder ====
The urinary bladder is the organ that collects urine from the kidneys. It is a hollow muscular, and distensible (or elastic) organ, and sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra during urination.

Embryologically, the bladder is derived from the urogenital sinus, and it is initially continuous with the allantois. In human males, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis. It is superior to the prostate, and separated from the rectum by the rectovesical excavation. In females, the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina. It is separated from the uterus by the vesicouterine excavation. In infants and young children, the urinary bladder is in the abdomen even when empty.

==== Urethra ====
The urethra is a tube which transports urine from the urinary bladder to the outside of the body through the penis or vulval vestibule. In placental mammals, the urethra also transports semen through the penis during ejaculation.

===Respiratory system===

One of the main functions of the lungs is to diffuse gaseous wastes, such as carbon dioxide, from the bloodstream as a normal part of respiration.

===Gastrointestinal tract===

The large intestine&#x27;s main function is to transport food particles through the body and expel the indigestible parts at the other end, but it also collects waste from throughout the body. The typical brown colour of mammal waste is due to bilirubin, a breakdown product of normal heme catabolism. The lower part of the large intestine also extracts any remaining usable water and then removes solid waste. At about 10 feet long in humans, it transports the wastes through the tubes to be excreted.

===Biliary system===

The liver detoxifies and breaks down chemicals, poisons and other toxins that enter the body. For example, the liver transforms ammonia (which is poisonous) into urea in fish, amphibians and mammals, and into uric acid in birds and reptiles. Urea is filtered by the kidney into urine or through the gills in fish and tadpoles. Uric acid is paste-like and expelled as a semi-solid waste (the &quot;white&quot; in bird excrements). The liver also produces bile, and the body uses bile to break down fats into usable fats and unusable waste.

Invertebrates lack a liver, but most terrestrial groups, like insects, possesses a number of blind guts that serve the similar functions. Marine invertebrates do not need the ammonia conversion of the liver, as they can usually expel ammonia directly by diffusion through the skin.

===Integumentary system===
==== Skin ====
Sweat glands in the skin secrete a fluid waste called sweat or perspiration; however, its primary functions are temperature control and pheromone release. Therefore, its role as a part of the excretory system is minimal. Sweating also maintains the level of salt in the body.

Mammals excrete sweat through sweat glands in the skin throughout the body. The sweat, helped by salt, evaporates and helps to keep the body cool when it is warm. In amphibians, the lungs are very simple, and they lack the necessary means to the exhale like other tetrapods can. The moist, scale-less skin is therefore essential in helping to rid the blood of carbon dioxide, and also allows for urea to be expelled through diffusion when submerged.

In small-bodied marine invertebrates, the skin is the most important excretory organ. That is particularly true for acoelomate groups like cnidarians, flatworms and nemerteans, who have no body cavities and hence no body fluid that can be drained or purified by nephrons, which is the reason acoelomate animals are thread-like (nemertans), flat (flatworms) or only consist of a thin layer of cells around a gelatinous non-cellular interior (cnidarians).

==== Eccrine ====
Like sweat glands, eccrine glands allow excess water to leave the body. The majority of eccrine glands are located mainly on the forehead, the bottoms of the feet, and the palms, although the glands are everywhere throughout the body. They help the body to maintain temperature control. Eccrine glands in the skin are unique to mammals.

Secretions of sweat from the eccrine glands play a large role in controlling the body temperature of humans. Regulation of body temperature, also known as thermoregulation, is very important when it comes to instances that bring the body&#x27;s temperature outside of the homeostatic temperature such as with a fever or even exercise. Together these glands make up the size of about one kidney and in one day a human can perspire amounts as much as 10 liters. The two functions consist of secretion of a filtrate in response to acetylcholine and reabsorption of sodium near the duct when there is water in excess so that a sweat can be surfacing the skin.

There are three parts to the eccrine sweat gland and these are the pore, the duct, and the gland. The pore is the portion that goes through the outermost layer of the skin and is typically 5-10 microns in diameter. The duct is the part of the sweat gland that connects dermis cells to the epidermis. It is composed by two layers of cells and is between 10 and 20 microns in diameter. The gland does the actual secretion and it lies deep within the dermis. The cells that make up the gland are larger in size than the duct cells and its lumen is around 20 microns in diameter.

==Substances==
=== Bile ===

After bile is produced in the liver, it is stored in the gall bladder. It is then secreted within the small intestine where it helps to emulsify fats in the same manner as a soap. Bile also contains bilirubin, which is a waste product.

Bile salts can be considered waste that is useful for the body given that they have a role in fat absorption from the stomach. They are excreted from the liver and along with blood flow they help to form the shape of the liver where they are excreted. For instance, if biliary drainage is impaired than that part of the liver will end up wasting away.

Biliary obstruction is typically due to masses blocking the ducts of the system such as tumors. The consequences of this depend on the site of blockage and how long it goes on for. There is inflammation of the ducts due to the irritation from the bile acids and this can cause infections. If rupture of the duct takes place it is very traumatic and even fatal.

=== Urine ===

Within the kidney, blood first passes through the afferent artery to the capillary formation called a glomerulus and is collected in the Bowman&#x27;s capsule, which filters the blood from its contents—primarily food and wastes. After the filtration process, the blood then returns to collect the food nutrients it needs, while the wastes pass into the collecting duct, to the renal pelvis, and to the ureter and are then secreted out of the body via the urinary bladder.

==Clinical significance==

=== Kidney stones ===
Scientifically, masses referred to as a renal calculus or nephrolith, or more commonly, &quot;kidney stones&quot;, are solid masses of crystals that may be a variety of shapes, sizes, and textures, that can reside within one or both of the kidneys. Kidney stones form when the balance is off between the concentration of substances that pass through urine, and the substances that are supposed to dissolve them. When substances are not properly dissolved, they have the ability to build up, and form these kidney stones. These stones are most commonly made up of substances such as calcium, cystine, oxalate, and uric acid, as these are the substances that normally would dissolve within the urine. When they do not dissolve correctly and further build up, they will commonly lodge themselves in the urinary tract and in this case, are usually small enough to pass through urine. In extreme situations, however, these stones may lodge themselves within the tube that connects the kidney and the bladder, called the ureter. In this case, they become very large in size and will most likely cause great pain, bleeding, and possibly even block the flow of urine. These can occur in both men and women, and studies show that around 12% of men, and 8% of women in America will develop kidney stones within their lifetime.

==== Treatment ====
In those extreme situations, in which kidney stones are too large to pass on their own, patients may seek removal. Most of these treatments involving kidney stone removal are done by a urologist; a physician who specializes in the organs of the urinary system. A common way of removal is shock wave lithotripsy, in which the urologist will shock the kidney stone into smaller pieces via laser, allowing these pieces to further pass through the urine on their own, as a normal case of kidney stones. Larger, more serious cases may demand Cystoscopy, Ureteroscopy, or Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy, in which the doctor will use a viewing tool or camera to locate the stone, and based on the size or situation, may either chose to continue with surgical removal, or use the shock wave lithotripsy treatment. Once the kidney stone(s) are successfully eliminated, the urologist will commonly suggest medication to prevent future recurrences.

=== Pyelonephritis ===
Pyelonephritis is a type of urinary tract infection that occurs when bacteria enters the body through the urinary tract. It causes an inflammation of the renal parenchyma, calyces, and pelvis. There are three main classifications of pyelonephritis: acute, chronic and xanthogranulomatous.

==== Acute pyelonephritis ====
In acute pyelonephritis, the patient experiences high fever, abdominal pain and pain while passing urine. Treatment for acute pyelonephritis is provided via antibiotics and an extensive urological investigation is conducted to find any abnormalities and prevent recurrence.

==== Chronic pyelonephritis ====
In chronic pyelonephritis, patients experience persistent abdominal and flank pain, high fever, decreased appetite, weight loss, urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine. Chronic pyelonephritis can also lead to scarring of the renal parenchyma caused by recurrent kidney infections.

==== Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis ====
Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is an unusual form of chronic pyelonephritis. It results in severe destruction of the kidney and causes granulomatous abscess formation. Patients infected with Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis experience recurrent fevers, anemia, kidney stones and loss of function in the affected kidney.

==== Treatment ====
A urine culture and antibiotics sensitivity test is issued for patients who are believed to have pyelonephritis. Since most cases of pyelonephritis are caused from bacterial infections, antibiotics are a common treatment option. Depending on the species of the infecting organism and the antibiotics sensitivity profile of the organism, treatments may include fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or trimethoprim individually or in combination. For patients with xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis, treatment might include antibiotics as well as surgery. Nephrectomy is the most common surgical treatment for a majority of cases involving xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis.

==== Epidemiology ====
In men, roughly 2-3 cases per 10,000 are treated as outpatients and 1 in 10,000 cases require admission to the hospital. In women, approximately 12–13 in 10,000 cases are treated as outpatients and 3-4 cases are admitted to a hospital. The most common age group affected by Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is middle-aged women. Infants and elderly are also at an increased risk because of hormonal and anatomical changes.

<doc id="149773" wikidata="Q153316" url="?curid=149773" title="Battle of Crete">
<text>The Battle of Crete (, ), codenamed Operation Mercury (), was a major Axis airborne and amphibious operation during World War II to capture the island of Crete. It began on the morning of 20 May 1941, with multiple German airborne landings on Crete. Greek and other Allied forces, along with Cretan civilians, defended the island. After only one day of fighting, the Germans had suffered heavy casualties and the Allied troops were confident that they would defeat the invasion. The next day, through communication failures, Allied tactical hesitation, and German offensive operations, Maleme Airfield in western Crete fell, enabling the Germans to land reinforcements and overwhelm the defensive positions on the north of the island. Allied forces withdrew to the south coast. More than half were evacuated by the British Royal Navy and the remainder surrendered or joined the Cretan resistance. The defence of Crete evolved into a costly naval engagement; by the end of the campaign the Royal Navy&#x27;s eastern Mediterranean strength had been reduced to only two battleships and three cruisers.

The Battle of Crete was the first occasion where Fallschirmjäger (German paratroops) were used &quot;en masse&quot;, the first mainly airborne invasion in military history, the first time the Allies made significant use of intelligence from decrypted German messages from the Enigma machine, and the first time German troops encountered mass resistance from a civilian population. Due to the number of casualties and the belief that airborne forces no longer had the advantage of surprise, Adolf Hitler became reluctant to authorise further large airborne operations, preferring instead to employ paratroopers as ground troops. In contrast, the Allies were impressed by the potential of paratroopers and started to form airborne-assault and airfield-defence regiments.
==Background==

British forces had initially garrisoned Crete when the Italians attacked Greece on 28 October 1940, enabling the Greek government to employ the Fifth Cretan Division in the mainland campaign. This arrangement suited the British: Crete could provide the Royal Navy with excellent harbours in the eastern Mediterranean, from which it could threaten the Axis south-eastern flank, and the Ploiești oil fields in Romania would be within range of British bombers based on the island.

The Italians were repulsed, but the subsequent German invasion of April 1941 (Operation Marita), succeeded in overrunning mainland Greece. At the end of the month, 57,000 Allied troops were evacuated by the Royal Navy. Some were sent to Crete to bolster its garrison until fresh forces could be organised, although most had lost their heavy equipment. Winston Churchill, the British prime minister, sent a telegram to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir John Dill: &quot;To lose Crete because we had not sufficient bulk of forces there would be a crime.&quot;

The German Army High Command (&quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot;, OKH) was preoccupied with Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, and was largely opposed to a German attack on Crete. However, Hitler remained concerned about attacks in other theatres, in particular on his Romanian fuel supply, and Luftwaffe commanders were enthusiastic about the idea of seizing Crete by a daring airborne attack. The desire to regain prestige after their defeat by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in the Battle of Britain the year before, may also have played a role in their thinking, especially before the advent of the much more important invasion of the Soviet Union. Hitler was won over by the audacious proposal and in Directive 31 he asserted that &quot;Crete... will be the operational base from which to carry on the air war in the Eastern Mediterranean, in co-ordination with the situation in North Africa.&quot; The directive also stated that the operation was to be in May and must not be allowed to interfere with the planned campaign against the Soviet Union. Before the invasion, the Germans conducted a bombing campaign to establish air superiority and forced the RAF to move its remaining aeroplanes to Alexandria in Egypt.

==Prelude==
===Order of battle===
====Allied forces====
No RAF units were based permanently at Crete until April 1941, but airfield construction had begun, radar sites had been built and stores delivered. Equipment was scarce in the Mediterranean and in the backwater of Crete. The British forces had seven commanders in seven months. In early April, airfields at Maleme and Heraklion and the landing strip at Rethymno on the north coast were ready and another strip at Pediada-Kastelli was nearly finished. After the German invasion of Greece, the role of the Crete garrison changed from the defence of a naval anchorage to preparing to repel an invasion. On 17 April, Group Captain George Beamish was appointed Senior Air Officer, Crete, taking over from a flight-lieutenant whose duties and instructions had been only vaguely defined. Beamish was ordered to prepare the reception of the Bristol Blenheim bombers of 30 and 203 squadrons from Egypt and the remaining fighter aircraft from Greece, to cover the evacuation of W Force, which enabled the transfer of and Dominion troops to the island, preparatory to their relief by fresh troops from Egypt.

The navy tried to deliver of supplies from 1941, but Luftwaffe attacks forced most ships to turn back, and only were delivered. Only about British and Greek soldiers were on the island, and the defence devolved to the shaken and poorly equipped troops from Greece, assisted by the last fighters of 33, 80 and 112 squadrons and a squadron of the Fleet Air Arm, once the Blenheims were ordered back to Egypt. In mid-May, the four squadrons had about two dozen aircraft, of which only about twelve were serviceable due to a lack of tools and spares. The unfinished ground at Pediada-Kastelli was blocked with trenches and heaps of soil and all but narrow flight paths were blocked at Heraklion and Rethymno by barrels full of earth. At Maleme, blast pens were built for the aircraft, and barrels full of petrol were kept ready to be ignited by machine-gun fire. Around each ground, a few field guns, anti-aircraft guns, two infantry tanks and two or three light tanks were sited. The three areas were made into independent sectors, but there were only eight QF 3-inch and twenty Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft guns.
On 30 April 1941, Major-general Bernard Freyberg VC a New Zealand Army officer, was appointed commander of the Allied forces on Crete (Creforce). He was Churchill&#x27;s personal choice, as the British Prime Minister admired his loyalty and the bravery he had shown during the First World War. By May, the Greek forces consisted of approximately three battalions of the 5th Greek Division, which had been left behind when the rest of the unit had been transferred to the mainland against the German invasion; the Cretan Gendarmerie (2,500 men); the Heraklion Garrison Battalion, a defence unit made up mostly of transport and supply personnel; and remnants of the 12th and 20th Greek divisions, which had also escaped from the mainland to Crete and were organised under British command. Cadets from the Gendarmerie academy and recruits from Greek training centres in the Peloponnese had been transferred to Crete to replace the trained soldiers sent to fight on the mainland. These troops were already organised into numbered recruit training regiments, and it was decided to use this structure to organise the Greek troops, supplementing them with experienced men arriving from the mainland.

The British Commonwealth contingent consisted of the original British garrison and another and Commonwealth troops evacuated from the mainland. These evacuees were a combination of intact units, composite units improvised locally, stragglers from every type of army unit, and deserters; most of them lacked heavy equipment. The main formed units were the 2nd New Zealand Division, less the 6th Brigade and division headquarters; the 19th Australian Brigade Group; and the 14th Infantry Brigade of the British 6th Division. There were about 15,000 front-line Commonwealth infantry, augmented by about 5,000 non-infantry personnel equipped as infantry and a composite Australian artillery battery. On 4 May, Freyberg sent a message to the British commander in the Middle East, General Archibald Wavell, requesting the evacuation of about 10,000 unwanted personnel who did not have weapons and had &quot;little or no employment other than getting into trouble with the civil population&quot;. As the weeks passed, some 3,200 British, 2,500 Australian and 1,300 New Zealander troops were evacuated to Egypt, but it became evident that it would not be possible to remove all the unwanted troops. Between the night of 15 May and morning of 16 May, the allied forces were reinforced by the 2nd Battalion of the Leicester Regiment, which had been transported from Alexandria to Heraklion by and .

On 17 May, the garrison on Crete included about 15,000 Britons, 7,750 New Zealanders, 6,500 Australians and 10,200 Greeks. On the morning of 19 May, these were augmented by a further 700 men of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, who had been transported from Alexandria to Tymbaki overnight by .

====Axis forces====
On 25 April, Hitler signed Directive 28, ordering the invasion of Crete. The Royal Navy retained control of the waters around Crete, so an amphibious assault would have been a risky proposition. With German air superiority assured, an airborne invasion was chosen. This was to be the first big airborne invasion, although the Germans had made smaller parachute and glider-borne assaults in the invasions of Denmark and Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, France and mainland Greece. In Greece, had been dispatched to capture the bridge over the Corinth Canal, which was being readied for demolition by the Royal Engineers. German engineers landed near the bridge in gliders, while parachute infantry attacked the perimeter defence. The bridge was damaged in the fighting, which slowed the German advance and gave the Allies time to evacuate 18,000 troops to Crete and 23,000 to Egypt, albeit with the loss of most of their heavy equipment.
In May, &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI moved from Germany to the Athens area, but the destruction wrought during the invasion of Greece forced a postponement of the attack to 20 May. New airfields were built, and 280 long-range bombers, and 40 reconnaissance aircraft of &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII were assembled, along with transport aircraft and 100 gliders. The and &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bombers were based on forward airfields at Molaoi, Melos and Karpathos (then Scarpanto), with Corinth and Argos as base airfields. The were based at airfields near Athens, Argos and Corinth, all within of Crete, and the bomber or reconnaissance machines were accommodated at Athens, Salonica and a detachment on Rhodes, along with bases in Bulgaria at Sofia and Plovdiv, ten of the airfields being all-weather and from Crete. The transport aircraft flew from bases near Athens and southern Greece, including Eleusis, Tatoi, Megara and Corinth. British night bombers attacked the areas in the last few nights before the invasion, and Luftwaffe aircraft eliminated the British aircraft on Crete.
The Germans planned to use to capture important points on the island, including airfields that could then be used to fly in supplies and reinforcements. &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI was to co-ordinate the attack by the 7th &quot;Flieger&quot; Division, which would land by parachute and glider, followed by the 22nd Air Landing Division once the airfields were secure. The operation was scheduled for 16 May 1941, but was postponed to 20 May, with the 5th Mountain Division replacing the 22nd Air Landing Division. To support the German attack on Crete, eleven Italian submarines took post off Crete or the British bases of Sollum and Alexandria in Egypt.

===Intelligence===
====British====
Major-General Kurt Student did not add an attack on Crete to Operation Marita until March 1941; supply difficulties delayed the assembly of &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI and its then more delays forced a postponement until 20 May 1941. The War Cabinet in Britain had expected the Germans to use paratroops in the Balkans, and on 25 March, British decrypts of Luftwaffe Enigma wireless traffic revealed that &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI was assembling Ju 52s for glider-towing, and British Military Intelligence reported that were already in the Balkans. On 30 March, &quot;Detachment Süssmann&quot;, part of the 7th &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot;, was identified at Plovdiv. Notice of the target of these units did not arrive, but on 18 April it was found that had been withdrawn from routine operations, and on 24 April it became known that Göring had reserved them for a special operation. The operation turned out to be a descent on the Corinth Canal on 26 April, but then a second operation was discovered and that supplies (particularly of fuel), had to be delivered to &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI by 5 May; a Luftwaffe message referring to Crete for the first time was decrypted on 26 April.

The British Chiefs of Staff were apprehensive that the target could be changed to Cyprus or Syria as a route into Iraq during the Anglo-Iraqi War 1941) and suspected that references to Crete were a deception, despite having no grounds for this, and on 3 May Churchill thought that the attack might be a decoy. The command in Crete had been informed on 18 April, despite the doubts, and Crete was added to a link from the GC &amp; CS to Cairo, while on 16 and 21 April, intelligence that airborne operations were being prepared in Bulgaria was passed on. On 22 April, the HQ in Crete was ordered to burn all material received through the Ultra link, but Churchill ruled that the information must still be provided. When Freyberg took over on 30 April, the information was disguised as information from a spy in Athens. Remaining doubts about an attack on Crete were removed on 1 May, when the Luftwaffe was ordered to stop bombing airfields on the island and mining Souda Bay and to photograph all of the island. By 5 May it was clear that the attack was not imminent and, next day, 17 May was revealed as the expected day for the completion of preparations, along with the operation orders for the plan from the D-day landings in the vicinity of Maleme and Chania, Heraklion, and Rethymno.

====German====

Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, originally reported 5,000 British troops on Crete and no Greek forces. It is not clear whether Canaris, who had an extensive intelligence network at his disposal, was misinformed or was attempting to sabotage Hitler&#x27;s plans (Canaris was killed much later in the war for supposedly participating in the 20 July Plot). &quot;Abwehr&quot; also predicted the Cretan population would welcome the Germans as liberators, due to their strong republican and anti-monarchist feelings and would want to receive the &quot;... favourable terms which had been arranged on the mainland ...&quot; While Eleftherios Venizelos, the late republican prime minister of Greece, had been a Cretan and support for his ideas was strong on the island, the Germans seriously underestimated Cretan loyalty. King George and his entourage escaped from Greece via Crete with the help of Greek and Commonwealth soldiers, Cretan civilians, and even a band of prisoners who had been released from captivity by the Germans. 12th Army Intelligence painted a less optimistic picture, but also underestimated the number of British Commonwealth forces and the number of Greek troops who had been evacuated from the mainland. General Alexander Löhr, the theatre commander, was convinced the island could be taken with two divisions, but decided to keep 6th Mountain Division in Athens as a reserve.

===Weapons and equipment===
====German====
The Germans used the new 7.5 cm &quot;Leichtgeschütz&quot; 40 light gun (a recoilless rifle). At , it weighed as much as a standard German 75 mm field gun, yet had of its range. It fired a shell more than . A quarter of the German paratroops jumped with an MP 40 submachine gun, often carried with a bolt-action &quot;Karabiner&quot; 98k rifle and most German squads had an MG 34 machine gun. The Germans used colour-coded parachutes to distinguish the canisters carrying rifles, ammunition, crew-served weapons and other supplies. Heavy equipment like the &quot;Leichtgeschütz 40&quot; were dropped with a special triple-parachute harness to bear the extra weight.

The troops also carried special strips of cloth to unfurl in patterns to signal to low-flying fighters, to co-ordinate air support and for supply drops. The German procedure was for individual weapons to be dropped in canisters, due to their practice of exiting the aircraft at low altitude. This was a flaw that left the paratroopers armed only with knives, pistols and grenades in the first few minutes after landing. Poor design of German parachutes compounded the problem; the standard German harness had only one riser to the canopy and could not be steered. Even the 25 percent of paratroops armed with sub-machine guns were at a disadvantage, given the weapon&#x27;s limited range. Many &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; were shot before they reached weapons canisters.

====Greek====
Greek troops were armed with &quot;Mannlicher–Schönauer&quot; 6.5 mm mountain carbines or ex-Austrian 8x56R &quot;Steyr-Mannlicher M1895&quot; rifles, the latter a part of post-World War I reparations; about 1,000 Greeks carried antique &quot;Fusil Gras mle 1874&quot; rifles. The garrison had been stripped of its best crew-served weapons, which were sent to the mainland; there were twelve obsolescent &quot;St. Étienne Mle 1907&quot; light machine-guns and forty miscellaneous LMGs. Many Greek soldiers had fewer than thirty rounds of ammunition but could not be supplied by the British, who had no stocks in the correct calibres. Those with insufficient ammunition were posted to the eastern sector of Crete, where the Germans were not expected in force. The 8th Greek Regiment was under strength and many soldiers were poorly trained and poorly equipped. The unit was attached to 10th New Zealand Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Howard Kippenberger), who placed it in a defensive position around the village of Alikianos where, with local civilian volunteers, they held out against the German 7th Engineer Battalion.

Though Kippenberger had referred to them as &quot;...nothing more than malaria-ridden little chaps...with only four weeks of service,&quot; the Greek troops repulsed German attacks until they ran out of ammunition, whereupon they began charging with fixed bayonets, overrunning German positions and capturing rifles and ammunition. The engineers had to be reinforced by two battalions of German paratroops, yet the 8th Regiment held on until 27 May, when the Germans made a combined arms assault by Luftwaffe aircraft and mountain troops. The Greek stand helped to protect the retreat of the Commonwealth forces, who were evacuated at Sfakia. Beevor and McDougal Stewart write that the defence of Alikianos gained at least 24 more hours for the completion of the final leg of the evacuation behind Layforce. The troops who were protected as they withdrew had begun the battle with more and better equipment than the 8th Greek Regiment.

====British Commonwealth====
British and Commonwealth troops used the standard Lee–Enfield rifle, Bren light machine gun and Vickers medium machine gun. The British had about 85 artillery pieces of various calibres, many of them captured Italian weapons without sights. Anti-aircraft defences consisted of one light anti-aircraft battery equipped with 20 mm automatic cannon, split between the two airfields. The guns were camouflaged, often in nearby olive groves, and some were ordered to hold their fire during the initial assault to mask their positions from German fighters and dive-bombers. The British had nine Matilda IIA infantry tanks of &quot;B&quot; Squadron, 7th Royal Tank Regiment (7th RTR) and sixteen Light Tanks Mark VIB from &quot;C&quot; Squadron, 3rd King&#x27;s Own Hussars.

The Matildas had 40 mm Ordnance QF 2 pounder guns, which only fired armour-piercing rounds – not effective anti-personnel weapons. (High explosive rounds in small calibres were considered impractical). The tanks were in poor mechanical condition, as the engines were worn and could not be overhauled on Crete. Most tanks were used as mobile pillboxes to be brought up and dug in at strategic points. One Matilda had a damaged turret crank that allowed it to turn clockwise only. Many British tanks broke down in the rough terrain, not in combat. The British and their allies did not possess sufficient Universal Carriers or trucks, which would have provided the mobility and firepower needed for rapid counter-attacks before the invaders could consolidate.

===Strategy and tactics===
====Operation Mercury====

Hitler authorised &quot;Unternehmen Merkur&quot; (named after the swift Roman god Mercury) with Directive 28; the forces used were to come from airborne and air units already in the area and units intended for &quot;Unternehmen Barbarossa&quot; were to conclude operations before the end of May, &quot;Barbarossa&quot; was not to be delayed by the attack on Crete, which had to begin soon or would be cancelled. Planning was rushed and much of &quot;Unternehmen Merkur&quot; was improvised, including the use of troops who were not trained for airborne assaults. The Germans planned to capture Maleme, but there was debate over the concentration of forces there and the number to be deployed against other objectives, such as the smaller airfields at Heraklion and Rethymno. The Luftwaffe commander, Colonel General Alexander Löhr, and the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; commander, Admiral Karlgeorg Schuster, wanted more emphasis on Maleme, to achieve overwhelming superiority of force. Student wanted to disperse the paratroops more, to maximise the effect of surprise. As the primary objective, Maleme offered several advantages: it was the largest airfield and big enough for heavy transport aircraft, it was close enough to the mainland for air cover from land-based Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters and it was near the north coast, so seaborne reinforcements could be brought up quickly. A compromise plan by Hermann Göring was agreed, and in the final draft, Maleme was to be captured first, while not ignoring the other objectives.

The invasion force was divided into &quot;Kampfgruppen&quot; (battlegroups), Centre, West and East, each with a code name following the classical theme established by Mercury; 750 glider-borne troops, 10,000 paratroops, 5,000 airlifted mountain soldiers and 7,000 seaborne troops were allocated to the invasion. The largest proportion of the forces were in Group West. German airborne theory was based on parachuting a small force onto enemy airfields. The force would capture the perimeter and local anti-aircraft guns, allowing a much larger force to land by glider. Freyberg knew this after studying earlier German operations and decided to make the airfields unusable for landing, but was countermanded by the Middle East Command in Alexandria. The staff felt the invasion was doomed now that it had been compromised and may have wanted the airfields intact for the RAF once the invasion was defeated. The Germans were able to land reinforcements without fully operational airfields. One transport pilot crash-landed on a beach, others landed in fields, discharged their cargo and took off again. With the Germans willing to sacrifice some transport aircraft to win the battle, it is not clear whether a decision to destroy the airfields would have made any difference, particularly given the number of troops delivered by expendable gliders.

==Battle==
===20 May===
====Maleme–Chania sector====
At 08:00 on 20 May 1941, German paratroopers, jumping out of dozens of Junkers Ju 52 aircraft, landed near Maleme Airfield and the town of Chania. The 21st, 22nd and 23rd New Zealand battalions held Maleme Airfield and the vicinity. The Germans suffered many casualties in the first hours of the invasion: a company of III Battalion, 1st Assault Regiment lost 112 killed out of 126 men, and 400 of 600 men in III Battalion were killed on the first day. Most of the parachutists were engaged by New Zealanders defending the airfield and by Greek forces near Chania. Many gliders following the paratroops were hit by mortar fire seconds after landing, and the New Zealand and Greek defenders almost annihilated the glider troops who landed safely.

Some paratroopers and gliders missed their objectives near both airfields and set up defensive positions to the west of Maleme Airfield and in &quot;Prison Valley&quot; near Chania. Both forces were contained and failed to take the airfields, but the defenders had to deploy to face them. Towards the evening of 20 May, the Germans slowly pushed the New Zealanders back from Hill 107, which overlooked the airfield. Greek police and cadets took part, with the 1st Greek Regiment (Provisional) combining with armed civilians to rout a detachment of German paratroopers dropped at Kastelli. The 8th Greek Regiment and elements of the Cretan forces severely hampered movement by the 95th Reconnaissance Battalion on Kolimbari and Paleochora, where Allied reinforcements from North Africa could be landed.

====Rethymno–Heraklion sector====
A second wave of German transports supported by Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica attack aircraft, arrived in the afternoon, dropping more paratroopers and gliders containing assault troops. One group attacked at Rethymno at 16:15 and another attacked at Heraklion at 17:30, where the defenders were waiting for them and inflicted many casualties.

The Rethymno–Heraklion sector was defended by the British 14th Brigade, as well as the 2/4th Australian Infantry Battalion and the Greek 3rd, 7th and &quot;Garrison&quot; (ex-5th Crete Division) battalions. The Greeks lacked equipment and supplies, particularly the Garrison Battalion. The Germans pierced the defensive cordon around Heraklion on the first day, seizing the Greek barracks on the west edge of the town and capturing the docks; the Greeks counter-attacked and recaptured both points. The Germans dropped leaflets threatening dire consequences if the Allies did not surrender immediately. The next day, Heraklion was heavily bombed and the depleted Greek units were relieved and assumed a defensive position on the road to Knossos.

As night fell, none of the German objectives had been secured. Of 493 German transport aircraft used during the airdrop, seven were lost to anti-aircraft fire. The bold plan to attack in four places to maximise surprise, rather than concentrating on one, seemed to have failed, although the reasons were unknown to the Germans at the time.

Among the paratroopers who landed on the first day was former world heavyweight champion boxer Max Schmeling, who held the rank of &quot;Gefreiter&quot; at the time. Schmeling survived the battle and the war.

===21 May===
Overnight, the 22nd New Zealand Infantry Battalion withdrew from Hill 107, leaving Maleme Airfield undefended. During the previous day, the Germans had cut communications between the two westernmost companies of the battalion and the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew VC, who was on the eastern side of the airfield. The lack of communication was assumed to mean that the battalion had been overrun in the west. With the weakened state of the eastern elements of the battalion and believing the western elements to have been overrun, Andrew requested reinforcement by the 23rd Battalion. Brigadier James Hargest denied the request on the mistaken grounds that the 23rd Battalion was busy repulsing parachutists in its sector. After a failed counter-attack late in the day on 20 May, with the eastern elements of his battalion, Andrew withdrew under cover of darkness to regroup, with the consent of Hargest. Captain Campbell, commanding the westernmost company of the 22nd Battalion, out of contact with Andrew, did not learn of the withdrawal of the 22nd Battalion until early in the morning, at which point he also withdrew from the west of the airfield. This misunderstanding, representative of the failings of communication and co-ordination in the defence of Crete, cost the Allies the airfield and allowed the Germans to reinforce their invasion force unopposed. In Athens, Student decided to concentrate on Maleme on 21 May, as this was the area where the most progress had been made and because an early morning reconnaissance flight over Maleme Airfield was unopposed. The Germans quickly exploited the withdrawal from Hill 107 to take control of Maleme Airfield, just as a sea landing took place nearby. The Allies continued to bombard the area as flew in units of the 5th Mountain Division at night.

====Maleme Airfield counter-attack====

In the afternoon of 21 May 1941, Freyberg ordered a counter-attack to retake Maleme Airfield during the night of 21/22 May. The 2/7th Battalion was to move north to relieve the 20th Battalion, which would participate in the attack. The 2/7th Battalion had no transport, and vehicles for the battalion were delayed by German aircraft. By the time the battalion moved north to relieve 20th Battalion for the counter-attack, it was 23:30, and the 20th Battalion took three hours to reach the staging area, with its first elements arriving around 02:45. The counter-attack began at 03:30 but failed because of German daylight air support. (Brigadier George Alan Vasey and Lieutenant-Colonel William Cremor have criticised Freyberg for not properly defending Maleme Airfield.) Hargest also blamed Freyberg for the loss of the airfield.

====Axis landing attempt, 21/22 May====
An Axis convoy of around 20 caïques, escorted by the , tried to land German reinforcements near Maleme. Force D under Rear-Admiral Irvine Glennie, with three light cruisers and four destroyers, intercepted the convoy before midnight; the convoy turned back with the loss of more than half of its boats, despite &quot;Lupo&quot;&#x27;s defence. The attacking British force suffered only slight damage on cruiser caused by friendly fire. About of the German force of more than 2,000 men was saved by the Italian naval commander, Francesco Mimbelli, against an overwhelmingly superior Allied naval force. A total of 297 German soldiers, two Italian seamen and two British sailors on &quot;Orion&quot; were killed. Eight caiques were caught and sunk, while at least another six managed to get away, along with three Italian escorting motor-sailing boats. Only one caïque and one cutter from the convoy reached Crete. The caïque landed 3 officers and 110 German soldiers near Cape Spatha, while the cutter arrived safely in Akrotiri, where her crew was engaged by a British Army patrol and took heavy casualties. Of the German soldiers who landed at Akrotiri, only one managed to get through the British lines and join the German paratroopers already fighting for Chania. According to other authors, only one German officer and 35 men from the 100th Regiment landed from the caïque that arrived in Crete.

===22 May===
====Maleme====
The defending force organised for a night counter-attack on Maleme by two New Zealand battalions, the 20th Battalion of the 4th Brigade and the 28th Maori Battalion of the 5th Brigade. A New Zealand officer present at the battle claimed a long delay ordering the planned counter-attack turned a night attack into a day attack, which led to its failure. Fears of a sea landing meant that a number of units that could have taken part in the attack were left in place, although this possibility was removed by the Royal Navy which arrived too late for the plans to be changed. The delayed counter-attack on the airfield came in daylight on 22 May, when the troops faced &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers, dug-in paratroops and mountain troops. The attack slowly petered out and failed to retake the airfield, which forced the defenders into withdrawals to the eastern end of the island, to avoid being out-flanked.

====Axis landing attempt, 22/23 May====
Admiral Andrew Cunningham sent Force C (three cruisers and four destroyers, commanded by Rear Admiral Edward Leigh Stuart King) into the Aegean Sea through the Kasos Strait, to attack a second flotilla of transports, escorted by the Italian torpedo boat . The force sank an isolated &quot;caïque&quot; at 08:30, saving itself from an air attack that struck the cruiser as the German pilots tried to avoid killing their troops in the water. The British squadron was under constant air attack and, short of anti-aircraft ammunition, steamed on toward Milos, sighting &quot;Sagittario&quot; at 10:00. King made the &quot;difficult&quot; decision not to press the attack, despite his overpowering advantage, because of the shortage of ammunition and the severity of the air attacks. The transports were defended by a torpedo charge by &quot;Sagittario&quot;, which also laid a smoke screen and traded fire with the British force, trying to lure them to a different direction. Indeed, King was unaware that a major enemy convoy was ahead of his force until 11:00. Eventually, the convoy and its escort managed to slip away undamaged. King&#x27;s ships, despite their failure to destroy the German troop transports, had succeeded in forcing the Axis to abort the landing by their mere presence at sea. During the search and withdrawal from the area, Force C suffered many losses to German bombers. &quot;Naiad&quot; was damaged by near misses and the cruiser was hit. Cunningham later criticised King, saying that the safest place during the air attack was amongst the flotilla of &quot;caïque&quot;s.

While Force C made its attack on the convoy, Force A1 (Rear Admiral H B Rawlings), Force B (Captain Henry A Rowley) and Glennie&#x27;s Force D converged west of Antikythera. Concerned about the level of anti-aircraft ammunition available following repeated air attacks, the combined force was ordered to report on their stock of high-angle ammunition at 09:31. Of the cruisers, had 40 per cent, &quot;Orion&quot; 38 per cent, &quot;Fiji&quot; 30 per cent, 25 per cent and &quot;Gloucester&quot; only 18 per cent. &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Dido&quot; were ordered to return to Alexandria with Glennie&#x27;s Force D to rearm but &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot; remained with Rawlings&#x27; Force A1.

At 12:25 Force A1, stationed 20 to 30 miles west of Antikythera, received a request from King to support the damaged &quot;Naiad.&quot; Force A1 headed east into the Kythera Channel, rendezvousing with Force C between 13:30 and 14:00. As the more senior admiral, King took command, with air attacks now inflicting damage on both forces. A bomb struck and the destroyer was sunk. King sent and to pick up survivors, while the cruisers &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Gloucester&quot; were ordered respectively at 14:02 and 14:07 to provide anti-aircraft support. Writing in despatches after the battle, Cunningham stated that King was unaware of the shortage of anti-aircraft ammunition in &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot;. At 14:13 King and Rawlings exchanged messages about the shortage of ammunition within both Force C and Force A1, with Rawlings expressing concern about the orders given to &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot;. Following this communication, King issued an order to recall both &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot; at 14:57.

Between 15:30 and 15:50, while attempting to rejoin Force A1, &quot;Gloucester&quot; was hit by several bombs and had to be left behind due to the air attacks; the ship was sunk and 22 officers and 700 ratings were killed. The air attacks on Force A1 and Force C continued; two bombs hit the battleship and another hit &quot;Fiji&quot;, disabling her at 18:45. A Junkers Ju 88 flown by Lieutenant Gerhard Brenner dropped three bombs on &quot;Fiji&quot;, sinking her at 20:15. Five hundred survivors were rescued by &quot;Kandahar&quot; and &quot;Kingston&quot; that night. The Royal Navy had lost two cruisers and a destroyer but had managed to force the invasion fleet to turn round. Royal Navy AA gunners shot down five Junkers Ju 87s and five Ju 88s and damaged sixteen more, some of which crash-landed upon their return to base on the night of 21/22 May.

===23–27 May===

Fighting against fresh German troops, the Allies retreated southward. The 5th Destroyer Flotilla, consisting of , , , and (Captain, Lord Louis Mountbatten), was ordered to leave Malta on 21 May, to join the fleet off Crete, and arrived after &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot; were sunk. They were sent to pick up survivors and then diverted to attack a German convoy of about fifty ships and &quot;caïque&quot;s off Cape Spatha on Rodopou peninsula, western Crete, on the night of 22/23 May and then shell the Germans at Maleme. &quot;Kelvin&quot; and &quot;Jackal&quot; were diverted to another search while Mountbatten, with &quot;Kelly&quot;, &quot;Kashmir&quot; and &quot;Kipling&quot;, was to go to Alexandria.

When rounding the western side of Crete, the three ships were attacked by 24 Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers. &quot;Kashmir&quot; was hit and sank in two minutes, and &quot;Kelly&quot; was hit and turned turtle soon after and later sank. &quot;Kelly&quot; shot down a &quot;Stuka&quot; before sinking and another was badly damaged and crashed upon returning to base. &quot;Kipling&quot; survived 83 bombs, while 279 survivors were rescued from the ships. (The Noël Coward film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; was based on this action.) The Royal Navy had suffered so many losses from air attacks that on 23 May Admiral Cunningham signalled his superiors that daylight operations could no longer continue, but the Chiefs of Staff demurred. German search-and-rescue aircraft and Italian motor torpedo boats spotted and rescued the 262 survivors from the German light convoy sunk off Cape Spatha.

After air attacks on Allied positions in Kastelli on 24 May, the 95th &quot;Gebirgs&quot; Pioneer Battalion advanced on the town. These air attacks enabled the escape of German paratroopers captured on 20 May; the escapees killed or captured several New Zealand officers assigned to lead the 1st Greek Regiment. The Greeks put up determined resistance but, with only 600 rifles and a few thousand rounds of ammunition available for 1,000 ill-trained men, they were unable to repel the German advance. Fighting by the remnants of the 1st Greek Regiment continued in the Kastelli area until 26 May, hampering German efforts to land reinforcements.

Despite the dangers posed by British naval forces, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; made another attempt to supply the invasion by sea. On 24 May &quot;Oberleutnant-zur-See&quot; Österlin, who had led the Maleme Flotilla, was given the task of transporting two &quot;Panzer II&quot; light tanks to Kastelli Kisamou. Österlin commandeered a small wooden lighter at Piraeus and arranged for the tanks to be lowered onto it. At dusk the next day, the lighter, towed by the small harbour tug &quot;Kentauros&quot;, left Piraeus and headed south towards Crete. Reports of British naval units operating nearby convinced Admiral Schuster to delay the operation and he ordered Österlin to make for a small harbour on the German-occupied island of Kithira. At a meeting in Athens on 27 May, Luftwaffe Generals Richthofen, Jeschonnek, and Löhr pressed Schuster to get the tanks delivered somehow before &quot;... the Englander claws himself erect again&quot;. One of Richthofen&#x27;s liaison officers had returned from the island on 26 May; the paratroopers were in poor condition, lacking in discipline, and &quot;at loose ends&quot;. He stressed the &quot;absolute and immediate need&quot; for &quot;reinforcement by sea shipment of heavy weaponry if the operation is to get ahead at all.&quot;
Schuster issued Österlin new orders to sail for the Gulf of Kissamos, where a landing beach had already been selected and marked out. Upon nearing the shore on 28 May, the lighter was positioned ahead of the tug and firmly beached. A party of engineers then blew the lighter&#x27;s bow off using demolition charges and the two tanks rolled ashore. They were soon assigned to &quot;Advance Detachment Wittman&quot;, which had assembled near Prison Valley reservoir the day before. This ad hoc group was composed of a motorcycle battalion, the Reconnaissance Battalion, an anti-tank unit, a motorised artillery troop, and some engineers. General Ringel gave orders for Wittmann to &quot;strike out from Platanos at 03:00 on 28 May in pursuit of the British &#x27;main&#x27; via the coastal highway to Rethymno&quot; and thence towards Heraklion. Although they did not play a decisive role, the panzers were useful in helping round up British troops in the Kissamos area, before speeding eastward in support of the German pursuit column.

On the night of 26/27 May, a detachment of some 800 men from No. 7 and No. 50/52 Commandos, as part of Layforce, landed at Souda Bay (Colonel Robert Laycock). Laycock had tried to land the force on 25 May, but had turned back due to bad weather. Although armed mainly with only rifles and a small number of machine guns, they were to carry out rearguard actions in order to buy the garrison enough time to carry out an evacuation.

Troops of the German 141st Mountain Regiment blocked a section of the road between Souda and Chania. On the morning of 27 May, the New Zealand 28th (Māori) Battalion, the Australian 2/7th Battalion and the Australian 2/8th Battalion cleared the road by a bayonet charge (the &quot;Battle of 42nd Street&quot;). Command in London decided the cause was hopeless after General Wavell informed the Prime Minister at 0842, 27 May, that the battle was lost, and ordered an evacuation. Freyberg concurrently ordered his troops to withdraw to the south coast to be evacuated.

====Italian landing at Sitia====

On 26 May, in the face of the stalled German advance, senior Wehrmacht officers requested Mussolini to send Italian Army units to Crete in order to help the German forces fighting there. On the afternoon of 27 May, an Italian convoy departed from Rhodes with the intention of landing a brigade from the 50th Infantry Division Regina, supported by 13 L3/35 light tanks. Italian participation in the battle of Crete was limited and finally on 28 May, when the campaign was already decided in the Germans&#x27; favour and Allied evacuation had begun, an Italian landing force approached the east coast of the island, off Sitia.

At 13:30 on 28 May, the Italians believed that three cruisers and six destroyers of the Royal Navy were steaming up towards the northern coast of Crete in support of Allied troops, but the Royal Navy was fully occupied evacuating the Crete garrison. The Italians assumed that the Royal Navy force would be off Sitia, the planned landing site, by 17:00, and the commander decided that the slowest ship of the convoy would be taken in tow by &quot;Lince&quot; to increase speed and &quot;Crispi&quot; was detached to shell the lighthouse at Cape Sideros. The 3,000 men of the division and their equipment were on shore by 17:20 and advanced west mostly unopposed, rendezvousing with the Germans at Ierapetra. The Italian troops later moved their headquarters from Sitia to Agios Nikolaos.

===Retreat===

The Germans pushed the British, Commonwealth and Greek forces steadily southward, using aerial and artillery bombardment, followed by waves of motorcycle and mountain troops (the rocky terrain making it difficult to employ tanks). The garrisons at Souda and Beritania gradually fell back along the road to Vitsilokoumos, north of Sfakia. About halfway there, near the village of Askyfou lay a large crater nicknamed &quot;The Saucer&quot;, the only place wide and flat enough for a large parachute drop. Troops were stationed about its perimeter, to prevent a landing that might block the retreat.
On the evening of the 27th, a small detachment of German troops penetrated Allied lines near Imbros Gorge threatening a column of retreating unarmed Allied forces. The attack was held off by four men, the only ones with weapons. Led by Cpl Douglas Bignal, the men sacrificed themselves,securing the withdrawal of the remainder. Amongst this group was New Zealander Pte Willy Falconer of the Maori battalion, a hero of 42nd Street and Galatas. Also killed were LCpl Philip Stamp and Pte Andrew Payton.

Near Souda, the 5th New Zealand Brigade and the 2/7th Australian Battalion, held off the 141st Mountain Regiment, which had begun a flanking manoeuvre, and on 28 May, at the village of Stylos, the 5th New Zealand Brigade fought a rearguard action. The Luftwaffe was over Rethymno and Heraklion and they were able to retreat down the road.

The retreat of the brigade was covered by two companies of the Māori Battalion under Captain Rangi Royal, who overran the I Battalion, 141st &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; Regiment and halted the German advance. When the main unit was safely to the rear, the Māori retreated , losing only two killed and eight wounded, all of whom were recovered. Layforce was the only big unit in this area to be cut off. Layforce had been sent to Crete by way of Sfakia when it was still hoped that reinforcements could be brought from Egypt to turn the tide of the battle. The battalion-sized force was split up, with a 200-man detachment under Laycock at Souda to cover the retreat of the heavier units. Layforce and three British tanks were joined by the men of the 20th Heavy Anti-Aircraft Battery, who had been assigned to guard Souda docks and refused to believe that an evacuation had been ordered. After a day of battle, Laycock ordered a night retreat to Beritiana, where he was joined by Royal and the Māori, who managed to fight their way out, but Layforce was cut off near the village of Babali Khani (Agioi Pantes). Laycock and his Intelligence Officer, Evelyn Waugh, were able to escape in a tank. Most of the other men of the detachment and the 20th HAA Battery were killed or captured. (By the end of the operation about 600 of the 800 commandos sent to Crete were listed as killed, wounded or missing; only 179 men got off the island.)

===Evacuation, 28 May – 1 June===

From 28 May – 1 June, troops were embarked for Egypt, most being lifted from Sfakia on the south coast. More than 4,000 troops were rescued from Heraklion on the night of 28/29 May but that naval force was attacked for hours by Luftwaffe dive bombers on the voyage back, suffering ships sunk and damaged with numerous casualties among naval personnel and troops. About 6,000 men were withdrawn by cruisers and destroyers from Sfakia on the night of 29 May. Two destroyers carried another 1,400 soldiers away on the night of the 30/31st. During the night of 31 May, Cunningham sent the cruiser &quot;Phoebe&quot; with four smaller vessels to transport more than 3,500 troops to Alexandria. About 18,600 men of the 32,000 British troops on the island were evacuated; 12,000 British and Dominion troops and thousands of Greeks were still on Crete when the island came under German control on 1 June.

===Surrender===
Colonel Campbell, the commander at Rethymno, was forced to surrender his contingent. Rethymno fell and on the night of 30 May, German motorcycle troops linked up with the Italian troops who had landed on Sitia. On 1 June, the remaining 5,000 defenders at Sfakia surrendered. By the end of December, about 500 Commonwealth troops remained at large on the island. While scattered and disorganised, these men and the partisans harassed German troops for long after the withdrawal.

===Civilian resistance===
Cretan civilians joined the battle with whatever weapons were at hand. Most civilians went into action armed only with what they could gather from their kitchens or barns and several German parachutists were knifed or clubbed to death in olive groves. In one recorded incident, an elderly Cretan man clubbed a parachutist to death with his walking cane, before the German could disentangle himself from his parachute. In another recorded incident, a local priest and his teenage son broke into a small village museum and took two rifles from the era of the Balkan Wars and sniped at German paratroops at landing zones. The Cretans also used captured German small arms. The Crete civilian actions against the Germans were not limited to harassment; mobs of armed civilians joined in the Greek counter-attacks at Kastelli Hill and Paleochora; the British and New Zealand advisers at these locations were hard pressed to prevent massacres. Civilians also checked the Germans to the north and west of Heraklion and in the town centre.

===Massacres of Greek civilians===
The Battle of Crete was not the first occasion during the Second World War where the German troops encountered widespread resistance from a civilian population, as similar events took place during the invasion of Poland (Kłecko); nevertheless it initially surprised and later outraged them. As most Cretan partisans wore no uniforms or insignia such as armbands or headbands, the Germans felt free of all of the constraints of the Hague Conventions and killed armed and unarmed civilians indiscriminately. Even before the end of the battle, civilians were executed in places like Missiria. Immediately after Crete fell, collective punishments against civilians intensified. Between 2 June and 1 August, 195 persons from the village of Alikianos and its vicinity were killed in mass shootings known as the Alikianos executions. On 2 June, several male citizens from Kondomari were executed by a firing squad, with the shootings being captured on film by a German army war correspondent. On 3 June, the village of Kandanos was razed to the ground and about 180 of its inhabitants killed. After the war, Student, who ordered the shootings, avoided prosecution for war crimes, despite Greek efforts to have him extradited.

The first resistance movement in Crete was established just two weeks after its capture. Throughout the German occupation in the years that followed, reprisals in retaliation for the involvement of the local population in the Cretan resistance continued. On several occasions, villagers were rounded up and summarily executed. In one of the worst incidents, around 20 villages east of Viannos and west of the Ierapetra provinces were looted and burnt in September 1943, with more than 500 of their inhabitants being massacred. These massacres were among the deadliest during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. In August 1944, more than 940 houses in Anogeia were looted and then dynamited. During the same month, nine villages in the Amari Valley were destroyed and 165 people killed in what is now known as the Holocaust of Kedros. All these reprisals were ordered by &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Friedrich-Wilhelm Müller, who was nicknamed &quot;The Butcher of Crete&quot;. After the war, Müller was tried by a Greek military court and executed.
Assaults on civilians with lower death tolls occurred in places like Vorizia, Kali Sykia, Kallikratis, Skourvoula, and Malathyros.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

The German Air Ministry was shocked by the number of transport aircraft lost in the battle, and Student, reflecting on the casualties suffered by the paratroopers, concluded after the war that Crete was the death of the airborne force. Hitler, believing airborne forces to be a weapon of surprise which had now lost that advantage, concluded that the days of the airborne corps were over and directed that paratroopers should be employed as ground-based troops in subsequent operations in the Soviet Union.

The battle for Crete delayed Operation Barbarossa but not directly. The start date for &quot;Barbarossa&quot; (22 June 1941) had been set several weeks before the Crete operation was considered and the directive by Hitler for Operation Mercury made it plain that preparations for &quot;Merkur&quot; must not interfere with &quot;Barbarossa&quot;. Units assigned to &quot;Merkur&quot; were intended for &quot;Barbarossa&quot; and were forced to redeploy to Poland and Romania by the end of May. Movement of surviving units from Greece was not delayed. The transfer of &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; VIII north, ready for &quot;Barbarossa&quot;, eased the Royal Navy evacuation of the defenders. The delay of Operation Barbarossa was exacerbated also by the late spring and floods in Poland.

The Air operation impact of the Battle of Crete to Operation Barbarossa was direct. The considerable losses of the Luftwaffe during the operation Mercury, specifically regarding troop carrier planes, affected the capacity of air power operations at the start of the Russian campaign. Additionally, with German parachute troops being decimated in Crete, there was an insufficient number of men that were qualified to carry out the huge-scale airborne operations that were necessary at the beginning of the invasion. Furthermore, the delay of the whole Balkan campaign, including the Battle of Crete, did not allow for exploiting the strategic advantages that German forces had gained in the Eastern Mediterranean. With the VIII Air Corps ordered to Germany for refitting before Crete was secured, significant command and communication issues hampered redeployment of the whole formation as the ground personnel was directly redeployed to their new bases in Poland.

The sinking of the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; on 27 May distracted British public opinion but the loss of Crete, particularly as a result of the failure of the Allied land forces to recognise the strategic importance of the airfields, led the British government to make changes. Only six days before the initial assault, the Vice Chief of Air Staff presciently wrote: &quot;If the Army attach any importance to air superiority at the time of an invasion then they must take steps to protect our aerodromes with something more than men in their first or second childhood&quot;. Shocked and disappointed with the Army&#x27;s inexplicable failure to recognise the importance of airfields in modern warfare, Churchill made the RAF responsible for the defence of its bases and the RAF Regiment was formed on 1 February 1942. Allied commanders at first worried the Germans might use Crete as a springboard for further operations in the Mediterranean East Basin, possibly for an airborne attack on Cyprus or a seaborne invasion of Egypt, in support of Axis forces operating from Libya. Operation Barbarossa made it apparent that the occupation of Crete was a defensive measure to secure the Axis southern flank.

===Ultra===

For a fortnight, Enigma intercepts described the arrival of &quot;Fliegerkorps XI&quot; around Athens, the collection of 27,000 registered tons of shipping and the effect of air attacks on Crete, which began on 14 May 1941. A postponement of the invasion was revealed on 15 May, and on 19 May, the probable date was given as the next day. The German objectives in Crete were similar to the areas already being prepared by the British, but foreknowledge increased the confidence of the local commanders in their dispositions. On 14 May, London warned that the attack could come any time after 17 May, which information Freyberg passed on to the garrison. On 16 May the British authorities expected an attack by 25,000 to 30,000 airborne troops in and by 10,000 troops transported by sea. (The real figures were 15,750 airborne troops in and sea; late decrypts reduced uncertainty over the seaborne invasion.) The British mistakes were smaller than those of the Germans, who estimated the garrison to be only a third of the true figure. (The after-action report of &quot;Fliegerkorps XI&quot; contained a passage recounting that the operational area had been so well prepared that it gave the impression that the garrison had known the time of the invasion.)

The Germans captured a message from London marked &quot;Personal for General Freyberg&quot; which was translated into German and sent to Berlin. Dated 24 May and headed &quot;According to most reliable source&quot; it said where German troops were on the previous day (which could have been from reconnaissance) but also specified that the Germans were next going to &quot;attack Suda Bay&quot;. This could have indicated that Enigma messages were compromised.

Antony Beevor in 1991 and P. D. Antill in 2005 wrote that Allied commanders knew of the invasion through Ultra intercepts. Freyberg, informed of the air component of the German battle plan, had started to prepare a defence near the airfields and along the north coast. He had been hampered by a lack of modern equipment, and the lightly armed paratroopers had about the same firepower as the defenders, if not more. Ultra intelligence was detailed but was taken out of context and misinterpreted.
While emphasis was placed on the airborne assault, the German messages also mentioned seaborne operations; Freyberg, expecting an amphibious landing, garrisoned the coast – which reduced the number of men available to defend the airfield at Maleme, the principal German objective. In 1993, F. H. Hinsley, the official historian of British intelligence during the war, wrote that the Germans had more casualties in the conquest of Crete than in the rest of the Greek campaign; the 7th &quot;Fliegerdivision&quot; was decimated, leaving the Germans with a crippled airborne arm. It was the only unit of its kind and was not rebuilt.

Hinsley wrote that it was difficult to measure the influence of intelligence gained during the battle, because although Ultra revealed German situation reports, reinforcement details and unit identifications, and although more intelligence was gleaned from prisoners and captured documents, it was not known how swiftly the information reached Freyberg or how he used it. The German parachute warfare manual had been captured in 1940, and after the war Student said that he would have changed tactics had he known this. Field-signals intelligence was obtained, including bombing instructions and information from the &quot;Fliegerkorps&quot; XI tactical code. Lack of air cover prevented much British air reconnaissance north of Crete, but on 21 May signals intelligence enabled an aircraft to spot a convoy. After midnight the navy sank twelve ships and the rest scattered, which led to a second invasion convoy being called back. The second convoy was intercepted during the morning of 22 May, despite the cost to the navy of a daylight operation, and no more seaborne attempts were made.

===Casualties===

Official German casualty figures are contradictory due to minor variations in documents produced by German commands on various dates. Davin estimated 6,698 losses, based upon an examination of various sources. Davin wrote that his estimate might exclude lightly wounded soldiers.

In 1956, Playfair and the other British official historians, gave figures of 1,990 Germans killed, 2,131 wounded, 1,995 missing, a total of 6,116 men &quot;compiled from what appear to be the most reliable German records&quot;.

Exaggerated reports of German casualties began to appear after the battle had ended. In New Zealand, &quot;The Press&quot; on 12 June 1941 reported that
Churchill claimed that the Germans must have suffered well over 15,000 casualties. Buckley, based on British intelligence assumptions of two enemies wounded for every one killed, gave an estimate of 16,800 casualties. The United States Army Center of Military History, citing a report of the Historical Branch of the British Cabinet Office, concluded that military historians accept estimates from 6,000 to 7,000 German casualties. The Australian Graves Commission counted about 4,000 German graves in the Maleme–Souda Bay area, and about 1,000 more at Rethymno and Heraklion, that would have included deaths during the German occupation due to sickness, accidents, or fighting with partisan forces.

The official historians recorded 147 Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed and 64 damaged beyond repair by enemy action, with 73 destroyed due to extensive non-combat damage, for a total of 284 aircraft. Another 84 planes had repairable non-combat damage. In 1987, Shores, Cull, and Malizia recorded losses of 220 aircraft destroyed and 64 written off due to damage, a total of 284 aircraft between 13 May and 1 June: 147 in combat, 73 non-combat, 64 written-off, and 125 damaged but repairable. A total of 311 Luftwaffe aircrew were listed as killed or missing and 127 were wounded. In a 1948 RAF staff publication, Luftwaffe losses were given as about 4,500 parachute and glider troop casualties and about 170 Ju 52s lost or severely damaged; losses in fighter and bomber units were small due to the lack of air opposition.

The British lost 1,742 killed, 1,737 wounded, and 11,835 taken prisoner from a garrison of slightly more than 32,000 men; and there were 1,828 dead and 183 wounded Royal Navy personnel. Of a force of more than 10,000 men, 5,255 Greek troops were captured. After the war, the Allied graves from the four burial grounds that had been established by the Germans were moved to Souda Bay War Cemetery. A large number of civilians were killed in the crossfire or died fighting as partisans. Many Cretan civilians were shot by the Germans in reprisal during the battle and in the occupation. One Cretan source puts the number of Cretans killed by Germans at 6,593 men, 1,113 women, and 869 children. German records put the number of Cretans executed by firing squad as 3,474 and at least 1,000 civilians were killed in massacres late in 1944.

The Luftwaffe sank the cruisers , , and and the destroyers &quot;Kelly&quot;, &quot;Greyhound&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot; from 22 May – 1 June. Italian bombers from 41° Gruppo sank the destroyer on 21 May and on 28 May damaged another destroyer, , beyond repair. The British also lost the destroyer on 29 May, when she was attacked by German Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bombers.

Damage to the aircraft carrier , the battleships and , the cruisers , , , and , the submarine , the destroyers and , kept them out of action for months. At anchor in Souda Bay, northern Crete, the heavy cruiser was disabled by Italian explosive motor boats and beached on 26 March; and was later wrecked by demolition charges when Crete was evacuated in May. By 1 June, the eastern Mediterranean strength of the Royal Navy had been reduced to two battleships and three cruisers, against four battleships and eleven cruisers of the Italian Navy. For the British, the Battle of Crete was the costliest naval engagement of the entire war.

Royal Navy shipborne anti-aircraft gun claims for the period of 15–27 May amounted to: &quot;Twenty enemy aircraft ... shot down for certain, with 11 probables. At least 15 aircraft appeared to have been damaged ...&quot;; from 28 May – 1 June, another two aircraft were claimed shot down and six more damaged, for a total of 22 claimed destroyed, 11 probably destroyed and 21 damaged.

<doc id="149778" wikidata="Q115345739" url="?curid=149778" title="General paresis of the insane">
<text>General paresis, also known as general paralysis of the insane (GPI), paralytic dementia, or syphilitic paresis is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder, classified as an organic mental disorder, and is caused by late-stage syphilis and the chronic meningoencephalitis and cerebral atrophy that are associated with this late stage of the disease when left untreated. GPI differs from mere paresis, as mere paresis can result from multiple other causes and usually does not affect cognitive function. Degenerative changes caused by GPI are associated primarily with the frontal and temporal lobar cortex. The disease affects approximately 7% of individuals infected with syphilis, and is far more common in developing countries where fewer options for timely treatment are available. It is more common among men.

GPI was originally considered to be a type of madness due to a dissolute character, when first identified in the early 19th century. The condition&#x27;s connection with syphilis was discovered in the late 1880s. Progressively, with the discovery of organic arsenicals such as Salvarsan and Neosalvarsan (1910s), the development of pyrotherapy (1920s), and the widespread availability and use of penicillin in the treatment of syphilis (1940s), the condition was rendered avoidable and curable. Prior to this, GPI was inevitably fatal, and it accounted for as much as 25% of the primary diagnoses for residents in public psychiatric hospitals.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of the disease first appear from 10 to 30 years after infection. Incipient GPI is usually manifested by neurasthenic difficulties, such as fatigue, headaches, insomnia, dizziness, etc. As the disease progresses, mental deterioration and personality changes occur. Typical symptoms include loss of social inhibitions, asocial behavior, gradual impairment of judgment, concentration and short-term memory, euphoria, mania, depression, or apathy. Subtle shivering, minor defects in speech and Argyll Robertson pupil may become noticeable.

Delusions, common as the illness progresses, tend to be poorly systematized and absurd. They can be grandiose, melancholic, or paranoid. These delusions include ideas of great wealth, immortality, thousands of lovers, unfathomable power, apocalypsis, nihilism, self-guilt, self-blame, or bizarre hypochondriacal complaints. Later, the patient experiences dysarthria, intention tremors, hyperreflexia, myoclonic jerks, confusion, seizures and severe muscular deterioration. Eventually, the paretic dies bedridden, cachectic and completely disoriented, frequently in a state of status epilepticus.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis could be differentiated from other known psychoses and dementias by a characteristic abnormality in eye pupil reflexes (Argyll Robertson pupil), and, eventually, the development of muscular reflex abnormalities, seizures, memory impairment (dementia) and other signs of relatively pervasive neurocerebral deterioration. Definitive diagnosis is based on the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and tests for syphilis.

==Prognosis==
Although there were recorded cases of remission of the symptoms, especially if they had not passed beyond the stage of psychosis, these individuals almost invariably experienced relapse within a few months to a few years. Otherwise, the patient was seldom able to return home because of the complexity, severity and unmanageability of the evolving symptom picture. Eventually, the patient would become completely incapacitated, bed ridden, and would die, the process taking about three to five years on average.

==History==

While retrospective studies have found earlier instances of what may have been the same disorder, the first clearly identified examples of paresis among the insane were described in Paris after the Napoleonic Wars. General paresis of the insane was first described as a distinct disease in 1822 by Antoine Laurent Jesse Bayle. General paresis most often struck people (men far more frequently than women) between 20 and 40 years of age. By 1877, for example, the superintendent of an asylum for men in New York reported that in his institution this disorder accounted for more than 12% of admissions and more than 2% of deaths.

Originally, the cause was believed to be an inherent weakness of character or constitution. While Friedrich von Esmarch and the psychiatrist had asserted as early as 1857 that syphilis caused general paresis (progressive Paralyse), progress toward the general acceptance by the medical community of this idea was only accomplished later by the eminent 19th century syphilographer Jean Alfred Fournier (18321914). In 1913 all doubt about the syphilitic nature of paresis was finally eliminated when Hideyo Noguchi and J. W. Moore demonstrated the syphilitic spirochaetes in the brains of paretics.

In 1917 Julius Wagner-Jauregg discovered that malaria therapy (in this case, medical induction of a fever) involving infecting paretic patients with malaria could halt the progression of general paresis. He won a Nobel Prize for this discovery in 1927. After World War II the use of penicillin to treat syphilis made general paresis a rarity: even patients manifesting early symptoms of actual general paresis were capable of full recovery with a course of penicillin. The disorder is now virtually unknown outside developing countries, and even there the epidemiology is substantially reduced.

Some notable cases of general paresis:
* General Ranald S. Mackenzie was retired from the US Army in 1884 for &quot;general paresis of the insane&quot; 5 years before his death in 1889.
* Theo Van Gogh, brother of painter Vincent van Gogh, died six months after Vincent in 1891 from &quot;dementia parylitica&quot; or what is now called syphilitic paresis.
* The Chicago gangster Al Capone died of syphilitic paresis, having contracted syphilis in a brothel in 1919, and not having been properly treated for it in time to prevent his later onset of syphilitic paresis.

<text>San Francisco State University (San Francisco State, SF State and SFSU) is a public research university in San Francisco. It was established in 1899 as the San Francisco State Normal School and is part of the California State University system.

It offers 126 bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, 106 master&#x27;s degree programs, and 3 doctoral degree programs, along with 23 teaching credential programs among seven colleges. The 144.1-acre main campus is located in the southwest part of the city, less than two miles from the Pacific coast. The university has 12 varsity athletic teams which compete at the NCAA Division II level.

SF State is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity.&quot; It is also a designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) and Asian American Native American Pacific Islander serving institution (AANAPISI).

==History==
=== 19th Century ===
In 1857, the San Francisco Board of Education created the San Francisco Weekly Normal School, also known as the Minns&#x27; Evening Normal School. In 1862, it became the California State Normal School, the first postsecondary institution established by the state. Only six students were enrolled on its first day. By 1866, enrollment had increased to 384.

In 1867, the principal of Girls&#x27; High School and Normal School, Ellis Holmes, realized that the California State Normal School was not meeting the demand for teachers. The city approved the addition of a new year-long teacher-training program to his high school&#x27;s curriculum, for girls who wanted to pursue a career in education. This program is what would eventually become San Francisco State University. When the California State Normal School was moved to San José in 1871, Girls&#x27; High became the only publicly-supported teacher-training institution.

In 1895, the teaching program was split from the school and became San Francisco City Normal School. Due to a lack of funding, the school closed in 1898. A group of teachers, students, and supporters pressured the California State Legislature to convert it into a state-funded institution.

On March 22, 1899, the California State Legislature approved the creation of the San Francisco State Normal School, with an appropriation of $10,000. Frederic Lister Burk was appointed as the first president and chose the school&#x27;s motto, &quot;Experientia Docet&quot;. The school rented space in a building on Powell Street between Clay and Sacramento Streets and 31 women were enrolled in the first year.

=== 20th Century ===
The 1906 earthquake and fire forced the school to relocate from Nob Hill to a temporary campus at the Grant School in Oakland. Ten days after the earthquake, President Burk found a new site for the school at a property bound by Laguna, Haight, Buchanan, and Hermann Streets.

In 1921, the school began offering Bachelor&#x27;s degree options and was renamed San Francisco State Teachers College. Teachers Colleges in California received authorization to grant Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1923.

In 1924, construction for new buildings started on vacant land at the school&#x27;s site. The campus consisted of four Spanish Colonial Revival style buildings designed by George McDougall, a California state architect.

In the 1930s, overcrowding became an issue at the campus. It had been designed for 1500 students, but had to accommodate about 3000. In 1938, students rallied for a new campus with non-wooden buildings, due to fears from the city&#x27;s earthquake and fire in 1906. By 1939, land near Lake Merced had been acquired to build a new campus, but plans were paused due to World War II. Many students took part in the war, causing enrollment to decline.

During the 1920s and &#x27;30s, State Teachers Colleges expanded beyond being only vocational schools to train teachers. They were formally authorized to offer four-year liberal arts curriculums and renamed State Colleges in 1935. So, the school became known as San Francisco State College.

In 1949, master&#x27;s degrees were authorized to be offered.

San Francisco State College became part of the California State College system established under the Donahoe Higher Education Act in 1960. In Fall 1965, the Experimental College was started by students, in an effort to teach untraditionally. In 1927, over 2000 students enrolled in courses offered by the Experimental College. The original Experimental College stopped operating after 1969.

In 1967, 1968, and 1969, there were many demonstrations, including the Third World Liberation Front strike at SF State, longest student strike in American history, which lasted from November 6, 1968 to March 20, 1969.

Also in 1969, Richard Oakes led a group of SF State students in the occupation of Alcatraz Island And a 763-bed, 15-story dorm building, Verducci Hall, was built near Lake Merced Boulevard.

In 1971, campus-based childcare at SF State was approved by the California State Colleges board of trustees. On October 10, 1972, the Associated Students Lilliput Childcare Center opened, providing childcare to students who are parents and the general public. It&#x27;s now called the AS Early Childhood Education Center.

In 1972, the State Colleges system was designated &quot;The California State University and Colleges.&quot; As a result, SF State was renamed California State University, San Francisco. This name was not popular with students, and the university was soon renamed San Francisco State University in 1974.

President Romberg secured a permanent federal lease for 25 acres of shoreline in Tiburon for just $1 in 1978. The Romberg Tiburon Campus would eventually expand to 53 acres.

In 1983, Chia-Wei Woo became the 11th president of the university. Woo was the first Chinese-American to head a major American university.

After suffering damage from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, Verducci Hall was permanently closed.

In 1993, the College of Extended Learning (now College of Global and Professional Education) opened the Downtown Center in San Francisco&#x27;s Multimedia Gulch, at 425 Market St.

On March 28, 1999, construction began on the Village at Centennial Square, a low-rise, mixed-use complex. The same day, Verducci Hall was imploded after it sustained damage from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and sat vacant for a decade.

=== 21st Century ===
In 2007, the Downtown Campus was opened at 835 Market Street, with nearly 47,000 square feet of classroom space in Westfield San Francisco Centre.

In 2009, the Children&#x27;s Campus opened to provide childcare, primarily to faculty and staff.

The first Rhythms Music Festival happened in March 2011. The annual music festival is held in a building known as the Annex.

In 2013, the Science Building was found to have &quot;unsafe levels&quot; of airborne mercury, lead and asbestos in the basement. Over $3.6 million was spent for remediation of the pervasive contamination. University administration terminated several employees who reported the contamination, resulting in several wrongful termination and whistle-blower lawsuits, including one by the recently hired director. In July 2014, Cal/OSHA cited the university for various health and safety violations in the Science Building, which included SFSU failing to locate asbestos in the building and warn employees about the hazards of mercury.

In March 2016, a video of a student being attacked for having dreadlocks went viral and sparked discussions about cultural appropriation.In response to the College of Ethnic Studies being underfunded since 2008, four students held a ten-day hunger strike from May 2–11, 2016, resulting in one hospitalization. The strike ended when President Leslie Wong agreed to commit nearly $500,000 to the college and meet a portion of their demands.

The Experimental College was revived in Fall 2017. One-unit courses are created and taught by students.

Also in 2017, a group of Jewish students and local residents accused SFSU of encouraging antisemitism and excluding Jewish student pro-Israel activist groups from campus activities. The students filed two lawsuits focusing on the disruption of a speech by Jerusalem mayor Nir Barkat in 2016. One suit was dismissed and the other was settled.

In May 2019, Lynn Mahoney became the first woman to become president of SF State in a permanent capacity. Mary Ward had served as an acting president in the summer of 1927, after the death of Archibald Anderson.

On September 23, 2020, SFSU faculty Rabab Abdulhadi and Tomomi Kinukawa hosted a discussion on Zoom titled &quot;Whose Narratives? Gender, Justice, and Resistance.&quot; The event&#x27;s speakers included Leila Khaled, a Palestinian political activist and plane hijacker. Zoom and YouTube canceled the broadcast due to Khaled&#x27;s history of violent actions towards civilians. Facebook also removed a page for the event. President Mahoney wrote a letter about the incident. A second event titled &quot;Whose Narratives? What Free Speech for Palestine?&quot; was scheduled for April 23, 2021, and was also blocked.

In 2022, the new Downtown Campus opened on the fifth floor of 160 Spear St., replacing the Downtown Campus at 835 Market Street.

On April 6, 2023, former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines visited SFSU for a Turning Point USA student chapter event and spoke publicly about her campaign against transgender athletes in women&#x27;s sports. This sparked a protest. After the event, Gaines said she had been struck during the protest.

In September, October, and November, students and staff held numerous demonstrations in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas War, tuition increases, layoffs, and budget cuts.

SFSU faculty members participated in a strike led by the California Faculty Association across the CSU system on January 22, 2024. Faculty had held earlier demonstrations in an effort to prevent layoffs and receive a 12% raise.

About 500 people attended a rally on April 29, calling for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. After the rally, some protestors began an encampment, following protests and encampments at universities in other parts of the United States and in other countries. The encampment ended on May 15 after protestors reached a divestment agreement with university leaders.

==Main campus==
San Francisco State University&#x27;s main campus is located in the southwest part of San Francisco. To its north are Lowell High School and Stonestown Galleria. Parkmerced is south of the campus. 19th Avenue and the Ingleside neighborhood are to its east and Lake Merced and TPC Harding Park are to its west.

San Francisco State University&#x27;s original campus was on Nob Hill, where it was established as the San Francisco State Normal School on Powell Street between Clay and Sacramento Streets. The 1906 earthquake and fire forced a relocation to Buchanan and Haight Streets, where the institution would remain for several decades. During this period, the school underwent several transformations: becoming San Francisco State Teachers College in 1921, San Francisco State College in 1935.

The shift to the current Lake Merced campus began during the Great Depression, when the site was still owned by Spring Valley Water Company. In 1939, SFSU President Alexander Roberts and student body president Clifford Worth explored the undeveloped property, which at the time consisted mainly of sand dunes dotted with trees and underbrush. Worth proved instrumental in securing the campus&#x27;s future, successfully lobbying the state Legislature to fund the land purchase. His efforts culminated on July 12, 1939, when the state committed to purchasing 57 acres from the City of San Francisco. The campus opened for classes for Fall 1953, before it was formally dedicated in October 1954. Since then, it has expanded to 144.1 acres.

The campus is under the jurisdiction of San Francisco State&#x27;s University Police Department.

It is used and managed by the Lam Family College of Business and the College of Professional &amp; Global Education (formerly College of Extended Learning). The campus spans approximately 15,850 square feet.

SF State has maintained facilities in Downtown San Francisco since the 1950s. The current Downtown Campus replaces the previous, underused campus that was located in the San Francisco Centre. The old Downtown Campus was a replacement for the Downtown Center located at 425 Market Street.

The campus has a student lounge, a computer lab, and study rooms. A portion of 160 Spear St.&#x27;s 12th floor was part of the campus until 2024.

=== Sierra Nevada Field Campus (SNFC) ===
The 7.1-acre Sierra Nevada Field Campus is located in Sierra County, near Yuba Pass and the Sierra Valley, at 35400 Hwy 49 in Calpine, California. It is over 200 miles north of the main campus.

Established in 1949, the campus was originally named Camp Leonard after SFSU&#x27;s fifth president J. Paul Leonard. It started as a training facility for recreation leaders and added a children&#x27;s camp in 1951. Basic plumbing was installed in 1953. The first three-unit college course was taught there in 1961. In 1970, under William Hammerman&#x27;s leadership, it transitioned from a children&#x27;s camp to a college-wide field campus.

The campus is currently funded primarily through its summer workshops and programs, with additional support from a nonprofit called Friends of the Sierra Nevada Field Campus. The existing buildings are the original structures from 1949.

The campus offers three to seven-day courses and workshops to students as well as the general public. Accredited, one-unit courses are processed by the College of Professional &amp; Global Education. Workshops are not for credit and processed by the University Corporation. The campus is also used for research by graduate students of the College of Science and Engineering.

The campus operates from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend each year. The campus offers 35–40 different courses each summer through two programs: accredited classes through the College of Professional &amp; Global Education, and non-credit workshops through the University Corporation.

Due to its remote location, there is no cell service and extremely limited internet access at the campus. Accommodations at the campus consist of tents with mattresses. Students and visitors can to bring their own tents or vehicles to sleep in, or stay off campus. The campus has a moderately high elevation of about 5522 feet or 1683 meters.

SFSU fields 12 sports: men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s baseball, wrestling, indoor track and field, outdoor track and field and softball.

The Gators have also produced 13 National Football League players, including Billy Baird, Elmer Collett, Maury Duncan, Carl Kammerer, Douglas Parrish, and Floyd Peters. Mike Holmgren got his collegiate coaching start as the team&#x27;s Offensive Coordinator in 1981. The football program ended in 1995.

SF State has produced three Major League Baseball players, two of whom became All-Stars (former Mets shortstop Bud Harrelson, and former Brewers and Red Sox outfielder Tommy Harper). The soccer program has had one player enter the professional ranks. Jared MacLane played in the soccer Professional First Division in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

SF State Wrestling sent a wrestler to a national championship meet every year from 1963–64 to 2016–17.

As of 2024, the Gators have earned one NCAA team championship at the Division II level, a 1997 wrestling championship.

=== Mascot ===
In the early 20th century, collegiate sports at SFSU became more popular, creating a need for a team name, and the search for a mascot started in 1921. The university&#x27;s newspaper at the time, the Bay Leaf, asked for suggestions for a mascot. Students suggested an alligator named &quot;Golden Gater&quot; in reference to the Golden Gate. Students voted in favor of the name and the alligator choice was finalized in 1931, but after numerous misspellings by the newspaper, use of &quot;Golden Gator&quot; stuck. In the beginning, two female students were chosen each year as alligator mascots. The mascot&#x27;s name was shortened to the Gator, and became Alli Gator in 2023.

==Notable faculty and alumni==
SF State&#x27;s past and present faculty and alumni include 21 Pulitzer Prize winners, 16 Academy Award winners, 49 Emmy Award winners, 10 Grammy Award winners, 12 Tony Award laureates.

<text>The Keys of the Kingdom is a 1941 novel by A. J. Cronin. Spanning six decades, it tells the story of Father Francis Chisholm, an unconventional Scottish Catholic priest who struggles to establish a mission in China. Beset by tragedy in his youth, as a missionary Chisholm endures many years of hardship, punctuated by famine, plague and war in the Chinese province to which he is assigned. Through a life guided by compassion and tolerance, Chisholm earns the respect of the Chinese—and of fellow clergy who would mistrust him—with his kindly, high-minded and courageous ways.

==Synopsis==
The novel has six parts, the first (The Beginning of the End) taking place in Scotland in 1938. Father Francis Chisholm is an old man, living with a housekeeper and a young orphan. Due to his unconventional views, he is being investigated by Monsignor Sleeth. The second section (Strange Vocation) focuses on Chisholm&#x27;s youth. His father is a Catholic and his mother a non-denominational Protestant. After the father is beaten by an anti-Catholic mob, Chisholm&#x27;s mother tries to lead him home to safety, only for them both to drown after falling off a bridge into a strong current, leaving young Francis an orphan. Initially, his kindly Aunt Polly wishes to adopt him, but his maternal grandmother, Mrs Glennie, intervenes and adopts him, thereby receiving any money in the Chisholm&#x27;s estate. Francis&#x27;s maternal grandfather, a baker by trade, is also a preacher of his own branch of Christianity focused on universal tolerance, and plays a large role in the development of Francis&#x27;s ideologies. While his grandfather is kind, Mrs Glennie and her son Malcolm are resentful and exploitative. Francis is forced to quit school and work in a shipyard.

Things take a turn for the better when Francis befriends Willie Tulloch and his family. Tulloch&#x27;s father is the local doctor and the family are the town&#x27;s free-thinkers. Willie aids Francis in his attempt to run away. When the attempt fails, Willie&#x27;s father contacts Aunt Polly, who takes Francis home to live with her and her daughter, Nora. Francis falls in love with Nora, but is afraid to act on it. Nora later has a child out of wedlock, and, rather than marry a man she doesn&#x27;t love, commits suicide. This cements Francis&#x27;s decision to join a seminary with childhood friend Anselm Mealey, where Francis&#x27;s humanistic views cause problems for him. However, he befriends the seminary director, Bishop Hamish McNabb, who comes to his assistance when Francis is nearly expelled from the seminary for having spent a night at a whore&#x27;s house.

The third section (An Unsuccessful Curate) focuses on Father Chisholm&#x27;s first two assignments and his struggles to do what he feels is right in the face of bureaucracy, tradition, and obstinance. At his second appointment, a local girl claims to have come across a previously dry well that had now burst forth anew with healing properties, accompanied by visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary, drawing comparisons to Saint Bernadette. Francis is shunned for doubting the girl&#x27;s claims but is vindicated when it is discovered that she had lied. Francis&#x27;s faith is rewarded when he finds a gravely ill boy who is cured by the spring water.

In the fourth section (The China Incident) Father Chisholm takes a position at a mission in Pai-tan, China. When he arrives, the mission is in ruins and no converts are to be found. Much of this section deals with the superficial and detrimental aspects of the mission systems, which focus only on official numbers and not on improving spiritual lives. With supplies from Willie Tulloch (now a doctor himself) Father Chisholm opens a free clinic, gaining the support of the villagers. He saves the life of a wealthy local&#x27;s son, who gives him land and builds him a new mission. With the aid of an isolated Christian village nearby and three nuns sent to him, he starts a school and the mission flourishes. When a flood hits and destroys the mission, the lead nun, astonished by Chisholm&#x27;s moral quality, seeks assistance from her brother, a rich German, to rebuild it. Then a plague hits Pai-tan. Willie Tulloch comes to help, and is among the last to perish from the disease. He learns that Nora&#x27;s daughter Judy died in childbirth, and sends money for the care of her son, Andrew. The mission is caught in a battle between two warlords, and Father Chisholm is forced out of his pacifism. Decades later, the warlord he worked against kidnapped Chisholm, one of his mission workers, and two Methodist missionaries. They manage to escape, but one of the Methodist missionaries is killed. Chisholm soon returns to Scotland (in section five, The Return) and asks Bishop Anselm Mealey for an appointment in his home town, but Bishop Mealey refuses it and assigns Father Chisholm to another town. He finds and adopts Andrew. The story ends with section six (The End of the Beginning), in which Monsignor Sleeth is convinced of Chisholm&#x27;s ideologies and recommends he not be removed from his position.

==Adaptations==
The book was made into a 1944 film &quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; starring Gregory Peck as Father Francis Chisholm and Vincent Price as Anselm &quot;Angus&quot; Mealey. This role earned Peck his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor.

&quot;The Keys of the Kingdom&quot; was adapted as a radio play on 19 November 1945 episode of Lux Radio Theater featuring Ronald Colman and Ann Harding. It was also adapted on 21 August 1946 episode of Academy Award Theater with Gregory Peck reprising his leading role.

<text>Cornel Wilde (born Kornél Lajos Weisz; October 13, 1912 – October 16, 1989) was a Hungarian-American actor and filmmaker.

Wilde&#x27;s acting career began in 1935, when he made his debut on Broadway. In 1936 he began making small, uncredited appearances in films. By the 1940s he had signed a contract with 20th Century Fox, and by the mid-1940s he was a major leading man. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in 1945&#x27;s &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;. In the 1950s he moved to writing, producing and directing films, and still continued his career as an actor. He also went into songwriting during his career.

==Early life==
Wilde was born in 1912 in Privigye, Kingdom of Hungary (now Prievidza, Slovakia), although his year and place of birth are usually and inaccurately given as 1915 in New York City. His Hungarian Jewish parents were Vojtech Béla Weisz (anglicized to Louis Bela Wilde) and Renée Mary Vid (Rayna Miryam). He was named for his paternal grandfather, and upon arrival in the United States via first class passage aboard Dutch steamer at the age of seven in 1920, his name was Anglicized to Cornelius Louis Wilde.

A talented linguist and an astute mimic, he had an ear for languages that would later appear in his acting career. Wilde entered Columbia University in New York City as a freshman in the fall of 1929. He fenced for the Columbia Lions fencing team, and won the National Novice Foils Championship held at the New York Athletic Club in 1929.

He qualified for the United States fencing team for the 1936 Summer Olympic Games in Third Reich Berlin, but he quit the team before the games and took a role in the theater. In preparation for an acting career, he and his new wife Marjory Heinzen (later to be known as Patricia Knight) shaved years off their ages, three for him and five for her. As a result, most publicity records and subsequent sources wrongly indicate a 1915 birth for Wilde.

==Career==
===Theatre===
After studying at Theodora Irvine&#x27;s Studio of the Theatre, Wilde began appearing in plays in stock and in New York. He made his Broadway debut in 1935 in &quot;Moon Over Mulberry Street&quot;. He also appeared in &quot;Love Is Not So Simple&quot;, &quot;Daughters of Etreus&quot;, and &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot;.

He did the illustrations for &quot;Fencing&quot;, a 1936 textbook on fencing and wrote a fencing play, &quot;Touché&quot;, under the pseudonym of Clark Wales in 1937. He toured with Tallulah Bankhead in a production of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;; during the run he married his co-star Patricia Knight.

Acting jobs were sporadic over the next few years. Wilde supplemented his income with exhibition fencing matches; his wife also did modelling work. Wilde wrote plays, some of which were performed by the New York Drama Guild.

Wilde was hired as a fencing teacher by Laurence Olivier for his 1940 Broadway production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and was given the role of Tybalt in the production. Although the show only had a small run, his performance in this role netted him a Hollywood film contract with Warner Bros.

===Films===

Wilde had an uncredited bit part in &quot;Lady with Red Hair&quot; (1940), then got a small part in &quot;High Sierra&quot; (1941), which included a scene with Humphrey Bogart. He also had small roles in &quot;Knockout&quot; (1941) and &quot;Kisses for Breakfast&quot; (1941).

Wilde was then signed by 20th Century Fox who gave him a good role in a B picture &quot;The Perfect Snob&quot; (1941). It was followed by a war movie &quot;Manila Calling&quot; (1942). He was the romantic male lead in &quot;Life Begins at Eight-Thirty&quot; (1942), supporting Monty Woolley, and supported Sonja Henie in &quot;Wintertime&quot; (1943).

In 1945, Columbia Pictures began a search for someone to play the role of Frédéric Chopin in &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;. They eventually tested Wilde, and agreed to cast him in the role after some negotiation with Fox, who agreed to lend him to Columbia and one film a year for several years. Part of the deal involved Fox borrowing Alexander Knox from Columbia to appear in &quot;Wilson&quot; (1944). &quot;A Song to Remember&quot; was a big hit, made Wilde a star and earned him a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor.

Columbia promptly used him in two more films, both swashbucklers: as Aladdin in &quot;A Thousand and One Nights&quot; with Evelyn Keyes and as the son of Robin Hood in &quot;The Bandit of Sherwood Forest&quot; (made 1945, released 1946).

Back at Fox, he played the male lead in &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; (1945), with Gene Tierney and Jeanne Crain, an enormous hit at the box office. &quot;Bandit&quot; was also a big hit when it was released.

In 1946, Wilde was voted the 18th-most popular star in the United States, and in 1947 the 25th-. Fox announced him for &quot;Enchanted Voyage&quot;. It ended up not being made; instead he was reunited with Crain in Fox&#x27;s musical &quot;Centennial Summer&quot; (1946).

In January 1946, Wilde was suspended by Fox for refusing the male lead in &quot;Margie&quot; (1946). This suspension was soon lifted so Wilde could play the male lead in the studio&#x27;s big budget version of &quot;Forever Amber&quot; (1947). Filming started, then was halted when the studio decided to replace Peggy Cummins, the female star. In October 1946, Wilde refused to return to work unless he was paid more; his salary was $3,000 a week, with six years to run – he wanted $150,000 per film for two films per year. The parties came to an agreement and filming resumed. Wilde also appeared with Maureen O&#x27;Hara in &quot;The Homestretch&quot; (1947).

He was in a comedy at Columbia with Ginger Rogers, &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; (1947). At Fox he turned down a role in &quot;That Lady in Ermine&quot; (1948). Not wanting to go on suspension again he agreed to make &quot;The Walls of Jericho&quot; (1948), from the same director as &quot;Leave Her to Heaven&quot; but less popular. &quot;Road House&quot; (1948), for Fox, was a highly regarded film noir and a decent-sized hit. He then left Fox, which he later regarded as a mistake.

===Freelance===
At Columbia, Wilde was in &quot;Shockproof&quot; (1949), another noir, with his then-wife Patricia Knight. They appeared together in &quot;Western Wind&quot;, a play at the Cape Playhouse.

Wilde made &quot;Swiss Tour&quot;, aka &quot;Four Days Leave&quot; (1949), an independent film in Switzerland. He returned to Fox for &quot;Two Flags West&quot; (1950), then went to RKO for &quot;At Sword&#x27;s Point&quot; (filmed in 1949, but not released until 1952), a swashbuckler with Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

Cast in the male lead, he played a trapeze artist in &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952) for Cecil B. de Mille, an enormous ensemble cast hit.

At Columbia, he was in &quot;California Conquest&quot; (1952), a Western for producer Sam Katzman. He went over to Warner Bros. for &quot;Operation Secret&quot; (1952), then was back at Fox for &quot;Treasure of the Golden Condor&quot; (1952).

He focused on adventure stories: &quot;Saadia&quot; (1953) for MGM, &quot;Star of India&quot; (1954) for United Artists. He had a part in the all-star executive drama &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot; (1954) for Fox, then went back to action and adventure with &quot;Passion&quot; (1954) for RKO.

==Producer and director==
In the 1950s Wilde and his second wife, Jean Wallace, formed their own film production company, Theodora, named after Theodora Irvine. Their first movie was the film noir &quot;The Big Combo&quot; (1955), a co production with Security Pictures that was released through Allied Artists. Wilde and Wallace played the leads. That year he also directed an episode of &quot;General Electric Theatre&quot;.

That same year, he appeared in an episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; as himself and starred in &quot;The Scarlet Coat&quot; (1956) for MGM.

Wilde produced and starred in another film for Theodora with Wallace, &quot;Storm Fear&quot; (1956) from a script by Horton Foote. This time Wilde also directed &quot;to save money&quot;.

Theodora announced Wilde would play Lord Byron, but the film was never made. Other announced projects included &quot;Curly&quot; and &quot;Second Act Curtin&quot;.

Wilde was meant to appear as Joshua in de Mille&#x27;s &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956) but was not in the final film – he turned down the role, saying it was too small and the pay was too little (John Derek ended up playing it). Wilde later said it was his worst mistake because having even a small role in a big blockbuster would have given him career momentum.

As an actor only, he appeared in &quot;Hot Blood&quot; (1956) with Jane Russell for director Nicholas Ray, and &quot;Beyond Mombasa&quot; (1956), shot in Kenya; both were released by Columbia. In 1957, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; as himself. Also in 1957, he played the role of the 13th century Persian poet Omar Khayyám in the film &quot;Omar Khayyam&quot;.

Wilde produced, directed and starred in two films for Theodora that were released through Paramount Pictures: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Hairpin&quot; (1957), a car-racing drama, and &quot;Maracaibo&quot; (1958). Wilde called them &quot;an acceptable A-B, meaning a picture with a B budget but A pretensions&quot;.

He had the lead in &quot;Edge of Eternity&quot; (1959) for director Don Siegel.

Wilde went to Italy to star in &quot;Constantine and the Cross&quot; (1962). In Britain, he wrote, produced, directed and starred in &quot;Lancelot and Guinevere&quot; (1963).

Wilde produced, directed, and starred in &quot;The Naked Prey&quot; (1965), in which he played a man stripped naked and chased by hunters from an African tribe that was affronted by the behavior of other members of his safari party. The original script was largely based on a true historical incident about a trapper named John Colter being pursued by Blackfeet Indians in Wyoming. Lower shooting costs, tax breaks, and material and logistical assistance offered by Rhodesia persuaded Wilde and the other producers to shoot the film on location in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). It is probably his most highly regarded film as director.

Wilde followed this with a war movie, &quot;Beach Red&quot; (1967), shot in the Philippines. He announced &quot;Namugongo&quot;, another movie in Africa, about the White Fathers missionaries in the Kingdom of Buganda, but it was never made. He had a supporting role in &quot;The Comic&quot; (1969), directed by Carl Reiner.

He wrote, produced, and directed the science fiction film &quot;No Blade of Grass&quot; (1970). He returned to film shortly thereafter and wrote, directed, and starred in the exploitation film &quot;Sharks&#x27; Treasure&quot;, a 1975 film intended to capitalize on the &quot;Shark Fever&quot; popular in the mid-1970s in the wake of the success of Peter Benchley&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;.

He acted in &quot;The Norseman&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979).

Wilde&#x27;s other TV performances include an appearance in the 1957 episode of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; &quot;An Evening to Remember.&quot; He appeared as an unethical surgeon in the 1971 &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode &quot;Deliveries in the Rear&quot; and portrayed an anthropologist in the 1972 TV movie &quot;Gargoyles&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1937, he married actress Patricia Knight. She starred alongside him in &quot;Shockproof&quot; (1949). Their daughter, Wendy, was born on February 22, 1943. The family lived at Country House on Deep Canyon Road, Los Angeles. They divorced in 1951.

Five days after his divorce, he married actress Jean Wallace. Wilde became stepfather to Wallace&#x27;s two sons, Pascal and Thomas, from her marriage to Franchot Tone. Their son, Cornel Wallace Wilde, was born on December 19, 1967. Wilde senior and Wallace starred together in several films including &quot;The Big Combo&quot; (1955), &quot;Lancelot and Guinevere&quot; (1963), and &quot;Beach Red&quot; (1967). They divorced in 1981.

At the time of his death in 1989 he was engaged to Colleen Conte, the widow of actor Richard Conte. Richard Conte had starred in Wilde&#x27;s film &quot;The Big Combo&quot;.

A Democrat, Wilde supported the campaign of Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.

==Death==
Wilde died of leukemia on October 16, 1989, three days after his 77th birthday and just weeks after he had been diagnosed with the blood disease. He is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Cornel Wilde has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1635 Vine Street.

<text>A Song to Remember is a 1945 American biographical film which tells a fictionalised life story of Polish pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin. Directed by Charles Vidor and starring Paul Muni, Merle Oberon, and Cornel Wilde.

==Plot==
Frederic Chopin, a talented young pianist and composer, captivates his teacher Professor Józef Elsner with his extraordinary skills at the age of 11. Elsner receives an invitation from the renowned music publisher Louis Pleyel to bring Chopin to Paris, hoping to replicate the success of Franz Liszt. However, Chopin&#x27;s father cannot afford the expenses. While discussing the future, Chopin&#x27;s attention is diverted by the plight of Polish people being taken prisoners by the Russian authorities. He becomes determined to fight for Poland&#x27;s freedom. Amidst his secret political activities, Chopin continues his musical journey with the support of Elsner, who is still determined to see him succeed in Paris.

Chopin is invited to perform at Count Wyszynka&#x27;s banquet, but he discovers that the Russian Governor of Poland is among the guests. Outraged, Chopin refuses to play for the oppressors and storms out. His friends warn him of the impending danger, urging him to flee to Paris. With Elsner&#x27;s help, Chopin finally arrives in Paris, where they meet Pleyel, who initially dismisses them until he hears Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Polonaise&quot;. Impressed, Pleyel promises to arrange a concert for Chopin.

The professor takes Chopin to Café de la Bohème, where they encounter famous personalities such as Liszt, Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas, and Honoré de Balzac. Despite a turbulent encounter with a critic, Friedrich Kalkbrenner, Chopin is introduced to Liszt, who introduces him to George Sand, a writer known for her masculine attire. The night before Chopin&#x27;s crucial debut, a letter arrives bearing tragic news of his friends&#x27; arrests and deaths in Poland. Overwhelmed by grief, Chopin performs the first bars of his &quot;Heroic Polonaise&quot; during his concert and abruptly leaves the stage. The reviews are harsh, except for one written by George Sand, who praises Chopin as a genius.

Sand invites Chopin and Elsner to a reception hosted by the Duchess of Orléans, where Chopin&#x27;s talent is acknowledged by Liszt and the attendees. Pleyel expresses interest in promoting Chopin&#x27;s music and arranges a meeting for the following day. However, Chopin chooses to spend time with Sand instead, reveling in their success. Sand convinces Chopin to stay with her in Majorca, where he can focus solely on composition. While Sand supports Chopin&#x27;s fame, her insistence on keeping him away from the concert stage prolongs his life as he battles tuberculosis.

Back in Paris, Pleyel eagerly awaits Chopin&#x27;s return to arrange concerts and publish his music. Meanwhile, Elsner faces financial struggles and returns to teaching. The professor learns from Liszt that Chopin occasionally performs at salons and secures invitations for Elsner. With news of Poland&#x27;s crushed uprising and the plight of their imprisoned comrades, Constantia, a friend of Chopin&#x27;s, implores him to rally support or gather funds to aid the cause. Initially disengaged, Chopin&#x27;s sense of patriotism is awakened when Constantia brings him Polish earth.

Chopin reunites with Elsner and ends his relationship with Sand to embark on an international tour to raise money for Poland, fully aware that it will further deteriorate his health. His illness worsens, and during a passionate performance, blood stains the keys. Eventually, the strain of the tour takes its toll, and Chopin&#x27;s health deteriorates further. On his deathbed, he longs to see Sand one last time, but she, posing for Delacroix, refuses to visit. Chopin dies with Kalkbrenner, Pleyel, Elsner, and Constantia by his side, while Liszt plays the piano in the adjacent room.

==Cast==

==Reception==
&quot;A Song to Remember&quot; was nominated for several Academy Awards: Best Actor in a Leading Role (Cornel Wilde), Best Cinematography, Color, Best Film Editing, Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture, Best Sound, Recording (John P. Livadary), and Best Writing, Original Story.

Though Chopin was a true Polish patriot, Vidor highly romanticizes Chopin&#x27;s patriotism in the film, which was produced during World War II. He fictionalizes Chopin&#x27;s relationship with Elsner (who did not really accompany him to Paris) and greatly distorts Chopin&#x27;s relationship with Sand to produce a &quot;good vs. evil&quot; struggle for Chopin&#x27;s soul between Elsner and Sand. The script occasionally sounds more like propaganda for wartime self-sacrifice over individualism than like the real story of Chopin&#x27;s life.

Ayn Rand was sharply critical of the film, strongly taking the side of the George Sand character as against the Polish nationalist ones – a value judgment diametrically opposite to that taken by the film makers: &quot;George Sand, according to the film, is evil because she provides a beautiful, private retreat where Chopin can live in peace and luxury, because she takes care of his every need, attends to his health, and urges him to forget the world and devote himself exclusively to the work of writing music, which he is desperately eager to do. The young Polish girl, according to the film, is good because she urges Chopin to drop the work that he loves and go out on a concert tour to collect money &#x27;for the people&#x27;, for a cause that is identified as national or revolutionary or both, and this is supposed to justify everything – so she demands that Chopin renounce his genius, sacrifice his composing and go out to entertain paying audiences – even though he hates concert playing, is ill with tuberculosis and has been warned by the doctors that the strain of a tour will kill him&quot;.

Victor Brown noted that &quot;The breakup of George Sand&#x27;s relationship with Chopin was for personal reasons completely different from those shown in the film – mainly Chopin&#x27;s siding with Sand&#x27;s estranged daughter against her mother. In fact, George Sand was an outspoken supporter of the Polish national cause in her own right, an allegiance which lasted long past the end of the relationship with Chopin. During the Revolution of 1848 in France, George Sand took part in a Polish solidarity demonstration held in Paris on May 15, 1848, calling for the French Army to be sent to liberate Poland&quot;.

The pianist José Iturbi played the piano music, and also orchestrated part of the B minor Sonata for the scene when Chopin and George Sand arrive in Majorca. The hands of pianist Ervin Nyiregyházi are shown playing the piano.

==Legacy==
Liberace&#x27;s trademark electric candelabrum was inspired by a similar prop in &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;.

<doc id="149787" wikidata="Q622815" url="?curid=149787" title="Grand Funk Railroad">
<text>Grand Funk Railroad (often shortened to Grand Funk) is an American rock band formed in Flint, Michigan, in 1969 by Mark Farner (vocals, guitar, keyboards, harmonica), Don Brewer (drums, vocals) and Mel Schacher (bass). The band achieved peak popularity and success during the 1970s with hit songs such as &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Captain (Closer to Home)&quot;, &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; (a cover of Soul Brothers Six), &quot;Walk Like a Man&quot;, &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; (a cover of Little Eva), &quot;Bad Time&quot; and &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; (a cover of the Animals). Grand Funk released six platinum and seven gold-certified albums between their recording debut in 1969 and their first disbandment in 1976.

Known for a crowd-pleasing arena rock style, the band toured extensively and played to packed arenas worldwide, and was well-regarded by audiences despite a relative lack of critical praise. The original trio reunited at various times later into the band&#x27;s career; after Farner&#x27;s final departure in 1998, Brewer and Schacher have continued touring as Grand Funk Railroad.

== History ==
=== Formation (1969) ===
Grand Funk Railroad was formed as a trio in 1969 by Mark Farner and Don Brewer from Terry Knight and the Pack and Mel Schacher from Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians. Terry Knight, after being approached by Brewer, soon became the band&#x27;s manager and also named the band originally &quot;Grand Trunk Railroad&quot; as a play on words for the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, a well-known rail line in Michigan. The railroad objected to using their name, and the band was forced to change the name to Grand Funk Railroad. 

Mark Farner talks of the circumstances leading up to the formation of Grand Funk Railroad:
The band first achieved recognition at the 1969 Atlanta International Pop Festival, after their local promoter, Jeep Holland, got them the slot for no monetary compensation, and after opening the first day, the band went down so well that they were invited to appear on all three days. This exposure proved to be invaluable, and the band was signed by Capitol Records, where their manager, Knight, was working as an A&amp;R person. After a raucous, well-received set on the first day of the festival, Grand Funk was asked back to play at the 1970 Atlanta International Pop Festival II the following year. Patterned after hard-rock power trios such as Cream, the band, with Terry Knight&#x27;s marketing savvy, developed its popular style. 

In August 1969, the band released its first album titled &quot;On Time&quot;, which sold over 1,000,000 copies and was awarded a gold record in 1970. The album topped the American album charts. 

In February 1970, a second album, &quot;Grand Funk&quot; (or &quot;The Red Album&quot;), was awarded gold status less than 2 months after its release. Despite critical pans and little airplay, the group&#x27;s first eight albums (seven studio releases and one live album) were quite successful.

=== Early 1970s ===
The hit single &quot;I&#x27;m Your Captain (Closer to Home)&quot;, from the album &quot;Closer to Home&quot;, released in June 1970, was considered stylistically representative of Terry Knight and the Pack&#x27;s recordings. In the spring of 1970, Knight launched an intensive advertising campaign to promote the album &quot;Closer to Home&quot;. That album was certified multiplatinum despite a lack of critical approval. The band spent $100,000 on a New York City Times Square billboard to advertise &quot;Closer to Home&quot;.

By 1971, Grand Funk equaled the Beatles&#x27; Shea Stadium attendance record but sold out the venue in just 72 hours, whereas the Beatles concert took a few weeks to sell out. Following &quot;Closer to Home&quot;, The double disc &quot;Live Album&quot; was also released later in 1970 and was another gold disc recipient. &quot;Survival&quot; and &quot;E Pluribus Funk&quot; were both released in 1971. &quot;E Pluribus Funk&quot; celebrated the Shea Stadium show with an embossed depiction of the stadium on the album cover&#x27;s reverse.

By late 1971, the band was concerned with Knight&#x27;s managerial style and fiscal responsibility. This growing dissatisfaction led Grand Funk Railroad to fire Knight in early 1972. Knight sued for breach of contract, which resulted in a protracted legal battle. Knight repossessed the band&#x27;s gear at one point before a gig at Madison Square Garden. In VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; Grand Funk Railroad episode, Knight stated that the original contract would have run out in about three months and that the wise decision for the band would have been to wait out the time. However, at that moment, the band members felt they had no choice but to continue and fight for the rights to their careers and name. The legal battle with Knight lasted 2 years and ended when the band settled out of court. Knight became the clear winner with the copyrights and publisher&#x27;s royalties to every Grand Funk recording made from March 1969 through March 1972, not to mention an enormous payoff in cash and oil wells. Farner, Brewer, and Schacher were given the rights to the name Grand Funk Railroad.

In 1972, Grand Funk Railroad added former Fabulous Pack bandmate Craig Frost on keyboards full-time. Originally, the band had attempted to attract Peter Frampton, late of Humble Pie; however, he was not available due to signing a solo record deal with A&amp;M Records. The addition of Frost, however, was a stylistic shift from Grand Funk&#x27;s original garage-band-based rock &amp; roll roots to a more rhythm &amp; blues/pop rock-oriented style. With the new lineup, Grand Funk released &quot;Phoenix&quot;, its sixth album of original music, in September 1972.
To refine Grand Funk&#x27;s sound, the band secured veteran musician Todd Rundgren as a producer. With the band’s name shortened to Grand Funk, its two most successful albums and two number-one hit singles resulted: the Don Brewer-penned &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; (from the number two album &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot;, released in July 1973) and &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; (from their 1974 number five album &quot;Shinin&#x27; On&quot;, written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin and originally recorded by Little Eva). &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot; became Grand Funk&#x27;s first number-one hit on Farner&#x27;s 25th birthday, followed by Brewer&#x27;s number-19 hit &quot;Walk Like a Man.&quot; &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; in 1974 was Grand Funk&#x27;s second chart-topping single, followed by Brewer&#x27;s number-11 hit &quot;Shinin&#x27; On&quot;. The band continued touring the U.S., Europe, and Japan.

=== Mid-1970s ===
In 1974, Grand Funk engaged Jimmy Ienner as producer and reverted to using their full name: Grand Funk Railroad. The cover of &quot;All the Girls in the World Beware!!!&quot; (December 1974) depicted the band members&#x27; heads superimposed on the bodies of bodybuilders Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu. This album spawned the band&#x27;s last two top-10 hits, &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot; and &quot;Bad Time&quot; in late 1974/early 1975.

Although they were highly successful in the mid-1970s, tensions mounted within the band due to personal issues, burn-out, and disputes over musical direction. Despite these issues, Grand Funk forged ahead. Needing 2 more albums to complete their record deal with Capitol, Grand Funk embarked on a major tour and decided to record a double live album, &quot;Caught in the Act&quot; (August 1975).

The double album should have fulfilled the contract with Capitol; however, because it contained previously released material, Capitol requested an additional album to complete Grand Funk&#x27;s contractual obligation. While pressures between the band members still existed, they agreed to move forward and complete one more album for Capitol to avoid legalities similar to those they endured with Terry Knight in 1972. The band recorded &quot;Born to Die&quot; (January 1976), but its lower sales (it only managed to reach #47 on the Billboard chart) and lack of hit singles disappointed the group. They began to drift apart, and rumours of a breakup were circulating.

However, Grand Funk found new life from interest by Frank Zappa in producing the band. Signing with MCA Records, the resulting album &quot;Good Singin&#x27;, Good Playin&#x27;&quot; (August 1976), although it netted them some of their best critical reviews ever, yielded little success. After this, a disillusioned Grand Funk Railroad disbanded in earnest in late 1976. Farner recalled what happened then: &quot;Things were disenfranchised within the band. I don&#x27;t want to speculate about what was going on in Brewer&#x27;s life—his first wife died, and that was rough—but one day he walked into the studio and said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve had it. I need to find something to do with my life that&#x27;s more stable.&#x27; He was done. He walked out and slammed the door. It was him, not me. Everybody thinks I broke the band up, but it was him.&quot;

=== First disbanding, 1976–1981; new lineup in the early 1980s ===
Following the breakup, Farner began a solo career and signed with Atlantic Records, which resulted in two albums: &quot;Mark Farner&quot; (1977) and &quot;No Frills&quot; (1978). Brewer, Schacher and Frost remained intact and formed the band Flint. Flint released one 1978 album on Columbia Records; a second record was finished but never released.

In 1981, Grand Funk Railroad reunited after being approached by their former manager Andy Caviliere (who had taken over from Terry Knight in 1972). The reunion took place without Frost (who was playing with Bob Seger) and with Dennis Bellinger replacing Schacher on bass. Schacher begged off saying he had developed a fear of flying but later admitted that he had no longer wanted to be involved with Caviliere.

The new lineup released two albums on Irving Azoff&#x27;s Full Moon label, distributed by Warner Bros. Records. These releases included &quot;Grand Funk Lives&quot; (July 1981) and &quot;What&#x27;s Funk?&quot; (January 1983). Neither album achieved much in the way of critical acclaim or sales; but the single &quot;Queen Bee&quot; was included in the film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and its soundtrack album.

The band toured in 1981 and 1982 with Rick Baker joining them on the road to play keyboards. But the dismal sales of &quot;Grand Funk Lives&quot; and the death of manager Caviliere in 1982 caused the group to disband a second time in early 1983, shortly after &quot;What&#x27;s Funk?&quot; was released.

===Second disbanding, 1983–1996===
Farner continued as a solo performer and became a Christian recording artist while Brewer went on to join Frost in Bob Seger&#x27;s Silver Bullet Band. Farner was promoted by David Fishof in the late 1980s and was a part of Fishof&#x27;s concept Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band in 1995. After that, Fishof began sounding out Farner, Brewer and Schacher about reuniting again.

=== Re-formation, 1996–present ===
After some rehearsals in late 1995, Grand Funk Railroad&#x27;s three original members (joined on tour by keyboardist/guitarist and background vocalist Howard Eddy Jr.) once again reunited in 1996 and played to 500,000 people during a three-year period.

In 1997 the band played three sold-out Bosnian benefit concerts. These shows featured a full symphony orchestra that was conducted by Paul Shaffer (from &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;). The band released a live two-disc benefit CD called &quot;Bosnia&quot; recorded in Auburn Hills, Michigan. This live recording also featured Peter Frampton, Alto Reed and Howard Eddy Jr.

In late 1998, Farner left the band after disagreements with Brewer and returned to his solo career. And after a two-year hiatus, when Brewer and Schacher once again approached Farner about reuniting, he turned them down after they refused to honor his desire to be paid fifty percent, rather than a third of the group&#x27;s revenue as in the past. He explained his reason in his autobiography, &quot;From Grand Funk to Grace&quot;: &quot;I do a hell of a lot more work on stage. I wrote the vast majority of the songs. During the 1990s, I committed to two years with Grand Funk. That first year we only did 14 dates. I ended up putting in three years. That was my mistake. I wasn&#x27;t going to lose money again. At the time, each of us individually owned the Grand Funk trademark. In 1998 Don Brewer suggested we form a corporation to limit our liability as individuals on the road and I agreed. Unfortunately this meant that two thirds of the corporation is the majority&quot;. And so in late 2000, Brewer and Schacher voted to go forward without Farner, recruiting lead vocalist Max Carl (formerly of Jack Mack &amp; the Heart Attack and 38 Special), former Kiss lead guitarist Bruce Kulick and keyboardist Tim Cashion (Bob Seger, Robert Palmer) to complete the new lineup.

In 2005 Grand Funk Railroad was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.

In 2018 Brewer and Schacher sued Farner for filing a trademark for the name &quot;Mark Farner&#x27;s American Band&quot;. The lawsuit stated that Farner had violated a 2004 agreement, which called for, among other things: that Farner&#x27;s first and last names appear in capital letters before a reference to Grand Funk or Grand Funk Railroad, with only the first letters of the band capitalized, and first letters of the words, &quot;former,&quot; &quot;formerly&quot; and &quot;member&quot; also capitalized. Another round of this lawsuit by Brewer and Schacher was filed two days after Mark Farner&#x27;s son, Jessie Farner, had passed away.

Also in 2018, bassist Stanley Sheldon (ex-Peter Frampton) filled in for Schacher after Schacher&#x27;s wife, Dena, died of cancer.

In 2019 Grand Funk&#x27;s main hit writer, Mark Farner, was handed a legal victory to tour as &quot;Mark Farner&#x27;s American Band&quot;, after his ex-bandmates sued him to prevent him from using that name. Farner revealed that since the 2004 lawsuit, he was constantly sued by Brewer and Schacher over the mentions of Grand Funk Railroad by his promoters, and that many of his shows since 2004 were cancelled because of the injunctions against him by Brewer and Schacher.

Grand Funk Railroad continues to tour, and kicked off its &quot;The American Band Tour 2019&quot;, &quot;Celebrating 50 Years of Funk&quot; tour on January 17, 2019.

On January 2, 2024 Bruce Kulick announced he was departing Grand Funk Railroad after 23 years, having played his final concert with the group on December 14, 2023 in Marietta, Ohio, citing that he wanted to focus on other projects. On January 4, 2024 Grand Funk Railroad announced that singer-guitarist Mark Chatfield (The Godz, Rosie, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band) would replace Bruce Kulick as permanent member of GFR.

<text>Samuel Lawrence Klusman Parks (December 13, 1914 – April 13, 1975) was an American stage and film actor. His career arced from bit player and supporting roles to top billing, before it virtually ended when he admitted to having been a member of a Communist Party cell, which led to his blacklisting by all Hollywood studios. His best known role was Al Jolson, whom he portrayed in two films: &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; (1946) and &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot; (1949).

==Life and career==
Parks was born in Olathe, Kansas, the son of Nellie (Klusman) and Frank H. Parks. He was raised in his mother&#x27;s religion of Judaism. He grew up in Joliet, Illinois, and graduated from Joliet Township High School in 1932.

He attended the University of Illinois as a pre-med student, and played in stock companies for some years.

He traveled to Hollywood at John Garfield&#x27;s suggestion, for a role in a Warner Bros. production of &quot;Mama Ravioli&quot;. Although the movie was cancelled, Parks did sign a contract with Columbia Pictures in 1941.

==Supporting player==
As with most Columbia contract players, Parks received supporting roles in high-budget films and more substantial roles in B pictures.

=== In supporting roles===

* &quot;Mystery Ship&quot;

==Leading man==
By 1944 Parks broke into lead and featured player roles:
* &quot;The Black Parachute&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Stars on Parade&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Sergeant Mike&quot; (1944)
* &quot;She&#x27;s a Sweetheart&quot; (1944)
* &quot;Counter-Attack&quot; (1945) 
* &quot;Renegades&quot; (1946)

When Columbia was preparing a screen biography of Al Jolson, many big-name stars were considered for the title role, including James Cagney and Danny Thomas (both of whom turned it down), but resident contractee Larry Parks was reportedly the first actor to be interviewed. Parks impressed the producers and won the role. At the age of 31, his performance in &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; (1946) earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.

==Stardom ==

Now that Parks was a fully-fledged star, Columbia kept him busy in elaborate productions. He appeared opposite the studio&#x27;s biggest star, Rita Hayworth, in &quot;Down to Earth&quot; (1947). That year, exhibitors voted him the 15th-biggest star in the US.

Then, he made some swashbucklers, &quot;The Swordsman&quot; (1948) and &quot;The Gallant Blade&quot; (1948). Parks tried to break his contract with Columbia in 1948, but was unsuccessful. That year he criticised the House Un-American Activities Committee (&quot;HUAC&quot;).

He made &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot; (1949), which was another huge box-office hit. His co-star in the film, Barbara Hale, teamed with him again in the comedy feature &quot;Emergency Wedding&quot; (1950). In 1950 he and his wife announced plans to make their own film &quot;Stakeout&quot;. British exhibitors voted him the 9th-most popular star in the UK.

==Blacklisting==
In 1951, Parks was summoned to appear before the &quot;HUAC&quot; under threat of being blacklisted in the movie industry, but he begged not to be forced to testify. He eventually did so in tears, only to be blacklisted anyway. Parks eventually gave up the names of his former colleagues to the committee.

Following his admission before the committee, Columbia Pictures dropped him from his contract, although it had four years to run, and Parks had been set to star in the film &quot;Small Wonder&quot; (which later became &quot;The First Time&quot;). At the time, Parks&#x27; fee was $75,000 a film. A romantic comedy he made for MGM, &quot;Love Is Better Than Ever&quot;, was shelved for a year.

He made a TV film for &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot; in 1953 and starred in the British film &quot;Tiger by the Tail&quot; (1955) in England.

He continued to squeeze out a living acting on the stage and doing occasional television programs. His last appearance in a major role was in the John Huston film, &quot;&quot; (1962).

===Later career===
Parks eventually left the film industry and formed a successful construction business. Eventually, he and his wife, Betty Garrett, owned many apartment buildings scattered throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Rather than sell them upon completion, Parks decided to retain ownership and collect rents as a landlord, a decision that proved to be extremely profitable. During that period, the couple occasionally performed in Las Vegas showrooms, summer stock productions, and touring companies of Broadway shows.

==Personal life==
Parks married actress Betty Garrett in 1944. She starred in Hollywood films such as &quot;On the Town&quot; and on television as Archie Bunker&#x27;s neighbor Irene Lorenzo on &quot;All in the Family&quot; and as landlady Edna Babish on &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;. Her career also faced turmoil as a result of her marriage to Parks, and the two spent much of the 1950s doing theatre and musical variety shows. Together, they had two sons, actor Andrew Parks and composer Garrett Parks. Larry Parks was also godfather to actor Jeff Bridges.

A Democrat, he supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign in the 1952 presidential election.

Parks died of a heart attack in 1975 at the age of 60.

<text>The Jolson Story is a 1946 American biographical musical film, a highly fictionalized account of the life of singer Al Jolson. It stars Larry Parks as Jolson, Evelyn Keyes as Julie Benson (approximating Jolson&#x27;s wife, Ruby Keeler), William Demarest as his performing partner and manager, Ludwig Donath and Tamara Shayne as his parents, and Scotty Beckett as the young Jolson. Some of the film&#x27;s episodes are based on fact but the story is extremely simplified, with people disguised or combined into single characters.

The Columbia Pictures production was written by Sidney Buchman (uncredited), Harry Chandlee, Stephen Longstreet, and Andrew Solt. The dramatic scenes were directed by Alfred E. Green, with the musical sequences directed by Joseph H. Lewis.

==Plot==
Stage-struck Asa Yoelson wants to sing in burlesque performer Steve Martin&#x27;s act. Cantor Yoelson, his father, refuses to consider it. After Asa runs away but is found in Baltimore, the Yoelsons grudgingly consent. Martin eventually gives him billing, under a new name: Al Jolson. Soon afterwards, an entertainer named Tom Barron, who is in the same show as Martin and Jolson, passes out drunk, and Jolson goes on in his place. Jolson receives a job offer from minstrel-show master Lew Dockstader, who is in the audience, and Martin releases Jolson.

Al succeeds with the minstrel troupe and is invited to join a Broadway show (thanks to Martin, behind the scenes). Al becomes the leading player and takes the show on tour. Al hires his old mentor Martin, now unemployed, to be his manager. (In real life, Jolson never had a manager with this name. Jolson had three managers over the course of his career- Steve Martin is a composite of all three.)

Jolson&#x27;s career prevents him spending much time at home. He had always bargained on marrying his childhood friend, Ann Murray, but she eventually accepts a proposal from Roy Anderson, another childhood friend.

Soon afterwards, Al meets up-and-coming dancer Julie Benson. It is love at first sight for Al, who proposes to her that night. (Al Jolson was actually married four times. The character Julie Benson is modeled on his third wife, Ruby Keeler.) Julie does not love him immediately, but Al refuses to take no for an answer, and she eventually agrees to consider it. After Al misses a show in order to attend the opening of Julie&#x27;s first show, she realises his feelings for her are genuine and they marry. Al electrifies the show world with his first feature film, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, and eagerly signs for more movies. His wife wants to quit show business and settle down, but Al persuades her to continue with her career. Julie becomes a movie star, but eventually can&#x27;t stand any more of Al&#x27;s nonstop, show-biz lifestyle. Al realizes that the only way to keep Julie is to quit show business.

Al refuses all job offers and absolutely will not sing, even for family and friends. Papa Yoelson persuades his son to join him in a songthe music he and Mama Yoelson danced to at their weddingand Al gets caught up in it. They adjourn to a nightclub, where the audience demands a song. Al agrees to a single number but the crowd yells for more. Julie, seeing Al happier than he&#x27;s been in years, leaves while he&#x27;s performing. She walks out of the nightclub and out of his life, leaving Al to his first love: singing.

==Cast==

==Plot accuracy==
Much of the plot was fictionalized. There is no evidence that Jolson ever appeared as a child singer. His mother is shown as still alive at the end of the picture. In fact, she died in 1895, when he was 9 years old, and he was brought up by his sister. His brother Harry is eliminated as is much of his early career. Jolson actually had three managers, who were combined into the William Demarest character &quot;Steve Martin&quot;. Ruby Keeler, Jolson&#x27;s third wife, refused to allow her name to be used, so the writers used an alias, &quot;Julie Benson&quot;.

==Production==
Larry Parks&#x27; vocals were recorded by Al Jolson; Scotty Beckett&#x27;s songs were recorded by Rudy Wissler. Al Jolson, determined to appear on screen somehow, persuaded the producer to film him instead of Larry Parks for the blackface &quot;Swanee&quot; number. Jolson is seen entirely in long shot; he performs on a theater runway, recreating his famous fluttering dance step.

Filming was already under way as a black-and-white feature when studio chief Harry Cohn, encouraged by the scenes already filmed, decided to start the project all over as a Technicolor production. Cohn was impressed by director Joseph H. Lewis&#x27;s handling of the musical numbers in the 1944 PRC feature &quot;Minstrel Man&quot;, and hired Lewis to stage the musical sequences for the Jolson project.

Jolson had a 50% share of the profits.

==Reception==
The film was a tremendous financial success, and won Academy Awards for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture (Morris Stoloff), and Best Sound Recording (John Livadary). It was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Larry Parks), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (William Demarest), Best Cinematography, Color (Joseph Walker) and Best Film Editing (William A. Lyon). The film was also entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival.

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; has a rating of 100% based on 5 reviews.

Larry Parks became a full-fledged star in major productions, until his career was derailed by blacklisting after he admitted to having been a member of the Communist Party before the House Unamerican Activities Committee in 1951. His sudden rise to prominence was considered an &quot;overnight success,&quot; though he had been featured in Columbia&#x27;s low-budget features for five years. Parks continued playing character leads, but was most associated with his interpretation of Jolson. Columbia cast him in a successful sequel, &quot;Jolson Sings Again&quot; (1949).

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

==Radio adaptation== 
&quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot; presented &quot;The Jolson Story&quot; on February 16, 1948. Jolson starred as himself in the one-hour adaptation. Jolson also starred in a Lux adaptation of his first feature &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;, supported by &quot;Jolson Story&quot; actors Ludwig Donath and Tamara Shayne.

==Quotations==
* &quot;I heard some music tonight. Something they call &#x27;jazz.&#x27; The fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it out of the air.&quot; (Jolson to Dockstader)
* &quot;[I&#x27;m] trying to make songs out of music I picked up. Music nobody ever heard of before, but the only kind I want to sing.&quot; (Jolson, explaining what he&#x27;s been doing)
* &quot;That&#x27;s an audience that never saw a live show. People in small towns who can afford a movie, where they can&#x27;t afford anything else. Audience of millions. I&#x27;d be singing to every one of them at the same time. That&#x27;s really something!&quot; (Jolson, discussing the new talking picture)
* &quot;Tonight, folks, I&#x27;m only going to sing two thousand songs. One to a customer.&quot; (Jolson)
* &quot;Broadway? What a street! You know something, baby? It belongs to me. You know something else? If you want it, I&#x27;ll give it to you.&quot; (Jolson)

<text>A Double Life is a 1947 American film noir that tells the story of an actor whose mind becomes affected by the character whom he portrays. It stars Ronald Colman and Signe Hasso and was directed by George Cukor, with its screenplay written by Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Colman won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.

==Plot==
Celebrated stage actor Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; John is offered the lead in a new production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; by theatrical producer Max Lasker, who wants Tony&#x27;s ex-wife Brita to costar as Desdemona. Tony initially declines the offer, to the relief of director Victor Donlan, who knows that Tony becomes overly involved in his roles. Brita agrees with Donlan and warns press agent Bill Friend that although Tony&#x27;s mood is delightful when appearing in a comedy, he is terrifying when performing in a drama. She warns Friend that Tony becomes so immersed in roles that they can become his reality.

Tony changes his mind after becoming obsessed with the idea of portraying Othello. While contemplating the role, Tony meets waitress Pat Kroll and they begin a casual affair. Brita reluctantly accepts the role of Desdemona and rehearsals begin. The production opens to rave reviews, but Tony gradually becomes absorbed in his role and begins to lose sight of where the play ends and his real life begins. Tony sees jealousy as the key to his character.

Brita shows Tony a locket that Bill gave her for her birthday, sparking a jealous rage in Tony. That night, during Othello&#x27;s &quot;kiss of death&quot; scene with Desdemona, Tony becomes overcome with the role and nearly chokes Brita to death. When the play begins its second year, Tony asks Brita to remarry him, but she refuses. Tony suspects that Brita is in love with Bill. Enraged, confused and delirious, Tony visits Pat&#x27;s apartment, where the play and reality become conflated in his mind and he kills Pat with Othello&#x27;s &quot;kiss of death.&quot; Tony returns to Brita&#x27;s house and falls asleep on her couch.

Reporter Al Cooley offers Bill front-page publicity for the play by highlighting the similarities between Pat&#x27;s murder and Othello&#x27;s &quot;kiss of death.&quot; Tony is enraged when he sees the story and physically attacks Bill. However, Bill suspects that Tony is Pat&#x27;s killer and reports his suspicion to the police, only to find that Pat&#x27;s drunken neighbor has been arrested for her murder. Tony demands Bill&#x27;s dismissal, and Bill plans a short vacation. Bill tells Brita that he loves her, but Brita does not return his feelings. However, Brita reveals to Bill that Tony left her home on the night of Pat&#x27;s murder.

Bill hires an actress to dress up as Pat and plants her as a waitress in the restaurant where Pat had worked. Bill invites Tony to the restaurant, and with police captain Pete Bonner watching, Tony becomes distraught upon seeing Pat&#x27;s double and rushes out of the restaurant. Suspicious now, Bill and the police follow Tony to the theater. Standing in the wings, they watch the performance and are seen there by Tony. At the climax of the performance of &quot;Othello&quot; that evening, a guilt-ridden Tony stabs himself with a real dagger at the point at which Othello does the same within the play. Backstage, bleeding from his self-inflicted wound, he confesses all and dies.

==Cast==
==Production==

The leading role had originally been slated for Laurence Olivier. Colman was initially hesitant about performing Shakespeare on screen, so to reassure him, director George Cukor told Colman that the film would provide him with a great chance to win an Oscar (which he later won); Colman had been nominated three times in the past.

The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Imagination&quot;. After filming had wrapped, Cukor recalled the cast for four additional days of shooting.

&quot;A Double Life&quot; was the 500th film shot on the famous Universal soundstage that had been built in 1924 for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925).

Miklós Rózsa&#x27;s music, for which he won his second Academy Award, mixes his own modern idiom with passages in the Venetian style of the 16th century. Rózsa later adopted the title &quot;Double Life&quot; for his 1982 memoir to signify the division in his career between absolute music and Hollywood film scores.

== Release ==
&quot;A Double Life&quot; premiered on Christmas Day 1947 in Hollywood as a limited roadshow engagement timed to qualify the film and its stars for Academy Award consideration.

==Reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther wrote: &quot;Miss Gordon and Mr. Kanin, in collaboration with William Shakespeare, have whipped up a modern drama which thoroughly employs the screen to demonstrate the strange excitement and the deathless romance of the theatre. And by casting Ronald Colman as their matinee idol of vast renown and by giving him an opportunity to play a lot of &#x27;Othello&#x27; within the play, they have handed this veteran actor the role of his lengthy career. The only question is whether Mr. Colman is more spectacular as the mentally distressed star of Broadway or as the bearded Venetian Moor. In either case, he plays an actor cocked and primed for romantic tragedy.&quot;

Reviewer Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote: &quot;It captures the pulse of the New York theater to an extraordinary degree, inherently as well as because some of it was shot there; it is adult, outspoken and subtle, and it has shaken Mr. Colman free of most of the repressions imposed upon him by years of effete grand seigniory in Hollywood. Yet much of the film is hard to follow, &#x27;too&#x27; subtle in the sense that it does not always come off on the screen as its makers must surely have visualized it.&quot;

==Awards==
The film was nominated by the American Film Institute for its 2005 compilation AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores.

<text>Marcus Dion Camby (born March 22, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player who played 17 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was named Defensive Player of the Year during the 2006–07 NBA season, leading the league in blocked shots per game. Camby is also a four-time member of the NBA All-Defensive Team and is 12th on the NBA&#x27;s all-time career blocks list.

==Early life==
Marcus Dion Camby was born on March 22, 1974, in Hartford, Connecticut. Camby began his high school career at Conard High School in West Hartford, Connecticut. He transferred to Hartford Public High School. In his senior season, Camby averaged 27 points, 11 rebounds, 8 blocks and 8 assists, en route to a 27–0 record and state title. He was named Gatorade&#x27;s Connecticut Player of the Year.

==College career==
Camby played three seasons for the UMass Minutemen. He had an NCAA freshman record 105 total blocks during his first year at UMass, and was named the Atlantic 10&#x27;s Freshman of the Year. Camby was named to the A-10&#x27;s First Team during his sophomore season in 1994–95, as the Minutemen reached the Elite Eight of the NCAA Tournament.

Camby won the John R. Wooden Award and the Naismith College Player of the Year Award during the 1995–96 season. He led UMass to numerous #1 rankings and the 1996 NCAA Final Four. In the NCAA tournament, Camby set a tourney record of 43 total blocked shots in 11 games. On April 29, 1996, Camby announced that he would forgo his senior year at UMass and enter the NBA draft.

In 1997, UMass&#x27; visit to the Final Four was vacated by the NCAA because Camby had been found to have accepted $28,000 from two sports agents. As part of the penalty, the school was forced to return their $151,617 in revenue from the 1996 NCAA Tournament. Camby later reimbursed the school for the amount lost. According to a 1997 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, the agents, John Lounsbury and Wesley Spears of Connecticut, had hoped that Camby would hire them to represent him when he became a professional. The article reported that Camby had also received &quot;jewelry, rental cars and prostitutes&quot; from the agents.

Camby was inducted into the UMass Athletic Hall of Fame on September 10, 2010. Though some criticized the school for inducting a student-athlete who caused their Final Four achievement to be vacated, others saw it as a positive recognition of one of the school&#x27;s best ever athletes.

Camby returned to school, taking online courses from UMass, and earned his degree on May 12, 2017.

==Professional career==
===Toronto Raptors (1996–1998)===
Camby was selected second overall in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft by the Toronto Raptors. In his rookie season, he made the NBA All-Rookie First Team, averaging 14.8 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game. On March 27, 1997, Camby had perhaps his best game as a rookie, scoring 37 points (a remarkable 47% of Toronto&#x27;s points) and grabbing 8 rebounds in a 90–79 loss against the Atlanta Hawks. In the following season, Camby led the league in blocked shots with 3.7 per game. However, Camby&#x27;s disagreements with Butch Carter led Toronto to trade him to the Knicks.

===New York Knicks (1998–2002)===
In 1998, Camby was traded to the New York Knicks in a draft-day deal for longtime Knick Charles Oakley and the draft rights of Sean Marks. Following the trade, Camby stated of Oakley: &quot;No one can replace Oak. He was the heart and soul and team leader. I play different positions. I bring versatility. We&#x27;ll take it one day at a time and focus on winning, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m about.&quot;

For his first two seasons in New York, Camby backed up veteran All-Star center Patrick Ewing. The Knicks struggled to establish on-court chemistry in the lockout-shorted 1998–99 season, finishing with a 27–23 record, which was just good enough to qualify for the 8th and final seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, Camby and teammate (and close friend) Latrell Sprewell began to assert themselves as the Knicks shocked the top-seeded Miami Heat and swept the Atlanta Hawks in the first two rounds, setting up a meeting with the rival Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals. After Ewing went down with a season-ending Achilles injury early in the series, Camby filled the void, averaging double-doubles in the last three games of the series to lead the Knicks to a six-game upset series win over the Pacers and into the NBA Finals. The Knicks became the first 8th-seeded team to make it to the NBA Finals, where they matched up with the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs defeated the Knicks in five games to win the 1999 Championship.

In the 1999–00 season the Knicks with Ewing back at center bounced back and won 50 games thanks to the contributions of many of the veteran players, including the Sixth Man of the Year Award-type season from Camby. In the playoffs, the Knicks defeated the Toronto Raptors in three games and Miami Heat in seven games in the first two rounds of the playoffs en route to making it to the Eastern Conference Finals for the second year in a row. There they faced the top seed in the East, the Indiana Pacers, and were defeated by them in six games.

During a game against the San Antonio Spurs on January 15, 2001, Camby took a roundhouse swing at Spurs&#x27; forward Danny Ferry after he was hit in the eye on a box-out. The punch missed Ferry because Knicks&#x27; head coach Jeff Van Gundy stepped in at the last second, resulting in his being head-butted by Camby. Van Gundy required 15 stitches to close a gash above his left eye. Camby, who ended up with scratches on his face from both incidents, was suspended for five games and fined $25,000. Ferry was suspended for one game and fined $7,500 for the initial foul. Upon returning from the suspension, Camby began to play his best ball of the season in averaging 12 points with 11 rebounds and 2 blocks a game; however, it was not enough as the Knicks were defeated by the Toronto Raptors in five games in the first round of the playoffs. Camby spent most of the 2001–02 season injured, and without him as an inside presence, the Knicks struggled with a 30–52 record and missed the playoffs. Camby, after getting traded to Denver, accused the Knicks training staff of misdiagnosing his injury and causing him to miss more games than he should have. The Nuggets however, sided with the Knicks.

===Denver Nuggets (2002–2008)===

During the 2002 NBA draft, the Knicks traded Camby, Mark Jackson and Nenê to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for Antonio McDyess and Frank Williams.

In the 2003–04 season, along with rookie teammate Carmelo Anthony, Camby helped lead the Nuggets back to the playoffs where they were defeated by the Minnesota Timberwolves.

Camby led the NBA in blocked shots four times - 1997-&#x27;98, &#x27;05-&#x27;06, &#x27;06-&#x27;07, and finally in &#x27;07-&#x27;08. During the 2005–06 season with the Nuggets he had 12.0 rebounds per game, 9.6 defensive rebounds per game and 1.4 steals per game. He also averaged 12.8 points per game and led the league in blocks per game (3.3), while helping Denver earn a playoff berth by winning the Northwest Division.

On December 16, 2006, Camby was involved in the Knicks–Nuggets brawl. He was one of 10 players ejected from the game, but received no suspension.

Camby won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award for the 2006–07 season. The honor was the first of Camby&#x27;s career. He received the actual award from NBA commissioner David Stern on April 28, 2007, during a pregame ceremony at the Nuggets first home 2006–07 playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs. During the 2006–07 season, Camby averaged 3.3 blocks per game (first in the league), 11.7 rebounds per game (fifth in the league), 9.3 defensive rebounds per game (second in the league) and 1.24 steals per game (second among centers).

During the 2007–08 NBA season, Camby continued to make his mark as one of the best defensive players and centers in the game. He finished the season averaging 13.1 rebounds per game (second in the league), 18.1 rebounds per 48 minutes (first in the league), 10.2 defensive rebounds per game (second in the league), 14.1 defensive rebounds per 48 minutes (first in the league), 3.61 blocks per game (first in the league), 4.96 blocks per 48 minutes (first in the league), 285 total blocks (first in the league), 1.06 steals per game (third among centers) and 3.3 assists per game (second among centers). On December 26, 2007, in a Nuggets&#x27; home win against the Milwaukee Bucks, Camby posted a triple-double, with 10 points (which included a three-pointer), 11 rebounds and 10 blocks. The triple-double was Camby&#x27;s third of his career and the first since April 19, 1998, against the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 14, 2008, in a Nuggets&#x27; road loss against the Charlotte Bobcats, Camby had a game of 20 points, 23 rebounds, 6 assists, and 6 blocks. He became only the fourth player since 1990 to have at least 20 points, 20 rebounds, 6 assists, and 6 blocks in one game. On January 17, 2008, in a Nuggets&#x27; home win against the Utah Jazz, Camby became just the third player since blocked shots became an official NBA stat in 1973–74 with at least 24 rebounds and 11 blocks in a game. On January 25, 2008, in a Nuggets home win against the New Jersey Nets, Camby blocked 4 shots—and in the process—recorded his 1,000th blocked shot as a member of the Nuggets. On March 16, 2008, in an historic 168–116 home win in regulation over the Seattle SuperSonics (the 168 points were the most points scored in franchise history – fourth most in NBA history – for a non-overtime game), Camby recorded his second triple-double of the 2007–08 NBA season when he had 13 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists. The triple-double was accomplished in an NBA record-tying 27 minutes.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2008–2010)===
On July 15, 2008, Camby was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers for the option to swap second-round draft picks in the 2010 NBA draft. Camby said that he was unhappy that he was traded from the Nuggets, essentially being made the scapegoat for their lack of post-season success. 
&quot;I thought I had done everything possible that I could do with that team, and just tried to go about things the right way. I just thought the way they went about it was classless; they didn&#x27;t let me know anything. That&#x27;s a thing of the past right now, that&#x27;s something I put behind me and I&#x27;m looking forward to embarking on this journey.&quot;
In the first part of the 2008–09 NBA season, he started at power forward, with Chris Kaman remaining as the starting center. Then, an injury that occurred to Kaman and the arrival of forward Zach Randolph brought Camby back to the starting center position. On December 17, 2008, Camby pulled down a career-high 27 rebounds in a 115–109 overtime loss against the Chicago Bulls. He also had 19 points, 2 assists, 1 steal, and 4 blocks.

===Portland Trail Blazers (2010–2012)===
On February 16, 2010, Camby was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for Steve Blake, Travis Outlaw, and 1.5 million dollars in cash.

Camby played in 23 games for the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2009–2010 season. With injuries to fellow centers Greg Oden and Joel Przybilla, Camby helped the team secure a playoff berth as the Western Conference&#x27;s sixth seed. On April 12, 2010, in a game in Portland against the Oklahoma City Thunder Camby led the team in scoring with 30 points and grabbed 13 rebounds. On April 20, 2010, he signed a two-year contract extension to stay with the Blazers.

===Houston Rockets (2012)===
Camby was traded at the deadline on March 15, 2012, to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Jonny Flynn, Hasheem Thabeet and a second round draft pick.

===Return to Knicks (2012–2013)===
On July 11, 2012, Camby was traded to the New York Knicks in a sign-and-trade deal that also involved Toney Douglas, Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, and two future draft picks going to the Rockets. He missed most of the 2012–13 season with a strained plantar fascia in his left foot, playing only 24 games.

On July 10, 2013, Camby, Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson, a future first round draft pick, and two future second round draft picks were traded from the Knicks to the team that drafted him 2nd overall in 1996, the Toronto Raptors in exchange for Andrea Bargnani. The Raptors then bought out Camby&#x27;s contract.

On July 29, 2013, Camby re-signed with the Houston Rockets. However, he was waived by the Rockets on October 28, 2013.

==Off the court==
===Charitable===
Camby tutored South Hadley students while at UMass, and was active with charities throughout his career. He was active with several Denver-area charities as a Nugget. As a pro he also toured Africa with Basketball Without Borders.

In 1996, Camby established the Cambyland Foundation, a non-profit organization. Cambyland partners with school and community organizations to provide opportunities for young people.

===Kidnapping incident===
On April 23, 2001, Camby&#x27;s mother and two sisters were taken hostage in their own home by Hartford resident Troy Crooms. Crooms, who was charged with kidnapping, first-degree sexual assault, burglary and possession of a weapon, held them at knife-point over an eight-hour-long stand-off with police. Camby himself was at the scene with police during the stand-off. Crooms eventually pleaded guilty to first-degree sexual assault, second-degree burglary and violating probation. After initially facing 95 years in prison, Crooms was sentenced to 18 years in prison.

<doc id="149795" wikidata="Q3400055" url="?curid=149795" title="International scientific vocabulary">
<text>International scientific vocabulary (ISV) comprises scientific and specialized words whose language of origin may or may not be certain, but which are in current use in several modern languages (that is, translingually, whether in , loanword, or calque forms). 

The name &quot;international scientific vocabulary&quot; was first used by Philip Gove in &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; (1961). As noted by David Crystal, science is an especially productive field for new coinages. It is also especially predisposed to immediate translingual sharing of words owing to its very nature: scientists working in many countries and languages, reading each other&#x27;s latest articles in scientific journals (via foreign language skills, translation help, or both), and eager to apply any reported advances to their own context.

==Instances==
According to &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third&quot;, &quot;some ISV words (like haploid) have been created by taking a word with a rather general and simple meaning from one of the languages of antiquity, usually Latin and Greek, and conferring upon it a very specific and complicated meaning for the purposes of modern scientific discourse.&quot; An ISV word is typically a classical compound or a derivative which &quot;gets only its raw materials, so to speak, from antiquity.&quot; Its morphology may vary across languages.

The online version of Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged (Merriam-Webster, 2002) adds that the ISV &quot;consists of words or other linguistic forms current in two or more languages&quot; that &quot;differ from New Latin in being adapted to the structure of the individual languages in which they appear.&quot; In other words, ISV terms are often made with Greek, Latin, or other combining forms, but each language pronounces the resulting neo-lexemes within its own phonemic &quot;comfort zone&quot;, and makes morphological connections using its normal morphological system. In this respect, ISV can be viewed as heavily borrowing loanwords from Neo-Latin.

McArthur characterizes ISV words and morphemes as &quot;translinguistic&quot;, explaining that they operate &quot;in many languages that serve as mediums for education, culture, science, and technology.&quot; Besides European languages, such as Russian, Swedish, English, and Spanish, ISV lexical items also function in Japanese, Malay, Philippine languages, and other Asian languages. According to McArthur, no other set of words and morphemes is so international. 

It is not always practically relevant, to any concerns except philology and the history of science, which language any particular ISV term first appeared in, as its cognate naturalized counterparts in other languages are effectively with it for most practical scientific purposes, as well as being self-evidently equivalent in . This characteristic is corollary to the very nature of science: it is predisposed to immediate translingual sharing of words, as scientists, working in many countries and languages, are perennially reading each other&#x27;s latest articles in scientific journals (via foreign language skills, translation help, or both), and eager to apply any reported advances to their own context. This theme applies even regardless of whether each instance of scientific exchange is openly collaborative (as in open science) or is driven by espionage or industrial espionage (as for example regarding weapons systems development).

The ISV is one of the concepts behind the development and standardization of the constructed language called Interlingua. Scientific and medical terms in Interlingua are largely of Greco-Latin origin, but, like most Interlingua words, they appear in a wide range of languages. Interlingua&#x27;s vocabulary is established using a group of &quot;control languages&quot; selected as they radiate words into, and absorb words from, a large number of other languages. A &quot;prototyping&quot; technique then selects the most recent common ancestor of each eligible Interlingua word or affix. The word or affix takes a contemporary form based on the control languages. This procedure is meant to give Interlingua the most generally international vocabulary possible.

==Words and word roots that have different meanings from those in the original languages==
This is a list of scientific words and word roots which have different meanings from those in the original languages.

==Words and word roots that have one meaning from Latin and another meaning from Greek==
This is a list of scientific words and word roots which have one meaning from Latin and another meaning from Greek.
==Other words and word roots with two meanings==
This is a list of other scientific words and word roots which have two meanings.
==Other differences==
Another difference between scientific terms and classical Latin and Greek is that many compounded scientific terms do not elide the inflection vowel at the end of a root before another root or prefix that starts with a vowel, e.g. gastroenteritis; but elision happens in gastrectomy (not *&quot;gastroectomy&quot;).

The Greek word () = &quot;monster&quot; is usually used to mean &quot;monster (abnormal)&quot; (e.g. teratology, teratogen), but some biological names use it to mean &quot;monster (enormous)&quot; (e.g. the extinct animals &quot;Teratornis&quot; (a condor with a 12-foot wingspan) and &quot;Terataspis&quot; (a trilobite 2 feet long)).

==Haplology==
A feature affecting clarity in seeing a scientific word&#x27;s components is haplology, i.e. removing one of two identical or similar syllables that meet at the junction point of a compound word. Examples are:
*appendectomy = , , (Latin for &quot;appendix&quot;) + &quot;&quot; (ultimately from Greek , &quot;a cutting&quot;)
*Dracohors = , , &quot;Latin for dragon&quot; + , &quot;cohort&quot;
*Hapalemur = &quot;hapalo-&quot; (Greek , &quot;gentle&quot;) + lemur

<doc id="149798" wikidata="Q367053" url="?curid=149798" title="John Garfield">
<text>John Garfield (born Jacob Julius Garfinkle; March 4, 1913 – May 21, 1952) was an American actor who played brooding, rebellious, working-class characters. He grew up in poverty in New York City. In the early 1930s, he became a member of the Group Theatre. In 1937, he moved to Hollywood, eventually becoming one of Warner Bros.&#x27; stars. He received Academy Award nominations for his performances in &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938) and &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947).

Called to testify before the U.S. Congressional House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he denied communist affiliation and refused to &quot;name names&quot;, effectively ending his film career. Some have alleged that the stress of this persecution led to his premature death at 39 from a heart attack. Garfield is acknowledged as a predecessor of such Method actors as Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, and James Dean.

==Early life==

Jacob Garfinkle () was born in a small apartment on Rivington Street in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, to David and Hannah Garfinkle, Russian Jewish immigrants, and grew up in the heart of the Yiddish Theater District. In early infancy, a middle name—Julius—was added, and for the rest of his life those who knew him well called him Julie. His father, a clothes presser and part-time cantor, struggled to make a living and to provide even marginal comfort for his small family. When Garfield was five, his brother Max was born. Their mother never fully recovered from what was described as a &quot;difficult&quot; pregnancy and birth. She died two years later, and the young boys were sent to live with various relatives, all poor, scattered across the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens and The Bronx. Several of these relatives lived in tenements in a section of East Brooklyn called Brownsville, and there, Garfield lived in one house and slept in another. At school, he was judged a poor reader and speller, deficits that were aggravated by irregular attendance. He would later say of his time on the streets there, that he learned &quot;all the meanness, all the toughness it&#x27;s possible for kids to acquire.&quot;
His father remarried and moved to the West Bronx, where Garfield joined a series of gangs. Much later, he would recall: &quot;Every street had its own gang. That&#x27;s the way it was in poor sections ... the old safety in numbers.&quot; He soon became a gang leader. At this time, people started to notice his ability to mimic well-known performers, both physically and facially. He also began to hang out and eventually spar at a boxing gym on Jerome Avenue. At some point, he contracted scarlet fever (it was diagnosed later in adulthood), causing permanent damage to his heart and causing him to miss a lot of school. After he was expelled three times and expressed a wish to quit school altogether, his father and stepmother sent him to P.S. 45, a school for difficult children. It was under the guidance of the school&#x27;s principal—the educator Angelo Patri—that he was introduced to acting. Noticing Garfield&#x27;s tendency to stammer, Patri assigned him to a speech therapy class taught by a charismatic teacher named Margaret O&#x27;Ryan. She gave him acting exercises and made him memorize and deliver speeches in front of the class and, as he progressed, in front of school assemblies. O&#x27;Ryan thought he had a natural talent and cast him in school plays. She encouraged him to sign up for a citywide debating competition sponsored by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. To his own surprise, he took second prize.

With Patri and O&#x27;Ryan&#x27;s encouragement, he began to take acting lessons at a drama school that was part of The Heckscher Foundation and began to appear in their productions. At one of the latter, he received back-stage congratulations and an offer of support from the Yiddish actor Jacob Ben-Ami, who recommended him to the American Laboratory Theatre. Funded by the Theatre Guild, &quot;the Lab&quot; had contracted with Richard Boleslavski to stage its experimental productions and with Russian actress and expatriate Maria Ouspenskaya to supervise classes in acting. Former members of the Moscow Art Theatre, they were the first proponents of Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s &#x27;system&#x27; in the United States, which soon developed into what came to be known as &quot;the Method&quot;. Garfield took morning classes and began volunteering time at the Lab after hours, auditing rehearsals, building and painting scenery, and doing crew work. He would later view this time as beginning his apprenticeship in the theater. Among the people becoming disenchanted with the Guild and turning to the Lab for a more radical, challenging environment were Stella Adler, Lee Strasberg, Franchot Tone, Cheryl Crawford and Harold Clurman. In varying degrees, all would become influential in Garfield&#x27;s later career.

After a stint with Eva Le Gallienne&#x27;s Civic Repertory Theater and a short period of vagrancy, involving hitchhiking, freight hopping, picking fruit, and logging in the U.S. Northwest, (Preston Sturges conceived the film &quot;Sullivan&#x27;s Travels&quot; after hearing Garfield tell of his hobo adventures), Garfield made his Broadway debut in 1932 in a play called &quot;Lost Boy&quot;. It ran for only two weeks but gave Garfield something critically important for an actor struggling to break into the theater: a credit.

There is a claim that he was a patron of Polly Adler&#x27;s bordello or brothel in New York.

==New York theater and the Group==
Garfield received feature billing in his next role, that of Henry the office boy in Elmer Rice&#x27;s play &quot;Counsellor-at-Law&quot;, starring Paul Muni. The play ran for three months, made an Eastern tour and returned for an unprecedented second, repeat engagement, only closing when Muni was contractually compelled to go back to Hollywood to make a film for Warners. At this point, Warner&#x27;s expressed an interest in Garfield and sought a screen test. He turned them down.

Garfield&#x27;s former colleagues Crawford, Clurman and Strasberg had begun a new theater collective, calling it simply &quot;the Group&quot;, and Garfield lobbied his friends hard to get in. After months of rejection, he began frequenting the inside steps of the Broadhurst Theater where the Group had its offices. Cheryl Crawford noticed him one day and greeted him warmly. Feeling encouraged, he made his request for apprenticeship. Something intangible impressed her, and she recommended him to the other directors. They made no objection.

Clifford Odets had been a close friend of Garfield from the early days in the Bronx. After Odets&#x27; one-act play &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot; became a surprise hit, the Group announced it would mount a production of his full-length drama &quot;Awake and Sing&quot;. At the playwright&#x27;s insistence, Garfield was cast as Ralph, the sensitive young son who pleads for &quot;a chance to get to first base&quot;. The play opened in February 1935, and Garfield was singled out by critic Brooks Atkinson for having a &quot;splendid sense of character development&quot;. Garfield&#x27;s apprenticeship was officially over; he was voted full membership by the company. Odets was the man of the moment, and he claimed to the press that Garfield was his &quot;find&quot; and that he would soon write a play just for him. That play would turn out to be &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, but when Luther Adler was cast in the lead role instead, a disillusioned Garfield began to take a second look at the overtures being made by Hollywood.

==Warner Bros.==
Garfield had been approached by Hollywood studios before—both Paramount and Warners offering screen tests—but talks had always stalled over a clause he wanted inserted in his contract, one that would allow him time off for stage work. Now Warner Bros. acceded to his demand, and Garfield signed a standard feature-player agreement—seven years with options—in Warner&#x27;s New York office. Many in the Group were livid over what they considered his betrayal. Elia Kazan&#x27;s reaction was different, suggesting that the Group did not so much fear that Garfield would fail, but that he would succeed. Jack Warner&#x27;s first order of business was a change of name to John Garfield.
After many false starts, he was finally cast in a supporting, yet crucial role as a tragic young composer in a Michael Curtiz film titled &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938). After the picture&#x27;s release, he received very positive notices and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The studio quickly revised Garfield&#x27;s contract—designating him a star player rather than a featured one—for seven years without options. They also created a name-above-the-title vehicle for him titled &quot;They Made Me a Criminal&quot; (1939). Before the success of &quot;Daughters&quot;, Garfield had made a B movie feature called &quot;Blackwell&#x27;s Island&quot; (also 1939). Not wanting their new star to appear in a low-budget film, Warners ordered an A movie upgrade by adding $100,000 to its budget and recalling director Michael Curtiz to shoot newly scripted scenes.

Garfield&#x27;s debut had a cinematic impact difficult to conceive in retrospect. As biographer Lawrence Swindell put it: 

His &quot;honeymoon&quot; with Warners over, Garfield entered a protracted period of conflict with the studio, with Warners attempting to cast him in crowd-pleasing melodramas like &quot;Dust Be My Destiny&quot; (also 1939) and Garfield insisting on quality scripts that would offer challenges and highlight his versatility. The result was often a series of suspensions, with Garfield refusing an assigned role and Warners refusing to pay him. Garfield&#x27;s problem was shared by any actor working in the studio system of the 1930s: by contract, the studio had the right to cast him in any project they wanted to. But, as Robert Nott explains: 
A notable exception to this trend was &quot;Daughters Courageous&quot; (also 1939), a not-quite-sequel (same cast, different story and characters) to his debut film. The film did well critically, but failed to find an audience, the public being dissatisfied that it was not a true sequel (hard to pull off, since the original character Mickey Borden died in the first picture). The director, Curtiz, called the film &quot;my obscure masterpiece&quot;.

At the onset of World War II, Garfield immediately attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down because of his heart condition. Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort. He and actress Bette Davis were the driving forces behind the opening of the Hollywood Canteen, a club offering food and entertainment for American servicemen. He traveled overseas to help entertain the troops, made several bond selling tours and starred in a string of patriotic box-office successes like &quot;Air Force&quot;, &quot;Destination Tokyo&quot; (both 1943) and &quot;Pride of the Marines&quot; (1945). He was particularly proud of the last film, based on the life of Al Schmid, a war hero blinded in combat. In preparing for the role, Garfield lived for several weeks with Schmid and his wife in Philadelphia and would blindfold himself for hours at a time.

After the war, Garfield starred in a series of successful films such as &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1946) with Lana Turner, &quot;Humoresque&quot; (also 1946) with Joan Crawford, and &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), an Oscar-winning Best Picture. In &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, Garfield took a featured, but supporting, part because he believed deeply in the film&#x27;s exposé of antisemitism in America. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his starring role in &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947). That same year, Garfield returned to Broadway in the play &quot;Skipper Next to God&quot;. Strong-willed and often verbally combative, Garfield did not hesitate to venture out on his own when the opportunity arose. In 1946, when his contract with Warner Bros. expired, Garfield decided not to renew it and opted to start his own independent production company.

In 1949, he would again star in a Clifford Odets play, &quot;The Big Knife&quot;.

==The Red Scare==

Long involved in liberal politics, Garfield was caught up in the communist scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s. He supported the Committee for the First Amendment, which opposed governmental investigation of communist activity in Hollywood. When called to testify in 1951 before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which was empowered to investigate communist infiltration in America, Garfield refused to name Communist Party members or followers, testifying that, indeed, he knew none in the film industry. Garfield rejected communism and, just prior to his death in hopes of redeeming himself in the eyes of the blacklisters, wrote that he had been duped by communist ideology in an unpublished article called &quot;I Was a Sucker for a Left Hook&quot;, a reference to Garfield&#x27;s movies about boxing. However, his forced testimony before the committee had severely damaged his reputation. He was blacklisted in &quot;Red Channels&quot; and barred from future employment as an actor by Hollywood movie studio bosses for the remainder of his career.

With film work scarce because of the blacklist, Garfield returned to Broadway and starred in a 1952 revival of &quot;Golden Boy&quot;, finally being cast in the lead role denied him years before.

Near the end of his life, in an effort to clear his name, Garfield began work on an article for &quot;Look&quot; magazine, in which he would denounce communism without &quot;naming names&quot;; his lawyer advised him to concede that he had been “duped&quot; into contributing time and money to communist front groups. He then arranged to meet with the FBI to press his case. At the meeting, however, the FBI representatives showed him a dossier on his wife Robbe, which included her old Communist Party membership card and cancelled checks to events sponsored by the party, and said that the FBI would clear him if he signed a statement betraying Robbe as a Communist. Garfield instead responded with an angry expletive and walked out of the meeting.

==Death==

On May 9, 1952, Garfield moved out of his New York apartment for the last time, indicating to friends that the separation from his wife Roberta was not temporary. He confided to columnist Earl Wilson that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife&#x27;s opposition to his planned confession in &quot;Look&quot; magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that 20th Century-Fox wanted him for a film called &quot;Taxi&quot; but would not even begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, Canada Lee, Mady Christians and J. Edward Bromberg, had all recently died after being listed by the committee.

On the morning of May 20, Garfield, against his doctor&#x27;s strict orders, played several strenuous sets of tennis with a friend, mentioning the fact that he had not been to bed the night before. He met actress Iris Whitney for dinner and afterward became ill, complaining that he felt chilled. She took him to her apartment, where he refused to let her call a doctor and instead went to bed. The next morning, she found him dead. Long-term heart problems, allegedly aggravated by the stress of his blacklisting, had led to his death at the age of 39.

The funeral was the largest in New York since Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s, with over ten thousand people crowding the streets outside. The media circus surrounding Garfield&#x27;s death led to a running joke, &quot;John Garfield Still Dead Syndrome&quot;, that parodied the phenomenon; it would later inspire &quot;Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead&quot; in the 1970s after Francisco Franco&#x27;s protracted terminal illness. Garfield&#x27;s estate, valued at &quot;more than $100,000&quot;, was left entirely to his wife. Shortly afterward, the HUAC closed its investigation of John Garfield, leaving him in the clear. Garfield was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, Westchester County, New York.

==Personal life==
He and Roberta Seidman married in February 1935. His wife had been a member of the Communist Party. They had three children: Katherine (1938 – March 18, 1945), who died of an allergic reaction; David (1943–1994); and Julie (born 1946), the latter two later becoming actors themselves. 

His widow Roberta married motion picture and labor lawyer Sidney Cohn in 1954, who died in 1991; Roberta died in a Los Angeles nursing home in 2004. At the time of her death, Julie Garfield told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that her mother was embittered over Garfield&#x27;s treatment by studio executives, who she believed, &quot;had used Garfield as a scapegoat to take attention from others in Hollywood because he had &#x27;formed his own production company and they felt threatened by him.

In &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), Detective Kinderman says Father Damien Karras &quot;looks like a boxer&quot;, and more specifically John Garfield as he appeared in &quot;Body and Soul&quot;.

The protagonist in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, Larry &quot;Doc&quot; Sportello, discusses Garfield&#x27;s film appearances throughout the detective story.

The John Prine song &quot;The Late John Garfield Blues&quot; is inspired by Garfield. The actor is also mentioned by Prine in &quot;Picture Show&quot;, a song in the musician&#x27;s Grammy Award-winning album &quot;The Missing Years&quot;.

In the film &quot;Hustle&quot; (1975), Burt Reynolds&#x27; character references Garfield during a discussion of screen heroes.

In the film &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; (1993), when discussing the contract for one night with his wife, there is a &quot;John Garfield&quot; clause in the contract stating he pays even if he dies during the event.

Garfield is a character in &quot;Names&quot;, Mark Kemble&#x27;s play about former Group Theatre members&#x27; struggles with the House Un-American Activities Committee.

<text>Sir Michael Scudamore Redgrave (20 March 1908 – 21 March 1985) was an English actor and filmmaker. Beginning his career in theatre, he first appeared in the West End in 1937. He made his film debut in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; in 1938.

Redgrave received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1947), as well as two BAFTA nominations for Best British Actor for his performances in &quot;The Night My Number Came Up&quot; (1955) and &quot;Time Without Pity&quot; (1957).

At the 4th Cannes Film Festival, he won Best Actor for his performance in &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1951).

==Youth and education==
Redgrave was born in Bristol, England, the son of actress Margaret Scudamore and the silent film actor Roy Redgrave. Roy left when Redgrave was six months old to pursue a career in Australia. He died when Redgrave was 14. His mother subsequently married Captain James Anderson, a tea planter. Redgrave greatly disliked his stepfather.

Redgrave attended Clifton College in Bristol. Clifton College Theatre was opened in 1966 by Redgrave as the first purpose-built school theatre in the country. After his death, the building was renamed The Redgrave Theatre in his honour.

Upon leaving Clifton, Redgrave went on to study the modern languages and English triposes at Magdalene College, Cambridge. Under the direction of Dadie Rylands, he garnered great acclaim for his starring roles on the Cambridge stage as Edgar, Prince Hal and Captain Brassbound. Alongside the art historian Anthony Blunt and schoolfriend Robin Fedden, Redgrave also edited an &quot;avant-garde&quot; literary magazine called &quot;The Venture&quot;, which published work by Louis MacNeice, Julian Bell and John Lehmann. He graduated with a third-class degree in 1931.

Redgrave taught modern languages at Cranleigh School in Surrey for three years before becoming an actor in 1934. He directed the boys in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;, but played all the leading roles himself.

==Theatre career==
Redgrave made his first professional appearance at the Playhouse in Liverpool on 30 August 1934 as Roy Darwin in &quot;Counsellor-at-Law&quot; (by Elmer Rice), then spent two years with its Liverpool Repertory Company where he met his future wife Rachel Kempson. They married on 18 July 1935.

===1930s===
Offered a job by Tyrone Guthrie, Redgrave made his professional debut in London at the Old Vic on 14 September 1936, playing Ferdinand in &quot;Love&#x27;s Labours Lost&quot;. During 1936–37 he also played Mr Horner in &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;, Warbeck in &quot;The Witch of Edmonton&quot; and Laertes to Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Hamlet. His hit of the season was Orlando. Edith Evans was his Rosalind and the two fell very much in love. As he later explained: &quot;Edith always had a habit of falling in love with her leading men; with us it just went rather further.&quot; &quot;As You Like It&quot; transferred to the West End&#x27;s New Theatre in February 1937 and Redgrave again played Orlando.

At the Embassy Theatre in March 1937, he played Anderson in a mystery play, &quot;The Bat&quot;, before returning to the Old Vic in April, succeeding Marius Goring as Chorus in &quot;Henry V&quot;. Other roles that year included Christopher Drew in Daisy Fisher&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Ship Comes Home&quot; at the St Martin&#x27;s Theatre in May and Larry Starr in Philip Leaver&#x27;s comedy &quot;Three Set Out&quot; at the Embassy in June, before joining John Gielgud&#x27;s Company at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, September 1937 to April 1938, where he played Bolingbroke in &quot;Richard II&quot;, Charles Surface in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; and Baron Tusenbach in &quot;Three Sisters&quot;.

Other roles included:
* Alexei Turbin in &quot;The White Guard&quot; (&quot;The Days of the Turbins&quot; by Mikhail Bulgakov), Phoenix Theatre October 1938
* Sir Andrew Aguecheek in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, Phoenix December 1938
* Harry, Lord Monchesney in &quot;The Family Reunion&quot; (T.S. Eliot), Westminster Theatre March 1939

Once the London theatres were re-opened, after the outbreak of war, he played:

* Charleston in &quot;Thunder Rock&quot;, by Robert Ardrey, Neighbourhood Theatre June 1940; Globe Theatre July 1940. (He would reprise this role in the 1942 Boulting Brothers film version.)

Redgrave joined the Royal Navy as an ordinary seaman in July 1941, () but was discharged on medical grounds in November 1942. Having spent most of 1942 in the Reserve he managed to direct &quot;Lifeline&quot; (Norman Armstrong) starring Frank Pettingell at the Duchess Theatre in July; and &quot;The Duke in Darkness&quot; (Patrick Hamilton) starring Leslie Banks at the St James&#x27;s Theatre in October, also taking the role of Gribaud.

* Marlow in &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;
* Rakitin in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;
* His first Hamlet, which he also played at the Zürich Festival, the Holland Festival and at Kronborg Castle in Elsinore, June 1950

===1950s===
Redgrave joined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre company at Stratford-upon-Avon and for the 1951 season appeared as Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; as well as playing Richard II, Hotspur and Chorus in the Cycle of &quot;Histories&quot;, for which he also directed &quot;Henry IV Part Two&quot;. After appearing as Frank Elgin in &quot;Winter Journey&quot; at the St James&#x27;s April 1952, he rejoined the Stratford company in 1953 (together with his actress wife Rachel Kempson) appearing as Shylock, King Lear and Antony in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, also playing Antony when the company transferred to the Prince&#x27;s Theatre in November 1953 before touring in the Netherlands, Belgium and Paris, in 1958 he played Hamlet with Googie Withers appearing as his mother at Stratford on Avon.

At the Apollo in June 1955 he played Hector in &quot;Tiger at the Gates&quot;, appearing in the same role at the Plymouth Theatre, New York City in October 1955 for which he received the New York Critics&#x27; Award. While in New York he directed &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre in April 1956, and directed and played the Prince Regent in &quot;The Sleeping Prince&quot; with Barbara Bel Geddes at the Coronet Theatre in November 1956.

Returning to London in January 1958, Redgrave appeared as Philip Lester in &quot;A Touch of the Sun&quot; (N. C. Hunter) at the Saville Theatre. He won Best Actor in the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Awards 1958 for this role. He rejoined the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre Company in June 1958, to play Hamlet and Benedick, also playing Hamlet with the company in Leningrad and Moscow in December 1958. (His wife Rachel Kempson played Ursula in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; and Lady Capulet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;).

At the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, in London in August 1959, he played H.J. in his own adaptation of the Henry James novella &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot;. His play was later successfully revived on Broadway in 1962, with Dame Wendy Hiller and Maurice Evans. The 1984 London revival featured his daughter, Vanessa Redgrave, along with Christopher Reeve and Hiller, this time in the role of Miss Bordereau.

===1960s===
Roles included:
* Jack Dean in &quot;The Tiger and the Horse&quot; by Robert Bolt (which Redgrave also co-presented, directed by Frith Banbury), Queen&#x27;s Theatre, August 1960
* Victor Rhodes in &quot;The Complaisant Lover&quot; by Graham Greene, Ethel Barrymore Theatre, New York, November 1961 – 101 performances

Returning to the UK, in July 1962 he took part in the Chichester Festival Theatre&#x27;s opening season, playing the title role in Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; to the Astrov of Laurence Olivier who also directed.

Alongside John Dexter&#x27;s Chichester staging of &quot;Saint Joan&quot;, Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; was first revived in Chichester in 1963 before transferring to the Old Vic as part of the nascent Royal National Theatre&#x27;s inaugural season, winning rave reviews and Redgrave&#x27;s second win as Best Actor in the 1963 Evening Standard Awards. Critic Michael Billington recalled: &quot;In Redgrave&#x27;s Vanya you saw both a tremulous victim of a lifetime&#x27;s emotional repression and the wasted potential of a Chekhovian might-have-been: as Redgrave and Olivier took their joint curtain call, linked hands held triumphantly aloft, we were not to know that this was to symbolise the end of their artistic amity.&quot;

Redgrave played (and co-presented) Lancelot Dodd MA in Arthur Watkyn&#x27;s &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in November 1962, following it at the Old Vic with his portrayal of Claudius opposite the Hamlet of Peter O&#x27;Toole on 22 October 1963. This &quot;Hamlet&quot; was in fact the National Theatre&#x27;s official opening production, directed by Olivier, but Simon Callow has dubbed it &quot;slow, solemn, long&quot;, while Ken Campbell vividly described it as &quot;brochure theatre.&quot;

In January 1964 at the National he played the title role in &quot;Hobson&#x27;s Choice&quot;, which he admitted was well outside his range: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t do the Lancashire accent and that shook my nerve terribly – all the other performances suffered.&quot; While still at the National in June 1964 he also played Halvard Solness in &quot;The Master Builder&quot;, which he said &#x27;went wrong&#x27;. At this time he had incipient Parkinson&#x27;s disease, although he did not know it.

In May and June 1965 Redgrave directed the opening festival of the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre in Guildford, including directing and playing Rakitin in &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; (co-starring with Ingrid Bergman as Natalya Petrovna), and Samson in &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; (co-starring with Rachel Kempson as Chorus). He again played Rakitin in September 1965, when his production transferred to the Cambridge Theatre in London. For the Glyndebourne Festival Opera he directed &quot;Werther&quot; in 1966 and &quot;La bohème&quot; in 1967.

===1970s===
At the Mermaid Theatre in July 1971 he played Mr Jaraby in &quot;The Old Boys&quot; (William Trevor) and had an unfortunate experience: &quot;My memory went, and on the first night they made me wear a deaf aid to hear some lines from the prompter and it literally fell to pieces – there were little bits of machinery all over the floor, so I then knew I really couldn&#x27;t go on, at least not learning new plays.&quot;

Nevertheless, he successfully took over the part of Father in John Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket, also touring Canada and Australia in the role in 1972–73.

In 1973, he played a supporting role in David Winters&#x27; musical television film adaptation of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas.

He returned to the international touring of &quot;A Voyage Round My Father&quot; in 1974–75 with a Royal Shakespeare Company production of &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot;, visiting major venues in the US, New Zealand and Australia, while in 1976–77 he toured South America, Canada, the UK and the United States in the anthology, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s People&quot;.

Redgrave&#x27;s final theatre appearance came in May 1979 when he portrayed Jasper in Simon Gray&#x27;s &quot;Close of Play&quot;, directed on the Lyttelton stage at the National Theatre by Harold Pinter. It was a silent, seated role, based on Gray&#x27;s own father, who had died a year before he wrote the play. As Gray has said: &quot;Jasper is in fact dead but is forced to endure, as if alive, a traditional English Sunday, helpless in his favourite armchair as his three sons and their wives fall to pieces in the usual English middle class style, sometimes blaming him, sometimes appealing to him for help and sobbing at his feet for forgiveness, but basically ignoring him. In other words I had stuck him in Hell, which turns out to be &#x27;life, old life itself&#x27;.&quot;

His final work, in 1975, a narrative of the epic poem, &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a poem that Redgrave taught as a young schoolmaster and visualised by producer-director Raul da Silva, received six international film festival prizes of which five were first place in category. This work was to be his last before the onslaught of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Film and television work==

Redgrave first appeared on BBC television at the Alexandra Palace in 1937, in scenes from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. His first major film role was in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot; (1938), which included a scene where he hummed the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot; in what was the first appearance of the tune in film. Ted Black put him under contract at Gainsborough.

Redgrave also starred in &quot;The Stars Look Down&quot; (1940), with James Mason in the film of Robert Ardrey&#x27;s play &quot;Thunder Rock&quot; (1942), and in the ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy episode of the Ealing compendium film &quot;Dead of Night&quot; (1945).

His first American film role was opposite Rosalind Russell in &quot;Mourning Becomes Electra&quot; (1947), for which he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor. In 1951 he starred in &quot;The Browning Version&quot;, from Sir Terrence Rattigan&#x27;s play of the same name. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; described Redgrave&#x27;s performance as Crocker-Harris as &quot;one of the greatest performances ever seen in films&quot;. The 1950s also saw Redgrave in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952), &quot;The Dambusters&quot; (1954) with his portrayal of the inventor Barnes Wallis, &quot;1984&quot; (1956), &quot;Time Without Pity&quot; (1957), for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award, and &quot;The Quiet American&quot; (1958).

Notable television performances include narration for &quot;The Great War&quot; (1964), a history of World War I using stills and &#x27;stretched&#x27; archive film, and the less successful &quot;Lost Peace&quot; series (BBC Television, 1964 and 1966). Of the latter, Philip Purser wrote: &quot;The commentary, spoken by Sir Michael Redgrave, took on an unremittingly pessimistic tone from the outset.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Family===

Redgrave was married to the actress Rachel Kempson for 50 years from 1935 until his death. Their children Vanessa (b. 1937), Corin (1939–2010) and Lynn Redgrave (1943–2010), and their grandchildren: Natasha Richardson (1963–2009), Joely Richardson (b. 1965) and Jemma Redgrave (b. 1965) are also involved in theatre or film as actors. Their grandson Carlo Gabriel Nero is a screenwriter and film director; only Luke Redgrave has taken a path outside the theatre.

His daughter Lynn wrote a one-woman play for herself called &quot;Shakespeare for My Father&quot;. She was nominated for Broadway&#x27;s Tony Award for this role. She traced her love for Shakespeare as a way of following and finding her often absent father.

Redgrave owned White Roding Windmill from 1937 to 1946. He and his family lived in Bedford House on Chiswick Mall from 1945 to 1954. His entry for &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in the Theatre&quot; (1981) gives his address as Wilks Water, Odiham, Hampshire.

===Bisexuality===
Corin helped his father in the writing of his last autobiography. During one of Corin&#x27;s visits to his father, the latter said, &quot;There is something I ought to tell you&quot;. Then, after a long pause, &quot;I am, to say the least of it, bisexual&quot;. Corin encouraged him to acknowledge his bisexuality in the book. Redgrave agreed to do so, but in the end he chose to remain silent about it. Alan Strachan&#x27;s 2004 biography of Redgrave discusses his affairs with both men and women. Although Redgrave had some long-term relationships with men, he also was prone to cruising Victoria or Knightsbridge for what he called &quot;a necessary degradation&quot;, a habit of quick pick-ups that left him with a lasting sense of self-disgust.

The 1996 BBC documentary film &quot;Michael Redgrave: My Father&quot;, narrated by Corin Redgrave, and based on his book of the same name, discusses his father&#x27;s bisexuality in some depth. Rachel Kempson recounted that when she proposed to him, Redgrave said that there were &quot;difficulties to do with his nature, and that he felt he ought not to marry&quot;. She said that she understood, it did not matter and that she loved him. To this, Redgrave replied, &quot;Very well. If you&#x27;re sure, we will&quot;.

During the filming of Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Secret Beyond the Door&quot; (1947), Redgrave met Bob Mitchell, and they soon became lovers. Mitchell set up house close to the Redgraves, and he became a surrogate &quot;uncle&quot; to Redgrave&#x27;s children (then aged 11, 9 and 5), who adored him. Mitchell later had children of his own, including a son he named Michael. Fred Sadoff was an actor/director who became Redgrave&#x27;s assistant and lover; they shared lodgings in New York and London.

A card was found among Redgrave&#x27;s effects after his death. The card was signed &quot;Tommy, Liverpool, January 1940&quot;, and on it were the words (quoted from W.H. Auden): &quot;The word is love. Surely one fearless kiss would cure the million fevers&quot;.

===Illness and death===
In 1976, after suffering symptoms for many years, Redgrave was diagnosed with rapidly advancing Parkinson&#x27;s disease. He began a regimen of therapies and medications that caused disorientation and other side effects. Costs for his healthcare expenses and his diminished earning power caused the family to apply for public assistance from the King George&#x27;s Pension Fund. In an interview on his 70th birthday, he said: &quot;For a long time, nobody understood the Parkinson&#x27;s condition, and directors thought I was just forgetful or drunk – and even now the work isn&#x27;t easy. The difficulty is not just remembering lines but getting from place to place.&quot;

Redgrave died in a nursing home in Denham, Buckinghamshire, on 21 March 1985, from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, the day after his 77th birthday. He was cremated at Mortlake Crematorium and his ashes were scattered in the garden of St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden (The Actors&#x27; Church), London.

==Awards==
In 1951 Redgrave received the Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival) for &quot;The Browning Version&quot;. He won Best Actor trophies in 1958 and 1963 Evening Standard Awards and received the Variety Club of Great Britain &#x27;Actor of the Year&#x27; award in the same years.

==Honours==
Redgrave was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by the Queen in 1952 and knighted in 1959. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog by Denmark in 1955.

==Appointments==
Redgrave became the First President of the English Speaking Board in 1953, and President of the Questors Theatre, Ealing in 1958. In 1966, he received an honorary DLitt degree from the University of Bristol.

In 1986, he was inducted posthumously into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Redgrave Theatre==
The Redgrave Theatre in Farnham, Surrey, 1974–1998, was named in his honour.
