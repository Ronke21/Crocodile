<text>West Yorkshire is a metropolitan and ceremonial county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. It borders North Yorkshire to the north and east, South Yorkshire and Derbyshire to the south, Greater Manchester to the south-west, and Lancashire to the west. The city of Leeds is the largest settlement.

The county, established in 1974, has an area of and a population of 2.3 million, making it the fourth-largest ceremonial county by population. Large parts of West Yorkshire are urban; many settlements are part of the West Yorkshire built-up area, which has a population of 1.78 million. The largest settlements are Leeds (516,298), Bradford (366,187), Huddersfield (162,949), and Wakefield (109,766). The west of the county is more rural. The county is governed by five metropolitan boroughs: City of Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, City of Leeds and City of Wakefield, which collaborate through West Yorkshire Combined Authority.

The western part of West Yorkshire is in the South Pennines, and contains a small part of the Peak District National Park. It is characterised by steep valleys and is the source of the River Calder, which flows past Wakefield before meeting the Aire, which flows through Leeds, near Castleford. The landscape becomes flatter in the east, and the county boundary is on the edge of the Vale of York.

Remnants of strong coal, wool and iron ore industries remain in the county, having attracted people over the centuries, and this can be seen in the buildings and architecture. Several railways and the M1, M621, M606, A1(M) and M62 motorways traverse the county.

==Governance==

West Yorkshire County Council was abolished in 1986 and its five districts effectively became unitary authorities. The metropolitan county, covering an area of , continues to exist in law and as a geographic frame of reference.

Since 1 April 2014, West Yorkshire has been a combined authority area, with the local authorities pooling some functions over transport and regeneration as the West Yorkshire Combined Authority. The first Mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, was elected on 6 May 2021, following a devolution deal announced by the government in the March 2020 budget.

The conurbation of Bradford, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds and Wakefield makes up the West Yorkshire Built-up Area, which is the fourth-largest in the United Kingdom and the largest within the historic county boundaries of Yorkshire.

In Parliament, 13 out of 22 of West Yorkshire&#x27;s MPs are Labour and 9 are Conservative. At local level, the councils are generally divided, apart from the Wakefield district, which has long been one of the safest Labour councils in the country.

Some services are provided across the county by West Yorkshire Joint Services and the West Yorkshire Police and West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service are also county-wide.

==Geography==
The county borders, going anticlockwise from the west: Lancashire, Greater Manchester, Derbyshire, South Yorkshire and North Yorkshire. The terrain of the county mostly consists of the Pennines and its foothills which dominate the west of the county and gradually descend into the Vale of York and Humberhead Levels in the east. Geologically, it lies almost entirely on rocks of carboniferous age which form the inner Southern Pennine fringes in the west and the Yorkshire coalfield further eastwards. In the extreme east of the metropolitan county there are younger deposits of Magnesian Limestone. Areas in the west such as Bradford and Calderdale are dominated by the scenery of the eastern slopes of the South Pennines, dropping from upland in the west down to the east, and dissected by many steep-sided valleys while a small part of the northern Peak District extends into the south west of Kirklees. Large-scale industry, housing, public and commercial buildings of differing heights, transport routes and open countryside conjoin. The dense network of roads, canals and railways and urban development, confined by valleys creates dramatic interplay of views between settlements and the surrounding hillsides, as shaped the first urban-rural juxtapositions of David Hockney. Where most rural the land crops up in the such rhymes and folklore as On Ilkla Moor Baht &#x27;at, date unknown, the early 19th century novels and poems of the Brontë family often in and around Haworth and long-running light comedy-drama &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; in the 20th century.

The carboniferous rocks of the Yorkshire coalfield further east have produced a rolling landscape with hills, escarpments and broad valleys in the outer fringes of the Pennines. In this landscape there is widespread evidence of both current and former industrial activity. There are numerous derelict or converted mine buildings and recently landscaped former spoil heaps. The scenery is a mixture of built up areas, industrial land with some dereliction, and farmed open country. Ribbon developments along transport routes including canal, road and rail are prominent features of the area although some remnants of the pre industrial landscape and semi-natural vegetation still survive. However, many areas are affected by urban fringe pressures creating fragmented and downgraded landscapes and ever present are urban influences from major cities, smaller industrial towns and former mining villages. In the Magnesian Limestone belt to the east of the Leeds and Wakefield areas is an elevated ridge with smoothly rolling scenery, dissected by dry valleys. Here, there is a large number of country houses and estates with parkland, estate woodlands, plantations and game coverts. The rivers Aire and Calder drain the area, flowing from west to east.

==History==

Wakefield&#x27;s Parish Church was raised to cathedral status in 1888 and after the elevation of Wakefield to diocese, Wakefield Council immediately sought city status and this was granted in July 1888. However the Industrial Revolution, which changed West and South Yorkshire significantly, led to the growth of Leeds and Bradford, which became the area&#x27;s two largest cities (Leeds being the largest in Yorkshire). Leeds was granted city status in 1893 and Bradford in 1897. The name of Leeds Town Hall reflects the fact that at its opening in 1858 Leeds was not yet a city, while Bradford renamed its Town Hall as City Hall in 1965.

West Yorkshire was formed as a metropolitan county in 1974, by the Local Government Act 1972, and corresponds roughly to the core of the historic West Riding of Yorkshire and the county boroughs of Bradford, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Leeds, and Wakefield.

West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council inherited the use of West Riding County Hall at Wakefield, opened in 1898, from the West Riding County Council in 1974. Since 1987 it has been the headquarters of Wakefield City Council.

The county initially had a two-tier structure of local government with a strategic-level county council and five districts providing most services. In 1986, throughout England the metropolitan county councils were abolished. The functions of the county council were devolved to the boroughs; joint-boards covering fire, police and public transport; and to other special joint arrangements. Organisations such as the West Yorkshire Police (governed by the West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner) continue to operate on this basis.

Although the county council was abolished, West Yorkshire continues to form a metropolitan and ceremonial county with a Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire and a High Sheriff.

===Green belt===

West Yorkshire contains green belt interspersed throughout the county, surrounding the West Yorkshire Urban Area. It was first drawn up in the 1950s. All the county&#x27;s districts contain large portions of green belt.

===Parish===
West Yorkshire has close ties with Lancashire in terms of history, local identity and infrastructure including with the War of the Roses and Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Up until the 19th century, the town of Todmorden was in Lancashire but was moved into Yorkshire. In the 1974 boundary review, the towns of Earby and Barnoldswick were moved into the Pendle district of Lancashire. The civil parish of Saddleworth in Oldham was the only part of West Riding of Yorkshire to be moved into the county of Greater Manchester. The villages in the parish border the towns of Huddersfield and Holmfirth. There is a strong identity debate with Saddleworth residents who still maintain close connections with Yorkshire including the Saddleworth White Rose Society.

===Local legislation===

The (c. xiv) was passed to amend existing local acts of Parliament in the West Yorkshire area, and to confer specific powers on West Yorkshire County Council, as well as the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council, Calderdale Metropolitan Borough Council, Kirklees Council, Leeds City Council and Wakefield Council.

==Demography==


West Yorkshire is ethnically diverse, hosting large populations of multiple ethnic minority groups. Most notably, the city of Bradford is well known for its large concentration of British Pakistanis, the highest by percentage in the country. Leeds and Kirklees also have large British Pakistani populations. Kirklees also hosts a large population of British Indians. West Yorkshire is home to a large Eastern European population, particularly British Poles. Ethnic minorities totalled to over 21% of West Yorkshire&#x27;s population in 2011.


==Economy==
===Industries===
Leeds has since attracted investment from financial institutions, to become a recognised financial centre, with many banks, building societies and insurance companies having offices in the city. Wakefield has also attracted many service-based industries, in particular call centres. Two of the big four supermarkets are from West Yorkshire. Morrisons is based in Bradford, while Asda is based in Leeds.

West Yorkshire grew up around several industries. Wakefield, Castleford, Pontefract and South and East Leeds were traditional coal mining areas.

;Wool
Bradford, Halifax and Huddersfield grew through the development of woollen mills. Leeds&#x27; traditional industry was the manufacturing of cloth while heavier engineering industries facilitated growth in South Leeds.

The Heavy Woollen District covered towns such as Dewsbury, Batley, Morley, Ossett, Cleckheaton and Heckmondwike. The woollen and cloth industries declined throughout the twentieth century.

;Rhubarb
The Rhubarb Triangle is wholly in West Yorkshire and still produces the vegetable in considerable quantities. Twelve farmers who farm within the Rhubarb Triangle applied to have the name &quot;Yorkshire forced rhubarb&quot; added to the list of foods and drinks that have their names legally protected by the European Commission&#x27;s Protected Food Name scheme. The application was successful and the farmers in the Rhubarb Triangle were awarded Protected Designation of Origin status (PDO) in February 2010. Food protected status accesses European funding to promote the product and legal backing against other products made outside the area using the name. Other protected names include Stilton cheese, Champagne and Parma Ham.

;Coal
The last pit in West Yorkshire to close was Hay Royds Colliery at Denby Dale in 2012 after a flood.

===Film and television productions===

Several films and television series have been filmed in West Yorkshire&#x27;s historic areas, particularly around the town of Halifax. For example, portions of the BBC television series &quot;Happy Valley&quot; were filmed in Huddersfield; in addition to exteriors, some of the studio filming was done at North Light Film Studios at Brookes Mill, Huddersfield. As well, interiors for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Jamaica Inn&quot;, for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Remember Me&quot; and for ITV series &quot;Black Work&quot;, were also filmed at the studios. More recently, many of the exteriors of the BBC series &quot;Jericho&quot; were filmed at the nearby Rockingstone Quarry and some interior work was done at North Light Film Studios.

===Tourism===
Urban tourism varies. National interest features include sporting stadia, museums, theatre and galleries. Royal Armouries is in Leeds, as is the Leeds Playhouse (formerly the West Yorkshire Playhouse), Opera North and The Grand Theatre. The First Direct Arena in Leeds seats around 15,000 people. Sheffield Arena is also popular, as is the Bradford Alhambra, St Georges Hall and the Media and Science Museum in Bradford. Leeds is the most popular shopping destination in West Yorkshire, probably Yorkshire and rivals Manchester having claim to Briggate, the Headrow, Trinity Leeds, Victoria Gate, the Victoria and Northern Quarters, the biggest indoor market in Europe and the White Rose Centre, as well as many &#x27;first outside of London&#x27; labels such as Harvey Nichols and Victoria&#x27;s Secret. Leeds is also a popular nightlife destination domestically, which is not surprising given its accessibility and central location. All cities are well connected via rail and road, Leeds railway station is an important hub seeing 29.7 million passengers 2015–16, making it the fourth busiest station in the UK after London stations, Birmingham New Street and Glasgow Central. It is the busiest in Northern England.

Signposted walks follow rivers and the escarpment of the Pennines, which is scaled in meandering stages and tunnels by the recreational Leeds-Liverpool Canal and Rochdale Canal, navigable by barge, canoe or kayak. Other tourism features include abbeys, castles, countryside walks, landscapes, picturesque villages, architecture, stately homes, tea rooms, real ale breweries, farmer&#x27;s markets, restaurants and hiking in villages including Hebden Bridge, Ilkley with its scenic riversides, cherry blossoms and suspension bridge and equally in Wharfedale, Otley.

==Transport==
West Yorkshire lies in arguably the most strategic part of Yorkshire: the M62, M1 and the A1(M) pass through the county, as well as the internal urban motorways in Leeds and Bradford. West Yorkshire has two mainline railway stations, Leeds and Wakefield Westgate. Leeds railway station is the only Network Rail principal station in Yorkshire and North East England, and one of only three in the North of England along with Manchester Piccadilly and Liverpool Lime Street. Other important railway stations in West Yorkshire include Bradford Interchange, Bradford Forster Square, Huddersfield, Halifax, Dewsbury, Keighley and Shipley. West Yorkshire also has Yorkshire&#x27;s largest airport, Leeds Bradford Airport.

Unlike South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire has no light transit system; the Leeds Supertram was proposed but was later cancelled after the withdrawal of government funding. Public transport is run under the authority of West Yorkshire Metro.

In October 2021, £830 million of funding was announced for the West Yorkshire Combined Authority to develop mass transit for the region.

In 2022, the West Yorkshire Combined Authority won its bids for the Zero Emission Bus Regional Areas (ZEBRA) scheme and Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) scheme, the successful ZEBRA funding will see the introduction of between 179 and 245 zero-emission electric buses with the necessary infrastructure whilst the BSIP plan will give the West Yorkshire Combined Authority £70 million out of a desired £168 million to implement the improvements outlined in the authority&#x27;s BSIP.

==Sport==
Major football clubs in West Yorkshire include Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, and Bradford City.

Rugby league is also big in West Yorkshire. The teams who are, or have been, in the Super League are Bradford Bulls, Castleford Tigers, Halifax Panthers, Huddersfield Giants, Leeds Rhinos, and Wakefield Trinity. Other rugby league clubs in West Yorkshire include Batley Bulldogs, Dewsbury Rams, Featherstone Rovers, Hunslet Hawks and Keighley Cougars. Any combination of these teams playing against each other would be called a West Yorkshire derby even if the rivalry is not as great as other rivalries between teams in the area. The main rugby union club in the county is Yorkshire Carnegie.

Elland Road is the largest stadium in the area, hosting Leeds United. The Headingley Stadium, a stadium complex also in Leeds, consists of a cricket and a rugby ground. The cricket ground is home of the Yorkshire County Cricket Club and the rugby ground is home to Leeds Rhinos. In Huddersfield, the John Smith&#x27;s Stadium is home to Huddersfield Town and Huddersfield Giants. In Bradford, Valley Parade is the home of Bradford City, whereas the Odsal Stadium is the home of the Bradford Bulls. Other stadiums include Wheldon Road (Castleford), The Shay (Halifax), Belle Vue (Wakefield), Mount Pleasant (Batley), Crown Flatt (Dewsbury), Post Office Road (Featherstone), John Charles Centre for Sport (Hunslet) and Cougar Park (Keighley).

There are two racecourses in West Yorkshire: Pontefract and Wetherby.

West Yorkshire also used to host regular speedway meetings, having the Halifax Dukes and the Bradford Dukes teams. Odsal Stadium used to host BriSCA stock cars. Leeds has a hill climb event at Harewood speed Hillclimb.

<doc id="149144" wikidata="Q181483" url="?curid=149144" title="Jackie Wilson">
<text>Jack Leroy Wilson Jr. (June 9, 1934 – January 21, 1984), also known as Jackie Wilson, was an American singer who was a prominent figure in the transition of rhythm and blues into soul. Nicknamed &quot;Mr. Excitement&quot;, he was considered a master showman and one of the most dynamic singers and performers in soul, R&amp;B, and rock and roll history. 

Born in the Detroit enclave of Highland Park, Michigan, Wilson gained initial fame as a member of the R&amp;B vocal group Billy Ward and His Dominoes. He went solo in 1957 and scored over 50 chart singles spanning the genres of R&amp;B, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, soul, doo-wop, and easy listening. This included 16 Top 10 R&amp;B hits, six of which ranked as number ones. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, Wilson scored 14 top 20 pop hits, six of which reached the top 10. In 1975, Wilson suffered a heart attack during a performance, which left him in a minimally conscious state until his death in 1984.

Wilson was posthumously inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. He is also inducted into the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame. Two of Wilson&#x27;s recordings were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. He was honored with the Legacy Tribute Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 2003. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Wilson No. 69 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and placed him on their list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time (2023). NPR named him one of the 50 Great Voices.

==Life and career==

===Early years ===
Jack Leroy Wilson Jr. was born on June 9, 1934 in Highland Park, Michigan, the third and only surviving child of Eliza Mae Wilson (1900-1975) and singer Jack Leroy Wilson, Sr. (1903–1983). Eliza Mae was born on the Billups-Whitfield Place in Lowndes County, Mississippi to Virginia and Tom Ransom. Wilson often visited his family in Columbus and was greatly influenced by the choir at Billups Chapel. Growing up in the suburban Detroit enclave of Highland Park, Wilson joined a gang called the Shakers and often got himself into trouble. His alcoholic father was frequently absent and usually unemployed, and in 1943 the Wilsons separated shortly after Jackie&#x27;s ninth birthday. 

Jackie Wilson began singing as a youth, accompanying his mother, an experienced church-choir singer. In his early teens he joined the Ever Ready Gospel Singers, who gained popularity in local churches. Wilson was not very religious, but he enjoyed singing in public. The money the quartet earned from performing was often spent on alcohol, and Wilson began drinking at an early age.

Wilson dropped out of high school at 15, having been sentenced twice to detention in the Lansing Corrections system for juveniles. During his second stint in detention, Wilson learned to box and began competing in the Detroit amateur circuit at age 16. His record in the Golden Gloves was 2 and 8. After his mother forced him to quit boxing, Wilson got his girlfriend Freda Hood pregnant and her father forced him to marry her. He became a father at 17.

=== Early career ===
Wilson began working at Lee&#x27;s Sensation Club as a solo singer, then formed a group called the Falcons that included cousin Levi Stubbs, who later led the Four Tops. (Two more of Wilson&#x27;s cousins, Hubert Johnson and Levi&#x27;s brother Joe, later became members of the Contours.) The other Falcons joined Hank Ballard as part of the Midnighters, including Alonzo Tucker and Billy Davis, who worked with Wilson several years later as a solo artist. Tucker and Wilson collaborated as songwriters on a few songs Wilson recorded, including his 1963 hit &quot;Baby Workout&quot;.

Wilson was discovered by talent agent Johnny Otis, who recruited him for a group called the Thrillers. That group evolved into the Royals (who later became R&amp;B group, the Midnighters, though Wilson was not part of the group when it changed its name and signed with King Records). Wilson signed on with manager Al Green (not to be confused with R&amp;B singer Al Green or Albert &quot;Al&quot; Green of the now-defunct National Records). Green, who also managed LaVern Baker, Little Willie John, Johnnie Ray, and Della Reese, owned two music publishing companies, Pearl Music and Merrimac Music; and Detroit&#x27;s Flame Show Bar, where Wilson met Baker.

After Wilson recorded his first version of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and a few other tracks on Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s record label Dee Gee Records under his nickname, Sonny Wilson, he was eventually hired by Billy Ward in 1953 to join a group Ward formed in 1950 called the Dominoes, after Wilson&#x27;s successful audition to replace the immensely popular Clyde McPhatter, who left the Dominoes and formed the Drifters. Wilson almost blew his chance that day, showing up calling himself &quot;The shit&quot; Wilson and bragging about being a better singer than McPhatter.

Billy Ward felt a stage name would better fit the Dominoes&#x27; image, hence &quot;Jackie&quot; Wilson. Before leaving the Dominoes, McPhatter coached Wilson on the sound Billy Ward wanted for his group, influencing Wilson&#x27;s singing style and stage presence. &quot;I learned a lot from Clyde, that high-pitched choke he used and other things...Clyde McPhatter was my man. Clyde and Billy Ward.&quot; 1940s blues singer Roy Brown was also a major influence on him, and Wilson grew up listening to the Mills Brothers, the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan and Al Jolson.

Wilson was the group&#x27;s lead singer for three years, but the Dominoes lost some of their stride with the departure of McPhatter. They made appearances riding on the strength of the group&#x27;s earlier hits, until 1956 when the Dominoes recorded Wilson with an interpretation of the pop hit &quot;St. Therese of the Roses&quot;, giving the Dominoes another brief moment in the spotlight. (Their only other post-McPhatter/Wilson successes were &quot;Stardust&quot;, released July 15, 1957, and &quot;Deep Purple&quot;, released October 7, 1957.) In 1957 Wilson began a solo career, left the Dominoes, collaborated with his cousin Levi, and secured performances at Detroit&#x27;s Flame Show Bar. Later, Al Green secured a deal with Decca Records, and Wilson was signed to its subsidiary label Brunswick.

===Solo stardom===

Shortly before Wilson signed a solo contract with Brunswick, Green suddenly died. Green&#x27;s business partner Nat Tarnopol took over as Wilson&#x27;s manager (and ultimately rose to president of Brunswick). Wilson&#x27;s first single was released, &quot;Reet Petite&quot; (from his first album &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;), which became a modest R&amp;B success (many years later, an international smash hit). &quot;Reet Petite&quot; was co-written by future Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. (another former boxer who was a native son of Detroit), with partner Roquel &quot;Billy&quot; Davis (using the pseudonym Tyran Carlo) and Gordy&#x27;s sister Gwendolyn. The trio composed and produced six additional singles for Wilson: &quot;To Be Loved&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Wanderin, &quot;We Have Love&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Why (I Love You So)&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Satisfied&quot;, and Wilson&#x27;s late-1958 signature song, &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot;, which peaked at No. 7 on the pop charts, ranked No. 1 on the R&amp;B charts in the U.S., and established Wilson as an R&amp;B superstar known for his extraordinary, operatic multi-octave vocal range. Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA.
Wilson&#x27;s fervor when performing, his dynamic dance moves, impassioned singing, and fashion sense, earned him the nickname &quot;Mr. Excitement&quot;, a moniker that remained throughout his career. His stagecraft in his live shows inspired James Brown, Teddy Pendergrass, Michael Jackson and Elvis Presley, as well as a host of other artists that followed. Presley was so impressed with Wilson that he set out to meet him, and the two instantly became good friends. In a photo of the two posing together, Presley&#x27;s caption in the autograph reads &quot;You got you a friend for life&quot;. Wilson was sometimes called &quot;The Black Elvis&quot;. Reportedly, when asked about this Presley said, &quot;I guess that makes me the white Jackie Wilson.&quot; Wilson also said he was influenced by Presley, saying, &quot;A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man&#x27;s music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s powerful, electrifying live performances rarely failed to bring audiences to a state of frenzy. His live performances consisted of knee-drops, splits, spins, back-flips, one-footed across-the-floor slides, removing his tie and jacket and throwing them off the stage, basic boxing steps like advance and retreat shuffling, and one of his favorite routines, getting some of the less attractive women in the audience to come up to the stage and kiss him. Wilson often said &quot;if I get the ugliest girl in the audience to come up and kiss me, they&#x27;ll all think they can have me and keep coming back and buying my records.&quot;

Wilson was a regular on TV, making regular appearances on such shows as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;Shivaree&quot; and &quot;Hullabaloo&quot;. His only movie appearance was in the rock and roll film &quot;Go, Johnny, Go!&quot;, where he performed his 1959 hit song &quot;You Better Know It&quot;.

In 1958, Davis and Gordy left Wilson and Brunswick after royalty disputes escalated between them and Nat Tarnopol. Davis soon became a successful staff songwriter and producer for Chess Records, while Gordy borrowed $800 from his family and used money he earned from royalties writing for Wilson to start his own recording studio, Hitsville USA, the foundation of Motown Records in his native Detroit. Meanwhile, convinced that Wilson could venture out of R&amp;B and rock and roll, Tarnopol had the singer record operatic ballads and easy-listening material, pairing him with Decca Records&#x27; veteran arranger Dick Jacobs.

Wilson scored hits as he entered the 1960s with the No. 15 &quot;Doggin&#x27; Around&quot;, the No. 4 pop ballad &quot;Night&quot;, another million-seller, and &quot;Baby Workout&quot;, another Top 10 hit (No. 5), which he composed with The Midnighters member Alonzo Tucker. His songwriting alliance with Tucker also turned out other songs, including &quot;No Pity (In The Naked City)&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m So Lonely.&quot; Top 10 hits continued with &quot;Alone at Last&quot; (No. 8 in 1960) and &quot;My Empty Arms&quot; (No. 9 in 1961).

Also in 1961, Wilson recorded a tribute album to Al Jolson, &quot;Nowstalgia ... You Ain&#x27;t Heard Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot;, which included the only album liner notes he ever wrote: &quot;... to the greatest entertainer of this or any other era ... I guess I have just about every recording he&#x27;s ever made, and I rarely missed listening to him on the radio ... During the three years I&#x27;ve been making records, I&#x27;ve had the ambition to do an album of songs, which, to me, represent the great Jolson heritage ... This is simply my humble tribute to the one man I admire most in this business ... to keep the heritage of Jolson alive.&quot; The album was a commercial failure.

Following the success of &quot;Baby Workout&quot;, Wilson experienced a lull in his career between 1964 and 1966 as Tarnopol and Brunswick Records released a succession of unsuccessful albums and singles. Despite the lack of sales success, Wilson still made artistic gains as he recorded an album with Count Basie, as well as a series of duets with R &amp; B artist LaVern Baker and gospel singer Linda Hopkins.

In 1966, Wilson scored the first of two big comeback singles with the established Chicago soul producer Carl Davis with &quot;Whispers (Gettin&#x27; Louder)&quot; and &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot;, the latter a No. 6 pop hit in 1967 that became one of his final hits. &quot;I Get the Sweetest Feeling&quot;, despite its modest initial chart success in the U.S. (Billboard Pop No. 34), has since become one of his biggest international chart successes, ranking in Top 10 twice in the UK (in 1972 and 1987), and in the Top 20 of the Dutch Top 40. &quot;I Get the Sweetest Feeling&quot; spawned numerous cover versions by other artists such as Edwin Starr, Will Young, Erma Franklin (Aretha Franklin&#x27;s sister) and Liz McClarnon.

A key to Wilson&#x27;s musical rebirth was Davis insisting that he no longer record with Brunswick&#x27;s musicians in New York; instead, he recorded with Detroit musicians normally employed by Motown Records and also Davis&#x27; own Chicago-based session players. The Detroit musicians, known as the Funk Brothers, participated on Wilson&#x27;s recordings due to their respect for Davis and Wilson.

By 1975, Wilson and the Chi-Lites were the only significant artists left on Brunswick&#x27;s roster. Wilson had continued to record singles that found success on the R&amp;B chart, but found no significant pop-chart success. His final hit, &quot;You Got Me Walkin, written by Eugene Record of the Chi-Lites, was released in 1972 with the Chi-Lites backing him on vocals and instruments.

==Illness and death==
On September 29, 1975, Wilson was one of the featured acts in Dick Clark&#x27;s Good Ol&#x27; Rock and Roll Revue, hosted by the Latin Casino in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. He was in the middle of singing &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; when he suffered a massive heart attack. On the words &quot;My heart is crying&quot; he collapsed on stage; audience members applauded as they initially thought it was part of the act. Clark sensed something was wrong, then ordered the musicians to stop the music. Cornell Gunter of the Coasters, who was backstage, noticed Wilson was not breathing. Gunter was able to resuscitate him and Wilson was then rushed to a nearby hospital. According to Larry Geller, Wilson wanted to sweat profusely during his performances, explaining to Elvis Presley, &quot;The chicks love it.&quot; To induce the effect, he would take a handful of salt tablets and drink a large amount of water before going onstage. High salt consumption is known to be a risk factor for heart disease. Among the other witnesses to the first meeting with Elvis, no one ever confirmed that this story was serious and that it was not a joke made by a man who had lost a kidney, so taking salt tablets would be unlikely. 

Medical personnel worked to stabilize Wilson&#x27;s vital signs, but the lack of oxygen to his brain caused him to slip into a coma. He briefly recovered in early 1976, and was even able to take a few wobbly steps, but slipped back into a semi-comatose state.

Wilson&#x27;s friend, fellow singer Bobby Womack, planned a benefit at the Hollywood Palladium to raise funds for Wilson on March 4. Wilson was deemed conscious but incapacitated in early June 1976, aware of his surroundings but unable to speak. He was a resident of the Medford Leas Retirement Center in Medford, New Jersey, when he was admitted into Memorial Hospital of Burlington County in Mount Holly, New Jersey, due to having trouble taking nourishment, according to his attorney John Mulkerin. Elvis Presley covered a large portion of Wilson’s medical bills. Wilson&#x27;s friend Joyce McRae tried to become his caregiver while he was in the nursing home, but he was placed in the guardianship of his estranged wife Harlean Harris and her lawyer John Mulkerin in 1978.

Wilson died on January 21, 1984, at the age of 49 from complications of pneumonia. He was initially buried in an unmarked grave at Westlawn Cemetery near Detroit.

In 1987, fans raised money in a fundraiser spearheaded by an Orlando disc jockey &quot;Jack the Rapper&quot; Gibson to purchase a mausoleum. On June 9, 1987, his 53rd birthday, a ceremony was held and Wilson was interred in the mausoleum at Westlawn Cemetery in Wayne, Michigan. His mother Eliza Wilson, who died in 1975, was also placed in the mausoleum.

==Personal life==
Wilson converted to Judaism as an adult, likely as a publicity stunt. He recorded a version of Lew Pollack and Jack Yellen&#x27;s famed Jewish-themed song &quot;My Yiddishe Momme&quot; in New York in November 1960.

Wilson had a reputation for being short-tempered and promiscuous. In her autobiography, Patti LaBelle accused Wilson of sexually assaulting her backstage at Brooklyn&#x27;s Brevoort Theatre in the 1960s.

On February 15, 1961, in Manhattan, Wilson was shot and seriously wounded by Juanita Jones, one of his girlfriends, who shot him in a jealous rage when he returned to his Manhattan apartment with another woman: Fashion model Harlean Harris, an ex-girlfriend of Sam Cooke (and later Wilson&#x27;s second wife). Wilson&#x27;s management supposedly concocted the story about her being a zealous fan to protect Wilson&#x27;s reputation. They claimed that Jones was an obsessed fan who had threatened to shoot herself, and that Wilson&#x27;s intervention resulted in his being shot. Wilson was shot in the stomach; the wound resulted in the loss of a kidney, and the bullet lodged too close to his spine to be removed.

In early 1975, during an interview with author Arnold Shaw, Wilson maintained that he was actually shot by a zealous fan he didn&#x27;t know. &quot;We also had some trouble in 1961. That was when some crazy chick took a shot at me and nearly put me away for good...&quot; No charges were brought against Jones.

=== Legal problems ===
In 1960, Wilson was arrested and charged with assaulting a police officer when fans tried to climb on stage in New Orleans. He assaulted a policeman who had shoved one of the fans.

In 1964, Wilson jumped from a second-floor window at Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis to avoid being arrested after a show. His arrest stemmed from a default of a $2,260 civil judgment relating to his failure to appear at the Club Riviera in 1959. He was caught by the police and jailed for a day before he posted a $3,000 bond.

In March 1967, Wilson and his drummer, Jimmy Smith, were arrested in South Carolina on &quot;morals charges&quot;; the two were entertaining two 24-year-old white women in their motel room.

=== Financial issues ===
In 1961, Wilson declared annual earnings of $263,000, while the average annual salary at that time was just $5,000, but he discovered that, despite being at the peak of his success, he was broke. Around this time the IRS seized Wilson&#x27;s Detroit family home. Tarnopol and his accountants were supposed to take care of such matters. Wilson made arrangements with the IRS to make restitution on the unpaid taxes; he also re-purchased the family home at auction. Nat Tarnopol had taken advantage of Wilson&#x27;s naïveté, mismanaging his money since becoming his manager. Tarnopol also had power of attorney over Wilson&#x27;s finances.

Tarnopol and 18 other Brunswick executives were indicted on federal charges of mail fraud and tax evasion stemming from bribery and payola scandals in 1975. Also in the indictment was the charge that Tarnopol owed at least $1 million in royalties to Wilson. In 1976 Tarnopol and the others were found guilty; an appeals court overturned their conviction 18 months later. Although the conviction was overturned, judges went into detail, outlining that Tarnopol and Brunswick Records did defraud their artists of royalties, and that they were satisfied that there was sufficient evidence for Wilson to file a lawsuit. However, a trial to sue Tarnopol for royalties never took place, as Wilson lay in a nursing home semi-comatose. Tarnopol never paid Wilson monies he had coming to him, and Wilson died owing money to Brunswick Records and an estimated $300,000 to the IRS.

=== Marriages and children ===
At the age of 17, Wilson married his pregnant girlfriend Freda Hood in 1951. They had four children: Jacqueline Denise (1951–1988), Sandra Kay (1953–1977), Jackie Jr (1954–1970), and Anthony Duane. Hood divorced Wilson in 1965 after 14 years of marriage, as she was frustrated with his notorious womanizing.

In 1967, Wilson married his second wife, model Harlean Harris (1937–2019), at the urging of Nat Tarnopol, who thought the marriage would help repair Wilson&#x27;s public image. They had been dating since at least 1960 and their son John Dominick (known as Petey), was born in 1963. Wilson and Harris legally separated in 1969. They never officially divorced, but at the time he had his heart attack in 1975, he was in a relationship with a woman named Lynn Guidry, who was under the impression that she was his legal wife. Harris was the one who became his court-appointed guardian in 1978. 

In 1970, Wilson&#x27;s 16-year-old son Jackie Jr. was shot and killed on a neighbor&#x27;s porch near their Detroit home. Wilson sank into a period of depression, remaining a near-recluse for the next few years. He turned to drug abuse and continued to drink in an attempt to cope with the loss of his son. More tragedy hit when both of Wilson&#x27;s daughters died young: Sandra died in 1977 at age 24 of an apparent heart attack, and her older sister Jacqueline was killed in 1988 in a drug-related incident in Highland Park, Michigan.

Wilson also fathered many out-of-wedlock children with different women, including singer Bobby Brooks Wilson, who performs his father&#x27;s songs in tribute. 

==Tributes and legacy==
Van Morrison recorded a tribute song called &quot;Jackie Wilson Said (I&#x27;m in Heaven When You Smile)&quot; on his 1972 album &quot;Saint Dominic&#x27;s Preview&quot;. It was covered by Dexys Midnight Runners in 1982.

After Wilson&#x27;s death, Michael Jackson paid tribute to him at the 1984 Grammy Awards. Jackson dedicated his Album of the Year Grammy for &quot;Thriller&quot; to Wilson, saying, &quot;Some people are entertainers and some people are great entertainers. Some people are followers. And some people make the path and are pioneers. I&#x27;d like to say Jackie Wilson was a wonderful entertainer. He&#x27;s not with us anymore, but Jackie, where you are I&#x27;d like to say, I love you and thank you so much.&quot;

In 1985, the Commodores recorded &quot;Nightshift&quot; in memory of Wilson and soul singer Marvin Gaye, who had both died in 1984.

Wilson scored a posthumous hit in Europe when &quot;Reet Petite&quot; topped the charts in the Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1986. This success was likely due in part to a new animated video made for the song, featuring a clay model of Wilson, that became popular on the BBC Two TV network in the latter country. The following year, Wilson&#x27;s posthumous charting success in the United Kingdom continued when he hit the UK Singles Chart again with &quot;I Get the Sweetest Feeling&quot; (number three), and &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; (number 15).

In Berry Gordy&#x27;s 1994 autobiography &quot;To Be Loved&quot; (named for one of the hit tunes he wrote for Wilson), Motown&#x27;s founder stated that Wilson was &quot;The greatest singer I&#x27;ve ever heard. The epitome of natural greatness. Unfortunately for some, he set the standard I&#x27;d be looking for in singers forever&quot;.

In 1994, Peter Tork of The Monkees recorded a bluegrass-rock cover of &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; on his first solo album, &quot;Stranger Things Have Happened&quot;, having previously self-released a single featuring it in 1981. The song remained Tork&#x27;s signature solo number in subsequent Monkees concert tours.

In the 2010 VH1 television special &quot;Say It Loud: A Celebration of Black Music in America&quot;, Smokey Robinson and Bobby Womack both paid tribute to Wilson. Smokey explained that &quot;Jackie Wilson was &quot;the&quot; most dynamic singer and performer that I think I&#x27;ve &quot;ever&quot; seen.&quot; Bobby added &quot;He was the &quot;real&quot; Elvis Presley, as far as I&#x27;m concerned...and Elvis took a lot from him too.&quot;

In 2010, Wilson&#x27;s songs &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; and &quot;Lonely Teardrops&quot; were ranked No. 248 and No. 315 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

In 2014, artist Hozier released a song titled &quot;Jackie and Wilson&quot;, which includes the lyrics &quot;We&#x27;ll name our children Jackie and Wilson and raise them on rhythm and blues.&quot;

In 2016, Cottage Grove Street in Detroit was renamed Jackie Wilson Lane in his honor.

In 2018, Hologram USA Networks Inc. launched the hologram stage show, &quot;Higher &amp; Higher: The Jackie Wilson Story&quot;.

During their 2019–20 season, &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; was played following every home win by the St. Louis Blues.

During the 2024 Democratic National Convention, his song &quot;(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher&quot; was played to introduce President Joe Biden before his speech.

<text>Alan Sydney Minter (17 August 19519 September 2020) was a British professional boxer who competed from 1972 to 1981. He held the undisputed middleweight title in 1980, having previously held the British middleweight title from 1975 to 1976, and the European middleweight title twice between 1977 and 1979. As an amateur, Minter won a bronze medal in the light-middleweight division at the 1972 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Minter was born in Penge, Bromley, Kent, to his German-born mother Anne Minter, and his father Syd Minter, a plasterer. His family moved to Crawley, West Sussex, and he joined Crawley Boxing Club at aged 11, training under John Hillier and Dougie Bidwell.

== Amateur career ==
Minter took part at the 1970 European Junior Championships at the middleweight division, but in the very first fight he was stopped in the 2-nd round by Vyacheslav Lemeshev (USSR). Because Minter was the 1971 Amateur Boxing Association of England Middleweight Champion, he was selected to box for UK in the Olympics 1972. He won a bronze medal at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games in the light-middleweight classification, losing in the semifinal to Dieter Kottysch of West Germany by a 3-2 marginal decision which was hotly disputed. Kottysch went on to win the gold medal.

=== 1972 Olympic results ===
Minter&#x27;s results at the 1972 Munich Olympics are as follows:

* Round of 64: bye
* Round of 32: Defeated Reggie Ford (Guyana) by second-round knockout
* Round of 16: Defeated Valeri Tregubov (Soviet Union) by decision, 5–0
* Quarterfinal: Defeated Loucif Hamani (Algeria) by decision, 4–1
* Semifinal: Lost to Dieter Kottysch (West Germany) by decision, 2–3 (was awarded bronze medal)

== Professional career ==
Minter began his professional career with 11 straight wins, the first against Maurice Thomas in London on 31 October 1972, winning by knockout in the 6th round.
Minter won his first five fights by knockout until 16 January 1973, when Pat Dwyer went the distance, Minter taking the fight on points. Minter won his next five fights, three by knockout, before being defeated for the first time after the referee stopped the fight in the eighth round against &quot;Scottish&quot; Don McMillan due to bad cuts suffered by Minter. Two more wins followed before facing Jan Magdziarz, who beat him twice in a row (once in the eighth and once in the sixth) again due to cuts.

1974 was a mixed year for Minter, beating Tony Byrne by a decision in eight, losing in two to Ricky Torres (again on cuts), having a third fight with Magdziarz, resulting in a no contest, closing the year with a win against Shako Mamba in Hamburg, Germany.

In 1975, he won four fights in a row, including another bout in Hamburg and, by the end of the year, he challenged Kevin Finnegan for the British Middleweight title, winning it by a 15-round decision.

In 1976, he won six fights, to extend his streak to ten consecutive wins. Among the boxers he beat were Billy Knight by a knockout and Finnegan once again, by decision in 15, both in defence of his British title, along with former world title challenger Tony Licata, knocked out in six and United States Olympic Games Gold medal winner Sugar Ray Seales, in five rounds. These wins gave Minter a ranking among the top ten Middleweight challengers.

In 1977, he won the European Middleweight title by beating Germano Valsecchi by a knockout in five in Italy. But in his next fight his winning streak ended when he lost to former world title challenger Ronnie Harris by a knockout in eight. Minter returned to top ten challenger status by upsetting the former World Welterweight and Light Middleweight Champion Emile Griffith with a ten-round decision win in Monte Carlo, but then he lost his European title to Gratien Tonna by a knockout in eight at Milan. He closed &#x27;77 with a third 15-round decision win over Finnegan to retain his British title.

1978 was a sad year for Minter, although he won all three of his bouts. On 15 February, at the Muhammad Ali–Leon Spinks I undercard in Las Vegas, Nevada, he won his first bout in the United States by knocking out Sandy Torres in five. Then, he went to Italy once again to regain his European Middleweight title by knocking out Angelo Jacopucci in twelve rounds. Jacopucci died a few days afterwards, due to injuries sustained in the bout. Minter finished his year by avenging his loss to Tonna with a six-round knockout.

In 1979, Minter won all four of his fights, two of them by knockout. On 16 March 1980, in Las Vegas, he was given a shot at World Middleweight Champion Vito Antuofermo&#x27;s title at Caesars Palace. He won the title by a 15-round split decision in which the judges&#x27; scorecards varied wildly. A Venezuelan judge had Minter losing the fight, while the British judge (Roland Dakin) had Minter winning 13 of the 15 rounds. In a rematch held three months later in London on 28 June, Minter retained the world title by a TKO in eight rounds.
On 27 September 1980, Minter&#x27;s short run as world champion came to an abrupt end when he was stopped on cuts in the third round against &#x27;Marvelous&#x27; Marvin Hagler at Wembley Arena in London. The fight was controversial owing to a racially-charged remark Minter made during the build-up (Minter was alleged to have said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t intend to lose his title to a black man&quot;, though he insisted that he had actually said that he didn&#x27;t intend to lose to &quot;that&quot; black man, and had been goaded to say so by his promoters) and then by a crowd riot once the referee had agreed with Minter&#x27;s corner that he was unable to continue, with chairs, bottles and glasses being hurled into the ring after the decision.

Minter beat fringe contender Ernie Singletary in London, in 1981, but after losses to future Hagler challengers Mustafa Hamsho in Las Vegas and Tony Sibson in London, he retired for good.

He left boxing with a record of 39 wins, 9 losses and 1 no contest, with 23 wins by knockout.

==Death==
Minter died of cancer in September 2020, in Guildford at the age of 69.

<doc id="149147" wikidata="Q6213911" url="?curid=149147" title="Joel Roth">
<text>Joel Roth is an American rabbi in the Rabbinical Assembly, which is the rabbinical body of Conservative Judaism. He is a former member and chair of the assembly&#x27;s &quot;Committee on Jewish Law and Standards&quot; (CJLS) which deals with questions of Jewish law and tradition, and serves as the Louis Finkelstein Professor of Talmud and Jewish Law at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA or JTS) in New York City, where he formerly served as dean of the Rabbinical School. He is also Rosh Yeshiva (head of school) of the Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel, an institution founded and maintained by the United Synagogue for Conservative Judaism and under the academic auspices of JTS. In 2006, Roth took over as chair of the Hebrew Language department at JTS.

==Education==

Roth received a BA from Wayne State University in his hometown of Detroit. He received his master&#x27;s degree at JTS, where he was ordained in 1968. That same year, Roth was appointed to the faculty of JTS as he continued his studies toward a PhD in Talmud, which he received in 1973. In the early 1970s Roth taught at the Prozdor of the Highland Park (N.J.) Conservative Temple and Center. Upon receiving his Ph.D., he was made an associate professor at JTS. Roth has held four key administrative positions, serving as dean of students of List College (then called Seminary College), director of the Melton Research Center for Jewish Education, and both associate dean and dean of the rabbinical school.

==Career==
Roth served as dean of the rabbinical school from 1981 to 1984 as well as in 1992–1993, resigning both times after a major scandal. Roth resigned in 1984 as part of a settlement of a potential lawsuit by the family of a student whom Roth had allegedly sexually harassed. The accusation was kept secret at the time, though it came to light when an anonymous letter surfaced in 1993 during Roth&#x27;s second term as dean. Then, on March 29, 1993, Roth resigned after he allegedly made a sexually explicit statement to a student at the seminary&#x27;s West Coast affiliate, the Los Angeles-based University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University), during a group interview.

An expert in Conservative approaches to, and interpretations of, the halakhah, Roth was appointed to the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards in 1978, and served as chairman for eight years. Many of his responsa for the CJLS have been published in a number of collections by the Rabbinical Assembly and the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. In addition to articles and responsa for the committee, Roth has written &quot;The Halakhic Process: A Systemic Analysis&quot; and &quot;Sefer ha-Mordecai: Tractate Kiddushin.&quot; He is most well known for writing an influential responsum supporting the ordination of women as rabbis, which was considered by the JTS faculty as part of its 1983 women&#x27;s ordination decision. Roth is also author of a responsum arguing that homosexuality is forbidden specifically to Jews, supporting reaffirmation of the Conservative movement&#x27;s then current stance excluding open homosexuals from JTS rabbinic and cantorial schools, but arguing against a view that homosexuality is generally immoral or a social wrong.

On December 6, 2006, Roth resigned from the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards after the acceptance of a paper by Rabbis Elliot Dorff, Daniel Nevins and Avram Reisner on homosexual relationships and ordination of homosexual rabbis, while it upheld the biblical prohibition on male intercourse. The committee also adopted Roth&#x27;s own, diametrically opposed responsum, maintaining a complete prohibition on homosexual conduct.

<doc id="149148" wikidata="Q983981" url="?curid=149148" title="Roger Ailes">
<text>Roger Eugene Ailes (May 15, 1940 – May 18, 2017) was an American television executive and media consultant. He was the chairman and CEO of Fox News, Fox Television Stations and 20th Television. Ailes was a media consultant for Republican presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush, and for Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s 1989 New York City mayoral election. In July 2016, he left Fox News after allegations of sexually harassing female Fox employees, including on-air hosts Gretchen Carlson, Megyn Kelly, and Andrea Tantaros.

Ailes had hemophilia, a medical condition in which the body is impaired in its ability to produce blood clots. He died on May 18, 2017, at the age of 77 after a subdural hematoma that was aggravated by his hemophilia. Ailes is known for his influence on conservative media, the conservative movement, and American Presidents. He is also considered controversial due to the numerous allegations of sexual harassment against Ailes throughout his career and for allegedly creating a misogynistic environment at Fox News.

== Early life ==
Ailes was born and grew up in the factory town of Warren, Ohio, the son of Donna Marie (&quot;née&quot; Cunningham) and Robert Eugene Ailes, a factory maintenance foreman. Ailes had hemophilia and was often hospitalized as a youth. He attended the Warren city schools, and later was inducted into Warren G. Harding High School&#x27;s Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame. Actor and playwright Austin Pendleton was a childhood friend of Ailes.

Ailes&#x27;s father was an authoritarian parent who was often physically and verbally abusive, while Ailes later recalled that his mother feared his hemophilia and was only physically affectionate &quot;once in a while&quot;. His parents divorced in 1960; when he came home from college for Christmas break, they informed him that he would have to stay at a friend&#x27;s house. In 1962, Ailes graduated from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, where he majored in radio and television and served as the student station manager for WOUB for two years.

== Career ==
=== Early television ===
Ailes&#x27;s career in television began in Cleveland and Philadelphia, where he started as production assistant (1961), producer (1965), and executive producer (1967–68) at KYW-TV, for a then-locally produced talk-variety show, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;. He continued as executive producer for the show when it was syndicated nationally, and in 1967 and 1968 he won Emmy Awards for it.

In 1967, Ailes had a spirited discussion about television in politics with one of the show&#x27;s guests, Richard Nixon, who took the view that television was a gimmick. Later, Nixon called on Ailes to serve as his Executive Producer for television. Nixon&#x27;s successful presidential campaign was Ailes&#x27;s first venture into the political spotlight. His pioneering work in framing national campaign issues was later chronicled in &quot;The Selling of the President 1968&quot; by Joe McGinniss.

Ailes was an employee of Television News Inc., a syndicated television newsfilm service owned by Joseph Coors, from January to September 1975.

=== Political consulting ===

In 1984, Ailes worked on the campaign to reelect Ronald Reagan. In 1987 and 1988, Ailes was credited (along with fellow consultant Lee Atwater) with guiding George H. W. Bush to victory in the Republican primaries and in the victory over Michael Dukakis.

Ailes was credited with the &quot;Orchestra Pit Theory&quot; regarding sensationalist political coverage in the news media, which originated with his quip: Ailes&#x27;s last campaign was the unsuccessful effort of Richard Thornburgh in his run for the U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania in November 1991. He announced his withdrawal from political consulting in 1991.

Days after the 9/11 attacks, Ailes advised President George W. Bush that the American public would be patient as long as they were convinced that Bush was using the harshest measures possible. The correspondence was revealed in Bob Woodward&#x27;s book &quot;Bush at War&quot;. Criticized for giving political advice, Ailes lashed out against Woodward, saying &quot;Woodward got it all screwed up, as usual&quot;, and &quot;The reason he&#x27;s not as rich as Tom Clancy is that while he and Clancy both make stuff up, Clancy does his research first.&quot; Ailes refused to release a copy of the memo he sent to Bush.

=== Book ===
In 1988, Ailes wrote a book with long-time aide Jon Kraushar entitled &quot;You Are the Message: Secrets of the Master Communicators&quot;.
In 1989, Ailes wrote a book with Jon Kraushar entitled &quot;You Are the Message: Getting What You Want by Being Who You Are&quot;.

=== America&#x27;s Talking channel ===
Ailes eventually made his way back to television, this time focusing on cable news. In 1993, he became president of CNBC and later created the America&#x27;s Talking channel, which would eventually become MSNBC. He hosted an interview program on &quot;America&#x27;s Talking&quot;. In 1995, NBC hired a law firm to conduct an internal investigation after Ailes allegedly called NBC executive David Zaslav a &quot;little fucking Jew prick.&quot; This was not confirmed as the reason for his departure.

=== 20th Television/Fox News ===
Ailes was hired by News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch in 1996 to become the CEO of Fox News, effective on October 7.

After the departure of Lachlan Murdoch from News Corporation, Ailes was named Chairman of the Fox Television Stations Group on August 15, 2005. Following his newest assignment, one of his first acts was canceling &quot;A Current Affair&quot; in September 2005 and replacing it with a new Geraldo Rivera show, &quot;Geraldo at Large&quot;, which debuted on Halloween, 2005. Rivera&#x27;s show drew about the same ratings as &quot;A Current Affair&quot; in January 2007.

Ailes hired former Viacom executive Dennis Swanson in October 2005 to be president of the Fox Television Stations Group. Additionally, there were changes in affiliates&#x27; news programs with the standardization of Fox News Channel-like graphics, redesigned studios, news-format changes, and the announcement of a new morning television show called &quot;The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet&quot; to be produced by Fox News Channel.

In January 2011, 400 rabbis, including leaders from various branches of Judaism in the United States, published an open letter in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; on the UN-designated Holocaust Remembrance Day. They called on Rupert Murdoch to sanction Fox News commentator Glenn Beck for his use of the Holocaust to &quot;discredit any individual or organization you disagree with.&quot; An executive at Fox News rejected the letter, calling it the work of a &quot;George Soros-backed left wing political organization.&quot; Ailes is also said to have once referred to Jewish critics of his as &quot;left-wing rabbis.&quot;

Also in 2011, Ailes was criticized for referring to executives of the public radio network NPR as &quot;Nazis&quot; for firing a news analyst, Juan Williams, after Williams had made remarks considered by NPR to be offensive. Ailes apologized to a Jewish group, but not to NPR, for using the expression, writing to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL): &quot;I was of course ad-libbing and should not have chosen that word, but I was angry at the time because of NPR&#x27;s willingness to censor Juan Williams for not being liberal enough ... My now considered opinion &#x27;nasty, inflexible bigot&#x27; would have worked better.&quot; The ADL welcomed and accepted the apology through its National Director, Abraham Foxman; in a subsequent letter to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; Foxman said that both Ailes and Beck were &quot;pro-Israel stalwarts.&quot;

In October 2012, Ailes&#x27;s contract with Fox News was renewed for four years, through 2016. If completed, he would have served as head of Fox News Channel for 20 years. Salary terms were not made public, although his earnings for the 2012 fiscal year were $21 million (~$ in ) inclusive of bonuses. In addition to heading Fox News and chairing Fox Television Stations, Ailes also chaired 20th Television, MyNetworkTV and Fox Business Network.

==== Sexual harassment cases ====
In a book published in 2014, Gabriel Sherman alleged that, in the 1980s, Ailes offered a television producer a raise if she would sleep with him. Fox News denied the allegation and rejected the authenticity of Sherman&#x27;s book.

On July 6, 2016, former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Ailes; Carlson&#x27;s allegations were the impetus for more than a dozen female employees at 21st Century Fox to step forward regarding their own experiences with Ailes&#x27;s behaviour. Carlson alleged that she had been fired for rebuffing Ailes&#x27;s advances. Ailes, through his attorney, Susan Estrich, denied the charges. Three days later, Sherman reported accounts from six women (two publicly and four anonymously) who alleged sexual harassment by Ailes. In response, Ailes&#x27;s counsel released a statement: &quot;It has become obvious that Ms. Carlson and her lawyer are desperately attempting to litigate this in the press because they have no legal case to argue.&quot;

==== Resignation ====
Ten days later, &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that an internal review into Carlson&#x27;s claims had expanded into a broader review of Ailes&#x27;s stewardship. It also claimed Rupert Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, had seen enough information in the preliminary review to conclude that Ailes had to go. They disagreed on the timing, however; James wanted Ailes out immediately, while Rupert and Lachlan wanted to wait until after the Republican National Convention. On July 19, &quot;New York&quot; reported that Megyn Kelly told investigators Ailes made &quot;unwanted sexual advances toward her&quot; at the start of her career. The magazine also reported that the Murdochs had given Ailes an ultimatum—resign by August 1 or be fired.

On July 21, 2016, Ailes resigned from Fox News, receiving about $40 million (~$ in ) from 21st Century Fox (the then-parent company of 20th Century Fox and Fox News) in an exit agreement. Rupert Murdoch succeeded him as chairman, and as interim CEO until the naming of a permanent replacement. In a letter to Murdoch, Ailes wrote: &quot;I will not allow my presence to become a distraction from the work that must be done every day to ensure that Fox News and Fox Business continue to lead our industry.&quot; Ailes was thanked for his work, without mention of the allegations. He continued to advise Murdoch and 21st Century Fox through 2017 until his death.

===After 20th Television and Fox News===
Following Ailes&#x27; resignation, Andrea Tantaros claimed in August 2016 that she approached Fox News executives about Ailes&#x27; behavior towards her in 2015. She stated that her allegations resulted first in her being demoted, and then in her being taken off the air in April 2016. Tantaros filed a lawsuit against Fox News in August 2016 for sexual harassment, also accusing Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Scott Brown.

On August 8, 2016, Shelley Ross, writing for &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, described her encounter of sexual harassment with Ailes in 1981. She claimed that at a lunch meeting Ailes asked her, &quot;When did you first discover you were sexy?&quot; When Ross explained to Ailes that she found the conversation &quot;very embarrassing,&quot; he responded that &quot;the best expression of loyalty comes in the form of a sexual alliance.&quot; The next month, 21st Century Fox announced it had settled a lawsuit with Carlson over her allegations of harassment against Ailes. 21st Century Fox was also reported to have made separate settlements with at least two other women who made complaints about Ailes.

In November 2016, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly wrote in her book about the details of her sexual abuse allegations against Ailes. According to Kelly, when she first joined Fox News, Ailes would have meetings with her, during which he would make sexual remarks. Kelly alleges that he also tried to kiss her several times during a closed-door meeting, but she was able to get away and leave the office. After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, 21st Century Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.

In 2016, after he left Fox News, he became an adviser to Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, where he assisted with debate preparation.

== Personal life ==
Ailes was married three times. He married his second wife Norma Ferrer in 1980 after meeting while working together on the Mike Douglas Show. Ailes adopted Norma&#x27;s daughter Shawn Ferrer upon their marriage, walking Shawn down the aisle at her own first wedding to Alexander Visco on April 12, 2001. Norma and Roger were married until 1995. He married his third wife Elizabeth Tilson (born 1960) on February 14, 1998. Formerly a television executive, she was the owner and publisher of local New York state newspapers &quot;The Putnam County News &amp; Recorder&quot; and &quot;The Putnam County Courier&quot;. Roger Ailes had one son, named Zachary, with Tilson. The family resided in Garrison, New York, on a hilltop parcel in a home constructed of Adirondack river stone across the Hudson River from United States Military Academy at West Point. Ailes also had residences in Cresskill, New Jersey, and Palm Beach, Florida.
Ailes was a longtime friend of journalist and media personality Barbara Walters.

==Philanthropy==
=== Ohio University ===
In October 2007, Ailes donated to Ohio University for a renovated student newsroom. Ailes had majored in radio and television while at Ohio University and served two years as manager of the school&#x27;s radio station. Starting in 1994, he funded scholarships for Ohio University students in the school&#x27;s telecommunications programs.

=== Putnam County senior center ===
Ailes and his wife Elizabeth, through their charity, ACI Senior Development Corp., promised $500,000 toward the completion of a senior center in Cold Spring, Putnam County, New York. Local opposition to Ailes&#x27;s participation in the project arose after publication of the sexual harassment accusations against him and in response to a &quot;Journal News&quot; report about previously undisclosed conditions attached to the proposed gift. Under those conditions, ACI would act as general contractor for the project with no obligation to conduct competitive bidding before awarding construction management and other subcontracts.

Further, ACI was excused from any obligation to pay prevailing wages to workers on the project, workers and subcontractors would have no recourse against ACI in case of payment disputes and ACI would deliver its work without warranty. There was extensive public objection to Ailes&#x27;s participation. At an August 2, 2016 public hearing, the Putnam County Legislature suspended adoption of the proposed charitable donation agreement with ACI. The next day Ailes withdrew the gift.

== Death ==
In a 2013 book excerpt from &quot;Roger Ailes: Off Camera&quot;, Ailes spoke about facing death, saying, &quot;Because of my hemophilia, I&#x27;ve been prepared to face death all of my life. When it comes, I&#x27;ll be fine, calm. I&#x27;ll miss life, though. Especially my family.&quot;

On May 10, 2017, Ailes fell and hit his head at his Palm Beach, Florida, home. He died on May 18, three days after his 77th birthday, due to injuries from the fall. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner attributed his death to a subdural hematoma, aggravated by hemophilia. His wife, Elizabeth, announced his death in a statement on the &quot;Drudge Report&quot;.

George H. W. Bush, Rupert Murdoch, Sean Hannity, Bill Hemmer, Bret Baier, Geraldo Rivera, Laura Ingraham, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Jesse Jackson, Ainsley Earhardt, Shannon Bream, Al Sharpton, David Axelrod, Jeanine Pirro, Martha MacCallum, Newt Gingrich, and Lou Dobbs paid tribute to Ailes.

== In popular culture ==
In 2018, Ailes briefly appears in the Adam McKay film &quot;Vice&quot;.

In 2019, Russell Crowe portrayed Roger Ailes in Showtime&#x27;s limited series &quot;The Loudest Voice&quot; alongside Naomi Watts as Gretchen Carlson. Crowe won a Golden Globe for the performance.

The same year, John Lithgow received critical acclaim for playing Ailes in Jay Roach&#x27;s film &quot;Bombshell&quot;, also starring Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly and Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson.

<text>Loch Garten () is a large Highland freshwater loch near Boat of Garten, in the Strathspey area of the Cairngorms National Park, in Scotland. It is surrounded by the tall pine trees of the Abernethy Forest, a large area (adjacent to the loch) of which is an RSPB nature reserve. The loch is renowned for its breeding population of ospreys, which lend Boat of Garten its nickname &quot;The Osprey Village&quot;.

Careless behaviour towards the osprey in Britain throughout the 19th century meant that it became extinct as a breeding bird by the early 20th. However, in 1954 two Scandinavian breeding birds came to Garten completely of their own accord and set up a nest in the forest by the loch. Slowly the species recolonised Scotland (for more information see ospreys in Britain), and the RSPB and other organisations helped them along the way (not an easy task due to the illegal activities of egg collectors and other irresponsible people). The reserve was purchased by the charity and since then the nest has always been closely monitored. Recently a viewing hide was built relatively near to the nest so that visitors may come and see these birds of prey easily. The hide has telescopes and other optical devices inside, as well as television screens showing close-up views of the fledglings and their parents. Live video and still pictures of the nest can be viewed on the RSPB Loch Garten Reserve web-site.

Ospreys are not the only creatures to be found at Loch Garten. Western capercaillies, though difficult to see, do inhabit the remoter parts of the reserve and can be seen performing their annual lek via the spring &quot;Caperwatch&quot;. Red squirrels can be seen very easily around the hide, especially on the feeders put out for them. Smaller birds such as the Eurasian siskin, common chaffinch (in very large numbers) and great spotted woodpecker are also present and easy to spot on the feeders. The crested tit and Scottish crossbill are more reserved in their behaviour and more difficult to find. Eurasian wigeon live by and swim on the loch.

==Loch Garten Osprey Centre==

The Loch Garten Osprey Centre is a bird-watching facility on Loch Garten that focuses on the nest of two ospreys. It is an RSPB facility located in the Abernethy Forest. The Abernethy Forest RSPB reserve protects a habitat of Caledonian pine forest and in turn forms part of the wider Abernethy National Nature Reserve.

The birds return to the nesting site every year and the numerous binoculars and telescopes within the centre allow for effective bird watching. Visitors can also see red squirrels and other small birds feeding in front of the bird hide. A pair of ospreys have nested at the site every year from 1959 to 2019, although no chicks fledged there between 2016 and 2019. The tree which houses the nest died due to the droppings and remains of prey from the nesting birds, and in the winter of 2021 the nest (which was largely artificial) was relocated to a healthy Scots pine a few metres away. The tree canopy surrounding the nest was also lowered in an effort to make the nest site more appealing to ospreys. In 2022 a new pair of ospreys took over the new nest site and raised two young. Two chicks fledged in 2023.

The surrounding forest includes walking different paths passing by a large loch which is also known as Loch Mallachie. Some of the trails link up with the Speyside way.

<text>Snettisham RSPB reserve is a nature reserve in the care of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, situated near Snettisham in the county of Norfolk, England, north of King&#x27;s Lynn, and close to Sandringham. It faces The Wash, a large estuary. In autumn and winter, the big tides of the Wash pushes up hundreds of thousands of wading birds onto the Norfolk coast. The nature reserve&#x27;s bird lagoons provide a safe habitat for them.

Snettisham is unique in a couple of ways. It is rare in Norfolk that it is a beach facing West. However the unique geological nature of Snettisham is what attracts hundreds of thousands of migratory and transitory birds during the winter and autumn periods. High tides can push huge numbers of waders closer to where people can observe them.

During the year the bird population and diversity of what can be seen here will vary greatly, but species regularly seen here include little ringed plover, oystercatcher, golden plover, knot, bar-tailed godwit, sanderling, curlew, spotted redshank, pink-footed geese and peregrine falcon.

Snettisham pits were dug out during World War II in order to provide shingle that was used to build concrete runways as the American Bombers were too heavy to land on grass. The pits stretch for over 2.5 km and are split equally between the RSPB reserve and privately owned beach properties, including the Snettisham Beach Sailing Club.

Evidence of the operation is still visible today as the concrete roads made to transport the shingle are still used today by the residents to access their property. Whilst the roads are no longer used in the reserve, pieces of them line most of the length of the pits. One of the most distinctive landmarks left from the operation are the ruins of the jetty used to load the shingle on to boats so it could be transported across the country.

==Public Access==

There is a 2 km (approx) path to the reserve from the car park.

There is a circular walk around the reserve, with three hides. One, the &quot;Rotary Hide&quot;, was donated by the Rotary Clubs of East Anglia, and opened on 5 October 1997, by Bill Oddie.

This whole area 57.627 hectares are common land. Shingle collection rights belong to the inhabitants of Snettisham.

<text>Strumpshaw Fen is a nature reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It is situated at Strumpshaw on the River Yare in the English county of Norfolk around east of Norwich. The Buckenham Marshes RSPB reserve borders the reserve to the east.

The reserve is part of the Mid-Yare National Nature Reserve established in 1997 by English Nature (though managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds). It was purchased by the RSPB in 1974. It forms part of the Yare Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest and lies within the area of The Broads.

==Wildlife==

===Birds===
;Residents 
*Eurasian bittern; in spring, the male&#x27;s &#x27;booming&#x27; song can be heard. Though they are hard to see as they are well camouflaged. 
*Common kingfisher present all year and carrying fish back to nests in spring and summer.
*Western marsh harrier; in spring, pairs perform &#x27;sky-dancing&#x27; high in the sky. 
*Cetti&#x27;s warbler, the loudest British song bird with a distinctive (once learnt) &#x27;explosive&#x27; song. 
*Bearded tit, 
*Barn owl, they often nest in the woodlands and can be seen hunting at dawn and dusk
*Eurasian bullfinches
;Waterfowl include 
*Gadwall, 
*Great crested grebe and 
*Little grebes. 
;Summer migrants 
*Hobby, 
*Reed warbler, 
*Blackcap, 
*Common whitethroat.

==== Winter residents ====
* Hen Harrier
In autumn the reserve is visited by migrating birds both heading south and those seeking refuge from the Arctic winter. These often form large flocks in the winter that gathering to feed or at dusk flying off together to form large roosts. Waxwings sometimes visit in search of winter food from Scandinavia.

===Insects===

Its Fen provides one of the few breeding sites in Great Britain for the swallowtail. The subspecies found at Strumpshaw, &quot;Papilio machaon brittanicus&quot;, is endemic to the Fens of Norfolk and Suffolk in the UK. It is slightly smaller and more heavily marked in black than subspecies &quot;machaon&quot; and &quot;gorganus&quot; which are widespread throughout mainland Europe. It nearly always lays its eggs on milk parsley (&quot;Peucedanum palustre&quot;) in contrast to its European cousin that will select most umbellifers. Swallowtail can be seen from late May to mid-July and often again in mid-August to September. It is the largest resident British butterfly at 8 to 10 cm wingspan.

In early spring and summer the reserve is the habitat of 23 species of dragonfly, including the rare Norfolk hawker which is protected under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and listed in the British Red Data Books on Insects as Category 1 (endangered).

Another important dragon fly is the scarce chaser (&quot;Libellula fulva&quot;).

===Molluscs===
* Desmoulin&#x27;s whorl snail (On the list of endangered species in the British Isles)

===Plants===
It is one of only a handful of waterbodies in the country to contain holly-leaved naiad (&quot;Najas marina&quot;), a species on the flowering plant section of the list of endangered species in the British Isles and is protected under Schedule 8 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Other important plants are milk parsley, marsh pea, saw sedge, six varieties of orchids including the rare aquatic macrophytes.

Its flower hay meadow is an ecological relict with a high plant diversity due to the continuing centuries old practice of receiving only a cut in late season for a hay crop. In June it is coloured by yellow flag, marsh cinquefoil, bog bean, and ragged robin (a source of nectar for the adult swallowtails). In early July, there are common sorrel, the purple glass Yorkshire fog, southern marsh orchids, yellow rattle and valerian. These are followed by purple loosestrife and meadowsweet.

===Mammals===
* Eurasian otters
* Water voles
* Chinese water deer

==Seasonal changes==

===Winter===
* Hundreds of ducks, including teals, gadwalls and shovelers gather to feed in the reedbed pools. 
* Near dusk, marsh and hen harriers gather to roost. 
* On occasional winters, thousands of starlings roost in the reeds attracting sparrowhawks, peregrines and merlins.

===Spring===
* Courting pairs of marsh harriers perform &#x27;sky-dancing&#x27; displays. 
* Songs of spring migrant birds including reed and sedge warblers, cuckoos, grasshopper warblers and white throats. 
* Swallows and swifts dart across the pools
* Great crested grebes and other waterfowl prepare their nests. 
* Lesser spotted and great spotted woodpeckers easily heard drumming in the woodland.
* Booming bitterns can be heard from across the reserve, in 2017, there were up to 3 booming male bitterns on the reserve

===Summer===
* The UK&#x27;s largest and one of its rarest butterflies, the swallowtail emerges at this time, remaining on the wing through to July 
* Fen meadow rich with flowers including six species of orchids. 
* Many butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies including swallowtail butterfly (late May to early July and again in mid-August).
* Hobbies hunt dragonflies.

===Autumn===
* Ospreys on their southward migration fish. 
* Marsh harriers gather in groups to roost. 
* Bearded tits form flocks in the reedbeds.

==Management==

The reserve contains several types of habitats including reed beds, grazing marshes, wet woodland, fen orchid-rich meadows, and the River Yare. These are managed through traditional techniques, including reed-cutting, mowing, cattle grazing and scrub removal.

When purchased in 1976, it was in a state of being heavily overgrown. Since then considerable effects have been made to restoring it to the open fen landscape of the 19th Century. Initially, this involved breaking up vegetation with high pressure jets and pumping out mud to recreate the broad. Ongoing restoration work presently includes scrub and invasive plants removal and repair of disused ditches.

Reed bed and fen meadow management includes summer mowing and grazing, seasonal flooding, maintaining water levels, clearing rushes, grazing and mowing, and trampling with livestock to create boggy ground. Wet woodland management includes protecting standing dead wood and keep water levels high from April to July.

The reserve contains the largest area of hay meadow in East Anglia that has remained untouched except for a late hay crop - a practice crucial to the maintenance of its plant diversity.

==Facilities==
There are several hides and a number of trails.

The reserve is open from dawn until dusk every day (except Christmas Day). There are entrance charges (except for RSPB members). Some parts of trails after rain or river flooding can be muddy or wet so may require wearing walking boots.

== Pumping house ==

The fens at Strumpshaw were originally drained by a 1700s wind pump. In the late 1800s, this was replaced by a steam powered pump, whose brick-built engine house and free-standing brick chimney, alongside the river, remain. Nowadays, electric pumps are used.

<text>Richard Erskine Frere Leakey (19 December 1944 – 2 January 2022) was a Kenyan paleoanthropologist, conservationist and politician. Leakey held a number of official positions in Kenya, mostly in institutions of archaeology and wildlife conservation. He was Director of the National Museum of Kenya, founded the NGO WildlifeDirect, and was the chairman of the Kenya Wildlife Service. Leakey served in the powerful office of cabinet secretary and head of public service during the tail end of President Daniel Toroitich Arap Moi&#x27;s government.

Leakey co-founded the &quot;Turkana Basin Institute&quot; in an academic partnership with Stony Brook University, where he was an anthropology professor. He served as the chair of the Turkana Basin Institute until his death.

==Early life==
===Earliest years===
Richard Erskine Frere Leakey was born on 19 December 1944 in Nairobi. As a small boy, Leakey lived in Nairobi with his parents: Louis Leakey, curator of the Coryndon Museum, and Mary Leakey, director of the Leakey excavations at Olduvai, and his two brothers, Jonathan and Philip. The Leakey brothers had a very active childhood. All the boys had ponies and belonged to the Langata Pony Club. Sometimes the whole club were guests at the Leakeys&#x27; for holidays and vacations. Leakey&#x27;s parents founded the Dalmatian Club of East Africa and won a prize in 1957. Dogs and many other pets shared the Leakey home. The Leakey boys participated in games conducted by both adults and children, in which they tried to imitate early humans, catching springhare and small antelope by hand on the Serengeti. They drove lions and jackals from the kill to see if they could do it.

===Fractured skull===
In 1956, aged eleven, Leakey fell from his horse, fracturing his skull and nearly dying as a result. Incidentally, it was this incident that saved his parents&#x27; marriage. Louis was seriously considering leaving Mary for his secretary, Rosalie Osborn. As the battle with Mary raged in the household, Leakey begged his father from his sickbed not to leave. That was the deciding factor. Louis broke up with Rosalie and the family lived in happy harmony for a few years more.

===Teenage entrepreneur===
Leakey chose to support himself, borrowed £500 from his parents for a Land Rover and went into the trapping and skeleton supply business with Kamoya Kimeu. Already a skilled horseman, outdoorsman, Land Rover mechanic, amateur archaeologist, and expedition leader, he learned to identify bones, skills which all pointed to a path he did not yet wish to take, simply because his father was on it.

The bone business turned into a safari business in 1961. In 1962, he obtained a private pilot licence and took tours to the Olduvai Gorge. It was from a casual aerial survey that he noted the potential of Lake Natron&#x27;s shores for palaeontology. He went looking for fossils in a Land Rover, but could find none, until his parents assigned Glynn Isaac to go with him. Louis was so impressed with their finds that he gave them National Geographic money for a month&#x27;s expedition. They explored in the vicinity of Peninj near the lake, where Leakey was in charge of the administrative details. Bored, he returned to Nairobi temporarily, but at that moment, Kamoya Kimeu discovered a fossil of &quot;Australopithecus boisei&quot;. A second expedition left Leakey feeling that he was being excluded from the most significant part of the operation, the scientific analysis.

===Marriage===
In 1964, on his second Lake Natron expedition, Leakey met an archaeologist named Margaret Cropper. When Margaret returned to England, Leakey decided to follow suit to study for a degree and become better acquainted with her. He completed his high school requirements in six months; meanwhile Margaret obtained her degree at the University of Edinburgh. He passed the entrance exams for admission to college, but in 1965 he and Margaret decided to marry and return to Kenya. His father offered him a job at Centre for Prehistory and Palaeontology. He worked excavating at Lake Baringo and continued his photographic safari business, making enough money to buy a house in Karen, a pleasant suburb of Nairobi. Their daughter Anna was born in 1969, the same year that Leakey and Margaret divorced. He married his colleague Meave Epps in 1970 and they had two daughters, Louise (born 1972) and Samira (1974).

== Palaeontology ==
Richard formed the Kenya Museum Associates (now Kenya Museum Society) with influential Kenyans in 1955. They aimed to &quot;Kenyanise&quot; and improve the National Museum. They offered the museum £5000, one-third of its yearly budget, if it would place Leakey in a responsible position, and he became an observer on the board of directors. Joel Ojal, the government official in charge of the museum, and a member of the Associates, directed the chairman of the board to start placing Kenyans on it.

===The Omo===
Plans for the museum had not matured when Louis, intentionally or not, found a way to remove his confrontational son from the scene. Louis attended a lunch with Emperor Haile Selassie and President Jomo Kenyatta. The conversation turned to fossils, and the Emperor wanted to know why none had been found in Ethiopia. Louis developed this inquiry into permission to excavate on the Omo River.

The expedition consisted of three contingents: French, under Camille Arambourg, American, under F. Clark Howell, and Kenyan, led by Richard. Louis could not go because of his arthritis. Crossing the Omo in 1967, Leakey&#x27;s contingent was attacked by crocodiles, which destroyed their wooden boat. Expedition members barely escaped with their lives. Richard radioed Louis for a new, aluminium boat, which the National Geographic Society was happy to supply.

On site, Kamoya Kimeu found a hominid fossil. Leakey took it to be &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, but Louis identified it as &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. It was the oldest of the species found at that time, dating to 160,000 years, and was the first find contemporaneous with &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;. During the identification process, Leakey came to feel that the college men were patronising him.

===Koobi Fora===
During the Omo expedition of 1967, Leakey visited Nairobi and on the return flight the pilot flew over Lake Rudolph (renamed Lake Turkana from 1975) to avoid a thunderstorm. The map led Leakey to expect volcanic rock below him but he saw sediments. Visiting the region with Howell by helicopter, he saw tools and fossils everywhere. In his mind, he started formulating a new enterprise.

In 1968 Louis and Richard attended a meeting of the Research and Exploration Committee of the National Geographic Society to ask for money for Omo. Catching Louis by surprise, Richard asked the committee to divert the $25,000 intended for Omo to new excavations to be conducted under his leadership at Koobi Fora. Richard won, but chairman Leonard Carmichael told him he&#x27;d better find something or never &quot;come begging at our door again&quot;. Louis graciously congratulated Richard.

By that time the board of the National Museum was packed with Kenyan supporters of Richard. They appointed him administrative director. The curator, Robert Carcasson, resigned in protest, and Leakey was left with the museum at his command, which he, like Louis before him, used as a base of operations. Although there was friendly rivalry and contention between Louis and Richard, relations remained good. Each took over for the other when one was busy with something else or incapacitated, and Richard continued to inform his father immediately of hominid finds.

In the first expedition to Allia Bay on Lake Turkana, where the Koobi Fora camp came to be located, Leakey hired primarily young researchers. The students included John Harris and Bernard Wood. Also present was a team of Africans under Kamoya: a geochemist, Paul Abel, and a photographer, Bob Campbell. Margaret was the archaeologist. In contrast to his father, Richard ran a disciplined and tidy camp, although, in order to find fossils, he did push the expedition harder than it wished.

In 1969 the discovery of a cranium of &quot;Paranthropus boisei&quot; caused great excitement. A &quot;Homo rudolfensis&quot; skull (KNM ER 1470) and a &quot;Homo erectus&quot; skull (KNM ER 3733), discovered in 1972 and 1975, respectively, were among the most significant finds of Leakey&#x27;s earlier expeditions. In 1978 an intact cranium of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (KNM ER 3883) was discovered.

Donald Johanson and Leakey held different views about human evolution. They held a debate on &quot;Cronkite&#x27;s Universe&quot;, a talk show hosted by Walter Cronkite, in 1981.

===West Turkana===

Turkana Boy, discovered by Kamoya Kimeu, a member of the Leakeys&#x27; team, in 1984, was the nearly complete skeleton of a &quot;Homo ergaster&quot; (though some, including Leakey, call it &quot;erectus&quot;) who died 1.6 million years ago at about age 9–12. Leakey and Roger Lewin describe the experience of this find and their interpretation of it, in their book &quot;Origins Reconsidered&quot; (1992). Shortly after the discovery of Turkana Boy, Leakey and his team made the discovery of a skull (KNM WT 17000, known as &quot;Black Skull&quot;) of a new species, &quot;Australopithecus aethiopicus&quot; (or &quot;Paranthropus aethiopicus&quot;).

Richard shifted away from palaeontology in 1989, but his wife Meave Leakey and daughter Louise Leakey continue to conduct palaeontological research in Northern Kenya.

== Conservation ==

In 1989 Richard Leakey was appointed the head of the Wildlife Conservation and Management Department (WMCD) by President Daniel Arap Moi in response to the international outcry over the poaching of elephants and the impact it was having on the wildlife of Kenya. The department was replaced by the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) in 1990, and Leakey became its first chairman. With characteristically bold steps Leakey created special, well-armed anti-poaching units that were authorised to shoot poachers on sight. The poaching menace was dramatically reduced. Impressed by Leakey&#x27;s transformation of the Kenya Wildlife Service, the World Bank approved grants worth $140 million. Richard Leakey, President Moi, and the WMCD made the international news headlines when a stockpile of 12 tons of ivory was burned in 1989 in Nairobi National Park.
Richard Leakey&#x27;s confrontational approach to the issue of human–wildlife conflict in national parks did not win him friends. His view was that parks were self-contained ecosystems that had to be fenced in and the humans kept out. Leakey&#x27;s bold and incorruptible nature also offended many local politicians.

In 2016, Leakey was named Conservationist of the Year by The Perfect World Foundation and won &quot;The Fragile Rhino&quot; prize at the Elephant Ball in Gothenburg, Sweden.

===Plane crash===
In 1993, a small propeller-driven plane piloted by Richard Leakey crashed, crushing his lower legs, both of which were later amputated. Sabotage was suspected but never proven. While in the hospital, Leakey told President Moi, a religious man, not to pray for him, but act on matters pending for the Kenya Wildlife Service. Thereafter, Richard Leakey walked on artificial limbs. Around this time the Kenyan government announced that a secret probe had found evidence of corruption and mismanagement in the Kenya Wildlife Service. An annoyed Leakey resigned publicly in a press conference in January 1994. He was replaced by David Western as the head of the Kenya Wildlife Service.

Richard Leakey wrote about his experiences at the Kenya Wildlife Service in his book &quot;Wildlife Wars: My Fight to Save Africa&#x27;s Natural Treasures&quot; (2001).

== Politics ==

In May 1995, Richard Leakey joined some Kenyan intellectuals in launching a new political party – the Safina Party, which in Swahili means &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;. The Safina party was routinely harassed and even its application to become an official political party was not approved until 1997.
In 1997, international donor institutions froze their aid to Kenya because of widespread corruption. To placate the donors, Moi appointed Richard Leakey as Cabinet Secretary and head of the civil service in 1999. Leakey&#x27;s second stint in the civil service lasted two years. He sacked 25,000 civil servants and obtained £250 million of funds from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, Leakey found himself sidelined after the money arrived, and his reforms were blocked in the courts. He was sacked from his cabinet post in 2001.

== United States ==
Leakey left Kenya for the U.S. in 2002 and became a professor of anthropology at Stony Brook University, New York. He was also Chair of the Turkana Basin Institute. In 2004, Leakey founded and chaired WildlifeDirect, a Kenya-based charitable organisation. The charity was established to provide support to conservationists in Africa directly on the ground via the use of blogs. This enables individuals anywhere to play a direct and interactive role in the survival of some of the world&#x27;s most precious species. The organisation played a significant role in the saving of the Democratic Republic of Congo&#x27;s mountain gorillas in Virunga National Park in January 2007 after a rebel uprising threatened to eliminate the highly vulnerable population.

In April 2007, he was appointed interim chairman of Transparency International&#x27;s Kenya branch. The same year, Leakey was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In June 2013, Leakey was awarded the Isaac Asimov Science Award from the American Humanist Association.

== Contribution/Service ==
Leakey&#x27;s groundbreaking work contributed to the recognition of Africa as the birthplace of humankind, that contributed as evidence that the earliest humans had lived on the African continent. He was known to have spearheaded campaigns to stop poaching in Kenya. Aside his contributions to Public Service, he was known to have contributed immensely to the Civil Service; &quot;Besides his distinguished career in public service, Dr Leakey is celebrated for his prominent role in Kenya&#x27;s civil society where he founded and successfully ran a number of institutions,&quot; Mr Kenyatta said.

== Return to Kenya ==

In 2015, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Leakey chairman of the board of the Kenya Wildlife Service. Although he was chairman rather than director, Leakey played an active role in KWS policies. He brokered a deal on the extension of the Mombasa–Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway, allowing the railway to pass over Nairobi National Park on an 18 m tall viaduct. Leakey felt that the viaduct would set an example for the rest of Africa in balancing economic development with environmental protection. However, other Kenyan conservationists have opposed railway construction in the park.

Angelina Jolie was to direct a film about Leakey&#x27;s life, with Leakey in early 2016 expressing his confidence that the film would be shot in Kenya.

==Personal life and death==
Leakey spoke fluent Kiswahili and moved effortlessly between white and black communities. While he rarely talked about race in public, racism and gender inequality infuriated him. Leakey stated that he was an atheist and a humanist. 

Leakey came from a family of renowned archeologists. His mother, Mary Leakey, discovered evidence in 1978 that man walked upright much earlier than had been thought. She and her husband, Louis Leakey, unearthed skulls of ape-like early humans, shedding fresh light on our ancestors.

Leakey was diagnosed with a terminal kidney disease in 1969. Ten years later he became seriously ill but received a kidney transplant from his brother, Philip, and recovered to full health.

He died at his home outside Nairobi, on 2 January 2022, less than a month after his 77th birthday. In accordance with his wishes, he was buried on a hill along the Rift Valley.

<doc id="149163" wikidata="Q4482992" url="?curid=149163" title="Polyface Farm">
<text>Polyface Farm is a farm located in rural Swoope, Virginia, run by Joel Salatin and his family. The farm is driven using unconventional methods with the goal of &quot;emotionally, economically and environmentally enhancing agriculture&quot;. This farm is where Salatin developed and put into practice many of his most significant agricultural methods. These include direct marketing of meats and produce to consumers, pastured-poultry, grass-fed beef and the rotation method which makes his farm more like an ecological system than conventional farming. Polyface Farm operates a farm store on-site where consumers go to pick up their products.

==Practices and background==

Salatin encourages people to buy locally to save small businesses. Salatin believes it is advantageous for consumers to know their farmers and where their food comes from.

Salatin says that his Christian faith informs how he raises and slaughters the animals on his farm. He sees it as his responsibility to honour the animals as creatures that reflect God&#x27;s love and believes his method is to honour that of God. Salatin is quoted in the book &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; as justifying the killing of animals for meat because &quot;people have a soul, animals don&#x27;t...When they die, they die.&quot;

Salatin bases his farm&#x27;s ecosystem on the principle of observing animals&#x27; activities in nature and emulating those conditions as closely as possible. Salatin grazes his cattle outdoors within small pastures enclosed by electrified fencing that is easily moved each evening in an established rotational grazing system. Animal manure fertilizes the pastures and enables Polyface Farm to graze about four times as many cattle as on a conventional farm, thus also saving feed costs. The small size of the pastures forces the cattle to &quot;mob stock&quot;, or to eat all the grass.

Polyface raises cattle, pastured meat chickens, egg layers, pigs, turkeys, and rabbits. The diversity in production better utilizes the grass, breaks pathogen cycles, and creates multiple income streams. The meat chickens are housed in portable field shelters that are moved daily to a fresh &quot;salad bar&quot; of new grass and away from yesterday&#x27;s droppings. All manure is distributed by the chickens directly onto the field. His egg-laying chickens are housed in mobile trailer-style coops (called &quot;eggmobiles&quot;) that follow four days after the cattle when flies in the manure are pupating; the chickens get 15% of their feed from this. While scratching for pupae, the chickens also distribute the cow manure across the field. 

Salatin feels that &quot;if you smell manure [on a livestock farm], you are smelling mismanagement.&quot; So everything possible is done to allow grass to absorb all the fertilizer left behind by the animals. If animals must be kept inside (to brood young chicks for example), Salatin recommends providing deep bedding of wood chips or sawdust to lock in all the nutrients and smell until they can be spread on the field where the compost can be used by the grass.

Salatin&#x27;s pastures, barn, and farmhouse are located on land below a nearby pond that &quot;feeds the farm&quot; by using of piping. Salatin also harvests of woodlands and uses the lumber to construct farm buildings. One of Salatin&#x27;s principles is that &quot;plants and animals should be provided a habitat that allows them to express their physiological distinctiveness. Respecting and honouring the bigness of the pig is a foundation for societal health.&quot;

While Salatin does not sell to supermarkets or ship long distances, Polyface products are available at restaurants (including Chipotle and Staunton&#x27;s Zynodoa) and local food sellers within a half-days drive of the farm.

==Media==
Polyface Farm was featured in the book &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; by Michael Pollan as exemplary sustainable agriculture, contrasting Polyface Farm favorably to factory farming. An excerpt of the book was published in the May/June 2006 issue of &quot;Mother Jones&quot;. Pollan&#x27;s book describes Polyface Farm&#x27;s method of sustainable agriculture as being built on the efficiencies that come from mimicking relationships found in nature and layering one farm enterprise over another on the same base of land. In effect, Joel is farming in time as well as in space—in four dimensions rather than three. He calls this intricate layering &quot;stacking&quot; and points out that &quot;it is exactly the model God used in building nature.&quot; &quot;The idea is not to slavishly imitate nature, but to model a natural ecosystem in all its diversity and interdependence, one where all the species &quot;fully express their physiological distinctiveness.&quot;

The farm is covered in the August/September 2008 issue of &quot;Mother Earth News&quot;.

The farm is also featured in the documentary films &quot;Food, Inc.&quot; and &quot;Fresh&quot; as well as in episode 3 of the BBC documentary series &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Global Harvest&quot;.

Polyface Farm is a participant in Humane Farm Animal Care&#x27;s Certified Humane Raised and Handled program.

Salatin and his farm was the main topic of the documentary Polyfaces.

==Criticism==

Salatin is criticized by poultry farmer Frank Reese in Jonathan Safran Foer&#x27;s book &quot;Eating Animals&quot; for raising industrial birds, not heritage birds. Reese says of Polyface, &quot;Joel Salatin is doing industrial birds. Call him up and ask him. So he puts them on pasture. It makes no difference. It&#x27;s like putting a broken-down Honda on the autobahn and saying it&#x27;s a Porsche.&quot; Salatin maintains that this statement is not entirely true. Polyface uses heritage breeds for its egg production. However, for meat birds Salatin uses the Cornish cross, the same type of bird used in the industrial system. Salatin candidly admits in his book, &quot;The Sheer Ecstasy of Being a Lunatic Farmer&quot;, that the meat bird operation is currently the least sustainable aspect of the farm. Salatin goes on to say that he looks forward to the day that customers are willing to buy (and he is able to raise) a non-industrial meat bird. Reese&#x27;s critique also aims at Michael Pollan&#x27;s view in his book &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; that depicts the farming principles of Polyface as exemplary and sustainable. Salatin confirmed, in an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;, that he raises non-heritage breed chickens. He explained that he had raised heritage birds for several years, but the poultry from these birds had gained little interest from consumers, and was therefore not economically viable for him.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; in their article &quot;Let Them Eat Acorns&quot; quotes unspecified, uncited and unknown individuals: &quot;Some say he is cheating the notion of sustainability by feeding his pigs grain that he does not grow himself. Others contend that confinement operations are the only practical way to feed the world, and that pastured animals do more damage to the environment than is acknowledged in this farm-to-table era.&quot;

After Polyface&#x27;s 2019 growing season, a website went live that claimed to be run by the season&#x27;s former interns, it is entitled &quot;One Experience of Many.&quot; The website includes both positive and negative reviews of the farm and the family who run it, the reviewers all discuss substandard housing, which is alleged to include known negligence of water quality standards and the poisoning of 10 out of 11 interns. One of the reviewers, Emma, reports two hospital visits due to a bacterial infection from their housing&#x27;s water supply including a diagnosis of campylobacteriosis. The interns&#x27; allegations also include crude and manipulative behavior on the part of farm ownership and management, along with low pay and little educational value.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Polyface Farm repeatedly violated COVID-19 pandemic protocols by holding various gatherings. Salatin regularly expressed in his blog &quot;Musings from The Lunatic Farmer&quot; that he believes that COVID is not a danger and that it should not be taken so seriously. He implied that 5G may be the true cause of COVID. In March of 2020, he wrote: &quot;Okay folks, enough is enough. I want coronavirus. I&#x27;ve been watching all the personal stories of the folks who have gotten it and the overwhelming testimony is pretty simple: a day of sniffles, another day of fatigue, then a couple of days of recovery, and life is back to normal.&quot; While criticism of Joel Salatin and Polyface for minimizing COVID-19&#x27;s impact were widespread the farm continued to host large and mostly maskless events well into the fall of 2020.

<doc id="149167" wikidata="Q3415041" url="?curid=149167" title="RAF Kenley">
<text>Royal Air Force Kenley, more commonly known as RAF Kenley, is a former station of the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and the RAF in the Second World War. It played a significant role during the Battle of Britain as one of the three RAF stations specifically tasked with the defence of London. It is located near Kenley on the edge of Greater London. The site remains in use with the Ministry of Defence, as Kenley Airfield.

==History==
RAF Kenley was a frontline operation military airfield between 1917 and 1959 when RAF Fighter Command left the aerodrome. originally built for the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War it radically rebuilt in August 1939 in preparation for future operation of new aircraft, such as the Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire and Bristol Blenheim. Unsuitable hangars from the First World War were demolished, and two concrete runways were built, plus perimeter track, blast pens, increased storage for fuels and oils, and a dedicated armoury. Construction was largely completed in early 1940.

===Second World War===

RAF Kenley was one of the three main fighter stations (Kenley, Croydon and Biggin Hill) responsible for the air defence of London during the Battle of Britain in 1940. 

RAF Kenley suffered its worst damage in an attack on 18 August 1940. While 15 September is considered by many to be the climax of the Battle of Britain, 18 August is often cited as the costliest or hardest day – the British lost 68 aircraft and the Germans lost 69. At Kenley, two of the remaining three hangars (three had been removed in 1939), other buildings and ten aircraft, including six Hurricanes, were destroyed, while six more, including a Spitfire and two Hurricanes, were damaged. The runways were also heavily cratered by the bombing. The Sector Operations Room had to be moved to an emergency location away from the airfield.

Hammond Innes&#x27; book &quot;Attack Alarm&quot;, published in 1941, was based on his experiences as a Royal Artillery anti-aircraft gunner at RAF Kenley during the Battle of Britain. Innes&#x27; novels are marked by attention to accurate detail and the book contains graphic descriptions of the station and attacks on it in 1940.

===Squadrons===

The following units were based at RAF Kenley:
;Other units:
===Pilots===

Many famous pilots served at Kenley, including the famous South African fighter ace &#x27;Sailor&#x27; Malan, Group Captain P. H. &#x27;Dutch&#x27; Hugo, C. W. A. Scott (winner of the MacRobertson Air Race) who served there with No. 32 Squadron RAF from 1923 to 1926, and the British ace JE &quot;Johnnie&quot; Johnson, later Air Vice-Marshal, who took over the Canadian wing at Kenley in 1943. 
P/O Arthur Gerald Donahue, 64 Squadron, flew out of Kenley. Donahue was from St. Charles, Minnesota, USA, and was one of seven Americans to fly and fight in the Battle of Britain. He was shot down 13 August 1940, and suffered burns but later returned to service. Donahue described his experiences in the book, &quot;Tally Ho! Yankee in a Spitfire&quot; published by Macmillan in 1941.

==Post war==

Although few of the remaining buildings survive and the control tower was demolished after a fire in 1978 along with the remaining hangar, Kenley is thought to be the best preserved of all Second World War RAF fighter stations, with the runway still in its original configuration. English Heritage (in 2000) identified Kenley as &quot;The most complete fighter airfield associated with the Battle of Britain to have survived&quot;. The respective councils of Croydon and Tandridge have designated the airfield site as a conservation area (2006).

The south-west corner, previously occupied by married quarters, has been redeveloped with modern high-density housing directly abutting the airfield (the area was excluded from the Green Belt as part of the Tandridge District Local Plan and thus not included within the conservation area). In December 2005, the Grade II Listed former officers&#x27; mess building and surrounding land was sold to residential building developer, Comer Homes, and having more recently suffered a fire and vandalism, its future is uncertain as is that of the Royal Air Forces Association (RAFA) Portcullis Club.

Eleven of the original 12 E-shaped blast pens remain in part or whole, as well as the shelters for the servicing personnel. One in particular – forming the background to the RAF memorial – has been fully restored. Since 2004 these structures are protected as scheduled monuments.

Part of the former air station is preserved as a tribute to the service personnel of the Commonwealth and Allied fighter squadrons who shared the honours with the RAF. In a former aircraft parking area in one of the blast pens a memorial was unveiled on 19mAugust 2000. Dedicated to the Royal Air Force and allied air forces, the inscription reads &quot;RAF Kenley Tribute in Honour of All Personnel Who Served Here 1917–1959&quot;.

The aerodrome was used as a location in
&quot;Angels One Five&quot; (1952) and &quot;Reach for the Sky&quot; (1956), the latter about Douglas Bader who was posted to RAF Kenley in 1930 No. 23 Squadron RAF shortly before his accident in 1931.

==Current usage==

RAF Kenley now hosts 615 Volunteer Gliding Squadron, a Unit within the RAF 2 Flying Training School (2 FTS). RAF Kenley is classed as a government aerodrome and is regulated by the Military Aviation Authority (MAA); as such, all flying operations are governed by military regulations and safety standards. An aerodrome operator (AO) is appointed in accordance with MAA regulations, whose role is to actively manage the aerodrome environment to ensure it is safe for the operation of aircraft, and is the focal point for all aerodrome activity. However this function is undertaken remotely by an individual within the HQ of 2 FTS at RAF Syerston.

At the foot of the memorial is inscribed the war-time quote commemorating the Battle of Britain &quot;Never in the field of human conflict, has so much been owed by so many to so few – Winston Churchill 1942.&quot;

The airfield is next to the HQ of 450 Kenley Air Cadets.

The airfield is still in use by the Ministry of Defence and Surrey Hills Gliding Club for glider aircraft; however, the use of powered aircraft is currently prohibited.

<text>Tigran Vardani Petrosian (; ; 17 June 1929 – 13 August 1984) was a Soviet-Armenian chess grandmaster and the ninth World Chess Champion from 1963 to 1969. He was nicknamed &quot;Iron Tigran&quot; due to his almost-impenetrable defensive playing style, which emphasized safety above all else. Petrosian is often credited with popularizing chess in Armenia.

Petrosian was a candidate for the World Chess Championship on eight occasions (1953, 1956, 1959, 1962, 1971, 1974, 1977 and 1980). He won the World Championship in 1963 (against Mikhail Botvinnik), successfully defended it in 1966 (against Boris Spassky), and lost it to Spassky in 1969. Thus he was the defending World Champion or a World Championship Candidate in ten consecutive three-year cycles. He won the Soviet Championship four times (1959, 1961, 1969, and 1975).

== Early life ==
Petrosian was born to Armenian parents on 17 June 1929, in Tbilisi, Georgian SSR (present-day Georgia). As a young boy, Petrosian was an excellent student and enjoyed studying, as did his brother Hmayak and sister Vartoosh. He learned to play chess at the age of 8, though his illiterate father Vartan encouraged him to continue studying, as he thought chess was unlikely to bring his son any success as a career. Petrosian was orphaned during World War II and was forced to sweep streets to earn a living. Around this time, his hearing began to deteriorate, a problem that continued to affect him throughout his life. In a 1969 interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine, he recalled:
Petrosian used his rations to buy &quot;Chess Praxis&quot; by Danish grandmaster Aron Nimzowitsch, the book which Petrosian later stated had the greatest influence on him as a chess player. He also purchased &quot;The Art of Sacrifice in Chess&quot; by Rudolf Spielmann. The other player to have had an early effect on Petrosian&#x27;s chess was José Raúl Capablanca. At the age of 12 he began training at the Tiflis Palace of Pioneers under the tutelage of Archil Ebralidze. Ebralidze was a supporter of Nimzowitsch and Capablanca, and his scientific approach to chess discouraged wild tactics and dubious combinations. As a result, Petrosian developed a repertoire of solid positional openings, such as the Caro–Kann Defence. After training at the Palace of Pioneers for just one year, he defeated visiting Soviet grandmaster Salo Flohr at a simultaneous exhibition.

By 1946, Petrosian had earned the title of Candidate Master. In that year alone, he drew against Grandmaster Paul Keres at the Georgian Chess Championship, then moved to Yerevan where he won the Armenian Chess Championship and the USSR Junior Chess Championship. Petrosian earned the title of Master during the 1947 USSR Chess Championship, though he failed to qualify for the finals. He set about improving his game by studying Nimzowitsch&#x27;s &quot;My System&quot; and by moving to Moscow to seek greater competition.

== Grandmaster in Moscow ==
After moving to Moscow in 1949, Petrosian&#x27;s career as a chess player advanced rapidly and his results in Soviet events steadily improved. He placed second in the 1951 Soviet Championship, thereby earning the title of international master. It was in this tournament that Petrosian faced world champion Botvinnik for the first time. Playing White, after obtaining a slightly inferior position from the opening, he defended through two adjournments and eleven total hours of play to obtain a draw. Petrosian&#x27;s result in this event qualified him for the Interzonal the following year in Stockholm. He earned the title of Grandmaster by coming in second in the Stockholm tournament, and qualified for the 1953 Candidates Tournament.

Petrosian placed fifth in the 1953 Candidates Tournament, a result which marked the beginning of a stagnant period in his career. He seemed content drawing against weaker players and maintaining his title of Grandmaster rather than improving his chess or making an attempt at becoming World Champion. This attitude was illustrated by his result in the 1955 USSR Championship: out of 19 games played, Petrosian was undefeated, but won only four games and drew the rest, with each of the draws lasting twenty moves or less. Although his consistent playing ensured decent tournament results, it was looked down upon by the public and by Soviet chess media and authorities. Near the end of the event, journalist Vasily Panov wrote the following comment about the tournament contenders: &quot;Real chances of victory, besides Botvinnik and Smyslov, up to round 15, are held by Geller, Spassky and Taimanov. I deliberately exclude Petrosian from the group, since from the very first rounds the latter has made it clear that he is playing for an easier, but also honourable conquest—a place in the interzonal quartet.&quot;

This period of complacency ended with the 1957 USSR Championship, where out of 21 games played, Petrosian won seven, lost four, and drew the remaining 10. Although this result was only good enough for seventh place in a field of 22 competitors, his more ambitious approach to tournament play was met with great appreciation from the Soviet chess community. He went on to win his first USSR Championship in 1959, and later that year in the Candidates Tournament he defeated Paul Keres with a display of his often-overlooked tactical abilities. Petrosian was awarded the title of Master of Sport of the USSR in 1960, and won a second Soviet title in 1961. His excellent playing continued through 1962 when he qualified for the Candidates Tournament for what would be his first World Championship match.

== 1963 World Championship ==

After playing in the 1962 Interzonal in Stockholm, Petrosian qualified for the Candidates Tournament in Curaçao along with Pal Benko, Miroslav Filip, Bobby Fischer, Efim Geller, Paul Keres, Viktor Korchnoi, and Mikhail Tal. Petrosian, representing the Soviet Union, won the tournament with a final score of 17½ points, followed by fellow Soviet players Geller and Keres, each with 17 points and the American Fischer with 14. Fischer later accused the Soviet players of arranging draws and having &quot;ganged up&quot; on him to prevent him from winning the tournament. As evidence for this claim, he noted that all 12 games played between Petrosian, Geller, and Keres were draws. Statisticians pointed out that when playing against each other, these Soviet competitors averaged 19 moves per game, as opposed to 39.5 moves when playing against other competitors. Although responses to Fischer&#x27;s allegations were mixed, FIDE later adjusted the rules and format to try to prevent future collusion in the Candidates.

Having won the Candidates Tournament, Petrosian earned the right to challenge Mikhail Botvinnik for the title of World Chess Champion in a 24-game match. In addition to practicing his chess, Petrosian also prepared for the match by skiing for several hours each day. He believed that in such a long match, physical fitness and endurance could become a factor in the later games. This advantage was increased by Botvinnik being much older than Petrosian. Whereas a multitude of draws in tournament play could prevent a player from taking first place, draws did not affect the outcome of a one-on-one match. In this regard, Petrosian&#x27;s cautious playing style was well-suited for match play, as he could simply wait for his opponent to make mistakes and then capitalize on them. Petrosian won the match against Botvinnik with a final score of 5 to 2 with 15 draws, securing the title of World Champion.

== Reigning World Champion ==

Upon becoming World Champion, Petrosian campaigned for the publication of a chess newspaper for the entire Soviet Union, rather than just in Moscow. This newspaper became known as &quot;64&quot;. Petrosian studied for a degree of Master of Philosophical Science at Yerevan State University; his thesis, dated 1968, was titled &quot;Chess Logic, Some Problems of the Logic of Chess Thought&quot;.

In 1966, three years after Petrosian had earned the title of World Chess Champion, he was challenged by Boris Spassky. Petrosian defended his title by winning rather than drawing the match, a feat that had not been accomplished since Alexander Alekhine defeated Efim Bogoljubov in the 1934 World Championship. However, Spassky defeated Efim Geller, Bent Larsen, and Viktor Korchnoi in the next candidates cycle, earning a rematch with Petrosian, in 1969. Spassky won the match by 12½–10½.

== Later career ==

Along with a number of other Soviet chess champions, he signed a petition condemning the actions of the defector Viktor Korchnoi in 1976. It was the continuation of a bitter feud between the two, dating back at least to their 1974 Candidates semifinal match in which Petrosian withdrew after five games while trailing 1½–3½ (+1−3=1). His match with Korchnoi in 1977 saw the two former colleagues refuse to shake hands or speak to each other. They even demanded separate eating and toilet facilities. Petrosian lost the match, and was fired from his position as editor of Russia&#x27;s largest chess magazine, &quot;64&quot;. His detractors condemned his reluctance to attack, with some attributing this to a lack of courage. At this point Botvinnik spoke on his behalf, stating that Petrosian only attacked when he felt secure, and his greatest strength was in defence.

Some of his late successes included victories at Lone Pine 1976 and in the 1979 Paul Keres Memorial tournament in Tallinn (12/16 without a loss, ahead of Tal, Bronstein, and others). He shared first place (with Lajos Portisch and Robert Hübner) in the Rio de Janeiro Interzonal the same year, and won second place in Tilburg in 1981, half a point behind the winner Alexander Beliavsky. It was here that he played his last famous victory, a miraculous escape against the young Garry Kasparov.

==Personal life and death==

Petrosian lived in Moscow from 1949. In the 1960s and 1970s, he lived at 59 Pyatnitskaya Street. When asked by Anthony Saidy whether he is Russian, Petrosian replied: &quot;Abroad, they call us all Russians. I am a Soviet Armenian.&quot;

In 1952, Petrosian married Rona Yakovlevna (née Avinezer, 1923–2005), a Russian Jew born in Kiev, Ukraine. A graduate of the Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages, she was an English teacher and interpreter. She is buried at the Jewish section of the Vostryakovsky cemetery in Moscow. They had two sons: Vartan and Mikhail. The latter was Rona&#x27;s son from the first marriage.

His hobbies included football, backgammon, cross-country skiing, table tennis, and gardening.

Petrosian died in Moscow of stomach cancer on 13 August 1984, and is buried in the Moscow Armenian Cemetery.

=== Deafness ===
Petrosian was partially deaf and wore a hearing aid during his matches, which sometimes led to strange situations. On one occasion he offered a draw to Svetozar Gligorić, which Gligorić initially refused in surprise, but then changed his mind in a few seconds and re-offered the draw. Petrosian did not even respond to the offer, later winning the game. It was later found that he switched off his hearing aid, and did not hear when Gligorić re-offered the draw. In 1971, he played a Candidates match against Robert Hübner in a noisy area in Seville, which did not disturb him but frustrated Hübner so much that he withdrew from the match. Despite his poor hearing, he was a great lover of classical music and enjoyed attending concerts.

== Recognition and legacy ==
At the time of his death, Petrosian was working on a set of chess-related lectures and articles to be compiled in a book. These were edited by his wife Rona and published posthumously, in Russian under the title &quot;Шахматные лекции Петросяна&quot; (1989) and in English as &quot;Petrosian&#x27;s Legacy&quot; (1990).

In 1987, World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov unveiled a memorial at Petrosian&#x27;s grave which depicts the laurel wreath awarded to Chess World Champion and an image contained within a crown of the sun shining above the twin peaks of Mount Araratthe national symbol of Petrosian&#x27;s Armenian homeland. On 7 July 2006, a monument honouring Petrosian was opened in the Davtashen district of Yerevan, in the street named after Petrosian. Petrosian was also honoured on the third banknote series of the Armenian dram, with his image on the 2,000 dram banknote.

== Olympiads and team championships ==
Petrosian was not selected for the Soviet Olympiad team until 1958; though he had already been a Candidate twice by that time. From that point, however, he made ten straight Soviet Olympiad teams from 1958 to 1978, won nine team gold medals, one team silver medal, and six individual gold medals. His overall performance in Olympiad play is impressive: +78−1=50 (only one game lost, to Robert Hübner, out of 129 played), or 79.8 percent, the all-time third-best performance after Anatoly Karpov (+43−2=23 or 80.1 percent) and Mikhail Tal (+65−2=34 or 81.2 percent).
His Olympiad results follow:
* Munich 1958, 2nd reserve, 10½/13 (+8−0=5), board and team gold medals 
* Leipzig 1960, 2nd reserve, 12/13 (+11−0=2), board and team gold medals
* Varna 1962, board 2, 10/12 (+8−0=4), board and team gold medals
* Tel Aviv 1964, board 1, 9½/13 (+6−0=7), team gold medal
* Havana 1966, board 1, 11½/13 (+10−0=3), board and team gold medals
* Lugano 1968, board 1, 10½/12 (+9−0=3), board and team gold medals
* Siegen 1970, board 2, 10/14 (+6−0=8), team gold medal
* Skopje 1972, board 1, 10½/16 (+6−1=9), team gold medal
* Nice 1974, board 4, 12½/14 (+11−0=3), board and team gold medals
* Buenos Aires 1978, board 2, 6/9 (+3−0=6), team silver medal

Petrosian also made the Soviet team for the first eight European Team Championships (from 1957 to 1983). He won eight team gold medals, and four board gold medals. His totals in Euroteams play are (+15−0=37), for 64.4 per cent. His Euroteams results follow:
* Vienna 1957, board 6, 4/5 (+3−0=2), board and team gold medals
* Oberhausen 1961, board 4, 6/8 (+4−0=4), board and team gold medals
* Hamburg 1965, board 1, 6/10 (+2−0=8), board and team gold medals
* Kapfenberg 1970, board 1, 3½/6 (+1−0=5), team gold medal
* Bath, Somerset 1973, board 2, 4½/7 (+2−0=5), board and team gold medals
* Moscow 1977, board 2, 3½/6 (+1−0=5), team gold medal
* Skara 1980, board 3, 2½/5 (+0−0=5), team gold medal
* Plovdiv 1983, board 3, 3½/5 (+2−0=3), team gold medal

== Playing style ==
Petrosian was a conservative, cautious, and highly defensive chess player who was strongly influenced by Aron Nimzowitsch&#x27;s idea of prophylaxis. He made more effort to prevent his opponent&#x27;s offensive capabilities than he did to make use of his own, and very rarely went on the offensive unless he felt his position was completely secure. He usually won by playing consistently until an overly aggressive opponent made a mistake, securing victory by capitalizing upon this mistake without revealing any weaknesses of his own. This style of play often led to draws, especially against other players who preferred to counterattack. Nonetheless, his patience and mastery of defence made him extremely difficult to defeat. He was undefeated at the 1952 and 1955 Interzonals, and in 1962 he did not lose a single tournament game. Petrosian&#x27;s consistent ability to avoid defeat earned him the nickname &quot;Iron Tigran.&quot; He was considered to be the hardest player to beat in the history of chess by the authors of a 2004 book, and future World Champion Vladimir Kramnik called him &quot;the first defender with a capital D&quot;.

Petrosian preferred to play openings that did not commit his pieces to any particular plan. As black, Petrosian enjoyed playing the Sicilian Defence, Najdorf Variation and the French Defence. As white, he often played the English Opening. Petrosian would often move the same piece multiple times in a few moves, confusing his opponents in the opening and threatening draws by threefold repetition in the endgame. In a game against Mark Taimanov during the 1955 USSR Chess Championship, Petrosian moved the same rook six times in a 24-move game, with four of those moves occurring on consecutive turns. He had a strong affinity for knights rather than bishops, a characteristic that is often attributed to the influence of Aron Nimzowitsch.

A number of illustrative metaphors have been used to describe Petrosian&#x27;s style of play. Harold C. Schonberg said that &quot;playing him was like trying to put handcuffs on an eel. There was nothing to grip.&quot; He has been described as a centipede lurking in the dark, a tiger looking for the opportunity to pounce, a python who slowly squeezes his victims to death, and as a crocodile who waits for hours to make a decisive strike. Boris Spassky, who succeeded Petrosian as World Chess Champion, described his style of play thus: &quot;Petrosian reminds me of a hedgehog. Just when you think you have caught him, he puts out his quills.&quot;

Petrosian&#x27;s style of play, although highly successful for avoiding defeats, was criticized as being dull. Chess enthusiasts saw his &quot;ultraconservative&quot; style as an unwelcome contrast to the popular image of Soviet chess as &quot;daring&quot; and &quot;indomitable&quot;. His 1971 Candidates Tournament match with Viktor Korchnoi featured so many monotonous draws that the Russian press began to complain. However, Svetozar Gligorić described Petrosian as being &quot;very impressive in his incomparable ability to foresee danger on the board and to avoid any risk of defeat.&quot; Petrosian responded to his criticisms by saying: &quot;They say my games should be more &#x27;interesting&#x27;. I could be more &#x27;interesting&#x27;—and also lose.&quot; 

Another consequence of Petrosian&#x27;s style of play was that he did not score many victories, which in turn meant he seldom won tournaments even though he often finished second or third. However, his style was extremely effective in matches. 

Petrosian could also occasionally play in an attacking, sacrificial style. In his 1966 match with Spassky, he won Game 7 and Game 10 this way. Boris Spassky subsequently stated: &quot;It is to Petrosian&#x27;s advantage that his opponents never know when he is suddenly going to play like Mikhail Tal.&quot; (Tal was known as the most aggressive attacker of his era.)

=== The positional exchange sacrifice ===
Petrosian was known for his use of the &quot;positional exchange sacrifice&quot;, where one side sacrifices a rook for the opponent&#x27;s bishop or knight. Kasparov discussed Petrosian&#x27;s use of this motif:


One of Petrosian&#x27;s most famous examples of the positional exchange sacrifice is from his game against Samuel Reshevsky in Zurich 1953 (). Reshevsky, as White, appears to have an advantage due to his strong , which may become mobile after Bf3 and d4–d5. Petrosian realized he was in a difficult position because of the passive placement of his pieces, relegated to defensive roles. He further understood that White might also advance on the with h2–h4–h5, provoking weaknesses that would make it more difficult to defend later on. Faced with these threats, Petrosian devised a plan to maneuver his knight to the square d5, where it would be prominently placed in the centre and blockade the advance of White&#x27;s pawns.

:25... Re6

With the rook vacated from e7, the black knight is free to move to d5, where it will be attacking the pawn on c3 and help support an eventual advance of his pawn with ...b5–b4.

:26. a4 Ne7 27. Bxe6 fxe6 28. Qf1 Nd5 29. Rf3 Bd3 30. Rxd3 cxd3

The game was eventually drawn on move 41.

=== Contributions to opening theory ===

Petrosian was an expert against the King&#x27;s Indian Defence, and he often played what is now known as the Petrosian System: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 Bg7 4.e4 d6 5.Nf3 0-0 6.Be2 e5 7.d5. This variation closes the centre early in the game. One of the tactical ideas for White is to play Bg5, pinning Black&#x27;s knight to his queen. Black can respond by either moving his queen (usually ...Qe8) or by playing ...h6, though the latter move weakens Black&#x27;s kingside pawn structure. Two of Black&#x27;s responses to the Petrosian Variation were developed by grandmasters Paul Keres and Leonid Stein. The Keres Variation arises after 7...Nbd7 8.Bg5 h6 9.Bh4 g5 10.Bg3 Nh5 11.h4, and the Stein Variation begins an immediate queenside offensive with 7...a5.

The Queen&#x27;s Indian Defence also has a variation developed by Petrosian: 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nf3 b6 4.a3, with the idea of preventing ...Bb4+. This system received much attention in 1980 when it was used by the young Garry Kasparov to defeat several grandmasters. Today the Petrosian Variation is still considered the most pressing variation, with the greatest score in Master games.

Other Petrosian variations can be found in the Grünfeld Defence after 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.Nf3 Bg7 5.Bg5, and the French Defence after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e5 Qd7. Some authorities refer to a variation of the Caro–Kann Defence with his name, along with former world champion Vassily Smyslov: the Petrosian–Smyslov Variation, 1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Nd7.

== Quotes ==
* &quot;In those years, it was easier to win the Soviet Championship than a game against &#x27;Iron Tigran&#x27;.&quot; — Lev Polugaevsky
* &quot;It is to Petrosian&#x27;s advantage that his opponents never know when he is suddenly going to play like Mikhail Tal.&quot; — Boris Spassky
* &quot;I&#x27;m absolutely convinced that in chess – although it remains a game – there is nothing accidental. And this is my credo. I like only those chess games, in which I have played in accordance with the position requirements... I believe only in logical and right game.&quot; — Tigran Petrosian
* &quot;During tournament analysis sessions players all speak at once, but whenever Petrosian said anything, everyone would shut up and listen.&quot; — Yasser Seirawan
* &quot;I associate Tigran Petrosian with Warne Marsh. A unique style of play which, it seemed, was too calm and dull, while in reality it was deep and cunning.&quot; — Levon Aronian

<text>Jacob Ettlinger (17 March 1798 – 7 December 1871) () was an Ashkenazi rabbi and author, and one of the leaders of Orthodox Judaism. He is sometimes referred to as the Aruch la-Ner (ערוך לנר), after his best-known publication.

==Biography==
Ettlinger was born in Karlsruhe, Baden, and died in Altona, Prussia. He received his early education from his father Aaron, who was &quot;Klausrabbiner&quot; (rabbi of a small synagogue) in Karlsruhe. Aaron was also a recognized Talmudical scholar who was steeped in Kabbalah.

He then went to study under the Rabbi of Karlsruhe, Rabbi Asher Wallerstein, the son of the famed Shaagas Aryeh. Wallerstein was also the Chief Rabbi of the entire Grand Duchy of Baden. Ettlinger remained his student until the age of 18.

Ettlinger rounded off his Talmudical education in the yeshiva of Abraham Bing in Würzburg, one of the most significant Torah centers in Germany. While there, he attended the University of Würzburg, mainly studying philosophy. He was thus among the earliest German rabbis who possessed academic training. It should be pointed out, however, that he never received any formal degree.

The fact that Ettlinger stayed fervently Orthodox, even though he attended University, was considered by most to be an anomaly. Kaufmann Kohler reports that the saying was current that &quot;Satan made him go through the university and come forth so immune and loyal, as to lure all the rest of [the] modern Rabbis to pursue those studies which caused their disloyalty to Modern Judaism&quot;.

In 1826 he was appointed &quot;Kreisrabbiner&quot; (district rabbi) of Ladenburg, with his seat in Mannheim, where he was at the same time chief prebendary (&quot;Klausprimator&quot;). This position he held until he succeeded Akiba Israel Wertheimer as Chief Rabbi of Altona, where he officiated from 1836 until his death. His ambit as Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi comprised Holstein and Schleswig and until 1864 also Denmark. In this position he became one of the most prominent representatives of German Orthodoxy.

His &quot;yeshiva&quot; was attended by a great many students preparing for the ministry, and many of them became leaders of Orthodoxy. Samson Raphael Hirsch was his disciple in Mannheim, and Azriel Hildesheimer in Altona. Five of his sons-in-law became prominent Orthodox rabbis: Joseph Isaacsohn of Rotterdam, of Schwerin, Israel Meir Freimann of Ostrowo, of Kissingen and Markus Mordechai Horovitz of Frankfurt. He was the last German rabbi who acted as civil judge. Much against his will, the Danish government, to which Altona then belonged, abolished this right of the Altona Rabbi in 1863. The purity of his character and the sincerity of his religious views were acknowledged even by his opponents.

===Death===
In his will, Ettlinger requested that he not be described as having been a &quot;Tzaddik&quot; (righteous individual), and that the inscription on his tombstone should contain merely the titles of his works and a statement of the number of years during which he was rabbi of Altona. He further asked that the four capital punishments (stoning, burning, decapitation and asphyxiation) be performed symbolically on his body.

==Views==
===Clashes with the Reform movement===
Ettlinger became one of the strongest opponents of the early Reform Judaism movement, and headed a protest of 173 rabbis against the Brunswick Conference of 1844. In the following year he established the first organ of Orthodox Judaism, &quot;Der treue Zionswächter, Organ zur Wahrung der Interessen des gesetzestreuen Judenthums&quot; with a Hebrew language supplement, &quot;Shomer Tziyon ha-Ne&#x27;eman&quot;, edited by S. J. Enoch.

He was a firm defender of Orthodox tradition. A typical story is reported by Abraham Geiger, who formed Ettlinger&#x27;s acquaintance as a student in 1829. At a school examination a teacher said that Joseph&#x27;s brothers had acted in an unbrotherly fashion, whereupon Ettlinger rebuked him indignantly for speaking ill of the Twelve Tribes of Israel.

===Attitude towards Kabbalah===
Ettlinger expressed a positive view towards Kabbalah, as can be judged from his first work, &quot;Bikkurei Yaakov&quot;. In the preface, Etllinger explains that he chose the title because it had the numerical value of Jacob and Rachel, who are mystically represented in the law of the Sukkah, with which the book deals. A similar belief in the doctrines of the Kabbalah is expressed in a sermon in which he urged early burial, because as long as the body remains unburied evil spirits have power over it.

==Notable rulings==
In his legal responsa, Ettlinger dealt with many complex halachic dilemmas, often presenting novel theories to resolve them.

In one &quot;teshuvah&quot;, he responded to Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Kalischer, who was attempting to attract support for his movement to build the Third Temple and offer sacrifices there. Ettlinger expressed strong opposition. Among his arguments was that most sacrifices would not be valid in any case. Ettlinger posited that since the Mishna states that for a sacrifice to be valid it must be offered with intent to generate &quot;reiach&quot; (literally meaning &quot;scent&quot;), any sacrifice offered during the period of exile will be automatically invalidated, since the Torah clearly states that God declared he would no longer &quot;inhale&quot; the &quot;scent&quot; of the offerings in the epoch of exile, thus rendering any intent of generating &quot;reiach&quot; void and farcical.

In the famed Machine Matzo Controversy, Ettlinger ruled that machine-made Matzo could be used on Passover. He writes, &quot;If they are disgusted with it because it is a new thing; we, the rabbis of Germany who are upright in their hearts... also distance [ourselves from] innovations regarding Torah and mitzvos as far as a bowshot away. However, what the experts and natural scholars innovate in regards to nature, why should we not accept the good from them, to strengthen the holes in our knowledge, to keep the mitzvos... as any understanding man could judge for himself.&quot;Nevertheless, he instituted that the matzos&#x27; edges be cut off, so that they would appear round, like traditional matzos.

In 1859, Ettlinger was consulted about an incident where a man, claiming to be the prophet Elijah and acting on the word of God, defiled a married woman. Ettlinger was asked to determine whether the woman had acquired the status of an unfaithful wife, rendering her forbidden to her husband. Ettlinger began his response by stating: &quot;I have reviewed all of the aspects, and it is very difficult to find a cure and a remedy for this plague of stupidity that would permit this woman to her husband.&quot; However, his final conclusion was that since the woman had believed she was acting under the express orders of God, she was to be looked at as if she had been physically compelled and had no choice in the matter.

==Aruch la-Ner==
Ettlinger&#x27;s work &quot;Aruch la-Ner&quot;, consisting of novellae on many Talmudical tractates, is one of the standard texts in Yeshivas around the world. This is most probably due to &quot;the rigid intellectual discipline, and detailed analysis of Talmudic sources&quot; that are the hallmark of this work. It is quoted extensively by scholars such as Elchonon Wasserman, Adin Steinsaltz, Boruch Ber Leibowitz, and Reuven Grozovsky.

<text>An academy (Attic Greek: Ἀκαδήμεια; Koine Greek Ἀκαδημία) is an institution of tertiary education.

The name traces back to Plato&#x27;s school of philosophy, founded approximately 386 BC at Akademia, a sanctuary of Athena, the goddess of wisdom and skill, north of Athens, Greece.

The Royal Spanish Academy defines academy as scientific, literary or artistic society established with public authority and as a teaching establishment, public or private, of a professional, artistic, technical or simply practical nature.

== Etymology ==
The word comes from the &quot;Academy&quot; in ancient Greece, which derives from the Athenian hero, &quot;Akademos&quot;. Outside the city walls of Athens, the gymnasium was made famous by Plato as a center of learning. The sacred space, dedicated to the goddess of wisdom, Athena, had formerly been an olive grove, hence the expression &quot;the groves of Academe&quot;.

In these gardens, the philosopher Plato conversed with followers. Plato developed his sessions into a method of teaching philosophy and in 387 BC, established what is known today as the Old Academy.

By extension, &quot;academia&quot; has come to mean the accumulation, development and transmission of knowledge across generations as well as its practitioners and transmitters. In the 17th century, British, Italian and French scholars used the term to describe types of institutions of higher learning.

==Origins==
===Original Academy===

Before &quot;Akademia&quot; was a school, and even before Cimon enclosed its precincts with a wall, it contained a sacred grove of olive trees dedicated to Athena, the goddess of wisdom, outside the city walls of ancient Athens. The archaic name for the site was &quot;Hekademia&quot;, which by classical times evolved into &quot;Akademia&quot; and was explained, at least as early as the beginning of the 6th century BC, by linking it to an Athenian hero, a legendary &quot;Akademos&quot;. The site of &quot;Akademia&quot; was sacred to Athena and other immortals.

Plato&#x27;s immediate successors as &quot;scholarch&quot; of &quot;Akademia&quot; were Speusippus (347–339 BC), Xenocrates (339–314 BC), Polemon (314–269 BC), Crates (–266 BC), and Arcesilaus (–240 BC). Later scholarchs include Lacydes of Cyrene, Carneades, Clitomachus, and Philo of Larissa (&quot;the last undisputed head of the Academy&quot;). Other notable members of &quot;Akademia&quot; include Aristotle, Heraclides Ponticus, Eudoxus of Cnidus, Philip of Opus, Crantor, and Antiochus of Ascalon.

===Neoplatonic Academy of Late Antiquity===
After a lapse during the early Roman occupation, &quot;Akademia&quot; was refounded as a new institution of some outstanding Platonists of late antiquity who called themselves &quot;successors&quot; (&quot;diadochoi&quot;, but of Plato) and presented themselves as an uninterrupted tradition reaching back to Plato. However, there cannot have actually been any geographical, institutional, economic or personal continuity with the original Academy in the new organizational entity.

The last &quot;Greek&quot; philosophers of the revived &quot;Akademia&quot; in the 6th century were drawn from various parts of the Hellenistic cultural world and suggest the broad syncretism of the common culture (see &quot;koine&quot;): Five of the seven &quot;Akademia&quot; philosophers mentioned by Agathias were Syriac in their cultural origin: Hermias and Diogenes (both from Phoenicia), Isidorus of Gaza, Damascius of Syria, Iamblichus of Coele-Syria and perhaps even Simplicius of Cilicia.

The emperor Justinian ceased the school&#x27;s funding in AD 529, a date that is often cited as the end of Antiquity. According to the sole witness, the historian Agathias, its remaining members looked for protection under the rule of Sassanid king Khosrau I in his capital at Ctesiphon, carrying with them precious scrolls of literature and philosophy, and to a lesser degree of science. After a peace treaty between the Persian and the Byzantine empire in 532 guaranteed their personal security (an early document in the history of freedom of religion), some members found sanctuary in the pagan stronghold of Harran, near Edessa. One of the last leading figures of this group was Simplicius, a pupil of Damascius, the last head of the Athenian school.

It has been speculated that &quot;Akademia&quot; did not altogether disappear. After his exile, Simplicius (and perhaps some others), may have travelled to Harran, near Edessa. From there, the students of an academy-in-exile could have survived into the 9th century, long enough to facilitate the Arabic revival of the Neoplatonist commentary tradition in Baghdad.

==Ancient and medieval institutions==

===Ancient world===
====Greece and early Europe====
In ancient Greece, after the establishment of the original Academy, Plato&#x27;s colleagues and pupils developed spin-offs of his method. Arcesilaus, a Greek student of Plato established the Middle Academy. Carneades, another student, established the New Academy. In 335 BC, Aristotle refined the method with his own theories and established the Lyceum in another gymnasium.

====Africa====
The Musaeum, Serapeum and library of Alexandria Egypt was frequented by intellectuals from Africa, Europe and Asia studying various aspects of philosophy, language and mathematics.

The University of Timbuktu was a medieval university in Timbuktu, present-day Mali, which comprised three schools: the Mosque of Djinguereber, the Mosque of Sidi Yahya, and the Mosque of Sankore. During its zenith, the university had an average attendance of around 25,000 students within a city of around 100,000 people.

====China====
In China a higher education institution Shang Xiang was founded by Shun in the Youyu era before the 21st century BC. The Imperial Central Academy at Nanjing, founded in 258, was a result of the evolution of Shang Xiang and it became the first comprehensive institution combining education and research and was divided into five faculties in 470, which later became Nanjing University.

In the 8th century another kind of institution of learning emerged, named Shuyuan, which were generally privately owned. There were thousands of Shuyuan recorded in ancient times. The degrees from them varied from one to another and those advanced Shuyuan such as Bailudong Shuyuan and Yuelu Shuyuan (later become Hunan University) can be classified as higher institutions of learning.

====India====
Taxila or Takshashila, in ancient India, modern-day Pakistan, was an early centre of learning, near present-day Islamabad in the city of Taxila. It is considered one of the ancient universities of the world. According to scattered references which were only fixed a millennium later it may have dated back to at least the 5th century BC. Some scholars date Takshashila&#x27;s existence back to the 6th century BC. The school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious instruction was most likely still provided on an individualistic basis. Takshashila is described in some detail in later Jātaka tales, written in Sri Lanka around the 5th century AD.

It became a noted centre of learning at least several centuries BC, and continued to attract students until the destruction of the city in the 5th century AD. Takshashila is perhaps best known because of its association with Chanakya. The famous treatise Arthashastra (Sanskrit for The knowledge of Economics) by Chanakya, is said to have been composed in Takshashila itself. Chanakya (or Kautilya), the Maurya Emperor Chandragupta and the Ayurvedic healer Charaka studied at Taxila.

Generally, a student entered Takshashila at the age of sixteen. The Vedas and the Eighteen Arts, which included skills such as archery, hunting, and elephant lore, were taught, in addition to its law school, medical school, and school of military science.

Nalanda was established in the 5th century AD in Bihar, India. It was founded in 427 in northeastern India, not far from what is today the southern border of Nepal. It survived until 1197 when it was set upon, destroyed and burnt by the marauding forces of Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji. It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war.

The center had eight separate compounds, 10 temples, meditation halls, classrooms, lakes and parks. It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, perhaps a first for an educational institution, housing 10,000 students in the university&#x27;s heyday and providing accommodation for 2,000 professors. Nalanda University attracted pupils and scholars from Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey.

===Persia===
The geographical position of Persia allowed it to absorb cultural influences and ideas from both west and east. This include the spread of the Greek form of schools in the new Hellenistic cities built in Persia after the invasion of Alexander the Great.

Under the Sasanians, Syriac became an important language of the administration and intellectuals, rivaling Greek. Several cities developed centers of higher learning in the Sasanian Empire, including Mosul, al-Hira, and Harran (famous for the Pythagorean School of the Sabians). The Grand School was the main center of learning in the Persian capital Ctesiphon, but little is known about it. Perhaps the most famous center of learning in Persia was the Academy of Gundishapur, teaching medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and logic. The academy was later instrumental in founding the Muslim city of Baghdad as a center of learning, and serving as the model for the first Muslim hospital (&quot;bimaristan&quot;) at Damascus.

====Islamic world====

Founded in Fes, University of Al-Karaouine in the 9th century and in Cairo, Al-Azhar University in the 10th century, and in Mali, the University of Timbuktu in about 1100. Mustansiriya Madrasah in Baghdad, Iraq was established in 1227 as a madrasah by the Abbasid Caliph al-Mustansir. Its library had an initial collection of 80,000 volumes, given by the Caliph. The collection was said to have grown to 400,000 volumes.

===Medieval Europe===

In Europe, the academy dates to the ancient Greeks and Romans in the pre-Christian era. Newer universities were founded in the 12th and 13th centuries, and the European institution of academia took shape. Monks and priests moved out of monasteries to cathedral cities and other towns where they opened the first schools dedicated to advanced study.

The most notable of these new schools were in Bologna and Salerno, Naples, Salamanca, Paris, Oxford and Cambridge, while others were opened throughout Europe.

The seven liberal arts—the Trivium (Grammar, Rhetoric, and Logic), and the Quadrivium (Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, and Astronomy)—had been codified in late antiquity. This was the basis of the curriculum in Europe until newly available Arabic texts and the works of Aristotle became more available in Europe in the 12th century.

It remained in place even after the new scholasticism of the School of Chartres and the encyclopedic work of Thomas Aquinas, until the humanism of the 15th and 16th centuries opened new studies of arts and sciences.

==Renaissance academies in Italy==
With the Neoplatonist revival that accompanied the revival of humanist studies, &quot;academia&quot; took on newly vivid connotations.

===15th-century &quot;academies&quot;===
During the Florentine Renaissance, Cosimo de&#x27; Medici took a personal interest in the new Platonic Academy that he determined to re-establish in 1439, centered on the marvellous promise shown by the young Marsilio Ficino. Cosimo had been inspired by the arrival at the otherwise ineffective Council of Florence of Gemistos Plethon, who seemed a dazzling figure to the Florentine intellectuals. In 1462 Cosimo gave Ficino a villa at Careggi for the academy&#x27;s use, situated where Cosimo could see it from his own villa, and drop by for visits. The academy remained a wholly informal group, but one which had a great influence on Renaissance Neo-Platonism.
In Rome, after unity was restored following the Western Schism, humanist circles, cultivating philosophy and searching out and sharing ancient texts tended to gather where there was access to a library. The Vatican Library was not coordinated until 1475 and was never catalogued or widely accessible: not all popes looked with satisfaction at gatherings of unsupervised intellectuals. At the head of this movement for renewal in Rome was Cardinal Bessarion, whose house from the mid-century was the centre of a flourishing academy of Neoplatonic philosophy and a varied intellectual culture. His valuable Greek as well as Latin library (eventually bequeathed to the city of Venice after he withdrew from Rome) was at the disposal of the academicians. Bessarion, in the latter years of his life, retired from Rome to Ravenna, but he left behind him ardent adherents of the classic philosophy.

The next generation of humanists were bolder admirers of pagan culture, especially in the highly personal academy of Pomponius Leto, the natural son of a nobleman of the Sanseverino family, born in Calabria but known by his academic name, who devoted his energies to the enthusiastic study of classical antiquity, and attracted a great number of disciples and admirers. He was a worshipper not merely of the literary and artistic form, but also of the ideas and spirit of classic paganism, which made him appear a condemner of Christianity and an enemy of the Church. In his academy every member assumed a classical name. Its principal members were humanists, like Bessarion&#x27;s protégé Giovanni Antonio Campani (Campanus), Bartolomeo Platina, the papal librarian, and Filippo Buonaccorsi, and young visitors who received polish in the academic circle, like Publio Fausto Andrelini of Bologna who took the New Learning to the University of Paris, to the discomfiture of his friend Erasmus. In their self-confidence, these first intellectual neopagans compromised themselves politically, at a time when Rome was full of conspiracies fomented by the Roman barons and the neighbouring princes: Paul II (1464–71) caused Pomponio and the leaders of the academy to be arrested on charges of irreligion, immorality, and conspiracy against the Pope. The prisoners begged so earnestly for mercy, and with such protestations of repentance, that they were pardoned. The Letonian academy, however, collapsed.

In Naples, the &quot;Quattrocento&quot; academy founded by Alfonso of Aragon and guided by Antonio Beccadelli was the &quot;Porticus Antoniana&quot;, later known as the &quot;Accademia Pontaniana&quot;, after Giovanni Pontano.

===16th-century literary-aesthetic academies===
The 16th century saw at Rome a great increase of literary and aesthetic academies, more or less inspired by the Renaissance, all of which assumed, as was the fashion, odd and fantastic names. We learn from various sources the names of many such institutes; as a rule, they soon perished and left no trace. In the 1520s came the &quot;Accademia degli Intronati&quot;, for the encouragement of theatrical representations. There were also the academy of the &quot;Vignaiuoli&quot;, or &quot;Vinegrowers&quot; (1530), and the &quot;&quot; (1542), founded by Claudio Tolomei under the patronage of Cardinal Ippolito de&#x27; Medici. These were followed by a new academy in the &quot;Orti&quot; or Farnese gardens. There were also the academies of the &quot;Intrepidi&quot; (1560), the &quot;Animosi&quot; (1576), and the &quot;Illuminati&quot; (1598); this last, founded by the Marchesa Isabella Aldobrandini Pallavicino. Towards the middle of the 16th century there were also the academy of the &quot;Notti Vaticane&quot;, or &quot;Vatican Nights&quot;, founded by St. Charles Borromeo; an &quot;Accademia di Diritto civile e canonico&quot;, and another of the university scholars and students of philosophy (Accademia Eustachiana). As a rule these academies, all very much alike, were merely circles of friends or clients gathered around a learned man or wealthy patron, and were dedicated to literary pastimes rather than methodical study. They fitted in, nevertheless, with the general situation and were in their own way one element of the historical development. Despite their empirical and fugitive character, they helped to keep up the general esteem for literary and other studies. Cardinals, prelates, and the clergy in general were most favourable to this movement, and assisted it by patronage and collaboration.

In Florence, the Medici again took the lead in establishing the Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno in 1563, the first of the more formally organised art academies that gradually displaced the medieval artists&#x27; guilds, usually known as the Guild of Saint Luke, as the bodies responsible for training and often regulating artists, a change with great implications for the development of art, leading to the styles known as Academic art. The private Accademia degli Incamminati set up later in the century in Bologna by the Carracci brothers was also extremely influential, and with the Accademia di San Luca of Rome (founded 1593) helped to confirm the use of the term for these institutions.

==17th- and 18th-century academies in Europe==
Gradually academies began to specialize on particular topics (arts, language, sciences) and began to be founded and funded by the kings and other sovereigns (few republics had an academy). And, mainly, since 17th century academies spread throughout Europe.

===Literary-philosophical academies=== 
In the 17th century the tradition of literary-philosophical academies, as circles of friends gathering around learned patrons, was continued in Italy; the &quot;Umoristi&quot; (1611), the &quot;Fantastici (1625), and the &quot;Ordinati&quot;, founded by Cardinal Dati and Giulio Strozzi. About 1700 were founded the academies of the &quot;Infecondi&quot;, the &quot;Occulti&quot;, the &quot;Deboli&quot;, the &quot;Aborigini&quot;, the &quot;Immobili&quot;, the &quot;Accademia Esquilina&quot;, and others. During the 18th century many Italian cities established similar philosophical and scientific academies. In the first half of the 19th century some of these became the national academies of pre-unitarian states: the academy of Accesi became the Panomitan Academy of Buon Gusto (Trento); the academy of Timidi became the Royal Academy of Mantua; the Accademia dei Ricovrati became the Galileiana Academy of Arts and Science (Padova); the academy of Dissonanti became the Royal Academy of Modena and the academy of Oscuri became the Royal Academy of Lucca.

===Academies of the arts===
The Académie de peinture et de sculpture in Paris, established by the monarchy in 1648 (later renamed) was the most significant of the artistic academies, running the famous Salon exhibitions from 1725. Artistic academies were established all over Europe by the end of the 18th century, and many, like the Akademie der Künste in Berlin (founded 1696), the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid (founded 1744), the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg (1757), the Royal Academy in London (1768) and the Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera in Milan (1776) still run art schools and hold large exhibitions, although their influence on taste greatly declined from the late 19th century.

A fundamental feature of academic discipline in the artistic academies was regular practice in making accurate drawings from antiquities, or from casts of antiquities, on the one hand, and on the other, in deriving inspiration from the other fount, the human form. Students assembled in sessions drawing the draped and undraped human form, and such drawings, which survive in the tens of thousands from the 17th through the 19th century, are termed académies in French.

Similar institutions were often established for other arts: Rome had the Accademia di Santa Cecilia for music from 1585; Paris had the Académie Royale de Musique from 1669 and the Académie Royale d&#x27;Architecture from 1671.

===Linguistic academies===

The Accademia degli Infiammati of Padova and the Accademia degli Umidi, soon renamed the Accademia Fiorentina, of Florence were both founded in 1540, and were both initially concerned with the proper basis for literary use of the &quot;volgare&quot;, or vernacular language of Italy, which would later become the Italian language. In 1582 five Florentine literati gathered and founded the to demonstrate and conserve the beauty of the Florentine vernacular tongue, modelled upon the authors of the Trecento. The main instrument to do so was the &quot;Vocabolario degli Accademici della Crusca&quot;. The Crusca long remained a private institution, criticizing and opposing the official Accademia Fiorentina.

The first institution inspired by the Crusca was the Fruitbearing Society for German language, which existed from 1617 to 1680.

The Crusca inspired Richelieu to found in 1634 the analogous with the task of acting as an official authority on the French language, charged with publishing the official dictionary of that language. The following year the Académie received letters patent from the king Louis XIII as the only recognized academy for French language.

In its turn the state established Académie was the model for the (founded in 1713) and the Swedish Academy (1786), which are the ruling bodies of their respective languages and editors of major dictionaries. It also was the model for the Russian Academy, founded in 1783, which afterwards merged into the Russian Academy of Sciences.

===Academies of sciences===
After the short-lived Academia Secretorum Naturae of Naples, the first academy exclusively devoted to sciences was the Accademia dei Lincei founded in 1603 in Rome, particularly focused on natural sciences.
In 1657 some students of Galileo founded the Accademia del Cimento (Academy of Experiment) in Florence, focused on physics and astronomy. The foundation of academy was funded by Prince Leopoldo and Grand Duke Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici. This academy lasted after few decades.

In 1652 was founded the Academia Naturae Curiosorum by four physicians. In 1677, Leopold I, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, recognised the society and in 1687 he gave it the epithet &quot;Leopoldina&quot;, with which is internationally famous., p. 7–8; 
So, it became the academy of sciences for the whole Holy Roman Empire.

On 28 November 1660, a group of scientists from and influenced by the Invisible College (gathering approximately since 1645) met at Gresham College and announced the formation of a &quot;College for the Promoting of Physico-Mathematical Experimental Learning&quot;, which would meet weekly to discuss science and run experiments. In 1662 Charles II of England signed a Royal Charter which created the &quot;Royal Society of London&quot;, then &quot;Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge&quot;.

In 1666 Colbert gathered a small group of scholars to found a scientific society in Paris. The first 30 years of the academy&#x27;s existence were relatively informal, since no statutes had as yet been laid down for the institution. In contrast to Royal Society, the academy was founded as an organ of government. In 1699, Louis XIV gave the academy its first rules and named it Académie royale des sciences.

Although Prussia was a member of Holy Roman Empire, in 1700 Prince-elector Frederick III of Brandenburg founded its own Prussian Academy of Sciences upon the advice of Gottfried Leibniz, who was appointed president.

During the 18th century many European kings followed and founded their own academy of sciences: in 1714 the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna, in 1724 the Russian Academy of Sciences, in 1731 the Royal Dublin Society, in 1735 in Tuscany, in 1739 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, in 1742 the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, in 1751 the Göttingen Academy of Sciences, in 1754 in Erfurt, in 1759 the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities, in 1763 the Academia Theodoro-Palatina in Heidelberg, in 1779 the Sciences Academy of Lisbon, in 1783 the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1782 the Accademia dei Quaranta in Rome, in 1784 in Turin.

This kind of academy lost importance after the university reform begun with the foundation of the University of Berlin, when universities were provided with laboratories and clinics, and were charged with doing experimental research.

===Academic societies===
Academic societies or learned societies began as groups of academics who worked together or presented their work to each other. These informal groups later became organized and in many cases state-approved. Membership was restricted, usually requiring approval of the current members and often total membership was limited to a specific number. The Royal Society founded in 1660 was the first such academy. In 1720, King John V of Portugal approved the founding and gave royal patronage to the Royal Academy of Portuguese History which had been meeting informally, since 1717, under the sponsorship of the 4th Count of Ericeira. The American Academy of Arts and Sciences was begun in 1780 by many of the same people prominent in the American Revolution. Academic societies served both as a forum to present and publish academic work, the role now served by academic publishing, and as a means to sponsor research and support academics, a role they still serve. Membership in academic societies is still a matter of prestige in modern academia.

===Military academies===
At first such institutions only trained the Artillery and Military Engineering officers, like the &quot;Aula da Artilharia&quot; (founded in 1641) and the &quot;Aula de Fortificação&quot; (1647) in Lisbon, the Real Accademia di Savoia in Turin (opened in 1678), the Imperial Artillery Military Academy of Saint Petersburg (1698), the Royal Military Academy Woolwich (1741), the &quot;Real Colegio de Artilleria&quot; in Segovia (1764).

Starting at the end of the 16th century in the Holy Roman Empire, France, Poland and Denmark, many Knight academies were established to prepare the aristocratic youth for state and military service. Many of them lately turned into gymnasiums, but some of them were transformed into true military academies.

The Royal Danish Military Academy began to educate all officers for the Royal Danish Army by request of King Frederick IV in 1713.

The École Militaire was founded by Louis XV of France in 1750 with the aim of creating an academic college for cadet officers from poor families. The construction began in 1752, but the school did not open until 1760.

The Theresian Military Academy was founded on 14 December 1751 by Maria Theresa of Austria. Per year the academy accepted 100 noblemen and 100 commoners to start their education there.&lt;br&gt;
These were the model for the subsequent military academies throughout Europe, like the &quot;Reale Accademia Militare&quot; of Naples in 1787 and the Military Academy Karlberg in 1792.

==Modern use of the term &quot;academy&quot;==

The term is used widely today to refer to anything from schools to learned societies to funding agencies to private industry associations.

National academies are bodies for scientists, artists or writers that are usually state-funded and often are given the role of controlling much of the state funding for research into their areas, or other forms of funding. Some use different terms in their name – the British Royal Society for example. The membership typically comprises distinguished individuals in the relevant field, who may be elected by the other members, or appointed by the government. They are essentially not schools or colleges, though some may operate teaching arms. The was the most influential pattern for these. Finland even has two separate &quot;academies&quot;: Academy of Finland is a government-run funding agency, Suomalainen tiedeakatemia is a learned society.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which presents the annual Academy Awards, is an example of a purely industry body using the name. College-type specialized academies include the Royal Academy of Music of the United Kingdom; the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York; the United States Naval Academy; United States Air Force Academy; and the Australian Defence Force Academy. In emulation of the military academies, police in the United States are trained in police academies.

Because of the tradition of intellectual brilliance associated with this institution, many groups have chosen to use the word &quot;academy&quot; in their name, especially specialized tertiary educational institutions. In the early 19th century &quot;academy&quot; took the connotations that &quot;gymnasium&quot; was acquiring in German-speaking lands, of school that was less advanced than a college (for which it might prepare students) but considerably more than elementary. Early American examples are the prestigious preparatory schools of Phillips Andover Academy, Phillips Exeter Academy and Deerfield Academy. In England, &quot;academy&quot; had a specialized meaning for schools, but the Edinburgh Academy was more like the American examples. Academy was also used very loosely for various commercial training schools for dancing and the like.

Mozart organized public subscription performances of his music in Vienna in the 1780s and 1790s, he called the concerts &quot;academies&quot;. This usage in musical terms survives in the concert orchestra Academy of St Martin in the Fields and in the Brixton Academy, a concert hall in Brixton, South London.

Academies proliferated in the 20th century until even a three-week series of lectures and discussions would be termed an &quot;academy&quot;. In addition, the generic term &quot;the academy&quot; is sometimes used to refer to all of academia, which is sometimes considered a global successor to the academy of Athens.

===French regional academies overseeing education===
In France, regional academic councils called academies are responsible for supervising all aspects of education in their region. The academy regions are similar to, but not identical to, the standard French administrative regions. The rector of each academy is a revocable nominee of the Ministry of Education. These academies&#x27; main responsibility is overseeing primary and secondary education, but public universities are in some respects also answerable to the academy for their region. However, French private universities are independent of the state and therefore independent of the regional academies.

===Russian research academies===
In Imperial Russia and Soviet Union the term &quot;academy&quot;, or Academy of Sciences was reserved to denote a state research establishment, see Russian Academy of Sciences. The latter one still exists in Russia, although other types of academies (study and honorary) appeared as well.

===English school types===
====Tertiary education====

From the mid-seventeenth to the 19th centuries, educational institutions in England run by nonconformist groups that did not agree with the Church of England teachings were collectively known as &quot;the dissenting academies&quot;. As a place at an English public school or university generally required conformity to the Church of England, these institutions provided an alternative for those with different religious views and formed a significant part of England&#x27;s educational system.

University College London (UCL) was founded in 1826 as the first publicly funded English university to admit anyone regardless of religious adherence; and the Test and Corporation Acts, which had imposed a wide range of restrictions on citizens who were not in conformity to the Church of England, were abolished shortly afterwards, by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829.

====Primary and secondary education====

In 2000, a form of &quot;independent state schools&quot;, called &quot;academies&quot;, were introduced in England. They have been compared to US charter schools. They are directly funded from central government rather than through local councils, and are partly privately sponsored. Often the sponsors are from business, but some are sponsored by universities and charities. These schools have greater autonomy than schools run by the local councils. They are usually a type of secondary school, but some are &quot;all through&quot; schools with an integral primary school. Some of the early ones were briefly known as &quot;city academies&quot;—the first such school opening on 10 September 2002 at the Business Academy Bexley.

The Queen&#x27;s Speech, which followed the 2010 general election, included proposals for a bill to allow the Secretary of State for Education to approve schools, both Primary and Secondary, that have been graded &quot;outstanding&quot; by Ofsted, to become academies. This was to be through a simplified streamlined process not requiring sponsors to provide capital funding.

In 2012, the UK government began forcing some schools which had been graded satisfactory or lower into becoming academies, unilaterally removing existing governing bodies and head teachers in some cases. An example was Downhills Primary School in Haringey, where the head teacher refused to turn the school into an academy. OFSTED were called in to assess the school, failed it, and both the head and the governing body were removed and replaced with a Government-appointed board despite opposition from the school and parents.

===United States===

Prior to the twentieth century, education was not as carefully structured in the United States as it is in the twenty-first. There was not a rigid division between high school and colleges. The typical college at first included a preparatory unit, which it dropped by 1900.

In the nineteenth century an academy was what later became known as a high school; in most places in the U.S. there were no public schools above the primary level. Some older high schools, such as Corning Free Academy, retained the term in their names (Corning Free Academy, demoted to a middle school, closed in 2014). In 1753, Benjamin Franklin established the academy and Charitable School of the Province of Pennsylvania. In 1755, it was renamed the college and Academy and Charitable School of Philadelphia. Today, it is known as the University of Pennsylvania. The United States Military Academy was formed in 1802 as a college. It never included a preparatory unit. 

The academy movement in the US in the early 19th century arose from a public sense that education in the classic disciplines needed to be extended into the new territories and states that were being formed in the new western states. Thousands of academies were started using local funds and tuition; most closed after a few years and others were established. In 1860 there were 6,415 academies in operation. When the Civil War erupted in 1861 they generally closed down temporarily; most in the South never reopened.

===Germany===
During the Age of Enlightenment in 18th-century Europe, the academy started to change in Europe. In the beginning of the 19th century Wilhelm von Humboldt not only published his philosophical paper &quot;On the Limits of State Action&quot;, but also directed the educational system in Prussia for a short time. He introduced an academic system that was much more accessible to the lower classes. Humboldt&#x27;s Ideal was an education based on individuality, creativity, wholeness, and versatility. Many continental European universities are still rooted in these ideas (or at least pay lip-service to them). They are, however, in contradiction to today&#x27;s massive trend of specialization in academia.

==Academic personnel==


An &quot;academic&quot; is a person who works as a teacher or researcher at a university or other higher education institution. An academic usually holds an advanced degree. The term &quot;scholar&quot; is sometimes used with equivalent meaning to that of &quot;academic&quot; and describes in general those who attain mastery in a research discipline. It has wider application, with it also being used to describe those whose occupation was research prior to organized higher education.

Academic administrators such as university presidents are not typically included in this use of the term &quot;academic&quot;, although many administrators hold advanced degrees and pursue scholarly research and writing while also tending to their administrative duties.

In the United States, the term academic is approximately synonymous with that of the job title professor although in recent decades a growing number of institutions include librarians in the category of &quot;academic staff&quot;.
In the United Kingdom, various titles of academic rank are used, typically research associate, research fellow (also senior research fellow and principal research fellow), lecturer (also senior lecturer and principal lecturer), reader, and professor. The colloquial term don is sometimes substituted for teaching staff at Oxford and Cambridge.

==Structure==
Academia is usually conceived as divided into &quot;disciplines&quot; or &quot;fields&quot; of study. These have their roots in the subjects of the medieval trivium and quadrivium, which provided the model for scholastic thought in the first universities in medieval Europe.

The disciplines have been much revised, and many new disciplines have become more specialized, researching smaller and smaller areas. Because of this, &quot;interdisciplinary&quot; research is often prized in today&#x27;s academy, though it can also be made difficult both by practical matters of administration and funding and by differing research methods of different disciplines. In fact, many new fields of study have initially been conceived as interdisciplinary, and later become specialized disciplines in their own right – a recent example is cognitive science.

Most academic institutions reflect the divide of the disciplines in their administrative structure, being divided internally into &quot;departments&quot; or &quot;programs&quot; in various fields of study. Each department is typically administered and funded separately by the academic institution, though there may be some overlap and faculty members, research and administrative staff may in some cases be shared among departments. In addition, academic institutions generally have an overall administrative structure (usually including a president and several deans) which is controlled by no single department, discipline, or field of thought. Also, the tenure system, a major component of academic employment and research in the US, serves to ensure that academia is relatively protected from political and financial pressures on thought.

===Qualifications===
The degree awarded for completed study is the primary academic qualification. Typically these are, in order of completion, associate&#x27;s degree, bachelor&#x27;s degree (awarded for completion of undergraduate study), master&#x27;s degree, and doctorate (awarded after graduate or postgraduate study). These are only currently being standardized in Europe as part of the Bologna process, as many different degrees and standards of time to reach each are currently awarded in different countries in Europe. In most fields the majority of academic researchers and teachers have doctorates or other terminal degrees, though in some professional and creative fields it is common for scholars and teachers to have only master&#x27;s degrees.

===Academic conferences===

Closely related to academic publishing is the practice of bringing a number of intellectuals in a field to give talks on their research at an academic conference, often allowing for a wider audience to be exposed to their ideas.

===Conflicting goals===
Within academia, diverse constituent groups have diverse, and sometimes conflicting, goals. In the contemporary academy several of these conflicts are widely distributed and common. A salient example of conflict is that between the goal to improve teaching quality and the goal to reduce costs. The conflicting goals of professional education programs and general education advocates currently are playing out in the negotiation over accreditation standards.
For example, the goals of research for profit and for the sake of knowledge often conflict to some degree.

====Practice and theory====
Putting theory into practice can result in a gap between what is learned in academic settings and how that learning is manifested in practical settings. This is addressed in a number of professional schools such as education and social work, which require students to participate in practica for credit. Students are taught to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Not everyone agrees on the value of theory as opposed to practice. Academics are sometimes criticized as lacking practical experience and thus too insulated from the &#x27;real world,&#x27; and some scholars avoid this criticism by labeling themselves as blue-collar scholars to showcase their past lived experience related to their teaching and research. Academic insularity is colloquially criticized as being &quot;ivory tower&quot;; when used pejoratively, this term is criticized as anti-intellectualism.

To address this split, there is a growing body of practice research, such as the practice-based research network (PBRN) within clinical medical research. Arts and humanities departments debate how to define this emerging research phenomenon. There are a variety of contested models of practice research (practice-as-research, practice-based and practice through research), for example, screen media practice research.

====Nepotism====
Nepotism is frequent in academia where it is frequent for professors to have their partners, and sometimes children, hired by the same faculty in which they work.

====Town and gown====

Universities are often culturally distinct from the towns or cities where they reside. In some cases this leads to discomfort or outright conflict between local residents and members of the university over political, economic, or other issues. Some localities in the Northeastern United States, for instance, have tried to block students from registering to vote as local residents—instead encouraging them to vote by absentee ballot at their primary residence—in order to retain control of local politics. Other issues can include deep cultural and class divisions between local residents and university students. The film &quot;Breaking Away&quot; dramatizes such a conflict.

==Academic publishing==
===History of academic journals===
Among the earliest research journals were the Proceedings of Meetings of the Royal Society in the 17th century. At that time, the act of publishing academic inquiry was controversial, and widely ridiculed. It was not at all unusual for a new discovery to be announced as an anagram, reserving priority for the discoverer, but indecipherable for anyone not in on the secret: both Isaac Newton and Leibniz used this approach. However, this method did not work well. Robert K. Merton, a sociologist, found that 92 percent of cases of simultaneous discovery in the 17th century ended in dispute. The number of disputes dropped to 72 percent in the 18th century, 59 percent by the latter half of the 19th century, and 33 percent by the first half of the 20th century. The decline in contested claims for priority in research discoveries can be credited to the increasing acceptance of the publication of papers in modern academic journals.

The Royal Society was steadfast in its unpopular belief that science could only move forward through a transparent and open exchange of ideas backed by experimental evidence. Many of the experiments were ones that we would not recognize as scientific today—nor were the questions they answered. For example, when the Duke of Buckingham was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Society on June 5, 1661, he presented the Society with a vial of powdered &quot;unicorn horn&quot;. It was a well-accepted &#x27;fact&#x27; that a circle of unicorn&#x27;s horn would act as an invisible cage for any spider. Robert Hooke, the chief experimenter of the Royal Society, emptied the Duke&#x27;s vial into a circle on a table and dropped a spider in the centre of the circle. The spider promptly walked out of the circle and off the table. In its day, this was cutting-edge research.

===Current status and development===
Research journals have been so successful that the number of journals and of papers has proliferated over the past few decades, and the credo of the modern academic has become &quot;publish or perish&quot;. Except for generalist journals such as &quot;Science&quot; or &quot;Nature&quot;, the topics covered in any single journal have tended to be narrow, and readership and citation have declined. A variety of methods for reviewing submissions exist. The most common involves initial approval by the journal, peer review by two or three researchers working in similar or closely related subjects who recommend approval or rejection as well as request error correction, clarification or additions before publishing. Controversial topics may receive additional levels of review. Journals have developed a hierarchy, partly based on reputation but also on the strictness of the review policy. More prestigious journals are more likely to receive and publish more important work. Submitters try to submit their work to the most prestigious journal likely to publish it to bolster their reputation and curriculum vitae.

Andrew Odlyzko, an academician with a large number of published research papers, has argued that research journals will evolve into something akin to Internet forums over the coming decade, by extending the interactivity of current Internet preprints. This change may open them up to a wider range of ideas, some more developed than others. Whether this will be a positive evolution remains to be seen. Some claim that forums, like markets, tend to thrive or fail based on their ability to attract talent. Some believe that highly restrictive and tightly monitored forums may be the least likely to thrive.

==Academic dress==

Gowns have been associated with academia since the birth of the university in the 14th and 15th centuries, perhaps because most early scholars were priests or church officials. Over time, the gowns worn by degree-holders have become standardized to some extent, although traditions in individual countries and even institutions have established a diverse range of gown styles, and some have ended the custom entirely, even for graduation ceremonies.

At some universities, such as the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, undergraduates may be required to wear gowns on formal occasions and on graduation. Undergraduate gowns are usually a shortened version of a bachelor&#x27;s gown. At other universities, for example, outside the UK or US, the custom is entirely absent. Students at the University of Trinity College at the University of Toronto wear gowns to formal dinner, debates, to student government, and to many other places.

In general, in the US and UK, recipients of a bachelor&#x27;s degree are entitled to wear a simple full-length robe without adornment and a mortarboard cap with a tassel. In addition, holders of a bachelor&#x27;s degree may be entitled to wear a ceremonial hood at some schools. In the US, bachelor&#x27;s hoods are rarely seen. Bachelor&#x27;s hoods are generally smaller versions of those worn by recipients of master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees.

Recipients of a master&#x27;s degree in the US or UK wear a similar cap and gown but closed sleeves with slits, and usually receive a ceremonial hood that hangs down the back of the gown. In the US the hood is traditionally edged with a silk or velvet strip displaying the disciplinary color, and is lined with the university&#x27;s colors.

According to The American Council on Education &quot;six-year specialist degrees (Ed.S., etc.) and other degrees that are intermediate between the master&#x27;s and the doctor&#x27;s degree may have hoods specially designed (1) intermediate in length between the master&#x27;s and doctor&#x27;s hood, (2) with a four-inch velvet border (also intermediate between the widths of the borders of master&#x27;s and doctor&#x27;s hoods), and (3) with color distributed in the usual fashion and according to the usual rules. Cap tassels should be uniformly black.&quot;

Recipients of a doctoral degree tend to have the most elaborate academic dress, and hence there is the greatest diversity at this level. In the US, doctoral gowns are similar to the gowns worn by master&#x27;s graduates, with the addition of velvet stripes across the sleeves and running down the front of the gown which may be tinted with the disciplinary color for the degree received. Holders of a doctoral degree may be entitled or obliged to wear &quot;scarlet&quot; (a special gown in scarlet) on high days and special occasions. While some doctoral graduates wear the mortarboard cap traditional to the lower degree levels, most wear a cap or &quot;Tudor bonnet&quot; that resembles a tam o&#x27;shanter, from which a colored tassel is suspended.

In modern times, in the US and UK, gowns are normally only worn at graduation ceremonies, although some colleges still demand the wearing of academic dress on formal occasions (official banquets and other similar affairs). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was more common to see the dress worn in the classroom, a practice which has now all but disappeared. Two notable exceptions are Oxford and a society at Sewanee, where students are required to wear formal academic dress in the examination room.

<text>Joseph ben Ephraim Karo, also spelled Yosef Caro, or Qaro (; 1488 – March 24, 1575, 13 Nisan 5335 A.M.), was a prominent Sephardic Jewish rabbi renowned as the author of the last great codification of Jewish law, the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;, and its popular analogue, the &quot;Shulhan Arukh&quot;. Karo is regarded as the preeminent halakhic authority of his time, and is often referred to by the honorific titles HaMechaber () and [[Maran]] ().

==Biography==
Joseph Karo was born in Toledo, Spain, in 1488. In 1492, aged four, he was expelled from Spain with his family as a result of the Alhambra Decree and subsequently settled in the Kingdom of Portugal. Following his father&#x27;s death, Karo&#x27;s uncle Isaac, an author of biblical commentary, adopted him. After the expulsion of the Jews from Portugal in 1497, the Ottomans invited the Jews to settle within their empire. Karo went with his parents, after a brief move to Morocco, to Nikopolis, then a city under Ottoman rule. In Nikopol, he received his first instruction from his father, who was himself an eminent Talmudist. He was married twice, firstly to Isaac Saba&#x27;s daughter, and, then after her death, to the daughter of Hayyim Albalag, both of these men being well-known Talmudists.

Between 1520 and 1522 Karo settled at Adrianople. He later settled in the city of Safed, Ottoman Galilee, where he arrived about 1535, having &quot;en route&quot; spent several years at Salonica (1533) and Istanbul. By 1555, Joseph Karo was already a resident of the village Biriyya near Safed, during which year he completed writing the first order of the &quot;Shulhan Arukh&quot;, Orach Chayim.

==Rabbinic career==
For a short while he lived in Nikopol, but decided to make his way to the Land of Israel so that he could immerse himself in its sanctity and complete his written works. Passing through Salonica, he met the great kabbalist Joseph Taitazak. He continued his journey to the Holy Land via Egypt and eventually settled in Safed.

At Safed he met Jacob Berab and was soon appointed a member of his rabbinical court. Berab exerted great influence upon him, and Karo became an enthusiastic supporter of Berab&#x27;s plans for the reinstitution of &quot;semicha&quot; (rabbinical ordination) which had been in abeyance for over 11 centuries. Karo was one of the first he ordained and after Berab&#x27;s death, Karo tried to perpetuate the scheme by ordaining his pupil Moshe Alshich, but he finally gave up his endeavors, convinced that he could not overcome the opposition to ordination. Karo also established a &quot;yeshiva&quot; where he taught Torah to over 200 students.

A Yemenite Jewish traveler, Zechariah (Yaḥya) al-Dhahiri, visited Rabbi Karo&#x27;s &quot;yeshiva&quot; in Safed, in &quot;circa&quot; 1567 CE and wrote of his impressions:

When Jacob Berab died, Karo was regarded as his successor, and together with Rabbi Moshe of Trani he headed the Rabbinical Court of Safed. In fact, by this time, the Rabbinical Court of Safed had become the central rabbinical court in all of Old Yishuv (southern Ottoman Syria), and indeed of the diaspora as well. Thus there was not a single matter of national or global importance that did not come to the attention and ruling of the Safed Beth Din. Its rulings were accepted as final and conclusive, and Karo&#x27;s halachic decisions and clarifications were sought by sages from every corner of the diaspora. Rabbi Joseph Karo was also visited in Safed by the great Egyptian scholars of his day, Rabbi David ibn Abi Zimra and Rabbi Yaakov Castro. He came to be regarded as the leader of the entire generation.

In a dramatic testimonial, Rabbi Shlomo Alkabetz testified that in Salonica, Karo had become one of the rare individuals who merited to be instructed by a &quot;maggid&quot;—a private angelic teacher who revealed to him many kabbalistic teachings. The maggid exhorted Karo to sanctify and purify himself, and he revealed to him events that would take place in the future. In &quot;Shaarei Kedusha&quot;, Rabbi Chaim Vital explains that visitation by a maggid is a form of Divine Inspiration (ruach hakodesh). The teachings of the maggid are recorded in his published work titled &quot;Maggid Meisharim&quot;, although Rabbi Chaim Joseph David Azulai notes that only about one fiftieth of the manuscript was ever published, (see Works). However, in numerous places in &quot;Maggid Meisharim&quot; it is stated that, &quot;I am the Mishna that speaks in your mouth,&quot; indicating that the Oral Torah itself (of which the Mishna is the fundamental part) spoke within him. (However, these two explanations are not necessarily contradictory—in the merit of the Mishna Karo constantly reviewed, he was worthy of an angelic teacher).

The Maggid promised him that he would have the merit of settling in the Land of Israel, and this promise was fulfilled. Another promise, that he would merit to die a martyr&#x27;s death sanctifying God&#x27;s Name like Rabbi Shlomo Molcho had merited, did not transpire for an unspecified reason.

His reputation during the last thirty years of his life was greater than that of almost any other rabbi since Maimonides. The Italian Azariah dei Rossi, though his views differed widely from Karo&#x27;s, collected money among the rich Italian Jews for the purpose of having a work of Karo&#x27;s printed; and Moses Isserles compelled the recognition of one of Karo&#x27;s decisions at Kraków, although he had questions on the ruling.

When some members of the community of Carpentras, France, believed themselves to have been unjustly treated by the majority in a matter relating to taxes, they appealed to Karo, whose letter was sufficient to restore to them their rights (Rev. Etudes Juives 18:133–136). In the East, Karo&#x27;s authority was, if possible, even greater. His name heads the decree of excommunication directed against Daud, Joseph Nasi&#x27;s agent; and it was Karo who commissioned Elisha Gallico to draw up a decree to be distributed among all Jews, ordering that Dei Rossi&#x27;s &quot;Me&#x27;or &#x27;Enayim&quot; be burned. But, Karo dying before it was ready for him to sign, the decree was not promulgated, and the rabbis of Mantua contented themselves with forbidding the reading of the work by Jews under twenty-five years of age. Several funeral orations delivered on that occasion have been preserved (Moses Albelda, &quot;Darash Mosheh&quot;; Samuel Katzenellenbogen, &quot;Derashot&quot;), as well as some elegies from Karo&#x27;s passing.

==Published works==

Karo&#x27;s literary works are considered among the masterpieces of rabbinic literature. He published during his lifetime:
* &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; (בית יוסף), a commentary on &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, the current work of Jewish law in his days. In this commentary Karo shows an astounding mastery over the Talmud and the legalistic literature of the Middle Ages. He felt called upon to systematize the laws and customs of Judaism in face of the disintegration caused by the Spanish expulsion.
* &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; (שולחן ערוך), a condensation of his decisions in &quot;Beth Yosef&quot;. Finished in 1555, this code was published in four parts in 1565.
* &quot;Kessef Mishneh&quot; (כסף משנה) (written in Nikopol, published Venice, 1574–75), a commentary of &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; by Maimonides. In the introduction, Karo writes that his goal was to quote the source of each law in the Mishneh Torah, and to defend the work from the criticisms of the Ravad, Rabbi Abraham ben David.

After his death there appeared:
* &quot;Bedek ha-Bayit&quot; (בדק הבית) (Salonica, 1605), supplements and corrections to &quot;Beth Yosef&quot;;
* &quot;Kelalei ha-Talmud&quot; (כללי התלמוד) (Salonica, 1598), on the methodology of the Talmud;
* &quot;Avkath Rochel&quot; (אבקת רוכל) (Salonica, 1791), Responsa
* &quot;Maggid Meisharim&quot; (מגיד מישרים) (Lublin, 1646), and supplements (Venice, 1646)
* &quot;Derashot&quot; (דרשות) (Salonica, 1799), speeches, in the collection &#x27;Oz Tzaddikim&#x27;.

===&quot;Maggid Meisharim&quot;===

The &quot;Maggid Meisharim&quot; (1646, &quot;Preacher of Righteousness&quot;) is a mystical diary in which Karo during a period of fifty years recorded the nocturnal visits of an angelic being, his heavenly mentor, the personified Mishna (the authoritative collection of Jewish Oral Law). His visitor spurred him to acts of righteousness and even asceticism, exhorted him to study the Kabbala, and reproved him for moral laxities.

==Burial place==
He is buried in Old Cemetery of Safed.

Other notable rabbis also buried in Old Cemetery of Safed:
* Ari HaKadosh
* Alshich Hakadosh
* Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz
* Moses ben Jacob Cordovero

<doc id="149175" wikidata="Q216204" url="?curid=149175" title="Fruits Basket">
<text>, sometimes abbreviated , is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Natsuki Takaya. It was serialized in the semi-monthly Japanese manga magazine , published by Hakusensha, from 1998 to 2006. The series&#x27; title comes from the name of a popular game played in Japanese elementary schools, which is alluded to in the series.

&quot;Fruits Basket&quot; tells the story of Tohru Honda, an orphan girl who, after meeting Yuki, Kyo, and Shigure Sohma, learns that 13 members of the Sohma family are possessed by the animals of the Chinese zodiac and are cursed to turn into their animal forms when they are weak, stressed, or when they are embraced by anyone of the opposite gender who is not possessed by a spirit of the zodiac. As the series progresses, Tohru learns of the hardships and pain faced by the afflicted members of the Sohma family, and through her own generous and loving nature, helps heal their emotional wounds. As she learns more about Yuki, Kyo, and the rest of the mysterious Sohma family, Tohru also learns more about herself and how much others care for her.

Takaya began a sequel titled &quot;Fruits Basket Another&quot; in September 2015, and the spin-off series &quot;The Three Musketeers Arc&quot; in April 2019. The original manga was first adapted into a 26-episode anime television series in 2001, produced by Studio Deen and directed by Akitaro Daichi. A second anime television series adaptation, by TMS Entertainment and directed by Yoshihide Ibata, premiered from April 2019, with its first season airing from April to September 2019, its second season airing from April to September 2020, and its third and final season airing from April to June 2021. The reboot anime series was initially a co-production of Funimation, who released the series through a partnership with Crunchyroll, although the series would later be completely moved under the latter. A compilation film titled &quot;Fruits Basket: Prelude&quot; premiered theatrically in Japan in February 2022, and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada in June 2022 and in the United Kingdom in July 2022.

By December 2018, the manga had over 30 million copies in circulation, making it one of the best-selling manga series, as well as one of the best-selling &quot;shōjo manga&quot; series of all time. It has been described in academic works as &quot;a classic fan favorite in shoujo manga around the world&quot;.

== Plot ==
When high school student Tohru Honda&#x27;s mother dies in a car accident, Tohru is taken in by her grandfather. A few months later, her grandfather decides to remodel his house and asks Tohru if she can stay with one of her friends until it is finished. Not wanting to impose on her two best friends, Tohru buys a tent and begins living in a forest near her school.

While exploring one day, Tohru discovers a nearby home where her popular classmate Yuki Sohma lives with his cousin Shigure. Soon after, a landslide destroys her tent and the Sohmas invite Tohru to move into their house. As Yuki and Shigure show Tohru her new room, they are interrupted by Kyo Sohma, Yuki and Shigure&#x27;s cousin, who crashes through the ceiling and challenges Yuki to a fight.

Tohru tries to stop him, and—accidentally falling into him—causes him to transform into a cat in front of her, discovering the Sohma family curse; that twelve members of the family, excluding Kyo, are possessed by the spirits of the , and turn into their zodiac animal when they are weak, under stress, embarrassed, or when hugged by someone of the opposite gender. Kyo is possessed by the cat who was excluded from the zodiac, and is cursed to be similarly bullied and abused by the clan.

When Tohru discovers the Sohma family secret, she promises not to tell anyone, and is allowed to keep living with them. Although the Sohma curse stretches far deeper and darker than Tohru initially thinks, her presence and her acceptance of them soon become a large, positive influence on those possessed by the zodiac. She sets out to break the curse and, on the way, meets and discovers the Sohma&#x27;s vengeful zodiac spirits, including their leader, Akito, who occupies the position of &quot;God&quot; in the Chinese legend, and who both keeps the family together and chains them to their spirits.

== Production ==
The title of the series is taken from a children&#x27;s game, , in which the participants sit in a circle, and the leader of the game names each person after a type of fruit; when the name of a child&#x27;s fruit is called, that child gets up and has to find a new seat. When the protagonist, Tohru Honda, first plays this game in kindergarten, she is not given a fruit, and is instead assigned &quot;&quot; by her classmates, who do not want her to play. However, Tohru, thinking that are delicious, does not realise that her classmates are intentionally leaving her out of the game; once the game is finished, and all of the children but Tohru have been called, Tohru realizes that are not a type of fruit at all, and she realizes that she does not belong.

Tohru comes to associate this game with the Sohma family, and that she does not fit in among them any more than an does in a basket of fruit. In volume 1 of the manga, after Yuki and Kyo bring Tohru home from her grandfather&#x27;s house, she begins to feel like she belongs with the Sohma family; after this, she imagines herself as a child hearing called in the game, symbolizing that she has finally found her place.

Natsuki Takaya named most of the twelve Sohmas cursed by zodiac animals after archaic names of month in the former Japanese lunisolar calendar that correspond to their zodiac animal. The exceptions are Kureno and Momiji, whose names were swapped by mistake; Kyo, as the cat, is not part of the official zodiac, and so does not follow these naming conventions. Yuki&#x27;s name also does not follow this naming convention, since Takaya came up with it before deciding the other names.

== Reception ==
=== Manga ===
The &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; manga series is one of the top manga series in both Japan and in the US. More than 18 million copies have been sold in Japan, and 30 million copies worldwide. It is Tokyopop&#x27;s best selling manga series, with more than 2 million copies sold by 2006. The fifteenth volume of the English release rose to the fifteenth position on the USA Today Top 150 Bestselling Books, which is the highest position ever achieved by a volume of manga in the United States. The eighteenth volume debuted at the top of the Nielsen BookScan sales list, while the nineteenth volume was the second bestselling graphic novel in March 2008. Despite a slow manga market, &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; remained the second highest overall selling manga series among the Bookscan companies in 2007. The final volume of the English adaptation was a &quot;New York Times&quot; manga bestseller from 28 June through 25 July, moving from second to first in the list in the week of 19–25 July. The volume dropped back down to second place the following week, then dropped to fourth place in the week of 8 August. The final volume remained on the best seller list for 12 weeks.

The &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; manga received the 2001 Kodansha Manga Award in the shōjo manga category, and the &quot;Best Manga&quot; award at the 2007 American Anime Awards.

Critics have praised the overall story in &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; as being intellectual, with even the relatively light-hearted first volume giving hints at something darker in the background that makes the reader &quot;question everything that happens.&quot; Some felt the series was getting close to overloading readers with angst in later volumes, and questioned the credulity of the sheer number of bad parents in the series. As one reviewer noted: &quot;in the world of &quot;Fruits Basket&quot;, good parents are as common as penguins in the Sahara—every single one is either neglectful, smothering, unfeeling, abusive, misguided, or dead.&quot;

Takaya&#x27;s artwork in particular has been praised by critics, with Takaya&#x27;s skills in detailed art, shadowing, and shading lauded as able to convey the character&#x27;s moods and emotions without the character having any dialogue at all.

In &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson gave the manga three and a half out of four stars. While finding the series to be &quot;surprisingly sad&quot; and praising the well-defined characters, he felt the series was &quot;neither particularly well drawn nor incredibly witty&quot;. As a whole, he considered it &quot;a fascinating manga, like a sweet, melancholy dream.&quot; A factor in the success of &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; in English-speaking countries was that the books were being sold in bookstores, rather than comic book shops, which are considered to be a predominantly male domain.

=== Anime ===
The first &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; anime adaptation has also been well received, ranking third in Anihabara&#x27;s list of top televised anime series in Japan for February 2002. In the June 2002 issue of &quot;Animage&quot; magazine, the series was first in a list of the best twenty anime series in Japan. In 2001, the &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; anime won an &quot;Animage&quot;″s Anime Grand Prix award. In 2006, five years after the series finished airing in Japan, it was 93rd in TV Asahi&#x27;s list of Japan&#x27;s 100 favorite animated TV series. &quot;Animerica&quot; reviewers felt the anime adaptation was similar to &quot;Ranma ½&quot; in terms of premise and its using a similar musical score. Julie Davis found the characters to be &quot;superficially pretty&quot; and &quot;so-clean-they-look-almost-like-paper-cutouts&quot; with &quot;really, really gigantic eyes&quot;, though she notes that the animal alter forms of the zodiac members were &quot;cute and cuddly&quot;. Fellow reviewer Urian Brown disagreed, stating that &quot;the characters are designed in a sleek stylish manner that is classy&quot; and felt the animation was &quot;refined&quot;. Though it only covers part of the manga, critics felt the ending brought the story to a good stopping point while making it clear that there was much left for the Sohma and Tohru to deal with, including the curse and Tohru&#x27;s future choice between Kyo and Yuki. Though some felt the plot was lacking in development, they also praised the series for the strength of its character relationships. Allen Divers of Anime News Network called the series a &quot;true emotional roller coaster&quot; which hides &quot;truly deep and heartfelt drama&quot; behind humor, adding that the show explores many &quot;aspects of emotion.&quot;

In April 2005, Funimation Entertainment started a project calling for convention attendees to help them fold 1,000 origami paper cranes. In Japanese folklore, folding 1,000 paper cranes would grant someone a wish. When they had at least 1,000 cranes, Funimation sent the cranes and pictures of the events to Studio Deen and Hakusensha to try to convince the company to produce a second season of the &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; anime. Fans successfully folded the required 1,000 cranes by the end of the 2005 convention season, starting at least a 13-year gap that culminated in the announcement of the new &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; anime in 2018.

The 2019 version has also received positive reception. &quot;Thrillist&quot; listed the 2019 &quot;Fruits Basket&quot; series among the best anime of the 2010s. In February 2022, &quot;Fruits Basket: The Final&quot; won the &quot;Anime of the Year&quot; award during the 8th Anime Trending Awards.

<doc id="149176" wikidata="Q822206" url="?curid=149176" title="Shulchan Aruch">
<text>The Shulchan Aruch ( , literally: &quot;Set Table&quot;), often dubbed in English as the Code of Jewish Law, is the most widely consulted of the various legal codes in Judaism. It was authored in Safed, Ottoman Syria (today in Israel) by Joseph Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of halakha or Jewish law ever written.

The halachic rulings in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; generally follow Sephardic law and customs, whereas Ashkenazi Jews generally follow the halachic rulings of Moses Isserles, whose glosses to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; note where the Sephardic and Ashkenazi customs differ. These glosses are widely referred to as the &quot;mappah&quot; (literally: the &quot;tablecloth&quot;) to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Set Table&quot;. Almost all published editions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; include this gloss, and the term &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; has come to denote &quot;both&quot; Karo&#x27;s work as well as Isserles&#x27;, with Karo usually referred to as &quot;the &quot;Mekhaber&quot;&quot; (, &quot;author&quot;) and Isserles as &quot;the Rema&quot; (an acronym of Rabbi Moshe Isserles).

Due to the increased availability of the printing press, the 16th century was an era of legal codification in Poland, the Ottoman Empire and other countries. Previously unwritten laws and customs were being compiled and recorded; the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; was one such compilation. In the century after it was published by Karo (whose vision was a unified Judaism under the Sephardic traditions) it became the code of law for Ashkenazim, together with the later commentaries of Moses Isserles and the 17th century Polish rabbis.

==Structure==

The &quot;Shulhan Arukh&quot; (and its forerunner, the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;) follow the same structure as &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; by Jacob ben Asher. There are four volumes, each subdivided into many chapters and paragraphs:

#Orach Chayim – laws of prayer and synagogue, Sabbath, holidays
#Yoreh De&#x27;ah – laws of kashrut; conversion to Judaism; mourning; laws pertaining to Israel; niddah
#Even Ha&#x27;ezer – laws of marriage, divorce and related issues
#Choshen Mishpat – laws of finance, financial responsibility, damages (personal and financial), and the rules of the beth din, as well as the laws of witnesses

===Page layout===
In the aside page, Karo&#x27;s and Isserles&#x27; combined text is in the center of the page, top; since the 17th century, the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; has been printed with Isserles&#x27; annotations in small Rashi print—and indicated by a preceding &quot;הגה&quot;—interspersed with Karo&#x27;s text. 
Surrounding this are the primary commentators for the section: 
*on Orach Chayim, &quot;Magen Avraham&quot; and &quot;Taz&quot;
*on Yoreh De&#x27;ah, &quot;Shakh&quot; and &quot;Taz&quot;
*on Even Ha&#x27;ezer, &quot;Beit Shmuel&quot; and &quot;Chelkat Mechokek&quot;
*on Choshen Mishpat, &quot;Shakh&quot; and &quot;Me&#x27;irat Einayim&quot;
On the margins are various other commentaries and cross references; see below. 
As commentaries on the work proliferated more sophisticated printing styles became required, similar to those of the Talmud.Additionally, many recent publishers have reformatted this work with the intent to make it more accessible to the reader.

==Beit Yosef==
===Its premise and style===

The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; is largely based on an earlier work by Karo, titled &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;. Although the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; is largely a codification of the rulings of the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;, it includes various rulings that are not mentioned at all in the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;, because after completing the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;, Karo read opinions in books he hadn&#x27;t seen before, which he then included in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. In his famous methodological work &quot;Yad Malachi&quot;, Malachi ben Jacob HaKohen  cites a later halachic authority (Shmuel Abuhab) who reports rumors that the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; was a summary of Karo&#x27;s earlier rulings in Beit Yosef which he then gave to certain of his students to edit and compile. He concludes that this would then account for those seemingly self-contradictory instances in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;.

===The standard authorities===
Karo initially intended to rely on his own judgment regarding differences of opinion between the various authorities, especially where he could support his own view based on the Talmud. But he wrote that he abandoned this idea because: &quot;Who has the courage to rear his head aloft among mountains, the heights of God?&quot; Hence Karo adopted the &quot;Halakhot&quot; of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi (the &quot;Rif&quot;), Maimonides (the &quot;Rambam&quot;), and Asher ben Jehiel (the &quot;Rosh&quot;) as his standards, accepting as authoritative the opinion of two of the three, except in cases where most of the ancient authorities were against them or in cases where there was already an accepted custom contrary to his ruling. The net result of these last exceptions is that in a number of cases Karo rules in favour of the Catalan school of Nahmanides and Shlomo ibn Aderet (&quot;the Rashba&quot;), thus indirectly reflecting Ashkenazi opinions, even against the consensus of Alfasi and Maimonides. Karo very often decides disputed cases without necessarily considering the age and importance of the authority in question, expressing simply his own views. He follows Maimonides&#x27; example, as seen in Mishneh Torah, rather than that of Jacob ben Asher, who seldom decides between ancient authorities.

Several reasons induced Karo to connect his work with the &quot;Tur&quot;, instead of Maimonides&#x27; code.
* The &quot;Tur&quot;, although not considered as great an authority as Maimonides&#x27; code, was much more widely known; the latter being recognized only among the Spanish Jews, while the former enjoyed a high reputation among the Ashkenazim and Sephardim, as well as the Italian Jews.
* Karo intended to give not merely the results of his investigations (as Maimonides&#x27; code did), but also the investigations themselves. He wished not only to aid the officiating rabbi in the performance of his duties, but also to trace for the student the development of particular laws from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature.
* Unlike the Tur, Maimonides&#x27; code includes all fields of Jewish law, of both present-day relevance and those dealing with prior and future times (such as laws of sacrifices, Messiah, Kings, etc.). For Karo, whose interest lay in ruling on the practical issues, the Tur seemed a better choice.

==Moses Isserles==
The &quot;Rema&quot; (Moses Isserles) started writing his commentary on the Arba&#x27;ah Turim, Darkhei Moshe, at about the same time as Yosef Karo. Karo finished his work &quot;Bet Yosef&quot; first, and it was first presented to the Rema as a gift from one of his students. Upon receiving the gift, the Rema could not understand how he had spent so many years unaware of Karo&#x27;s efforts. After looking through the Bet Yosef, the Rema realized that Karo had mainly relied upon Sephardic poskim.

In place of Karo&#x27;s three standard authorities, Isserles cites &quot;the later authorities&quot; (chiefly based on the works of Yaakov Moelin, Israel Isserlein and Israel Bruna, together with the Franco-German Tosafists) as criteria of opinion. While the &quot;Rosh&quot; on many occasions based his decision on these sources, Isserles gave them more prominence in developing practical legal rulings. By incorporating these other opinions, Isserles actually addressed some major criticisms regarding what many viewed as the arbitrary selection of the three authorities upon whose opinions Karo based his work.

After realizing this, the Rema shortened his work on the &quot;Tur&quot;, entitled Darkhei Moshe, to focus only on rulings which differ from &quot;Bet Yosef&quot;.

The halachic rulings in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; generally follow the Sephardic custom. The Rema added his glosses and published them as a commentary on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, specifying whenever the Sephardic and Ashkenazic customs differ. These glosses are sometimes referred to as the &quot;mappah&quot;, literally, the &#x27;tablecloth,&#x27; to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&#x27;s&quot; &#x27;Set Table.&#x27; Almost all published editions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; include this gloss.

The importance of the &quot;minhag&quot; (&quot;prevailing local custom&quot;) is also a point of dispute between Karo and Isserles: while Karo held fast to original authorities and material reasons, Isserles considered the &quot;minhag&quot; as an object of great importance, and not to be omitted in a codex. This point, especially, induced Isserles to write his glosses to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, that the customs (&quot;minhagim&quot;) of the Ashkenazim might be recognized, and not be set aside through Karo&#x27;s reputation.

==Reception==

Karo wrote the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; in his old age, for the benefit of those who did not possess the education necessary to understand the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;. The format of this work parallels that adopted by Jacob ben Asher in his &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;, but more concisely; without citing sources.

&quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; has been &quot;the code&quot; of Rabbinical Judaism for all ritual and legal questions that arose after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem; see and re its contemporary function and status. The author himself had no very high opinion of the work, remarking that he had written it chiefly for &quot;young students&quot;. He never refers to it in his responsa, but always to the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot;. The &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; achieved its reputation and popularity not only against the wishes of the author, but, perhaps, through the very scholars who criticized it.

Recognition or denial of Karo&#x27;s authority lay entirely with the Polish Talmudists. German Jewish authorities had been forced to give way to Polish ones as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century. Karo had already been opposed by several Sephardic contemporaries, Yom Tov Tzahalon, who designated the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; as a book for &quot;children and ignoramuses&quot;, and Jacob Castro, whose work &quot;Erekh ha-Shulchan&quot; consists of critical glosses to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. Moses Isserles and Maharshal were Karo&#x27;s first important adversaries in Eastern Europe. Further in response to those who wished to force the rulings of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; upon those communities following Rambam, Karo wrote:

Similarly, many later halachic authorities predicated the acceptance of the authority of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; on the lack of an existing and widely accepted custom to the contrary. Eventually though, the rulings of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; became the accepted standard not only in Europe and the diaspora, but even in the land of Israel where they had previously followed other authorities.

===Criticism by Karo&#x27;s contemporaries===

Following its initial appearance, many rabbis criticised the appearance of this latest code of Jewish law, echoing similar criticisms of previous codes of law.

====Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel====

Rabbi Judah Loew ben Bezalel (known as &quot;Maharal&quot;, 1520–1609) wrote:

====Rabbi Shmuel Eidels====
Samuel Eidels (known as the &quot;Maharsha&quot;, 1555–1631), criticized those who rule directly from the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; without being fully conversant with the Talmudic source(s) of the ruling: &quot;In these generations, those who rule from the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; without knowing the reasoning and Talmudic basis ... are among the &#x27;destroyers of the world&#x27; and should be protested.&quot;

====Rabbi Yoel Sirkis====
Another prominent critic of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; was Joel Sirkis (1561–1640), rabbi and author of a commentary to the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; entitled the &quot;New House&quot; (, commonly abbreviated as the &quot;Bach&quot; ), and Meir Lublin, author of the commentary on the Bach entitled the &quot;Shut HaBach&quot; (): 

====Other criticisms====
The strongest criticism against all such codes of Jewish law is the contention that they inherently violate the principle that halakha must be decided according to the &quot;later&quot; sages; this principle is commonly known as &quot;hilkheta ke-vatra&#x27;ei&quot; (&quot;the &quot;halakha&quot; follows the later ones&quot;).

A modern commentator, Menachem Elon explains:


The controversy itself may explain why the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; became an authoritative code, despite significant opposition, and even against the will of its author, while Maimonides&#x27; (1135–1204) Mishneh Torah rulings were not necessarily accepted as binding among the Franco-German Jews, perhaps owing to the criticism and influence of Abraham ibn Daud (known as the &quot;Ravad&quot;, 1110–1180). The answer may lie in the fact that the criticism by ibn Daud undermined confidence in Maimonides&#x27; work, while Isserles (who corresponded with Karo) does not simply criticize, but supplements Karo&#x27;s work extensively. The result was that Ashkenazim accepted the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, assuming that together with Isserles&#x27; glosses it was a reliable authority. This then became broadly accepted among Jewish communities around the world as the binding Jewish legal code.

===Praise===

The later major halachic authorities defer to both Karo and Isserles and cite their work as the baseline from which further halachic rulings evolve. The 17th-century scholar Joshua Höschel ben Joseph wrote,
Jonathan Eybeschutz (d. 1764) wrote that the great breadth of the work would make it impossible to constantly come to the correct conclusion if not for the &quot;spirit of God&quot;. Therefore, says Eybeschutz, one cannot rely on a view not presented by the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. Yehuda Heller Kahana (d. 1819) also said that was the reason one cannot rely on a view not formulated in the &quot;Shulchan Jewry.

==Major commentaries==
A large body of commentaries have appeared on the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, beginning soon after its publication. The first major gloss, &quot;Hagahot&quot; by Moses Isserles, was published shortly after the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; appeared. Isserles&#x27; student, Yehoshua Falk HaKohen published &quot;Sefer Me&#x27;irath Enayim&quot; (on &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Sema&quot;) several decades after the main work. Important works by the later authorities (&quot;acharonim&quot;) include but are not limited to:
* &quot;Magen Avraham&quot; (&quot;Abraham&#x27;s shield&quot;) by Avraham Gombiner (on &quot;Orach Chayim&quot;)
* &quot;Turei Zahav&quot; (&quot;Rows of Gold&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Taz&quot;) by David HaLevi Segal (on &quot;Orach Chayim, Yoreh Deah and Even ha-Ezer&quot;)
* &quot;Siftei Khohen&quot; (&quot;Lips of the priest&quot;, abbreviated as &quot;Shach&quot;) by Shabbatai HaKohen (on &quot;Yoreh Deah&quot; and &quot;Choshen Mishpat&quot;)
* &quot;Beit Sh&#x27;muel&quot; by Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus and &quot;Chelkat Mechokek&quot; by Moses ben Isaac Judah Lima (on &quot;Even ha-Ezer&quot;)
* &quot;Ba&#x27;er Heiteiv&quot; (&quot;Well-Explained&quot;) by Judah Ashkenazi and Zechariah Mendel ben Aryeh Leib
* &quot;Peri Chadash&quot; (&quot;New Fruit&quot;) by Hezekiah da Silva
* &quot;Peri Megadim&quot; (&quot;Choice Fruit&quot;) by Joseph ben Meir Teomim
* &quot;Shaarei Teshuvah&quot; (&quot;Entry to Responsa&quot;) by Hayyim Mordecai Margolioth
* &quot;Machatzit HaShekel&quot; (&quot;Half-Shekel&quot;) by Samuel Loew

While these major commentaries enjoy widespread acceptance, some early editions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; were self-published (primarily in the late 17th and early 18th centuries) with commentaries by various rabbis, although these commentaries never achieved significant recognition.

A wealth of later works include commentary and exposition by such halachic authorities as the &quot;Ketzoth ha-Choshen&quot; and &quot;Avnei Millu&#x27;im&quot;, &quot;Netivoth ha-Mishpat&quot;, the Vilna Gaon, Rabbi Yechezkel Landau (&quot;Dagul Mervavah&quot;), Rabbis Akiva Eger, Moses Sofer, and Chaim Joseph David Azulai (&quot;Birkei Yosef&quot;) whose works are widely recognized and cited extensively in later halachic literature.

In particular, Mishnah Berurah (which summarizes and decides amongst the later authorities) on the Orach Chaim section of &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; has achieved widespread acceptance. It is frequently even studied as a stand-alone commentary, since it is assumed to discuss all or most of the views of the major commentaries on the topics that it covers. Kaf Ha&#x27;Chaim is a similar Sephardic work. See further below re these type of works. 

Several commentaries are printed on each page. &quot;Be&#x27;er ha-Golah&quot;, by Rabbi Moshe Rivkash, provides cross-references to the Talmud, other law codes, commentaries, and responsa, and thereby indicates the various sources for &quot;Halachic&quot; decisions. &quot;Beiur HaGra&quot;, by the &quot;Vilna Gaon&quot; as mentioned, traces the underlying machloket (deliberation), including how it eventually plays out, and evaluates this practice in light of the various opinions of &quot;rishonim&quot; here.

==Later collations==
In the late 18th century, there were several attempts to recompile the major halakhic opinions into a simpler, more accessible form.

Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi wrote a &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; at the behest of the Hasidic leader, Rabbi Dovber of Mezeritch. To distinguish this work from Karo&#x27;s, it is generally referred to as &quot;Shulchan Aruch HaRav&quot;. Rabbi Abraham Danzig was the first in the Lithuanian Jewish community to attempt a summary of the opinions in the above-mentioned works in his &quot;Chayei Adam&quot; and &quot;Chochmath Adam&quot;. Similar works are &quot;Ba&#x27;er Heitev&quot; and &quot;Sha&#x27;arei Teshuvah&quot;/&quot;Pitchei Teshuvah&quot; (usually published as commentaries in most editions of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;), as well as &quot;Kitzur Shulchan Aruch&quot; (by Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried of Hungary). Danzig&#x27;s and Ganzfried&#x27;s works do not follow the structure of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, but given their single-voiced approach, are considered easier to follow for those with less background in halacha.

The &quot;Mishna Berura&quot;, the main work of &quot;halakha&quot; by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (the &quot;Chafetz Chaim&quot;) is a collation of the opinions of later authorities on the &quot;Orach Chayim&quot; section of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. &quot;Aruch HaShulchan&quot;, by Rabbi Yechiel Michel Epstein, is a more analytical work attempting the same task from a different angle, and covering all sections of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;. The former, though narrower in scope, enjoys much wider popularity and is considered authoritative by many adherents of Orthodox Judaism, especially among those typically associated with Ashkenazic &quot;yeshivas&quot;. The &quot;Ben Ish Chai&quot;, &quot;Kaf Ha&#x27;Chaim&quot;, and much more recently, the Yalkut Yosef are similar works by Sephardic Rabbis for their communities.

==Halacha Yomit==
Sections of the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; are studied in many Jewish schools throughout the world on a daily basis. There is also a daily study program known as the Halacha Yomit.

<text>Millennials, also known as Generation Y or Gen Y, are the demographic cohort following Generation X and preceding Generation Z. Researchers and popular media use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years, with the generation typically being defined as people born from 1981 to 1996. Most millennials are the children of Baby Boomers and older Generation X. In turn, most millennials are often the parents of Generation Alpha.

As the first generation to grow up with the Internet, millennials have been described as the first global generation. The generation is generally marked by elevated usage of and familiarity with the Internet, mobile devices, social media, and technology in general. The term &quot;digital natives&quot;, which is now also applied to successive generations, was originally coined to describe this generation. Between the 1990s and 2010s, people from developing countries became increasingly well-educated, a factor that boosted economic growth in these countries. In contrast, millennials across the world have suffered significant economic disruption since starting their working lives, with many facing high levels of youth unemployment in the wake of the Great Recession and the COVID-19 recession.

Millennials, in the US, have been called the &quot;Unluckiest Generation&quot; as the average millennial has experienced slower economic growth and more recessions since entering the workforce than any other generation in history. They have also been weighed down by student debt and childcare costs. Across the globe, millennials and subsequent generations have postponed marriage or living together as a couple. Millennials were born at a time of declining fertility rates around the world, and continue to have fewer children than their predecessors. Those in developing countries will continue to constitute the bulk of global population growth. In developed countries, young people of the 2010s were less inclined to have sex compared to their predecessors when they were the same age. Millennials in the West are less likely to be religious than their predecessors, but may identify as spiritual.

==Terminology and etymology==
Members of this demographic cohort are known as millennials because the oldest became adults around the turn of the millennium. Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe, known for creating the Strauss–Howe generational theory, are widely credited with naming the millennials. They coined the term in 1987, around the time children born in 1982 were entering kindergarten, and the media were first identifying their prospective link to the impending new millennium as the high school graduating class of 2000. They wrote about the cohort in their books &quot;Generations: The History of America&#x27;s Future, 1584 to 2069&quot; (1991) and &quot;Millennials Rising: The Next Great Generation&quot; (2000).

In August 1993, an &quot;Advertising Age&quot; editorial coined the phrase &quot;Generation Y&quot; to describe teenagers of the day, then aged 13–19 (born 1974–1980), who were at the time defined as different from Generation X. However, the 1974–1980 cohort was later re-identified by most media sources as the last wave of Generation X, and by 2003 &quot;Ad Age&quot; had moved their Generation Y starting year up to 1982. According to journalist Bruce Horovitz, in 2012, &quot;Ad Age&quot; &quot;threw in the towel by conceding that Millennials is a better name than Gen Y,&quot; and by 2014, a past director of data strategy at &quot;Ad Age&quot; said to NPR &quot;the Generation Y label was a placeholder until we found out more about them.&quot;

Millennials are sometimes called &quot;Echo Boomers&quot;, due to them often being the offspring of the Baby Boomers, the significant increase in birth rates from the early 1980s to mid-1990s, and their generation&#x27;s large size relative to that of Boomers. In the United States, the echo boom&#x27;s birth rates peaked in August 1990 and a twentieth-century trend toward smaller families in developed countries continued. Psychologist Jean Twenge described millennials as &quot;Generation Me&quot; in her 2006 book &quot;Generation Me: Why Today&#x27;s Young Americans Are More Confident, Assertive, Entitled – and More Miserable Than Ever Before&quot;, while in 2013, &quot;Time&quot; magazine ran a titled &quot;Millennials: The Me Me Me Generation&quot;. Alternative names for this group proposed include the &quot;Net Generation&quot;, &quot;Generation 9/11&quot;, &quot;Generation Next&quot;, and &quot;The Burnout Generation&quot;.

==Date and age range definitions==
Oxford Living Dictionaries describes a millennial as a person &quot;born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s.&quot; Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines millennial as &quot;a person born in the 1980s or 1990s&quot;. More detailed definitions in use are as follows:

Jonathan Rauch, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, wrote for &quot;The Economist&quot; in 2018 that &quot;generations are squishy concepts&quot;, but the 1981 to 1996 birth cohort is a &quot;widely accepted&quot; definition for millennials. Reuters also state that the &quot;widely accepted definition&quot; is 1981–1996.

The Pew Research Center defines millennials as the people born from 1981 to 1996, choosing these dates for &quot;key political, economic and social factors&quot;, including the 11 September terrorist attacks, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Great Recession, and Internet explosion. The United States Library of Congress explains that date ranges are &#x27;subjective&#x27; and the traits of each cohort are generalized based around common economic, social, or political factors that happened during formative years. They acknowledge disagreements, complaints over date ranges, generation names, and the overgeneralized &quot;personality&quot; of each generation. They suggest that marketers and journalists use the different groupings to target their marketing to particular age groups. However, they cite Pew&#x27;s 1981–1996 definition to define millennials. Various media outlets and statistical organizations have cited Pew&#x27;s definition including &quot;Time&quot; magazine, BBC News, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, and Statistics Canada.

The Brookings Institution defines the millennial generation as people born from 1981 to 1996, as does Gallup, Federal Reserve Board, and the American Psychological Association. Encyclopædia Britannica defines millennials as &quot;the term used to describe a person born between 1981 and 1996, though different sources can vary by a year or two.&quot; Although the United States Census Bureau have said that &quot;there is no official start and end date for when millennials were born&quot; and they do not officially define millennials, a U.S. Census publication in 2022 noted that millennials are &quot;colloquially defined as the cohort born from 1981 to 1996&quot;, using this definition in a breakdown of Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics uses the years 1981 to 1995 to define millennials in a 2021 Census report. A report by Ipsos MORI describes the term &#x27;Millennials&#x27; as a working title for the circa 15-year birth cohort born around 1980 to 1995, which has &#x27;unique, defining traits&#x27;. Governmental institutions such as the UK Department of Health and Social Care have also used 1980 to 1995. Psychologist Jean Twenge defines millennials as those born from 1980 to 1994. Likewise, Australia&#x27;s McCrindle Research uses the years 1980 to 1994 as Generation Y (millennial) birth years.

A 2023 report by the Population Reference Bureau defines millennials as those born from 1981 to 1999. CNN reports that studies sometimes define millennials as born between 1980 and 2000. A 2017 BBC report has also referred to this age range in reference to that used by National Records of Scotland. In the UK, the Resolution Foundation uses 1981–2000. The U.S. Government Accountability Office defines millennials as those born between 1982 and 2000. Sociologist Elwood Carlson, who calls the generation &quot;New Boomers&quot;, identified the birth years of 1983–2001, based on the upswing in births after 1983 and finishing with the &quot;political and social challenges&quot; that occurred after the 11 September terrorist acts. Author Neil Howe, co-creator of the Strauss–Howe generational theory, defines millennials as a &quot;Hero&quot; generation and saying they are &quot;born 1982-2005?&quot;.

The cohorts born during the cusp years before and after millennials have been identified as &quot;microgenerations&quot; with characteristics of both generations. Names given to these cuspers include &quot;Xennials&quot;, &quot;Generation Catalano&quot;, the &quot;Oregon Trail Generation&quot;; &quot;Zennials&quot; and &quot;Zillennials&quot;, respectively. The term &quot;Geriatric Millennial&quot; gained popularity in 2021 to describe those born in the beginning half of the 1980s between 1980 and 1985. The term has since been used and discussed by various media outlets including Today, CTV News, HuffPost, news.com.au, &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and Business Insider.

==Psychology==
Psychologist Jean Twenge, the author of the 2006 book &quot;Generation Me&quot;, considers millennials, along with younger members of Generation X, to be part of what she calls &quot;Generation Me&quot;. Twenge attributes millennials with the traits of confidence and tolerance, but also describes a sense of entitlement and narcissism, based on NPI surveys showing increased narcissism among millennials compared to preceding generations when they were teens and in their twenties. Psychologist Jeffrey Arnett of Clark University, Worcester has criticized Twenge&#x27;s research on narcissism among millennials, stating &quot;I think she is vastly misinterpreting or over-interpreting the data, and I think it&#x27;s destructive&quot;. He doubts that the Narcissistic Personality Inventory really measures narcissism at all. Arnett says that not only are millennials less narcissistic, they&#x27;re &quot;an exceptionally generous generation that holds great promise for improving the world&quot;. A study published in 2017 in the journal &quot;Psychological Science&quot; found a small &quot;decline&quot; in narcissism among young people since the 1990s.

Authors William Strauss and Neil Howe argue that each generation has common characteristics that give it a specific character with four basic generational archetypes, repeating in a cycle. According to their hypothesis, they predicted millennials would become more like the &quot;civic-minded&quot; G.I. Generation with a strong sense of community both local and global. Strauss and Howe ascribe seven basic traits to the millennial cohort: special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving. However, Arthur E. Levine, author of &quot;When Hope and Fear Collide: A Portrait of Today&#x27;s College Student&quot;, dismissed these generational images as &quot;stereotypes&quot;. In addition, psychologist Jean Twenge says Strauss and Howe&#x27;s assertions are overly deterministic, non-falsifiable, and unsupported by rigorous evidence.

Polling agency Ipsos-MORI warned that the word &quot;millennials&quot; is &quot;misused to the point where it&#x27;s often mistaken for just another meaningless buzzword&quot; because &quot;many of the claims made about millennial characteristics are simplified, misinterpreted or just plain wrong, which can mean real differences get lost&quot; and that &quot;[e]qually important are the similarities between other generations—the attitudes and behaviors that are staying the same are sometimes just as important and surprising.&quot;

Though it is often said that millennials ignore conventional advertising, they are in fact heavily influenced by it. They are particularly sensitive to appeals to transparency, to experiences rather than things, and flexibility.

A 2015 study by Microsoft found that 77% of respondents aged 18 to 24 said yes to the statement, &quot;When nothing is occupying my attention, the first thing I do is reach for my phone,&quot; compared to just 10% for those aged 65 and over.

The term has been used to denote anxiety experienced by many Japanese millennials struggling with a sense of and self-blaming, caused by a vast array of issues from unemployment, poverty, family problems, bullying, social withdrawal and mental ill-health.

== Cognitive abilities ==
Intelligence researcher James R. Flynn discovered that back in the 1950s, the gap between the vocabulary levels of adults and children was much smaller than it is in the early twenty-first century. Between 1953 and 2006, adult gains on the vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler IQ test were 17.4 points whereas the corresponding gains for children were only 4. He asserted that some of the reasons for this are the surge in interest in higher education and cultural changes. The number of Americans pursuing tertiary qualifications and cognitively demanding jobs has risen significantly since the 1950s. This boosted the level of vocabulary among adults. Back in the 1950s, children generally imitated their parents and adopted their vocabulary. This was no longer the case in the 2000s, when teenagers often developed their own subculture and as such were less likely to use adult-level vocabulary on their essays.

In a 2009 report, Flynn analyzed the results of the Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices test for British fourteen-year-olds from 1980 to 2008. He discovered that their average IQ had dropped by more than two points during that time period. Among those in the higher half of the intelligence distribution, the decline was even more significant, six points. This is a clear case of the reversal of the Flynn effect, the apparent rise in IQ scores observed during the twentieth century. Flynn suspected that this was due to changes in British youth culture. He further noted that in the past, IQ gains had been correlated with socioeconomic class, but this was no longer true.

Psychologists Jean Twenge, W. Keith Campbell, and Ryne A. Sherman analyzed vocabulary test scores on the U.S. General Social Survey (formula_1) and found that after correcting for education, the use of sophisticated vocabulary has declined between the mid-1970s and the mid-2010s across all levels of education, from below high school to graduate school.

==Cultural identity==

Political scientist Shirley Le Penne argues that for millennials, &quot;pursuing a sense of belonging becomes a means of achieving a sense of being needed ... Millennials experience belonging by seeking to impact the world.&quot; Educational psychologist Elza Venter believes millennials are &quot;digital natives&quot; because they have grown up experiencing digital technology and have known it all their lives . Marc Prensky created the concept of digital natives in response to the understanding that the members of the generation were &quot;native speakers of the digital language of computers, video games and the internet&quot;. This generation&#x27;s older members use a combination of face-to-face communication and computer-mediated communication, while its younger members use mainly electronic and digital technologies for interpersonal communication.

A 2013 survey of almost a thousand Britons aged 18 to 24 found that 62% had a favorable opinion of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and 70% felt proud of their national history. In 2017, research suggested nearly half of 18 to 34 year olds living in the UK had attended a live music event in the previous year.

Having faced the full brunt of the Great Recession, millennials in Europe tended to be pessimistic about the future direction of their countries, though there were significant differences, the Pew Research Center found in 2014. Millennials from countries with relatively healthy economies such as Germany and the United Kingdom were generally happier than their counterparts from struggling economies, such as Spain, Italy, and Greece. On the other hand, the young were more likely than the old to feel optimistic.

Millennials came of age in a time where the entertainment industry, including music, began to be affected by the Internet. Using artificial intelligence, Joan Serrà and his team at the Spanish National Research Council studied the massive Million Song Dataset and found that between 1955 and 2010, popular music has gotten louder, while the chords, melodies, and types of sounds used have become increasingly homogenized. Indeed, producers seem to be engaging in a &quot;loudness war&quot;, with the intention of attracting more and more audience members. While the music industry has long been accused of producing songs that are louder and blander, this is the first time the quality of songs is comprehensively studied and measured. Additional research showed that within the past few decades, popular music has gotten slower; that majorities of listeners young and old preferred older songs rather than keeping up with new ones; that the language of popular songs were becoming more negative psychologically; and that lyrics were becoming simpler and more repetitive, approaching one-word sheets, something measurable by observing how efficiently lossless compression algorithms (such as the LZ algorithm) handled them.

In modern society, there are inevitably people who refuse to conform to the dominant culture and seek to do the exact opposite; given enough time, the anti-conformists will become more homogeneous with respect to their own subculture, making their behavior the opposite to any claims of counterculture. This synchronization occurs even if more than two choices are available, such as multiple styles of beard rather than whether or not to have a beard. Mathematician Jonathan Touboul of Brandeis University who studies how information propagation through society affects human behavior calls this the hipster effect.

Once a highly successful genre on radio and then television, soap operas—characterized by melodramatic plots focused on interpersonal affairs and cheap production value—has been declining in viewership since the 1990s. Experts believe that this is due to their failure to attract younger demographics, the tendency of modern audiences to have shorter attention spans, and the rise of reality television in the 1990s. Nevertheless, Internet streaming services do offer materials in the serial format, a legacy of soap operas. However, the availability of such on-demand platforms saw to it that soap operas would never again be the cultural phenomenon they were in the twentieth century, especially among the younger generations, not least because cliffhangers could no longer capture the imagination of the viewers the way they did in the past, when television shows were available as scheduled, not on demand.

Millennial fans, especially girls and women, have been the key factor behind the commercial success of franchises such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, &quot;Twilight&quot;, and &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;. More recently, they came out in large numbers for the movie &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023) and musician Taylor Swift&#x27;s Eras Tour.

==Demographics==
===Asia===

Chinese millennials are commonly called the post-80s and post-90s generations. At a 2015 conference in Shanghai organized by University of Southern California&#x27;s US–China Institute, millennials in China were examined and contrasted with American millennials. Findings included millennials&#x27; marriage, childbearing, and child raising preferences, life and career ambitions, and attitudes towards volunteerism and activism. Due to the one-child policy introduced in the late 1970s, one-child households have become the norm in China, leading to rapid population aging, especially in the cities where the costs of living are much higher than in the countryside.

As a result of cultural ideals, government policy, and modern medicine, there has been severe gender imbalances in China and India. According to the United Nations, in 2018, there were 112 Chinese males aged 15 to 29 for every hundred females in that age group. That number in India was 111. China had a total of 34 million excess males and India 37 million, more than the entire population of Malaysia. Such a discrepancy fuels loneliness epidemics, human trafficking (from elsewhere in Asia, such as Cambodia and Vietnam), and prostitution, among other societal problems.

Singapore&#x27;s birth rate has fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 since the 1980s before stabilizing by during the 2000s and 2010s. (It reached 1.14 in 2018, making it the lowest since 2010 and one of the lowest in the world.) Government incentives such as the baby bonus have proven insufficient to raise the birth rate. Singapore&#x27;s experience mirrors those of Japan and South Korea.

Vietnam&#x27;s median age in 2018 was 26 and rising. Between the 1970s and the late 2010s, life expectancy climbed from 60 to 76. It is now the second highest in Southeast Asia. Vietnam&#x27;s fertility rate dropped from 5 in 1980 to 3.55 in 1990 and then to 1.95 in 2017. In that same year, 23% of the Vietnamese population was 15 years of age or younger, down from almost 40% in 1989. Other rapidly growing Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines, saw similar demographic trends.

===Europe===
From about 1750 to 1950, most of Western Europe transitioned from having both high birth and death rates to low birth and death rates. By the late 1960s and 1970s, the average woman had fewer than two children, and, although demographers at first expected a &quot;correction&quot;, such a rebound came only for a few countries. Despite a bump in the total fertility rates (TFR) of some European countries in the very late twentieth century (the 1980s and 1990s), especially France and Scandinavia, it returned to replacement level only in Sweden (reaching a TFR of 2.14 in 1990, up from 1.68 in 1980), along with Ireland and Iceland; the bump in Sweden was largely due to improving economic output and the generous, far-reaching family benefits granted by the Nordic welfare system, while in France it was mostly driven by older women realizing their dreams of motherhood. For Sweden, the increase in the fertility rate came with a rise in the birth rate (going from 11.7 in 1980 to 14.5 in 1990), which slowed down and then stopped for a brief period to the aging of the Swedish population caused by the decline in birth rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s. To this day, France and Sweden still have higher fertility rates than most of Europe, and both almost reached replacement level in 2010 (2.03 and 1.98 respectively).

At first, falling fertility is due to urbanization and decreased infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children. In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children, as economist Gary Becker argued. (This is the first demographic transition.) Falling fertility then came from attitudinal shifts. By the 1960s, people began moving from traditional and communal values towards more expressive and individualistic outlooks due to access to and aspiration of higher education, and to the spread of lifestyle values once practiced only by a tiny minority of cultural elites. (This is the second demographic transition.) Although the momentous cultural changes of the 1960s leveled off by the 1990s, the social and cultural environment of the very late twentieth-century was quite different from that of the 1950s. Such changes in values have had a major effect on fertility. Member states of the European Economic Community saw a steady increase in not just divorce and out-of-wedlock births between 1960 and 1985 but also falling fertility rates. In 1981, a survey of countries across the industrialized world found that while more than half of people aged 65 and over thought that women needed children to be fulfilled, only 35% of those between the ages of 15 and 24 (younger Baby Boomers and older Generation X) agreed. In the early 1980s, East Germany, West Germany, Denmark, and the Channel Islands had some of the world&#x27;s lowest fertility rates.

At the start of the twenty-first century, Europe suffers from an aging population. This problem is especially acute in Eastern Europe, whereas in Western Europe, it is alleviated by international immigration. In addition, an increasing number of children born in Europe has been born to non-European parents. Because children of immigrants in Europe tend to be about as religious as they are, this could slow the decline of religion (or the growth of secularism) in the continent as the twenty-first century progresses. In the United Kingdom, the number of foreign-born residents stood at 6% of the population in 1991. Immigration subsequently surged and has not fallen since (as of 2018). Research by the demographers and political scientists Eric Kaufmann, Roger Eatwell, and Matthew Goodwin suggest that such a fast ethno-demographic change is one of the key reasons behind public backlash in the form of national populism across the rich liberal democracies, an example of which is the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum (Brexit).

Italy is a country where the problem of an aging population is especially acute. The fertility rate dropped from about four in the 1960s down to 1.2 in the 2010s. This is not because young Italians do not want to procreate. Quite the contrary, having many children is an Italian ideal. But its economy has been floundering since the Great Recession of 2007–08, with the youth unemployment rate at a staggering 35% in 2019. Many Italians have moved abroad—150,000 did in 2018—and many are young people pursuing educational and economic opportunities. With the plunge in the number of births each year, the Italian population is expected to decline in the next five years. Moreover, the Baby Boomers are retiring in large numbers, and their numbers eclipse those of the young people taking care of them. Only Japan has an age structure more tilted towards the elderly.

Greece also suffers from a serious demographic problem as many young people are leaving the country in search of better opportunities elsewhere in the wake of the Great Recession. This brain drain and a rapidly aging population could spell disaster for the country.

Overall, E.U. demographic data shows that the number of people aged 18 to 33 in 2014 was 24% of the population, with a high of 28% for Poland and a low of 19% for Italy.

As a result of the shocks due to the decline and dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia&#x27;s birth rates began falling in the late 1980s while death rates have risen, especially among men. In the early 2000s, Russia had not only a falling birth rate but also a declining population despite having an improving economy. Between 1992 and 2002, Russia&#x27;s population dropped from 149 million to 144 million. According to the &quot;medium case scenario&quot; of the U.N.&#x27;s Population Division, Russia could lose another 20 million people by the 2020s.

Europe&#x27;s demographic reality contributes to its economic troubles. Because the European baby boomers failed to replace themselves, by the 2020s and 2030s, dozens of European nations will find their situation even tougher than before.

===Oceania===

Australia&#x27;s total fertility rate has fallen from above three in the post-war era, to about replacement level (2.1) in the 1970s to below that in the late 2010s. However, immigration has been offsetting the effects of a declining birthrate. In the 2010s, among the residents of Australia, 5% were born in the United Kingdom, 3% from China, 2% from India, and 1% from the Philippines. 84% of new arrivals in the fiscal year of 2016 were below 40 years of age, compared to 54% of those already in the country. Like other immigrant-friendly countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States, Australia&#x27;s working-age population is expected to grow till about 2025. However, the ratio of people of working age to retirees (the dependency ratio) has gone from eight in the 1970s to about four in the 2010s. It could drop to two by the 2060s, depending on immigration levels. &quot;The older the population is, the more people are on welfare benefits, we need more health care, and there&#x27;s a smaller base to pay the taxes,&quot; Ian Harper of the Melbourne Business School told ABC News (Australia). While the government has scaled back plans to increase the retirement age, to cut pensions, and to raise taxes due to public opposition, demographic pressures continue to mount as the buffering effects of immigration are fading away.

===North America===
Historically, the early Anglo-Protestant settlers in the seventeenth century were the most successful group, culturally, economically, and politically, and they maintained their dominance till the early twentieth century. Commitment to the ideals of the Enlightenment meant that they sought to assimilate newcomers from outside of the British Isles, but few were interested in adopting a pan-European identity for the nation, much less turning it into a global melting pot. But in the early 1900s, liberal progressives and modernists began promoting more inclusive ideals for what the national identity of the United States should be. While the more traditionalist segments of society continued to maintain their Anglo-Protestant ethnocultural traditions, universalism and cosmopolitanism started gaining favor among the elites. These ideals became institutionalized after the Second World War, and ethnic minorities started moving towards institutional parity with the once dominant Anglo-Protestants. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 (also known as the Hart–Celler Act), passed at the urging of President Lyndon B. Johnson, abolished national quotas for immigrants and replaced it with a system that admits a fixed number of persons per year based in qualities such as skills and the need for refuge. Immigration subsequently surged from elsewhere in North America (especially Canada and Mexico), Asia, Central America, and the West Indies. By the mid-1980s, most immigrants originated from Asia and Latin America. Some were refugees from Vietnam, Cuba, Haiti, and other parts of the Americas while others came illegally by crossing the long and largely undefended U.S.-Mexican border. At the same time, the postwar baby boom and subsequently falling fertility rate seemed to jeopardize America&#x27;s social security system as the Baby Boomers retire in the twenty-first century. Provisional data from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that U.S. fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of 2.1 since 1971. (In 2017, it fell to 1.765.)
Millennial population size varies, depending on the definition used. Using its own definition, the Pew Research Center estimated that millennials comprised 27% of the U.S. population in 2014. In the same year, using dates ranging from 1982 to 2004, Neil Howe revised the number to over 95 million people in the U.S. In a 2012 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, it was estimated that there were approximately 80 million U.S. millennials. The United States Census Bureau, using birth dates ranging from 1982 to 2000, stated the estimated number of U.S. millennials in 2015 was 83.1 million people.

In 2017, fewer than 56% millennials were non-Hispanic whites, compared with more than 84% of Americans in their 70s and 80s, 57% had never been married, and 67% lived in a metropolitan area. According to the Brookings Institution, millennials are the &quot;demographic bridge between the largely white older generations (pre-millennials) and much more racially diverse younger generations (post-millennials).&quot;

By analyzing data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Pew Research Center estimated that millennials, whom they define as people born between 1981 and 1996, outnumbered baby boomers, born from 1946 to 1964, for the first time in 2019. That year, there were 72.1 million millennials compared to 71.6 million baby boomers, who had previously been the largest living adult generation in the country. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics shows that about 62 million millennials were born in the United States, compared to 55 million members of Generation X, 76 million baby boomers, and 47 million from the Silent Generation. Between 1981 and 1996, an average of 3.9 million millennial babies were born each year, compared to 3.4 million average Generation X births per year between 1965 and 1980. But millennials continue to grow in numbers as a result of immigration and naturalization. In fact, millennials form the largest group of immigrants to the United States in the 2010s. Pew projected that the millennial generation would reach around 74.9 million in 2033, after which mortality would outweigh immigration. Yet 2020 would be the first time millennials (who are between the ages of 24 and 39) find their share of the electorate shrink as the leading wave of Generation Z (aged 18 to 23) became eligible to vote. In other words, their electoral power peaked in 2016. In absolute terms, however, the number of foreign-born millennials continues to increase as they become naturalized citizens. In fact, 10% of American voters were born outside the country by the 2020 election, up from 6% in 2000. The fact that people from different racial or age groups vote differently means that this demographic change will influence the future of the American political landscape. While younger voters hold significantly different views from their elders, they are considerably less likely to vote. Non-whites tend to favor candidates from the Democratic Party while whites by and large prefer the Republican Party.

As of the mid-2010s, the United States is one of the few developed countries that does &quot;not&quot; have a top-heavy population pyramid. In fact, as of 2016, the median age of the U.S. population was younger than that of all other rich nations except Australia, New Zealand, Cyprus, Ireland, and Iceland, whose combined population is only a fraction of the United States. This is because American baby boomers had a higher fertility rate compared to their counterparts from much of the developed world. Canada, Germany, Italy, Japan, and South Korea are all aging rapidly by comparison because their millennials are smaller in number than their parents. This demographic reality puts the United States at an advantage compared to many other major economies as the millennials reach middle age: the nation will still have a significant number of consumers, investors, and taxpayers.

According to the Pew Research Center, &quot;Among men, only 4% of millennials [ages 21 to 36 in 2017] are veterans, compared with 47%&quot; of men in their 70s and 80s, &quot;many of whom came of age during the Korean War and its aftermath.&quot; Some of these former military service members are combat veterans, having fought in Afghanistan or Iraq. As of 2016, millennials are the majority of the total veteran population. According to the Pentagon in 2016, 19% of millennials are interested in serving in the military, and 15% have a parent with a history of military service.

==Economic prospects and trends==

Trends suggest developments in artificial intelligence and robotics will not result in mass unemployment, but can actually create high-skilled jobs. However, in order to take advantage of this situation, people need to hone skills that machines have not yet mastered, such as teamwork.

By analyzing data from the United Nations and the Global Talent Competitive Index, KDM Engineering found that , the top five countries for international high-skilled workers are Switzerland, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Sweden. Factors taken into account included the ability to attract high-skilled foreign workers, business-friendliness, regulatory environment, the quality of education, and the standard of living. Switzerland is best at retaining talents due to its excellent quality of life. Singapore is home to a world-class environment for entrepreneurs. And the United States offers the most opportunity for growth due to the sheer size of its economy and the quality of higher education and training. As of 2019, these are also some of the world&#x27;s most competitive economies, according to the World Economic Forum (WEF). In order to determine a country or territory&#x27;s economic competitiveness, the WEF considers factors such as the trustworthiness of public institutions, the quality of infrastructure, macro-economic stability, the quality of healthcare, business dynamism, labor market efficiency, and innovation capacity.

From 2000–2020, before the COVID pandemic, economic activities tended to concentrate in the large metropolitan areas, such as San Francisco, New York, London, Tokyo and Sydney. Productivity increased enormously as knowledge workers agglomerated. The pandemic led to an increase in remote work, more so in developed countries, aided by technology.

Using a variety of measures, economists have reached the conclusion that the rate of innovation and entrepreneurship has been declining across the Western world between the early 1990s and early 2010s, when it leveled off. In the case of the U.S., one of the most complex economies in existence, economist Nicholas Kozeniauskas explained that &quot;the decline in entrepreneurship is concentrated among the smart&quot; as the share of entrepreneurs with university degrees in that country more than halved between the mid-1980s and the mid-2010s. There are many possible reasons for this: population aging, market concentration, and zombie firms (those with low productivity but are kept alive by subsidies). While employment has become more stable and more suitable, modern economies are so complex they are essentially ossified, making them vulnerable to disruptions.

==Education==
=== Global trends ===
From the late 1990s to the late 2010s, education transformed the economic realities of countries worldwide. As the people from developing nations became better educated, they close the gap between them and the developed world. Hence Westerners lost their relative advantage in education, as the world saw more people with high-school diplomas than ever before. The number of people with Bachelor&#x27;s degree and advanced degrees grew significantly as well. Westerners who only passed secondary school had their income cut in real terms during that same period while those with university degrees had incomes that barely increased on average. The fact that many jobs are suitable for remote work due to modern technology further eroded the relative advantage of education in the Western world, resulting in a backlash against immigration and globalization.

As more and more women became educated in the developing world, more leave the rural areas for the cities, enter the work force and compete with men, sparking resentment among men in those countries.

For information on public support for higher education (for domestic students) in the OECD in 2011, see chart below.
===In Europe===
In Sweden, universities are tuition-free, as is the case in Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland. However, Swedish students typically graduate very indebted due to the high cost of living in their country, especially in the large cities such as Stockholm. The ratio of debt to expected income after graduation for Swedes was about 80% in 2013. In the U.S., despite incessant talk of student debt reaching epic proportions, that number stood at 60%. Moreover, about seven out of eight Swedes graduate with debt, compared to one half in the U.S. In the 2008–09 academic year, virtually all Swedish students take advantage of state-sponsored financial aid packages from a govern agency known as the Centrala Studiestödsnämnden (CSN), which include low-interest loans with long repayment schedules (25 years or until the student turns 60). In Sweden, student aid is based on their own earnings whereas in some other countries, such as Germany or the United States, such aid is premised on parental income as parents are expected to help foot the bill for their children&#x27;s education. In the 2008–09 academic year, Australia, Austria, Japan, the Netherlands, and New Zealand saw an increase in both the average tuition fees of their public universities for full-time domestic students and the percentage of students taking advantage of state-sponsored student aid compared to 1995. In the United States, there was an increase in the former but not the latter.

In 2005, judges in Karlsruhe, Germany, struck down a ban on university fees as unconstitutional on the grounds that it violated the constitutional right of German states to regulate their own higher education systems. This ban was introduced in order to ensure equality of access to higher education regardless of socioeconomic class. Bavarian Science Minister Thomas Goppel told the Associated Press, &quot;Fees will help to preserve the quality of universities.&quot; Supporters of fees argued that they would help ease the financial burden on universities and would incentivize students to study more efficiently, despite not covering the full cost of higher education, an average of €8,500 as of 2005. Opponents believed fees would make it more difficult for people to study and graduate on time. Germany also suffered from a brain drain, as many bright researchers moved abroad while relatively few international students were interested in coming to Germany. This has led to the decline of German research institutions.

In the 1990s, due to a combination of financial hardship and the fact that universities elsewhere charged tuition, British universities pressed the government to allow them to take in fees. A nominal tuition fee of £1,000 was introduced in autumn 1998. Because not all parents would be able to pay all the fees in one go, monthly payment options, loans, and grants were made available. Some were concerned that making people pay for higher education may deter applicants. This turned out not to be the case. The number of applications fell by only 3% in 1998, and mainly due to mature students rather than 18-year-olds.

In 2012, £9,000 worth of student fees were introduced. Despite this, the number of people interested in pursuing higher education grew at a faster rate than the UK population. In 2017, almost half of young people in England had received higher education by the age of 30. Prime Minister Tony Blair introduced the goal of having half of young Britons having a university degree in 1999, though the 2010 deadline was missed. What the Prime Minister did not realize, however, is that an oversupply of young people with high levels of education historically precipitated periods of political instability and unrest in various societies, from early modern Western Europe and late Tokugawa Japan to the Soviet Union, modern Iran, and the United States. In any case, demand for higher education in the United Kingdom has remained strong throughout the early 21st century, driven by the need for high-skilled workers from both the public and private sectors. There has been, however, a widening gender gap. As of 2017, women were more likely to attend or to have attended university than men, by 55% against 43%, a difference of 12 percentage points.

=== Oceania ===
In Australia, university tuition fees were introduced in 1989. Regardless, the number of applicants has risen considerably. By the 1990s, students and their families were expected to pay 37% of the cost, up from a quarter in the late 1980s. The most expensive subjects were law, medicine, and dentistry, followed by the natural sciences, and then by the arts and social studies. Under the new funding scheme, the Government of Australia also capped the number of people eligible for higher education, enabling schools to recruits more well-financed (though not necessarily bright) students.

===North America ===
According to the Pew Research Center, 53% of American millennials attended or were enrolled in university in 2002. For comparison, the number of young people attending university was 44% in 1986. By the 2020s, 39% of millennials had at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree, more than the Baby Boomers at 25%, the Economist reports.

In the United States today, high school students are generally encouraged to attend college or university after graduation while the options of technical school and vocational training are often neglected. Historically, high schools separated students on career tracks, with programs aimed at students bound for higher education and those bound for the workforce. Students with learning disabilities or behavioral issues were often directed towards vocational or technical schools. All this changed in the late 1980s and early 1990s thanks to a major effort in the large cities to provide more abstract academic education to everybody. The mission of high schools became preparing students for college, referred to as &quot;high school to Harvard.&quot; However, this program faltered in the 2010s, as institutions of higher education came under heightened skepticism due to high costs and disappointing results. People became increasingly concerned about debts and deficits. No longer were promises of educating &quot;citizens of the world&quot; or estimates of economic impact coming from abstruse calculations sufficient. Colleges and universities found it necessary to prove their worth by clarifying how much money from which industry and company funded research, and how much it would cost to attend.

Because jobs (that suited what one studied) were so difficult to find in the few years following the Great Recession, the value of getting a liberal arts degree and studying the humanities at an American university came into question, their ability to develop a well-rounded and broad-minded individual notwithstanding. As of 2019, the total college debt has exceeded US$1.5 trillion, and two out of three college graduates are saddled with debt. The average borrower owes US$37,000, up US$10,000 from ten years before. A 2019 survey by TD Ameritrade found that over 18% of millennials (and 30% of Generation Z) said they have considered taking a gap year between high school and college.

In 2019, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis published research (using data from the 2016 &quot;Survey of Consumer Finances&quot;) demonstrating that after controlling for race and age cohort families with heads of household with post-secondary education who were born before 1980 there have been wealth and income premiums, while for families with heads of household with post-secondary education but born after 1980 the wealth premium has weakened to point of statistical insignificance (in part because of the rising cost of college) and the income premium while remaining positive has declined to historic lows (with more pronounced downward trajectories with heads of household with postgraduate degrees). Quantitative historian Peter Turchin noted that the United States was overproducing university graduates—he termed this elite overproduction—in the 2000s and predicted, using historical trends, that this would be one of the causes of political instability in the 2020s, alongside income inequality, stagnating or declining real wages, growing public debt. According to Turchin, intensifying competition among graduates, whose numbers were larger than what the economy could absorb, leads to political polarization, social fragmentation, and even violence as many become disgruntled with their dim prospects despite having attained a high level of education. He warned that the turbulent 1960s and 1970s could return, as having a massive young population with university degrees was one of the key reasons for the instability of the past.

According to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, students were turning away from liberal arts programs. Between 2012 and 2015, the number of graduates in the humanities dropped from 234,737 to 212,512. Consequently, many schools have relinquished these subjects, dismissed faculty members, or closed completely. Data from the National Center for Education Statistics revealed that between 2008 and 2017, the number of people majoring in English plummeted by just over a quarter. At the same time, those in philosophy and religion fell 22% and those who studied foreign languages dropped 16%. Meanwhile, the number of university students majoring in homeland security, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and healthcare skyrocketed. (See figure below.)

According to the U.S. Department of Education, people with technical or vocational trainings are slightly more likely to be employed than those with a bachelor&#x27;s degree and significantly more likely to be employed in their fields of specialty. The United States currently suffers from a shortage of skilled tradespeople.

Despite the fact that educators and political leaders, such as President Barack Obama, have been trying to years to improve the quality of STEM education in the United States, and that various polls have demonstrated that more students are interested in these subjects, graduating with a STEM degree is a different kettle of fish altogether. According to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, 48% of students majoring in STEM dropped out of their programs between 2003 and 2009. Data collected by the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) in 2011 showed that although these students typically came in with excellent high school GPAs and SAT scores, among science and engineering students, including pre-medical students, 60% changed their majors or failed to graduate, twice the attrition rate of all other majors combined. Despite their initial interest in secondary school, many university students find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of a rigorous STEM education. Some are mathematically unskilled, while others are simply lazy. The National Science Board raised the alarm all the way back in the mid-1980s that students often forget why they wanted to be scientists and engineers in the first place. Many bright students had an easy time in high school and failed to develop good study habits. In contrast, Chinese, Indian, and Singaporean students are exposed to mathematics and science at a high level from a young age. Moreover, according education experts, many mathematics schoolteachers were not as well-versed in their subjects as they should be, and might well be uncomfortable with mathematics. Given two students who are equally prepared, the one who goes to a more prestigious university is less likely to graduate with a STEM degree than the one who attends a less difficult school. Competition can defeat even the top students. Meanwhile, grade inflation is a real phenomenon in the humanities, giving students an attractive alternative if their STEM ambitions prove too difficult to achieve. Whereas STEM classes build on top of each other—one has to master the subject matter before moving to the next course—and have black and white answers, this is not the case in the humanities, where things are a lot less clear-cut.

In 2015, educational psychologist Jonathan Wai analyzed average test scores from the Army General Classification Test in 1946 (10,000 students), the Selective Service College Qualification Test in 1952 (38,420), Project Talent in the early 1970s (400,000), the Graduate Record Examination between 2002 and 2005 (over 1.2 million), and the SAT Math and Verbal in 2014 (1.6 million). Wai identified one consistent pattern: those with the highest test scores tended to pick the physical sciences and engineering as their majors while those with the lowest were more likely to choose education. (See figure below.)
During the 2010s, the mental health of American graduate students in general was in a state of crisis.

===Historical knowledge===
A February 2018 survey of 1,350 individuals found that 66% of the American millennials (and 41% of all U.S. adults) surveyed did not know what Auschwitz was, while 41% incorrectly claimed that 2 million Jews or fewer were killed during the Holocaust, and 22% said that they had never heard of the Holocaust. Over 95% of American millennials were unaware that a portion of the Holocaust occurred in the Baltic states, which lost over 90% of their pre-war Jewish population, and 49% were not able to name a single Nazi concentration camp or ghetto in German-occupied Europe. However, at least 93% surveyed believed that teaching about the Holocaust in school is important and 96% believed the Holocaust happened.

The YouGov survey found that 42% of American millennials have never heard of Mao Zedong, who ruled China from 1949 to 1976 and was responsible for the deaths of 20–45 million people; another 40% are unfamiliar with Che Guevara.

==Health and welfare==
According to a 2018 report from Cancer Research UK, millennials in the United Kingdom are on track to have the highest rates of overweight and obesity, with current data trends indicating millennials will overtake the Baby boomer generation in this regard, making millennials the heaviest generation since current records began. Cancer Research UK reports that more than 70% of millennials will be overweight or obese by ages 35–45, in comparison to 50% of Baby boomers who were overweight or obese at the same ages.

According to the National Strokes Association, the risk of having a stroke is increasing among young adults (those in their 20s and 30s) and even adolescents. During the 2010s, there was a 44% increase in the number of young people hospitalized for strokes. Health experts believe this development is due to a variety of reasons related to lifestyle choices, including obesity, smoking, alcoholism, and physical inactivity. Obesity is also linked to hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol levels. CDC data reveals that during the mid-2000s, about 28% of young Americans were obese; this number rose to 36% a decade later. Up to 80% of strokes can be prevented by making healthy lifestyle choices while the rest are due to factors beyond a person&#x27;s control, namely age and genetic defects (such as congenital heart disease). In addition, between 30% and 40% of young patients suffered from cryptogenic strokes, or those with unknown causes.

According to a 2019 report from the American College of Cardiology, the prevalence of heart attacks among Americans under the age of 40 increased by an average rate of two percent per year in the previous decade. About one in five patients suffered from a heart attack came from this age group. This is despite the fact that Americans in general were less likely to suffer from heart attacks than before, due in part to a decline in smoking. The consequences of having a heart attack were much worse for young patients who also had diabetes. Besides the common risk factors of heart attacks, namely diabetes, high blood pressure, and family history, young patients also reported marijuana and cocaine intake, but less alcohol consumption.

Drug addiction and overdoses adversely affect millennials more than prior generations with overdose deaths among millennials increasing by 108% from 2006 to 2015. In the United States, millennials and older zoomers represented a majority of all opioid overdose deaths in 2021. The leading cause of death for people aged 25–44 in 2021 were drug overdoses (classified as poisonings by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) with overdose deaths being triple that of the second and third leading causes of death; suicide and traffic accidents, respectively. This represents a major shift as traffic accidents typically constituted a majority of accidental deaths for prior generations.

Millennials struggle with dental and oral health. More than 30% of young adults have untreated tooth decay (the highest of any age group), 35% have trouble biting and chewing, and some 38% of this age group find life in general &quot;less satisfying&quot; due to teeth and mouth problems.

===Sports and fitness===

Fewer American millennials follow sports than their Generation X predecessors, with a McKinsey survey finding that 38 percent of millennials in contrast to 45 percent of Generation X are committed sports fans. However, the trend is not uniform across all sports; the gap disappears for National Basketball Association, Ultimate Fighting Championship, English Premier League and college sports. For example, a survey in 2013 found that engagement with mixed martial arts had increased in the 21st century and was more popular than boxing and wrestling for Americans aged 18 to 34 years old, in contrast to those aged 35 and over who preferred boxing. In the United States, while the popularity of American football and the National Football League has declined among millennials, the popularity of association football and Major League Soccer has increased more among millennials than for any other generation, and as of 2018 was the second most popular sport among those aged 18 to 34.

Regarding the sports participation by millennials, activities that are popular or emerging among millennials including boxing, cycling, running, and swimming, while other sports including golf are facing decline among millennials. The Physical Activity Council&#x27;s 2018 Participation Report found that in the U.S., millennials were more likely than other generations to participate in water sports such as stand-up paddling, board-sailing and surfing. According to the survey of 30,999 Americans, which was conducted in 2017, approximately half of U.S. millennials participated in high caloric activities while approximately one quarter were sedentary. The 2018 report from the Physical Activity Council found millennials were more active than Baby Boomers in 2017. Thirty-five percent of both millennials and Generation X were reported to be &quot;active to a healthy level&quot;, with millennials&#x27; activity level reported as higher overall than that of Generation X in 2017.

==Political views and participation==

Millennials are reshaping political discourse, showing evolving attitudes towards governance, social issues, and economic policies. Their increasing political participation and distinct generational identity signify a transformative phase in contemporary politics, with potential long-term implications for national and global political trends.

American millennials exhibit a complex spectrum of political views, paralleling broader generational shifts in attitudes toward social, economic, and political issues. Surveys indicate a significant portion of millennials&#x27; political views align with their parents, though a notable fraction express more liberal tendencies. Key issues for US millennials include support for same-sex marriage, varying attitudes towards the LGBT community, and a more moderate stance on political ideologies compared to older generations. Millennials in the United States demonstrate increasing skepticism towards capitalism, with a preference for socialism seen in younger segments of the demographic. Canadian millennials played a crucial role in the election of Justin Trudeau, driven by social and economic liberal values. Despite historically low political participation, the 2015 federal election saw a surge in youth voter turnout, influenced by Trudeau&#x27;s progressive campaign promises.

British millennials, characterized by a relative political disengagement in their early years, have shown liberal tendencies on social and economic matters, favoring individual liberty and limited government intervention. Significant political moments like the Brexit referendum mobilized young voters, displaying a strong preference for remaining in the European Union, highlighting generational divides in political priorities and attitudes.

Across Europe, millennials are part of a larger shift towards post-materialist values, emphasizing environmentalism, social liberalism, and global citizenship. This generational shift is contributing to changing political landscapes, challenging traditional party alignments and contributing to the rise of new political movements. French millennials, while exempt from mandatory military service, still engage in a Defense and Citizenship Day, reflecting continued engagement with national civic duties. A significant majority support the reintroduction of some form of national service, reflecting broader desires for national cohesion and integration.

==Preferred modes of transport==

Millennials in the U.S. were initially not keen on getting a driver&#x27;s license or owning a vehicle thanks to new licensing laws and the state of the economy when they came of age, but the oldest among them have already begun buying cars in great numbers. In 2016, millennials purchased more cars and trucks than any living generation except the Baby Boomers; in fact, millennials overtook Baby Boomers in car ownership in California that year. A working paper by economists Christopher Knittel and Elizabeth Murphy then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Bureau of Economic Research analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s National Household Transportation Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau, and American Community Survey in order to compare the driving habits of the Baby Boomers, Generation X, and the oldest millennials (born between 1980 and 1984). That found that on the surface, the popular story is true: American millennials on average own 0.4 fewer cars than their elders. But when various factors—including income, marital status, number of children, and geographical location—were taken into account, such a distinction ceased to be. In addition, once those factors are accounted for, millennials actually drive longer distances than the Baby Boomers. Economic forces, namely low gasoline prices, higher income, and suburban growth, result in millennials having an attitude towards cars that is no different from that of their predecessors. An analysis of the National Household Travel Survey by the State Smart Transportation Initiative revealed that higher-income millennials drive less than their peers probably because they are able to afford the higher costs of living in large cities, where they can take advantage of alternative modes of transportation, including public transit and ride-hailing services.

According to the Pew Research Center, young people are more likely to ride public transit. In 2016, 21% of adults aged 18 to 21 took public transit on a daily, almost daily, or weekly basis. By contrast, this number of all U.S. adults was 11%. Nationwide, about three quarters of American commuters drive their own cars. Also according to Pew, 51% of U.S. adults aged 18 to 29 used Lyft or Uber in 2018 compared to 28% in 2015. That number for all U.S. adults were 15% in 2015 and 36% in 2018. In general, users tend to be urban residents, young (18–29), university graduates, and high income earners ($75,000 a year or more).

==Religious beliefs==
Millennials often describe themselves as &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot; and will sometimes turn to astrology, meditation or mindfulness techniques possibly to seek meaning or a sense of control. According to 2015 analysis of the European Values Study in the &quot;Handbook of Children and Youth Studies&quot; &quot;the majority of young respondents in Europe claimed that they belonged to a Christian denomination&quot;, and &quot;in most countries, the majority of young people believe in God&quot;. However, according to the same analysis a &quot;dramatic decline&quot; in religious affiliation among young respondents happened in Great Britain, Sweden, France, Italy and Denmark. By contrast an increase in religious affiliation happened among young respondents in Russia, Ukraine, and Romania.

According to a 2013 YouGov poll of almost a thousand Britons between the ages of 18 and 24, 56% said they had never attended a place of worship, other than for a wedding or a funeral. 25% said they believed in God, 19% in a &quot;spiritual greater power&quot; while 38% said they did not believe in God nor any other &quot;greater spiritual power&quot;. The poll also found that 14% thought religion was a &quot;cause of good&quot; in the world while 41% thought religion was &quot;the cause of evil&quot;. 34% answered &quot;neither&quot;. The British Social Attitudes Survey found that 71% of British 18–24 year-olds were not religious, with just 3% affiliated to the once-dominant Church of England, and 5% say they are Catholics, and 14% say they belong to other Christian denomination.

In the U.S., millennials are the least likely to be religious when compared to older generations. There is a trend towards irreligion that has been increasing since the 1940s. According to a 2012 study by Pew Research, 32 percent of Americans aged 18–29 are irreligious, as opposed to 21 percent aged 30–49, 15 percent aged 50–64, and only 9 percent born aged 65 and above. A 2005 study looked at 1,385 people aged 18 to 25 and found that more than half of those in the study said that they pray regularly before a meal. One-third said that they discussed religion with friends, attended religious services, and read religious material weekly. Twenty-three percent of those studied did not identify themselves as religious practitioners. A 2010 Pew Research Center study on millennials shows that of those between 18 and 29 years old, only 3% of these emerging adults self-identified as &quot;atheists&quot; and only 4% self-identified as &quot;agnostics&quot;. While 68% of those between 18 and 29 years old self-identified as &quot;Christians&quot; (43% self-identified as Protestants and 22% self-identified as Catholics). Overall, 25% of millennials are &quot;Nones&quot; and 75% are religiously affiliated. In 2011, social psychologists Jason Weeden, Adam Cohen, and Douglas Kenrick analyzed survey data sets from the American general public and university undergraduates and discovered that sociosexual tendencies—that is, mating strategies—play a more important role in determining the level of religiousness than any other social variables. In fact, when controlled for family structure and sexual attitudes, variables such as age, sex, and moral beliefs on sexuality substantially drop in significance in determining religiosity. In the context of the United States, religiousness facilitates seeking and maintaining high-fertility, marriage-oriented, heterosexual monogamous relationships. As such, the central goals of religious attendance are reproduction and child-rearing. However, this Reproductive Religiosity Model does not necessarily apply to other countries. In Singapore, for example, they found no relationships between the religiousness of Buddhists and their attitudes towards sexuality.
A 2016 U.S. study found that church attendance during young adulthood was 41% among Generation Z, 18% for the millennials, 21% for Generation X, and 26% for the Baby Boomers when they were at the same age. A 2016 survey by Barna and Impact 360 Institute on about 1,500 Americans aged 13 and up suggests that the proportion of atheists and agnostics was 21% among Generation Z, 15% for millennials, 13% for Generation X, and 9% for Baby Boomers. 59% of Generation Z were Christians (including Catholics), as were 65% for the millennials, 65% for Generation X, and 75% for the Baby Boomers. 41% of teens believed that science and the Bible are fundamentally at odds with one another, with 27% taking the side of science and 17% picking religion. For comparison, 45% of millennials, 34% of Generation X, and 29% of the Baby Boomers believed such a conflict exists. 31% of Generation Z believed that science and religion refer to different aspects of reality, on par with millennials and Generation X (both 30%), and above the Baby Boomers (25%). 28% of Generation Z thought that science and religion are complementary, compared to 25% of millennials, 36% of Generation X, and 45% for Baby Boomers.
==Social tendencies==

=== Social circles ===
In March 2014, the Pew Research Center issued a report about how &quot;millennials in adulthood&quot; are &quot;detached from institutions and networked with friends&quot;. The report said millennials are somewhat more upbeat than older adults about America&#x27;s future, with 49% of millennials saying the country&#x27;s best years are ahead, though they&#x27;re the first in the modern era to have higher levels of student loan debt and unemployment.

=== Courtship behavior ===
In many countries, people have since the mid-twentieth century been increasingly looking for mates of the same socioeconomic status and educational attainment. The phenomenon of preferring mates with characteristics similar to one&#x27;s own is known as assortative mating. Part of the reason growing economic and educational assortative mating was economic in nature. Innovations which became commercially available in the late twentieth century such as the washing machine and frozen food reduced the amount of time people needed to spend on housework, which diminished the importance of domestic skills. Moreover, by the early 2000s, it was less feasible for a couple with one spouse having no more than a high-school diploma to earn about the national average; on the other hand, couples both of whom had at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree could expect to make a significant amount above the national average. People thus had a clear economic incentive to seek out a mate with at least as high a level of education in order to maximize their potential income. Another incentive for this kind of assortative mating lies in the future of the offspring. People have since the mid-twentieth century increasingly wanted intelligent and well-educated children, and marrying bright people who make a lot of money goes a long way in achieving that goal. Couples in the early twenty-first century tend to hold egalitarian rather than traditional views on gender roles. Modern marriage is more about companionship rather than bread-winning for the man and homemaking for the woman. American and Chinese youths are increasingly choosing whether or not to marry according to their personal preferences rather than family, societal, or religious expectations.
As of 2016, 54% of Russian millennials were married.

According to the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics, the number of people getting married for the first time went from 23.8 million in 2013 to 13.9 million in 2019, a 41% drop. Meanwhile, the marriage rate continued its decline, 6.6 per 1,000 people, a 33% drop compared to 2013. These trends are due to multiple reasons. The one-child policy, introduced in 1979, has curbed the number of young people in China. On top of that, the traditional preference for sons has resulted in a marked gender imbalance; as of 2021, China has over 30 million &quot;surplus&quot; men.

In the 1990s, the Chinese government reformed higher education in order to increase access, whereupon significantly more young people, a slight majority of whom being women, have received a university degree. Consequently, many young women are now gainfully employed and financially secure. Traditional views on gender roles dictate that women be responsible for housework and childcare, regardless of their employment status. Workplace discrimination against women (with families) is commonplace; for example, an employer might be more skeptical towards a married woman with one child, fearing she might have another (as the one-child policy was rescinded in 2016) and take more maternity leave. Altogether, there is less incentive for young women to marry.

For young Chinese couples in general, the cost of living, especially the cost of housing in the big cities, is a serious obstacle to marriage. In addition, Chinese millennials are less keen on marrying than their predecessors as a result of cultural change.

Writing for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 2018, Kate Julian reported that among the countries that kept track of the sexual behavior of their citizens—Australia, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States—all saw a decline in the frequency of sexual intercourse among teenagers and young adults. Although experts disagree on the methodology of data analysis, they do believe that young people today are less sexually engaged than their elders, such as the baby boomers, when they were their age. This is despite the fact that online dating platforms allow for the possibility of casual sex, the wide availability of contraception, and the relaxation of attitudes towards sex outside of marriage.

A 2020 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by researchers from Indiana University in the United States and the Karolinska Institutet from Sweden found that during the first two decades of the twenty-first century, young Americans had sexual intercourse less frequently than in the past. Among men aged 18 to 24, the share of the sexually inactive increased from 18.9% between 2000 and 2002 to 30.9% between 2016 and 2018. Women aged 18 to 34 had sex less often as well. Reasons for this trend are manifold. People who were unemployed, only had part-time jobs, and students were the most likely to forego sexual experience while those who had higher income were stricter in mate selection. Psychologist Jean Twenge, who did not participate in the study, suggested that this might be due to &quot;a broader cultural trend toward delayed development&quot;, meaning various adult activities are postponed. She noted that being economically dependent on one&#x27;s parents discourages sexual intercourse. Other researchers noted that the rise of the Internet, computer games, and social media could play a role, too, since older and married couples also had sex less often. In short, people had many options. A 2019 study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found a similar trend in the United Kingdom. Although this trend precedes the COVID-19 pandemic, fear of infection is likely to fuel the trend the future, study co-author Peter Ueda told Reuters.

In a 2019 poll, the Pew Research Center found that about 47% American adults believed dating had become more difficult within the last decade or so, while only 19% said it became easier and 33% thought it was the same. Majorities of both men (65%) and women (43%) agreed that the #MeToo movement posed challenges for the dating market while 24% and 38%, respectively, thought it made no difference. In all, one in two of single adults were not looking for a romantic relationship. Among the rest, 10% were only interested in casual relationships, 14% wanted committed relationships only, and 26% were open to either kind. Among younger people (18 to 39), 27% wanted a committed relationship only, 15% casual dates only, and 58% either type of relationship. For those between the ages of 18 and 49, the top reasons for their decision to avoid dating were having more important priorities in life (61%), preferring being single (41%), being too busy (29%), and pessimism about their chances of success (24%).

While most Americans found their romantic partners with the help of friends and family, younger adults were more likely to encounter them online than their elders, with 21% of those aged 18 to 29 and 15% of those aged 30 to 49 saying they met their current partners this way. For comparison, only 8% of those aged 50 to 64 and 5% of those aged 65 and over did the same. People aged 18 to 29 were most likely to have met their current partners in school while adults aged 50 and up were more likely to have met their partners at work. Among those in the 18 to 29 age group, 41% were single, including 51% of men and 32% of women. Among those in the 30 to 49 age group, 23% were single, including 27% of men and 19% of women. This reflects the general trend across the generations that men tend to marry later (and die earlier) than women.

Most single people, regardless of whether or not they were interested in dating, felt little to no pressure from their friends and family to seek a romantic partner. Young people, however, were under significant pressure compared to the sample average or older age groups. 53% of single people aged 18 to 29 thought there was at least some pressure from society on them to find a partner, compared to 42% for people aged 30 to 49, 32% for people aged 50 to 64, and 21% for people aged 50 to 64.

=== Family life and offspring ===
According to the Brookings Institution, the number of American mothers who never married ballooned between 1968, when they were extremely rare, and 2008, when they became much more common, especially among the less educated. In particular, in 2008, the number of mothers who never married with at least 16 years of education was 3.3%, compared to 20.1% of those who never graduated from high school. Unintended pregnancies were also higher among the less educated.

Research by the Urban Institute conducted in 2014, projected that if current trends continue, millennials will have a lower marriage rate compared to previous generations, predicting that by age 40, 31% of millennial women will remain single, approximately twice the share of their single Gen X counterparts. The data showed similar trends for males. A 2016 study from Pew Research showed millennials delay some activities considered rites of passage of adulthood with data showing young adults aged 18–34 were more likely to live with parents than with a relationship partner, an unprecedented occurrence since data collection began in 1880. Data also showed a significant increase in the percentage of young adults living with parents compared to the previous demographic cohort, Generation X, with 23% of young adults aged 18–34 living with parents in 2000, rising to 32% in 2014. Additionally, in 2000, 43% of those aged 18–34 were married or living with a partner, with this figure dropping to 32% in 2014. High student debt is described as one reason for continuing to live with parents, but may not be the dominant factor for this shift as the data shows the trend is stronger for those without a college education. Richard Fry, a senior economist for Pew Research said of millennials, &quot;they&#x27;re the group much more likely to live with their parents,&quot; further stating that &quot;they&#x27;re concentrating more on school, careers and work and less focused on forming new families, spouses or partners and children.&quot;
According to a cross-generational study comparing millennials to Generation X conducted at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, more than half of millennial undergraduates surveyed do not plan to have children. The researchers compared surveys of the Wharton graduating class of 1992 and 2012. In 1992, 78% of women planned to eventually have children dropping to 42% in 2012. The results were similar for male students. The research revealed among both genders the proportion of undergraduates who reported they eventually planned to have children had dropped in half over the course of a generation. &quot;Quest&quot; reported in March 2020 that, in Belgium, 11% of women and 16% of men between the ages of 25 and 35 did not want children and that in the Netherlands, 10% of 30-year-old women polled had decided against having children or having more children. A 2019 study revealed that among 191 Swedish men aged 20 to 50, 39 were not fathers and did not want to have children in the future (20.4%). Desire to have (more) children was not related to level of education, country of birth, sexual orientation or relationship status. Some Swedish men &quot;passively&quot; choose not to have children because they feel their life is already good as it is without bringing children to the world, and because they do not face the same amount of social pressure to have children the way voluntarily childless women do.

But as their economic prospects improve, most millennials in the United States say they desire marriage, children, and home ownership. Geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan argued that because of the size of the millennial cohort relative to the size of the U.S. population and because they are having children, the United States will continue to maintain an economic advantage over most other developed nations, whose millennial cohorts are not only smaller than those of their elders but also do not have as high a fertility rate. The prospects of any given country is constrained by its demography. Psychologist Jean Twenge and a colleague&#x27;s analysis of data from the General Social Survey of 40,000 Americans aged 30 and over from the 1970s to the 2010s suggests that socioeconomic status (as determined by factors such as income, educational attainment, and occupational prestige), marriage, and happiness are positive correlated and that these relationships are independent of cohort or age. However, the data cannot tell whether marriage causes happiness or the other way around; correlation does not mean causation.

In the United States, between the late 1970s and the late 2010s, the shares of people who were married declined among the lower class (from 60% down to 33%) and the middle class (84% down to 66%), but remained steady among the upper class (~80%). In fact, it was the lower and middle classes that were driving the U.S. marriage rate down. Among Americans aged 25 to 39, the divorce rate per 1,000 married persons dropped from 30 to 24 between 1990 and 2015. For comparison, among those aged 50 and up, the divorce rate went from 5 in 1990 to 10 in 2015; that among people aged 40 to 49 increased from 18 to 21 per 1,000 married persons. In general, the level of education is a predictor of marriage and income. University graduates are more likely to get married and less likely to divorce.

Demographer and futurist Mark McCrindle suggested the name &quot;Generation Alpha&quot; (or Generation formula_2) for the offspring of a majority of millennials, people born after Generation Z, noting that scientific disciplines often move to the Greek alphabet after exhausting the Roman alphabet. By 2016, the cumulative number of American women of the millennial generation who had given birth at least once reached 17.3 million. Globally, there are some two and a half million people belonging to Generation Alpha born every week and their number is expected to reach two billion by 2025. However, most of the human population growth in the 2010s comes from Africa and Asia, as nations in Europe and the Americas tend to have too few children to replace themselves. According to the United Nations, the global annual rate of growth has been declining steadily since the late twentieth century, dropping to about one percent in 2019. They also discovered that fertility rates were falling faster in the developing world than previously thought, and subsequently revised their projection of human population in 2050 down to 9.7 billion. Fertility rates have been falling around the world thanks to rising standards of living, better access to contraceptives, and improved educational and economic opportunities. The global average fertility rate was 2.4 in 2017, down from 4.7 in 1950.

Effects of intensifying assortative mating (discussed in the previous section) will likely be seen in the next generation, as parental income and educational level are positively correlated with children&#x27;s success. In the United States, children from families in the highest income quintile are the most likely to live with married parents (94% in 2018), followed by children of the middle class (74%) and the bottom quintile (35%).

Living in the digital age, millennial parents have taken plenty of photographs of their children and have chosen both digital storage (e.g., Dropbox) and physical photo albums to preserve their memories. Many millennial parents document the childhood and growth of their children on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.

==Workplace attitudes==
In 2008, author Ron Alsop called the millennials &quot;Trophy Kids&quot;, a term that reflects a trend in competitive sports, as well as many other aspects of life, where mere participation is frequently enough for a reward. It has been reported that this is an issue in corporate environments. Some employers are concerned that millennials have too great expectations from the workplace. Some studies predict they will switch jobs frequently, holding many more jobs than Gen Xers due to their great expectations. Psychologist Jean Twenge reports data suggesting there are differences between older and younger millennials regarding workplace expectations, with younger millennials being &quot;more practical&quot; and &quot;more attracted to industries with steady work and are more likely to say they are willing to work overtime&quot; which Twenge attributes to younger millennials coming of age following the financial crisis of 2007–2008.

In 2010 the &quot;Journal of Business and Psychology&quot;, contributors Myers and Sadaghiani find millennials &quot;expect close relationships and frequent feedback from supervisors&quot; to be a main point of differentiation. Multiple studies observe millennials&#x27; associating job satisfaction with free flow of information, strong connectivity to supervisors, and more immediate feedback. Hershatter and Epstein, researchers from Emory University, argue many of these traits can be linked to millennials entering the educational system on the cusp of academic reform, which created a much more structured educational system. Some argue in the wake of these reforms, such as the No Child Left Behind Act, millennials have increasingly sought the aid of mentors and advisers, leading to 66% of millennials seeking a flat work environment.

Hershatter and Epstein also stress a growing importance on work-life balance. Studies show nearly one-third of students&#x27; top priority is to &quot;balance personal and professional life&quot;. The Brain Drain Study shows nearly 9 out of 10 millennials place an importance on work-life balance, with additional surveys demonstrating the generation to favor familial over corporate values. Studies also show a preference for work-life balance, which contrasts to the Baby Boomers&#x27; work-centric attitude.

There is also a contention that the major differences are found solely between millennials and Generation X. Researchers from the University of Missouri and The University of Tennessee conducted a study based on measurement equivalence to determine if such a difference does in fact exist. The study looked at 1,860 participants who had completed the Multidimensional Work Ethic Profile (MWEP), a survey aimed at measuring identification with work-ethic characteristics, across a 12-year period spanning from 1996 to 2008. The results of the findings suggest the main difference in work ethic sentiments arose between the two most recent generational cohorts, Generation X and millennials, with relatively small variances between the two generations and their predecessor, the Baby Boomers.

A meta study conducted by researchers from The George Washington University and The U.S. Army Research Institute for the Behavioral and Social Sciences questions the validity of workplace differences across any generational cohort. According to the researchers, disagreement in which events to include when assigning generational cohorts, as well as varied opinions on which age ranges to include in each generational category are the main drivers behind their skepticism. The analysis of 20 research reports focusing on the three work-related factors of job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intent to turn over proved any variation was too small to discount the impact of employee tenure and aging of individuals. Newer research shows that millennials change jobs for the same reasons as other generations—namely, more money and a more innovative work environment. They look for versatility and flexibility in the workplace, and strive for a strong work–life balance in their jobs and have similar career aspirations to other generations, valuing financial security and a diverse workplace just as much as their older colleagues.

Data also suggests millennials are driving a shift towards the public service sector. In 2010, Myers and Sadaghiani published research in the &quot;Journal of Business and Psychology&quot; stating heightened participation in the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps as a result of millennials, with volunteering being at all-time highs. Volunteer activity between 2007 and 2008 show the millennial age group experienced almost three-times the increase of the overall population, which is consistent with a survey of 130 college upperclassmen depicting an emphasis on altruism in their upbringing. This has led, according to a Harvard University Institute of Politics, six out of ten millennials to consider a career in public service.

The 2014 Brookings publication shows a generational adherence to corporate social responsibility, with the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) 2013 survey and Universum&#x27;s 2011 survey, depicting a preference to work for companies engaged in the betterment of society. Millennials&#x27; shift in attitudes has led to data depicting 64% of millennials would take a 60% pay cut to pursue a career path aligned with their passions, and financial institutions have fallen out of favor with banks comprising 40% of the generation&#x27;s least liked brands.

==Use of digital technology==
Marc Prensky coined the term &quot;digital native&quot; to describe &quot;K through college&quot; students in 2001, explaining they &quot;represent the first generations to grow up with this new technology&quot;. In their 2007 book &quot;Connecting to the Net.Generation: What Higher Education Professionals Need to Know About Today&#x27;s Students&quot;, authors Reynol Junco and Jeanna Mastrodicasa expanded on the work of William Strauss and Neil Howe to include research-based information about the personality profiles of millennials, especially as it relates to higher education. They conducted a large-sample (7,705) research study of college students. They found that Net Generation college students, born 1982 onwards, were frequently in touch with their parents and they used technology at higher rates than people from other generations. In their survey, they found that 97% of these students owned a computer, 94% owned a mobile phone, and 56% owned an MP3 player. They also found that students spoke with their parents an average of 1.5 times a day about a wide range of topics. Other findings in the Junco and Mastrodicasa survey revealed 76% of students used instant messaging, 92% of those reported multitasking while instant messaging, 40% of them used television to get most of their news, and 34% of students surveyed used the Internet as their primary news source.

One of the most popular forms of media used by millennials is social networking. Millennials use social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to create a different sense of belonging, make acquaintances, and to remain connected with friends. In 2010, research was published in the Elon Journal of Undergraduate Research which claimed that students who used social media and decided to quit showed the same withdrawal symptoms of a drug addict who quit their stimulant. In the 2014 PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; episode &quot;Generation Like&quot;, there is discussion about millennials, their dependence on technology, and the ways the social media sphere is commoditized. Some millennials enjoy having hundreds of channels from cable TV. However, some other millennials do not even have a TV, so they watch media over the Internet using smartphones and tablets. Jesse Singal of &quot;New York&quot; magazine argues that smartphones have created a rift within the generation; older millennials, defined here as those born 1988 and earlier, came of age prior to widespread usage and availability of this technology, in contrast to younger millennials, those born in 1989 and later, who were exposed to this technology in their teen years.

<text>Zabaione () or, through hypercorrection, zabaglione (, ; ) is an Italian dessert, or sometimes a beverage, made with egg yolks, sugar, and a sweet wine (usually Moscato d&#x27;Asti or Marsala wine). Some versions of the recipe incorporate spirits such as cognac. The dessert version is a light custard, whipped to incorporate a large amount of air. Since the 1960s, in restaurants in areas of the US with large Italian populations, zabaione is usually served with strawberries, blueberries, peaches, etc., in a champagne coupe, and is often prepared tableside for dramatic effect.

In France, it is called &quot;sabayon&quot;. The dessert is popular in Argentina and Uruguay, where it is known as &quot;sambayón&quot; (from the Piedmontese ) and is a popular ice cream flavour.

Espresso zabaglione incorporates the sugar and egg yolk mixture into a small cup to be filled with a shot of espresso coffee, which can be served frozen.

==History==
Although accounts vary, the Italian dessert dates as far back as the second half of the 15th century, a recipe for which appears in the manuscript collection at the Morgan Library &quot;Cuoco Napoletano&quot;.

==Preparation==
Classic zabaione uses raw egg yolks cooked in a bain-marie and most often served with Marsala wine (although other wines can be substituted). It can be finished with beaten egg white (meringue) or sometimes with whipped cream.

Occasionally, the wine is omitted when the dish is served to children or those who abstain from alcohol. It is then, in effect, a very different dessert. A simple version of zabaione is called &quot;uovo sbattuto&quot; and is mostly considered a breakfast item, especially when flavoured with espresso.

==In French cuisine==
The French adopted the recipe as part of their system of sauces in the 1800s as a dessert cream called &quot;sabayon&quot;. By the 20th century, the name &quot;sabayon&quot; was also used to describe savoury broths and yolk-based sauces.

<doc id="149189" wikidata="Q189762" url="?curid=149189" title="Peter Carl Fabergé">
<text>Peter Carl Gustavovich Fabergé (; – 24 September 1920; also known as Charles Fabergé) was a Russian goldsmith and jeweller. He is best known for creating Fabergé eggs made in the style of genuine Easter eggs, but using precious metals and gemstones rather than more mundane materials. He was one of the sons of Gustav Fabergé, the founder of the House of Fabergé.

==Early life and education==
Peter Carl Fabergé was born on in Saint Petersburg, Russia, into the family of the Baltic German jeweller of Huguenot descent, Gustav Fabergé, and his wife Charlotte Jungstedt, the daughter of Danish painter Karl Jungstedt. Gustav Fabergé&#x27;s paternal ancestors were Huguenots, originally from La Bouteille, Picardy, who fled from France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, first to Germany near Berlin, then in 1800 to the Pernau county (today Pärnu), Livonia Governorate, then part of Russia, now in Estonia.

His father retired from his jewelry business in 1860 and moved with his family to Dresden, the capital of Saxony; he left the House of Fabergé in Saint Petersburg in the hands of his business partner, Hiskias Pendin. Carl enrolled at the Dresden &quot;Handelsschule&quot; (trade school), a place where the sons of Saxon merchants studied the basics of business administration. In 1862, Agathon Fabergé was born in Dresden, where he went to school as well.

Carl was sent to England to learn English and he continued with his Grand Tour of Europe. He received tuition from respected goldsmiths in Germany, France and England, attended a course at Schloss&#x27;s Commercial College in Paris, and viewed the objects in the galleries of Europe&#x27;s leading museums. He was also apprenticed by the jeweler Josef Friedman of Frankfurt-am-Main, whose jewels were highly regarded in the German principalities. Fabergé returned to Saint Petersburg in 1864 and entered his father&#x27;s firm. Although he was only 18 years of age, he continued his education and was tutored by Hiskias Pendin. He also developed friendships with members of the directorate of the Hermitage Museum and began unpaid work there in 1867.

==Career==
===Head of the family business===
On , he married Augusta Julia Jacobs, daughter of the furniture craftsman Gotlieb Jacobs. He also took over his father&#x27;s firm the same year. His first child, Eugène Fabergé, was born in 1874, and two years later, Agathon Fabergé was born; Alexander and Nicholas Fabergé followed in 1877 and 1884 respectively. The company was also involved with cataloguing, repairing, and restoring objects in the Hermitage during the 1870s. In 1881, the business moved to larger street-level premises at Bolshaya Morskaya. Fabergé also began making changes to transform the firm from what his son Eugène called &quot;a dealer in petty jewelry and spectacles&quot;. His time in Europe had inspired him to make pieces that were more than a sum of their parts. As he later described in his own words: &quot;Expensive things interest me little if the value is merely in so many diamonds or pearls&quot;.

By 1881, Carl earned enough recognition among his peers to be appointed &quot;master of the Second Guild&quot;, which marked him as a merchant or retailer rather than a craftsman. This also meant he did not have to submit his pieces for official testing when using his own hallmark to that of the firm. Upon the death of Hiskias Pendin, Carl Fabergé took sole responsibility for running the company and was formally acknowledged as the head of the firm. At this time, the firm employed about 20 people.

The firm&#x27;s first major breakthrough was in 1882, when Carl and Agathon Fabergé were a sensation at the Pan-Russian Exhibition of Industry and the Arts held in Moscow. Carl was awarded a gold medal. Due to his work at the Hermitage, which included Greek and Scythian jewelry from the 4th-century that he helped to restore, Fabergé had been invited to the exhibition; Fabergé had also received permission to copy and incorporate the designs of those articles, and this became the focus of his display. The magazine &quot;Niva&quot; wrote in an article: &quot;Mr Fabergé opens a new era in the art of jewellery... Her Majesty honoured Fabergé by buying a pair of cufflinks with images of cicadas which, according to Ancient Greek belief, bring luck&quot;. Although he achieved recognition of the imperial family, Fabergé was only one of many jewellers supplying the Russian court; at least five firms are mentioned in the Imperial accounts for 1883, with only 6,400 rubles paid to Fabergé, which was by far the smallest.

Fabergé&#x27;s production of the very first so-called Fabergé egg, the Hen Egg, given as a gift from Emperor Alexander III to his wife, Maria Feodorovna, on Orthodox Easter on 24 March 1885, so delighted her that on 1 May, the emperor patronized the firm and awarded it with the title of Supplier to the Imperial Court. This meant that Fabergé now had full personal access to the important Hermitage Collection, where he was able to study and find inspiration for developing his unique personal style. Influenced by the jewelled bouquets created by the eighteenth century goldsmiths Jean-Jacques Duval and Jérémie Pauzié, Fabergé re-worked their ideas combining them with his accurate observations and his fascination for Japanese art. This resulted in a revival of the lost art of enameling and a focus on the setting of every single gemstone in a piece to its best visual advantage. Indeed, it was not unusual for Agathon to make ten or more wax models so that all possibilities could be exhausted before deciding on a final design. Shortly after Agathon joined the firm, the House introduced &quot;objects deluxe&quot;: gold bejewelled items embellished with enamel ranging from electric bell pushes to cigarette cases and including &quot;objects de fantaisie&quot;.

===Easter eggs===
In light of the empress&#x27; response to receiving one of Fabergé&#x27;s eggs on Easter, the emperor soon commissioned the company to make an Easter egg as a gift for her every year thereafter. The emperor placed an order for another egg the following year. Beginning in 1887, the emperor apparently gave Carl Fabergé complete freedom with regard to egg designs, which then became more and more elaborate. According to Fabergé Family tradition, not even the emperor knew what form they would take— the only stipulation was that each one should be unique and each should contain a surprise. Alexander III collaborated with Fabergé on some of the designs to some extent.

Upon the 1894 death of Alexander III, his son, the next emperor, Nicholas II, followed this tradition and expanded it by requesting that there be two eggs each year, one for his mother (who was eventually given a total of 30 such eggs) and one for his wife, Alexandra (who received another 20). These series of Easter gift eggs are today distinguished from the other jeweled eggs Fabergé ended up producing by their designation as Imperial Easter Eggs. The tradition continued until the October Revolution when the entire Romanov dynasty was executed and the eggs and many other treasures were confiscated by the interim government. The two final eggs were never delivered nor paid for.
Although today the House of Fabergé is famed for the Imperial Easter Eggs, it made many more objects ranging from silver tableware to fine jewelry which were also of exceptional quality and beauty, and until its departure from Russia during the revolution, Fabergé&#x27;s company became the largest jewelry business in the country. The Saint Petersburg branch was made up of several workshops with the responsibility of overseeing each item from its design through all the manufacturing stages. The Moscow branch was run as a commercial center. Other branches were also established in Odessa (1890), London (1903) and Kiev (1905). A total of about 500 people worked for the firm. It produced at least 150,000 items of jewelry, silver and other items of fantasy, or up to an estimated 200,000 items from 1882 to 1917.

Fabergé&#x27;s work represented Russia at the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. As Carl Fabergé was a member of the jury, the House of Fabergé exhibited &quot;hors concours&quot; (without competing). Nevertheless, the House was awarded a gold medal and the city&#x27;s jewelers recognized Carl Fabergé as a maître. Additionally, France recognized Carl Fabergé with one of the most prestigious of French awards, appointing him a knight of the Legion of Honour. Two of Carl&#x27;s sons and his head workmaster were also honored. Commercially, the exposition was a great success and the firm acquired a great many orders and clients.

===End of the House of Fabergé===

Following the outbreak of war in 1914, the firm submitted proposals for wartime production and received a response the following year, following which production began on military orders, which continued until the October Revolution in 1917. In 1916, the House of Fabergé became a joint-stock company under the name C. Fabergé, with a fixed capital of three million rubles.

As a result of the revolution, the business was run by a Committee of Employees, which managed the firm until 1918, when the workshops were closed by Fabergé, who then left the country after officials of the new government asked him to close the business. Fabergé reportedly asked for ten minutes to collect his belongings before leaving. The great majority of jewels were destroyed following the revolution.

Fabergé died at the Hotel Bellevue in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 24 September 1920. He had escaped Russia in September 1918 under disguise as a courier with the British legation. His family believed he died of a broken heart. His wife, Augusta, died in 1925. The two were reunited in 1929 when Eugène Fabergé took his father&#x27;s remains from Lausanne and buried them in his mother&#x27;s grave at the Cimetière du Grand Jas in Cannes, France.

==Personal life==

Henry Bainbridge, a manager of the London branch of the House of Fabergé, recorded recollections of his meetings with his employer in his autobiography, as well as the book he wrote about Fabergé. The autobiography also records the memories of François Birbaum, Fabergé&#x27;s senior master craftsman from 1893 until the House&#x27;s demise.

===Family===
Fabergé had five sons with Augusta Julia Jacobs, whom he married in 1872. Four of his sons lived to adulthood: Eugène (Evgeny) (1874–1960), Agathon (1876–1951), Alexander (1877–1952), and Nicholas (Nikolai) Leopold (1884–1939). Another son, Nikolai (1881–1883), died during infancy.

==Legacy==
Bainbridge says that when Fabergé took over the firm in 1872, there was &quot;no special significance attached it&quot;, although it was a sound business, but over time, he raised its art to a much higher level, with the foundation of the firm consisting of lightness and elegance in design as Fabergé began creating objects of fantasy in addition to jewelry.

<text>Fajardo () is a town and a municipality part of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area in Puerto Rico.

Fajardo is the hub of much of the recreational boating in Puerto Rico and a popular launching port to Culebra, Vieques, and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands. It is also home to the largest marina in the Caribbean, called Puerto del Rey. The town contains various hotels and inns.

Offshore, near Fajardo, a few islets can be found. These are Icacos, Isla Palomino, Palominito, and Diablo, among other uninhabited coral islands and barrier reefs.

==History==
Fajardo was founded in 1760, 1773 or 1774 (depending on the authority) as Santiago de Fajardo. It was one of the locations used by the American troops to invade Puerto Rico. On August 1, 1898 the USS Puritan under the command of Captain Frederic W. Rodgers, sailed the coastline near the city of Fajardo when he spotted the Faro de Las Cabezas de San Juan (Cape San Juan lighthouse), which was supposed to be the landing site for the US Army in Puerto Rico. Rodgers ordered some of his men ashore, including Puerto Rican volunteers, with the mission to post the American flag atop the lighthouse.

On November 14, 1824, in what was dubbed the &quot;Foxhardo&quot; Affair, US Naval Officer David Porter landed at Fajardo with 200 seamen and marines, threatening to destroy Fajardo because one of his men had been arrested in Puerto Rico. For taking this action without US approval, Porter was later court-martialed.

After the Spanish–American War, Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico and determined that the population of Fajardo was 16,782.

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico. In Fajardo, the hurricane triggered numerous landslides with its strong winds and significant amount of rainfall.

<doc id="149207" wikidata="Q1163207" url="?curid=149207" title="The Zombies">
<text>The Zombies are an English rock band formed in St Albans in 1961. Led by keyboardist/vocalist Rod Argent and lead vocalist Colin Blunstone, the group had their first British and American hit in 1964 with &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot;. In the US, two further singles—&quot;Tell Her No&quot; in 1965 and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; in 1968—were also successful.

Their 1968 album &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; was ranked number 100 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2012 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number 243 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2020 list. The Zombies were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

The Zombies reunited for a few odd concerts from 1989 to 1997, but have been active full-time since 2004, releasing their most recent studio album, &quot;Different Game&quot;, in 2023. The band today consists of Blunstone and Argent (White and Grundy also show up for occasional concerts), but as of July 2024, Argent is no longer touring.

==History==
===1961–1964===
Three members of the band, Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson and Hugh Grundy, first came together to jam in 1961 in St Albans, Hertfordshire. Argent wanted to form a band and initially asked his elder cousin Jim Rodford to join as a bassist. At the time, Rodford was in a successful local band, the Bluetones, and so declined, but he offered to help Argent. Rodford would later join in 2004 when the band reformed. Brian Christie, a friend of Atkinson, was invited into the band. When Christie left the band in early 1962 to focus on education, he suggested Colin Blunstone and Paul Arnold from another band, The Hoaxes, to be added, with the latter to replace him as bassist. Blunstone and Arnold joined the other three to form the band in 1961 while all five members were at school.

Some sources state that Argent, Atkinson, and Grundy were at St Albans School, while Blunstone and Arnold were students at St Albans Boys&#x27; Grammar School. Both Blunstone and Grundy came from Hatfield and both sang in the choir there at St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church. Argent was a boy chorister in St Albans Cathedral Choir. They held their original rehearsals at the Pioneer Club, then situated on Hatfield Road, using equipment lent to them by the Bluetones. They met outside the Blacksmiths Arms pub in St Albans before their first rehearsal and gained their initial reputation playing the Old Verulamians Rugby Club there.

Argent said, &quot;We met outside a pub. We were too young to walk in the pub”. Blunstone added &quot;I was literally in a corner singing to myself, doing a Ricky Nelson song, and Rod came over and said, &#x27;That’s really good. I’ll tell you what. If you’ll be the lead singer, I’ll play keyboards&#x27;&quot;.

===Origin of band name===
Originally named the &quot;Mustangs&quot;, the band soon realised that other groups had that name. According to Blunstone, &quot;Every young band wants an original name. We were just in our teens. We tried the Mustangs. To be honest, I didn’t really know what a zombie was&quot;. &quot;It was Arnold who came up with &quot;the Zombies&quot;. Argent said &quot;Well, we chose that name in 1961 and, I mean, I knew vaguely that they were: sort of, you know, the Walking Dead from Haiti and Colin didn&#x27;t even really know what they were&quot;. &quot;It was Paul [Arnold] that came up with the name. I don&#x27;t know where he got it from. He very soon left the band after that&quot;. Arnold explained the name, saying, &quot;I thought this was a name that no one else is going to have. And I just liked the whole idea of it. Colin was wary, I&#x27;m sure, at the beginning, I know, but I always, always really, really liked it&quot;.

Arnold lost interest in the band, choosing to leave to become a physician; he was replaced by Chris White.

===Recording contract===
In 1964, the band won a £250 cash prize in a beat-group competition organised by the Watford Borough Council and sponsored by the London &quot;Evening News&quot;. They signed a recording contract with Decca and recorded their first hit, &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot;. It was released in mid-1964 and peaked at No. 12 in the UK, becoming their only UK Top 40 hit. The tune began to catch on in the United States and eventually climbed to No. 2 in early December. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

===1964–1967===
Like many other British groups, the Zombies travelled to the United States to tour on the momentum of their hit single. Among their early US gigs were Murray the K&#x27;s Christmas shows at the Brooklyn Fox Theatre, where the band played seven performances a day. On 12 January 1965, the band made their first in-person appearance on US television on the first episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; and played &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; and their new single &quot;Tell Her No&quot; to a screaming, hysterical audience full of teenage girls.

In the UK, the Zombies&#x27; follow-up single to &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; was written by Chris White. &quot;Leave Me Be&quot; was unsuccessful in the UK and, as a result, was not issued as an A-side in the US. It did appear as the B side of their second US single, &quot;Tell Her No&quot;. Penned by Rod Argent, &quot;Tell Her No&quot; became another big seller in 1965, peaking at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March. As the band&#x27;s third UK single, &quot;Tell Her No&quot; failed to make the Top 40, peaking at No. 42. Subsequent singles - &quot;She&#x27;s Coming Home&quot;, &quot;I Want You Back Again&quot;, &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Ready&quot;, &quot;Is This the Dream&quot;, &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot; (recorded for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Bunny Lake is Missing&quot;), &quot;Indication&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get a Hold of Myself&quot; - failed to achieve the success of the previous two singles (although the Zombies had continued success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, which led to a series of concerts in 1967). A song by the Zombies released only as a B-side (to &quot;Whenever You&#x27;re Ready&quot;) in both the US and UK in 1965, &quot;I Love You&quot;, subsequently became a sizeable hit for the group People! in the United States in 1968.

The Zombies&#x27; first UK album, &quot;Begin Here&quot; (1965), was a mixture of original songs and rhythm and blues cover versions. Of the eight original tracks, Rod Argent supplied the album&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot;, and the songs &quot;Woman&quot;, &quot;I Remember When I Loved Her&quot;, plus &quot;The Way I Feel Inside&quot; which was the shortest track on the album at 1:28. It might have been shorter, had not their recording manager and producer Ken Jones added the sounds of footsteps and a coin dropping, which contributed to the feeling of alienation that the song projected. Bassist Chris White provided &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make Up My Mind&quot;, the quirky &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Know&quot;, plus the beaty &quot;What More Can I Do&quot;, which, at 1:38, is the second-shortest cut on the album and contains a simple but distinctive drum riff. The final original was an instrumental written by Ken Jones, &quot;Work &#x27;n&#x27; Play&quot;.

The Zombies continued recording original songs through 1965 and 1966, trying to achieve chart success. There were enough tracks to have filled a follow-up album, but due to the band&#x27;s lack of chart success, most of these tracks remained unissued at the time.

===&quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; ===
In 1967, frustrated by their continuing lack of success, the Zombies left Decca and signed a recording contract with CBS Records for whom they recorded the album &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; at EMI&#x27;s world-famous Abbey Road studios.

The band&#x27;s budget did not stretch to session musicians, so they used a Mellotron to fill out their arrangements. According to Argent, they used John Lennon&#x27;s Mellotron, which had been left in the studio after the Beatles&#x27; sessions for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. The album was mixed into the standard mono; however, as another concession toward their limited budget, Argent and White (who, due to their songwriting royalties, had earned more than the rest of the members) personally paid for stereo mixes.

The change in direction was evident on their first single released by CBS, &quot;Care of Cell 44&quot;, a song about the anticipation felt while waiting for the singer&#x27;s partner to be released from prison. It is also notable that the title of the song does not appear anywhere in the lyrics. Unfortunately, like their previous Decca releases, it failed to reach the charts. A second CBS single, &quot;Friends of Mine&quot;, was also unsuccessful.

====Misspelled title word====
Art teacher Terry Quirk misspelt the word &quot;Odyssey&quot; in the album title as &quot;Odessey&quot; while designing the album cover. Quirk was Blunstone&#x27;s and White&#x27;s childhood friend and was living with White and Argent in their apartment during the album&#x27;s recording. Regarding the misspelling, Quirk said, &quot;There’s lots of theories online about why it’s spelt wrong, but there’s no conspiracy&quot;.

===Band break-up===
With the band experiencing a declining demand for live appearances, they split up after a final gig in mid-December 1967.

In April 1968, Argent explained the reason for the band breaking up, saying &quot;We don&#x27;t want to end up playing for £20 a night in third-class ballrooms. We are still in big demand on the university circuit and are getting a lot of work. We want to quit while the going&#x27;s good&quot;.

===Release of last Zombies album===
&quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;, the band&#x27;s swansong album, was released in the UK in April1968, months after the band&#x27;s breakup. The album suffered poor sales. It was only released in the US because musician Al Kooper, then signed to Columbia Records, convinced the label of the album&#x27;s merits. One of its tracks, &quot;Time of the Season&quot;, written by Argent, was released as a single in 1968 and spent a long period as a &#x27;sleeper&#x27;. Eventually, in 1969, it grew to become a nationwide hit in the US, peaking in the Hot 100 (&quot;Billboard&quot;) at No. 3.

===Unreleased final album===
In 1968, Argent and White began working on material for a possible new band when they were approached by CBS to do another Zombies album. Several new Argent/White songs were cut, initially with a line-up of Argent, White, Hugh Grundy and Rick Birkett (guitar), with the latter three being replaced during the sessions by Jim Rodford (bass), Bob Henrit (drums) and Russ Ballard (guitar). The new tracks were combined with some old Decca out-takes and demos that were overdubbed and enhanced in sessions at Morgan Studios in London. The album, scheduled for release in 1969, was cancelled, and only a couple of the songs, &quot;Imagine the Swan&quot; (one of the newly recorded songs) and &quot;If It Don&#x27;t Work Out&quot; (a demo of a song that Dusty Springfield recorded and released in 1965), were put out as singles instead. Some of this material was released on various compilation albums during the 1970s and 1980s, including 1973&#x27;s &quot;Time of the Zombies&quot;, and the whole album, titled &quot;R.I.P.&quot;, was released in Japan in 2000.

===Post–Zombies (1969–1988)===
The original line-up declined to regroup for concerts following the belated American success of &quot;Time of the Season&quot;. In turn, various concocted bands tried to capitalise on the success and falsely toured under the band&#x27;s name. In a scheme organised by Delta Promotions, an agency that also created fake touring versions of The Animals and The Archies, two fake Zombie line-ups were touring simultaneously in 1969, one hailing from Texas, the other from Michigan. The Texas group featured bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard, soon to be members of ZZ Top. Another group toured in 1988, going so far as to not only trademark the group&#x27;s name (the real band had let it lapse) but also recruit a bass guitarist named Ronald Hugh Grundy, claiming that original drummer Hugh Grundy had switched instruments.

In 1969, the last line-up of the Zombies - Argent, Ballard, Rodford and Henrit - began working under a new name, Argent, with White as a non-performing songwriter. Atkinson worked in A&amp;R at Columbia and Grundy joined him there after a brief spell in auto sales. Blunstone started a solo career after a brief period outside the music business, including working in the burglary claims section of the Sun Alliance insurance company. Both Argent and White provided him with new songs. He also did studio vocals for the Alan Parsons Project. Atkinson retired as a performer and worked as an A&amp;R executive for many years.

===1989–1999===
In 1989, Blunstone, White and Grundy briefly reunited as the Zombies with guitarist/keyboardist Sebastian Santa Maria and recorded the album &quot;The Return of the Zombies&quot;, released in some European countries in February 1990. The UK release was held back to April 1991, when a reconfigured version of the album was issued as &quot;New World&quot;.

A 1997, 120-track compilation of the original band&#x27;s work, &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot;, was released on UK Ace/Big beat. The compilation contains all the band&#x27;s Decca/Parrot recordings (in mono), the entire &quot;Odessey And Oracle&quot; LP (in stereo), the material that would have made up the unissued &quot;R.I.P.&quot; LP, several unissued recordings and a disc of recordings made for the BBC. On 25 November 1997, all five Zombies reunited at the Jazz Café in London&#x27;s Camden Town as part of a solo show by Blunstone to perform &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; to promote the release of &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot;.

Blunstone and Argent did not play together again until late 1999. Argent spotted Blunstone in the audience while performing at a charity concert for jazz musician John Dankworth and invited him onstage for an impromptu reunion. This positive experience set the stage for further collaborations to come.

===2000–present===
The twosome reunited to play shows together in 2000 under the Colin Blunstone &amp; Rod Argent moniker and moved to the U.S. in 2001. They recorded an album, &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot; (2001), and continued playing live shows together into 2004 when they began going out under the name &quot;The Zombies&quot; again. The new line-up included Keith Airey (brother of Don Airey) on guitar, Jim Rodford on bass and his son Steve Rodford on drums.

In 2002, Ace/Big Beat released the 48-track &quot;The Decca Stereo Anthology&quot;, which, for the first time, mixed all the Decca/Parrot recordings into true stereo. An album of new material released in 2004, &quot;As Far as I Can See...&quot;, received poor-to-scathing reviews from both Pitchfork and AllMusic.

In January 2004, guitarist Paul Atkinson received the President&#x27;s Merit Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at a benefit concert at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, California. The Zombies reunited for the event, which turned out to be Atkinson&#x27;s last performance with them. He died later that year on 1 April 2004, in Santa Monica, California, from liver and kidney disease.

In 2005, Blunstone and Argent released a DVD and 2-CD album (&quot;Live at the Bloomsbury Theatre&quot;) and continued touring with the Zombies. To mark the 40th anniversary of &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;, the four surviving original members of the Zombies participated in a three-night series of concerts at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire Theatre between 7 and 9 March 2008. Blunstone and Argent&#x27;s respective websites had advertised that the concert of 8 March was recorded for a CD and DVD release later in 2008, and the CD was officially posted by Amazon.com to be pre-sold for a release of 1 July 2008. Both CD and DVD were officially released in the UK and several other countries.

In 2006, Argent performed and toured with Ringo Starr as part of the All-Starr Band. Argent performed the Zombies&#x27; songs &quot;She&#x27;s Not There&quot; and &quot;Time of the Season&quot; as well as &quot;Hold Your Head Up&quot; from his other musical group, Argent.

In 2010, Ace Records released a series of six 7-inch vinyl EPs. All the tracks were new to vinyl, with some rarities taken from the &quot;Zombie Heaven&quot; box set, as well as previously unreleased material. Tom Toomey replaced Airey on guitar. In 2011, &quot;The Zombies featuring Colin Blunstone &amp; Rod Argent&quot; released their new studio album &quot;Breathe Out, Breathe In&quot;. Reviews were generally strong, and included 4-star reviews from publications including &quot;Record Collector&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Independent&quot;. The band set out to tour annually in the UK, US, Canada and Netherlands. The 2011 tour included Japan, France, Germany, Greece and Israel.

In 2012, band members participated in the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at the Blacksmith&#x27;s Arms, a St Albans pub where the Zombies met for their first rehearsal.

On 19 July 2013, it was announced that the band would be appearing on the second annual Moody Blues Cruise, 2–7 April 2014 on the cruise ship MSC Ship Divina.

In 2014, the Zombies performed in festival circuits, including the Austin Psych Festival and San Francisco Stern Grove Festival. The next year, the band announced they would embark on a 2015 American tour of the &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot; album with White and Grundy returning.

The Zombies&#x27; sixth album, &quot;Still Got That Hunger&quot;, produced by Chris Potter, was announced for a release date of 9 October 2015. The album&#x27;s recording was successfully funded by crowdfunding service PledgeMusic during August 2014. The Zombies toured the US in the autumn of 2015 to promote &quot;Still Got That Hunger&quot; and were again joined by surviving former members White and Grundy, along with keyboardist Darian Sahanaja and White&#x27;s wife Viv Boucherat (on backing vocals) to play the entire &quot;Odessey &amp; Oracle&quot; album. On 30 October 2015, the Zombies made a guest appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

The Zombies most recent album, Different Game, was released in March 2023. Originally recorded after the groups Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2019, the recording was put on hold when the Covid pandemic hit. According to the band, the album was recorded to sound like a live performance to &quot;capture that magical, fleeting quality of energy and immediacy of performance&quot;. The album was released on Cooking Vinyl. A track from the album, Dropped Reeling &amp; Stupid, was released as a single, their first since 1969.

A documentary, Hung Up On A Dream, was released in November 2023. The film went through the history of the band, including how they were formed, their prime in the 1960s, and the band members subsequent careers and reforming the Zombies. The documentary was won two awards and was nominated once for events including Kraków Film Festival, Nantucket Film Festival, and Borrego Springs Film Festival.

==== Rod Argent&#x27;s retirement from touring ====
On 11 July 2024, shortly after celebrating his 79th birthday and 52nd wedding anniversary in London, the band announced on social media that Rod Argent had suffered a stroke. He was advised by doctors to take &quot;several months of rest and recuperation&quot;, and so, made the decision to stop touring.

===50th anniversary of &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;===
In 2017, the four surviving original members (Colin Blunstone, Rod Argent, Chris White and Hugh Grundy) re-united for a North American tour marking the 50th anniversary of the recording of &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;. The first stop on this tour was a first-time performance in Jamaica, as the featured artist on the Flower Power Cruise on the Celebrity Summit while in port in Falmouth. A popular podcast, S-Town, used &quot;A Rose for Emily&quot; as its closing music. This exposure helped The Zombies land a guest appearance on &quot;Conan&quot; in May 2017.

Commenting on the album&#x27;s half-century of popularity, Argent said, “At the time we made it, we would have thought it was complete craziness that the songs would resonate 50 years later&quot;.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame===
On 16 October 2013, the Zombies were announced as nominees for inclusion to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the first nomination for the band since coming into eligibility in 1990. The Zombies were nominated again for the Hall in 2016 and in October 2017. They were announced as one of seven inductees for the 2019 class in December 2018. The band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

===Most recent tours===
In May 2019, the Zombies announced a co-headlining tour with Brian Wilson and Al Jardine of The Beach Boys called &quot;Something Great From ’68’&quot; featuring The Zombies performing &quot;Odessey and Oracle&quot;, in addition to other greatest hits. This tour would also feature the four surviving original members (Colin Blunstone, Rod Argent, Chris White and Hugh Grundy) in addition to the band&#x27;s current line-up.

In late 2021, the band announced they would be undertaking extensive tours of Britain, the US, Canada, and Europe between February and September 2022. However, in January 2022 it was announced that the UK part of the tour would be postponed until 2023.

In October 2023, the band performed at the Royal Oak Music Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan.

=== Begin Here festival ===
In 2024, the band announced that they would host a &quot;Begin Here&quot; festival in their hometown of St Albans between 8–10 November 2024. The festival includes live performances, fan meet and greets, Q&amp;A&#x27;s, and other activities hosted by Argent, Blunstone, Grundy, and White, as well as a section talking about the solo works of Chris White. It will include the bands first live performance since Argent&#x27;s retirement from touring. Keyboard musician Danny Mattin took up the baton for Rod Argent at the Saturday night headline concert at the Eric Morecombe centre.

<text>A juggalo (feminine juggalette, or juggala in Spanish) is a fan of the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse or any other hip hop group signed to Psychopathic Records. Juggalos have developed their own idioms, slang, and characteristics. The Gathering of the Juggalos, alternatively known as just &quot;The Gathering&quot;, is a notable annual festival held by juggalos and the artists that they support, which have included rap stars such as Busta Rhymes, Ice Cube, and MC Hammer; over its first eleven events (2000–2010), the festival drew a total attendance of about 107,500 fans, averaging nearly 9,800 per year, with a peak of 20,000 in 2010.

== History ==

The term juggalo originated during a 1994 live performance by Insane Clown Posse. During the song &quot;The Juggla&quot;, Violent J addressed the audience as &quot;Juggalos&quot;, and the positive response resulted in Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope using the word thereafter to refer to themselves and their friends, family, and fans, including other Psychopathic Records artists. The fanbase boomed following the release of their third album, &quot;Riddle Box&quot;, in 1995, leading Insane Clown Posse to write the songs &quot;What Is a Juggalo?&quot; and &quot;Down With the Clown&quot; for their 1997 album &quot;The Great Milenko&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

The roots music journal &quot;No Depression&quot; classified Juggalos as &quot;goth clowns&quot;, as well as &quot;a true community of music-lovers with a strange and warped view of today’s music scene and a strong connection to modern hillbilly culture.&quot; According to Shaggy 2 Dope, &quot;[Juggalos come] from all walks of life – from poverty, from rich, from all religions, all colors. ... It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re born with a silver spoon in your mouth, or a crack rock in your mouth.&quot; Juggalos have compared themselves to a family. However, the subculture is most predominant in rural North America.

Common characteristics of identifying a member of the Juggalo subculture are as follows:

* Drinking and spraying the inexpensive soft drink Faygo 
* Listening to horrorcore and other types of underground rap music
* Wearing face paint, generally those either like an evil clown or perhaps similar to corpse paint
* Wearing Hatchet Gear or Chapter 17 branded clothes
* Having the Hatchet man logo applied on personal effects and, die cast, worn as jewelry
* Doing hair in the &quot;spider legs&quot; style, i.e. like the Twiztid members
* Displaying the gesture of &quot;wicked clown&quot;, the &quot;westside&quot; sign with the left hand and the &quot;C&quot; sign in American Sign Language with the right, with arms crossed over
* Making and responding to &quot;whoop whoop&quot; calls
*Expressing a (generally) tongue-in-cheek obsession with murder, committed with a blade weapon

Juggalos view the lyrics of Psychopathic Records artists, which are often violent, as a catharsis for aggression.

Many characteristics of the Juggalo culture originated in the 1980s, when Joseph Bruce (Violent J) and his family were living in poverty. He and his brother Robert received all their clothes from rummage sales, and their food from canned food drives held at their school. Due to their poverty, the Bruce Brothers were the butt of many jokes in school. However, the brothers were not ashamed of their living standards and instead embraced them. Joe even made a name for themselves, Floobs. According to Joe, a Floob was essentially a scrub, but not just an ordinary scrub. A Floob &quot;wore the same old shoes and shitty clothes from rummage sales ... but ... didn&#x27;t even have to be cool. [Floobs] turned [their] scrubbiness into something [they] could be proud of.&quot; Though Joe only specifically names himself and his brother as Floobs, he alludes to other Floobs whom he had not met or known of, but were living in the same conditions as he and his brother; the respect that Floobs had for each other and their family-like embrace of likewise people influenced the philosophy held among Juggalos.

== Charities, benefits and community activity of Juggalos ==

=== The Dead Stephanie Memorial Cleanup ===

Since 2008, Florida Juggalos organized The Juggalo Cleanup Crew to pick up trash for the Dead Stephanie Memorial Cleanup, in honor of Stephanie Harris, a high school student who died of diabetes in 2008.

=== Hatchet House and community outreach ===

In Buffalo, New York, a group of Juggalos formed the Juggalos outreach program and started cleaning up Buffalo&#x27;s East Side. In addition to the community cleanup, they run Hatchet House. The Hatchet House operates a 24/7 helpline referring community members in crises to services and serves as a base of operations for volunteer work and community service programs.

=== Juggalos Making A Difference (J.M.A.D.) ===

Juggalos in Denver, Colorado founded the charitable organization .

==Juggalo gangs==
Although the Juggalo subculture stems from the horrorcore subgenre of the general hip hop music fandom, criminal and gang-related activity has been attributed to self-described &#x27;Juggalos&#x27; in recent years, including assaults, drug trafficking, vandalism, burglary, shootings, theft, robbery, and numerous murders.

=== Interaction between violent and nonviolent Juggalos ===

According to a 2011 National Gang Intelligence Center report, the Juggalo subculture is split between violent and nonviolent factions. Some members of the Juggalos street gang even look down on non-criminal Juggalos, considering them to be weak, and criminal Juggalo gangs have committed attacks on non-gang-related Juggalos. Both Juggalo gang affiliates and nonviolent Juggalos believe in the Juggalo &quot;family.&quot; However, some nonviolent Juggalos do not believe that any gang-related activity should be associated with the Juggalo lifestyle.

=== Public and artist reactions ===

The Insane Clown Posse filed a lawsuit against the FBI about the gang-listing. In December 2012, ICP agreed to withdraw their involvement as plaintiffs.

Psychopathic Records launched the website juggalosfightback.com for fans to submit stories about unfair treatment by law enforcement. ICP hopes to use these stories in their legal battle to declassify Juggalos as a gang.

The classification of Juggalos as a criminal gang was ridiculed by the technology magazine &quot;Wired&quot; in a November 2011 article, with journalist Spencer Ackerman referring to previous scandals involving FBI harassment of Muslim-Americans.

On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any &quot;criminal intelligence information&quot; about Juggalos destroyed.

== Gathering of the Juggalos ==
The Gathering of the Juggalos (The Gathering or GOTJ) is an annual festival put on by Psychopathic Records, featuring performances by the entire label as well as numerous well-known musical groups and underground artists. It was founded by Robert Bruce, Insane Clown Posse, and its label in 2000. The Gathering has featured bands of a variety of genres within hip hop and rock, though the majority of the acts perform horrorcore and hardcore hip hop, similar to that of Psychopathic Records artists.

Described by Joseph Bruce as a &quot;Juggalo Woodstock&quot;, the Gathering of the Juggalos spans four days and includes concerts, wrestling, games, contests, autograph sessions, karaoke, and seminars with artists. According to the roots music journal &quot;No Depression&quot;, the event displays the Juggalo culture&#x27;s connection to hillbilly culture, by featuring &quot;backyard wrestling, Wild West imagery, county fair performers like Naughty by Nature and Gallagher [and] acres and acres of white guys [wearing wife beater shirts] getting high.&quot; Over its first eleven events, the festival has drawn an attendance of about 107,500 fans.

In July 2012, the media organization &quot;Vice&quot; released &quot;American Juggalo&quot;, a twenty-minute film documenting the festival, through their subsidiary music channel, Noisey. Sean Dunne directed the work.

On August 9, 2013, 24-year-old Cory Collins died at the festival, following three more deaths at previous festivals.

== Juggalo Day ==

In 2012, Shaggy and Violent J created the annual Juggalo Day, a yearly event to thank and celebrate its fans.

2013 started the album shows, playing a joker card album from front to back. 2013 was the &quot;Riddle Box Show&quot; in Detroit.

2014 was the &quot;Great Milenko Show&quot; in Columbus, Ohio.

2015 had the free concert called &quot;Take Me Home&quot; at the Detroit Masonic Temple.

== In popular media ==

Psychopathic Records launched the professional wrestling company Juggalo Championship Wrestling in 1999.

In 2009, Psychopathic Video filmed a documentary about Juggalos entitled &quot;A Family Underground&quot;.

Mainstream media has also made references to the Juggalo subculture. In 2009, television sketch comedy &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; began a reoccurring series of sketches about the &quot;Kickspit Underground Rock Festival&quot; which parodies Juggalos and the Gathering of the Juggalos. The following year, the television show &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; featured a Juggalo character in the episode &quot;Dee Reynolds: Shaping America’s Youth&quot;. In 2011, the television show &quot;Workaholics&quot; aired an episode called &quot;Straight Up Juggahos&quot; that revolved around Juggalos and an Insane Clown Posse concert. Later that year, an independent documentary entitled &quot;American Juggalo&quot; was released. &quot;Gathering Prey&quot;, the 2015 crime novel in the Lucas Davenport series by John Sandford, features a villain named Pilate who, with his disciples, are Juggalos. Much of the book takes place at the Gathering of the Juggalos. The 2018 film Family includes characters that identify as Juggalos and a pivotal scene takes place at a Gathering of the Juggalos.

=== Notable Juggalos ===

Several celebrities and other well-known figures have identified themselves as Juggalos. These include actors Kane Hodder and Charlie Sheen; professional wrestlers Kazushige Nosawa, Vampiro, Colt Cabana, and Willie Mack; and rappers Chuck D, Coolio, Kung Fu Vampire, MURS, MC Lars and Vanilla Ice.

<doc id="149215" wikidata="Q1068976" url="?curid=149215" title="Hilbert's Nullstellensatz">
<text>In mathematics, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz (German for &quot;theorem of zeros&quot;, or more literally, &quot;zero-locus-theorem&quot;) is a theorem that establishes a fundamental relationship between geometry and algebra. This relationship is the basis of algebraic geometry. It relates algebraic sets to ideals in polynomial rings over algebraically closed fields. This relationship was discovered by David Hilbert, who proved the Nullstellensatz in his second major paper on invariant theory in 1893 (following his seminal 1890 paper in which he proved Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem).

== Formulation ==
Let formula_1 be a field (such as the rational numbers) and formula_2 be an algebraically closed field extension of formula_1 (such as the complex numbers). Consider the polynomial ring formula_4 and let formula_5 be an ideal in this ring. The algebraic set formula_6 defined by this ideal consists of all formula_7-tuples formula_8 in formula_9 such that formula_10 for all formula_11 in Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz states that if &quot;p&quot; is some polynomial in formula_4 that vanishes on the algebraic set formula_6, i.e. formula_14 for all formula_15 in formula_6, then there exists a natural number formula_17 such that formula_18 is in formula_5.

An immediate corollary is the weak Nullstellensatz: The ideal formula_20 contains 1 if and only if the polynomials in formula_5 do not have any common zeros in &quot;Kn&quot;. Specializing to the case formula_22, one immediately recovers a restatement of the fundamental theorem of algebra: a polynomial &quot;P&quot; in formula_23 has a root in formula_24 if and only if deg &quot;P&quot; ≠ 0. For this reason, the (weak) Nullstellensatz has been referred to as a generalization of the fundamental theorem of algebra for multivariable polynomials. The weak Nullstellensatz may also be formulated as follows: if &quot;I&quot; is a proper ideal in formula_25 then V(&quot;I&quot;) cannot be empty, i.e. there exists a common zero for all the polynomials in the ideal in every algebraically closed extension of &quot;k&quot;. This is the reason for the name of the theorem, the full version of which can be proved easily from the &#x27;weak&#x27; form using the Rabinowitsch trick. The assumption of considering common zeros in an algebraically closed field is essential here; for example, the elements of the proper ideal (&quot;X&quot;2 + 1) in formula_26 do not have a common zero in formula_27

With the notation common in algebraic geometry, the Nullstellensatz can also be formulated as

:formula_28

for every ideal &quot;J&quot;. Here, formula_29 denotes the radical of &quot;J&quot; and I(&quot;U&quot;) is the ideal of all polynomials that vanish on the set &quot;U&quot;.

In this way, taking formula_30 we obtain an order-reversing bijective correspondence between the algebraic sets in &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; and the radical ideals of formula_31 In fact, more generally, one has a Galois connection between subsets of the space and subsets of the algebra, where &quot;Zariski closure&quot; and &quot;radical of the ideal generated&quot; are the closure operators.

As a particular example, consider a point formula_32. Then formula_33. More generally,

:formula_34

Conversely, every maximal ideal of the polynomial ring formula_35 (note that formula_2 is algebraically closed) is of the form formula_37 for some formula_38.

As another example, an algebraic subset &quot;W&quot; in &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; is irreducible (in the Zariski topology) if and only if formula_39 is a prime ideal.

== Proofs ==
There are many known proofs of the theorem. Some are non-constructive, such as the first one. Others are constructive, as based on algorithms for expressing or as a linear combination of the generators of the ideal.

===Using Zariski&#x27;s lemma===
Zariski&#x27;s lemma asserts that if a field is finitely generated as an associative algebra over a field , then it is a finite field extension of (that is, it is also finitely generated as a vector space). 

Here is a sketch of a proof using this lemma.

Let formula_40 (&quot;k&quot; algebraically closed field), &quot;I&quot; an ideal of &quot;A,&quot; and &quot;V&quot; the common zeros of &quot;I&quot; in formula_41. Clearly, formula_42. Let formula_43. Then formula_44 for some prime ideal formula_45 in &quot;A&quot;. Let formula_46 and formula_47 a maximal ideal in formula_48. By Zariski&#x27;s lemma, formula_49 is a finite extension of &quot;k&quot;; thus, is &quot;k&quot; since &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed. Let formula_50 be the images of formula_51 under the natural map formula_52 passing through formula_48. It follows that formula_54 and formula_55.

===Using resultants===
The following constructive proof of the weak form is one of the oldest proofs (the strong form results from the Rabinowitsch trick, which is also constructive).

The resultant of two polynomials depending on a variable and other variables is a polynomial in the other variables that is in the ideal generated by the two polynomials, and has the following properties: if one of the polynomials is monic in , every zero (in the other variables) of the resultant may be extended into a common zero of the two polynomials.

The proof is as follows.

If the ideal is principal, generated by a non-constant polynomial that depends on , one chooses arbitrary values for the other variables. The fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that this choice can be extended to a zero of .

In the case of several polynomials formula_56 a linear change of variables allows to suppose that formula_57 is monic in the first variable . Then, one introduces formula_58 new variables formula_59 and one considers the resultant
:formula_60

As is in the ideal generated by formula_56 the same is true for the coefficients in of the monomials in formula_62 So, if is in the ideal generated by these coefficients, it is also in the ideal generated by formula_63 On the other hand, if these coefficients have a common zero, this zero can be extended to a common zero of formula_56 by the above property of the resultant.

This proves the weak Nullstellensatz by induction on the number of variables.

=== Using Gröbner bases ===

A Gröbner basis is an algorithmic concept that was introduced in 1973 by Bruno Buchberger. It is presently fundamental in computational geometry. A Gröbner basis is a special generating set of an ideal from which most properties of the ideal can easily be extracted. Those that are related to the Nullstellensatz are the following:
*An ideal contains if and only if its reduced Gröbner basis (for any monomial ordering) is .
*The number of the common zeros of the polynomials in a Gröbner basis is strongly related to the number of monomials that are irreducibles by the basis. Namely, the number of common zeros is infinite if and only if the same is true for the irreducible monomials; if the two numbers are finite, the number of irreducible monomials equals the numbers of zeros (in an algebraically closed field), counted with multiplicities.
*With a lexicographic monomial order, the common zeros can be computed by solving iteratively univariate polynomials (this is not used in practice since one knows better algorithms).
* Strong Nullstellensatz: a power of belongs to an ideal if and only the saturation of by produces the Gröbner basis . Thus, the strong Nullstellensatz results almost immediately from the definition of the saturation.

== Generalizations ==
The Nullstellensatz is subsumed by a systematic development of the theory of Jacobson rings, which are those rings in which every radical ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. Given Zariski&#x27;s lemma, proving the Nullstellensatz amounts to showing that if &quot;k&quot; is a field, then every finitely generated &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;R&quot; (necessarily of the form formula_65) is Jacobson. More generally, one has the following theorem:

: Let formula_48 be a Jacobson ring. If formula_67 is a finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-algebra, then formula_67 is a Jacobson ring. Furthermore, if formula_69 is a maximal ideal, then formula_70 is a maximal ideal of formula_71, and formula_72 is a finite extension of formula_49.

Other generalizations proceed from viewing the Nullstellensatz in scheme-theoretic terms as saying that for any field &quot;k&quot; and nonzero finitely generated &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;R&quot;, the morphism formula_74 admits a section étale-locally (equivalently, after base change along formula_75 for some finite field extension formula_76). In this vein, one has the following theorem:
:Any faithfully flat morphism of schemes formula_77 locally of finite presentation admits a &quot;quasi-section&quot;, in the sense that there exists a faithfully flat and locally quasi-finite morphism formula_78 locally of finite presentation such that the base change formula_79 of formula_80 along formula_81 admits a section. Moreover, if formula_82 is quasi-compact (resp. quasi-compact and quasi-separated), then one may take formula_83 to be affine (resp. formula_83 affine and formula_81 quasi-finite), and if formula_80 is smooth surjective, then one may take formula_81 to be étale.
Serge Lang gave an extension of the Nullstellensatz to the case of infinitely many generators:

:Let formula_88 be an infinite cardinal and let formula_89 be an algebraically closed field whose transcendence degree over its prime subfield is strictly greater than formula_90. Then for any set formula_91 of cardinality formula_88, the polynomial ring formula_93 satisfies the Nullstellensatz, i.e., for any ideal formula_94 we have that formula_95.

== Effective Nullstellensatz ==
In all of its variants, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz asserts that some polynomial belongs or not to an ideal generated, say, by ; we have in the strong version, in the weak form. This means the existence or the non-existence of polynomials such that . The usual proofs of the Nullstellensatz are not constructive, non-effective, in the sense that they do not give any way to compute the .

It is thus a rather natural question to ask if there is an effective way to compute the (and the exponent in the strong form) or to prove that they do not exist. To solve this problem, it suffices to provide an upper bound on the total degree of the : such a bound reduces the problem to a finite system of linear equations that may be solved by usual linear algebra techniques. Any such upper bound is called an effective Nullstellensatz.

A related problem is the ideal membership problem, which consists in testing if a polynomial belongs to an ideal. For this problem also, a solution is provided by an upper bound on the degree of the . A general solution of the ideal membership problem provides an effective Nullstellensatz, at least for the weak form.

In 1925, Grete Hermann gave an upper bound for ideal membership problem that is doubly exponential in the number of variables. In 1982 Mayr and Meyer gave an example where the have a degree that is at least double exponential, showing that every general upper bound for the ideal membership problem is doubly exponential in the number of variables. 

Since most mathematicians at the time assumed the effective Nullstellensatz was at least as hard as ideal membership, few mathematicians sought a bound better than double-exponential. In 1987, however, W. Dale Brownawell gave an upper bound for the effective Nullstellensatz that is simply exponential in the number of variables. Brownawell&#x27;s proof relied on analytic techniques valid only in characteristic 0, but, one year later, János Kollár gave a purely algebraic proof, valid in any characteristic, of a slightly better bound.

In the case of the weak Nullstellensatz, Kollár&#x27;s bound is the following:

:Let be polynomials in variables, of total degree . If there exist polynomials such that , then they can be chosen such that 
::formula_96 
:This bound is optimal if all the degrees are greater than 2.

If is the maximum of the degrees of the , this bound may be simplified to 
:formula_97

An improvement due to M. Sombra is

:formula_98

His bound improves Kollár&#x27;s as soon as at least two of the degrees that are involved are lower than 3.

==Projective Nullstellensatz==
We can formulate a certain correspondence between homogeneous ideals of polynomials and algebraic subsets of a projective space, called the projective Nullstellensatz, that is analogous to the affine one. To do that, we introduce some notations. Let formula_99 The homogeneous ideal, 

:formula_100 

is called the &quot;maximal homogeneous ideal&quot; (see also irrelevant ideal). As in the affine case, we let: for a subset formula_101 and a homogeneous ideal &quot;I&quot; of &quot;R&quot;,

:formula_102

By formula_103 we mean: for every homogeneous coordinates formula_104 of a point of &quot;S&quot; we have formula_105. This implies that the homogeneous components of &quot;f&quot; are also zero on &quot;S&quot; and thus that formula_106 is a homogeneous ideal. Equivalently, formula_106 is the homogeneous ideal generated by homogeneous polynomials &quot;f&quot; that vanish on &quot;S&quot;. Now, for any homogeneous ideal formula_108, by the usual Nullstellensatz, we have:

:formula_109

and so, like in the affine case, we have:

:There exists an order-reversing one-to-one correspondence between proper homogeneous radical ideals of &quot;R&quot; and subsets of formula_110 of the form formula_111 The correspondence is given by formula_112 and formula_113

== Analytic Nullstellensatz (Rückert’s Nullstellensatz)==
The Nullstellensatz also holds for the germs of holomorphic functions at a point of complex &quot;n&quot;-space formula_114 Precisely, for each open subset formula_115 let formula_116 denote the ring of holomorphic functions on &quot;U&quot;; then formula_117 is a &quot;sheaf&quot; on formula_114 The stalk formula_119 at, say, the origin can be shown to be a Noetherian local ring that is a unique factorization domain.

If formula_120 is a germ represented by a holomorphic function formula_121, then let formula_122 be the equivalence class of the set 

:formula_123

where two subsets formula_124 are considered equivalent if formula_125 for some neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of 0. Note formula_122 is independent of a choice of the representative formula_127 For each ideal formula_128 let formula_129 denote formula_130 for some generators formula_131 of &quot;I&quot;. It is well-defined; i.e., is independent of a choice of the generators.

For each subset formula_132, let 

:formula_133

It is easy to see that formula_134 is an ideal of formula_135 and that formula_136 if formula_137 in the sense discussed above.

The analytic Nullstellensatz then states: for each ideal formula_138,

:formula_139

where the left-hand side is the radical of &quot;I&quot;.

<doc id="149216" wikidata="Q126826" url="?curid=149216" title="Aerosmith">
<text>Aerosmith is an American rock band formed in Boston in 1970. The group consists of lead vocalist Steven Tyler, bassist Tom Hamilton, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarists Joe Perry and Brad Whitford. Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has also incorporated elements of pop rock, heavy metal, glam metal, and rhythm and blues, and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. Aerosmith is sometimes referred to as &quot;the Bad Boys from Boston&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Greatest Rock and Roll Band&quot;. The primary songwriting team of Tyler and Perry is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Toxic Twins&quot;.

Perry and Hamilton were originally in a band together, the Jam Band, where they met up with Tyler, Kramer, guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith; in 1971, Tabano was replaced by Whitford. They released a string of multi-platinum albums starting with their eponymous debut in 1973, followed a year later by &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;. The band broke into the mainstream with their next two albums, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1975) and &quot;Rocks&quot; (1976). &quot;Draw the Line&quot; and &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot; followed in 1977 and 1979, respectively. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles, including their first Top 40 hit &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; and the Top 10 hits &quot;Dream On&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way&quot;. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a following of fans, often referred to as the &quot;Blue Army&quot;. Drug addiction and internal conflict led to the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively. The band did not fare well and the album &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; (1982) failed to match previous successes.

Perry and Whitford returned to Aerosmith in 1984. After a comeback tour, they recorded &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot; (1985), which did not meet commercial expectations. It was not until a 1986 collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. on a remake of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, and the band&#x27;s multi-platinum album, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; (1987), that they regained their previous level of popularity. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums &quot;Pump&quot; (1989), &quot;Get a Grip&quot; (1993), and &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (1997), while they embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. Their biggest hits during this period included &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Rag Doll&quot;, &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, &quot;What it Takes&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, and &quot;Crazy&quot;. The band also filmed popular music videos and made notable appearances in television, film, and video games. In 1998, they achieved their first number-one hit with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; from and the following year, their roller coaster attraction opened at Walt Disney World. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock history. Additional albums &quot;Just Push Play&quot; (which included the hit &quot;Jaded&quot;), &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; (a collection of blues covers), and &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot; followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012, respectively. In 2008, they released &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game. From 2019 to 2022, the band had a , which was interrupted from 2020 to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. After Tyler suffered (and ultimately failed to recover from) a vocal injury in 2023 during the third date of their farewell tour, the band retired from touring in 2024.

Aerosmith is the best-selling American hard rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 85 million records in the United States. With 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most total certifications by an American group and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. They have achieved twenty-one Top 40 hits on the US Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were ranked number 57 and 30, respectively, on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s and VH1&#x27;s lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and in 2020, the band received the MusiCares Person of the Year award.

==History==
===Formation (1964–1970)===
In 1964, Steven Tyler formed his own band called the Strangeurs—later Chain Reaction—in Yonkers, New York. Meanwhile, Perry and Hamilton formed the Jam Band (commonly known as &quot;Joe Perry&#x27;s Jam Band&quot;), which was based on free-form and blues. Hamilton and Perry moved to Boston, Massachusetts in September 1969. There they met Joey Kramer, a drummer from Yonkers, New York. Kramer knew Tyler and had always hoped to play in a band with him. Kramer, a Berklee College of Music student, decided to leave the school, and joined Jam Band.

In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band played at the same gig in New Hampshire. Tyler immediately loved Jam Band&#x27;s sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, who had been a drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting that he would take part only if he could be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was formed. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.

The members of the band reportedly spent afternoons getting high and watching &quot;Three Stooges&quot; reruns. One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting to try to come up with a name. Kramer said that, when he was in school, he would write the word &quot;aerosmith&quot; all over his notebooks. The name had popped into his head after listening to Harry Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;Aerial Ballet&quot;, which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer&#x27;s bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought he was referring to the Sinclair Lewis novel they were required to read in high school English class. &quot;No, not Arrowsmith,&quot; Kramer explained. &quot;A-E-R-O...Aerosmith.&quot; The band settled upon this name after also considering &quot;the Hookers&quot; and &quot;Spike Jones&quot;. At some point prior to the weekend of December 25, 1971, they were known as &quot;Fox Chase&quot;.

Soon, the band hired Ray Tabano, a childhood friend of Tyler, as rhythm guitarist and began playing local shows. Aerosmith played their first gig in Mendon, Massachusetts at Nipmuc Regional High School (now Miscoe Hill Middle School) on November 6, 1970. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, who also attended the Berklee School of Music, and was formerly a member of the band Earth Inc. Whitford, from Reading, Massachusetts, had played at Reading&#x27;s AW Coolidge Middle School. Other than a period from July 1979 to April 1984, the line-up of Tyler, Perry, Hamilton, Kramer, and Whitford has stayed the same.

===Record deal, &quot;Aerosmith&quot;, &quot;Get Your Wings&quot;, and &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; (1971–1975)===
After forming the band and finalizing the lineup in 1971, the band started to garner some local success doing live shows. Originally booked through the Ed Malhoit Agency, the band signed a promotion deal with Frank Connelly, and eventually secured a management deal with David Krebs and Steve Leber in 1972. Krebs and Leber invited Columbia Records President Clive Davis to see the band at Max&#x27;s Kansas City in New York City. Aerosmith was not originally scheduled to play that night at the club, but they paid out of their own pockets to secure a place on the bill, reportedly the only band ever to do so at Max&#x27;s. &quot;No Surprize&quot; from their &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot; album celebrated the moment their fame rose.

Aerosmith signed with Columbia in mid-1972 for a reported $125,000, and recorded their debut album, &quot;Aerosmith&quot;. Released in January 1973, the album peaked at number 166. The album was straightforward rock and roll with well-defined blues influences, laying the groundwork for Aerosmith&#x27;s signature blues rock sound. Although the highest-charting single from the album was &quot;Dream On&quot; at number 59, several tracks, such as &quot;Mama Kin&quot; and &quot;Walkin&#x27; the Dog&quot;, would become staples of the band&#x27;s live shows, and received airplay on rock radio. The album reached gold status initially, eventually went on to sell two million copies, and was certified double platinum after the band reached mainstream success over a decade later. After constant touring, the band released their second album, &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; in 1974, the first of a string of multi-platinum albums produced by Jack Douglas. This album included the rock radio hits &quot;Same Old Song and Dance&quot; and &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;, a cover done previously by the Yardbirds. The album also contained several fan favorites, including &quot;Lord of the Thighs&quot;, &quot;Seasons of Wither&quot;, and &quot;S.O.S. (Too Bad)&quot;, darker songs that have become staples in the band&#x27;s live shows. To date, &quot;Get Your Wings&quot; has sold three million copies.

In 1975, Aerosmith released their third album, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, which established Aerosmith as international stars, competing with the likes of Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones. Originally derided as Rolling Stones knockoffs in part due to the physical resemblance between lead singers Steven Tyler and Mick Jagger, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; showed that Aerosmith was a unique and talented band in their own right. &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; was an immediate success, starting with the single &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first Top 40 hit. This was followed by a successful re-release of &quot;Dream On&quot; which hit No. 6, becoming their best charting single of the 1970s. &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, re-released in 1976, reached the Top 10 in early 1977.

In addition, &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Big Ten Inch Record&quot; (a song originally recorded by Bull Moose Jackson) became concert staples. As a result of this success, both of the band&#x27;s previous albums re-charted. &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; has gone on to become the band&#x27;s bestselling studio album in the United States, with certified US sales of nine million copies. The band toured in support of &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, where they started to get more recognition. Also around this time, the band established their home base as &quot;the Wherehouse&quot; in Waltham, Massachusetts, where they would record and rehearse music, as well as conduct business.

===&quot;Rocks&quot;, &quot;Draw the Line&quot;, and &quot;Live! Bootleg&quot; (1976–1978)===

In 1976, Aerosmith&#x27;s fourth album was &quot;Rocks,&quot; which music historian Greg Prato described as &quot;captur[ing] Aerosmith at their most raw and rocking&quot;. It went platinum swiftly and featured two Top 40 hits, &quot;Last Child&quot; and &quot;Back in the Saddle&quot;, as well as the ballad &quot;Home Tonight&quot;, which also charted. &quot;Rocks&quot; would eventually go on to sell over four million copies. Both &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot; are highly regarded, especially in the hard rock genre: they appear on such lists as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and are cited as influential by members of Guns N&#x27; Roses, Metallica, and Mötley Crüe. Kurt Cobain also listed &quot;Rocks&quot; as one of the albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana&#x27;s sound in his journal in 1993. Soon after &quot;Rocks&quot; was released, the band continued to tour heavily, this time headlining their own shows, including large stadiums and rock festivals.

In 1977, Aerosmith released their fifth album, &quot;Draw the Line&quot;. Its recording was affected by the band&#x27;s excesses, but the record still had memorable moments. The title track charted just shy of the Top 40 and remains a live staple, and &quot;Kings and Queens&quot; also charted. The album went on to sell two million copies. The band toured extensively in support of the album, but drug abuse and the fast-paced life of touring and recording began affecting their performances. Tyler and Perry became known as &quot;the Toxic Twins&quot; due to their notorious abuse of drugs on and off the stage. Tyler later commented, &quot;I&#x27;ve spent $64 million on drugs&quot;; Perry scoffed later, &quot;There&#x27;s no fucking way in the world you could spend that much money on drugs and still be alive. It makes a good headline – but, practically speaking, that was probably a very small portion of where we spent our money.&quot;

While continuing to tour and record in the late 1970s, Aerosmith appeared in the &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; movie. Their cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Come Together&quot;, from the soundtrack, was the band&#x27;s last Top 40 hit for nearly 10 years. The double vinyl &quot;Live! Bootleg&quot;, issued in 1978, captured the band&#x27;s rawness during the &quot;Draw the Line&quot; tour. The standalone single &quot;Chip Away the Stone&quot;, also released in 1978, charted at number 77.

===Departures of Joe Perry and Brad Whitford, &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, and &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; (1979–1984)===
In 1979, the band started work on their next album, &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, but Aerosmith decided to go on tour during a break in the recording schedule. As the decade was about to conclude, the band&#x27;s drug use began taking its toll, and tensions were slowly coming to a head. The band&#x27;s touring schedule brought them to Cleveland Stadium on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the World Series of Rock festival. Pandemonium erupted backstage when Joe Perry&#x27;s wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton&#x27;s wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife&#x27;s antics, and after the course of the argument, Perry left Aerosmith (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). Upon his departure, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure, Perry formed his own side project known as The Joe Perry Project.

Since there was still work to be done on &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry&#x27;s place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts, and Richie Supa, the band&#x27;s longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire Jimmy Crespo to take over as the next full-time guitarist. &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot; was released in November 1979, but managed to sell only enough records to be certified gold at the time, although it would eventually sell enough copies to be certified platinum by 1994. The only single the album spawned, a cover of &quot;Remember (Walking in the Sand)&quot; by the Shangri-Las, peaked at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.

The tour for &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot; commenced shortly thereafter, but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler&#x27;s drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached rock bottom in 1980, when he collapsed on stage during a show in Portland, Maine, and did not get up for the remainder of the set. Also in 1980, Aerosmith released their first compilation album, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. While the compilation didn&#x27;t chart very high initially, it gained popularity later, and went on to become the band&#x27;s best selling album in the United States, with sales of 12 million copies. In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.

In 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot;, which saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. However, after the first song for the album, &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, was recorded, Brad Whitford left the band and formed a duo with Derek St. Holmes, with whom he recorded a self-titled album, which failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.

With Rick Dufay taking Whitford&#x27;s place, &quot;Rock in a Hard Place&quot; was released on August 27, 1982. The album reached number 32 on the Billboard 200 album chart. Only one single charted, the aforementioned &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, which peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart. As with the tour for &quot;Night in the Ruts&quot;, Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues, and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a homecoming arena show in Worcester, Massachusetts, Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.

On February 14, 1984, Perry (by then divorced from his first wife Elissa) and Whitford saw Aerosmith perform at Boston&#x27;s Orpheum Theater. Shortly thereafter, discussions began to reintegrate the two into the band and several months later, the original members of Aerosmith officially reunited. Steven Tyler recalls:

===Back in the Saddle reunion tour, &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, and drug rehab (1984–1986)===
In 1984, Aerosmith embarked on a reunion tour called the Back in the Saddle Tour, which led to the live album &quot;Classics Live II&quot;. While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members. With their drug problems still not behind them, the group was signed to Geffen Records, and began working on a comeback. Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band&#x27;s old label Columbia continued to reap the benefits of Aerosmith&#x27;s comeback, releasing the live companion albums &quot;Classics Live I and II&quot; and the collection &quot;Gems&quot;.

In 1985, the band released the album &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, their first studio album since reuniting. While the album did receive some positive reviews, it only went gold and failed to produce a hit single or generate any widespread interest. The album&#x27;s most notable track, &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot;, was in fact a cover of a song originally recorded by the Joe Perry Project and released on that band&#x27;s album of the same name. Nevertheless, the band became a popular concert attraction once again, touring in support of &quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, well into 1986. In 1986, in an unprecedented crossover collaboration, Aerosmith (largely the additional contributions of leaders Tyler and Perry) appeared on Run–D.M.C.&#x27;s cover of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, a track blending rock and roll with hip hop. In reaching number 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, the song and its frequently-aired video resurrected Aerosmith&#x27;s career by introducing the band&#x27;s music to a new generation.

Despite their resurrecting performance, the band members&#x27; drug problems still stood in their way. In 1986, Tyler completed a successful drug rehabilitation program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager Tim Collins, who believed that the band&#x27;s future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated in time. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs over the course of the next couple of years. According to the band&#x27;s tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 that he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab. Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of &quot;Done With Mirrors&quot;, and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.

===&quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; and &quot;Pump&quot; (1987–1991)===
&quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; was released in August 1987, becoming a major hit and the band&#x27;s bestselling album in over a decade (selling 5 million copies in the US), with all three of its singles (&quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Rag Doll&quot;) reaching the Top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Steven Tyler reveals in his autobiography that the album was &quot;...the first one we ever did sober.&quot; Part of &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;″s commercial success involved producer Bruce Fairbairn whose production touches (such as sound effects and high-quality recording) added interest to the album and the use of outside songwriters such as Desmond Child, Jim Vallance, and Holly Knight who assisted the band with lyrics. While the group was initially hesitant to using outside songwriters, including Tyler being furious for Knight getting songwriting credits for changing one word (&quot;Rag Time&quot; became &quot;Rag Doll&quot;), the method paid off, as &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot; became the band&#x27;s most successful album in a decade. The group went on a subsequent tour with labelmates Guns N&#x27; Roses (who have cited Aerosmith as a major influence), which was intense at times because of Aerosmith&#x27;s new struggle to stay clean amidst Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; well-publicized, rampant drug use.
Aerosmith&#x27;s next album was even more successful. &quot;Pump&quot;, released in September 1989, featured three Top Ten singles: &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, and &quot;What It Takes&quot;, as well as the Top 30 &quot;The Other Side&quot;, re-establishing the band as a serious musical force. &quot;Pump&quot; was a critical and commercial success, eventually selling 7 million copies, spawning several music videos that were in regular rotation on MTV, and achieving four-star ratings from major music magazines. &quot;Pump&quot; ranked as the fourth-bestselling album of 1990. The band also won its first Grammy in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, for &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;. In addition, the video for &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; won two Video Music Awards and was ranked as one of the 100 greatest videos of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, MTV, and VH1. Like &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot; was produced by Bruce Fairbairn, who added production touches such as instrumental interludes that provided transitions between songs to give the album a more complete sound, as well as the Margarita Horns, who added horns to tracks such as &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot; and &quot;The Other Side&quot;. Rock critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that &quot;Pump&quot; &quot;revels in [pop concessions] without ever losing sight of Aerosmith&#x27;s dirty hard rock core&quot;, going on to say that, &quot;such ambition and successful musical eclectism make &quot;Pump&quot; rank with &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Rocks&quot;.&quot; The recording process for &quot;Pump&quot; was documented in the video &quot;The Making of Pump&quot;, which has since been re-released as a DVD. The music videos for the album&#x27;s singles were featured on the release &quot;Things That Go Pump in the Night&quot;, which quickly went platinum.

In support of &quot;Pump&quot;, the band embarked on the 12-month Pump Tour, which lasted for most of 1990. On February 21, 1990, the band appeared in a &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; debating the fall of communism and the Soviet Union, and performed their recent hits &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; and &quot;Monkey on My Back&quot;. The appearance of the band in the &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; sketch was later ranked by E! as the number-one moment in the history of the program. On August 11, 1990, the band&#x27;s performance on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Unplugged&quot; aired. In October 1990, the Pump Tour ended, with the band&#x27;s first ever performances in Australia. That same year, the band was also inducted to the Hollywood Rock Walk. In November 1991, the band appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot; and released a box set titled &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;. In coordination with the release of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, the band&#x27;s 1975 hit &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; was re-mixed and re-released as a single, and a music video was created to promote the single. Also in 1991, the band performed their 1973 single &quot;Dream On&quot; with Michael Kamen&#x27;s orchestra for MTV&#x27;s 10th Anniversary special; this performance was used as the official music video for the song. In 1992, Tyler and Perry appeared live as guests of Guns N&#x27; Roses during the latter&#x27;s 1992 worldwide pay-per-view show in Paris, performing a medley of &quot;Mama Kin&quot; (which GN&#x27;R covered in 1986) and &quot;Train Kept-A Rollin&quot;.

===&quot;Get a Grip&quot; and &quot;Big Ones&quot; (1992–1995)===
The band took a brief break before recording their follow-up to &quot;Pump&quot; in 1992. Despite significant shifts in mainstream music at the beginning of the 1990s, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Get a Grip&quot; was just as successful commercially, becoming their first album to debut at number 1 and racking up sales of 7 million copies in a two-and-a-half-year timespan and over 20 million copies worldwide. The first singles were the hard rocking &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; and &quot;Eat the Rich&quot;. Though many critics were unimpressed by the focus on the subsequent interchangeable power-ballads in promoting the album, all three (&quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, and &quot;Crazy&quot;) proved to be huge successes on radio and MTV. The music videos featured then up-and-coming actress Alicia Silverstone; her provocative performances earned her the title of &quot;the Aerosmith chick&quot; for the first half of the decade. Steven Tyler&#x27;s daughter Liv Tyler was also featured in the &quot;Crazy&quot; video. The band won two Grammy Awards for songs from this album in the category of Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal: for &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Crazy&quot; in 1995.

During the making of &quot;Get a Grip&quot;, the management and record company brought in a variety of professional songwriting collaborators to help give nearly all the songs on the album more commercial appeal, a trend which would continue until the early 2000s. However, this led to accusations of selling out that would continue throughout the 1990s. In addition to Aerosmith&#x27;s grueling 18-month world tour in support of &quot;Get a Grip&quot;, the band also did a number of things to help promote themselves and their album and appeal to youth culture, including the appearance of the band in the movie &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; where they performed two songs, the appearance of the band and their music in the video games &quot;Revolution X&quot; and &quot;Quest for Fame&quot;, performing at Woodstock &#x27;94, using their song &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; in &quot;The Beavis and Butt-head Experience&quot;, and opening their own club, The Mama Kin Music Hall, in Boston in 1994. That same year saw the release of the band&#x27;s compilation for Geffen Records, entitled &quot;Big Ones&quot; featuring their biggest hits from &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot;, and &quot;Get a Grip&quot;, &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; from the &quot;Beavis and Butt-head Experience&quot;, as well as two new songs, &quot;Blind Man&quot; and &quot;Walk on Water&quot;, both of which experienced great success on the rock charts.

===&quot;Nine Lives&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; (1996–2000)===
Aerosmith had signed a $30 million contract for four records with Columbia Records/Sony Music in 1991, but had only recorded three of their six contractual albums with Geffen Records at that point (&quot;Done with Mirrors&quot;, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, and &quot;Pump&quot;). Between 1991 and 1996, they released two more albums with Geffen (&quot;Get a Grip&quot; and &quot;Big Ones&quot;), which meant they now had five albums with Geffen under their belt (along with a planned live compilation), which meant they could now begin recording for their new contract with Columbia. The band took time off with their families before working on their next album, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, which was plagued with personnel problems, including the firing of manager Tim Collins, who, according to band members, had nearly caused the band to break up. The album&#x27;s producer was also changed from Glen Ballard to Kevin Shirley. &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was released in March 1997. Reviews were mixed, and &quot;Nine Lives&quot; initially fell down the charts, although it had a long chart life and sold double platinum in the United States alone, fueled by its singles, &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot;, the ballad &quot;Hole in My Soul&quot;, and the crossover-pop smash &quot;Pink&quot; (which won the band their fourth Grammy Award in 1999 in the Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal category). It was followed by the over two-year-long Nine Lives Tour, which was plagued by problems including lead singer Steven Tyler injuring his leg at a concert, and Joey Kramer suffering second degree burns when his car caught fire at a gas station.
In 1998, in the midst of setbacks during the Nine Lives Tour, the band released the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;, the love theme, written by Diane Warren for the 1998 film &quot;Armageddon&quot;, starring Steven Tyler&#x27;s daughter Liv. The song became Aerosmith&#x27;s first and only number 1 single when it debuted at the top position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and stayed on top of the charts for four weeks. The song was nominated for an Academy Award in 1999. The song helped open Aerosmith up to a new generation and remains a slow-dance staple. 1998 also saw the release of the double-live album, &quot;A Little South of Sanity&quot;, which was assembled from performances on the Get a Grip and Nine Lives tours. The album went platinum shortly after its release. The band continued with their seemingly neverending world tours promoting &quot;Nine Lives&quot; and the &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot; single well into 1999.

In 1999, Aerosmith was chosen to be featured in the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, providing the ride&#x27;s soundtrack and theme at both Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios at the Walt Disney World Resort and, formerly, at Disneyland Paris in the Walt Disney Studios Park, which opened in 2002 and closed in 2019, to be replaced by an Iron Man and the Avengers attraction in the upcoming Avengers Campus. On September 9, 1999, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry reunited with Run–D.M.C. and were also joined by Kid Rock for a collaborative live performance of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; at the MTV Video Music Awards, a precursor to the Girls of Summer Tour. The band celebrated the new millennium with a brief tour of Japan, and also contributed the song &quot;Angel&#x27;s Eye&quot; to the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. In December 2000, they wrapped up work on their next album.

===&quot;Just Push Play&quot;, &quot;O, Yeah!&quot; and Rocksimus Maximus (2001–2003)===

The band entered their next decade by co-headlining with NSYNC the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show, titled &quot;The Kings of Rock and Pop&quot;, with appearances from Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige and Nelly. All of the stars collaborated with Aerosmith at the end for a performance of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;.

In March 2001, the band released their 13th studio album &quot;Just Push Play&quot;, which quickly went platinum, fueled by the Top 10 single &quot;Jaded&quot; and the appearance of the title track in Dodge commercials. They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame soon after their album was released, in late March 2001. Aerosmith is the only band to be inducted to the Hall of Fame with a song active in the charts (&quot;Jaded&quot;). Later that year, the band performed as part of the United We Stand: What More Can I Give benefit concert in Washington D.C. for 9/11 victims and their families. The band flew back to Indianapolis for a show the same night, as part of their Just Push Play Tour.

The band started 2002 by ending the Just Push Play tour, and simultaneously recording segments for their &quot;Behind the Music&quot; special on VH1, which not only chronicled the band&#x27;s history but also the band&#x27;s current activities and touring. The special was one of the few &quot;Behind the Music&quot;s to run two hours in length. In May, Aerosmith covered the &quot;Theme from Spider-Man&quot; for the soundtrack of the 2002 film of the same name. On June 27, the band performed at the official FIFA World Cup concert at Tokyo Stadium which took place during the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Korea/Japan. In July 2002, Aerosmith released a two-disc career-spanning compilation &quot;O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits&quot;, which featured the new single &quot;Girls of Summer&quot; and embarked on the Girls of Summer Tour with Kid Rock and Run–D.M.C. opening. &quot;O, Yeah!&quot; has since been certified double platinum. MTV honored Aerosmith with their mtvICON award in 2002. Performances included Pink covering &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;. Shakira performed &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, Kid Rock played &quot;Mama Kin&quot; and &quot;Last Child&quot;, Train performed &quot;Dream On&quot; and Papa Roach covered &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;. In addition, testimonials featured surprise guests Metallica, as well as Janet Jackson, Limp Bizkit singer Fred Durst, Alicia Silverstone and Mila Kunis.

In 2003, Aerosmith co-headlined with Kiss on the Rocksimus Maximus Tour, in preparation for release of their blues album. They also performed a song for &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot;, &quot;Lizard Love&quot;.

===&quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Joint&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Got a New Disguise&quot; (2004–2006)===
Aerosmith&#x27;s long-promised blues album &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo&quot; was released in 2004. This was a return to the band&#x27;s roots, including recording the album in live sessions, working with former producer Jack Douglas, and laying down their blues rock grit. It was followed by a live DVD, &quot;You Gotta Move&quot;, in December 2004, culled from performances on the Honkin&#x27; on Bobo Tour. &quot;Dream On&quot; was also featured in an advertising campaign for Buick in 2004, targeting that marque&#x27;s market which is now composed largely of people who were teenagers when the song first charted.

2005 saw Steven Tyler appear in the film &quot;Be Cool&quot;. Joe Perry released his self-titled solo album that same year. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, he was nominated for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for the track &quot;Mercy&quot;, but lost to Les Paul. In October 2005, Aerosmith released a CD/DVD &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Joint&quot;. The band hit the road for the Rockin&#x27; the Joint Tour on October 30 with Lenny Kravitz for a fall/winter tour of arenas in the largest US markets. The band planned to tour with Cheap Trick in the spring, hitting secondary markets in the US. Almost all of this leg of the tour was canceled, however. Dates were initially canceled one by one until March 22, 2006, when it was announced that lead singer Steven Tyler needed throat surgery, and the remaining dates on the tour were subsequently canceled.

Tyler and Perry performed with the Boston Pops Orchestra for their annual concert of July 4 on the Esplanade in 2006, a milestone as it was the first major event or performance since Steven Tyler&#x27;s throat surgery. Around this time, the band also announced that they would embark on the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in late 2006. On August 24, 2006, it was announced that Tom Hamilton was undergoing treatment for throat cancer. In order to make a full recovery, he sat out much of the Route of All Evil Tour until he was well again. Former Joe Perry Project bassist David Hull substituted for Hamilton until his return. On September 5, 2006, Aerosmith kicked off the Route of All Evil Tour with Mötley Crüe in Columbus, Ohio. The co-headlining tour took both bands to amphitheaters across North America through November 24, 2006. After that, a select few arena dates were added, some of which were with Mötley Crüe. The tour ended December 17, 2006.

On October 17, 2006, the compilation album &quot;Devil&#x27;s Got a New Disguise: The Very Best of Aerosmith&quot; was released. The album contained previous hits with the addition of two new songs, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Got a New Disguise&quot; and &quot;Sedona Sunrise&quot;, which were older outtakes re-recorded for the album. &quot;Devil&#x27;s Got a New Disguise&quot; peaked at number 15 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The album was intended to fulfill Aerosmith&#x27;s contract with Sony and tide fans over until the band&#x27;s new studio album was released.

===Touring, &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot; and unfinished album (2007–2009)===
In early 2007, the band announced a new World Tour, their first for nearly a decade to include dates outside North America or Japan. The band performed at London&#x27;s Hard Rock Cafe in February 2007 to promote their European tour which included a night in Hyde Park as part of the Hyde Park Calling festival sponsored by Hard Rock Cafe. In the spring, the band toured Latin America to sold-out stadium crowds. In the summer, the band toured Europe, performing at several major rock festivals and visiting some countries they had never played before. Additionally, the band played in Middle East countries such as the United Arab Emirates and India for the first time. The band also played a few select dates in California and Canada in late July. The July 21, 2007 concert in Prince Edward Island, was the largest in that province&#x27;s history. In September, the band performed eight dates in major markets in Northeastern North America. These shows were opened by Joan Jett. The band also played a private gig in Hawaii. A public show in Maui was canceled for logistical reasons, which spurred a class action lawsuit against the band. In April 2009, Aerosmith agreed to compensate all ticket buyers of the canceled show with a free ticket to a rescheduled Maui show to be held on October 20, 2009, along with reimbursements of all out-of-pocket expenses related to the show.
On November 1, 2007, the band entered the studio to work on the final studio album of their current contract with Sony. At the time, it was believed that the album would include both re-recorded tracks left off previous albums as well as brand new material. In an interview, guitarist Joe Perry revealed that in addition to creating a new album, the band was working closely with the makers of the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series to develop &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, a video game dedicated to the band&#x27;s music. The game was released on June 29, 2008, and contains many of their most popular songs. Steven Tyler announced on VH1 Classic Radio on September 4, 2008, that Aerosmith intended to enter the studio at the end of September 2008 to complete the band&#x27;s 15th studio album. Tyler also confirmed that the band planned to begin a new US tour in June 2009, in support of the as-yet-untitled album. This tour was supposed to be preceded by a concert in Venezuela on February 1, 2009. However, on January 15, 2009, Tyler said the band would be unable to play the gig because of a second knee injury of guitarist Joe Perry. In mid-February 2009, it was announced that the album would be produced by the famed Brendan O&#x27;Brien and that the album would likely be recorded live, like their earlier records. Although the band had hoped to finish the album before the tour started in June 2009, Perry said that the group &quot;realized there wasn&#x27;t any chance of getting [the album] finished before we hit the road for the summer.&quot; The tour featured ZZ Top as the opening act for most of the tour. The Aerosmith/ZZ Top Tour, presented by &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, was officially announced and the first dates released on April 8, 2009.

The tour was slated to take the band across North America from June to September 2009. The tour featured the band performing nearly all of the songs on their 1975 album &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; during the first seven dates of the tour and also featured Joe Perry sing lead vocals on the 1976 &quot;Combination&quot;. The tour was plagued with several health problems, however. Guitarist Brad Whitford had to sit out the first seven dates of the tour in order to recover from head surgery, after injuring his head getting out of his car. On June 28, 2009, at the band&#x27;s seventh show of the tour at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut, lead singer Steven Tyler injured his leg, which required seven shows to be postponed. As soon as the band resumed the tour on July 15, Whitford returned to the fold. However, Tom Hamilton had to depart the tour in order to recover from non-invasive surgery. On August 5, 2009, Tyler was rushed to the hospital after falling from the stage at a concert in Sturgis, South Dakota. He was helped up by security staff and taken backstage, before guitarist Joe Perry told the audience the show was over. Tyler was airlifted to Rapid City Regional Hospital, where he received treatment for head and neck injuries and a broken shoulder. In the wake of Tyler&#x27;s injuries, the band was forced to postpone five shows in Western Canada. On August 14, 2009, Aerosmith announced that they had decided to cancel the rest of their US tour dates with ZZ Top, due to Tyler&#x27;s injuries.

In the midst of the tour, Perry completed work on his fifth solo album, &quot;Have Guitar, Will Travel&quot; and drummer Joey Kramer released his autobiography, &quot;Hit Hard&quot;. Perry&#x27;s solo album was released on October 6, 2009.

After Tyler recovered from falling off stage, the band returned to the stage in mid-October for two shows in Hawaii, one in Maui which was rescheduled from 2007 and finally played as part of a legal settlement, and an additional show which was played in Honolulu. In early November, the band played a concert in Abu Dhabi at the Grand Prix.

===Tyler-Perry feud and Cocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock Tour (2009–2010)===
Tyler pulled out of a planned South American tour at the end of 2009 and seemed intent on pursuing solo projects, including his autobiography &quot;Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?&quot;. Tyler told &quot;Classic Rock magazine&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing yet, but it&#x27;s definitely going to be something Steven Tyler: working on the brand of myself – Brand Tyler.&quot; Meanwhile, guitarist Joe Perry toured the United States at the end of 2009, and Japan and the UK early in 2010.

In November 2009, Joe Perry stated that Tyler had not been in contact with the band and could be on the verge of quitting Aerosmith. Perry stated that the rest of the group was &quot;looking for a new singer to work with&quot;. It was reported that singer Lenny Kravitz had been approached for Steven Tyler&#x27;s position, which he then declined.

However, despite the rumors of him leaving the band, Tyler joined the Joe Perry Project onstage on November 10, 2009, at the Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, and Tyler and Perry performed the Aerosmith single &quot;Walk This Way&quot; together. According to sources at the event, Tyler assured the crowd that he was &quot;not quitting Aerosmith&quot;.

On December 22, 2009, &quot;People&quot; magazine reported that Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his addiction to painkillers, brought on by injuries to his knees, legs, and feet, that resulted from years of performing. In his statement, Tyler said he is grateful for the support he is receiving, is committed to getting things taken care of, and is eager to get back on stage and in the recording studio with his bandmates.

On January 20, 2010, Perry confirmed the band were about to audition for a new singer to replace Tyler. Perry said Tyler&#x27;s surgery to his legs would &quot;take him out of the picture&quot; for up to a year and a half, and in the meantime, the rest of the band wanted to continue performing. Perry also said that the band would be willing to continue working with Tyler in the future if the singer wanted to.

In response, Tyler&#x27;s attorney sent the band and its manager a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter and threatened further legal action against both if the band did not discontinue this effort to replace Tyler.

On February 15, 2010, it was announced that Aerosmith were to headline Download Festival at Donington Park, England in June 2010. Tyler was confirmed as the frontman for the show by festival promoter Andy Copping. It was announced that the band would precede the June 13, 2010 date with an appearance at the Sweden Rock Festival on June 10, 2010, in Sölvesborg. During the Donington show, Perry celebrated Tyler&#x27;s position as frontman, dubbing him &quot;the best lead singer on the planet&quot;. On February 24, the band announced the first batch of dates for their upcoming Cocked, Locked, Ready to Rock Tour. The tour saw the band play seven dates in South and Central America in May, followed by eleven dates in Europe, in June and early July. The band performed in Colombia, Peru and Greece for the first time in their career on this tour. The band performed 24 concerts in North America in late July, August, and September. Many of the concerts were in locations the band canceled on in 2009. As part of the tour, the band played Fenway Park in Boston with fellow Bostonians the J. Geils Band.
Problems on the band&#x27;s Cocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock Tour arose in August 2010, including Tyler accidentally hitting Joe Perry in the head with his microphone stand at a show in Wantagh, New York and Perry bumping into Tyler at the Toronto show, which caused Tyler to tumble off the stage. Perry suffered a minor head injury at the Wantagh show and Tyler was helped back up by fans and Perry at the Toronto show, and both shows went on. Around the same time as these incidents, tension flared again between Perry and Tyler due to Tyler&#x27;s plans to become a talent judge on &quot;American Idol&quot;. Perry criticized Tyler for not consulting the rest of the band, saying that he &quot;found out on the internet, like the rest of the world&quot; and that nobody else in the band knew anything about it.

On August 18, 2010, it was reported that Tyler officially signed on with the show. When asked about this in October, Perry declared he understood Tyler&#x27;s reasons and wished him luck, but stated that he would seek different projects – &quot;I&#x27;m tired of waiting around, so I&#x27;m not passing up anything right now&quot;.

While announcing the Cocked, Locked, and Ready to Rock Tour in 2009, Tyler and Perry said that the next item on the agenda was a new Aerosmith album, the group&#x27;s first since 2004&#x27;s &quot;Honkin&#x27; on Bobo.&quot; The group did some recording with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien in 2008 but halted because of Tyler&#x27;s health problems. Aerosmith bassist Tom Hamilton told the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; in September 2010 that Tyler believes he has the time and energy to continue fronting the band while also being a judge on &quot;American Idol&quot;.

Hamilton explained, &quot;Steven&#x27;s been very emphatic in saying that the way his time is arranged on the show leaves room to work on a record. He&#x27;s been taking great pains to remind everybody of that, so hopefully that&#x27;s the way it will come out.&quot; On November 5, 2010, Brad Whitford said the recording sessions will probably be in Los Angeles, where &quot;American Idol&quot; is headquartered, and a world tour would follow.

===Touring and &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot; (2010–2013)===
In a November 2010 interview reported at NME.com, drummer Joey Kramer confirmed that the band had every intention to finish and release their long-delayed album in 2011, stating, &quot;Really, at this point in time, the only thing that&#x27;s going to stop us is if someone out-and-out dies. Other than that, we&#x27;ve already been through what we&#x27;ve been through and stood the test of time. What else is there?&quot; On January 18, 2011, Tyler declared that &quot;Joe (Perry) has got some licks and I&#x27;ve got a bunch of songs that I&#x27;ve written for solo and/or Aerosmith&quot; and the band would start prepping the album that week.
On March 20, 2011, Aerosmith announced a new greatest hits album, &quot;Tough Love: Best of the Ballads&quot;, which was released on May 10, 2011. On May 14, 2011, the band announced a tour of Latin America in the fall of 2011. In June, Joe Perry announced that the band is going to meet at the recording studio to produce the next album of the band in July. On August 30, 2011, it was announced that the new album will be released around May 2012. The album will be produced by Jack Douglas, who produced four albums for the band in the 1970s. Aerosmith began their fall tour of Latin America and Japan on October 22, 2011, in Lima, Peru. As part of the tour, the band performed in Paraguay, Panama, and Ecuador for the first time in their careers. Their show in Asunción, Paraguay was postponed a day, after lead singer Steven Tyler sustained facial injuries after falling in his hotel room shower, due to a bout of food poisoning that dehydrated him and caused him to faint.
On March 11, 2012, Aerosmith was featured on an episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. The show included very candid interviews with the band members, interspersed with live performances from the band&#x27;s 2011 tour. Some of the comments the band members said about each other seemed to re-ignite past tensions in the band. However, on March 22, 2012, Joe Perry surprised Steven Tyler by performing &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for him on &quot;American Idol&quot;, as an early birthday present for Tyler. On March 26, 2012, Aerosmith announced a summer tour with Cheap Trick entitled the &quot;Global Warming Tour&quot;. On May 23, 2012, Aerosmith debuted their new single, &quot;Legendary Child&quot;, on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;. Shortly after, it was announced that their fifteenth studio album, &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;, would be released on November 6, 2012. On May 30, 2012, Aerosmith and Cheap Trick performed for Walmart shareholders. Aerosmith&#x27;s &quot;Global Warming Tour&quot; began June 16, 2012 in Minneapolis and took the band to 26 locations across North America through August 12, 2012. The band hinted that the tour would continue in October/November after the album release. On August 22, 2012, Aerosmith released two singles simultaneously, the rocker &quot;Lover Alot&quot; and the ballad &quot;What Could Have Been Love&quot;. On September 22, 2012, Aerosmith performed at the iHeartRadio music festival in Las Vegas. In advance of the release of their new album, the band performed on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;Today&quot;, and Tyler and Perry were interviewed on &quot;The Late Show&quot; and &quot;The View&quot;. In addition, Tyler, Perry and Whitford performed &quot;Dream On&quot; for the telethon &quot;Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together&quot; to raise funds for the victims of the namesake storm that struck the Northeastern United States. On November 5, 2012, Aerosmith performed an outdoor concert in front of their old apartment at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston to celebrate the release of their album and their Boston roots. &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot; was released on November 6, 2012. Two days later, the band began the 2nd leg of their Global Warming Tour, which took the band to 14 North American locations through December 13, 2012.

On January 21, 2013, Aerosmith released &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop Lovin&#x27; You&quot; (featuring Carrie Underwood) as the fourth single from &quot;Music from Another Dimension!&quot;. On February 20, 2013, it was announced that the band&#x27;s principal songwriters Steven Tyler and Joe Perry would be recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award at the society&#x27;s 30th Annual Pop Music Awards on April 17, 2013. Two days later, it was announced that the duo would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame at a ceremony to be held on June 13, 2013.
In late April 2013 and early May 2013, Aerosmith extended their Global Warming Tour to Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore. This marked the band&#x27;s first performances in Australia in 23 years, and the band&#x27;s first-ever performances in the latter four countries. Tom Hamilton had to miss the last three Australian shows due to illness, David Hull filled in for him. On May 5, 2013, Aerosmith cancelled their first-ever performance in Indonesia (scheduled for May 11, 2013) due to safety concerns, the actual threat was not released. On May 30, 2013, Aerosmith performed as part of the &quot;Boston Strong&quot; charity concert for victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. The band also performed at the Greenbrier Classic in West Virginia on July 6, 2013 at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut on July 10, 2013, four concerts in Japan in mid-August, and as part of the Harley-Davidson 110th Anniversary Concert series in Milwaukee on August 30, 2013. In the fall of 2013, Aerosmith extended their tour to Central and South America, including their first-ever performances in Guatemala, El Salvador and Uruguay. Hamilton had to depart the Latin American tour due to illness.

In July 2013, the band released the live concert DVD &quot;Rock for the Rising Sun&quot;, which also documented the band&#x27;s 2011 tour of Japan. The release was also screened in select theaters in October 2013.

===Solo endeavors and continued touring (2014–2018)===

On March 21, 2014, in tweets released by Joe Perry, Joey Kramer, and Slash, it was announced that Aerosmith would be touring North America with Slash (along with Myles Kennedy &amp; the Conspirators) in the summer of 2014. This followed a 17-date European tour that Aerosmith took from May 14, 2014, to July 2, 2014. The North American tour, known as the Let Rock Rule Tour, sent Aerosmith to 21 locations from July 10, 2014, to September 12, 2014.

Asked in May 2014 if Aerosmith would release a sixteenth studio album anytime soon, bassist Tom Hamilton replied, &quot;I hope soon. But I really don&#x27;t know what we are doing because we no longer have a record contract. We are finished with Columbia. So, there is nothing written in stone. We&#x27;ll see what the fans want.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; about what the future holds, Joe Perry admitted that, &quot;I don&#x27;t even know if making new albums makes sense anymore. Maybe we&#x27;ll just release an EP every six months. I don&#x27;t know what the future looks like.&quot;

On October 7, 2014, Perry released his autobiography &quot;Rocks: My Life in and Out of Aerosmith&quot;, co-written by David Ritz. Perry promoted the book with a book-signing tour that took him to 14 locations across the United States in the month of October. On February 26, 2015, Aerosmith premiered the film &quot;Aerosmith Rocks Donington&quot; in 300 movie theaters across North America; the concert video is from the band&#x27;s 2014 performance at Download Festival at Donington Park in Leicestershire, England. The video was released on DVD/Blu-ray on September 4, 2015.

On March 31, 2015, lead singer Steven Tyler stated that he was working on his first solo country album. On April 6, 2015, it was announced that Tyler signed a record deal with Scott Borchetta&#x27;s Dot Records (a division of the Big Machine Label Group). On May 13, 2015, Tyler released the lead single, &quot;Love is Your Name&quot;, from his forthcoming solo debut album. He promoted the song on the &quot;Bobby Bones Show&quot;, iHeartMedia, &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, and the &quot;American Idol&quot; season 14 finale.

On June 10, 2015, Aerosmith embarked on the Blue Army Tour, which sent the band to 17 North American locations through August 7, 2015, many of them in smaller venues in secondary markets that the band has either never performed in or hasn&#x27;t performed in many years. The band also played a one-off show in Moscow on September 5, 2015. On the tour, the band played several lesser-known deep cuts.

After the tour, Tyler completed work on his solo album, &quot;We&#x27;re All Somebody from Somewhere&quot;, which was released on July 15, 2016. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, a second single, &quot;Red, White &amp; You&quot;, was released in January 2016, followed by the third single (the title track) in June 2016. Meanwhile, Joe Perry worked with Alice Cooper and Johnny Depp on the side project Hollywood Vampires, which released their eponymous debut album in September 2015 and performed at the 58th Grammy Awards on February 15, 2016. Brad Whitford re-joined Derek St. Holmes for a handful of tour dates in November 2015 and a new Whitford/St. Holmes album that was made available to fans at their live performances and was scheduled for wide release in 2016. Tom Hamilton performed with Thin Lizzy at a handful of concert dates in Europe in the summer of 2016 and also joined Pearl Jam for a performance of &quot;Draw the Line&quot; at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park on August 7, 2015. Meanwhile, Joey Kramer became actively involved in his &quot;Rockin&#x27; &amp; Roastin&#x27;&quot; coffee business, which opened a location in Newry, Maine, in December 2015 and a second location in North Attleborough, Massachusetts in July 2016.

Since December 2015, in various interviews, Whitford, Tyler, and Perry all discussed the possibility of a farewell tour or &quot;wind-down tour&quot; slated to start in 2017. Perry has suggested the tour could last for two years and Tyler said it could potentially last &quot;forever&quot;, Whitford and Tyler also discussed the potential of doing one last studio album.
On July 10, 2016, Perry collapsed onstage at a concert he was performing with the Hollywood Vampires on Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York. It is believed he suffered cardiac arrest. He was revived and rushed to the hospital, where he was quickly upgraded to stable condition later that night. The Vampires continued the show without Perry that evening and continued the rest of their tour, but canceled an appearance on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;. After resting for a few days, Perry made a complete recovery and returned to the Hollywood Vampires tour.

From September through October 2016 Aerosmith embarked on a nine-date tour of Latin America, called the Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Rumble Tour, preceded by a performance at the Kaaboo Festival in San Diego, California on September 17. In November 2016, Aerosmith announced that they would be going on a &quot;farewell&quot; tour in Europe in the spring and summer of 2017, titled the Aero-Vederci Baby! Tour. The tour launched in Tel Aviv, Israel on May 17, 2017, where approximately 45,000 tickets were sold. In early July, the band completed the European leg of the tour; the band extended the tour to South America in September and October 2017, but the last few shows had to be canceled due to health issues. According to Brad Whitford, the tour could end anytime from 2017 to the next four years in 2021. On 19 January 2018, Perry released a solo disc titled &quot;Sweetzerland Manifesto&quot;. He also announced that the 2017 tour titled &quot;Aero-Vederci Baby!&quot; was not really a final tour and the band will be touring in 2019 to celebrate their 50th anniversary.

===&quot;Deuces are Wild&quot; residency, &quot;Peace Out: The Farewell Tour&quot;, retirement from touring and possible new music (2019–present)===

Aerosmith appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show on August 15, 2018, to announce a residency in Las Vegas called &quot;&quot;, a reference to both Las Vegas casino gambling and their 1994 single of the same name. The band&#x27;s Las Vegas residency took place in April, June, July, and September thru December 2019. It had been scheduled to be extended into January, February, May, and June 2020 at the Park Theater, but the 2020 dates were cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the Las Vegas shows, in mid-July 2019, the band performed at a festival in Minnesota, and in August 2019, they played a total of nine shows spread across three MGM venues in Maryland, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.

In 2019, a European tour was announced, due to take place through the summer of 2020 following the completion of their Las Vegas dates. However, the shows were canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, as was a 50th Anniversary show at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park, originally planned for September 2020. The European dates were initially rescheduled for the summer of 2021 but were later moved again to summer 2022 due to the ongoing pandemic.

In January 2019, Joe Perry stated that he and Steven Tyler were due to start recording new material together for a new Aerosmith album. The next month, on February 14, 2019, Aerosmith was scheduled to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but the ceremony and installation were postponed due to inclement weather with a new date to be determined later.

In April 2019, drummer Joey Kramer suffered minor injuries to his shoulder following an unspecified accident, and was forced to stand down from several concerts of the band&#x27;s Las Vegas residency. His drum technician John Douglas substituted for him. In November of that same year, Kramer told several news sites that he was not allowed to rejoin the band despite his recovery, to which the band responded that his playing was &quot;not up to Aerosmith standards&quot;. The disagreement culminated in a series of lawsuits in January 2020, after which Kramer was expected to be barred from performing with the band at the 2020 Grammy Awards. Kramer rejoined Aerosmith in February 2020 for their Las Vegas residency.

In an August 2020 interview with former The Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman, on his radio show &quot;Steve Gorman Rocks&quot;, Brad Whitford was asked what the future of Aerosmith looked like. His response was &quot;I don&#x27;t really know what they want to do. And, I don&#x27;t really care because, um, truthfully, I&#x27;m not interested anymore&quot;, citing ongoing dysfunction within the band. He expressed similar concerns in an interview with Joe Bonamassa on his &quot;Live From Nerdville&quot; podcast in June 2021. Whitford shared his thoughts about how the COVID-19 outbreak would affect touring plans for Aerosmith, and musicians in general, while acknowledging his and his bandmate&#x27;s current ages. Stating, &quot;I mean, I have my doubts about Aerosmith ever performing again at this stage because age is becoming a real factor. It is what it is.&quot;

On August 23, 2021, Aerosmith signed a distribution deal with Universal Music Group, covering the band&#x27;s entire catalog — both Geffen (Universal&#x27;s subsidiary) and Columbia titles.

In March 2022, following the cancellation of the rescheduled European tour, Aerosmith announced that the Deuces Are Wild residency would both continue and expand, beginning in June and running through December, along with the rescheduled Fenway Park show in September. Kramer was also confirmed to be sitting out all concerts, with the band claiming that he would be focusing &quot;his full attention on his family during these uncertain times.&quot; Aerosmith announced on May 24, 2022, that the June and July dates of the Deuces Are Wild residency would be canceled as a result of Tyler checking himself into a rehab facility after he suffered a relapse following his pain management of a foot surgery. Following Tyler&#x27;s 30+ day rehab treatment, the band went on to perform at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park for their 50th anniversary show and then resumed their Las Vegas residency, scheduled September through December 2022.

In May 2023, the band announced a farewell tour called &quot;Peace Out: The Farewell Tour&quot; that would begin in September. The tour would send the band to 40 North American locations through January 2024, and would include The Black Crowes as the opening act. The tour would not include original drummer Joey Kramer. Shortly after the tour began, however, it was announced that it was being delayed until the following year due to Tyler badly injuring his vocal cords during a performance on September 9. The tour was rescheduled to begin in September 2024 and proceed through February 2025. On August 2, 2024, the tour was canceled and the band announced their immediate retirement from touring, due to Tyler being unable to recover from his vocal cord injury. Perry has stated that he does not rule out new music from Aerosmith. Tom Hamilton in an August 29, 2024 interview with AARP Magazine said &quot;The band is still alive&quot; and when asked about the future of the band he said &quot;On the hope scale, I&#x27;m somewhere between 7 and 9. We won&#x27;t be doing any tours from now on, but I&#x27;ll always have hope that other types of opportunities will come along. This isn&#x27;t the first time black clouds have been on our horizon — and somehow the sun managed to come out. Time and hope are all we have at the moment.&quot; Hamilton was asked about new music and said &quot;So far there hasn&#x27;t been any talk about a new Aerosmith album.&quot; In January 2025, bassist Tom Hamilton discussed the possibility of recording with Tyler &quot;in the future&quot;. On January 23, 2025, Aerosmith announced a reunion show with Steven Tyler as a celebration for the 67th Annual Grammy Awards and a benefit concert for fire firefighters during the January 2025 Southern California wildfires.

==Influence and legacy==

Influenced by bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin, and the New York Dolls, Aerosmith proved to be a major influence themselves on subsequently massively successful bands and musicians; according to Perry, Eddie Van Halen once told him that his band Van Halen &quot;started out on the suburban L.A. club circuit, playing Aerosmith songs&quot;. Aerosmith&#x27;s influence was evident on the next generation of hard rock and heavy metal bands, namely Mötley Crüe, Ratt, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Tesla, L.A. Guns, Cinderella, Faster Pussycat, Skid Row, Extreme, Warrant, Inglorious, the Black Crowes, and the Quireboys, as well as Metallica, Metal Church, and Testament. The BulletBoys wrote a song for their first album called &quot;Owed to Joe&quot; about Aerosmith and the debt that next generation of guitarists owed to Joe Perry. Especially, Guns N&#x27; Roses and Velvet Revolver guitarist Slash has stated that Aerosmith is his favorite band, and Mötley Crüe&#x27;s Nikki Sixx has expressed massive admiration for the band and its early records in both &quot;The Dirt&quot; and &quot;The Heroin Diaries&quot;. Members of alternative rock bands such as Nirvana, Mother Love Bone/Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, Staind and Godsmack are also self-professed early Aerosmith fans.

The interplay between Joe Perry and Brad Whitford has been inspiring to many bands, especially Guns N&#x27; Roses. Joe Perry has received wide recognition and praise as a lead guitarist, and has shared the stage many times with Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck, who Perry cites as primary influences. He and Tyler were asked by Page to induct Led Zeppelin into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; during the ceremony, which took place in 1995, Tyler and Perry delivered their speech and joined the band onstage for a brief set. During Beck&#x27;s and Metallica&#x27;s induction in 2009, they invited Perry and Page to play the Yardbirds/Zeppelin/Aerosmith classic &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;. Other collaborations, either by individual members of the band or by Aerosmith as a whole, have included Alice Cooper on his &quot;Trash&quot; album, Guns N&#x27; Roses (who opened for Aerosmith during their 1988 tour and had covered &quot;Mama Kin&quot; on their first release), and B&#x27;z. As a testimony to their importance in American popular culture as a whole, Aerosmith have also collaborated with popular non-rock artists, such as Run-DMC, Eminem (&quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;), and Carrie Underwood, and performed with &#x27;N Sync, Britney Spears, Mary J. Blige, and Nelly for the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show. Country artists Garth Brooks and Mark Chesnutt both scored hit singles with covers of Aerosmith songs; Brooks in 1995 with &quot;The Fever&quot;, a reworking of Aerosmith&#x27;s 1993 song, and Chesnutt in 1999 with a cover of Aerosmith&#x27;s 1998 song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;.

Like many of their 1970s contemporaries including Led Zeppelin and Alice Cooper, the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery. Drug consumption was rampant; the recording sessions for 1976&#x27;s &quot;Rocks&quot; and 1977&#x27;s &quot;Draw the Line&quot; were especially noted for their substance indulgence, including heroin. In the words of Bebe Buell, &quot;They [Aerosmith] were like a gang of kids with their own planes, Porsches, millions of dollars, limitless resources. [...] Mick Jagger and Jimmy Page had control, but these boys did not care. They won the prize, hands down, for the rowdiest rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band in that era. No question.&quot;

In the mid to late 1970s, the band enjoyed tremendous popularity in the United States and in Japan, though they failed to make a big impression in Britain. Still, they were among the most popular hard rock acts in America in the mid to late 1970s, along with Heart, Kiss, Ted Nugent, ZZ Top, and Boston. Their massive popularity waned, however, following Perry and Whitford&#x27;s departures. Following both guitarists&#x27; return to the band and its complete drug cleanup, Aerosmith made a prodigious return to success, once described as &quot;the single most successful comeback in the history of heavy metal, if not all of popular music.&quot; During both the 1970s and the 1987–1995 era, Aerosmith undertook grueling world tours that numbered in the triple digits numbers of dates, headlining or co-headlining festivals along the way, such as the Texxas Jam in 1978 and 1987, the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England in 1990 and 1994, and Woodstock &#x27;94.

Initially resistant to this medium, the band later became renowned and received numerous awards for pioneering expansive, conceptual music videos, such as those for &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; (directed by future &quot;Fight Club&quot; director David Fincher), &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot;, and &quot;Pink&quot;.

Aerosmith was the first band to have its band-centered &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; title, &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, which is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game across both the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; platforms.

==Awards and achievements==

Despite Aerosmith&#x27;s popularity and success in the 1970s, it wasn&#x27;t until their comeback in the late-1980s and 1990s when they started winning awards and major recognition. In 1987, Aerosmith won the Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap Single for the re-mix of &quot;Walk This Way&quot; with Run-DMC In 1990, Aerosmith won their first Grammy award, for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and went on to win a total of four such awards (all of them in the 1990s) for &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Crazy&quot;, and &quot;Pink&quot;. Aerosmith is second only to U2 in the number of awards won in that category.

In addition, Aerosmith&#x27;s music videos won numerous awards throughout the 1990s. Aerosmith ranks as the ninth most successful artist (and the third most successful group) of all-time at the MTV Video Music Awards (VMAs), with ten such awards to date. Aerosmith is also the all-time leader in the categories Best Rock Video (with four such awards) and Viewer&#x27;s Choice (with three such awards). Aerosmith has also won once each in the categories Video of the Year, Best Group Video, and Best Video from a Film. The videos for which Aerosmith has won VMAs are &quot;Janie&#x27;s Got a Gun&quot; (2 awards), &quot;The Other Side&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; on the Edge&quot;, &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot; (3 awards), &quot;Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)&quot;, &quot;Pink&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;.

Over the course of their career (primarily 1990 and after), Aerosmith has also collected six American Music Awards, four Billboard Music Awards, two People&#x27;s Choice Awards, sixteen Boston Music Awards, and numerous other awards and honors. Some of the high accolades Aerosmith have achieved include induction into Hollywood&#x27;s Rock Walk in 1990, a declaration of &quot;Aerosmith Day&quot; in the state of Massachusetts by then-Governor William Weld on April 13, 1993, induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and being honored with the mtvICON award in 2002.

In the fields of technology and video games, Aerosmith has achieved several feats. In 1994, Aerosmith released the song &quot;Head First&quot; on the CompuServe online service, which is considered to be the first full-length commercial product available online. In 2008, Aerosmith became the first artist to have an entire &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; video game based around them with &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;. &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot; is considered to be the best-selling band-centric video game across both the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot; platforms.

Aerosmith also holds several chart and album sales feats, including the second highest number of number-one singles on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for a group with nine, the only number one debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 by a rock group with &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Miss a Thing&quot;, the second most gold albums by an American group behind Kiss who has 30, the most total certifications (including gold, platinum, and multi-platinum combined) by an American group, and are tied with Van Halen for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. From the Recording Industry Association of America, Aerosmith has achieved 25 gold, 18 platinum, and 12 multi-platinum album certifications, in addition to one diamond album, four gold singles, and one platinum digital single. Media often refer to Aerosmith, who have sold more than 150 million albums worldwide and 70.2 million in the United States, as the best-selling American rock band.

Aerosmith were honored as MusiCares Person of the Year in 2020.

==Media==

In addition to recording and performing music, Aerosmith has also been involved with films, television, video games, pinball, and music videos. In 1978, the band starred as the &quot;Future Villain Band&quot; in the film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Later, when the band resurrected itself in the late 1980s and 1990s, Aerosmith made further appearances, including the &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; sketch on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1990, the &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot; episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1991, and the film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; in 1993. The band also appeared in the 2005 John Travolta/Uma Thurman comedy &quot;Be Cool&quot;, in which Steven Tyler and Thurman&#x27;s characters help bring pop music star Linda Moon (Christina Milian) into the limelight. The band also opened for the 1993 movie &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; with &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; likely added as it was a very traditional rock number from the 1970s

The band has been the subject of several video games including &quot;Revolution X&quot; in 1994, &quot;Quest for Fame&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Guitar Hero: Aerosmith&quot;, in June 2008. The band has also made over 30 major music videos, and released seven home videos or DVDs.

In 2017, Stern released three versions of an Aerosmith pinball machine, which feature original versions of nine of the band&#x27;s iconic songs, as well as Elevator and Toy-Box multiballs.

<text>Bézout&#x27;s theorem is a statement in algebraic geometry concerning the number of common zeros of polynomials in indeterminates. In its original form the theorem states that &quot;in general&quot; the number of common zeros equals the product of the degrees of the polynomials. It is named after Étienne Bézout.

In some elementary texts, Bézout&#x27;s theorem refers only to the case of two variables, and asserts that, if two plane algebraic curves of degrees formula_1 and formula_2 have no component in common, they have formula_3 intersection points, counted with their multiplicity, and including points at infinity and points with complex coordinates.

In its modern formulation, the theorem states that, if is the number of common points over an algebraically closed field of projective hypersurfaces defined by homogeneous polynomials in indeterminates, then is either infinite, or equals the product of the degrees of the polynomials. Moreover, the finite case occurs almost always.

In the case of two variables and in the case of affine hypersurfaces, if multiplicities and points at infinity are not counted, this theorem provides only an upper bound of the number of points, which is almost always reached. This bound is often referred to as the Bézout bound.

Bézout&#x27;s theorem is fundamental in computer algebra and effective algebraic geometry, by showing that most problems have a computational complexity that is at least exponential in the number of variables. It follows that in these areas, the best complexity that can be hoped for will occur with algorithms that have a complexity that is polynomial in the Bézout bound.

==History==
In the case of plane curves, Bézout&#x27;s theorem was essentially stated by Isaac Newton in his proof of Lemma 28 of volume 1 of his &quot;Principia&quot; in 1687, where he claims that two curves have a number of intersection points given by the product of their degrees. However, Newton had stated the theorem as early as 1665.

The general theorem was later published in 1779 in Étienne Bézout&#x27;s &quot;Théorie générale des équations algébriques&quot;. He supposed the equations to be &quot;complete&quot;, which in modern terminology would translate to generic. Since with generic polynomials, there are no points at infinity, and all multiplicities equal one, Bézout&#x27;s formulation is correct, although his proof does not follow the modern requirements of rigor. This and the fact that the concept of intersection multiplicity was outside the knowledge of his time led to a sentiment expressed by some authors that his proof was neither correct nor the first proof to be given.

The proof of the statement that includes multiplicities requires an accurate definition of the intersection multiplicities, and was therefore not possible before the 20th century. The definitions of multiplicities that was given during the first half of the 20th century involved continuous and infinitesimal deformations. It follows that the proofs of this period apply only over the field of complex numbers. It is only in 1958 that Jean-Pierre Serre gave a purely algebraic definition of multiplicities, which led to a proof valid over any algebraically closed field.

Modern studies related to Bézout&#x27;s theorem obtained different upper bounds to system of polynomials by using other properties of the polynomials, such as the Bernstein–Kushnirenko theorem, or generalized it to a large class of functions, such as Nash functions.

==Statement==
===Plane curves===
Suppose that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are two plane projective curves defined over a field &quot;F&quot; that do not have a common component (this condition means that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are defined by polynomials, without common divisor of positive degree). Then the total number of intersection points of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; with coordinates in an algebraically closed field &quot;E&quot; that contains &quot;F&quot;, counted with their multiplicities, is equal to the product of the degrees of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

===General case===
The generalization in higher dimension may be stated as:

Let &quot;n&quot; projective hypersurfaces be given in a projective space of dimension &quot;n&quot; over an algebraically closed field, which are defined by &quot;n&quot; homogeneous polynomials in &quot;n&quot; + 1 variables, of degrees formula_4 Then either the number of intersection points is infinite, or the number of intersection points, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product formula_5 If the hypersurfaces are in relative general position, then there are formula_6 intersection points, all with multiplicity 1.

There are various proofs of this theorem, which either are expressed in purely algebraic terms, or use the language of algebraic geometry. Three algebraic proofs are sketched below.

Bézout&#x27;s theorem has been generalized as the so-called multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem.

===Affine case===
The affine case of the theorem is the following statement, that was proven in 1983 by David Masser and Gisbert Wüstholz.

Consider affine hypersurfaces that are defined over an algebraically closed field by  polynomials in variables, of degrees formula_4 Then either the number of intersection points is infinite, or the number of intersection points, counted with their multiplicities, is at most the product formula_5 If the hypersurfaces are in relative general position, then there are exactly formula_6 intersection points, all with multiplicity 1.

This version is not a direct consequence of the general case, because it is possible to have a finite number of intersection points in the affine space, with infinitely many intersection points at infinity. The above statement is a special case of a more general statement, which is the result that Masser and Wüstholz proved. 

For stating the general result, one has to recall that the intersection points form an algebraic set, and that there is a finite number of intersection points if and only if all component of the intersection have a zero dimension (an algebraic set of positive dimension has an infinity of points over an algebraically closed field). An intersection point is said &quot;isolated&quot; if it does not belong to a component of positive dimension of the intersection; the terminology make sense, since an isolated intersection point has neighborhoods (for Zariski topology or for the usual topology in the case of complex hypersurfaces) that does not contain any other intersection point.

Consider projective hypersurfaces that are defined over an algebraically closed field by homogeneous polynomials in formula_10 variables, of degrees formula_4 Then, the sum of the multiplicities of their isolated intersection points is at most the product formula_5 The result remains valid for any number of hypersurfaces, if one sets formula_13 in the case formula_14 and, otherwise, if one orders the degrees for having formula_15 That is, there is no isolated intersection point if formula_14 and, otherwise, the bound is the product of the smallest degree and the formula_17 largest degrees.

==Examples (plane curves)==
===Two lines===
The equation of a line in a Euclidean plane is linear, that is, it equates a polynomial of degree one to zero. So, the Bézout bound for two lines is , meaning that two lines either intersect at a single point, or do not intersect. In the latter case, the lines are parallel and meet at a point at infinity.

One can verify this with equations. The equation of a first line can be written in slope-intercept form formula_18 or, in projective coordinates formula_19 (if the line is vertical, one may exchange and ). If the equation of a second line is (in projective coordinates) formula_20 by substituting formula_21 for in it, one gets formula_22 If formula_23 one gets the -coordinate of the intersection point by solving the latter equation in and putting 

If formula_24 that is formula_25 the two line are parallel as having the same slope. If formula_26 they are distinct, and the substituted equation gives . This gives the point at infinity of projective coordinates .

===A line and a curve===
As above, one may write the equation of the line in projective coordinates as formula_27 If curve is defined in projective coordinates by a homogeneous polynomial formula_28 of degree , the substitution of provides a homogeneous polynomial of degree in and . The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that it can be factored in linear factors. Each factor gives the ratio of the and coordinates of an intersection point, and the multiplicity of the factor is the multiplicity of the intersection point.

If is viewed as the &quot;coordinate of infinity&quot;, a factor equal to represents an intersection point at infinity.

If at least one partial derivative of the polynomial is not zero at an intersection point, then the tangent of the curve at this point is defined (see ), and the intersection multiplicity is greater than one if and only if the line is tangent to the curve. If all partial derivatives are zero, the intersection point is a singular point, and the intersection multiplicity is at least two.

===Two conic sections===
Two conic sections generally intersect in four points, some of which may coincide. To properly account for all intersection points, it may be necessary to allow complex coordinates and include the points on the infinite line in the projective plane. For example:
*Two circles never intersect in more than two points in the plane, while Bézout&#x27;s theorem predicts four. The discrepancy comes from the fact that every circle passes through the same two complex points on the line at infinity. Writing the circle formula_29 in homogeneous coordinates, we get formula_30 from which it is clear that the two points and lie on every circle. When two circles do not meet at all in the real plane, the two other intersections have non-real coordinates, or if the circles are concentric then they meet at exactly the two points on the line at infinity with an intersection multiplicity of two.
*Any conic should meet the line at infinity at two points according to the theorem. A hyperbola meets it at two real points corresponding to the two directions of the asymptotes. An ellipse meets it at two complex points, which are conjugate to one anotherin the case of a circle, the points and . A parabola meets it at only one point, but it is a point of tangency and therefore counts twice.
*The following pictures show examples in which the circle meets another ellipse in fewer intersection points because at least one of them has multiplicity greater than one:
==Multiplicity==

The concept of multiplicity is fundamental for Bézout&#x27;s theorem, as it allows having an equality instead of a much weaker inequality.

Intuitively, the multiplicity of a common zero of several polynomials is the number of zeros into which the common zero can split when the coefficients are slightly changed. For example, a tangent to a curve is a line that cuts the curve at a point that splits in several points if the line is slightly moved. This number is two in general (ordinary points), but may be higher (three for inflection points, four for undulation points, etc.). This number is the &quot;multiplicity of contact&quot; of the tangent.

This definition of a multiplicities by deformation was sufficient until the end of the 19th century, but has several problems that led to more convenient modern definitions: Deformations are difficult to manipulate; for example, in the case of a root of a univariate polynomial, for proving that the multiplicity obtained by deformation equals the multiplicity of the corresponding linear factor of the polynomial, one has to know that the roots are continuous functions of the coefficients. Deformations cannot be used over fields of positive characteristic. Moreover, there are cases where a convenient deformation is difficult to define (as in the case of more than two plane curves having a common intersection point), and even cases where no deformation is possible.

Currently, following Jean-Pierre Serre, a multiplicity is generally defined as the length of a local ring associated with the point where the multiplicity is considered. Most specific definitions can be shown to be special case of Serre&#x27;s definition.

In the case of Bézout&#x27;s theorem, the general intersection theory can be avoided, as there are proofs (see below) that associate to each input data for the theorem a polynomial in the coefficients of the equations, which factorizes into linear factors, each corresponding to a single intersection point. So, the multiplicity of an intersection point is the multiplicity of the corresponding factor. The proof that this multiplicity equals the one that is obtained by deformation, results then from the fact that the intersection points and the factored polynomial depend continuously on the roots.

==Proofs==
===Using the resultant (plane curves)===
Let and be two homogeneous polynomials in the indeterminates of respective degrees and . Their zeros are the homogeneous coordinates of two projective curves. Thus the homogeneous coordinates of their intersection points are the common zeros of and .

By collecting together the powers of one indeterminate, say , one gets univariate polynomials whose coefficients are homogeneous polynomials in and .

For technical reasons, one must change of coordinates in order that the degrees in of and equal their total degrees ( and ), and each line passing through two intersection points does not pass through the point (this means that no two point have the same Cartesian -coordinate.

The resultant of and with respect to is a homogeneous polynomial in and that has the following property: formula_31 with formula_32 if and only if it exist formula_33 such that formula_34 is a common zero of and (see ). The above technical condition ensures that formula_33 is unique. The first above technical condition means that the degrees used in the definition of the resultant are and ; this implies that the degree of is (see ).

As is a homogeneous polynomial in two indeterminates, the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that is a product of linear polynomials. If one defines the multiplicity of a common zero of and as the number of occurrences of the corresponding factor in the product, Bézout&#x27;s theorem is thus proved.

For proving that the intersection multiplicity that has just been defined equals the definition in terms of a deformation, it suffices to remark that the resultant and thus its linear factors are continuous functions of the coefficients of and .

Proving the equality with other definitions of intersection multiplicities relies on the technicalities of these definitions and is therefore outside the scope of this article.

===Using -resultant===

In the early 20th century, Francis Sowerby Macaulay introduced the multivariate resultant (also known as &quot;Macaulay&#x27;s resultant&quot;) of homogeneous polynomials in indeterminates, which is generalization of the usual resultant of two polynomials. Macaulay&#x27;s resultant is a polynomial function of the coefficients of homogeneous polynomials that is zero if and only the polynomials have a nontrivial (that is some component is nonzero) common zero in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients.

The -resultant is a particular instance of Macaulay&#x27;s resultant, introduced also by Macaulay. Given homogeneous polynomials formula_36 in indeterminates formula_37 the -resultant is the resultant of formula_38 and formula_39 where the coefficients formula_40 are auxiliary indeterminates. The -resultant is a homogeneous polynomial in formula_41 whose degree is the product of the degrees of the formula_42

Although a multivariate polynomial is generally irreducible, the -resultant can be factorized into linear (in the formula_43) polynomials over an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients of the formula_42 These linear factors correspond to the common zeros of the formula_45 in the following way: to each common zero formula_46 corresponds a linear factor formula_47 and conversely.

This proves Bézout&#x27;s theorem, if the multiplicity of a common zero is defined as the multiplicity of the corresponding linear factor of the -resultant. As for the preceding proof, the equality of this multiplicity with the definition by deformation results from the continuity of the -resultant as a function of the coefficients of the formula_42

This proof of Bézout&#x27;s theorem seems the oldest proof that satisfies the modern criteria of rigor.

===Using the degree of an ideal===
Bézout&#x27;s theorem can be proved by recurrence on the number of polynomials 
by using the following theorem.

&quot;Let be a projective algebraic set of dimension formula_49 and degree formula_1, and be a hypersurface (defined by a single polynomial) of degree formula_2, that does not contain any irreducible component of ; under these hypotheses, the intersection of and has dimension formula_52 and degree formula_53&quot;

For a (sketched) proof using Hilbert series, see .

Beside allowing a conceptually simple proof of Bézout&#x27;s theorem, this theorem is fundamental for intersection theory, since this theory is essentially devoted to the study of intersection multiplicities when the hypotheses of the above theorem do not apply.

<text>Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel (; February 28, 1906 – June 20, 1947) was an American mobster who was a driving force behind the development of the Las Vegas Strip. Siegel was influential within the Jewish Mob, along with his childhood friend and fellow gangster Meyer Lansky, and he also held significant influence within the Italian-American Mafia and the largely Italian-Jewish National Crime Syndicate. Described as &quot;handsome&quot; and &quot;charismatic&quot;, Siegel became one of the first front-page celebrity gangsters.

Siegel was one of the founders and leaders of Murder, Inc. and became a bootlegger during American Prohibition. The Twenty-first Amendment was passed in 1933 repealing Prohibition, and he turned to gambling. In 1936, he left New York and moved to California. His time as a mobster during this period was mainly as a hitman and muscle, as he was noted for his prowess with guns and violence. In 1941, Siegel was tried for the murder of friend and fellow mobster Harry Greenberg, who had turned informant. He was acquitted in 1942.

Siegel traveled to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he handled and financed some of the original casinos. He assisted developer William R. Wilkerson&#x27;s Flamingo Hotel after Wilkerson ran out of funds. Siegel assumed control of the project and managed the final stages of construction. The Flamingo opened on December 26, 1946 in a three day event that was well received. Without a hotel to accompany the casino, the Flamingo struggled and closed from February 6 until the hotel opened March 1, 1947. Siegel’s mob partners were convinced that an estimated US$1 million of the construction budget overrun had been skimmed by Siegel&#x27;s girlfriend Virginia Hill or by both of them. On June 20, 1947, Siegel was shot dead at the age of 41 by a sniper through the window of Hill&#x27;s Linden Drive mansion in Beverly Hills, California.

==Early life==
Benjamin Siegel was born on February 28, 1906, in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn in New York City, New York, the second of five children of a poor Ashkenazi Jewish family that had emigrated to the U.S. from the Galicia region of what was then Austria-Hungary. His parents, Jennie (Riechenthal) and Max Siegel, constantly worked for meager wages. As a boy, Siegel left school and joined a gang on Lafayette Street on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. He committed mainly thefts until he met Moe Sedway. Together with Sedway, he developed a protection racket in which he threatened to incinerate pushcart owners&#x27; merchandise unless they paid him a dollar. He soon built up a lengthy criminal record, dating from his teenage years, that included armed robbery, rape and murder.

===The Bugs and Meyer Mob===

During adolescence, Siegel befriended Meyer Lansky, who applied a brilliant intellect to forming a small mob whose activities expanded to gambling and car theft. Lansky, who had already had a run-in with Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, saw a need for the Jewish boys of his Brooklyn neighborhood to organize in the same manner as the Italians and Irish. The first person he recruited for his gang was Siegel.

Siegel became involved in bootlegging within several major East Coast cities. He also worked as the mob&#x27;s hitman, whom Lansky hired out to other crime families. The two formed the Bugs and Meyer Mob, which handled hits for the various bootleg gangs operating in New York and New Jersey, doing so almost a decade before Murder, Inc. was formed. The gang kept themselves busy by hijacking the liquor cargoes of rival outfits, and were known to be responsible for the killing and removal of several rival gangland figures. Siegel&#x27;s gang-mates included Abner &quot;Longie&quot; Zwillman, Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter, and Lansky&#x27;s brother, Jake; Joseph &quot;Doc&quot; Stacher, another member of the Bugs and Meyer Mob, recalled to Lansky biographers that Siegel was fearless and saved his friends&#x27; lives as the mob moved into bootlegging:

Siegel was also a boyhood friend to Al Capone; when there was a warrant for Capone&#x27;s arrest on a murder charge, Siegel allowed him to hide out with an aunt.

He first smoked opium during his youth and was involved in the drug trade. By age 21, he was making money, and flaunted it. He bought an apartment at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel and a Tudor home in Scarsdale, New York. He wore flashy clothes and participated in New York City night life.

From May 13 to 16, 1929, Lansky and Siegel attended the Atlantic City Conference, representing the Bugs and Meyer Mob. Luciano and former Chicago South Side Gang leader Johnny Torrio held the conference at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. At the conference, the two men discussed the future of organized crime and the future structure of the Mafia crime families; Siegel stated, &quot;The yids and the dagos will no longer fight each other.&quot;

===Marriage and family===
On January 28, 1929, Siegel married Esta Krakower, his childhood sweetheart. They had two daughters, Millicent Siegel (later Millicent Rosen) and Barbara Siegel (later Barbara Saperstein). He had a reputation as a womanizer and the marriage ended in 1946. His wife moved with their teenage daughters to New York.

==Murder, Incorporated==
By the late 1920s, Lansky and Siegel had ties to Luciano and Frank Costello, future bosses of the Genovese crime family. Siegel, Albert Anastasia, Vito Genovese, and Joe Adonis allegedly were the four gunmen who shot New York mob boss Joe Masseria to death on Luciano&#x27;s orders on April 15, 1931, ending the Castellammarese War. On September 10 of that year, Luciano hired four gunmen from the Bugs and Meyer Mob (some sources identify Siegel as being one of the gunmen) to murder Salvatore Maranzano in his New York office, establishing Luciano&#x27;s rise to the top of the Mafia and marking the beginning of modern American organized crime.
Following Maranzano&#x27;s death, Luciano and Lansky formed the National Crime Syndicate, an organization of crime families that brought power to the underworld. The Commission was established for dividing Mafia territories and preventing future gang wars. With his associates, Siegel formed Murder, Inc. After he and Lansky moved on, control over Murder, Inc. was ceded to Buchalter and Anastasia, although Siegel continued working as a hitman. Siegel&#x27;s only conviction was in Miami; on February 28, 1932, he was arrested for gambling and vagrancy, and, from a roll of bills, paid a $100 fine.

During this period, Siegel had a disagreement with the Fabrizzo brothers, associates of Waxey Gordon. Gordon had hired the Fabrizzo brothers from prison after Lansky and Siegel gave the IRS information about Gordon&#x27;s tax evasion. It led to Gordon&#x27;s imprisonment in 1933. Siegel hunted down and killed the Fabrizzos after they made an assassination attempt on Lansky and him by penetrating Siegel&#x27;s heavily fortified Waldorf Astoria suite with a bomb. After the deaths of his two brothers, Tony Fabrizzo had begun to write a memoir and gave it to an attorney. One of the longest chapters was to be a section on the nationwide kill-for-hire squad led by Siegel. However, the mob discovered Fabrizzo&#x27;s plans before he could carry them out. In 1932, after checking into a hospital to establish an alibi and later sneaking out, Siegel joined two accomplices in approaching Fabrizzo&#x27;s house and, posing as detectives to lure him outside, gunned him down. In 1935, Siegel assisted in Luciano&#x27;s alliance with Dutch Schultz and killed rival loan shark brothers Louis &quot;Pretty&quot; Amberg and Joseph C. Amberg.

==California==
Siegel had learned from his associates that he was in danger: his hospital alibi had become questionable and his enemies wanted him dead. In the late 1930s, the East Coast mob sent Siegel to California. Since 1933, he had traveled to the West Coast several times, and in California his mission was to develop syndicate-sanctioned gambling rackets with Los Angeles family boss Jack Dragna. Once in Los Angeles, Siegel recruited gang boss Mickey Cohen as his chief lieutenant. Knowing Siegel&#x27;s reputation for violence, and that he was backed by Lansky and Luciano – who, from prison, sent word to Dragna that it was &quot;in [his] best interest to cooperate&quot; – Dragna accepted a subordinate role. On tax returns, Siegel claimed to earn his living through legal gambling at Santa Anita Park. He soon took over Los Angeles&#x27;s numbers racket and used money from the syndicate to help establish a drug trade route from Mexico and organized circuits with the Chicago Outfit&#x27;s wire services.

By 1942, $500,000 a day was coming from the syndicate&#x27;s bookmaking wire operations. In 1946, because of problems with Siegel, the Outfit took over the Continental Press and gave the percentage of the racing wire to Dragna, infuriating Siegel. Despite his complications with the wire services, Siegel controlled several offshore casinos and a major prostitution ring. He also maintained relationships with politicians, businessmen, attorneys, accountants, and lobbyists who fronted for him.

===Hollywood===
In Hollywood, Siegel was welcomed in the highest circles and befriended movie stars. He was known to associate with George Raft, Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Cary Grant, as well as studio executives Louis B. Mayer and Jack L. Warner. Actress Jean Harlow was a friend of Siegel and godmother to his daughter Millicent. Siegel bought real estate and threw lavish parties at his Beverly Hills home. He gained admiration from young celebrities, including Tony Curtis, Phil Silvers, and Frank Sinatra.

Siegel had several relationships with prominent women, including socialite Countess Dorothy di Frasso. The alliance with the countess took Siegel to Italy in 1938, where he met Benito Mussolini, to whom Siegel tried to sell weapons. Siegel also met Nazi leaders Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels, to whom he took an instant dislike and later offered to kill. He only relented because of the countess&#x27;s anxious pleas.

In Hollywood, Siegel worked with the syndicate to form illegal rackets. He devised a plan of extorting movie studios; he would take over local trade unions (such as the Screen Extras Guild and the Los Angeles Teamsters) and stage strikes to force studios to pay him off so that unions would start working again. Siegel borrowed money from celebrities and did not pay them back, knowing that they would never ask him for the money. During his first year in Hollywood, he received more than $400,000 in loans from movie stars.

===Selling Atomite to Mussolini===
Atomite, according to Siegel&#x27;s accounts, was a new type of explosive substance that detonated without sound or flash, and Siegel attracted the interest of Benito Mussolini and the Axis powers to purchase it. Mussolini advanced $40,000 to have atomite scaled up, but Siegel failed to detonate the explosive in 1939 during a demonstration to Mussolini and Nazi leaders, including Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring, and Mussolini demanded the return of his money.

===Greenberg murder and trial===
On November 22, 1939, Siegel, Whitey Krakow, Frankie Carbo, and Albert Tannenbaum killed Harry &quot;Big Greenie&quot; Greenberg outside his Hollywood Hills apartment. Greenberg had threatened to become a police informant, and Buchalter ordered his killing. Tannenbaum confessed to the murder and agreed to testify against Siegel. Siegel was implicated in the murder and put on trial in September 1941. The trial soon gained notoriety because of the preferential treatment that Siegel received in jail: he refused to eat prison food, was allowed female visitors, and was granted leave for dental visits. However, Siegel himself protested loudly about &quot;the stories of his privileged incarceration&quot; and behaviour during the trial, claiming that they were either untrue or grossly exaggerated. Some reporters wrote that he had a valet in prison, that he had broken down in tears on the stand, and that his eyes were brown. Siegel told them: &quot;You can see for yourself that they&#x27;re not brown&quot; (they were in fact blue).

During the trial, the newspapers also revealed information about Siegel&#x27;s past, and referred to him as &quot;Bugsy&quot;. Siegel hated the nickname because it was based on the slang term &quot;bugs&quot;, meaning &quot;crazy&quot;, and used to describe his erratic behavior. He preferred to be called &quot;Ben&quot; or &quot;Mr. Siegel&quot;. Siegel allegedly threatened Hollywood reporter Florabel Muir, &quot;who knew [him] well&quot; and was covering the trial, saying &quot;You think because I&#x27;m locked up here a punk like you can write anything you please ... Maybe you won&#x27;t be using that typewriter anymore. Maybe your fingers won&#x27;t be on your hands. I have people outside who&#x27;ll break your legs or drop you in a hole if I say the word.&quot; ... I&#x27;m not as bugs as you think. I&#x27;m going to beat this rap and then I won&#x27;t ever have to speak to you newspaper punks.&quot;

Siegel hired attorney Jerry Giesler for his defense. Two state witnesses died and no additional witnesses came forward. Tannenbaum&#x27;s testimony was dismissed. In 1942, Siegel was acquitted due to a lack of evidence, but his reputation was damaged. On May 25, 1944, Siegel was arrested for bookmaking. Raft and Mack Gray testified on his behalf, and he was acquitted again in late 1944.

==Las Vegas==

Problems with the Outfit&#x27;s wire service had cleared up in Nevada and Arizona, but in California, Siegel refused to report business. He later announced to his colleagues that he was running the California syndicate by himself and that he would return the loans in his &quot;own good time.&quot; The mob bosses were patient with him because he had proven to be a valuable man.

===Flamingo Hotel===
In 1946, Siegel found an opportunity to reinvent his personal image and diversify into legitimate business with William R. Wilkerson&#x27;s Flamingo Hotel. In the 1930s, Siegel had traveled to southern Nevada with Sedway to explore expanding operations there. He had found opportunities in providing illicit services to crews constructing the Boulder Dam. Lansky had handed over operations in Nevada to Siegel, who turned it over to Sedway and left for Hollywood.

In the mid-1940s, Siegel was operating in Las Vegas while his lieutenants worked on a business policy to secure all gambling in Los Angeles. In May 1946, he decided that the agreement with Wilkerson had to be altered to give him control of the Flamingo. Within the Flamingo, Siegel would supply the gambling, the best liquor and food, and the biggest entertainers at reasonable prices. He believed that these attractions would lure thousands of vacationers willing to gamble $50 or $100, as well as &quot;high rollers&quot;. Wilkerson was eventually coerced into selling all stakes in the Flamingo under the threat of death, and he went into hiding in Paris for a time. From this point the Flamingo became syndicate-run. By October 1946, the Flamingo&#x27;s costs were above $4 million. By 1947, the costs were over $6 M (equivalent to $ M in ). By late November of that year, the work was nearly finished.

According to later reports by local observers, Siegel&#x27;s &quot;maniacal chest-puffing&quot; set the pattern for several generations of notable casino moguls. He boasted one day that he had personally killed some men; he saw the panicked look on the face of head contractor Del Webb and reassured him, &quot;Del, don&#x27;t worry, we only kill each other.&quot; Other associates portrayed Siegel in a different aspect; he was an intense character who was not without a charitable side, including his donations for the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund. Siegel&#x27;s Las Vegas attorney Lou Weiner Jr. described him as &quot;very well liked&quot; and said that he was &quot;good to people.&quot;

====Opening====
The Flamingo opened on December 26, 1946, despite being unfinished. Local people attended the opening, and some celebrities present included George Raft, June Haver, Vivian Blaine, Sonny Tufts, Brian Donlevy, and Charles Coburn. They were welcomed by construction noise and a lobby draped with drop cloths. When word made its way to Siegel during the evening that the casino was losing money, he became irate and verbally abusive and threw out at least one family. 

After two weeks, the Flamingo&#x27;s gaming tables were $275,000 in the red and the casino briefly shut down. Siegel continued construction and hired Hank Greenspun as a publicist. The Flamingo reopened on March 1, 1947, and began turning a profit. However, by this point mob bosses had lost their patience for Siegel.

==Death==
On the night of June 20, 1947, Siegel sat on a sofa reading a copy of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, together with his associate Allen Smiley, in the living room of 810 North Linden Drive, the Beverly Hills mansion that he had leased for his girlfriend Virginia Hill. Also present in the residence were Virginia&#x27;s brother, Chick Hill, Hill&#x27;s girlfriend, Jerry Mason, and Eung S. Lee, the residence&#x27;s cook. A little before 11:00 p.m., an unknown assailant fired into the living room through a window with a .30 caliber military M1 carbine at a range of &quot;just fourteen feet&quot; from &quot;an archway in the driveway of the house at 808 Linden&quot;, resting his weapon &quot;on a trellis just outside the window.&quot; The assailant could not be seen from the street due to &quot;an abundance of shrubbery&quot;. A total of nine rounds were fired, &quot;four of which found their mark. One hit the bridge of [Siegel]&#x27;s nose and ripped out his left eye, a second entered his right cheek and exited at the back of his neck, and two hit him in the chest.&quot; According to Florabel Muir, who was &quot;one of the first reporters on the scene&quot;, and who had spoken to Siegel earlier that day (he had called &quot;to thank her for a favourable review of a Flamingo show&quot;), the remaining shots &quot;destroyed a white marble statue of Bacchus on a grand piano, and then lodged in the far wall.&quot; Muir also claimed that she noticed Siegel&#x27;s left eyeball lying on the ground, and &quot;picked up the sliver of flesh from which his long eyelashes extended.&quot; Smiley&#x27;s arm had been grazed by a bullet, but he was otherwise unharmed. &quot;Clark Fogg, who for many years was the senior forensic specialist in the Beverly Hills Police Department Lab, concluded that it was more likely that there were two shooters&quot;, claiming that &quot;&quot;it would have been nearly impossible for just one gunman&quot; to make such precise shots to Siegel&#x27;s face because &quot;the mobster&#x27;s head would have turned upon impact from the first bullet.&quot;&quot; No one was ever charged with killing Siegel, and the crime remains officially unsolved. 

One theory is that Siegel&#x27;s death was due to his excessive spending and possible theft of money from the mob. In 1946, a meeting was held with the &quot;board of directors&quot; of the syndicate in Havana, Cuba so that Luciano, exiled in Sicily, could attend. A contract on Siegel&#x27;s life was the conclusion. According to Stacher, Lansky reluctantly agreed to the decision. Another theory is that Siegel was shot to death preemptively by Mathew &quot;Moose&quot; Pandza, the lover of Sedway&#x27;s wife Bee, who went to Pandza after learning that Siegel was threatening to kill her husband. Siegel apparently had grown increasingly resentful of the control Sedway, at mob behest, was exerting over his finances and planned to do away with him. Former Philadelphia family boss Ralph Natale claimed that Carbo was responsible for killing Siegel, at the behest of Lansky.

Siegel&#x27;s death certificate states the cause of death as homicide and the immediate cause as &quot;Cerebral due to Gunshot Wounds of the Head.&quot; 

The day after Siegel&#x27;s death, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; carried a photograph on its front page from the morgue of Siegel&#x27;s bare right foot with a toe tag. Although Siegel&#x27;s homicide occurred in Beverly Hills, his death thrust Las Vegas into the national spotlight as photographs of his lifeless body were published in newspapers throughout the country. The day after Siegel&#x27;s murder, David Berman and his Las Vegas mob associates, Sedway and Gus Greenbaum, walked into the Flamingo and took over operation of the hotel and casino.

===Memorial===

In the Bialystoker Synagogue on New York&#x27;s Lower East Side, Siegel is memorialized by a Yahrtzeit (remembrance) plaque that marks his death date so mourners can say Kaddish for the anniversary. Siegel&#x27;s plaque is below that of Max Siegel, his father, who died just two months before his son. On the property at the Flamingo Las Vegas, between the pool and a wedding chapel, is a memorial plaque to Siegel.

<doc id="149222" wikidata="Q64407093" url="?curid=149222" title="Bobbin lace">
<text>Bobbin lace is a lace textile made by braiding and twisting lengths of thread, which are wound on bobbins to manage them. As the work progresses, the weaving is held in place with pins set in a lace pillow, the placement of the pins usually determined by a pattern or pricking pinned on the pillow.

Bobbin lace is also known as pillow lace, because it was worked on a pillow, and bone lace, because early bobbins were made of bone or ivory.

Bobbin lace is one of the two major categories of handmade laces, the other being needle lace, derived from earlier cutwork and reticella.

==Origin==


A will of 1493 by the Milanese Sforza family mentions lace created with twelve bobbins. There are two books that represent the early known pattern descriptions for bobbin lace, &quot;Le Pompe&quot; from Venice and &quot;Nüw Modelbuch&quot; from Zürich. Other popular lace pattern books were produced by Isabella Parasole, which included patterns for reticella, needle lace and bobbin lace designs. Other pattern books of this period include Cesare Vecellio and Bartolomeo Danieli.

Bobbin lace evolved from passementerie or braid-making in 16th-century Italy. Genoa was famous for its braids, hence it is not surprising to find bobbin lace developed in the city. It traveled along with the Spanish troops through Europe. Coarse &quot;passements&quot; of gold and silver-wrapped threads or colored silks gradually became finer, and later bleached linen yarn was used to make both braids and edgings.

The making of bobbin lace was easier to learn than the elaborate cutwork of the 16th century, and the tools and materials for making linen bobbin lace were inexpensive. There was a ready market for bobbin lace of all qualities, and women throughout Europe soon took up the craft which earned a better income than spinning, sewing, weaving or other home-based textile arts. Bobbin lace-making was established in charity schools, almshouses, and convents.

In the 17th century, the textile centers of Flanders and Normandy eclipsed Italy as the premiere sources for fine bobbin lace, but until the Industrial Revolution and the coming of mechanization hand-lacemaking continued to be practiced throughout Europe, suffering only in those periods of simplicity when lace itself fell out of fashion.

Some skilled lace makers work to re-create older lace patterns based on the period portraiture and extant lace samples. On paintings that have sufficient detail, entire pieces can be reconstructed by lacemakers who understand the early structural techniques and details.

==Materials== 
Bobbin lace may be made with coarse or fine threads. Traditionally it was made with linen, silk, wool, or, later, cotton threads, or with precious metals. Bess of Hardwick bought red silk, gold, and silver thread for making &quot;bone lace&quot; in 1549, the earliest English reference to this kind of work. Today bobbin lace is made with a variety of natural and synthetic fibers and with wire and other filaments. Even bobbin lace made from human hair, , was once popular as a personal memento.

==Structure==
Elements of bobbin lace may include toile or &quot;toilé&quot; (clothwork), &quot;réseau&quot; (the net-like ground of continuous lace), fillings of part laces, tapes, gimp, picots, tallies, ribs and rolls. Not all styles of bobbin lace include all these elements.

==Traditional types==
Many styles of lace were made in the heyday of lacemaking (approximately the 16th–18th centuries) before machine-made lace became available.
* Classification of traditional styles by technique
** Continuous bobbin lace also known as: straight lace or fil continu.
*** Mesh grounded lace has motifs connected with ground
**** too many types to repeat here
*** Guipure lace has motifs connected with plaits
**** Bedfordshire lace (Beds) – this has flowing lines and picots (to foil the lace machines)
**** Cluny lace – has radiating long, thin leaves, called wheatears
**** Maltese lace – often has the 8 pointed Maltese cross as part of the pattern 
**** Yak lace – made of wool
**** Cantu Lace—also called Venetian Pointe lace
**** Genoese lace – usually a geometric design
** Part lace
*** Honiton lace – very fine English lace with many flowers
*** Rosaline Perlée – a mixed lace, but mainly bobbin lace 
*** Bruges lace – assembled from leaves scrolls and open flowers
*** Brussels lace – Point d&#x27;Angleterre, Point plat appliqué, Point Duchesse
** Bobbin tape lace sometimes categorized as part lace (not to be confused with tape lace which uses prefabricated tapes)
*** Russian lace
*** Idrija lace
*** Schneeberg lace – since about 1910 
*** Milanese lace
*** Hinojosa lace
*** Peasant lace
==Contemporary laces==
The advent of machine-made lace at first pushed lace-makers into more complicated designs beyond the capabilities of early machines, then simpler designs so they could compete on price, and finally pushed them out of business almost entirely.

The resurgence of lace-making is a recent phenomenon and is mostly done as a hobby. Lacemaking groups still meet in regions as varied as Devonshire, England and Orange County, California. In the European towns where lace was once a major industry or popular artisanry, especially in Belgium, England, Spain (Camariñas and Almagro), Portugal (Azores, Caminha, Lagos, Nisa, Olhão, Peniche, Póvoa de Varzim, Sesimbra, Setúbal, Silves, Viana do Castelo, Vila do Conde and Viseu (Farminhão), being known as &quot;Renda de Bilros&quot;), France and Slovenia lacemakers still demonstrate the craft and sell their wares, though their customer base has shifted from the wealthy nobility to the curious tourist.

Still new types of lace are being developed such as the 3D Rosalibre and a colored version of Milanese lace by borrowing rolls from Duchesse lace to store various shades and colors. Other artists are giving grounds a major role by distorting and varying stitches, pin distances and thread sizes or colours. The variations are explored by experimentation and mathematics and algorithms. The lace maintaining its shape without stiffening is no longer a requirement. Inspiring journals, guilds and foundations show that old techniques with a new twist can challenge young people to create works that can definitely classify as art.

A Dutch design graduate in 2006 discovered bobbin lace was a technique to make a fancy fence. The first fences became museum pieces. The fences are now produced in Bangalore by concrete rebar plaiters.

==Tools==

The major tools to make bobbin lace are a pillow, bobbins, pins and prickings. The part laces also require a crochet hook, very fine types of lace require very fine hooks. There are different types of pillows and bobbins linked to areas, eras and type of lace.

===Bobbins===
Bobbins, which are traditionally made of wood or bone, are used to hold the thread. They come in different shapes, often associated with certain types of lace. The parts of a bobbin are the neck, which is where the thread is wound, a head, where thread is hitched to keep it from coming unwound, and the shank, which is used as a handle. Bobbins from England may also have a beaded spangle at the end of the shank, which makes the bobbin heavier and helps with tensioning the thread. Bobbins are usually 3 1/2 - 4 inches long, though they may be shorter or longer. Bobbins are wound and used in pairs. Bobbin collection is a common aspect of the hobby for many lace makers. Within the lace community, commemorative bobbins designating annual meetings, special anniversaries, or historic events are frequently offered which become collector&#x27;s items.

There are many types of bobbins, including:
* Belgian bobbins: They have a single head and a bulbous rounding near the end of the shank that helps with tensioning threads.
* Binche bobbins: The round bulb near the end of the shank is small, making these bobbins good for fine, straight laces.
* East Midlands bobbins: These double-headed bobbins are slender and spangled. They are also called Bucks or Midlands bobbins.
* Honiton bobbins: Honiton bobbins are straight below the single head, and the end of the shank comes to a blunt point, which helps with sewing. They may be called a lace stick.
* Square bobbins: Square bobbins have a shank with flattened sides, which makes it easier to keep them from rolling on the pillow.
* Portuguese bobbins: The bobbin is an elongated pear-shaped wooden artefact where the thread is wrapped.
* Bone bobbins are sometimes decorated with names, commemorative text, or other messages and patterns


===Types of pillow===

The pillows must be firm, or otherwise the pins will wobble. The pillows were traditionally stuffed with straw, but nowadays polystyrene (styrofoam) is generally used. Pillows were historically characteristic of the different regions where lace was made, but contemporary lacemakers may have multiples styles of pillows to accomplish different lace styles and projects.

An early type of pillow can be seen in The Lace Maker by Caspar Netscher. The pillow has a wooden frame, and is slightly sloping. The lace-maker rests it on her lap. Another representation of the similar style of pillow is found in the painting The Lacemaker by Johannes Vermeer. The Lace-Maker portrait by Gabriël Metsu was memorialized in a postage stamp.
The bolster or cylindrical pillow was much cheaper to make as it is just a fabric bag stuffed with straw. It was used in Bedfordshire lace. It needs a stand as it does not have a flat bottom. Usually the bolster had the pattern pinned round the cylinder, so by turning the pillow, the lace could be as long as was needed. However, Maltese lacemakers used the pillow the other way. They had a long thin pillow, which they rested against something. Then they worked the lace down the length of the pillow.

This problem (of the lace needing to be longer than the pillow) is solved in a different way by the roller pillow, which has a small roller, for working the lace, set into a larger area, where the bobbins are laid. This means that the pattern can be pinned round the roller, but the pillow has a flat bottom.

The cheapest modern pillow is domed and made of polystyrene (styrofoam). It is often called a cookie pillow, because of its shape. Another modern pillow is a block pillow, with a frame which holds covered polystyrene blocks. The blocks can be moved around as the lace progresses, to keep the lace being worked on at the centre of the pillow.

==Lacemaking organizations==
Lacemaking is considered a folk art with technique and materials varying widely across the globe. Most lacemakers belong to regional guilds within their country of origin. Guilds can be devoted to one kind of lace, often that which developed locally, or may include makers of all kinds. In the United States, most guilds are organized within chapters of the International Organization of Lace, which also includes Canadian lace guilds. Quarterly publications of &quot;The Bulletin&quot; journal provide articles about current projects and events, historical research, annual meeting details, patterns, and more. Internationally, the &quot;Organisation Internationale de la Dentelle au Fuseau et à l&#x27;Aiguille&quot; (OIDFA, International Bobbin and Needle Lace Organization) is the primary governing and networking body for lacemakers. OIDFA organizes annual global congresses, regional fairs, and local gatherings to promote the appreciation and knowledge of lacemaking.
