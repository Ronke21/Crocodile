<text>Consecration is the transfer of a person or a thing to the sacred sphere for a special purpose or service. The word &quot;consecration&quot; literally means &quot;association with the sacred&quot;. Persons, places, or things can be consecrated, and the term is used in various ways by different groups. The origin of the word comes from the Latin stem &quot;consecrat&quot;, which means dedicated, devoted, and sacred. A synonym for consecration is sanctification; its antonym is desecration.

== Christianity ==

In Christianity, consecration means &quot;setting apart&quot; a person, as well as a building or object, for God. Among some Christian denominations there is a complementary service of &quot;deconsecration&quot;, to remove a consecrated place of its sacred character in preparation for either demolition or sale for secular use.

=== Catholic Church ===
&quot;Consecration&quot; is used in the Catholic Church as the setting apart for the service of God, of both persons and objects.

==== Ordination of bishops ====
The Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy of the Second Vatican Council &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot; n. 76 states,

The English text of Catechism of the Catholic Church, Second Edition, 1997, under the heading &quot;Episcopal ordination—fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders&quot;, uses &quot;episcopal consecration&quot; and &quot;episcopal ordination&quot; interchangeably (CCC, 1556–1558).

The 1983 Code of Canon Law of the Latin Church states in §§ 1012, 1014: &quot;sacrae ordinationis minister est Episcopus consecratus&quot; and uses the term &quot;consecratione episcopali&quot; (&quot;episcopal consecration&quot;).

==== Consecrated life ====

Consecrated virgins are consecrated by the diocesan bishop according to the approved liturgical rite and spend their time in works of penance and mercy, in apostolic activity and in prayer.

Those who enter religious institutes, societies of apostolic life, secular institutes or are recognised as a diocesan hermit are also members of the consecrated life.

==== Churches, altars, and other ritual objects ====
Chrism, an anointing oil, is (usually scented) olive oil consecrated by a bishop.

Objects such as patens and chalices, used for the sacrament of the Eucharist, are consecrated by a bishop, using chrism. The day before a new priest is ordained, there may be a vigil and a service or Mass at which the ordaining Bishop consecrates the paten(s) and chalice(s) of the ordinands (the men who are transitional deacons, about to be ordained priests).

A more solemn rite exists for what used to be called the &quot;consecration of an altar&quot;, either of the altar alone or as the central part of the rite for a church. The rite is now called the dedication. Since it would be contradictory to dedicate to the service of God a mortgage-burdened building, the rite of solemn dedication of a church is carried out only if the building is debt-free.

==== Eucharist ====

A very special act of consecration is that of the Eucharistic gifts bread and wine in the Holy Mass, which according to Catholic belief involves their change into the Body and Blood of Christ, a change referred to as transubstantiation.

=== Eastern churches ===

In the Eastern Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches, the term &quot;consecration&quot; can refer to either the Sacred Mystery (sacrament) of &quot;Cheirotonea&quot; (ordination through laying on of hands) of a bishop, or the sanctification and solemn dedication of a church building. It can also (more rarely) be used to describe the change of the bread and wine into the Body and Blood of Christ at the Divine Liturgy. The Chrism used at Chrismation and the Antimension placed on the Holy Table are also said to be consecrated.

=== Lutheran Church and Anglican Communion ===

Church buildings, chapels, altars, and Communion vessels are consecrated for the purpose of religious worship.

A person may be consecrated for a specific role within a religious hierarchy, or a person may consecrate his or her life in an act of devotion. In particular, the ordination of a bishop is often called a consecration. In churches that follow the doctrine of apostolic succession (the historical episcopate), the bishops who consecrate a new bishop are known as the consecrators and form an unbroken line of succession back to the Apostles. Those who take the vows of religious life are said to be living a &quot;consecrated life&quot;.

In the Church of England (Mother Church of the Anglican Communion), an order closing a church may remove the legal effects of consecration.

=== Methodist Churches ===
==== Entire consecration ====
In Methodist theology, entire consecration is an act made by an individual who has experienced the New Birth, but prior to entire sanctification:

In a prayer of entire consecration, a Christian surrenders himself/herself to God in order to allow Him to entirely sanctify his/her soul. A believer offers to God &quot;his time, his plans, his possessions, himself, his all&quot; in consecration. As such, consecration is &quot;a pledge of an eternal &#x27;yes&#x27; to all the will of God&quot; in Wesleyan-Arminian theology. With this human initiative of setting oneself apart for God, the believer is able to be entirely sanctified; the theology behind consecration is summarized with the maxim &quot;Give yourself to God in all things, if you would have God give Himself to you.&quot; United Methodist elder Craig Adams in discussing &quot;the need for a particular moment of consecration and faith in a believer&#x27;s life&quot;, referenced the theological tract &quot;On the Act or Covenant of Religious Consecration&quot;, authored by Thomas Cogswell Upham, which provides the following prayer of consecration composed by cleric Philip Doddridge as an example:
The &quot;Probationer&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, one of the most widely used catechisms of the Methodist Episcopal Church for probationers seeking full membership in the connexion, provided probationers a prayer of entire consecration to be used if the probationer had not already consecrated himself/herself to God; it implored the probationer: &quot;If you are
not fully consecrated to God, lay all on the altar immediately.&quot;

==== Liturgies ====
The Methodist &quot;Book of Worship for Church and Home&quot; (1965) contains liturgies for &quot;The Order for the Consecration of Bishops&quot;, &quot;An Office for the Consecration of Deaconesses&quot;, &quot;An Office for the Consecration of Directors of Christian Education and Directors of Music&quot;, as well as &quot;An Office for the Opening or Consecrating of a Church Building&quot; among others.

=== Pentecostal Churches===
Churches of the Holiness Pentecostal tradition, such as the Apostolic Faith Church, teach, as with Methodism, the necessity of entire consecration prior to entire sanctification—the definite, second work of grace. Holiness Pentecostalism teaches that another deeper consecration must be made prior to receiving Spirit baptism evidenced by speaking in tongues—the third work of grace.

== Mormonism ==

Mormonism is replete with consecration doctrine, primarily Christ&#x27;s title of &quot;The Anointed One&quot; signifying his official, authorized and unique role as the savior of mankind from sin and death, and secondarily each individual&#x27;s opportunity and ultimate responsibility to accept Jesus&#x27; will for their life and consecrate themselves to living thereby wholeheartedly. Book of Mormon examples include &quot;sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God&quot; (Heleman 3:35) and &quot;come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption, ... and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved&quot; (Omni 1:26).

<doc id="1185903" wikidata="Q610534" url="?curid=1185903" title="Jim Pankiw">
<text>James K. Pankiw (born August 7, 1966) is a Canadian politician and former Member of Parliament.

Pankiw served two terms in the House of Commons of Canada, representing Saskatoon—Humboldt in Saskatchewan from 1997 until 2004 as a member of the Reform Party of Canada, the Canadian Alliance, the Democratic Representative Caucus and finally as an independent MP. He is the founder and was the only leader of the Canada Party before its dissolution.

==Early life==
Pankiw was raised by his father, George, in Unity, Saskatchewan. His mother died when he was young. After training as a chiropractor, Pankiw was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1997 federal election as a member of the Reform Party. He won a plurality of 220 votes over runner-up Dennis Gruending of the New Democratic Party.

==Political career==
===Controversy===
In 2000, Pankiw wrote a letter to the president of the University of Saskatchewan, Peter MacKinnon, condemning the university&#x27;s affirmative action policies and comparing its supporters to those of the Ku Klux Klan. The letter led to a heated debate between Pankiw and Saskatchewan Liberal cabinet minister Jack Hillson on the university campus.

At the time of the 2000 election, Pankiw was a member of Reform&#x27;s successor, the Canadian Alliance. He ran into opposition during his on-campus debate with the Liberal candidate, former MP Morris Bodnar. Owing to strong support from the rural areas of the constituency, Pankiw won re-election with a plurality of 6,360 votes.

===Expulsion===
Pankiw joined with a small group of Alliance MPs informally led by Chuck Strahl that called for the resignation of party leader Stockwell Day. As a result, Pankiw was suspended and eventually expelled from the Alliance caucus and party. After joining with other expellees to form the Democratic Representative Caucus (DRC), Pankiw sat with other DRC members in the Progressive Conservative–DRC coalition.

The election of Stephen Harper as leader of the Alliance resulted in the dissolution of the PC–DRC coalition and in most of the DRC members returning to the Alliance fold. Pankiw also applied for re-admission. However, by this time he was involved in another controversy, after an Aboriginal lawyer alleged that an inebriated Pankiw had made lewd gestures to him in a Saskatoon bar, and challenged him to a fight. For this reason, he was denied re-admission to the Alliance and became an independent MP. He was refused membership in the merged Conservative Party of Canada for the same reason.

===Mayoralty election===
In the 2003 Saskatoon mayoral election, Pankiw ran against the unpopular incumbent Jim Maddin. Those opposed to him raised billboards reading &quot;Racism-Free Zone — No Pankiw, Thank You&quot;. In response, Pankiw distributed flyers claiming that it was his opponents who were racist. The revelation that Pankiw had recently purchased a home outside the Saskatoon city limits also attracted criticism since his mayoral application said he resided in the Forest Grove neighbourhood in northeast Saskatoon.

Pankiw finished ahead of Maddin in third place, behind runner-up Peter Zakreski. Don Atchison was elected mayor. Voter turnout exceeded 50 percent, a level almost unheard of in a Canadian municipal election.

===Re-election and return campaigns===
Pankiw sought re-election in the 2004 federal election, against Conservative candidate Brad Trost, Liberal Patrick Wolfe, and New Democrat Nettie Wiebe. He received 7,076 votes, achieving fourth place, 2,368 votes behind the winner, Trost.

Pankiw was defeated again in the 2006 federal election in the Battlefords—Lloydminster constituency by Conservative Gerry Ritz. Ritz had represented Battlefords—Lloydminster since the 1997 election, which he won after defeating Pankiw&#x27;s father George in a heated contest for the Reform Party nomination.

On February 4, 2010, Pankiw announced that he would again run as an independent candidate in the 2011 federal election, in his old riding of Saskatoon—Humboldt. In the press conference in which he announced his candidacy, Pankiw informed the news reporters that he had invited that he did not need the media to win, saying he&#x27;d only invited them to &quot;rub it in your face&quot;. One reporter, concerned about Pankiw&#x27;s demeanor, asked him if he was sober. Pankiw refused to answer, calling the question &quot;extraneous&quot;. Pankiw finished last in a field of five candidates, receiving only 679 votes, compared to 19,930 votes for the winning incumbent Trost.

In the 2015 federal election, Pankiw ran as a candidate in the recreated Saskatoon West riding for the Canada Party which he had created. He finished fifth in a field of six candidates; NDP candidate Sheri Benson won the seat.

==Personal and legal troubles==
In October 2011, Pankiw was charged with impaired driving from an incident occurring on July 26, 2011. His lawyer entered a plea of not guilty to the charge on May 16, 2012. In 2014 he was found guilty, fined $1000 and banned from driving for one year. On May 3, 2016, a unanimous Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan reversed the impaired driving conviction of Pankiw and entered a judicial stay of proceedings.

On three occasions, Pankiw was found guilty of professional misconduct by the Chiropractor&#x27;s Association of Saskatchewan, the professional organization of his profession. The convictions leads to fines and temporary suspensions, which Pankiw appealed through the court system. He appealed the convictions all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that he had been misled into delaying his appeal beyond the 30-day limit. However, the high court refused to hear the appeal. Pankiw&#x27;s appeal of the sentence was dismissed by the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench in January 2014.

In February 2020, Pankiw was charged with causing a drunken disturbance. After returning to Canada on a flight from the Dominican Republic, he deboarded the plane during a layover and ran onto the tarmac, jumped a razor-wire fence, and was found at a nearby museum. When a flight attendant attempted to intervene, he said, “You get your hands off me. You can’t touch me. That’s assault. Call 9-1-1.”

<doc id="1185905" wikidata="Q456806" url="?curid=1185905" title="Arnold of Brescia">
<text>Arnold of Brescia ( 1090 – June 1155), also known as Arnaldus (), was an Italian canon regular from Lombardy, who called on the Church to renounce property-ownership and participated in the failed Commune of Rome of 1144–1193.

Exiled at least three times and eventually arrested, Arnold was hanged by the papacy; his remains were burned posthumously and the ashes thrown into the River Tiber. Though he failed as a religious reformer and a political leader, his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency after his death among &quot;Arnoldists&quot; and more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans, though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. Protestants rank him among the precursors of the Reformation.

== Biography ==
Born in Brescia, Arnold became an Augustinian canon and then prior of a monastery in Brescia. He criticized the Catholic Church&#x27;s temporal powers that involved it in a land struggle in Brescia against the Count-Bishop of Brescia. He called on the Church to renounce its claim and return ownership to the city government so as not to be tainted by possession—renunciation of worldliness being one of his primary teachings. He was condemned at the Second Lateran Council in 1139 and banished from Italy.

According to the chronicler Otto of Freising, Arnold had studied in Paris under the tutelage of the reformer and philosopher Pierre Abélard. He approved of Abélard&#x27;s proposals for monastic reform. He was also influenced by the French reformer Henry of Lausanne. He agreed with the several issues they preached, including the issues of Infant Baptism, and the great wealth of the Roman Church among other things.&quot;. The issue came before the Synod of Sens in 1141 and both Arnold and Abélard&#x27;s positions were overruled by Bernard of Clairvaux. Arnold stood alone against the church&#x27;s decision after Abélard&#x27;s capitulation; he returned to Paris, where he continued to teach and preach against Bernard. As a consequence he was then commanded to silence and exiled by Pope Innocent II. He took refuge first in Zürich and then probably in Bavaria. His writings were also ordered burned as a further measure, though that judgement is the only evidence that he had actually written anything. Arnold continued to preach his radical ideas concerning apostolic poverty.
Arnold, who is known only from the vituperative condemnation of his foes, was declared to be a demagogue; his motives were impugned.

Having returned to Italy after 1143, in 1145 Arnold made his peace with Pope Eugene III, who ordered him to submit himself to the mercy of the Church in Rome. When he arrived, he found that Giordano Pierleoni&#x27;s followers had asserted the ancient rights of the commune of Rome, taken control of the city from papal forces, and founded a republic, the Commune of Rome. Arnold sided with the people immediately and, after Pierleoni&#x27;s deposition, soon became the intellectual leader of the Commune, calling for freedoms and democratic rights. Arnold taught that clergy who owned property had no power to perform the Sacraments. He succeeded in driving Pope Eugene into exile in 1146, for which he was excommunicated on 15 July 1148. When Pope Eugene returned to the city in 1148, Arnold continued to lead the blossoming republic despite his excommunication. In summing up these events, Caesar Baronius called Arnold &quot;the father of political heresies&quot;, while Edward Gibbon later expressed his view that &quot;the trumpet of Roman liberty was first sounded by Arnold.&quot;

After Pope Eugene&#x27;s death, Pope Adrian IV swiftly took steps to regain control of Rome. He allied with Frederick Barbarossa, who took Rome by force in 1155 after a Holy Week interdict and forced Arnold again into exile. Arnold was seized by Imperial forces and tried by the Roman Curia as a rebel. Importantly, he was never accused of heresy. Faced with the stake, he refused to recant any of his positions. Convicted of rebellion, Arnold was hanged in June and his body burnt. Because he remained a hero to large sections of the Roman people and the minor clergy, his ashes were cast into the Tiber, to prevent his burial place becoming venerated as the shrine of a martyr.

In 1882, after the collapse of Papal temporal powers, the city of Brescia erected a monument to its native son.

== Beliefs ==
Arnold attacked the powers of the Roman Church, and he had a radical zeal to have moral reform in the clergy. Arnold rejected a theocratical state and instead believed that the church and state need to be in complete separation. Arnold believed in &quot;apostolic poverty&quot; and that the church needed to be restored to apostolic purity. The Second Lateran Council condemned the Arnoldists for denying infant baptism.

Arnold rejected the power of the Roman church and believed that sinful clergy lost their right of administering the sacraments.

Some of his critics attacked Arnold for having &quot;offensive views on baptism and the Eucharist&quot;.

<text>The Programmer&#x27;s Workbench (PWB/UNIX) was an early, now discontinued, version of the Unix operating system that had been created in the Bell Labs Computer Science Research Group of AT&amp;T. Its stated goal was to provide a time-sharing working environment for large groups of programmers, writing software for larger batch processing computers.

Prior to 1973 Unix development at AT&amp;T was a project of a small group of researchers in Department 1127 of Bell Labs. As the usefulness of Unix in other departments of Bell Labs was evident, the company decided to develop a version of Unix tailored to support programmers in production work, not just research. The Programmer&#x27;s Workbench was started in 1973, by Evan Ivie and Rudd Canaday to support a computer center for a 1000-employee Bell Labs division, which would be the largest Unix site for several years. PWB/UNIX was to provide tools for teams of programmers to manage their source code and collaborate on projects with other team members. It also introduced several stability improvements beyond Research Unix, and broadened usage of the Research nroff and troff text formatters, via efforts with Bell Labs typing pools that led to the -mm macros.

While PWB users managed their source code on PDP-11 Unix systems, programs were often written to run on other operating systems. For this reason, PWB included software for submitting jobs to IBM System/370, UNIVAC 1100 series, and SDS Sigma 5 computers. In 1977 PWB supported a user community of about 1100 users in the Business Information Systems Programs (BISP) group of Bell Labs.

Two major releases of Programmer&#x27;s Workbench were produced. PWB/UNIX 1.0, released July 1, 1977 was based on Version 6 Unix; PWB 2.0 was based on Version 7 Unix. The operating system was advertised by Bell System Software as late as 1981 and edition 1.0 was still on an AT&amp;T price list for educational institutions in 1984. Most of PWB/UNIX was later incorporated in the commercial UNIX System III and UNIX System V releases.

==Features==
Notable firsts in PWB include:
* The Source Code Control System, the first UNIX revision control system, written by Marc J. Rochkind
* The remote job entry batch-submission system
* The PWB shell, written by John R. Mashey, which preceded Steve Bourne&#x27;s Bourne shell
* The restricted shell (&quot;rsh&quot;), an option of the PWB shell, used to create widely-available logins for status-checking, trouble-reporting, but made safe by restricting commands 
* The troff &quot;-mm&quot; (memorandum) macro package, written by John R. Mashey and Dale W. Smith
* Utilities like find, cpio, expr, all three written by Dick Haight, xargs, egrep and fgrep
* yacc and lex, which, though not written specifically for PWB, were available outside of Bell Labs for the first time in the PWB distribution

<text>Movement is the debut studio album by English rock band New Order, released on 13 November 1981 by Factory Records. Recorded in the wake of Joy Division frontman Ian Curtis&#x27; suicide the previous year, the album is a continuation of the dark post-punk sound of Joy Division&#x27;s material, increasing the use of synthesizers while still being predominantly rooted in rock. At the time of its release, the album was not particularly well received by critics or audiences, only peaking at number thirty on the UK Albums Chart; the band would gradually shift to a more electronic sound over the course of the next year.

In the decades since its release, retrospective critical reception has been very positive, with reviewers praising the album as a middle ground between the band&#x27;s work as Joy Division and their subsequent alternative dance material. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed the album at number 42 on its list of the &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;, saying it &quot;exists almost exactly in between Joy Division&#x27;s post-punk sound and the synth-pop style that would come to define New Order and influence pop music for decades&quot;.

==Recording==
After the suicide of Joy Division&#x27;s singer Ian Curtis in May 1980, and the subsequent shock for those surrounding him, remaining members Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris elected to carry on, albeit under a new name – New Order. With the exception of two songs, &quot;Ceremony&quot; (first played live at Joy Division&#x27;s last gig, a little over two weeks before Curtis&#x27;s death) and &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; (unreleased, but demoed in the studio), all the material played would be new.

A couple of songs on &quot;Movement&quot; stem from the initial songwriting session the band undertook in the summer of 1980. &quot;Dreams Never End&quot; and &quot;Truth&quot; were both played at the initial New Order concerts (still played as a trio) in the US that September. At this point it was still undecided as to who should be vocalist. The interim solution was that all three members took turns at singing before finally deciding that Bernard Sumner should take the main vocalist&#x27;s role with Peter Hook as back-up (though he sang lead on &quot;Dreams Never End&quot; and &quot;Doubts Even Here&quot;). The introduction in October 1980 of Gillian Gilbert, Stephen Morris&#x27;s girlfriend, lightened the burden on Sumner who had to play guitar and keyboards and sing (something he found impossible to do simultaneously) and enabled the band to pursue a more electronic approach. Subsequently, the remainder of the songs that appeared on &quot;Movement&quot; were written and then recorded over a seven-month period &quot;in two big bits, and a whole lot of little bits&quot;, according to Sumner, as well as &quot;Mesh&quot;, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; (both early live staples and used as B-sides), &quot;Procession&quot; and &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot;, the latter forming a non-album single released as FAC53 in September 1981.

The producer of the album was once again Martin Hannett, who had worked with them as Joy Division; however, the rapport between producer and band had in the ensuing time eroded. Hannett was in a legal dispute with Factory Records and suffering from substance and alcohol abuse, and the band members—themselves still coming to terms with having to write and arrange songs without Curtis&#x27;s ear and lyric-writing ability—found him uncooperative. It would be the last album that they worked on together, with Hannett walking out on the band during the production of &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot;.

==Sound==
Musically, &quot;Movement&quot; is a transitional album. References to Ian Curtis appear on the song &quot;ICB&quot; (an initialism for &#x27;Ian Curtis Buried&#x27;, as confirmed by Peter Hook in a 2013 interview) Keith Gwyllim of Stylus Magazine described it: &quot;Most of &quot;Movement&quot; is filled with droning post-punk dirges shot through with veins of electro-pop and primitive dub-sounding experiments. For all intents and purposes, an extension of the final recorded songs of Joy Division, such as &quot;Isolation&quot; and &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot;.

In a questionnaire interview with the fanzine &quot;Artificial Life&quot; (No. 2, Nov. 1982), the band were asked if they were happy with the album to which they replied, &quot;We were happy with the songs, not all happy with the production.&quot; Peter Hook later revealed, &quot;We were confused musically ... Our songwriting wasn&#x27;t coming together. I don&#x27;t know how we pulled out of that one. I actually liked &quot;Movement&quot;, but I know why nobody else likes it. It was good for the first two-and-a-half minutes, then it dipped.&quot;

==Artwork==
The album&#x27;s cover was designed by Peter Saville and is based on a poster by the Italian Futurist Fortunato Depero.

The shape created by the top three lines is an &#x27;F&#x27; (lying on its back), which refers to Factory Records/Factory Communications Limited and the bottom two lines create an &#x27;L&#x27; (lying on its front), the Roman numeral 50, the original catalogue was FACT 50. The blue colour of the lines was chosen by the band; the first copies in the US had the same design in brown on an ivory background.

==Critical reception==
Released in November 1981—just weeks after the Joy Division retrospective/live double album &quot;Still&quot;—&quot;Movement&quot; was met with a tepid reception, with critics disappointed by what was perceived to be a lack of forward momentum after the &quot;Ceremony&quot; single. It is rumoured that the band considered either re-mixing or even entirely re-recording the album, but time and financial constraints prevented this. A new song called &quot;Temptation&quot; would provide the band with the necessary impetus and a new direction.

Retrospectively reviewed in the context of New Order&#x27;s entire work, the album has been more positively received, with &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s Sharon O&#x27;Connell noting the &quot;future-positive declaration&quot; of the opener &quot;Dreams Never End&quot; and a &quot;kind of confident, electronic pulsing&quot; sound that would be further evident on the band&#x27;s subsequent singles, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; reviewer Tom Ewing calling it &quot;their most coherent and underappreciated record&quot;.

<doc id="1185922" wikidata="Q3275823" url="?curid=1185922" title="Steel square">
<text>The steel square is a tool used in carpentry. Carpenters use various tools to lay out structures that are square (that is, built at accurately measured right angles), many of which are made of steel, but the name &quot;steel square&quot; refers to a specific long-armed square that has additional uses for measurement, especially of various angles. It consists of a long, wider arm and a shorter, narrower arm, which meet at an angle of 90 degrees (a right angle). Today the steel square is more commonly referred to as the framing square or carpenter&#x27;s square, and such squares are no longer invariably made of steel (as they were many decades ago); they can also be made of aluminum or polymers, which are light and resistant to rust.

The longer wider arm is wide, and is called the blade; the shorter narrower arm, is wide, and is called the tongue. The square has many uses, including laying out common rafters, hip rafters and stairs. It has a diagonal scale, board foot scale and an octagonal scale. On the newer framing squares there are degree conversions for different pitches and fractional equivalents.

Framing squares may also be used as winding sticks.

== Blade and tongue ==
In traditional timber frame joinery, mortises and tenons were typically wide and from the edge of the timber when working with softwoods, giving rise to the width of the blade. Likewise, mortises and tenons were traditionally wide when working in hardwoods, explaining the width of the tongue. This allowed for quick layouts of mortise and tenon joints when working both hard and softwoods.

==Use==

=== Calibration ===
A steel square is self-proving and self-calibrating in that you can lay out a perpendicular line, flip the square over, and determine the size and direction of the error. The error can be corrected by opening or closing the angle with a center punch.

=== Stair framing ===
Stairs usually consist of three components. They are the stringer, the tread and the riser. The stringer is the structural member that carries the load of the staircase, the tread is the horizontal part that is stepped on, and the riser board is the vertical part which runs the width of the structure. There are many types of stairs: open, closed, fully housed, winding, and so on, to mention a few of them.

Laying out a staircase requires rudimentary math. There are numerous building codes to which staircases must conform. In an open area the designer can incorporate a more desirable staircase. In a confined area this becomes more challenging. In most staircases there is one more rise than there are treads.

# The &quot;rise&quot; (vertical measurement), and the &quot;run&quot; (horizontal measurement). The stringer will rest partially on the horizontal surface.
# This is a two-by-twelve piece of lumber. A framing square is placed on the lumber so that the desired rise and tread marks meet the edge of the board. The outline of the square is traced. The square is slid up the board until the tread is placed on the mark and the process is repeated.
# The board is cut along the dotted lines, and the top plumb cut and the bottom level cut are traced by holding the square on the opposite side.
# The stringer in this example has two pieces of tread stock. This allows for a slight overhang. There is also a space in between the boards. The bottom of the stringer must be cut to the thickness of the tread. This step is called &quot;dropping the stringer&quot;. After one stringer is cut this piece becomes the pattern that is traced onto the remaining stringers.

=== Roof framing ===

There is a table of numbers on the face side of the steel square; this is called the rafter table. The rafter table allows the carpenter to make quick calculations based on the Pythagorean theorem. The table is organized by columns that correspond to various slopes of the roof. Each column describes a different roof inclination (pitch) and contains the following information:

#Common rafter per foot of run. The common rafter connects the peak of a roof (the &quot;ridge&quot;) to the base of a roof (the plate). This number gives the length (hypotenuse) of the common rafter per twelve units of horizontal distance (&quot;run&quot;).
#Hip or valley rafter per foot of run. The hip or valley rafter also connects the ridge to the plate, but lies at a 45-degree angle to the common rafter. This number gives the length of the hip or valley rafter per seventeen units of run.
#Difference in lengths jacks. The jack rafters lie in the same plane as the common rafter but connect the top plate (the wall) or ridge board to the hip or valley rafter respectively. Since the hip or valley rafter meets the ridge board and the common rafter at angles of 45 degrees, the jack rafters will have varying lengths when they intersect the hip or valley. Depending on the spacing of the rafters, their lengths will vary by a constant factor—this number is the common difference.
#This angle can be cut on the fly by aligning this given number on the blade of the steel square and the twelve-inch mark on the tongue, and drawing a line along the tongue.
#Cutting hip and valley cripple rafters are all cut in a similar way.

=== Octagon scale ===
The octagon scale allows the user to inscribe an octagon inside a square, given the length of the side of the square. The markings indicate half the length of the octagon&#x27;s sides, which can be set to a compass or divider. Arcs drawn from the midpoints of the square&#x27;s sides will intersect the square at the vertices of the planned octagon. All that remains is to cut four triangular sections from the square.
===Diagonal scale===

Knee bracing is a common feature in timber framing to prevent racking under lateral loads. The diagonal scale is useful for determining the length of the a knee brace desired for a given distance from the joint between the post and beam.

===Calculators in roof framing===
In addition to use the square tool, construction calculators are also used to verify and determine roofing calculations. Some are programmed to calculate all side cuts for hip, valley and jack regular rafters to be exactly 45° for all rafter pitches. The rafter table is expressed in inches, and the higher the numerical value of the pitch, the greater the difference between side cut angles within a given pitch. Only a level roof, or a 0 pitch will require a 45° angle side cut (cheek cut) for hip and jack rafters.

===Side cut hip/valley rafter table===
If a right triangle has two angles that equal 45° then the two sides are equidistant. The rafter is the hypotenuse and the legs or catheti of the triangle are the top wall plates of the structure. The side cut is located at the intersection of the given pitch column and the side cut of the hip/valley row. The regular hip/valley rafter runs at a 45° angle to the main roof and the unit of measurement is 16.97 inches of run. Regular hip/valley and jack rafters have different bevel angles within any given pitch and the angle decreases as the pitch increases.

The side cut of the hip/valley rafter = (Tangent)(12) = side cut in inches. The side cuts in the rafter table are all in a base 12. The arc tan can be determined from any given pitch. Most power tools and angle measuring devices use 90° as 0° in construction. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used with tools like the speed square.

===Side cut of jack rafters===
The side cut is located at the intersection of the side cut of jack rafters row and the pitch column on the Steel square. There is a row for the difference in length of jacks, 16 and 24 inch centers on the blade. The tangents are directly proportional for both centers.

The tangent is in a base 12. The tangent x 12 = side cut of jack rafters. This corresponds to the side cut on the Steel square. The complementary angles of the arc tan are used on most angle measuring devices in construction. The tangent of hip, valley, and jack rafters are less than 1.00 in all pitches above 0°. An eighteen pitch has a side cut angle of 29.07° and a two pitch has a side cut angle of 44.56° for jack rafters. This is a variation of 15.5° between pitches.

Side cut angles versus pitch

This is a reference table for side cuts versus pitch. (only valid for 90 degrees eave angle) :

Pitch expressed in rise units / run units

Pitch 18/12 ==&gt; 60,86 deg

Pitch 17/12 ==&gt; 60,10 deg

Pitch 16/12 ==&gt; 59,07 deg

Pitch 15/12 ==&gt; 57,99 deg

Pitch 14/12 ==&gt;  56,94 deg

Pitch 13/12 ==&gt;  55,88 deg

Pitch 12/12 ==&gt;  54,69 deg

Pitch 11/12 ==&gt;  53,49 deg

Pitch 10/12 ==&gt;  52,54 deg

Pitch 9/12 ==&gt;  51,25 deg

Pitch 8/12 ==&gt;   50,19 deg

Pitch 7/12 ==&gt;   49,17 deg

Pitch 6/12 ==&gt;   48,15 deg

Pitch 5/12 ==&gt;   47,33 deg

Pitch 4/12 ==&gt;   46,54 deg

Pitch 3/12 ==&gt;   45,90 deg

Pitch 2/12 ==&gt;   45,22 deg

Pitch 1/12 ==&gt;   45,10 deg

Pitch 0/12 ==&gt;  45,00 deg

===Plumb cut of jack and common rafters===
The plumb cut for jack and common rafters are the same angles. The level cut or seat cut is the complementary angle of the plumb cut. The notch formed at the intersection of the level and plumb cut Is commonly referred to as the bird&#x27;s mouth .
===Plumb cut of hip/valley rafters===
The plumb cut of the hip/valley rafter is expressed in the formula. The level cut is the complementary angle or 90° minus the arc tan.
=== Irregular hip/valley rafters ===
The only Framing Square that has tables for unequal pitched roofs is the Chappell Universal Square, (patent #7,958,645). There is also a comprehensive rafter table for 6 &amp; 8 sided polygon roofs (first time ever on a framing square).
The traditional steel square&#x27;s rafter table (patented April 23,1901) is limited in that it does not have tables that allow for work with unequal pitched roofs. Irregular hip/valley rafters are characterized by plan angles that are not equal or 45°. The top plates can be 90° at the outside corners or various other angles. There are numerous irregular h/v roof plans.

== Carpenter&#x27;s square ==

In carpentry, a square is a guide for establishing right angles (90° angles) or mitre angles, usually made of metal. There are various types of square, such as speed squares, try squares and combination squares.

<text>Barbara Jackson (born December 25, 1961) is an American attorney and jurist who was elected in 2010 to an eight-year term on the North Carolina Supreme Court.

Jackson moved to Wake County at the age of 3 and graduated Athens Drive High School in 1980. Jackson, an alumna of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (bachelor&#x27;s degree, 1984; J.D. degree, 1990) and Duke University (LL.M. 2014), has worked as a legal counsel for the state of North Carolina for most of her legal career, working in the office of Governor James G. Martin (1991–1992), as an advocate for persons with disabilities (1992–1996), and as General Counsel to the North Carolina Department of Labor (2001–2004).

In 2004, Jackson was elected to an eight-year term on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, defeating incumbent judge Alan Thornburg in the statewide judicial elections. In 2010, Jackson was elected to a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court that had been held by Edward Thomas Brady, who did not run for re-election. She defeated Robert C. Hunter, a colleague on the court of appeals, in the statewide judicial elections to win the seat. When she took office in January 2011, Jackson became the court&#x27;s 96th associate justice and formed a 4-3 majority of female justices for the first time in the court&#x27;s history. She lost a bid for a second term in the election of 2018 to Democratic attorney and civil rights activist Anita Earls.

<doc id="1185928" wikidata="Q5274306" url="?curid=1185928" title="DieHard (brand)">
<text>DieHard is an American brand of automotive battery and parts owned by Advance Auto Parts and sold exclusively at Advance, Carquest and Sears stores. Advance bought the DieHard brand from Sears in December 2019.

The brand dates to 1967, having been developed by Globe-Union Battery for Sears. 
Globe-Union was later bought out by Johnson Controls, who continued to manufacture the DieHard for Sears. In its earliest years, the brand was guaranteed to last &quot;forever,&quot; that is, as long as the original owner still owned the car in which it was originally installed, in contrast to traditional &quot;pro rata&quot; battery warranties. The policy later was discontinued.

In 2019, Johnson Controls sold their battery division to Clarios, LLC, who manufacture DieHard brand, along with Duralast, Varta, and ACDelco, as well as 20 other brands. For a time, DieHard batteries were also manufactured by Exide. In March 2001, Exide pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy charges and agreed to pay a fine of $27.5million to end a federal criminal investigation into auto-battery sales to customers of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company. The case arose from investigations and accusations that Exide conspired with Sears to sell used batteries as new to Sears customers and that Exide officials had paid bribes to conceal the fraud. DieHard battery manufacturing afterward returned to Johnson Controls. 

The DieHard brand is also used on hand tools, power tools, battery chargers, booster cables, power inverters, alkaline batteries, tires, work boots, and the batteries for Craftsman power tools. Battery chargers were initially made by Associated Equipment under the &quot;608&quot; model prefix, and then later Schumacher Electric under the &quot;200&quot; model prefix.

In 2017, Sears launched a pilot location in San Antonio for a DieHard-branded auto service franchise, DieHard Auto Center Driven by Sears Auto. The intent was to operate standalone versions of the Sears Auto Center locations attached to Sears department stores; the location was chosen because it was in proximity to a Sears location that had closed. Sears opened another location at Oakland Mall in Troy, Michigan.

In 2018, parent company Sears filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On December 23, 2019, Advance Auto Parts announced that it had bought the DieHard brand for $200million.

<doc id="1185933" wikidata="Q6942214" url="?curid=1185933" title="Music of Newfoundland and Labrador">
<text>Newfoundland and Labrador is an Atlantic Canadian province with a folk musical heritage based on the Irish, English and Cornish traditions. 

Newfoundland music, while clearly Celtic and seafaring in its orientation, has an identifiable style of its own. Much of the region&#x27;s music focuses on the strong seafaring tradition in the area, and includes sea shanties and other sailing songs. While drawing comparisons in its Celtic influence to music from neighboring Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador music contains more distinct Irish, English, and Cornish influence. Modern traditional musicians include Great Big Sea, The Ennis Sisters and Ron Hynes.

==History==
A bone flute found at L&#x27;Anse Amour in Labrador is not the first evidence of the presence of music in Newfoundland and Labrador. At the time, indigenous First Nations lived in the area. Little is known for certain of their musical heritage due to the lack of written records, but the Beothuk people are reputed to have sung and danced; few details are known by modern historians. Inuit music, including percussion and so-called mouth-music, is still performed, although with modern influences. The Innu also maintain some historical musical practices.

England, Ireland and Scotland sent many settlers to eastern Canada, and they brought with them instrumental tunes, ballads, and other musical traditions, which were passed down orally through the generations. During this time, traditional songs evolved, and some acquired new lyrics or melodies.

Marching and military bands were an important part of traditional Newfoundland and Labrador music. Youth groups like the Church Lads Brigade, fraternal organizations, and other groups supported these bands.

Newfoundland&#x27;s anthem &quot;The Ode to Newfoundland&quot;, was composed by Governor Cavendish Boyle.

Christian music from Newfoundland and Labrador includes hymns and other liturgical music. Missionaries such as those with the Moravian Church used music to reach out towards native peoples; a hymn book was published in the Inuit language in 1809.

During the 1800s, operas and musical theatre became popular. Charles Hutton (musician) was a well-known performer during the 1880s. Some of these musicians, including Georgina Stirling, became known in Europe. In the early 20th century, vaudeville took the place of opera in Newfoundland. Satirist John Burke was a noted vaudeville composer and performer of that era.

==Outside influences==
Beginning in 1921, music from outside of the region became popular, especially after the advent of films with sound and the popularization of cowboy movies. Among the province&#x27;s noted country musicians was Harry Martin.

During the 1920s and 1930s, jazz and country music arrived in Newfoundland and Labrador, both through local dance bands, radio broadcasts and phonograph records. These outside musical influences were followed in the 1950s and 1960s by R&amp;B and rock and roll. Because of the presence of US military bases, including Pepperrell Air Force Base, locals were exposed to mainstream US radio artists in which were not played on local radio. The American radio station VOUS (Voice of the United States) also broadcast out of St. John&#x27;s, bringing American popular culture to both the soldiers and the Newfoundlanders. 

==Modern era==
In the modern era, many people worked to preserve the province&#x27;s musical heritage. They focused on traditional songs, but also popularized modern tunes in a traditional style, for example Otto Kelland&#x27;s 1947 composition &quot;Let Me Fish Off Cape St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;. The first hit from a native performer was 1943&#x27;s &quot;Squid-Jiggin&#x27; Ground&quot; by Art Scammell. Radio programs such as Irene B. Mellon and &quot;The Big Six&quot;, the television shows &quot;All Around The Circle&quot; (1964) and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Fancy&quot;, collections such as Gerald S. Doyle&#x27;s Old Time Songs and Poetry of Newfoundland, musicians including accordionists Ray Walsh, Wilf Doyle, Omar Blondahl, John White and the McNulty family (musicians), and scholars including Maud Karpeles also contributed to the preservation of Newfoundland and Labrador music. 

Expatriates in Ontario, including Harry Hibbs and Dick Nolan also became well-known. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a roots revival led by the bands Ryan&#x27;s Fancy, Figgy Duff and The Wonderful Grand Band achieved mainstream success in Newfoundland. Other traditional performers to rise to prominence in this period included Anita Best, Kelly Russell, Jim Payne, Émile Benoît, Rufus Guinchard, The Bay Boys and Minnie White.

In the 1980s and 1990s, traditional Newfoundland music&#x27;s popularity dwindled, though rock, punk, heavy metal, blues and other styles developed their own scenes in the region. The province&#x27;s first punk band Da Slyme formed in 1977. The Newfoundland Symphony Orchestra rose to prominence in this period, and jazz performers such as the Jeff Johnston Trio were also well known. In the early 1990s, Young Saints and Thomas Trio and the Red Albino became the first mainstream popular music bands from the province to attract attention outside the province.

The exception to this decline in traditional music&#x27;s popularity was the Belloram-based group Simani, composed of Bud Davidge and Sim Savory. They recorded a total of 12 albums from 1977 to 1997 and enjoyed success throughout Newfoundland and Labrador.

The advent of the East Coast Music Awards helped stimulate the Atlantic Canadian music scene, and was accompanied by the rise of Ron Hynes, Buddy Wasisname, The Irish Descendants, and Thomas Trio and The Red Albino, while Great Big Sea, The Navigators, and The Punters have also become well known for their mixture of traditional and popular music. A resurgence of traditional Newfoundland music is evidenced by the creation of several popular compilation CDs such as &quot;The Christmas Wish: Newfoundland Yuletide Favourites&quot;, the &quot;Downhomer Presents...&quot; series, and the &quot;Homebrew&quot; series (which has sold over 50,000 copies).

In 2008, the Atlantis Music Prize was established by &quot;The Scope&quot;, and is to be awarded annually to the best new album from Newfoundland and Labrador. The first winning album was &quot;Another Month&quot; by Mercy, the Sexton. In the late 2000s, the local rap group Gazeebow Unit was noted for its use, whether parodic or metaparodic, of Newfoundland English in rap music.

Notable newcomers bringing national and international recognition to the province include Hey Rosetta!, Amelia Curran, The Mountains &amp; the Trees, Sherman Downey, Adam Baxter, AE Bridger, Andrew James O&#x27;Brian, Don Brownrigg, Damhnait Doyle, Kat McLevey, The Novaks, and Soap Opera.

Since 2013 the musical, Come From Away has been a major contributing factor in promoting the province and its people. While the score is mostly original music, the song &quot;Heave Away&quot; is prominently featured in one of the numbers.

==Radio play==
Newfoundland music can be heard on CBC Radio One&#x27;s local programming. 
VOCM&#x27;s&quot; Irish Newfoundland Show with Greg Smith&quot; Saturday mornings, Sunday mornings on CHOZ-FM&#x27;s &quot;Jigs and Reels with Danielle Butt&quot;, or VOCM-FM&#x27;s &quot;Homebrew with Sam Whiffen&quot;.

Memorial University&#x27;s campus station, CHMR-FM Radio has several shows dedicated entirely to Newfoundland and Labrador music, including &quot;Jiggs Dinner with Roland Skinner&quot;. Other stations playing local music are &quot;Southern Shore Sounds&quot; (Ferryland), &quot;Voice of Bonne Bay&quot; (VOBB), chmr.ca, Mun Radio, CHMR-FM 93.5 FM (Aliant 787 &amp; Rogers 942), CKWR-FM 98.5 FM, CJBI-FM, and Bay Of Islands Radio BOIR.ca. 100.1 CKVB-FM (Corner Brook). 

More Celtic and local music can be heard on &quot;Celtic Wake Up&quot; hosted by Zach Snow and &quot;The NewFound Records Radio Hour&quot; hosted by Wayne Tucker, both on CHMR.

From Kitchener Waterloo, Ontario on CKWR-FM, a weekly live to air radio show called Jigs &amp; Reels Radio KW with host Dean Clarke. 

==Noted artists==
Modern Newfoundland &amp; Labrador musicians include Hey Rosetta!, folk group The Flummies, rock musician David Penashue of Tipatchimun (who sings Innu language rock), Canadian folk-rock band Great Big Sea, and a Canadian a folk trio The Once.

<text>&quot;Gypsy Eyes&quot; or &quot;Gipsy Eyes&quot; is a song written by Jimi Hendrix and performed by the Jimi Hendrix Experience for the 1968 album &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot;. Subsequently, it was released as the B-side of the &quot;Crosstown Traffic&quot; single, which reached number 52 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 37 on the UK &quot;Official Singles Chart&quot;.

==Style and composition==
In a review for AllMusic, Matthew Greenwald calls it &quot;a great slice of blues/psychedelia&quot;. He adds:
Richard Middleton notes that licks in rock music are often used through a formula and variations technique and that &quot;Gypsy Eyes&quot; &quot;is put together from variants of five stock ideas...familiar from other recordings in the same style.&quot;
#&quot;Drum lick A&quot;
#&quot;Drum lick B&quot;
#&quot;A complex of riffs on guitar and bass guitar&quot;
#&quot;A basic melodic falling pattern, using the notes of the pentatonic scale&quot;
#&quot;A characteristic guitar effect, the attacked single note with long decay and glissando fall&quot;
He concludes that &quot;the combination and variations of these formulae are many and highly imaginative. But the basic formulae are so simple that the recording could well have been worked out &#x27;in performance.&#x27;&quot;

<text>A railway turntable or wheelhouse is a device for turning railway rolling stock, usually locomotives, to face a different direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Locomotive/Railway Turntables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially used in areas where economic considerations or a lack of sufficient space have served to weigh against the construction of a turnaround wye. Railways needed a way to turn steam locomotives around for return journeys, as their controls were often not configured for extended periods of running in reverse; also many locomotives had a lower top speed in reverse. Most diesel locomotives, however, can be operated in either direction, and are considered to have &quot;front ends&quot; and &quot;rear ends&quot; (often determined by reference to the location of the crew cab). When a diesel locomotive is operated as a single unit, the railway company often prefers, or requires, that it be run &quot;front end&quot; first. When operated as part of a multiple unit locomotive consist, the locomotives can be arranged so that the consist can be operated &quot;front end first&quot; no matter which direction the consist is pointed. Turntables were also used to turn observation cars so that their windowed lounge ends faced toward the rear of the train.

Some early turntables rapidly became too small for their purpose as longer locomotives were introduced.

== History ==
Early wagonways were industrial railways for transporting goods—initially bulky and heavy items, particularly mined stone, ores and coal—from one point to another, most often to a dockside to be loaded onto ships. These early wagonways used a single point-to-point track, and when operators had to move a truck to another wagonway, they did so by hand. The lack of switching technology seriously limited the weight of any loaded wagon combination.

The first railway switches were in fact wagon turnplates or sliding rails. Turnplates were initially made of two or four pieces of wood, circular in form, that replicated the track running through them. Their diameter matched that of the wagons used on any given wagonway, and they swung around a central pivot. Loaded wagons could be moved onto the turnplate, and rotating the turnplate 90 degrees allowed the loaded wagon to be moved to another piece of wagonway. Thus, wagon weight was limited only by the strength of the wood used in the turnplates or sliding rails. When iron and later steel replaced stone and wood, weight capacity rose again.

However, the problems with turnplates and sliding rails were twofold. First, they were relatively small (often no more than in length), which limited the wagon length that could be turned. Second, their switching capacity could only be accessed when the wagon was on top of them and still, which limited the total capacity of any wagonway. The railway switch, which overcame both of these problems, was patented by Charles Fox in 1832.

As steam locomotives replaced horses as the preferred means of power, they became optimised to run in only one direction for operational ease and to provide some weather protection. The resulting need to turn heavy locomotives required an engineering upgrade to the existing turnplate technology. Like earlier turnplates, most new turntables consisted of a circular pit in which a steel bridge rotated. The bridge was typically supported and balanced by the central pivot, to reduce the total load on the pivot and to allow easy turning. This was most often achieved by a steel rail running around the floor of the pit that supported the ends of the bridge when a locomotive entered or exited. The turntables had a positive locking mechanism to prevent undesired rotation and to align the bridge rails with the exit track. Rotation of the bridge could be accomplished manually (either by brute force or with a windlass system), popularly called an &quot;Armstrong&quot; turntable, by an external power source, or by the braking system of the locomotive itself, though this required a locomotive to be on the table for it to be rotated.

The turntable bridge (the part of the turntable that included the tracks and that swivelled to turn the equipment) could span from , depending on the railway&#x27;s needs. Larger turntables were installed in maintenance facilities for longer locomotives, while short line and narrow gauge railways typically used smaller turntables. Turntables as small as in diameter have been installed in some industrial facilities where pieces of equipment are small enough to be pushed one at a time by humans or horsepower.

Some turntables that were built in earlier days rapidly became unsuitable for the longer locomotives introduced. The Roundhouse in London was built in 1846 to turn around steam locomotives on the line to Birmingham, but newer locomotives were too long within ten years—the building has been preserved and used for other purposes over the years.

== Roundhouse ==

In engine maintenance facilities, a turntable was usually surrounded, in part or in whole, by a building known as a roundhouse. It was more common for the roundhouse to only cover a portion of the land around a turntable, but there are fully circular roundhouses, such as these preserved roundhouses:

* The roundhouse that serves as the basis for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, US
* The Roundhouse in London, England, now an arts centre.
* Junee Roundhouse Railway Museum
== By country ==
=== Hungary ===
Miskolc Tiszai railway station retains an active turntable as of December 2021.

=== India ===
There was a turntable at the Talaguppa end of the Shimoga-Talaguppa railway, and one at Howbagh Railway Station near Jabalpur on the Balaghat-Jabalpur Narrow Gauge Line. Both were used to turn the railbuses serving on these lines. After railbuses were replaced by MEMUs, turntables were dismantled.

In 2012, Mumbai Metro One, the BOT operator of the Mumbai Metro Line 1, announced that it had procured turntables to be used on the Rapid Transit system.

=== Israel ===
The Israel Railway Museum, Haifa, has a turntable made by Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon &amp; Finance Company, Old Park Works, Wednesbury. It was found buried in the grounds of the Israel Defense Forces History Museum, on the site of the old Jaffa railway station yard.

=== Romania ===
Like most ex-socialist countries of Eastern Europe, Romania still has several turntables in operational use. One can even see twin turntables, each with their own 180 degree roundhouse, like for one example at Timisoara.

=== Sri Lanka ===
In Sri Lanka, most turntables which were used in the steam area have been abandoned. Most were situated at the major railway yards like Kandy, Galle, Nanu Oya, Anuradhapura, Maho, Galoya, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Polgahawela Jnc, Badulla, Puttulam, and Bandarawela and depots in Dematagoda 2no. and Maradana. All turntables in Sri Lanka Railways were operated manually. They were used to turn some rolling stock and non-dual cab locomotives. Most turntables were later scrapped, though some have been preserved in museums.

=== United Kingdom ===
In Britain, where steam-hauled trains usually had vacuum-operated brakes, it was quite common for turntables to be operated by vacuum motors worked from the locomotive&#x27;s vacuum ejector or pump via a flexible hose or pipe, although there are a few manually and electrically operated examples. The major manufacturers were Ransomes and Rapier, Ipswich and Cowans Sheldon, Carlisle. The Great Western Railway (GWR) built several tables for its own use; there is little evidence any other companies did so.

=== United States ===
Due to the asymmetric design of many locomotives, turntables still in use are more common in North America than in Europe, where locomotive design favors configurations with a controller cabin on both ends or in the middle. In San Francisco, US, the Powell cable car line uses turntables at the end of the routes, since the cable cars have operating controls at only one end of the car. The Long Island Rail Road still has a turntable and roundhouse at the Richmond Hills yard.

== Surviving turntables ==

Several working examples remain, many on heritage railways in Great Britain, and also in the United States. Some examples are:

== Accidents ==

In the United States, when deciding liability for turntable accidents, most state courts followed the precedent set by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Sioux City &amp; Pacific R.R. v. Stout&quot; (1873). In that case, a six-year-old child was playing on the unguarded, unfenced turntable when his friends began turning it. While attempting to get off, his foot became stuck and was crushed. The Court held that although the railroad was not bound by the same duty of care to strangers as it was to its passengers, it would be liable for negligence &quot;if from the evidence given it might justly be inferred by the jury that the defendant, in the construction, location, management, or condition of its machine has omitted that care and attention to prevent the occurrence of accidents which prudent and careful men ordinarily bestow.&quot;

In the case of &quot;Chicago B. &amp; Q.R. Co. v. Krayenbuhl&quot; (1902), a four-year-old child was playing on an unlocked, unguarded railroad turntable. Other children set the turntable in motion, and it severed the ankle of the young child. The child&#x27;s family sued the railroad company on a theory of negligence and won at trial. The Nebraska Supreme Court held that the railroad company may have been liable for negligence after considering the &quot;character and location of the premises, the purpose for which they are used, the probability of injury therefrom, the precautions necessary to prevent such injury, and the relations such precautions bear to the beneficial use of the premises.&quot; However, the Supreme Court reversed the trial court&#x27;s decision based on an improper jury instruction as to the evidence.

Accidents to locomotives sometimes occurred. For example, if the turntable was incorrectly set and a locomotive was accidentally started or failed to stop, it might fall into the turntable pit.

On rare occasions, a turntable would spin too fast during high winds, as happened at Garsdale (Settle–Carlisle line) in the UK c.1900. At this very exposed location, this was resolved by surrounding the turntable with a wooden stockade made from old sleepers.

== Unusual turntables ==

* The roundhouse in Montluçon, France, was equipped with a separate turntable and sector plate, which is a table pivoted at one end, in this case at the edge of the turntable. The sector plate served the side of the roundhouse that housed autorails with less requirement for turning. Both the turntable and sector plate were served by separate connections to the roundhouse. If turning was required the two could be connected together. The resulting roundhouse was not completely circular. Part of the roundhouse with the turntable is still extant. A similar, operational sector plate is located in Bavaria at the German Steam Locomotive Museum.
* Due to a lack of space at Ventnor railway station, a small turntable was provided to allow steam engines to run around their trains. Other stations with this arrangement included , Withernsea and .
* The last remaining operational triple-gauge turntable in the world, used to station trains into the 23 bay roundhouse, exists at the Steamtown Heritage Centre in Peterborough, South Australia.
* A turntable exists on the Midland Line, New Zealand at Arthurs Pass in New Zealand. Steam engines on excursions cannot enter the Otira tunnel so must be turned around for the return

== Multiple turntables ==
Stations housing large numbers of engines may have more than one turntable:
* Old Oak Common TMD – formerly 4 
* Enfield – formerly 3 (none survives today)
* Broadmeadow – 2 (3rd removed, now in Thirlmere, NSW)
* Falun – 2 
* Hallsberg – 2 
* Göteborg Sävenäs yard – 2 (Second removed ~2005)
* Linwood – formerly 2 (second removed during 1980/1990s)
* Valladolid () – 2

*List of railway roundhouses, most or all of which include a turntable
* Wye – a way of turning whole trains.
* Transfer table (UK: &#x27;traverser&#x27;) – provides access to two or more parallel tracks in a space saving manner like a turntable, but without the ability to turn.
* A Sector plate or sector table is a traverser that rotates around a pivot that is not at the centre and therefore cannot rotate through 360˚.
* Nowadays control cars, or coaches with controls at one end, have largely eliminated the need for turntables.
* Singapore and Hong Kong have a combined traverser-turntable that takes 4-car sets.

<text>Afro-Asians, African Asians, Blasians, or simply Black Asians are people of mixed Asian and African ancestry. Historically, Afro-Asian populations have been marginalised as a result of human migration and social conflict.

==Africa==

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===

====Katanga Afro-Japanese====
During the 1970s, an increased demand for copper and cobalt attracted Japanese investments in the mineral-rich southeastern region of Katanga Province. Over a 10-year period, more than 1,000 Japanese miners relocated to the region, confined to a strictly male-only camp. Arriving without family or spouses, the men often sought social interaction outside the confines of their camps. In search of intimacy with the opposite sex, resulting in cohabitation, the men openly engaged in interracial dating and relationships, a practice embraced by the local society. As a result, a number of Japanese miners fathered children with native Congolese women. However, most of the mixed race infants resulting from these unions died, soon after birth. Multiple testimonies of local people suggest that the infants were poisoned by a Japanese lead physician and nurse working at the local mining hospital. Subsequently, the circumstances would have brought the miners shame as most of them already had families back in their native Japan. The practice forced many native Katangan mothers to hide their children by not reporting to the hospital to give birth.

Today, fifty Afro-Japanese have formed an association of &quot;Katanga Infanticide&quot; survivors. The organization has hired legal counsel seeking a formal investigation into the killings. The group submitted an official inquiry to both the Congolese and Japanese governments, to no avail. Issues specific to this group include having no documentation of their births since not having been born in the local hospital spared their lives. The total number of survivors is unknown.

===Equatorial Guinea===
The mid-19th century saw about 500 Chinese laborers and indentured servants, along with a handful from India stealthily imported to the island of Fernando Po through the once Portuguese owned Macau. While most of these servants returned to their homelands at the end of their servitude, a few remained, settling and marrying into the local population. One example is immigrant East Indian laborer Francisco Kashu Alimama who remained in Moka after the death of his last living relative. He married the daughter of one of the last Bubi kings, producing several Indo-Equatoguinean children.
===Gabon===
Gabonese politician Jean Ping is the son of a Chinese father and Gabonese mother.

===Ghana===
Many Chinese men who engaged in gold mining in Ghana married local Ghanaian women and had children with them, and then the Ghana government deported illegal miners, leaving the mixed race Chinese fathered children stranded in Ghana, while their fathers were sent back to China.

===Kenya===
====Zheng He&#x27;s fleet====
In 1999, Nicholas Kristof of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported a surprising encounter on the island of Pate, where he found a village of stone huts. He talked to an elderly man living in the village who said that he was a descendant of Chinese explorers who were shipwrecked there centuries before. The Chinese had supposedly traded with the locals and had even loaded giraffes onto their ship to take back to China. However, the Chinese ran aground on a nearby reef. Kristof found evidence that confirmed the man&#x27;s story. Such evidence included the Asian features of the people in the village, plus Asian-looking porcelain artifacts. These descendants of Zheng He&#x27;s fleet occupy both Pate and Lamu Islands. Around 400 survivors of these 20 shipwrecked Chinese sailors settled and married with local women.

====New immigration====
New interest in Kenya&#x27;s natural resources has attracted over $1 billion of investment from Chinese firms. This has propelled new development in Kenya&#x27;s infrastructure with Chinese firms bringing in their own male workers to build roads. The temporary residents usually arrive without their spouses and families. Thus, a rise of incidents involving local college-aged females has resulted in an increased rate of Afro-Chinese infant births to single Kenyan mothers.

In Kenya there is a trend of the following influx of Chinese male workers in Kenya with a growing number of abandoned babies of Chinese men who fathered children with local women, causing concern.

===Madagascar===
Intermarriage between native Malagasy women and Chinese men were not uncommon. Several thousand Cantonese men intermarried and cohabited with Malagasy women. 98% of the Chinese traced their origin from Guangdong, specifically the Cantonese district of Shunde. For example, the census alone in 1954 census found 1,111 &quot;irregular&quot; Chinese-Malagasy unions and 125 legitimate, i.e., legally married, partnerships. Most offspring were registered by their mothers under a Malagasy name.

More generally, the Malagasy are often described as the oldest Blasian population in human history. They indeed descend - to different degrees depending on the ethnic groups - from Bantu Africans and Banjar sailors.

===Mauritius===

Approximately 68% of the population has some Indian ancestry. About 25% of the population is Creole (of mixed French and African descent) and there are small numbers of people of Franco-Mauritian and Chinese descent.

===Nigeria===

Since the 1970s, Nigeria has seen a slow, but steady, increase in the immigrant Filipino population drawn by the oil industry. Established in 1973, the Philippine Barangay Society of Nigeria addresses issues specific to over 1,700 &quot;Nigerized&quot; Filipinos living in the country. This acculturation has resulted in a small but growing, number of biracial Nigerian Filipinos births. Most of these children are parented by Filipino mothers and Nigerian fathers.

A Chinese man abandoned his Nigerian Ogun girlfriend Tope Samuel with their child in Ogun state.

===Reunion===

The native Kaf population has a diverse range of ancestry stemming from colonial Indian and Chinese peoples. They also descend from African slaves brought from countries like Mozambique, Guinea, Senegal, Madagascar, Tanzania and Zambia to the island.

Most population of Réunion Creoles who are of mixed ancestry and make up the majority of the population. Interracial marriages between European men and Chinese men with African women, Indian women, Chinese women, Madagascar women were also common.

===Seychelles===

More than 70% of the native population has Afro-Asian ancestry stemming from African, Malagasy, Indian and Chinese peoples, combined with additional British and French origins. However, the demographic is specifically proud of their African/Malagasy heritage and have formed an institute promoting their identity and cultural tolerance.

===South Africa and Namibia===

The Cape Coloured population descend from the indigenous Khoisan and Xhosa peoples, European immigrants and Malagasy, Ceylonese and Southeast Asian (primarily Indonesian) laborers and slaves brought by the Dutch from the mid-17th century to the late 18th century. The majority of people of Colour, particularly in the Western Cape and Northern Cape, speak Afrikaans as a first language, while those in other parts of South Africa tend to speak English as well. People of Colour with Javanese or other Indonesian ancestry may often be regarded as Cape Malay and are primarily Muslims, while the majority of people of Colour are Christian (generally Protestant) or agnostic. Due to similar social adversities experienced under the Apartheid regime from the late 1940s to the late 1980s, Coloured and indigenous South African communities generally fall under the black social category when it comes to employment and affirmative action policies.

====Cape Coloureds====

There is a significant genetic mixture of European, African, Indian and East/Southeast Asian DNA in the modern ethnic group of Cape Coloured.

===Uganda===

There was a widespread migration of Indians to Southeast Africa, during the time of the construction of the East African/Uganda railway. The Asian migrants married local Ugandans and gave rise to generations of Afro-Asians.

New immigration

In the past decades, Chinese male workers, investors, contractors, traders, and entrepreneurs from China have been pouring into Uganda. In hopes of gaining residency, an increasing number of Chinese men are marrying Ugandan women, with many being sham marriages. A number of children of Chinese fathers and Ugandan mothers were born as a result.

An official from Uganda&#x27;s directorate of citizenship and immigration control who were concerned with the marriages between Chinese men and Ugandan women, told the committee.
:&quot;But we have many who are marrying and even producing... Even our Ugandan women are accepting to [reproduce] with these men.&quot;

==Americas==
===Central and South America===
In Central and South America, significant numbers of Chinese first started arriving in the mid-19th century as part of the Coolie slave trade. By the mid-20th century, Cuba and Peru had the largest Chinese populations. By the end of WWII, there were considerable high numbers of Central and South America descended from local women and Chinese fathers. There are also small numbers of Central and South American residents of Asian and African descent in countries like Puerto Rico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

====Cuba====

About 120,000 Cantonese laborers, all males, entered Cuba under contract for 80 years; most did not marry, but Hung Hui (1975:80) cites there was a frequency of sexual activity between black women and Cantonese coolies. According to Osberg (1965:69) the free Chinese conducted the practice of buying slave women and freeing them expressly for marriage. In the 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese men (Cantonese) engaged in sexual activity with both White and Black Cuban women and from such relations many children were born.

In the 1920s an additional 30,000 Cantonese and small groups of Japanese also arrived; both immigrations were exclusively male and there was rapid intermarriage with white, black and mulato populations. The CIA World Factbook Cuba, in 2008, claimed a population of 114,240 Chinese-Cubans, with only 300 being pure Chinese.

In the 1920s, an additional 30,000 Chinese arrived; the immigrants were exclusively male. In 1980, 4000 Chinese lived there, but by 2002, only 300 pure Chinese were left.

1.6% of Cuban population have direct East Asian male paternal ancestor.

One of Cuba&#x27;s most known Afro-Asians is the artist Wifredo Lam.

====Haiti====
In Haiti, there is a sizable percentage within the minority who are of Asian descent. Haiti is also home to Marabou peoples, a half African and half East Indian people who descent from East Indian immigrants who arrived from other Caribbean nations, such Martinique and Guadeloupe and African slave descendants. Most present-day descendants of the original Marabou are mostly of African in ancestry.

The country also has a sizable Chinese-Haitian population. One of the country&#x27;s most notable Afro-Asians is the late painter Edouard Wah who was born to an Afro-Haitian mother and a Chinese immigrant father.

====Peru====

About 100,000 Cantonese coolies (almost all males) in 1849 to 1874 migrated to Peru and intermarried with Peruvian women of European, African, Amerindian, mestizo and mulatto origin. Many Peruvian Chinese today are of mixed Spanish, Amerindian and Chinese lineages. Among this population exist many of African slave lineage. Estimates for the Chinese-Peruvian population range from about 1.3–1.6 million. Asian-Peruvians are estimated to be 3% of the population, but one source places the number of citizens with some Chinese ancestry at 4.2 million, which equates to 15% of the country&#x27;s total population.

====Brazil====

Brazil has the largest Japanese community outside Japan and a large Chinese and Korean minority as well. The country&#x27;s brown population, which includes mixed race mestizo and mulatto Brazilians, is almost half of the entire population and it also includes people of Eurasian, Roma and indigenous descent . Interracial marriages between Asians, mostly Japanese and Brazilians of African descent are less common than those between East Asians and Brazilians of European, Arab, and Jewish descent, which are not uncommon and known as hāfu or ainoko. Most East Asians live in São Paulo and Paraná. Afro-Asians can be found in Rio de Janeiro, where there is a sizeable Chinese minority as well as a Vietnamese and Indonesian population, and Bahia, where the majority of black people live.

===The West Indies===

In the 1860s, East Indian and Chinese immigrants arrived in the West Indies as indentured servants. Chinese male laborers and migrants went to Peru, Cuba, Haiti, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica and Trinidad where they often intermarried with local black women which resulted in a large population of racially mixed children. According to the 1946 Census from Jamaica and Trinidad alone, 12,394 Chinese were located between Jamaica and Trinidad. 5,515 of those who lived in Jamaica were Chinese-Jamaican, also known as &quot;Chinese colored&quot; (Chinese mixed race) and another 3,673 were Chinese-Trinidadians (Chinese colored) living in Trinidad. The Chinese men who married African women in Guyana and Trinidad Tobago were mostly Cantonese, while the Chinese men who married African women in Jamaica were mostly Hakka but with a large minority of Cantonese men. In her book and documentary &quot;Finding Samuel Lowe: China, Jamaica, Harlem&quot;, Afro-Chinese-Jamaican-American Paula Williams Madison explores her grandfather&#x27;s life and travels. The journey ends with the reunion of the author&#x27;s immediate relatives with their newly discovered extended family in Guangdong, China. 1871 the census was recorded at a population of 506,154 people, 246,573 of which were males and 259,581 females. Their races were recorded as 13,101 White people, 100,346 Coloured (mixed Black and White) and 392,707 Black people with a minority making up other races.

In Jamaica, Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad, a percentage of the population of people are of Chinese and Indian descent (from paternal Grandfather), some of whom have contributed to Afro-Asian-Caribbean children.

Approximately 4% of Jamaican men have a direct Chinese paternal ancestor.

====Guyana====

Between 1853 and 1879, roughly 14,000 Chinese indentured workers arrived in British Guiana on five-year indenture contracts to work on the colony&#x27;s sugar plantations. They soon integrated into the local culture, converting to Christianity and learning English. The majority of workers were unmarried men, and intermarried with local Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese women.

====Trinidad and Tobago====
The country is known for having a large Indian population stemming from the 18th and 19th-century colonial plantation economy and people of Indian descent now make up a narrow plurality. In Trinidad and Tobago, people of African-Indian mixed descent are called &quot;douglas&quot;. One of the country&#x27;s most notable Afro-Asians is its former President George Maxwell Richards and musician Nicki Minaj.

===United States===

In 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and Chinese workers who chose to stay in the U.S. could no longer be with their wives who stayed behind in China. Because White Americans looked at Chinese labor workers as stealing employment, they were harassed and discriminated against. Many Chinese men settled in black communities in states such as Mississippi and, in turn, married black women. In the mid-19th to 20th centuries, hundreds of thousands of Chinese men in the U.S., mostly of Cantonese origin from Taishan, migrated to the United States. Anti-miscegenation laws in many states prohibited Chinese men from marrying white women. After the Emancipation Proclamation, many intermarriages in some states were not recorded and historically, Chinese-American men married African-American women in high proportions to their total marriage numbers due to few Chinese-American women being in the United States. After the Emancipation Proclamation, many Chinese-Americans immigrated to the Southern states, particularly Arkansas, to work on plantations. For example, in 1880, the tenth US Census of Louisiana alone counted 57% of interracial marriages between these Chinese Americans to be with African Americans and 43% to be with European-American women. Between 20 and 30 percent of the Chinese who lived in Mississippi married black women before 1940.

In the mid 19th to 20th century, males of Asian ancestry were in far greater females. Filipino men often dated and cohabited white women, some married white females while most married black females due to miscegenation laws. Filipino population in all over United States was made up overwhelmingly of men. For example, in California the Filipino population was 30,470 and in mainland leapt from 5,603 in 1920 to 45,208 ten years later. 
====U.S. Census reports====
According to the 2010 United States Census, there are 185,595 people of Native African or African-American and Asian descent in the United States. Reports further offer the following break-down of all groups having Native African or African-American and Asian descent:



==East Asia==
===China===
Currently, Afro-Asian births are on the rise resulting from the arrival of African students in cities such as Nanjing, Hangzhou and Shanghai. Another contributing factor is the strengthened trade relationships between Africa and China which have invited an influx of African immigrants into China, primarily Nigerians who have formed a small, yet progressive, community in the country. In October 2010, Chinese officials estimated about 500 mixed marriages between Africans and Chinese. In places such as Guangzhou, a progressive population of about 10,000 African entrepreneurs continues to thrive.

The majority of the Chinese people who live and marry Africans in Guangzhou come from the poorer provinces Sichuan, Hunan and Hubei.

China&#x27;s new emerging population of Afro-Asians also includes Pate and Lamu Island descendants of ancient shipwrecked Chinese explorers. Awarded Chinese citizenship by the Chinese government, many students have been provided full scholarships to universities in China. Among China&#x27;s most famous Afro-Asian natives are Shanghai-born Lou Jing who, in 2009, garnered national gossip as she rose to fame competing on popular reality TV show Dragon TV&#x27;s &quot;Go Oriental Angel&quot; and half Chinese and half South African volleyball player Ding Hui.

By 2020, there are an estimated 200,000 Africans living in China, with the majority residing in Guangzhou.

===Japan===
In recent history, the hike in the African-Japanese population has been linked to the American occupation of Japan following the end of World War II, where African-Japanese children were born through either prostitution or legally binding marriage. Thus, over the years, an increased number of African-American male/Japanese female unions has produced a culturally mixed African-American and Japanese population living in Japan. Once given preferential treatment during the American military presence in Japan, the currently biracial population faces some severe public backlash and marginalization due to the reemergence of ethnic-based nationalism in Japan. These unions between Asian women and American G.I.s have also contributed to the increase of the Afro-Asian orphan population. In some cases many Asian wives accompanied their husbands in returning to and settling in the United States. Subsequently, many African-Japanese are products of unions between Native Japanese and continental Africans due to the increased numbers of immigrant Africans.

====Notable people====

Notable African-Japanese include American author and playwright Velina Hasu Houston who was born in territorial waters off the coast of Japan to a native-born Japanese mother of partial Japanese ancestry and an African-American father. Popular American-born enka singer Jero was born into a multi-generational African-Japanese-American family and immigrated back to the birth country of his grandmother. He has become one of the most famous Black/African descendants in the country. There is also native-born wrestler Aja Kong, tennis player Naomi Osaka, former professional basketball player Michael Takahashi, and pop/R&amp;B singer Thelma Aoyama who were all born to Japanese mothers and African-American fathers. Current Los Angeles Lakers forward Rui Hachimura was born to a Japanese mother and Beninese father. Sprinter Asuka Cambridge was born to a Japanese mother and a Jamaican father.

====Afro-fusion in Japanese media====
Other notable African descendants in Japanese media include singer Crystal Kay and beauty queen Ariana Miyamoto.

===South Korea===
The U.S. deployment of forces to South Korea between 1950 and 1954 resulted in a multitude of Afro-Asian births, mostly between native South Korean women and African-American servicemen. While many of these births have been to married African-American and Korean interracial couples, others have been born out-of-wedlock through prostitution. Already facing the dilemma of 85,000 children left homeless throughout the country after the Korean War, South Korea saw a spike in orphaned Afro-Korean infants. Often, the Afro-Korean orphans were purposely starved, as the society deemed mixed-raced children less worthy of food needed by non-mixed Korean children. In some areas, the mixed-raced youth were even denied education. In 1955, the U.S. State Department made a public plea asking American families to open their doors to the ostracized youth and in 1956 the Holt Adoption Program launched a gateway for Christian faith-based adoption of children of G.I. soldiers that also included Eurasian offspring. However, in addition to the race-based discrimination faced in their country of birth, Afro-Korean orphans were still passed over by adopting American families based on skin color preferences. There is also a general stigma placed on Afro-Koreans based on illegitimacy, low socio-economic status, low educational attainment and aesthetics.

Notable Koreans of African descent:
==Europe==
===United Kingdom===

The British Mixed-Race population includes some Afro-Asian people. This ancestry may stem from a multi-generational mixed Caribbean lineage, as well as interracial unions between Asians and Africans from prominent populations such as British Indians and British Nigerians. Notable Afro-Asian Britons include multigenerational Afro-Chinese-Caribbean-descended Naomi Campbell, first generation biracial Iranian-Ghanaian-descended actress Freema Agyeman and first generation biracial Indo-Caribbean-descended musician David Jordan.

==South Asia==
===India===

The Siddi, also known as Sidi, Siddhi, Sheedi or Habshi, are an ethnic group inhabiting India. The first members of the community arrived on the subcontinent in 628 AD at the port of Bharuch. Others followed in their footsteps during the Muslim conquests beginning in 712 AD. The latter group are believed to have been serving under Muhammad bin Qasim&#x27;s army, and were called &quot;Zanjis&quot;.

Some Siddis escaped slavery to establish communities in forested areas, and some also established the small Siddi principalities of Janjira State on Janjira Island and Jafarabad State in Kathiawar as early as the twelfth century. A former alternative name of Janjira was Habshan (i.e., land of the Habshis). In the Delhi Sultanate period prior to the rise of the Mughals in India, Jamal-ud-Din Yaqut was a prominent Siddi slave-turned-nobleman who was a close confidant of Razia Sultana (1235–1240 CE). Although this is disputed, he may also have been her lover, but contemporary sources do not indicate that this was necessarily the case.

Siddis were also brought as slaves by the Deccan Sultanates. Several former slaves rose to high ranks in the military and administration, the most prominent of which was Malik Ambar. The majority of them reside in Karnataka, Gujarat and Hyderabad. Siddis are primarily Muslims, although some are Hindus and others belong to the Catholic Church.

===Pakistan===

The Siddis, also known as Makranis, also inhabit Pakistan. They are descended from Bantu peoples from the African Great Lakes region. Some were merchants, sailors and mercenaries. Others were indentured servants, but the vast majority were brought to the Indian subcontinent as slaves by Portuguese and Arab merchants. The Siddi community is currently estimated at 20,000–55,000 individuals with the cities of Makran and Karachi serving as the main population centres for them. Siddis in Pakistan are primarily Sufi Muslims.

Narang et al. (2011) examined the autosomal DNA of Siddis in Pakistan. According to the researchers, about 58% of the Siddis&#x27; ancestry is derived from Bantu peoples. The remainder is associated with local Indo-European-speaking North and Northwest Indian populations, due to recent admixture events. However, Guha et al. (2012) observed few genetic differences between the Makrani of Pakistan and adjacent populations. According to the authors, the genome-wide ancestry of the Makrani was essentially the same as that of the neighboring Indo-European-speaking Balochi and Dravidian-speaking Brahui.

===Sri Lanka===

The Sri Lanka Kaffirs are an ethnic group in Sri Lanka who are partially descended from 16th-century Portuguese traders and Bantu slaves with additional admixture from ethnic Sri Lankans who were brought by them to work as labourers and soldiers to fight against the Sinhala Kings. They are very similar to the Zanj-descended populations in Iraq and Kuwait, and are known in Pakistan as Sheedis and in India as Siddis. The Kaffirs spoke a distinctive creole based on Portuguese, the Sri Lanka Kaffir language, now extinct. Their cultural heritage includes the dance styles Kaffringna and Manja and their popular form of dance music Baila.

The term Kaffir is said to mean &#x27;non-believer&#x27;. It does not hold the same meaning in Sri Lanka as it does in countries like South Africa, where it is used as a racial slur.

==Southeast Asia==
===Philippines===
Most older Afro-Filipinos were born from African-American G.I. and Filipino parentage. More recently, the Overseas Filipino Worker communities have produced interracial marriages with people of African descent in the Americas or Europe, resulting in Afro-Filipinos who may return to the country as natural born Filipinos. In 2011, &quot;The Nigerian Family Association&quot; notified the Republic of the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs of its formation, opening membership to a growing number interracial Nigerian-Filipino/Filipino-Nigerian families and their children living in Nigeria.

Afro-Filipinos are not subject to socio-economical, cultural or political marginalization within Philippine society as other Afro-Asians may experience within more xenophobic neighboring Asian countries. This unique acceptance of Afro-Asians and biracials within the Philippines may be down to the full social integration of Afro-Asians who speak Philippine languages natively, Filipino familiarity with Aetas and other Negrito indigenous Filipinos who share some facial features and skin tones with Afro-Filipinos, popular affiliation to African-American culture and music as a relatable and non-colonial subculture or positive Afro-Filipino representation internationally, reflecting their patriotism and affinity to the Philippines.

Their social positions vary widely, with some living in poor or working class areas, while most are lower middle or upper middle class citizens. Most Afro-Filipinos live in and around Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Metro Cebu, or in Olongapo, Clark or Angeles cities in Central Luzon around the former American bases.

Many Afro-Filipinos represent the Philippines in international events like Kristina Knott and gold medalist Eric Cray (African-American-Filipino) in the 30th SEA Games held in the Philippines in 2019 or Mau Marcelo, winner of Philippine Idol 2006. Afro-Filipino sportsmen gain popularity within the highly popular Philippine Basketball Association or on local TV and in the hospitality sectors.

Among the country&#x27;s most recognizable Afro-Asians are half African-American/Filipino R&amp;B singers Jaya, Mau Marcelo and Luke Mejares.

===Singapore===
Mixed marriages between ethnic Asians and foreigners are becoming more common in Singapore. While most mixed marriages between ethnic Asians and foreigners involve marriages between Europeans and Asians, some marriages have involved Africans and Asians. Afro-Asians born out of these mixed marriages have added to the mixed race population of Singapore. The 2014 Miss Singapore Universe finalist Ijechi Nazirah Nwaozuzu is Afro-Asian. Her mother is Malay with additional Portuguese, Indian and Chinese ancestry and her father is Nigerian.

=== Vietnam ===
During the Vietnam War, many Americans soldiers found themselves fathering and subsequently left behind their mixed-race children( or Amerasian) with their native Vietnamese mother. The demographics of servicemen in the Vietnam war have also changed in recent history, especially with the integration of those with African-American descents into the war efforts. Throughout the course of the Vietnam War, the population of Afro-Vietnamese saw a drastic increase. Some of these children were abandoned by the Vietnamese family or sent to orphanages. Many orphans and children were airlifted to adopting families in the United States in 1975 during &quot;Operation Babylift&quot; before the fall of South Vietnam. The Afro-Vietnamese (or Afro-Amerasian) children suffered much discrimination in Vietnam at that time. There was also some controversy as to how these orphaned Afro-Amerasian children were placed in new homes in the United States.

====Notable people====
One of the most notable Afro-Vietnamese, while also might have been forgotten to history is Martine Bokassa, daughter of Jean-Bedel Bokassa, the 2nd president (1966–76) and emperor (r. 1976–79) of the Central African Republic, and Nguyễn Thị Huệ. Jean-Bedel Bokassa married Nguyễn Thị Huệ during his station in Indo-China as a French soldier in the Indochina Wars. He was separated from his Nguyễn Thị Huệ and his daughter shortly after, as the conflicts ended between durations of his tours of duty. After returning to his home country of Central African Republic, he quickly rose to power, and assumed the role of president in 1976. Wishing to reunite with his Afro-Vietnamese daughter, Jean-Bedel Bokassa seeks assistance the French consult in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) and eventually was alerted of a match in Martine Nguyen Thi Bai. While celebration were going on in the CAR, an article were published on the &quot;Trắng Đen&quot; newspaper, stating the Martine that currently reunited with her father is in fact an imposter, and that the real daughter of Jean-Bedel Bokassa is still living in Saigon with her mother. After inviting both the real Martine and her mother to CAR, Jean-Bedel Bokassa accused the French government of espionage. On his 50th birthday, Jean-Bedel Bokassa decided to adopt the false Martine as his own daughter. 

==West Asia==
===Saudi Arabia===

According to The World Factbook, around 10% of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s population is of Afro-Asian descent. Most Afro-Asians living in Saudi Arabia are Afro-Arabs, who occasionally face discrimination due to their dark skin. Marriages between Saudi Arabs and Sub-Saharan Africans are quite common in Saudi Arabia.

<text>Sir Landon Ronald (born Landon Ronald Russell) (7 June 1873 – 14 August 1938) was an English conductor, composer, pianist, teacher and administrator.

In his early career he gained work as an accompanist and &quot;répétiteur&quot;, but struggled to make his way as a conductor. In the absence of operatic or symphonic work he made his living as a conductor and composer in West End shows in the late 19th and early 20th century. With the foundation of the London Symphony Orchestra in 1904 his career began to flourish, and by 1908 he was well-enough established to be chosen to succeed Thomas Beecham as conductor of the New Symphony Orchestra in London.

Ronald was an early enthusiast for recording, and was associated with the Gramophone Company (later part of EMI) from 1900 for the rest of his life.

From 1910 until shortly before his death, Ronald was principal of the Guildhall School of Music in London. He modernised the curriculum and raised its standards to compete with the leading musical training establishments the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
Ronald was born in Kensington, London, the illegitimate son of Henry Russell, singer, songwriter and merchant, and his partner Hannah de Lara, a painter. He was the younger brother of the impresario Henry Russell and half-brother of the novelist William Clark Russell. He was educated at St Marylebone Grammar School and a boarding school in Margate, and took private music lessons from the violinist Henry Holmes and the composer Kate Loder. Between 1884 and 1890 he was enrolled at the Royal College of Music, where he studied under Hubert Parry and Charles Villiers Stanford.

In 1891 Ronald was appointed &quot;maestro al piano&quot; (accompanist and &quot;répétiteur&quot;) at the Royal Opera House; this was valuable experience, bringing him into contact with leading singers and with the scores of the opera repertoire. In her memoirs, Nellie Melba told how Ronald coached her in &quot;Manon&quot;, playing the accompaniment from memory, having learned the piece from scratch overnight. The following year he became conductor of Augustus Harris&#x27;s touring opera company. In 1894, he toured the United States as accompanist for Melba. He composed piano music and songs, some of which were well received. He first conducted at Covent Garden in July 1896, for a production of &quot;Faust&quot;, starring Melba, Charles Bonnard and Pol Plançon. In August 1897 he married Mimi Ettlinger (1873–1932), daughter of a Frankfurt cloth merchant; they had one son.

Operatic and concert work was in short supply for young English conductors at the time; Ronald was obliged to seek employment in musical comedy in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Among those for whom he conducted and composed were Harry Graham, Lionel Brough, Kate Cutler, Evie Greene and John Le Hay. Neither this employment nor his engagement from 1898 as conductor of the Winter Gardens concerts in Blackpool helped his professional advancement in the snobbish atmosphere of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; England.

Ronald continued to compose serious music; a song-cycle, &quot;Summertime&quot;, was written for the tenor Ben Davies, who premiered it in 1901. The music critic of &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; called the songs &quot;melodious&quot;, but added that they &quot;impressed by their graceful lyrical character rather than by evidence of any inventive fancy.&quot;

In 1900 Ronald was approached by Fred Gaisberg of the recording firm the Gramophone Company, a predecessor of EMI. He accepted the post of musical adviser, and was the pianist on many of the company&#x27;s early song recordings. Gaisberg calculated that Ronald&#x27;s varied musical contacts would help the new company recruit the distinguished performers it needed. Ronald helped the company to sign up Melba and other leading singers including Adelina Patti, Charles Santley and Enrico Caruso. He remained closely connected with HMV for the rest of his career, becoming a director in 1930 and a founder-director of Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) formed by the merger of HMV with its rival, the Columbia Graphophone Company in 1931.

In 1901 Ronald was conductor of London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall concerts and in the same year he was contracted by Blackpool&#x27;s Winter Gardens as conductor of summer Sunday concerts until where Adelina Patti, Nellie Melba and Caruso performed. He held this position until the First World War. Ronald began to make progress as a conductor after the foundation of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) in 1904. He was a frequent guest conductor of the LSO, and in 1905 he was appointed director of the Birmingham Promenade Concerts. When Thomas Beecham parted company from the New Symphony Orchestra in 1908, Ronald succeeded him as its conductor. The orchestra was later known as the Royal Albert Hall orchestra; Ronald remained with it until 1928, when it disbanded. He and the orchestra began recording for HMV in 1909. Their recorded repertoire comprised mostly overtures and short orchestral pieces, mainly by Tchaikovsky and Wagner, but also longer works including the &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; Suite and Schubert&#x27;s Unfinished Symphony. Ronald also worked with the Scottish Orchestra, and in continental European countries.

Landon Ronald conducted over four hundred times at the Royal Albert Hall, London between 1898 and 1936, mainly with the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra. His last performance at the Hall was on 4 February 1936 for the &#x27;Memorial Concert in Commemoration of His Late Most Gracious Majesty King George V&#x27;, where he conducted and played the piano.

Ronald was also closely associated with the music of Elgar. In later life he recalled Parry&#x27;s &quot;smacking me on the back and saying &#x27;I heard yesterday Richter perform the &quot;Enigma&quot; Variations by a Mr. Elgar, which is the finest thing I have listened to for years. Look out for this man&#x27;s music&#x27;.&quot; He was the pianist in the first performance of Elgar&#x27;s Violin Sonata in E minor in 1919, with W H Reed the violinist, and was the dedicatee of &quot;Falstaff&quot;, a work regarded by some as Elgar&#x27;s masterpiece, though Ronald admitted privately, &quot;Never could make head or tail of the piece&quot;. He recorded little of Elgar&#x27;s music, because HMV signed the composer up to record his own works; Ronald recorded the &quot;Coronation March&quot; in March 1935, a year after Elgar&#x27;s death.

As a conductor Ronald was especially noted as a concerto accompanist; the critic Robert Elkin described Arthur Nikisch as &quot;the finest accompanist until Landon Ronald&quot;. His repertoire was limited. Unlike Adrian Boult he did not feel it his duty to present difficult modern works. Elgar and Richard Strauss were the only contemporary composers with whose music he was much associated. He retired from conducting in 1929.

===Later years===

In 1910 Ronald succeeded W H Cummings as principal of the Guildhall School of Music, a post he held until 1938. He overhauled the curriculum and the administration of the school. According to his biographer, Raymond Holden, &quot;By modernizing teaching methods, and increasing the morale of those working and studying at the institution, he raised the status of the school.&quot; He also formed a professors&#x27; club to bring a more collegiate spirit into the school. Under Ronald the standard of teaching was brought into line with that of the Royal Academy of Music and the Royal College of Music. In his later years he laid great emphasis on the importance of live music, and worried that broadcasting and the gramophone were making music so ubiquitous and casually accessible that it was no longer special.

Among Ronald&#x27;s output as a composer are more than 200 songs. They include &quot;Serenade espagnole&quot; recorded by Caruso. The critic Michael Kennedy writes, &quot;His compositions include a symphonic poem, an overture, a ballet, &quot;Britannia&#x27;s Realm&quot;, composed for the coronation of Edward VII in 1902, and incidental music to Robert Hichens’s &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; (1921, Drury Lane), but it is his song &quot;Down in the Forest&quot; that has survived.&quot;

Ronald was knighted in 1922, and published a volume of memoirs, &quot;Variations on a Personal Theme&quot; in the same year. He published a second volume, &quot;Myself and Others&quot;, in 1931. Landon was also the editor of the first edition of &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Music&quot; in 1935. In 1932 Ronald&#x27;s wife died by suicide; he married Mary Callison b. 1895, (Aunt of Lady Bridget Faulks, née Bodley b.1921), of Manchester shortly afterwards.

Ronald died in London at the age of 65 after two years of declining health.

<text>Eustace of Fauconberg was a medieval English Bishop of London from 1221 to 1228 and was also Lord High Treasurer.

==Biography==
Eustace was the son of Walter de Fauconberg of Rise-in-Holderness in the East Riding of the English county of Yorkshire.

Eustace was selected as treasurer in 1217, probably on 4 November, and held the office until his death. He held the prebend of Holbourn in the diocese of London before being elected to the see of London on 26 February 1221 and consecrated on 25 April 1221.

Eustace died between 24 and 31 October 1228. There was a tomb memorial to him in the quire at Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

<doc id="1185945" wikidata="Q5067905" url="?curid=1185945" title="Chain Reaction (game show)">
<text>Chain Reaction is an American television game show created by Bob Stewart, in which players compete to form chains composed of two-word phrases.

The show has been revived four times. Bill Cullen hosted the original series on NBC from January 14, 1980 to June 20, 1980. The second version aired on the USA Network from September 29, 1986 to December 27, 1991, and was hosted first by Blake Emmons and later by Geoff Edwards (who also subbed for Cullen for two weeks on the NBC version). A third version aired on Game Show Network from August 1, 2006 to June 9, 2007, hosted by Dylan Lane. A fourth version also on GSN was announced on January 26, 2015, with Vincent Rubino as executive producer and hosted by Mike Catherwood. Forty episodes were ordered for Catherwood&#x27;s version, which aired from July 16, 2015 to January 29, 2016. The most recent version, also on GSN, was announced in November 2020, with Mike Richards as executive producer, Ed Egan as showrunner and Lane returning as host, it aired from February 22, 2021 to June 20, 2022.

==Overview==
The game is centered around solving a word-chain puzzle. In 1980, the chain comprised eight words. From 1986 to 2016, it comprised seven words, and in 2021, it comprised six words for the first three rounds and seven in the fourth. The words in the chain are linguistically or logically connected, with both the word at the top and the word at the bottom revealed at the outset.

By making inferences based on the revealed words and the revealed letters in incomplete words, contestants try to fill in the word chains to score points (dollars on Game Show Network). From 1980 to 1991, the team/player that reached the point goal first won the game. Since 2006, the team with the highest money total after the fourth round wins the game, a team can also win the game if at any time their opponents&#x27; money total is reduced to zero during the fourth round. Except from 1990 to 1991, the winning team/player then played the bonus round, which would vary depending on the series.

==NBC==
The first version of the show aired for 23 weeks from January 14 to June 20, 1980, on NBC and was hosted by Bill Cullen, except for two weeks when Geoff Edwards hosted while Cullen was filling in for Allen Ludden on &quot;Password Plus&quot;. (At that time, Edwards was also hosting Barry-Enright&#x27;s &quot;Play the Percentages&quot;). The announcer was Johnny Gilbert. It aired at 12:00 noon ET/11:00 AM CT/MT/PT, facing out CBS&#x27; &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; for the first three weeks, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot;, however, many affiliates aired local news at that timeslot, preempting &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;. The show was one of three game shows, the others being &quot;High Rollers&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, which were canceled in June 1980 to make room for the 90-minute talk show &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;.

Repeats of this version aired for several years on cable, first on CBN Cable from March 29, 1982, to May 4, 1984, then later on the USA Network from September 30, 1985, to the debut of the new version that originated in Canada. GSN aired reruns of this version from October 1997 to April 1998.

===Main game===
Two teams of three competed in each game. A team consisted of one contestant and two celebrity guests. The teams were shown the beginning and ending words of an eight-word chain. Each word is related to the word above it and below it, the connection could be either a word association or a phrase. A sample chain could be:

TWIST&lt;br&gt;ANKLE&lt;br&gt;BRACELET&lt;br&gt;CHAIN&lt;br&gt;GANG&lt;br&gt;WAR&lt;br&gt;STRATEGY&lt;br&gt;CHESS

The challenging team began the game. In the event, two new players were competing, a coin toss determined which team went first. Usually, the challengers were the blue team and the champions were the gold team.

As the game continued, the words would be revealed one letter at a time. A player&#x27;s turn consisted of calling for a letter in the next word above or below one of the already revealed words and then guessing the word (note that the last letter of each word is not revealed). A correct response won one point for each letter in the word (two if the word had a &#x27;+&#x27; mark next to it) and that team kept control of the board. If the player in control was incorrect or gave no guess, control went back to the other team. The game continued until either one team scored 50 points, or the chain was finished. If that happened, another chain was put up and the game continued until one team reached the goal of 50 points, any letters exceeding 50 points are not included in the player&#x27;s score. That team&#x27;s contestant won the game, $250 (later dropped when the final version of the bonus round was introduced) and the right to play for $10,000 in the bonus round. The losing player received $5 a point for playing (changed to parting gifts with the third bonus round).

===Instant Reaction===
In the bonus round, the two celebrities from the winning team attempted to get the contestant to guess a series of words or phrases by constructing a question one word at a time. The celebrities alternated giving words to construct the question, then hit a bell signaling the contestant to respond. Cash was awarded to the contestant for every correct response.

In the first format (which only lasted the first week of the series), the team was staked with $1 and had a 60-second time limit. Each correct response added one half of a zero behind the $1, meaning that after two correct responses, the player would win $10, after four the player would win $100, and so on up to the $10,000 maximum.

For the next four weeks, the time limit was increased to 90 seconds, and the first correct response was worth $1, with the next three each adding a zero behind it. At that point, the contestant&#x27;s winnings would be $1,000 and the next four correct responses each added $1,000 to their total. The ninth overall correct response augmented their total to $10,000.

The third format had the same time limit, but each of the first nine correct responses was now worth $100, and the tenth correct response increased the contestant&#x27;s winnings to $10,000. After two weeks, the format was slightly modified so that the contestant was staked with $100 at the start of the round, thus reducing the number of correct answers needed for a $10,000 win to nine.

If at any point a contestant provided an incorrect response, a celebrity gave two words in succession, accidentally gave part of the answer, or passed on the word, the word was removed from play and gameplay continued to the next word.

Champions remained on the show until they were defeated or until they won ten matches.

Stewart later developed and expanded the bonus round of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; into the game show &quot;Go&quot;.

&quot;Instant Reaction&quot; would later be revived as the bonus round on the first Dylan Lane-hosted version of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;.

==USA/Global==

The second version of &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; premiered in 1986, airing on the Global Television Network in Canada and the USA Network in the United States. Blake Emmons hosted the show for a few weeks before being replaced by Geoff Edwards (although USA started the season by airing several weeks of Edwards episodes, then showing Emmons&#x27; reign, Edwards has had experience having hosted two weeks of the NBC version, subbing for then-regular host Bill Cullen). Rod Charlebois served as co-host/announcer, who presented the &quot;home game&quot; for the viewing audience (Emmons presented the home game by himself during his time as host). Charlebois was a local radio and television personality at CFCF radio and CFCF-TV in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where the USA version was taped. Charlebois was given an on-air role for most of the show&#x27;s run, due to Cancon laws which required American shows taping in Canada to feature at least one Canadian personality on-air. Global aired reruns of this version through the mid-1990s, while GSN aired reruns for a brief period in late 1997.

Reruns of neither this version nor the NBC version have aired since the premiere of Dylan Lane&#x27;s first version in 2006.

===Main game===
Each chain comprised seven words. The teams were reduced to two civilian players each and each was given one responsibility. One teammate was the letter giver and decided whether to give a letter to his or her partner or the other team&#x27;s word guesser. As before, a correct response was worth points and control of the board. In round one, each word guessed was worth 10 points, but the final word guessed in that chain was worth 20 (changed to 15 in season two). In round two, these values escalated to 20 points each and 40 points for the final word. If a fourth chain was needed to decide the game, the point values were 40 points per word and 80 for the final word. The first team to score 200 points won the game. That team played the bonus game and returned to the next show.

During the run, two methods of earning bonus money were used. In the first season, the middle word of the second chain was also a bonus word (designated first by an asterisk, then by a dollar sign) worth $250 for the team that guessed it. For seasons two to four, the players played a Missing Link. The team in the lead would be shown the first and last words of a three-word chain. If they could guess the word in between with no letters revealed, the team received $500. Every wrong guess added a letter while taking away $100 from the potential payoff.

For seasons three and four, only solo players participated and a score of 300 won the game. The players now had to decide whether to take a letter for themselves or give one to their opponent.

Champions remained on the show until they were defeated or held their title for five consecutive days. During the first season, any team that retired undefeated received a $5,000 bonus.

===Bonus chain===
The winning team/player could collect a cash jackpot by completing one last word chain. The team/player was shown the first word in a chain and the initial letter of the other words. One at a time, the player(s) would guess at the next word in the chain. For each wrong guess, the next letter would be filled in and a letter deducted from their account. If the team could finish the chain before running out of letters the team won the cash jackpot. If not, they (or he/she) won $100 per word, including the one at the top. The jackpot began at $3,000 ($2,000 with the solo players) and $1,000 was added each day it was not claimed. The highest pot was $16,000. While Emmons was host the account was nine letters. When Geoff Edwards took over it was lowered to seven. During season one, if there was extra time afterward, another bonus round was played, this time worth $1,000 for the team&#x27;s favorite charity.

The bonus chain was removed in season five because the end of season four had an elimination tournament of champions, where the sixteen top winners of seasons three and four returned in a tournament format (sixteen players reduced to eight, then down to four, and then down to two). The winner of the final game won $20,000 and the runner-up won $2,000. Games were all played to 500 points.

===&quot;The $40,000 Chain Reaction&quot;===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1990, the show was revamped with a tournament format featuring 128 players competing for $40,000. The game was played as before, but there was no bonus chain and two new players competed in each show. The values for each chain remained the same, but if a fifth chain was needed, the point values were 50 points per word and 100 for the final word. In the event of a game ending with only four chains played, co-host Charlebois would play the fifth chain against the day&#x27;s winner.

Eight players competed on the first four shows. After four days, those four winners played two each for the next two days. Those two winners played on the seventh day and the winner of that game won $7,500.

The player who led after the second chain got to play a Missing Link for $300. The Missing Link changed its format as well. After the change, the first letter of the middle word was given, the first letter was worth $300 and subsequent letters reduced the value by $100.

After sixteen $7,500 tournaments were played, those 16 players played in a single-elimination tournament. The semi-finals were double-elimination and the two players remaining played one game for $40,000.

===Home game===
Each day, before closing the show, Charlebois would present the answer to yesterday&#x27;s home game and the current game. The home game consisted of a Missing Link (see above) and was actually referred to as such during the first season, but later renamed simply &quot;the home game&quot; when this format was adapted as the new round two mini-bonus in the second season. The home game first started while Emmons was still hosting, during which time he presented the home game alone and encouraged viewers to write the chains down on a piece of paper. Charlebois didn&#x27;t start coming onto the stage to present the home game until Edwards took over the hosting duties, per the aforementioned Cancon regulations.

==GSN==
A new version of the show debuted on August 1, 2006, on GSN. This version was hosted by Dylan Lane and produced by Michael Davies&#x27; production company Embassy Row. Seasons one and two were taped at the Sony Music Studios in New York City. GSN began airing the second season on March 13, 2007 and ended on June 9, 2007.

Each team consisted of three people of the same gender (except for one week in which the teams consisted of three teachers against three students from the same school). The bonus round was simply a revival of the original bonus round from 1980.

A second GSN version was commissioned in January 2015, with the new 40-episode season featuring Vincent Rubino as executive producer and Mike Catherwood of the nationally syndicated &quot;Loveline&quot; radio program as the host. It debuted on July 16, 2015. This version is the same as the previous version, minus the Speed Chains, and with two contestants on each team, the bonus round is nearly identical to the Edwards/Emmons version.

A third GSN version was ordered in November 2020, premiering on February 22, 2021, with Mike Richards as executive producer, Ed Egan as showrunner, and Lane returning as host. Teams are back to three contestants each, and the Speed Chains from the first GSN version have been brought back. The bonus round is a timed variation of the main game where the winning team has 60 seconds to complete three chains. The set resurrects the blue and gold color scheme of the NBC version.

===Main game===
There are four chains in the main game (not counting the Speed Chains). The gameplay is similar to the NBC and USA/Global versions, except that the words in the chain are now always two-word phrases or compound words. In the first season of the 2006–2007 version, the final letter of a word would be revealed (though the fact that it was the final letter was not announced, and sometimes was not evident). At that point, if the team did not guess the word correctly, the word was revealed and neither team received the money. Since the second season of the 2006–2007 version, the last letter is not revealed (as in the 1980 and 1986–1991 versions), although a shuffling placeholder (or a blank space in Catherwood&#x27;s version) is shown in place of the last letter. If the word was not correctly guessed, the other team had a chance to either guess that word or choose a different space but did not receive another letter.

In round one, each correct word is worth $100; in round two, words are worth $200; and words in round three are worth $300. Whichever team was behind going into a round started the next round (in the event of a tie, the team who did not start the last chain started the next chain). In the first two GSN runs, all chains that were not Speed Chains were seven-word chains. In the 2021 version, the first three rounds are each played with a six-word chain.

In the fourth round, each team is required to wager between $100 and $500 of their bank before being given their letter. If correct, they win their bet and keep control, if not, the amount of the bet is deducted and they lose control (or lose the game if they wagered the entire bankroll). In the 2021 version, the fourth round is the only round played with a seven-word chain, with wagers between $100 and $500, except a team can now wager up to $1,000 once there is only one word left to be revealed in the chain.

A team can win the game if either they are ahead after the fourth round, or if at any time the other team&#x27;s bankroll is reduced to zero. In the event of a tie at the end of the fourth round, the Tiebreaker is played.

====Speed chain====
Except when Catherwood hosted, after each of the first three rounds, whichever team correctly identified the final word to complete the chain was allowed to complete a four-word Speed Chain with the first letter of the middle two words given. An example could be:

HALF&lt;br&gt;B_______ (BAKED)&lt;br&gt;A_______ (ALASKA)&lt;br&gt;PIPELINE

The team has seven seconds to confer and come up with the two words. If correct, they won the same value as a single correct word in the previous round ($100 to $300). If neither team completed the chain, neither team got to play the speed chain. The 2015 version eliminated the speed chains, except for the Tiebreaker. The speed chains after the first three rounds returned for the 2021 version. Going into the first commercial break in the 2021 version, a three-word chain with the middle word missing was shown for home viewers (as in the USA/Global version, when they were presented at the end of each episode), with the answer revealed coming out of the commercial break.

===Tiebreaker===
In the 2006 and 2015 versions, if the fourth round ended in a tie, the teams were given alternating Speed Chains in a &quot;sudden death&quot; format. If one team did not solve their Speed Chain, the other team needed to only solve their next Speed Chain to win the game. Both teams kept their money, and the losing team received unacknowledged parting gifts as well.

In the 2021 version, the Tiebreaker uses only one Speed Chain. The team that went first in the fourth round has the option to play the Speed Chain or pass it to the other team. The tiebreaking Speed Chain is played in the same manner as after each of the first three rounds of regulation play (including the seven-second conference). If the team playing the Speed Chain successfully solves the chain, that team wins the game. If not, the other team automatically wins.

===Bonus Round===
The winning team then advances to the bonus round, which was different for each version.

====2006 (&quot;Instant Reaction&quot; revival)====
For Lane&#x27;s first series, the bonus round was a revival of &quot;Instant Reaction&quot; from the NBC version. The first two members gave clues by building questions, alternating one word at a time. If either clue giver gave more than one word in a row, built a clue that was not loosely in the form of a question, or said part of the answer, the clue givers advanced to the next word. The third player could not see the answers but had to ring in to guess the answer to the question his/her partners were constructing. Once the guesser rang in, no more clues may be given on that word. Any team member could also pass as often as possible to remove the current word.

=====Season one=====
In the first season, the team was given 90 seconds to go through as many as 20 words. The player setup was the same as in 1980 except:
* The table was now much smaller.
* The team now stood at the table instead of sitting.
* All three members of the team now had their hands over the bell—now a standard call bell—at all times. (On the NBC version, the clue-giver that gave the last word to finish the question reached over and pressed a raised button in front of the guesser to ring the bell.)
* Because of the smaller table, the guesser was now blindfolded.

In the first 29 episodes, if a team got seven correct answers, they would double their money from the main game, if they got ten correct, the main game winnings were tripled. For the following 36 episodes, the requirements were reduced to only five and seven correct answers, respectively.

=====Season two=====
A new format was introduced for season two. The guesser sat in a chair with his/her back to the clue-givers and held a signaling button to ring in. When the guesser rang in, the clock stopped for up to three seconds while the guesser gave his/her answer. If the team guessed five correct answers in 60 seconds, they earned an additional $5,000. If not, they were given $100 for each correct answer.

====2015 (Superchain)====
In Catherwood&#x27;s bonus round, the winning team had 45 seconds to guess seven more words. To start, a keyword was given, and the seven words involved connected to that word. Then on each word, the first three letters were given one at a time. A correct answer moved on to the next word. The team could pass on a word if they were stuck and then must go back to it if there was time left on the clock. Guessing all seven words correctly won an additional $5,000.

====2021 (Three Final Chains)====
The 2021 version&#x27;s bonus round is a timed variation of the main game, in which the winning team must complete three final chains of four, five, and six words, in that order within 60 seconds. In turn, each player calls for a letter below the top word or above the bottom word, and then attempts to guess that word, control then passes to the next player, whether the guess is correct or not. The clock stops when each chain is completed. A team that completes all three chains (nine words total) in time wins an additional $10,000.

<doc id="1185947" wikidata="Q400005" url="?curid=1185947" title="Choke point">
<text>In military strategy, a choke point (or chokepoint), or sometimes bottleneck, is a geographical feature on land such as a valley, defile or bridge, or maritime passage through a critical waterway such as a strait, which an armed force is forced to pass through in order to reach its objective, sometimes on a substantially narrowed front and therefore greatly decreasing its combat effectiveness by making it harder to bring superior numbers to bear. A choke point can allow a numerically inferior defending force to use the terrain as a force multiplier to thwart or ambush a much larger opponent, as the attacker cannot advance any further without first securing passage through the choke point.

==Historical examples==

Some historical examples of the tactical use of choke points are King Leonidas I&#x27;s defense of the Pass of Thermopylae during an invasion led by Xerxes I of Persia; the Battle of Stamford Bridge in which Harold Godwinson defeated Harald Hardrada; William Wallace&#x27;s victory over the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge (Wallace had around 2,300 men against the English army of about 9,000 to 12,000 men and the bridge collapsed during the battle); and the Battle of Agincourt in which Henry V of England decisively defeated the French using a small army (consisting mainly of lightly equipped longbowmen) when the much larger force of French heavy cavalry were forced to charge at the Englishmen through a narrow muddy gap in the Azincourt Woods.

The many archipelagos of the Caribbean offered several maritime choke points that attracted pirates and buccaneers during the height of their activities in the 17th and early 18th century. The Spanish treasure fleets leaving the Americas would have to pass through those waters to pick up the strong, prevailing westerly winds that would take them back to Spain across the North Atlantic.

Some choke points, with important locations in parentheses:
* Strait of Hormuz passage from the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean (Oman and Iran)
* Bab-el-Mandeb passage from the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea (Yemen, Djibouti and Eritrea)
* Strait of Malacca and the Singapore Strait between Malaysia and Sumatra (Indonesia)
* Turkish straits linking the Black Sea (and oil coming from the Caspian Sea region) to the Mediterranean Sea (Turkey)
** Bosphorus
** Sea of Marmara
** Dardanelles
* Suez Canal connecting the Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea (Egypt)
* Straits of Tiran connecting the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea (Egypt and Saudi Arabia)
* Khyber Pass between Afghanistan and Pakistan
* Strait of Gibraltar along the Atlantic Ocean entering the Mediterranean Sea (Spain, Gibraltar and Morocco)
* Strait of Dover and the English Channel separating the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea (United Kingdom, Crown Dependencies and France)
* Sea of Åland connecting the Gulf of Bothnia and the Baltic Sea (Finland and Sweden)
* Waterbodies connecting the Baltic Sea and the North Sea:
** Danish straits (Denmark and Sweden)
** Kattegat and Skagerrak (Norway, Denmark and Sweden)
** Kiel Canal (Germany)
* Waterbodies connecting the Pacific and Atlantic oceans including:
** Panama Canal (Panama)
** Strait of Magellan (Chile and Argentina)
** Beagle Channel (Chile and Argentina)
** Drake Passage
* Bering Strait (United States of America and Russia)
* Strait of Tartary along Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk (Russia)
* Suwałki Gap
* Belfort Gap
* Focșani Gate
The Fulda Gap was seen as one of the potentially decisive bottleneck battlegrounds of the Cold War in Germany.

===Royal Navy choke points===

From the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the sheer size of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy meant it had control over much of the world&#x27;s oceans and seas. Choke points were of huge importance to the British Empire, which often used them to control trade in British colonies and, to a lesser extent, for defense. Choke points have also been a source of tension, notably during the Suez Crisis. The Royal Navy still deems its choke points as strategically vital. Indeed, the importance of choke points was first recognised by British Admiral John Fisher.

These are major British choke points today:
* The English Channel
* GIUK gap (between Greenland, Iceland, and UK)
* Strait of Gibraltar

The choke points still have significant strategic importance for the Royal Navy. The GIUK gap is particularly important to the Royal Navy, as any attempt by northern European forces to break into the open Atlantic would have to do so through the heavily defended English Channel, which is also the world&#x27;s busiest shipping lane, or through one of the exits on either side of Iceland. Considering British control over the strategic fortress of Gibraltar at the entrance to the Mediterranean, Spain (northern coast), France (Atlantic coast) and Portugal are the only mainland European nations that have direct access to the Atlantic Ocean in a way that cannot be easily blocked at a choke point by the Royal Navy. The GIUK gap was also a strategically important part of the Cold War, as the Royal Navy were given the responsibility of keeping an eye on Soviet submarines trying to break into the open Atlantic.

==Importance==
Choke points remain a prominent issue today in the global economy and shipments of goods, particularly oil: 20% of the world&#x27;s oil is shipped through the Strait of Hormuz. In 2018, 20.7 million barrels per day were transported through the strait. The choke point has undergone continuous unrest since the 1980s. This includes, the downing of Iran Air Flight 655 by an American surface-to-air missile in 1988, the collision between nuclear submarine USS &quot;Newport News&quot; and crude tanker &quot;Mogamigawa&quot; in 2007, U.S.–Iranian naval dispute in 2008 and 2011–2012, seizure of MV &quot;Maersk Tigris&quot; in 2015 and threats of a strait closure in 2018 and 2019 made by the Islamic Republic of Iran. Most recently, in April 2020, statements from Iran&#x27;s military shows its readiness to defend its territorial integrity.

The Suez Canal and the Sumed pipeline carry a day, and the canal carried a total of 7.5% of world trade in 2011. The canal was closed for eight years after the Six-Day War in 1967. In many instances, alternate routes are nonexistent or impractical. For example, an alternate to the Suez/Sumed route required an additional around Cape of Good Hope. The Royal Navy also still deems its choke points to the Atlantic as strategically important.

=== Threats to the Strait of Hormuz ===
The Strait of Hormuz, connecting the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea, is one of the world&#x27;s most strategically important maritime choke points. The Islamic Republic of Iran is one of the largest security threats in the Strait of Hormuz and remains an essential factor in global energy security, due to the high volume of oil and natural gas passing through the narrow openings on a daily basis. The sovereignty of The Islamic Republic of Iran extends, beyond its land territory, internal waters and its islands in the Persian Gulf, to the Strait of Hormuz and the Oman Sea. Iran has used its sovereignty to threaten to close down the Strait of Hormuz multiple times, due to sanctions imposed on the country. This poses serious threats to the global oil market, with the Strait of Hormuz as a key location. Iran&#x27;s capabilities are found in the country&#x27;s anti-access/area denial capabilities including small attack craft equipped with machine guns, multiple-launch rockets, anti-ship missiles and torpedoes. Naval mining has also been used as a strategy to threaten the security of the Strait of Hormuz. Lastly, the many naval exercises and unconventional methods used by the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy, is a display of capability and shows readiness to take action in the choke point. The strategic value of maritime choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz means that the threats to the choke point influence sharp rises in oil prices. The several attacks which have occurred over the last decade against oil facilities and tankers in or near the Strait of Hormuz, has had a large impact on the oil industry. From the perspective of security studies, Iran is an important player in the international oil economy.

<text>Crestwood is a neighborhood in Yonkers, New York. Located in northeastern Yonkers, Crestwood is separated by the Bronx River from the village of Tuckahoe. Because the majority of Crestwood is served by the Tuckahoe post office, many residents identify their location as Tuckahoe or Crestwood, rather than Yonkers. Closer to the Crestwood train station, several grand homes occupy the hilly ground overlooking the river.

The Bronx River serves as the city line between several Westchester communities, dividing the city of Yonkers from the Town of Eastchester, which contains the villages of Tuckahoe and Bronxville.

==Transportation==
The construction of the Bronx River Parkway had a profound effect on the geography of the Crestwood/Tuckahoe area. When construction began in 1917, the road designers had designed the parkway to &quot;conveniently accommodate the large amount of traffic expected and to display to the traveler the principal interesting features without despoiling it&quot;. The Parkway was completed in 1925 and had far-reaching sociological consequences. As part of the right-of-way purchases, lots belonging to Crestwood were bought and cross roads were divided into two. Travelers northbound on the Parkway, after exit 5 to Crestwood, can see the earlier pattern of cross-streets extending from the left-hand side of the roadway across to the right-hand side. A newer off-ramp on the northbound side now leads into what was a roadway that had to be removed to facilitate the construction of the parkway.

The Harlem Line of the Metro-North commuter railroad runs along the Bronx River and has two stops in the Village of Tuckahoe. Since both stations could not be named Tuckahoe, the southern station by the village hall is named Tuckahoe for the area east of the station, and the northern station Crestwood for the Crestwood neighborhood to the west, in Yonkers. This train station was depicted on the cover of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; issue for November 16, 1946, in the painting &quot;Commuters&quot;, by Norman Rockwell.

==Education and Religious Institutions ==
Since 1962 Crestwood has been home to Saint Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary. The seminary purchased the former Adrian Iselin estate from the Sisters of Charity, and relocated its classes and offices from Manhattan. Crestwood is also home to the Roman Catholic Church of the Annunciation and its affiliated Annunciation School. The Annunciation Elementary School is a Catholic elementary school that begins with pre-school and continues up to the eighth grade.

Paideia School 15, part of the Yonkers Public Schools system, is also located in the neighborhood.

<doc id="1185949" wikidata="Q7186686" url="?curid=1185949" title="Phoebe Snow (album)">
<text>Phoebe Snow is the debut album by American roots music singer-songwriter Phoebe Snow, released in 1974. It contains her Top 5 &quot;Billboard&quot; hit, &quot;Poetry Man&quot;, and opens with her cover of Sam Cooke&#x27;s R&amp;B hit &quot;Good Times&quot;.

==Background==
Sessions were held in Los Angeles, Nashville and in Tulsa to find the right approach for the album. &quot;She’d play with whoever was around and we’d record and analyze the recordings, try and work out what was ideal for each song, which approach to take,&quot; said Shelter president Denny Cordell. &quot;I think she found that rather a long and painful study, but it obviously had its rewards.&quot; After the album&#x27;s release, legal battles took place between Snow and Shelter Records. Snow eventually signed with Columbia Records. It would be two years before her next release on Columbia.

==Reception==

In a retrospective review for Allmusic, critic Alex Henderson called Snow &quot;a pearl of a singer who never caught on because she simply didn&#x27;t fit neatly into any one category... With as many risks as she takes, the album is generally quite accessible.&quot; Robert Christgau called the album &quot;This woman&#x27;s languorous, swaying folk-jazz fusion is striking enough to suggest that her debut LP will become some sort of cult item. And it&#x27;s better than most cult items... The plus is for encouragement, and for the graceful way her voice combines nasality and smoothness.&quot;

<doc id="1185963" wikidata="Q1625351" url="?curid=1185963" title="Holy Spirit Movement">
<text>The Holy Spirit Movement (HSM) was a Ugandan religiously syncretic Christian militant rebel organization centered upon its founder, self-declared spirit medium and prophetess Alice Lakwena (Auma). Alice, an ethnic Acholi, was purportedly directed to form the HSM by Lakwena, one of her spirits, in August 1986. The movement grew to adopt a military wing and waged a major but short-lived rebellion as part of the insurgency (1986–1994). It may have inspired Joseph Kony to begin his Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army.

Technically, the Holy Spirit Movement was the political wing of Alice&#x27;s organization and the Holy Spirit Mobile Force (HSMF) was the military wing, but there was no real separation of functions and the titles were used interchangeably.

==Growth==

Following the collapse of Tito Okello&#x27;s Uganda National Liberation Army (UNLA), several soldiers left to create a separatist guerilla movement headed by Odong Latek, the Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army. This army fought for Acholi supremacy over regions historically belonging to the ethnic group.

In 1986, Holy Spirit Movement founder Alice Lakwena (at the age of 27) and her supporters were given weapons by former UNLA officers. She thus began commanding her own troops, which she called the Holy Spirit Battalion, one of four rebel groups seeking to gain control over the Gulu and Kitgum districts of Uganda. The Holy Spirit Battalion and the UPDA held a steady alliance until the Battle of Corner Kilak yielded a more contentious relationship. After an independent UPDA attack on Gulu on 20 April 1987, UPDA soldiers grew fearful of the Holy Spirit Battalion, leading to many defecting and joining Lakwena.

Independently in April 1987, another &#x27;spiritual medium&#x27;, Joseph Kony, held a Holy Spirit Army of his own, consisting of over 5,000 men, including defectors from the UPDA&#x27;s Black Battalion. While Kony and his Holy Spirit Army was not affiliated with Lakwena and her Holy Spirit Battalion, the former was joined by Lakwena&#x27;s father, Severino Lukwoya.

Lakwena launched an offensive in Southern Uganda in August 1987, as her numbers grew stronger and stronger. Lakwena was known to recruit disillusioned professional soldiers from the UDPA, and coerce young men from local villages to join her by killing their family members. After fighting a fairly successful campaign in Uganda, Lakwena and 118 followers crossed the Kenyan border, and were arrested as illegal immigrants, on 26 December 1987.

After Lakwena&#x27;s arrest and detention in Kenya, several former rebels again took up arms and formed what was known as &#x27;Lakwena Part Two&#x27;. &#x27;Lakwena Part Two&#x27; was less of a unified rebel movement, and more broadly encompassed different rebel groups that operated under a spiritual medium. These mediums never engaged in physical combat, but were instead more influential in strategizing and creating the belief system of their armies.

==Beliefs==

Alice Lakwena felt she was connected to the spiritual world, and could become possessed by spirits.

Alice was a spiritual medium and healer in her town of Gulu, which was a common role for women to hold. However, Alice claimed to be a &quot;nebi&quot;, which is the Swahili word for &#x27;prophet&#x27; instead of &quot;ajwaka&quot;, the Swahili word for a normal medium. Alice followed Catholicism, but it is widely unknown if she converted because her spirits instructed her to, or if she converted before becoming &#x27;possessed&#x27;.

Alice claimed to become possessed by spirits in either January or May 1985. According to reports, she grew numb and disappeared into the bush, where she claims she spent 40 days and 40 nights living off of the wilderness. She also claimed to be possessed by several ghosts, including a North Korean, Miriam, and Medina. Her &#x27;chief spirit&#x27; was the one that communicated God&#x27;s word directly to her. The &#x27;chief spirit&#x27; was an Italian man who had died by drowning in the Nile at the age of 95; he was called &#x27;Lakwena&#x27; which means &#x27;the messenger&#x27; in the Acholi language.

Her main reason for violent war efforts was to &#x27;purify the aggrieved Northern Acholi people&#x27;. Lakwena was repeatedly cited as telling Alice to cleanse tribes of their sins, and to eradicate &quot;bad people&quot;, both within her ranks and outside of them. The men that fought for her were fully convinced they were fighting for God and proper judgement, not against an enemy. As such, she convinced her followers to take up arms against the National Resistance Army (NRA) under Yoweri Museveni and restore Acholi purity and supremacy. This goal slowly began to become more universal as time progressed, with Alice modifying her goals for Acholi purity to aim more for total African and global purity.

Rules for Alice&#x27;s Holy Spirit Battalion (called Holy Spirit Safety Precautions) were biblical in format and unusual in content. Things such as sexual intercourse, alcohol consumption, tobacco usage, and certain foods were prohibited. It was also prohibited for followers to be angry, to eat food cooked in a saucepan, to have more or less than two testicles, to eat with people not anointed with oils, and to kill snakes. Oftentimes, soldiers would receive odd instructions, like reciting mantra-like phrases on the front lines before proceeding into battle, and sprinkling themselves with water before drinking after a battle. After being recruited as a follower, Alice would cleanse a person of their past sins, by placing her hands on their head. This signified her role as a spiritual elder of sorts.

In terms of weaponry, Alice Lakwena convinced her soldier followers that she gave them special weaponry that was enhanced by spiritual powers. For example, she told soldiers that rocks she gave them would turn into grenades when thrown, and if they drank water that had been blessed, then they would be immune to gunfire, as any bullets that they came into contact with would immediately turn into water. Alice also created charms and potions with snake-bone and beeswax that followers were told would turn into swarms of animals and insects when thrown at enemy troops.

The media (western and local) played a role in reporting about Alice&#x27;s Holy Spirit Movement. This caused her to create a branch of the movement called the Department of Information and Publicity. This bureaucratic organization worked to create a softer image of the brutal practices of the HSM. Alice and Lakwena also gave an interview in October 1987 to try to clear the air about their motives and goals in fighting.

<text>James Black Groome (April 4, 1838 – October 5, 1893), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 36th Governor of Maryland in the United States from 1874 to 1876. He was also a member of the United States Senate, representing Maryland, from 1879 to 1885.

==Early life and career==
James Black Groome was born on April 4, 1838, in Elkton, Maryland, to Elizabeth Riddle (née Black) and John Charles Groome. His father was a Maryland gubernatorial candidate and Maryland secretary of state. His grandfather John Groome was a Maryland state delegate. His maternal grandfather James R. Black of New Castle, Delaware, was a Delaware Supreme Court judge. He attended Elkton Academy. He completed preparatory studies in the Tennent School of Hartsville, Pennsylvania, with hopes of attending Princeton University. However, an injury to his eye caused him to leave school. Groome instead studied law with his father and was admitted to the bar in Elkton in 1861. Due to his ill health, Groome did not serve during the American Civil War.

In 1867, Groome was a strong voice in favor of a new constitution for the state of Maryland, and served as a representative from Cecil County, Maryland to the state constitutional convention that same year. He was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates from 1872 to 1876. At one point in 1872, Groome was considered as a candidate for the U.S. Senate by the House of Delegates. In 1874, Groome served as chairman of the judiciary committee in the House of Delegates.

==Governor of Maryland and Senator==
In 1874, the House of Delegates elected Governor William Pinkney Whyte to the U.S. Senate, leaving the governor&#x27;s seat vacant. Groome was by far the most popular candidate in the special election that was held in the House of Delegates, and was elected governor at the age of 35, receiving 62 of the 70 votes cast. As governor, Groome&#x27;s administration was rather unspectacular, as many of the necessary appointments had been made by his predecessor before his resignation. Groome even commented that he felt he had no other tasks besides attending banquets and awarding prizes and diplomas. Groome did make several recommendations to the legislature during his tenure, however, including the implementation of glass ballot boxes in elections to reduce fraud, and a full re-assessment of value and property of the state.

During the gubernatorial renomination process, Groome realized his chances of being re-elected were slim, mostly due to a serious argument he was involved in prior to the nomination convention. He withdrew his candidacy, and placed support with John Lee Carroll, who would win the election. Groome resumed the practice of law for a short while afterward his withdrawal, until he was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate, serving from March 4, 1879 to March 3, 1885. He served alongside Arthur P. Gorman and his gubernatorial predecessor William Pinkney Whyte.

==Personal life and later years==
Groome married Alice L. Edmondson, daughter of Horace Edmondson of Talbot County on February 29, 1876. They had one daughter, Maria. In 1877, during a political canvass, a carriage accident Groome was in ruptured his heart valve. He was later diagnosed with diabetes and had an abdominal tumor.

After serving in the Senate, Groome was appointed by President Grover Cleveland as collector of customs for the port of Baltimore, Maryland, serving from February 17, 1886, to around 1890. He died following a kidney colic at his home at 2 East Preston Street in Baltimore on October 5, 1893. Groome is interred in Elkton Presbyterian Cemetery of Elkton, Maryland. A &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; editorial commented, after his death, &quot;few men have compassed so much in so short a time and without arousing animosities.&quot; Furthermore, Groome&#x27;s local paper commented that he &quot;was everybody’s friend ... The humblest could approach him without a sense of restraint, but none were so mighty as to feel disposed to trifle with him&quot;.

<text>Second Childhood is the second album by the singer and songwriter Phoebe Snow, released in 1976. &quot;Second Childhood&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA on July 9, 1976.

==Reception==
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic William Ruhlmann called the album &quot;a classy job on which Snow contributed seven originals and displayed her versatility on covers ranging from Motown to Gershwin.&quot; Robert Christgau wrote of the album: &quot;I&#x27;m pleased to report that her trademark melismatic quaver hasn&#x27;t degenerated into a gimmick, and I acknowledge that this is a good record of its type. I just have my doubts about how good a jazz-folk mood-music record can be.&quot;

<text>Alberto Pincherle (; 28 November 1907 – 26 September 1990), known by his pseudonym Alberto Moravia ( , ), was an Italian novelist and journalist. His novels explored matters of modern sexuality, social alienation and existentialism. Moravia is best known for his debut novel &quot;Gli indifferenti&quot; (&quot;The Time of Indifference&quot; 1929) and for the anti-fascist novel &quot;Il conformista&quot; (&quot;The Conformist&quot; 1947), the basis for the film &quot;The Conformist&quot; (1970) directed by Bernardo Bertolucci. Other novels of his adapted for the cinema are &quot;Agostino&quot;, filmed with the same title by Mauro Bolognini in 1962; &quot;Il disprezzo&quot; (&quot;A Ghost at Noon&quot; or &quot;Contempt&quot;), filmed by Jean-Luc Godard as &quot;Le Mépris&quot; (&quot;Contempt&quot; 1963); &quot;La noia&quot; (&quot;Boredom&quot;), filmed with that title by Damiano Damiani in 1963 and released in the US as &quot;The Empty Canvas&quot; in 1964 and &quot;La ciociara&quot;, filmed by Vittorio De Sica as &quot;Two Women&quot; (1960). Cédric Kahn&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Ennui&quot; (1998) is another version of &quot;La noia&quot;.

Moravia once remarked that the most important facts of his life had been his illness, a tubercular infection of the bones that confined him to a bed for five years and Fascism because they both caused him to suffer and do things he otherwise would not have done. &quot;It is what we are forced to do that forms our character, not what we do of our own free will.&quot; Moravia was an atheist. His writing was marked by its factual, cold, precise style, often depicting the malaise of the &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;. It was rooted in the tradition of nineteenth-century narrative, underpinned by high social and cultural awareness. Moravia believed that writers must, if they were to represent reality, ‘a more absolute and complete reality than reality itself’, &quot;assume a moral position, a clearly conceived political, social, and philosophical attitude&quot; but also that, ultimately, &quot;A writer survives in spite of his beliefs&quot;. Between 1959 and 1962 Moravia was president of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Alberto Pincherle was born in Via Sgambati in Rome, Italy, to a wealthy middle-class family. His chosen pen name &quot;Moravia&quot; equals to Moravia, which is one of historic Czech lands, and was linked to his paternal grandmother. His Jewish Venetian father, Carlo, was an architect and a painter. His Catholic Anconitan mother, Teresa Iginia de Marsanich, was of Dalmatian origin. His family had interesting twists and developed a complex cultural and political character. The brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli, founders of the anti-fascist resistance movement Giustizia e Libertà, murdered in France by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s order in 1937, were paternal cousins and his maternal uncle, Augusto De Marsanich, was an undersecretary in the National Fascist Party cabinet.

Moravia did not finish conventional schooling because, at the age of nine, he contracted tuberculosis of the bone, which confined him to bed for five years. He spent three years at home and two in a sanatorium near Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, in north-eastern Italy. Moravia was an intelligent boy, and devoted himself to reading books and some of his favourite authors were Giosuè Carducci, Giovanni Boccaccio, Fyodor Dostoevsky, James Joyce, Ludovico Ariosto, Carlo Goldoni, William Shakespeare, Molière, Nikolai Gogol and Stéphane Mallarmé. He learned French and German and wrote poems in French and Italian.

In 1925 at the age of 18, he left the sanatorium and moved to Bressanone. During the next three years, partly in Bressanone and partly in Rome, he began to write his first novel, &quot;Gli indifferenti&quot; (&quot;Time of Indifference&quot;), published in 1929. The novel is a realistic analysis of the moral decadence of a middle-class mother and two of her children. In 1927, Moravia met Corrado Alvaro and Massimo Bontempelli and started his career as a journalist with the magazine &quot;900&quot;. The journal published his first short stories, including &quot;Cortigiana stanca&quot; (&quot;The Tired Courtesan&quot; in French as &quot;Lassitude de courtisane&quot;, 1927), &quot;Delitto al circolo del tennis&quot; (&quot;Crime at the Tennis Club&quot;, 1928), &quot;Il ladro curioso&quot; (&quot;The Curious Thief&quot;) and &quot;Apparizione&quot; (&quot;Apparition&quot;, both 1929).

===&quot;Gli indifferenti&quot; and Fascist ostracism===
&quot;Gli indifferenti&quot; was published at his own expense, costing 5,000 Italian lira. Literary critics described the novel as a noteworthy example of contemporary Italian narrative fiction. The next year, Moravia started collaborating with the newspaper &quot;La Stampa&quot;, then edited by author Curzio Malaparte. In 1933, together with Mario Pannunzio, he founded the literary review magazines &quot;Caratteri&quot; (&quot;Characters&quot;) and &quot;Oggi&quot; (&quot;Today&quot;) and started writing for the newspaper &quot;Gazzetta del Popolo&quot;. The years leading to World War II were difficult for Moravia as an author; the Fascist regime prohibited reviews of &quot;Le ambizioni sbagliate&quot; (1935), seized his novel &quot;La mascherata&quot; (&quot;Masquerade&quot;, 1941) and banned &quot;Agostino&quot; (&quot;Two Adolescents&quot;, 1941). In 1935 he travelled to the United States to give a lecture series on Italian literature. &quot;L&#x27;imbroglio&quot; (&quot;The Cheat&quot;) was published by Bompiani in 1937. To avoid Fascist censorship, Moravia wrote mainly in the surrealist and allegoric styles; among the works is &quot;Il sogno del pigro&quot; (&quot;The Dream of the Lazy&quot;). The Fascist seizure of the second edition of &quot;La mascherata&quot; in 1941, forced him to write under a pseudonym. That same year, he married the novelist Elsa Morante, whom he had met in 1936. They lived in Capri, where he wrote &quot;Agostino&quot;. After the Armistice of 8 September 1943, Moravia and Morante took refuge in Fondi, on the border of province of Frosinone, a region to which fascism had arbitrarily imposed the name &quot;ciociaria&quot;; the experience inspired &quot;La ciociara&quot; (&quot;The ciociara Woman&quot;, 1957).

===Return to Rome and national popularity===

In May 1944, after the liberation of Rome, Alberto Moravia returned. He began collaborating with Corrado Alvaro, writing for important newspapers such as &quot;Il Mondo&quot; and &quot;Il Corriere della Sera&quot;, the latter publishing his writing until his death. After the war, his popularity steadily increased, with works such as &quot;La Romana&quot; (&quot;The Woman of Rome&quot;, 1947), &quot;La Disubbidienza&quot; (&quot;Disobedience&quot;, 1948), &quot;L&#x27;amore coniugale e altri racconti&quot; (&quot;Conjugal Love and other stories&quot;, 1949) and &quot;Il conformista&quot; (&quot;The Conformist&quot;, 1951). In 1952 he won the Premio Strega for &quot;I Racconti&quot; and his novels began to be translated abroad and &quot;La Provinciale&quot; was adapted to film by Mario Soldati; in 1954 Luigi Zampa directed &quot;La Romana&quot; and in 1955 Gianni Franciolini directed &quot;I Racconti Romani&quot; (&quot;The Roman Stories&quot;, 1954) a short collection that won the Marzotto Award. In 1953, Moravia founded the literary magazine &quot;Nuovi Argomenti&quot; (&quot;New Arguments&quot;), which featured Pier Paolo Pasolini among its editors. In the 1950s, he wrote prefaces to works such as Belli&#x27;s &quot;100 Sonnets&quot;, Brancati&#x27;s &quot;Paolo il Caldo&quot; and Stendhal&#x27;s &quot;Roman Walks&quot;. From 1957, he also reviewed and criticised cinema for the weekly magazines &quot;L&#x27;Europeo&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;. His criticism is collected in the volume &quot;Al Cinema&quot; (&quot;At the Cinema&quot;, 1975).

===&quot;La noia&quot; and later life===

In 1960, Moravia published &quot;La noia&quot; (&quot;Boredom&quot; or &quot;The Empty Canvas&quot;), the story of the troubled sexual relationship between a young, rich painter striving to find sense in his life and an easygoing girl in Rome. It became one of his most famous novels, and won the Viareggio Prize. An adaptation was filmed by Damiano Damiani in 1962. Another adaptation of the book is the basis of Cédric Kahn&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Ennui&quot; (1998). Several films were based on his other novels: in 1960, Vittorio De Sica adapted &quot;La ciociara&quot; (&quot;Two Women&quot;), starring Sophia Loren; in 1963, Jean-Luc Godard filmed &quot;Il disprezzo&quot; (&quot;Contempt&quot;); and in 1964, Francesco Maselli filmed &quot;Gli indifferenti&quot; (&quot;Time of Indifference&quot;). In 1962, Moravia and Elsa Morante parted, despite never divorcing. He went to live with the young writer Dacia Maraini and concentrated on theatre. In 1966, he, Maraini and Enzo Siciliano founded &quot;Il porcospino&quot;, which staged works by Moravia, Maraini, Carlo Emilio Gadda and others.

In 1967 Moravia visited China, Japan and Korea. In 1971 he published the novel &quot;Io e lui&quot; (&quot;I and He&quot; or &quot;The Two of Us&quot;) about a screenwriter, his independent penis and the situations to which he thrusts them and the essay &quot;Poesia e romanzo&quot; (&quot;Poetry and Novel&quot;). In 1972 he went to Africa, which inspired his work &quot;A quale tribù appartieni?&quot; (&quot;Which Tribe Do You Belong To?&quot;), published in the same year. His 1982 trip to Japan, including a visit to Hiroshima, inspired a series of articles for &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot; magazine about the atomic bomb. The same theme is in the novel &quot;L&#x27;uomo che guarda&quot; (&quot;The Man Who Looks&quot;, 1985) and the essay &quot;L&#x27;inverno nucleare&quot; (&quot;The Nuclear Winter&quot;), including interviews with some contemporary principal scientists and politicians.

The short story collection, &quot;La Cosa e altri racconti&quot; (&quot;The Thing and Other Stories&quot;), was dedicated to Carmen Llera, his new companion (forty-five years his junior), whom he married in 1986, after Morante&#x27;s death in November 1985. In 1984, Moravia was elected to the European Parliament as a member of the Italian Communist Party. His experiences at Strasbourg, which ended in 1988, are recounted in &quot;Il diario europeo&quot; (&quot;The European Diary&quot;). In 1985 he won the title of European Personality. Moravia was a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, having been nominated 13 times between 1949 and 1965. In September 1990, Alberto Moravia was found dead in the bathroom of his Lungotevere apartment, in Rome. In that year, Bompiani published his autobiography, &quot;Vita di Moravia&quot; (&quot;Life of Moravia&quot;).

== Themes and literary style ==
Moral aridity, the hypocrisy of contemporary life and the inability of people to find happiness in traditional ways such as love and marriage are the regnant themes in the works of Alberto Moravia. Usually, these conditions are pathologically typical of middle-class life; marriage is the target of works such as &quot;Disobedience&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;amore coniugale&quot; (&quot;Conjugal Love&quot;, 1947). Alienation is the theme in works such as &quot;Il disprezzo&quot; (&quot;Contempt&quot; or &quot;A Ghost at Noon&quot;, 1954) and &quot;La noia&quot; (&quot;The Empty Canvas&quot;) from the 1950s, despite observation from a rational-realistic perspective. Political themes are often present; an example is &quot;La Romana&quot; (&quot;The Woman of Rome&quot;, 1947), the story of a prostitute entangled with the Fascist regime and with a network of conspirators. The extreme sexual realism in &quot;La noia&quot; (&quot;The Empty Canvas&quot;, 1960) introduced the psychologically experimental works of the 1970s.

Moravia&#x27;s writing style was highly regarded for being extremely stark and unadorned, characterised by elementary, common words in an elaborate syntax. A complex mood is established by mixing a proposition constituting the description of a single psychological observation mixed with another such proposition. In the later novels, the inner monologue is prominent.

<doc id="1185995" wikidata="Q885556" url="?curid=1185995" title="William Pinkney Whyte">
<text>William Pinkney Whyte (August 9, 1824March 17, 1908), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was a politician who served the State of Maryland as a State Delegate, the State Comptroller, a United States Senator, the 35th Governor, the Mayor of Baltimore, Maryland, and the State Attorney General.

==Early life and education==
Whyte was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Joseph and Isabella White (he later changed his surname to Whyte following a family disagreement). His paternal grandfather was the physician and exiled United Irishman, John Campbell White. His maternal grandfather, William Pinkney, had been a famous United States politician, administrator, and diplomat.

Whyte&#x27;s early education involved instruction by a private tutor, who had been personal secretary to Napoleon Bonaparte. From 1842 to 1844, Whyte was unable to attend college as a result of his family&#x27;s poor financial situation, and began work at the banking firm of Peabody, Riggs and Co. in Baltimore. He began to study law in Baltimore at the law office of Brown and Brune for one year before being admitted to the law school of Harvard University in 1844. Whyte returned to Baltimore in 1845 for further study, and was admitted to the Bar soon after in 1846.

==Political career==
From 1847 to 1849, Whyte served one term as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates. In 1850, Whyte was unsuccessful in a bid for election to the 32nd Congress. From 1853 to 1855, he served one term as Comptroller of the State Treasury of Maryland, for which he was credited for introducing a more simplified financial system to the State.

In 1857, Whyte was again nominated to serve in Congress. He was defeated, but brought forth evidence before the House of Representatives of fraud and corruption regarding the election. The House did not concur on whether or not he should have been appointed, however.

After nearly a decade out of the political arena, Whyte was asked by then-governor Thomas Swann to fill the remainder of resigning senator Reverdy Johnson&#x27;s term from July 13, 1868, to March 3, 1869. During his short tenure as senator, Whyte steadfastly supported the embattled President Andrew Johnson, and also supported easing the tension on the Southern states during Reconstruction. He chose not to be a candidate for re-election in 1868, however.

In 1872, Whyte was elected Governor of Maryland, defeating Republican challenger Jacob Tome. In the election of 1874, Whyte was elected by the legislature as a Democrat to the United States Senate and accordingly resigned from the position of governor. In 1874, in between his terms as governor and senator, he served as counsel for Maryland before the arbitration board in the boundary dispute between Virginia and Maryland. During this tenure as senator, Whyte opposed paying the nation&#x27;s debt with silver and gold instead of solely gold, and served as the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Printing (46th Congress). In the election of 1880, Whyte chose not to run for re-election, due to family illness.

Whyte was elected unopposed to be mayor of Baltimore in 1881. At the conclusion of his term in 1883, Whyte chose to go back to practicing law. From 1887 to 1891, Whyte was Attorney General of Maryland, and from 1900 to 1903, the Baltimore City Solicitor. In 1906, Whyte was appointed by Maryland Governor Edwin Warfield to fill the Senate seat vacancy caused by the death of Arthur P. Gorman. At 25 years, 3 months, 5 days since his last day in the chamber, Whyte&#x27;s return set the all-time mark for the longest gap in service to the U.S. Senate.

Whyte served as senator until his unexpected death in Baltimore, and is buried in Greenmount Cemetery.

<doc id="1185996" wikidata="Q375030" url="?curid=1185996" title="Perfect Strangers (album)">
<text>Perfect Strangers is the eleventh studio album by English rock band Deep Purple, released on 29 October 1984. It was the most successful album recorded by the re-formed &#x27;Mark II&#x27; line-up.

It was the first Deep Purple studio album in nine years. &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; is also the first album with the Mk II line-up in eleven years, the last being &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; (1973). Its nine-year gap from &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot; (1975) marks the longest between two studio albums from the band to date. Ritchie Blackmore and Roger Glover arrived from Rainbow, Ian Gillan from Black Sabbath, Jon Lord from Whitesnake, and Ian Paice from Gary Moore&#x27;s backing band. Just one song in the reformed Deep Purple’s new repertoire, &quot;Nobody’s Home&quot;, would be credited to all five band members. Gillan and Glover attempted to return matters to the all-for-one composition credits of the Mk II lineup&#x27;s 1970–73 recordings, but Blackmore held firm. It was not until Blackmore permanently left the group in 1993 that the issue was finally resolved.

The CD and cassette versions of the album contained the extra track &quot;Not Responsible&quot; (which contains the lyric &quot;I&#x27;ve got no ticket, but I&#x27;m gonna take a fucking ride&quot;, making it one of the few Deep Purple tracks to feature profanity). The album was remastered and reissued on 22 June 1999 with the bonus instrumental track &quot;Son of Alerik&quot;. The latter had previously been available as a B-side on the single &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; in 1984.

The album was a commercial success, reaching #5 in the UK charts and #17 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; in the US. &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; was only the third Deep Purple studio album to be certified platinum in the United States, following &quot;Machine Head&quot; (1972) &amp; Burn. The tour was so successful that the band had to book many additional dates to the U.S. arena tour, as tickets sold out very quickly. Their U.S. tour in 1985 out-grossed every artist that year except Bruce Springsteen.

==Reception==

The album received mixed reviews. Deborah Frost of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in a contemporary review remarked that, with the exception of the two singles, &quot;The material consists of hastily knocked-off jams&quot; and wondered if the release was just made &quot;to cash in on the current heavy-metal craze.&quot; But she also stated, &quot;Blackmore&#x27;s Strat has such a great roar that you&#x27;re willing to just let it reverberate in your eardrums for a bit. And it&#x27;s nice to hear Jon Lord&#x27;s unsynthesized organ squalls, Ian Paice&#x27;s electrifying drumming, Ian Gillan&#x27;s howls and whispers and Roger Glover&#x27;s solid bass lines once again,&quot; although, &quot;Instead of Glover, an outside producer might have forced the band to tighten up its licks and arrangements.&quot;

Canadian journalist Martin Popoff praised this comeback album which &quot;only nods to the &#x27;70s&quot; and concentrates &quot;on songcraft rather than technical display,&quot; placing Deep Purple as &quot;a reference point of a genre in metal without categorization.&quot;

&quot;A great moment in time,&quot; suggested Glover, &quot;but, as an album, it doesn&#x27;t quite hang together.&quot; The rest of the band all maintained positive feelings towards the album in subsequent years.

==Track listing==
All songs by Ritchie Blackmore, Roger Glover and Ian Gillan except where noted.

&quot;Son of Alerik&quot; had appeared in an edited form on the 7&quot; B-side of the &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; single, or in full on the 12&quot; &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; single and the European version of the compilation &quot;Knocking at Your Back Door: The Best of Deep Purple in the 80&#x27;s&quot;.

<text>Beaconsfield (Boonwurrung: &quot;Kemgrim&quot;) is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Shire of Cardinia and City of Casey local government areas. Beaconsfield recorded a population of 7,267 at the 2021 census.

The suburb has its own railway station.

==History==

The area was named after Benjamin Disraeli (Lord Beaconsfield).

Beaconsfield Post Office opened 1889 on Woods Street. It became the Beaconsfield Post Office in 1916 and was used for many years as a café, but was demolished in late October 2021.

The earlier Beaconsfield Railway Station Post Office opened on 1 January 1883.

In 1891 an area of Beaconsfield was renamed &quot;Beaconsfield Upper&quot; and around 1902 the Beaconsfield Railway Station was renamed to &quot;Beaconsfield&quot;.

==Facilities==

The suburb has some small shopping centres such as &quot;Beaconsfield Shopping Plaza&quot; with shops such as an Aldi, Woolworths, bakeries, a post office, chemist, cafés and takeaway food shops, and the nearby &quot;Beaconsfield Hub&quot;. Schools include Beaconsfield Primary, and St Francis Xavier College (Beaconsfield Campus). There are many cafés, restaurants and hairdressers around the commercial shopping area.

<doc id="1186026" wikidata="Q1760248" url="?curid=1186026" title="Heart of the Alien">
<text>Heart of the Alien is a cinematic platform game developed by Interplay Productions and was released by Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1994 for the Sega CD exclusively in North America. It is a sequel to &quot;Another World&quot; and continues the story directly from where the original ended. The game switches the player&#x27;s role from &quot;Another World&quot;; this time the player takes control of Buddy, the main character&#x27;s alien ally from the previous game.

==Gameplay==
The game&#x27;s control scheme is largely similar to that of its predecessor &quot;Another World&quot;, though there are several new elements related to the character&#x27;s powerful energized whip. For example, Buddy can swing from stalactites or similar objects and his shields are deployed instantly, unlike Lester&#x27;s, which take a few seconds to charge. As in &quot;Another World&quot;, there is no heads-up display.

==Plot==
The story picks up immediately after the end of &quot;Another World&quot;. Buddy lands the flying creature in the ruins of his village, lays Lester down on a cot to rest and walks through the village, thinking of his past. A flashback follows showing that Buddy&#x27;s people were captured by soldiers led by one of the alien humanoids with red eyes. After recovering his power whip Buddy returns to the prison he and Lester escaped from in the first game trying to save his people.

Buddy and Lester overcome various obstacles, but later in the game Buddy is knocked unconscious, and Lester saves him by attacking an enemy alien but is electrocuted while doing so. Eventually Buddy is able to find the red-eyed alien and traps him in a cage with a beast that kills him. At the end of the game, Buddy gives Lester&#x27;s body a ceremonial cremation. It is shown later how Buddy&#x27;s village is rebuilt with its citizens living again in harmony.

==Development==
Eric Chahi recalled: &quot;Interplay insisted in making the sequel in order to make the most of the CD-ROM medium&#x27;s capabilities. After discussion, I agreed. Rather than making a chronological development related to the first story, I decided that redesigning the game from the alien point of view was excellent, and would make the player discover &quot;Another World&quot; with other eyes. I could already picture scenes where Lester would be in the background fighting guards, while the player would control the alien in the foreground and then join our first hero, help him, etc... The concept was good but, alas, neither the animations nor the game, entirely developed by Interplay, were up to the job. It was a flop.&quot; Reportedly, &quot;quickly after it was released, Chahi made a public statement that the title did not represent his vision of the world he crafted and disowned it altogether from being treated as an official sequel.&quot;

==Legacy==
After &quot;Heart of the Alien&quot; became unsupported and unavailable, a fan took up the effort of extracting a source code variant from the binary game by reverse engineering to make the game runnable again on modern platforms. This extracted source code was made open-source and is hosted freely available on SourceForge. An Amiga version has since been released that uses the assets of the Sega CD original.

==Reception==

&quot;GamePro&quot; hailed the game as even better than the original &quot;Out of This World&quot;, praising its sharply animated cutscenes, ingenious level design, evocative soundtrack, and the inclusion of the original game on the disc. They acknowledged that the controls are sometimes frustrating, but felt that practice and patience would inevitably overcome this issue. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; likewise found it to be a strong sequel despite the control difficulties. They commented that the graphics suit the game&#x27;s theme, the puzzle-like challenges are engaging, and the game&#x27;s cinematic sequences and animations are outstanding. Sebastian Sponsel of &quot;Sega-16&quot; gave the game an 8/10 rating and, while criticizing its relentless difficulty and controls, called the game an &quot;enjoyable experience [and] a true sequel to a classic&quot;.

<text>John Linwood Battelle (born November 4, 1965) is an entrepreneur, author and journalist. Best known for his work creating media properties, Battelle helped launch &quot;Wired&quot; in the 1990s and launched &quot;The Industry Standard &quot;during the dot-com boom. In 2005, he founded the online advertising network Federated Media Publishing. In January 2014, Battelle sold Federated Media Publishing&#x27;s direct sales business to LIN Media and relaunched the company&#x27;s programmatic advertising business from Lijit Networks to Sovrn Holdings. He later started NewCo Platform, an &quot;inside out&quot; events company that allowed attendees to visit &quot;new kinds of companies&quot; in more than a dozen cities around the world. In 2019, he co-founded The Recount, which was sold to The News Movement in 2023. 

Battelle is the chairman of Sovrn Holdings as well as board director at LiveRamp. He taught at Columbia SIPA from 2018 to 2022, and is currently a Professor of Practice at Northeastern.

==Career==

Born in Pasadena, California, Battelle studied at Chandler School, Polytechnic School and the University of California, Berkeley, earning a Bachelor of Arts in anthropology in 1987 and a master&#x27;s degree in journalism in 1992. He went on to become chairman and CEO of Standard Media International, which launched &quot;The Industry Standard&quot; and its website, TheStandard.com, and was a co-founding editor of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and its entrepreneurial arm, Wired Ventures.

Battelle was a visiting professor of journalism from 2001 to 2004 at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism where he chaired the Bloomberg Chair on Business Reporting and co-chaired the Magazine Publishing program. His projects included The Big Story, an online magazine examining how the media covers major events and China Digital Times, a bilingual news website aggregating news about China.

In 2003, Battelle and publisher Tim O&#x27;Reilly founded the Web 2.0 Conference, which was later renamed the Web 2.0 Summit. Battelle called &quot;this grandfather of Internet conferences&quot; among his &quot;proudest editorial works&quot;. During its lifetime, from 2004 to 2011, he was the conference&#x27;s executive producer and program chair, and, with O&#x27;Reilly, its co-moderator. He shut down the event after 2011.

In 2005, Battelle began focusing on how popular blogs could earn steady advertising revenue for their work. After testing his ideas with the BoingBoing technology blog, Battelle founded Federated Media Publishing, which sells advertising space in a network of online properties, keeping a percentage and giving the rest to the site owners. Battelle likened the company to a music label, &quot;except we don&#x27;t control their intellectual property and tell them what to sing&quot;. The following year, an Ad Age reporter wrote that some 85 high-profile blogs, including BoingBoing and Digg, had become affiliated with the company, &quot;giving up a slice of their ad dollars for the exposure to the bigger advertisers and better rates that a bit of scale gets them&quot;. In 2011, comScore ranked the company among the top 20 United States Web properties and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; named Federated one of the top 50 venture-funded companies.

Battelle sat on the board of the International Advertising Bureau and has become a spokesman for what he calls &quot;the Independent Web&quot;: blogs and other semi-professional websites beyond Facebook, Twitter, and Google. He has argued that marketers are themselves content creators, and their marketing campaigns should be rooted in &quot;their own domain, independent from any platform other than the Internet itself&quot;.

===Writings===
Battelle&#x27;s 2005 book, &quot;The Search: How Google and Its Rivals Rewrote the Rules of Business and Transformed Our Culture&quot;, described the history and impact of search engines and the late emergence of Google from a field of competitors. The book was an international best seller and finalist for the &quot;Financial Times&quot; and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award. The book has been translated into more than 25 languages.

Battelle maintains &quot;Searchblog,&quot; an ongoing daily site which covers the intersection of media, technology, and culture, with archives dating back to October 2003.

==Accolades==
Battelle was named a &quot;Global Leader for Tomorrow&quot; by the World Economic Forum, and was a finalist in Ernst &amp; Young&#x27;s Entrepreneur of the Year competition. &quot;Ad Age&quot; named him one of 10 best marketers in the business. In 2007, &quot;PC World&quot; listed Battelle as one of &quot;The Most Important People on The Web&quot;.

==Personal life==
In a brief biographical entry, Battelle summarized his personal life as: &quot;Father of three. Drums, mountain biking, yoga, drinking with friends, taking pictures, cursing at closed systems&quot;. He lives in New York City.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite the undisputed fact that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

<text>Oden Bowie (November 10, 1826December 4, 1894), a member of the United States Democratic Party, was the 34th governor of the State of Maryland in the United States from 1869 to 1872.

==Childhood==
He was born in 1826 at Fairview Plantation in Collington, Maryland, the oldest son of Colonel William Duckett Bowie and Eliza Mary Oden.

He spent the bulk of his childhood at Fairview where he was educated by a private tutor until his mother died when he was nine years old. After his mother&#x27;s death, he was sent to the preparatory department of St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland, where he studied for three years. At age twelve, he enrolled in St. Mary&#x27;s Seminary and University and graduated in July 1845 as valedictorian of his class.

==Career==

===Military ===
In 1846 Bowie enlisted in the U.S. Army as a private at the outbreak of the Mexican–American War. He was promoted through the ranks, cited with &quot;conspicuous bravery at Monterey&quot; by Captain Taylor and eventually promoted to the rank of Captain by President James K. Polk, serving in the Voltigeur Regiment. At the time he was the youngest Captain in the army.

===Politics===
In 1849, he was elected to his first political office, as a member of the Maryland House of Delegates, followed by the Maryland Senate from 1867 to 1869. On November 5, 1867, he became
the first governor of Maryland to be elected under the post-Civil War Maryland Constitution of 1867, and as such, he did not assume the office of governor until January 13, 1869. Bowie&#x27;s term of governor ended on January 10, 1872, ending his career in politics.

===Railroading===
Walter Bowie was a major advocate of expanding the railroad system into southern Maryland, and wrote articles lobbying for this under the pen name &quot;Patuxent Planter&quot;. After significant lobbying together with Thomas Fielder Bowie, William Duckett Bowie, and Oden Bowie, the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Company was organized. Two of the charter members were Walter Bowie and Thomas F Bowie. Directors included William Duckett Bowie and Oden. Oden became the first president of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad around 1853 and also president of the
Baltimore City Passenger Railway in 1873.

===Thoroughbred racing===
Oden Bowie was an avid horseman who served for nineteen years as President of the Pimlico Jockey Club, and as President of the Maryland Jockey Club. At Fairview Plantation he bred Thoroughbred racehorses. Among his successful runners, Crickmore was voted the retrospective American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 1880.

In 1868, at a dinner party in Saratoga Springs, New York, Bowie and associates agreed to hold a horse race in 1870 for the yearlings owned by attendees at the party. A wager was placed and the winner of the race would host the losers for dinner. Both Saratoga and the American Jockey Club made bids for the event, but Bowie pledged to build a grand racetrack in his home state if the race were to be run in Baltimore. The Dixie Stakes, (also known as the Dinner Party Stakes) and Pimlico Race Course were the results.

===Slavery===
Before the Civil War, Fairview had many slaves. Charles Branch Clark wrote in 1946 in the Maryland Historical Magazine that 70 of Bowie&#x27;s slaves enlisted in the Union Army.

==Family and private life==
Bowie spent most of his life at Fairview Plantation. He married Alice Carter on December 3, 1851. She was the daughter of Charles H. Carter and Rosalie Eugenia Calvert Carter of Goodwood, Prince George&#x27;s County. Alice&#x27;s mother was a descendant of George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore the first colonial proprietor of the Province of Maryland. His cousin was state delegate Reginald Bowie.

==Death==
Bowie died after a brief illness on December 4, 1894, and was buried at Fairview.

==Legacy==
*The city of Bowie, Maryland, was founded as Huntington in 1870 at a junction of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad. The town was renamed &quot;Bowie&quot; in the 1880s after Governor Oden Bowie.
*Odenton, Maryland, began as a junction of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad and the Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad, named after Oden Bowie in 1872.
*A 1,800-home subdivision, Fairwood, was built on the land of Oden Bowie&#x27;s thousand acre plantation, Fairview, in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. The Fairwood community, which was approximately 73% African American in 2015, was heavily impacted by the Subprime mortgage crisis of 2007–2008, despite its affluence. Bowie descendants lived in the large Federal-style plantation house until 2015.

This period spanned the years from February 1381 to February 1384. The emperors in Kyoto were and The Southern Court rivals in Yoshino during this time-frame were and .

==Nanboku-chō overview==
During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.

Until the end of the Edo period, the militarily superior pretender-Emperors supported by the Ashikaga shogunate had been mistakenly incorporated in Imperial chronologies despite widespread recognition that the Imperial Regalia were not in their possession.

This illegitimate had been established in Kyoto by Ashikaga Takauji.

==Change of era==

<text>Lake Waikare is the largest of several shallow lakes in the upper floodplain of the Waikato River in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It is a riverine lake, located to the east of Te Kauwhata and 40 kilometres north of Hamilton. It covers .

Due to its shallow nature (its depth is never more than two metres) and the heavy use of fertiliser in the surrounding farming district, the waters of the lake are in poor condition. A 2010 report showed that of all the measured lakes it had the highest trophic level index, a measurement of the amount of pollutants. Pollution also comes from Te Kauwhata sewage works, which is subject to a Regional Council abatement notice for excessive discharges of Kjeldahl Nitrogen, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus and &quot;E. coli&quot;. A health warning was issued in 2020 for cyanobacteria.

<doc id="1186041" wikidata="Q598405" url="?curid=1186041" title="Sympathomimetic drug">
<text>Sympathomimetic drugs (also known as adrenergic drugs and adrenergic amines) are stimulant compounds which mimic the effects of endogenous agonists of the sympathetic nervous system. Examples of sympathomimetic effects include increases in heart rate, force of cardiac contraction, and blood pressure. The primary endogenous agonists of the sympathetic nervous system are the catecholamines (i.e., epinephrine [adrenaline], norepinephrine [noradrenaline], and dopamine), which function as both neurotransmitters and hormones. Sympathomimetic drugs are used to treat cardiac arrest and low blood pressure, or even delay premature labor, among other things.

These drugs can act through several mechanisms, such as directly activating postsynaptic receptors, blocking breakdown and reuptake of certain neurotransmitters, or stimulating production and release of catecholamines.

==Mechanisms of action==
The mechanisms of sympathomimetic drugs can be direct-acting (direct interaction between drug and receptor), such as α-adrenergic agonists, β-adrenergic agonists, and dopaminergic agonists; or indirect-acting (interaction not between drug and receptor), such as MAOIs, COMT inhibitors, release stimulants, and reuptake inhibitors that increase the levels of endogenous catecholamines.

==Structure-activity relationship==
A primary or secondary aliphatic amine separated by 2 carbons from a substituted benzene ring is minimally required for high agonist activity. The pKa of the amine is approximately 8.5-10. The presence of hydroxy group in the benzene ring at 3rd and 4th position shows maximum alpha- and beta-adrenergic activity.

For maximum sympathomimetic activity, a drug must have:
# Amine group two carbons away from an aromatic group
# A hydroxyl group at the chiral beta position in the R-configuration
# Hydroxyl groups in the meta and para position of the aromatic ring to form a catechol which is essential for receptor binding
The structure can be modified to alter binding. If the amine is primary or secondary, it will have direct action, but if the amine is tertiary, it will have poor direct action. Also, if the amine has bulky substituents, then it will have greater beta adrenergic receptor activity, but if the substituent is not bulky, then it will favor the alpha adrenergic receptors.

===Direct-acting===

====Adrenergic receptor agonists====

Direct stimulation of the α- and β-adrenergic receptors can produce sympathomimetic effects. Salbutamol is a widely used direct-acting β2-agonist. Other examples include phenylephrine, isoproterenol, and dobutamine.

====Dopaminergic agonists====

Stimulation of the D1 receptor by dopaminergic agonists such as fenoldopam is used intravenously to treat hypertensive crisis.

===Indirect-acting===

Dopaminergic stimulants such as amphetamine, ephedrine, and propylhexedrine work by causing the release of dopamine and norepinephrine, along with (in some cases) blocking the reuptake of these neurotransmitters.

==Abuse potential==
Illegal drugs such as cocaine and MDMA also affect dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine.

Norepinephrine is synthesized by the body from the amino acid tyrosine, and is used in the synthesis of epinephrine, which is a stimulating neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. All sympathomimetic amines fall into the larger group of stimulants (see psychoactive drug chart). In addition to intended therapeutic use, many of these stimulants have abuse potential, can induce tolerance, and possibly physical dependence, although not by the same mechanism(s) as opioids or sedatives. The symptoms of physical withdrawal from stimulants can include fatigue, dysphoric mood, increased appetite, vivid or lucid dreams, hypersomnia or insomnia, increased movement or decreased movement, anxiety, and drug craving, as is apparent in the rebound withdrawal from certain substituted amphetamines.

Sympathomimetic drugs are sometimes involved in development of cerebral vasculitis and generalized polyarteritis nodosa like diseases involving immune-complex deposition. Known reports of such hypersensitivity reactions include the use of pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine, methamphetamine and other drugs at prescribed doses as well as at over-doses.

==Comparison==
&quot;Parasympatholytic&quot; and &quot;sympathomimetic&quot; have similar effects, but through completely different pathways. For example, both cause mydriasis, but parasympatholytics reduce accommodation (cycloplegia) while sympathomimetics do not.

<text>Dondurma is the Turkish name for ice cream. Outside Turkey, it typically refers specifically to mastic ice cream, which is believed to originate from the city and region of Kahramanmaraş and is known as maraş dondurma in Turkish. This is made from cream, salep (the ground-up tuber of an orchid), mastic (plant resin), and sugar.

==Description==
Two qualities distinguish Turkish ice cream: hard texture and resistance to melting, brought about by inclusion of the thickening agents salep, a flour made from the root of the early purple orchid, and mastic, a resin that imparts chewiness.

The Kahramanmaraş region is known for &quot;Maraş dondurması&quot;, a variety which contains distinctly more &quot;salep&quot; than usual. Tough and sticky, it is sometimes eaten with a knife and fork.

==Consumption and culture==

&quot;Dondurma&quot; is commonly sold from both street vendors&#x27; carts and store fronts, where the mixture is churned regularly with long-handled paddles to keep it workable. Vendors often perform magic tricks and practical jokes, with examples including presenting the ice cream cone on a long stick or pole, and then taking away the &quot;dondurma&quot; by rotating it around, or serving it with an extra cone that comes away from the actual cone when the stick is lifted. These tricks serve the additional purpose of attracting prospective customers, as well as entertaining people waiting in line.

As of 2010, the average rate of consumption in Turkey was 2.8 liters of ice cream per person per year (compared to the United States at 14.2 liters per person and world consumption leader Australia at 17.9 liters in 2010).

The popularity of &quot;salepli dondurma&quot; has caused a decline of wild orchids in the region and led to a ban on exports of &quot;salep&quot;.

Α distinct variation of &quot;dondurma&quot; is also consumed in Greece, especially in the north of the country, where it is called &quot;&quot;dudurmas&quot; or &quot;kaimaki&quot;&quot;.

<text>James Iredell Waddell (July 3, 1824 – March 15, 1886) was an officer in the United States Navy and later in the Confederate States Navy.

During the American Civil War, Waddell took command of the &quot;CSS Shenandoah&quot;, which he used to sail around the globe and launch raids against the U.S. Navy. It was not until August 1865 that he learned the war had ended. He eventually surrendered his vessel to British authorities in Liverpool on November 6, marking the last official surrender of the Civil War.

==Early life and career==
Waddell was born in Pittsboro, North Carolina. He joined the United States Navy as a Midshipman in September 1841, and later graduated from the United States Naval Academy. His nearly two decades in the U.S. Navy included early service in USS &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;, Mexican–American War operations off Veracruz aboard USS &quot;Somers&quot;, a tour off South America in USS &quot;Germantown&quot;, an assignment as a United States Naval Academy instructor, eastern Pacific duty in USS &quot;Saginaw&quot; and a cruise with the East Indies Squadron with USS &quot;John Adams&quot;. Lieutenant Waddell resigned his commission while returning home in the latter ship late in 1861 at the outbreak of the American Civil War and was dismissed from the U.S. Navy in January 1862.

==American Civil War==
In March 1862, Waddell was appointed a Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy. Sent to New Orleans, he was assigned to the incomplete ironclad CSS &quot;Mississippi&quot; until her destruction in late April. The next month, while serving as an artillery officer ashore, he participated in the battle between Confederate shore batteries and Federal ironclads at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff, Virginia. He saw more shore-battery service at Charleston, South Carolina, during the rest of 1862 and into 1863. Sent abroad in March 1863, First Lieutenant Waddell was stationed in England awaiting the availability of a seagoing position. 

That opportunity finally arrived in October 1864 at sea in the central Atlantic, where he converted the British steam/sailer &quot;Sea King&quot; to the Confederate cruiser CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. As her commanding officer, Commander Waddell made a long and productive cruise through the south Atlantic, across the Indian Ocean and into the north Pacific. In the Arctic waters there, he devastated the United States-flagged whaling fleet during June 1865.

On June 27, 1865, he learned from a prize, the &quot;Susan &amp; Abigail&quot;, that General Robert E. Lee had surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia. Her captain produced a San Francisco newspaper reporting the flight from Richmond, Virginia, of the Confederate Government 10 weeks previously. However, the newspaper also contained Confederate President Jefferson Davis&#x27;s proclamation that the &quot;war would be carried on with re-newed vigor&quot;. Waddell then captured 10 more whalers in the space of 7 hours just below the Arctic Circle.

On August 3, 1865, Waddell finally learned of the war&#x27;s end when he met at sea the Liverpool barque &quot;Barracouta&quot;, which was bound for San Francisco. He received the news of the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army on April 26, Kirby Smith&#x27;s army&#x27;s surrender on May 26, and crucially the capture of President Davis and a part of his cabinet. Captain Waddell then knew that the war was over.

Waddell lowered his Confederate flag, and the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; underwent physical alteration. Her guns were dismounted and stored below deck, and her hull was painted to look like an ordinary merchant vessel.

Captain Waddell presided over the last official lowering of the Confederate flag when he surrendered the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; to Captain Paynter of on November 6, 1865, in mid-river on the River Mersey at Liverpool. The banner was lowered in front of the crew and of a Royal Navy detachment who had boarded the vessel - this marked the last surrender of the American Civil War. The very last act of the Civil War involved Captain Waddell walking up the steps of Liverpool Town Hall with a letter to present to the Mayor of Liverpool surrendering his vessel to the British government.

==Later life==
Waddell did not return to the United States until 1870, when he became captain of the commercial steamer &quot;City of San Francisco&quot;. He later was in charge of the State of Maryland&#x27;s oyster regulation force.

He died at Annapolis, Maryland on March 15, 1886, and was buried at St. Anne&#x27;s Cemetery in Annapolis.

==Namesake==
The &quot;Charles F. Adams&quot;-class guided missile destroyer USS &quot;Waddell&quot; (DDG-24) was named for him.

<text>Alice Auma (1956 – 17 January 2007) was a Ugandan spirit-medium who, as the head of the Holy Spirit Movement (HSM), led a millennial rebellion against the Ugandan government forces of President Yoweri Museveni from August 1986 until November 1987. The primary spirit she purportedly channelled was that of a dead army officer called &quot;Lakwena&quot;, meaning messenger, which those from the Acholi ethnic group believe to be a manifestation of the Christian Holy Spirit. The combined persona of Alice Auma channelling the spirit Lakwena is often referred to as &quot;Alice Lakwena&quot;. Auma&#x27;s HSM was ultimately defeated in November 1987 by Ugandan forces led by Yoweri Museveni.

==Early life==
Alice Auma was born in 1956. She was the daughter of Severino Lukoya, self-proclaimed prophet and founder of the Jerusalem Melter Church in Gulu. Leader of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army Joseph Kony previously claimed that Auma and he were cousins, however, he merely did so in order to garner support from her constituents. Auma herself always distanced herself from Kony and his views.

==Biography==

Remaining childless after two marriages, Auma moved away from her hometown. She eventually converted to Christianity but, on 25 May 1985, she reportedly went insane, unable to either hear or speak, later claiming to have been possessed by the spirit Lakwena. Her father took her to eleven different witches, but none alleviated her condition. Auma claimed Lakwena then guided her to Murchison Falls National Park, where she disappeared for 40 days and returned a spirit-medium, a traditional ethnic religious role.

Before the defeat of Tito Okello in the Ugandan Bush War, Auma was one of many spirit-mediums working near the town of Gulu as a minor oracle and spiritual healer. She worked in the midst of the chaos of the anti-National Resistance Army (NRA) insurgency of the Uganda People&#x27;s Democratic Army and the increasingly brutal counter-insurgency operations and tactics of the NRA. Legend in the later movement holds that on 6 August 1986, Lakwena ordered Auma to stop her work as a diviner and healer, which was pointless in the midst of war, and create a Holy Spirit Movement (HSM) to fight evil and end the bloodshed. This divine mission required the retaking of the capital of Kampala. Thus the Acholi would redeem themselves from the violence they had collectively imposed on the civilians of the Luwero triangle, and would initiate a paradise on earth. A letter to local missionaries explained the transition:

The good Lord who had sent the Lakwena decided to change his work from that of a doctor to that of a military commander for one simple reason: it is useless to cure a man today only that he be killed the next. So it became an obligation on his part to stop the bloodshed before continuing his work as a doctor.

Auma claimed that Lakwena required that she be possessed by numerous other spirits to achieve its goals. This was unusual in Acholi spirit-behavior.

At this time, there was a perceived spiritual crisis in the area coinciding with the threat posed by soldiers from the NRA-led government. The increased level of societal tension and number of deaths were attributed to witchcraft. 

After a series of spectacular victories, Auma led the Holy Spirit Movement (HSM) south out of the Acholi heartland of northern Uganda towards Kampala. There, she garnered much support from other ethnic groups that had grievances with Yoweri Museveni&#x27;s government. However, subsequent military setbacks suffered by the HSM prompted some followers to accuse Auma of being a witch and of using spirits for destructive ends. As the HSM suffered its final defeat under artillery fire in the forests near Kampala, Auma fled and claimed that Lakwena had left her.

==Later life and death==
Auma lived in the Ifo refugee camp near Dadaab in northern Kenya for the remainder of her life, and claimed to have been abandoned by the spirits. 

In November 2004, she was implicated in child trafficking from Gulu to the refugee camp. In 2006, she claimed to have discovered a cure for HIV/AIDS. Auma died on 17 January 2007, after having been sick for about a week with an unknown illness claimed to be HIV/AIDS.

==The Tale of Paraa==

Although Auma&#x27;s practice as a medium immediately after returning to Gulu was not particularly successful, the tale of Paraa became the central text of the HSM. In particular Lakwena&#x27;s discourse that the insurgency was a rebellion of nature deserves explication. According to the story, Lakwena first held court with all the animals of the park to explore the theme of the ongoing war in the south and the destruction of the environment by warring parties:Lakwena said to the animals: &quot;You animals, God sent me to ask you whether you bear responsibility for the bloodshed in Uganda.&quot; The animals denied blame, and the buffalo displayed a wound on his leg, and the hippopotamus displayed a wound on his arm.

Lakwena then questioned the water about the war:Lakwena said to the waterfall: &quot;Water, I am coming to ask you about the sins and bloodshed in this world.&quot; And the water said: &quot;The people with two legs kill their brothers and throw their bodies into the water.&quot; The spirit asked the water what it did with the sinners, and the water said: &quot;I fight against the sinners, for they are the ones to blame for the bloodshed. Go and fight against the sinners, because they throw their brothers into the water.&quot;

After briefly returning home, Lakwena led Auma to Mount Kilak to deal with the issue of witchcraft. The mountain greeted their arrival with large explosions:The spirit Lakwena said to the mountain or to the rock: &quot;God has sent me to find out why there is theft in the world.&quot; The mountain answered: &quot;I have gone nowhere and have stolen no one&#x27;s children. But people come here to me and name the names of those whom I should kill [by casting spells]. Some ask me for medicine [to bewitch]. This is the sin of the people. I want to give you water to heal diseases. But you must fight against the sinners.&quot;

In the climax to the story, God himself specifies who is to blame for all of the suffering and bloodshed:God said that there was a tribe in Uganda that was hated everywhere. This tribe was the Acholi. And God ordered that a lamb be offered, so that they should repent their sins and to put an end to the bloodshed in Acholi.

== Critical reception ==
In her book &quot;Alice Lakwena and the Holy Spirits. War in Northern Uganda 1986–97,&quot; social anthropologist Heike Behrend analyzed the biography of Alice Lakwena and the history of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army in Uganda from anthropological perspectives.

<text>Clarence Shepard Day Jr. (November 18, 1874 – December 28, 1935) was an American author and cartoonist, best known for his 1935 work &quot;Life with Father&quot;.

==Early life and family background==
Day was born in New York City to Lavinia (née Stockwell) Day and stockbroker Clarence Shepard Day Sr. His father owned a Wall Street brokerage firm and was a banker, a railroad director, and Governor of the New York Stock Exchange. 

Clarence Sr.&#x27;s firm was established in 1854 and had offices at 21 and 40 Wall Street, next to Federal Hall, and was a member of the Metropolitan Club, Union League Club, American Yacht Club (New York), and New England Society of New York.

His grandfather Benjamin Day and great-uncle Moses Yale Beach were the founders in 1833 of the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. His uncle Benjamin Henry Day Jr. was the inventor of the Ben Day printing process.

Day attended St. Paul&#x27;s School and graduated from Yale University in 1896, where he edited the campus humor magazine &quot;The Yale Record&quot;. He became also a member of the Yale Club of New York.

==Career==
In 1897, Day joined the New York Stock Exchange, and became a partner in his father&#x27;s Wall Street brokerage firm. Day enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1898, but developed crippling arthritis and spent the remainder of his life as a semi-invalid. Upon mustering out of the Navy, he returned to his business career, but his illness forced him to retire in 1903 and seek to improve his health in Arizona and Colorado. He soon returned to New York City, however, and began publishing the &quot;Yale Alumni Weekly&quot; and contributing essays and drawings to various publications.

Day&#x27;s most famous work is the autobiographical &quot;Life with Father&quot; (1935), which detailed humorous episodes in his family&#x27;s life, centering on his domineering father, during the 1890s in New York City. Scenes from the book, along with its 1932 predecessor &quot;God and My Father&quot;, and its 1937 sequel &quot;Life with Mother&quot;, published posthumously, were the basis for the 1939 play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse, which became one of Broadway&#x27;s longest-running non-musical hits. In 1947—the year the play ended on Broadway—William Powell and Irene Dunne portrayed Day&#x27;s parents in the film of the same name, which received Oscar nominations for cinematography, art direction, musical score and best actor (Powell). It also became a popular television sitcom, airing from 1953 to 1955.

Day was a vocal proponent of giving women the right to vote, and contributed satirical cartoons for U.S. suffrage publications in the 1910s. According to James Moske, an archivist with the New York Public Library, who arranged and cataloged the library&#x27;s Clarence Day Papers, a survey of Day&#x27;s early short stories and magazine columns reveals &quot;he was fascinated by the changing roles of men and women in American society as Victorian conceptions of marriage, family, and domestic order unraveled in the first decades of the twentieth century.&quot;

A long-time contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Day sometimes wrote using the pseudonym B.H. Arkwright. Brendan Gill&#x27;s memoir &quot;Here at The New Yorker&quot; reprints a cartoon by Day originally published in that magazine. According to Gill, editor Harold Ross balked at publishing the drawing because it depicted a naked woman with one exposed breast. Day simply removed the nipple—retaining the breast with a broken line in the nipple&#x27;s place—and Ross published it.

Day&#x27;s &quot;In the Green Mountain Country&quot; recounted the 1933 death and funeral of U.S. president Calvin Coolidge. His essay collection &quot;The Crow&#x27;s Nest&quot; received a favorable review in &quot;The Nation&quot; by the prominent U.S. academician Carl Van Doren; a revised edition with new essays, poems and drawings was published after Day&#x27;s death under the title &quot;After All&quot;.

Day achieved lasting fame in literary circles for his comment &quot;The world of books is the most remarkable creation of man. Nothing else that he builds ever lasts. Monuments fall, nations perish, civilizations grow old and die out; and, after an era of darkness, new races build others. But in the world of books are volumes that have seen this happen again and again, and yet live on, still young, still as fresh as the day they were written, still telling men&#x27;s hearts of the hearts of men centuries dead.&quot; The quotation was used in the endpapers for &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Reader.&quot; 

The American Library Association honored individuals for outstanding work in encouraging the love of books and reading with the Clarence Day Award from 1959-1980. Honorees included Robert B. Downs, Mary Ann O&#x27;Brian Malkin, Dee Brown and Granville Hicks.

== Personal life ==
Day&#x27;s brother George Parmly Day (1876–1959) was the longtime treasurer of Yale University and co-founder, with Clarence, of the Yale University Press. His brother Julian Day (1878–1947) was a stockbroker and soldier who served in the British Army during World War I, serving at Gallipoli and Palestine. He rose to the rank of major in the Imperial Camel Corps, was wounded in battle in 1918 and received the Military Cross and Order of the Nile. He lived in London much of his life.

Day died in New York City of pneumonia shortly after the publication of &quot;Life with Father&quot;, after it became a best-seller but before its success on Broadway. He was survived by his wife Katherine Briggs Dodge Day and their daughter Wendy.

<doc id="1186080" wikidata="Q5460903" url="?curid=1186080" title="Florentine Opera">
<text>The Florentine Opera Company is one of Wisconsin&#x27;s oldest professional performing arts centers and the sixth-oldest opera company in the United States. The company presents three to five staged productions per season largely from the standard operatic repertoire. The fabulous larger than life Opera productions take place at the Marcus Center in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

==History==
The Florentine Opera was founded in 1933 by John-David Anello. At that time, the group was called the Italian Opera Chorus, and it met at the Jackson Street Social Center. In 1942, the group became The Florentine Opera Chorus, remaining under the direction of John D. Anello. He explained that the change in name &quot;was to honor the birthplace of opera as we know it. The craft originated in the Italian city of Florence, which has been known as a bustling center for the arts for many centuries.&quot; By this time, the chorus had grown to a group of 100 members of many nationalities, with a waiting list of over 100 more. In the program of the first &quot;Opera Album&quot; after the name change is written the Florentine Opera Chorus motto: &quot;If our song has stopped one heart from aching, we have not lived in vain.&quot;

In 1950, the Florentine Opera Chorus extended its efforts from operatic choral performances to the production of complete operas and the company became a private venture, changing its name one final time to the Florentine Opera Company.
Over the past decade, the Florentine Opera has premiered several new American operas. It produced the American premiere of Lowell Liebermann&#x27;s opera The Picture of Dorian Gray in 1999. In 2009, the Florentine presented Robert Aldridge and Herschel Garfein&#x27;s Elmer Gantry. A world premiere of Don Davis&#x27; Spanish language &quot;Río de Sangre&quot; opened in 2010. Another Aldridge opera, &quot;Sister Carrie&quot;, premiered in 2016.

<text>The Suez Company or Suez Canal Company, full initial name Compagnie universelle du canal maritime de Suez (Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez), sometimes colloquially referred to in French as  (&quot;The Suez&quot;), was a company formed by Ferdinand de Lesseps in 1858 to operate the Egyptian granted concession of the Suez Canal, which the company built between 1859 and 1869. Initially, French investors held half of the Company&#x27;s stock, with Egypt&#x27;s ruler Sa&#x27;id Pasha holding most of the balance. In 1875, financial distress forced Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s successor Isma&#x27;il Pasha to sell the country&#x27;s shares to the government of the United Kingdom. The Suez Company operated the canal until Egypt&#x27;s new president Gamal Abdel Nasser revoked its concession in 1956 and transferred canal operation to the state-owned Suez Canal Authority, precipitating the Suez Crisis. 

Following the loss of the canal concession, the Suez Company received financial compensation from the Egyptian government, the final payment of which was made in 1962, and used this resource to reinvent itself as a major investment and holding company in France. In 1958 it renamed itself the &#x27; (&quot;Suez Financial Company&quot;), and in 1967 changed its name again to &#x27;, a change that was reversed in 1972. It was nationalized in 1982, then privatized in 1987. It acquired control of the Société Générale de Belgique in 1988, and changed name again to  in 1990. In 1997, it merged with water utility and construction conglomerate to form Suez-Lyonnaise des eaux. The merged entity renamed itself as Suez in 2001 and underwent several subsequent mergers, spin-offs, and restructurings that led to the creation of the energy company Engie and the water and waste-management utility also named Suez.

==Background==
===Original canal concession (1854)===
The original concession assembled by Lesseps and granted by Said in 1854 included the following stipulations: 10 percent of the annual profits were reserved for the founders, 15 percent of the annual profits were reserved for the Government of Egypt, and 75 percent of the annual profits were reserved for shareholders. There was no stipulation dictating whether the route of the canal would be direct or indirect (from the Nile). The company was given the right to free quarries and import equipment tax-free.

In that original concession, founding members of the Company were to receive 10 percent of the canal&#x27;s profits. These members included François Barthélemy Arlès-Dufour, Louis Maurice Adolphe Linant de Bellefonds, Richard Cobden, Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin, Benoît Fould, Lesseps and several members of his family, Eugène Mougel, Ruyssenaers (Dutch Consul General in Egypt), M. Sabatier (French Consul General), Sa&#x27;id of Egypt and multiple members of his family, Paulin Talabot and his brother Edmond, and members of the chambers of commerce of Lyon and Venice.

===Second canal concession (1856)===
Following the granting of the first concession in 1854, Lesseps was in near constant travel to assemble diplomatic approvals perceived as necessary to build the canal from other foreign governments involved. Although the first concession was granted by Egypt, at the time Egypt was an administrative subdivision of the Ottoman Empire, and so Lesseps traveled frequently to the Sublime Porte to make his case to the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, Ali Pasha. The Ottoman Empire, although neutral to the idea, were greatly under the influence of the British at that time. Since Britain – through the policy of Lord Palmerston – was largely opposed to the canal project, and its citizens owned a potentially competing project in form of a railroad from Alexandria to Cairo, not to mention various merchant warehouses along the African sea route, Lesseps made several trips to Britain between 1854 and 1858 to persuade Palmerston and the British public. Lesseps also had to fight back against Robert Stephenson&#x27;s and even Enfantin&#x27;s expert opinions on the feasibility of the canal. Lesseps formed an organization of international engineers (the International Commission for the piercing of the isthmus of Suez) to again study the canal route in late 1855, and its results were released to the general public.

In January 1856, Said granted a second concession to Lesseps&#x27; company which replaced the first concession. This concession defined the canal as a direct route, but also stipulated a freshwater canal from the Nile to Lake Timsah. Again, mining and land rights were included along with generous tax exemptions. A majority (ths) of the workers for the company were required to be supplied from Egypt and the skilled workers were required to be paid commensurate with skilled workers on other Egyptian public works projects. An amendment stipulated that work could only commence with the approval of the Ottoman Sultan. The board of directors of the concessionaire company would have 32 members, each serving for eight years. The operations office would be headquartered in Alexandria, while administrative offices would be located in Paris. This company was to be called the Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez.

==Creation and initial public offering==

In late Spring of 1858, the French Academy of Sciences released a public report approving of the engineering plans for the canal. The report noted that in the previous two decades, Europeans had spent 12 billion francs building railroads, and that at a cost of 200 million francs (or £8 million), the canal was affordable. Lesseps pushed ahead without formal British or Ottoman approval. In October 1858, Lesseps notified international press and company agents that 400,000 shares at a price of 500 francs each would be publicly offered beginning 5 November 1858. In the notification, Lesseps estimated an annual revenue of 30 million francs based on freight fees, and a construction period lasting 6 years. In preparation for the offering, shares were sent to brokerage houses across Europe and in the United States. At the close of offering on 30 November 1858, about half of the shares (around 200,000) belonged to French citizens with the next largest block owned by citizens of the Ottoman Empire (Said bought around 60,000). None of the shares reserved for Britain, Russia, Austria, or the United States were bought. Said purchased the remaining unbought shares (for a total of 177,000 shares) in order to ensure that the company reached its necessary capitalization amount (to become a legal entity as defined in the 1856 concession). The average number of shares bought by French investors amounted to nine shares each. Lesseps declared the company as being officially formed on 15 December 1858.

==Canal construction==
Prior to the existence of the Suez Canal, Port Said and Lake Timsah had few residents, the Great Bitter Lake was a dry basin, and drinking water was difficult to find. In addition to infrastructure challenges, Said would not allow the use of massive corvée labour until 1861, when Napoleon III publicly backed the canal project. In the meantime from 1859 to 1861, the company&#x27;s Chief Engineer Eugène Mougel and its new superintendent Alphonse Hardon, planned for and built fresh water distilleries along the route, hauled in additional fresh water from the Nile, built housing for workers, gathered stone for the jetty, assembled some aging dredging equipment from the Nile, and looked for workers. Company town establishments arose along the route. In 1860, the company employed 210 Europeans and 544 Egyptians along 11 stations of the route. Employees were provided scrip to buy provisions. Plans were made for an access canal from the Nile to Lake Timsah to provide fresh water. Once the necessary infrastructure was established, the plan was to build an 8 metre-wide access canal from Port Said to Lake Timsah and later from Lake Timsah to the Red Sea with the aid of blasting. After the use of corvée labor was approved in 1861, work proceeded south from Lake Manzala with, at its height, 60,000 fellahin hand digging the canal. Guards were used to watch over the fellahin, although a large number of guards were not required due to the remote location and nearby hostile Bedouins. At the same time, the freshwater canal was being dug easterly to Lake Timsah. At the end of 1862, the access canal connecting Lake Timsah to the Mediterranean Sea was complete. François Philippe Voisin became chief engineer in January 1861 and Hardon&#x27;s contract expired at the end of 1862. Compared with the later mechanised excavation, a low amount of material was excavated during this phase of construction. The British began to loudly decry the use of corvée labor in 1862.

Said died in mid-January 1863, and in late-January, just before Ismail began the process of establishing himself as the new viceroy of Egypt by Ottoman Sultan Abdul Aziz, Ismail declared that he was establishing reforms in the ways of the creation of a civil service list and the abolishment of corvée labor. Ismail&#x27;s motives had to do with his own personal projects (cotton farms, whose export from Egypt had been increasing since the beginning of the American Civil War, and other cash crops and public works) within Egypt and with limiting the company&#x27;s power. Ismail would soon issue a clarification that corvée labor could still be used for public works essential for the common good (though not on the Suez Canal project). The British also commented on the use of forced labor by the company. Ismail issued declarations upholding much of the previous concessions, with exceptions including the labor issue. Aziz favored the end of the use of the corvée and the return of land from the company to Egypt. The problem was referred during 1864 to the arbitration of Napoleon III. Ismail authorised Boghos Nubar Nubarian to negotiate on behalf of Egypt, and Nubar in turn allied with Emile Ollivier and Morny against Lesseps and the company. It wasn&#x27;t until July 1864 that Napoleon III released a ruling for the framework for resolution which accepted the 1856 concession as a binding contract, ended the use of corvée labor, placed the land grants back into the hands of the Egyptian government, but called for remuneration of 84 million francs to the Suez Canal Company for violation of the labor and land agreements. Ismail received a loan from the Oppenheim brothers for nearly 100 million francs.

Meanwhile, the progress of the canal construction proceeded slowly from 1863–1864. By February 1864, the corvée had finished the access canal from Lake Timsah to the Red Sea.

After Napoleon III&#x27;s decree in Summer of 1864, the use of corvée labor was restricted. The use of large mechanical dredging machines began to excavate the main canal. In December 1863, Voisin hired Paul Borel and Alexandre Lavalley&#x27;s company, Borel, Lavalley, and Company, to design, build, and operate the dredging and excavation machines to finish the canal. Borel and Lavalley, like many of the engineers working on the project, were École Polytechnique alumni. These machines were powered by steam from coal in an era before the mass production of machines and machine tools. The men had prior railroad experience and Lavalley, in particular, had customised locomotives, designed lighthouses on the Black Sea, created a tunnel boring machine in Lithuania, and created a machine to dredge ports in Russia. Railroad tracks were laid along the canal route to accommodate some of the machines, whereas others were mounted on barges. The varying soil type necessitated more than a dozen different types of excavation machinery. Nearly 300 of these machines were used in this 5 year dredging period. Their subcontractor excavation price was determined on a price-per-unit basis – francs per cubic meter – which was further varied depending upon the soil type they excavated. Ultimately, Borel, Lavalley and company removed 75% of the 74 million cubic meters excavated from the main canal. And most of that work was done between 1867 and 1869. Another French contractor, Alphonse Couvreux, who is credited with the first documented use of a bucket chain excavator on land, employed seven of his excavators to dig about 8 million cubic yards of material from 1863 to 1868.

During this same period, the jetties for Port Said were also constructed by the Dussaud brothers. They created two jetty structures, one at 1.5 miles in length, and the other at 2 miles in length, by dumping 20-ton concrete blocks in the Mediterranean Sea. The blocks were produced in an assembly line with mechanical elevators to pour in cement, lime, and water. After curing for two months in wooden frames, they were lifted on to barges that dropped them into the sea. 30,000 blocks were used in the jetties.

In 1867, the company began to develop its fee structure in preparation for opening. During this same year the company had already started to charge fees for transport of goods across the northern almost-completed portion to the separate southern access canal, garnering millions of francs in annual revenue. The company estimated that of the 10 million tons of annual goods shipped around the Cape of Good Hope, half would pass through the canal. After some complaints, a figure of 10 francs per ton and 10 francs per passenger was announced.

Politically during this period, company workers experienced a cholera outbreak in 1865 that caused the deaths of several hundred Europeans, including Voisin&#x27;s wife, and more than 1,500 Arabs and Egyptians. The Ottoman Sultan approved of the French reconciliation framework in 1866. By 1866 there were about 8,000 Europeans and 10,000 Arab and Egyptians that had settled in the canal region. By 1867 and 1868 the total population in the canal region would grow to 26,000 and 34,000, respectively. As the diversity and number of settlers in the canal region rose, Ismail directed Nubar to begin his decade-long journey of revising the judicial system from a system of capitulations to a system of mixed tribunals. The company made an appeal at the 1867 Universal Exposition of Art and Industry to attempt to sell an additional 100 million francs (£4 million) worth of debt in the form of bonds – maturing in 50 years – to finish the project. Remaining unsold bonds were sold in lotteries approved by the French government.

Two dams prevented the filling of the Great Bitter Lake and thus the completion of the canal, one to the north and one to the south. Rocky terrain was cleared on the Serapeum ridge to the north of the lake for a lake filling ceremony witnessed by Ismail in early 1869. The prince of Wales visited in the Spring of 1869 shortly after the initial lake filling ceremony but while the lake was still filling and toured the canal zone. The prince of Wales stayed in a chalet in Ismailia while in the region. The southern dam in the rocky Chalufa ridge would not connect the Red Sea with the Mediterranean Sea until it was broken on 15 August 1869. Prior to that, hand digging was used to remove soil in the remaining 10 miles between Suez and the southern dam. The average final width of the canal was 200 feet – 300 feet at the top with a depth of at least 26 feet.

The company and Ismail set aside 1 million francs for the inauguration of the canal on 17 November 1869. One thousand guests were invited for a tour upon opening. The empress Eugénie and Ismail were a major attraction. The multinational flotilla of about 60 ships proceeded south from Port Said to Ismailia, where a large expenses-paid festivity took place including: a riding exhibition, a rifle competition, tight-rope walking, an Armenian with a dancing bear, an Italian with a hurdy-gurdy, Arab sword dancing, glassblowing, flame eating, snake charming, juggling, dancing darvishes, belly dancers, Koran recitations, Arabic poetry recitations, prostitution, food, and drink. On 19 November, the flotilla proceeded south to Suez.

In summary, the total construction cost of the canal, according to Lesseps&#x27; autobiographical account, was £11,627,000. This cost was more than covered by the initial equity capitalization of £8 million (1858), a legal decision awarding about £4 million (1864 and 1866), and a bond issuance of £4 million (1867).

==Early operations==


Approximately 500 ships carrying around 400,000 tons made passage through the canal in 1870, which was much less than the 5 million tons projected in 1867. Of that tonnage, three-quarters came from Britain. In 1871, more tonnage made the passage, but it was still less than 1 million tons. The ship tonnage for 1872, 1873, and 1874 was 1,439,000, 2,085,000, and 2,424,000, respectively.

Toll revenue from the first five years (1870–1874) are as follows: £206,373, £359,747, £656,305, £915,853, and £994,375.

In 1873, Ismail borrowed £30 million (more than double the cost of the canal) to continue building other infrastructure in Egypt. By 1875, the Egyptian treasury was £100 million in debt, and no lender would issue Ismail money to pay for the December debt instalment of several million pounds. Société Générale was interested in his shares of the Suez Canal Company in exchange for paying off the debt instalment, however, the British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli responded quickly and with permission from parliament and Queen Victoria received a £4 million loan from Lionel de Rothschild to purchase the 177,000 shares from Ismail on behalf of the British government. This offer was slightly greater than the French offer, and Ismail physically delivered his share certificates to the British consulate. By December 1875 Britain became the largest shareholder of the Suez Canal Company, owning 44 percent of the shares. However, the remaining 56% of the company&#x27;s shares remained under the ownership of French shareholders.

In 1876, Ismail again faced government debt payment issues and was forced to join an international commission which would govern Egypt&#x27;s finances known as Dual Control. As a condition of joining the commission, the khedive&#x27;s right to 15 percent of the commissions from Suez Canal traffic was sold. The buyer was a French bank and the price was 22 million francs.

In 1879, Ismail was deposed by the Ottoman Sultan and replaced with Tawfiq. Tawfiq was challenged for leadership during a nationalist uprising in 1880 by Colonel Ahmad Urabi. In response to an anti-European riot in 1882, Britain landed an army, seized the canal, and developed a protectorate over Egypt, placing Lord Cromer as the head governing authority.

The 1888 Convention of Constantinople declared the canal a neutral zone under British protection. The agreement went into effect in 1904, the same year as the Entente cordiale between Britain and France.

==World War I and Interwar period==
The British assigned more than 100,000 troops to the canal during the first world war. The canal was used to help stage T. E. Lawrence and Faisal&#x27;s Arab revolt during the war against the Ottomans. Egypt was declared an independent country in 1922, however, Britain still asserted a right to defend the canal and stationed troops there for that purpose into the 1930s. The company&#x27;s profits rose greatly during the 1920s and 1930s.

In 1938, Benito Mussolini demanded that Italy have a sphere of influence in the Suez Canal, specifically demanding that an Italian representative be placed on the company&#x27;s board of directors. Italy opposed the French monopoly over the Suez Canal because under French domination of the company all Italian merchant traffic to its colony of Italian East Africa was forced to pay tolls upon entering the canal.

==From World War II to the Suez Crisis==
Britain secured the canal against the Germans and their Afrika Korps during the second world war. Immediately following the end of the second World War, company profits rose greatly due to petroleum shipments and the company reserved much of this income. By 1952, the company held four different reserves accounts: a statutory reserve of 430 million francs, a special reserve of 7 billion francs, a contingency fund of 1.72 billion francs, and a pension fund of 7.81 billion francs. After Jacques Georges-Picot&#x27;s arrival to the company in the 1940s, the board started to hire investment advisors, and by the late 1940s, the company had investments in Air France, Air Liquide, colonial sugar refineries, coal mining companies, railroad companies, electric companies, the African forest and agriculture Society, and the Lyonnaise de Madagascar. King Farouk of the Muhammad Ali line was overthrown in a military coup in 1952 and Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser eventually emerged as the leader of Egypt. By the mid-1950s, canal traffic reached 122 million tons annually, over half of which was oil shipments. In response to the World Bank denying a loan to build a dam across the Nile at Aswan, Nasser declared on 26 July 1956 that Egypt was nationalizing the canal. In response, Britain, France, and Israel attacked Egypt and destroyed large portions of Port Said. The canal was returned to Egypt after the United States disapproved of the action. For the following ten years, the canal was operated by Egypt who paid an amount to the Suez Canal Company for its use. In 1967, another war with Israel arose and the canal was made impassable with scuttled ships. The canal would not reopen until 1975 after the Camp David Accord. Traffic through the canal began to fall in the early 1980s after petroleum pipelines eroded ship traffic business. After the company became defunct in the late 1990s, the canal was generating $2 billion a year in revenue for Egypt.

==Development after 1956==
Following the Suez crisis, the Suez Company reinvented itself as a diversified investment firm. In 1959, it established a banking subsidiary, the , renamed in 1966 following Suez&#x27;s combination with financier &#x27;s conglomerate, . That bank merged in 1975 with the Banque de l&#x27;Indochine to form Banque Indosuez, which the Suez Company eventually sold to Crédit Agricole in 1996. Meanwhile, in 1972 the Suez Company acquired control of another bank, Crédit Industriel et Commercial, which it relinquished in the 1980s. 

Following its nationalization in 1982 and privatization in 1987, the Suez Company in 1988 successfully participated in a takeover battle for control of the Société Générale de Belgique, which significantly broadened its portfolio of activities. 

==Paris headquarters building==

The opulent building at 1, rue d&#x27;Astorg was built for the Suez canal Company in 1911-1913 on a design by architect Henri Paul Nénot. The Suez Company was long known colloquially as the &quot;old lady of the rue d&#x27;Astorg&quot; () with reference to its headquarters address.

Following the Suez Company&#x27;s merger with Lyonnaise des eaux, it was sold to the real estate arm of General Electric and renovated in the early 2000s. In 2006, a museum dedicated to the Suez Canal history was created in the former board room, on the initiative of the heritage nonprofit . Since May 2015, it has been the Parisian office of the law firm Clifford Chance.

<doc id="1186092" wikidata="Q374610" url="?curid=1186092" title="David McCullough">
<text>David Gaub McCullough (; July 7, 1933 – August 7, 2022) was an American popular historian. He was a two-time winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. In 2006, he was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States&#x27; highest civilian award.

Born and raised in Pittsburgh, McCullough earned a degree in English literature from Yale University. His first book was &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot; (1968), and he wrote nine more on such topics as Harry S. Truman, John Adams, Theodore Roosevelt, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Panama Canal, and the Wright brothers. McCullough also narrated numerous documentaries, such as &quot;The Civil War&quot; by Ken Burns, as well as the 2003 film &quot;Seabiscuit&quot;, and he hosted the PBS television documentary series &quot;American Experience&quot; for twelve years. McCullough&#x27;s two Pulitzer Prize–winning books—&quot;Truman&quot; and &quot;John Adams.&quot;—were adapted by HBO into a TV film and a miniseries, respectively.

==Early life and education==
McCullough was born in the Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Ruth (née Rankin; 1899–1985) and Christian Hax McCullough (1899–1989). He was of Scots-Irish, German, and English descent. He was educated at Linden Avenue Grade School and Shady Side Academy, in his hometown of Pittsburgh.

One of four sons, McCullough had a &quot;marvelous&quot; childhood with a wide range of interests, including sports and drawing cartoons. McCullough&#x27;s parents and his grandmother, who read to him often, introduced him to books at an early age. His parents often talked about history, a topic he said should be discussed more often. McCullough &quot;loved school, every day&quot;; he contemplated many career choices, ranging from architect, actor, painter, writer, to lawyer, and considered attending medical school for a time.

In 1951, McCullough began attending Yale University. He said that it was a &quot;privilege&quot; to study English at Yale because of faculty members such as John O&#x27;Hara, John Hersey, Robert Penn Warren, and Brendan Gill. McCullough occasionally ate lunch with the Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist and playwright Thornton Wilder. Wilder, said McCullough, taught him that a competent writer maintains &quot;an air of freedom&quot; in the storyline, so that a reader will not anticipate the outcome, even if the book is non-fiction.

While at Yale, he became a member of Skull and Bones. He served apprenticeships at &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, the United States Information Agency, and &quot;American Heritage&quot;, where he enjoyed research. He said: &quot;Once I discovered the endless fascination of doing the research and of doing the writing, I knew I had found what I wanted to do in my life.&quot; While attending Yale, McCullough studied Arts and earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree in English, with the intention of becoming a fiction writer or playwright. He graduated with honors in English literature in 1955.

==Writing career==
=== Early career ===
After graduation, McCullough moved to New York City, where &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; hired him as a trainee in 1956. He later worked as an editor and writer for the United States Information Agency in Washington, D.C. After working for twelve years in editing and writing, including a position at &quot;American Heritage&quot;, McCullough &quot;felt that [he] had reached the point where [he] could attempt something on [his] own.&quot;

McCullough &quot;had no anticipation that [he] was going to write history, but [he] stumbled upon a story that [he] thought was powerful, exciting, and very worth telling.&quot; While working at &quot;American Heritage&quot;, McCullough wrote in his spare time for three years. &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot;, a chronicle of one of the worst flood disasters in United States history, was published in 1968 to high praise by critics. John Leonard, of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said of McCullough, &quot;We have no better social historian.&quot; Despite rough financial times, he decided to become a full-time writer, encouraged by his wife Rosalee.

=== Gaining recognition ===
After the success of &quot;The Johnstown Flood&quot;, two new publishers offered him contracts, one to write about the Great Chicago Fire and another about the San Francisco earthquake. Simon &amp; Schuster, publisher of his first book, also offered McCullough a contract to write a second book. Trying not to become &quot;Bad News McCullough&quot;, he decided to write about a subject showing &quot;people were not always foolish and inept or irresponsible.&quot; He remembered the words of his Yale teacher: &quot;[Thornton] Wilder said he got the idea for a book or a play when he wanted to learn about something. Then, he&#x27;d check to see if anybody had already done it, and if they hadn&#x27;t, he&#x27;d do it.&quot; McCullough decided to write a history of the Brooklyn Bridge, which he had walked across many times. It was published in 1972.

He also proposed, from a suggestion by his editor, a work about the Panama Canal; both were accepted by the publisher. Five years later, &quot;The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal, 1870–1914&quot; was released, gaining McCullough widespread recognition. The book won the National Book Award in History, the Samuel Eliot Morison Award, the Francis Parkman Prize, and the Cornelius Ryan Award. Later in 1977, McCullough travelled to the White House to advise Jimmy Carter and the United States Senate on the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which would give Panama control of the Canal. Carter later said that the treaties, which were negotiated to transfer ownership of the Canal to Panama, would not have passed had it not been for the book.

=== &quot;The story of people&quot; ===
McCullough&#x27;s fourth work was his first biography, reinforcing his belief that &quot;history is the story of people&quot;. Released in 1981, &quot;Mornings on Horseback&quot; tells the story of seventeen years in the life of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States. The work ranged from Roosevelt&#x27;s childhood to 1886, and tells of a &quot;life intensely lived.&quot; The book won McCullough&#x27;s second National Book Award and his first &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Prize for Biography and New York Public Library Literary Lion Award. Next, he published &quot;Brave Companions&quot;, a collection of essays that &quot;unfold seamlessly&quot;. Written over twenty years, the book includes essays about Louis Agassiz, Alexander von Humboldt, John and Washington Roebling, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Conrad Richter, and Frederic Remington.

With his next book, McCullough published his second biography, &quot;Truman&quot; (1992) about the 33rd president. The book won McCullough his first Pulitzer Prize, in the category of &quot;Best Biography or Autobiography&quot;, and his second Francis Parkman Prize. Two years later, the book was adapted as &quot;Truman&quot; (1995), a television film by HBO, starring Gary Sinise as Truman.

I think it&#x27;s important to remember that these men are not perfect. If they were marble gods, what they did wouldn&#x27;t be so admirable. The more we see the founders as humans the more we can understand them. – David McCullough

Working for the next seven years, McCullough published &quot;John Adams&quot; (2001), his third biography about a United States president. One of the fastest-selling non-fiction books in history, the book won McCullough&#x27;s second Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Best Biography or Autobiography&quot; in 2002. He started it as a book about the founding fathers and back-to-back presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson; but dropped Jefferson to focus on Adams. HBO adapted &quot;John Adams&quot; as a seven-part miniseries by the same name. Premiering in 2008, it starred Paul Giamatti in the title role. The DVD version of the miniseries includes the biographical documentary, &quot;David McCullough: Painting with Words&quot;.

McCullough&#x27;s &quot;1776&quot; tells the story of the founding year of the United States, focusing on George Washington, the amateur Continental Army, and other struggles for independence. Because of McCullough&#x27;s popularity, its initial printing was 1.25 million copies, many more than the average history book. Upon its release, the book was a number one best-seller in the United States. A miniseries adaptation of &quot;1776&quot; was rumored.

McCullough considered writing a sequel to &quot;1776&quot;. However, he signed a contract with Simon &amp; Schuster to do a work about Americans in Paris between 1830 and 1900, &quot;The Greater Journey&quot;, which was published in 2011. The book covers 19th-century Americans, including Mark Twain and Samuel Morse, who migrated to Paris and went on to achieve importance in culture or innovation. Other subjects include Benjamin Silliman, who had been Morse&#x27;s science teacher at Yale, Elihu Washburne, the U.S. Ambassador to France during the Franco-Prussian War, and Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in the United States.

McCullough&#x27;s &quot;The Wright Brothers&quot; was published in 2015. &quot;The Pioneers&quot; followed in 2019, the story of the first European American settlers of the Northwest Territory, a vast American wilderness to which the Ohio River was the gateway.

==Personal life==

In 1954, McCullough married Rosalee Barnes; the couple had first met as teenagers, and they remained together until her death on June 9, 2022. They had five children, nineteen grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. In 2016, the couple moved from the Back Bay of Boston to Hingham, Massachusetts; three of his five children also lived there . He had a summer home in Camden, Maine. McCullough&#x27;s interests included sports, history, and visual art, including watercolor and portrait painting.

His son, David Jr., an English teacher at Wellesley High School in the Boston suburbs, achieved sudden fame in 2012, when he gave a commencement speech in which he repeatedly told graduating students that they were &quot;not special&quot;; his speech went viral on YouTube. Another son, Bill, is married to the daughter of former Florida governor Bob Graham.

A registered independent, McCullough typically avoided publicly commenting on contemporary political issues. When asked to do so, he would repeatedly say, &quot;My specialty is dead politicians.&quot; During the 2016 presidential election season, he broke with his custom to criticize Donald Trump, whom he called &quot;a monstrous clown with a monstrous ego.&quot;

McCullough taught a writing course at Wesleyan University and was a visiting scholar at Cornell University and Dartmouth College.
After a period of failing health, McCullough died at his home in Hingham on August 7, 2022, just two months after his wife&#x27;s death, at age 89.

McCullough&#x27;s lecture was titled &quot;The Course of Human Events&quot;.

In 1995, McCullough received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust.

McCullough was referred to as a &quot;master of the art of narrative history.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic John Leonard wrote that McCullough was &quot;incapable of writing a page of bad prose.&quot; His works have been published in ten languages, over nine million copies have been printed, and all of his books are still in print.

In December 2012, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania announced that it would rename the 16th Street Bridge in Pittsburgh in honor of McCullough.

In a ceremony at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, on November 16, 2015, the Air University of the United States Air Force awarded McCullough an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters degree. He was also made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Yale University in 2015.

<doc id="1186113" wikidata="Q4057079" url="?curid=1186113" title="Aggressor squadron">
<text>An aggressor squadron or adversary squadron (in the US Navy and USMC) is a squadron that is trained to act as an opposing force in military wargames. Aggressor squadrons use enemy tactics, techniques, and procedures to give a realistic simulation of air combat (as opposed to training against one&#x27;s own forces). Since it is impractical to use actual enemy aircraft and equipment, surrogate aircraft are used to emulate potential adversaries. 

The first formal use of dissimilar aircraft for training was in 1969 by the United States Navy Fighter Weapons School (better known as &quot;Topgun&quot;), which used the A-4 Skyhawk to simulate the performance of the MiG-17. The success of formalized dissimilar air combat training (DACT) led to transition of Navy Instrument Training Squadrons equipped with the A-4 into Adversary Squadrons at each master jet base. The United States Air Force followed suit with their first aggressor squadrons at Nellis AFB equipped with the readily available T-38 Talon.

==Origins==

In the Second World War, the antagonists captured each other&#x27;s aircraft and introduced them into a modest DACT role. The Germans created a unit known as &quot;Touring Zirkus Rosarius&quot; with captured P-51s, P-47s etc. that visited fighter bases and even let the senior pilots fly the adversary aircraft themselves. The RAF created No. 1426 Flight RAF with Luftwaffe captured fighters (Bf 109s and Fw 190s) that were fully tested and then taken to USAAF and RAF bases for familiarization training.

==United States==

=== Domestically-made aircraft ===
US aggressor squadrons fly small and low-wing loaded fighters that are used to represent those of the potential adversaries. Originally Douglas A-4s (US Navy) and Northrop F-5s (US Navy, Marines, and Air Force) were flown along with T-38 Talons that were immediately available and served as placeholders until new F-5E/F Tiger II aircraft were introduced. 

These were eventually supplemented by early-model F/A-18As (US Navy), specially built F-16Ns (for the US Navy), and F-16A models (for the Air Force). At the end of 2005, the USAF started using the larger and faster F-15 Eagle as an aggressor aircraft alongside the F-16 at Nellis Air Force Base. However, the USAF began phasing out its F-15 aggressors towards the end of 2014. With the deactivation of the 65th Aggressor Squadron, the F-16C became the only dedicated aggressor type at Nellis AFB until 2022, when the 65th was reactivated with the F-35A Lightning II to better simulate stealth fighter threats.

=== Foreign-made aircraft ===
Foreign aircraft have been used as aggressors in the United States, most notably the Israeli Kfir fighter, designated F-21 in its use as an adversary asset. Actual Soviet MiG-17s, MiG-21s, and MiG-23s have also been flown by the US Air Force as Aggressors over the Nellis ranges, under the Constant Peg program. The US Army operates eleven Soviet or Russian aircraft for adversary training, including Mi-24s, Mi-8s, Mi-2s, and An-2s.

German MiG-29 aircraft were regular visitors to the United States before being sold to Poland and participated in valuable DACT training at Nellis AFB as well as NAS Key West in addition to providing details to overseas locations or hosting US squadrons in Germany. One MiG-29 was loaned to the US for evaluation providing insight in the threat technology.

The Navy and Marine Corps briefly operated 2 squadrons of F-21 Kfir adversaries at NAS Oceana (VF-43) and Marine Corps Air Station Yuma (VMFT-401). This started in 1985 up through the 1990&#x27;s when the planes were taken out of aggressor service.

===Aggressor performances===

While aircraft used for the aggressor role are usually older jet fighters, this has not always been the case. During the mid-1980s, the US Navy determined that the A-4s and F-5s flown at Top Gun were not adequate in simulating the air-to-air capabilities of the newest Soviet fighters such as the MiG-29 and Su-27. At this point, the U.S. Navy held a competition for an adversary platform that could viably represent fourth-generation fighter threats embodied by the MiG-29, Su-27 and the Mirage 2000. 

The competing airframes were the General Dynamics F-16C Falcon and the Northrop F-20 Tigershark. According to George Hall&#x27;s &quot;Top Gun,&quot; many instructors at the Navy Fighter Weapons School preferred that the Navy procure the F-20. One reason given was the similarity to the F-5E Tiger aircraft already used by Top Gun and the four active duty adversary squadrons (VF-43, VF-45, VF-126, and VFA-127). However, General Dynamics priced the Falcon for the Navy at below cost. 

The F-16C won the competition and the F-20 failed to win another order. This, compounded with other lost contracts, led to the demise of the F-20 program and the elimination of one more competitor for the F-16 in the worldwide fighter market. The F-16C as procured by the Navy was equipped with the lighter AN/APG-63 radar set as flown in the F-16A and had a titanium wing spar as in other F-16s. It was not equipped with the M61 Vulcan gun system and had twin lens pods on both sides of the intake to enlarge the relatively small radar cross section of the F-16. 

Any equipment not necessary for visual-range aerial combat was removed, enhancing their agility and dog-fighting abilities. These F-16s were designated F-16N, and twenty-two single seat aircraft and four twin seat, designated the TF-16N, were built for the US Navy and flown at its famous &quot;TOPGUN&quot; Navy Fighter Weapons School starting in 1987. They were also flown by VF-43, VF-45 and VF-126, which were still active duty Adversary squadrons at the time. 

Despite the airframe being strengthened to cope with the continuous high-G loads associated with air combat maneuvering, cracks were detected on the wings after only a few years of operation, leading to grounding of the Navy F-16 fleet by 1992 and complete retirement of the F-16N by 1994. In 2002, the Navy began to receive fourteen F-16A and F-16B models from AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB that were brand new aircraft originally intended for Pakistan, but had been embargoed. All 14 are operated by NSAWC for use by TOPGUN in addition to the F/A-18A aircraft already in operation at NAS Fallon.

Aggressor aircraft in the United States are typically painted in colorful camouflage schemes, matching the colors of many Soviet aircraft and contrasting with the gray colors used in most operational US combat aircraft. Camouflage schemes that consist of many shades of blue (similar to those used in Sukhoi fighters) or of green and mostly-light brown (similar to the colors used in many Middle Eastern countries&#x27; combat aircraft) are most common.

===Squadrons===
Aggressor squadrons in the US armed forces include the USAF 18th Aggressor Squadron at Eielson AFB, the 64th, the 65th Aggressor Squadrons at Nellis AFB, the US Marine Corps&#x27; VMFT-401 at MCAS Yuma and the US Navy&#x27;s VFC-12 at NAS Oceana, VFC-13 at NAS Fallon, VFC-111 at NAS Key West and VFC-204 at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans, as well as the famous &quot;TOPGUN&quot; Naval Fighter Weapons School (US Navy) which is not a squadron per se, but operates F-16A, F/A-18A/B, and F/A-18E/F aircraft as part of the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center (NSAWC) at NAS Fallon. 

With the exception of the NSAWC aircraft, all the US Navy and US Marine Corps adversary squadrons are Reserve Component units and aircraft belonging to the Navy Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve.

The USAF also operated Aggressor squadrons in the UK and in the Philippines. The 527 AS was a USAFE unit that first operated out of the former RAF Alconbury near Cambridge, England, then later from the former RAF Bentwaters near Ipswich. The 527th initially flew F-5s, then later switched to F-16s. They trained over the North Sea and in Germany, Spain and Italy. The PACAF counterpart, the 26th Training Aggressor Squadron, operated F-5s out of the former Clark Air Base near Angeles City, Philippines.
==Canada==

The Canadian Forces Air Command operated CF-5 (both single- and two-seat) aircraft in the &quot;adversary&quot; role, by 419 Squadron at Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake, Alberta. These wore quasi-Warsaw Pact colours similar to those worn by USAF/USN aircraft. This role ended with the retirement of the CF-5 in 1995.

Since 2005, the Canadian Forces has employed civilian contractor Top Aces to provide aggressor services utilising modernised Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets, Lear 35s, and Douglas A-4 Skyhawks. These aircraft are flown by highly experienced retired and current RCAF pilots, based out of CFB Cold Lake, CFB Bagotville, Victoria, BC, and Halifax, NS.

414 Squadron operated the CF-100, CT-133, CC-117 and EF-101 in the electronic warfare (EW) adversary role from CFB North Bay, Ontario, until 2002. The squadron re-formed in 2009, again in the EW adversary role, based in Ottawa, Ontario, flying aboard contracted Top Aces aircraft. They provide adversary training to the RCAF and RCN in both jamming and threat replication. The squadron has previously supported Canadian Army air defense units, but with the retirement of the ADATS platform this role was discontinued.

Fleet support squadrons VU-32 and VU-33 sometimes filled an adversary role, using their CT-133s to simulate sea-skimming missiles, such as the Exocet, for the Canadian Forces Maritime Command&#x27;s vessels.

==China==
The Flight Test and Training Centre (FTTC) is located at Cangzhou. FTTC is organized into 3 regiments which simulate enemy aircraft. 
* The 1st FTTC Regiment operates J-10A/AS and the JL-9. 
* The 2nd FTTC Regiment operates J-7E, J-8D/F, and JL-9. 
* The 3rd Regiment operates Su-30MKK.

In 2011, the 3rd Regiment of the FTTC traveled to Pakistan to exercise with the Pakistani Air Force.

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom maintained two units to undertake the aggressor role, both of which operated the BAE Hawk, No. 100 Squadron RAF and 736 Naval Air Squadron
It was announced in July 2021 that apart from the Red Arrows, all other Hawk T1 aircraft in the British military would be retired and these two squadrons disbanded on 31 March 2022. 
On 28 March 2022, the RAF announced that a six-year contract to provide these services, now known as the Interim Red Air Aggressor Training Service (IRAATS) was awarded to Draken Europe using a fleet of Aero L-159 ALCA Honey Badgers and Dassault Falcon 20s.

==Japan==
The Tactical Fighter Training Group was established in 1981. It used Mitsubishi T-2 aircraft as aggressors. Since 1990 it has used Mitsubishi F-15J/DJ aircraft. It is based at Komatsu Air Base in Ishikawa Prefecture.
==Taiwan==
The 46th Imaginary Enemy Squadron of the Republic of China Air Force was established in 1972 under the guidance of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan. It used the F-86 Sabre aircraft from 1972 to 1977, the F-5A/B Freedom Fighter from 1977 to 1981, and now it uses F-5E/F Tiger II fighters as aggressors. The squadron is located at the Zhi-Hang Air Base in Taitung.

== Turkey ==
Established in 1966 and restructued in 1992, 132nd Squadron of the Turkish Air Force, as defined by the unique &quot;weapons and tactics&quot; concept, which is a combination regular fighter, test flight and tactics development duties, it is the sole aggressor squadron of Turkey. The squadron is based at the Konya Air Base and operates F-16 Fighting Falcons since 2007.

==UNI SOVIET==
The Soviet Air Forces began a program known as the 1521st Center for Combat Employment, located in Mary, Turkmen SSR, in 1970. The program was prompted by the poor performance of Soviet-supplied aircraft in the Middle East and by the equivalent American programmes. Before that the Air Force units used some of its own planes in MV roles, the MV standing for Modyeliruyemyiy Vrag which translates as “simulated enemy”.

The unit was also known as the 1521st Aviation Base, and consisted of 3 squadrons:
* Two squadrons took “aggressor” roles. Initially they operated the MiG-21bis and the MiG-23MLD. Later both were equipped with MiG-29, painted to make them look like the F-15 Eagle. 
* A third squadron operated drones for target practice for the visiting Soviet Air Force units.

The current status of 1521st is not known. It was taken over by Turkmenistan in 1992. It is supposed to have been disbanded after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

==NATO and others==

Reunified Germany inherited 24 MiG-29s from East German Air Force. They formed the JG73 &quot;Steinhoff&quot; squadron, that was partially used as Aggressor squadron. NATO air forces compared the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Fulcrums with western types during NATO training exercises. Many western pilots were able to train combat tactics against a real Russian fighter flown by highly experienced pilots and to execute air-air-combats against &#x27;the real thing&#x27;.

Between 1985 and the mid-nineties Norwegian Air Force 336th squadron was used in the aggressor role on numerous exercises and DACT courses.

In Italy since 2015 the Typhoon squadrons started cooperating with the 212° Gruppo (Squadron) that is responsible for Lead-In Fighter Training course and employs their T-346A Master advanced jet trainers in the Aggressors role. Italian Air Force Alenia Aermacchi T-346As belonging to the 61° Stormo deployed to Tactical Leadership Programme in the Aggressors role. 

NATO integrated opposing force (IOPFOR) Program will mean privately owned lightweight fighters could provide an aggressor training service for NATO.

Egypt has recently established an Aggressor squadron Called &quot;95 Aggressor Squadron&quot; Operating F-16s Block 52s that were added lately.

The Israeli Air Force&#x27;s aggressor squadron is 115 Squadron, also known as the Flying Dragon or Red Squadron. It is the sole IAF squadron to operate fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters and also ground-based assets. The unit also offers its services to other nations.

==New Zealand==

No. 2 Squadron RNZAF was moved to NAS Nowra, New South Wales, in February 1991. Their A-4K Kahu Skyhawks primarily served as targets for Royal Australian Navy air defences, but also were used in DACT with RAAF F/A-18 Hornets. The squadron was disbanded in December 2001.

==Private/outsourced aggressors==
Some aggressor missions do not require dogfighting, but instead involve flying relatively simple profiles to test the target acquisition and tracking capabilities of radars, missiles and aircraft. Some of these missions had been outsourced on short term or one-time contracts to private companies in the late 20th century. In the early 2000s, these programs began steadily evolving to include longer contracts and more advanced mission capabilities. Civilian contractors such as ATAC, Top Aces, and Draken International are now flying advanced radar equipped aircraft in complex training missions including international large force exercises such as Red Flag, Maple Flag, Frisian Flag, and Tiger Meet. They utilize disarmed ex-military jets or small business jets such as the Lear 35, L-39, Alpha Jet, Hawker Hunter, Saab J35 Draken, BD-5J, IAI Kfir, A-4 Skyhawk, MiG-21, Mirage F1 and even the F-16 to simulate potential enemy aircraft and tactics. By outsourcing these missions, customer governments can save costs, save valuable airframe life on combat fleets, and benefit from the flexibility of civilian operations. They also get the benefit of continuing to draw on the expertise of the contracted pilots, most of whom are highly experienced weapons school graduates, being either retired or still serving officers concurrently flying in the Reserve, Air National Guard or equivalent.

<doc id="1186115" wikidata="Q1145265" url="?curid=1186115" title="Islam in India">
<text>Islam is India&#x27;s second-largest religion, with 14.2% of the country&#x27;s population, or approximately 172.2 million people, identifying as adherents of Islam in a 2011 census. India also has the third-largest number of Muslims in the world. The majority of India&#x27;s Muslims are Sunni, with Shia making up around 15% of the Muslim population.

Islam spread in Indian communities along the Arab coastal trade routes in Gujarat and in Malabar Coast shortly after the religion emerged in the Arabian Peninsula. Islam arrived in the inland of Indian subcontinent in the 7th century when the Arabs invaded and conquered Sindh and later arrived in Punjab and North India in the 12th century via the Ghaznavids and Ghurids conquest and has since become a part of India&#x27;s religious and cultural heritage. The Barwada Mosque in Ghogha, Gujarat built before 623 CE, Cheraman Juma Mosque (629 CE) in Methala, Kerala and Palaiya Jumma Palli (or The Old Jumma Masjid, 628–630 CE) in Kilakarai, Tamil Nadu are three of the first mosques in India which were built by seafaring Arab merchants. According to the legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 CE at Kodungallur in present-day Kerala with the mandate of the last ruler (the Tajudeen Cheraman Perumal) of the Chera dynasty, who converted to Islam during the lifetime of Prophet Muhammad (c. 570–632). Similarly, Tamil Muslims on the eastern coasts also claim that they converted to Islam in Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime. The local mosques date to the early 700s.

==History==
===Origins===
The vast majority of the Muslims in India belong to South Asian ethnic groups. However, some Indian Muslims were found with detectable, traceable levels of gene flow from outside, primarily from the Middle East and Central Asia. However, they are found in very low levels. Sources indicate that the castes among Muslims developed as the result of the concept of Kafa&#x27;a. Those who are referred to as Ashrafs are presumed to have a superior status derived from their foreign Arab ancestry, while the Ajlafs are assumed to be converts from Hinduism, and have a lower status But According to Islamic teachings, Muslims are regarded as one Ummah, and dividing into sects is considered a sin, as it contradicts the unity and brotherhood emphasized in the Quran and Hadith. The Prophet Muhammad, in his final sermon, stated that &quot;no Arab is superior to a non-Arab, neither is a white superior to a black, nor a black to a white, except by piety and good deeds&quot;. Which Emphasize the principle of equality among Muslims.

Many of these ulema also believed that it is best to marry within one&#x27;s own caste. The practice of endogamous marriage in one&#x27;s caste is strictly observed in India. In two of the three genetic studies referenced here, in which is described that samples were taken from several regions of India&#x27;s Muslim communities, it was again found that the Muslim population was overwhelmingly similar to the local non-Muslims associated, with some having minor but still detectable levels of gene flow from outside, primarily from Iran and Central Asia, rather than directly from the Arabian peninsula.

Research on the comparison of Y chromosomes of Indian Muslims with other Indian groups was published in 2005. In this study 124 Sunnis and 154 Shias of Uttar Pradesh were randomly selected for their genetic evaluation. Other than Muslims, Hindu higher and middle caste group members were also selected for the genetic analysis. Out of 1021 samples in this study, only 17 samples showed E haplogroup and all of them were Shias. The very minor increased frequency however, does place these Shias, solely with regards to their haplogroups, closer to Iraqis, Turks and Palestinians.

===Early history of Islam in India===
Trade relations have existed between Arabia and the Indian subcontinent since ancient times. Even in the pre-Islamic era, Arab traders used to visit the Konkan-Gujarat coast and Malabar Coast, which linked them with the ports of Southeast Asia. Newly Islamised Arabs were Islam&#x27;s first contact with India. Historians Elliot and Dowson say in their book &quot;The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians&quot;, that the first ship bearing Muslim travellers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630 CE. H. G. Rawlinson in his book &quot;Ancient and Medieval History of India&quot; claims that the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century CE. This fact is corroborated by J. Sturrock in his &quot;Madras District Manuals&quot; and by Haridas Bhattacharya in &quot;Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV&quot;. With the rise of Islam, Arabs emerged as a significant cultural force on the global stage. Through their extensive trade and commerce networks, Arab merchants and traders became key ambassadors of the faith, shared its teachings wherever they traveled.

According to popular tradition, Islam was brought to Lakshadweep islands, situated just to the west of Malabar Coast, by Ubaidullah in 661 CE. His grave is believed to be located on the island of Andrott. A few Umayyad (661–750 CE) coins were discovered from Kothamangalam in the eastern part of Ernakulam district, Kerala. According to Kerala Muslim tradition, the Masjid Zeenath Baksh at Mangalore is one of the oldest mosques in the Indian subcontinent. According to the Legend of Cheraman Perumals, the first Indian mosque was built in 624 CE at Kodungallur in present-day Kerala with the mandate of the last the ruler (the Cheraman Perumal) of Chera dynasty, who converted to Islam during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (c. 570–632). According to &quot;Qissat Shakarwati Farmad&quot;, the &quot;Masjids&quot; at Kodungallur, Kollam, Madayi, Barkur, Mangalore, Kasaragod, Kannur, Dharmadam, Panthalayini, and Chaliyam, were built during the era of Malik Dinar, and they are among the oldest &quot;Masjid&quot;s in the Indian subcontinent. It is believed that Malik Dinar died at Thalangara in Kasaragod town.

The first Indian mosque, Cheraman Juma Mosque, is thought to have been built in 629 CE by Malik Deenar although some historians say the first mosque was in Gujarat in between 610 and 623 CE. In Malabar, the Mappilas may have been the first community to convert to Islam. Intensive missionary activities were carried out along the coast and many other natives embraced Islam. According to legend, two travellers from India, Moulai Abdullah (formerly known as Baalam Nath) and Maulai Nuruddin (Rupnath), went to the court of Imam Mustansir (427–487 AH)/(1036–1094 CE) and were so impressed that they converted to Islam and came back to preach in India in 467 AH/1073 CE. Moulai Ahmed was their companion. Abadullah was the first Wali-ul-Hind (saint of India). He came across a married couple named Kaka Akela and Kaki Akela who became his first converts in the Taiyabi (Bohra) community.

===Arab–Indian interactions===
Historical evidence shows that Arabs and Muslims interacted with Indians from the early days of Islam and possibly before the arrival of Islam in Arab regions. Arab traders transmitted the numeral system developed by Indians to the Middle East and Europe.

Many Sanskrit books were translated into Arabic as early as the 8th century. George Saliba in his book &quot;Islamic Science and the Making of the European Renaissance&quot;, writes that &quot;some major Sanskrit texts began to be translated during the reign of the second Abbasid caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775), if not before; some texts on logic even before that, and it has been generally accepted that the Persian and Sanskrit texts, few as they were, were indeed the first to be translated.&quot;

Commercial intercourse between Arabia and India had gone on from time immemorial, with for example the sale of dates and aromatic herbs by Arabs traders who came to Indian shores every spring with the advent of the monsoon breeze. People living on the western coast of India were as familiar with the annual coming of Arab traders as they were with the flocks of monsoon birds; they were as ancient a phenomenon as the monsoon itself. However, whereas monsoon birds flew back to Africa after a sojourn of few months, not all traders returned to their homes in the desert; many married Indian women and settled in India.

The advent of Muhammad (569–632 CE) transformed the previously idolatrous and fragmented Arabs into a nation unified by faith and driven by a shared commitment to spreading the message of Islam. Arab merchant seamen, who had long brought goods like dates to South India, now introduced the new religion, which found a warm reception in the region. South Indian communities welcomed the construction of mosques and facilitated cultural integration, including intermarriage between Arabs and local women. This led to the formation of a distinct Indian-Arabian Muslim community. By the early 9th century, Muslim missionaries in Malabar achieved a significant milestone when they inspired the conversion of the local king to Islam.

According to historian Derryl N. Maclean, early connections between Sindh (in present-day Pakistan) and the Shia supporters of Ali can be traced to Hakim ibn Jabalah al-Abdi. A companion of Muhammad, Hakim traveled through Sind to Makran in 649 CE, reporting on the region to the Caliph. A devoted supporter of Ali, Hakim died in the Battle of the Camel alongside Sindhi Jats. He was also a poet and few couplets of his poem in praise of Ali ibn Abu Talib have survived, as reported in Chachnama.

During Ali&#x27;s leadership, numerous Jats in Sind embraced Islam, influenced by the efforts of figures like Harith ibn Murrah al-Abdi and Sayfi ibn Fil&#x27; al-Shaybani, officers in Ali’s army. In 658 CE, they led campaigns against Sindhi bandits, pursuing them as far as Al-Qiqan (modern-day Quetta). Sayfi was later killed in 660 CE near Damascus as one of seven loyal companions of Ali who were beheaded alongside Hujr ibn Adi al-Kindi. in 660 CE, near Damascus.

===Political history of Islam in India===

Muhammad bin Qasim (672 CE), at the age of 17, was the first Muslim general to invade the Indian subcontinent, managing to reach Sindh. In the first half of the 8th century CE, a series of battles took place between the Umayyad Caliphate and the Indian kingdoms; resulted in Umayyad campaigns in India checked and contained to Sindh. Around the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic empire, the Ghaznavids, under Mahmud of Ghazni (971–1030 CE), was the second, much more ferocious invader, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia&#x27;s north-western plains. Eventually, under the Ghurids, the Muslim army broke into the North Indian Plains, which lead to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206 by the slaves of the Ghurid dynasty. The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. However, internal squabbling resulted in the decline of the sultanate, and new Muslim sultanates such as the Bengal Sultanate in the east breaking off, while in the Deccan the Urdu-speaking colonists from Delhi, who carried the Urdu language to the Deccan, founded the Bahmanid Empire. In 1339, Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, inaugurating the &quot;Salatin-i-Kashmir&quot; or Shah Mir dynasty.

Under the Delhi Sultanate, there was a synthesis of Indian civilization with that of Islamic civilization, and the integration of the Indian subcontinent with a growing world system and wider international networks spanning large parts of Afro-Eurasia, which had a significant impact on Indian culture and society. The time period of their rule included the earliest forms of Indo-Islamic architecture, increased growth rates in India&#x27;s population and economy, and the emergence of the Hindustani language. The Delhi Sultanate was also responsible for repelling the Mongol Empire&#x27;s potentially devastating invasions of India in the 13th and 14th centuries. The period coincided with a greater use of mechanical technology in the Indian subcontinent. From the 13th century onwards, India began widely adopting mechanical technologies from the Islamic world, including water-raising wheels with gears and pulleys, machines with cams and cranks, papermaking technology, and the spinning wheel.

In the early 16th century, northern India, being then under mainly Muslim rulers, fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors. The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule, but rather balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices and diverse and inclusive ruling elites, leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status. The Mughal state&#x27;s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency, caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets. The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India&#x27;s economic expansion, resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture. The Mughal Empire was the world&#x27;s largest economy in the 17th century, larger than Qing China and Western Europe, with Mughal India producing about a quarter of the world&#x27;s economic and industrial output.

In the 18th century, Mughal power had become severely limited. By the mid-18th century, the Marathas had routed Mughal armies and invaded several Mughal provinces from the Punjab to Bengal. By this time, the dominant economic powers in the Indian subcontinent were Bengal Subah under the Nawabs of Bengal and the South Indian Kingdom of Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, before the former was devastated by the Maratha invasions of Bengal, leading to the economy of the Kingdom of Mysore overtaking Bengal. The British East India Company conquered Bengal in 1757 and then Mysore in the late 18th century. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah II, had authority over only the city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanabad), before he was exiled to Burma by the British Raj after the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

===Role in the Indian independence movement===

The contribution of Muslim revolutionaries, poets and writers is documented in the history of India&#x27;s struggle for independence. Titumir raised a revolt against the British Raj. Abul Kalam Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan and Rafi Ahmed Kidwai are other Muslims who engaged in this endeavour. Ashfaqulla Khan of Shahjahanpur conspired to loot the British treasury at Kakori(Lucknow) (See Kakori conspiracy). Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan (popularly known as &quot;Frontier Gandhi&quot;) was a noted nationalist who spent 45 of his 95 years of life in jail; Barakatullah of Bhopal was one of the founders of the Ghadar Party, which created a network of anti-British organisations; Syed Rahmat Shah of the Ghadar Party worked as an underground revolutionary in France and was hanged for his part in the unsuccessful Ghadar Mutiny in 1915; Ali Ahmad Siddiqui of Faizabad (UP) planned the Indian Mutiny in Malaya and Burma, along with Syed Mujtaba Hussain of Jaunpur, and was hanged in 1917; Vakkom Abdul Khadir of Kerala participated in the &quot;Quit India&quot; struggle in 1942 and was hanged; Umar Subhani, an industrialist and millionaire from Bombay, provided Mahatma Gandhi with Congress expenses and ultimately died for the cause of independence. Among Muslim women, Hazrat Mahal, Asghari Begum, and Bi Amma contributed in the struggle for independence from the British.
Other famous Muslims who fought for independence against British rule were Abul Kalam Azad, Mahmud al-Hasan of Darul Uloom Deoband, who was implicated in the famous Silk Letter Movement to overthrow the British through an armed struggle, Husain Ahmad Madani, former Shaikhul Hadith of Darul Uloom Deoband, Ubaidullah Sindhi, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Hasrat Mohani, Syed Mahmud, Ahmadullah Shah, Professor Maulavi Barkatullah, Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi, Zakir Husain, Saifuddin Kitchlew, Vakkom Abdul Khadir, Manzoor Abdul Wahab, Bahadur Shah Zafar, Hakeem Nusrat Husain, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai, Colonel Shahnawaz, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed, Ansar Harwani, Tak Sherwani, Nawab Viqarul Mulk, Nawab Mohsinul Mulk, Mustsafa Husain, V. M. Obaidullah, S.R. Rahim, Badruddin Tyabji, Abid Hasan and Moulvi Abdul Hamid.

Until 1920, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, later the founder of Pakistan, was a member of the Indian National Congress and was part of the independence struggle. Muhammad Iqbal, poet and philosopher, was a strong proponent of Hindu–Muslim unity and an undivided India, perhaps until 1930. Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy was also active in the Indian National Congress in Bengal, during his early political career. Mohammad Ali Jouhar and Shaukat Ali struggled for the emancipation of the Muslims in the overall Indian context, and struggled for independence alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Abdul Bari of Firangi Mahal. Until the 1930s, the Muslims of India broadly conducted their politics alongside their countrymen, in the overall context of an undivided India.

=== Partition of India ===

The partition of British India led to the creation of the dominions of Pakistan (that later split into the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh) and India (later Republic of India). The Indian Independence Act 1947 had decided 15 August 1947, as the appointed date for the partition. However, Pakistan celebrates its day of creation on 14 August.

The partition of India was set forth in the Act and resulted in the dissolution of the British Indian Empire and the end of the British Raj. It resulted in a struggle between the newly constituted states of India and Pakistan and displaced up to 12.5 million people with estimates of loss of life varying from several hundred thousand to a million (most estimates of the numbers of people who crossed the boundaries between India and Pakistan in 1947 range between 10 and 12 million). The violent nature of the partition created an atmosphere of mutual hostility and suspicion between India and Pakistan that plagues their relationship to this day.
The partition included the geographical division of the Bengal province into East Bengal, which became part of Pakistan (from 1956, East Pakistan). West Bengal became part of India, and a similar partition of the Punjab province became West Punjab (later the Pakistani Punjab and Islamabad Capital Territory) and East Punjab (later the Indian Punjab, as well as Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). The partition agreement also included the division of Indian government assets, including the Indian Civil Service, the Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Indian railways and the central treasury, and other administrative services.

The two self-governing countries of India and Pakistan legally came into existence at the stroke of midnight on 14–15 August 1947. The ceremonies for the transfer of power were held a day earlier in Karachi, at the time the capital of the new state of Pakistan, so that the last British Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten of Burma, could attend both the ceremony in Karachi and the ceremony in Delhi. Thus, Pakistan&#x27;s Independence Day is celebrated on 14 August and India&#x27;s on 15 August.

After Partition of India in 1947, two-thirds of the Muslims resided in Pakistan (both east and West Pakistan) but a third resided in India. Based on 1951 census of displaced persons, 7,226,000 Muslims went to Pakistan (both West and East) from India while 7,249,000 Hindus and Sikhs moved to India from Pakistan (both West and East). Some critics allege that British haste in the partition process increased the violence that followed. Because independence was declared &quot;prior&quot; to the actual Partition, it was up to the new governments of India and Pakistan to keep public order. No large population movements were contemplated; the plan called for safeguards for minorities on both sides of the new border. It was a task at which both states failed. There was a complete breakdown of law and order; many died in riots, massacre, or just from the hardships of their flight to safety. What ensued was one of the largest population movements in recorded history. According to Richard Symonds: At the lowest estimate, half a million people perished and twelve million became homeless.

However, many argue that the British were forced to expedite the Partition by events on the ground. Once in office, Mountbatten quickly became aware if Britain were to avoid involvement in a civil war, which seemed increasingly likely, there was no alternative to partition and a hasty exit from India. Law and order had broken down many times before Partition with much bloodshed on both sides. A massive civil war was looming by the time Mountbatten became Viceroy. After the Second World War, Britain had limited resources, perhaps insufficient to the task of keeping order. Another viewpoint is that while Mountbatten may have been too hasty he had no real options left and achieved the best he could under difficult circumstances. The historian Lawrence James concurs that in 1947 Mountbatten was left with no option but to cut and run. The alternative seemed to be involvement in a potentially bloody civil war from which it would be difficult to get out.

==Demographics==

With around 204 million Muslims (2019 estimate), India&#x27;s Muslim population is the world&#x27;s third-largest and the world&#x27;s largest Muslim-minority population. India is home to 10.9% of the world&#x27;s Muslim population. Indian Muslims have a fertility rate of 2.36, the highest in the nation as per as according to year 2019-21 estimation. In 2023, the Government of India estimated the Muslim population at 19.75 to 20 crore, out of 138.8 to 140.0 crore total population, thus constituting around (14.22%–14.28%) of the nation&#x27;s population.

Muslim populations (top 5 countries) Est. 2020
Muslims represent a majority of the local population in Lakshadweep (96.2%) and Jammu and Kashmir (68.3%). The largest concentration – about 47% of all Muslims in India, live in the three states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Bihar. High concentrations of Muslims are also found in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, and Uttarakhand.

===Percentage by states===

, Muslims comprise the majority of the population in the only Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir and in a Union territory Lakshadweep. In 110 minority-concentrated districts, at least a fifth of the population are Muslim.
===Population growth rate===

Region-wise distribution of Muslims leaving for Pakistan (1951 Census) -
After India&#x27;s Independence and the creation of Pakistan in 1947, the Muslim population in India declined from 42,400,000 (13.3%) in 1941 to 35,400,000 (9.8%) in the 1951 census due to the Partition of India. The Pakistan Census, 1951 identified the number of displaced persons in the country at 7,226,600, presumably all Muslims refugees who had entered Pakistan from India. Around 35 million Muslims stayed back after Partition as Jawaharlal Nehru (then the Prime Minister of India) have ensured the confidence that they would be treated fairly in this democratic nation.

In the 1941 Census, there were 94.5 million Muslims living in the Undivided India (inc. Pakistan and Bangladesh), comprising 24 percent of the population. Partition, in fact, has eventually drained India of 60% of its Muslim population respectively. 

Former Minister of Law and Justice of India, Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar during partition, have advocated for a full population exchange between the Muslim and Hindu minorities of India and Pakistan for maintenance of law, order and peace in both the newly formed nations by citing- &quot;That the transfer of minorities is the only lasting remedy for communal peace is beyond doubt&quot; in his own written book &quot;Pakistan or partition of India&quot; respectively.

However, a complete population exchange did not occur and was made impossible due to the earlier signing of the Liaquat–Nehru Pact in 1950, which sealed the borders of both nations completely. Ultimately, this led to the cessation of migration of refugees from both sides. As a result of this, a large number of Muslims in India, a significant number of Hindus in East Pakistan (present-day Bangladesh) and a minuscule number of Hindus in the Sindh province of West Pakistan remained. Meanwhile, the East Punjab state of India and the West Punjab province of Pakistan saw a full population exchange between Muslim and Hindu/Sikh minorities during the time of Partition.

===Illegal immigrants===
India is the home of some 40,000 illegal Rohingya Muslim refugees, with approximately 18,000 registered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). But even people with refugee cards are being detained across India due to security concerns. A small number of Uyghurs also reside in India, primarily in Jammu and Kashmir. Around 1,000 illegal Uyghur refugees arrived in India in 1949 to escape the communist regime. On 17 November 2016, Union Minister of State for Home, Kiren Rijiju, stated in the Rajya Sabha that, according to available inputs, there are around 20 million (2 crore) illegal Bangladeshi migrants staying in India. Illegal immigrants in Assam are estimated to number between 16 lakh and 84 lakh, in a total population of 3.12 crore according to the 2011 Census. A report published by DNA has revealed that the Bangladeshi-origin Muslim population has grown to 5–7% in bordering districts of Assam and Bengal simultaneously. Muminul Aowal, an eminent Assamese Muslim Minority Development Board Chairman, has reported that Assam has about 1.3 crore Muslims of which around 90 lakh are of Bangladeshi origin. According to Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, among the 19 lakh individuals excluded from the Assam National Register of Citizens, 7 lakh are Muslims. Dr. Kuntal Kanti Chattoraj, HOD of Geography at P.R.M.S. Mahavidyalaya, Bankura, estimates that around 6.28 million Bangladeshi Muslims have migrated to West Bengal over the decades.

===Projections===

Muslims in India have a much higher total fertility rate (TFR) compared to that of other religious communities in the country. Because of higher birthrates the percentage of Muslims in India has risen from about 9.8% in 1951 to 14.2% by 2011. However, since 1991, the largest decline in fertility rates among all religious groups in India has occurred among Muslims. The Sachar Committee Report shows that the Muslim Population Growth has slowed down and will be on par with national averages. The Sachar Committee Report estimated that the Muslim proportion will stabilise at between 17% and 21% of the Indian population by 2100. Pew Research Center have projected that India will have 311 million Muslims by 2050, out of total 1.668 billion people, thus constituting 18.4% of the country&#x27;s population. The United Nations has projected India&#x27;s population to rise to 170.53 crore by 2050, and then fall to 165.97 crore by 2100.

===Religiosity===
On 29 June 2021, Pew Research Center reports on Religiosity have been published, where they completed 29,999 face-to-face interviews with non-institutionalized adults ages 18 and older living in 26 states and three union territories across India. They interviewed 3,336 Muslims and found that 79% of those interviewed believed in the existence of God with absolute certainty, 12% believes in the existence of God with less certainty and 6% of the Indian Muslims have declared themselves as Atheists by citing that they don&#x27;t believe in any God. However 91% of Muslim interviewed have said religion plays a big part in their lives.

CSDS study reports, have found that Indian Muslims have become ‘less religious’ since 2016. In that same year, the study founds that 97 per cent of Muslim respondents have said that they prayed regularly. However, in 2021, it was found that only 86 per cent of Muslim youth prayed regularly which is an absolute decline of 11 percentage points from the last five years respectively.

Social and economic reasons behind population growth

According to sociologists Roger and Patricia Jeffery, socio-economic factors, rather than religious determinism, play a more significant role in explaining the higher birthrates among Indian Muslims. Studies suggest that Muslims in India tend to have lower income levels and educational attainment compared to Hindus. However, B. K. Prasad, a noted Indian sociologist, highlights that due to the higher urbanization among Indian Muslims, their infant mortality rate is about 12% lower than that of Hindus.

However, some sociologists suggest that religious and cultural factors may also contribute to higher birthrates among Muslims in India. Surveys indicate that, on average, Muslim families are more traditional in their approach to family planning, and Muslim women tend to marry at a younger age compared to Hindu women, leading to a longer fertility period.

On the other hand, it is also documented that Muslims tend to adopt family planning measures. A study conducted by K. C. Zacharia in Kerala in 1983 revealed that on average, the number of children born to a Muslim woman was 4.1 while a Hindu woman gave birth to only 2.9 children. Religious customs and marriage practices were cited as some of the reasons behind the high Muslim birth rate. According to Paul Kurtz, Muslims in India are much more resistant to modern contraception than are Hindus and, as a consequence, the decline in fertility rate among Hindu women is much higher compared to that of Muslim women.

The National Family and Health survey conducted in 1998–99 highlighted that Indian Muslim couples consider a substantially higher number of children to be ideal for a family as compared to Hindu couples in India. The same survey also pointed out that percentage of couples actively using family planning measures was more than 49% among Hindus against 37% among Muslims. According to a district wise fertility study by Saswata Ghosh, Muslim TFR (total fertility rate) is closer to that of the Hindu community in most southern states. Also TFR tends to be high for both communities in Northern states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. This study was based on the last census of the country from 2011.

==Denominations==
There are two major denominations amongst Indian Muslims: Sunni and Shia. The majority of Indian Muslims (over 85%) belong to the Sunni branch of Islam, while a minority (over 13%) belong to the Shia branch.

===Sunni===
The majority of Indian Sunnis follow the Barelvi movement which was founded in 1904 by Ahmed Razi Khan of Bareilly in defense of traditional Islam as understood and practised in South Asia and in reaction to the revivalist attempts of the Deobandi movement. In the 19th century the Deobandi, a revivalist movement in Sunni Islam was established in India. It is named after Deoband a small town northeast of Delhi, where the original madrasa or seminary of the movement was founded. From its early days this movement has been influenced by Wahhabism. 

In the coastal Konkan region of Maharashtra, the local Konkani Muslims follow the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence.

===Shia===

Shia Muslims are a large minority among India&#x27;s Muslims forming about 13% of the total Muslim population. However, there has been no particular census conducted in India regarding sects, but Indian sources like Times of India and Daily News and Analysis reported Indian Shia population in mid 2005–2006 to be up to 25% of the entire Muslim population of India which accounts them in numbers between 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 of 157,000,000 Indian Muslim population. However, as per an estimation of one reputed Shia NGO Alimaan Trust, India&#x27;s Shia population in early 2000 was around 30 million with Sayyids comprising just a tenth of the Shia population. According to some national and international sources Indian Shia population is the world&#x27;s second-largest after Iran.

====Bohra====

Bohra Shia was established in Gujarat in the second half of the 11th century. This community&#x27;s belief system originates in Yemen, evolved from the Fatimid were persecuted due to their adherence to Fatimid Shia Islam leading the shift of Dawoodi Bohra to India. After occultation of their 21st Fatimid Imam Tayyib, they follow Dai as representative of Imam which are continued till date.

Dā&#x27;ī Zoeb appointed Maulai Yaqoob (after the death of Maulai Abdullah), who was the second Walī al-Hind of the Fatimid dawat. Moulai Yaqoob was the first person of Indian origin to receive this honour under the Dā&#x27;ī. He was the son of Moulai Bharmal, minister of Hindu Solanki King Jayasimha Siddharaja (Anhalwara, Patan). With Minister Moulai Tarmal, they had honoured the Fatimid dawat along with their fellow citizens on the call of Moulai Abdullah. Syedi Fakhruddin, son of Moulai Tarmal, was sent to western Rajasthan, India, and Moulai Nuruddin went to the Deccan (death: Jumadi al-Ula 11 at Don Gaum, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India).

One Dai succeeded another until the 23rd Dai in Yemen. In India also Wali-ul-Hind were appointed by them one after another until Wali-ul-Hind Moulai Qasim Khan bin Hasan (11th and last Wali-ul-Hind, d. 950 AH, Ahmedabad).

Due to persecution by the local Zaydi Shi&#x27;a ruler in Yemen, the 24th Dai, Yusuf Najmuddin ibn Sulaiman (d. 1567 CE), moved the whole administration of the &quot;Dawat&quot; (mission) to India. The 25th Dai Jalal Shamshuddin (d. 1567 CE) was first dai to die in India. His mausoleum is in Ahmedabad, India. The Dawat subsequently moved from Ahmedabad to Jamnagar Mandvi, Burhanpur, Surat and finally to Mumbai and continues there to the present day, currently headed by 53rd Dai.

Asaf Ali Asghar Fyzee was a Bohra and 20th century Islamic scholar from India who promoted modernization and liberalization of Islam through his writings. He argued that with changing time modern reforms in Islam are necessary without compromising on basic &quot;spirit of Islam&quot;.

====Khojas====
The Khojas are a group of diverse people who converted to Islam in South Asia. In India, most Khojas live in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and the city of Hyderabad. Many Khojas have also migrated and settled over the centuries in East Africa, Europe, and North America. The Khoja were by then adherents of Nizari Ismailism branch of Shi&#x27;ism. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the aftermath of the Aga Khan case, a significant minority separated and adopted Twelver Shi&#x27;ism or Sunni Islam, while the majority remained Nizārī Ismā&#x27;īlī.

===Sufis===
Sufis (Islamic mystics) played an important role in the spread of Islam in India. They were very successful in spreading Islam, as many aspects of Sufi belief systems and practices had their parallels in Indian philosophical literature, in particular nonviolence and monism. The Sufis&#x27; orthodox approach towards Islam made it easier for Hindus to practice. Sulthan Syed Ibrahim Shaheed, Hazrat Khawaja Muin-ud-din Chishti, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, Nizamuddin Auliya, Shah Jalal, Amir Khusrow, Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari, Shekh Alla-ul-Haq Pandwi, Ashraf Jahangir Semnani, Waris Ali Shah, Ata Hussain Fani Chishti trained Sufis for the propagation of Islam in different parts of India. The Sufi movement also attracted followers from the artisan and untouchable communities; they played a crucial role in bridging the distance between Islam and the indigenous traditions. Ahmad Sirhindi, a prominent member of the Naqshbandi Sufi advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam.

===Ahmadiyya===

The Ahmadiyya movement was founded in 1889 by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. He claimed to be the promised messiah and mahdi awaited by the Muslims and obtained a considerable number of followers initially within the United Provinces, the Punjab and Sindh. Ahmadis claim the Ahmadiyya movement to embody the latter day revival of Islam and the movement has also been seen to have emerged as an Islamic religious response to the Christian and Arya Samaj missionary activity that was widespread in 19th century India. After the death of Ghulam Ahmad, his successors directed the Ahmadiyya Community from Qadian which remained the headquarters of the community until 1947 with the creation of Pakistan. The movement has grown in organisational strength and in its own missionary programme and has expanded to over 200 countries as of 2014 but has received a largely negative response from mainstream Muslims who see it as heretical, due mainly to Ghulam Ahmad&#x27;s claim to be a prophet within Islam.

Ahmaddiya have been identified as sects of Islam in 2011 Census of India apart from Sunnis, Shias, Bohras and Agakhanis. India has a significant Ahmadiyya population. Most of them live in Rajasthan, Odisha, Haryana, Bihar, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and a few in Punjab in the area of Qadian. In India, Ahmadis are considered to be Muslims by the Government of India (unlike in neighbouring Pakistan). This recognition is supported by a court verdict (Shihabuddin Koya vs. Ahammed Koya, A.I.R. 1971 Ker 206). There is no legislation that declares Ahmadis non-Muslims or limits their activities, but they are not allowed to sit on the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, a body of religious leaders India&#x27;s government recognises as representative of Indian Muslims. Ahmadiyya are estimated to be from 60,000 to 1 million in India.

===Quranists===
Non-sectarian Muslims who reject the authority of hadith, known as Quranists, Quraniyoon, or Ahle Quran, are also present in India. In South Asia during the 19th century, the Ahle Quran movement formed partially in reaction to the Ahle Hadith movement whom they considered to be placing too much emphasis on hadith. Notable Indian Quranists include Chiragh Ali, Aslam Jairajpuri, Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din, and Abdullah Chakralawi.

===Islamic traditions in India===
Sufism is a mystical dimension of Islam, often complementary with the legalistic path of the sharia had a profound impact on the growth of Islam in India. A Sufi attains a direct vision of oneness with God, often on the edges of orthodox behaviour, and can thus become a Pir (living saint) who may take on disciples (murids) and set up a spiritual lineage that can last for generations. Orders of Sufis became important in India during the thirteenth century following the ministry of Moinuddin Chishti (1142–1236), who settled in Ajmer and attracted large numbers of converts to Islam because of his holiness. His Chishti Order went on to become the most influential Sufi lineage in India, although other orders from Central Asia and Southwest Asia also reached India and played a major role in the spread of Islam. In this way, they created a large literature in regional languages that embedded Islamic culture deeply into older South Asian traditions.

===Intra-Muslim relations===
====Shia–Sunni relations====
The Sunnis and Shia are the biggest Muslim groups by denomination. Although the two groups remain cordial, there have been instances of conflict between the two groups, especially in the city of Lucknow.

==Society and culture==
===Religious administration===

The religious administration of each state is headed by the &quot;Mufti of the State&quot; under the supervision of the Grand Mufti of India, the most senior, most influential religious authority and spiritual leader of Muslims in India. The system is executed in India from the Mughal period.

===Leadership and organisations===

* The Ajmer Sharif Dargah and Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat at Bareilly Shareef are prime center of Sufi oriented Sunni Muslims of India.
* Indian Shia Muslims form a substantial minority within the Muslim community of India comprising between 25 and 31% of total Muslim population in an estimation done during mid-2005 to 2006 of the then Indian Muslim population of 157 million. Sources like The Times of India and DNA reported Indian Shia population during that period between 40,000,000 to 50,000,000 of 157,000,000 Indian Muslim population.
*The Deobandi movement, another section of the Sunni Muslim population, originate from the Darul Uloom Deoband, an influential religious seminary in the district of Saharanpur of Uttar Pradesh. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, founded by Deobandi scholars in 1919, became a political mouthpiece for the Darul Uloom.
* The Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, founded in 1941, advocates the establishment of an Islamic government and has been active in promoting education, social service and ecumenical outreach to the community.

===Caste system among Indian Muslims===
Although Islam requires egalitarianism and is against discrimination based on caste, creed or race, the caste system among have developed among some Indian Muslims that deals with units of social stratification.

Some Muslim scholars have tried to reconcile and resolve the &quot;disjunction between Quranic egalitarianism and Indian Muslim social practice&quot; through theorizing it in different ways and interpreting the Quran and Sharia to justify casteism.

====Stratification====
In parts of South Asia, Muslims are categorized into groups like Ashrafs and Ajlafs. Ashrafs often claim foreign ancestry and are divided into various occupational castes. Historian Ziauddin Barani emphasized caste distinctions, advocating higher status for the &quot;sons of Muhammad&quot; (Sayyids) and proposing that state laws (zawabi) enforce these divisions, even over Sharia in some cases. He attributed &quot;ignoble&quot; professions to the Ajlaf and sought religious endorsement for this hierarchy. Barani also developed a caste-based framework for appointing and promoting imperial officers (wazirs).

Beyond the Ashraf/Ajlaf divide, the Arzal caste represents groups associated with professions deemed menial, such as waste disposal. Anti-caste activist Babasaheb Ambedkar likened the Arzal to untouchables. The term &quot;Arzal,&quot; meaning &quot;degraded,&quot; encompasses subdivisions like the Bhanar, Halalkhor, Hijra, Kasbi, Lalbegi, Maugta, and Mehtar, reflecting the persistence of caste-based stratification in parts of the Muslim community.

South Asian Muslims have also been known to organize their society through &quot;qaums&quot; or communal groups. Studies of Bengali Muslims in India reveal that notions of purity and impurity continue to influence inter-group relationships, with social status often tied to perceived cleanliness rather than economic conditions. Among Indian Muslims, there are also distinctions like the Muslim Rajputs, as well as upper and middle-caste communities such as Syed, Shaikh, Shaikhzada, Khanzada, Pathan, Mughal, and Malik. Genetic data has also supported this stratification. Genetic studies of South Asian Muslims have supported the existence of these stratifications, showing that their genetic makeup closely resembles that of local non-Muslims, with small but notable influences from Iran and Central Asia rather than the Arabian Peninsula.

Some scholars argue that caste discrimination among Muslims is less severe than in Hindu society,[22][215] but Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar disagreed, claiming that social injustices within Muslim society were &quot;worse than those seen in Hindu society.&quot;[209] He criticized the Ashraf community for their hostility towards the Ajlaf and Arzal groups and condemned the Muslim community for failing to implement needed reforms.

====Interaction and mobility====
Data indicates that the castes among Muslims have never been as rigid as that among Hindus. They have good interactions with the other communities. They participate in marriages and funerals and other religious and social events in other communities. Some of them also had inter-caste marriages since centuries but mostly they preferred to marry in the same caste with a significant number of marriages being consanguineous. In Bihar state of India, cases had been reported in which the higher caste Muslims have opposed the burials of lower caste Muslims in the same graveyard.

Some scholars argue that caste discrimination among Muslims is less severe than in Hindu society,] but Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar disagreed, claiming that social injustices within Muslim society were &quot;worse than those seen in Hindu society.&quot; He criticized the Ashraf community for their hostility towards the Ajlaf and Arzal groups.

===Segregation===
Segregation of Indian Muslims from other communities began in the mid-1970s when the first communal riots occurred. This was heightened after the 1989 Bhagalpur violence in Bihar and became a trend after the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992. Soon several major cities developed ghettos, or segregated areas, where the Muslim population moved into. This trend, however, did not help with the anticipated security the anonymity of ghetto was thought to have provided. During the 2002 Gujarat riots, several such ghettos became easy targets for the rioting mobs, as they enabled the profiling of residential colonies. This kind of ghettoisation can be seen in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and many cities of Gujarat where a clear socio-cultural demarcation exists between Hindu-dominated and Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods.

In places like Gujarat, riots and alienation of Muslims have led to large-scale ghettoisation of the community. For example, the Juhapura area of Ahmadabad has swelled from 250,000 to 650,000 residents since 2002 riots. Muslims in Gujarat have no option but to head to a ghetto, irrespective of their economic and professional status.

An increase in ghetto living has also shown a strengthening of stereotyping due to a lack of cross-cultural interaction, and reduction in economic and educational opportunities at large. Secularism in India is being seen by some as a favour to the Muslims, and not an imperative for democracy.

===Consanguineous marriages===
The NFHS (National Family Health Survey) on 1992-93 showed that 22 per cent of marriages in India were consanguineous, with the highest per cent recorded in Jammu and Kashmir, a Muslim majority state. Post partition percentage of consanguineous marriages in Delhi Sunni Muslims has risen to 37.84 per cent. As per Nasir, such unions are perceived to be exploitative as they perpetuate the existing power structures within the family.

===Art and architecture===


Architecture of India took new shape with the advent of Islamic rule in India towards the end of the 12th century CE. New elements were introduced into the Indian architecture that include: use of shapes (instead of natural forms); inscriptional art using decorative lettering or calligraphy; inlay decoration and use of coloured marble, painted plaster and brightly coloured glazed tiles. Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque built in 1193 CE was the first mosque to be built in the Indian subcontinent; its adjoining &quot;Tower of Victory&quot;, the Qutb Minar also started around 1192 CE, which marked the victory of Muhammad of Ghor and his general Qutb al-Din Aibak, from Ghazni, Afghanistan, over local Rajput kings, is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Delhi.

In contrast to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted as a method of bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar for the first time in the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the knowledge and skill possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.

Islamic architecture in India can be divided into two parts: religious and secular. Mosques and Tombs represent the religious architecture, while palaces and forts are examples of secular Islamic architecture. Forts were essentially functional, complete with a little township within and various fortifications to engage and repel the enemy.

====Mosques====
There are more than 300,000 active mosques in India, which is higher than any other country, including the Muslim world. The mosque or masjid is a representation of Muslim art in its simplest form. The mosque is basically an open courtyard surrounded by a pillared verandah, crowned off with a dome. A &quot;mihrab&quot; indicates the direction of the &quot;qibla&quot; for prayer. Towards the right of the &quot;mihrab&quot; stands the &quot;minbar&quot; or pulpit from where the &quot;Imam&quot; presides over the proceedings. An elevated platform, usually a minaret from where the Faithful are summoned to attend prayers is an invariable part of a mosque. Large mosques where the faithful assemble for the Friday prayers are called the Jama Masjids.

====Tombs and mausoleum====
The tomb or maqbara could range from being a simple affair (Aurangazeb&#x27;s grave) to an awesome structure enveloped in grandeur (Taj Mahal). The tomb usually consists of a solitary compartment or tomb chamber known as the &quot;huzrah&quot; in whose centre is the cenotaph or &quot;zarih&quot;. This entire structure is covered with an elaborate dome. In the underground chamber lies the mortuary or the &quot;maqbara&quot;, in which the corpse is buried in a grave or &quot;qabr&quot;. Smaller tombs may have a &quot;mihrab&quot;, although larger mausoleums have a separate mosque located at a distance from the main tomb. Normally the whole tomb complex or &quot;rauza&quot; is surrounded by an enclosure. The tomb of a Muslim saint is called a dargah. Almost all Islamic monuments were subjected to free use of verses from the Quran and a great amount of time was spent in carving out minute details on walls, ceilings, pillars and domes.

====Styles of Islamic architecture in India====
Islamic architecture in India can be classified into three sections: Delhi or the imperial style (1191–1557 CE); the provincial style, encompassing the surrounding areas like Ahmedabad, Jaunpur and the Deccan; and the Mughal architecture style (1526–1707 CE).

==Law, politics, and government==
Certain civil matters of jurisdiction for Muslims such as marriage, inheritance and waqf properties are governed by the Muslim Personal Law, which was developed during British rule and subsequently became part of independent India with some amendments. Indian Muslim personal law is not developed as a Sharia law but as an interpretation of existing Muslim laws as part of common law. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that Sharia or Muslim law holds precedence for Muslims over Indian civil law in such matters.

Muslims in India are governed by &quot;The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937.&quot; It directs the application of Muslim Personal Law to Muslims in marriage, mahr (dower), divorce, maintenance, gifts, waqf, wills and inheritance. The courts generally apply the Hanafi Sunni law for Sunnis; Shia Muslims are independent of Sunni law for those areas where Shia law differs substantially from Sunni practice.

The Indian constitution provides equal rights to all citizens irrespective of their religion. Article 44 of the constitution recommends a uniform civil code. However, attempts by successive political leadership in the country to integrate Indian society under a common civil code is strongly resisted and is viewed by Indian Muslims as an attempt to dilute the cultural identity of the minority groups of the country. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board was established for the protection and continued applicability of &quot;Muslim Personal Law&quot;, i.e. Shariat Application Act in India. The Sachar Committee was asked to report about the condition of Muslims in India in 2005. Almost all the recommendations of the Sachar Committee have been implemented.

The following laws/acts of Indian legislation are applicable to Muslims in India (except in the state of Goa) regarding matters of marriage, succession, inheritance, child adoption etc.

# Muslim Personal Law Sharia Application Act, 1937
# The Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939
# Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986

Note: the above laws are not applicable in the state of Goa. The Goa civil code, also called the Goa Family Law, is the set of civil laws that governs the residents of the Indian state of Goa. In India, as a whole, there are religion-specific civil codes that separately govern adherents of different religions. Goa is an exception to that rule, in that a single secular code/law governs all Goans, irrespective of religion, ethnicity or linguistic affiliation. The above laws are also not applicable to Muslims throughout India who had civil marriages under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.

Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan is an Indian Muslim women&#x27;s organisation in India. It released a draft on 23 June 2014, &#x27;Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act&#x27;, recommending that polygamy be made illegal in the Muslim Personal Law of India.

Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was proposed for the changes in the citizenship and immigration norms of the country by relaxing the requirements for Indian citizenship. The applicability of the amendments are debated in news as it is on religious lines (excluding Muslims).

India&#x27;s Constitution and Parliament have protected the rights of Muslims but, according to some sources, there has been a growth in a &#x27;climate of fear&#x27; and &#x27;targeting of dissenters&#x27; under the Bharatiya Janata Party and Modi ministry, affecting the feelings of security and tolerance amongst Indian Muslims. However, these allegations are not universally supported.

===Active Muslim political parties===
* All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), led by Asaduddin Owaisi; active in states of Telangana, Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka
* Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), led by E. Ahamed active in Kerala
* All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), led by Badruddin Ajmal active in Assam state
*Jammu and Kashmir People&#x27;s Conference (JKPC), founded by Abdul Ghani Lone and Molvi Iftikhar Hussain Ansari. Led by Sajjad Lone. It is active in Jammu and Kashmir.
* National Conference (NC) main party of Jammu and Kashmir
* People&#x27;s Democratic Party (PDP) main party of Jammu and Kashmir
* Apni Party (JKAP) a newly formed party of Jammu and Kashmir
* Peace Party of India of Mohamed Ayub

===Muslims in government===
India has seen three Muslim presidents and many chief ministers of State Governments have been Muslims. Apart from that, there are and have been many Muslim ministers, both at the centre and at the state level. Out of the 12 Presidents of the Republic of India, three were Muslims – Zakir Husain, Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed and A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. Additionally, Mohammad Hidayatullah, Aziz Mushabber Ahmadi, Mirza Hameedullah Beg and Altamas Kabir held the office of the Chief Justice of India on various occasions since independence. Mohammad Hidayatullah also served as the acting President of India on two separate occasions; and holds the distinct honour of being the only person to have served in all three offices of the President of India, the Vice-President of India and the Chief Justice of India.

The former Vice-President of India, Mohammad Hamid Ansari, former Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid and former Director (Head) of the Intelligence Bureau, Syed Asif Ibrahim are Muslims. Ibrahim was the first Muslim to hold this office. From 30 July 2010 to 10 June 2012, Dr. S. Y. Quraishi served as the Chief Election Commissioner of India. He was the first Muslim to serve in this position. Prominent Indian bureaucrats and diplomats include Abid Hussain, Ali Yavar Jung and Asaf Ali. Zafar Saifullah was Cabinet Secretary of the Government of India from 1993 to 1994. Salman Haidar was the Foreign Secretary from 1995 to 1997 and Deputy Permanent Representative of India to the United Nations. Tayyab Husain was the only politician in Indian history to serve as a Cabinet Minister in the government of three different states at different times. (Undivided Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana). Influential Muslim politicians in India include Sheikh Abdullah, Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah (former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir), Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, Mehbooba Mufti, Chaudhary Rahim Khan, Sikander Bakht, A. R. Antulay, Ahmed Patel, C. H. Mohammed Koya, A. B. A. Ghani Khan Choudhury, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Salman Khurshid, Saifuddin Soz, E. Ahamed, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Syed Shahnawaz Hussain, Asaduddin Owaisi, Azam Khan and Badruddin Ajmal, Najma Heptulla.

===Haj subsidy===

The government of India subsidized the cost of the airfare for Indian Hajj pilgrims until it was totally phased out in 2018. The decision to end the subsidy was in order to comply with a Supreme Court of India decision of 2011. Starting in 2011, the amount of government subsidy per person was decreased year on year and ended completely by 2018. Maulana Mahmood A. Madani, a member of the Rajya Sabha and general secretary of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, declared that the Hajj subsidy is a technical violation of Islamic Sharia, since the Quran declares that Hajj should be performed by Muslims using their own resources. Influential Muslim lobbies in India have regularly insisted that the Hajj subsidy should be phased out as it is un-Islamic.

==Conflict and controversy==
===Conversion controversy===

Considerable controversy exists both in scholarly and public opinion about the conversions to Islam typically represented by the following schools of thought:

# The bulk of Muslims are descendants of migrants from the Iranian Plateau or Arabs. However this claim is disputed by modern genetic studies on haplotype findings of Y-chromosomal ancestry amongst various Muslim communities in India. 
# Conversions of convenience: administrators and clerks converted to preserve their employment by governments; slaves obtained protection, and sometimes even power, through conversion; sub-castes converted to gain a Muslim ruler&#x27;s protection; in many service industries (e.g. butchery) conversion was socially convenient; non-Muslim men converted to marry Muslim women.
# Conversions occurred for non-religious reasons of pragmatism and patronage such as social mobility among the Muslim ruling elite or for relief from taxes
# Conversion was a result of the actions of Sunni Sufi saints and involved a genuine change of heart.
# Conversion came from Buddhists and the en masse conversions of lower castes for social liberation and as a rejection of the oppressive Hindu caste strictures.
# A combination, initially made under duress followed by a genuine change of heart.
# As a socio-cultural process of diffusion and integration over an extended period of time into the sphere of the dominant Muslim civilisation and global polity at large.

Embedded within this lies the concept of Islam as a foreign imposition and Hinduism as the native religion that resisted it has been a point of contention, contributing to the failure of efforts to Islamize the Indian subcontinent and playing a significant role in the politics of partition and communalism. The impact and consequences of the Muslim conquest of South Asia remain subjects of scrutiny and diverse viewpoints.

Will Durant characterizes the Muslim conquest of India as a particularly tumultuous chapter in history. He suggests that it was marked by significant violence and upheaval, which he attributes in part to factors such as internal divisions, the influence of religions like Buddhism and Jainism. Jadunath Sarkar argues that some Muslim invaders waged a systematic jihad against Hindus, using various methods to force conversions. Hindu converts to Islam faced discrimination within the Muslim social hierarchy, as outlined in Ziauddin al-Barani’s Fatawa-i Jahandari, where they were placed in the Ajlaf caste and treated as inferior to the Ashraf castes. Other perspectives suggest that the Muslim conquests led to persecution of Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists, with instances of massacres, temple destructions, and forced conversions.

Sir Thomas Arnold and De Lacy O&#x27;Leary, criticized the view that Islam was spread by force and sword as &#x27;absurd.&#x27; According to Ira Lapidus, while instances of forced conversion in Muslim regions did occur, they were relatively infrequent. Muslim conquerors generally sought to exert control rather than enforce conversion, with the majority of conversions to Islam being voluntary in nature. 

Other critics of the &quot;conversion by the sword theory&quot; point to the presence of the large Muslim communities found in Southern India, Sri Lanka, Western Burma, Bangladesh, Southern Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia coupled with the distinctive lack of equivalent Muslim communities around the heartland of historical Muslim empires in the Indian subcontinent as a refutation to the &quot;conversion by the sword theory&quot;. The legacy of the Muslim conquest of South Asia is a hotly debated issue and argued even today.

Muslim invaders were not all simply raiders. Later rulers fought on to win kingdoms and stayed to create new ruling dynasties. The practices of these new rulers and their subsequent heirs (some of whom were born to Hindu wives) varied considerably. While some were uniformly hated, others developed a popular following. According to the memoirs of Ibn Battuta who travelled through Delhi in the 14th century, one of the previous sultans had been especially brutal and was deeply hated by Delhi&#x27;s population. Batuta&#x27;s memoirs also indicate that Muslims from the Arab world, Persia and Anatolia were often favoured with important posts at the royal courts, suggesting that locals may have played a somewhat subordinate role in the Delhi administration. The term &quot;Turk&quot; was commonly used to refer to their higher social status. S.A.A. Rizvi (&quot;The Wonder That Was India – II&quot;) however points to Muhammad bin Tughluq as not only encouraging locals but promoting artisan groups such as cooks, barbers and gardeners to high administrative posts. In his reign, it is likely that conversions to Islam took place as a means of seeking greater social mobility and improved social standing.

Although, the Mughals were generally known for their religious tolerance, and actively patronized the arts and literature as well as cultural and religious exchange, blending Hindu and Islamic traditions, numerous temples were destroyed by Muslim conquerors like Aurangzeb who was noted for his policies of religious intolerance non-Muslims.

Richard M. Eaton lists a total of 80 temples that were desecrated by Muslim conquerors, but notes this was not unusual in medieval India where numerous temples were also desecrated by Hindu and Buddhist kings against rival Indian kingdoms during conflicts between devotees of different Hindu deities, and between Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. He also notes there were many instances of the Delhi Sultanate, which often had Hindu ministers, ordering the protection, maintenance and repairing of temples, according to both Muslim and Hindu sources, and that attacks on temples had significantly declined under the Mughal Empire.

K. S. Lal, in his book &quot;Growth of Muslim Population in Medieval India&quot;, claimed that between 1000 and 1500 the Indian population decreased by 30 million, but stated his estimates were tentative and did not claim any finality. His work has come under criticism by historians such as Simon Digby (SOAS, University of London) and Irfan Habib for its agenda and lack of accurate data in pre-census times. Different population estimates by economics historians Angus Maddison and Jean-Noël Biraben also indicate that India&#x27;s population did not decrease between 1000 and 1500, but increased by about 35 million during that time. The Indian population estimates from other economic historians including Colin Clark, John D. Durand and Colin McEvedy also show there was a population increase in India between 1000 and 1500.

===Relations with non-Muslim communities===

====Muslim–Hindu conflict====

;Before 1947
The conflict between Hindus and Muslims in the Indian subcontinent has a complex history which can be said to have begun with the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s invasion of Sindh in 711. The persecution of Hindus during the Islamic expansion in India during the medieval period was characterised by destruction of temples, often illustrated by historians by the repeated destruction of the Hindu Temple at Somnath and the anti-Hindu practices of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Although there were instances of conflict between the two groups, a number of Hindus worshipped and continue to worship at the tombs of Muslim Sufi Saints. During the Noakhali riots in 1946, several thousand Hindus were forcibly converted to Islam by Muslim mobs.

;From 1947 to 1998
The aftermath of the Partition of India in 1947 saw large scale sectarian strife and bloodshed throughout the nation. Since then, India has witnessed sporadic large-scale violence sparked by underlying tensions between sections of the Hindu and Muslim communities. These include the 1969 Gujarat riots, the 1970 Bhiwandi riots, the 1983 Nellie massacre, and the 1989 Bhagalpur violence. These conflicts stem in part from the ideologies of Hindu nationalism and Islamic extremism. Since independence, India has always maintained a constitutional commitment to secularism.

The sense of communal harmony between Hindus and Muslims in the post-partition period was compromised greatly by the razing of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya. The demolition took place in 1992 and was perpetrated by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and organisations like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Bajrang Dal, Vishva Hindu Parishad and Shiv Sena. This was followed by tit for tat violence by Muslim and Hindu fundamentalists throughout the country, giving rise to the Bombay riots and the 1993 Bombay bombings.

In the 1998 Prankote massacre, 26 Kashmiri Hindus were beheaded by Islamist militants after their refusal to convert to Islam. The militants struck when the villagers refused demands from the gunmen to convert to Islam and prove their conversion by eating beef.

;Kashmir (1990s)

During the eruption of militancy in the 1990s, following persecution and threats by radical Islamists and militants, the native Kashmiri Hindus were forced into an exodus from Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region in Northern India. Mosques issued warnings, telling them to leave Kashmir, convert to Islam or be killed. Approximately 300,000–350,000 pandits left the valley during the mid-80s and the 90s. Many of them have been living in abject conditions in refugee camps of Jammu.

;Gujarat (2002)

One of the most violent events in recent times took place during the Gujarat riots in 2002, where it is estimated one thousand people were killed, most allegedly Muslim. Some sources claim there were approximately 2,000 Muslim deaths. There were also allegations made of state involvement. The riots were in retaliation to the Godhra train burning in which 59 Hindu pilgrims returning from the disputed site of the Babri Masjid, were burnt alive in a train fire at the Godhra railway station. Gujarat police claimed that the incident was a planned act carried out by extremist Muslims in the region against the Hindu pilgrims. The Bannerjee commission appointed to investigate this finding declared that the fire was an accident. In 2006 the High Court decided the constitution of such a committee was illegal as another inquiry headed by Justice Nanavati Shah was still investigating the matter.

In 2004, several Indian school textbooks were scrapped by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) after they were found to be loaded with anti-Muslim prejudice. The NCERT argued that the books were &quot;written by scholars hand-picked by the previous Hindu nationalist administration&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, the textbooks depicted India&#x27;s past Muslim rulers &quot;as barbarous invaders and the medieval period as a Dark Age of Islamic colonial rule which snuffed out the glories of the Hindu empire that preceded it&quot;. In one textbook, it was purported that the Taj Mahal, the Qutb Minar and the Red Fort – all examples of Islamic architecture – &quot;were designed and commissioned by Hindus&quot;.

;West Bengal (2010)

In the 2010 Deganga riots, rioting began on 6 September 2010, when an Islamist mob resorted to arson and violence on the Hindu neighborhoods of Deganga, Kartikpur and Beliaghata under the Deganga police station area. The violence began late in the evening and continued throughout the night into the next morning. The district police, Rapid Action Force, Central Reserve Police Force and Border Security Force all failed to stop the mob violence and the Army was finally deployed.

;Assam (2012)

At least 77 people died and 400,000 people were displaced in the 2012 Assam violence between indigenous Bodos and East Bengal rooted Muslims.

;Delhi (2020)

The 2020 Delhi riots, which left more than 50 dead and hundreds injured, were triggered by protests against a citizenship law seen by many critics as anti-Muslim and part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s Hindu nationalist agenda.

====Muslim–Sikh conflict====
Sikhism emerged in the Punjab during the Mughal period. Conflict between early Sikhs and the Muslim power center at Delhi reached an early high point in 1606 when Guru Arjan, the fifth guru of the Sikhs, was tortured and killed by Jahangir, the Mughal emperor. After the death of the fifth beloved Guru his son took his spot as Guru Hargobind, who basically made the Sikhs a warrior religion. Guru ji was the first to defeat the Mughal empire in a battle which had taken place in present Sri Hargobindpur in Gurdaspur Later in the 16th century, Tegh Bahadur became guru in 1665 and led the Sikhs until 1675. Teg Bahadur was executed by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb for helping to protect Hindus, after a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits came to him for help when the Emperor condemned them to death for failing to convert to Islam. At this point, Aurangzeb had instituted forceful conversions on the basis of charging citizens with crimes then sparing them from punishments (up to death) if they converted. This led to a high increase of violence between the Sikhs and Hindus as well as rebellions in Aurangzeb&#x27;s empire. This is an early example which illustrates how the Hindu-Muslim conflict and the Muslim-Sikh conflicts are connected. After this Guru Gobind Singh and the Sikhs helped the next successor of the throne of India to rise, who was Bahadur Shah Zafar. For a certain period of time good relations were maintained somewhat like they were in Akbar&#x27;s time until disputes arose again. The Mughal period saw various invaders coming into India through Punjab with which they would loot and severely plunder. Better relations have been seen by Dulla Bhatti, Mian Mir, Pir Budhu Shah, Pir Bhikham Shah, Bulleh Shah.

In 1699, the Khalsa was founded by Guru Gobind Singh, the last guru. A former ascetic was charged by Gobind Singh with the duty of punishing those who had persecuted the Sikhs. After the guru&#x27;s death, Baba Banda Singh Bahadur became the leader of the Sikh army and was responsible for several attacks on the Mughal empire. He was executed by the emperor Jahandar Shah after refusing the offer of a pardon if he converted to Islam. The decline of Mughal power during the 17th and 18th centuries, along with the growing strength of the Sikh Empire, resulted in a balance of power which protected the Sikhs from more violence. The Sikh empire was absorbed into the British Indian empire after the Second Anglo-Sikh War of 1849.

Massive population exchanges took place during the Partition of India in 1947, and the British Indian province of Punjab was divided into two parts, where the western parts were assigned to Pakistan, while the eastern parts went to India. 5.3 million Muslims moved from India to West Punjab in Pakistan, as 3.4 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan to East Punjab in India. The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border. Estimates of the number of deaths range around roughly 500,000, with low estimates at 200,000 and high estimates at 1,000,000.

<text>Sarah Catherine Ragle Weddington (February 5, 1945 – December 26, 2021) was an American attorney, law professor, advocate for women&#x27;s rights and reproductive health, and member of the Texas House of Representatives. She was best known for representing &quot;Jane Roe&quot; (real name Norma McCorvey) in the landmark &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; case before the United States Supreme Court. She also was the first female General Counsel for the US Department of Agriculture.

==Early life and education==
Sarah Ragle was born on February 5, 1945, in Abilene, Texas, to Lena Catherine and Herbert Doyle Ragle, a Methodist minister. As a child, she was drum major of her junior high band, president of the Methodist youth fellowship at her church, played the organ, sang in the church choir, and rode horses.

Weddington graduated from high school two years early and then graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in English from McMurry University in Abilene. She was a member of Sigma Kappa sorority. In 1964, she entered the University of Texas Law School. partly motivated after the dean at McMurry College, told her &quot;No woman from this college has ever gone to law school. It would be too tough&quot;.
She was one of only five women in her law school class of 120. In 1967, during her third year of law school, Weddington became pregnant by Ron Weddington and travelled to Mexico for an illegal abortion, a fact she didn&#x27;t reveal until 1992. She received her J.D. that same year, graduating in the top quarter of her class.

== Career==
After graduating, Weddington found it difficult to find a job with a law firm. She joined a group of graduate students at University of Texas-Austin who were researching ways to challenge various anti-abortion statutes.

Soon after, a pregnant woman named Norma McCorvey visited a local attorney seeking an abortion. The attorney instead assisted McCorvey with handing over her child for adoption and after doing so, referred McCorvey to Weddington and Linda Coffee.

In March 1970, Weddington and her co-counsel filed suit against Henry Wade, the Dallas district attorney and the person responsible for enforcing the anti-abortion statute. McCorvey became the landmark plaintiff and was referred in the legal documents as &quot;Jane Roe&quot; to protect her identity.

In May 1970, Weddington first stated her case in front of a three-judge district court in Dallas. The district court agreed that the Texas abortion laws were unconstitutional, but the state appealed the decision, landing it before the United States Supreme Court. In 1971 and again in the fall of 1972, Weddington appeared before the Supreme Court. At the time of her first Supreme Court presentation, Weddington was 26 years old and had never tried a legal case. Her argument was based on the 1st, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th, and 14th amendments, as well as the Court&#x27;s previous decision in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, which legalized the sale of contraceptives based on the right of privacy. In January 1973, the Court&#x27;s decision was ultimately handed down, overturning Texas’ abortion law by a 7-2 majority and legalizing abortion throughout the United States.

McCorvey, the lead plaintiff, claimed at the time that she had been raped, although she later recanted that claim and said she had wanted an abortion for economic reasons. During the course of the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; litigation, she gave birth and put the baby up for adoption. Rape was never an issue in the litigation or in the Supreme Court decision. In a 1993 speech at the Institute for Educational Ethics in Oklahoma, Weddington discussed how she presented McCorvey during the lawsuit: “My conduct may not have been totally ethical. But I did it for what I thought were good reasons.&quot; In a 2018 interview with &quot;Time&quot;, she said McCorvey was &quot;a changeable person&quot;, adding &quot;the problem I had was trying to tell when she was telling the truth and when she wasn&#x27;t. ... I was very careful in drafting the materials that were filed with the court to be sure I only put in things I was sure were accurate.&quot;

In 1989, Weddington was portrayed by Amy Madigan in the television film &quot;Roe vs. Wade&quot;. In 1992, Weddington compiled her experiences with the case and interviews with the people involved into a book titled &quot;A Question of Choice&quot;.
By the time &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; was decided in January 1973, Weddington was elected to the Texas House of Representatives and re-elected to another two terms.

Weddington attended the historic 1977 National Women&#x27;s Conference in Houston as a Texas delegate speaking on the resolution of women&#x27;s reproductive freedom.

In 1977, US President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration chose Weddington to serve in the United States Department of Agriculture, and from 1978 to 1981 she served as his assistant.

From 1981 to 1990 she was a lecturer at Texas Woman&#x27;s University. She was the founder of the Weddington Center. She also served as a speaker and adjunct professor at the University of Texas at Austin until 2012.

In 2020, she was portrayed by actress Greer Grammer in the film &quot;&quot;, directed by and Cathy Allyn.

==Personal life and death==
From 1968 to 1974, she was married to Ron Weddington. After her divorce, Sarah lived alone in Austin, Texas.

Weddington died at her home in Austin on December 26, 2021, at age 76, after a period of declining health. News outlets noted that her death occurred shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, a case reconsidering and ultimately overturning the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision.

==Awards==
Weddington held honorary doctorates from McMurry University, Hamilton College, Austin College, Southwestern University, and Nova Southeastern University.

<text>CIBC Capital Markets is the investment banking subsidiary of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The firm operates as an investment bank both in Canadian and global equity and debt capital markets. The firm provides a variety of financial services including equity and debt capital market products, mergers and acquisitions, global markets (sales and trading), merchant banking, and other investment banking advisory services.

Established via a series of acquisitions, including Canadian brokerage Wood Gundy and U.S.-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co., CIBC Capital Markets has been a leading investment bank in Canada with a notable presence in various international markets at times over the years.

CIBC Capital Markets is headquartered at CIBC Square in Toronto with offices in Calgary, Montreal, Vancouver, Winnipeg, New York City, Chicago, Houston, Milwaukee, Bogota, Beijing, Hong Kong, London, Luxembourg, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.

== History ==

===CIBC Wood Gundy===
The original Wood Gundy company was established in Toronto in 1905 by George Herbert Wood and James Henry Gundy. CIBC purchased a majority stake in Wood Gundy in June 1988 for C$203.3 million. After the purchase, the CIBC formed CIBC Wood Gundy, which offered asset management services for corporate and institutional clients. Two years later, in 1990, they continued to expand the Canadian securities business by acquiring much of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company&#x27;s Canadian business. In 1997, Wood Gundy acquired Eyers Reed, an Australian broker firm for $20 million.

===Acquisition of Argosy Group===

In April 1995, CIBC Wood Gundy announced the acquisition of The Argosy Group, a New York-based investment banking firm involved primarily in the high-yield debt market. Argosy had been founded by three Drexel Burnham Lambert alumni: Jay Bloom, Andrew Heyer, and Dean Kehler, who had worked together in Drexel&#x27;s New York office in the 1980s.

The acquisition of Argosy marked an aggressive push by CIBC into the US investment banking business. Prior to that point, CIBC had never done a junk bond deal. Argosy&#x27;s three major principals had worked on some of the biggest junk-bond deals of the 1980s while at Drexel Burnham Lambert. The 52 Argosy employees constituted the core of what would become CIBC&#x27;s High Yield Group and CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds that were responsible for, among other things, the $1 billion windfalls that CIBC would earn from its early investments in Global Crossing. The Argosy principals also managed two collateralized debt obligation vehicles known as Caravelle Funds I and II.

===CIBC Oppenheimer===
In 1997, CIBC Wood Gundy, under the direction of Michael S. Rulle, acquired the American brokerage house Oppenheimer &amp; Co. for $585 million. Subsequently, the merged companies were called CIBC Oppenheimer; Rulle remained the chairman and chief executive of the company while Stephen Robert and Nathan Gantcher of Oppenheimer became vice-chairmen of CIBC Oppenheimer. According to the deal, CIBC paid $350 million and additionally provided a $175 million that was paid in the course of over three years to help retain key executives from the firm.

===Creating the CIBC Capital Markets platform===

By 1999, CIBC Oppenheimer changed its name to CIBC Capital Markets and positioned itself as CIBC&#x27;s international investment bank. The CIBC Capital Markets unit suffered a net loss of C$186 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 which dragged down the performance of the parent bank&#x27;s stock by almost one-third. The loss in 1998 was due primarily to very rapid expansion into regions impacted by the various financial crises in 1998. As a result, CIBC Capital Markets refocused its efforts primarily on the U.S. and Canadian markets, despite the seemingly global ambitions implied in the unit&#x27;s name.

CIBC Capital Markets reached a peak in 1999 and 2000, when the investment bank cracked the top ten of U.S. issuers of high yield bonds and the top twenty in mergers and acquisitions advisory. In 1999, CIBC Capital Markets backed Gary Winnick and his company Global Crossing to build optical fiber cable connections under the ocean. In 2000, CIBC realized a gain of $2.0 billion from its relatively small equity investment in Global Crossing, representing more than 20% of the bank&#x27;s profits. On the back of the success in Global Crossing, CIBC backed the three heads of its CIBC Argosy Merchant Banking funds in a new private equity operation known as Trimaran Capital Partners. Trimaran closed on a $1 billion fund in April 2001, with capital provided primarily by CIBC.

In June 2001, CIBC announced the construction of a new $800 million office tower at 300 Madison Avenue (At the corner of Madison Avenue and 42nd Street). The 35-story, building was originally expected to house up to 3,000 employees, bringing CIBC&#x27;s entire New York staff under one roof. When the 300 Madison building was completed in 2004, CIBC&#x27;s diminished workforce took up only a few floors, leasing the remainder to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.

===Challenges at CIBC Capital Markets===

In July 2001, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; profiled CIBC Capital Markets, chronicling the rapid decline of the bank from the peaks of Wall Street&#x27;s league table rankings. By 2002, CIBC was forced to set aside C$1.5 billion for bad corporate loans, primarily from CIBC Capital Markets and the bank was linked two of the most famous victims of the corporate accounting scandals of the early 2000s: Enron Corporation and Global Crossing. As a result of these developments, the parent bank implemented a strategy to reallocate resources away from the riskier CIBC Capital Markets division in favor of its retail operations.

As part of this strategy, in 2003, CIBC sold an asset management division along with retail brokerage to Fahnestock Viner along with the Oppenheimer &amp; Co. name. Also in September 2003, a jury found that CIBC had failed to provide complete financial information to investors in a high-yield bond offering. Just a few months later, at the end of 2003, CIBC reached an $80 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission over its various financings for Enron, representing far more than the bank had earned in fees.

===Sale to Oppenheimer &amp; Co. (Fahnestock Viner)===

In November 2007, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. (Fahnestock) announced that it would purchase a major part of CIBC Capital Markets&#x27; U.S. Investment Banking, Corporate Syndicate, Institutional Sales and Trading, Equity Research, Options Trading and a portion of the Debt Capital Markets business which includes Convertible Bond Trading, Loan Syndication, High Yield Origination, and Trading as well as related operations located in the UK, Israel, and Hong Kong. The deal closed January 14, 2008, and essentially reunited the original Oppenheimer &amp; Co. which CIBC divided into the sale to Fahnestock.

On February 29, 2008, CIBC Capital Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Shaw was replaced in both capacities by Richard Nesbitt, a former TSX Group CEO.

== Competition ==
CIBC Capital Markets faces competition from major global investment banks such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and the RBC Capital Markets, equivalent branches of other financial conglomerates such as BMO Capital Markets, and TD Securities, and other independent/boutique investment banks and large cap advisory firms such as the corporate finance practices of Deloitte and KPMG.

<text>Synæsthesia was a Canadian ambient band formed by industrial musicians Bill Leeb and Rhys Fulber as a side project of their main band Front Line Assembly. &quot;Keyboard&quot; magazine writes: &quot;Synæsthesia explores dark tribal ambient sounds, composers have a flair for cinematic electronica, and favor epic pieces that unfold slowly.&quot;

==History==
Leeb and Fulber formed Synæsthesia in the 1990s and began recording together. Due to contractual entanglements they were at first not able to admit they were behind the music. Instead credits for their first two albums, &quot;Embody&quot; and &quot;Desideratum&quot;, went to &quot;R. Deckard&quot;, an allusion to the main character in the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

The identity of the musicians was revealed with the release of the third album, &quot;Ephemeral&quot;, crediting Leeb with the music and Fulber with programming. The album incorporates symphonic passages, traditional rhythms and nature sounds into menacing electronic sounds. 

&quot;Synæsthesia&quot; uses samples from a number of musicians and from the film &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;.

==Desideratum==
&quot;Desideratum&quot; is Synæsthesia&#x27;s second album of ambient, industrial music, released October 17, 1995 by Cleopatra Records. It was produced by Leeb and Fulber. Its length is 139:15. It received a four of five star rating by AllMusic.

<text>Better Loosen Up (foaled 29 August 1985 – died 15 March 2016) was an Australian Thoroughbred racehorse that won the Japan Cup in 1990 and was named Australia&#x27;s champion racehorse in 1991. He campaigned from two to seven years of age, and won 17 of his 45 starts, including eight Group One races. In 2004, he was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame.

Better Loosen Up was a small bay gelding, by Loosen Up (USA) out of Better Fantasy by Better Boy (IRE). He was bred by Howard Martin and foaled in Berrigan, New South Wales. Loosen Up won the French Prix de l&#x27; Avre and was the sire of six stakes-winners in Australia with Better Loosen Up being the best one. Better Fantasy was the dam of 13 named foals, but Better Loosen Up was her only stakes-winner.

==Racing career==
Under the care of Les Theodore, won one of his four starts as two-year-old, a maiden at Bendigo on 28 April 1988. At three, he was transferred to the Sydney stables of Bart Cummings, where he won four races and was runner-up in the Canterbury Guineas. At season&#x27;s end, his record stood at a relatively unprepossessing five wins from 16 starts, although Les Theodore claims to have told the staff at Lindsay Park that the horse was a &#x27;champion&#x27;.

Now trained by Colin Hayes, Better Loosen Up resumed late in the spring of 1989, on Caulfield Cup day, with a close second, and finished the year with three Group One wins in as many starts, in the Honda Stakes, the Winfield Stakes, and the Railway Stakes. In the new year, he defeated Super Impose and Vo Rogue in the Blamey and the Segenhoe Stakes, and was runner-up to Vo Rogue in the Australian Cup in between. In his final starts for the season, he was defeated by Sydeston on heavy tracks in the Mercedes Classic and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. At five, under the care of David Hayes (Colin Hayes had retired at the end of the 1989–1990 season), Better Loosen Up was better again. After a first-up defeat in the Liston Stakes, he was undefeated for the rest of the season, and, in successive races, took out the Feehan Stakes, the Turnbull Stakes, the Cox Plate, the Mackinnon Stakes, the Japan Cup, and, in the new year, the Blamey Stakes and the Australian Cup. In the Cox Plate, Better Loosen Up had come from an estimated 30 lengths off the lead to win in course-record time; in the Mackinnon Stakes, on Derby Day, he was one of a &#x27;world record&#x27; six Group winners for his trainer; in the Japan Cup, he scored a thrilling win to racecaller Bryan Martin&#x27;s cry of &#x27;Better Loosen Up has won for Australia&#x27;, and remains the only Australian horse to do so; in the Australian Cup, he defeated Vo Rogue by lengths. Following this season, Better Loosen Up was named Australia&#x27;s champion racehorse in 1991.

A leg injury, which had cut short his autumn campaign, restricted him to just 12 further starts, at six and seven, and he failed to reach the same heights. His best performance came in the Cox Plate of 1992, where he was beaten just over a length by Super Impose, and successfully protested against Let&#x27;s Elope, who was second past-the-post. He was retired in February 1993, within days of Super Impose, with which he would star on &#x27;Super Better Best&#x27; – the story of how two geldings rose from obscurity to amass a &#x27;$10 million fortune&#x27;.

==In retirement==
Better Loosen Up lived at Living Legends, The International Home of Rest for Champion Horses in the Melbourne suburb of Greenvale before his death in 2016.

<text>Geode is a series of x86-compatible system-on-a-chip (SoC) microprocessors and I/O companions produced by AMD that was targeted at the embedded computing market.

The series was originally launched by National Semiconductor as the Geode family in 1999. The original Geode processor core itself is derived from the Cyrix MediaGX platform, which was acquired in National&#x27;s merger with Cyrix in 1997. AMD bought the Geode business from National in August 2003 to augment its existing line of embedded x86 processor products. Before acquiring Geode, AMD marketed the AMD Élan, a family of 32-Bit embedded SoCs based on their own Am386, Am486 and Am586 microprocessors. All of these products have been backed with a long-term supply guarantee to meet the needs of embedded processors. However, after acquiring Geode, the product was suddenly discontinued.

AMD expanded the Geode series to two classes of processor: the MediaGX-derived Geode GX and LX, and the modern Athlon-derived Geode NX.

Geode processors are optimized for low power consumption and low cost while still remaining compatible with software written for the x86 platform. The MediaGX-derived processors lack modern features such as SSE and a large on-die L1 cache but these are offered on the more recent Athlon-derived Geode NX. Geode processors tightly integrate some of the functions normally provided by a separate chipset, such as the northbridge. Whilst the processor family is best suited for thin client, set top box and embedded computing applications, it can be found in unusual applications such as the Nao robot and the Win Enterprise IP-PBX.

The One Laptop per Child project used the GX series Geode processor in OLPC XO-1 prototypes, but moved to the Geode LX for production. The Linutop (rebranded Artec ThinCan DBE61C or rebranded FIC ION603A) is also based on the Geode LX. 3Com Audrey was powered by a 200 MHz Geode GX1.

The SCxxxx range of Geode devices are a single-chip version, comparable to the SiS 552, VIA CoreFusion or Intel&#x27;s Tolapai, which integrate the CPU, memory controller, graphics and I/O devices into one package. Single processor boards based on these processors are manufactured by Artec Group, PC Engines (WRAP), Soekris, and Win Enterprises.

AMD discontinued all Geode processors in 2019.

== AMD Geode ==

In 2002, AMD introduced the Geode GX series, which was a re-branding of the National Semiconductor GX2. This was quickly followed by the Geode LX, running up to 667 MHz. LX brought many improvements, such as higher speed DDR, a re-designed instruction pipe, and a more powerful display controller. The upgrade from the CS5535 I/O Companion to the CS5536 brought higher speed USB.

Geode GX and LX processors are typically found in devices such as thin clients and industrial control systems. However, they have come under competitive pressure from VIA on the x86 side, and ARM processors from various vendors taking much of the low-end business.

Because of the relative performance, albeit higher PPW, of the GX and LX core design, AMD introduced the Geode NX, which is an embedded version of the Athlon processor, K7. Geode NX uses the Thoroughbred core and is quite similar to the Athlon XP-M that use this core. The Geode NX includes 256 KB of level 2 cache, and runs fanless at up to 1 GHz in the NX1500@6 W version. The NX2001 part runs at 1.8 GHz, the NX1750 part runs at 1.4 GHz, and the NX1250 runs at 667 MHz.

The Geode NX, with its strong FPU, is particularly suited for embedded devices with graphical performance requirements, such as information kiosks and casino gaming machines, such as video slots.

However, it was reported that the specific design team for Geode processors in Longmont, Colorado, has been closed, and 75 employees are being relocated to the new development facility in Fort Collins, Colorado. It is expected that the Geode line of processors will be updated less frequently due to the closure of the Geode design center.

In 2009, comments by AMD indicated that there are no plans for any future microarchitecture upgrades to the processor and that there will be no successor; however, the processors will still be available with the planned availability of the Geode LX extending through 2015. In 2016 AMD updated the product roadmap announcing extension of last time buy and shipment for the LX series to 2019. In early 2018 hardware manufacturer congatec announced an agreement with AMD for a further extension of availability of congatec&#x27;s Geode based platforms.

==== Geode NX 2001 ====

In 2007, there was a &quot;Geode NX 2001&quot; model on sale, which was a relabelled Athlon XP 2200+ Thoroughbred. The processors, with part numbers AANXA2001FKC3G or ANXA2001FKC3D, their specifications are 1.8 GHz clock speed, and 1.65 volt core operating voltage. The power consumption is 62.8 Watt. There are no official references to this processor except officials explaining that the batch of CPUs were &quot;being shipped to specific customers&quot;, though it is clear it is a desktop Athlon XP CPU core instead of the Mobile Athlon XP-M derived Thoroughbred cores of the other Geode NX CPUs, and thus doesn&#x27;t feature embedded application specific thermal envelope, power consumption and power management features. This kind of &quot;badge engineering&quot; of a particular CPU to accommodate a request for a desktop class chip from an OEM which merely wants to maintain brand recognition and association with the GeodeNX CPUs in its products, but the actual end-product application doesn&#x27;t necessitate the advanced power and thermal optimization of the GeodeNX CPU&#x27;s, is understandable, as re-labeling a part in a product catalog, is practically free and the processors do share the same CPU socket (Socket A).

<text>Call Control eXtensible Markup Language (CCXML) is an XML standard designed to provide asynchronous event-based telephony support to VoiceXML. Its current status is a W3C recommendation, adopted May 10, 2011. Whereas VoiceXML is designed to provide a Voice User Interface to a voice browser, CCXML is designed to inform the voice browser how to handle the telephony control of the voice channel. The two XML applications are wholly separate and are not required by each other to be implemented - however, they have been designed with interoperability in mind

==Status and Future==
*CCXML 1.0 has reached the status of a Proposed Recommendation. The transition from Candidate Recommendation to Proposed Recommendation took 1 year, while the transition from Last Call Working Draft to Candidate Recommendation took just over 3 years.
*As CCXML extensively uses the concepts of events and transitions, it is expected that the state machines used in the next CCXML 2.0 version will take advantage of a new XML State Machine notation called SCXML, however SCXML is still in Working Draft.

==Implementations==
*OptimTalk is an application platform providing a wide range of technologies and tools for managing, processing and automation of voice communication. It contains a media server supporting VoiceXML 2.0/2.1, CCXML, MRCPv2 and SIP. Besides these open standards, it further supports SRGS, SISR, SSML, HTTP(S), SOAP, REST and SNMP. OptimTalk also serves as a versatile platform for computer telephony integration (CTI) and provides instant access to speech technologies. It is available for Windows, Linux and Solaris, 32 and 64 bit.
*Oktopous ccXML Browser is a first Linux-based comprehensive ccXML lightweight tool kit, that conforms to the Working Draft spec of CCXML 1.0 published in April 2010. Oktopous enables developers to take advantage of well-known Web technologies and tools when building their telephony and speech applications. The Oktopous Engine powers over 5 million calls daily, and is free to download and integrate before going live.
*Voxeo Prophecy IVR Platform is a full IVR platform combining CCXML, VoiceXML and several other technologies. Voxeo has 32-bit and 64-bit distributions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. Prophecy is free for up to 2 ports.
*Telesoft Technologies ARNE IVR Platform is a complete IVR platform, used in value added service and customer service applications. Combines CCXML, VoiceXML with MRCP, HTTP(s) interfaces and connects to Internet Protocol, fixed telephony and mobile phone telecoms networks using SIP, VOIP, SS7/PSTN and other telecoms protocols. Supports multi-tenant applications.
*Open Source Oktopous PIK an abstract, C++ implementation of the W3C Call Control XML (ccXML) standard. Licensed under a BSD-Style license, the toolkit is independent of the underlying telephony platform and protocols and is best suited for OEM / System Integrators looking to implement ccXML functionality in their product offerings. Originally developed by Phonologies, Oktopous has been adopted by more telephony platforms than any open-source ccXML Browser.
*CCXML4J a CCXML Interpreter in Java according to the W3C specification. It is independent of the telephony infrastructure and provides mechanisms to integrate with telephony APIs, e.g. based on the JAIN specifications. This is a derivative of Open Source Oktopous PIK.
*ADVOSS SDP AdvOSS offers the Programmable, Extensible and Enhanceable Service Delivery Platform to enable developers to build and deploy feature rich SIP applications using the industry standard Call Control XML (CCXML), for rapid development and deployment of new services. AdvOSS SDP is a Programmable Extensible and Enhanceable platform that uses industry-standard CCXML. For AdvOSS, making the platform programmable and enhanceable made much sense as the whole idea behind using an SDP is to attain the advantage of developing and integrating new services into the system at a brisk pace. Therefore, we believe that our customer should have the capacity to program, extend and enhance the different modules of this application to meet the rapidly growing requirements of their customers. The service delivery platform has been built from ground up to enable developers to build and deploy feature-rich SIP applications using Call Control XML (CCXML). CCXML provides simple primitives, allowing users to write applications enabling them to quickly transform ideas to solutions. In addition, the AdvOSS platform extends CCXML to support primitives for Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) allowing applications to interface with billing systems either directly or through RADIUS.
*HP OCMP HP OCMP offers a carrier grade, large scale highly available voice/video platforms supporting a wide variety of standards. Integration with SMSC, LDAP, JDBC, SOAP, UCIP, XCAP and CDR processing connectivity is possible.

<doc id="1186147" wikidata="Q4935010" url="?curid=1186147" title="Bobby Frank Cherry">
<text>Bobby Frank Cherry (June 20, 1930 – November 18, 2004) was an American white supremacist, terrorist, and Klansman who was convicted of murder in 2002 for his role in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963. The bombing killed four young African-American girls ( Carole Robertson,Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins, and Denise McNair) and injured more than 20 other people.

==Life==
Bobby Frank Cherry was born on June 20, 1930, in Mineral Springs, a neighborhood of Clanton, Alabama. (Fellow defendant Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. was born on June 20, eight years later.) He joined the United States Marine Corps as a youth, where he gained expertise in demolitions and working with explosives. After his time with the Marines, Cherry worked a series of low-paying jobs, including a long stint as a truck driver.

Cherry was married at the time of the bombing. He and his wife, Virginia, had seven children together. Their marriage was tumultuous and, at times, violent. Bobby Cherry expected deference from his wife and children, using beatings to enforce his authority. Virginia Cherry died of cancer in 1968. After her death, Bobby Cherry placed the children in the Gateway Mercy Home Orphanage and with relatives. He eventually remarried four times, including to third wife, Willadean Brogdon. She would later testify at Cherry&#x27;s trial that he had bragged about his role in the church bombing. Cherry left Birmingham in the early 1970s and moved to the suburbs of Dallas, Texas. He worked as a welder and owned a carpet cleaning business in Grand Prairie. In 1988, he suffered a heart attack and moved again, this time to Henderson County, Texas with fifth wife, Myrtle.

During his trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Cherry, a white man, had assaulted black minister Fred Shuttlesworth in 1957 using a set of brass knuckles. The minister had been working to integrate a school in Birmingham, Alabama. The prosecution also discussed an incident in which Cherry had allegedly pistol-whipped a black man in a restaurant after the man insulted Cherry. 

On the morning of the bombing, Cherry was with his son Tom at the Modern Sign Company a few blocks away from the church. The two were silkscreening Confederate rebel flags. Tom Cherry later said that he could clearly hear the sound of an explosion happening nearby and knew that something bad had happened.

==Murder trial==
Cherry was originally supposed to be tried at the same time as (though not jointly with) fellow defendant Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. Cherry was able to successfully delay his trial by claiming that vascular dementia had impaired his mind and that his health would prevent him from assisting in his own defense. Blanton was convicted and Cherry was eventually found mentally competent to stand trial. At his trial, he denied his involvement in the bombing as well as his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan, but he was ultimately found guilty.

===Testimony and recordings===
Cherry&#x27;s son, Thomas Frank Cherry, testified that Bobby Cherry was a member of the United Klans of America, a Ku Klux Klan group, and relatives and friends testified that he &quot;bragged&quot; about having played a role in the bombing. Ex-wife Willadean Brogdon testified, &quot;He said he lit the fuse.&quot; Michael Wayne Goings, a house painter who worked with Cherry in Dallas in 1982, said he also heard him boast about the crime, even saying &quot;You know, I bombed that church.&quot;

A third man, Mitchell Burns, had been an associate of Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. and Bobby Cherry at the time of the bombing and was recruited by Federal Bureau of Investigation investigators to act as an informant. Burns testified on the stand at Cherry&#x27;s trial that Burns&#x27; involvement with the Ku Klux Klan was more socially than politically based, something that was plausible during the era of the crime, and that the agents approached him and asked for his help. He initially declined but was shown postmortem photos of the young girls killed by the bomb. Deeply disturbed by what he had seen, he vomited. He agreed to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Burns testified that he was primarily a friend of Blanton, but that Blanton was a good friend of Cherry, so Cherry would sometimes join them when they went out. Burns&#x27; assistance came in the form of going to numerous honky tonks with the two men with a very large reel-to-reel tape recorder in the car trunk recording the group&#x27;s conversations. Burns took thorough notes after these meetings, and additionally when the three met and spoke outside of his car.

The tapes were collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation during its immediate investigation. They were subsequently misplaced or archived and were rediscovered in 1997; the rediscovery of the tapes ultimately led to the prosecution of Blanton and Cherry.

The recordings primarily contained racist sentiment. Most significantly, one recording from the car raised the subject of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing. In the recording, the men spoke of it with approval. Blanton began to say something that sounded as if he were about to implicate himself and Cherry by bragging, but Cherry, who was less acquainted with the informant, sharply cut him off by saying, &quot;Now, this good ol&#x27; boy doesn&#x27;t need to know about that!&quot; and laughed. Burns also reported unrecorded references made by Blanton and Cherry to their involvement in the bombing.

===Video===
Also presented at Bobby Cherry&#x27;s trial were videos showing explosives in the same quantity as had been used in the bombing being used to destroy a car in a field. The violent force of the explosion evident in the video was designed to counter the defense&#x27;s suggestion that, though they claimed that Cherry was not involved, the purpose of the bomb may have been to scare the church congregants, not to kill or injure them.

Prosecutors also &quot;showed the jury a videotape of a white mob beating local civil rights leader Fred Shuttlesworth when he showed up to register his children at the all white Phillips High School.&quot; At one point, the prosecutors &quot;froze the film as a grinning, slender white man with a bulbous nose, wavy hair and a cigarette dangling from his mouth — unmistakably a grinning young Bobby Frank Cherry — was seen slamming his fist into the minister&#x27;s head after pulling what appeared to be a set of brass knuckles from his back pocket.&quot;

==Conviction==
During the trial, Cherry smiled and looked amused. He could be seen joking with his lawyers and several supporters, not appearing to believe that the legal system which had protected him up to that point would ultimately send him to jail. He was convicted on four counts of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Cherry attempted to appeal, but in October 2004, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously upheld his conviction. The court rejected Cherry&#x27;s claim that a delay of 37 years between his commission of the crime and his indictment in 2000 had resulted in an inherently unfair trial.

During his prison sentence, Cherry repeatedly claimed to be the victim of a malicious false campaign against him and he said that he was a &quot;political prisoner&quot; who was denied proper treatment.

He was originally taken to the Kilby Correctional Facility in Montgomery County, Alabama for intake. He was later moved to Holman Correctional Facility in Escambia County, Alabama.

On Wednesday October 13, 2004, Cherry was transferred from Holman Prison to Atmore Community Hospital in Atmore. During the same day, an ambulance transported him from the Atmore hospital to a hospital in Montgomery.

Cherry died in the Kilby prison&#x27;s hospital unit, on November 18, 2004, at the age of 74. He is buried in Payne Springs Cemetery in Henderson County, Texas.

==Media portrayal==
Cherry was portrayed by Richard Jenkins in the 2002 television film &quot;Sins of the Father&quot;.

<doc id="1186150" wikidata="Q12815803" url="?curid=1186150" title="Rickon Stark">
<text>Rickon Stark is a fictional character in the &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; series of epic fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; where he is portrayed by Irish actor Art Parkinson. Introduced in 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, Rickon subsequently appears in Martin&#x27;s &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; (1998).

==Character description==
Rickon is the fifth and youngest child of Eddard &quot;Ned&quot; Stark and his wife Catelyn, and has five siblings — Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and his illegitimate half-brother Jon Snow. Like his brothers and sisters, Rickon is constantly accompanied by his direwolf, Shaggydog, with whom he shares a strong connection. Martin describes Rickon as favoring his mother in appearance. He is naturally aggressive, bold, tough, strong-willed, and violent: traits reflected in his direwolf companion &#x27;Shaggydog&#x27;.

==Storylines==
===Novels===
Rickon Stark is not a point of view character in the novels and is mostly a background character. His actions are witnessed and interpreted through the eyes of his older brother, Bran.

====&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;====
In &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; (1996), Ned Stark departs Winterfell with his daughters to serve King Robert Baratheon in King&#x27;s Landing, while his wife Catelyn remains behind with their sons, grief-stricken over their comatose son Bran. An overwhelmed young Rickon can only follow around his oldest brother Robb, crying. Upset when Robb prepares to leave himself, Rickon hides in the crypts of Winterfell. Shortly after Ned&#x27;s death in King&#x27;s Landing, both Bran and Rickon share a vision of their father&#x27;s spirit in the crypts.

====&quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;====
Following Ned&#x27;s death, Rickon is largely unsupervised as Robb and Catelyn leave for war and his sisters are held captive at King&#x27;s Landing in 1998&#x27;s &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;. Alone with his crippled brother Bran, Rickon develops an unruly, often violent temper. His fear and rage are reflected in Shaggydog, who turns largely feral and attacks several people before being restrained. Several times, Bran&#x27;s direwolf Summer is forced to fight Shaggydog into submission. Bran and Rickon become Theon Greyjoy&#x27;s hostages when Theon takes Winterfell by force. He later manages to escape and hide in the crypts below the castle with Bran, Hodor, the Reed siblings Meera and Jojen, and the wildling woman Osha. After Winterfell is sacked and burned by Ramsay Bolton, the group emerges to find Winterfell in ruins, and a mortally wounded Maester Luwin tells them that Bran and Rickon need to be separated and taken into hiding. Osha flees with Rickon in her care, and the others accompany Bran.

====&quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot;====
In &quot;A Dance with Dragons&quot; (2011), most of Westeros believes Rickon is dead, but Lord Wyman Manderly hears from a survivor of the sack of Winterfell that Rickon is allegedly alive and has fled with a woman to the island of Skagos. Skagos is a large, northern island in the mouth of the Bay of Seals and is subject to the rule of House Stark. In return for pledging his loyalty to Stannis Baratheon instead of the Lannisters, Manderly tasks Ser Davos Seaworth with retrieving Rickon from Skagos so that they may reveal him to the Northern lords and inspire them to rally against Roose Bolton, Ramsay Bolton, and Walder Frey for betraying the Starks.

====Family tree of House Stark====
===TV adaptation===
Rickon Stark is played by Art Parkinson in the television adaption of the book series. During an interview with Flicks and the City in 2014, Parkinson mentioned that he was not allowed by his parents to watch &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; due to its adult content, apart from a few scenes that were related to him. In a later interview published in the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; on 7 April 2015, Parkinson admitted that he was put off watching &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; after seeing a 3-year-old child getting his throat slit in one episode. In a later interview with IGN, he admitted that he had begun watching the series.

In an interview with IGN, Parkinson spoke about his return and death, saying: &quot;Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, &#x27;Listen, so that you don&#x27;t get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season.&#x27;&quot; He continued, &quot;Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character.&quot;

Parkinson has said that his fellow castmember Natalia Tena, who played Rickon&#x27;s travelling companion Osha, helped him with his acting. He also shared what he believes Rickon went through after the death of his father Ned Stark, saying &quot;After the death of his father, I think he became very independent and very angry, I think Rickon is a little bit more mature now. He&#x27;s been away for quite a long time at this point. I think he&#x27;s a bit more independent and stronger-willed.

Remarking on the character&#x27;s exit and death:

It was sad at first, but once I realized how I was going to die in it, then it was cool. It was a cool death, and it was always going to be a good death, so at the same time, I was pretty happy.

====Season 1–3====
Rickon Stark is Lord Eddard and Lady Catelyn&#x27;s youngest child, naturally aggressive, and strong-willed. His black direwolf Shaggydog shares these qualities. When Theon Greyjoy captures Winterfell in Season 2, Rickon hides in the crypts with Bran, Hodor, and the Wildling woman Osha. After Theon can&#x27;t seem to find where Rickon and Bran are, he has two farm boys killed and burned, to pass their charred bodies off as the Stark boys&#x27;. After Winterfell is sacked and burned, Rickon, Bran, Hodor, Osha, and the direwolves travel through the North. In Season 3 before they reach the Wall, Rickon, Osha, and Shaggydog split up from the rest of the group and head to Last Hearth, the seat house of the Umbers.

====Season 6====
Following Lord Greatjon Umber&#x27;s death, Rickon and Osha are betrayed by Greatjon&#x27;s heir Smalljon and handed over to the new Warden of the North, Ramsay Bolton, in order to secure an alliance with the Boltons against the wildlings Jon Snow has let through the Wall. To prove Rickon&#x27;s identity, Smalljon kills Shaggydog and presents his head to Ramsay. Ramsay kills Osha, locks Rickon in the dungeons, and sends a letter to Jon at Castle Black demanding the return of Sansa Stark (his wife) and threatening to kill Rickon if Jon does not comply. In retaliation, Jon gathers an army of Stark loyalists and marches on Winterfell, now occupied by House Bolton.

As the armies prepare for battle outside Winterfell, Ramsay brings out Rickon and orders him to run to Jon in one of his sadistic &quot;games&quot;, shooting arrows at Rickon in order to lure Jon into the open. Jon charges out to save Rickon, but Rickon is shot through the heart and dies almost instantly. In the aftermath of the ensuing battle, Rickon&#x27;s body is recovered, and Jon buries him in the crypt, alongside Ned&#x27;s remains.

Because many Northern noble houses were plotting against the Boltons in the books, the show&#x27;s decision to have them betray Rickon led to fan theories that the direwolf head Smalljon Umber showed to Ramsay was fake and the Umbers would turn on the Boltons. Parkinson dispelled the rumours, confirming the direwolf head was intended to be real. Rickon&#x27;s death scene referenced his first appearance in the series pilot, where he laughs at Bran&#x27;s poor archery shot before handing off arrows to the archer and running to stand by the target.

<doc id="1186166" wikidata="Q141770" url="?curid=1186166" title="Islam in Indonesia">
<text>Islam is the largest religion in Indonesia, with 87.06% of the Indonesian population identifying themselves as Muslims, based on civil registry data in 2023. In terms of denomination, the overwhelming majority are Sunni Muslims; the Pew Research Center estimates them as comprising ~99% of the country&#x27;s Muslim population in 2011, with the remaining 1% being Shia who are concentrated around Jakarta and about 400,000 Ahmadi as well.

In terms of schools of jurisprudence, based on demographic statistics, 99% of Indonesian Muslims mainly follow the Shafi&#x27;i school, although when asked, 56% do not adhere to any specific school. Trends of thought within Islam in Indonesia can be broadly categorized into two orientations: &quot;modernism&quot;, which closely adheres to orthodox theology while embracing modern learning, and &quot;traditionalism&quot;, which tends to follow the interpretations of local religious leaders and religious teachers at Islamic boarding schools (&quot;pesantren&quot;). There is also a historically important presence of a syncretic form of Islam known as &quot;kebatinan&quot;.

Islam in Indonesia is considered to have gradually spread through merchant activities by Arab Muslim traders, adoption by local rulers, and the influence of Sufism since the 13th century. During the late colonial era, it was adopted as a rallying banner against colonialism. A 2023 Pew Research Center report gave 93% of the adult Indonesian population identifying themselves as Muslim. Today, although Indonesia has an overwhelming Muslim majority, it is not an Islamic state, but constitutionally a secular state whose government officially recognizes six formal religions.

== Distribution ==


Muslims constitute a majority in most regions of Java, Sumatra, West Nusa Tenggara, Sulawesi, coastal areas of Kalimantan, and North Maluku. Muslims form distinct minorities in Papua, Bali, East Nusa Tenggara, parts of North Sumatra, most inland areas of Kalimantan, and North Sulawesi. Together, these non-Muslim areas originally constituted more than one-third of Indonesia prior to the massive transmigration effort sponsored by the Suharto government and recent spontaneous internal migration.

Internal migration has altered the demographic makeup of the country over the past three decades. It has increased the percentage of Muslims in formerly predominantly-Christian eastern parts of the country. By the early 1990s, Christians became a minority for the first time in some areas of the Maluku Islands. While government-sponsored transmigration from the heavily populated Java and Madura to less populated areas contributed to the increase in the Muslim population in the resettlement areas, no evidence suggests that the government intended to create a Muslim majority in Christian areas, and most Muslim migration seemed spontaneous. Regardless of its intent, the economic and political consequences of the transmigration policy contributed to religious conflicts in Maluku, Central Sulawesi, and to a lesser extent, Papua.

=== Islam in Indonesia by province &amp; region (2022) ===
This is a data table of the percentage of Muslims in Indonesia, provided by the Ministry of Religious Affairs:

== Denominations ==
The Islamic schools and branches in Indonesia reflect the activity of Islamic doctrines and organizations operating in Indonesia. In terms of denomination, Indonesia is a majority Sunni country with minority of other sects such as Shia Islam and Ahmadiyya. In terms of Islamic schools of jurisprudence, the Shafi&#x27;i school is dominant in Indonesia at large. Proliferation of the Shafi’i school is considered to be due to Arab merchants from the southern Arabian Peninsula who followed this school of jurisprudence.

Classical documentations divide Indonesian Muslims between &quot;nominal&quot; Muslims, or &quot;abangan&quot;, whose lifestyles are more oriented toward non-Islamic cultures, and &quot;orthodox&quot; Muslims, or &quot;santri&quot;, who adhere to the Orthodox Islamic norms. &quot;Abangan&quot; was considered an indigenous blend of native and Hindu-Buddhist beliefs with Islamic practices sometimes also called Javanism, &quot;kejawen&quot;, &quot;agama Jawa&quot;, or &quot;kebatinan&quot;. On Java, &quot;santri&quot; was not only referred to a person who was consciously and exclusively Muslim, but it also described persons who had removed themselves from the secular world to concentrate on devotional activities in Islamic schools called &quot;pesantren&quot;—literally &quot;the place of the &quot;santri&quot;&quot;. The terms and precise nature of this differentiation were in dispute throughout the history, and today it is considered obsolete. 


In the contemporary era, distinction is often made between &quot;traditionalism&quot; and &quot;modernism&quot;. Traditionalism, exemplified by the civil society organization Nahdlatul Ulama, is known as an ardent advocate of Islam Nusantara, a distinctive brand of Islam that has undergone interaction, contextualization, indigenization, interpretation, and vernacularization in line with socio-cultural conditions in Indonesia. Islam Nusantara promotes moderation, compassion, anti-radicalism, inclusiveness, and tolerance. On the other spectrum is modernism, which is heavily inspired by Islamic Modernism, and the civil society organization Muhammadiyah is a known ardent proponent. Modernist Muslims advocate for Islamic reform in Indonesia, which is perceived as having deviated from the historical Islamic orthodoxy. They emphasize the authority of the Qur&#x27;an and the Hadiths, and oppose syncretism and taqlid to the ulema. This division, however, also has been considered an oversimplification in recent analysis.

===&quot;Kebatinan&quot;===

Various other forms and adaptations of Islam are influenced by local cultures that hold different norms and perceptions throughout the archipelago. The principal example is a syncretic form of Islam known as &quot;kebatinan&quot;, which is an amalgam of animism, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic—especially Sufi—beliefs. This loosely organized current of thought and practice was legitimized in the 1945 constitution, and in 1973, when it was recognized as one of the &quot;agama&quot;, President Suharto counted himself as one of its adherents. The &quot;Kebatinan&quot; or &quot;Kepercayaan&quot; has no certain prophet, sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals; it has more to do with each adherent&#x27;s internalized transcendental vision and beliefs in their relations with the supreme being. As a result, there is inclusivity in that the &quot;kebatinan&quot; believer could identify themselves with one of six officially recognized religions, at least in their identity card, and still maintain their &quot;kebatinan&quot; belief and way of life. &quot;Kebatinan&quot; is generally characterized as mystical, and some varieties were concerned with spiritual self-control. Although many varieties were circulating in 1992, &quot;kebatinan&quot; often implies pantheistic worship because it encourages sacrifices and devotions to local and ancestral spirits. These spirits are believed to inhabit natural objects, human beings, artifacts, and grave sites of important &quot;wali&quot; (Muslim saints). Illness and other misfortunes are traced to such spirits. If sacrifices or pilgrimages fail to placate angry deities, the advice of a &quot;dukun&quot; or healer is sought. &quot;Kebatinan&quot;, while it connotes a denial of the militant universalism of orthodox Islam, moves toward a more internalized universalism. In this way, &quot;kebatinan&quot; moves toward eliminating the distinction between the universal and the local, the communal and the individual.

===Other branches===

More recent currents of Islamic thoughts that have taken roots include Islamism. Today, the leading Islamic political party in Indonesia is Prosperous Justice Party (PKS), which is known for serving as a regional wing of Muslim Brotherhood movement in Indonesia.

A small minority subscribe to the Shia Islam and Ahmadiyya. There are around one million Shia Muslims in Indonesia, or 0.5% of the country&#x27;s population, most of whom are concentrated around Jakarta. The historical Shia community is considered a descendant of the minority segment of Hadhrami immigrants, and it was spread from Aceh, originally a center of Shia Islam in Indonesia. In the contemporary era, interests toward Shia Islam grew after the Iranian Islamic Revolution, since which a number of Shia publications were translated into Indonesian. Another minority Islamic sect is Ahmadiyya. The Association of Religion Data Archives estimates that there are around 400,000 Ahmadi Muslims in Indonesia, spread over 542 branches across the country. Ahmadiyya history in Indonesia began since the missionary activity during the 1920s established the movement in Tapaktuan, Aceh. Both Shia and Ahmadi Muslims have been facing increasing intolerance and persecutions by reactionary and radical Islamic groups.

=== Organizations ===

In Indonesia, civil society organizations have historically held distinct and significant weight within the Muslim society. These various institutions have contributed greatly to both the intellectual discourse and public sphere for the culmination of new thoughts and sources for communal movements. 60% of 200 million Indonesian Muslims identify either as Nahdlatul Ulama or Muhammadiyah, making these organizations a &#x27;steel frame&#x27; of Indonesian civil society.

Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the largest traditionalist organization, focuses on many of the activities such as social, religious and education and indirectly operates a majority of the country&#x27;s Islamic boarding schools. Claiming 40 to 60 million followers, NU is Indonesia&#x27;s largest organization and perhaps the world&#x27;s largest Islamic group. Founded in 1926, NU has a nationwide presence but remains strongest in rural Java. It follows the ideology of Ahle Sunnah wal Jamaah with Sufism of Imam Ghazali and Junaid Bagdadi. Many NU followers give great deference to the views, interpretations, and instructions of senior NU religious figures, alternatively called Kyais or Ulama. The organization has long advocated religious moderation and communal harmony. On the political level, NU, the progressive Consultative Council of Indonesian Muslims (Masyumi), and two other parties were forcibly streamlined into a single Islamic political party in 1973—the United Development Party (PPP). Such cleavages may have weakened NU as an organized political entity, as demonstrated by the NU withdrawal from active political competition, but as a popular religious force, NU showed signs of good health and a capacity to frame national debates.

The leading national modernist social organization, Muhammadiyah, has branches throughout the country and approximately 29 million followers. Founded in 1912, Muhammadiyah runs mosques, prayer houses, clinics, orphanages, poorhouses, schools, public libraries, and universities. On February 9, Muhammadiyah&#x27;s central board and provincial chiefs agreed to endorse a former Muhammadiyah chairman&#x27;s presidential campaign. This marked the organization&#x27;s first formal foray into partisan politics and generated controversy among members.

Some smaller Islamic organizations cover a broad range of Islamic doctrinal orientations. At one end of the ideological spectrum lies the controversial Islam Liberal Network (JIL), which aims to promote a pluralist and more liberal interpretation of Islamic thinking.

Equally controversial are groups at the other end of this spectrum such as Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia (HTI), which advocate a pan-Islamic caliphate and the full implementation of Shari&#x27;a, the Indonesian Mujahedeen Council (MMI), which advocates implementation of Shari&#x27;a as a precursor to an Islamic state, and the sometimes violent Islamic Defenders Front (FPI). Countless other small organizations fall between these poles. Another small organization, the Indonesian Islamic Propagation Institute (LDII), continues to grow.

==History==
===Spread of Islam (13th century – 1602)===
There is evidence of Arab Muslim traders entering Indonesia as early as the 8th century. However, it was not until the end of the 13th century that the spread of Islam began. At first, Islam was introduced through Arab Muslim traders, and then the missionary activity by scholars. It was further aided by the adoption by the local rulers and the conversion of the elites. The missionaries had originated from several countries and regions, initially from South Asia (i.e. Gujarat) and Southeast Asia (i.e. Champa), and later from the southern Arabian Peninsula (i.e. Hadhramaut).

In the 13th century, Islamic polities began to emerge on the northern coast of Sumatra. Marco Polo, on his way home from China in 1292, reported at least one Muslim town. The first evidence of a Muslim dynasty is the gravestone, dated AH 696 (1297 CE), of Sultan Malik al Saleh, the first Muslim ruler of Samudera Pasai Sultanate. By the end of the 13th century, Islam had been established in Northern Sumatra.

In general, local traders and the royalty of major kingdoms were the first to adopt the new religion. The spread of Islam among the ruling class was precipitated as Muslim traders married the local women, with some of the wealthier traders marrying into the elite ruling families. Indonesian people, as local rulers and the royals did, began to adopt Islam, and subsequently, their subjects mirrored their conversion. Although the spread was slow and gradual, the limited evidence suggests that it accelerated in the 15th century, as the military power of Malacca Sultanate in the Malay Peninsula and other Islamic Sultanates that dominated the region were aided by episodes of Muslim coup such as in 1446, wars and superior control of maritime trading and ultimate markets.

By the 14th century, Islam had been established in northeast Malaya, Brunei, the southwestern Philippines, and among some courts of coastal East and Central Java, and by the 15th century, in Malacca and other areas of the Malay Peninsula. The 15th century saw the decline of the Hindu Javanese Majapahit Empire, as Muslim traders from Arabia, India, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, and also China began to dominate the regional trade that was once controlled by Javanese Majapahit traders. Chinese Ming dynasty provided systematic support to Malacca. Ming Chinese Zheng He&#x27;s voyages (1405 to 1433) is credited for creating Chinese Muslim settlement in Palembang and north coast of Java. Malacca actively encouraged the conversion to Islam in the region, while Ming fleet actively established Chinese-Malay Muslim community in northern coastal Java, thus creating a permanent opposition to the Hindus of Java. By 1430, the expeditions had established Muslim Chinese, Arab and Malay communities in northern ports of Java such as Semarang, Demak, Tuban, and Ampel; thus, Islam began to gain a foothold in the northern coast of Java. Malacca prospered under Chinese Ming protection, while the Majapahit were steadily pushed back. Dominant Muslim kingdoms during this time included Samudera Pasai in northern Sumatra, Malacca Sultanate in eastern Sumatra, Demak Sultanate in central Java, Gowa Sultanate in southern Sulawesi, and the sultanates of Ternate and Tidore in the Maluku Islands to the east.

Indonesia&#x27;s historical inhabitants were animists, Hindus, and Buddhists. Through assimilation related to trade, royal conversion, and conquest, however, Islam had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. During this process, &quot;cultural influences from the Hindu-Buddhist era were mostly tolerated or incorporated into Islamic rituals.&quot; Islam did not obliterate the preexisting culture; rather, it incorporated and embedded the local customs and non-Islamic elements among rules and arts, and reframed them as the Islamic traditions.
In part, the strong presence of Sufism has been considered a major enabler of this syncretism between Islam and other religions. Sufism retained strong influence especially among the Islamic scholars arrived during the early days of the spread of Islam in Indonesia, and many Sufi orders such as Naqshbandiyah and Qadiriyya have attracted new Indonesian converts. They have proceeded to branch into different local divisions. Sufi mysticism which had proliferated during this course had shaped the syncretic, eclectic and pluralist nature of Islam in Indonesian during the time. Prolific Sufis from the Indonesian archipelago were already known in Arabic sources as far back as the 13th Century. One of the most important Indonesian Sufis from this time is Hamzah Fansuri, a poet, and writer from the 16th century. The preeminence of Sufism among Islam in Indonesian continued until the shift of external influence from South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula, whose scholars brought more orthodox teachings and perceptions of Islam.

The gradual adoption of Islam by Indonesians was perceived as a threat by some ruling powers. As port towns adopted Islam, it undermined the waning power of the east Javanese Hindu/Buddhist Majapahit kingdom in the 16th century. Javanese rulers eventually fled to Bali, where over 2.5 million Indonesians practiced their version of Hinduism. Unlike coastal Sumatra, where Islam was adopted by elites and masses alike, partly as a way to counter the economic and political power of the Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms, the elites only gradually accepted Islam in the interior of Java, and then only as a formal legal and religious context for Javanese spiritual culture. The eastern islands remained largely animist until they adopted Islam and Christianity in the 17th and 18th centuries, whereas Bali still retains a Hindu majority. By the late 15th century, the Majapahit Empire in Java had begun to decline. This last Hindu kingdom in Java fell under the rising power of the Islamized Sultanate of Demak in the 1520s; in 1527, the Muslim ruler renamed newly conquered Sunda Kelapa as Jayakarta meaning &quot;precious victory&quot;, which was eventually contracted to Jakarta. Islam in Java then began to spread formally, building on the spiritual influences of the revered Sufi saints Wali Songo (or Nine Saints).

Despite Islam being one of the most significant developments in Indonesian history, historical evidence remains fragmentary and uninformative. The understanding of how Islam arrived in Indonesia is limited; there is considerable debate among scholars about what conclusions can be drawn about the conversion of Indonesian peoples. The primary evidence, at least of the earlier stages of the process, are gravestones and a few travelers&#x27; accounts, but these can only show that indigenous Muslims were in a certain place at a certain time. This evidence is insufficient to comprehensively explain more complicated matters, such as how lifestyles were affected by the new religion or how deeply it affected societies.

=== Early modern period (1700–1945) ===
The Dutch entered the region in the 17th century, attracted by its wealth established through the region&#x27;s natural resources and trade. The entering of the Dutch resulted in a monopoly of the central trading ports. However, this helped the spread of Islam, as local Muslim traders relocated to the smaller and remoter ports, establishing Islam into the rural provinces. Towards the beginning of the 20th century, &quot;Islam became a rallying banner to resist colonialism&quot;.

During this time the introduction of steam-powered transportation and printing technology was facilitated by European expansion. As a result, the interaction between Indonesia and the rest of the Islamic world, particularly the Middle East, had significantly increased. In Mecca, the number of pilgrims grew exponentially to the point that Indonesians were markedly referred as &quot;rice of the Hejaz&quot;. The exchange of scholars and students was also increased. Around two hundred Southeast Asian students, mostly Indonesian, were studying in Cairo during the mid-1920s, and around two thousand citizens of Saudi Arabia were of Indonesian descent. Those who returned from the Middle East had become the backbone of religious training in pesantrens.

Concurrently, a number of newly founded religious thoughts and movements in the Islamic world had inspired the Islamic current in Indonesia. In particular, Islamic Modernism, which was inspired by Islamic scholar Muhammad &#x27;Abduh, aimed to return to the original scripture of the religion. The Modernist movement in Indonesia had criticized the syncretic nature of Islam in Indonesia. It advocated for the reform of Islam and the elimination of perceived un-Islamic elements within the traditions. The movement also aspired to incorporate elements of modernity into Islam and, for instance, built schools that combined an Islamic and secular curricula, and was unique in that it trained women as preachers for women. Through the activities of the reformers and the reactions of their opponents, Indonesian society became more firmly structured along communal (&quot;aliran&quot;) rather than class lines.

Reformist movements had especially taken roots in the Minangkabau area of West Sumatra, where its ulema played an important role in the early reform movement. Renowned Minangkabau imam in Mecca Ahmad Khatib al-Minangkabawi had contributed greatly to the reformist training. He was single-handedly responsible for educating many of the essential Muslim figures during this time. In 1906, Tahir bin Jalaluddin, a disciple of al-Minangkabawi, published in &quot;al-Iman&quot;, the Malay newspaper in Singapore. Five years later followed publication of &quot;Al-Munir&quot; magazine by Abdullah Ahmad in Padang. In the first 20th century, Muslim modernist school arose in West Sumatra, such as Adabiah (1909), Diniyah Putri (1911), and Sumatera Thawalib (1915). The movement had also attained its supporter base in Java. In Surakarta, leftist Muslim Haji Misbach published in the monthly paper &quot;Medan Moeslimin&quot; and the periodical &quot;Islam Bergerak&quot;. In Jogjakarta, Ahmad Dahlan, also a disciple of al-Minangkabawi, established Muhammadiyah in 1911, spearheading the creation of Islamic mass organization. Muhammadiyah rapidly expanded its influence across the archipelago, with Abdul Karim Amrullah establishing the West Sumatra chapter in 1925 for instance. Other modernist organizations include Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya (1914) and PERSIS (1923). Soon after, traditionalist Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) was founded in 1926 by Hasyim Asy&#x27;ari, another disciple of al-Minangkabawi, in response to the perceived growing threat of reformist waves. Other traditionalist organizations included the Islamic Education Association (Perti) (1930) and Lombok-based Nahdlatul Wathan (1953).

A combination of reformist thoughts and the growing sense of sovereignty had led to the brief development of Islam as a vehicle for the political struggle against the Dutch colonialism. The earliest example is Padri movement from Minangkabau. Padri movement was inspired by Wahhabism during its inception, and aimed at the purification of Islam in Indonesia reciprocally. The movement eventually turned into a struggle against Dutch colonialism during the Padri War (1803–1837), although at the same time the Padri movement also fought the Adat tribes who were a semi secular Minangkabau nobility and traditional chiefs. One of the leaders, Tuanku Imam Bonjol, was declared a National Hero of Indonesia. Sarekat Islam championed Islam as a common identity among vast and diverse ethnic and cultural compositions throughout the archipelago, especially against the perceived enemy of the Christian masters. Educational institutions such as Jamiat Kheir also supported the development. In the process, Islam gave the sense of identity which contributed to the cultivation of Indonesian nationalism. Under this circumstance, early Indonesian nationalists were eager to reflect themselves as a part of the &quot;ummah&quot; (worldwide Islamic community). They also had interests in Islamic issues, such as re-establishment of Caliphate and the movements such as pan-Islamism. For these reasons, Dutch colonial administration saw Islam as a potential threat and treated the returning pilgrims and students from the Middle East with particular suspicion. A similar Islamic-nationalist organization Union of Indonesian Muslims (PERMI) faced severe crackdown by the Dutch colonial government, leading to the arrest of its members including Rasuna Said.

However, Islam as a vehicle of Indonesian nationalism had gradually waned in the face of the emergence of secular nationalism and more radical political thoughts such as communism. The inner struggle among Sarekat Islam between the reformists and the traditionalists had also contributed to its decline. This created a vacuum within the Muslim community for the leadership role, filled by civil society organizations such as Muhammadiyah, NU, more puritanical PERSIS, and Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya. These organizations upheld non-political position and concentrated on the social reforms and proselytization. This trend persisted during the Japanese occupation as well, whose occupational administration took the ambivalent stance toward Islam. Islam was considered both as a potential friend against the Western imperialism and a potential foe against their vision of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

=== Post-independence (since 1945) ===

Indonesia became the world&#x27;s second-largest Muslim-majority country after its independence in 1945. The separation of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 made it the world&#x27;s most populous Muslim-majority country. Post-independence had seen the most significant upheaval of the Muslim society on various aspects of society. This owes to the independence, increased literacy and educational attainment among Muslims, funding from the Middle East, and all the more accelerated exchange between other Muslim countries.

The subsequent development of the Muslim society had brought Indonesia even closer to the center of Islamic intellectual activity. A number of scholars and writers have contributed to the development of Islamic interpretations within the Indonesian context, often through the intellectual exchange between the foreign contemporaries. Abdul Malik Karim Amrullah (Hamka) was a modernist writer and religious leader who is credited for &quot;Tafsir al-Azhar&quot;. It was the first comprehensive Qur&#x27;anic exegesis (&quot;tafsir&quot;) written in the Indonesian, which attempted to construe Islamic principles within the Malay-Minangkabau culture. Harun Nasution was a pioneering scholar adhered to the humanist and rationalist perspectives in Indonesian intellectual landscape, advocating for a position described as neo-Mutazilite. Nurcholish Madjid (Cak Nur) was a highly influential scholar who is credited for cultivating the modernist and reformist discourse, primarily influenced by Pakistani Islamic philosopher Fazlur Rahman. Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur), later president of Indonesia, went through the Islamic education at the University of Baghdad, and later became the central figure of Indonesia&#x27;s liberal Islamic trend. Quraish Shihab compiled &quot;Tafsir Al-Mishbah&quot;, which is considered a standard of Indonesian Islamic interpretation among mainstream Indonesian Islamic intellectuals.

Post-independence had also seen an expansion in the activity of Islamic organizations, especially regarding missionary activities (&quot;dawah&quot;) and Islamization of lifestyles. The Ministry of Religion reported that as late as the 1960s, only a minority of Muslims were practicing daily prayers and almsgiving. This status had drastically changed through the course of endeavor by the organizations such as the Indonesian Islamic Dawah Council (DDII) led by Mohammad Natsir, not to mention aforementioned Muhammadiyah, NU, and PERSIS. Among Islamic clergy, Indonesian Ulema Council (MUI) has been operating as an authority regarding the legislative and juridical issues of Islam, and responsible for guiding the general direction of Islamic life in Indonesia, primarily through the issuance of &quot;fatwa&quot;. More recently, organizations such as DDII and LIPIA have been acting as instruments of the propagation of Salafism or Wahhabism with funding from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf monarchies, that &quot;has contributed to a more conservative, more intolerant atmosphere&quot; and eager to strip heritages of traditional Indonesian Islam of local customs influenced by Animism ritual and Sufi teaching. On the political arena, the coalition of Muhammadiyah and NU have established the Masyumi Party, which served as a mainstream Islamic political party until its dissolution in 1960. Meanwhile, militant Islamic organizations such as Darul Islam, Laskar Jihad, and Jemaah Islamiyah had also seen its growth, aided mostly by foreign funding as well.

Upon independence, there was significant controversy surrounding Islam&#x27;s role in politics, which had caused enormous tensions. The contentions were mainly surrounding the position of Islam in the constitution of Indonesia. Islamic groups have aspired for the supreme status of Islam within the constitutional framework by the inclusion of the Jakarta Charter, which obliges Muslim to abide by shari&#x27;a. The Sukarno regime denied this with the implementation of the more pluralist constitution heeding to the ideology of Pancasila, which was deemed non-Islamic. Eventually, Indonesia adopted a civil code instead of an Islamic one. However, the struggle for the constitutional amendment continued. The hostility against the Sukarno regime was manifested on various other occasions. Most notably the anti-communist genocide perpetuated actively by Ansor Youth Movement, the youth wing of NU (which was initially supportive of the Sukarno regime) and other Islamic groups. Muslims adhering to the syncretic form of Islam known as &quot;Abangan&quot; had also become the target of this mass killing. Communism was considered hostile by Muslims due to perceived atheistic nature and the tendency of landowners being local Islamic chiefs.

During the New Order, there was an intensification of religious belief among Muslims. Initially hoped as the ally of Islamic groups, the New Order quickly became the antagonist following its attempt to reform educational and marital legislation to more secular-oriented code. This met strong opposition, with marriage law left as Islamic code as a result. Suharto had also attempted at consolidating Pancasila as the only state ideology, which was also turned down by the fierce resistance of Islamic groups. Under the Suharto regime, containment of Islam as a political ideology had led to all the Islamic parties forcibly unite under one government-supervised Islamic party, the United Development Party (PPP). Certain Islamic organizations were incorporated by the Suharto regime, most notably MUI, DDII, and Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) to absorb the political Islam for the regime&#x27;s gain. With Suharto&#x27;s resignation in 1998, &quot;the structure that repressed religion and society collapsed.&quot;

During the beginning of the &quot;Reformasi&quot; era, the ascendance of Islamic political parties had led to the election of Abdurrahman Wahid, the leader of NU, as the fourth president of Indonesia, and the appointment of Amien Rais, the leader of Muhammadiyah, as the chairman of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly. This era was briefly marked by the collapse of social order, erosion of central administrative control, and law enforcement breakdown. They resulted in violent conflicts in which Islamic groups were involved, including separatism of Aceh where the more conservative form of Islam is favored, and sectarian clashes between Muslims and Christians in Maluku and Poso. With the collapse of the establishment, MUI began distancing themselves from the government and attempted to exercise wider influence toward Indonesia&#x27;s Islamic civil society. This led to the issuance of controversial 2005 fatwa condemning the notion of liberalism, secularism and pluralism, and subsequent criticism by progressive intellectuals. However, the political transition from authoritarianism to democracy went relatively smoothly due considerably to the commitment of tolerance by mass organizations such as NU and Muhammadiyah. This made Muslim civil society a key part of Indonesia&#x27;s democratic transition.

Currently, Muslims are considered fully represented in the democratically elected parliament. There are numbers of active Islamic political parties, namely Muhammadiyah-oriented National Mandate Party (PAN), NU-oriented National Awakening Party (PKB), and Islamist Prosperous Justice Party (PKS). The democratization had resulted in diversification of religious influence as well, with the relative decline in the influence of established institutions such as NU and Muhammadiyah, and the rise of smaller-scale organizations and individual preachers such as Abdullah Gymnastiar (Aa Gym) and Yusuf Mansur. During the early 2000s, the return of Abu Bakar Bashir, who was in exile during the Suharto era as a spiritual leader of Jihadism in Indonesia, resulted in the series of bombing attacks, which have been largely contained recently. Contemporary Islam in Indonesia is analyzed in various ways, with certain analysis consider it as becoming more conservative. At the same time, others deem it as &quot;too big to fail&quot; for the radicalization.
Conservative development has seen the emergence of vigilante group Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), persecution against Ahmadiyya exemplified by MUI&#x27;s fatwa, and the nationwide protest in 2016 against the incumbent governor of Jakarta Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (Ahok) accused of blasphemy. Liberal development has seen the emergence of groups such as Liberal Islamic Network (JIL), formation of Islam Nusantara as a collective identity of pluralist Islam, and claimed as the declining support for the Islamist political parties.
Current President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) advocates a strict separation of religion and politics. His position is supported by major Muslim organizations such as the NU. However, it is interpreted and condemned by some members of the MUI as a form of secularism. At the same time, former PKS chairman Sohibul Iman criticized Jokowi&#x27;s position as having the potential of increasing tension in Indonesian society. In 2017, a &quot;Government Regulation in Lieu of Law&quot; (&quot;Peraturan Pemerintah Pengganti Undang-Undang&quot; or &quot;Perppu&quot;) regulating mass organizations was passed by the People&#x27;s Representative Council and ratified by the president, which led to the ban of the Indonesian branch of Hizbut Tahrir for rejecting and undermining the state ideology Pancasila. FPI was dissolved in 2020, with its members being involved in criminal cases and allegedly linked to terrorist groups. Since 2019, MUI chairman and former NU leader Ma&#x27;ruf Amin has been the Vice President of Indonesia.

== Culture ==
===Arts===
Several artistic traditions in Indonesia, many of which existed since the pre-Islamic era, have absorbed Islamic influence and evolved in artistic expression and attachment of religious implications.

====Batik====

The Indonesian dyeing art known as Batik has incorporated Islamic influence through the inclusion of motifs and designs revering the Islamic artistic traditions, such as Islamic calligraphy and Islamic interlace patterns, and the religious codes prescribing the avoidance of the depictions of human images. Islamic influence of batik is especially pronounced in the batik tradition situated around the Javanese region of Cirebon, which forms the part of coastal Javanese batik heritage, the Central Sumatran region of Jambi which had thriving trade relations with Javanese coastal cities, and the South Sumatran region of Bengkulu where the strong sense of Islamic identity was cultivated. Jambi batik influenced the formation of Malaysian batik tradition which also encompasses the Islamic characters such as adopting the plants, floral motifs and geometrical designs, and the avoidance of interpretation of human and animal images as idolatry. Minangkabau batik tradition is known for &quot;batiak tanah liek&quot; (clay batik), which uses clay as a dye for the fabric, and embraces the animal and floral motifs. Bengkulu batik tradition is known for &quot;batik besurek&quot;, which literary means &quot;batik with letters&quot; as they draw inspiration from Arabic calligraphy. Islamic batik tradition occasionally depicts Buraq as well, an Islamic mythical creature from the heavens which transported the Islamic prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Jerusalem and back during the Isra and Mi&#x27;raj.

====Wayang====
The Indonesian performing art of Wayang has a variety known as &quot;Wayang sadat&quot; which has deployed Wayang for Islam&#x27;s religious teachings. There is also &quot;Wayang Menak&quot; which is derived from Javanese-Islamic literature &quot;Serat Menak&quot; which is a Javanese rendering of Malay Hikayat Amir Hamzah, which ultimately derived from Persian Hamzanama, tells the adventure of Amir Hamzah, the uncle of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In Lombok, vernacular Wayang Kulit is known as &quot;Wayang Sasak&quot;, which incorporates puppets similar to the Javanese &quot;Wayang Menak&quot; and based on the adventures of Amir Hamzah as well.

When Islam began spreading in Indonesia, the display of God or gods in human form was prohibited. Thus this style of painting and shadow play was suppressed. King Raden Patah of Demak, Java, wanted to see the wayang in its traditional form but failed to obtain permission from Muslim religious leaders. Religious leaders attempted to skirt the Muslim prohibition by converting the wayang golek into wayang purwa made from leather and displayed only the shadow instead of the puppets themselves.

====Dance====

The history of dance in Indonesia can be roughly divided into the Hindu-Buddhist period and Islamic period. During the Islamic period, the vernacular and dharmic dances continued to be popular and tolerated. Artists and performers were using the Hindu-Buddhist era styles but incorporated stories with Islamic implications and more modest clothing that conformed to the Islamic teaching. This change is markedly seen in &quot;Tari Persembahan&quot; from Jambi, in which the dancers are still adorned with the intricate gold of the Hindu/Buddhist era but the clothing is more modest. Newer styles of dance were introduced in the Islamic period, including Zapin dances of the Malay people and Gayonese Saman dance in Aceh, which adopted dance styles and music typical of Arab and Persia, and combined them with indigenous styles to form a newer generation of dance in the era of Islam. Saman dance was initially performed during the Islamic missionary activity (&quot;dawah&quot;) or during the certain customary events such as the commemoration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s birthday. Today more commonly performed during any official events. The adoption of Persian and Arab musical instruments, such as &quot;rebana&quot;, &quot;tambur&quot;, and &quot;gendang&quot; drums that has become the main instrument in Islamic dances, as well as the chant that often quotes Islamic chants.

===Architecture===


The architecture of Indonesia after the spread of Islam was prominently characterized by the religious structure with the combination of Islamic implications and Indonesian architectural traditions. Initial forms of the mosque, for example, were predominantly built in the vernacular Indonesian architectural style which employs Hindu, Buddhist or Chinese architectural elements, and notably didn&#x27;t equip orthodox form of Islamic architectural elements such as dome and minaret. Vernacular style mosques in Java is distinguished by its tall timber multi-level roofs known as &quot;tajug&quot;, similar to the pagodas of Balinese Hindu temples and derived from Indian and Chinese architectural styles. Another characteristic of Javanese style mosque is the usage of gamelan drum instrument &quot;bedug&quot; as a substitute of prayer call (&quot;adhan&quot;). Bedug is often installed in the roofed front porch attached to the building known as &quot;serambi&quot;. Bedug is commonly used for prayer call or the signal during Ramadan throughout the Javanese mosques up until today. Prominent examples of mosques with vernacular Javanese designs are Demak Mosque in Demak, built in 1474, and the Menara Kudus Mosque in Kudus, built in 1549, whose minaret is thought to be the watchtower of an earlier Hindu temple. Vernacular style mosques in Minangkabau area is distinguished by its multi-layer roof made of fiber resembling &quot;Rumah Gadang&quot;, the Minangkabau residential building. Prominent examples of mosques with vernacular Minangkabau designs are Bingkudu Mosque, founded in 1823 by the Padris, and Jami Mosque of Taluak, built in 1860. In West Sumatra, there is also a tradition of multi-purpose religious architecture known as surau which is often built in vernacular Minangkabau style as well, with three- or five-tiered roofs and woodcarvings engraved in the facade. Vernacular style mosques in Kalimantan is influenced by the Javanese counterparts, exemplified by the Banjar architecture which employs three- or five-tiered roof with the steep top roof, compared to the relatively low-angled roof of Javanese mosque. The employment of stilts in some mosques, a separate roof on the mihrab. Prominent examples including Heritage Mosque of Banua Lawas and Jami Mosque of Datu Abulung, both in South Kalimantan.

Only after the 19th century, the mosques began incorporating more orthodox styles imported during the Dutch colonial era. Architectural style during this era is characterized by Indo-Islamic or Moorish Revival architectural elements, with onion-shaped dome and arched vault. Minaret was not introduced to full extent until the 19th century, and its introduction was accompanied by the importation of architectural styles of Persian and Ottoman origin with the prominent usage of calligraphy and geometric patterns. During this time, many of the older mosques built in traditional style were renovated, and small domes were added to their square hipped roofs. Simultaneously, eclectic architecture integrating European and Chinese styles was introduced as well. Prominent examples of Indonesian Islamic architecture with foreign styles including Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in Banda Aceh, completed in 1881, designed in Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture, and Great Mosque of Palembang in Palembang, initially completed in 1798, and later expanded with integrating Chinese, Malay and European architectural styles harmonized together.

===Clothing===

The &quot;peci&quot;, &quot;songkok&quot;, or &quot;kopiah&quot; in Java, is a velvet cap with generally black color worn by Muslim men. It is originated within the Malay culture and can be traced back to the Ottoman fez. It is worn during the formal occasions, including Islamic religious occasions such as Idul Fitr and Idul Adha, as well as congregational prayers when visiting mosques.

The &quot;sarong&quot; is the popular garment worn mostly by Muslim men, notably in Java, Bali, Sumatra and Kalimantan. It is a large tube or length of fabric, often wrapped around the waist. The fabric often has woven plaid or checkered patterns, or brightly colored by means of batik or ikat dyeing. Many modern sarongs have printed designs, often depicting animals or plants. It is mostly worn as a casual wear but often worn during the congregational prayers as well. The &quot;baju koko&quot;, also known as &quot;baju takwa&quot;, is a traditional Malay-Indonesian Muslim shirt for men, worn usually during the formal religious occasions, such as Idul Fitr festival or Friday prayers. It is often worn with the sarong and peci.

The &quot;kerudung&quot; is an Indonesian Muslim women&#x27;s hijab, which is a loosely worn cloth over the head. Unlike completely covered counterpart of &quot;jilbab&quot;, parts of hairs and neck are still visible. The &quot;jilbab&quot; is a more conservative Muslim women&#x27;s hijab, adopted from Middle Eastern style, and usually worn by more conservative Muslim women. Unlike &quot;kerudung&quot;, hair and neck are completely covered. &quot;Jilbab&quot; in Indonesian context means headscarf. It does not designate the long overgarment as implied in the Muslim society in other countries.

===Festival===

Muslim holy days celebrated in Indonesia include the &quot;Isra and Mi&#x27;raj&quot;, &quot;Idul Fitr&quot;, &quot;Idul Adha&quot;, the Islamic New Year, and the &quot;Prophet&#x27;s Birthday&quot;.

====Hajj====
The government has a monopoly on organising the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. In February 2010, following the latest Hajj, the Department of Religious Affairs drew sharp criticism for mismanaging the registration of approximately 30,000 prospective pilgrims after they had paid the required fees. The government unilaterally expanded the country&#x27;s quota of 205,000 pilgrims, claiming it had informal approval from the Saudi Government, an assertion that proved incorrect. Members of the House of Representatives have sponsored a bill to set up an independent institution, thus ending the department&#x27;s monopoly.

====Tabuik====

&quot;Tabuik&quot; is a Shia Islamic occasion in the Minangkabau region, particularly in the city of Pariaman and it is a part of the Shia days of remembrance among the local community. &quot;Tabuik&quot; refers to the towering funeral biers carried during the commemoration. The event has been performed every year since the Day of Ashura in 1831, when the practice was introduced to the region by the Shia &quot;sepoy&quot; troops from India who were stationed—and later settled—there during the British Raj. The festival enacts the Battle of Karbala and plays the &quot;tassa&quot; and &quot;dhol&quot; drums.

==Society==
===Gender===
To a significant degree, the way in which Islam manifests in Indonesia&#x27;s lifestyle is unique and reflective of Southeast Asian culture. However, there have been several instances of discrimination for women in the work field, such as Hijabophobia, resulting in demonstrations.

====Gender segregation====
Many Muslims in Indonesia have a relaxed view on social relations between sexes. Strict sex segregation is usually limited to religious settings, such as in mosques during prayer. It is common for boys and girls to study together in their classroom in both public and Islamic schools. Nevertheless, there is a growing influence of a more traditional, orthodox view of sex segregation in public places. This is done to avoid contact between opposite sexes; for example, some women wearing hijab might refuse to shake hands or converse with men. However, the number of sexual harassment cases in Indonesia have increased, with the majority of victims being women who wear hijab.

== Politics ==
Although it has an overwhelming Muslim majority, the country is neither an Islamic state nor an Islamic republic, similar to that of Turkey and Kazakhstan. From a Pew Research Center (PEW) opinion poll in 2010, Indonesia is the only country, among the five countries surveyed with a Muslim majority population, whose citizens tend to identify more with their nationality than their religion. According Article 29 of Indonesia&#x27;s Constitution however affirms that &quot;the state is based on the belief in the one supreme God.&quot; Over the past 50 years, many Islamic groups have opposed this secular and pluralist direction, and sporadically have sought to establish an Islamic state. However, the country&#x27;s mainstream Muslim community, including influential social organisations such as Muhammadiyah and NU, reject the idea. Proponents of an Islamic state argued unsuccessfully in 1945 and throughout the parliamentary democracy period of the 1950s for the inclusion of language (the &quot;Jakarta Charter&quot;) in the Constitution&#x27;s preamble making it obligatory for Muslims to follow shari&#x27;a.

An Islamist political movement aspired to form an Islamic state, established &quot;Darul Islam/Tentara Islam Indonesia&quot; (DI/TII) in 1949, which launched an armed rebellion against the Republic throughout the 1950s. The outbreak of the Islamic state in multiple provinces, started in West Java led by Kartosoewirjo, the rebellion also spread to Central Java, South Sulawesi and Aceh. The Islamist armed rebellion was successfully cracked down in 1962. The movement has alarmed the Sukarno administration to the potential threat of political Islam against the Indonesian Republic.

During the Suharto regime (1966–1998), the government prohibited all advocacy of an Islamic state. This timeframe also coincided with an increase in the number of Liberal Muslims in Indonesia from 1970 until 2005. However, with the loosening of restrictions on freedom of speech and religion that followed Suharto&#x27;s fall in 1998, proponents of the &quot;Jakarta Charter&quot; resumed advocacy efforts. This proved the case before the 2002 Annual Session of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly (MPR), a body that has the power to change the Constitution. The nationalist political parties, regional representatives elected by provincial legislatures, and appointed police, military, and functional representatives, who together held a majority of seats in the MPR, rejected proposals to amend the Constitution to include shari&#x27;a, and the measure never came to a formal vote. The MPR approved changes to the Constitution that mandated that the Government increase &quot;faith and piety&quot; in education. This decision, seen as a compromise to satisfy Islamist parties, set the scene for a controversial education bill signed into law in July 2003. 

On 9 May 2017, Indonesian politician Basuki Tjahaja Purnama was sentenced to two years in prison by the North Jakarta District Court after being found guilty of committing blasphemy. The case later led to a growth in the movement against electing non-Islamic leaders, with 59 percent of Indonesian people not wanting to elect non-Muslim leaders as of 2018. It also contributed in increasing number of identity politics in Indonesia as carried out by Anies Baswedan in 2017, which he referred as inevitable because identity is always related as a nature of the candidate.

=== Shari&#x27;a in Aceh ===
Shari&#x27;a generated debate and concern during 2004, and many of the issues raised touched on religious freedom. Aceh remained the only part of the country where the central Government specifically authorised shari&#x27;a. Law 18/2001 granted Aceh special autonomy and included authority for Aceh to establish a system of shari&#x27;a as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, national civil and criminal law. Before it could take effect, the law required the provincial legislature to approve local regulations (&quot;qanun&quot;) incorporating shari&#x27;a precepts into the legal code. Law 18/2001 states that the shari&#x27;a courts would be &quot;free from outside influence by any side.&quot; Article 25(3) states that the authority of the court will only apply to Muslims. Article 26(2) names the national Supreme Court as the court of appeal for Aceh&#x27;s shari&#x27;a courts.

Aceh is the only province that has shari&#x27;a courts. Religious leaders responsible for drafting and implementing the shari&#x27;a regulations stated that they had no plans to apply criminal sanctions for violations of shari&#x27;a. Islamic law in Aceh, they said, would not provide for strict enforcement of &quot;fiqh&quot; or &quot;hudud&quot;, but rather would codify traditional Acehnese Islamic practice and values such as discipline, honesty, and proper behaviour. They claimed enforcement would not depend on the police but rather on public education and societal consensus.

Because Muslims make up the overwhelming majority of Aceh&#x27;s population, the public largely accepted shari&#x27;a, which in most cases merely regularised common social practices. For example, a majority of women in Aceh already covered their heads in public. Provincial and district governments established shari&#x27;a bureaus to handle public education about the new system, and local Islamic leaders, especially in North Aceh and Pidie, called for greater government promotion of shari&#x27;a as a way to address mounting social ills. The imposition of martial law in Aceh in May 2003 had little impact on the implementation of shari&#x27;a. The Martial Law Administration actively promoted shari&#x27;a as a positive step toward social reconstruction and reconciliation. Some human rights and women&#x27;s rights activists complained that implementation of shari&#x27;a focused on superficial issues, such as proper Islamic dress, while ignoring deep-seated moral and social problems, such as corruption.

=== Ahmadiyya ===

In 1980 the Indonesian Council of Ulamas (MUI) issued a &quot;fatwa&quot; (a legal opinion or decree issued by an Islamic religious leader) declaring that the Ahmadis are not a legitimate form of Islam. In the past, mosques and other facilities belonging to Ahmadis had been damaged by offended Muslims in Indonesia; more recently, rallies have been held demanding that the sect be banned and some religious clerics have demanded Ahmadis be killed.

=== Youth radicalization ===
Since the mid-2010s there has been a trend of radicalization among the youth, and a nationally representative survey done in 2019 by Alvara found out that around 60% of the generation Z (aged 14–21) and millennials (aged 22–29) identified as &quot;puritan &amp; ultraconservative&quot;. Observers link it to the influence of the Wahhabist Hijrah movement, something that the Indonesian government wants to curb as it feels it threatens the country&#x27;s secular values and unity.

<text>A voice browser is a software application that presents an interactive voice user interface to the user in a manner analogous to the functioning of a web browser interpreting Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Dialog documents interpreted by voice browser are often encoded in standards-based markup languages, such as Voice Dialog Extensible Markup Language (VoiceXML), a standard by the World Wide Web Consortium.

A voice browser presents information aurally, using pre-recorded audio file playback or text-to-speech synthesis software. A voice browser obtains information using speech recognition and keypad entry, such as DTMF detection. 

As speech recognition and web technologies have matured, voice applications are deployed commercially in many industries and voice browsers are supplanting traditional proprietary interactive voice response (IVR) systems. Voice browser software is delivered in a variety of implementations models.

Systems that present a voice browser to a user, typically provide interfaces to the public switched telephone network or to a private branch exchange.

<text>Sacramento City College (SCC) is a public community college in Sacramento, California. SCC is part of the Los Rios Community College District and had an enrollment of 25,307 in 2009. It is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges (ACCJC), offering Associate in Science (A.S) and Associate in Art (A.A.) degrees.

==History==

Founded in 1916 as a department of Sacramento High School, Sacramento City College is the seventh oldest public community college in California and the oldest institution of higher learning in Sacramento.

Rare for its time, Sacramento City College was founded by a woman (Belle Cooledge) and with an all female class as its first graduates, the college began with the spirit of inclusion at its very heart. First known as Sacramento Junior College, Cooledge founded the college to provide a safe, welcoming place for students to learn the basics for a college education, and to be a gathering spot for extra-curricular activities that would bring the community together.
In 1922, the citizens of Sacramento organized a junior college district, effectively granting Sacramento Junior College its administrative independence from Sacramento High School. This plan of organization remained in force until 1936, when the college became a part of the Sacramento City Unified School District.

Twenty-eight years later, as a result of a March 17, 1964, election, Sacramento City College separated from the Sacramento City Unified School District to join the newly organized Los Rios Junior College District, which took over the operation of American River College and Sacramento City College. Los Rios paid the total of $1.00 for the Sacramento City College Campus. In October 1967, the Sacramento Pop Festival was held at the main campus&#x27; Charles C. Hughes Stadium. In 1970, the newly renamed Los Rios Community College District opened a third campus, Cosumnes River College. Folsom Lake College has recently been added to the district.

The Sacramento City College yearbook was called the Pioneer when initially published in the 1920s. The format changed in the early 1970s, and it was discontinued by 1980. The school newspaper-originally named &quot;the Blotter&quot; in the 1920s—would be called &quot;The Pony Express&quot; for several decades. It is now called &quot;the Express.&quot;


==Student life==
There are over 50 student clubs and groups on campus, although there are no official fraternities or sororities. The campus does not offer any dorms.

==Athletics==
The Sacramento City College Panthers are members of the California Community College Athletic Association (CCCAA), and the Big 8 Conference. SCC fields 18 teams, including 10 women&#x27;s teams and 8 men&#x27;s teams. The baseball program has demonstrated the most consistent success with 37 league titles, 5 state titles, and 1 national title. On the women&#x27;s side, the track and field team won 3 straight state titles (2003, 2004, 2005), while the softball program won 4 state titles between 1988 and 2004. Sac City&#x27;s athletic alumni have competed in the Olympic Games, the World Series, the NFL playoffs, and a world championship boxing match. Several of its coaches (and former coaches) have coached or served in administrative positions on a national and international level, including the Olympic Games, the NFL, and Major League Baseball.

<text>In music theory, harmonic rhythm, also known as harmonic tempo, is the rate at which the chords change (or progress) in a musical composition, in relation to the rate of notes. Thus a passage in common time with a stream of sixteenth notes and chord changes every measure has a slow harmonic rhythm and a fast surface or &quot;musical&quot; rhythm (16 notes per chord change), while a piece with a trickle of half notes and chord changes twice a measure has a fast harmonic rhythm and a slow surface rhythm (1 note per chord change). Harmonic rhythm may be described as strong or weak.

According to William Russo harmonic rhythm is, &quot;the duration of each different chord...in a succession of chords.&quot; According to Joseph Swain (2002 p. 4) harmonic rhythm, &quot;is simply that perception of rhythm that depends on changes in aspects of harmony.&quot; According to Walter Piston (1944), &quot;the rhythmic life contributed to music by means of the underlying changes of harmony. The pattern of the harmonic rhythm of a given piece of music, derived by noting the root changes as they occur, reveals important and distinctive features affecting the style and texture.&quot;

Strong harmonic rhythm is characterized by strong root progressions and emphasis of root positions, weak contrapuntal bass motion, strong rhythmic placement in the measure (especially downbeat), and relatively longer duration.

&quot;The &#x27;fastness&#x27; or &#x27;slowness&#x27; of harmonic rhythm is not absolute, but relative,&quot; and thus analysts compare the overall pace of harmonic rhythm from one piece to another, or the amount of variation of harmonic rhythm within a piece. For example, a key stylistic difference between Baroque music and Classical-period music is that the latter exhibits much more variety of harmonic rhythm, even though the harmony itself is less complex.

For example, the first prelude (BWV 846) from J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, illustrates a steady harmonic rhythm of one chord change per measure, although the &quot;melodic&quot; rhythm is much faster.&lt;score lang=&quot;lilypond&quot; override_ogg=&quot;Beispiel 1a - Takte 1bis5 mit Wolfsquinte d-a.ogg&quot;&gt;

<text>Joe Gibbs born Joel Arthur Gibson (14 October 1942 – 22 February 2008) was a Jamaican reggae producer.

==Biography==
Born in Salt Spring, St. James in 1942, Joe Gibbs studied electronics in Cuba and went on to work as an electronic technician for Stone &amp; Webster in Montego Bay. He moved to Kingston where he set up an electrical repair shop in Beeston Street, with television repairs and sales as its main concern. It was in this shop that he first started to sell records. The fast growth of the local music scene encouraged him to get more involved in the music business, and in 1966 he started to record some artists in the back of his shop with a two-track tape machine, working with Lee Perry who had just ended his association with Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd. With the help of Bunny Lee, he launched his Amalgamated record label, and had his first success with one of the earliest rocksteady songs, Roy Shirley&#x27;s &quot;Hold Them&quot;, which topped the charts in Jamaica.

When Perry decided to leave to start his own record label, Upsetter, Gibbs enrolled the young Winston &quot;Niney&quot; Holness (later known as Niney The Observer) who helped Gibbs maintain his productions at the top of the charts. During the rocksteady period until 1970, he had hit records with numerous artists including The Pioneers, Errol Dunkley, and Ken Parker. He also worked with backing bands such as Lynn Taitt and the Jets (including the organist Ansel Collins, and horns players Tommy McCook, Johnny &quot;Dizzy&quot; Moore, Bobby Ellis and Vin Gordon), or The Hippy Boys (featuring the Barrett brothers as the rhythm section).

He concentrated exclusively on the production of the then new reggae sound after his first international success &quot;Love of the Common People&quot; by Nicky Thomas (#9 in the UK Singles Chart in summer 1970). Gibbs still recorded the rock-steady artists that he had initially worked with; artists like The Ethiopians, Delroy Wilson, and The Heptones. The two volumes of his singles compilations &quot;The Heptones and Friends&quot; were best-sellers in Jamaica. During this period, he launched three new labels —Jogib, Shock, and Pressure Beat.

In 1972, after having moved his studio in the Duhaney Park district, he set up a new one at Retirement Crescent in Kingston&#x27;s Cross Roads district and started to work with sound engineer Errol Thompson, who used to be at Randy&#x27;s Studio. Together they were known as &quot;The Mighty Two&quot;, and along with his studio band The Professionals (including bassist Robbie Shakespeare, drummer Sly Dunbar and guitarist Earl &quot;Chinna&quot; Smith), they produced hundreds of singles, including the hits &quot;Money in My Pocket&quot; by Dennis Brown, &quot;Ah So We Stay&quot; by Big Youth and &quot;Eviction&quot; by Black Uhuru. The duo worked on over 100 Jamaican number one hits.

In 1975, he set up his new 16-track studio and record pressing plant at Retirement Crescent and kept producing Jamaican artists under numerous label names (Crazy Joe, Reflections, Belmont, Town &amp; Country). He had success again with roots reggae, rockers, lovers rock and Dub music artists including: Dennis Brown, Jacob Miller, Sylford Walker, The Mighty Diamonds, Gregory Isaacs, Prince Alla and Junior Byles.

The 1977 Culture album &quot;Two Sevens Clash&quot; was a major influence on the then emerging punk scene and an internationally acclaimed production. The album was cited by punk rock band The Clash. Other successful artists produced by the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; during the end of the 1970s include: Marcia Aitken, Althea &amp; Donna, John Holt, Barrington Levy, Cornell Campbell, Dean Fraser, Delroy Wilson, Beres Hammond, Ranking Joe, Prince Jazzbo, Prince Mohammed, Dillinger, Trinity, Prince Far I, Clint Eastwood, I-Roy and Kojak &amp; Liza.

Apart from his extensive musical career, he also appeared as himself in the 1972 film The Harder They Come and the 1978 film Rockers.

In the 1980s, Gibbs had an international hit with J.C. Lodge&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Someone Loves You Honey&quot;. However, Joe Gibbs&#x27;s career suffered a severe blow following the release of this song. The success of Lodge&#x27;s version triggered a massive lawsuit for unpaid royalties and errors in songwriting credits, leading to the closure of his studio. This catastrophic event disrupted his productions, stalling his career. Although Gibbs attempted to revitalize his career in the &#x27;90s, the consequences of this incident seriously affected his trajectory in the industry.

Again in the 1990s–2000s he teamed up with Errol Thompson, and Sydney &quot;Luddy&quot; Crooks of The Pioneers, to produce some new music way into the new millennium. Before his death, Gibbs also went into business with Chris Chin of VP Records, which was one of his last business ventures.

He died of a heart attack on 22 February 2008, and was survived by his twelve children.
