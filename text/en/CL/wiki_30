<text>El Gran Silencio is a rock en español band from Monterrey, Mexico. It blends a variety of rock, reggae, dancehall, and hip-hop influences with traditional Latin American musical forms such as cumbia, vallenato and Norteño. Their lyrics tend to be bohemian and often talk about life in the “barrio” or poor neighborhoods of Mexican cities, especially Monterrey. As of 2015, they have recorded seven albums, eleven singles, six soundtracks, five tributes and seventeen collaborations and have toured Mexico and the United States.

==The music==
They are unique on the Mexican music scene with their music being called world beat, cumbia grupero and rap but, their musical style crosses various genres and can combine any number including hip-hop, reggae, norteño, cumbia, rock-and-roll, polka, huapango and vallenato. Much of what keeps it together are Latin folk rhythms and the use of accordion licks. The band has called their work“freestyle norteño popular;” however, founder Tony Hernandez strongly links the music to rock as he says that rock showed that mixing genres is possible and they maintain rock’s rebellious nature.

Their work, especially their early work, has received criticism, and some dismiss it as &quot;naco&quot; (low class), as they celebrate subcultures such as chúntaros, barrio youths wearing baggy pants and hip-hop musical tastes. As one of few major Mexican alternative bands with authentic barrio roots, Silencio works to get that culture more accepted by mainstream Mexican society. Life in the barrio is a very common theme in the music. Tony Hernandez often talks nostalgically about life in his hometown of Monterrey, grilling carne asada on the street and playing the Beatles or La Tropa Colombiana along with family and friends. However, their lyrics are more bohemian than materialistic.

Although rap was a major element in their early work, unlike Spanish language rap artists, they perform live with real instruments. They also collaborate with other musicians on projects, to add instruments such as congas, or event to extend the band into ten pieces, with the configuration of an Afro-Caribbean orchestra with brass and percussion sections. The album &quot;Chúntaros Radio Poder&quot; creates the day in an imaginary radio station, with a number of popular Monterrey DJs of the time taking turns presenting the songs.

==History==
El Gran Silencio emerge from the poor barrios of the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, founded by brothers Tony and Cano Hernandez in 1993. At first they called themselves &quot;La Zona del Silencio&quot;, and had only a cheap harmonica and guitar, sing pails and trash cans for the percussion, while saving money for real instruments. After finding a cassette of band of the same name, they changed it to El Gran Silencio, taken from a song by Rodrigo “Rockrigo” González, a singer/songwriter who died in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.

Their very first recording was on a local, independent label, but their first commercial release was &quot;Libres y Locos&quot; in 1998. It immediately caused waves in the Spanish language rock community, as it combined rap-style lyrics with a ranchera attitude. The single from this album, &quot;Dormir Soñando,&quot; had some airplay on MTV en Español but did not become a hit on radio until it was covered by Los Chicos del Barrio. Their second album, &quot;Chuntaros Radio Poder&quot;,(2001) expanded the musical mix, and the rap element faded. This album began with wide mix of styles from those reminiscent of the rock of Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, but with heavy Latin American rhythms from norteño to cumbia and vallenato. the album produced the alternative hit, &quot;Chúntaro Style&quot;.

The band at first recorded in Mexico, but have since done so in the United States. However, their only appearance on US charts is a guest appearance with Juan Gabriel on the Kumbia Kings single &quot;No Tengo Dinero&quot;.

As of 2015, they have recorded seven albums, eleven singles, six soundtracks, five tributes and seventeen collaborations, including an album with other artists as a tribute to Los Tigres del Norte.

Over it more than twenty year history, band members have changed, with the bass player changing twice. The first bass player was Julian Villareal and the next César Vulgar Hernandez. When Julian left, he sued the band. The current line up (2015) is Tony Hernández, Isaac Valdez, Ezequiel Alvarado and &quot;Wiwa&quot; Flores .

==Appearances==
Initially their ambition was to play a club in Monterrey, but since have toured both the United States and Mexico on multiple occasions, with appearances at music and cultural festivals such as the Festival Jóvenes que Muevan II in Guadalajara, Vive Latino 2015, Machaca Fest 2015 and twice at the, Festival Internacional Cervantino, Their second appearance here in 2014 was to represent their home state of Nuevo León.

<doc id="1163874" wikidata="Q318481" url="?curid=1163874" title="Apolinario Mabini">
<text>Apolinario Mabini y Maranán (; July 23, 1864 – May 13, 1903) was a Filipino revolutionary leader, educator, lawyer, and statesman who served first as a legal and constitutional adviser to the Revolutionary Government, and then as the first Prime Minister of the Philippines upon the establishment of the First Philippine Republic. He is regarded as the &quot;utak ng himagsikan&quot; or &quot;brain of the revolution&quot; and is also considered as a national hero in the Philippines. Mabini&#x27;s work and thoughts on the government shaped the Philippines&#x27; fight for independence over the next century.

Two of his works, &quot;El Verdadero Decálogo&quot; (&quot;The True Decalogue&quot;, June 24, 1898) and &quot;Programa Constitucional de la República Filipina&quot; (&quot;The Constitutional Program of the Philippine Republic&quot;, 1898), became instrumental in the drafting of what would eventually be known as the Malolos Constitution.

Mabini performed all his revolutionary and governmental activities despite having lost the use of both his legs to polio shortly before the Philippine Revolution of 1896.

Mabini&#x27;s role in Philippine history saw him confronting first Spanish colonial rule in the opening days of the Philippine Revolution, and then American colonial rule in the days of the Philippine–American War. The latter saw Mabini captured and exiled to Guam by American colonial authorities, allowed to return only two months before his eventual death in May 1903.

==Life==
===Early life and education===

Apolinario Mabini was born on July 23, 1864, in Barrio Talaga in Tanauan, Batangas. He was the second of eight children of Dionisia Maranan y Magpantay, a vendor in the Tanauan market, and Inocencio Leon Mabini y Lira, an illiterate peasant.

Apolinario Mabini attended the historical school of Father Valerio Malabanan located in Lipa. Being poor, Apolinario Mabini was able to get educated due to the Malabanan school&#x27;s matriculation of students based on their academic merit rather than ability of the parents to pay. He would meet future leader Miguel Malvar while studying in Lipa.

In 1881, Mabini received a scholarship from Colegio de San Juan de Letran in Manila. An anecdote about his stay there says that a professor there decided to pick on him because his shabby clothing clearly showed he was poor. Mabini amazed the professor by answering a series of very difficult questions with ease. His studies at Letran were periodically interrupted by a chronic lack of funds, and he earned money for his board and lodging by teaching children.

=== Law Studies ===
Mabini&#x27;s mother had wanted him to enter the priesthood, but his desire to defend the poor made him decide to study law instead. A year after receiving his Bachiller en Artes with highest honors and the title Professor of Latin from Letran, he moved on to University of Santo Tomas in 1888, where he received his law degree in 1894.

Comparing Mabini&#x27;s generation of Filipino intellectuals to the previous one of Jose Rizal and the other members of the propagandists movement, journalist and National Artist of the Philippines for Literature Nick Joaquin describes Mabini&#x27;s generation as the next iteration in the evolution of Filipino intellectual development:

:&quot;Europe had been a necessary catalyst for the generation of Rizal. By the time of Mabini, the Filipino intellectual had advanced beyond the need for enlightenment abroad[...] The very point of Mabini&#x27;s accomplishment is that all his schooling, all his training, was done right here in his own country. The argument of Rizal&#x27;s generation was that Filipinos were not yet ready for self-government because they had too little education and could not aspire for more in their own country. The evidence of Mabini&#x27;s generation was that it could handle the affairs of government with only the education it had acquired locally. It no longer needed Europe; it had imbibed all it needed of Europe.&quot;

Mabini joined the Guild of Lawyers after graduation, but he did not choose to practice law in a professional capacity. He did not set up his own law office, and instead continued to work in the office of a notary public.

Instead, Mabini put his knowledge of law to much use during the days of the Philippine Revolution and the Filipino-American war. Joaquin notes that all his contributions to Philippine history somehow involved the law:

:&quot;His was a legal mind. He was interested in law as an idea, as an ideal[...] whenever he appears in our history he is arguing a question of legality.&quot;

== Masonry and La Liga Filipina ==

Mabini joined the fraternity of Freemasonry in September 1892, affiliating with lodge Balagtas, and taking on the name &quot;Katabay&quot;.
The following year, Mabini became a member of La Liga Filipina, which was being resuscitated after the arrest of its founder José Rizal in 1892. Mabini was made secretary of its new Supreme Council. This was Mabini&#x27;s first time to join an explicitly patriotic organization.

Mabini, whose advocacies favored the reformist movement, pushed for the organization to continue its goals of supporting La Solidaridad and the reforms it advocated.

When more revolutionary members of the Liga indicated that they did not think the reform movement was getting results and wanted to more openly support revolution, La Liga Filipina split into two factions: the moderate Cuerpo de Compromisarios, which wanted simply to continue to support the revolution, and the explicitly revolutionary Katipunan. Mabini joined the Cuerpo de Compromisarios.

When José Rizal, part of the &quot;La Liga Filipina&quot;, was executed in December that year, however, he changed his mind and gave the revolution his wholehearted support.

=== Polio and eventual paralysis ===
Mabini was struck by polio in 1895, and the disease gradually incapacitated him until January 1896, when he finally lost the use of both his legs.

=== 1896 Revolution and Arrest ===
When the plans of the Katipunan were discovered by Spanish authorities, and the first active phase of the 1896 Philippine Revolution began in earnest, Mabini, still ill, was arrested along with numerous other members of La Liga Filipina.

Thirteen patriots, later known as the &quot;Thirteen Martyrs of Cavite&quot;, were arrested in Cavite, tried and eventually executed. José Rizal himself was accused of being party to the revolution, and would eventually be executed in December that year. When the Spanish authorities saw that Mabini was paralyzed, however, they decided to release him.

=== Adviser to the Revolutionary Government ===
Sent to the hospital after his arrest, Mabini remained in ill health for a considerable time. He was seeking the curative properties of the hot springs in Los Baños, Laguna in 1898 when Emilio Aguinaldo sent for him, asking him to serve as advisor to the revolution.

During this convalescent period, Mabini wrote the pamphlets &quot;El Verdadero Decálogo&quot; and &quot;Ordenanzas de la Revolución&quot;. Aguinaldo was impressed by these works and by Mabini&#x27;s role as a leading figure in La Liga Filipina, and made arrangements for Mabini to be brought from Los Baños to Kawit, Cavite. It took hundreds of men taking turns carrying his hammock to portage Mabini to Kawit.

He continued to serve as the chief adviser for General Aguinaldo after the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12. He drafted decrees and edited the constitution for the First Philippine Republic, including the framework of the revolutionary government which was implemented in Malolos in 1899.

===Prime Minister of the Philippines===
Shortly after Aguinaldo&#x27;s return to the Philippines from exile in Hong Kong in May 1898, he tasked Mabini with helping him establish a government. Mabini authored the June 18, 1898, decree which established the Dictatorial Government of the Philippines. After the Malolos Constitution, the basic law of the First Philippine Republic, was promulgated on January 21, 1899, Mabini was appointed Prime Minister and also Foreign Minister. He then led the first cabinet of the republic.

Mabini found himself in the center of the most critical period in the new country&#x27;s history, grappling with problems until then unimagined. Most notable of these were his negotiations with Americans, which began on March 6, 1899. The United States and the Philippine Republic were embroiled in extremely contentious and eventually violent confrontations. During the negotiations for peace, Americans proffered Mabini autonomy for Aguinaldo&#x27;s new government, but the talks failed because Mabini&#x27;s conditions included a ceasefire, which was rejected. Mabini negotiated once again, seeking for an armistice instead, but the talks failed yet again. Eventually, feeling that the Americans were not negotiating &#x27;bona fide,&#x27; he forswore the Americans and supported war. He resigned from government on May 7, 1899.

===Philippine American War, exile, and return===
The Philippine–American War saw Mabini taken more seriously as a threat by the Americans than he was under the Spanish:
Says National Artist for Literature F. Sionil Jose:
:&quot;&quot;The Spaniards underestimated Mabini primarily because he was a cripple. Had they known of his intellectual perspicacity, they would have killed him earlier. The Americans did not. They were aware of his superior intelligence, his tenacity when he faced them in negotiations for autonomy and ceasefire.
On December 10, 1899, he was captured by Americans at Cuyapo, Nueva Ecija. He was captured by troopers of the 4th Cavalry Regiment. He was imprisoned after his capture, though he was in bad health, and was exiled to the island of Guam for refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the United States along with other revolutionists Americans referred to as &quot;insurrectos&quot; (rebels) or &quot;Irreconcilables&quot;.

Mabini returned to the Philippines after agreeing to take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States on February 26, 1903, before the Collector of Customs. On the day he sailed, he issued this statement to the press:
Mabini resumed his work of agitating for independence for the Philippines soon after his return from exile.

== Death ==
Not long after his return, Mabini died of cholera at home along Calle Nagtahan, Manila on May 13, 1903, at the age of 38, after consuming an unpasteurized and contaminated carabao milk. His funeral at the Binondo Church was attended by around 8,000 people, mostly Filipinos, including the foremost members of the &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot; who took over and occupied the Binondo Church at the time. 

His remains were initially interred at the Manila Chinese Cemetery, marked by a triangular pyramid (symbolizing his Masonic beliefs) on a raised pedestal. Subsequently, they were transferred to the &quot;Mausoleo de los Veteranos de la Revolucion&quot; in the nearby Manila North Cemetery before finally being relocated to the newly-inaugurated Apolinario Mabini Shrine in Tanauan, Batangas, on his 92nd birth anniversary on July 23, 1956.

== Historical Remembrance ==
Mabini&#x27;s complex contributions to Philippine History are often distilled into two historical monikers - &quot;&quot;Brains of the Revolution,&quot; and &quot;Sublime Paralytic&quot;&quot;. Contemporary historians such as Ambeth Ocampo point out, though, that these two monikers are reductionist and simplistic, and &quot;do not do justice to the hero&#x27;s life and legacy.&quot;

=== &quot;Brains of the Revolution&quot; ===
Because of his role as advisor during the formation of the revolutionary government, and his contributions as statesman thereafter, Mabini is often referred to as the &quot;Brains of the Revolution&quot;, a historical moniker he sometimes shares with Emilio Jacinto, who served in a similar capacity for the earlier revolutionary movement, the Katipunan.

=== &quot;Sublime Paralytic&quot; ===
Mabini is also famous for having achieved all this despite having lost the use of his legs to polio just prior to the Philippine revolution. This has made Mabini one of the Philippines&#x27; most visually iconic national heroes, such that he is often referred to as &quot;The Sublime Paralytic&quot; (Tagalog: &quot;Dakilang Lumpo&quot;).

==Controversy about Mabini&#x27;s paralysis==
Even during his lifetime, there were controversial rumors regarding the cause of Mabini&#x27;s paralysis. Infighting among members of the Malolos congress led to the spread of rumors that Mabini&#x27;s paralysis had been caused by venereal disease - specifically, syphilis. This was finally debunked in 1980, when Mabini&#x27;s bones were exhumed and the autopsy proved conclusively that the cause of his paralysis was polio.

This information reached National Artist F. Sionil José too late, however. By the time the historian Ambeth Ocampo told him about the autopsy results, he had already published Po-on, the first novel of his Rosales Saga. That novel contained plot points based on the premise that Mabini had indeed become a paralytic due to syphilis.

In later editions of the book, the novelist corrected the error and issued an apology, which reads in part:
In the later editions, Mabini&#x27;s disease - an important plot point - was changed to an undefined liver ailment. The ailing Mabini takes pride in the fact that his symptoms are definitely not those of syphilis, despite the rumors spread by his detractors in the Philippine Revolutionary government.

==Tributes==
=== Shrines ===

* Two sites related to Mabini have been chosen to host shrines in his honor:
** The house where Mabini died is now located in the campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Santa Mesa, Manila, having been moved twice.

The simple nipa retains the original furniture, and some of the books he wrote, and also contains souvenir items, while hosting the municipal library and reading facilities.
** Mabini was buried in his town of birth - what is now Barangay Talaga, Tanauan City, Batangas. An interactive museum containing historical artifacts, his personal belongings, books he authored, and historical information about him, the Philippines during his era, and his town&#x27;s historical background was inaugurated on this site in 1956. Recently renovated and improved, it continues to serve as a tribute to his legacy. It also sells books about him and souvenir items. A replica of the house Mabini was born in was also constructed on the site.
* Two monuments to Mabini and the 41 other &quot;insurrectos&quot; imprisoned in Agat, Guam are located at the site of their prison camp, now part of the War in the Pacific National Historical Park.

**Epy Quizon in the film, &quot;Heneral Luna&quot; (2015), and its sequel, &quot;&quot; (2018).
***At the height of the film &quot;Heneral Luna&quot; popularity, reports of numerous incidents - including one during a Q&amp;A with actor Epi Quizon - in which school-age youths asked why Mabini just sat in a chair throughout the film, implying a lack of familiarity with the famously paralytic statesman. Even President Benigno Aquino III remarked on the implications of the lack of awareness among students, saying &quot;even if only a few students said this, we can say that this is a reflection of how little some of the youth know about history. Later, I will call up (Education Secretary) Armin (Luistro) to act on this.&quot;
* F. Sionil Jose&#x27;s &quot;Po-on&quot; (in English: &quot;Dusk&quot;) has Mabini visit Rosales, Pangasinan during the Philippine Revolution.

<doc id="1163886" wikidata="Q1879021" url="?curid=1163886" title="Lyttelton Range">
<text>The Lyttelton Range () is a narrow northwest-trending mountain range located south of Dunedin Range in the Admiralty Mountains of Antarctica. The range is long and forms the western wall of the upper part of the Dennistoun Glacier.
==Exploration and naming==
The Lyttelton Range was mapped by United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
It was named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after the port of Lyttelton, New Zealand, where over the years, many expedition ships refueled and replenished supplies en route to Antarctica; also in recognition of the friendship and cooperation of its citizens with American participation in the U.S. Antarctic Research Program.

==Location==
Lyttelton Range lies between Findlay Range, which extends southeast from Robinson Heights, to the west, and the Dunedin Range to the east.
The upper Dennistoun Glacier flows past its east side.
The Atkinson Glacier flows between Findlay Range and the west side of Lyttelton Range, flowing northward into Dennistoun Glacier.

==Features==
Features include Wetmore Peak and Lange Peak.
===Wetmore Peak===
A peak high in the north part of Lyttelton Range, east-northeast of Mount Bierle.
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Cliff Wetmore, United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP) biologist at Hallett Station, 1963-64.

===Lange Peak===
Peak high in the west-central part of Lyttelton Range. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for USARP biologist Otto L. Lange of Hallett Station, 1966-67.

===Saxby Pass===
A snow-covered pass through Lyttelton Range south of Lange Peak. 
The pass was used by a New Zealand Antarctic Research Programme (NZARP) field party led by R.H. Findlay, 1981-82, in travel between Atkinson Glacier and Dennistoun Glacier. 
Named by New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) after Eric Saxby.

<doc id="1163892" wikidata="Q1916284" url="?curid=1163892" title="Medicine Bow Mountains">
<text>The Medicine Bow Mountains are a mountain range in the Rocky Mountains that extend from northern Colorado into southern Wyoming. The northern extent of this range is the sub-range the Snowy Range. From the northern end of Colorado&#x27;s Never Summer Mountains, the Medicine Bow mountains extend north from Cameron Pass along the border between Larimer and Jackson counties in Colorado and northward into south central Wyoming. In Wyoming, the range sits west of Laramie, in Albany and Carbon counties to the route of the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Interstate 80. The mountains often serve as a symbol for the city of Laramie. The range is home to Snowy Range Ski Area.

The highest peak in the range is Clark Peak (), located in the Rawah Wilderness along the southern end of the range in Northern Colorado. Much of the range is located within the Medicine Bow National Forest in Wyoming. The highest peak on the Wyoming side is Medicine Bow Peak (). The range is drained along the western flank by the Michigan and Canadian rivers, tributaries of the North Platte in North Park. On its eastern flank it is drained by the Laramie River, another tributary of the North Platte.

==Geology==

The Medicine Bow Mountains resulted from continental compression during the Laramide Orogeny. Beginning about 70 million years ago, the Rockies began uplifting along thrust faults that broke up the Precambrian granite of Earth&#x27;s crust. By 50 million years ago, all of Wyoming&#x27;s major mountain ranges were elevated and the major basins defined. Rocks exposed along the flanks and peaks of the Medicine Bow Mountains span the Precambrian to modern, with the peaks composed of 2.4-2.0 billion year old Medicine Peak Quartzite. This rock was once a shallow marine sand deposit that has since been compressed and heated during burial, forming the metamorphic rock, quartzite. What may be traces of multicellular animals are preserved in this rock, making it of particular interest to paleontologists.

The Cheyenne belt, the 1.78–1.74 billion year old suture between the Wyoming craton and the Yavapai province that formed as North America was assembled, is exposed in the Medicine Bow Mountains.

==Fauna==
Wildlife abounds in these mountains, with mule deer, elk, moose, black bear, mountain lions, coyotes, marmots, pika, Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels, bobcats, and lynx as well as a tremendous variety of birds. Brook and rainbow trout as well as grayling and golden trout are found in the streams. A disjunct population of arctic fairy shrimp (Brachinecta paludosa) has been documented in a few lakes in the northern part of the range.

==Research==

Since 1987, the Glacier Lakes area of the Snowy Range has been home to the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Site (GLEES), a field unit of the Rocky Mountain Research Station, United States Forest Service. Areas of scientific inquiry at the site include atmospheric pollutant deposition, forest carbon and water vapor cycling, effect of insect outbreaks, and alpine lake and stream hydrology. The site is in extent and hosts facilities for the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), the National Dry Deposition Network (NDDN), and AmeriFlux (Eddy covariance).

==Airline crash==

This mountain range is also home to some of the remains of a Douglas DC-4 aircraft, operated as United Airlines Flight 409. The aircraft crashed into Medicine Bow Peak on October 6, 1955, killing all 66 people on board.

<doc id="1163894" wikidata="Q1063188" url="?curid=1163894" title="Mollisol">
<text>Mollisol is a soil type which has deep, high organic matter, nutrient-enriched surface soil (A horizon), typically between 60 and 80 cm (24-31 in) in depth. This fertile surface horizon, called a mollic epipedon, is the defining diagnostic feature of Mollisols. Mollic epipedons are created by long-term addition of organic materials derived from plant roots and typically have soft, granular soil structure.

Mollisols typically occur in savannahs and mountain valleys (such as Central Asia, and the North American Great Plains). These environments have historically been strongly influenced by fire and abundant pedoturbation from organisms such as ants and earthworms. It was estimated that in 2003, only 14 to 26 percent of grassland ecosystems remained in a relatively natural state (that is, they were not used for agriculture due to the fertility of the horizon). Globally, they represent ~7% of ice-free land area. As the world&#x27;s agriculturally most productive soil order, the Mollisols represent one of the most economically important soil orders. 
Though most other soil orders known today were formed at the beginning of the Carboniferous Ice Age 280 million years ago, Mollisols are best known from the paleopedological record as early as the &quot;Eocene&quot;. Their development is very closely associated with cooling and drying of the global climate that occurred during the Oligocene, Miocene and Pliocene.

== Suborders ==
:Albolls—wet soils; aquic soil moisture regime with an eluvial horizon
:Aquolls—wet soils; aquic soil moisture regime
:Cryolls—cold climate; frigid or cryic soil temperature regime
:Gelolls—very cold climate; mean annual soil temperature &lt; 0 °C
:Rendolls—lime parent material
:Udolls—humid climate; udic moisture regime
:Ustolls—subhumid climate; ustic moisture regime
:Xerolls—Mediterranean climate; xeric moisture regime

Soils which are mostly similar to Mollisols but contain either continuous or discontinuous permafrost, consequently affected by cryoturbation are common in high mountain plateaus of Tibet and the Andean altiplano. Such soils are called Molliturbels or Mollorthels and provide the best grazing land in such cold climates because they are not acidic like many other soils of very cold climates.

Other soils which have a mollic epipedon are classified as Vertisols because high shrink swell characteristics and relatively high clay contents dominate over the mollic epipedon. These soils are especially common in parts of South America in the Paraná River basin receiving abundant but erratic rainfall and extensive deposition of clay-rich minerals from the Andes. Mollic epipedons also occur in some Andisols but the andic properties take precedence.

In the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), Mollisols are split up into Chernozems, Kastanozems and Phaeozems. Shallow or gravelly Mollisols may belong to the Leptosols. Many Aquolls are Gleysols, Stagnosols or Planosols. Mollisols with a natric horizon belong to the Solonetz.

<text>The Dunedin Range () is a northwest-trending mountain range, long and wide.
It is located east of Lyttelton Range in the Admiralty Mountains of Victoria Land, Antarctica.
==Name==
The Dunedin Range was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960–63.
It was named by United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for the city of Dunedin, New Zealand which over the years has had a close association with Antarctic expeditions; also in recognition of the friendship and cooperation of its citizens with American participation in the U.S. Antarctic Research Program.

==Location==
The Dunedin Range is in the north of the Admiralty Mountains.
It extended in the northwest-southeast direction from the Dennystoun Glacier, which flows along the west side, then turns past the northern tip of the range and runs east to the Southern Ocean.
The Rowles Glacier flows northwest along the east side of Dunedin Range to enter Dennistoun Glacier.
The Lyttelton Range is to the west of the Dennystoun Glacier.
The Nash Glacier and Wallis Glacier form to the east of the Dunedin Range.
Features include Jennings Peak and Brewer Peak to the southeast of the south end of the range, at the head of Pitkevitch Glacier.

===Jennings Peak===
A peak high in the southeast part of Dunedin Range. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Cedell Jennings, AE2, United States Navy, Aviation Electrician&#x27;s Mate at McMurdo Station, 1968.

<text>The Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award was a Canadian literary award given to Canadian plays produced by any professional Canadian theatre company, and having performances in the Toronto area.

The prize had a monetary value of $25,000, and was named for benefactor Floyd Chalmers, an editor and publisher.

From the award&#x27;s inception until 1980, one play was named the winner of the award, except for a tie in 1977. In 1980, the award began honouring multiple plays. That year, five winners were named. Since then, four plays normally won the award each year. In 1983, a youth theatre prize was added alongside the general theatre category.

The award was one of several arts awards created by the Chalmers family of Toronto. In 2001 the award was presented for the final time, and in 2002 the Chalmers family endowed an Ontario Arts Council fund for two arts grant programs.

<doc id="1163923" wikidata="Q4388297" url="?curid=1163923" title="Passenger train toilet">
<text>Many passenger trains (usually medium and long-distance) have toilet facilities, often at the ends of carriages. Toilets suitable for wheelchair users are larger, and hence trains with such facilities may not have toilets in each carriage. 

==Hopper toilet==
The traditional method of disposing human waste from trains is to deposit the waste onto the tracks or, more often, onto nearby ground, using what is known as a hopper toilet. This ranges from a hole in the floor to a full-flush system (possibly with sterilization). The hole in the floor (also known as a drop chute toilet or direct flush toilet) system is still in use in many parts of the world, particularly on older rolling stock. The principal disadvantage is that it can be considered crude or unhygienic and dangerous to health and the environment – it litters the railway lines and can convey serious health risks when the train passes over or under a waterway. Passengers may be discouraged from flushing or using toilets while the train is at a station or standing at a red signal. To enforce this limitation, toilets may be automatically locked when the train pulls into a station or stops at a red signal. In the United States, railway employees were required to lock the toilets closed whenever a passenger train stood in a station or at any other location designated by instructions in the timetable. Toilets would promptly be unlocked upon departure.

Properly designed drop chute toilets will draw air like a chimney, pulling air through the lavatory door vents and down and out through the toilet, reducing odor. Hopper toilets are similar to old-fashioned sea toilets in that they release the excreta directly to the environment, untreated.

In the United States, Amtrak phased out its use of these toilets in the 1980s after waste from a Silver Meteor train crossing the St. Johns River in Florida, between Palatka and DeLand, landed on a fisherman who filed a lawsuit.

In the UK, at the end of 2019, hopper toilets on timetabled passenger services remained in use. A plan to protect all rail workers and reduce public health risks was delayed with several operators applying for waivers.

In 2021, Indian Railways completed the phaseout of drop chute toilets, replacing them with indigenously developed bio-toilets. Apart from improving hygiene, the phaseout will save Indian Railways 4 billion rupees annually, due to the elimination of corrosion on the rails caused by human waste. They were replaced with bio-vacuum toilets, which use bacteria to decompose human waste, fulfilling a phaseout pledge made in 2010.

While a lot of U.K. Rail companies phase out drop chute toilets, On private preserved railway companies like the Swanage Railway There still use a drop shoot toilets through a Mark 1 passenger carriage. On the occasion that services operate through to Wareham on the South West Main Line, passengers are requested not to use the lavatories when on Network Rail tracks.

==Chemical holding tank==
Chemical holding tanks (retention tanks) are usually included on newer carriages and railcars in wealthier and more densely populated parts of the world. One issue is that the tanks need to be regularly emptied, often at a terminal station or prolonged stop-over. If a train needs to be used again quickly, the tanks may not get emptied. In this case, toilets may back up, which can result in toilets being closed.

==Vacuum toilet==

Vacuum systems used in the newest carriages are similar to those in airliners: waste is pulled into a holding tank with a high pressure pump. Their disadvantages are the same as of chemical holding tanks, in addition they require stable power supply for working, and flushing of anything else but water and human waste (e.g. paper towels) can easily break the pump.

==Composting toilet==
Some trains may have composting toilet tanks, which use bacterial action to break down solid and liquid waste. Only the broken down clean liquid is released to the trackbed after sterilisation. The solid waste only has to be emptied every half year. This type of toilet is in use in some trains in the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States.

==Cultural references==
In the United States, Dvořák&#x27;s tune &quot;Humoresque Number 7&quot; became the setting for a series of mildly scatological humorous verses, regarding passenger train toilets, beginning:

In &quot;The Good Soldier Svejk&quot;, author Jaroslav Hašek used hypocatastasis to indicate the fruit of hopper toilets, while conveying soldiers&#x27; envy and contempt for their general officer:

A popular Russian internet running joke and one of the most popular Yandex search requests is &quot;what would happen if you dropped a crowbar into a train toilet at full speed?&quot;

<text>Too Much Coffee Man (TMCM) is an American satirical superhero created by cartoonist Shannon Wheeler. Too Much Coffee Man wears what appears to be a spandex version of old-fashioned red &quot;long johns&quot; with a large mug attached atop his head. He is an anxious Everyman who broods about the state of the world, from politics to people, exchanging thoughts with friends and readers.

The strip is most often presented as a single page in alternative press newspapers, though occasionally the story arc stretches into multi-page stories. TMCM has appeared in comic strips, minicomics, webcomics, comic books, magazines, books, and operas. The &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; comic book won the 1995 Eisner Award for Best New Series.

==Publication history==
=== Creation ===
Too Much Coffee Man first appeared in 1991, in the &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Minicomic&quot;, as a self-promotion for Wheeler&#x27;s book &quot;Children with Glue&quot; (Blackbird Comics, 1991). The minicomics, which appeared in many different formats, even one issued as a one-inch square, were self-published, photocopied, and handmade by Wheeler in initial runs of 300 black-and-white copies.

Wheeler said he created Too Much Coffee Man to make more accessible themes he had begun in a college newspaper. He said in 2011:
=== Newspaper strip ===
Too Much Coffee Man started as a one-page ongoing strip running in &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; in 1991. Over time, it became syndicated to a number of alternative weeklies throughout the U.S.

With the January 23, 2006, installment, the &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; strip was retitled &quot;How to Be Happy, with Too Much Coffee Man&quot;. On February 6, 2006, the title was simplified to &quot;How to Be Happy&quot;, and Too Much Coffee Man did not appear in the strip again until January 21, 2008.

=== Comics ===
==== Solo title ====
Wheeler published four issues of the &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; minicomic in 1991–1992.

Wheeler self-published the &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; comic book via Adhesive Comics between 1993 and 2005. The first five issues were dated from July 1993 to February 1996. These were followed by three annual issues of &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&#x27;s Color Special&quot; from 1996 to 1998. In July 1998, Adhesive released &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; No. 8, thus skipping issues No. 6 and 7. After issue No. 10 (Dec. 2000), the comic became &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Magazine&quot;, featuring stories, articles, and reviews alongside TMCM material.

==== Appearances in other titles ====
Too Much Coffee Man strips appeared in the Austin, Texas-based anthology, &quot;Jab&quot; issues #1–4 and No. 6, published by Wheeler&#x27;s own imprint Adhesive Comics from 1992 to 1995.

In 1994 TMCM appeared in the independent anthology &quot;Hands Off!&quot;, published by Washington Citizens for Fairness.

From 1994 to 1996, &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; stories ran in the Dark Horse Comics anthology series &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;, in issues #92–95, and #100–111. Dark Horse collected all the TMCM stories from &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; in the 1997 special &quot;Too Much Coffee Man &quot;Saves the Universe&quot;&quot;.

1997 was a banner year for Too Much Coffee Man, with stories in the &quot;SPX: Small Press Expo&quot; anthology, Caliber Press&#x27;s &quot;Negative Burn&quot; No. 50, the Head Press anthology &quot;No Justice, No Piece!&quot;, and the trade paperback &quot;Wake Up and Smell the Cartoons of Shannon Wheeler&quot;, published by Mojo Press.

In 1998, TMCM stories were printed in &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot; No. 2 and &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; vol. 3, No. 41.

From 1999 to 2002, &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot; stories ran in the Dark Horse Comics anthology series &quot;Dark Horse Extra&quot;, in issues No. 8, 10–13, 41–43, and 48.

In 2011, TMCM appeared in the &quot;Madman 20th Anniversary Monster!&quot;, published by Image Comics, and &quot;War of the Independents&quot; No. 1, published by Red Anvil.

In 2013, TMCM was featured in a three-issue how-to guide on submitting comics to the digital comics platform ComiXology. In 2014, TMCM stories appeared in &quot;BANG! The Entertainment Paper&quot; #7–8.

=== Online ===
With the earnings from a Converse shoe commercial, Wheeler purchased a computer, launched his website tmcm.com on December 7, 1995, and began posting his comics online. He continues to post new and newly colored Too Much Coffee Man cartoons on his website every week .

== Plot and characters ==
Through multi-layered narratives, the comic explores issues of politics and the toils of urban society, often through the lens of the comics scene and coffee shop culture. In addition to the titular character, the creator of the strip often appears as a character, as does a &quot;reader&quot; character.

Too Much Coffee Man — Although he spends most time in his apartment or at the local coffee shop debating with his often pessimistic cohorts, Too Much Coffee Man is capable of going into a &quot;manic paranoid frenzy&quot; in combat, allowing him to pulverize opponents. He gains his amazing powers from coffee and cigarettes – he distills his extra potent espresso mix in a secret laboratory above the coffee shop. TMCM rarely sleeps and his nerves are shot from an excess of caffeine. He has also been in outer space and in a U.S. prison. Visually, the character is a parody of superheroes, which since their inception have been colloquially referred to by industry professionals as &quot;long-underwear characters&quot;. Too Much Coffee Man wears literal long underwear, dressing in what appears to be a spandex version of old-fashioned red &quot;long johns&quot; (full-body underwear with a buttoned flap on the back for bodily functions) with a large mug attached atop his head; it remains unclear whether he is wearing it or whether it is physically part of him.

Too Much Espresso Guy — Too Much Coffee Man&#x27;s cynical friend. The espresso cup atop his head is strapped on in an obvious way. He is addicted to alcohol, is vaguely narcissistic, often swaps between left and right-wing views, and is perpetually annoyed by Too Much Coffee Man and Too Much German White Chocolate Woman With Almonds, who he believes to be stupid.

Too Much German White Chocolate Woman With Almonds — their mutual friend. She is pale-skinned, worries a lot, and has large almonds on her face. She is skilled at making cakes, and also possesses the ability to detach her almonds, which are allegedly edible. She is nicer than Espresso Guy, causing them to often be antagonists.

Underwater Guy — another mutual friend, who wears a wetsuit with a diving snorkel and mask. He first appeared in the early comics and was almost entirely unspeaking. He was later retconned into being their new friend in later comics. He presumably has the power to breathe underwater indefinitely.

Mystery Woman — Too Much Coffee Man&#x27;s secret love.

Trademark Copyright Man — Too Much Coffee Man&#x27;s archenemy. They first fought when Too Much Coffee Man was sued by Trademark Copyright Man due to their initials both being TMCM and they both have a coffee cup strapped to their head, but Too Much Coffee Man presumably killed him after he ate his lawyer.

===Television===
In 1994, Converse shoe company licensed the rights to use Too Much Coffee Man for a 15-second commercial spot, first airing during a &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; episode. 
Marvel Comics and the cable television network Comedy Central were developing a potential animated series or special with the production company Nelvana in 2000 and 2001. However, the project was abandoned after both Wheeler and Comedy Central agreed that the script lacked quality.

===Music===
In 2000, jazz musician Bob Dorough recorded a CD entitled &quot;Too Much Coffee Man&quot;. The character appears on the cover, drawn by Shannon Wheeler, and there is a title track (originally intended to be music for an animated series based on the character) as well as a cover of the Richard Miles composition &quot;The Coffee Song&quot;.

===Opera===
The &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Opera&quot; appeared on stage for the first time in 2006. Wheeler, fellow cartoonist Damian Willcox, and composer Daniel Steven Crafts adapted the strip into an opera. &quot;Too Much Coffee Man Opera&quot; debuted at Brunish Hall at the Center for Performing Arts in Portland, Oregon, on September 22, 2006. A sample performance, which preceded the debut, was given at the Opera America convention in Seattle, Washington. Wheeler later teamed with Portland-based comic Carolyn Main to write a second act. This new, extended version, dubbed &quot;Too Much Coffee Man: The Refill&quot;, debuted again at Brunish Hall in April 2008.

=== Video Games ===
Too Much Coffee Man was included as a bonus multiplayer model in Half-Life: Further Data, released in early 1999. He was added to the base game in celebration of the game&#x27;s 25 year anniversary.

<doc id="1163938" wikidata="Q184991" url="?curid=1163938" title="Emblem of Israel">
<text>The emblem of Israel () depicts a temple menorah surrounded by an olive branch on each side, with the word &quot;Israel&quot; written in Hebrew () below it. While it is commonly displayed in blue and white, the emblem has appeared in alternative colour combinations depending on the use, such as on the Israeli Presidential Standard (see below).

==History==
The State of Israel adopted the symbol after a design competition held in 1948. The design is based on the winning entry submitted by Gabriel and Maxim Shamir&#x27;s proposal, with elements taken from other submissions, including entries from Oteh Walisch, W. Struski, Itamar David, Yerachmiel Schechter, and Willie Wind, whose entry won the first design competition. The emblem was officially adopted on February 10, 1949.

==Symbolism==
The image used on the emblem is based on a depiction of the menorah on the Arch of Titus. The menorah was used in the ancient Temple in Jerusalem and has been a symbol of Judaism since ancient times. It symbolizes universal enlightenment, based on what is written in Isaiah 60: &quot;Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn&quot;.

The emblem may also be based on the vision of the biblical prophet Zechariah, chapter 4, where he describes seeing a menorah flanked by two olive trees, one on each side.

==Location==
The Deep Freeze Range extends from southeast to northwest, between Priestley Glacier and Campbell Glacier. 
The narrow northwest end of the range ends in Szanto Spur, and includes Wasson Rock.
The Reeves Névé lies to the west.
The range extends north to Archambault Ridge, south of Rainey Glacier.
To the south of this along the west of Campbell Glacier are Mount Pollock, Recoil Glacier, Mount Gibbs, Harper Glacier, Mount Mankinen, Mount Adamson and Rebuff Glacier.

A sharply winding canyon, it was formed by the Ohinemuri River. State Highway 2 passes through this gorge between the towns of Paeroa, Waikino and Waihi. This road is the main link between the Waikato region and the Bay of Plenty.

The East Coast Main Trunk Railway used to run through the gorge until it was bypassed by the Kaimai Deviation - and the Karangahake Gorge section is now a combined walkway and cycleway, part of the Hauraki Rail Trail.

There are also several walks and tracks starting at the Karangahake Reserve car park and picnic area; ranging from 30 minutes to over 2 hours.

== Mining ==

The area has a strong connection to mining, and even in the 2010s, a number of companies have been prospecting and mining the area, though with much less visible and invasive methods than were used historically.

The Talisman, Crown and Woodstock stamping battery remains at the lower end of the gorge and are some of the most significant reminders of the time. Their location at the confluence of the Waitawheta River and the Ohinemuri River was chosen to make use of the available water power of the rivers. Mining at the batteries occurred roughly from the 1880s to 1950s, with the most productive years around the turn of the century, when the area produced 60 percent of the total gold from New Zealand. The batteries used to crush the ore from the extensive tunnels mined through the steep local mountainsides of the Waitawheta Gorge, with the Victoria Battery, one of the largest and most advanced at the time.

==Walks==
At Karangahake, several walks and tracks ranging from 30 minutes to over 2 hours start at the Karangahake Reserve car park and picnic area. One of the most spectacular walks in the area is the &quot;Windows Walk&quot;, a loop walk that leads through the old gold mining tunnels of the Talisman Mine, crosses the Waitawheta River over a suspension bridge, and joins the Crown Tramway Track back along the cliffs of the Waitawheta Gorge. The path follows the route of a bush tramway and passes by &quot;windows&quot; in the cliff face at the end of mining tunnels, which were used to tip tailings down into the Waitawheta Gorge. Two of the mining tunnels, which are about tall and wide, are safe to enter. They end abruptly after about and are home to glowworms and cave weta.

The Woodstock Underground Pumphouse in the Waitawheta Gorge is also still accessible via a short detour from the Crown Tramway Track.

The East Coast Main Trunk Railway used to run through the gorge until it was bypassed by the Kaimai Deviation. The Karangahake Gorge section of the line, including a 1100-metre tunnel, is now a combined walkway and cycleway, part of the Hauraki Rail Trail, and together with the natural sights of the gorge, makes it into a well-visited local tourist attraction. The railhead at the Waikino end of the gorge still exists, preserved as part of the Goldfields Railway to Waihi.

<text>USS &quot;Camden&quot; (AOE-2) was a , the second ship of the United States Navy named after the city of Camden, New Jersey. It combined the functions of three logistic support ships in one hull - fleet oiler (AO), ammunition ship (AE), and refrigerated stores ship (AF).

==History==

&quot;Camden&quot; was keeled on 17 February 1964, launched on 29 May 1965, and commissioned on 1 April 1967 as the second of four vessels in its class. It was the 542nd and final contract in the 68-year history of New York Shipbuilding, and the last vessel completed and launched at the shipyard. It was assigned to the Pacific Fleet in September 1967 and was initially homeported in Long Beach, California. On 26 November 1968 &quot;Camden&quot; suffered minor damages from a collision with the aircraft carrier . For their accomplishments during her first deployment to WestPac in 1968–1969, her crew was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation.

In August 1974, &quot;Camden&quot; moved to its new homeport at Naval Base Kitsap in Bremerton, Washington. The ship operated extensively up and down the West Coast of the United States and deployed frequently to the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans to support units of the Seventh Fleet. In 1980, &quot;Camden&quot; moved again to Bremerton for an .

On 20 July 1983 &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Camden&quot;, along with seven other vessels in the Carrier Battle Group, left San Diego on 15 July 1983 and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer. The battle group comprised the carrier &quot;Ranger&quot;, the cruiser , the guided missile destroyer , the destroyers and , the frigate , the oiler and &quot;Camden&quot;.

On 17 May 1987 &quot;Camden&quot; was redirected to assist the damaged after it was attacked by unfriendly fire. &quot;Camden&quot;″s job was to unload all of the weapons on board &quot;Stark&quot; in case of further attack.

In 1991, &quot;Camden&quot; was deployed to resupply the aircraft carrier and support ships, which were returning to the U.S. from duty in the Persian Gulf after taking part in Operation Desert Storm. On 15 August 1991, four airmen from the Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 11 based on &quot;Camden&quot; were reported missing and presumed dead after their Sea Knight helicopter crashed while resupplying ships in the around east Wake Island. Two ships were close by when the aircraft dropped into the water, and two helicopters were immediately launched for an air search. The ships in the area also launched whaleboats to assist in the search, which was ultimately unsuccessful. In 1992, CURV-III recovered the wreckage of the helicopter from a depth of , setting the world record for deepest salvage at the time.

Following the repeal of the Combat Exclusion Law in 1993, &quot;Camden&quot; was one of the first US Navy ships to host female servicemembers, specifically two helicopter pilots including Captain Tracy Barkheimer.

In March 1996, &quot;Camden&quot; was awarded its third consecutive Battle &quot;E&quot; for demonstrating excellence in all warfare and mission categories.

In October 2000, Camden participated in Operation Determined Response, providing rescue assistance and hospitality services in support of in the Yemeni port of Aden after the &quot;Cole&quot; was damaged in a terrorist attack.

In 2004, &quot;Camden&quot; won the Battle &quot;E&quot; again. This was the final year of Battle &quot;E&quot; eligibility for the &quot;Sacramento&quot;-class fast combat support ship.

In January 2005, &quot;Camden&quot; left on its final deployment, an eight-month world tour with escorting that carrier to its new homeport in Norfolk, Virginia. &quot;Camden&quot; was decommissioned 14 October 2005 on Pier Delta at Naval Base Kitsap, Bremerton, Washington, and was disposed of by scrapping at Esco Marine, in Brownsville, Texas by 13 May 2008.

==Power plant==
&quot;Camden&quot;″s power plant was one of two built for the &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleship , which was cancelled in 1947 when 72.1 percent complete. The other &quot;Kentucky&quot; power plant was used to power , the lead ship of her class.

<text>The Multilateral Force (MLF) was an American proposal to produce a fleet of ballistic missile submarines and warships, each crewed by international NATO personnel, and armed with multiple nuclear-armed Polaris ballistic missiles. Its mission would be a nuclear defence of Western Europe against Soviet threats in the Cold War while allowing NATO members besides the U.S. to play a role in nuclear warfare. The proposal was floated by the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations. It was opposed by Britain and faded out in the mid 1960s. It was never adopted.

== History ==
The proposal was inspired by complaints of NATO countries that the nuclear defense of Europe was beholden to the Americans, who held the bulk of nuclear capability. The proposed fleet of warships would be crewed and operated by NATO command, instead of an assortment of independent forces ultimately under their own national banners. In this way, other NATO powers were theoretically ensured an active role in European defense.

The idea of using surface ships as part of the force received criticism in Europe, who felt that surface ships would be vulnerable to attack, while a wholly submarine force would be more difficult to eliminate. President Kennedy argued that using only submarines would defeat the purpose of minimizing American control of the force, as the United States was the primary power capable of building the requisite number of submarines and training their crews. Including surface vessels would allow for greater European involvement in both construction and training, argued Kennedy, who also dismissed the notion that an entire pan-Europe nuclear-armed fleet could be eliminated before any of them could commit retaliatory strikes.

The proposal eventually fell flat when American and European differences over basing strategies and financing could not be reconciled. The Italian cruiser &quot;Giuseppe Garibaldi&quot; was actually refitted with four launchers for Polaris missiles. Despite the successful launching tests, the U.S. never went ahead with the MLF. Instead the Italian government set out to develop an indigenous nuclear weapons program, with a successful missile called Alfa, officially halted by Italian Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ratification.

The prospect of having West Germany in the Multilateral Force was mocked by Tom Lehrer in the satirical song &quot;MLF Lullaby&quot;.

==MLF experiment on USS &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot;==
From June 1964 to the end of 1965 was part of a mixed-manning experiment for the proposed MLF. Its crew consisted of 10 officers and 164 crew from the US Navy with the remainder (normally 24 officers and 330 enlisted) filled by sailors from West Germany, Italy, Greece, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Turkey. Though the MLF never was created, Secretary of the Navy Paul Nitze stated that the project on &quot;Claude V. Ricketts&quot; was successful.

<doc id="1163963" wikidata="Q731848" url="?curid=1163963" title="Terra Nova Bay">
<text>Terra Nova Bay () is a bay which is often ice free, about long, lying between Cape Washington and the Drygalski Ice Tongue along the coast of Victoria Land, Antarctica. It was discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (known as the Discovery Expedition) under Robert Falcon Scott, 1901–1904, and named by him after &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, one of the relief ships for the expedition.

The Italian permanent Zucchelli Station is located in the bay, as is the Jang Bogo Station of South Korea. The Chinese Qinling Station on Inexpressible Island, opened in 2024, is their fifth station in Antarctica.

==Geography==
The Terra Nova Bay is delimited to the north by Cape Washington.
To the west of that cape is Oscar Point, facing Markham Island, and Shield Nunatak at the mouth of the Campbell Glacier, which extends its tongue southward into the bay.
East of that the Northern Foothills extend south into the bay to the west of Gerlache Inlet.
At the south of the foothills are Evans Cove, south of Hells Gate and the Hells Gate Moraine, between Cape Russell to the east and Inexpressible Island to the west.
The Priestley Glacier flows to the east of the Northern Foothills into the Nansen Ice Sheet.
The Larsen Glacier enters the bay to the south of the Nansen Ice Sheet, flowing towards Relief Inlet, which defines the south of the bay, north of the Drygalski Ice Tongue.

The ice shelves and glaciers around Terra Nova Bay play an important role in the dynamics of Terra Nova Bay. 
During the winter, the bay is often sea ice free; it acts as a coastal polynya due to the katabatic winds that blow off the David, Reeves and Priestley glaciers and Nansen Ice shelf, making this an important region for sea ice formation and high salinity shelf water.

== Climate ==
The climate in Terra Nova Bay is mostly dominated by the katabatic winds that blow off the David, Reeves and Priestly glaciers and Nansen Ice shelf. 
Temperatures recorded by weather stations around Zucchelli Station, the Italian base, are between in January and between in the winter months. Relative humidity is around 50% all year round, but due to the cold temperatures, the amount of water vapor is very low.
Wind is a dominant factor in the climate of Terra Nova Bay, it experiences katabatic winds from the west, barrier winds from the south and eastern flows. The katabatic winds are particularly strong in Terra Nova Bay and originate from the SW if from the Priestly glacier and NW if from the Reeves glacier, forming a polynya event. In summer 30% of the winds are katabatic and 50% in winter and are often paired with Lee waves and clear skies. The cyclone of the Ross Sea pushes air off the Ross shelf northward along the mountain range on Victoria land, causing relative humid southern winds along the coast.

==Antarctic Specially Protected Area==
A marine area of of the bay comprising a narrow strip of coastal waters about long, to the immediate south of Zucchelli Station, and extending to a maximum of from the shore, has been designated an Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA 161). It is an important site for long-term research on the marine ecology of benthic communities. As well as rich and complex sponge and anthozoan communities, the site supports a colony of Adélie penguins at Adélie Cove.

==Features==
Named features of the bay, from north to south, include:

===Cape Washington===
. 
A prominent cape, high, marking the south extremity of the peninsula which separates Wood Bay and Terra Nova Bay. 
Discovered in 1841 by Captain James Clark Ross, Royal Navy, and named by him for Captain John Washington, Royal Navy, who was secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, 1836–40.

===Oscar Point===
A small rock point along the north shore of Terra Nova Bay, northwest of Markham Island. 
Discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition (BrAE) 1898–1900, and named for King Oscar of Norway and Sweden.
Carsten Borchgrevink, the leader of this expedition, was a native of Norway. 
Originally charted by Borchgrevink as an island, the feature is now known to be joined to the coast.

===Markham Island===
A small but conspicuous island lying just off Oscar Point in the north part of Terra Nova Bay.
Discovered in February 1900 by the BrAE (1898–1900) under C.E. Borchgrevink, who named it for Sir Clements Markham.

===Shield Nunatak===
A prominent nunatak standing at the east side of the terminus of Campbell Glacier on the north shore of Terra Nova Bay. 
This feature, a multiple volcanic cone, was so named by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1965–66, because it looks like an old Viking shield.

===Gerlache Inlet===
An inlet wide in the northwest corner of Terra Nova Bay, indenting the Northern Foothills just south of Mount Browning. 
The name appears to have been applied by the BrNAE, 1901–04, and honors Belgian Antarctic explorer Lieutenant Adrien de Gerlache.

===Evans Cove===
A cove in Terra Nova Bay, entered between Inexpressible Island and Cape Russell. 
First charted by the BrAE, 1907–09. 
Probably named by Shackleton for Captain P.P. Evans, master of the ship &quot;Koonya&quot;, which towed the Nimrod south in 1907, and later master of the Nimrod during the last year of the expedition.

===Inexpressible Island===
An island, long, in Terra Nova Bay, lying close south of the Northern Foothills at the outer edge of the Nansen Ice Sheet. 
First explored by the Northern Party of the BrAE, 1910–13, and called &quot;Southern Foothills&quot; in contradistinction to the Northern Foothills. 
The name was changed to Inexpressible Island by the party after spending a very unpleasant winter on half rations in a cave in a snowdrift on the island.

===Relief Inlet===
A narrow inlet at the southwest corner of Terra Nova Bay. 
The feature is formed along a shear plane caused by differential ice movement near the coast of Victoria Land involving the north edge of Drygalski Ice Tongue and south extremities of the Nansen Ice Sheet. 
So named by the South Magnetic Polar Party, led by T.W.E. David, of the BrAE, 1907–09, because, after almost giving up hope of rescue, the Nimrod picked up the party here.

<text>Idwal Iwrch (), or Idwal ap Cadwaladr (), reigned c. 682 – c. 720, is a figure in the genealogies of the kings of Gwynedd. He was the son of King Cadwaladr (reigned c. 655 – c. 682) and the father of King Rhodri Molwynog (died 754). William Wynne places Cynan Dindaethwy as his son, but other sources have Cynan as the son of Rhodri. The records of this era are scanty, and Idwal&#x27;s name appears only in the pedigrees of later kings and in a prophecy found in two 14th century Welsh manuscripts, which says that he will succeed his father Cadwaladr as king.

The only mention of Idwal Iwrch in the historical record is the appearance of his name in genealogies such as those from Jesus College MS. 20 (as the father of &quot;Rhodri Molwynog son of Idwal Iwrch son of Cadwaladr Fendigiad&quot;) and the Harleian genealogies (as the father of &quot;Rotri son of Intguaul son of Catgualart&quot;). John Davies&#x27;; &quot;History of Wales&quot; does not mention Idwal, while John Edward Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; says only that Idwal was Rhodri Molwynog&#x27;s father. The King of Gwynedd during Idwal&#x27;s lifetime is not known, and while he is one of the most likely candidates (because he was both the son of a king and the father of a king), there is no sufficiently reliable basis to either assert or deny it.

Idwal&#x27;s name appears in the &quot;Dialogue between Myrddin and his sister Gwenddydd&quot; (), a Middle Welsh vaticinatory poem whose text is preserved in two medieval Welsh manuscripts, Peniarth 3 (c. 1300) and the Red Book of Hergest (c. 1380–1410). In the text&#x27;s question-answer form, a succession of &quot;future&quot; kings is prophesied, with Idwal among them. This succession agrees with the historical genealogies from father to son but does not agree with the known royal succession.

<doc id="1163976" wikidata="Q3761668" url="?curid=1163976" title="Priestley Glacier">
<text>The Priestley Glacier () is a major valley glacier, about long, originating at the edge of the Polar Plateau of Victoria Land, Antarctica. The glacier drains southeast between the Deep Freeze Range and Eisenhower Range to enter the northern end of the Nansen Ice Sheet.
It was first explored by the Northern Party of the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13, and named for Raymond Priestley, a geologist with the Northern Party.

==Geography==

The Priestly Glacier is fed by the Priestly Névé, which lies to the east of the polar plateau, south of the Lister Nunataks, Brawn Rocks and Rennick Névé.
It runs southeast between the Szanto Spur and Wasson Rock to the northeast and Clingman Peak, Tantalus Peak and the Ogden Heights to the southwest.
Foolsmate Glacier joins it from the southwest.
It continues southeast between the Eisenhower Range to the southwest and the Deep Freeze Range to the northeast. 
The Nash Ridge forms part of its southwest flank.
South of this it is fed by O&#x27;Kane Glacier from the northwest, which in turn receives ice from O&#x27;Kane Canyon.
South of Black Ridge on its eastern flank, as it merges into the Nansen Ice Sheet, it is fed by the Corner Glacier.

==Tributaries==

===Foolsmate Glacier===
A small, heavily crevassed tributary glacier flowing northeast to enter Priestley Glacier, west of Shafer Peak. 
The name was applied by the Southern Party of the NZGSAE, 1962-63.

===O&#x27;Kane Glacier===
A steep glacier, long, draining the east wall of Eisenhower Range between Mount Baxter and Eskimo Point and flowing southeast to its terminus opposite the mouths of the Priestley and Corner Glaciers at the north extremity of Nansen Ice Sheet.
Named by US-ACAN in association with O&#x27;Kane Canyon, located at the head of the glacier.

===O&#x27;Kane Canyon===
A steep-walled canyon at the head of O&#x27;Kane Glacier, indenting the east side of Eisenhower Range between Mount Baxter and Eskimo Point. 
Named by the Southern Party of NZGSAE, 1962–63, for H.D. O&#x27;Kane, photographer at Scott Base, 1961-62. 
O&#x27;Kane had made several reconnaissance flights to provide aerial photographs of the area.

===Corner Glacier===
A steep glacier descending Deep Freeze Range between Black Ridge and Mount Dickason to merge with the confluent ice of Nansen Ice Sheet. 
First explored by the Northern Party of the British Antarctic Expedition (BrAE), 1910-13, and so named by them because of its location with respect to the Nansen Ice Sheet.

==Other features==

===Priestley Névé===
The névé at the head of Priestley Glacier. 
Named by the New Zealand Antarctic Place-Names Committee (NZ-APC) in about 1966 in association with Priestley Glacier.

===Lister Nunataks===
Isolated nunataks located in the north reaches of Priestley Névé, about south-southwest of Brawn Rocks. 
Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Larry W. Lister, helicopter flight crewman with United States Navy Squadron VX-6 during Operation Deep Freeze 1966, 1967 and 1968.

===Brawn Rocks===
Prominent isolated rocks extending over long, lying southwest of Sequence Hills. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for James E. Brawn, aviation machinist&#x27;s mate with United States Navy Squadron VX-6 at McMurdo Station, 1966.

===Szanto Spur===
A noteworthy rock spur jutting from the north wall into Priestley Glacier, at the head of the glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for Otto R. Szanto, United States Navy, radio man who served in Antarctic support activities for four seasons at McMurdo Station in the 1960s.

===Wasson Rock===
A prominent, mainly ice-free rock situated along the north wall near the head of Priestley Glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for William G. Wasson, aviation electrician&#x27;s mate with United States Navy Squadron VX-6 at McMurdo Station, 1966.

===Clingman Peak===
The final peak, high, along the south wall at the head of Priestley Glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for Otis Clingman, Jr., biologist at McMurdo Station, 1965-66.

===Tantalus Peak===
The highest peak, high, along the south wall at the head of Priestley Glacier. 
So named by the southern party of New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1962–63, because an attempt to establish a station there proved abortive due to steep ice. 
(Tantalus, son of Zeus, was punished for transgressions by &quot;standing in water that ebbed when he would drink.&quot;)

===Ogden Heights===
Flattish, mainly ice-covered heights, about long, forming a part of the south wall of upper Priestley Glacier to the southeast of Tantalus Peak. 
The heights are near where the southern party of the NZGSAE, 1962–63, was landed.
Named by them for Lieutenant John H. Ogden, United States Navy, pilot who airlifted the party to this point, flew in their resupply, and later flew the party back to base at the end of the season.

===Simpson Crags===
A series of rugged crags descending southeast from Mount Baxter of the Eisenhower Range and forming the south wall of O&#x27;Kane Glacier.
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1955-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Lieutenant Commander William A. Simpson, Jr., United States Navy, aircraft commander with Squadron VX-6 during USN Operation Deep Freeze 1967.

<text>Zollernia is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It includes 10 species native to South America, ranging from Venezuela and the Guianas to southern Brazil. &quot;Zollernia&quot; are trees or shrubs that flower annually. Species are most commonly found in dense moist forests, but also grow in seasonally-dry cerrado (savanna and open woodland) and caatinga (deciduous thorn woodland and scrub).

Leaves of &quot;Zollernia ilicifolia&quot; are used medicinally as an analgesic and antiulcerogenic by the peoples of the Brazilian tropical Atlantic Rainforest.

<text>Toss bombing (sometimes known as loft bombing, and by the U.S. Air Force as the Low Altitude Bombing System, or LABS) is a method of bombing where the attacking aircraft pulls upward when releasing its bomb load, giving the bomb additional time of flight by starting its ballistic path with an upward vector.

The purpose of toss bombing is to compensate for the gravity drop of the bomb in flight, and allow an aircraft to bomb a target without flying directly over it. This is to avoid overflying a heavily defended target, or to distance the attacking aircraft from the blast effects of a nuclear (or conventional) bomb.

==Bomb tactics==

===Pop-up===
In pop-up bombing, the pilot approaches from low altitude in level flight, and on cues from the computer pulls up at the last moment to release the bomb. Release usually occurs between 20° and 75° above the horizontal, causing the bomb to be tossed upward and forward, much like an underarm throw of a ball.

===Level toss===
Although &quot;pop-up&quot; bombing is generally characterized by its low-level approach, the same technique of a toss starting from level flight can be used at any altitude when it is not desirable to overfly the target. Additional altitude at release gives the bomb additional time of flight and range, at the cost (in the case of unguided munitions) of accuracy due to windage and the increased effect of a slight deviation in flight path.

===Dive toss===
The &quot;Dive-toss&quot; delivery technique was the first &quot;toss&quot; bombing method developed after WWII at the US Navy&#x27;s rocket development center at Inyokern, California in 1947 as a method to attack heavily defended targets without unduly endangering the attacking aircraft. Although toss bombing might seem the direct opposite to dive bombing, where the plane pitches downward to aim at its target, toss bombing is often performed with a short dive before the bomber raises its nose and releases its bomb. This variant is known as &quot;dive tossing&quot;. This gives both the bomb and aircraft extra momentum, thereby helping the aircraft regain altitude after the release, and also ensuring that airspeed at the calculated release point is still sufficient to get the bomb to the target.

===Over-the-shoulder===

A more dynamic variant of toss bombing, called over-the-shoulder bombing, or the LABS (Low Altitude Bombing System) maneuver (known to pilots as the &quot;idiot&#x27;s loop&quot;), is a particular kind of loft bombing where the bomb is released past the vertical so it is tossed back toward the target. This tactic was first made public on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B-47 entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 &quot;g&quot;) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under automatic control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target.

Author and retired USAF F-84 pilot Richard Bach describes such an attack in his book &quot;Stranger to the Ground&quot;:
The last red-roofed village flashes below me, and the target, a pyramid of white barrels, is just visible at the end of its run-in line. Five hundred knots. Switch down, button pressed. Timers begin their timing, circuits are alerted for the drop. Inch down to treetop altitude. I do not often fly at 500 knots on the deck, and it is apparent that I am moving quickly. The barrels inflate. I see that their white paint is flaking. And the pyramid streaks beneath me. Back on the stick smoothly firmly to read four G on the accelerometer and center the needles of the indicator that is only used in nuke weapon drops and center them and hold it there and I&#x27;ll bet those computers are grinding their little hearts out and all I can see is sky in the windscreen hold the G&#x27;s keep the needles centered there&#x27;s the sun going beneath me and WHAM.

My airplane rolls hard to the right and tucks more tightly into her loop and strains ahead even though we are upside down. The Shape has released me more than I have released it. The little white barrels are now six thousand feet directly beneath my canopy. I have no way to tell if it was a good drop or not. That was decided back with the charts and graphs and the dividers and the angles. I kept the needles centered, the computers did their task automatically, and the Device is on its way.

==Tactical use==
Toss bombing is generally used by pilots whenever it is not desirable to overfly the target with the aircraft at an altitude sufficient for dive-bombing or level bombing. Such cases include heavy anti-air defenses such as AAA and SAMs, when deploying powerful weapons such as &quot;iron bombs&quot; or even tactical nuclear bombs, and the use of limited-aspect targeting devices for guided munitions.

To counter air defenses en route to the target, remaining at a low altitude for as long as possible allows the bomber to avoid radar and visual tracking and the launch envelope of older missile systems designed to be fired at targets overflying the missile site. However, a level pass at the target at low altitude will not only expose the aircraft to short-range defenses surrounding the target, but will place the aircraft in the bomb&#x27;s blast radius. By executing a &quot;pop-up&quot; loft, on the other hand, the pilot releases the munition well outside the target area, out of range of air defenses. After release, the pilot can either dive back to low altitude or maintain the climb, in either case generally executing a sharp turn or &quot;slice&quot; away from the target. The blast produced by powerful munitions is thus (hopefully) avoided.

The value of toss-bombing was increased with the introduction of precision-guided munitions such as the laser-guided bomb. Previous &quot;dumb bombs&quot; required a very high degree of pilot and fire control computer precision to loft the bomb accurately to the target. Unguided loft bombing also generally called for the use of a larger bomb than would be necessary for a direct hit, in order to generate a larger blast that would destroy the target even if the bomb did not hit accurately due to windage or computer/pilot error. Laser-targeting (and other methods like GPS as used in the JDAM system) allows the bomb to correct minor deviations from the intended ballistic path after it has been released, making toss-bombing as accurate as level bombing while still providing most of the advantages of toss-bombing using unguided munitions. However, the targeting pods used to deliver guided munitions generally have a limit to their field of view; most specifically, the pod usually cannot look behind the aircraft at more than a certain angle. Lofting the bomb allows the pilot to keep the target in front of the aircraft and thus within the targeting pod&#x27;s field of view for as long as possible.

&quot;Dive-tossing&quot; is generally used at moderate altitude (to allow for the dive) when the target, for whatever reason, cannot be designated precisely by radar. A target for instance may present too small a signature to be visible on radar (such as the entrance to an underground bunker) or may be indistinguishable in a group of radar returns. The pilot can in this case use a special &quot;boresight&quot; mode that allows the pilot to designate a target by pointing his aircraft directly at it. For a target on the ground, this means entering a dive. Thus designated, the pilot can then begin a climb, lofting the bomb at the target from a distance and regaining lost altitude at the same time.

==Technology==
Due to the intense pilot workload involved with flying and entering the window of opportunity, some aircraft are equipped with a “Toss Bomb Computer” (in US nuclear delivery, a part of the Low Altitude Bombing System) that enables the pilot to release the bomb at the correct angle. The Toss Bomb Computer takes airspeed inputs from the aircraft&#x27;s pitot system, altitude inputs from the static system, attitude inputs from the gyroscopic system and inputs from weapons selectors signifying the type of bomb to calculate the appropriate release point of the ordnance. Instead of triggering the release directly, the pilot instead &quot;consents&quot; to release the weapon, then begins a steady climb. The computer then calculates the desired ballistic path, and when that path will be produced by the current aircraft attitude and airspeed, the computer releases the bomb. During the Second World War the engineers Erik Wilkenson and Torsten Faxén at Saab developed the first bomb sight for toss bombing. It was a mechanical computer that did the necessary calculations. It was first used in the Saab 17 and was standard on all Saab fighters up to and including Saab 32 Lansen. It was also sold to France, Switzerland, Denmark and USA and was used in for instance the Boeing B-47 Stratojet.

While deployed in Europe with NATO, RCAF CF-104 fighter-bombers carried a Toss Bomb Computer until their nuclear role was eliminated by the Canadian government effective 1 January 1972.

The same computational solutions used in the LABS system are now incorporated into two of the major bombing modes (the computer-controlled CCRP and a dedicated visually oriented &quot;Dive-Toss&quot; mode) of the Fire Control Computer of modern strike fighters such as the F-15E and F-16. As with LABS, the pilot designates their desired impact point, then consents to release while executing a climb, and the computer controls the actual release of the bomb. The integration into the FCC simplifies the pilot&#x27;s workload by allowing the same bombing mode (CCRP) to be used for level, dive and loft bombing, providing similar cues in the pilot&#x27;s displays regardless of the tactics used, since the computer simply sees it as the release point getting closer.

<doc id="1163997" wikidata="Q2910733" url="?curid=1163997" title="Border ruffian">
<text>Border ruffians were proslavery raiders who crossed into the Kansas Territory from Missouri during the mid-19th century to help ensure the territory entered the United States as a slave state. Their activities formed a major part of a series of violent civil confrontations known as &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;, which peaked from 1854 to 1858. Crimes committed by border ruffians included electoral fraud, intimidation, assault, property damage and murder; many border ruffians took pride in their reputation as criminals. After the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, many border ruffians fought on the side of the Confederate States of America as irregular bushwhackers.

==Origin==

Ferrying Missouri voters [across the [[Missouri River]]] to the Kansas shore, by [[Gilbert Gaul (artist)|Gilbert Gaul]]
The 1913 edition of Webster&#x27;s Dictionary reflects the 19th century understanding of the word as a &quot;scoundrel, rascal, or unprincipled, deceitful, brutal and unreliable person&quot;.

Among the first to use the term &quot;border ruffian&quot; in connection with the slavery issue in Kansas was the &quot;Herald of Freedom&quot;, a newspaper published in Lawrence, Kansas. On October 8, 1857, it reported the following:
Armed with revolvers and Bowie knives, border ruffians forcefully interfered in the Kansas row over slavery. A correspondent for the London Times while visiting Kansas in 1856 reported many occurrences of the so-called &quot;bowie-knife voting&quot; in Kansas when voters were heckled and harassed by border ruffians. In response, the New England Emigrant Aid Company shipped Sharps rifles to the Kansas Territory, in crates said to have been labeled &quot;Bibles&quot;.

At that time, many Kansas settlers opposed slavery. However, slavery advocates were determined to have their way regardless. When elections were held, bands of armed border ruffians seized polling places, prevented Free-State men from voting, and cast votes illegally, falsely stating they were Kansas residents.

Border ruffians operated from Missouri. It was said that they voted and shot in Kansas, but slept in Missouri. They not only interfered in territorial elections, but also committed outrages on Free-State settlers and destroyed their property. This violence gave the origin of the phrase &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;. However, political killings and violence were exercised by both warring sides.

The federal government did not interfere to stop the violence. Hence, such ignominious episodes as the sacking of Lawrence, Kansas, in May 1856 became possible. U.S. Senator David Rice Atchison (D-Missouri) personally incited the assembling mob:

Border ruffians contributed to the increasingly violent sectional tensions, culminating in the American Civil War.

==Leaders and followers==
Border ruffians did not constitute an organized group. They never had meetings, had no designated leaders, and no one ever directed any message to them as a body.

Border ruffians were driven by the rhetoric of politicians such as David Rice Atchison, Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow, John H. Stringfellow, editor of the pro-slavery newspaper &quot;Squatter Sovereign&quot; (Atchison, Kansas), and Speaker of the House in the First Kansas Territorial Legislature, the so-called Bogus Legislature. and Rev. Thomas Johnson, a Methodist preacher. Samuel J. Jones, and Daniel Woodson, a proslavery newspaper editor. In particular, Atchison called Northerners &quot;negro thieves&quot; and &quot;abolitionist tyrants&quot;. He encouraged Missourians to defend their institution &quot;with the bayonet and with blood&quot; and, if necessary, &quot;to kill every God-damned abolitionist in the district&quot;.

Few of the ordinary border ruffians actually owned slaves because most were too poor. Their motivation was hatred of Yankees and abolitionists, and fear of free Blacks living nearby. Kansas slavery was small-scale and operated mainly at the household level. Most of the Kansans, according to historian David M. Potter, were concerned primarily about land titles. He pointed out that, &quot;the great anomaly of &#x27;Bleeding Kansas&#x27; is that the slavery issue reached a condition of intolerable tension and violence ... in an area where a majority of the inhabitants apparently did not care very much one way or the other about slavery.&quot;

Frank W. Blackmar&#x27;s encyclopedia of Kansas history summarizes how the rank-and-file among border ruffians took pride in both how they were called and what they were doing:
The presence of violent bands of both Kansan and Missourian combatants made it difficult for settlers on the Kansas–Missouri border to remain neutral.
==History==

The history of border ruffians is woven into the historical context of Bleeding Kansas, or the border war, a series of violent civil confrontations in Kansas in 1854–1859. Kansas Territory was created by the Kansas–Nebraska Act of 1854. The Act repealed the previous Federal prohibition on slavery in that area. Instead, the locally elected territorial legislature was to decide on the slavery issue.

The first territorial census, taken in January–February 1855, counted 8601 people; 2905 were deemed eligible to vote; there were 192 enslaved in the Territory.

After the Kansas–Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and allowed Kansans to vote on slavery, the opponents from both sides of the slavery debate started to recruit settlers to increase support of their causes.

===Immigration to Kansas===
Proslavery immigrants aided by the Lafayette Emigration Society, and anti-slavery settlers, established their own territorial enclave (such as Atchison and Leavenworth), and Free-State immigrants aided by the New England Emigrant Aid Company established theirs (such as Lawrence, Topeka). This circumstance resulted in a deep partisan divide in regard to the slavery question among settlers and their civic and business leaders. Then extremists on both side resorted to arms. On the pro-slavery side violence was committed by the border ruffians and on the free-state side by the jayhawkers.

On November 29, 1854, border ruffians elected a pro-slavery territorial representative to Congress, John W. Whitfield. It was determined after a Congressional investigation that 60% of the votes were illegal.

On March 30, 1855, border ruffians elected a pro-slavery Territorial Legislature, which introduced harsh penalties for speaking against slavery. It was called the Bogus Legislature by Free-Staters due to the fact that border ruffians arrived &quot;en masse&quot; and there were twice as many votes cast than there were eligible voters in the Territory. Failure to ensure fair elections led to establishment of two territorial governments in Kansas, one pro-slavery and another Free State, each claiming to be the only legitimate government of the entire Territory.

Despite all border ruffians&#x27; attempts to push anti-slavery settlers out of the Territory, far more Free-State immigrants moved to Kansas than pro-slavery. In 1857, the pro-slavery faction in Kansas proposed the Lecompton Constitution for the future state of Kansas. It tried to get the Lecompton Constitution adopted with additional fraud and violence, but by then there were too many Free-Staters there and the U.S. Congress refused to confirm it.

Border ruffians also engaged in general violence against Free-State settlements. They burned farms and sometimes murdered Free-State men. Most notoriously, border ruffians twice attacked Lawrence, the Free-State capital of the Kansas Territory. On December 1, 1855, a small army of border ruffians laid siege to Lawrence, but were driven off. This became the nearly bloodless climax to the &quot;Wakarusa War&quot;.

On May 21, 1856, an even larger force of border ruffians and pro-slavery Kansans captured Lawrence, which they sacked.

Free-State settlers struck back. Anti-slavery Kansan irregulars, led by Charles R. Jennison, James Montgomery, and James H. Lane, among others, and known as jayhawkers, attacked proslavery settlers and suspected border ruffian sympathizers. Most notoriously, abolitionist John Brown killed five proslavery men at Pottawatomie. In revenge, a band of border ruffians, led by John W. Reid, sacked the village of Osawatomie, Kansas after the Battle of Osawatomie.

===Aid to the Free-State cause===
T. W. Higginson, a minister, was instrumental in turning the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee, a former subsidiary of the New England Emigrant Aid Company, into a nationally known organization. It worked to recruit abolitionist settlers, raised funds for them to migrate to Kansas, and equipped them with rifles to use against border ruffians. In 1856 it acquired 200 Sharps rifles for $4,947.88 that were shipped to Kansas via Iowa and ended in John Brown&#x27;s hands. In September 1858, it invested $3,800 in 190 Sharps rifles for Kansas. Abolitionist Henry W. Beecher pronounced that, It was documented that in 1855–1856 various aid organizations from free states spent at least $43,074.26 on rifles, muskets, revolvers, and ammunition, including one cannon, destined for Kansas.

On July 9, 1856, the Massachusetts State Kansas Committee and the New England Emigrant Aid Company initiated the establishment of the Kansas National Aid Committee headquartered in Chicago. Thaddeus Hyatt, head of the national committee, began collecting money, arms, provisions, clothing, and agricultural supplies to aid the Free-State cause in Kansas. The goal was to transport five thousand settlers to Kansas Territory giving them a year&#x27;s worth of supplies.

A distribution depot was set up at Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, where immigrants were furnished not only with horses and wagons and other supplies, but also with arms; they were organized into companies and drilled. The National Kansas Committee spent in 1856–1857 around on the Free State cause.

===Outcomes===
On August 2, 1858, the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution of 1857 was rejected at the polls, signifying the defeat of border ruffians&#x27; cause. On January 29, 1861, President James Buchanan signed the bill that approved the Wyandotte Constitution and Kansas came to the Union as a Free State.

===During the Civil War===
During the American Civil War, the violence on the Kansas-Missouri border not only continued, but escalated tremendously. Many of the former border ruffians became pro-Confederate guerrillas, or bushwhackers. They operated in western Missouri, sometimes raiding into Kansas, and Union forces campaigned to suppress them. Farms on the Missouri-Kansas state line were looted and burned. Suspected guerrillas were killed; in retaliation, bushwhackers murdered Union sympathizers and suspected informers. Confederate guerrilla leaders, such as &quot;Bloody Bill&quot; Anderson and William Quantrill, were feared in Kansas during the war.

Many of the Union troops fighting bushwackers were former jayhawkers who held deep grudges against border ruffians. Charles R. Jennison recruited the 7th Kansas Cavalry Regiment, which became known as the Jennison&#x27;s Jayhawkers. In the fall and winter of 1861 and 1862, Jennison&#x27;s Jayhawkers became infamous for looting and destroying the property of Missourians.

Some of the jayhawkers joined a paramilitary group called the Red Legs. Wearing red gaiters and numbered around 100, Red Legs served as scouts during the punitive expedition of the Union troops in Missouri. Jayhawkers and Red Legs pillaged and burned multiple towns in 1861–1863 in Missouri. The destruction of Osceola, Missouri, is depicted in the movie &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;.

In &quot;Aval Varuvala&quot; she received positive acclaim with one reviewer stating that her performance showed &quot;she can act&quot;. She was the female lead in &quot;Natpukkaga&quot; which would go on to win the Filmfare Award for Best Film – Tamil and the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film. During this period she was first seen with Prashanth in &quot;Kannedhirey Thondrinal&quot;. The commercial success of the film and their popularity as an onscreen pair meant that they would be seen together in several future films.

Simran&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Thulladha Manamum Thullum&quot; would garner her the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Actress, and would lead to reviewers referring to her as being “among the leading actresses in Tamil films”.

In 2000, Simran starred in the Telugu film &quot;Kalisundam Raa&quot;. The film would receive the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu and the Nandi Award for Best Feature Film. The acclaim led to her establishing more of a presence in the Telugu film industry. In &quot;Nuvvu Vastavani&quot;, a Telugu remake of &quot;Thulladha Manamum Thullum&quot; in which Simran had starred, Simran reprised her role as the female lead. Simran was also seen in Hindi films such as &quot;Khauff&quot; at this time. In 2001, &quot;Narasimha Naidu&quot; in particular received a lot of commercial and critical acclaim. The films &quot;Yuvaraju&quot; and &quot;Seema Simham&quot; were unsuccessful, however Simran continued to build her reputation. &quot;Daddy&quot; saw commercial success

=== Focus on television (2005–2013) ===
After being seen in 74 films in the ten years since her debut, Simran became more selective in the projects that she pursued

Several of Simran&#x27;s Tamil projects were unsuccessful during this period including &quot;Kicha Vayasu 16&quot; (2005), &quot;Seval&quot; (2008) and &quot;Ainthaam Padai&quot; (2009).

However, &quot;Vaaranam Aayiram&quot; received widespread critical and commercial acclaim. Simran specifically won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress – Tamil and the Vijay Award for Best Supporting Actress.

They followed it up with a second production, Dance Tamizha Dance Little Masters, focused on under-14 performers from Tamil Nadu, with Simran continuing as a judge.

=== Career expansion (2014–present) ===
Simran returned to the big screen with a series of unsuccessful films such as &quot;Aaha Kalyanam&quot; (the Tamil remake of &quot;Band Baaja Baaraat&quot;) in 2014, &quot;Trisha Illana Nayanthara&quot; (2015) and &quot;Koditta Idangalai Nirappuga&quot; (2017). She was widely believed to have made her comeback with 2018&#x27;s &quot;Seemaraja&quot;. She followed it up with &quot;Petta&quot;, which received critical and commercial acclaim, becoming the second highest grossing Tamil film of the year. She continued working as a producer, producing and starring in a Hindi music video.

In 2020 she made her streaming debut with Netflix&#x27;s first Tamil film, &quot;Paava Kadhaigal&quot;, receiving positive reviews. This was followed up with &quot;Mahaan&quot; which debuted on Amazon Prime Video after the pandemic meant that a theater release wouldn&#x27;t be possible. It received positive reviews with M Suganth of The Times of India praising Simran and her co-stars for “memorable performances that elevate the scenes and the film”.

Simran reunited with R. Madhavan in &quot;&quot; (2022). It was filmed simultaneously in Tamil, Hindi and English languages.

<text>Operation Northern Delay occurred on 26 March 2003 as part of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. It involved dropping paratroopers into Northern Iraq. It was the last large-scale combat parachute operation conducted by the U.S. military since Operation Just Cause.

==Background==
On 26 March 2003, during the American invasion of Iraq, C-17s of the 62d Airlift Wing, 315th Airlift Wing, 437th Airlift Wing, and 446th Airlift Wing dropped SETAF&#x27;s 173rd Airborne Brigade into Northern Iraq. 996 paratroopers jumped into the Bashur drop zone (). The operation forced the Iraqi Army to maintain approximately six divisions in the area to protect its northern flank, providing strategic relief for Coalition Forces advancing on Baghdad from the south. Bashur Airfield is located in northern Iraq approximately 356 kilometers north of Baghdad, 50 kilometers northeast of Erbil. The airbase is served by a single 6,700-foot long runway. Bashur appeared to be a small civilian airport.

Bashur is the epitome of a bare base. It was nothing more than a 7,000-foot runway in the middle of a green valley. It had no infrastructure – no water or sewage system and no electricity, buildings or paved roads.

==Operation==

On 26 March 2003, more than 950 paratroopers from the 173d Airborne Brigade commanded by Col. Bill Mayville consisting of 1-508 (ABN) Infantry commanded by Lt. Col. Harry Tunnell and 2-503 (ABN) Infantry commanded by Lt. Col. Dominic Caraccilo jumped into Bashur, Iraq, to set the stage for a northern front. Two days later, the first soldier from the 501st Forward Support Company, 173d Airborne Brigade, Supply Support Activity (SSA) arrived at Bashur Airfield. The operation was classified as a combat jump by the Army, although the landing zone was secured by Kurdish and American forces, which is not typical of combat jumps.
During the next two weeks at Bashur Airfield, all supplies arrived via the airlines of communication (ALOC) on C-17s and C-130s from Ramstein Air Base, Germany through Aviano AB, Italy. During an average 24-hour day of operations, more than 40 Air Force 463L ALOC pallets would arrive. Each pallet then had to be downloaded from the plane, transported to the SSA, processed and finally issued either to storage or to customers.

Some of the C-17s carried huge M1A1 Abrams tanks and weighed from 250,000 to 300,000 pounds when they landed. After two weeks of use by heavy cargo planes, parts of Bashur&#x27;s 7,000-foot runway crumbled, forcing the closure of 2,300 feet.

==Aftermath==
As of April 2003, Delta Battery 319th Airborne Field Artillery Regiment remained in Bashur, and continued training the New Iraqi Army on key tasks which would be needed in to complete future operations in the region. Delta Battery also provided indirect fire support for coalition forces in the area when coalition forces came into contact with insurgents.

A 20 April 2003 report in the &quot;New York Times&quot; asserted that &quot;the U.S. is planning a long-term military relationship with the emerging government of Iraq, one that would grant the Pentagon access to military bases and project American influence into the heart of the unsettled region.&quot; The report, citing anonymous sources, referred to one base at Baghdad&#x27;s international airport, another near Al-Nasiriyah in the south [presumably meaning Tallil AB], the third at the H-1 airstrip in the western desert, and the fourth at Bashur AB in the north.

Bashur Airbase is now known as Al-Harir Air Base/Harir Airport.

<text>Kenneth Michael Conaway (born June 11, 1948) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 2005 to 2021. He is a member of the Republican Party. The district Conaway represented is located in West Texas and includes Midland, Odessa, San Angelo, Brownwood, and Granbury. Conaway led the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections (with assistance from Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney) after the Intelligence Committee chair, Devin Nunes, recused himself. Aside from serving as the chair of the House Ethics Committee, he served as the chair of the House Agriculture Committee, and later its ranking member. Conaway indicated in July 2019 that he would not be seeking reelection. Conaway was succeeded by fellow Republican August Pfluger.

==Background==
Conaway was born in Borger in the Texas Panhandle northeast of Amarillo, the son of Helen Jean (McCormick) and Louis Denton Conaway. He graduated in 1966 from Permian High School in Odessa in Ector County, where he was a standout player for the Permian Panthers and a member of the first Permian State Championship team in 1965. After High School, he attended Ranger College on a football scholarship before attending Texas A&amp;M University-Commerce (then named East Texas State University), lettering in Football for the Lions from 1966 to 1969 and was a member of two Lone Star Conference championship teams. He majored in Accounting, graduating in 1970.

==Career==

===Military===
Conaway served in the United States Army from 1970 to 1972.

===Private sector===
Conaway was an accountant and became a Certified Public Accountant in 1974, chief financial officer at a bank, and from 1981 to 1986 was the chief financial officer of Arbusto Energy Inc, an oil and gas exploration firm operated by George W. Bush.

===Texas government===
Soon after Bush was elected governor of Texas, he appointed Conaway to the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy, which regulates accountancy in Texas. He served on the board as a volunteer for seven years, the last five as chairman.

* Reliable Energy Caucus
* Sportsmen&#x27;s Caucus
*Congressional Constitution Caucus
*Congressional Western Caucus 
*United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus

====Tenure====
Conaway endorsed former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney for president in 2008. On May 13, 2016, Conaway endorsed the Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump for president in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

In 2006, Conaway voted against extending the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

Conaway served on committees of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the campaign arm of the House Republican caucus. 
In January 2007, Conaway began chairing the three-member audit committee for the NRCC. By January 28, 2008, Conaway had uncovered a fraud, where hundreds of thousands of dollars were missing from NRCC bank accounts, and supposed annual audits on the NRCC books had actually not been performed since 2001.

Conaway introduced legislation to extend and reform the federal tax credit to support wide scale commercial deployment of carbon capture and storage.

Speaker Paul Ryan announced Conaway&#x27;s new role as leader of the House Intelligence Committee in April 2017 after chairman Devin Nunes temporarily recused himself from investigations into Russian interference in the U.S. 2016 election.

In February 2018, Conaway prevented efforts by the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee to investigate financial links between Trump, his businesses, his family and Russian actors. Conaway prevented subpoenas for related bank records, Trump&#x27;s tax returns and witnesses. Democrats on the committee had, for example, asked for subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, which the Trump Organization and Jared Kushner (Trump&#x27;s son-in-law and senior White House advisor) have borrowed extensively from.

In March 2018, Conaway laid out the findings of a report by the Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee. One of the findings was that the committee had found no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in the 2016 election; Democrats on the committee said that they had come to no such conclusion. A few days later, Conaway walked back that finding, saying &quot;Our committee was not charged with answering the collusion idea&quot;. Asked why the committee drew a conclusion if it had not investigated the matter, Conaway denied that the committee had drawn a conclusion, &quot;What we said is we found no evidence of it. That’s a different statement. We found no evidence of collusion.&quot;

In December 2020, Conaway was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives who signed an amicus brief in support of &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania&quot;, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Joe Biden prevailed over incumbent Donald Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of the election held by another state.

====Political campaigns====
Conaway first ran for elective office in 2003, when he ran in a special election for the 19th Congressional District, which came open after 18-year Republican incumbent Larry Combest stepped down shortly after winning a 10th term. Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican Randy Neugebauer. A few months later, the Texas Legislature redrew the state&#x27;s districts in an effort engineered by then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the Lubbock-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich Permian Basin in part because Texas House Speaker Tom Craddick was from that area. This district is heavily Republican – by some accounts, it was the most Republican district in Texas at the time. Republicans had dominated every level of government since the 1980s, and usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area (Glasscock County had voted 93 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy, though it was so heavily Republican that any Democrat would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition.

Conaway was reelected six times with no substantive opposition. He only faced a Democratic challenger three other times–in 2010, 2012 and 2018. Each time, he won at least 75 percent of the vote; neither Democrat cleared 20 percent. Underscoring how Republican this district was, he reelected unopposed in 2006, a year in which Republicans suffered heavy losses nationally. He faced only minor party opposition in 2008 (another year of severe Republican losses nationally), 2014, and 2016, winning each time with roughly 90% of the vote.

Conaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (74 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26 percent).

Conaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014. He polled 107,752 votes (90 percent); his challenger, Libertarian Ryan T. Lange, received 11,607 (10 percent).

Conaway announced in July 2019 that he would not be running for reelection.

====Committee assignments====
;116th Congress
*Committee on Agriculture (Ranking Member)
*Committee on Armed Services
*Committee on Intelligence

==Personal life==

Conaway served on the Midland Independent School District Board from 1985 to 1988.

Conaway is married to Suzanne Kidwell Conaway and their family includes two sons, two daughters, and seven grandchildren.

<text>Framboise () is a Belgian lambic beer fermented with raspberry (&quot;framboise&quot; is the French word for raspberry).

==Beer==
In English, &quot;framboise&quot; is used primarily in reference to a Belgian lambic beer that is fermented using raspberries. It is one of many modern types of fruit beer that have been inspired by the more traditional kriek beer, which is made using sour cherries.

Framboise is usually served in a small footed glass that resembles a champagne flute, only shorter. Most framboise beers are quite sweet, though the Cantillon Brewery produces a tart version called &quot;Rosé de Gambrinus&quot; that is based on the traditional kriek style. The Liefmans brewery uses oud bruin beer instead of lambic to make its framboise beer, resulting in a very different taste. There are other beers outside of Belgium, however, that can be considered &quot;framboise.&quot; For example, the New Glarus Brewing Company in Wisconsin produces a beer called &quot;Raspberry Tart&quot; which they describe as a &quot;Wisconsin Framboise Ale.&quot;

<doc id="1164050" wikidata="Q505730" url="?curid=1164050" title="Lynn Westmoreland">
<text>Leon Acton &quot;Lynn&quot; Westmoreland (born April 2, 1950) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for from 2007 to 2017 and the from 2005 to 2007. He is a member of the Republican Party.

==Early life, education and career==
Westmoreland was born in Atlanta, the son of Margaret Ferrell (née Lawson) and Leon Acton Westmoreland. He grew up in Metro Atlanta. He has no degree beyond a high school diploma. He attended Georgia State University, but dropped out to work in a family construction business in which he later became an executive. He served in the Georgia House of Representatives from 1993 to 2005, rising to the position of House Republican Leader in 2001. He held that position until 2003 when he stepped down in order to devote time to his Congressional campaign in late 2003. He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the US House in 2005.

As Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan gerrymandering during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001. He abandoned his opposition and was instrumental in the mid-decade redistricting that took place in 2005, after Republicans won control of the Georgia legislature in the 2004 elections.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Tenure===
During his first term in the 109th United States Congress, Westmoreland was appointed to the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, U.S. House Committee on Government Reform, and the U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.. In January 2015, the House Intelligence Committee was reorganized, and a subcommittee on Cybersecurity and the National Security Agency was created with Westmoreland appointed to be the subcommittee&#x27;s first chairman.

As a U.S. congressman, Westmoreland cosponsored a bill to place the Ten Commandments in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Westmoreland also sponsored a bill that the Ten Commandments could be displayed in courthouses in a historical setting. In May 2006, political humorist Stephen Colbert interviewed Westmoreland for &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; show segment &quot;Better Know a District&quot;, and during the interview, asked Westmoreland to name the Ten Commandments. Westmoreland was able to name only three of them. Govtrack.us ranked Westmoreland as tied for the most conservative member of the 112th Congress.

Westmoreland led a group of congressmen who opposed the 2006 renewal of certain provisions in the Voting Rights Act that require nine Southern states and a number of counties (mostly in the South) to obtain Federal permission for certain changes to election law or changes in venue. Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting. Despite Westmoreland&#x27;s objections, a strong bipartisan majority renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years without changes.

In 2008, Westmoreland ran unopposed in the Republican primary and was re-elected after defeating his Democratic opponent Stephen Camp. After his win, Westmoreland announced that he was considering running for the office of Governor of Georgia in 2010, but later indicated in an April 2009 press release that he would not.

In 2010 Westmoreland signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.

As of February 4, 2016, Westmoreland had the most conservative ideology score of any member of the House of Representatives in the 114th Congress according to GovTrack. As of April 25, 2016, he was the second-most conservative member of the House.

===Legislation===
Westmoreland has sponsored various bills of his own, including:

====110th Congress (2007–2008)====
* H.R. 3229, a bill to mint 350,000 $1 infantry coins for sale during 2012, with a surcharge of $10 on the sale of such coins, and with revenue to be allocated to the National Infantry Museum, introduced July 30, 2007, signed into law October 8, 2008.
* H.R. 3492, a bill to increase the allowable amount of campaign contributions to political action committees (PACs), introduced September 6, 2007.

====112th Congress (2011–2012)====
* H.R. 5710, a bill to establish a total daily energy consumption standard for medium temperature commercial refrigerators, introduced May 10, 2012.

====113th Congress (2013–2014)====
* H.R. 3985, a bill to prohibit health insurers from making required payments under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) for transitional reinsurance in the individual health insurance market, and to repeal the PPACA&#x27;s risk corridors and risk adjustments for insurance companies, introduced February 3, 2014.
* H.R. 4604, a bill to allow for consumers to opt out of having personally identifiable information collected by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and to set a 60-day time limit on how long the CFPB can store such information, introduced May 7, 2014.

===Committee assignments===
* Committee on Financial Services
** Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit
** Subcommittee on Insurance, Housing and Community Opportunity
* Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
* House Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi
* Republican Study Committee
* Tea Party Caucus

==Controversy==
On September 4, 2008, Westmoreland described Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama and his wife Michelle as &quot;&quot;, a term historically used to describe Americans who have made economic, social, or political progress. Westmoreland said to reporters, &quot;Just from what little I&#x27;ve seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they&#x27;re a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they&#x27;re uppity.&quot; When asked to confirm his use of the word, Westmoreland answered, &quot;Uppity, yeah.&quot;

The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: &quot;I&#x27;ve never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of &#x27;uppity&#x27; is &#x27;affecting an air of inflated self-esteem—snobbish.&#x27; That&#x27;s what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up.&quot;

During the national debate in 2015 over the future of the Confederate flag some Republicans proposed a moderate amendment to allow Confederate symbols at national cemeteries. Representative Lynn Westmoreland distinguished between racism and a memorial,

When Westmoreland was asked if he understood Representative John Lewis&#x27; perspective, he responded, &quot;I guess the question is, &#x27;Does he understand where I&#x27;m coming from?&#x27;&quot;

==Political campaigns==

Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland&#x27;s primary victory was tantamount to election in November. He routed his Democratic opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. The district was renumbered as the 3rd in 2006 and made even more Republican than its predecessor. Westmoreland was reelected five more times from this district with no substantive opposition.

== Later career ==
Westmoreland is an appointed member of the Office of Congressional Ethics, a nonpartisan, independent committee charged with overseeing outside ethics complaints against members of Congress.

==Personal life==
He resides in Grantville, Georgia, with his wife, Joan; they have three children and nine grandchildren. His daughter, Marcy Sakrison, ran unsuccessfully in the 2019 special election for a seat in the Georgia House of Representatives.

<doc id="1164051" wikidata="Q172923" url="?curid=1164051" title="Capra (genus)">
<text>Capra is a genus of mammals, the goats, comprising ten species, including the markhor and several species known as ibexes. The domestic goat (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;) is a domesticated species derived from the bezoar ibex (&quot;Capra aegagrus aegagrus&quot;). It is one of the oldest domesticated species of animal—according to archaeological evidence its earliest domestication occurred in Iran at 10,000 calibrated calendar years ago.

Wild goats are animals of mountain habitats. They are very agile and hardy, able to climb on bare rock and survive on sparse vegetation. They can be distinguished from the genus &quot;Ovis&quot;, which includes sheep, by the presence of scent glands close to the feet, in the groin, and in front of the eyes, and the absence of other facial glands, and by the presence of a beard in some specimens, and of hairless calluses on the knees of the forelegs.

==Taxonomy==

All members of the genus &quot;Capra&quot; are bovids (members of the family Bovidae), and more specifically caprines (subfamily Caprinae). As such they are ruminants, meaning they chew the cud, and have four-chambered stomachs which play a vital role in digesting, regurgitating, and redigesting their food.

The genus has sometimes been taken to include &quot;Ovis&quot; (sheep) and &quot;Ammotragus&quot; (Barbary sheep), but these are usually regarded as distinct genera, leaving &quot;Capra&quot; for ibexes. In this smaller genus, some authors have recognized only two species, the markhor on one side and all other forms included in one species on the other side. Today, nine wild species are usually accepted to which is added the domestic goat:
* West Asian ibex also known as the wild goat (&quot;Capra aegagrus&quot;)
** Bezoar ibex (&quot;Capra aegagrus aegagrus&quot;)
**Sindh ibex (&quot;Capra aegagrus blythi&quot;)
*Domestic goat (&quot;Capra hircus&quot;; includes feral goat; sometimes considered a subspecies of &quot;C. aegagrus&quot;)
*Asian ibex also known as the Siberian ibex (&quot;Capra sibirica&quot;)
*Markhor (&quot;Capra falconeri&quot;)
*West Caucasian tur (&quot;Capra caucasica&quot;)
* East Caucasian tur (&quot;Capra cylindricornis&quot;)
* Alpine ibex (&quot;Capra ibex&quot;)
* Iberian ibex also known as the Spanish ibex (&quot;Capra pyrenaica&quot;)
* Nubian ibex (&quot;Capra nubiana&quot;)
* Walia ibex (&quot;Capra walie&quot;)

The goats of the genus &quot;Capra&quot; have complex systematic relationships, which are still not completely resolved. Recent studies based on mitochondrial DNA suggest that the Asian ibex and the Nubian ibex represent distinct species, which are not very closely related to the physically similar Alpine ibex. The Alpine ibex forms a group with the Iberian ibex. The West Caucasian tur appears to be more closely related to the wild goat than to the East Caucasian tur. The markhor is relatively little separated from other forms—previously it had been considered to be a separate branch of the genus.

Almost all wild goat species are allopatric (geographically separated)—the only geographical overlaps are the wild goat (&quot;Capra aegagrus&quot;) with the East Caucasian tur (&quot;Capra cylindricornis&quot;), and the markhor (&quot;Capra falconeri&quot;) with the Asian ibex (&quot;Capra sibirica&quot;). In both cases, the overlapping species do not usually interbreed in the wild, but in captivity, all &quot;Capra&quot; species can interbreed, producing fertile offspring.

==Species and subspecies==







==Domestication and uses==
Along with sheep, goats were among the first domesticated animals. The domestication process started at least 10,000 years ago in what is now northern Iran. Easy human access to goat hair, meat, and milk were the primary motivations. Goat skins were popularly used until the Middle Ages for water and wine bottles when traveling and camping, and in certain regions as parchment for writing.

<text>Linda Gaboriau ( Johnson) is a Canadian dramaturg and literary translator who has translated some 125 plays and novels by Quebec writers, including many of the Quebec plays best known to English-speaking audiences.

== Background ==
A native of Boston, she moved to Montreal in 1963 to pursue her studies at McGill University where she obtained a B.A. and M.A. in French language and literature. While a student, she was briefly married to a man whose surname was Gaboriau; although the marriage was short-lived, she kept his surname as her professional pen name.

She has worked as a freelance journalist for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), Radio Canada and the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot;, pursued a career in Canadian and Quebec theatre and, in the 2000s, served as the founding director of the Banff International Literary Translation Centre.

== Work ==
Her translations have garnered many awards, including three Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Awards for Michel Marc Bouchard&#x27;s &quot;Lilies (Les Feluettes)&quot; in 1992, Normand Chaurette&#x27;s &quot;The Queens (Les Reines)&quot; in 1993 and Bouchard&#x27;s &quot;The Orphan Muses (Les Muses orphelines)&quot; in 1999; the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding New Play in 1991 for &quot;Lilies&quot; and in 2000 for Michel Tremblay&#x27;s &quot;For the Pleasure of Seeing Her Again (Encore une fois si vous permettez)&quot;; three Governor General&#x27;s Awards for French to English translation in 1996 for Daniel Danis&#x27;s &quot;Stone and Ashes (Cendres de cailloux)&quot;, in 2010 for Wajdi Mouawad&#x27;s &quot;Forests (Forêts)&quot; and in 2019 for Mouawad&#x27;s &quot;Birds of a Kind (Tous des oiseaux)&quot;; and the 2014 Lambda Literary Award for Drama for Bouchard&#x27;s &quot;Tom at the Farm (Tom à la ferme)&quot;.

She was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2015 and Officer of the Ordre National du Québec in 2023.

== Personal life ==

Gaboriau was previously married to Montreal city councillor Nick Auf der Maur, and is the mother of rock musician Melissa Auf der Maur. She and her late partner of 35 years, author and professor Hervé de Fontenay, have one son, architect Yves de Fontenay.

<doc id="1164057" wikidata="Q878866" url="?curid=1164057" title="Bit plane">
<text>A bit plane of a digital discrete signal (such as image or sound) is a set of bits corresponding to a given bit position in each of the binary numbers representing the signal.

For example, for 16-bit data representation there are 16 bit planes: the first bit plane contains the set of the most significant bit, and the 16th contains the least significant bit.

It is possible to see that the first bit plane gives the roughest but the most critical approximation of values of a medium, and the higher the number of the bit plane, the less is its contribution to the final stage. Thus, adding a bit plane gives a better approximation.

If a bit on the nth bit plane on an m-bit dataset is set to 1, it contributes a value of 2m−n, otherwise it contributes nothing. Therefore, bit planes can contribute half of the value of the previous bit plane. For example, in the 8-bit value 10110101 (181 in decimal) the bit planes work as follows:

Bit plane is sometimes used as synonymous to Bitmap; however, technically the former refers to the location of the data in memory and the latter to the data itself.

One aspect of using bit-planes is determining whether a bit-plane is random noise or contains significant information.

One method for calculating this is to compare each pixel to three adjacent pixels , and . If the pixel is the same as at least two of the three adjacent pixels, it is not noise. A noisy bit-plane will have 49% to 51% pixels that are noise.

== Applications ==

=== Media file formats ===
As an example, in PCM sound encoding the first bit in the sample denotes the sign of the function, or in other words defines the half of the whole amplitude values range, and the last bit defines the precise value. Replacement of more significant bits result in more distortion than replacement of less significant bits. In lossy media compression that uses bit-planes it gives more freedom to encode less significant bit-planes and it is more critical to preserve the more significant ones.

As illustrated in the image above, the early bitplanes, particularly the first, may have constant runs of bits, and thus can be efficiently encoded by run-length encoding. This is done (in the transform domain) in the Progressive Graphics File image format, for instance.

=== Bitmap displays ===
Some computers displayed graphics in bit-plane format, most notably PC with EGA graphics card, the Amiga and Atari ST, contrasting with the more common packed format. This allowed certain classes of image manipulation to be performed using bitwise operations (especially by a blitter chip), and parallax scrolling effects.

=== Video motion estimation ===

Some motion estimation algorithms can be performed using bit planes (e.g. after the application of a filter to turn salient edge features into binary values). This can sometimes provide a good enough approximation for correlation operations with minimal computational cost. This relies on an observation that the spatial information is more significant than the actual values. Convolutions may be reduced to bit shift and popcount operations, or performed in dedicated hardware.

=== Neural networks ===

Bitplane formats may be used for passing images to Spiking neural networks, or low precision approximations to neural networks/convolutional neural networks.

== Programs ==
Many image processing packages can split an image into bit-planes. Open source tools such as Pamarith from Netpbm and Convert from ImageMagick can be used to generate bit-planes.

<text>The Cimicidae are a family of small parasitic bugs that feed exclusively on the blood of warm-blooded animals. They are called cimicids or, loosely, bed bugs, though the latter term properly refers to the most well-known member of the family, &quot;Cimex lectularius&quot;, the common bed bug, and its tropical relation &quot;Cimex hemipterus&quot;. The family contains over 100 species. Cimicids appeared in the fossil record in the Cretaceous period. When bats evolved in the Eocene, Cimicids switched hosts and now feed mainly on bats or birds. Members of the group have colonised humans on three occasions.

Cimicids usually feed on their host&#x27;s blood every three to seven days, crawling away from the host and hiding while they digest the blood, which may take several days. This means that they specialise in vertebrate hosts that return regularly to particular sites to nest, roost or sleep. Birds and bats suit these specific requirements, as do humans now that they live in dwellings, and these are the main hosts used by the bugs. Most cimicids are able to go for long periods without feeding, over a year in some instances.
Cimicids are typically small, oval, flattened, wingless insects. They are stimulated to appear from their hiding places by cues such as a slight rise in the temperature of their surroundings. Among the family&#x27;s distinctive characteristics are traumatic insemination, in which the male fertilises the eggs by piercing the female&#x27;s abdominal wall with his intromittent organ. They also have distinctive paired structures called mycetomes inside their bodies, in which they harbour bacterial symbionts: these may help them to obtain nutrients they cannot get from blood. Although the insects may acquire viruses and other pathogens while feeding, these do not normally replicate inside the insect, and the infections are not transmitted to new hosts.

==Biology==
All cimicids are small, oval-shaped, and flat in appearance, although their bodies bulge after feeding. They do not fly, but have small, non-functional wing pads. They have beak-like mouthparts with which they pierce the skin and suck the blood of their hosts. They are often considered to be ectoparasites because, although they move away from the host after feeding, they remain within the confines of their host&#x27;s roost, nest or dwelling; however, under a different definition, they may be considered to be micropredatory bloodsuckers.

Reproduction in cimicids involves traumatic insemination; although the female has a normal genital tract for laying eggs, the male never uses it (except in the species &quot;Primicimex cavernis&quot;), instead piercing the female&#x27;s abdominal wall with his intromittent organ and injecting sperm into the spermalege, a storage structure; the sperm then migrate through the female&#x27;s paragenital system to reach the eggs. This practice may have evolved as males competed with each other to place their sperm closer and closer to the ovaries; the last inseminating male sires more offspring than his predecessors. Males will mount any recently-fed bug, regardless of sex, and start probing its abdomen in the region of the spermalege, thus receiving tactile, morphological and behavioral cues revealing the sex of the mounted bug. Females occasionally die from a ruptured gut after insemination; insemination via the female reproductive tract does not normally occur, except under restrictive laboratory conditions. The females&#x27; spermalege contain immune cells that seem to reduce the risk of infection from traumatic insemination.

Feeding is required for egg production in females and probably for sperm production in males. Egg-laying behavior varies among species. &quot;C. lectularius&quot; stops laying fertile eggs about 35 to 50 days after the last insemination. The American cliff swallow bug, &quot;Oeciacus vicarius&quot;, hibernates after mating in autumn and begins laying in spring, to coincide with the return of their migratory hosts.

The five nymphal instars (stages) must each take a blood meal to develop to the next stage. An undisturbed bug may take 3–15 minutes to ingest a full meal depending on its life stage. They can survive long periods of time without feeding, reappearing from their hiding places when hosts again become available. Adult bedbugs have been reported to live three to twelve months in an untreated household situation.

In a laboratory attempt to crossbreed a female &quot;C. lectularius&quot; with &quot;C. hemipterus&quot; males, one nymph hatched out of 479 eggs laid. It possessed features of both species, suggesting it was a hybrid instead of a product of parthenogenesis.

==Behavior==
Cimicids are attracted to hosts by a variety of cues, including heat (even a temperature difference of 1 °C) and kairomones. Host cues (at least in some species, including &quot;C. lectularius&quot; and &quot;Stricticimex antennatus&quot;) change from attractants to repellants after a cimicid has fed, causing it to move out of a danger zone after feeding.

Most cimicids feed once every three to seven days in natural conditions. &quot;C. lectularius&quot; normally feeds once every seven days and &quot;Ornithocoris toledoi&quot; every eight days, though &quot;C. hemipterus&quot; has been observed feeding every day for several days (in hot climates). Excessively hot or cold temperatures disrupt normal behavior. All cimicids harbour bacterial symbionts in paired structures known as &quot;mycetomes&quot;. Although the significance of these has not been fully studied, they may be concerned with the biosynthesis of nutrients that the insect cannot synthesize itself, as is the case in other blood-sucking insects.

Many cimicids can go without food for long periods, one and a half years in some instances. This allows them to survive the winter at summer bat roosts even when the bats are hibernating elsewhere, and may be an important adaptive trait because of their limited dispersal ability. Cimicids have occasionally been observed clinging to the fore limbs of bats away from the roost, and this is likely to be the means by which the insects disperse. The cimicids have no special adaptations to enable them to travel in this way, however the only two members of the Primicimicinae subfamily, &quot;Bucimex chilensis&quot; and &quot;Primicimex cavernis&quot; have claws and an erect a row of peg-like spines on the tarsus, and have been observed clinging to the bat&#x27;s pelage with these.

==Hosts==

Cimicids are a specialised group of blood-sucking parasites that primarily feed on bats, birds and humans. They are thought to have evolved from predatory heteropteran ancestors, with about 60% of extant species using bats as their primary hosts. Bats are social mammals and many species congregate in communal roosts to give birth and rear their young. These roosts provide excellent conditions for their arthropod ectoparasites, with a steady temperature and opportunities for regular blood meals. However, the bats frequently groom themselves and each other, putting the parasites at risk of being eaten. Cimicids lessen this risk by hiding in concealed locations between feeding bouts, and by producing a repellent substance which makes them distasteful.

In evolutionary terms, most species of cimicid probably specialised on insectivorous bats or birds, with the possibility of dispersal to other sites via their winged hosts. On returning to a roost, a bat may only be available to cimicids for a short time before it cools down and enters a state of torpor, with reduced blood flow. When the bats lived in close proximity to humans, in caves or in the roofs of their huts, a new opportunity arose; the cimicids could make use of the large size and homeothermic properties of a human, which provided an abundant food supply that led to the growth and expansion of the ectoparasite populations.

Cimicids are relatively specialized in their choice of hosts, compared to other bloodsucking insects. Most cimicids have a preferred host, but accept some others when presented with the choice, such as &quot;C. lectularius&quot; and &quot;C. hemipterus&quot;, which are most often found among humans, but can also survive by feeding on birds, bats, rabbits, and mice. The subfamilies Primicimicinae and Latrocimicinae use New World bats as their hosts, while Afrocimicinae and Cacodminae use Old World bats. Bats represent a convenient mammal to exploit as they roost communally, returning to the same roost regularly. It is perhaps to avoid the parasites that some species of bat regularly change roosts. The subfamily Haematosiphoninae use birds in the swift and swallow families, Apodidae and Hirundinidae. One species, &quot;P. cavernis&quot;, has a very limited distribution and appears to make use of only one species of host.

Host switching is dependent on several factors, including overlap in host detection cues and ability to digest different kinds of blood. For example, the red blood cells of chickens are about 3 to 5 μm longer in diameter than those of humans, making human blood more suitable for the narrow food canal of &quot;C. lectularius&quot;. &quot;C. hemipterus&quot; may be able to vary the size of its food canal, allowing it greater flexibility in its choice of hosts. Preference for a host species can vary between populations of a given species; the causes for this are unclear.

==Effects on hosts==
The effects of cimicid feeding on the host include causing an immune response that results in discomfort, the transmission of pathogens, secondary infections at the wound site, physiological changes such as iron deficiency, and reduced fitness (slow growth, small size, or lack of reproductive success). Hosts can defend themselves against attack by choosing non-infected sites and by grooming, while cimicids can maximise their success by reducing feeding time, selecting feeding sites which are out of reach of the hosts grooming activities, choosing to feed at times when the host is inactive, and removing themselves to a safer environment promptly when satiated.

Although viruses and other pathogens can be acquired by cimicids, they rarely transmit them to their hosts. &quot;O. vicarius&quot; is a vector of several arboviruses, but is not killed by these viruses. &quot;Trypanosoma cruzi&quot;, the trypanosome that causes Chagas disease, is rarely transmitted from cimicids to bats, but it has not been observed replicating after such transmission. The viruses HIV and hepatitis B can persist in &quot;C. lectularius&quot; for two weeks, but with no viral replication. The possibility of these and most other viruses being transmitted from &quot;C. lectularius&quot; to humans is considered extremely remote.

==Evolution==

Polyctenidae and Cimicidae are considered to be sister taxa, the former family also being flightless and specialized to feed on the blood of bats.

A fossil bedbug, &quot;Quasicimex eilapinastes&quot;, was identified in 2008 from Late Cretaceous Burmese amber, aged 99 million years ago (mya).

Molecular analysis of five mitochondrial and nuclear genes shows that the Cimicidae, a group of over 100 species, form a clade. The Primicimicinae is sister to the clade containing all other extant species. The analysis, dated using fossils, gives an estimated date of 115 mya, in the Cretaceous, for the evolution of the first Cimicidae. When bats appeared some 50 million years later, the parasites presumably switched hosts, feeding on bats and birds from then on. The group colonised humans as hosts on three occasions. The genus &quot;Cimex&quot; is seen to be polyphyletic. An independent molecular analysis came to a similar conclusion, that bedbugs diversified and fed on other hosts long before the existence of bats, suggesting that &quot;bats were colonized several times independently, unless the evolutionary origin of bats has been grossly underestimated.&quot;

Afrocimicinae, Haematosiphoninae, Latrocimicinae were not included in the analysis.

<text>Viminaria juncea is the single species in the genus Viminaria endemic to Australia. The genus is in the pea family Fabaceae. It is colloquially known as native broom after its resemblance to the related European broom plants. The Noongar peoples know the plant as koweda.

==Taxonomy==
Originally described in 1795 by Schrader as &quot;Sophora juncea&quot;, it was given its current binomial name by Hoffmannsegg in 1824. The genus name is derived from the Latin &quot;vimineus&quot; &quot;switch&quot;, and the species name from Latin &quot;juncus&quot; &quot;rush&quot;, hence &quot;rush-like&quot;. Alternate names include golden spray, native broom and swishbush.

==Description==
Native broom grows as an erect or weeping shrub high and wide. It has a smooth trunk and ascending branches while the minor branchlets often droop. The long and thin leaves are essentially petioles and measure in length. 

Flowering occurs from September to January, the flowers growing on racemes to about in length. Measuring in diameter, they are yellow with an orange corolla and are typically pea-shaped. They are followed by small pods containing single seeds.

==Distribution==
The preferred habitat is swampy areas near the coast across southern Australia, from the vicinity of Geraldton in Western Australia southwards to Esperance, and in the east in coastal Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.

==Cultivation==
Native broom is a fast-growing plant in the garden, but can lose vigor once about 5 or 10 years old. It prefers an acidic to neutral soil with ample moisture and is hardy to temperatures of −4 °C. Plants grown from seed are sturdier than cutting-grown specimens.

<text>Sherin Shringar, known by her stage name Sherin or Shirin is an Indian actress, who has appeared in Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam and Telugu-language films. After making her debut in Kannada films, her notable films include &quot;Thulluvadho Ilamai&quot; (2002), and &quot;Whistle&quot; (2003). In 2019, Sherin participated in &quot;Bigg Boss 3&quot; and emerged as the 3rd runner up.

==Career==
Shringar made her debut as an actress in Kannada films through &quot;Police Dog&quot; (2002) before playing a lead role in &quot;Dhruva&quot; (2002), in which she starred alongside Darshan.

Sherin won critical acclaim and box office success through her debut Tamil film, Kasthuri Raja&#x27;s coming-of-age drama &quot;Thulluvadho Ilamai&quot; (2002). Starring opposite Dhanush in his acting debut, the film garnered publicity prior to release for its music by Yuvan Shankar Raja and its adult story written by Selvaraghavan. It subsequently became a commercial success at the box office, effectively launching the careers of Sherin and Dhanush. The actress won the Cinema Express Award for Most Popular Actress for her performance, while she later went on to star in the Telugu remake titled &quot;Juniors&quot; (2003). Sherin then appeared in supporting roles alongside senior actresses Ramya Krishnan in &quot;Jaya&quot; (2002) and Simran in &quot;Kovilpatti Veeralakshmi&quot; (2003), and also garnered attention for her negative role in the horror film &quot;Whistle&quot; (2003) and her role opposite debutant Sibi Sathyaraj in &quot;Student Number 1&quot; (2003). Sherin later moved on to work on Telugu and Malayalam films, appearing in Krishna Vamsi&#x27;s thriller drama &quot;Danger&quot; (2005).

In the late 2000s, Sherin&#x27;s offers as a leading actress began to decrease, and several films she had starred in were subsequently delayed or shelved. A return to Kannada films with &quot;Bhoopathi&quot; and the Tamil action drama &quot;Urchagam&quot; (2007), both fared badly at the box office. A six-film contract with SPR Productions did not materialise as expected, while &quot;Cash and Maya&quot; with Shaam and the S. J. Surya-starrer &quot;Vil&quot; were dropped midway through production. She notably appeared in an item song in Linguswamy&#x27;s &quot;Bheema&quot; (2008) alongside Vikram and in R. Ananth Raju&#x27;s &quot;Mast Maja Maadi&quot; (2008) alongside Upendra and eleven other actresses. She portrayed a role with negative shades in the Kannada film &quot;Yogi&quot; (2009). Other films including the Kannada film &quot;Sihigali&quot; and the Tamil film &quot;Poova Thalaiya&quot;, had delayed low-key releases in 2010. Sherin subsequently chose to take a career sabbatical in the late 2000s, and briefly took up a course in Art and Culture in Sydney.

She made a return to Kannada films through Om Prakash Rao&#x27;s &quot;AK 56&quot; (2012) alongside Siddhanth, which garnered a good commercial response. Her next release, the comedy drama &quot;Nanbenda&quot; (2015), saw her appear in a supporting role, where she was paired opposite comedian Santhanam. In 2019, she took part as a contestant in the Tamil reality television show, &quot;Bigg Boss Tamil 3&quot;.

<doc id="1164072" wikidata="Q50104" url="?curid=1164072" title="Debbie Wasserman Schultz">
<text>Deborah Wasserman Schultz ( Wasserman; ; born September 27, 1966) is an American politician serving as the U.S. representative for , first elected to Congress in 2004. A member of the Democratic Party, she is a former chair of the Democratic National Committee.

Wasserman Schultz served in the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate and was a national co-chair of Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2008 campaign for president. Her district covers much of southern Broward County, including a large part of Fort Lauderdale.

Wasserman Schultz was elected chair of the Democratic National Committee in May 2011, replacing Tim Kaine. On July 28, 2016, she resigned from that position after WikiLeaks released leaked emails showing that she and other members of the DNC staff had expressed bias in preference of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic primaries. The emails showed that some DNC officials had discussed strategies to weaken Sanders’ campaign, questioning his viability, and even suggesting ways to discredit his supporters. She secured a senior surrogate spot on the Clinton campaign afterwards.

==Personal life and education==
Born in Forest Hills, Queens, New York, to a Jewish family, she is the daughter of Ann and Larry Wasserman. Her father is a Certified Public Accountant, and her brother, Steven Wasserman, is an Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.

From 1968 to 1978, the family lived in Lido Beach on Long Island. In 1978, her family moved to Melville, also on Long Island, where she graduated from Half Hollow Hills High School East in 1984. She received a Bachelor of Arts in 1988 and a Master of Arts with a certificate in political campaigning in 1990, both in political science, from the University of Florida.

At the University of Florida, Wasserman Schultz was active in student government, serving as president of the Student Senate and the founder and president of the Rawlings Area Council Government. She was also a member of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society, the James C. Grimm chapter of the National Residence Hall Honorary, and the union Graduate Assistants United. She served as president of the Graduate Student Council and vice president of the UF College Democrats. She has credited her experience in student politics with developing her &quot;love for politics and the political process.&quot;

Wasserman Schultz lives in Weston, near Fort Lauderdale. She is married to Steve Schultz; they have three children. She is an active member of the National Jewish Democratic Council, Planned Parenthood, and Hadassah.

In March 2009, she revealed that she had undergone seven surgeries related to breast cancer in 2008 while maintaining her responsibilities as a member of the House. That year, she promoted efforts for early screening for breast cancer.

==Career==

===Florida state legislature===

In 1988, Wasserman Schultz became an aide to Peter Deutsch at the beginning of his state legislative career. In 1992, Deutsch successfully ran for United States Representative of Florida&#x27;s 20th congressional district, and suggested to Wasserman Schultz that she run for his vacated seat in the Florida House of Representatives. Wasserman Schultz won 53% of the vote in a six-way Democratic primary, avoiding a runoff, and won the general election. At 26, she became the youngest female legislator in the state&#x27;s history.

She served four terms in the Florida State House of Representatives, for eight years, leaving due to state term limits. She became an adjunct instructor of political science at Broward Community College, as well as a public policy curriculum specialist at Nova Southeastern University.

Wasserman Schultz was elected to the Florida State Senate in 2000. She supported several bills, including the Florida Residential Swimming Pool Safety Act and one creating a Children&#x27;s Services Council for Broward County. She received an award from the Save The Manatee Club for her commitment as a state senator in the 2002 legislative session to manatee protection.

Wasserman Schultz was appointed to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in her first term. During the 2006 elections, she raised over $17 million in campaign contributions for her Democratic colleagues (third-most after Nancy Pelosi and Rahm Emanuel), was chosen as Chief Deputy Whip, and was appointed to the Appropriations Committee, a plum assignment for a sophomore representative.

Wasserman Schultz chairs the committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies. Shortly after joining the Appropriations Committee, she received a waiver necessary to sit on an additional committee (Appropriations is typically an exclusive committee), and she is now a member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. Aside from her committee and leadership roles, she was a member of Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s &quot;30 Something&quot; Working Group, which consists of congressional Democrats mostly under age 40. The group concentrates on issues affecting young people, including Social Security. She joined the bipartisan Congressional Cuba Democracy Caucus. According to the &quot;Congress.org&quot; 2008 Power Rankings, she was the 24th-most powerful member of the House, the 22nd-most powerful Democratic representative, and the most powerful Florida representative.

In December 2019, Wasserman Schultz voted to impeach President Donald Trump.

==Political positions==
Wasserman Schultz is a proponent of gun control legislation and supporter of LGBT rights.

She initiated the 2007 Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act to address the safety risks posed by suction entrapment.

In 2011, Wasserman Schultz was one of the 23 co-sponsors of H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).

On April 25, 2018, 57 members of the House of Representatives, including Wasserman Schultz, condemned history-related legislation in Ukraine and Poland. They criticized Poland&#x27;s new Holocaust law, which they claimed would criminalize accusing Poles of complicity in the Holocaust, as well as Ukraine&#x27;s 2015 memory laws glorifying Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA) and its pro-Nazi leaders, such as Roman Shukhevych.

During the 117th Congress, Wasserman Schultz voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s stated position 100% of the time according to a &quot;FiveThirtyEight&quot; analysis.

===Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and payday lending===
In December 2015, Wasserman Schultz was one of 24 co-sponsors of H.R. 4018, authored by Representative Dennis A. Ross, which would delay the implementation of CFPB regulations. She was among a dozen Florida representatives who cosponsored the legislation that would delay the CFPB&#x27;s payday lending rules by two years and void a &quot;deferred presentment transaction&quot; in states with laws similar to Florida&#x27;s. She has drawn criticism for trying to delay those regulations.

===Terri Schiavo case===

The Terri Schiavo case concerned the fate of a young Florida woman who had suffered brain damage after a heart attack in 1990 and was in a coma on life support. Her husband, who was her legal guardian while engaged to another woman, and the medical team wanted to remove her feeding tube, as she was in an irreversible &quot;persistent vegetative state&quot; with no hope of improvement. Her parents opposed this decision for years, appealing to courts, Congress, and ultimately to President George W. Bush to intervene. Wasserman Schultz was one of the strongest opponents of congressional intervention, supporting the husband&#x27;s view. The feeding tube was finally removed on 18 March 2005, resulting in Schiavo&#x27;s death on 31 March.

Wasserman Schultz publicly accused Bush of hypocrisy for having signed a 1999 bill as governor of Texas that allows health care workers to remove life support for terminally ill patients if the patient or family is unable to pay the medical bills.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===
Wasserman Schultz is a supporter of Israel.

Her predecessor and mentor Peter Deutsch was &quot;among the most hawkish congressional Democrats on Middle East issues&quot;. Wasserman Schultz, who took over his seat for Florida&#x27;s 20th district, &quot;a heavily Jewish swath of Broward County&quot;, has taken a more centrist approach. In 2005 she spoke in approval of President Bush&#x27;s proposals to give financial aid to the Palestinian Authority in both the proposed supplemental and in the 2006 budgets, praising Bush&#x27;s greater &quot;engagement and involvement&quot; on the issue.

She has disputed claims that the Democratic Party is anti-Israel, arguing that the House Democratic Caucus is more supportive of the state than its &quot;far-right&quot; Republican counterparts, and questioning Republican motivations on the issue.
Wasserman Schultz supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict and criticized MSNBC&#x27;s coverage of it, saying: &quot;Clearly [MSNBC was] highlighting what Israel had done to Gaza and the plight of Palestinians. My first thought was, where is the balance? Where is the spotlight on what Jewish children in Israel go through from being victims of rocket attacks?&quot;

She has continued to defend the state&#x27;s military action in the Gaza Strip, including the ongoing Israel-Hamas war which has led to tens of thousands of Palestinian deaths. When the International Court of Justice ruled that Israel&#x27;s operations in Gaza and the West Bank constitute illegal occupation, Wasserman Schultz claimed on Twitter that the court “discriminates against Israel.” She voiced support for a two-state solution to the conflict, although Israel&#x27;s Knesset subsequently overwhelmingly rejected such a solution.

Wasserman Schultz supported President Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, saying: &quot;We must work toward a day where the entire world recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and that can be achieved through final status negotiations. I remain as committed as ever to safeguarding Israel&#x27;s future as a Jewish and democratic state, at peace with its neighbors, with Jerusalem as its undisputed capital.&quot;

In November 2023, she voted in favor of a bill that provided an additional $14.3 billion to support Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip.

===Presidential signing statements===
Wasserman Schultz supports the use of appropriations for future control of presidential signing statements as revealed during questions in a July 26, 2008, House Judiciary Committee hearing on the constitutional limits of executive power.
Support for the Iran Nuclear Deal 
In 2015, Rep. Wasserman Schultz announced her support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. This agreement has been a point of contention, with critics arguing it does not adequately prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.

===Jewish American Heritage Month===

Wasserman Schultz is Florida&#x27;s first female Jewish member of Congress.

In 2022, Wasserman Schultz convened a congressional hearing to investigate allegations that big tech media companies were not holding instances of antisemitism on their respective platforms.

She and Senator Arlen Specter were the driving forces behind the resolution that declared May Jewish American Heritage Month. The annual observance was created to recognize &quot;the accomplishments of American Jews and the important role that members of the Jewish community have played in the development of American culture&quot;. The observance is modeled after Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month and Women&#x27;s History Month. Wasserman Schultz envisioned &quot;classroom instruction, public ceremonies and broadcast announcements&quot;, saying, &quot;There&#x27;s a generation of children growing up with a fading memory of what happened during World War II or even an understanding of anyone who is Jewish or their culture and traditions. Through education comes tolerance.&quot; The bill introducing the observance passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate and was signed by President George W. Bush. Wasserman Schultz said of the proclamation, &quot;This is an historic occasion. Generations to come will have the chance to live without antisemitism through greater understanding and awareness of the significant role that American Jews have played in U.S. history. Jewish American Heritage Month is a reality because of the people gathered today in this room.&quot;

The measure was criticized by Gary Cass, executive director of the now-defunct Center for Reclaiming America for Christ, a conservative Christian organization based in Fort Lauderdale, who objected to &quot;teaching Jewish history without talk of religious practices and values&quot;, saying, &quot;We cannot seem to have an honest discussion about the Christian roots of America&quot;. He added, &quot;How much tolerance would [Wasserman Schultz] have for a Christian Heritage month?&quot; She replied that the situation is different, that &quot;Judaism is unique, because it is both a culture and a religion&quot;, and that she was not in favor of &quot;teaching any religion in public schools&quot;. Her father, Larry Wasserman, said that while she had not been particularly active in the Jewish community before entering politics, she has &quot;forged ties with Jewish groups as a lawmaker. She helped to form the National Jewish Democratic Council and served on the regional board of the American Jewish Congress.&quot;

===2008 financial crisis===
On September 29, 2008, Wasserman Schultz voted for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, and on October 3, 2008, for the revised version of that act.

===Hate crimes===
During an April 2009 House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, Representative Tom Rooney, a former active duty U.S. Army JAG Corps officer, introduced an amendment that would make attacks against military veterans a hate crime. Wasserman Schultz remarked on the amendment:

===Death of Daniel Wultz===

Wasserman Schultz became a vocal advocate for the family of Daniel Wultz, constituents of hers who were engaged in legal action against the Bank of China. They alleged it had a role in financing the terrorist attack that killed the 16-year-old from Weston, Florida, in 2006.

In August 2013, Wasserman Schultz told the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;: &quot;In South Florida, we all know too well of the tragic circumstances surrounding the cowardly terrorist attack that took Daniel Wultz&#x27;s innocent life. I have been working hand in hand with the Wultz family and the state of Israel to ensure any and all of those involved in this terrorist activity, including the Bank of China, pay for their crimes so that justice can be served.&quot;

On May 1, 2014, together with then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Wasserman Schultz hosted the Wultz family at the U.S. Capitol in a National Prayer Day event.

===Identity theft===
On February 15, 2013, Wasserman Schultz introduced the Stopping Tax Offenders and Prosecuting Identity Theft Act of 2013 (H.R. 744; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would increase the penalties on identity thieves and change the definition of identity theft to include businesses and organizations instead of just individuals.

===Marijuana===
Wasserman Schultz opposed a 2014 medical marijuana amendment in Florida that narrowly failed to receive the 60% of votes needed to amend the Constitution of Florida. She angered medical marijuana activists and major Democratic donors over this and her comparisons of medical marijuana dispensaries to &quot;pill mills&quot;, which overprescribe and overdispense painkillers to patients with dubious symptoms. After Wasserman Schultz expressed interest in running for the United States Senate in 2016, medical marijuana activists vowed to thwart her ambition. Attorney and donor John Morgan said that her position on medical marijuana &quot;disqualifies her from the [Democratic Senate] nomination... Her position denies terminally ill and chronically ill people compassion.&quot;

In response, in February 2015, Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s staff emailed Morgan, offering to change her position on medical marijuana if Morgan would stop criticizing her. Morgan declined her offer and released the emails to &quot;Politico&quot;, calling her a &quot;bully&quot;. Wasserman Schultz at first declined to comment, then denied that her office had sent the emails. Morgan responded: &quot;What Debbie leaves out in her pushback was the crystal clear message that her potential support of the new amendment [that has been proposed for the ballot in 2016] was predicated upon me withdrawing my comments to &quot;Politico&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how to view that as anything but an offer of a quid pro quo.&quot;

===Gun control===
In 2018, Wasserman Schultz co-sponsored a bill to &quot;strengthen school safety and security&quot;, which required a two-thirds vote for passage, given it was brought up under an expedited process. The House voted 407–10 to approve the bill, which would &quot;provide $50 million a year for a new federal grant program to train students, teachers and law enforcement on how to spot and report signs of gun violence&quot;. Named the STOP (Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing) School Violence Act, it would &quot;develop anonymous telephone and online systems where people could report threats of violence.&quot; At the same time, it would authorize $25 million for schools to improve and harden their security, such as installing new locks, lights, metal detectors and panic buttons.&quot; A separate spending bill would be required to provide money for the grant program.

==Political campaigns==

=== 2004 ===
In 2004, Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s mentor Peter Deutsch resigned his Congressional seat to make an unsuccessful run for the Senate seat of fellow Democrat Bob Graham. Wasserman Schultz was unopposed in the Democratic primary election held to fill Deutsch&#x27;s seat. Her Republican opponent was Margaret Hostetter, a realtor who had never held public office. The 20th is so heavily Democratic that Hostetter faced nearly impossible odds in November, but she gained notoriety for her attacks on Wasserman Schultz. For example, Hostetter&#x27;s campaign site criticized Wasserman Schultz for protesting an American flag photograph with a Christian cross on it that was on display in the workstation of a secretary in a government building. Hostetter wrote, &quot;Elect Margaret Hostetter to Congress November 2 and send the clear message that Americans respect and support... the foundational role Christianity has had in the formation of our great nation. Our rights come from God, not the state.&quot;

Wasserman Schultz won with 70.2% of the vote to Hostetter&#x27;s 29.8%.

=== 2006 ===

Wasserman Schultz was unopposed for reelection in 2006.

=== 2008 ===
In 2008 Wasserman Schultz defeated Independent Margaret Hostetter and Socialist write-in candidate Marc Luzietti.

She supported Hillary Clinton for her party&#x27;s 2008 presidential nomination, and in June 2007 was named one of Clinton&#x27;s national campaign co-chairs. Once Senator Barack Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, she endorsed him and joined Senator Ken Salazar and Representative Artur Davis to second his nomination at the 2008 Democratic National Convention.

On CBS&#x27;s &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, she called Sarah Palin unready for the Vice Presidency. &quot;She knows nothing...Quite honestly, the interview I saw and that Americans saw on Thursday and Friday was similar to when I didn&#x27;t read a book in high school and had to read the CliffsNotes and phone in my report&quot;, Wasserman Schultz said of Palin&#x27;s interview with ABC&#x27;s Charlie Gibson the previous week. &quot;She&#x27;s Cliff-noted her performance so far.&quot; Wasserman Schultz was also named a co-chair of the Democratic Party&#x27;s Red to Blue congressional campaign group. Controversy arose in March 2008 when she felt unable to campaign against South Florida Republican representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Díaz-Balart, and the now-retired Lincoln Díaz-Balart because of her good friendship with them. Wasserman Schultz and Ros-Lehtinen are both on the LGBT Equality Caucus of which Wasserman Schultz was a vice chair. Ros-Lehtinen has been the sole Republican on the 112-member caucus since 2013.

=== 2010 ===

Wasserman Schultz defeated Republican nominee Karen Harrington, Independents Stanley Blumenthal and Bob Kunst, and Florida Whig Party candidate Clayton Schock with 60.1% of the vote.

=== 2012 ===
After the 2010 census, Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s district was renumbered the 23rd and pushed further into Miami-Dade County, taking in most of Miami Beach and a portion of Miami itself. Harrington ran again. Wasserman Schultz won with 63.2% of the vote to Harrington&#x27;s 35.6%. When she was sworn in, she became the first white Democrat to represent a significant portion of Miami since 1993.

=== 2014 ===

In the general election, Wasserman Schultz defeated Republican Joe Kaufman, 62.7% to 37.3%.

=== 2016 ===

After a court-ordered redistricting in 2015, Wasserman Schultz lost much of her share of Miami-Dade County, including her portions of Miami and Miami Beach.

Economist and law professor Tim Canova challenged Wasserman Schultz in the August 30, 2016, Democratic primary. He was endorsed by Senator Bernie Sanders. Wasserman Schultz won the primary with 57% of the vote.

On August 8, 2016, in the wake of the WikiLeaks Democratic National Committee email disclosures, Canova filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) violations of regulations complaint against Wasserman Schultz, alleging &quot;interference&quot; with his campaign, contending that on her behalf &quot;the DNC paid a team of national, senior communications and political professionals significant sums of money for their consulting services and the Wasserman Schultz for Congress Campaign utilized these services free of charge.&quot; A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz said that the complaint was without merit and that it was &quot;based on stolen, cherry-picked information&quot;.

In the general election, Wasserman Schultz defeated Republican nominee Joe Kaufman with 56.7% of the vote.

=== 2018 ===

Wasserman Schultz ran unopposed in the Democratic primary and was challenged by Kaufman and Independent candidates Tim Canova and Don Endriss. She won the general election with 58.48% of the vote.

=== 2020 ===

Wasserman Schultz was challenged by Florida attorney Jen Perelman in the August 2020 Democratic primary.

On August 16, 2020, Martina Velasquez, a 16-year-old volunteer for Perelman&#x27;s campaign, filed a police report alleging that Wasserman Schultz had shoved her more than once when both were talking to voters. Velasquez declined to press charges but asked for a public apology. In the August 18 primary Perelman won 28% of the vote to Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s 72%.

==Chair of the Democratic National Committee==
On April 5, 2011, President Barack Obama chose Wasserman Schultz to succeed Tim Kaine as the 52nd chair of the Democratic National Committee. Until she assumed office, Donna Brazile served as interim DNC chair. Wasserman Schultz was confirmed at a May 4 DNC meeting in Washington, D.C.

During an appearance on &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Wasserman Schultz said, &quot;The Republicans have a plan to end Medicare as we know it. What they would do is they would take the people who are younger than 55 years old today and tell them, &#x27;You know what? You&#x27;re on your own. Go and find private health insurance in the health-care insurance market.&#x27;&quot; Four nonpartisan fact-checkers called her claim false. She then came under criticism for saying on &quot;Washington Watch with Roland Martin&quot;, &quot;You have the Republicans, who want to literally drag us all the way back to Jim Crow laws and literally—and very transparently—block access to the polls to voters who are more likely to vote for Democratic candidates than Republican candidates&quot;. The next day, she said that &quot;Jim Crow was the wrong analogy to use&quot;.

In 2012, many of Obama&#x27;s advisers questioned the move to select Wasserman Schultz as DNC chair, feeling she came across as too partisan on television. An internal focus study of the popularity of top Obama campaign surrogates ranked Wasserman Schultz at the bottom. She was ultimately reelected to Chair on January 22, 2013. In February 2015, &quot;Politico&quot;, citing unnamed sources, reported that Wasserman Schultz had lined up supporters in 2013 to portray any decision by Obama to replace her as DNC chair as &quot;anti-woman and anti-Semitic&quot;.

In 2011, she missed 62 votes of Congress, placing her 45th of 535 in missing Congressional votes.

===2016 presidential election===

Clinton&#x27;s opponents Martin O&#x27;Malley and Bernie Sanders both criticized Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s decision to schedule only six debates in the 2016 presidential primary, fewer than in previous election cycles, as well as the timing of the debates.

Ultimately, there were nine debates that both Clinton and Sanders participated in during the primaries, as well as a number of town halls.

Some of Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s actions that the news covered during the primaries were reducing the debate schedule; uninviting former DNC Vice Chair Tulsi Gabbard to the first primary debate; halting the Sanders campaign&#x27;s access to DNC databases after a staffer from his campaign attempted to exploit a security breach; defending the superdelegate system used in the Democratic primaries; rescinding a prior ban on corporate donations; and accusing Sanders supporters of violence at the Nevada Convention.

===Resignation/controversies===

After WikiLeaks published DNC emails that showed that some DNC staffers had expressed strong preference for Clinton against Sanders in the primary, Wasserman Schultz tendered her resignation as head of the DNC, to become effective as of the close of the nominating convention in Philadelphia. According to reports in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Wasserman Schultz strongly resisted suggestions she resign until a phone call from Obama persuaded her.

After a speech at the convention before the Florida delegation during which Wasserman Schultz was &quot;booed off stage&quot; by Sanders supporters, the DNC decided that she would not open the convention.

==2017 House IT staff accused==
In February 2017 &quot;Politico&quot; and &quot;BuzzFeed&quot; reported Capitol Police accused five IT staffers (who worked for more than 30 House Democrats including Wasserman Schultz) of trying to steal House computer equipment and violating House security policies.

As of February 6, 2017, &quot;Politico&quot; noted that Wasserman Schultz was one of several House members who did not terminate the suspected staffers after the criminal complaints. In July 2017, one of the accused staffers, Imran Awan, was arrested for making a false statement on a bank loan application. After his arrest, Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s office fired Awan. Wasserman Schultz later defended her decision not to fire Awan earlier, saying, &quot;I believe that I did the right thing, and I would do it again.&quot;

In 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported:
Federal prosecutors concluded an 18-month investigation into a former congressional technology staffer on Tuesday by publicly debunking allegations — promoted by conservative media and President Trump — suggesting he was a Pakistani operative who stole government secrets with cover from House Democrats. As part of an agreement with prosecutors, Imran Awan pleaded guilty to a relatively minor offense unrelated to his work on Capitol Hill: making a false statement on a bank loan application. U.S. prosecutors said they would not recommend jail time.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;:In the plea agreement, federal prosecutors debunked conspiracy theories about the case that had circulated online. They said that the government had interviewed about 40 witnesses, examined the House Democratic Caucus server and other data and devices, reviewed electronic communications and interviewed Mr. Awan on numerous occasions. They found no evidence that Mr. Awan had engaged in illegal conduct involving House computer systems.

==October 2018 mail bomb attempt==

On October 24, 2018, a pipe bomb device sent to former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, which had the wrong address, was instead delivered to the Florida office of Wasserman Schultz, whose name and address was on the return labels of all the packages. During this time, similar pipe bomb devices had been sent to various influential Democratic politicians. The packages containing the devices, as well as envelopes containing mysterious white powder, also labeled Schultz&#x27;s office in Sunrise, Florida, as the sender, but the person who sent these devices and envelopes misspelled her name as &quot;Shultz.&quot; The same day, a similar device was found at Wasserman Schultz&#x27;s office in Aventura, Florida, as well. Fingerprint DNA helped identify the suspect as Florida resident and right-wing conspiracist Cesar Sayoc, who was arrested in a parking lot, in Plantation, Florida, on October 26, 2018.

==Stock trading==
In 2022 Schultz&#x27;s stock portfolio was up 50.8%, the second-highest gain in Congress that fiscal year following Rep. Patrick Fallon. Schultz made a large portion of this gain from trading energy stocks including a $45,000 purchase of Patterson-UTI Energy. Schultz did all this while on the House Natural Resources Committee.

From December 2023 - December 2024 Schultz&#x27;s stock portfolio saw an increase of 142.3%, the second-highest gain in Congress that fiscal year. In this same span of time the S&amp;P500 saw an increase of 24.9%

<text>Griffith is an early inner-south suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.

Griffith contains the Manuka Shopping Centre, one of the earliest shopping areas built in Canberra. Noted buildings in the suburb include the Russian Embassy and St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church. Griffith, sized at approximately 3 km², is one of Canberra&#x27;s oldest suburbs, with several of its streets designed according to Walter Burley Griffin&#x27;s original designs for Canberra. The suburb has 20 parks covering nearly 12% of the total area.

==History==

Settlement of the Blandfordia 5 Precinct southwest of Manuka began in 1926 and 1927. In 1928, southern Blandfordia (named after the Christmas Bell) was renamed Griffith and northern Blandfordia became Forrest. Griffith is named after Sir Samuel Griffith, who was chosen in 1903 as the first Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and retained his position until retirement in 1919. Streets in Griffith are named after explorers.

Griffith includes several areas that are listed by the ACT Heritage Council:

*A post-colonisation Ngambri-Ngunnawal campsite is registered on Flinders Way. According to the ACT Heritage Council, &quot;the traffic island at the intersection of Hayes Crescent, Durville Crescent and Flinders Way is associated with Aboriginal use of the area prior to and following European settlement and includes one of the most recently used traditional Ngunnawal camping grounds [used in the 1940s-1950s].&quot;
*The Blandfordia 5 Precinct (bounded by Bougainville and Furneaux streets, Arthur Circle Monaro Crescent and Flinders way, but including houses north of Furneaux Street in Forrest), the first stage of which was developed on Garden City principles in 1926 and 1927 to meet the urgent need for housing for public servants for the opening of the new Parliament House in Canberra in 1927. It was planned by Sir John Sulman (and departs from Walter Burley Griffin’s intent for the area) and the planting was guided by Thomas Charles Weston.
*Griffith Oval No. 1 at the corner of Captain Cook Crescent and Austin Street, the home ground of the Eastern Suburbs Rugby Union Club, which is ringed by mature trees planted between the 1930s and the 1950s.
*The Whitley Houses at the corner of Canberra Avenue and the corner of Cunningham Street and Burke and Leichhardt streets, modernist houses designed by Cuthbert Whitley and built in 1939, considered by the ACT Heritage Council to be &quot;among the first government designed and built single-storey detached houses in the Functionalist style in Australia.&quot; The Heritage Council has permitted flats to be built behind the houses, but views of the houses from the streets have been partially preserved.
* St Paul’s Church on the corner of Canberra Avenue and Captain Cook Crescent, which the Heritage Council considers to be an excellent example of an Inter-War Gothic church with Art Deco influences. The church was designed by Sydney Architects Burcham Clamp and Son and dedicated on 6 August 1939.
*The former Petrov residence at 7 Lockyer Street, which was occupied by Vladimir Mikhaylovich Petrov and his wife, Evdokia prior to the Petrov Affair. The Heritage Council considers that &quot;the house and its grounds preserve the outward picture of suburban normality and domesticity that the Petrovs presented to 1950s Canberra, a picture that belied the important ramifications their defection had in Australia and internationally. Their defection was a defining event of the Cold War in Australia&quot;.

*The Evans Crescent Housing at 7–11 Evans Crescent, which the ACT Heritage Council considers to be an &quot;excellent example of Inter-War Functionalist Style housing which, at the time of its construction in 1940 was relatively new in Australia.&quot;
*The Canberra Services Club at 14 Manuka Circle, which the ACT Heritage Council considers to be historically significant for its association with the provision of hospitality to service personnel by Canberra volunteers during World War II. Lady Gowrie, the wife of the Governor General, played a major role in establishing it, including fund-raising. The Services Club burnt down in April 2011, but it has been decided to rebuild it.
*Manuka Swimming Pool on Manuka Circle, which was completed in 1930. The ACT Heritage Council considers it to be &quot;an important component of the body of &#x27;Federal Capital&#x27; style public buildings associated with the establishment of Canberra as the National Capital.&quot;
*Dairy Farmers Co-Operative complex at the corner of Wentworth Avenue and Mildura Street, which was completed in 1938 and 1952. It is an example of industrial architecture in the Inter-War Functionalist style, designed by Ken Oliphant.
*The Kingston/Griffith Garden City heritage precinct, sections 15, 16 and 17 of Kingston and section 22 of Griffith, bounded by Dawes, Howitt, Cunningham and Kennedy streets, Burke Crescent, Leichhardt and Cunningham streets and Canberra Avenue. The Garden City housing in the precinct is in Kingston and the section in Griffith is a sports ground.
*The former Griffith Child Welfare Centre at 30 Manuka Circle, which was opened in 1937. The Heritage Council considers it to be important as the first permanent baby health centre in the ACT.
*The Manuka Oval and Caretaker’s Cottage, which began to be developed as a sports ground in the early 1920s and began to be developed as a formal enclosed oval in March 1929. The Heritage Council considers that it is &quot;significant for its continual use as a Canberra sporting facility, retaining an array of features such as the historic tree plantings, the oval, the Caretaker&#x27;s Cottage and the later scoreboard which tell the story of its development as a popular sporting venue.&quot;

== Demography ==

At the , Griffith had a population of 5,328 people, including 1.3% Indigenous people. The major industry of Griffith&#x27;s citizens was central government administration and 41.7% of Griffith workers were professionals, 23.0% were managers and 11.6% were clerical and administrative workers. The median Griffith citizen was 38 years old, earning a mean weekly gross personal income of approximately $1,572 per week, compared to the ACT mean of $1,203 and the Australian mean of $805.

66.9% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.2%. 76.6% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion (48.4%) and Catholic (17.8%).

== Politics ==

Griffith is located within the federal electorate of Canberra, which is currently represented by Alicia Payne in the House of Representatives. In the ACT Legislative Assembly, Griffith is part of the electorate of Kurrajong, which elects five members on the basis of proportional representation, currently two Labor, one Green, one Liberal and one Independent.

==Geology==

Rocks in Griffith are from the Silurian age. Mount Painter Volcanics dark grey to green grey dacitic tuff is found to the south west of the Deakin Fault. Canberra Formation, calcareous shale is in the north east of the Deakin Fault. The Deakin Fault is named after the suburb, and in the suburb runs from Canberra Avenue at Manuka to Frome Street. The Deakin fault is an important fault running in the north west direction across most of Canberra.

== Education ==
Griffith residents get preference for:
*Depending on the address, Forrest Primary or Red Hill Primary
*Telopea Park School (for high school)
*Narrabundah College

Griffith is home to Canberra&#x27;s first private Catholic boys school, St Edmund&#x27;s College, a Christian Brothers school opened in 1954. There are 5 other schools located in the suburb.

The Russian Embassy School in Canberra, a Russian primary school operated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, is located on the grounds of the Embassy of Russia in Canberra in Griffith. It provides a free education to Russian diplomat families and accepts other children on a tuition basis.

== Notable places ==

The Canberra South Bowling Club on the corner of Austin and La Perouse Streets was designed by the architect Harry Seidler and completed in 1959 and demolished in 2014 to make way for high density apartments.

<text>Captain Sir Charles Hotham (14 January 180631 December 1855) was Lieutenant-Governor and, later, Governor of Victoria, Australia from 22 June 1854 to 10 November 1855.

==Early life==

Hotham was born at Dennington, Suffolk, England. His father was Rev. Frederick Hotham, prebendary of Rochester, and his mother was Anne Elizabeth (née Hodges). Hotham entered the navy on 6 November 1818, and had a distinguished career. He was in command of the steam sloop which ran aground in Montevideo Bay in May 1844 and showed skill and determination in getting her refloated by November.

One of the lieutenants on board was the future Admiral Sir Astley Cooper Key. Hotham&#x27;s last active service was as a commodore on the coast of Africa in 1846 on HMS Devastation. In 1846 he was knighted. In April 1852 he was appointed minister plenipotentiary on a mission to some of the South American republics.

==Australia==

Hotham was appointed lieutenant-governor of Victoria on 6 December 1853 by the Duke of Newcastle. Later, Hotham was made captain general and governor-in-chief. He was received with great enthusiasm when he landed at Melbourne on 22 June 1854, and there appeared to be every prospect of his being a popular governor. Hotham found that the finances of the colony were in great disorder, there was a prospective deficiency of over £1,000,000, and a bad system had grown up of advances being made to the various departments under the title of &quot;imprests&quot;. 

Hotham wisely appointed a committee of two bankers and the auditor-general to inquire into the position, and this committee promptly advised the abolition of the &quot;imprest&quot; system. It was eventually found that under this system a sum of £280,000 could not be accounted for. His efforts at retrenchment brought Hotham much unpopularity, but on questions of finance he was always sound and great improvements in this regard were made during his short term of office.

Hotham was governor at the time of the Eureka Stockade. When Hotham became lieutenant-governor, replacing La Trobe, he enforced mining licensing laws. On 19 November 1854, he appointed a Royal Commission on goldfields problems and grievances. According to historian Geoffrey Blainey &quot;It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.&quot;

Hotham was a naval officer who had been used to strict discipline, and though he eventually realised that the arrogance of the officials who were administering the law was largely responsible for the trouble, when, on 25 November 1854, a deputation waited on him to demand the release of some diggers who had been arrested, he took the firm stand that a properly worded memorial would receive consideration, but none could be given to &quot;demands&quot;. 

The rebellion which broke out at the Eureka stockade on 3 December 1854 was quickly subdued, but the rebels arrested were all eventually acquitted. It was a time of great excitement in Melbourne, and the governor was convinced that designing men were behind the movement who hoped to bring about a state of anarchy. In these circumstances he felt that the only way of dealing with the trouble was the use of the strong hand.

The first eye witness account of the Massacre at the Eureka Stockade in December 1854 was published just a year after the event, by Raffaello Carboni. He was a principal Rebel, multilingual and better educated than most. He was in no doubt that the man most responsible for the massacre was Lieutenant-Governor Charles Hotham.

On 30 November 1854, Carboni, Father Smyth and George Black (newspaper editor), from the Central Council of the Eureka Rebels, asked Ballarat Goldfields Commissioner Rede to call off the licence hunts which had intensified on Hotham&#x27;s secret orders and which were enraging miners. Rede said that &#x27;the licence is a mere cloak to cover a democratic revolution&#x27;. Carboni wrote that Rede was &#x27;only a marionette … before us. Each of his words, each of his movements, was the vibration of the telegraph wires directed from Toorak&#x27; (p. xiii). H. V. Evatt, an esteemed legal mind of mid 20th century puts the blame for the massacre on Hotham&#x27;s deliberate duplicity (p.xvi).

Carboni left the Stockade about midnight. He wrote that at that stage there was confidence about a resolution of the matter without bloodshed, but that was only because Hotham had told the miners and police and military, different things. No one was expecting an assault from the military and police Camp. He also wrote &#x27;It was perfectly understood, and openly declared … that we meant to organise for defence, and that we had taken up arms for no other purpose&#x27;. (p. 67). And &#x27;the spies being sent from the Camp to enrol themselves amongst the insurgents, and who, report says, urged them to attack the Camp, which was repudiated by the diggers - they saying they would act upon the defensive&#x27;. (p. 132).

Carboni, with 18 others, was put on trial for his life. Hotham directed that American Rebels, some of whom were very prominent, not be prosecuted. He gave them an amnesty; but not quite all, the African American John Joseph was abandoned by Hotham and American officials. The prisoners appealed to Hotham, &#x27;There is a paragraph in our petition to the effect, that if &#x27;His Excellency had found sufficient extenuation in the conduct of American citizens&#x27;, we thought there were equally good grounds for extending similar clemency to all, irrespective of nationality …. it is a violation of the very principle enunciated by His Excellency in his report, &quot;viz&quot;.&#x27;That it is the duty of a Government to administer equal justice to all&#x27; (p. 134). There was a Royal Commission into the Massacre and Hotham wasn&#x27;t blamed, probably because Hotham&#x27;s critics were not heard. Hotham&#x27;s post was raised to a full governorship on 3 February 1855.

While Hotham relied on his legal advisers in all constitutional questions, his position was one of great difficulty.
Constitutional government had been granted but not really effected, and it was not until 28 November 1855 that the first government under William Haines was formed. In 1855, Hotham had been endeavouring to carry out the views of his finance committee, and was receiving much criticism from a section of the press. 

He was insistent that tenders for all works should be called through the Government Gazette, but not receiving support from the legislature, he ordered the stoppage of all constructional works. For some of his actions he was reprimanded by Sir William Molesworth, the secretary of state. Hotham then sent in his resignation in November 1855, and in doing so, mentioned that his health had materially suffered.

==Later life==

Hotham was conscientious, but he had little experience to help him in dealing with the exceptionally difficult problems of his period of governorship. He has been severely criticized, but his work on the finances of the colony was of great value.

Hotham, whose health was failing, caught a chill on 17 December 1855 while opening the Melbourne Gasworks. He died two weeks later on 31 December, and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery.

In December 1853, he had married Jane Sarah, daughter of Samuel Hood Lord Bridport. She survived him.

==Legacy==

Several places have been named after him, most notably:

* Mount Hotham
* the town of Hotham (now North Melbourne)
* the federal Division of Hotham
* the Sir Charles Hotham Hotels in Melbourne and Geelong
* roads including Hotham Streets in Preston, Collingwood, East Melbourne, Traralgon, Cranbourne, Hughesdale, Lake Wendouree, Lower Templestowe and Seddon; Hotham Road, Niddrie; and Hotham Avenue in Mount Macedon.

<text>The United States national rugby league team represents the United States in international rugby league competitions. The team is managed by the USA Rugby League (USARL).

The United States competed with little success in some international games during the 1950s, but did not return to consistent competition until 1987. Following the establishment of the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) in 1997, the team began to participate in more regular international competition. They reached the quarterfinals of the 2013 Rugby League World Cup. In 2014, the USARL became the national governing body for rugby league in the United States.

==History==
===Early years===
One of the earliest attempts to introduce rugby league to the United States was in 1953, when wrestling promoter, Mike Dimitro was asked to organize an American rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand.

The team, known as the American All-Stars, was given a huge schedule that included 26 matches against Australian and New Zealand sides. None of the 22 American players had played rugby league before the tour, and they presented themselves in American football-like attire early on in the tournament. The team won six games and tied two.

Their second match of the tour, a 52–25 loss to a Sydney side, drew a crowd of 65,453 at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Three days later a crowd of 32,554 at the SCG watched New South Wales defeat the Americans 62–41. After a consistent lack of competition, crowds were reasonable, but never reached the great height that the match at the SCG did.

The tour did not result in any meaningful growth for American rugby league. However, Mike Dimitro did not give up; he was able to organize two exhibitions against Australia and New Zealand in California that did not turn out to be a big success.

===1987–1999: Revival===
In an attempt boost rugby league&#x27;s popularity in America, a 1987 State of Origin series match was held in the Long Beach, California. The Blues won 30–18 in front of 12,349 at Veterans Memorial Stadium. That same year the United States played their first international game since 1954 against Canada. The also competed as the USA Patriots in the Rugby League World Sevens tournaments between 1992 and 1997.

In 1997 Super League America formed to organize a national team, establish an amateur domestic competition, and build the sport in the United States. The organization was initially established by Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation in an attempt to spread rugby league to the United States. The United States Tomahawks warmed up for the 2000 Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament with a three-match tour of New South Wales, Australia. On Friday August 11, they took on Forster XIII, drawn from Forster&#x27;s two clubs, the Hawks and the Dragons. The Americans were defeated 32–12. They also played the South Sydney Rabbitohs at the old Redfern Oval during Souths&#x27; appeal to return to the Australian NRL.

===2000–2010: Regular competition===
In 2001, as a response to the September 11 attacks, the AMNRL set up a rugby league match between local U.S. born players (USA All Stars) and AMNRL players who were born overseas (World Allies All Stars). The match was won by the USA All Stars 27–26. Proceeds from the game were donated to the Red Cross to help with cleanup operations. Since 2002, the Tomahawks have been playing regular international competition in the United States. In 2002, the United States were defeated by Russia 54–10 in front of over 5,000 spectators in Moscow.

On December 1, 2004, the Tomahawks played their first ever international game against the Australian Kangaroos, the reigning World Cup champions. The game was known as the Liberty Bell Cup and was played at Franklin Field at the University of Pennsylvania and was played on a grid iron size synthetic field (Fox Sports Australia commentators Warren Smith and former Australian captain Laurie Daley reported that the Kangaroos were not too enthused about playing on the synthetic turf). It was also played in 20 minute quarters rather than the normal 40 minute halves. The Tomahawks shocked the Australians by quickly racing to a 12-0 lead in the first quarter. A third converted try just 4 minutes into the 2nd quarter saw Americans lead by the unbelievable score of 18-0 until replacement forward Petero Civoniceva sent fullback Matthew Bowen on a 60-meter run to score under the posts with 5 minutes remaining in the first half. However, a fourth converted try saw the home side lead by the World Champions 24-6 at half time. The Americans actually led for most of the game until the Kangaroos&#x27; superior fitness saw them rally in the last quarter of the game to win 36–24. Although they lost the game, many consider this to be the American&#x27;s finest moment in international rugby league competition.

In October 2006, the U.S. were placed in a four team Atlantic World Cup qualifying pool along with South Africa, West Indies and Japan. South Africa and the West Indies withdrew from qualifying so therefore the group was reduced to a single game between the U.S. and Japan which the U.S. won 54–18. They then advanced to the Repechage Semi Final where they lost 42–10 to Samoa. Despite playing well against Samoa and coming within two games of qualifying for the World Cup, the United States were dropped from 14th down to 15th place when the new world rankings were released after the tournament.

In 2009 and 2010 the United States hosted other emerging North American teams in the Atlantic Cup.

===2011–2013: First World Cup===
In 2011, seven teams in the AMNRL domestic competition broke away to form the USA Rugby League. The AMNRL denied selection to players affiliated with USARL teams, including players who had been selected for the Tomahawks previously.

In 2012, the U.S. entered World Cup qualifying for the second time in another bid to qualify for their first World Cup in 2013. They began with a comprehensive 40–4 victory over the South Africa in Philadelphia, and followed it up with a 40–4 victory over Jamaica to qualify for the 2013 Rugby League World Cup for the first time.

The Tomahawks won a warm-up match against 4th-ranked France, defeating them 22–18 in Toulouse in the U.S. best victory to date.

In the finals, they were drawn in a group with the Cook Islands and Wales as well as an inter-group game against Scotland. They began by beating the Cook Islands 32–0 and then Wales 24–16, before losing 22–8 to Scotland, although they still ended up winning their group. As group winners, they advanced to the quarter finals to face Australia, losing 62-0 to be eliminated from the tournament.

===2014–present: USARL===
Following the World Cup, the national team was put on hiatus while the governance dispute between the AMNRL and the USARL was resolved. The team subsequently lost the right to automatic qualification for the 2017 Rugby League World Cup. In November 2014, stewardship of the national team was transferred to the USARL, and the team was rebranded from &quot;Tomahawks&quot; to &quot;Hawks&quot;. Brian McDermott was subsequently appointed head coach and his first job was to help the U.S. re-secure the World Cup qualification that they first won four years earlier. The team performed the qualification tournament, held in the United States, in December 2015. The team qualified for their second consecutive World Cup after winning both their matches.

The United States were drawn in a tough group with Fiji, Italy and Papua New Guinea. They lost their first game against Fiji 58-12, following it up with a 46-0 thumping by Italy and finally losing 64-0 in their final pool game against Papua New Guinea.

<doc id="1164088" wikidata="Q3108790" url="?curid=1164088" title="Warlock (New Mutants)">
<text>Warlock is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==
Warlock was introduced in &quot;New Mutants&quot; #18 (Aug 1984) and was created by Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz. He joined the titular superteam in issue #21, and remained a part of the cast until his death in issue #95. A young alien with a body that can assume any shape, he was commonly used for visual gags and fish-out-of-water humor. Pop culture historian James Van Hise described Warlock&#x27;s visual impact in a 1987 article: &quot;He looks somewhat like an explosion in the shape of a human body and only a couple artists, such as Art Adams, have been able to capture his essence as well as Sienkiewicz does. His unveiling on page 16 of [New Mutants] issue 21 is pretty startling and it takes a few issues for the eye to get used to scanning his image just because it&#x27;s so - alien. Truly alien.&quot;

Warlock briefly starred in his own self-titled series for nine issues from 1999 to 2000, written by Louise Simonson (who had previously been responsible for killing off the original Technarchy Warlock) and drawn by Paschalis Ferry.

==Fictional character biography==
===New Mutant===
Warlock is a Technarch, a race of mechanical organisms that survive by infecting living creatures with the &quot;techno-organic&quot; transmode virus, before draining their life energy. Unlike others of his race, Warlock possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result was dubbed a mutant in spirit; it was later discovered that he is a mutant, though he has yet to display any abilities beyond those natural to the Technarch. He is the son of the Technarch ruler who has battled the New Mutants and the X-Men. Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for much of that group&#x27;s existence, and became the best friend of his teammate Cypher (Doug Ramsey).

Because of Warlock&#x27;s compassion, he refuses to drain other sentient creatures of their &quot;lifeglow&quot;. Because of the difficulty in determining whether or not a creature is sentient, New Mutants leader Danielle Moonstar ordered him not to drain any large creatures without permission; however, Warlock often drains such creatures at his discretion when Danielle is not present.

During many adventures, Warlock would team up with Doug, keeping his teammate safe. Though the two often worked together to confront enemies, Warlock&#x27;s constant protection only served to lessen Doug&#x27;s self-esteem.

His shape-shifting abilities led him into a confrontation with the Impossible Man. This soon snowballed into an Earth-threatening incident as both entities tried to outdo each other. This only ended when Warlock showcased his ability to change color, something which the Impossible Man could not do.

Doug&#x27;s death at the hands of the Ani-Mator devastated Warlock, leading him to go so far as to steal Doug&#x27;s body. With the help of the rest of the New Mutants, he came to terms with Doug&#x27;s death (and returned his friend&#x27;s body to the rightful place). He continued to serve with the team, which led to a second trip to Asgard. Warlock and two new friends Boom Boom and Hrimhari became separated from the rest. They traveled to Asgard together. They were &quot;rescued&quot; from imprisonment by the children of Volstagg who sent them to talk with the mighty being Tiwaz. The trio eventually joined with a force to rescue the ruler of Asgard from an assassination attempt.

During the crisis known as Inferno, Warlock&#x27;s shape-shifting skills became vital in neutralizing the demonic threats.

Warlock was kidnapped from the grounds of the X-Mansion, along with his friends Rictor, Boom Boom and Wolfsbane, and ended up on the island nation of Genosha which was ruled by Cameron Hodge. Warlock was killed in an attempt by Hodge to steal his powers. The news of his death was broadcast worldwide, a public relations disaster for Genosha since the world believed Warlock to be a &quot;normal&quot; human mutant. Wolfsbane asked Boom Boom to put Warlock&#x27;s ashes on Doug&#x27;s grave.

Warlock had a distinctive way of talking during his stint in the New Mutants comics, frequently referring to himself with the personal pronoun &quot;self&quot;. Though he initially refers to teammates with their first names or normal pronouns, he later begins referring to them as &quot;friends&quot;, and eventually as &quot;selffriends&quot;. An exception is Danielle Moonstar who, likely due to leadership of the New Mutants, he calls &quot;chiefriend&quot;. Doug, after offering his own life energy to keep Warlock alive during a mission in Asgard, earned the unique honorific title of &quot;selfsoulfriend&quot;.

===Douglock===

Later, a group of humans called the Phalanx appeared. This group had been mutated into techno-organic forms via the transmode virus, which had been extracted from Warlock&#x27;s ashes. One of the Phalanx was Douglock, a lookalike of Doug Ramsey who had all of Doug&#x27;s memories. This entity gained independence with the assistance of the robotic Zero. Douglock joined the European mutant superhero team Excalibur. At that time the team was based on Muir Island, which was owned and run by Moira MacTaggert. While his team-mates were unnerved by his similarity to Doug, Douglock was eventually accepted as his own person. He acted as a tutor to Meggan and enjoyed a brief romance with teammate Wolfsbane, foster daughter to Moira. This romance would cause him to react irrationally and dangerously at times, mainly destroying valuable scientific research because he did not understand it was more important than his budding relationship with Wolfsbane.

In a bid to seize control of the UK, the covert intelligence operation, Black Air allied themselves with the London Branch of the Hellfire Club to raise an ancient demon from its crypt below London and use the ensuing chaos to their advantage. Black Air kidnapped Douglock to be used as the conduit to the crypt. However, after being lost in the time stream Captain Britain spent some time in an alternate timeline where Black Air was successful in its plans, leading to a dystopic future. Using this knowledge he and Excalibur were able to defuse the Hellfire Club, enter Black Air&#x27;s HQ, rescue Douglock, and stop the demon&#x27;s resurrection.

Douglock would continue to mishandle other aspects of Earthly life. Despite his beliefs he could handle it, Douglock became inebriated during Captain Britain&#x27;s bachelor party and passed out, and later experienced temporary memory problems as a result.

===Return as Warlock===
It was later revealed that Douglock is actually a reanimated Warlock who had been given Doug&#x27;s memories. He then reverts to the name of Warlock and begins a career as a solo adventurer. During his adventures, Warlock is joined by a young girl, Hope, who can infect others with the techno-organic virus without being affected by it herself. Hope has a pet monkey that had been physically affected by the virus also. They are later joined by a novice psychic Psimon, whose group of allies combated techno-organic threats. Early in their adventures, they confront Spider-Man, team up with Shadowcat, cause trouble for Iron Man, and fight against the villain Psycho-Man.

Warlock briefly fell under the control of the Red Skull when the Skull&#x27;s desperate use of a Cosmic Cube took him somewhere safe where he could gain power over others, this wish taking him to Warlock&#x27;s location, where he was able to force Warlock to help him take control of a SHIELD helicarrier and the agents on board. Fortunately, Nick Fury, Shadowcat, Nightcrawler and Colossus were able to infiltrate the helicarrier, and Warlock was able to use his connection to the ship to activate the currently-captive Machine Man. He attempted to stop the Skull by programming the also-captive Deathlok to kill him (unable to make Deathlok kill the Skull himself as that would go against his current programming), but Kitty delayed this long enough for Fury to destroy the Skull&#x27;s control unit, although the Skull got away with a group of independently programmed agents in a damaged Helicarrier.

Warlock later heads back to his home on Muir Island where he becomes re-acquainted with his old flame Wolfsbane and her adoptive mother, Moira MacTaggert.

An altered form of Bastion attacks the island. Hope, Psimon and Wolfsbane join Warlock&#x27;s efforts to defeat this new threat. Later, all would travel to New York and assist the Avengers in defeating Warlock&#x27;s father, the Magus.

===Nova===

When Nova (Richard Rider) was searching for a cure for his Phalanx infection, he arrived on the Technarchy homeworld Kvch. Nova finds the only living beings are Warlock and his adopted charge, Tyro. Warlock gave Tyro his non-aggressive form of the transmode virus, and is raising Tyro in hopes that he can slowly but surely change Technarch society into a more benevolent and peaceful one. He also reveals that he cannot cure Nova, let alone stop the Phalanx infection, as doing so would kill him, and he cannot give up on the Technarchy. At that same time however, Gamora and Drax appear on the homeworld, and the Phalanx virus transforms them into a Babel Spire, which summons an adult Technarch Siredam.

Warlock is forced to desperate measures: to ensure Tyro&#x27;s safety, he sends him away, using all of his lifeglow to purge from Nova the transmode virus. Warlock&#x27;s dying wish is for Nova to hold back the Siredam, coming to challenge Tyro, giving the youngling enough time to escape. However Tyro comes back, stricken by his surrogate father&#x27;s sacrifice, and gambles his life in an attempt to &quot;reprogram&quot; the Siredam&#x27;s body — and all of its Lifeglow reserves. Now in possession of a Siredam&#x27;s form and cosmic level abilities, Tyro is able to spare some of his inestimable Lifeglow reserves to resurrect Warlock. Warlock then agrees to help Nova in his battle against Ultron and the Phalanx, and as Tyro before, gambles that his mutant strain of the transmode virus could be able to disrupt the Phalanx strain, and purges Ultron out of Adam Warlock&#x27;s body, allowing for his ultimate defeat. Along with Tyro and Wraith, he stays in the former Phalanx zones to heal infected people with Tyro&#x27;s lifeglow and Wraith&#x27;s exolons.

===Return to Earth===
Warlock returns to Earth where H.A.M.M.E.R. agents launch A.I. missiles at him. He takes control of the missiles and flies to his former home at the X-Mansion. There, he finds an old photo from his New Mutants days amongst the rubble. He then goes to Doug Ramsey&#x27;s grave to find it has been dug up and his body missing.

===Necrosha===
Warlock discovers the New Mutants fighting a resurrected Doug Ramsey, who is under orders from Selene to destroy them. He intervenes and tries to speak to his self-soul-friend. Warlock detects malicious techno-organic malware present in Doug, and attempts to &quot;defragment&quot; Doug&#x27;s software. During the process, he re-awakens some of Doug&#x27;s memories from his days with the team before and up to his time of death. However, Warlock himself is infected by a Trojan-like virus and begins to lose control. Doug, still under Selene&#x27;s influence, takes advantage of Warlock&#x27;s vulnerability and decapitates Warlock. He then throws Warlock&#x27;s severed head into the nearby ocean. There, small crustaceans are drawn to the head. Once they are in range, Warlock, still alive, absorbs their life energy, and is, after some time, able to escape his watery grave.

Warlock returns to the battle only to find that resurrected members of once-deceased Hellions have arrived and have captured Doug Ramsey. The Hellions attempt to reprogram Doug by &quot;deleting&quot; the memories of his old self so that he may once again become Selene&#x27;s obedient pawn. Warlock, along with the help of other New Mutant team members, rescues Doug and defeats the Hellions.

===Second Coming===
After the return of the mutant messiah, Hope Summers, and Cable to the mainstream timeline, Bastion and his members of the Human Council attacked her tirelessly. Cyclops ordered the New Mutants to attack one of Cameron Hodge&#x27;s Right facilities, where Doug convinced Warlock to absorb Cameron Hodge and his soldiers&#x27; lifeglow to save his friends, and then to aid Cable and a group of X-Men from William Stryker and his Purifiers. The event of taking Hodge&#x27;s life deeply scarred Warlock and after the event, he purged the lifeglow he harvested from Hodge&#x27;s men and felt uncomfortable watching his team consume food, as the meaning for him had changed drastically. After the attack from Bastion, the team took a vacation and Illyana sensed that Pixie had been captured. Illyana sent Warlock to warn the X-Men. After surviving an attack in Limbo by demons and the Elder Gods, it was revealed that Illyana brought Legion back into the mainstream reality to use against the Elder Gods that General Ulysses and Project Purgatory were planning to unleash. Warlock was later asked, by Cyclops, to monitor police feeds around the world for crimes that were above the efforts of the local police, but under the radar of heroes such as the Avengers.

<text>C. W. &amp; George L. Rapp, commonly known as Rapp &amp; Rapp, was an American architectural firm famed for the design of movie palaces and other theatres. Active from 1906 to 1965 and based in Chicago, the office designed over 400 theatres, including the Chicago Theatre (1921), Bismarck Hotel and Theatre (1926) and Oriental Theater (1926) in Chicago, the Five Flags Center (1910) in Dubuque, Iowa and the Paramount Theatres in New York City (1926) and Aurora, Illinois (1931).
The named partners were brothers C. Ward Rapp (1860–1926) and George L. Rapp (1878–1941), sons of a builder and natives of Carbondale, Illinois. Their Chicago practice is not to be confused with the Trinidad, Colorado practice of their brothers Isaac H. Rapp (1854–1933) and William M. Rapp (1863–1920) or the notable Cincinnati architects George W. Rapp and Walter L. Rapp, to whom they were not related.

==Biographies and history==
Cornelius Ward Rapp was born December 26, 1860. In the 1880s he moved to Chicago, where he worked for architect Cyrus P. Thomas. In 1889, the two formed the partnership of Thomas &amp; Rapp. This was dissolved in 1895, when both opened independent offices. Rapp&#x27;s major projects over the next eleven years included Altgeld Hall (1895–96) and Wheeler Hall (1903–04) at what is now Southern Illinois University Carbondale and the Coles County Courthouse (1898–99) in Charleston. His father was superintendent of construction for both Carbondale buildings. Rapp was an independent practitioner until 1906, when he formed a partnership with his younger brother, George L. Rapp.

George Leslie Rapp was born February 16, 1878. He was educated in the School of Architecture of the University of Illinois, graduating in 1899. He then followed his brother to Chicago, where he joined the office of architect Edmund R. Krause. Of the projects completed by Krause during Rapp&#x27;s employment, the best known was the Majestic Theatre, now the CIBC Theatre. After seven years with Krause he joined his brother to form the firm of C. W. &amp; George L. Rapp, commonly known as Rapp &amp; Rapp. Following early success with the Five Flags Center in Dubuque, Iowa, the new firm quickly specialized in theatres. In 1917 they began working with the Balaban &amp; Katz chain of movie theatres, a relationship leading to the construction of many early movie palaces. In 1926 Paramount Pictures bought a controlling interest in Balaban &amp; Katz, after which the Rapp office gained a national practice. C. Ward Rapp died the same year, leaving his brother to head the firm. The firm diversified its practice away from theatres during the 1930s, and designed a variety of commercial and industrial projects. During this period Rapp was joined by Mason Gerardi Rapp, son of his elder brother William M. Rapp. After George L. Rapp&#x27;s retirement in 1938, Mason G. Rapp succeeded to the practice. After the death of his uncle in 1941 he renamed the firm Rapp &amp; Rapp, which had always been its common name. In 1965 Rapp retired, and the firm was dissolved. Mason G. Rapp died in 1978.

==Legacy==
The Rapp brothers were among a group of highly influential American theatre architects, which also included Thomas W. Lamb of New York City and John Eberson of Chicago. They were responsible for the design of some 400 theatres, most of which were built in the 1920s. They designed many movie palaces, including a number of atmospheric theatres, which utilized romantic architectural elements to evoke specific times and places. Their only surviving atmospheric theatre in Chicago is the Gateway Theatre, now the Copernicus Center, completed in 1930. If murals were to be included in the theatres, Louis Grell of Chicago was commissioned to paint them.

Many of the theatres and other buildings designed by the Rapp brothers have been listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places.

<text>John Joseph Henry Schwarz (born November 15, 1937), is an American physician and independent politician from Michigan, who was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004 as a moderate Republican. He represented Michigan&#x27;s 7th congressional district from January 2005 to January 2007.

==Early life and career==
Dr. Schwarz was born and raised in Battle Creek, Michigan, after his family moved there in 1935 so his father could work as a physician in the Veterans Administration Hospital. He has two older siblings, Frank and Janet. He attended Fremont Elementary School, W.K. Kellogg Junior High School, and graduated from Battle Creek Central High School. He played on the baseball, swimming and football teams at B.C. Central. In 1959, he received a B.A. in History from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where he played on the 1956 reserve football team as a center.

Dr. Schwarz graduated from Wayne State University Medical School in 1964 and interned at Los Angeles County Hospital before enlisting in the Navy. For five years, Dr. Schwarz served in Southeast Asia, first with the U.S. Navy in Vietnam and as an assistant naval attaché in Indonesia. He was then a member of the Defense Intelligence Agency, before serving with the Central Intelligence Agency for three years in Indonesia, Laos, and Vietnam. During his time in Indonesia, Dr. Schwarz met Suharto on several occasions and, at then-U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Marshall Green’s direction, taught Suharto basic English phrases for about six weeks. Following Indonesia, Schwarz was stationed with the CIA in Laos during the Laotian Civil War Schwarz left the CIA in 1970 to attend Harvard University, finishing his residency in otolaryngology in 1973.

He returned, with his new family, to Battle Creek in 1974, and has been a practicing physician in Battle Creek since that time. He currently sees patients at the Family Health Center in Battle Creek, a federally qualified health center. He is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons. His first wife, Anne, died in 1990, and he is divorced from his second wife. He has one daughter from his first marriage.

==Political career==
In 1984, Schwarz was elected Mayor of Battle Creek. In 1986, he was elected to the Michigan State Senate. In 2002, he ran for Governor of Michigan, but was defeated in the primary by a wide margin.

In 2006, Schwarz voted against the Federal Marriage Amendment, which would have banned every state from legally recognizing same-sex marriage. Schwarz is considered to be a moderate Republican who supports abortion rights and favors embryonic stem cell research.

==Post-congressional life==
On the state level, Schwarz was appointed to Gov. Jennifer Granholm&#x27;s Emergency Financial Advisory Panel, led by former Michigan governors Milliken (R) and Blanchard (D). On the national level, Schwarz was appointed by Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to serve on the independent panel to investigate the conditions at Walter Reed Army Hospital in suburban Washington, D.C. Schwarz was reappointed to the Altarum Institute Board of Trustees, a position he held prior to his congressional service, in February 2007. Altarum Institute is a nonprofit health policy research institute based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He also accepted a teaching position at the University of Michigan&#x27;s Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, which began in fall 2007.

In 2010, Schwarz considered running for governor of Michigan as an independent in that year&#x27;s election. However, on June 2, 2010, he announced he would not run due to fundraising issues.

, Schwarz is a member of the Michigan State Medical Society&#x27;s board of directors.

On June 16, 2014, Schwarz signed a brief in support of same-sex marriage.

From 1991 to 2005 Schwarz served as a trustee for Olivet College. Schwarz also served as campaign chair for the college&#x27;s previous capital campaign during 2007-2009 academic years for Olivet College.

<doc id="1164106" wikidata="Q3197126" url="?curid=1164106" title="Kingston, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Kingston is the oldest and one of the most densely populated suburbs of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia. The suburb is named after Charles Cameron Kingston, the former Premier of South Australia and minister in the first Australian Commonwealth Government. It is adjacent to the suburbs of Barton, Fyshwick, Griffith and Manuka. The suburb of Kingston is situated about 4 km from the centre of Canberra.

== History ==
In the early years of Canberra&#x27;s development, Eastlake occupied the area now known as Kingston. Eastlake Football and Cricket club is one of the few reminders of Kingston long past. Eastlake was designated as a workers living quarters while the suburb of Forrest was reserved for middle and higher ranking public servants. About 120 portable wooden cottages for construction workers were built at the Causeway in 1925 and 1926. Canberra&#x27;s first hall for community gatherings and entertainment was at the Causeway where the recreation hall was completed in 1926 with voluntary labour using materials provided by the Federal Capital Commission. After the second world war, housing at the Causeway and Westlake was considered sub-standard. Although all of the original Westlake cottage have been demolished, the Causeway survives with the original temporary wooden cottages now replaced with brick veneer cottages. As it was separated from the rest of the suburb by Wentworth Avenue and was situated to the north of the railway station the Causeway was a distinct district within the suburb of Kingston, however, it is now abutted by the new Kingston foreshore development.

The Causeway is on the edge of a road called the Causeway, which was planned as a dam across the Molonglo River that would back up East Lake, which was planned by Walter Burley Griffin but never built. The cottages at Causeway were designed by HM Rolland and were first erected at Westlake in 1924, then Acton and finally at the Causeway in 1925–1926. The Westlake cottages were sold off from the mid-1950s – last cottage removed in 1965. A number are now in Queanbeyan and down the South Coast. One also sits with a new coat of paint, in River Street, Oaks Estate. A photograph showing one of the cottages on the move is in Westlake One of the Vanished Suburbs of Canberra – Gugler, A. The timber cottages at the Causeway were pulled down. The cottage design, referred to as portable timber cottages, designed by Rolland were based on the cottages erected at Westlake (present site, Block 3, Section 128 Stirling Park, Yarralumla) by Contractor John Howie for his married men – built 1922. He also built nearby 18 or more timber huts for his single men, known as the Hostel Camp. The Burns Club was founded there in 1924.

=== Heritage listed areas ===

The following areas are heritage listed:
* The Kingston/Griffith Garden City heritage precinct, sections 15, 16 and 17 of Kingston and section 22 of Griffith, bounded by Dawes, Howitt, Cunningham and Kennedy streets, Burke Crescent, Leichhardt and Cunningham streets and Canberra Avenue. The first stage of the precinct was constructed in 1926 and 1927 to accommodate lower rank public servants and workmen for the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. The listed area is the only part of the original East Lake precinct that has not been redeveloped.
* The Kingston Powerhouse Historic Precinct. The powerhouse was built in 1915 and was the first permanent public building in Canberra. It was closed in 1929, but reactivated for periods between 1936 and 1942 and between 1948 and 1957. The Fitters&#x27; Workshop, the second permanent public building, is also in the precinct. The siren and whistle, which signalled times to Government outdoor workers in south Canberra for many years, is included in the listing.
* Some Arizona and Himalayan cypresses near the original government printing works completed in 1927 east of Wentworth Avenue and north of Giles Street.
* The former ACTION bus depot, which was the centre of government transport operations in Canberra from 1927 to 1992 and is particularly notable for the steel fully welded rigid portal frame that was built to support its roof in 1940 and is considered to be one of the earliest examples of this technology in the world of its size. The building has housed The Old Bus Depot Markets since 14 February 1998. A 1940s built building demolished in 2000, and a 1972 built building in 2001.
* The Causeway Hall, which was built by voluntary labour in 1925 and served for some time as the city&#x27;s principal place of entertainment, including as &quot;a picture theatre, dance hall and the venue for other entertainment such as concerts and boxing matches&quot;.
* The Canberra Baptist Church, 11 Currie Crescent, Kingston, constructed from 21 March 1928 and dedicated on 24 February 1929. It was the second permanent church built after the founding of Canberra and is considered by the ACT Heritage Council to be &quot;a fine example of the Inter-War Gothic style and its internal and external integrity add to this significance.&quot;

== Current development ==

In recent years Kingston has been largely redeveloped with medium-density housing including townhouses and units. Most of Kingston south of Wentworth Avenue is zoned for a predominant height of &quot;3 storeys, with a maximum height of 4 storeys only where it is not the dominant feature of a street frontage&quot;, although there are two high-rise blocks north of the shopping centre and the detached houses in three city blocks in the south have heritage protection.

The most recent development is the Kingston Foreshores development in which large numbers of high-value apartments are being built along the foreshores of Lake Burley Griffin. The area had previously been used for industrial purposes and is located between the Canberra railway station and the Kingston Powerhouse. These new developments and the rise of a café society have reformed Kingston as one of the most exclusive suburbs in Canberra. The Kingston Foreshores are zoned for four-story units, but six-storey units are permitted under some conditions in some areas.

Parts of the Kingston Group Centre are now zoned to be redeveloped to a height of 4 storeys (including next to Highgate Lane, which is currently a back alley) and 6 storeys (part of the parking area to the southeast and the site of the former Cusack furniture store).

== Suburb amenities ==
Kingston contains the Kingston Shopping Centre, one of the earliest shopping areas built in Canberra. The northeastern corner of the shopping centre is built around a small park called Green Square. During recent drought years and water restrictions the exotic grass died and were replaced by native grasses that were more drought resistant, but more spiky, discouraging families with children. After a long campaign by local businesses, the exotic grass was reinstituted in early 2014. Kingston is also noted for a lively nightlife and bar scene.

Other places of note in Kingston include the Kingston Powerhouse opened in 1915 and the Canberra railway station. The Old Bus Depot Markets, showing handcrafted goods and foodstuffs, are held on the lakeside every Sunday and have become a regular destination for locals and tourists. Kingston&#x27;s streets are named after Australia&#x27;s early European explorers.
== Demographics ==
At the , the population of Kingston was 6,579, including 99 (1.5%) Indigenous persons and 2,967 (66.3%) Australian-born persons. 3.0% of dwellings were separate houses (compared to the Australian average of 72.3%), while 6.4% were semi-detached, row or terrace houses (Australian average: 12.6%) and 90.5% were flats, units or apartments (Australian average: 14.2%). 45.0% of the population were professionals, compared to the Australian average of 24.0%. Notably 25.5% worked in central government administration, compared to the Australian average of 1.1% and the ACT-wide average of 17.1%. 51.8% of the population had no religion, compared to the ACT average of 43.5% and the Australian average of 38.4%.

== Major Roads ==
The major road in Kingston is Wentworth Avenue which carries traffic through the suburb from the northwest to the southeast. Telopea Park East forms the northwest boundary of Kingston. Access to the shopping precinct is via Eyre Street or Giles Street.

==Education==
Kingston residents get preference for:
*A shared Priority Enrollment Area (PEA) of Forrest Primary and Red Hill Primary
*Telopea Park School (for primary and high school)
*Narrabundah College

== Geology ==

Silurian age Canberra Formation, calcareous Shale is under this suburb, with Tertiary gravels over the top in the Causeway.

<text>Hazel Dell is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Clark County, Washington, United States, located north and west of Vancouver. As of the 2010 census the population was 19,435. Previous censuses divided the community into two areas, Hazel Dell North and Hazel Dell South.

==Toponymy and history==
Oregon Country pioneers Reese and Sarah J. Anderson were Hazel Dell&#x27;s first settlers. Sarah named the area after a stand of filberts on their land near 78th Street and Highway 99. She also donated the land for the first school in Hazel Dell, the present site of Hazel Dell Elementary School. The name &quot;Bear Gulch&quot; was briefly considered by the early Hazel Dell residents. Local business leaders once considered changing the name to &quot;Basilville&quot; in honor of enterprising merchant Basil Dhanens. With thanks, Dhanens declined the offer. He died in 1972.

Hazel Dell and Minnehaha were two of the first suburban areas to be developed after World War II and were followed by Lake Shore, Felida, and Salmon Creek. Much of the housing boom in the area has subsided due to the increase of homes being built to the east of Vancouver, between Interstate 205 and Camas and Washington State Route 500/Fourth Plain Boulevard and the Columbia River.

Until the early 1970s, it was not uncommon to see horses and dairy cattle at several points along Interstate 5 and Highway 99 in Hazel Dell. Dairy production ceased and with the exception of a few small acreage farms, Hazel Dell is home to several shopping centers.

==Geography==
Hazel Dell runs parallel to and is bisected by Interstate 5, with access from exits 4 and 5. The community is bounded by the Vancouver city limits on the south in the vicinity of Burnt Bridge Creek, Lake Shore to the west, Salmon Creek to the north, I-205/Barberton to the northeast, and Walnut Grove to the east. Vancouver Lake is a short distance to the west of the area, and the community of Minnehaha is to the southeast. According to the United States Census Bureau, the Hazel Dell CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.27%, is water.

==Arts and culture==
Every third Saturday in May since 1964, Hazel Dell has hosted the &quot;Parade of Bands&quot;. The parade route travels on Highway 99. The event was first organized and sponsored by Harvey Johnson and family who owned the former Steakburger Drive-in restaurant on Highway 99.

==Parks and recreation==
Construction of Kate and Clarence LaLonde Neighborhood Park was to begin in early July 2010.

Other parks located in the city include Hazel Dell Community Park, Jorgenson Park, and Tenny Creek Neighborhood Park, which was developed in 2007.

==Municipal services==
Law enforcement for the community of Hazel Dell is provided by the Clark County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, and the local crime rate is typical for a neighborhood of its size and population density. Fire Station 61 operates as part of Clark County Fire District 6 and provides firefighting services to Hazel Dell and neighboring communities. Hazel Dell has its own sewer district as well.

==Schools==
Three elementary schools are located in the community. Hazel Dell Elementary School is a kindergarten through 5th grade elementary school located in south Hazel Dell and is part of the Vancouver School District. The school is home to the &quot;Panthers&quot;. The current principal is Lisa Reed. Sacajawea Elementary School is a kindergarten through 5th grade elementary school located within a residential area of northwest Hazel Dell, and is part of the Vancouver School District. The school is home to the &quot;Skyhawks&quot;. Sarah J. Anderson Elementary School is a kindergarten through 5th grade elementary school located within a residential area of northeast Hazel Dell and is part of the Vancouver School District. The school is home to the &quot;Pioneers&quot;. The current principal is Katie Arkoosh.

Columbia River High School is a 9th through 12th grade high school located within the residential area of Hazel Dell. The school&#x27;s moniker was formerly known as the Chieftains but the name was changed to the Rapids in 2021.

<doc id="1164117" wikidata="Q454467" url="?curid=1164117" title="Oscar Howe">
<text>Oscar Howe (Mazuha Hokshina or &quot;Trader Boy&quot;, May 13, 1915 – October 7, 1983) was a Yanktonai Dakota artist from South Dakota, who became well known for his casein and tempera paintings. He is credited with influencing contemporary Native American art, paving the way for future artists. His art style is marked by bright color, dynamic motion and pristine lines.

==Early life and education==
Oscar Howe was born in 1915 in Joe Creek, South Dakota on the Crow Creek Sioux Reservation. His Dakota name was &quot;Mazuha Hokshina,&quot; or &quot;Trader Boy.&quot; Descended from hereditary chiefs, he belonged to the Yanktonai band of Dakota people. He attended the Pierre Indian School (a boarding school) in South Dakota in 1933.

His artistic talent was recognized when he was young, and Howe studied in Dorothy Dunn’s art program at the Studio of Santa Fe Indian School from 1933 to 1938. In 1940 Howe was sent by the South Dakota Artists Project (a division of the Works Progress Administration in the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration) to Fort Sill Indian Art Center in Lawton, Oklahoma, to study mural painting techniques with Olle Nordmark. WPA artists were being commissioned to do murals in numerous federal buildings and sometimes local public buildings as well. He attended Bacone College, where his classmates included Terry Saul, and Walter Richard “Dick” West Sr.

After working for several years and serving in World War II, Howe went to college on the GI Bill, earning his B.A. degree at Dakota Wesleyan University in 1952. Having worked as an artist for more than a decade, he also taught as Artist-in-Residence. He received his M.F.A. at the University of Oklahoma in 1954.

Howe met his future wife Heidi Hampel in Germany while serving overseas during World War II. He was discharged in 1945 and returned to the United States. After winning the Grand Purchase Prize in 1947 at the Indian Art Annual, sponsored by Philbrook Art Center, he had enough funds to send for Heidi to come to the United States, and they married. In 1948 they had a daughter, Inge Dawn, their only child.

==Art career==
Howe&#x27;s early paintings are similar to other work produced by the Santa Fe Indian School. Later he developed a distinctive style of his own. Howe began with traditional Sioux &quot;straight line&quot; painting, based on hide and later ledger paintings of the 19th century. It was &quot;an artistic form which symbolizes truth or righteousness.&quot; He infused it with the Native American art style Tohokmu (spider web). His work has been compared to Cubism, though he rejected the neo-Cubist label in favor of situating his work firmly within Dakota epistemology. Through his art, he wanted to portray the contemporary realities of his tribal culture.

During the 1930s and the Great Depression, Howe was employed by the Works Progress Administration in South Dakota. He painted a set of murals for the municipal auditorium in Mobridge and a mural within the dome of the , in Mitchell, South Dakota. Howe worked as an art instructor at Pierre High School in 1939. From 1948 to 1971, he designed panels for the Corn Palace in Mitchell.

Howe became Professor of Art at the University of South Dakota, in Vermillion, South Dakota, in 1957. He taught there until 1983.
Survey texts and articles on Native American modern art often credit Howe with influencing the development of contemporary art in the Indian community. In 1958 he was rejected from a show of Native American art at the Philbrook Museum because his work did not meet the criteria of &quot;traditional&quot; Indian style.

Howe wrote in protest,
&quot;Are we to be held back forever with one phase of Indian painting that is the most common way? Are we to be herded like a bunch of sheep, with no right for individualism, dictated to as the Indian has always been, put on reservations and treated like a child and only the White Man know what is best for him... but one could easily turn to become a social protest painter. I only hope the Art World will not be one more contributor to holding us in chains.&quot;His protest led to the acceptance of abstraction within the community.

Over his 41-year career, Oscar Howe won numerous awards, including grand and first prizes. His works were displayed all over the world, including Paris, France and London, England, with more than 50 solo shows.

==Honors==
In 1960, he was named Artist Laureate of South Dakota.

He was awarded the Waite Phillips trophy for outstanding contributions to American Indian art from the Philbrook Art Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1966. In 1970, he received the Golden Bear Award from the University of Oklahoma, Norman.

In 1973, he was the first recipient of the South Dakota Governor&#x27;s Award for Creative Achievement.

In 1971, he was appointed Lecturer to the Near East and South Asia by the United States Department of State. He presented programs during his tour in nine countries.

Two exhibition spaces are dedicated to showing his work: the Oscar Howe Art Gallery at the Dakota Discovery Museum in Mitchell, and the Oscar Howe Gallery at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion.

From April 17, 2007, to February 17, 2008, an exhibit of Oscar Howe&#x27;s work was on display at the South Dakota Art Museum in Brookings. Most of these works were done in casein paint. There were also works in graphite on paper and sculpture of stone and bronze on display.

Oscar Howe Elementary School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, is named after him.

A yearly lecture is held in his honor at the University of South Dakota.

The Oscar Howe Memorial Association at the University of South Dakota is named after him and is dedicated to promoting research and educational projects in Native American art. The Oscar Howe Memorial Association also sponsors the USD Summer Art Institute, the Oscar Howe Archive Project, the Oscar Howe Memorial Lecture and the Robert Penn Northern Plains Contemporary Indian Art Collection.

From March 11 to September 11, 2022, an exhibition of Oscar Howe&#x27;s work was on display at the George Gustav Heye Center, the New York branch of the Smithsonian Institution National Museum of the American Indian.

<text>The Homerun Range () is a northwest-trending range, long and wide, east of Everett Range at the heads of the Ebbe Glacier and Tucker Glacier in Victoria Land, Antarctica.

==Exploration and naming==

The name of the Homerun Range derives from &quot;Homerun Bluff,&quot; a field name of the southern party of the New Zealand Federated Mountain Clubs Antarctic Expedition (NZFMCAE), 1962–63, used to denote a turning point in their traverse at this range to the airlift point and return to Scott Base. 
The entire range was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos from 1960 to 1963.

==Location==
The Homerun Range is in the Admiralty Mountains, southeast of the Everett Range of the Concord Mountains.
Robinson Heights and the Findlay Range are to the north and east. 
The McGregor Range is to the southeast.
The Homerun Range runs from northwest to southeast, from Mount LeResche at the head of the Ebbe Glacier, past Mount Shelton to the point where the Rastorfer Glacier flows into the Tucker Glacier. 
The Elsner Ridge is on the east side of the Rastorfer Glacier.
A line of hills between the Homerun Range and the Mirabito Range of the Concord Mountains includes Mount Armagost and Mount Seitz.

==Features==
Features of the range and nearby features include:

===Mount LeResche===
Prominent mountain high at the extreme north end of Homerun Range. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy aerial photography, 1960-63.
Named by the United States Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Robert E. LeResche, United States ArmyRP biologist at McMurdo Station, 1966–67 and 1967-68.

===Mount Shelton===
A mountain high located just west of the upper part of Rastorfer Glacier in the east-central portion of the Homerun Range. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for John E. Shelton USARP meteorologist at Hallett Station, 1964-65.

===Elsner Ridge===
A narrow, southwest-trending ridge, or spur, long, located northeast of the south end of Homerun Range. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy, aerial photographs, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Robert W. Elsner, United States ArmyRP biologist at McMurdo Station, 1967–68, 1968–69 and 1969-70.

===Mount Armagost===
One in the series of peaks high that rise between Mirabito Range and Homerun Range. 
This peak stands southwest of Mount LeResche. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Chief Equipment Operator Harry M. Armagost, United States Navy, who wintered over at McMurdo Station in 1963 and 1967.

===Mount Seitz===
One in the series of peaks high that rise between Mirabito Range and Homerun Range. 
This peak is southeast of Mount Armagost and northwest of Boss Peak.
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Thomas E. Seitz, Chief Construction Mechanic, United States Navy, of the McMurdo Station party, 1967.

<doc id="1164126" wikidata="Q1777486" url="?curid=1164126" title="Knot group">
<text>In mathematics, a knot is an embedding of a circle into 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The knot group of a knot &quot;K&quot; is defined as the fundamental group of the knot complement of &quot;K&quot; in R3,
:formula_1

Other conventions consider knots to be embedded in the 3-sphere, in which case the knot group is the fundamental group of its complement in formula_2.

== Properties ==
Two equivalent knots have isomorphic knot groups, so the knot group is a knot invariant and can be used to distinguish between certain pairs of inequivalent knots. This is because an equivalence between two knots is a self-homeomorphism of formula_3 that is isotopic to the identity and sends the first knot onto the second. Such a homeomorphism restricts onto a homeomorphism of the complements of the knots, and this restricted homeomorphism induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups. However, it is possible for two inequivalent knots to have isomorphic knot groups (see below for an example). 

The abelianization of a knot group is always isomorphic to the infinite cyclic group Z; this follows because the abelianization agrees with the first homology group, which can be easily computed. 

The knot group (or fundamental group of an oriented link in general) can be computed in the Wirtinger presentation by a relatively simple algorithm.

==Examples==

*The unknot has knot group isomorphic to Z.
*The trefoil knot has knot group isomorphic to the braid group &quot;B&quot;3. This group has the presentation 
::formula_4 or formula_5
*A (&quot;p&quot;,&quot;q&quot;)-torus knot has knot group with presentation 
::formula_6
*The figure eight knot has knot group with presentation 
::formula_7
* The square knot and the granny knot have isomorphic knot groups, yet these two knots are not equivalent.

<doc id="1164129" wikidata="Q7369053" url="?curid=1164129" title="Roslyn Dundas">
<text>Roslyn Dundas (born 28 July 1978) is a former Australian politician. She was an Australian Democrats member of the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly from 2001 to 2004, when she was defeated in a bid for re-election. Until Kelly Vincent&#x27;s election to the South Australian Legislative Council in 2010, Dundas was the youngest woman ever elected to an Australian parliament.

Dundas was born and raised in Canberra, and studied at Australian National University. While there, she became heavily involved in both student politics and community organisations, becoming the ACT Co-ordinator of the Young Women&#x27;s Electoral Lobby in 1998. She served on the Management Committee of the Women&#x27;s Centre for Health Matters, and on the General Committee of the ACT Council of Social Service.

In 2000, Dundas became the National Secretary of the Young Australian Democrats movement, and National Convenor of the Democrat Students. In the same year, she was also secretary of the university student body, a member of the party executive in the ACT, and the founding co-convenor of the Vida Women&#x27;s Network – an attempt to form a Democrat version of EMILY&#x27;s List Australia. During the year, she also served on the Women&#x27;s Committee of the National Union of Students. In September 2000 she unsuccessfully ran for President of the Australian National University Students&#x27; Association, as the leader of a combined Democrat/Liberal election ticket.

Dundas worked as an organiser for the Community and Public Sector Union for several months in 2001, before gaining the top position on the Democrat ticket for the seat of Ginninderra in the ACT Legislative Assembly. She was subsequently elected, defeating conservative independent Dave Rugendyke. This made her the youngest woman elected to an Australian parliament, as well as the first Democrat to be elected in the ACT.

Once elected to the assembly, Dundas actively campaigned for increased government accountability, the environment, and women&#x27;s rights. She supported a bill which liberalised the ACT&#x27;s laws relating to abortion, and introduced a Private Member&#x27;s Bill supporting the use of open source software. Roslyn Dundas stood in the left wing of the party, along with the likes of Senators Natasha Stott Despoja and Brian Greig. Over the next three years, she developed a significant public profile. She also preserved Jon Stanhope&#x27;s Labor Party government by downgrading a no-confidence motion to a censure motion. However, in 2004 Dundas lost the seat to the Labor Party&#x27;s Mary Porter.

After leaving the Legislative Assembly, Dundas worked as the ACT director of Ausdance. In late 2007 she became an advisor to the ACT Children and Young People&#x27;s Commissioner. She took up the position of director of the ACT Council of Social Service in 2008. Dundas became the CEO of Ausdance in January 2013.

<text>Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS) is a tribal boarding secondary school in Santa Fe, New Mexico. It is affiliated with the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE).

==History==
The Federal Government established the Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS) to educate Native American children from tribes throughout the Southwestern United States. Although the school gives its founding date as 1890, &quot;The Santa Fe New Mexican&quot; reported an enrollment of 40 students in April 1885 and 200 students in April 1887. The school enrolled students from Laguna Pueblo, Santo Domingo Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo, and Zuni Pueblo. The purpose of creating SFIS was an attempt to assimilate the Native American children into the wider United States culture and economy. In 1975, the All Indian Pueblo Council (AIPC) was formed. It was the first Indian organization to utilize the laws in place to contract an education for their children. Eventually, the AIPC was able to leverage complete control of the school and curriculum. In 2001, with the passing of the SFIS Act, the school took ownership of the land. The school resides on the form of a trust, which is held by the nineteen Pueblo Governors of New Mexico. These acts allow for complete educational sovereignty of the school, by the Pueblo.

=== Indian boarding schools origins===
The original concept of the Indian boarding school began as a social experiment predating the Civil War. Around the 1860s, the United States federal government created day schools to educate children about Western civilization. They were ineffective in this process because the students did not retain the knowledge acquired at school. A factor in knowledge retention was the students returning home. After discovering this method of education was ineffective, a different approach was taken.

In the 1870s, the concept of Indian Boarding Schools came into fruition. Army Lt. Richard Henry Pratt was charged with overseeing seventy-two Native American prisoners who fought against the Army; he tested his version of the social experiment that was previously attempted on the children. Pratt desired to mold the &quot;savages&quot; into &quot;civilized&quot; people. Pratt taught the Native American prisoners how to speak English and educated the Native Americans on European society and religion. After this educational experience, sixty-two of the Natives went to the Hampton Institute in Virginia. Deciding to extend the experiment further, Pratt was able to convince Native American families to allow their children to attend his boarding school. 

Richard H. Pratt founded the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879; the difference being, unlike day schools, Carlisle was located over a thousand miles away from the reservation. The Carlisle Indian Industrial School was the first boarding school specifically for Native Americans. The reasoning behind positioning the school a great distance from the reservations was that Pratt believed distance would help break the ties to Native American culture. He has been quoted as saying, &quot;In Indian civilization I am a Baptist, because I believe in immersing the Indian in our civilization and when we get them under, holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked.&quot; 

Pratt desired to remove the children from their Native roots, and he was harsh in the actions he took. Being that Pratt was from the armed forces, his background dictated how he operated the school. The students were forced to cut their hair, a symbol of their pride. One boarding school student was quoted as saying, &quot;[Long hair] was the pride of all Indians. The boys, one by one, would break down and cry when they saw their braids thrown on the floor. All of the buckskin clothes had to go and we had to put on the clothes of the White Man&quot;. The students were stripped of all traces of what their culture was, such as: their long hair, their clothing, and their native language. The same student went on to say, &quot;This is when the loneliness set in, for it was when we knew that we were all alone. Many boys ran away from the school because the treatment was so bad, but most of them were caught and brought back by the police&quot;. Having to deal with the oppression of the school and lack of contact from their families, the students were struck with a feeling of loneliness.

===Reformation of Indian boarding schools===
Changes to the Indian boarding school system took place over the 20th and 21st centuries. The school system reformed to its current iteration. In the 1920s, Hubert Work, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, authorized an investigation on the conditions of Indian boarding schools; the group reported their findings in the Meriam Report that highlighted the failures of the boarding school system. In the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, a shift in Federal Native American policy began when President Roosevelt established the Indian New Deal with the purpose of protecting the Native population residing within the United States. The cornerstone of the Indian New Deal was the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934. This act allowed for the Native Americans to construct their own constitutions and govern themselves. In the same year, the Johnson–O&#x27;Malley Act was passed to fund Native American education. 

In 1966, the Rough Rock Demonstration School was opened. The school was on Navajo land, and was the first boarding school controlled by the Indians. Seeing the success of the Rough Rock Demonstration School, a report was filed in 1969 entitled &quot;Indian Education: A National Tragedy, A National Challenge&quot;, which stated that the U.S. government&#x27;s assimilation policy &quot;has had disastrous effects on the education of Indian children&quot;. Following this report, the Indian Education Act of 1972 established the Office of Indian Education. The Indian Self Determination and Educational Assistance Act, established in 1975, gave the American Indians the opportunity to legislate &quot;self-determination through community-based schooling&quot;. In 1990, the Native American Languages Act granted language rights to Native Americans. The Esther Martinez Native American Languages Preservation Act was established in 2006, which created programs for Native American Language immersion. These changes brought reform the Indian boarding schools needed.

The federal government established the Santa Fe Indian School (SFIS) in 1890 to educate Native American children from tribes throughout the Southwestern United States. The purpose of creating SFIS was an attempt to assimilate the Native American children into the wider United States culture and economy. In 1975, the All Indian Pueblo Council (AIPC) was formed. It was the first Indian organization to utilize the laws in place to contract an education for their children. Eventually, the AIPC was able to leverage complete control of the school and curriculum. In 2001, with the passing of the SFIS Act, the school took ownership of the land. The school resides on the form of a trust, which is held by the nineteen Pueblo Governors of New Mexico. These acts allow for complete educational sovereignty of the school, by the Pueblo.

===The Studio School===
In 1932, Dorothy Dunn established &quot;The Studio School&quot; at the Santa Fe Indian School. It was a painting program for Native Americans, which encouraged students to develop a painting style that was derived from their cultural traditions. Dunn left in 1937, and was replaced by Gerónima Cruz Montoya of Ohkay Owingeh, who taught until the program closed in 1962, with the opening of the Institute of American Indian Arts. Tonita Peña had been an instructor at the school in the 1930s.

===Demolition and restoration===
Since officially taking control of SFIS, the nineteen Pueblo Tribes began to take action in demolishing and renovating SFIS in the early 2000s. In 2008, the SFIS razed eighteen buildings. Some preservationists were upset by the demolition. School officials stated: &quot;After completing various assessments over the past five years, the Santa Fe Indian School exercised its sovereign authority and due diligence to take action by demolishing buildings to remove the imminent health, safety, and security threats to protect the students and staff of SFIS, including the general public&quot;. There was questioning of whether or not SFIS had the right to raze the buildings. After reviewing the different laws and regulations, the sovereignty overruled federal historic preservation law; the Pueblo were able to demolish the historic buildings without retribution. The Pueblo stated the buildings being torn down contained asbestos. They did not have the funds to repair the buildings and maintain them. 

The demolition of these historic buildings, in turn, had many benefits for the tribes. &quot;A Pueblo governor reportedly called the demolition of the buildings &#x27;a spiritual cleansing&#x27; for his people&quot;. &quot;Spiritual cleansing&quot; was desired by the Pueblo Tribes after years of attending Indian Boarding Schools and assimilating to different ideals. The restoration of the school contributed to enhancing and reviving the overall cultural experience of the school. The rebuilding of the school was a collaborative design build project between Albuquerque offices of Flintco Construction and ASCG. To create a welcoming, home-like environment, SFIS included fireplaces in the dorms and classrooms. SFIS believes creating a familiar environment will prevent students from becoming homesick and possibly reduce the dropout rate. 

Today there are 624 students enrolled at SFIS in grades 7-12. Out of 624 students, 155 commute and 469 live in the dorms. The school is currently 54% girls and 46% boys. The Nineteen Pueblo Tribes were the most influential in the construction of the school; they made sure the architecture reflected their traditions and contained elements of typical Pueblo architecture. &quot;A crucial factor in the project&#x27;s success was sighting the school buildings to replicate a pueblo village while preserving views with religious significance... The buildings radiate out from a central plaza that is the focus of the site design&quot;. The design was constructed with the intention of facilitating student comfort. The project had nineteen owners, each a governor of one of the nineteen Pueblo Tribes. These owners had conflicting views of the project goals increasing the project difficulty, but enhancing the project&#x27;s outcome. Joseph Abeyta, the Director of the SFIS at the time, believed that these new renovations were their chance to take back ownership of the school and what it represents. They would ensure the school &quot;would reflect and sustain their culture&quot;. These desires were fulfilled through the design of the project. The buildings were built in adobe style. The dorms and some classrooms contained fireplaces similar to the ones from their homes. SFIS has round rooms, to stimulate spirituality. These aspects tie together to produce the SFIS of today. With further construction and planning in the future, SFIS has a need to develop a reliable planning system.

==Governance==
There are 19 indigenous pueblos in the State of New Mexico. These pueblos elect a board of seven members, and this board governs the school.

==Education goals of SFIS==
The goals of SFIS are to educate the students by clarifying what they must accomplish, supported by an education of Native American culture as the foundation. &quot;The Santa Fe Indian School remains a pivotal institution and educational training ground for the development of Indian students and their communities&quot;. The strong relationship the school has with its tribal communities and parents is a fundamental aspect of the SFIS experience. With enhancing the educational experience and developing a new style of teaching, SFIS is looking to capitalize on the opportunities at hand and incorporate more technology into their plans.

=== Agriscience ===
One important initiative is a branch of CBE called Agriscience, which works closely with several Pueblo communities to engage students in all aspects of farming and agricultural practices through regular community visits. They learn about their culture and science while also practicing the design and management of sustainable agriculture systems.

===Senior honors project===
Another branch of CBE is the Senior Honors Project (SHP). The SHP is designed to teach seniors necessary project skills in a way that helps their community address current problems. Victoria Atencio&#x27;s SHP is a particularly relevant example. For her project, Honoring Mother Earth, she explored ways of reducing our impact on Earth by going back to traditional ways and focusing on renewable/alternative energy sources, enabling us to become a more sustainable community. She worked with the school&#x27;s Green Team to teach her peers about more sustainable options.

==Campus==
There is a dormitory for middle and high school students.

<doc id="1164141" wikidata="Q6966155" url="?curid=1164141" title="Narrabundah, Australian Capital Territory">
<text>Narrabundah () (postcode: 2604) is a leafy, medium density suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, located in the inner south of the city.

Narrabundah is an established garden suburb, valued for its equal proximity to both Civic and the airport, Lake Burley Griffin, and vibrant local centres such as Manuka and Kingston.

Residents particularly value Narrabundah&#x27;s environment including its open spaces, parks, playgrounds, bushland landscapes, as well as its strong sense of community and diversity.

The suburb&#x27;s streetscapes are characterised by mature deciduous and native street trees, charming established gardens and largely single-storey detached homes.

Street trees in Narrabundah offer colourful spring blossoms and spectacular Autumn foliage in many streets. Finniss Crescent, Carnegie Crescent, Sprent and Stuart Streets are planted with fine examples of Pin Oaks, which have rich green foliage in Summer and colour brilliantly in shades of scarlet and crimson in Autumn.

==History==

&#x27;Narrabundah&#x27; is widely believed to be a Ngunnawal word meaning &#x27;bird of prey&#x27; or ‘the little hawk’. This meaning is referenced in the Narrabundah College logo, as well as in the sculpture in the park opposite the Narrabundah shops.

The name Narrabundah was taken from the parish of Narrabundah, a part of the cadastral division of Murray. This parish existed when the land was administered by New South Wales.

After the Australian Capital Territory was established on 1 January 1911, all of the land areas were renamed. The present suburb Narrabundah was part of the original Parish of Queanbeyan.

Narrabundah was gazetted as a division name on 20 September 1928. Narrabundah was the last of the &#x27;inner south&#x27; suburbs to be developed, commencing in 1947, after being delayed by World War II. While early Canberra suburbs had mainly been built for public servants relocating from Melbourne, Narrabundah became Canberra&#x27;s first blue collar suburb, housing mainly workers in construction and printing.

While its first streets were initially named with numbers, street names in Narrabundah have since been renamed, with Indigenous culture, as well as white explorers and pioneers as the inspiration.

==Location==

Narrabundah is bordered by the residential suburb of Red Hill to the southwest, Griffith to the west and Kingston to the northwest, as well as the light industrial suburbs of Fyshwick to the east and Symonston to the southeast.

The suburb can be divided into three distinct areas.

The area to the east of Sturt and Jerrabomberra Avenues (sometimes called &#x27;Old Narrabundah&#x27;), where the Narrabundah shops and other community facilities including the primary school, pre-school, churches and GP clinics are situated.

This part is where Narrabundah&#x27;s original fibro cottages were placed for European construction workers who came to Canberra in the 1950s to help develop the city, along with government printing workers from the British Isles who worked in Kingston and Fyshwick. Soon after, in the early to mid 1950s, full-brick duplexes and cottages were also built, many of which still stand.

The second area, located between Captain Cook Crescent and Sturt Avenue, is near the Griffith shops, to the west of Sturt Avenue and south of Canberra Avenue.

The remaining area (sometimes called &#x27;Upper Narrabundah&#x27; or &#x27;Narrabundah Heights&#x27;) is located to the west of Captain Cook Crescent and Jerrabomberra Avenue. It rises towards the west where it borders the suburb of Red Hill. From here, panoramic views of Civic and Black Mountain, Lake Burley Griffin, Mount Ainslie and other parts of south-eastern Canberra are possible from a number of vantage points. There are also good views to Red Hill and its ridge-line. This part of Narrabundah is closer to the Red Hill and Griffith shopping areas than to the rest of Narrabundah.

Upper Narrabundah is known for its small population of urban peafowl (peacocks) with their colourful feathers. This area was once home to the residence of former Prime Minister John Gorton, who was often seen walking home from Parliament House via Manuka.

==Amenities==

Parks are widespread, with &quot;Rocky Knoll&quot; or &quot;Rocky Knob&quot; park in upper Narrabundah and its panoramic view over Canberra.

The Narrabundah shops include Canberra&#x27;s first op-shop Vinnies (Society of Saint Vincent de Paul), restaurants, as well as a real estate agent and property manager, pharmacy, licensed post office, bakery, grocer, two hairdressers, and a barber. 

Narrabundah is home to the Canberra Cavalry baseball team, with home matches played at the Narrabundah Ballpark, informally known as the &#x27;Bundahdome&#x27;, near Mill Creek off Goyder Crescent in Old Narrabundah.

Narrabundah is home to two primary schools, Narrabundah Early Childhood School and St. Benedict&#x27;s Primary School.

It is also home to Narrabundah College, one of the top public schools for the last two years of secondary schooling in the ACT and the first in Australia to offer the International Baccalaureate.

For community matters, &#x27;Old Narrabundah&#x27; is represented by the Old Narrabundah Community Council (ONCC), while most of the rest of the suburb is represented by the Griffith-Narrabundah Community Association. Both form part of the broader Inner South Community Council.

==Public art==

A sculpture titled Narrabundah: A Site Marker has been erected opposite the shops with the following inscription on a plaque:
==Education==
Narrabundah residents are typically eligible to enrol in ACT public schools as follows:
*Narrabundah Early Childhood School for pre-school to Year Two, or alternatively Forrest Primary or Red Hill School for pre-school to Year 6, depending on the address.
*Telopea Park School (for the first four years of secondary schooling)
*Narrabundah College (for the last two years of secondary schooling)

==Geology==

One kind of rock is named after the suburb: the Narrabundah Ashstone Member which is found in the east and southeast. Rocks in Narrabundah are from the Silurian age. Some of the rocks are grey coloured tuff from the Mount Painter Volcanics. This can be viewed in a park on Brockman St. The Deakin Fault runs from Frome St. The fault line is displaced from Anembo St south to Goyder St by a north–south running fault that connects up with the South Fyshwick Fault. The South Fyshwick Fault runs east from the Narrabundah Primary School, separating ashstone in the south from the Canberra Formation in the north. Calcareous shale from the Canberra Formation lies to the north of the Deakin Fault.

The group is bounded on the north and east by the Pacific Ocean, on the west by Lillie Glacier, and on the south by Ebbe Glacier and Dennistoun Glacier. 
They are north of the Concord Mountains and east of the Bowers Mountains.

==Exploration and naming==
Mountains in this area were first sighted by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841. 
They were photographed during United States Navy Operation Highjump (1946–1947) and were surveyed by United States Geological Survey (USGS) helicopter teams, 1962–63. 
The Anare Mountains were named by the northern party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition, 1963–64, for the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE), 1962, under Phillip Law, which performed survey work along the coast.

==Location==

In the northwest the Anare Mountains extend along the Pacific coast to the east of Ob&#x27; Bay and the Lillie Glacier. 
Zykov Glacier flows north through the mountains to the Pacific.
George Glacier, Beaman Glacier and McLean Glacier flow east into Lillie Glacier.
In the southwest, the Ebbe Glacier flows west into Lillie Glacier and defines the southern boundary of the Anare Mountains. 
The Everett Range lies to the south.

Further east, McMahon Glacier and Kirkby Glacier flow north to the Pacific to the west of the Davis Ice Piedmont and Yule Bay. 
The O&#x27;Hara Glacier and Fortenberry Glacier flow into Yule Bay to the east of Tapsell Foreland.
The Barnett Glacier flows east from the mountains into Smith Inlet at the eastern edge of the mountains.
In the southeast, Robertson Glacier flows south to join Ebbe Glacier.
Anare Pass lies between Ebbe Glacier and Dennistoun Glacier, which defines the southeast boundary of the mountains.
South of the mountains are the Everett Range, Robinson Heights and Dunedin Range in the Admiralty Mountains.

==Northern features==
Features of the northwest section include Cape Williams and Cooper Bluffs on the coast, Saddle Peak and Mount Kostka in the Buell Peninsula to the west of Zykov Glacier, Mount Kelly and Mount Burch between George Glacier and Lillie Glacier.
Features of the northeast section include Cooper Spur, the Dwyer Escarpment, Cape North, Nielsen Fjord, Gregory Bluffs, Davis Ice Piedmont, Yule Bay and Tapsell Foreland along the coast, Buskirk Bluffs, Mount Harwood, Tiger Peak and Mount Elliot further inland.

===Mount Kelly===

<text>The Lambing Flat riots were a series of violent anti-Chinese demonstrations that took place in the Burrangong region, in New South Wales, Australia. They occurred on the goldfields at Spring Creek, Stoney Creek, Back Creek, Wombat, Blackguard Gully, Tipperary Gully, and Lambing Flat.

==Antipathy on the Goldfields==
Events in the Australian goldfields in the 1850s led to hostility toward Chinese miners on the part of many Europeans, which was to affect many aspects of European-Chinese relations in Australia for the next century. Some of the sources of conflict between European and Chinese miners arose from the nature of the industry they were engaged in. Most gold mining in the early years was alluvial mining, where the gold was in small particles mixed with dirt, gravel and clay close to the surface of the ground, or buried in the beds of old watercourses or &quot;leads&quot;. Extracting the gold took no great skill, but it was hard work, and generally speaking, the more work, the more gold the miner won. Europeans tended to work alone or in small groups, concentrating on rich patches of ground, and frequently abandoning a reasonably rich claim to take up another one rumoured to be richer. Very few miners became wealthy; the reality of the diggings was that relatively few miners found even enough gold to earn them a living.

The Chinese generally worked in large organised groups, covering the entire ground&#x27;s surface, so that if there was any gold there, the Chinese miners usually found it. They lived communally and frugally, and could subsist on a much lower return than Europeans. The rural background of most of the Chinese diggers suited them very well to life as alluvial goldminers: they were used to long hours of hard outdoor work as a member of a disciplined team, accustomed to simple sleeping quarters and basic food, and were satisfied with a much smaller return of gold than the majority of Europeans.

Tension between the two groups first surfaced as petty complaints: Europeans made stereotyped claims that the Chinese muddied the water holes, they worked on the Sabbath, they were thieves, they had insanitary habits, they accepted low wages and would drive down the value of labour. But because the Chinese were distinctive in appearance, language and dress, they became classic targets for xenophobia, and surly resentment became systematic hatred.

These pressures gave rise to several violent protests against government policies across Victoria and New South Wales in the late 1850s and early 1860s. The first anti-Chinese demonstration occurred in Bendigo in July 1854. Some of these incidents took the form of outright attempts at excluding the Chinese from a goldfield, or a portion of it. Disputes between European and Chinese miners flared into brawls at Daylesford and Castlemaine. A party of Chinese en route to the Victorian diggings from Robe discovered a new goldfield at Ararat, and were driven off their find by Europeans. Similar events occurred in New South Wales, which was just feeling the impact of significant Chinese immigration. European miners drove Chinese off the diggings at Rocky River in New England (Australia) in 1856. Serious confrontations followed at Adelong in 1857 and Tambaroora in 1858. In Victoria the Buckland River goldfield was the scene of repeated incidents, culminating in a major riot in July 1857.

==The Burrangong Affair==
The most notorious of these incidents, and the one which has generated more folklore than any other, was the so-called Lambing Flat Riot, actually a drawn-out series of incidents on the Burrangong Goldfield in New South Wales between November 1860 and September 1861. Several place names are sometimes used interchangeably when describing these events. Burrangong was the name of the gazetted goldfield, and its principal settlement later became the modern town of Young. Lambing Flat, the name which has attached itself most persistently to the events, was a horse paddock where one of the most violent incidents took place.

Another important aspect of the story is the political events that were going on in Sydney, for the Burrangong affair was played out against the background of a contentious debate in the New South Wales Parliament over legislation to restrict Chinese immigration. Chinese numbers on the New South Wales goldfields had been relatively small, but were rising in the wake of restrictions imposed in Victoria. Restrictive legislation had also been proposed in New South Wales as early as 1858 in the wake of Victorian and South Australian laws, but the Premier, Charles Cowper, found his own party divided on the issue and the Bill failed. Then in 1860 the Chinese and British governments signed the Convention of Peking, a diplomatic agreement that subjects of the Chinese and British Empires would have reciprocal rights under their respective countries&#x27; laws. As the Australian colonies enacted British laws, it raised the question of whether New South Wales could legally exclude citizens of the Chinese Empire. A new Chinese Immigration Regulation Bill was being drafted for debate in Parliament while the first gold miners were arriving at Burrangong.

The events at Burrangong were well-recorded at the time, and have been analysed by a number of historians in recent decades. The Burrangong affair was arguably the most serious civil disorder that has ever happened in Australia, involving more people and lasting much longer than the Eureka rebellion at Ballarat six years earlier.

Trouble began late in 1860 with the formation of a Miners Protective League, followed by roll-ups (mass meetings) of European diggers evicting Chinese miners from sections of the field. These events involved the quasi-legal posting of notices to quit, and were carried out ceremonially, with a brass band leading the marchers. There was little violence at first. Most of the Chinese moved to new diggings nearby, and some returned soon afterward. This pattern of behaviour was to be repeated on several occasions over the next eight months; there seemed to be an understanding from early in the Burrangong events that the Chinese would be tolerated if they remained in certain areas of the goldfield.

==The Lambing Flat riots==

In ten months of unrest at Burrangong, the most infamous riot on the gold fields occurred on the night of 30 June 1861 when a mob of between 2,000 and 3,000 European, North American and Australian-born
gold miners attacked about 2,000 Chinese miners and drove the Chinese off the Lambing Flat, and then moved on to the Back Creek diggings, where 150–200 Chinese were encamped, they went about destroying tents and looting possessions. Many of the Chinese were cruelly beaten, but no one was killed. About 1,000 Chinese abandoned the field and set up camp near Roberts&#x27; homestead at Currowang sheep station, 20 km away. There were two triggers for the violence: in Sydney the Legislative Council rejected the anti-Chinese bill, and a false rumour swept the goldfield that a new group of 1,500 Chinese were on the road to Burrangong. The police arrived in the days that followed, identified the leaders of the riot, and three were arrested two weeks later. The mob&#x27;s reaction was an armed attack on the police camp by about a thousand miners on the night of 14 July, which the police broke up with gunfire and mounted sabre charges, leaving one rioter, William Lupton, dead and many wounded.

The police briefly abandoned the field, but then a detachment of 280 soldiers, sailors and police reinforcements arrived from Sydney and stayed for a year. Some of the remaining Chinese miners were reinstated on segregated diggings, the ringleaders of the riots were tried and two were gaoled. At the end of the affair, Burrangong was quiet and some Chinese miners were still there.

A number of Chinese miners petitioned the NSW Government for compensation due to their losses in the riots. However it is doubtful if any compensations was actually paid.

===The Lambing Flat banner===

A banner, painted on a tent-flap in 1861, is now on display at the Lambing Flat museum in Young, New South Wales. Bearing a Southern Cross superimposed over a Flag of Scotland&#x27;s. Andrew&#x27;s Cross with the inscription, &#x27;Roll Up – No Chinese&#x27;, the banner has been claimed by some as a variant of the Eureka Flag. It served as an advertisement for a public meeting that presaged the infamous Lambing Flat riots later that year. Painted by a Scottish migrant, it is a testimony to the transfer of cultural practices and values through migration. Though it has been claimed to be an example of Chartist art, the Chartist movement was not racial in nature and sought only to protect the poor from the rich. Nevertheless, along with the Eureka Flag it is a rare example of an historic Australian banner designed to rally support to a cause.

<doc id="1164155" wikidata="Q6792892" url="?curid=1164155" title="Maurice Blackburn">
<text>Maurice McCrae Blackburn (19 November 1880 – 31 March 1944) was an Australian politician and socialist lawyer, noted for his protection of the interests of workers and the establishment of the legal firm known as Maurice Blackburn Lawyers.

==Early life==
Blackburn was born on 19 November 1880 in Inglewood, Victoria. He was the son of Thomasann Cole (née McCrae) and Maurice Blackburn. His father, a bank manager, was the son of architect James Blackburn.

Following the death of his father in 1887, Blackburn and his mother moved to Melbourne where he was educated at Melbourne Grammar School, matriculating in 1896. He attended the University of Melbourne, graduating in arts and law in 1909, and began to practise as a lawyer a year later. In the same year, he also became a member of the Victorian Socialist Party and was soon editing its newspaper, &quot;The Socialist&quot;. Later, in about 1908, he joined the Australian Labor Party.

==Legal career==

Blackburn established the firm Maurice Blackburn &amp; Co. in 1919, dealing primarily in trade union law and civil liberties cases.

During his time practising law, Blackburn won cases that played a key role in establishing rights, including the 40-hour working week, wage equality for indigenous workers and women.

In late 1934 and early 1935, Blackburn acted as legal counsel to prevent the deportation of the noted Czech anti-fascist Egon Kisch.

==State politics==
Blackburn was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly at the 1914 state election, winning the seat of Essendon for the ALP. During World War I he was active in the anti-war movement and refused to assist the military&#x27;s recruiting campaign. Although he supported compulsory military training for national defence, he opposed conscription for overseas service, an issue which split the ALP in 1916. His anti-war stance contributed to his defeat at the 1917 state election.

Following his defeat, Blackburn was elected state president of the ALP in 1919. He was also editor of the party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Labor Call&quot; from 1918 to 1920. He represented Victoria at interstate conferences and at the 1921 federal conference carried a motion moderating the socialist objective in the party&#x27;s constitution, committing the party to supporting private ownership of the means of production where they were &quot;utilised by their owners in a socially useful manner and without exploitation&quot;.

Blackburn was re-elected to the Legislative Assembly at a 1925 by-election for the seat of Fitzroy, despite an alleged attempt by John Wren and his supporters to rig the preselection ballot. He transferred to Clifton Hill at the 1927 election. In 1926 he had succeeded in passing a private member&#x27;s bill, the &quot;Women&#x27;s Qualification Act 1926&quot;, which removed restrictions on women&#x27;s participation in certain professions.

During the Great Depression, Blackburn opposed ALP premier Edmond Hogan&#x27;s austerity measures, including retrenchment of public servants, and attacked the Premiers&#x27; Plan. He nonetheless remained popular in the ALP and was elected speaker of the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1933.

==Federal politics==
Blackburn resigned from the Assembly in 1934, so he could contest the Federal seat of Bourke, based on the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg in Melbourne. Although he won Bourke and held it until 1943, his relationship with the Labor Party was chequered.

In October 1935, he voted in favour of sanctions against Italy over the Abyssinian crisis, defying his leader John Curtin.

Blackburn&#x27;s support for international socialism, and his opposition to conscription, frequently caused him to take positions opposed to Labor policy and, in October 1935, he was expelled over his membership of the Movement Against War and Fascism. He was re-admitted to the ALP on 27 March 1937 following a vote at the party&#x27;s annual conference.

Blackburn was again expelled from the ALP in 1941 for his support of the Australia-Soviet Friendship League. His expulsion was seen as a warning to other left-wing MPs that violation of party policy was not to be tolerated. Blackburn continued to serve as the member for Bourke as an independent, voting against the Labor government&#x27;s conscription bill, but he lost his seat at the 1943 election to the official Labor candidate.

==Personal life==

Blackburn married Doris Amelia Hordern on 10 December 1914.

Blackburn died of cerebral tumour on 31 March 1944, in Prahran, Victoria, and was buried in Box Hill Cemetery, survived by his wife, two sons, a daughter, and his mother. His estate, which included a fine library, was sworn for probate at £2,552. In a eulogy, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin referred to Blackburn as &quot;one of the great servants of the people of the Commonwealth of Australia&quot;. His widow, Doris, won Bourke as an Independent Labour candidate at the 1946 election and spent much of her time in Parliament promoting similar policies to those that Blackburn had supported.

<doc id="1164159" wikidata="Q440698" url="?curid=1164159" title="Lillie Glacier">
<text>Lillie Glacier () is a large glacier in Antarctica, about long and wide. It lies between the Bowers Mountains on the west and the Concord Mountains and Anare Mountains on the east, flowing to Ob&#x27; Bay on the coast and forming the Lillie Glacier Tongue.
==Discovery and naming==
The glacier tongue was discovered by the British Antarctic Expedition, 1910–13, and was named by the expedition for Dennis G. Lillie, a biologist on the &quot;Terra Nova&quot;. The name Lillie has since been extended to the entire glacier.
The lower half of the glacier was plotted by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) (&quot;Thala Dan&quot;) in 1962, which explored the area and utilized air photos taken by United States Navy Operation Highjump, 1946–47. The whole feature was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960–62.

On 22 October 1964 a United States Navy ski-equipped LC-47 airplane flew from Hallett Station to establish a cache of fuel drums on Lillie Glacier for army helicopters to use when supporting a scientific party later in the season. After unloading the drums and taking off, the plane developed engine trouble and was forced to land on the glacier again. 
There were no serious injuries.

==Course==

The Lillie Glacier forms below the Evans Névé, fed by the Lloyd Icefall to the east of the East Quartzite Range and southwest of the Victory Mountains.
It flows north through the Concord Mountains between the King Range to the west and the Mirabito Range to the east.
To the north of Toilers Mountain in the King Range it is joined by Black Glacier from the west, and then by McCann Glacier north of Markinsenis Peak.
The Black Glacier forms between the Salamander Range and the Neall Massif and flows north.
Houliston Glacier joins Black Glacier from the east to the south of the Leitch Massif.
Rawle Glacier joins it from the east to the north of the Leitch Massif.
The Black Glacier is joined from the west by Leap Year Glacier before joining Lille Glacier.

North of Mount Radspinner the Lillie Glacier is joined by Champness Glacier from the west, and then at the north end of the Mirabito Range by the Greenwell Glacier from the east.
The Greenwell Glacier forms and flows northeast between the Mirabito Range to the west and the Homerun Range to the east.
At its head it is joined to the Jutland Glacier and Plata Glacier.
Just before entering the Lillie Glacier it is joined from the east by the Horne Glacier.
The Lillie Glacier flow north between the Posey Range to the west and the Everett Range to the east.
Past Everett Spur it is joined from the east by the Ebbe Glacier.
The Ebbe Glacier forms to the east of the Homerun Range and flows northwest and then west between the Everett Range to the southwest and the Anare Mountains to the northeast. It is fed from the Anare Mountains by Robertson Glacier, which enters from the north.

The Lillie Glacier is then joined from the east by the McLean Glacier, the Beaman Glacier and the George Glacier flowing from the Anare Mountains. The George Glacier flows into the Lillie Glacier Tongue.
Before reaching its mouth on the west the Lillie Glacier flows north west past the Flensing Icefall.
This is fed by the Graveson Glacier from the north.
The Graveson Glacier forms west of Mount Verhage and flows north between the Explorers Range and the Posey Range. It is joined by the Smithson Glacier from the east and the McLin Glacier, Irwin Glacier, Montigny Glacier and Van Loon Glacier from the west. The McLin and Irwin glaciers are both fed by the Edlin Névé.
The Lillie Glacier is also fed by the Rastorguey Glacier and the Crawford Glacier from the west.

Named by the NZGSAE to northern Victoria Land, 1967-68, for G.R. Champness, field assistant with that party.

===Flensing Icefall===
A large icefall at the east side of the Bowers Mountains, situated south of Platypus Ridge at the junction of the Graveson Glacier and the Rastorguev Glacier with the Lillie Glacier. 
So named by the northern party of NZGSAE, 1963-64, because the icefall&#x27;s longitudinal system of parallel crevassing resembles the carcass of a whale when being flensed.

===McLin Glacier===
A tributary glacier which flows north of McKenzie Nunatak into Graveson Glacier, in the Bowers Mountains. 
The glacier saddles with Carryer Glacier on the west and is nourished in part by Edlin Névé. 
Named by the NZGSAE to this area, 1967-68, for Lieutenant Commander Robert D. McLin, United States Navy, pilot of Hercules LC-130 aircraft in Antarctica that season.

===McKenzie Nunatak=== 
A very prominent nunatak which rises above the ice between McLin Glacier and Graveson Glacier, in the Bowers Mountains.
Mapped by USGS from ground surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1960-62. 
Named by US-ACAN for Carry D. McKenzie, glaciologist, who participated in the study of Meserve Glacier in 1966-67.

===Graveson Glacier===
A broad north-flowing tributary to the Lillie Glacier, draining that portion of the Bowers Mountains between the Posey Range and the southern part of Explorers Range. 
The feature is fed by several lesser tributaries and enters Lillie Glacier via Flensing Icefalls.
Named by the northern party of NZGSAE, 1963-64, for F. Graveson, mining engineer, who wintered at Scott Base in 1963 and was field assistant on this expedition.

===Smithson Glacier===
A tributary glacier in the Bowers Mountains. 
It drains the slopes near Mount Verhage and flows north along the west side of Posey Range to enter Graveson Glacier adjacent to Mount Draeger. 
Mapped by USGS from ground surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-62. 
Named by US-ACAN for Scott B. Smithson, geologist at McMurdo Station, 1967-68.

===Irwin Glacier===
A steep tributary glacier in the Bowers Mountains, draining northeast from Edlin Névé and at the terminus coalescing with Montigny Glacier (from the north), with which it enters the larger Graveson Glacier. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for Carlisle S. Irwin, glaciologist, who participated in the study of Meserve Glacier in 1966-67.

===Montigny Glacier===
A steep tributary glacier in the Bowers Mountains, flowing eastward and at the terminus coalescing with Irwin Glacier (from the south), with which it enters the larger Graveson Glacier.
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-64. 
Named by US-ACAN for Raymond J. Montigny, glaciologist, who participated in the study of Meserve Glacier in 1966-67.

===Van Loon Glacier===
A tributary glacier, long, draining the eastern slopes of the Bowers Mountains between Rasturguev Glacier and Montigny Glacier. 
It merges into the larger Graveson Glacier at the east margin of the mountains. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy aerial photography, 1960-62. 
Named by US-ACAN for meteorologist Harry van Loon, a member of the Antarctic Weather Central team at Little America on the Ross Ice Shelf 1957-58, who has written numerous scientific papers dealing with Antarctic and southern hemisphere atmospheric research.

===Edlin Névé===
A névé at the south side of Mount Sturm in the Bowers Mountains.
Several glaciers, including the Carryer Glacier, Irwin Glacier, McLin Glacier and Graveson Glacier, are nourished by this névé. 
Named by NZGSAE, 1967-68, for G. Edlin, who served as postmaster at Scott Base and assisted in the field during this expedition.

===Rastorguey Glacier===
Large tributary glacier which drains the east slopes of the Explorers Range between Mount Ford and Mount Sturm and joins Lillie Glacier via Flensing Icefall. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-62. 
Named by US-ACAN after Vladimir I. Rastorguev, Soviet IGY observer, a Weather Central meteorologist at Little America V in 1957.

===Crawford Glacier===
A tributary glacier which drains the east slopes of Explorers Range between Mount Hager and Mount Ford. 
It descends east to join Lillie Glacier south of Platypus Ridge. 
Mapped by USGS from surveys and United States Navy air photos, 1960-65. 
Named by US-ACAN after Douglas I. Crawford, biologist at McMurdo Station, 1965-66.

<text>Te Wairoa was a village close to the shore of Lake Tarawera near Rotorua, New Zealand. The village was buried by volcanic ash in the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera. It was later excavated and is now open as a tourist destination, the Buried Village. The nearby Wairere Falls are also a tourist destination.

The Buried Village is open to the public and shows the excavated ruins of the village, recovered relics on display in a museum and the history of the eruption. It is located south-east of Rotorua on Tarawera Road.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &#x27;the long stream&#x27; for .

==History==

Te Wairoa was a Māori and European settlement founded about 1850 by the Reverend Seymour Mills Spencer where visitors would stay on their way to visit the Pink and White Terraces. About 1865 the New Zealand Wars resulted in temporary abandonment of the town until the 1870s.

At the time of the eruption it had two hotels, McRae&#x27;s Hotel (Rotomahana Hotel, 25 rooms), and the Terrace Hotel (Terrace Temperance Hotel, 12 rooms), but these had only 3 guests. There were about a 135 permanent inhabitants, but because of a many Māori were visiting. The village and the terraces were destroyed by the eruption of Mount Tarawera on 10 June 1886. One hundred and twenty people died in the eruption, many of them in other villages closer to the volcano. The site of one of these villages (Kokotaia) was utilised in the postulated rediscovery of the Pink and White Terrace locations.

A Māori meeting house named Hinemihi (more fully ), which provided shelter to the people of Te Wairoa village during the eruption, was relocated in 1892 to Clandon Park as an ornamental garden building and a souvenir of William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow.

===1886 eruption===

Being from Mount Tarawera, those in the village were among the nearest surviving witnesses of its 1886 eruption. During the day of 9 June there had been a little rain but the evening was fine and clear. About half-past midnight on 10 June slight earthquakes were noticed by some in Te Wairoa who were not asleep. Between 1:15 a.m. by a Te Wairoa account and 1:20 a.m. by another observer with a watch, there was a flash of light. A column of dark vapour, described as black smoke, was seen rising by some of the inhabitants of Te Wairoa by 1:30 am. Most Te Wairoa witnesses seem to have been awaken by about 1:45 a.m. At Te Wairoa the first stones fell about 3 am with mud or ashes continuing to fall until 9 a.m. Roofs had collapsed by 3:40 a.m. There was no difficulty in walking about on the surface of the ash next morning, but after had been trampled on for a day or two the surface along the road was converted into mud. Much of the ash fell either as mud or in a moist, flaky condition, which after little rain converted to mud. At Te Wairoa after the eruption, the ash depth was , and one of the deeper layers was in a very wet state. Over 40% of the ash deposit was described as fine, white and earthy, but not plastic, with black scoria layers varying from 7 to 22%, by weight.

From dawn, which was about 7:15 a.m., it being winter, some survivors set off towards Rotorua. Rescue parties meet them on the way and some of the able-bodied chose to return to Te Wairoa to aid in digging out the buried. Some looting had occurred when the rescuers arrived.

Other accounts suggest that the surface basaltic eruptions of Tarawera proper stopped some time on the 10th, with the last record of Mount Tarawera noisy activity being about 5 p.m. and only steam observed from 11 June. Significant hydrothermal eruptions continued in the Rotomahana crater until the night of 12 July 1886, related to subsurface intrusion of the basalt along a dyke into the pre-existing hydrothermal systems of the Rotomahana area. This correct molten dyke hypothesis was postulated soon after the eruption, but was not geological mainstream understanding of some volcanic activity at the time.

During an earthquake following the eruption on 20 July, on the road between Rotorua and Te Wairoa, a fissure was opened, where a post eruption pond had formed, that was long and up to deep.

== Wairere Falls ==
The Wairoa Stream flows on the southern edge of the village and over the Wairere Falls. The stream links Lake Rotokakahi () above sea level with Lake Tarawera () above sea level. Visitors to Te Wairoa may descend the falls via a trail with steps.

<text>A hex editor (or &quot;binary file editor&quot; or &quot;byte editor&quot;) is a computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file. The name &#x27;hex&#x27; comes from &#x27;hexadecimal&#x27;, a standard numerical format for representing binary data. A typical computer file occupies multiple areas on the storage medium, whose contents are combined to form the file. Hex editors that are designed to parse and edit sector data from the physical segments of floppy or hard disks are sometimes called &quot;sector editors&quot; or &quot;disk editors&quot;.

==Details==

With a hex editor, a user can see or edit the raw and exact contents of a file, as opposed to the interpretation of the same content that other, higher level application software may associate with the file format. For example, this could be raw image data, in contrast to the way image editing software would interpret and show the same file.

Hex editors may be used to correct data corrupted by system or application program problems where it may not be worthwhile to write a special program to make the corrections. They are useful to bypass application edit checks which may prevent correction of erroneous data. They have been used to &quot;patch&quot; executable programs to change or add a few instructions as an alternative to recompilation. Program fixes for IBM mainframe systems are sometimes distributed as patches rather than distributing a complete copy of the affected program.

In most hex editor applications, the data of the computer file is represented as hexadecimal values grouped in 4 groups of 4 bytes (or two groups of 8 bytes), followed by one group of 16 printable ASCII characters which correspond to each pair of hex values (each byte). Non-printable ASCII characters (e.g., Bell) and characters that would take more than one character space (e.g., tab) are typically represented by a dot (&quot;.&quot;) in the following ASCII field.

; Size limits
Unlike conventional text editors, Hex editors are able to efficiently handle files with indefinite sizes, as only a portion of the file is loaded while browsing it and modified when saving it, rather than the entire file at once.

==Early history==
Since the invention of computers and their different uses, a variety of file formats has been created. In some special circumstances it was convenient to be able to access the data as a series of raw digits. A program called SUPERZAP (AMASPZAP) was available for IBM OS/360 systems which could edit raw disk records and also understood the format of executable files. Pairs of hexadecimal digits (each pair can represent a byte) are the current standard, because the vast majority of machines and file formats in use today handle data in units or groups of 8-bit bytes. Hexadecimal and also octal are common because these digits allow one to see which bits in a byte are set. Today, decimal instead of hexadecimal representation is becoming a popular second option due to the more familiar number base and additional helper tools, such as template systems and data inspectors, that reduce the benefits of the hexadecimal numerical format.

==Template systems==
Some hex editors offer a template system that can present the sequence of bytes of a binary file in a structured way, covering part or all of the desired file format. Usually the GUI for a template is a separate tool window next to the main hex editor. Some cheat engine systems consist only of such a template GUI.

Typically, a template is represented as a list of labeled text boxes, such that individual values of a file can be easily edited in the appropriate format (e.g., as string, color, or decimal number). Without template support, it is necessary to find the right offset in a file where the value that is to be changed is stored. Also, raw hex editing may require conversion from hexadecimal to decimal, catering for byte order, or other data type conversion peculiarities.

Templates can be stored as files, thereby exchanged by users, and are often shared publicly over the manufacturer&#x27;s website. Most if not all hex editors define their own template file format; there is no trend to support a standard or even compatibility between the various formats out in the wild.

==Scripting systems==
Advanced hex editors have scripting systems that let the user create macro like functionality as a sequence of user interface commands for automating common tasks. This can be used for providing scripts that automatically patch files (e.g., game cheating, modding, or product fixes provided by community) or to write more complex/intelligent templates.

Scripting languages vary widely, often being product specific languages resembling MS-DOS batch files, to systems that support fully-fledged scripting languages such as Lua or Python.

==Plugin systems==
A few select editors have a plugin system that allows to extend the GUI and add new functionality, usually loading dynamic link libraries written in a C-compatible language.

<text>James Rodney Winter Sykes (May 19, 1929 – January 3, 2025) was a Canadian politician from Alberta. He served as the 30th Mayor of Calgary from 1969 to 1977 and as leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party from 1980 to 1982. He ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1984 federal election.

==Early life==
Sykes was born in May 19, 1929 in Montreal, Quebec, to Leslie Sykes an electrical engineer, and Muriel, a stay-at-home mother. The Sykes family moved shortly after his birth to Sooke, British Columbia. Sykes&#x27;s father was largely absent from the home, working out of the community, and Sykes did not attend a formal school until the age of 8 in 1937 when the family moved to Kent. Instead Sykes learned to read and write from his mother. The Sykes family returned to Victoria, British Columbia a year later after the death of his grandfather James Sykes to live in his inherited home.

After returning to Victoria, Sykes&#x27;s father enlisted in the Canadian Scottish Reserves and served overseas for six years in the Second World War. The family faced financial insecurity, and his mother spent time in a nursing home due to mental health issues, while Sykes and his sister were put into foster care. Sykes lashed out during his time at school and was often in trouble. Sykes later attended Oak Bay High School, which he saw as a turning point in his life, and was able to catch up with his education in what he described as a positive environment. Sykes also credited T.W.S. Parsons, the Commissioner of the British Columbia Provincial Police, and father of a school friend with being a positive father figure in his formative years.

Sykes&#x27;s father returned from the Second World War when his son was 17, and Rod soon moved out of the family home due to animosity with his father. Sykes considered a career in law, but attended Sprott Shaw College to take classes in business, and began working in an apprenticeship at a small accounting firm. At 19, Sykes reported the principal of the firm to the Institute of Chartered Accountants after he was forced to present falsified figures for a client to a bank, the Institute arranged for Sykes to continue his career at Price Waterhouse. With Price Waterhouse, Sykes lived in Montreal for eight years from 1954 to 1962, and in Zurich, Switzerland for a short period of time.

After becoming a Chartered accountant, Sykes attended Sir George Williams University in Montreal, studying economics.

== Canadian Pacific Railway and Calgary ==
Sykes joined Canadian Pacific Railway as the Supervisor of Economic Projects in 1959 at the invitation of Ian David Sinclair. His role was to better utilize the CPR&#x27;s non-transportation assets such as oil, gas, forestry, real estate, chemicals and metal holdings. Sykes spent much of his time travelling between his home in Montreal and Calgary, where the CPR was considering moving tracks out of the city&#x27;s downtown and use the land for real estate development. Sykes moved to Calgary in 1962 as the CPR&#x27;s Project Manager for the Calgary land use study.

In Calgary, Sykes established and ran the CPR&#x27;s real estate arm Marathon Realty, which Sykes named after the short story &quot;The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner&quot;. The planned relocation of the CPR tracks was a joint project between the city and the railway, and early on Sykes had a strong relationship with Mayor Harry Hays. When Hays quit municipal politics to run federally in 1963, he was replaced with Grant MacEwan for two years, with whom Sykes had a challenging relationship. While Hays had strongly supported the redevelopment, MacEwan believed the final decision should be sent to the residents of Calgary.

==Political career==
Sykes served as mayor of Calgary from 1969 to 1977. He was defender of the underdog and the importance of financial safety nets for the needy, attacked corruption among the rich and powerful, and left office after ensuring Calgary would begin on LRT construction. During his time as mayor, Calgary switched from the pro-rep (STV) system to plurality election in single-member wards.

Sykes was leader of the Alberta Social Credit Party from 1980 to 1982. He quit as party leader in 1982, frustrated by the party&#x27;s internal and financial problems.

In 1984, he was nominated by Alan Clarke, Calgary East Federal Liberal Riding Association Vice President, to run for the Liberal Party for a seat in the House of Commons, in the riding of Calgary East. At the time this was the largest riding in Canada.

Sykes was acclaimed at a nomination meeting with over six hundred members in attendance. Despite being the only Liberal candidate endorsed by the &quot;Calgary Sun&quot; that year, he lost to Progressive Conservative Alex Kindy in the general election.

==Personal life and death==
Sykes and his wife, Marie Therese Claire Gisèle (&quot;née&quot; Seguin, 1929–2008), had five children and fourteen grandchildren.

At an early age Sykes took an interest in gardening, reading, and stamp collecting, and remained a member of the American Philatelic Society throughout his life. Through his interest in reading, the British Royal family, and political history, Sykes became friends with Lord Mountbatten, which allowed Sykes access to some major events during his life.

Sykes was raised as a Christian in the Church of England, but later converted to Catholicism in his mid-20s.

Sykes was a long-time friend of professional wrestler and promoter Stu Hart.

Sykes died at his home in Calgary, on January 3, 2025, at the age of 95.

<text>Yoʼokop is an ancient Maya city located in the Cochuah region of central Quintana Roo, Mexico. This area is best known as the center of the Caste War of Yucatán waged during the 19th century, that resulted in an independent Maya state governed from the city of Chan Santa Cruz.

The site was first publicized by the archaeologist Herbert Spinden along with the New York Times journalist Gregory Mason during the 1920s, but intensive scrutiny did not begin until the 21st century. Recent archaeological work at Yoʼokop has revealed that it was a large and significant urban center before the Spanish Conquest. It was continuously inhabited from the Formative Period through the Postclassic Period, as revealed by the presence of datable ceramic sherds and architecture. The name of the site, Yoʼokop refers to a large shallow lake at the southern end of the settlement. (“Yo” is an article and “Okop” means lake. In older scholarship the site is referred to without the article as Okop.)

The grandeur of Yoʼokop can be demonstrated by the fact that the site contains a pyramid (S4W1-1) overgrown with vegetation that is 28 meters tall—only two meters shorter than the celebrated Castillo of Chichen Itza. The site is organized around four groups of architecture made from stone and other enduring materials. These groups are connected with raised roads (sacbeob). The areas between these larger groups contained houses made from perishable materials that are no longer easy to see.

An archaeological project was instigated at Yoʼokop in 2000 under the directorship of Justine Shaw and Dave Johnstone. As of 2009 their team has studied Yoʼokop through mapping, ceramic analysis, and test pits. Their initial data shows how the site was organized, fitted within trade networks, and changed over time. Recognizing the significance of the area, in 2003 they expanded their project into a survey of the broader Cochuah region. One scholar affiliated with the project, Johan Normark, has done research that is notable for its use of theories about material culture and &quot;agency&quot;.

Linnea Wren and Travis Nygard have analyzed the monumental record of Yoʼokop in terms of both sacred and &quot;gendered&quot; space. Sculpture at the site includes two freestanding stelae of male rulers and a wall panel of a male ball player—all three of which are rendered in low-relief. The site also includes carefully carved hieroglyphic stair risers describing a queen (Kaloomte Na Chaʼak Kab) who may have ruled at Yoʼokop under the overlord Sky Witness from Calakmul or Dzoyola. The risers were not found in-situ. (For information on Sky Witness, see the work of Simon Martin and Nicolai Grube.)

Prior to Shaw and Johnstone&#x27;s project the site had been best-studied by Reginald Wilson, who published his findings during the 1970s. A brief visit to the site was also made during the 1950s by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.

<text>, alternatively romanized as Jō-ō or Shōō, was a after &quot;Keian&quot; and before &quot;Meireki&quot;. This period spanned the years from September 1652 through April 1655. The reigning emperors were and .

==Change of era==
* 1652 : The era name was changed to &quot;Jōō&quot; (meaning &quot;receiving answers&quot;), which was to mark the death of the third &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Iemitsu. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Keian&quot; 5, on the 18th day of the 9th month.

The name of this new era came from the Book of the Jin: &quot;The Xia and the Shang dynasties follow their destinies, so the House of Zhou came when it was time.&quot; (夏商承運、周氏応期)

==Events of the &quot;Jōō&quot; era==
* October 3, 1653 (&quot;Jōō 2, 12th day of the 8th month&quot;): A violent fire destroyed a large part of the Imperial palace and many temples which were nearby. Shortly thereafter, several girls, aged 12–14 years, were imprisoned for having started this fire and others in Heian-kyō.
* August 18, 1654 (&quot;Jōō 3, 6th day of the 7th month&quot;): A famous priest, Ingen, arrived at Nagasaki from China. His intention was to reform the practice of Buddhism in Japan.
* October 30, 1654 (&quot;Jōō 3, 20th day of the 9th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Kōmyō died of smallpox; and his funeral ceremonies were at on the 15th day of the 10th month.

==Sakoku: Before and after 1653==
Within the Jōō period, Japan was implementing the Sakoku policy which adopted by Tokugawa Bakumatsu. &quot;Sakoku&quot; (鎖国) means closed country in Japanese. Japan was adopting this policy from 1639 to 1868. There was barely any foreign trade from other countries, with exception to Chinese and Dutch merchant. Japanese residences were strictly monitored by the Government. People were not allowed to leave the country, with consequence of death penalty. Foreigners were in the same situation, anyone who attempted to enter Japan&#x27;s territory would be killed by the soldiers right away. The entire country was dictated by Tokugawa government. The Sakoku policy was adopted by the ruler for preventing invaders, and keeping their national characteristics and national religion. This policy was banned after the Edo Period (1603–1868). The country was re-opened to the world in 1868.

<doc id="1164186" wikidata="Q2961803" url="?curid=1164186" title="Bowers Mountains">
<text>Bowers Mountains () is a group of north–south trending mountains in Antarctica, about long and wide, bounded by the coast on the north and by the Rennick Glacier, Canham Glacier, Black Glacier and Lillie Glacier in other quadrants.
They are west of the Usarp Mountains, north of the Freyberg Mountains, northeast of the Concord Mountains, east of the Anare Mountains.

==Exploration and naming==

The seaward end was first sighted in February 1911 from the &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, under Lt. Harry L.L. Pennell, Royal Navy, and was subsequently named &quot;Bowers Hills&quot; in honour of Henry Robertson Bowers who perished with Captain Robert Falcon Scott on their return from the South Pole in 1912. 
The feature was photographed from United States Navy aircraft in 1946-47 and 1960–62, and was surveyed and mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1962–63. 
The name was amended to Bowers Mountains upon USGS mapping which showed the group to be a major one with peaks rising to nearly .

==Location==

The Bowers Mountains extend north into the Pacific Ocean.
The Stuhlinger Ice Piedmont is at the northern end of the mountains.
The Explorers Range runs along the northwest side of the range beside the Rennick Glacier.
Further south the Lanterman Range runs along the side of the Rennick Glacier and its tributary, the Canham Glacier, which defines the southwest limit of the range.
The Alamein Range and Salamander Range are further south.
The Crown Hills form the southern tip of the range, between the Canham Glacier and the Black Glacier to the east, which flows north to join the Lillie Glacier to the east of the Mount Sterling massif.
The Molar Massif is between the Lanterman Range and the Mount Sterling massif.
Further north, the Posey Range forms the eastern edge of the Bowers Mountains, with the Lillie Glacier to its east.

==Major glaciers==
*Rennick Glacier (), a broad glacier, nearly long, which is one of the largest in Antarctica. It rises on the polar plateau westward of Mesa Range and is wide, narrowing to near the coast.
*Canham Glacier (), a tributary glacier about long which drains the northwest part of Evans Névé. The glacier drains northwest between the Alamein Range and Salamander Range and enters the Rennick Glacier westward of Bowers Peak.
*Black Glacier (), a broad tributary to the Lillie Glacier flowing northeast, marking the southeast extent of the Bowers Mountains.
*Lillie Glacier (), a large glacier in Antarctica, about long and wide. It lies between the Bowers Mountains on the west and the Concord Mountains and Anare Mountains on the east, flowing to Ob&#x27; Bay on the coast and forming the Lillie Glacier Tongue.

==Features==
Geographical features include:
*Explorers Range (), a large mountain range, extending from Mount Bruce in the north to Carryer Glacier and McLin Glacier in the south.
*Posey Range (), a mountain range in eastern Bowers Mountains, bounded by the Smithson Glacier, Graveson Glacier, Lillie Glacier and Champness Glacier.
*Lanterman Range (), a mountain range about long and wide, forming the southwest part of the Bowers Mountains.
*Crown Hills (), a group of peaks and hills forming the south-east part of the Lanterman Range.
*Molar Massif (), a large mountain massif immediately east of the Lanterman Range.
*Mount Stirling (), a mountain, high.

<doc id="1164188" wikidata="Q7385041" url="?curid=1164188" title="Toronto Metropolitan Students' Union">
<text>The Toronto Metropolitan Students&#x27; Union (TMSU) formerly known as the Ryerson Students&#x27; Union (RSU) is the current students&#x27; union that represents full-time undergraduate students at Toronto Metropolitan University, (known until 2022 as Ryerson University). All full-time students are required to be members and pay a levy. The money is used to fund student groups, events for students and campaigning.

==Board==
The board of directors set the direction and the executive manage the day-to-day operations of the corporation. Students elect 2 to 5 members from each faculty, depending on the size of the faculty, to the board, in addition to having ex-officio student representatives from the university&#x27;s senate, student groups, course unions and residence.

==Equity Service Centres==
The TMSU has eight Equity Service Centres: The Centre for Women &amp; Trans People, The Good Food Centre, BIPOC Students&#x27; Collective, Access TMU, The Queer Space, Centre for Safer Sex &amp; Sexual Violence Support, SHIFT Centre and the Trans Collective. These centres serve as a space for students from different marginalized backgrounds to come together and organize equity and social justice initiatives, events, and campaigns.

In 2010, the board of directors voted to change the name from &quot;Community Service Groups&quot; to &quot;Equity Service Centres&quot;.

==Controversy==
The RSU has been extensively criticized for its equity centre policies and for banning a men&#x27;s issues student group on campus. In 2015, former RSU vice-president education Jesse Root was accused of deleting emails in violation of Ontario&#x27;s privacy laws.
==Ram Ganesh misuse of funds controversy==
On January 24, 2019, photos of credit card statements belonging to RSU President Ramganesh Ragupathy (Ram Ganesh) were obtained and published on Facebook by university political group Rhinoceros Party. The statements alleged frivolous spending by Ganesh of over $250,000, including transactions for alcohol, a casino, various bars and nightclubs, hotel rooms, and at a sporting goods store.

In response to ongoing turmoil at the union involving both the above scandal and an inability to renegotiate a new operating agreement, Toronto Metropolitan University terminated its 1986 operating agreement with the union and declared that it would no longer recognize the union as the official student government for full-time undergraduate and graduate students on campus. The courts ordered an injunction preventing the university from severing the agreement.

<doc id="1164199" wikidata="Q6971381" url="?curid=1164199" title="Advocates for Trans Equality">
<text>The National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE) is a nonprofit social equality organization founded in 2003 by transgender activist Mara Keisling in Washington, D.C. The organization works primarily in the areas of policy advocacy and media activism with the aim of advancing the equality of transgender people in the United States. Among other transgender-related issue areas, NCTE focuses on discrimination in employment, access to public accommodations, fair housing, identity documents, hate crimes and violence, criminal justice reform, federal research surveys and the Census, and health care access.

On October 1, 2024, the organization rebranded as Advocates for Trans Equality (A4TE) after merging with the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund.

==History==
In 2002, then-co-chair of the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, Mara Keisling, moved to Washington, D.C., after recognizing the need for a professional activist presence in Washington for transgender people. With the support of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, Keisling established the National Center for Transgender Equality in 2003.

In the years since, NCTE has had numerous political victories. Early on, Keisling and NCTE led &quot;United ENDA&quot;, a coalition of over 400 LGBTQ rights organizations lobbying for a version of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act that had explicit protections for transgender individuals. Although the bill ultimately failed to pass, it was the first-ever transgender-inclusive legislation to be proposed to the U.S. Congress and yielded the first-ever Congressional hearing on transgender rights issues.

Under the Obama administration, NCTE successfully lobbied for at least 150 federal policy changes on issues including health care access and non-discrimination in health services; federal employment protections; homeless and emergency shelter access; non-discrimination in federally-subsidized housing; and open military service for transgender service members. Also among these policy victories was the modification of State Department regulations, allowing transgender citizens to change the gender marker on their passport without necessarily having undergone genital reconstruction surgery.

In late 2019, NCTE made national news when two thirds of the staff resigned in protest of the executive team. Following the resignations of employees, an unfair labor practice charge was filed by the Nonprofit Professional Employees Union against NCTE. The National Labor Relations Board issued a dismissal letter for the complaint in April 2020.

In January 2024, NCTE announced that they would merge with the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund to form a new organization, Advocates for Trans Equality (A4TE). On October 1, 2024, the merger occurred, and A4TE was created.

===Mission===
NCTE&#x27;s mission statement reads:

== Prominent staff ==

=== Mara Keisling ===
Mara Keisling is the founding executive director of NCTE. She is a trans woman and began transitioning in her early 40s. In addition to her work as executive director of NCTE, Keisling is a founding board member of the Stonewall Democracy Fund. She has also served as co-chair of the Pennsylvania Gender Rights Coalition, on the board of directors of LGBTQ youth group Common Roads, and on the steering committee of the Statewide Pennsylvania Rights Coalition. In recognition of her activism, Keisling has won awards from PFLAG; the Equality Forum; GayLaw; the Transgender Law Center; the Harvard Bisexual, Gay, Lesbian, Transgender and Supporters Alliance; and Out for Work, among others. Keisling was subject to controversy and was called to resign as Executive Director of NCTE in 2019. In 2021, the organization announced that Keisling decided to not renew her contract, and that the board of directors had selected Deputy Executive Director Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen as her successor.

=== Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen ===
Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen is the current Executive Director of NCTE. He is a transgender policy, advocacy and messaging expert. As a transgender man, his wide-ranging experience in the LGBTQ movement has covered field organizing, leadership development, fundraising, and media advocacy. He previously worked with Freedom for All Americans, GLAAD, the Transgender Law Center, Gender Justice LA, and the National LGBTQ Task Force. In past roles, he trained thousands of volunteers to canvass and phone bank on groundbreaking nondiscrimination and marriage equality campaigns, and organized leadership development programs in transgender communities and LGBTQ communities of color, honing new strategies for social change. Most recently, he co-led the successful campaign to update New Hampshire&#x27;s nondiscrimination protections to include transgender Granite Staters. Over the course of his career, he has conducted international Spanish-language interviews, including on Univision, Telemundo, and CNN en Español, as well as English-language interviews with outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, MSNBC, CNN, and Politico. Rodrigo graduated from Brown University and lives in Washington, D.C. He serves of the Board of Directors of AsylumConnect, a non-profit connecting LGBTQ asylum seekers with resources in the US and Canada.

=== Raffi Freedman-Gurspan ===
Raffi Freedman-Gurspan is former director of external relations and former policy advisor at NCTE. Before joining NCTE as policy advisor in 2014, she served as legislative staffer for the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition, LGBT liaison for the City of Somerville, and legislative director for Massachusetts State Representative Carl Sciortino, a Medford Democrat. On August 18, 2015, she was hired by President Barack Obama as Outreach and Recruitment Director in the White House Presidential Personnel Office, becoming the first openly transgender person to work as a White House staffer. He subsequently appointed her as the White House&#x27;s primary LGBT liaison in 2016, making her the first openly transgender person in the role. On April 3, 2017, Freedman-Gurspan rejoined NCTE as director of external relations.

In May 2019, Freedman-Gurspan left NCTE to become Deputy Campaign Director for the All on the Line Campaign, a project with a mission to end gerrymandering.

==Programs==
NCTE works to educate policy makers and the American public about the transgender community and the issues facing it, as well as to lobby Congress and other policy makers to adopt policies that support the rights and human dignity of transgender Americans. In service of this mission, NCTE runs several programs spanning a variety of policy issue areas.

===Policy issues===

NCTE works on a variety of policy issues of significance to the transgender community. These include: state policy agendas; hate crimes and violence; employment non-discrimination; advocating for transgender parents and families of transgender people; health care access; access to homeless and emergency shelters; immigration reform; open military service; criminal justice reform; racial and economic justice; federal research surveys and the Census; travel security procedures and bodily privacy; voting rights; and protections for transgender students from bullying, discrimination, and accommodations exclusions.

In addition to these policy programs, NCTE maintains an ID Documents Center and the Transgender Legal Services Network. The ID Documents Center offers a constantly updated database of federal, state, and territory-based policies regarding name and gender change procedures so that transgender individuals can more easily navigate these complex legal processes. The related Transgender Legal Services Network offers a consortium of over 60 organizations that offer advice, technical support, and legal resources to transgender individuals, many of which undertake pro bono projects. The Network also confers to improve one another&#x27;s organizational capacities and expand their service provisions.

===United ENDA===
NCTE undertook successful work on state and local policies and in getting &quot;gender identity&quot; added to federal hate crimes legislation (which passed in 2009 as the Mathew Shepard and James Byrd Hate Crimes Prevention Act). But its primary initial policy goals were transforming the lesbian and gay rights movement into the LGBTQ rights movement and adding gender identity and expression language to the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which was then pending before Congress and covered only &quot;sexual orientation&quot;.
A significant step toward making the lesbian and gay rights movement more inclusive occurred in 2007, when NCTE and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force led a coalition of more than 425 trans and LGBT groups known as United ENDA, which demanded that Congress not pass ENDA without gender identity protections. Even though no version of ENDA was enacted, the United ENDA campaign was a turning point in LGBTQ activism, leading to the solidification of an LGBTQ movement that was fully committed to trans rights.
ENDA had been the legislative priority for lesbian and gay rights organizations since it was first introduced in 1993, but gender identity protections were not added until 2007. ENDA was replaced in 2015 with the Equality Act, which would ban discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in not just employment, but also in public accommodations, education, housing, and credit. The Equality Act has yet to become law as of 2020.

===ID Documents===
NCTE is increasingly more involved in state advocacy as resources allowed, which included pushing states to make it easier for trans people to change their names and gender markers on identification documents (e.g., driver&#x27;s licenses and birth certificates) and to enact policies requiring health insurance companies and systems (such as Medicaid) to cover transition-related healthcare. NCTE maintains a comprehensive resources on its website to assist trans people with navigating the complex state and local policies on ID document, as well as navigating health care systems to get them to provide transition-related care.

===Won&#x27;t Be Erased===
During the Trump Administration, NCTE was a leader in resisting policy rollbacks from the federal government. In 2018, NCTE launched the &quot;Won&#x27;t Be Erased&quot; campaign in response to a leaked White House memo that outlined a strategy to overturn protections for trans people. To document and raise awareness of the anti-trans actions of the Trump administration, NCTE has also catalogued each loss on its website in a project called &quot;The Discrimination Administration&quot;.

===Transgender Lobby Day===

On March 15, 2004, NCTE partnered with the now-defunct National Transgender Advocacy Coalition to run the first ever Transgender Lobby Day, for which transgender citizens and allies from across the country came to Washington to speak with their Senators and Representatives. Since then, NCTE has organized lobby days every few years consisting of a conference on transgender policy issues and meetings with members of Congress in which participants share their stories and talk about transgender issues. Past lobby days have featured guests from organizations such as the White House Office of Public Engagement, as well as prominent figures such as transgender activist and lawyer Shannon Minter from the National Center for Lesbian Rights, Masen Davis from the Transgender Law Center, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, and former Speaker of the House Rep. Nancy Pelosi. Transgender lobby days frequently draw over 200 participants from nearly every state.

===Reports===

==== National Transgender Discrimination Survey (2008) ====
In 2008, NCTE partnered with the National LGBTQ Task Force and Pennsylvania State University&#x27;s Center for the Study of Higher Education to launch the National Transgender Discrimination Survey (NTDS). Then the largest study of transgender individuals in the United States, the NTDS surveyed 6,450 transgender residents about their experiences of discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, health care, and education, among others. The findings of the NTDS have since informed public policy in the United States, such as at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which based new housing regulations to protect LGBTQ people on the study.

==== U.S. Transgender Survey ====
In 2015, NCTE followed up the NDTS by launching the U.S. Transgender Survey (USTS), the largest study of transgender individuals in the United States at that time. Nearly 28,000 transgender residents participated in the survey, which covered a broad range of topics pertaining to family life, health, housing, income, employment, discrimination, harassment and violence, military service, political participation, and others. In addition to the full national report, NCTE has released various breakout reports focusing on specific states. As of February 2024, breakout reports for 43 states have been released.

Another U.S. Trans Survey followed in 2022, with over 92,000 responses, surpassing the 2015 study as the largest nationwide survey of trans people. A report on early findings was released in February 2024.

=== Media ===
NCTE is a frequent source of analysis and commentary for both American and international news media. In her capacity as executive director of NCTE, Keisling has appeared as a guest on news channels such as CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, and MSNBC. She is frequently quoted in newspapers, news magazines, and online news sources, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, BuzzFeed, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. Keisling has also published op-eds in numerous outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, NBC, CNN, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. NCTE&#x27;s former director of policy, Harper Jean Tobin, is similarly often quoted by news media including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Reuters, PBS, and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and has published op-eds in publications such as &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The organization also maintains its own blog on Medium.

== Action Fund ==
In October 2017, NCTE launched an affiliated 501(c)(4) organization, the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund. Because of its tax status, the Action Fund can endorse and oppose political candidates, which NCTE cannot do as a 501(c)(3) organization. At launch, the Action Fund endorsed three transgender candidates for public office: Phillipe Cunningham and Andrea Jenkins, who are running for seats on the Minneapolis City Council, and Danica Roem, who is running for the 13th District seat in Virginia&#x27;s House of Delegates. 
In 2018, the NCTE Action Fund endorsed Brianna Titone for Colorado State Representative and Gerri Cannon for New Hampshire State Representative, who are the second and third sitting transgender state representatives (after Danica Roem became the first in Virginia in 2017). NCTE Action Fund also endorsed Alexandra Chandler for U.S. House of Representatives (MA-3), Christine Hallquist for Governor of Vermont, Kim Coco Iwamoto for Lieutenant Governor of Hawai&#x27;i, Amelia Marquez for Montana House of Representatives, and Melissa Sklarz for New York State Assembly.
In 2019, the NCTE Action Fund endorsed Danica Roem for the second time, for her successful re-election to the Virginia House of Delegates.
On May 5, 2020, the NCTE Action Fund made its first-ever Presidential endorsement: Joe Biden for President of the United States.
The organization also provides resources addressing the specific needs of transgender voters.

== Controversy ==
In 2019, the majority of NCTE staff members resigned from the organization, citing concerns about workplace culture and the treatment of marginalized members of the trans community. Staff had previously called for the resignation of Executive Director Mara Keisling and Deputy Director Lisa Mottet in September 2019, but at the time, both executive leaders refused to resign. The National Labor Relations Board issued a dismissal letter for the complaint in April 2020.

<doc id="1164201" wikidata="Q5158827" url="?curid=1164201" title="Concord Mountains">
<text>Concord Mountains is a group name applied to a complex system of ranges in northwest Victoria Land, Antarctica.
They comprise the Everett Range, Mirabito Range, King Range, Leitch Massif, East Quartzite Range and West Quartzite Range.
They are north of the Admiralty Mountains, northeast of the Victory Mountains, southeast of the Bowers Mountains and south of the Anare Mountains.

==Exploration and naming==

The Concord Mountains were mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy aerial photographs from 1960–63. 
The name &quot;Concord&quot; was chosen by the northern party of the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), which explored the area in 1963–64, in honor of international harmony in Antarctica, and in particular for the fact that five nations participated in the region&#x27;s exploration.

==Location==
The Leitch Massif and King Range in the west of the Concord Mountains lie to the southeast of the Bowers Mountains, from which they are separated by the Black Glacier, a tributary of the Lillie Glacier.
The Mirabito Range and Everett Range in the northwest of the Concord Mountains lie to the east of the Bowers Mountains, from which they are separated by the Lillie Glacier.
The Ebbe Glacier, a tributary of the Lillie Glacier, runs to the north and east of the Everett Range, separating it from the Anare Mountains to the northeast and from Robinson Heights in the Admiralty Mountains to the east. Further south the Homerun Range of the Admiralty Mountains lies to the east of the Mirabito Range.
The Victory Mountains extend across the south of the range between the Jutland Glacier and the Tucker Glacier.
The East Quartzite Range and West Quartzite Range in the southeast of the Concord Mountains are to the north of the Victory Mountains and east of the Salamander Range of the Freyberg Mountains.

==Glaciers==
* Lillie Glacier , a large glacier in Antarctica, about long and wide. It lies between the Bowers Mountains on the west and the Concord Mountains and Anare Mountains on the east, flowing to Ob&#x27; Bay on the coast and forming the Lillie Glacier Tongue.
* Black Glacier , a broad tributary to the Lillie Glacier flowing northeast, marking the southeast extent of the Bowers Mountains.
* Ebbe Glacier , a tributary glacier about long, draining northwest from the Homerun Range and Robinson Heights, and then west-northwest between the Everett Range and Anare Mountains into Lillie Glacier. This feature saddles with Tucker Glacier, the latter draining southeast to the Ross Sea.
* Rawle Glacier , a tributary glacier in the Concord Mountains, flowing northwest between Leitch Massif and King Range into the Black Glacier.
* Houliston Glacier , a tributary glacier between Neall Massif and West Quartzite Range, flowing northwest into Black Glacier.
* Greenwell Glacier , a major tributary glacier, long, draining northwest between Mirabito Range and Everett Range to enter Lillie Glacier below Mount Works.
* Jutland Glacier , a broad tributary glacier, long and wide, in the Victory Mountains. It drains northwest from a common divide with Midway Glacier to join the flow of the Greenwell Glacier northwest of Boss Peak.

==Ranges==

* Everett Range , a rugged, mainly ice-covered range nearly long between Greenwell Glacier and Ebbe Glacier.
* Mirabito Range , a narrow, northwest-trending mountain range, long and wide that lies between the upper part of Lillie Glacier and the Greenwell Glacier.
* King Range , a mountain range, long and wide, in northwestern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The range is bounded on the west by Rawle Glacier and Leitch Massif, on the northwest by Black Glacier and on the NE and east by the head of Lillie Glacier.
* East Quartzite Range , a mountain range, long, forming a subordinate southwest unit of the King Range. These mountains lie approximately east of the nearby West Quartzite Range.
* West Quartzite Range , a range, the western of two parallel quartzite ranges, situated at the east side of Houliston Glacier.

<text>The 1970 VFL season was the 74th season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria.

The season featured twelve clubs, and ran from 4 April until 26 September. It was the first season to play comprise a 22-game home-and-away season, which became the standard for the following fifty years, and which was followed by a finals series featuring the top four clubs. The season saw the opening of the league&#x27;s privately owned stadium, VFL Park, in Mulgrave.

The premiership was won by the Carlton Football Club for the tenth time, after it defeated by ten points in the 1970 VFL Grand Final. A crowd of 121,696 attended the match, the all-time record for the highest Australian rules football crowd.

==Background==
In 1970, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus two substitute players, known as the 19th man and the 20th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances.

Teams played each other in a home-and-away season of 22 rounds; matches 12 to 22 were the &quot;home-and-way reverse&quot; of matches 1 to 11.

Once the 22 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1970 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page–McIntyre system.

==Finals series==

===Semi-finals===

===Preliminary final===
===Grand final===

==Consolation Night Series Competition==
The consolation night series were held under the floodlights at Lake Oval, South Melbourne, for the teams (5th to 12th on ladder) out of the finals at the end of the home and away rounds.

Final: 13.17 (95) defeated Melbourne 13.15 (93).

==Season notes==
* Unhappy with their treatment over the three seasons they spent at Princes Park, Fitzroy moved their home ground to the Junction Oval in St Kilda.
* VFL Park was opened. As part of accommodating the neutral ground, the 1970 VFL season was extended to 22 rounds, with each of the 12 clubs to play three games at VFL Park. The idea was that six clubs would play ten games on their home grounds, and the other six would play nine home ground matches. In 1971, the home ground advantage would be reversed, so that those teams that had nine home ground games in 1970 would play ten home ground games in 1971 and vice versa.
*On Monday 9 March, the Victoria representative team played a match under Gaelic football rules against the 1969 All-Ireland Senior football champions, Kerry, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Kerry 4-11 defeated Victoria 2–10.
* Essendon&#x27;s Don McKenzie, Geoff Gosper, Darryl Gerlach, Geoff Pryor, and Barry Davis, and Collingwood&#x27;s Len Thompson and Des Tuddenham did not play in Round 1 due to separate disputes over player payments with their respective clubs (see Dispute over player payments).
* The second half of the Round 1 match between Richmond and Fitzroy, played at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, 5 April 1970, was attended by Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales (now Charles III) and Anne, Princess Royal, who were present as part of the 1970 royal tour commemorating the bicentenary of the first voyage of James Cook. The royals met the players on the field at half time and were present to unfurl Richmond&#x27;s 1969 premiership flag before watching the second half. The match was specially scheduled to accommodate the royals&#x27; itinerary; it was the first VFL match played on a Sunday, and the second half was televised live in spite of the rules which normally precluded live telecasts of VFL matches.
* In Round 10, Collingwood trailed St Kilda by 60 points late in the second quarter, before coming back in the second half to win by seven points. It set a new record for the biggest comeback in VFL history which stood until 1999. The half-time deficit of the 52-point deficit remains, as of 2024, the greatest half-time deficit by a winning side.
* The 1970 VFL season was the first in which three full-forwards (Alex Jesaulenko, Peter McKenna, and Peter Hudson) kicked at least 100 goals in a home-and-away season.
* South Melbourne ended the second-longest finals drought in league history (twenty-four seasons) by finishing fourth, making the finals for the first time since 1945.
* In Round 5, Ted Whitten played his 321st senior VFL game, breaking the record set by Dick Reynolds. Whitten retired after this match.
* On Monday 31 August HSV-7 broadcast the first live Brownlow Medal count.
* In the 1970 Second Semi-Final, Carlton&#x27;s Syd Jackson was reported for striking Collingwood defender Lee Adamson. Carlton president George Harris, eager to have Jackson in his Grand Final team, devised the strategy of having the club&#x27;s advocate to assert to the tribunal (on Jackson&#x27;s behalf) that Jackson had been provoked by an extended series of racial taunts from Adamson, including repeatedly calling him &quot;Sambo&quot; and, furthermore, stating that Jackson would respond in the same way to any future vilification. The tribunal took the stance that the VFL had to be seen to protect its only top-level Aboriginal footballer at the time, and they immediately exonerated him, without hearing Adamson&#x27;s side of the story, stating that Jackson had no case to answer.
* The 1970 Grand Final between and was considered to be the most memorable Grand Final in VFL/AFL history. Collingwood had a great lead over Carlton during most of the game, however Carlton managed to come back and win the Grand Final by 10 points.

<text>The Mirabito Range () is a narrow, northwest-trending mountain range, long and wide that lies between the upper part of Lillie Glacier and the Greenwell Glacier in northern Victoria Land, Antarctica. The range is part of the Concord Mountains.
==Exploration and naming==
The range was mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from surveys and United States Navy aerial photography, 1960-63. It was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for Lieutenant Commander John A. Mirabito, U.S. Navy, staff Meteorological Officer on four Deep Freeze Operations, 1955-59.

==Location==
The northwest tip of the Mirabito Range is east of the Lillie Glacier and southwest of the Greenwell Glacier at the point where it joins the Lillie Glacier.
The range extends in a south-southeast direction between these two glaciers.
In the extreme south it is west of the Jutland Glacier, which joins the Greenwell Glacier.
Features include Austin Peak in the center of the range, Mount Shute further south and Thompson Peak at the south end.

==Features==
===Austin Peak===
A peak in the east-central portion of the Mirabito Range. Named by the northern party of NZGSAE, 1963-64, for William T. Austin, USARP Representative at McMurdo Station, 1963-64, who organized support for the New Zealand field parties.

===Mount Shute===
A mountain, , standing southeast SE of Austin Peak in Mirabito Range. Mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos 1960 63. Named by US-ACAN for Larry R. Shute, USARP meteorologist at Hallett Station, 1963-64.

===Red Rock Peak===
A peak rising to about north-northwest of Thomson Peak in the south part of Mirabito Range, Victoria Land. The name is descriptive of the rock at the peak and was given by Bradley Field, geologist, NZGS, a member of a NZARP geological party to the area, 1980-81.

===Thomson Peak===
A peak, high, situated southeast of Mount Shute at the extreme south limit of Mirabito Range. Named by the northern party of NZGSAE, 1963-64, for Robert B. Thomson of New Zealand, scientific leader at Hallett Station, 1960; officer-in-charge at Wilkes Station, 1962; deputy leader at Scott base, 1963-64.

<text>The Acadia Students&#x27; Union represents the undergraduate students at Acadia University in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Canada. They are a member of the Canadian Alliance of Students Associations (CASA) and StudentsNS (formerly ANSSA).

==History==

The Acadia Students&#x27; Union is a not-for-profit student organization that provides services, events, societies and advocacy work to the students of Acadia University. Founded in 1967, it is an organization led by students in order to provide services and events to the students at Acadia. It consists of over 80 employees and many more volunteers.

The ASU offers many Student Services to help Acadia students have a worthwhile university experience. These services include Off-Campus Housing Assistance, the Safety and Security Shuttle (which helps students get from place to place around campus and off in the evenings) and the Health and Dental Plan. The ASU also hosts the clubs that operate through the ASU, as well as the Internal Organizations like the student-led campus newspaper, The Athenaeum; the campus radio station, Axe Radio; and the Environment and Sustainability Office (AESO). Cajun&#x27;s, the Union operated clothing store is also owned and operated by the ASU with the proceeds from these sales going directly back to the students.

==Students&#x27; Union Building==

The Acadia Students&#x27; Union operates out of the Students&#x27; Union Building (SUB) located on Highland Avenue in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. This location, central to the Acadia University campus, is owned and operated by the union.

Inside the building is located several ASU run services as well as offices for the ASU Executive, all of the Internal Organizations, and the university office of Residence Life. The services provided inside the Students&#x27; Union Building are the Union Market convenience store, Perkin&#x27;s Cafe (named after the 12th President of Acadia University), Cajuns Clothing Store, the Axe Lounge, and the Sexual Health Resource Centre. The building also includes an Information Desk which offers postal services, bus tickets, and dry cleaning.

The Axe Lounge, which is the only on-campus bar for students, is set to undergo renovations over the summer of 2016. It was last renovated in 2014 in a joint fundraising effort between the ASU and the 2014 Grad Class to help make the Students&#x27; Union Building more accessible (the lounge previously could not be accessed by anyone in a wheelchair). This second renovation is set to be much more ambitious and could cost upwards of two million dollars to complete. The renovation was decided by referendum during the 2016 ASU General Election which it passed. Construction is set to begin during April 2016. The goal is to help offset these costs through an increase in union fees. On the cost per student, The Athenaeum reported &quot;Part of this cost will be incurred through ASU student union dues, at a rate of fifteen dollars per student per semester for the first five years of operation, and then changing to a total of twenty-five dollars per semester per student.&quot;

The new Axe Lounge will aim to be a student hub with extended hours during the day and bolstered services. The kitchen which currently operates through The Axe Handle grill will be moved into the lounge and will offer a full menu during the day and increased employment opportunities for students.

==Students&#x27; Representative Council==

The Students&#x27; Representative Council (SRC) is the governing body of the Acadia Students&#x27; Union. As such, the legislative authority of the organization and its power are governed by the ASU Constitution and By-Laws. The SRC is made up of elected and appointed members from all areas of the Acadia community. These include the Students&#x27; Union Executive, the Office of the chairperson, a Diversity &amp; Inclusion Representative, Board of Governors Representative, Faculty Representatives, and Councillors.

The Office of the chairperson is responsible for the effective and efficient execution of all Council and Committee meetings and ensuring that the student body is kept apprised of any important Council decisions and opportunities to get involved. The chairperson for the 2017/2018 academic year is Oliver Jacob.

While the SRC makes overarching policy decisions for the Union, the ASU executive is tasked with its day-to-day governance and is made up of five members detailed below.

===President of the Union===

The primary function of the president of the ASU is to oversee the actions of their executive and to serve as the public face of the union. As such, they serve as the chief executive officer of the union and are &quot;responsible to the S.R.C. for efficient and proper administration of the Union&quot;

The position of ASU President for the 2023–2024 academic year is held by Sadie McAlear. The president is currently completing an undergrad of professional studies in community development. She is passionate about provincial and federal advocacy and is the Vice-Chair of Students Nova Scotia as well as Chair of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations. 

===Vice President Events and Promotions===
The Vice President Communications within the ASU is responsible for all advertising and promotion of union events within the university. They are the official press liaison of the union and as such have to prepare an effective communication strategy at the beginning of each academic year. They are also responsible for overseeing all clubs and societies within the ASU with the exception of Internal Organizations.

The position of ASU Vice President Events and Promotions for the 2023–2024 academic year is held by Sam Taylor. Sam is a third-year psychology student passionate about student advocacy and is the former ASU Community Relations representative. 

===Vice President Student Life===
The Vice President Programming is responsible for coordinating ASU sanctioned events on campus. These include Welcome Week (&quot;Frosh Week&quot;), Winter Carnival, the Student Leadership Awards, and &quot;Other Union events or activities as determined by the Executive or by Council.&quot; The VPP is also in charge of liaisons between the ASU and all internal organizations as well as the coordinator of the House Council System.

The position of ASU Vice President of Student Life for the 2023–2024 academic year is held by Genna Beed. 

===Vice President Academic &amp; External===
The ASU Vice President Academic serves the ASU in Academic matters and acts &quot;as a liaison between the Union and the offices of the University Vice President Academic, the Registrar, Admissions, Student Accounts, Financial Aid, Career Services, the Learning Commons, and the Student Resource Centre&quot;. They also represent the union as the Acadia delegate for external lobbying organizations. The Vice President Academic from Acadia during 2012–2013, Kyle Power, served as chairperson of StudentsNS as part of filling these duties.

The position of ASU Vice President Academic and External for the 2023–2024 academic year is held by Ben Morris.

===Vice President Finance and Operation===
The Vice President Finance is responsible for the supervision of all funds that are held by the ASU and manage the accounts of students association and House Councils to ensure they are in good order. In addition, they must monitor all expenditure and revenue streamline within the union and approve all purchases made by members of the Acadia Students&#x27; Union. This position also requires to contact a number of business owners based on the sponsorship with the ASU, ensure they recognize us as value provides.

The position of ASU Vice President, Finance and Operation for the 2023–2024 academic year is held by Bradley Thibeau, a fourth-year finance student at Acadia University. Bradley&#x27;s studies are primarily focused on financial crises and economic downturns. He applies his academic insights to effectively oversee and optimize the ASU&#x27;s financial health.

===Former ASU Executive Teams===

In 2011, the ASU reconfigured the makeup of the ASU Executive. The result was a new, five member executive designed to be more effective at governing the ASU.

The ASU also enacted further updates to position titles and descriptions in late 2016. Each executive team since that reconfiguration can be found in the table below.

==Internal Organizations==

After a review of Internal Organizations in 2014, the Acadia Students&#x27; Union offers ten official Internal Organizations that receive funding from the ASU Budget. These organizations are beholden to more restrictions than other ratified clubs and societies and have been deemed to produce a service to students at Acadia.

===Acadia Graduate Students&#x27; Society===

The Acadia Graduate Students (AGS) is an Internal Organization committed to advocating for graduate student concerns at Acadia. AGS is composed of the President and a faculty representative from Arts, Science and Professional Studies. The association also has counsellors at large, who can be involved but not as voting members. AGS also serves the graduate students at Acadia by striving to aid in the provision of a positive recreational and academic environment.

High turnover of graduate students due to program completion leaves AGS in the hands of each successive graduate student body. With the support of the ASU, the AGS Executive and council determine the year&#x27;s focus and activities.

===Axe Radio===

The online radio station serves to benefit Acadia University, Acadia&#x27;s students, and the community of Wolfville by strengthening communication between Acadia and the community of Wolfville as well as inter-student communication. The radio strives to provide a supplemental outlet for free artistic, cultural, and socio-political expression, entertainment, and discussion of controversial material within quality, thought-provoking programming in a manner conducive to free thought and open debate.

The radio can be tuned-in to online from anywhere on or off campus, or heard in the Students&#x27; Union Building. Any campus or community member is invited to create their own show or help out at any time during the year.

===Community Outreach Acadia===

Community Outreach Acadia is a growing internal organization created and guided by students seeking to make positive and sustainable changes in the Acadia community. The club aims to engage Acadia students within Wolfville by presenting a wide spectrum of volunteer opportunities for students. Some of their initiatives include; Neighbours-Helping-Neighbours, Meal Exchange, and youth centred development programs.

===Acadia Environment and Sustainability Office (AESO)===

The AESO aims to provide an avenue through which students with an interest in environmental issues can learn and grow, as well as educate and reach out to Acadia students, faculty, staff, and the broader Wolfville community. Past projects include: Enviro-Week, Homemade facials night, and The Project Green Challenge.

===The Athenaeum===

The Athenaeum has served as Acadia&#x27;s official student newspaper since 1874. Each week it can be found all across campus, which means it&#x27;s one of the most efficient and anticipated tools for informing the student body. The Athenaeum is also a member of the Canadian University Press (CUP) and adheres to the Charter of Rights and Responsibilities of CUP.

The Athenaeum is created by and for, members of the Acadia Community. The paper strives to provide fair and unbiased commentary on major issues and events in and around Acadia; this includes student events on campus, university events, and happenings in the greater Wolfville area.

===The Axe Yearbook===

Every year, the ASU publishes The Axe Yearbook which serves as the official record for the past year of life at Acadia. Candid shots of students, events, residences, clubs, as well as grad photos are all a part of the book as a means to record the year. All students are encouraged to submit some of their favourite pictures for publication in the book. The Axe is available for pickup from the Information Desk when it is published in the Fall of the following school year.

===Acadia Pride===

Acadia Pride is aimed at providing an outlet for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-gendered, two-spirited, and queer (LGBT2IQ) individuals, as well as friends, and allies.

The group provides support for students, staff, and faculty dealing with issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity. Pride also aims to build a community within Acadia University, and promote its many goals including creating awareness of issues surrounding sexual orientation and promoting an open and safe atmosphere at Acadia University by breaking down the walls of homophobia, trans-phobia and other related issues.

===Centre for Global Education===

The Centre for Global Education (CGE) was founded in 2007 by Acadia students. The CGE seeks to facilitate and promote dialogue between various cultures at Acadia through hosting cultural events and activities. These dialogues seek to increase inclusiveness, and awareness of different cultures within Acadia and the community of Wolfville.
===Mental Health Initiative===

It is the hope of the Acadia Mental Health Initiative to improve the lives of those affected by mental illness. With specific attention to Acadia students, the society strives to do this in a variety of ways empowering students to get involved in ways that are meaningful to them. Most importantly, the combination of all the activities held by the MHS as a whole and its presence on campus have made Acadia a safer place to talk about mental health.

===Acadia Women&#x27;s Centre===
The Women&#x27;s Centre is a feminist organization. Their stated mission is to &quot;support female-identifying students by advocating for women’s issues, empowering female students, and creating a strong sense of community among female-identifying students&quot;.

==Student Association Memberships==

The ASU is an active member of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA) and StudentsNS formerly the Alliance of Nova Scotia Student Associations).

<doc id="1164226" wikidata="Q187927" url="?curid=1164226" title="Markhor">
<text>The markhor (Capra falconeri) is a large wild &quot;Capra&quot; (goat) species native to South Asia and Central Asia, mainly the Karakoram range and the Indian Himalayas. It is listed on the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened since 2015.

The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan, where it is also known as the screw-horn or screw-horned goat. The word &quot;mārkhor&quot; is from Persian word &quot;Markhar&quot;, meaning &quot;Curly&quot;, because of its curly horns comes from both Pashto and classical Persian languages, referencing the ancient belief that the markhor would actively kill and consume snakes. This regional myth is believed to stem from the &quot;snake-like&quot; form of the male markhor&#x27;s horns, twisting and curling like a snake, possibly leading ancient peoples to associate them with snakes.

On 2 May 2024, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 May as the International Day of the Markhor.

==Description==
Markhor stand at the shoulder, are long and weigh from . They have the highest maximum shoulder height among the species in the genus &quot;Capra&quot;, but is surpassed in length and weight by the Siberian ibex. The coat is of a grizzled, light brown to black colour, and is smooth and short in summer, while growing longer and thicker in winter. The fur of the lower legs is black and white. Markhor are sexually dimorphic, with males having longer hair on the chin, throat, chest and shanks. Females are redder in colour, with shorter hair, a short black beard, and are maneless. Both sexes have tightly curled, corkscrew-like horns, which close together at the head, but spread upwards toward the tips. The horns of males can grow up to long, and up to in females. The males have a pungent smell, which surpasses that of the domestic goat.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Markhor are adapted to mountainous terrain, and can be found between in elevation. They typically inhabit shrub forests made up primarily of oaks (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;), pines (&quot;Pinus gerardiana&quot;), and junipers (&quot;Juniperus macropoda&quot;). They are diurnal, and are mainly active in the early morning and late afternoon. Their diets shift seasonally: in the spring and summer periods they graze, but turn to browsing in winter, sometimes standing on their hind legs to reach high branches. The mating season is during winter, when the males fight each other by lunging, locking of horns, and attempting to push each other off balance. The gestation period lasts 135–170 days, and usually results in the birth of one or two kids, and occasionally three. Markhor live in herds, usually numbering nine animals, composed of adult females and their young. Adult males are largely solitary. Adult females and kids comprise most of the markhor population, with adult females making up 32% and kids making up 31%. Adult males comprise 19% of the population, while subadults (males aged 2–3 years) make up 12%, and yearlings (females aged 12–24 months) 9%. Their alarm call closely resembles the bleating of domestic goats. Early in the season the males and females may be found together on the open grassy patches and clear slopes among the forest. During the summer, the males remain in the forest, while the females generally climb to the highest rocky ridges above. In the spring, the females stay closer to cliffs in areas with more rock coverage to provide protection for their offspring. The males stay in higher elevated areas with more access to vegetation for foraging so as to improve their body&#x27;s condition.

===Predators===
Eurasian lynx (&quot;Lynx lynx&quot;), snow leopard (&quot;Panthera uncia&quot;), Himalayan wolf (&quot;Canis lupus chanco&quot;) and brown bear (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;) are the main predators of the markhor. The golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) has been reported to prey upon young markhor. The markhor possess keen eyesight and a strong sense of smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and on high alert; in exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Aegoceros (Capra) Falconeri&quot; was the scientific name proposed by Johann Andreas Wagner in 1839 based on a female specimen from the Indian Himalayas.

Multiple subspecies have been recognized, often based on horn configuration, but it has been shown that this can vary greatly even within the same population confined to one mountain range.
* Astor markhor or Astore markhor (&quot;C. f. falconeri&quot;) 
* Bukharan markhor (&quot;C. f. heptneri&quot;)
* Kabul markhor (&quot;C. f. megaceros&quot;)
* Kashmir markhor (&quot;C. f. cashmiriensis&quot;)
* Sulaiman markhor (&quot;C. f. jerdoni&quot;)

===Astor markhor===
The Astor markhor has large, flat horns, branching widely and then going up nearly straight with only a half turn. It is synonymous with &quot;Capra falconeri cashmiriensis&quot; or Pir Panjal markhor, which has heavy, flat horns, twisted like a corkscrew. The Astor markhor also has a tendency to sexually segregate outside the mating season because of multiple different mechanisms. The females are usually confined to cliffs with less forage coverage, while the males live in areas with a lot more forage coverage. 

Within Afghanistan, the Astor markhor is limited to the east in the high and mountainous monsoon forests of Laghman and Nuristan. In India, this subspecies is restricted to a portion of the Pir Panjal Range in Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Throughout this range, Astor markhor populations are scattered, starting east of the Banihal Pass (50 km from the Chenab River) on the Jammu–Srinagar highway westward to the disputed border with Pakistan. Recent surveys indicate it still occurs in catchments of the Limber and Lachipora Rivers in the Jhelum Valley Forest Division, and around Shupiyan to the south of Srinagar. In Pakistan, the Astor markhor there is restricted to the Indus and its tributaries, as well as to the Kunar (Chitral) River and its tributaries. Along the Indus, it inhabits both banks from Jalkot (Kohistan District) upstream to near the Tungas village (Baltistan), with Gakuch being its western limit up the Gilgit River, Chalt up the Hunza River, and the Parishing Valley up the Astore River. It has been said to occur on the right side of the Yasin Valley (Gilgit District), though this is unconfirmed. The flare-horned markhor is also found around Chitral and the border areas with Afghanistan, where it inhabits a number of valleys along the Kunar River (Chitral District), from Arandu on the west bank and Drosh on the east bank, up to Shoghor along the Lutkho River, and as far as Barenis along the Mastuj River. The largest population is currently found in Chitral National Park in Pakistan.

===Bukharan markhor===
Although the Bukharan markhor or Tajik markhur (&quot;Capra falconeri heptneri&quot;) formerly lived in most of the mountains stretching along the north banks of the Upper Amu Darya and the Pyanj Rivers from Turkmenistan to Tajikistan, two to three scattered populations now occur in a greatly reduced distribution. It is limited to the region between lower Pyanj and the Vakhsh Rivers near Kulyab in Tajikistan (near ), and in the Kugitangtau Range in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan (around ). This subspecies may possibly exist in the Darwaz Peninsula of northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan. Before 1979, almost nothing was known of this subspecies or its distribution in Afghanistan, and no new information has been established in Afghanistan since that time.

===Kabul markhor===
The Kabul markhor (&quot;Capra falconeri megaceros&quot;) has horns with a slight corkscrew, as well as a twist. A junior synonym is &quot;Capra falconeri jerdoni&quot;.

Until 1978, the Kabul markhor survived in Afghanistan only in the Kabul Gorge and the Kohe Safi area of Kapissa, and in some isolated pockets in between. It now lives the most inaccessible regions of its once wider range in the mountains of Kapissa and Kabul Provinces, after having been driven from its original habitat by intensive poaching. In Pakistan, its present range consists only of small isolated areas in Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province and in Dera Ghazi Khan District (Punjab Province). The KPK Forest Department considered that the areas of Mardan and Sheikh Buddin were still inhabited by the subspecies. At least 100 animals are thought to live on the Pakistani side of the Safed Koh range (Districts of Kurram and Khyber).

===Relationship with the domestic goat===
Certain authors have postulated that the markhor is the ancestor of some breeds of domestic goat. The Angora goat has been regarded by some as a direct descendant of the Central Asian markhor. Charles Darwin postulated that modern goats arose from crossbreeding markhor with wild goats. Evidence for markhors crossbreeding with domestic goats has been found. One study suggested that 35.7% of captive markhors in the analysis (ranging from three different zoos) had mitochondrial DNA from domestic goats. Other authors have suggested that markhor may have been the ancestor of some Egyptian goat breeds, based on their similar horns, though the lack of an anterior keel on the horns of the markhor belies any close relationship. The Changthangi domestic goat of Ladakh and Tibet may derive from the markhor. The Girgentana goat of Sicily is thought to have been bred from markhor, as is the Bilberry goat of Ireland. The Kashmiri feral herd of about 200 individuals on the Great Orme limestone headland of Wales are derived from a herd maintained at Windsor Great Park belonging to Queen Victoria.

Fecal samples taken from markhor and domestic goats indicate that there is a serious level of competition for food between the two species. The competition for food between herbivores is believed to have significantly reduced the standing crop of forage in the Himalaya–Karkoram–Hindukush ranges. Domestic livestock have an advantage over wild herbivores since the density of their herds often pushes their competitors out of the best grazing areas, and decreased forage availability has a negative effect on female fertility.

==Threats==
Hunting for meat as a means of subsistence or trade in wildlife parts adds to the growing problem for wildlife managers in many countries. Poaching, with its indirect impacts as disturbance, increasing fleeing distances and resulting reduction of effective habitat size, is by far the most important factor threatening the survival of the markhor populations. The most important types of poachers seem to be local inhabitants, state border guards, the latter usually relying on local hunting guides, and Afghans, illegally crossing the border. Poaching causes fragmentation of the population into small islands where the remaining subpopulations are prone to extinction. The markhor is a valued trophy hunting prize for its spiral horns. The Pakistani government issued several tags in an attempt to save the species, which since the introduction of hunting the species has seen a remarkable rebound. The continuing declines of markhor populations finally caught the attention of the international community.

===Hunting===

In British India, markhor were considered to be among the most challenging game species, because of the danger involved in stalking and pursuing them in high, mountainous terrain. According to Arthur Brinckman in his &quot;The Rifle in Cashmere&quot;, &quot;a man who is a good walker will never wish for any finer sport than ibex or markhoor shooting&quot;. Elliot Roosevelt wrote of how he shot two markhor in 1881, his first on 8 July, his second on 1 August. Although it is illegal to hunt markhor in Afghanistan, they have been traditionally hunted in Nuristan and Laghman Provinces, and this may have intensified during the War in Afghanistan. In Pakistan, hunting markhor is legal as part of a conservation process: expensive hunting licenses are available from the Pakistani government that allow the hunting of old markhors, which are no longer good for breeding purposes. In India, it is illegal to hunt markhor but they are poached for food and for their horns, which are thought to have medicinal properties. Markhor have also been successfully introduced to private game ranches in Texas. Unlike the aoudad, blackbuck, nilgai, ibex, and axis deer, however, markhor have not escaped in sufficient numbers to establish free-range wild populations in Texas.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources currently classifies the markhor as a near threatened species, because of its relatively small population (2013 estimate: ~5,800 individuals), the absence of a projected total population decline, and its reliance on ongoing conservation efforts to maintain population levels. There are reservations in Tajikistan to protect the markhors. In 1973, two reservations were established. The Dashtijum Strict Reserve (also called the Zapovednik in Russian) offers markhor protect across 20,000 ha. The Dashtijum Reserve (called the Zakasnik in Russian) covers 53,000 ha. Though these reserves exist to protect and conserve the markhor population, the regulations are poorly enforced making poaching common as well as habitat destruction. Although markhors still face ongoing threats, recent studies have shown considerable success with regards to the conservation approach. The approach began in the 1900s when a local hunter was convinced by a hunting tourist to stop poaching markhors. The local hunter established a conservancy that inspired two other local organizations called Morkhur and Muhofiz. The two organizations expect that their conversations will not only protect, but allow them to sustainably exploit the markhor species. This approach has been effective compared to the protection of lands that lack enforcement and security. In India, the markhor is a fully protected (Schedule I) species under Jammu and Kashmir&#x27;s Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1978.

==In culture==
The markhor is the national animal of Pakistan. It was one of the 72 animals featured on the World Wide Fund for Nature Conservation Coin Collection in 1976. Markhor marionettes are used in the Afghan puppet shows known as &quot;buz-baz&quot;. The markhor has also been mentioned in a Pakistani computer-animated film known as &quot;Allahyar and the Legend of Markhor&quot;.

===Etymology===
The name is thought to be derived from Persian language — a conjunction of (, &quot;snake, serpent&quot;) and the suffix (, &quot;-eater&quot;), interpreted to represent the animal&#x27;s alleged ability to kill snakes, or as a reference to its corkscrew-like horns, which are somewhat reminiscent of coiling snakes.

In folklore the markhor is believed to kill and eat serpents. Thereafter, while chewing the cud, a foam-like substance comes out of its mouth that drops on the ground and dries. This foam-like substance is sought after by the local people, who believe it is useful in extracting the poison from snakebites.

<doc id="1164240" wikidata="Q8058327" url="?curid=1164240" title="Young Nick's Head">
<text>Young Nick&#x27;s Head / Te Kurī is a headland at the southern end of Tūranganui-a-Kiwa / Poverty Bay in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The area is the landing place of the Horouta and Te Ikaroa-a-Rauru waka which carried Māori settlers to the region around 1350 AD. In Māori, the promontory is named Te Kuri o Pāoa (alternatively known as Te Kuri, or Te Kuri a Pawa).

The settlement of Muriwai is located just inland.

==Name==
Young Nick&#x27;s Head was the first land sighted by the crew of Captain James Cook&#x27;s ship, &quot;Endeavour&quot; on Friday 6 October 1769. Cook promised a reward to the first crewman to sight land and this reward was delivered to 12-year-old Nicholas Young, assistant to the ship&#x27;s surgeon, in the form of two gallons of rum and the name of a prominent landmark.

Prior to Cook&#x27;s arrival, the headland was known to Māori as Te Kuri o Pāoa, which translates to &quot;The Dog of Pāoa&quot;. Māori legends recount that Pāoa lost his kurī (Māori dog) in the Poverty Bay area and the dog is still there waiting for his master to return. It is said at dawn the white cliffs resemble the outline of a dog in a crouching position.

==History==
Nick&#x27;s Head Station is a 661 hectare property consisting of the headland and its surrounding coastal, wetland and farming areas. It was listed for sale in November 2000 and in January 2002 New York financier John Griffin entered into a contract to purchase it for $4 million after an attempt by the Ngāi Tāmanuhiri iwi failed through lack of finance.

Protesting against foreign ownership of the culturally and historically significant land, a group of local Māori led by Tu Wyllie occupied Young Nick&#x27;s Head and staged protests at Parliament. After negotiations with iwi took place, Finance Minister Michael Cullen announced in August 2002 that &quot;Young Nick&#x27;s Head will be protected and the cliffs, pā site and peak of Te Kuri gifted into public ownership as part of a purchase deal for Young Nick&#x27;s Station&quot;. Griffin also agreed upon purchasing the land to establish an open covenant through the Queen Elizabeth II National Trust to protect the remainder of the headland area from commercial development.

The station is currently owned by Griffin. After buying it, he engaged in a long-term plan to restore the area&#x27;s vegetation and wildlife. More than 600,000 trees were planted, 26 hectares of wetlands were restored, and a 2-metre-high predator-proof fence was constructed as native species such as tuatara, blue penguin and wētā were reintroduced. In 2005 Ecoworks, an ecological restoration company in Gisborne, successfully used solar-powered, acoustic-attraction methods and artificial burrows to establish breeding colonies of six pelagic seabird species at Young Nick&#x27;s Head which had previously been severely affected by human colonisation and the introduction of new predators.

Under the Ngai Tāmanuhiri Claims Settlement Act 2012, Young Nick&#x27;s Head/Te Kuri a Paoa Historic Reserve became a national reserve per section 13 of the Reserves Act 1977 and was renamed Te Kuri a Paoa/Young Nick&#x27;s Head National Historic Reserve.

<text>The United States Student Association (USSA) was an American national student advocacy association. It was founded in 1978, and failed to elect new leadership in 2017. &quot;Years of membership decline, restructuring of grantmaking portfolios in large private foundations, and toxic infighting&quot; led to its operational collapse; tax returns continued to be filed in subsequent years. 

The organization was born in August 1978 during a joint meeting between the National Student Association (NSA), formed in 1947, and the National Student Lobby (NSL), itself originally born of a split in 1971 with the NSA. The membership of both organizations voted overwhelmingly to merge due to overlapping lobbying work and student government-based membership. The merger saw the NSL absorbed by the NSA, and the NSA renamed as the USSA, no new entity was created.

By the mid-1980s, the USSA met annually in Washington, D.C., with several hundred students attending.

In the early 1990s, the USSA advocated on behalf of students being eligible for credit cards and beginning to build credit. It also advocated against rising college tuition costs.

<text>Sir Charles Todd (7 July 1826 – 29 January 1910) worked at the Royal Greenwich Observatory 1841–1847 and the Cambridge University observatory from 1847 to 1854. He then worked on telegraphy and undersea cables until engaged by the government of South Australia as astronomical and meteorological observer, and head of the electric telegraph department.

==Early life and career==
Todd was the son of grocer Griffith Todd and Mary Parker; he was born at Islington, London, the second of five children. Shortly after Charles&#x27;s birth the family moved to Greenwich, where his father set up as a wine and tea merchant. Charles was educated and spent most of his life in Greenwich before moving to Australia.

In December 1841, he entered the service of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, under Sir George Biddell Airy. He was fortunate that his school leaving coincided with the Astronomer Royal being granted special funding to employ an additional four young men as computers to analyse, calibrate and publish a backlog of 80 years of data. While at the Royal Observatory he was, in 1846, one of the earliest observers of the planet Neptune.

He was promoted to Assistant Astronomer at the Cambridge Observatory in November 1847, and officially confirmed in the position the following February. While here he used the recently built Northumberland telescope, and he was the first person to take daguerreotype photographs of the moon through it. While at Cambridge he also gained experience in using the telegraph.

In May 1854, shortly before his appointment to South Australia, he was placed in charge of the newly-formed Galvanic Department at Greenwich. This was to be an extension of work he had done using the electric telegraph at Cambridge.

In February 1855, he accepted the position of Astronomical and Meteorological Observer, and Head of Electric Telegraph Department in South Australia.
 Meteorology was work done by astronomers; it was the recording of data so that the climate in different regions was known. The Royal Observatory was run by the Admiralty. Accurate calculation of time was an important part of the Royal Observatory&#x27;s responsibilities. Greenwich Time had long been used at sea; ship&#x27;s navigators relied on its accuracy to calculate their longitude. 
During Todd&#x27;s time at the Greenwich and Cambridge observatories the railway system was expanding, and the electric telegraph was invented. Faster railway travel, and the need for timetables and signalling systems, necessitated a change from using solar time in different regions to a standardised railway or London time (later Greenwich Mean Time). The electric telegraph made it possible to transmit information, including time signals, almost instantaneously. So the development of the electric telegraph was driven by the requirements of the railways.

At about the time Charles Todd moved to Cambridge, George Airy arranged the connection of the Greenwich Observatory to the nearby telegraph line that was being built by the South Eastern Railway. This gave the observatories access to the electric telegraph, and the railway company access to accurate time.

Once the electric telegraph was in place, the observatory was able to control clocks and time balls at any place there was telegraphic connection. It was also possible to perform a number of astronomical and other experiments. While at Cambridge, Charles Todd was a member of a team that determined the exact degrees of longitude at Greenwich and Cambridge using the electric telegraph.

Todd&#x27;s work as head of the Galvanic Department at Greenwich was to be an extension of his work using the electric telegraph. In particular, it was to transmit electric time signals to slave clocks and time balls, and to co-ordinate simultaneous astronomical or meteorological observations at multiple distant locations.

==Arrival in Adelaide==
Todd, along with his 19-year-old wife Alice Gillam Todd, née Bell, (after whom Alice Springs is named), arrived in Adelaide on 5 November 1855. They were accompanied by Todd&#x27;s assistant, 24-year-old Edward Cracknell and his wife. (Cracknell subsequently became superintendent of telegraphs in New South Wales). On his arrival Todd found that his department was a very small one without a single telegraph line.
His first commission was to erect a telegraph line between Adelaide city centre and Port Adelaide. Such a line had been mooted some years before and, impatient with the lack of action and seeing its commercial possibilities, James Macgeorge installed one privately, running his line down council streets since the Government refused him permission to run it along main roads or the railway easement, on the grounds of unnecessary duplication. His line was working on 26 November 1855 and began commercial operation on 10 December.

Todd&#x27;s line, more direct and technically superior (and far more expensive) was opened in February 1856. To begin, the posts were of uniform size and material — Singapore cedar or Swan River mahogany, 18 feet long or 24 feet where crossing roads, 4 feet into the ground, and uniform appearance — 6 or 7 inches square at the bottom and 5 inches at the top, painted white. Rather than a single wire with earth return, four wires were run, four insulators on each post. Where sandhills had to be crossed, a hardwood crosspiece was bolted to each base so they were impervious to sand drift. A submarine cable was used to cross the Port River, buried in iron pipe where it crossed the shifting sands of the peninsula. Additional equipment included an astronomical observatory in the west Park Lands and a time ball at the Port. The telegraph instruments used were the Henley&#x27;s magnetic indicator, 1848 patent. In February 1857 Todd&#x27;s telegraph office was relocated to Green&#x27;s Exchange, where Macgeorge&#x27;s instrument had been installed, as a more convenient location.

Later that year, the Government purchased Macgeorge&#x27;s line and pulled it down.

In June 1856 he recommended that a line between Adelaide and Melbourne should be constructed. Todd personally rode over much of the country through which the line would have to pass. Todd and Samuel Walker McGowan, his counterpart in Victoria, proceeded to link the two colonies&#x27; telegraph systems near Mount Gambier in July 1858. It was through McGowan, that Todd met Joseph Oppenheimer, a German-born, British businessman and inventor, who would provide assistance to Todd in his future projects, and with whom he would maintain a life-long friendship.

==Overland Telegraph Line==
In 1857 or 1859 Todd conceived the idea of the transcontinental telegraph line from Adelaide to Darwin. Most of the country in between except for the explorations of Charles Sturt and others was unknown, and it was many years before Todd could convince the South Australian government of the practicability of the scheme.

In January 1863 Todd addressed the Adelaide Philosophical Society about the possibility of building telegraph routes that would link to an overseas cable. In 1868 the direct line between Adelaide and Sydney was completed and was used to determine the 141st meridian, the boundary line between South Australia and Victoria. Todd&#x27;s calculations showed it to be 2¼ miles farther east than had previously been determined. This led to the long-drawn-out dispute between the two colonies.

By 1870 it had been decided that the Australian Overland Telegraph Line should be constructed from Port Augusta in the south to Port Darwin in the north, though the other colonies declined to share in the cost. The southern and northern sections of the line were let by contract, and the 1000 miles in between was constructed by the department.

The contractor at the northern fell badly behind and was sacked by overseer William McMinn and Todd had to go to the north himself and finish it, with engineer Patterson. The line was completed on 22 August 1872, but the undersea cable to Darwin had broken and communication with England was not effected until 21 October. After the first messages had been exchanged over the new line, Todd was accompanied by surveyor Richard Randall Knuckey on the return journey from Central Mount Stuart to Adelaide, to be met by an enthusiastic crowd.

His next great work was a line from Port Augusta, South Australia to Eucla in Western Australia – a distance of – in 1876, again surveyed by Knuckey.

in the 1880s, Todd&#x27;s department would replace the rotting poles along the OTL with Oppenheimer&#x27;s patent telescoping poles.

==Postmaster General of South Australia==
In 1870 the Post Office and the Telegraph Department were amalgamated, and Charles Todd was appointed Postmaster General. At this time Todd was busy with the construction of the Overland Telegraph. There were problems with the running of the Post Office culminating in two robberies. Consequently, in 1874 a Government Inquiry was held into the workings of the Post Office. The outcome of the inquiry was positive; Todd was able to implement reforms that improved both the working conditions of Post Office employees and the services provided by them.

He was held in high esteem by his staff, and he continued to control his department with ability.

When the colonies were federated in 1901 it was found that, in spite of its large area and sparse population, South Australia was the only one whose post and telegraphic department was carried on at a profit. Todd continued in office as deputy-postmaster-general until 1905.

==Meteorological work==
Charles Todd was one of the pioneers of meteorology in Australasia. As the Government Meteorological Observer for the Colony of South Australia, he worked with his counterparts in the other British colonies and established the Australia-New Zealand weather observation network. His work in meteorology started with his arrival in South Australia, as he had brought with him a number of meteorological instruments that had been calibrated to instruments at Greenwich.

However, his main contribution to meteorology began with the completion of the Australian and New Zealand telegraph systems in the mid to late 1870s. Being at the centre of the network, Todd used weather observations from all the Colonies to create extensive synoptic charts. In the early 1880s Todd and his staff at the West Terrace Observatory in Adelaide were drawing inter-continental weather charts that had greater geographical reach than any other jurisdiction in the world.
Todd&#x27;s ability to pull together the individual threads of technology, weather science, and a widely dispersed group of weather observers put him in the forefront of the profession. His chief mentor in this field was James Glaisher, one of the founders of the science of meteorology.

Todd is believed to be one of the first meteorologists to suggest that local climate was affected by global phenomena. Todd noted that abnormally high atmospheric pressure in India was matched with similar extremes in Australia, typically resulting in parallel droughts thousands of kilometres apart. This particular phenomenon is now recognised as part of the Southern Oscillation which in turn is part of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These globally linked meteorological phenomena are termed teleconnections and Todd was one of the first to recognise their effect.

One of Todd&#x27;s legacies is the 63-volume Weather Folio collection covering the period 1879–1909. These volumes have been digitally imaged by volunteers of the Australian Meteorological Society in conjunction with the South Australian Regional Office of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. Atmospheric pressure data from these journals has been digitised and sent to the NOAA for inclusion in the International Surface Pressure Databank as part of the ACRE project.

==Government Electrician==
Charles Todd had many responsibilities, but during his lifetime he referred to himself as &quot;Government Electrician&quot;. He promoted the use of electric light in the colony by giving demonstrations of the electric arc lamp, the first in 1860. In 1867 he demonstrated the arc lamp in King William St, lighting up from the Town Hall to North Terrace (about 500m). He was instrumental in having electric lighting installed at the 1887 Adelaide Jubilee International Exhibition, the first in Australia to do so.

Also in 1887, the South Australian Electrical Society was established with Charles Todd as president. He was influential in setting up the first electrical engineering course in SA.

Todd was appointed to a commission to add electric lighting to Parliament House in 1890; he supervised the installation the following year. Two years later the GPO finally had electric light.

In 1899 Todd, with his son-in-law William Henry Bragg, demonstrated a wireless system that could be used over a distance of 4 km; but at this time was too expensive to be put into practice.

Finally, Todd was responsible for drawing up the draft document which would regulate electricity supply in the newly federated Australian states.

==Astronomical work==
Though so much of his time was taken up by the duties of the postal department, Todd did not neglect his work as government astronomer. Using the Adelaide Observatory (completed in 1860), which was thoroughly equipped with astronomical and meteorological instruments, he contributed valuable observations to the scientific world on the transits of Venus in 1874 and 1882, the cloudy haze over Jupiter in 1876, the parallax of Mars in 1878, and on other occasions.

He selected the site of the new observatory for Perth in 1895 and advised on the building and instruments to be obtained. He was the author of numerous papers on scientific subjects, many of which were printed in the &quot;Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;.

==Surveying==
As &quot;Astronomical Observer&quot; Todd was responsible for accurate setting of the position and the time at the colony, these were part of his initial tasks on his appointment.

The precise position of the Adelaide Observatory was calculated by astronomical observations, enabling a standard point for geodetic surveys to be set.

In 1882 the South Australian Institute of Surveyors was established with Charles Todd as its inaugural president.

From 1886 until his retirement in 1905, Todd set and marked the astronomy paper that formed part of the exams for candidates aiming to become licensed surveyors. His best known work in surveying was his participation in setting the boundary line between South Australia and New South Wales that resulted in a call for a change in the existing boundary between South Australia and Victoria. This call led to a lengthy dispute between the two colonies which was finally settled in Victoria&#x27;s favour.
==Other achievements==
The accurate determination of time was achieved by astronomical observations using a transit telescope. The Adelaide Post Office clock was installed in 1875 and it became a key timekeeper for Adelaide.

In his official report to Parliament in 1862 Todd pressed the Government for a time ball to be installed near the port. An accurate signal would be sent by telegraph from the Adelaide Observatory to the port. Time balls were dropped daily at ports so that ship navigators could set their chronometers accurately, a small inaccuracy in a chronometer resulted in large inaccuracies in navigation.

Todd and the Harbour Master made repeated requests for a time ball in the following years. Port Adelaide was visited by more ships after the completion of the Overland Telegraph, and approval by Parliament was eventually given in 1874 to build the time ball at Semaphore. It was completed in 1875, and is believed to have been designed by Todd and manufactured locally.

==Later career==
In 1885 he attended the international telegraphic conference at Berlin, the following year Todd travelled to Great Britain, where he was made an honorary M.A. of the University of Cambridge. In 1889 he was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, London. He was also a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, the Royal Meteorological Society and of the Society of Electrical Engineers. Todd continued in his duties to posts and telegraphs in South Australia, until the newly federated Commonwealth of Australia took over all such services on 1 March 1901 and Todd became a federal public servant at the age of 74. He retired in December 1906, having been over 51 years in the service of the South Australian and Commonwealth governments.

==Death and legacy==
Todd died at his summer home in Semaphore, near Adelaide, on 29 January 1910, and was buried at North Road Cemetery, Adelaide, on 31 January. The Sir Charles Todd Building at the University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes Campus is named after him. The Astronomical Society of South Australia have also named the observatory that houses their 20-inch Jubilee Telescope, the Sir Charles Todd Observatory. Each year the Telecommunications Society of Australia invites a prominent member of the telecommunications industry to present the Charles Todd Oration and awards a medal to the industry high achiever best embodying the pioneer spirit. He has been inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Institute of Engineers Australia.

The ephemeral Todd River and its tributary, the Charles River, in the Northern Territory were named after Todd, and a waterhole in the bed of the Todd River was named Alice Springs for his wife, Alice, and subsequently used for the telegraph station, and later the town.

<doc id="1164248" wikidata="Q2459130" url="?curid=1164248" title="Tucker Glacier">
<text>Tucker Glacier () is a major valley glacier of Victoria Land, Antarctica, about long, flowing southeast between the Admiralty Mountains and the Victory Mountains to the Ross Sea. There is a snow saddle at the glacier&#x27;s head, just west of Homerun Range, from which the Ebbe Glacier flows northwestward.

==Exploration and naming==
Explored by New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE), 1957–58, and named by them after Tucker Inlet, the ice-filled coastal indentation at the mouth of this glacier named by Captain James Clark Ross in 1841.

==Geography==

The upper reaches of the Tucker Glacier south of the Homerun Range saddle with the Greenwell Glacier and Jutland Glacier, in the Lillie Glacier basin.
The Tucker Glacier is fed by the Rastorfer Glacier from the left (north) and then by the Leander Glacier after it has been joined by the Church Glacier.
South of the McGregor Range the Man-O-War Glacier enters from the northeast, combined with the Freimanis Glacier from the east.
Tributaries of the Man-O-War Glacier include the Massey Glacier, Deming Glacier and Fitch Glacier.
Tributaries of the Tucker Glacier from the Admiralty Mountains to the east below the Freimants Glacier include the Tocci Glacier, Helman Glacier, Tyler Glacier, Staircase Glacier, Kelly Glacier and Towles Glacier.

To the south of the Pemmican Step, the Montecchi Glacier enters from the west.
South of that the Pearl Harbor Glacier enters the Tucker Glacier from the west, flowing to the north of the Cartographers Range.
The Muller Glacier is an upper tributary of the Pearl Harbor Glacier, both forming in the Millen Range.
Lower down the Lensen Glacier and DeWald Glacier join the Pearl Harbor Glacier from the south, while the Midway Glacier, McKellar Glacier and Summers Glacier join the Pearl Harbor Glacier from the north.

The Trafalgar Glacier is a major contributor from the west, flowing to the south of the Cartographers Range.

<text>GamePro was an American multiplatform video game magazine media company that published online and print content covering the video game industry, video game hardware and video game software. The magazine featured content on various video game consoles, personal computers and mobile devices. GamePro Media properties included &quot;GamePro&quot; magazine and their website. The company was also a part subsidiary of the privately held International Data Group (IDG), a media, events and research technology group. The magazine and its parent publication printing the magazine went defunct in 2011, but is outlasted by Gamepro.com.

Originally published in 1989, &quot;GamePro&quot; magazine provided feature articles, news, previews and reviews on various video games, video game hardware and the entertainment video game industry. The magazine was published monthly (most recently from its headquarters in Oakland, California) with October 2011 being its last issue, after over 22 years of publication. GamePro&#x27;s February 2010 issue introduced a redesigned layout and a new editorial direction focused on the people and culture of its gaming. Despite the shutdown of U.S. operations, the magazine continues to operate internationally in France, Germany, and Spain.

GamePro.com was officially launched in 1998. Updated daily, the website&#x27;s content included feature articles, news, previews, reviews, screenshots and videos covering video games, video game hardware and the entertainment gaming industry. The website also included user content such as forums, reviews and blogs. In January 2010, the website was redesigned to reflect the same new editorial changes being made in the print magazine. The website was based at Gamepro&#x27;s headquarters in San Francisco from 1998 to 2002 and then in Oakland, California from 2002 to 2011.

== History and establishment ==
&quot;Gamepro&quot; was first established in late 1988 by Patrick Ferrell, his sister-in-law Leeanne McDermott, and the husband-wife design team of Michael and Lynne Kavish. They worked out of their houses throughout the San Francisco Bay Area before leasing their first office in Redwood City, California at the end of 1989. Lacking the cashflow to be able to sustain growth after publishing the first issue, the founding management team sought a major publisher and in 1989 found one with IDG Peterborough, a New Hampshire-based division of the global giant IDG. Led by a merger and acquisition team comprising IDG Peterborough President Roger Murphy and two other executives, Jim McBrian and Roger Strukhoff, the magazine was acquired, then a few months later spun off as an independent business unit of IDG, under the leadership of Ferrell as president/CEO. The later addition of John Rousseau as publisher and editor-in-chief Wes Nihei, as well as renowned artist Francis Mao, established &quot;Gamepro&quot; as a large, profitable worldwide publication. Francis Mao, acting in his role as art director for the nascent GamePro, contracted game illustrator Marc Ericksen to create the premiere cover for the first edition of the magazine. Ericksen would go on to produce five of the first ten covers for GamePro, eventually creating eight in total, and would continue a secondary role creating a number of the double page spreads for the very popular monthly Pro Tips section. The magazine had a monthly circulation of 300,000. 

Over the years, the Gamepro offices have moved from Redwood City (1989–1991) to San Mateo (1991–1998) to San Francisco (1998–2002) and lastly Oakland. In 1993, the company was renamed from Gamepro Inc. to Infotainment World in reflection of its growing and diverse publication lines.

The magazine was known for its editors using comic book-like avatars and monikers when reviewing games. As of January 2004, however, &quot;Gamepro&quot; ceased to use the avatars due to a change in the overall design and layout of the magazine. Meanwhile, editorial voices carried over to the community on its online sister publication, www.gamepro.com.

There was a TV show called &quot;GamePro TV&quot;. The show was hosted by J. D. Roth and Brennan Howard. The show was nationally syndicated for one year, then moved to cable (USA and Sci-Fi) for a second year.

In 1993, Patrick Ferrell sent Debra Vernon, VP of marketing, to a meeting between the games industry and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). Realizing an opportunity, the team at the now-entitled Infotainment World launched E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo. The industry backed E3 and Ferrell partnered with the IDSA to produce the event. It was one of the biggest trade show launches in history.

Early in its lifespan, the magazine also included comic book pages about the adventures of a superhero named Gamepro who was a video game player from the real world brought into a dimension where video games were real to save it from creatures called the Evil Darklings. In 2003, Joyride Studios produced limited-edition action figures of some of the &quot;Gamepro&quot; editorial characters.

&quot;Gamepro&quot; also appeared in several international editions, including France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Turkey, Australia, Brazil and Greece. Some of these publications share the North American content, while some others share only the name and logo but do feature different content.

Early in 2006, IDG Entertainment began to change internally and shift operational focus from a &quot;Print to Online&quot; to &quot;Online to Print&quot; publishing mentality. The first steps; build a large online network of web sites and rebuild the editorial team. Enter: George Jones, industry veteran.

In February 2006, &quot;Gamepro&quot;&#x27;s online video channel, Games.net, launched a series of video-game related shows. The extensive online programming is geared towards an older and more mature audience.

In August 2006, the Gamepro online team spun off a new cheats site, GamerHelp.com. It was shortly followed by a video game information aggregation site, Games.net, and a dedicated gaming downloads site, GameDownloads.com.

Under the new leadership of George Jones, &quot;Gamepro&quot; magazine underwent a massive overhaul in the March 2007 issue. While losing some of the more dated elements of the magazine, the new arrangement focused on five main insertions: HD game images, more reviews and previews per issue, www.gamepro.com community showcase, user contributions and insider news. However the German Gamepro website is still run, however this time, by &quot;GameStar&quot; as their partner, as that website have a message at the top of the screen saying &quot;Partner of GameStar&quot; (Note: This is written in German)

In 2009, Gamepro&#x27;s 20th anniversary coincided with 20-year industry veteran John Davison joining the newly named Gamepro Media team in October 2009 as executive vice president of content. Under Davison&#x27;s direction, the magazine and website were redesigned in early 2010 with an editorial shift toward focusing on the people and culture of gaming. The redesigned magazine and website were met with an enthusiastic audience response.

In addition to announcing the hire of Davison in October 2009, the company also announced an &quot;aggressive growth plan throughout 2009 and beyond, with numerous online media initiatives to deepen consumer engagement and create new opportunities for advertisers.&quot; Plans included partnering with sister company IDG TechNetwork to build a &quot;boutique online network of sites.&quot; The result was the introduction of the Gamepro Media Network.

In September 2010, Gamepro Media announced a new alliance with online magazine &quot;The Escapist&quot; offering marketers joint advertising programs for reaching an unduplicated male audience. The partnership was named the Gamepro Escapist Media Group.

In November 2010, Julian Rignall joined Gamepro Media as its new vice-president of content, replacing John Davison, who resigned in September 2010.

&quot;Gamepro&quot; ended monthly publication after over 22 years with its October 2011 issue. Shortly after that issue, the magazine changed to &quot;Gamepro Quarterly&quot;, which was a quarterly publication using higher quality paper stock as well as being larger and thicker than all of the previous standard magazine issues. &quot;Gamepro Quarterly&quot; hit newsstands within the first half of November 2011. The quarterly endeavor lasted for only one issue before being scrapped. On November 30, it was announced that &quot;Gamepro&quot; as a magazine and a website would be shutting down on December 5, 2011. &quot;Gamepro&quot; then became part of the PC World website as a small section of the site covering the latest video games, run by the PC World staff.

==Content==
=== Main sections ===

In February 2010, the magazine&#x27;s main sections were:-

* Inside: A redesigned table of contents page listing the major pieces and games in the issue.
* From the Editor: A column found at the beginning of the magazine from the editor introducing features or big games covered in that month&#x27;s issue.
* Inbox: User feedback and letter of the month.
** Art Attack: Reader art sent into the magazine. That month&#x27;s best art would win a game-related prize.
* Editorials: Articles on varying topics by freelance writers and individuals working in the game industry.
* Spawn Point: Front of magazine sections featuring behind-the-scenes game news and insights, interviews, game previews and a calendar of &quot;gamer-culture events&quot;.
* The Bonus Level: A short guide to &quot;essential geek gear&quot;, including video game releases, books and game-related items for sale at various websites.
* Features: Any cover stories or featured games/issues that warrant a separate article would be told here.
* Reviews: This section was initially named &quot;ProViews&quot; and later renamed to &quot;ProReviews&quot;. The reviews format changed over the years, although the original basic format remained the same: One reviewer speaks for the entire &quot;Gamepro&quot; staff about a particular game. The magazine initially began by giving each platform its own section of reviews. Near the end of 2005, &quot;Gamepro&quot; changed this format to have only one review for any game released on more than one platform, describing any differences that one platform may have over another with that particular game, and giving separate scores for each platform&#x27;s version of the game. During 2006, another aspect of the reviews debuted, called &quot;Key Moment&quot;, in which the reviewer names one particular instance or a standout piece of the game that led them to the decision they made in a short, one sentence description. &quot;Key Moment&quot; was eventually replaced by &quot;Pros&quot; and &quot;Cons&quot;, found with the review score, which briefly list any issues that stand out with the game, both good and bad.
* Parting Shot: With the major overhaul of the magazine in the February 2010 issue, Opening Shots was dropped, and Parting Shot went from being art from a particular game showcased at the back of the magazine, to a look back at the issue of Gamepro that appeared that month 10 years ago.

=== Retired sections ===
* Opening Shots/Parting Shot: Use of higher quality HD images and bigger, more detailed screen shots throughout the magazine. &quot;Opening Shots&quot; is a new screen grab gallery at the front of the magazine, while &quot;Parting Shot&quot; is art from a game showcased at the back of the magazine.
* The Hub: Section dedicated to the Gamepro.com online community. Back of the magazine highlights of reader reviews, comments, new &quot;Ask the Pros&quot; question of the month, community leaders profile highlights, featured forum threads and the new Head2Head: User feedback and letter of the month. Every week, the Hub gets a new Featured Member.
** Ask The Pros: Returns from the past in this new, online version of user submitted question (online) and answered by the editor of relative expertise.
** Head2Head: User feedback and letter of the month return to new subsection in rear of each issue.
* Previews (formerly known as &quot;Short ProShots&quot; and then &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;): A peek at games in development, telling of the projected release dates of games and what to expect out of them. When this column first appeared, it was in the back of the magazine, with only minuscule information. In 1996, it was moved to the front of the magazine after the features. It was shortly after the rearranging in 1996 that &quot;GamePro&quot; started a new approach to the previews, labeling previews as either &quot;First Look&quot;, where they may have only seen a video and only had information on storyline and features in the game, and &quot;Hands-On&quot;, where the editor providing the preview got to play an early build of the game and described any first impressions of the game. Also added for a short time in 1996 was a &quot;percent complete bar&quot; graphic that noted how far along the game was. This graphic was dropped in 1999 during the 10th Anniversary redesign.
* Games To Go: Reviews and previews of games for portable game systems.
* The Sports Page: Previews and reviews of sports games. When this section debuted in 1993, each review and preview got its own &quot;headline&quot; to give the section a newspaper feel. By the end of 1996, the newspaper-style headlines were only used for one or two reviews each issue and never for previews, and they were dropped entirely in 1999 for the 10th Anniversary redesign. This section was also the first section to have the &quot;multiplatform game review&quot; tactic described above, in 2003.
* Role Players Realm: Reviews, previews, and walkthroughs of role playing games (RPGs). Often a walkthrough for a game would be serialized across two or three issues. During slow months for RPGs, the section would be padded with fantasy-themed video games from other genres.
* Code Vault (formerly &quot;C.S.A.T. Pro&quot;): Video game cheats, strategies, tactics, tips, secrets and easter eggs revealed. Both game companies and readers sent in submissions for this section, with a random prize to the reader who sent in the best tip (usually a game). When this section debuted as C.S.A.T. Pro, C.S.A.T. stood for &quot;Cheats, Strategies and Tactics&quot;. In 2002 this feature was renamed &quot;Code Vault&quot; so as to match the name of &quot;Gamepro&quot;″s short-lived cheat-code spinoff magazines.
* Head-2-Head (formerly known as &quot;The Mail&quot;): A letters to the editor section. They began doing a &quot;Letter Of The Month&quot; special in 2004, with the winning letter&#x27;s author winning a particular prize. This section had begun to feature a Reader Review from their website on a particular game as a way to entice other readers to visit their site and do the same. Throughout the magazine&#x27;s lifespan, this section was in the front of the magazine. However, as of April 2007&#x27;s redesign, the section has been moved to the back of the magazine.
* Buyers Beware: A consumer advocacy section in which readers send in complaints about defective and malfunctioning games, peripherals, systems, and the like. &quot;Gamepro&quot; was the only publication to feature such a column. Every once in a while, the column steered away from its usual formula to feature a current widespread issue. Whenever possible, &quot;GamePro&quot; contacted the relevant game company and a company representative would directly answer the reader&#x27;s query, sometimes with the editor putting in additional advice or critical comments if he considered the company&#x27;s response inadequate. This was the only &quot;Gamepro&quot; column to be authored by the same editor since its debut in 1994: The Watch Dog. This section migrated onto Gamepro.com as of the April 2007 redesign, and was seemingly dropped from the print magazine.
* ProNews: &quot;Gamepro&quot;″s news section. This section first appeared in the back of the magazine after the reviews, but found its way to the front of the magazine in 1996 to follow suit with other game magazines. This section has shape-shifted over the years to include various &quot;game watches&quot;, a random quote generation sidebar called &quot;Static&quot; that seemingly disappeared after 2003. Gamepro Labs, which used to be a separate column, then appeared as a part of this section.
* Hot At The Arcades: Previews and reviews of cabinet arcade games. This section appeared regularly for about 5 years after the magazine debuted. The section still appeared every now and again, but was absent for the most part since 1997 due to the steady decline of arcades. This section was at times folded into the Pro news section.
* Overseas Prospects: Import games were featured and sometimes reviewed. This section is still in the magazine, but appears only rarely.
* Video Game Survival Guide: Originally titled &quot;16-Bit Survival Guide&quot; when the Super NES and Genesis were on the last year of their respective runs, to review those games that were still being released for the systems. This was changed to reflect other game systems that were close to, or even past, the end of their commercial lifespan.
* Adventures of Gamepro: The Adventures of Gamepro was a comic strip run in the early issues of the magazine detailing the adventures of a superhero named after the magazine. He was a gamer drawn into the realm of video games to fight off evil creatures taking over game after game called the Evil Darklings.

===Rating scale===
At first, games were rated by five categories: Graphics, Sound, Gameplay, FunFactor, and Challenge. Later the &quot;Challenge&quot; category was dropped and the &quot;Gameplay&quot; category was renamed &quot;Control&quot;. The ratings were initially on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, in increments of 0.5, but a possible 0.5 score was later added. The first game to receive such a score was &quot;Battle Arena Toshinden URA&quot; for the Sega Saturn. Starting in October 1990, each score was accentuated with a cartoon face (The Gamepro Dude) depicting different expressions for different ratings. The ratings faces remained in use until about 2002. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s reviews became esteemed enough that some games would display their &quot;GamePro&quot; ratings on their retail boxes.

After 2002, the category system was eliminated in favor of a single overall rating for each game on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0 stars. A graphic of five stars were shown alongside the written review. The number of stars a game earned was indicated by the number of solid stars (e.g., a game&#x27;s 4-star rating was represented by showing 4 solid stars and one hollow star). No game ever received less than one star. An Editors&#x27; Choice Award was given to a game that earned either 4.5 or 5.0 stars.

===Role-Player&#x27;s Realm===
&quot;GamePro&quot; had a &quot;Role-Player&#x27;s Realm&quot; section dedicated to the coverage and reviews of role-playing video games. In the January 1997 issue, they published a list of &quot;The Top Ten Best RPGs Ever&quot; which consisted of the following games:

#&quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot; (Super NES)
#&quot;Final Fantasy 3&quot; (Super NES)
#&quot; / &quot; (Sega CD)
#&quot;Breath of Fire II&quot; (Super NES)
#&quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; (Genesis)
#&quot;Secret of Mana&quot; (Super NES)
#&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; (Super NES)
#&quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; (Super NES)
#&quot;Might and Magic II&quot; (Genesis)
#&quot;Final Fantasy 2&quot; (Super NES)

Later in 2008, &quot;GamePro&quot; published another list of &quot;The 26 Best RPGs of the All Time&quot;, the top ten of which consisted of the following games:

#&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;
#&quot;World of Warcraft&quot;
#&quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;
#&quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;
#&quot;Fallout 3&quot;
#&quot;Diablo II: Lord of Destruction&quot;
#&quot;Ultima&quot; series
#&quot;Xenogears&quot;
#&quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;
#&quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;

===ProTips===
&quot;GamePro&quot; is credited with coming up with the concept of &quot;Protip&quot;, a short piece of advice as if spoken by an expert usually attached to an image, which was explained by former writer Dan Amrich that as part of their editorial process, they were encouraged to caption the three-to-seven images used in an article with such advice.

One purported image from a &quot;GamePro&quot; review of &quot;Doom&quot; (1993) had a caption for an image of one of the game&#x27;s bosses as &quot;PROTIP: To defeat the Cyberdemon, shoot at it until it dies&quot;. The apparent advice, which is common sense and self-evident for players of first-person shooters like &quot;Doom&quot;, was widely mocked and created a meme of similarly obvious ProTips added as captions to pictures. However, the image was revealed to be a fake, created as an April Fools&#x27; joke for a fansite doomworld.com.

===&quot;Lamepro&quot;===

Every April until 2007, as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank, &quot;Gamepro&quot; printed a 2-5 page satirical spoof of the magazine called &quot;Lamepro&quot;, a parody of &quot;Gamepro&quot;&#x27;s own official title. The feature contained humorous game titles and fake news similar to The Onion, though some content, such as ways to get useless game glitches (games getting stuck, reset, or otherwise), was real. The section parodied GamePro itself, as well as other game magazines.

==&quot;PC Games&quot;==
What was called a &quot;sister publication&quot; to &quot;GamePro&quot;, &quot;PC Games&quot;, was published by IDG until 1999. It was founded in August 1988, but changed its name to &quot;Electronic Entertainment&quot; in late 1993 and &quot;PC Entertainment&quot; in early 1996. The title reverted to &quot;PC Games&quot; in June 1996. Its &quot;PC Games&quot; Online website was merged with several other IDG properties, including &quot;GamePro&quot; Online, to form the IDG Games Network in late 1997. The print version of &quot;PC Games&quot; was the fourth-largest computer game magazine in the United States during 1998, with a circulation of 169,281. In March 1999, it was purchased and closed by Imagine Publishing; its April 1999 issue was its last. Following this event, Imagine sent former subscribers of &quot;PC Games&quot; issues of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot; and &quot;PC Accelerator&quot; in its place. According to GameDaily, the move came as part of IDG&#x27;s rebranding effort to lean more heavily on the &quot;GamePro&quot; name: coverage of computer games was thereafter centralized at PCGamePro.com, and in the &quot;PC GamePro&quot; section of &quot;GamePro&quot;″s print edition.

==&quot;Australian GamePro&quot;==

&quot;Australian GamePro&quot; was a bi-monthly video games magazine published by IDG from 10 November 2003 to February 2007. The founding editor was Stuart Clarke, who was succeeded in January 2006 by Chris Stead. According to the latter, the magazine had doubled its sales from 2006 to 2007, but the decision to discontinue the publication came as a result of internal restructuring.

=== Special issues ===
The &quot;Australian GamePro&quot; team put together a number of special issues, including:
* &quot;Ultimate PSP Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;
* &quot;Ultimate Nintendo Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;
* &quot;Ultimate Xbox 360 Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;
* &quot;Your Complete Guide to Online Gaming&quot;
* &quot;Australian GamePro Presents World of Warcraft&quot;

<text>Digital Living Network Alliance (DLNA) is a set of interoperability standards for sharing home digital media among multimedia devices. It allows users to share or stream stored media files to various certified devices on the same network like PCs, smartphones, TV sets, game consoles, stereo systems, and NASs. DLNA incorporates several existing public standards, including Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) for media management and device discovery and control, wired and wireless networking standards, and widely used digital media formats. Many routers and network attached storage (NAS) devices have built-in DLNA support, as well as software applications like Windows Media Player.

DLNA was created by Sony and Intel and the consortium soon included various PC and consumer electronics companies, publishing its first set of guidelines in June 2004. The Digital Living Network Alliance developed and promoted it under the auspices of a certification standard, with a claimed membership of &quot;more than 200 companies&quot; before dissolving in 2017. By September 2014 over 25,000 device models had obtained &quot;DLNA Certified&quot; status, indicated by a logo on their packaging and confirming their interoperability with other devices.

==Specification==
The DLNA Certified Device Classes are separated as follows:

===Home network devices===
* Digital Media Server Application (DMSA): store content and make it available to networked digital media players (DMP) and digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include PCs and network-attached storage (NAS) devices.
* Digital Media Player (DMP): find content on digital media servers (DMS) and provide playback and rendering capabilities. Examples include TVs, stereos and home theaters, wireless monitors and game consoles.
* Digital Media Renderer (DMR): play content as instructed by a digital media controller (DMC), which will find content from a digital media server (DMS). Examples include TVs, audio/video receivers, video displays and remote speakers for music. It is possible for a single device (e.g. TV, A/V receiver, etc.) to function both as a DMR (receives &quot;pushed&quot; content from DMS) and DMP (&quot;pulls&quot; content from DMS).
* Digital Media Controller (DMC): find content on digital media servers (DMS) and instruct digital media renderers (DMR) to play the content. Content does not stream from or through the DMC. Examples include tablet computers, Wi-Fi enabled digital cameras and smartphones. 
* Generally, digital media players (DMP) and digital media controllers (DMC) with print capability can print to DMPr. Examples include networked photo printers and networked all-in-one printers.

===Mobile handheld devices===
* Mobile Digital Media Server (M-DMS): store content and make it available to wired/wireless networked mobile digital media players (M-DMP), and digital media renderers. Examples include mobile phones and portable music players.
* Mobile Digital Media Player (M-DMP): find and play content on a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include mobile phones and mobile media tablets designed for viewing multimedia content.
* Mobile Digital Media Uploader (M-DMU): send (upload) content to a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include digital cameras and mobile phones.
* Mobile Digital Media Downloader (M-DMD): find and store (download) content from a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS). Examples include portable music players and mobile phones.
* Mobile Digital Media Controller (M-DMC): find content on a digital media server (DMS) or mobile digital media server (M-DMS) and send it to digital media renderers (DMR). Examples include personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobile phones.

===Home infrastructure devices===
* Mobile Network Connectivity Function (M-NCF): provide a bridge between mobile handheld device network connectivity and home network connectivity.
* Media Interoperability Unit (MIU): provide content transformation between required media formats for home network and mobile handheld devices.

The specification uses DTCP-IP as &quot;link protection&quot; for copyright-protected commercial content between one device to another.

===DLNA guideline versions===
* 1.0: released June 2004; 2 volumes: Architecture &amp; Protocols, Media Formats; 2 Device Classes: DMP, DMS; About 50 media format profiles
* 1.5: released March 2006; 3 volumes: Architecture &amp; Protocols, Media Formats, and Link Protection; 12 Devices Classes and 5 Device Capabilities; About 250 media format profiles
* 2.0: released August 2015; Includes topics like EPG, Content Sync, RUI, WPS, Media Formats, Scheduled recording, DRM
* 3.0: released August 2015; enhanced response time, improved power efficiency, HEVC support
* 4.0: released June 2016; solves the &quot;media format not supported&quot; problem between PCs, TVs and mobile devices while supporting Ultra HD TV content streaming

==Products supporting DLNA==

===DLNA-certified devices===
Some of the earlier devices with DLNA included the PlayStation 3, the Nokia N95 and the Pioneer BDP-HD1 Blu-ray player. By 2014 over 25,000 DLNA-certified products were available, up from 9,000 in 2011. This includes TVs, DVD and Blu-ray players, games consoles, digital media players, photo frames, cameras, NAS devices, PCs, mobile handsets, and more. According to a 2013 study from Parks Associates, nearly 3 billion products were expected to be on the market in 2014, increasing to over 7 billion by 2018. DLNA certification of devices can be determined by a DLNA logo on the device, or by verifying certification through the DLNA Product Search.

===DLNA-certified software===
TwonkyMedia server, Serviio and BubbleUPnP are known examples of DLNA server software. All versions of Microsoft Windows since Windows 7 have native DLNA server and client support through Windows Media Player (it is named &quot;media streaming&quot;).

In many cases DLNA protocols are in use by services or software without openly stating the name: examples include Nokia&#x27;s Home Network functionality in Symbian OS, Samsung&#x27;s All Share, the Play To functionality in Windows 8.1, and in applications such as VLC media player or Roku Media Player.

==History and member companies==
Intel established the Digital Living Network Alliance along with Sony and Microsoft in June 2003 as the Digital Home Working Group (DHWG), changing its name 12 months later, when the first set of guidelines for DLNA was published. Its board members as of 2007 were: HP, Intel, Matsushita, Microsoft, Nokia, Philips, Samsung, and Sony. 

Home Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines v1.5 was published in March 2006 and expanded in October of the same year; the changes included the addition of two new product categories — printers, and mobile devices — as well as an &quot;increase of DLNA Device Classes from two to twelve&quot; and an increase in supported user scenarios related to the new product categories.

DLNA worked with cable, satellite, and telecom service providers to provide link protection on each end of the data transfer. The extra layer of digital rights management (DRM) security allows broadcast operators to communicate digital media to certain devices (e.g. to those of their customers) in such a manner that further, unauthorized, communication of the media is difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;press release 6/24/2003&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, DLNA began a software certification program in order to make it easier for consumers to share their digital media across a broader range of products. DLNA is certifying software that is sold directly to consumers through retailers, websites and mobile application stores. With DLNA certified software, consumers can upgrade products from within their home networks that may not be DLNA certified and bring them into their personal DLNA ecosystems. This helps in bringing content such as videos, photos and music stored on DLNA certified devices to a larger selection of consumer electronics, mobile and PC products. 

In March 2014, DLNA publicly released the VidiPath Guidelines, originally called &quot;DLNA CVP-2 Guidelines.&quot; VidiPath enables consumers to view subscription TV content on a wide variety of devices including televisions, tablets, phones, Blu-ray players, set-top boxes (STBs), personal computers (PCs) and game consoles without any additional intermediate devices from the service provider. 

In November 2015 there were 13 promoter members and 171 contributor members. The promoter members were:

Arris, AwoX, Broadcom, CableLabs, Comcast, Dolby Laboratories, Intel, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung Electronics, Sony Electronics, Time Warner Cable, and Verizon.

The board of directors oversaw the activity of the four following committees:
* Ecosystem Committee, planning the future development of DLNA guidelines
* Compliance &amp; Test Committee, overseeing the certification program and its evolutions
* Marketing Communication Advisory Council, actively promoting DLNA worldwide
* Technical Committee, writing the DLNA guidelines
On January 5, 2017, the DLNA organization announced, &quot;The organization has fulfilled its mission and will dissolve as a non-profit trade association.&quot; Its certification program continues to be conducted by SpireSpark International of Portland, Oregon.

===DLNA technology components===
As the past president of DLNA pointed out to the Register in March 2009:

DLNA Interoperability Guidelines allow manufacturers to participate in the growing marketplace of networked devices and are separated into the following sections of key technology components:
* Network and Connectivity
* Device and Service Discovery and Control
* Media Format and Transport Model
* Media Management, Distribution and Control
* Digital Rights Management and Content Protection
* Manageability
* Efficient Power Management

<doc id="1164255" wikidata="Q2354223" url="?curid=1164255" title="Wives of Muhammad">
<text>A total of eleven women are confirmed as having been married to Muhammad, the founder of Islam. As a sign of respect, Muslims refer to each of these wives with the title Umm al-Muʼminin (, ), which is derived from of the Quran.

Muhammad&#x27;s first marriage was to Khadija bint Khuwaylid in 595, when he was 25 and she was either 28 or 41. She was his only wife until her death in 619 (the Year of Sorrow) ended their 24-year-long marriage. After Khadija, Muhammad went on to marry ten women: Sawdah bint Zam&#x27;ah in 619; Aisha bint Abi Bakr in 623; Hafsah bint Umar, Zaynab bint Khuzayma, and Hind bint Abi Umayya in 625; Zaynab bint Jahsh in 627; Juwayriya bint al-Harith and Ramla bint Abi Sufyan ibn Harb in 628; and Safiyya bint Huyayy and Maymunah bint al-Harith in 629. Additionally, the statuses of Rayhanah bint Zayd and Mariyya bint Shamʿun are disputed, as there has been disagreement among Muslim scholars on whether they were concubines or wives. With the exception of Aisha, all of these women were previously widowed or divorced. The common view is that Muhammad had seven biological children (three sons and four daughters) and all but one of them were produced with Khadija between 598 and 611 or 615. Mariyya bore Muhammad a son in 630 (his seventh child), but none of his sons survived to adulthood.

Traditionally, two epochs delineate Muhammad&#x27;s life and career: pre-Hijrah Mecca between 570 and 622; and post-Hijrah Medina between 622 and his death in 632. &quot;Hijrah&quot; refers to Muhammad&#x27;s migration, alongside the early Muslims, from Mecca to Medina due to the Meccans&#x27; persecution of the early Muslims. All but two of his marriages were contracted after this migration.

==Objectives==

Khadija, Muhammad&#x27;s first wife, was his employer and a woman of considerable wealth who reportedly supported him financially and emotionally, and she also became his first follower when he began preaching the message of Islam. Both her age and marital history at the time of her marriage to the 25-year-old Muhammad remain unclear; she was either 28 or 41 and may or may not have been a virgin, with the existence of any previous children also being disputed. Nonetheless, this marriage was the most significant by all accounts: six of Muhammad&#x27;s seven biological children were produced with Khadija and the couple remained monogamous for the entirety of the 24 years that they were together. Khadija&#x27;s death in 619, at the age of either 52 or 65, brought an end to the first marriage and the monogamy of Muhammad, who was 49 at this time. Upon his migration to Medina, he began actively practicing polygyny and acquired about one wife per year. He did not, however, have a Medinan wife, presumably because they did not embrace Islam&#x27;s approval of marrying multiple women and its curtailment of their right to inheritance. Although Muslims are religiously limited to having only four wives at the same time, Muhammad was exempted from this ruling and was allowed to have an unlimited number of wives due to his status as an Islamic prophet and messenger. Additionally, Muhammad&#x27;s wives were not allowed to remarry after his death; all men of the contemporary era were strictly warned against attempting to marry these widowed women, with this intent being classified as &quot;a major offence in the sight of Allah&quot; in the Quran.

Scottish academic William Montgomery Watt states that all of Muhammad&#x27;s marriages had the political aspect of strengthening friendly relationships and were based on the Arabian custom. American professor John Esposito points out that some of Muhammad&#x27;s marriages were aimed at providing a livelihood for widows; he noted that remarriage was difficult for these women in Arabian society, which emphasized and was hyper-focused on female virginity and sexual purity. American academic Francis Edward Peters says that it is hard to make generalizations about Muhammad&#x27;s marriages; many of them were political, some compassionate, and some perhaps affairs of the heart. American historian John Victor Tolan writes that Muhammad&#x27;s marriages were mainly attempts at forging political alliances.

Thus, the objectives of Muhammad&#x27;s marriages have been described as:
# Creating family bonds between him and his companions (Muhammad married the daughters of Abu Bakr and Umar, whereas Uthman and Ali married his daughters. He therefore had family bonds with all of the Rashidun).
# Spreading the message of Islam by uniting different Arabian tribes and clans through marriage.

===Terminology===
&quot;Mother of the Believers&quot; is a term by which each of Muhammad&#x27;s wives came to be prefixed with over time. It is derived from Quran 33:6: &quot;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their selves, and his wives are (as) their mothers&quot; is applied to all of these women.

==Family life==
Muhammad and his family lived in small apartments adjacent to the mosque at Medina. Each of these were six to seven spans wide (1.7 metres) and ten spans long (2.3 metres), and the height of the ceiling was equivalent to that of an average man standing. Blankets were used as curtains to screen the doors. According to an account by Anas ibn Malik, one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions: &quot;The Prophet used to visit all his wives in a round, during the day and night and they were eleven in number.&quot; I asked Anas, &quot;Had the Prophet the strength for it?&quot; Anas replied, &quot;We used to say that the Prophet was given the strength of thirty (men).&quot; And Sa&#x27;id said on the authority of Qatada that Anas had told him about nine wives only (not eleven).

Although Muhammad&#x27;s wives had a special status among the early Muslims, he did not allow them to use his status as a prophet and messenger to obtain special treatment in public.

==Marriages==

=== Khadija bint Khuwaylid ===

Around the age of 25, Muhammad wed his wealthy employer, Khadija, the 28-or 40-year-old widow, and daughter of a merchant. Muhammad used to manage her caravans; and Khadija, being impressed by the skills of Muhammad, sent a proposal to the Islamic prophet. Around 595, the couple married, and this marriage, his first, would be both happy and monogamous; Muhammad would rely on Khadija in many ways, until her death 25 years later. They had two sons, Qasim and Abd Allah (nicknamed &quot;al-Ṭāhir&quot; and &quot;al-Ṭayyib&quot; respectively), both died young, and four daughters—Zaynab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah. Some Shia scholars dispute the paternity of Khadija&#x27;s daughters, as they view the first three of them as the daughters from previous marriages and only Fatimah as the daughter of Muhammad and Khadija. During their marriage, Khadija purchased the slave Zayd ibn Harithah, then adopted the young man as her son at Muhammad&#x27;s request. Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abu Talib and Khadija died in 620 and the Islamic prophet declared the year as &quot;Aam al-Huzn&quot; (&#x27;Year of Sorrow&#x27;).

===Hijrah (migration) to Medina===
====Sawda bint Zamʿah====

Before he left for Medina, it was suggested by Khawlah bint Hakim that he should marry Sawdah bint Zam&#x27;ah, who had suffered many hardships after she became a Muslim. Prior to that, Sawdah was married to a paternal cousin of hers named As-Sakran ibn ‘Amr and had five or six children from her previous marriage. She along with her husband migrated to Abyssinia due to persecution of Muslims by Meccans. Her husband died in Abyssinia and hence Sawdah had to come back to Mecca. There are disagreements in Muslim tradition whether Muhammad first married Sawdah or Aisha, but Sawda is usually regarded as his second wife and she was living with him before Aisha joined the household. Sawda was about 30 years old at the time.

As Sawdah got older, and some time after Muhammad&#x27;s marriage to Umm Salama, there are reports that Muhammad was neglecting Sawdah and had planned to divorce her. But Sawdah stopped him in the street and begged him to take her back, offering to give up her turn for his nightly conjugal visits to Aisha, whom he was very fond of. Sawdah pleaded that she was old anyway and did not care for men; her only wish was to be resurrected as the Prophet&#x27;s wife on the Day of Judgment. Muhammad agreed to her proposal, and Qur&#x27;an 4:128-9 was revealed. Other traditions say that Muhammad did not really reject her, but that she was afraid that he would, and it was not rejection that was considered in the revelation of the verse, but rather a compromise on divorce so long as she could remain his wife in name.

====Aisha bint Abu Bakr====
Aisha was the daughter of Muhammad&#x27;s close friend Abu Bakr. She was initially betrothed to Jubayr ibn Muṭʽim, a Muslim whose father, though pagan, was friendly to the Muslims. When Khawlah bint Hakim suggested that Muhammad marry Aisha after the death of Muhammad&#x27;s first wife (Khadija), the previous agreement regarding the marriage of Aisha with ibn Mut&#x27;im was put aside by common consent.

Muhammad converted friendship of his four friends who later became the four Islamic rulers or successors, into relationship through marriage. He married Aisha and Hafsa daughters of Abu Bakr and Umar and he gave his daughters to Uthman and Ali. Aisha was the only virgin he married.

The majority of traditional sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of six or seven, but she stayed in her parents&#x27; home until the age of nine, or ten according to Ibn Hisham, when the marriage was consummated with Muhammad, then 53, in Medina. Aisha&#x27;s age at marriage has been a source of controversy and debate, and many non-Muslim historians, Islamic scholars, and Muslim writers have challenged the previously accepted timeline of her life by claiming that Aisha was in fact 18-19 years old when she consummated her marriage to Muhammad according to historical reviews. Both Aisha and Sawda, his two wives, were given apartments adjoined to the Al-Masjid al-Nabawi mosque.

Aisha was extremely scholarly and inquisitive. Her contribution to the spread of Muhammad&#x27;s message was extraordinary, and she served the Muslim community for 44 years after his death. She is also known for narrating 2210 hadith, not just on matters related to Muhammad&#x27;s private life, but also on topics such as marriage, Islamic inheritance, Hajj and Islamic eschatology, among other subjects. She was highly regarded for her intellect and knowledge in various fields, including poetry and medicine, which received plenty of praise by the traditionist al-Zuhri and by her student Urwa ibn al-Zubayr. Aisha was also a general who led thousands of Muslims to battle during the First Fitna.

===Widows of the war with Mecca===

====Hafsa bint Umar and Zaynab bint Khuzayma====

During the Muslim war with Mecca, many men were killed leaving behind widows and orphans. Hafsa bint Umar, daughter of Umar ibn Al-Khattab, was widowed at Battle of Badr when her husband Khunais ibn Hudhaifa was killed in action. Muhammad married her in 3 A.H./625 CE. Zaynab bint Khuzayma was also widowed at the battle of Badr. She was the wife of Ubaydah ibn al-Harith, a faithful Muslim and from the tribe of Al-Muttalib, for which Muhammad had special responsibility. When her husband died, Muhammad aiming to provide for her, married her in 4 A.H. She was nicknamed Umm Al-Masakeen (roughly translates as the mother of the poor), because of her kindness and charity.

Close to Aisha&#x27;s age, the two younger wives Hafsa and Zaynab were welcomed into the household. Sawda, who was much older, extended her motherly benevolence to the younger women. Aisha and Hafsa had a lasting relationship. As for Zaynab, however, she became ill and died about three months after her marriage.

====Hind bint Suhayl (Umm Salama)====
The death of Zaynab coincided with that of Abu Salamah, a devout Muslim and Muhammad&#x27;s foster brother, as a result of his wounds from the Battle of Uhud. Abu Salamah&#x27;s widow, Umm Salama, also a devoted Muslim, had none but her young children. Her plight of being without a man reportedly saddened the Muslims, and after her &quot;iddah&quot; some Muslims proposed marriage to her; but she declined. She was the paternal cousin of Khalid Ibn Al Waleed, the military commander who fought against Muhammad in many battles. Her marriage made Khalid take an indecisive attitude at the battle of Uhud. When Muhammad proposed her marriage, she was reluctant for three reasons: she claimed to suffer from jealousy and pointed out the prospect of an unsuccessful marriage, her old age, and her young family that needed support. But Muhammad replied that he would pray to God to free her from jealousy, that he too was of old age, and that her family was like his family. She married Muhammad around the end of 4 AH.

====Rayhana bint Zayd====

Rayhana bint Zayd was a Jewish woman from the Banu Nadir tribe. In 627, the Banu Qurayza tribe was defeated and Rayhana was enslaved. Ibn Sa&#x27;d wrote that Rayhana went on to be manumitted and subsequently married to the prophet upon her conversion to Islam. Al-Tha&#x27;labi reports that the prophet paid a mahr for her and Ibn Hajar makes reference to Muhammad giving Rayhana a home upon their marriage.

===Internal dissension===
An incident happened in which Aisha left her camp to search for her lost necklace, and returned with a companion of Muhammad.

====Zaynab bint Jahsh====
Zaynab bint Jahsh was Muhammad&#x27;s cousin, the daughter of one of his father&#x27;s sisters.

In the Pre Islamic Era, Arabs used to consider children who had been sponsored exactly the same as their biological children as far as rights such as inheritance and sanctities were concerned. However, after marriage the sponsored children lost their inheritance rights and were henceforth known as the children of their biological parents. After attaining puberty, they could not live with the sponsoring family but were still subsidised. This was to reduce the enmity of biological children towards sponsored children and to prevent the mingling of male sponsors with adult sponsored females.

In Medina Muhammad arranged the widowed Zaynab&#x27;s marriage to his adopted son Zayd ibn Harithah. Caesar E. Farah states that Muhammad was determined to establish the legitimacy and right to equal treatment of the adopted. Zaynab disapproved of the marriage, and her brothers rejected it, because according to Ibn Sa&#x27;d, she was of aristocratic lineage and Zayd was a former slave. Watt states that it is not clear why Zaynab was unwilling to marry Zayd as Muhammad esteemed him highly. He postulates that Zaynab, being an ambitious woman, was already hoping to marry Muhammad; or that she might have wanted to marry someone of whom Muhammad disapproved for political reasons. According to Maududi, after the Qur&#x27;anic verse was revealed, Zaynab acquiesced and married Zayd.

Zaynab&#x27;s marriage was unharmonious. According to Watt, it is almost certain that she was working for marriage with Muhammad before the end of 626. &quot;Zaynab had dressed in haste when she was told &#x27;the Messenger of God is at the door.&#x27; She jumped up in haste and excited the admiration of the Messenger of God, so that he turned away murmuring something that could scarcely be understood. However, he did say overtly: &#x27;Glory be to God the Almighty! Glory be to God, who causes the hearts to turn!&#x27;&quot; Zaynab told Zayd about this, and he offered to divorce her, but Muhammad told him to keep her. The story laid much stress on Zaynab&#x27;s perceived beauty. Nomani considers this story to be a rumor. Watt doubts the accuracy of this portion of the narrative since it does not occur in the earliest source. He thinks that even if there is a basis of fact underlying the narrative, it would have been subject to exaggeration in the course of transmission as the later Muslims liked to maintain that there was no celibacy and monkery in Islam. Rodinson disagrees with Watt arguing that the story is stressed in the traditional texts and that it would not have aroused any adverse comment or criticism.

Muhammad, fearing public opinion, was initially reluctant to marry Zaynab. The marriage would seem incestuous to their contemporaries because she was the former wife of his adopted son, and adopted sons were considered the same as biological sons. According to Watt, this &quot;conception of incest was bound up with old practices belonging to a lower, communalistic level of familial institutions where a child&#x27;s paternity was not definitely known; and this lower level was in process being eliminated by Islam.&quot; The Qur&#x27;an however, indicated that this marriage was a duty imposed upon him by God. It implied that treating adopted sons as real sons was objectionable and that there should now be a complete break with the past. Thus Muhammad, confident that he was strong enough to face public opinion, proceeded to reject these taboos. When Zaynab&#x27;s waiting period was complete, Muhammad married her. An influential faction in Medina, called &quot;Hypocrites&quot;, a term that refers to those who convert to Islam while secretly working against it in the Islamic tradition, did indeed criticize the marriage as incestuous. Attempting to divide the Muslim community, they spread rumors as part of a strategy of attacking Muhammad through his wives. According to Ibn Kathir, the relevant Qur&#x27;anic verses were a &quot;divine rejection&quot; of the Hypocrites&#x27; objections. According to Rodinson, doubters argued the verses were in exact conflict with social taboos and favored Muhammad too much. The delivery of these verses, thus, did not end the dissent.

===Reconciliation===

====Juwayriya bint al-Harith====

One of the captives from the skirmish with the Banu Mustaliq was Juwayriya bint al-Harith, who was the daughter of the tribe&#x27;s chieftain. Her husband, Mustafa bin Safwan, had been killed in the battle. She initially fell among the booty of Muhammad&#x27;s companion Thabit ibn Qays ibn Al-Shammas. Upon being enslaved, Juwayriyya went to Muhammad requesting that she - as the daughter of the lord of the Mustaliq - be released, however, he refused. Meanwhile, her father approached Muhammad with ransom to secure her release, but Muhammed still refused to release her. Muhammad then offered to marry her, and she accepted. When it became known that tribes persons of Mustaliq were kinsmen of the prophet of Islam through marriage, the Muslims began releasing their captives. Thus, Muhammad&#x27;s marriage resulted in the freedom of nearly one hundred families whom he had recently enslaved.

====Safiyya bint Huyayy Ibn Akhtab====
Safiyya bint Huyayy was a noblewoman and the daughter of Huyayy ibn Akhtab, the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir, who was executed after surrendering at the Battle of the Trench. She had been married first to the poet Sallam ibn Mishkam, who had divorced her, and second to Kenana ibn al-Rabi, a commander.

In 628, Muhammad attacked Khaybar and made the inhabitants, including the Banu Nadir, surrender. Kenana, who was Safiyya&#x27;s husband at the time, was tortured and then beheaded after he refused to reveal the location of his tribe&#x27;s treasure. One of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, Dihya al-Kalbi, asked Muhammad to be allowed to take a slave girl from the captives; he gave permission, so Dihya went and took Safiyya. However, a man then came to Muhammad reporting that Dihya had taken Safiyya, who was the chief mistress of the Qurayza and the Nadir, which he thought was only suitable for Muhammad. Thus, Muhammad gave the order to call them.

When Safiyya was brought, she was with another woman, and when the woman saw the headless bodies, she screamed wildly, struck herself in the face, and poured sand on her own head. The woman was taken away, Muhammad then took Safiyya for himself and told Dihya to take any other slave girl from the captives. Reportedly, Dihya got seven slaves in exchange. After that, Muhammad married her and brought her into his bed that very night. She was 17 years old at the time and was known to be exceptionally beautiful.

According to Martin Lings, Muhammad had given Safiyyah the choice of returning to the defeated Banu Nadir, or becoming Muslim and marrying him, and Safiyyah opted for the latter choice. W. Montgomery Watt and Nomani believe that Muhammad married Safiyya as part of reconciliation with the Jewish tribe and as a gesture of goodwill. John L. Esposito states that the marriage may have been political or to cement alliances. Haykal opines that Muhammad&#x27;s manumission of and marriage to Safiyaa was partly in order to alleviate her tragedy and partly to preserve their dignity, and compares these actions to previous conquerors who married the daughters and wives of the kings whom they had defeated. According to some, by marrying Safiyyah, Muhammad aimed at ending the enmity and hostility between Jews and Islam.

Muhammad convinced Safiyya to convert to Islam. According to Abu Ya&#x27;la al-Mawsili, Safiyya came to appreciate the love and honor Muhammad gave her, and said, &quot;I have never seen a good-natured person as the Messenger of Allah&quot;. Safiyyah remained loyal to Muhammad until he died.

According to Islamic tradition, Safiyya was beautiful, patient, intelligent, learned and gentle, and she respected Muhammad as &quot;Allah&#x27;s Messenger&quot;. Muslim scholars state she had many good moral qualities. She is described as a humble worshiper and a pious believer. Ibn Kathir said, &quot;she was one of the best women in her worship, piousness, ascetism, devoutness, and charity&quot;. According to Ibn Sa&#x27;d, Safiyyah was very charitable and generous. She used to give out and spend whatever she had; she gave away a house that she had when she was still alive.

Upon entering Muhammad&#x27;s household, Safiyya became friends with Aisha and Hafsa. Also, she offered gifts to Fatima. She gave some of Muhammad&#x27;s other wives gifts from her jewels that she brought with her from Khaybar. However, some of Muhammad&#x27;s other wives spoke ill of Safiyya&#x27;s Jewish descent. Muhammad intervened, pointing out to everyone that Safiyya&#x27;s &quot;husband is Muhammad, father is Aaron, and uncle is Moses&quot;, a reference to revered prophets.

Muhammad once went to hajj with all his wives. On the way, Safiyya&#x27;s camel knelt down, as it was the weakest in the caravan, and she started to weep. Muhammad came to her and wiped her tears with his dress and hands, but the more he asked her not to cry, the more she went on weeping. When Muhammad was terminally ill, Safiyya was profoundly upset. She said to him &quot;I wish it was I who was suffering instead of you.&quot;

====Ramla bint Abi Sufyan (Umm Habiba)====

In the same year, Muhammad signed a peace treaty with his Meccan enemies, the Quraysh effectively ending the state of war between the two parties. He soon married the daughter of the Quraysh leader and military commander, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, aimed at further reconciling his opponents. He sent a proposal for marriage to Ramla bint Abi Sufyan, who was in Abyssinia at the time when she learned her husband had died. She had previously converted to Islam (in Mecca) against her father&#x27;s will. After her migration to Abyssinia her husband had converted to Christianity. Muhammad dispatched &#x27;Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to the Negus (king), asking him for Umm Habiba&#x27;s hand—that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.

==== Mariyah bint Shamoon al-Qibtiya ====
Maria al-Qibtiyya was one of several slaves whom the Governor of Egypt sent as a present to Muhammad. He kept her as a concubine despite the objections of his official wives. It is said in early biographies of Muhammad that Mariyah is a slave girl or concubine. Mariyah bore Muhammad a son, Ibrahim who later died at 18 months.

====Maymuna binti al-Harith====

As part of the treaty of Hudaybiyah, Muhammad visited Mecca for the pilgrimage. There Maymuna bint al-Harith proposed marriage to him. Muhammad accepted, and thus married Maymuna, the sister-in-law of Abbas, a longtime ally of his. By marrying her, Muhammad also established kinship ties with the banu Makhzum, his previous opponents. As the Meccans did not allow him to stay any longer, Muhammad left the city, taking Maymuna with him. Her original name was &quot;Barra&quot; but he called her &quot;Maymuna&quot;, meaning the blessed, as his marriage to her had also marked the first time in seven years when he could enter his hometown Mecca.

===Muhammad&#x27;s widows===

According to the Qur&#x27;an, God forbade anyone to marry the wives of Muhammad, because of their respect and honour, after he died.
The extent of Muhammad&#x27;s property at the time of his death is unclear. Although Qur&#x27;an [2.180] clearly addresses issues of inheritance, Abu Bakr, the new leader of the Muslim ummah, refused to divide Muhammad&#x27;s property among his widows and heirs, saying that he had heard Muhammad say:

Muhammad&#x27;s widow Hafsa played a role in the collection of the first Qur&#x27;anic manuscript. After Abu Bakr had collected the copy, he gave it to Hafsa, who preserved it until Uthman took it, copied it and distributed it in Muslim lands.

Some of Muhammad&#x27;s widows were active politically in the Islamic state after Muhammad&#x27;s death. Safiyya, for example, aided the Caliph Uthman during his siege. During the first fitna, some wives also took sides. Umm Salama, for example, sided with Ali, and sent her son Umar for help. The last of Muhammad&#x27;s wives, Umm Salama lived to hear about the tragedy of Karbala in 680, dying the same year. The grave of the wives of Muhammed is located at Al-Baqi Cemetery, Medina.

<text>Mbuna (pronounced Mmm-boo-nah ) is the common name for a large group of African cichlids from Lake Malawi, and are members of the haplochromine family. The name &quot;mbuna&quot; means &quot;rockfish&quot; in the language of the Tonga people of Malawi. As the name implies, most mbuna are cichlids that live among the piles of rocks and along the rocky shores of Lake Malawi, as opposed to the utaka, cichlids that live in the open water or on sandy shores or soft substrates. Some species of mbuna are highly sexually dimorphic, although many are not. Almost all of the cichlid species of Lake Malawi, including mbuna and non mbuna such as the utaka, are believed to have descended from one or a very few species that became isolated in the lake. With rising water levels, new habitats could be colonized and the many isolated rocky outcrops allowed new mbuna species to form. Their striking colors, intriguing behavioral characteristics, and relative hardiness make them very popular despite their unique demands for the home aquarist.

== Mbuna in aquaria ==
These cichlids are some of the most colorful freshwater fish for the home aquarium. Mbuna are very aggressive and territorial fish, they are not suitable for beginner fishkeepers. A suitable aquarium setting includes many rocks, adequate filtration, caves, and hiding places; plants may be uprooted, so they are best avoided, but a small number will work well in the aquarium. One of these is Java fern, which may become the object of mbuna aggression, but will not be eaten due to an undesirable taste.

==Social behavior==
Mbuna exhibit strong social behavior and establish a clearly visible social hierarchy including well-defined and enforced territories. A dominant male maintains a spherical territory, only allowing females to enter this territory for breeding purposes. Overcrowding helps spread out the aggression caused by these territorial conflicts. They, like &quot;Astatotilapia burtoni&quot;, are maternal mouthbrooders and breed readily in good conditions.

== Water parameters ==
All species from Lake Malawi thrive in the temperature range of 77-84 °F. pH 7.5-8.4 is ideal with an almost pristine (near 0 ppm) ammonia and ammonium nitrite content.

== Notable mbuna cichlids ==
Many mbuna cichlids are regularly stocked and sold by pet shops. Some of the most common ones are the Bumblebee Cichlid or Hornet Cichlid (&quot;Pseudotropheus crabro&quot;), Golden Cichlid (&quot;Melanochromis auratus&quot;), Electric Yellow or Yellow Lab Cichlid (&quot;Labidochromis caeruleus&quot;), Red Zebra Cichlid (&quot;Maylandia estherae&quot;), Blue Zebra Cichlid (&quot;Maylandia callainos&quot;), and Blue Johannii &quot;Melanochromis cyaneorhabdos&quot;. Many of these species are considered to have large territorial needs and aggressively defend these territories. Cichlids belonging to any of the genera listed below are considered mbuna.


*&quot;Abactochromis&quot; 
*&quot;Chindongo&quot; 
*&quot;Cyathochromis&quot; 
*&quot;Cynotilapia&quot; 
*&quot;Genyochromis&quot; 
*&quot;Gephyrochromis&quot; 
*&quot;Iodotropheus&quot; 
*&quot;Labeotropheus&quot; 
*&quot;Labidochromis&quot; 
*&quot;Maylandia&quot; (syn. &quot;Metriaclima&quot; )
*&quot;Melanochromis&quot; 
*&quot;Petrotilapia&quot; 
*&quot;Pseudotropheus&quot; 
*&quot;Tropheops&quot; 

The list below includes groups of nonmbuna mouthbrooding cichlids from Lake Malawi.
* Peacock cichlids (&quot;Aulonocara&quot; species)
* Utaka cichlids
* Other genera such as &quot;Rhamphochromis&quot;

<text>Frode Øverli (born 15 August 1968 in Bergen, Norway) is a Norwegian comic strip cartoonist, considered one of the most successful in Scandinavia.

== Biography ==
He began his career in 1984 when his parodies of &quot;The Phantom&quot; became a regular feature in the Norwegian publication of the &quot;Phantom&quot; serial comic book. At that time, Frode was still a student, but dedicated much of his time to writing.

Two years later, he was a regular cartoonist for the recently launched humour magazine &quot;Pyton&quot;, notable for its gratuitous toilet humour. In the beginning he illustrated stories written by authors Dag E. Kolstad, John Kåre Raake, and later Bjørn Ousland. However, he eventually resigned to write his own material, as it was limited what the others could write for him. The best known comic strips from his &quot;Pyton&quot; period are &quot;Deep Shit Junkies&quot;, a comic about a heavy metal band, and &quot;Birger-Egil&quot;, about a pair of siamese twins with completely different personalities.

In 1997 he decided to start working on his own, and eventually split with &quot;Pyton&quot;. He created a strip first titled &quot;A-laget&quot;, about three soccer supporters, but the concept evolved into what became the strip &quot;Pondus&quot;, one of Scandinavia&#x27;s most successful comic strips of all time. Along with &quot;Pondus&quot;, he also created two other comics series, &quot;Riskhospitalet&quot; (&quot;The Risk Hospital&quot; - a wordplay on the name of prominent Norwegian hospital, Rikshospitalet (National Hospital)), but Øverli discontinued this series when &quot;Pondus&quot; gained unexpected popularity. In 2000 he began creating the single panel cartoon &quot;Rutetid&quot; (a pun on &quot;transportation schedule&quot; and &quot;time for a panel&quot;), published in &quot;Pondus&quot; and other publications.

Øverli is a cartoonist, considered one of the most successful in Scandinavia. He has received the Norwegian Sproing Award twice; in 1998 following the first &quot;Pondus&quot; album, &quot;Alt for Norge&quot; (&quot;All for Norway&quot;, named after Harald V&#x27;s royal motto) and in 2003 for the &quot;Pondus&quot; Christmas album &quot;Pondus Julespesial&quot;. In 2006 he received the prestigious Swedish Adamson Award.

In addition to his cartoon work, Øverli has provided illustrations for several books.

He currently lives on the Norwegian west-coast island Askøy.

<text>The Victory Mountains () are a major group of mountains in Victoria Land, Antarctica, about long and wide, which is bounded primarily by Mariner and Tucker glaciers and the Ross Sea.
They are north of the Mountaineer Range, east of the Freyberg Mountains and south of the Concord Mountains and the Admiralty Mountains.
The division between the Victory Mountains and the Concord Mountains (to the northwest) is not precise but apparently lies in the vicinity of Thomson Peak.

==Exploration and name==

A Ross Sea aspect of the mountains was first obtained by early British expeditions of James Clark Ross, Carsten Borchgrevink, Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton. 
The mapping of the interior mountains was largely done from air photos taken by the United States Navy and surveys undertaken by New Zealand and American parties in the 1950s and 1960s. 
The Victory Mountains were named by the New Zealand Geological Survey Antarctic Expedition (NZGSAE) 1957-58, because of the proximity of this group to the Admiralty Mountains, and with the intention that many of the topographic features would be named for celebrated victories, especially naval victories.

==Location==

===Western mountains===
The Monteath Hills are in the northwest of the Victory Mountains, east of the Freyberg Mountains. 
The Millen Range and Barker Range are to their south, east of the Evans Névé and the smaller Webb Névé.
The Mariner Glacier forms to the west of the Barker Range and flows south and then east, separating the Victory Mountains from the Mountaineer Range.

===Central mountains===
The Saxby Range is to the west of the Monteath Hills, between Midway Glacier to the west, Pearl Harbor Glacier to the south and Tucker Glacier to the east, which flows to the southeast and separates the Victory Mountains from the Admiralty Mountains.
The Cartographers Range is south of the Pearl Harbor Glacier and north of the Trafalgar Glacier.
The Malta Plateau is to the south of the Trafalger Glacier and north of the Mariner Glacier.

===Eastern mountains===
The mountains to the east of the Malta Plateau and west of the Daniell Peninsula are not part of a formally named range.
Mount Riddolls is at the center of a ridge system to the east of Borchgrevink Glacier, and Mount Freeman is at the center of a ridge system to the west of that glacier.

==Major glaciers==
* Tucker Glacier , a major valley glacier, about long, flowing southeast between the Admiralty Mountains and the Victory Mountains to the Ross Sea. There is a snow saddle at the glacier&#x27;s head, just west of Homerun Range, from which the Ebbe Glacier flows northwestward.
* Pearl Harbor Glacier , a major tributary glacier flowing generally east from the Victory Mountains and entering the southwest side of Tucker Glacier northwest of Bypass Hill.
* Trafalgar Glacier , a tributary glacier about long, flowing east in the Victory Mountains to join Tucker Glacier below Bypass Hill.
* Borchgrevink Glacier , a large glacier in the Victory Mountains. It drains south between Malta Plateau and Daniell Peninsula, and thence projects into Glacier Strait, Ross Sea, as a floating glacier tongue. 
* Mariner Glacier , a major glacier over long, descending southeast from the plateau of Victoria Land, between Mountaineer Range and Malta Plateau, and terminating at Lady Newnes Bay, Ross Sea, where it forms the floating Mariner Glacier Tongue.

==Mountain groups==

*Monteath Hills , a group of mountains bounded by Jutland Glacier, Midway Glacier, Pearl Harbor Glacier, and Plata Glacier. The group includes Mount Crowder, Mount Tararua ( high), and Mount Holdsworth.
*Millen Range , a prominent northwest–southeast trending mountain range, located west of the Cartographers Range.
*Barker Range , a mountain range trending northwest–southeast and including Jato Nunatak, Mount Watt, Mount McCarthy, and Mount Burton, located at the southwest side of the Millen Range.
* Saxby Range , a broad mountain range, rising to . It is bounded by Jutland Glacier, Tucker Glacier, Pearl Harbor Glacier, and Midway Glacier.
*Cartographers Range , a rugged range about long. It is bounded on the north by Pearl Harbor Glacier, on the east by Tucker Glacier, and the south by Hearfield Glacier and Trafalgar Glacier.
*Malta Plateau , an ice-covered plateau of about extent in the Victory Mountains. The plateau is irregular in shape and is bounded on the south and west by Mariner Glacier, on the north by tributaries to Trafalgar Glacier, and on the east by tributaries to Borchgrevink Glacier.

Mountains in the center of mountain groups in the east include:

*Mount Riddolls , a very prominent mountain, high, situated directly at the head of Rudolph Glacier. 
*Mount Freeman , a prominent mountain, high, surmounting the base of Walker Ridge, northwest of Mount Lepanto.

<text>Lakeside Amusement Park is a family-owned amusement park in Lakeside, Colorado, adjacent to Denver. Opened in 1908, it is the oldest amusement park in Colorado still operating in its original location, and is the lone remaining American amusement park to have had the name White City. The park, comprising nearly half of the Town of Lakeside that it was responsible for creating in 1907, features the landmark Tower of Jewels.

==History==

Lakeside Park was built by a group led by Denver brewer Adolph Zang, on an approximately 57-acre site located adjacent to Lake Rhoda (then known as West Berkeley Lake). Originally known as both “Lakeside Park” and “The White City of the West,&quot; the park was built in the Exposition and White City architectural styles, and was lit by an estimated 100,000 electric bulbs. It was serviced by a trolley line built by the Denver Tramway, making it a trolley park; however, unlike most trolley parks, Lakeside was independently owned, and included ample space for automobile parking.

The park’s original buildings included the 150-foot Tower of Jewels at the park’s main entrance, a three-story Casino building featuring a theater and dining areas overlooking the lake, a natatorium, a 15,000 square foot ballroom, a roller skating rink, a boat house with a 160-foot pier, and a train station with clock tower, which was modeled after Denver&#x27;s Union Station. 

The main entrance led down a wide staircase to a central park area. Rides and attractions were originally grouped at the southern end of the park, with the park&#x27;s northern section reserved for social activities such as musical performances, ballroom dancing, boating, outdoor swimming and diving at the lake, and roller skating.

Original rides and attractions included the Lakeshore Railroad (a miniature railroad which circled the lake), a merry-go-round, a Ferris wheel, an airship and balloon ascension platform, a Third Degree funhouse, the Devil&#x27;s Palace (described as an &quot;interesting and instructing amusement&quot; featuring snakes and other reptiles), a Shoot-the-Chutes, a mile-long Scenic Railway, and the Velvet Coaster. W.H. Labb of Indianapolis designed the Velvet Coaster, intended to be a combination of the Foster coaster at Chicago&#x27;s White City and a type of figure-8; it featured a 1,200 foot (370 m) framework situated along the southern end of the lake, with a total of 3,600 feet (1,100 m) of track. A ride called The Tickler was installed, but was soon removed after customers received serious injuries, including broken bones.

The Derby Racer—a double-track racing coaster designed by John A. Miller—was added in 1911. The massive ride was built at the northern end of the park, which had previously been designated for social functions only, thus beginning a gradual move away from the park&#x27;s White City aspirations.

The Scenic Railway and other structures in the southwestern section of the park were destroyed by a fire on November 15, 1911. Another fire in January 1912 destroyed the skating rink and damaged the Derby coaster. The coaster was repaired, while the natatorium was converted into the new roller skating rink; it would not be used for swimming again until 1928.

Following its acquisition by Ben Krasner in 1935, Lakeside underwent a period of major renovations and additions, further distancing the park from its original White City/Exhibition roots. Many new rides were added, including the Cyclone roller coaster, which replaced the Derby Racer in 1940. New buildings and features were built in the Art Deco style, including individual ticket booths for most major rides and attractions. Although most of these booths were of the standalone type, one notable exception was the Cyclone, which had a built-in ticket booth between the entrance and exit ramps. Although ride tickets (as well as unlimited ride passes) are now sold at the park’s entrances rather than at each ride, many of the original ticket booths are still in place. Architect Richard L. Crowther designed much of Lakeside&#x27;s Art Deco and Modern features during this period, and included a great deal of neon lighting in his work.

There are many examples of architectural salvage to be found throughout the park. Inside the main restaurant is a marble and mirror backbar that was saved from the Denver Union Station, one of the picnic pavilions is created from a retired center column of a ride, and the pool for the Skoota Boats ride is an adaptive reuse of the original Shoot-the-Chutes ride. The main office features a functioning manual telephone switchboard that is still in use. 

A fire in December 1973 destroyed the pool building, which was then being used for maintenance and off-season storage. Parts and blueprints for many of the park&#x27;s rides (including the drive motors and cars for the Staride, a high-speed Ferris wheel-type ride installed circa 1916) were lost. Lakeside&#x27;s ballroom, which had hosted thousands of local and national musicians and performers throughout the park&#x27;s history, closed in 1972 due to declining interest in ballroom dancing. It was deemed a significant fire hazard and was largely demolished in 1974.

==Lakeside Speedway==
From the late 1930s through 1988, Lakeside Amusement Park operated Lakeside Speedway on the park grounds. The auto racetrack was a oval and featured races of three car classes sponsored by CARC: stock, limited modified and fully modified. The race track was built on the site of the park&#x27;s original baseball diamond and incorporated the original stands into the new use. Following a fatal accident in 1988, racing at Lakeside came to an end. The track and grandstands are still standing, and are used for storage.

==Rides==
===Roller coasters===
The Cyclone is the most popular ride at the park. Built in 1940 to replace the Derby Racer coaster, it is an ACE Coaster Classic and Coaster Landmark.


===Other amusement rides===
*Loop-O-Plane
*Satellite
*Hurricane
*Auto Skooters (Bumper Cars)
*Crystal Palace

Of note:
*Original rides from 1908 still in operation are the merry-go-round (although in a different location than originally installed) and the miniature railroad and train station. The Whip, installed circa 1916, is still in operation. The Staride, also installed circa 1916, has been standing but not operating since the mid 1970s.
*Lakeside&#x27;s gauge miniature railway train features the steam train locomotives &quot;Puffing Billy&quot; and &quot;Whistling Tom&quot; from the 1904 St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair along with the world&#x27;s first miniature gauge diesel locomotive, patterned after the California Zephyr.
*The 1908 carousel was apparently made up from used figures from other carousels. Many of the animals bear characteristic designs of famed woodcarver Charles I. D. Looff. The carousel has also been credited to the Parker company, but the Lakeside horses do not have the typical Parker metal horseshoes.
*Lakeside has every type of Eyerly &quot;O-Plane&quot; ride except for one: the &quot;Fly-O-Plane.&quot;

Carousel details:
:&quot;Type:&quot; 4 rows, Park, 3-level platform, all wood composition

===Former attractions===
Rides and attractions which no longer exist include the Shoot-The-Chutes (a splash-down water ramp ride, its lagoon now occupied by the Scoota Boats), the Scenic Railway, the Velvet Coaster, the Derby Racer coaster, a Coney Island Tickler, an Octopus, the Double-Whirl, the Lindy Loop, and the Circle Swing. The skeletal remains of the Staride stand north of the merry-go-round. The Rocket Ships ride (converted from an earlier sea plane ride) was removed in 1982 after damage during an inspection, but the base and tower still stand and are used as a concession stand. The pier for a Speed Boats attraction also stands vacant, fenced off to prevent access.

Other closed rides and attractions include the Tumble Bug (which operated from the 1930s until 1985), the Sky Slide (removed sometime in the 1970s), a miniature golf course (closed in the 1960s), the Paratrooper, Flight to Mars (a portable traveling dark ride that could be found at the park into the early 2000s), and Starship 2000.
From the mid 1940s through 1985, Lakeside&#x27;s Funhouse featured an animated mannequin, Laffing Sal, whose loud laughter echoed through the park and surrounding neighborhood. The attraction featured slides, moving floors, spinning discs, rolling barrels, and catwalks. Due to rising liability and operational costs, the Funhouse was demolished in 1985; the Dragon coaster was installed in its place.

The 1908 Casino Theater—home to exhibitions, concerts, plays, and dance marathons for decades—still stands but is closed to the public and is used for storage. Also still in place but closed to the public is the Riviera nightclub, the lone remnant of the park&#x27;s original ballroom.

== Lawsuit ==
In 2014, members of the Domino Service Dogs training group were denied access to the miniature train ride unless they wanted to leave their service dogs behind. As a result, the Cross Disability Coalition filed a lawsuit against the park alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Colorado&#x27;s laws ensuring access. The police department and the town of Lakeside were also included as defendants in the suit.
