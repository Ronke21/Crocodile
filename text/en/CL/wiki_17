<text>KATC (channel 3) is a television station in Lafayette, Louisiana, United States, affiliated since its inception with ABC. Owned by the E.W. Scripps Company, the station has studios on Eraste Landry Road in Lafayette, and its transmitter is located near Branch, Louisiana.

==History==
The station began operations on September 19, 1962, and was locally owned by Acadian Television Company. Conventional wisdom suggested it should have signed on as an NBC affiliate, but instead it took the ABC affiliation full-time. Previously, ABC had been limited to off-hours clearances on CBS affiliate KLFY-TV (channel 10). This was a very unusual move for a then two-station market, especially one of Lafayette&#x27;s size. Usually, ABC, as the smallest and weakest network, was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations. However, most of the region could view the full NBC schedule on Lake Charles&#x27; KPLC-TV and Baton Rouge&#x27;s WBRZ-TV (the latter now a fellow ABC affiliate), both of which provided at least grade B coverage to much of the market. In contrast, no ABC affiliate even put a grade B signal into the area. Acadian Television apparently figured that if it linked up with ABC, it would not get much local competition.

KATC coined the term &quot;Acadiana&quot; in the early 1960s and popularized it throughout south Louisiana. In early 1963, the ABC affiliate received an invoice erroneously addressed to the Acadiana Television Corp.; someone had typed an extra &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word &quot;Acadian&quot;. The station started using it to describe the region covered by its broadcast signal.

Acadian Television sold the station to Loyola University New Orleans in 1982, making it a sister station to New Orleans&#x27; CBS affiliate, WWL-TV. In the late 1980s, Loyola divested their broadcast properties, with WWL-TV going to a group of station employees (Rampart Operating Partnership) in 1990 and KATC going to investment firm Merrill Lynch in 1986. In 1993, the station joined other ABC affiliates, including WBRZ in not airing the pilot to &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. In 1995, The Evening Post Publishing Company purchased the station through its subsidiary Cordillera Communications. In 2003, the station started broadcasting in stereo.

KATC continued to use its transmitter for its analog signal located south of Crowley, Louisiana, until the mandated digital date of June 12, 2009. KATC is also an alternate ABC affiliate for Lake Charles and Southwest Louisiana. That area did not have an ABC affiliate of its own until August 31, 2017, when Fox affiliate KVHP launched an ABC-affiliated subchannel on DT2. Due to its strong signal, KATC can also be seen in most of the Baton Rouge region.

Cordillera announced on October 29, 2018, it would sell most of its stations, including KATC, to the E. W. Scripps Company. The sale was completed on May 1, 2019. Upon completion of the sale, KATC became Scripps&#x27; first station in the state of Louisiana.

On April 19, 2024, Nexstar Media Group, majority owner of The CW, announced that the network would not renew its affiliations with Scripps-owned stations, including KATC; in the Lafayette market, the affiliation moved to a subchannel of Nexstar-owned KLFY-TV effective September 23, while channel 3.2 assumed the Laff affiliation on that date.

==Newscasts==

KATC produces local news and talk programming, with such shows as &quot;Good Morning Acadiana&quot;, &quot;Friday Night Football&quot; and &quot;hard-news&quot; newscasts that air weekdays at 5, 6, and 10 p.m., Saturdays at 6 and 10 p.m., and on Sundays at 5:30 and 10 p.m. On April 16, 2012, KATC began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition. The station also debuted a brand new logo, graphics package and new set and redesigned newsroom.

Historically, KATC was a very distant runner-up to KLFY. Although its various owners have always poured significant resources into its news department, KATC was hamstrung by KLFY&#x27;s seven-year head start. In the 2000s, KATC began to achieve traction in the ratings against KLFY by recruiting talent from KLFY&#x27;s news staff. In turn, KLFY was undergoing numerous ownership and programming changes, largely jettisoning the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; format it had used during much of its history.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
Prior to June 14, 2010, KLWB (channel 50) was Lafayette&#x27;s CW affiliate. It had since moved to KATC 3.2. Grit was added by former owner Cordillera on June 28, 2016. Court TV and Bounce were added after Scripps purchased KATC. Court TV on its initial launch May 8, 2019, and Bounce March 5, 2021 (which gives every TV market in Louisiana the network).

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KATC shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 3, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28, using virtual channel 3.

<text>Proas are various types of multi-hull outrigger sailboats of the Austronesian peoples. The terms were used for native Austronesian ships in European records during the Colonial era indiscriminately, and thus can confusingly refer to the double-ended single-outrigger boats of Oceania, the double-outrigger boats of Island Southeast Asia, and sometimes ships with no outriggers or sails at all.

In its most common usage, the term &quot;proa&quot; refers to the Pacific proas which consist of two (usually) unequal-length parallel hulls. It is sailed so that one hull is kept to windward, and the other to leeward. It is double-ended, since it needs to &quot;shunt&quot; to reverse direction when tacking. It is most famously used for the &quot;sakman&quot; ships of the Chamorro people of the Northern Marianas, which were known as the &quot;flying proas&quot; for their remarkable speed.

In Island Southeast Asia, the term &quot;proa&quot; may also sometimes be used, but the terms perahu, prau, prahu, paraw and prow are more common. These differ from the Pacific proas in that they are not double-ended and have a trimaran configuration with two outriggers. These are widely used in the native ships of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and continue to be used today as traditional fishing, cargo, and transport vessels.

Proas are traditionally rigged with the crab claw and tanja sails. The modern proa exists in a wide variety of forms, from the traditional archetype still common in areas described, to high-technology interpretations specifically designed for breaking speed-sailing records.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;proa&quot; originates from Early Modern English &quot;prow&quot; or &quot;praw&quot;. It probably entered the English language via Dutch &quot;prauw&quot; and Portuguese &quot;parau&quot;, similar to Spanish &quot;proa&quot;, meaning &quot;bow&quot;. It is likely ultimately derived from Malay &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;boat&quot;, from the Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian doublets *parahu and *padaw, both meaning &quot;sailboat&quot;. Its cognates in other Austronesian languages include Javanese &quot;prau&quot;, Sundanese &quot;parahu&quot;, Kadazan &quot;padau&quot;, Maranao &quot;padaw&quot;, Cebuano &quot;paráw&quot;, Ngadha &quot;barau&quot;, Kiribati &quot;baurua&quot;, Samoan &quot;folau&quot;, Hawaiian &quot;halau&quot;, and Māori &quot;wharau&quot;.

==History==

Catamarans and outrigger boats were very early innovations of the Austronesian peoples and were the first true ocean-going ships capable of crossing vast distances of water. This enabled the Austronesian peoples to rapidly spread from Taiwan and colonize the islands of both the Pacific and Indian oceans since at least 2200 BC. The first outriggers evolved from the more primitive double-hulled catamarans. There are two types of outrigger ships based on the number of outriggers: the single-outriggers (which include catamarans with unequal hulls) and the double-outriggers (sometimes called trimarans). Single-outriggers evolved first and are the dominant form of Austronesians ships in Oceania and Madagascar. They have largely been replaced by the more versatile double-outrigger ships in Island Southeast Asia. Double-outrigger forms, however, are absent entirely in Oceania.

Catamaran and outrigger technologies were introduced by Austronesian traders from Southeast Asia to the Dravidian-speaking peoples of Sri Lanka and Southern India as early as 1000 to 600 BC. This is still evident in the terms for &quot;boat&quot; in Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada (&quot;paṭavu&quot;, &quot;paḍava&quot;, and &quot;paḍahu&quot;, respectively), which are all cognates of Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian *padaw. Early contact by Austronesians with Arab sailors may have also influenced the development of the lateen sail in western ship traditions, derived from the more ancient Austronesian crab claw sail.

Many of these traditional vessels are now extinct. Either lost during the colonial period or supplanted in modern times by western boat designs or fitted with motor engines.

==Historical descriptions of the proa==

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to encounter the double-outrigger Southeast Asian ships, initially with derivative vessels from the Malabar Coast, which they called the &quot;parau&quot;. They applied the same name to similar ships in their colonies in Southeast Asia. Similarly, the Dutch encountered them when they colonized the islands of Indonesia, calling them &quot;prauw&quot;. This was rendered as &quot;praw&quot; by the British, later evolving to &quot;proa&quot;. In French territories in the Pacific Islands, they were known by the more general term &quot;pirogue&quot;. Although technically restricted to outrigger sailing vessels, European sources often applied the term indiscriminately to any native ships of Southeast Asia.
The earliest written accounts of the single-outrigger Pacific proa (though not by name) were by the Venetian scholar Antonio Pigafetta, who was part of Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s 1519–1522 circumnavigation. They encountered the native &quot;sakman&quot; ships of the Chamorro people in the Islas de los Ladrones (Mariana Islands). Pigafetta describes the outrigger layout of the &quot;sakman&quot;, and ability to switch bow for stern, and also notes its speed and maneuverability, noting, &quot;And although the ships were under full sail, they passed between them and the small boats (fastened astern), very adroitly in those small boats of theirs.&quot; Pigafetta likened the &quot;sakman&quot; to the Venetian &quot;fisolere&quot;, a narrow variety of gondola.
The accounts of Magellan&#x27;s crew were the first to describe the Chamorro proas as &quot;flying&quot;. The subsequent colonization of the Micronesia and the Philippines provided further references to proas in Spanish records. They also described double-outrigger ships from the Philippines, like the account of the &quot;karakoa&quot; in Francisco Ignacio Alcina&#x27;s &quot;Historia de las islas e indios de Bisayas&quot; (1668) which describes them as &quot;sailing like birds.&quot;

During his 1740–1744 circumnavigation, Lord Anson applied the term proa to the double-ended Micronesian single-outrigger ships. His fleet captured one in 1742, and Lt. Peircy Brett of made a detailed sketch of the proa. Rev. Richard Walter, chaplain of &quot;Centurion&quot;, estimated the speed of the proa at twenty miles per hour (32 km/h). Although aware of earlier Spanish accounts of the boats of the Spanish East Indies, Anson&#x27;s account was the first detailed description of a Pacific proa to the English-speaking world. In the subsequent voyages of James Cook in Polynesia, he referred to the similar native single-outrigger canoes there as &quot;proes&quot;, differentiating them from the double-hulled catamarans which he called &quot;pahee&quot; (Tahitian &quot;pahi&quot;).

These accounts fascinated both the British and American public, ushering in a period of interest in the design by sports sailors. Working from the drawings and descriptions of explorers, western builders often took liberties with the traditional designs, merging their interpretation of native designs with Western boat building methods. Thus this Western &quot;proa&quot; often diverged radically from the traditional &quot;proa&quot; to the point that the only shared feature was the windward/leeward hull arrangement. 
:&quot;The Proa darted like a shooting star&quot;
:Lord Byron, &quot;The Island&quot;, 1823

==Modern variations==

In the Marshall Islands, where the craft were traditionally built, there has been a resurgence of interest in the proa. People hold annual kor-kor races in the lagoon at Majuro, along with events such as a children&#x27;s riwut race. The kor-kors are built in traditional style out of traditional materials, though the sails are made with modern materials (often inexpensive polyethylene tarpaulins, commonly known as &quot;polytarp&quot;).

A loose group of individuals from all over the world has formed from those interested in the proa, including people with a historical perspective and those with a scientific and engineering perspective. Many such individuals are members of the Amateur Yacht Research Society.

==Early Western proas==
In the late 19th century and early 20th century, many in Europe and America became interested in the proa. Western boat builders such as R. M. Munroe and Robert Barnwell Roosevelt (Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s uncle) reflected its influence. Into the 20th century, the proa was one of the fastest sailing craft that existed. The proa design is still the basis for many boats involved in speed sailing.

The first well-documented Western version of the proa was built in 1898 by Commodore Ralph Middleton Munroe of the Biscayne Bay Yacht Club. Yacht-design giant Nathanael Herreshoff, a friend of Munroe, may have also had an interest in the project. A small model of the Anson-Brett proa is collected at the Herreshoff Marine Museum in Rhode Island; its maker is uncertain.

Over the following years, Munroe built several more. They were all destroyed by the mid-1930s, when a severe hurricane leveled Munroe&#x27;s bayside boatshop. At least two of his designs were documented in articles in &quot;The Rudder&quot;, as was one by Robert B. Roosevelt. Small proas may have been brought back to the United States in the late 19th century, but documentation is sparse. Munroe and Roosevelt appeared to be the first two builders to adapt the proa to Western building techniques.

===Royal Mersey Yacht Club===
In 1860 a member of the Royal Mersey Yacht Club in England built a copy of a Micronesian proa. He used the traditional asymmetric hull, flat on the lee side, and a decked dugout ama (outrigger). While no quantitative record was made of its speed, it was noted that the proa would run at speeds that would bury the bows of any other vessel. It carried three times the ratio of sail area to immersed midships section than the fastest yachts in the club and yet drew only .

===Munroe&#x27;s 1898 proa===

Since Munroe had no direct experience with proas, all he had to work with was the widely distributed and incorrect plan drawing from about 1742, made during Admiral Lord Anson&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe. This drawing had been circulated in the press, for example in William Alden&#x27;s articles in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. (These were reprinted in a small book called &quot;The Canoe and the Flying Proa&quot;.) This proa was one of several either captured or seen under sail when Anson stopped at Tinian during a Pacific crossing. Brett, the draughtsman of the plan, is thought by some to have misinterpreted one key element, showing the mast fixed vertically in the center of the boat. This view as based on the fact that other Micronesian proa masts were raked end-to-end as the vessel shunted and the fact that a raked mast shifts the center of effort of the sail which would influence helm balance. However, Brett&#x27;s placing of the mast in a vertical position has found to be accurate when replicas of the &quot;Anson&quot; proa were built and sailed by the Marinas-based organization 500 Sails that found that in many points of sail under many conditions the proa sailed well with the mast in a vertical position. 500 Sails also found that the mast could be raked to advantage in many situations and noted that the mast step depicted in the &quot;Anson&quot; drawing could be interpreted as depicting a rotational point rather than a rigid mast step that would not allow raking. 500 Sails canoes employ rotational mast steps that allow mast raking.

Munroe, however, was a talented boat designer who was able to work around any problems with the drawings. His adaptations can be seen in successive proas. Rather than the deep, asymmetric hull of a traditional proa, Munroe created flat-bottomed hulls (similar to the &quot;fisolera&quot; referred to by Pigafetta), with keels or centerboards for lateral resistance. His first iteration had an iron center fin with a half-oval profile. Rather than the traditional crab-claw sail&#x27;s spars which meet at the front, Munroe&#x27;s sails used what could be described as a triangular lug sail or spritsail with a boom, similar to the modern lateen sail with a shorter upper spar.

Munroe&#x27;s first proa was only long, yet was capable of speeds which Munroe estimated at . His article in &quot;The Rudder&quot; describes what can only be planing on the flat hull. As this was before the advent of planing power boats, this proa was one of the first boats capable of planing. This helped produce its amazing speed when most boats were limited to their hull speed—they had too little power to achieve planing speed, and yet were not designed to exceed hull speed without planing. For example, a boat with too little power to plane, and with a hull form and displacement that didn&#x27;t permit it to exceed hull speed without planing, would have a maximum speed of about ; Munroe&#x27;s proa could reach nearly 2.5 times that speed. This accomplishment was the nautical equivalent to the X-1 breaking the sound barrier.

It is not clear that traditional proas of the Pacific islanders could plane, though the long, slender hull would have a much higher speed/length ratio than other contemporary designs. Munroe was building a &quot;cheap and dirty&quot; sharpie hull made of two planks, a couple of bulkheads and a crossplanked bottom. By lucky accident he may have been the first sailor to plane his boat.

===Roosevelt&#x27;s Mary &amp; Lamb===
Robert Barnwell Roosevelt, uncle of American President Theodore Roosevelt, also built a proa at about the same time. He used it sailing from Long Island. It was significantly different but equally creative, and at , much longer. From his 1898 article in &quot;The Rudder&quot;, it appeared the main hull of Roosevelt&#x27;s proa was an open wide scow hull; the ama was a smaller, fully decked scow which looked like it could rock on a single aka (supporting beam). The mast was a bipod arrangement with both masts stepped to windward, with a boomed, balanced lugsail suspended from the apex. A balanced rudder at each end managed itself by pivoting 180° when its end was the &quot;bow&quot;, and leeboards were used.

Roosevelt&#x27;s short article is accompanied by photographs showing his proa &quot;Mary &amp; Lamb&quot;, at rest and under sail. It is not clear if the boat predated Munroe&#x27;s 1898 proa.

===Munroe&#x27;s 1900 Proa===

Since Munroe wasn&#x27;t aware of the raking mast, his 1900 model used two daggerboards set fore and aft of the mast, which would allow adjustment of the center of lateral resistance to provide helm balance. From the drawings, it appears the mast is higher as well, allowing a larger sail. The sail design also changed, with the upper spar now being slightly longer than the upper edge of the sail, and projecting past the apex slightly to allow the apex to be attached to the hull. The sail was loose footed, with the boom attached to the upper spar near the sail apex, and to the clew of the sail. His article in a 1900 issue of &quot;The Rudder&quot; included more details on the construction of his second proa. A 1948 book of sailboat plans published by &quot;The Rudder&quot; includes the following specifications for the 1900 proa:

* Length overall 
* Beam (of main hull) 
* Draft of hull about 
* Draft with boards down 
* Sail area 

From the drawings, the distance from the center of the main hull to the center of the aka is about .

==Other Western interpretations==
Western designers often feel the need to tinker with the proa. They are attracted by the minimalist nature and amazing speeds that proas are capable of (they may still be the fastest sailboats per dollar spent for the home builder) but they often want the proa to do more; adding cabins, different sailing rigs, and bidirectional rudders are common changes made. James Wharram was greatly influenced by the Proa design.

For example, unconventional boat and yacht designer Phil Bolger drew at least three proa designs; the smallest one (20 ft) has been built by several people while the larger two, including his Proa 60, have not been built. For additional examples, see here.

===Lee pods===

The terms ama and aka have been adopted for the modern trimaran. Since trimarans are generally designed to sail with one ama out of the water, they are similar to an Atlantic proa, with the buoyant leeward ama providing the bulk of the stability for the long, relatively thin main hull. Some modern proa designers have borrowed trimaran design elements for use in proas. Trimarans often have main hulls that are very narrow at the waterline, and flare out and extend over a significant portion of the akas. This topheavy design is only practical in a multihull, and it has been adapted by some proa designers. Notable examples are the designs of Russell Brown, a boat-fittings maker who designed and built his first proa, &quot;Jzero&quot;, in the mid-1970s. He has created a number of proa designs, all of which follow the same theme.

One of the design elements which Brown used, and a number of other designers have copied, is the &quot;lee pod&quot;. The akas extend past the main hull and out to the lee side, and provide support for a cabin extending to the lee of the main hull. This is similar to the platform extending to the lee on some Micronesian proas. The lee pod serves two purposes—it can be used for bunk space or storage, and it provides additional buoyancy on the lee side to prevent a capsize should the boat heel too far. Crew can also be moved onto the lee pod to provide additional heeling force in light winds, allowing the ama to lift under circumstances when it would not otherwise. The &quot;Jzero&quot; also used water ballast in the ama to allow the righting moment to be significantly increased if needed. While Brown&#x27;s proa was designed to be a cruising yacht, not a speed-sailing boat, the newer &quot;Jzerro&quot; is capable of speeds of up to .

===Sail rigs===
One of the issues Western designers have with the proa is the need to manipulate the sail when shunting. Even Munroe&#x27;s early sails discarded the curved yards of the traditional crabclaw for the more familiar straight yards of the lateen and lug sails. Munroe&#x27;s designs likely lacked the tilting mast because he was unaware of it, but many designers since have used a fixed mast, and provided some other way of adjusting the center of effort. Most sailboats are designed with the center of effort of the sails slightly ahead of the center of area of the underwater plane; this difference is called &quot;lead.&quot; In a proa hull, and in all fore and aft symmetric foils, the center of resistance is not at or even near the center of the boat, it is well forward of the geometric center of area. Thus the center of effort of the sails needs to also be well forward, or at least needs to have a sail which is well forward which can be sheeted in to start the boat moving, allowing the rudders to bite and keep the boat from heading up when the entire sail area is sheeted in. Jzero, for example, and all of Russell Brown&#x27;s other designs, use a sloop rig and hoist a jib on whichever end is the current &quot;bow&quot;. Other designs use a schooner rig for the same effect.

One of the more practical rigs for small proas was invented by Euell Gibbons around 1950 for a small, single handed proa. This rig was a loose footed lateen sail hung from a centered mast. The sail was symmetric across the yard, and to shunt, what was previously the top end of the yard was lowered and became the bottom end, reversing the direction of the sail. Proa enthusiast Gary Dierking modified this design further, using a curved yard and a boom perpendicular to the yard. This allows a greater control of the sail shape than the traditional Gibbons rig, while retaining the simple shunting method, and is often referred to as the Gibbons/Dierking rig.

===Foils===
While a proa is fairly efficient at minimizing the amount of wave drag and maximizing stability, there is at least one way to go even further. The use of underwater foils to provide lift or downforce has been a popular idea recently in cutting-edge yacht building, and the proa is not immune to this influence.

The Bruce foil is a foil that provides a lateral resistance with zero heeling moment by placing the foil to either or both of the leeward and the windward sides, angled so the direction of the force passes through the center of effort of the sail. Since proas already have an outrigger to the windward side, a simple angled foil mounted on the ama becomes a Bruce foil, making the already stable proa even more stable. Bruce foils are often combined with inclined rigs, which results in a total cancellation of heeling forces. Inclined rigs are also well suited to the proa, as the direction of incline remains constant during shunting.

Another use of foils is to provide lift, turning the boat into a hydrofoil. Hydrofoils require significant speeds to work, but once the hull is lifted out of the water, the drag is significantly reduced. Many speed sailing designs have been based on a proa type configuration equipped with lifting foils.

===Variations on the theme===
In a non-traditional variant, first seen among Western yacht racers, the &quot;Atlantic proa&quot; has an ama which is always to the lee side to provide buoyancy for stability, rather than ballast as in a traditional proa. Because the Atlantic ama is at least as long as the main hull, to reduce wave drag, this style can also be thought of as an asymmetric catamaran that shunts rather than tacking. The first Atlantic proa was the &quot;Cheers&quot;, designed in 1968 by boat designer Dick Newick for the 1968 OSTAR solo transatlantic race, in which it placed third. Newkirk&#x27;s designs are primarily trimarans, and the Atlantic proa&#x27;s buoyant outrigger follows naturally from a conversion of a trimaran from a tacking to a shunting vessel.

Other proa designers blur the lines between Atlantic and Pacific style proas. The &quot;Harryproa&quot; from Australia uses a long, thin hull to lee, and a short, fat hull, containing the cabin, to windward. This would normally be more like an Atlantic proa, but the rig is on the lee hull, leaving it technically a Pacific design. This and other similar proas place the bulk of the passenger accommodations on the ama, in an attempt to make the vaka as streamlined as possible, and put much of the mass in the lee side to provide a greater righting moment.

Perhaps the most extreme variants of the proa are the ones designed for pure speed. These often completely discard symmetry, and are designed to sail only in one direction relative to the wind; performance in the other direction is either seriously compromised or impossible. These are &quot;one way&quot; proas, such as world record speed holding Yellow Pages Endeavour, or &quot;YPE&quot;. While the YPE is often called a trimaran, it would be more correct to call it a Pacific proa, because two of the planing/hydrofoil hulls are in line. This design has been considered by others as well, such as the &quot;Monomaran&quot; designs by &quot;The 40 knot Sailboat&quot; author Bernard Smith, and these designs been called &quot;3-point proas&quot; by some, a reference to the 3 point hulls used in hydroplanes. A previous record holding design, the &quot;Crossbow II&quot;, owned by Timothy Colman was a proa/catamaran hybrid. Crossbow II was a &quot;slewing&quot; catamaran, able to slew her hulls to allow clear airflow to her leeward bipod sail. Although the hulls appeared identical, the boat had all crew and controls, cockpit etc. in her windward hull; the leeward hull was stripped bare for minimal weight.

==Speed records==
In March 2009, two new sailing speed records were set by vehicles based on the proa concept, one on land, and one on the water.

On March 26, 2009, Simon McKeon and Tim Daddo set a new C-class speed sailing record of over 500 meters in the &quot;Macquarie Innovation&quot;, successor to their previous record holding &quot;Yellow Pages Endeavour&quot;, with a peak speed of . The record was set in winds of 22 to , and came close to taking the absolute speed record on water, currently held by &quot;Hydroptère&quot;. Conditions during the record-setting run were less than ideal for the &quot;Macquarie Innovation&quot;, which is anticipated to have a top speed of – .

On March 27, 2009, Richard Jenkins set a world wind-powered speed record, on land, of 126.1 miles per hour (202.9 km/h) in the Ecotricity &quot;Greenbird&quot;. This broke the previous record by 10 miles per hour (16 km/h). &quot;Greenbird&quot; is based on a one-way proa design, with a long, thin two-wheeled body with a third wheel to the lee acting as an ama. The aka, which is in the shape of a wing, provides a significant amount of downwards force at speed to counter the heeling force generated by the high-aspect wing sail.

<doc id="1158925" wikidata="Q1999681" url="?curid=1158925" title="Anal stage">
<text>The anal stage is the second stage in Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of psychosexual development, taking place approximately between the ages of 18 months and three years. In this stage, the anal erogenous zone becomes the primary focus of the child&#x27;s libidinal energy. The main social context for the experience is the process of toilet training, where anal pleasure becomes associated with the control of bowel movements.

According to Freud&#x27;s theory, personality is developed through a series of stages, focused on erogenous areas, throughout childhood. 
A healthy personality in adulthood is dependent upon all of these childhood stages being resolved successfully. If issues are not resolved in a stage, then fixation can occur, potentially resulting in neurotic tendencies or psychological disturbance. A fixation at this stage can result in a personality that is too rigid or one that is too disordered.

==General information==
The anal stage, in Freudian psychology, is the period of human development occurring at about one to three years of age. Around this age, the child begins to toilet train, which brings about the child&#x27;s fascination in the erogenous zone of the anus. The erogenous zone is focused on the bowel and bladder control. Therefore, Freud believed that the libido was mainly focused on controlling the bladder and bowel movements. The anal stage coincides with the start of the child&#x27;s ability to control their anal sphincter, and therefore their ability to pass or withhold feces at will. If the children during this stage can overcome the conflict it will result in a sense of accomplishment and independence.

==Conflict==
This is the second stage of Freud&#x27;s psychosexual stages. This stage represents a conflict with the id, ego, and superego. The child is approached with this conflict with the parent&#x27;s demands. A successful completion of this stage depends on how the parents interact with the child while toilet training. If a parent praises the child and gives rewards for using the toilet properly and at the right times then the child will successfully go through the stage. However, if a parent ridicules and punishes a child while they are at this stage, the child can respond in negative ways.
==Parents&#x27; role==
As mentioned before the ability for the children to be successful in this stage is solely dependent upon their parents and the approach they use towards toilet training. Freud believed that parents should promote the use of toilet training with praise and rewards. The use of positive reinforcement after using the toilet at the appropriate times encourages positive outcomes. This will help reinforce the feeling that the child is capable of controlling their bladder. The parents help make the outcome of this stage a positive experience which in turn will lead to a competent, productive, and creative adult. This stage is also important in the child&#x27;s future relationships with authority.

According to Freud&#x27;s Psychosexual Theory, parents need to be very careful in how they react to their children during this sensitive stage. During this stage children test their parents, the authority figures, on how much power they really have as opposed to how much room the child has to make his or her own decisions.

==Anal-retentive personality==

Negative parent-child interactions in the anal stage, including early or harsh toilet training, can lead to the development of an anal-retentive personality. If the parents are too forceful or harsh in training the child to control their own bowel movements, the child may react by deliberately retaining their bowel movements in rebellion. They will form into an adult who hates mess, and is obsessively tidy, punctual, and respectful to authority. These adults can sometimes be stubborn and be very careful with their money.

==Anal-expulsive personality==

Overly passive parent-child interactions in the anal stage lead to the development of an anal-expulsive personality. Because the child&#x27;s parents were inconsistent or neglectful in teaching the child to control their own bowel movements, the child may relieve themselves at inappropriate times and soil their pants in rebellion against using the toilet. As adults, they will want to share things with their peers and give things away. They can sometimes be messy, disorganized, and rebellious. They may also be inconsiderate of others&#x27; feelings.

<doc id="1158931" wikidata="Q1394659" url="?curid=1158931" title="Gravity knife">
<text>A gravity knife is a knife with a blade contained in its handle, which opens its blade through the force of gravity. This mechanism of opening is fundamentally different from the switchblade, which extends its spring-propelled blade automatically upon the push of a button, switch, or fulcrum lever. The main purpose of gravity opening is that it allows opening and closing to be done with one hand, in situations where the other hand is occupied. Hence, historically they have been issued to parachutists to cut off caught lines, such as lines tangled in trees, a major potential use of the gravity knife.

The gravity knife uses a button, trigger, or fulcrum lever to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions, and may use a side-folding or telescoping (out-the-front, or OTF) blade. While most military gravity knives utilize a locking blade design, other types may not mechanically lock open but rely instead upon friction to wedge the rear section of the blade against the interior of the handle. Factory-made gravity knives have various types of buttons, triggers, and fulcrum levers, which usually are used to release the blade from both the open and the closed positions.

==Design and operation==

===Flieger-Kappmesser / Luftwaffe Gravity Knife (LGK)=== 

One of the most recognizable gravity knives is the World War II-era (), which utilizes a telescoping (OTF), gravity-propelled locking blade. First produced in 1937, the often so called () was initially issued to German flight crews and paratroops, primarily for the purpose of cutting a trapped parachutist from his rigging in case he landed with a tangled parachute, or became entangled in trees or in the water with the shroud lines. The spike was used to untie knots while packing the parachutes. Luftwaffe air crew members used the knife to cut themselves out of their harnesses or cut through the aluminum hull of the aircraft after a crash landing. Though not intended for use as a fighting knife in the first place, the LGK was introduced to the 1st Skijäger Division and SS units on the Eastern Front to be used primarily as a close combat weapon from 1944 on.

The uses a sliding blade inside a metal gripframe, which was originally fitted with smooth wood scales. The blade itself is a relatively blunt spear-point, and the profile is flat ground, tapering to a utility edge. To open the blade, the user points the knife downwards while flipping up the fulcrum-style operating lever, allowing gravity to draw out the blade to its fullest extent. Releasing the lever locks the blade into position. The LGK may also be opened by flipping the blade release lever while flicking the wrist holding the knife, causing the blade to extend. The LGK was also equipped with a folding marlinspike or awl. Primarily intended for untangling rope knots, it was also used as a prying tool or to fix jammed weapons. The spike does not lock when opened and was never intended to be used as a combat weapon.

There are two principal types of wartime-era with altogether 10 known variations. The Type I LGK (three manufacturers, five WWII variations) has wood scales (handle), was made from 1937 to 1943, and unlike successive models has no takedown capability. The Type II LGK (two manufacturers, five WWII variations) is the same knife, but with takedown features, and was produced from 1943 until 1945 and then again from c. 1950 until 1965. 
After the end of World War II, the newly organized West German placed new orders with German cutlery manufacturers for a postwar version of the for issue to the Army´s airborne forces and tank crews. The West German abandoned the gravity knife concept completely and purchased completely different rescue knives including a shroud line cutter. The initial Type III &quot;trap door&quot; gravity knife, made from 1955 to 1961, did not prove to be very reliable and thus, the original WWII Type II design was reintroduced until it was finally replaced by the early Type IV knives in about 1968. The Type IV LGK is very similar to the WWII-production Type II takedown knife, but features plastic polymer instead of wooden scales and was made by WMF, OFW and Eickhorn from 1972 to 1984. They were issued to soldiers until 2017. The third West German post-war model is the Type V LGK, initially named AES79 and still today produced under the designation LL80 (1979–present) by Eickhorn. The LL80 is smaller, has fewer parts and is more cost-effective to produce than earlier . It was procured by the Swiss Air Force and issued to their Dassault Mirage pilots in 1983. These knives are marked AES83 and bear the number of the aircraft of the metal head.

On the other side of the Iron Curtain, in the German Democratic Republic, WWII gravity knives were refurbished and re-issued to the paratroopers and pilots until the existing stock was gone. In the early 1960s two companies then produced an East German version of the Type I knives. They were then used until the early 1970s.

===Ibberson gravity knife===
After British forces had captured numbers of Type I , the British government approached George Ibberson &amp; Co. of Sheffield, England, a knife and cutlery manufacturer, and requested production of a British version of the German Luftwaffe Gravity Knife for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and other clandestine warfare units. Under the initial wartime contract, George Ibberson &amp; Co. made 500 gravity knives for issue to the SOE and other special forces. These Sheffield gravity knives had smooth wood or textured plastic scales, but were otherwise identical in features and operation to the Type I , with a locking gravity-deployed blade and a folding rigging spike or awl. In the hands of British SOE agents, the Sheffield gravity knife was considered to be a secondary combat weapon. In addition to the knife blade, SOE close combat instructors found that the folding rigging spike was useful for silent killing of sentries by opening the carotid artery on the neck.

===&#x27;False gravity&#x27; and non-gravity knives===
Some folding or telescoping knives that can open their blades by force of inertia or gravity were not intended or advertised by the manufacturer to do so. Knives that will lock their blades open, but do not have any closed position lock device, are referred to as &quot;false&quot; gravity blades.
The illustration shows the internal parts of a 1960s Japanese import &#x27;false&#x27; gravity knife. Other knives may be considered to be &#x27;false&#x27; gravity knives, including certain lock-back and liner lock folding knives that will not lock a blade in both open and closed positions.

After the passage of the Switchblade Knife Act in the U.S. in 1958, it was discovered that some U.S. businesses were importing folding stiletto knives without spring mechanisms that did not have a pronounced blade heel (internal surface) in the pivot area allowing the longer bladed models to easily flick open. Modern (post 1965) folding stilettos imported or distributed in the U.S. now have blade heels that are intentionally pointed and ratchet against the lockback mechanism, preventing inertia opening.

Other knives commonly mistaken for gravity knives include the automatic OTF knife, the switchblade and the butterfly knives (or balisong), the sliding knife, penny knife, and occasionally even common folding hunting knives such as the Buck 110 Folding Hunter.

===Other===

The &#x27;conversion&#x27; gravity knife consists of a standard folding knife fitted with after-market modifications. The knife pictured does not lock closed, and is thus classed as a &#x27;false&#x27; gravity knife. It can still be opened manually without touching the toggle switch. The addition of the toggle, which is attached to an internal bellcrank-arm, will lift the lockback mechanism to allow the blade to swing more easily.

==Legality==

In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, Canada, and in some U.S. states, a gravity knife is proscribed under the law as a prohibited weapon, with attendant criminal penalties. Other laws may criminalize the ownership, sale, importation, or carrying of a gravity knife upon one&#x27;s person, either concealed or unconcealed. In the United States, some state criminal codes prohibit either the ownership or the carrying of gravity knives, either by name or by including a functional description of their opening mechanisms. Other state criminal codes bar gravity knives by redefining them variously as switchblades or butterfly knives. Local jurisdictions including cities and counties may also restrict the ownership or carrying of gravity knives.

In a few jurisdictions, such as Colorado and New York City, courts have periodically attempted to classify ordinary lock-blade folding knives with a blade that may be opened by centrifugal force (normally, using a flicking motion of the wrist) as a gravity knife, thus making the knife&#x27;s owner subject to the same criminal penalties imposed for illegal possession of a gravity knife. The New York statute banning gravity knives has been declared &quot;unconstitutionally vague&quot; by a federal District Court in March 2019. New York State legalized the possession of gravity knives on May 30, 2019 but New York City retains its ban on public transport.

<doc id="1158934" wikidata="Q3345491" url="?curid=1158934" title="Rabindra Sangeet">
<text>Rabindra Sangeet (; ), also known as Tagore Songs, are songs from the Indian subcontinent written and composed by the Bengali polymath Rabindranath Tagore, winner of the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature, the first Indian and also the first non-European to receive such recognition. Tagore was a prolific composer, with approximately 2,232 songs to his credit. The songs have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh. It is characterised by its distinctive rendition while singing which, includes a significant amount of ornamentation like meend, murki, etc. and is filled with expressions of romanticism. The music is mostly based on Hindustani classical music, Carnatic music, Western tunes and the traditional folk music of Bengal and inherently possess within them, a perfect balance, an endearing economy of poetry and musicality. Lyrics and music both hold almost equal importance in Rabindra Sangeet. Tagore created some six new taals, inspired by Carnatic talas, because he felt the traditional taals existing at the time could not do justice and were coming in the way of the seamless narrative of the lyrics.

==History==

The name Rabindra Sangeet was first introduced by the noted Indian author, economist and sociologist Dhurjati Prasad Mukherjee in the anthology &quot;Jayanti Utsarga,&quot; published on 27 December 1931, to commemorate Tagore&#x27;s 70th birthday.

Rabindra Sangeet merges fluidly into Tagore&#x27;s literature, most of which—poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike—were lyricised. Influenced by the &quot;thumri&quot; style of Hindustani music, they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions. They emulated the tonal color of classical &quot;ragas&quot; to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga&#x27;s melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different &quot;ragas&quot;. Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not &quot;bhanga gaan&quot;, the body of tunes revamped with &quot;fresh value&quot; from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours &quot;external&quot; to Tagore&#x27;s own ancestral culture. In fact, Tagore drew influence from sources as diverse as traditional Hindusthani Thumri (&quot;O Miya Bejanewale&quot;) to Scottish ballads (&quot;Purano Shei Diner Kotha&quot; from &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;).

Scholars have attempted to gauge the emotive force and range of Hindustani &quot;ragas&quot;:

Tagore influenced sitar maestro Vilayat Khan and &quot;sarodiyas&quot; Buddhadev Dasgupta and Amjad Ali Khan. His songs are widely popular and undergird the Bengali ethos to an extent perhaps rivalling Shakespeare&#x27;s impact on the English-speaking world. It is said that his songs are the outcome of five centuries of Bengali literary churning and communal yearning. Dhan Gopal Mukerji has said that these songs transcend the mundane to the aesthetic and express all ranges and categories of human emotion. The poet gave voice to all—big or small, rich or poor. The poor Ganges boatman and the rich landlord air their emotions in them. They birthed a distinctive school of music whose practitioners can be fiercely traditional: novel interpretations have drawn severe censure in both West Bengal and Bangladesh.

For Bengalis, the songs&#x27; appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore&#x27;s poetry, was such that the &quot;Modern Review&quot; observed that &quot;[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath&#x27;s songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung ... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs&quot;. A. H. Fox Strangways of &quot;The Observer&quot; introduced non-Bengalis to &quot;rabindrasangit&quot; in &quot;The Music of Hindostan&quot;, calling it a &quot;vehicle of a personality ... [that] go behind this or that system of music to that beauty of sound which all systems put out their hands to seize.&quot;

In 1971, &quot;Amar Shonar Bangla&quot; became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written—ironically—to protest the 1905 Partition of Bengal along communal lines: lopping Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a ploy to upend the independence movement, and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. &quot;Jana Gana Mana&quot; was written in &quot;shadhu-bhasha&quot;, a Sanskritised register of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of a Brahmo hymn that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the Indian National Congress, and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.

== Songs ==
It is believed on 27 December 1931, Dhurjatiprasad Mukhopadhyay wrote an essay titled &quot;রবীন্দ্রনাথের সংগীত&quot; (Rabindranath&#x27;s Music) for Tagore&#x27;s 70th birth anniversary, in which the term &quot;Rabindrasangeet&quot; was used for the first time. In January 1935, Kanak Das&#x27;s recording P11792, featuring &quot;মনে রবে কিনা রবে আমারে&quot; (&quot;Whether or not I remain in your recollection&quot;) and &quot;কাছে যবে ছিল পাশে হল না যাওয়া&quot; (&quot;When you were near, I couldn&#x27;t reach you&quot;) first used &quot;Rabindrasangeet&quot; on the label. Tagore&#x27;s compositions cover topics including humanism, structuralism, introspection, psychology, romance, yearning, nostalgia, reflection, and modernism, offering melody for every season and every aspect of Bengali life. Tagore primarily worked with two subjects – first, the human being, the being and the becoming of that human being, and second, Nature, in all her myriad forms and colours, and of the relationship between the human being and Nature and how Nature affects the behavior and the expressions of human beings. &quot;Bhanusimha Thakurer Padavali&quot; (or &quot;Bhanusingher Podaboli&quot;), one of Tagore&#x27;s earliest works in music, was primarily in a language that is similar and yet different from Bengali – this language, Brajabuli, was derived from the language of the Vaishnav hymns, and of texts like Jayadeva&#x27;s &quot;Gita Govinda&quot;, some influences from Sanskrit can be found, courtesy Tagore&#x27;s extensive homeschooling in the Puranas, the Upanishads, as well as in poetic texts like Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Meghadūta&quot; and &quot;Abhigyanam Shakuntalam&quot;. Tagore was one of the greatest narrators of all time, and throughout his life, we find a current of narration through all his works that surges with upheavals in the psyche of the people around him, as well as with the changes of seasons. A master of metaphor, it is often difficult to identify the true meaning that underlies his texts, but what is truly great about Tagore, is that his songs are identifiable with any and every possible mood, with every possible situation that is encountered by a person in the course of life. This truly reinforces the notion that Rabindrasangeet has at its heart some unbelievably powerful poetry. The Upanishads influenced his writing throughout his life, and his devotional music is addressed almost always to an inanimate entity, a personal, a private god, whom modernists call the Other.

Rabindranath Tagore was a curator of melodic and compositional styles. In the course of his travels all over the world, he came into contact with the musical narratives of the West, of the South of India, and these styles are reflected in some of his songs. There are several classifications of his work. The ones that beginners most often use are those based on genre – devotional (Puja Porjaay), romantic (Prem Porjaay) [Note: It often becomes difficult, if not impossible, on hearing a song, to determine if it falls in the devotional genre or the romantic. The line between the two is blurred, by certain creations of Tagore himself, e.g. Tomarei Koriyachi Jibonero Dhrubotara. Also, Tagore never made these divisions. Only after his death was the need felt to categorize, compile and thus preserve his work, and the genre-classification system was born out of this need.] seasonal (Prokriti Porjaay) – summer (Grishho), monsoon (Borsha), autumn (Shorot), early winter (Hemonto), winter (Sheet), Spring (Boshonto); diverse (Bichitro), patriotic (Deshatmobodhok). Although Deshatmobodh and patriotism are completely antipodal concepts, yet the difficulties of translation present themselves, apart from songs specified for certain events or occasions (Aanushtthanik) and the songs he composed for his numerous plays and dance-dramas.

The book forming a collection of all 2,233 songs written by Rabindranath is called &quot;Gitabitan&quot; (&quot;Garden of songs&quot;) and forms an important part of extant historical materials pertaining to Bengali musical expression. The six major parts of this book are &quot;Puja&quot; (worship), &quot;Prem&quot; (love), &quot;Prakriti&quot; (seasons), &quot;Swadesh&quot; (patriotism), &quot;Aanushthanik&quot; (occasion-specific), &quot;Bichitro&quot; (miscellaneous) and &quot;Nrityonatya&quot; (dance dramas and lyrical plays).

The &quot;Swarabitan&quot;, published in 64 volumes, includes the texts of 1,721 songs and their musical notation. The volumes were first published between 1936 and 1955.

Earlier collections, all arranged chronologically, include &quot;Rabi Chhaya&quot; (1885), &quot;Ganer Bahi or Valmiki Pratibha&quot; (1893), &quot;Gan&quot; (1908), and &quot;Dharmashongit&quot; (1909).

== Exponents ==
Since the establishment of the Sangeet Bhavan of Tagore&#x27;s own Visva-Bharati University at Shantiniketan, along with its codification of Rabindra Sangeet instruction, multiple generations have created Rabindra Sangeet (its aesthetics and singing style) into a tangible cultural tradition breeding many singers who now specialize in singing Tagore&#x27;s works. Some notable early exponents of Rabindra Sangeet who laid down its foundations and continue to inspire generations of singers include:
Kanika Banerjee. Suchitra Mitra, Hemant Kumar, Debabrata Biswas, Sagar Sen, Subinoy Roy, Chinmoy Chattopadhyay and Sumitra Sen.

== Historical influence ==
Rabindra Sangeet has been an integral part of Bengal culture for over a century. Hindu monk and Indian social reformer Swami Vivekananda became an admirer of Rabindra Sangeet in his youth. He composed music in the Rabindra Sangeet style, for example &quot;Gaganer Thale&quot; in Raga Jaijaivanti.

=== Digitization ===
As of July 2016, 7,864 Rabindra Sangeet have been digitized by Saregama and are available online for download.

Furthermore, popular Rabindrasangeet has been digitized and featured on featured Phalguni Mookhopadhayay&#x27;s YouTube channel as part of Brainware University&#x27;s initiative. Launched on 9 May 2023, this project aims to promote Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s cultural heritage. The initiative includes 100 selected songs, translated and sung by Mookhopadhayay, which are being gradually released along with detailed anecdotes, appreciations, blogs, critical essays, and research papers, making Tagore&#x27;s works accessible to Bengali and non-Bengali households worldwide.

<doc id="1158955" wikidata="Q1140333" url="?curid=1158955" title="Fingerstyle guitar">
<text>Fingerstyle guitar is the technique of playing the guitar or bass guitar by plucking the strings directly with the fingertips, fingernails, or picks attached to fingers, as opposed to flatpicking (plucking individual notes with a single plectrum, commonly called a &quot;pick&quot;). The term &quot;fingerstyle&quot; is something of a misnomer, since it is present in several different genres and styles of music—but mostly, because it involves a completely different technique, not just a &quot;style&quot; of playing, especially for the guitarist&#x27;s picking/plucking hand. The term is often used synonymously with fingerpicking except in classical guitar circles, although fingerpicking can also refer to a specific tradition of folk, blues and country guitar playing in the US. The terms &quot;fingerstyle&quot; and &quot;fingerpicking&quot; are also applied to similar string instruments such as the banjo.

Music arranged for fingerstyle playing can include chords, arpeggios (the notes of a chord played one after the other, as opposed to simultaneously) and other elements such as artificial harmonics, hammering on and pulling off notes with the fretting hand, using the body of the guitar percussively (by tapping rhythms on the body), and many other techniques. Often, the guitarist will play the melody notes, interspersed with the melody&#x27;s accompanying chords and the deep bassline (or bass notes) simultaneously. Some fingerpicking guitarists also intersperse percussive tapping along with the melody, chords and bassline. Fingerstyle is a standard technique on the classical or nylon string guitar, but is considered more of a specialized technique on steel string guitars. Fingerpicking is less common on electric guitar. The timbre of fingerpicked notes is described as &quot;result[ing] in a more piano-like attack,&quot; and less like pizzicato.

==Technique==
Because individual digits play notes on the guitar rather than the hand working as a single unit (which is the case when a guitarist is holding a single pick), a guitarist playing fingerstyle can perform several musical elements simultaneously. One definition of the technique has been put forward by the Toronto (Canada) Fingerstyle Guitar Association:
Physically, &quot;Fingerstyle&quot; refers to using each of the right hand fingers independently to play the multiple parts of a musical arrangement that would normally be played by several band members. Deep bass notes, harmonic accompaniment (the chord progression), melody, and percussion can all be played simultaneously when playing Fingerstyle.

Many fingerstyle guitarists have adopted a combination of acrylic nails and a thumbpick to improve tone and decrease nail wear and chance of breaking or chipping. Notable guitarists to adopt this hardware are Ani DiFranco, Doyle Dykes, Don Ross, and Richard Smith.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
* Players do not have to carry a plectrum (thus eliminating the risk of dropping one), but fingernails may need to be maintained at the right length and angles, and kept in good condition if the player has a preference to use the nails of their fingers over the pads of their fingertips.
* It is possible to play multiple non-adjacent strings at exactly the same time. This enables the guitarist to play a very low bass note and a high treble note simultaneously. This enables the guitarist to play double stops, such as an octave, a fifth, a sixth, or other intervals that suit the harmony.
* It is more suitable for playing polyphonically, with separate, independent musical lines, or separate melody, harmony and bass parts than using a plectrum, and therefore more suitable to unaccompanied solo playing, or to very small ensembles, like duos in which a guitarist accompanies a singer. Fingerstyle players have up to four (or five) surfaces (fingernails or picks) striking the strings and/or other parts of the guitar independently.
* It is easy to play arpeggios; but the techniques for tremolo (rapid repetition of a note) and melody playing are more complex than with plectrum playing.
* It is possible to play chords without any arpeggiation, because up to five strings can be plucked simultaneously.
* There is less need for fretting hand damping (muting) in playing chords, since only the strings that are required can be plucked.
* A greater variation in strokes is possible, allowing greater expressiveness in timbre and dynamics.
* A wide variety of strums and rasgueados are possible.
* Less energy is generally imparted to strings than with plectrum playing, leading to lower volume when playing acoustically.
* Playing on heavier gauge strings can damage nails: fingerstyle is more suited to nylon strings or lighter gauge steel strings (but this does not apply to fingerpicks, or when the flesh of the fingers is used rather than the nail, as is common with the lute.)

==Nylon string guitar styles==
Nylon string guitars are most frequently played fingerstyle.

===Classical guitar fingerstyle===
The term &quot;Classical guitar&quot; can refer to any kind of art music played fingerstyle on a nylon string guitar, or more narrowly to music of the classical period, as opposed to baroque or romantic music. The major feature of classical-fingerstyle technique is that it enables solo rendition of harmony and polyphonic music in much the same manner as the piano can. The technique is intended to maximize the degree of control over the musical dynamics, texture, articulation and timbral characteristics of the guitar. The sitting position of the player, while somewhat variable, generally places the guitar on the left leg, which is elevated, rather than the right. This sitting position is intended to maintain shoulder alignment and physical balance between the left and right hands. Thumb, index, middle and ring fingers are all commonly employed for plucking, with occasional use of the pinky. Chords are often plucked, with strums being reserved for emphasis. The repertoire varies in terms of keys, modes, rhythms and cultural influences. Classical-guitar music is performed/composed most often in standard tuning (EADGBE). However, altered tunings such as dropped D are common.

====Notation====
Fingerings for both hands are often given in detail in classical guitar music notation, although players are also free to add to or depart from them as part of their own interpretation.
Fretting hand fingers are given as numbers, plucking hand fingers are given as letters
In guitar &quot;scores&quot;, the five fingers of the right-hand (which pluck the strings, for right-handers) are designated by the first letter of their Spanish names namely &quot;p&quot; = thumb (&quot;pulgar&quot;), &quot;i&quot; = index finger (&quot;índice&quot;), &quot;m&quot; = middle finger (&quot;medio&quot;), &quot;a&quot; = ring finger (), and when used, often &quot;c&quot; = little finger or pinky (&quot;chiquito&quot;). There are several words in Spanish for the little finger: most commonly &quot;dedo meñique&quot;, but also &quot;dedo pequeño&quot; or &quot;dedo auricular&quot;; however, their initials conflict with the initials of the other fingers; &quot;c&quot; is said to be the first half of the initial letter &quot;ch&quot; of &quot;dedo chiquito&quot;, which is not the most common name (&quot;meñique&quot;) for the little finger; the origin of &quot;e&quot;, &quot;x&quot; and &quot;q&quot; is not certain but is said to perhaps be from &quot;extremo&quot;, Spanish for last or final, for the &quot;e&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, and &quot;meñique&quot; or &quot;pequeño&quot; for &quot;q&quot;.

The four fingers of the left hand (which stop the strings, for left-handers) are designated 1 = index, 2 = major, 3 = ring finger, 4 = little finger; 0 designates an open string, that is a string that is not stopped by a finger of the left hand and whose full length thus vibrates when plucked. On the classical guitar the thumb of the left hand is never used to stop strings from above (as is done on the electric guitar): the neck of a classical guitar is too wide and the normal position of the thumb used in classical guitar technique do not make that possible. Scores (contrary to &quot;tablatures&quot;) do not systematically indicate the string to be plucked (although often the choice is obvious). When an indication of the string is required the strings are designated 1 to 6 (from the 1st the high E to the 6th the low E) with figures 1 to 6 inside circles.

The positions (that is where on the fretboard the first finger of the left hand is placed) are also not systematically indicated, but when they are (mostly in the case of the execution of &quot;barrés&quot;) these are indicated with Roman numerals from the position I (index finger of the left hand placed on the 1st fret: F–B–E–A–C–F) to the position XII (the index finger of the left hand placed on the 12th fret: E–A–D–G–B–E; the 12th fret is placed where the body begins) or higher up to position XIX (the classical guitar most often having 19 frets, with the 19th fret being most often split and not being usable to fret the 3rd and 4th strings).

====Alternation====
To achieve tremolo effects and rapid, fluent scale passages, and varied arpeggios the player must practice alternation, that is, never plucking a string with the same finger twice.
Common alternation patterns include:
* &quot;i–m–i–m&quot;: Basic melody line on the treble strings. Has the appearance of &quot;walking along the strings&quot;.
* &quot;a–m–i–a–m–i&quot;: Tremolo pattern with a triplet feel (i.e. the same note is repeated three times)
* &quot;p–a–m–i–p–a–m–i&quot;: Another tremolo pattern.
* &quot;p–i–p–i&quot; or &quot;p–m–p–m&quot;: A way of playing a melody line on the lower strings.

====Tone production====
Classical guitarists have a large degree of freedom within the mechanics of playing the instrument. Often these decisions influence tone and timbre. Factors include:

*At what position along the string the finger plucks the string (This is changed by guitarists throughout a song, since it is an effective way of changing the sound (timbre) from &quot;soft&quot; (&quot;dolce&quot;) plucking the string near its middle, to &quot;hard&quot; (&quot;ponticelo&quot;) plucking the string near its end).
*Use of the nail or not: Modern classical guitar playing uses a technique in which &quot;both&quot; the nail and the fingertip contact the string during normal playing. (Andrés Segovia is often credited with popularizing this technique.) Playing with either fingertips alone (&quot;dita punta&quot;) or fingernails alone (&quot;dita unghis&quot;) are considered special techniques for timbral variation.
Concert guitarists must keep their fingernails smoothly filed and carefully shaped to employ this technique, which produces a better-controlled sound than either nails or fingertips alone. Playing parameters include:
*Which finger to use
*What angle of attack to hold the wrist and fingers at with respect to the strings.
*Rest-stroke apoyando; the finger that plucks a string rests on the next string—traditionally used in single melody lines—versus free-stroke tirando (plucking the string without coming to a rest on the next string).

===Flamenco guitar fingerstyle===
Flamenco technique is related to classical technique, but with more emphasis on rhythmic drive and volume, and less on dynamic contrast and tone production. Flamenco guitarists prefer keys such as A and E that allow the use of open strings, and typically employ capos where a departure is required.

Some specialized techniques include:

* Picado: Single-line scale passages performed apoyando but with more attack and articulation.
* Rasgueado: Strumming frequently done by bunching all the right hand fingers and then flicking them out in quick succession to get four superimposed strums (although there are a great many variations on this). The rasgueado or &quot;rolling&quot; strum is particularly characteristic of the genre.
* Alzapua: A thumb technique with roots in oud plectrum technique. The right hand thumb is used for both single-line notes and strummed across a number of strings. Both are combined in quick succession to give it a unique sound.
* Tremolo: Done somewhat differently from the conventional classical guitar tremolo, it is very commonly played with the right hand pattern &quot;p–i–a–m–i&quot;.

===Bossa nova===
Bossa nova is most commonly performed on the nylon-string classical guitar, played with the fingers rather than with a pick. Its purest form could be considered unaccompanied guitar with vocals, as exemplified by João Gilberto. Even in larger, jazz-like arrangements for groups, there is almost always a guitar that plays the underlying rhythm. Gilberto basically took one of the several rhythmic layers from a samba ensemble, specifically the tamborim, and applied it to the picking hand.

==North American tradition==
===Country blues===

Fingerpicking (also called thumb picking, alternating bass, or pattern picking) is both a playing style and a genre of music. It falls under the &quot;fingerstyle&quot; heading because it is plucked by the fingers, but it is generally used to play a specific type of folk, country-jazz and/or blues music. In this technique, the thumb maintains a steady rhythm, usually playing &quot;ostinato bass&quot; or &quot;alternating bass&quot; patterns on the lower three strings, while the index, or index and middle fingers pick out melody and fill-in notes on the high strings. The style originated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as southern blues guitarists tried to imitate the popular ragtime piano music of the day, with the guitarist&#x27;s thumb functioning as the pianist&#x27;s left hand, and the other fingers functioning as the right hand. The first recorded examples were by players such as Blind Blake, Big Bill Broonzy, Skip James, Blind Willie McTell, Memphis Minnie and Mississippi John Hurt. Some early blues players such as Blind Willie Johnson and Tampa Red added slide guitar techniques.

===American primitive guitar===
American primitive guitar is a subset of fingerstyle guitar. It originated with John Fahey, whose recordings from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s inspired many guitarists such as Leo Kottke, who made his debut recording of &quot;6- and 12-String Guitar&quot; on Fahey&#x27;s Takoma label in 1969. American primitive guitar can be characterized by the use of folk music or folk-like material, driving alternating-bass fingerpicking with a good deal of &quot;ostinato&quot; patterns, and the use of alternative tunings (&quot;scordatura&quot;) such as open D, open G, drop D and open C. The application or &quot;cross-contamination&quot; of traditional forms of music within the style of American primitive guitar is also very common. Examples of traditions that John Fahey and Robbie Basho would employ in their compositions include, but are not limited to, the extended Raga of Indian classical music, the Japanese Koto, and the early ragtime-based country blues music of Mississippi John Hurt or Blind Blake.

===Country music===
Fingerpicking was soon taken up by country and western artists such as Sam McGee, Ike Everly (father of The Everly Brothers), Merle Travis and &quot;Thumbs&quot; Carllile. Later Chet Atkins further developed the style and in modern music musicians such as Jose Gonzalez, Eddie Vedder (on his song Guaranteed) and David Knowles have utilized the style. Most fingerpickers use acoustic guitars, but some, including Merle Travis played on hollow-body electric guitars, while some modern rock musicians, such as Derek Trucks and Mark Knopfler, employ traditional North American fingerpicking techniques on solid-body electric guitars such as the Gibson Les Paul or the Fender Stratocaster.

===Ragtime guitar===

An early master of ragtime guitar was Blind Blake, a popular recording artist of the late 1920s and early 1930s. In the 1960s, a new generation of guitarists returned to these roots and began to transcribe piano tunes for solo guitar. One of the best known and most talented of these players was Dave Van Ronk, who arranged &quot;St. Louis Tickle&quot; for solo guitar. In 1971, guitarists David Laibman and Eric Schoenberg arranged and recorded Scott Joplin rags and other complex piano arrangements for the LP &quot;The New Ragtime Guitar&quot; on Folkways Records. This was followed by a Stefan Grossman method book with the same title. A year later Grossman and ED Denson founded Kicking Mule Records, a company that recorded scores of LPs of solo ragtime guitar by artists including Grossman, Ton van Bergeyk, Leo Wijnkamp, Duck Baker, Peter Finger, Lasse Johansson, Tom Ball and Dale Miller. Meanwhile, Reverend Gary Davis was active in New York City, where he mentored many aspiring finger-pickers. He has subsequently influenced numerous other artists in the United States and internationally.

===Carter Family picking===
Carter Family picking, also known as &quot;&#x27;thumb brush&#x27; technique or the &#x27;Carter lick,&#x27; and also the &#x27;church lick&#x27; and the &#x27;Carter scratch&#x27;&quot;, is a style of fingerstyle guitar named for Maybelle Carter of the Carter Family&#x27;s distinctive style of rhythm guitar in which the melody is played on the bass strings, usually low E, A, and D while rhythm strumming continues above, on the treble strings, G, B, and high E. This often occurs during the break.

===Travis picking===
This style is commonly played on steel string acoustic guitars. Pattern picking is the use of &quot;preset right-hand pattern[s]&quot; while fingerpicking, with the left hand fingering standard chords. The most common pattern, sometimes broadly referred to as Travis picking after Merle Travis, and popularized by Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, James Burton, Marcel Dadi, James Taylor, John Prine, Colter Wall and Tommy Emmanuel, is as follows:

 Middle | X X - | X X - |
 Index | X X - | X X - |
 Thumb | X X X X - | X X X X - |

The thumb (T) alternates between bass notes, often on two different strings, while the index (I) and middle (M) fingers alternate between two treble notes, usually on two different strings, most often the second and first. Using this pattern on a C major chord is as follows in notation and tablature:

However, Travis&#x27;s own playing was often much more complicated than this example. He often referred to his style of playing as &quot;thumb picking&quot;, possibly because the only pick he used when playing was a banjo thumb pick, or &quot;Muhlenberg picking&quot;, after his native Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, where he learned this approach to playing from Mose Rager and Ike Everly. Travis&#x27;s style did not involve a defined, alternating bass string pattern; it was more of an alternating &quot;bass strum&quot; pattern, resulting in an accompanying rhythm reminiscent of ragtime piano.

===Clawhammer and frailing===
&quot;Clawhammer&quot; and &quot;frailing&quot; are primarily banjo techniques that are sometimes applied to the guitar. Jody Stecher and Alec Stone Sweet are exponents of guitar clawhammer. Fingerstyle guitarist Steve Baughman distinguishes between frailing and clawhammer as follows. In frailing, the index fingertip is used for up-picking melody, and the middle fingernail is used for rhythmic downward brushing. In clawhammer, only downstrokes are used, and they are typically played with one fingernail as is the usual technique on the banjo.

==Other acoustic styles==

===UK Folk baroque===
A distinctive style to emerge from Britain in the early 1960s, which combined elements of American folk, blues, jazz and ragtime with British traditional music, was what became known as &#x27;folk baroque&#x27;. Pioneered by musicians of the Second British folk revival began their careers in the short-lived skiffle craze of the later 1950s and often used American blues, folk and jazz styles, occasionally using open D and G tunings. However, performers like Davy Graham and Martin Carthy attempted to apply these styles to the playing of traditional English modal music. They were soon followed by artists such as Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who further defined the style. The style these artists developed was particularly notable for the adoption of D–A–D–G–A–D (from lowest to highest), which gave a form of suspended-fourth D chord, neither major nor minor, which could be employed as the basis for modal based folk songs. This was combined with a fingerstyle based on Travis picking and a focus on melody, that made it suitable as an accompaniment. Denselow, who coined the phrase &#x27;folk baroque,&#x27; singled out Graham&#x27;s recording of traditional English folk song &#x27;Seven Gypsys&#x27; on &quot;Folk, Blues and Beyond&quot; (1964) as the beginning of the style. Graham mixed this with Indian, African, American, Celtic, and modern and traditional American influences, while Carthy in particular used the tuning to replicate the drone common in medieval and folk music played by the thumb on the two lowest strings. The style was further developed by Jansch, who brought a more forceful style of picking and, indirectly, influences from Jazz and Ragtime, leading particularly to more complex basslines. Renbourn built on all these trends and was the artist whose repertoire was most influenced by medieval music.

In the early 1970s the next generation of British artists added new tunings and techniques, reflected in the work of artists like Nick Drake, Tim Buckley and particularly John Martyn, whose &quot;Solid Air&quot; (1972) set the bar for subsequent British acoustic guitarists. Perhaps the most prominent exponent of recent years has been Martin Simpson, whose complex mix of traditional English and American material, together with innovative arrangements and techniques like the use of guitar slides, represents a deliberate attempt to create a unique and personal style. Martin Carthy passed on his guitar style to French guitarist Pierre Bensusan. It was taken up in Scotland by Dick Gaughan, and by Irish musicians like Paul Brady, Dónal Lunny and Mick Moloney. Carthy also influenced Paul Simon, particularly evident on &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot;, which he probably taught to Simon, and a recording of Davy&#x27;s &quot;Anji&quot; that appears on &quot;Sounds of Silence&quot;, and as a result was copied by many subsequent folk guitarists. By the 1970s Americans such as Duck Baker and Eric Schoenberg were arranging solo guitar versions of Celtic dance tunes, slow airs, bagpipe music, and harp pieces by Turlough O&#x27;Carolan and earlier harper-composers. Renbourn and Jansch&#x27;s complex sounds were also highly influential on Mike Oldfield&#x27;s early music. The style also had an impact within British folk rock, where particularly Richard Thompson, used the D–A–D–G–A–D tuning, though with a hybrid picking style to produce a similar but distinctive effect.

===&quot;New Age&quot; approach===
In 1976, William Ackerman started Windham Hill Records, which carried on the Takoma tradition of original compositions on solo steel string guitar. However, instead of the folk and blues oriented music of Takoma, including Fahey&#x27;s American primitive guitar, the early Windham Hill artists (and others influenced by them) abandoned the steady alternating or monotonic bass in favor of sweet flowing arpeggios and flamenco-inspired percussive techniques. The label&#x27;s best selling artist George Winston and others used a similar approach on piano. This music was generally pacific, accessible and expressionistic. Eventually, this music acquired the label of &quot;New Age&quot;, given its widespread use as background music at bookstores, spas and other New Age businesses. The designation has stuck, though it was not a term coined by the company itself.

===Percussive approach===
&quot;Percussive fingerstyle&quot; is a term for a style incorporating sharp attacks on the strings, as well as hitting the strings and guitar top with the hand for percussive effect. Principally featuring, string slapping, guitar body percussion, alternate tunings and extended techniques such as; tapping and harmonics. Flamenco and Blues guitarists regularly feature percussive techniques and alternate tunings, and arguably laid the foundations for playing in this way Michael Hedges and Eric Roche developed and essentially pioneered percussive techniques forming a style of their own in the 1980s - 90s. Their progressive contribution played a significant role in influencing a new wave of percussive players including Andy Mckee, Preston Reed, Jon Gomm, Mike Dawes, Chris Woods, Don Ross, Declan Zapala, Erik Mongrain, and Marcin Patrzałek.

===Funky approaches===

&quot;Funky fingerstyle&quot; emerged in the mid-2000s, as a style in which the sounds of a full funk or R&amp;B ensemble are emulated on one guitar. Uncommon sounds are being discovered thanks to the technical possibilities of various pick-ups, microphones and octave division effects pedals. Adam Rafferty uses a technique of hip-hop vocal percussion called &quot;human beat box&quot;, along with body percussion, while playing contrapuntal fingerstyle pieces. Petteri Sariola has several mics on board his guitar and is able to run up to 6 lines from his guitar to a mixing desk, providing a full &quot;band sound&quot; – bass drum, snare, bass, guitar – as an accompaniment to his vocals.

===African fingerstyle===

The six string guitar was brought to Africa by traders and missionaries (although there are indigenous guitar-like instruments such as the ngoni and the gimbri or sintir of Gnawa music). Its uptake varies considerably between regions, and there
is therefore no single African acoustic guitar style. In some cases, the styles and techniques of other instruments have been applied to the guitar; for instance, a technique where the strings are plucked with the thumb and one finger imitates the two-thumbed plucking of the kora and mbira. The pioneer of Congolese fingerstyle acoustic guitar music was Jean Bosco Mwenda, also known as Mwenda wa Bayeke (1930–1990). His song &quot;Masanga&quot; was particularly influential, because of its complex and varied guitar part. His influences included traditional music of Zambia and the Eastern Congo, Cuban groups like the Trio Matamoros, and cowboy movies. His style used the thumb and index finger only, to produce bass, melody and accompaniment. Congolese guitarists Losta Abelo and Edouard Masengo played in a similar style.

Herbert Misango and George Mukabi were fingerstyle guitarists from Kenya. Ali Farka Toure (d. 2006) was a guitarist from Mali, whose music has been called the &quot;DNA of the blues&quot;. He was also often compared to John Lee Hooker. His son Vieux Farka Toure continues to play in the same style. Djelimady Tounkara is another Malian fingerstylist. S. E. Rogie and Koo Nimo play acoustic fingerstyle in the lilting, calypso-influenced palm wine music tradition. Benin-born Jazz guitarist Lionel Loueke uses fingerstyle in an approach that combines jazz harmonies and complex rhythms. He is now based in the US.

Tony Cox (b. 1954) is a Zimbabwean guitarist and composer based in Cape Town, South Africa. A master of the Fingerpicking style of guitar playing, he has won the SAMA (South African Music Awards) for best instrumental album twice. His music incorporates many different styles including classical, blues, rock and jazz, while keeping an African flavour. Tinderwet is a versatile guitarist of the three and sometimes four fingers playing style (thumb, index, middle and ring); he plays several different African styles, including soukous or West African music. He often flavours his playing with jazzy improvisations, regular fingerpicking patterns and chord melody sequences.

==Slide, steel and slack-key guitar==
Even when the guitar is tuned in a manner that helps the guitarist to perform a certain type of chord, it is often undesirable for all six strings to sound. When strumming with a plectrum, a guitarist must &quot;damp&quot; (mute) unwanted strings with the fretting hand; when a slide or steel is employed, this fretting hand damping is no longer possible, so it becomes necessary to replace plectrum strumming with plucking of individual strings. For this reason, slide guitar and steel guitar playing are very often fingerstyle.

===Slide guitar===
Slide guitar or bottleneck guitar is a particular method or technique for playing the guitar. The term &quot;slide&quot; refers to the motion of the slide against the strings, while &quot;bottleneck&quot; refers to the original material of choice for such slides: the necks of glass bottles. Instead of altering the pitch of the strings in the normal manner (by pressing the string against frets), a slide is placed on the string to vary its vibrating length, and pitch. This slide can then be moved along the string without lifting, creating continuous transitions in pitch.

Slide guitar is most often played (assuming a right-handed player and guitar):
* with the guitar in the normal position, using a slide called a bottleneck on one of the fingers of the left hand; this is known as bottleneck guitar;
* with the guitar held horizontally, with the belly uppermost and the bass strings toward the player, and using a slide called a steel held in the left hand; this is known as lap steel guitar.

===Slack-key guitar===

Slack-key guitar is a fingerpicked style that originated in Hawaii. The English term is a translation of the Hawaiian &quot;kī hō‘alu&quot;, which means &quot;loosen the [tuning] key&quot;. Slack key is nearly always played in open or altered tunings—the most common tuning is G-major (D–G–D–G–B–D), called &quot;taropatch&quot;, though there is a family of major-seventh tunings called &quot;wahine&quot; (Hawaiian for &quot;woman&quot;), as well as tunings designed to get particular effects. Basic slack-key style, like mainland folk-based fingerstyle, establishes an alternating bass pattern with the thumb and plays the melody line with the fingers on the higher strings. The repertory is rooted in traditional, post-Contact Hawaiian song and dance, but since 1946 (when the first commercial slack key recordings were made) the style has expanded, and some contemporary compositions have a distinctly new-age sound. Slack key&#x27;s older generation included Gabby Pahinui, Leonard Kwan, Sonny Chillingworth and Raymond Kāne. Prominent contemporary players include Keola Beamer, Moses Kahumoku, Ledward Kaapana, Dennis Kamakahi, John Keawe, Ozzie Kotani and Peter Moon and Cyril Pahinui.

==Electric guitar==

===Fingerstyle jazz guitar===
The unaccompanied guitar in jazz is often played in chord-melody style, where the guitarist plays a series of chords with the melody line on top. Fingerstyle, plectrum, or hybrid picking are equally suited to this style. Some players alternate between fingerstyle and plectrum playing, &quot;palming&quot; the plectrum when it is not in use. Early blues and ragtime guitarists often used fingerstyle. True fingerstyle jazz guitar dates back to early swing era acoustic players like Eddie Lang (1902–1933) Lonnie Johnson (1899–1970) and Carl Kress (1907–1965), Dick McDonough (1904–1938) and the Argentinian Oscar Alemán (1909–1980). Django Reinhardt (1910–1953) used a classical/flamenco technique on unaccompanied pieces such as his composition &quot;Tears&quot;.

Fingerstyle jazz on the electric guitar was pioneered by George van Eps (1913–1998) who was respected for his polyphonic approach, sometimes using a seven string guitar. Wes Montgomery (1925–1968) was known for using the fleshy part of his thumb to provide the bass line while strumming chordal or melodic motives with his fingers. This style, while unorthodox, was widely regarded as an innovative method for enhancing the warm tone associated with jazz guitar. Montgomery&#x27;s influence extends to modern polyphonic jazz improvisational methods. Joe Pass (1929–1994) switched to fingerstyle mid career, making the &quot;Virtuoso&quot; series of albums. Little known to the general public Ted Greene (1946–2005) was admired by fellow musicians for his harmonic skills. Lenny Breau (1941–1984) went one better than van Eps by playing virtuosic fingerstyle on an eight string guitar. Tommy Crook replaced the lower two strings on his Gibson switchmaster with bass strings, allowing him to create the impression of playing bass and guitar simultaneously. Chet Atkins (1924–2001) sometimes applied his formidable right-hand technique to jazz standards, with Duck Baker (b. 1949), Richard Smith (b. 1971), Woody Mann and Tommy Emmanuel (b. 1955), among others, following in his footsteps. They use the fingerpicking technique of Merle Travis and others to play wide variety of material including jazz. This style is distinguished by having a steadier and &quot;busier&quot; (several beats to the bar) bass line than the chord melody approach of Montgomery and Pass making it suited to up-tempo material.

Fingerstyle has always been predominant in Latin American guitar playing, which Laurindo Almeida (1917–1995) and Charlie Byrd (1925–1999) brought to a wider audience in the 1950s. Fingerstyle jazz guitar has several proponents: the pianistic Jeff Linsky (b. 1952), freely improvises polyphonically while employing a classical guitar technique. Earl Klugh (b. 1953) and Tuck Andress have also performed fingerstyle jazz on the solo guitar. Briton Martin Taylor (b. 1956), a former Stephane Grappelli sideman, switched to fingerstyle on relaunching his career as a soloist. His predecessor in Grappelli&#x27;s band, John Etheridge (b. 1948) is also an occasional fingerstyle player.

===Electric blues and rock===
The solid-body electric guitar is rarely played fingerstyle, although it presents no major technical challenges. Slide guitarists often employ fingerstyle, which applies equally to the electric guitar, for instance Duane Allman and Ry Cooder. Blues guitarists have long used fingerstyle: some exponents include Jorma Kaukonen, Hubert Sumlin, Albert King, Albert Collins, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Derek Trucks, John Mayer, Joe Bonamassa, Sandor Enyedi and Buckethead. Exponents of fingerstyle rock guitar include: Mark Knopfler, Jeff Beck (formerly a pick player), Stephen Malkmus, Bruce Cockburn (exclusively), Robby Krieger, Lindsey Buckingham, Mike Oldfield, Patrick Simmons, Elliott Smith, Wilko Johnson, J.J. Cale, Robbie Robertson, Hillel Slovak, St. Vincent, Yvette Young, Kurt Vile, David Longstreth, Richie Kotzen (formerly a pick player), Greg Koch, Guy King, Courtney Barnett, Jared James Nichols.

<doc id="1158956" wikidata="Q5565787" url="?curid=1158956" title="Give Yourself Goosebumps">
<text>Give Yourself Goosebumps is a children&#x27;s horror fiction gamebook series by R. L. Stine. After the success of the original &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books, Scholastic Press decided to create this spin-off series in 1995. In fact, Stine had written gamebooks in previous years.

50 books in the series, including the &quot;special editions&quot; were published between 1995 and 2000. All of the books in the series, with the exception of &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Feed the Vampire&quot;, are now out-of-print.

==General plotline==
For the most part, play is rather simple, as the books are merely novels with branching plots. The books are written in the second person and enlivened by puzzles or choices. Rather than reading simply from beginning to end, the reader is told to turn to a certain page at the bottom of the current page. At certain pages the reader will be given at least two choices of which page to turn to, depending on what they want the main character (one&#x27;s self) to do. If the reader makes poor choices, the book may come to a &quot;bad&quot; ending that will feature a horrid fate for the main character, but the reader is always able to go back and choose a new choice. 

There is also at least one page in each book that uses an alternative method to selecting each choice, and is done more by chance rather than the reader&#x27;s decision. These include; &quot;Tossing a Coin&quot; (where &quot;Heads&quot; represents one page and &quot;Tails&quot; another) &quot;Rolling a Die&quot; (&quot;Odd&quot; and &quot;Even&quot; sides having their own pages), or the reader trying a challenge in real life (and turning to a different page depending on whether they were successful or not). This whole structure came from the then-popular &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; book series. 

There are normally two &quot;main stories&quot; and one &quot;side story&quot; which have their own set of choices, and a certain decision - usually at the first two choices - that will determine which of the two &quot;stories&quot; the reader will be a part of. The side story will usually feature inside one of the two main stories, would consist of a small group of choices, and is usually more lighthearted than the rest of the book. Also, there is sometimes a group of choices, which contain one choice which is blatantly wrong (such as eating the blue eggs in &quot;Escape from Camp Run-For-Your-Life&quot; or failing to acknowledge the situation in &quot;Welcome to the Wicked Wax Museum&quot; as an emergency). If (s)he makes one of these choices the book will break the fourth wall and demand that the reader turns back and choose a better option, or sometimes simply end the whole book then and there. This literary trope is characteristic of many late 20th century Western works of metafiction.

It is also worth noting that the main character is never named and is usually of ambiguous gender; therefore the reader can easily imagine himself or herself as the main character regardless of what sex he or she is, however, sometimes the occasional &quot;he&quot; slips through. There is, however, a &quot;friend character&quot; who is named and given a gender, these characters are normally present throughout the storyline. The only thing linking the main character in each story is that they are self-proclaimed &quot;Goosebumps Experts&quot;.

===Endings===
Because of the choices and page connections, there are many ways the story can end. These vary depending on which book is being read, but largely the endings involve the reader&#x27;s character dying, permanently metamorphosing into something other than human, getting trapped somewhere inescapable (implying that one will die eventually), being put in a state of immobility such as becoming a statue, or - if the correct choices are met - surviving the story. The ending pages are the only ones which have no choices, and simply have the words &quot;The End&quot; where the choices would usually be. Occasionally it will just say &quot;End&quot; because it is supposed to be part of the final sentence, or it will say something else appropriate.

There are also endings that combine the above options, such as being mutated, and then being killed because of whatever it is they are now or an almost &quot;good&quot; ending in which - despite the reader&#x27;s metamorphosis - the ending is still relatively satisfying. In &quot;The Deadly Experiments of Dr. Eeek&quot;, the reader can metamorphose into a dog if the wrong choice is chosen, but still gets home in one ending, albeit stuck in dog form, and becoming a world-famous show dog. Not all bad choices will take the reader to a bad ending immediately; instead, they will sometimes take the reader to another page which has its own choices, but all of them will lead to a bad ending - this is because a previous choice has put the reader in an inescapable situation, where there is no chance of making it out alive, and although they do not die immediately from that choice, the reader has ultimately gotten &quot;killed&quot; by making that decision. Fortunately, the reverse occasionally happens as well; some choices will take the reader to a page with choices that all lead to a good ending.

In addition, each book involves at least one page where the reader&#x27;s knowledge of the actual &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books is called into question. This can either involve them being asked a question relating to one of the actual &quot;Goosebumps&quot; books, or simply being faced with something that has previously appeared in &quot;Goosebumps&quot; that only a true &quot;Goosebumps&quot; fan would know how to respond to. For the questions, the reader is given the choice of turning to one of two pages - one where they give the correct answer and one where they give the wrong answer (which usually has some subtle similarities to the correct one). For the references, the reader is just given choices, which are blatant if they know what book the choices are referring to, but make no sense if they do not. Answering correctly will allow the story to continue, but answering incorrectly will normally result in death. There is at least one good ending in each book, as opposed to the 20+ scary endings (explained above).

==US and UK versions of covers==
The covers were metallic and holographic, showing a basic design repeated on the cover background. One color colored the entire design, and the design would change slightly when the book was moved to different areas of light. The design itself changed with every book, although some of the designs are repeated, as in books 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, and 19. Three illustrators did the cover illustrations, the first was Tim Jacobus, who did the original series and &quot;Goosebumps Series 2000&quot;. Jacobus only did one cover, &quot;Escape from the Carnival of Horrors&quot;, and it is often mistaken for Mark Nagata, who illustrated the next 22 books, because Jacobus&#x27; signature is not visible on the front. It is, however, visible on the back, as it was obscured by Choose from over 20 Different Scary Endings! on the front.
Mark Nagata illustrated the next book, &quot;Tick Tock, You&#x27;re Dead!&quot;, throughout number 24, &quot;Lost in Stinkeye Swamp&quot;. Number 25, &quot;Shop Till You Drop... Dead!&quot;, was illustrated by Craig White, whose illustrations were made with computers and who illustrated the last 17 through number 42, &quot;All Day Nightmare&quot; and all 8 of the special edition books.

* In the UK, books 1-14 contained covers with the pictures almost completely obscured by an illustration of a slimy substance
:* &quot;This occasionally obscured important parts of the cover (e.g. in &quot;Diary of a Mad Mummy&quot;, it is impossible to actually see the diary on the UK cover.) The later books of the UK had more detail to them and were no longer covered, but still had slightly less detail than the US version.&quot;
* The UK version did not sparkle like the US version.
* The US version had a tagline on the back of the books, the UK version did not
* The synopses between the UK/US were different.

<text>Reef safe is a distinction used in the saltwater aquarium hobby to indicate that a fish or invertebrate is safe to add to a reef aquarium. There is no fish that is completely reef safe. Every fish that is commonly listed as reef safe are species that usually do not readily consume small fish or invertebrates. Fish listed as reef safe also do not bother fellow fish unless in some cases, for instance tangs, they do not get along with conspecifics and sometimes fish with similar color or body shape. Every fish has a personality, is different, and, in some cases, are opportunistic feeders. Tangs, which by most accounts are reef safe, may in adulthood eat some crustaceans shortly after they molt. Many larger predatory fish, for instance eels and pufferfish, will adapt very well to a reef tank and will be problem-free as long as they have sizable tank-mates and no crustaceans. Some aquarists have also had success in keeping smaller fish with predatory ones in reef tanks by adding the smaller fish at night, sometimes with newly rearranged rockwork.

== Reef safe ==
=== Fish ===
; Anthias
; Basslets
; Blennies: Excludes fang blennies. A few species will nip at polyps and giant clam mantles.
; Cardinalfish
; Chromis
; Clownfish: Excludes the maroon clown which can grow very aggressive and territorial.
; Damsels: Excludes larger, more aggressive Dascyllus varieties.
; Dwarf angelfish: Dwarf angelfish in a reef setting has been heavily debated.
; Dottybacks: They may consume small shrimp and can be highly aggressive.
; Dragonets
; Foxface: Foxface and rabbitfish will occasionally eat certain corals if underfed.
; Gobies
; Jawfish
; Pipefish: They can be killed by stinging corals and anemones.
; Pseudochromis: They may consume small shrimp and can be highly aggressive.
; Seahorses: They can be killed by stinging corals and anemones.
; Tangs
; Wrasse: There are both reef safe wrasses and ones that are notorious for killing small fish and invertebrates.
; Planktivorous Triggerfish: With caution.
: &quot;Melichthys&quot; spp.
: &quot;Xanthichthys&quot; spp.
: &quot;Odonus&quot; spp.

=== Invertebrates ===
; Corals (Class Anthozoa): There are aggressive types of coral which have sweeper tentacles that can burn other corals. These may require specific placement in an aquarium.
; Crabs: Specifically small hermit crabs, anemone crabs, emerald mithrax crabs, and strawberry crabs.
; Fan worms (Suborder Sabellida)
; Giant clams
; Scallops
; Sea anemones (Order Actiniaria): Anemones, especially carpet anemones can eat fish and burn corals to death requiring specific placement for specimens in an aquarium.
; Sea cucumbers
; Sea fans
; Sea slugs
; Starfish / Sea stars: There are many starfish which are not reef safe like crown-of-thorns starfish and chocolate chip sea star.
; Shrimps: Peppermint shrimps, cleaner shrimps, pistol shrimps, anemone shrimps and blood red fire shrimps are better choices since the commonly available banded coral shrimp can kill fish, and the mantis shrimp will kill and eat most animals in a tank.
; Snails: Some snails are parasitic but are rarely, if ever, offered in the saltwater aquaria trade.
; Sponges
; Tunicates (sea squirts)

== Reef unsafe ==
=== Fish ===
; Non-dwarf Angelfish: This includes any of the larger angelfish.
; Non-planktivorous Butterflyfish: Eat mainly or exclusively coral polyps
; Non-planktivorous Triggerfish: This includes most triggerfish. Most triggerfish are highly aggressive carnivores that will eat many smaller fish and invertebrates in an aquarium. They also grow to be quite large.

=== Invertebrates ===
; Sea apples: Currently short-lived in aquaria. They release a highly-toxic substance at death, decimating the aquarium.

<text>Philip Hone (October 25, 1780 – May 5, 1851) was Mayor of New York City from 1826 to 1827. He was most notable for a detailed diary he kept from 1828 until the time of his death in 1851, which is said to be the most extensive and detailed history on the first half of 19th-century America. 

==Early life==
Hone was born in New York City on October 25, 1780. He was the son of Philip Hone (1743–1798), a German immigrant carpenter, and Esther (née Bourdet) Hone (1742–1798).

==Career==
Hone first began working in the auction business, which made him wealthy. He was also a successful merchant and a founder of the Mercantile Library Association and he was the first president of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company in 1825 and 1826.

He became a man of great prominence in New York society for his wealth, sophistication, extensive travel and good taste, and was good friends with most of the political, artistic and scientific leaders of his day. Most notable among them were: Washington Irving, Samuel Morse, Daniel Webster, John Jacob Astor and U.S. Presidents John Quincy Adams and Martin Van Buren.

Hone&#x27;s diary records not only his society engagements and the major events and spectacles in the city in the first half of the century, but also his view of a changing city: his disapproval of Andrew Jackson; the disconcerting effects of the city&#x27;s constant construction; and his utter disgust with most Irish immigrants.

In 1827, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician. Hone lived in an elegant town house at 235 Broadway, opposite City Hall Park. The site was later one of those purchased by F. W. Woolworth for construction of the Woolworth Building.

===Political career===
Originally a Federalist, he was elected mayor in 1826 and served one term. He later became active in the Whig Party.

During the Zachary Taylor administration, he served as Naval Officer of the Port of New York.

==Personal life==
Hone was married to Catharine Dunscomb (1778–1850), the daughter of Daniel and Margaret Dunscomb. Catherine&#x27;s sister, Margaret Bradford Dunscomb, was married to Robert Swartwout, the military officer, merchant, alderman, and Navy agent. Together, they were the parents of:

* Robert Swartwout Hone (1815–1898), who married Eliza Rodman Russell, a daughter of merchant Charles Handy Russell.
* Mary S. Hone (1814–1840), who married John Jones Schermerhorn (1806–1876), the son of Peter Schermerhorn and brother of William Colford Schermerhorn, in 1832.

Hone died in New York City on May 5, 1851. He was buried at Saint Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery.

===Legacy===
Honesdale, Pennsylvania, is named in honor of Philip Hone, as is Hone Avenue in the Bronx.

<doc id="1158968" wikidata="Q7190637" url="?curid=1158968" title="Pichhwai">
<text>Pichhwai (also pichwai, pichhavai, pichhvai, pechhavai etc), literally meaning &#x27;that which hangs from the back&#x27; from the Sanskrit words &quot;Pichh&quot; means back and &quot;wais&quot; means hanging, are large devotional Hindu painted pictures, normally on cloth, which portray Krishna. They are mainly made to hang in Hindu temples of the Pushtimarg devotional tradition, especially the Shrinathji Temple in Nathdwara, Rajasthan, built around 1672. They are hung behind the idol of Shrinathji, a local form of Krishna and the centre of Pushtimarg worship, to depict his &quot;leelas.&quot; Aurangabad was another area associated with them. The purpose of pichhwais, other than artistic appeal, is to narrate tales of Krishna to the illiterate. Temples have sets with different images, which are changed according to the calendar of festivals celebrating the deity.

Nathdwara painting covers these and similar works in other genres, especially Indian miniature paintings. Like the Pushtimarg tradition, they originated in the Deccan, but are now mainly associated with Western India.

== Style of Painting ==

=== Iconography ===
The main image portrayed in Pichhwai paintings is Shrinathji. This 700+ years old form of Krishna, is the presiding deity worshipped at the Shrinathji Temple with many paintings showing the rituals and worship offered to the deity in the temple. Modern pichhwais may also portray other forms of Krishna worshipped in the Pushtimarg tradition such as Dwarkadish, the presiding deity at the Dwarkadish Temple. Whilst these paintings focus on Shrinathji, paintings often depicts other deities in the tradition such as Yamunaji, Goswamis such as Vallabhacharya and other priests.

=== Themes ===
Pichhwais have two main functions within the Pushtimarg Sampradaya. Ones used as backdrops on the inner sanctums in the shrines, they are changed daily and are designed in accordance to the season, festival and rituals of that day. Other pichhwais are artists documentation of the worship in the faith. Each festival and ritual within the faith is an elaborate affair with a pichhwai showcasing the adornment, emotions, mood, music, food and dancing that encompasses the worship. With daily worship of Shrinathji having 8 different formal viewings, pichhwais may often depict the eight different adornments associated with each viewing. Festivals such as Govardhan Puja, Sharad Purnima, Raslila, Holi alongside other prominent festivals in Pushtimarg are depicted with vivid detail on the modes of worship and the items used. These Pichwais often also as a historical documentation on how and who participated in these festival throughout the doctrine&#x27;s history. 

==History of Production==

=== 16th - 19th Century ===
In 1672CE when the Shrinathji temple was established, Vitthalnath the chief priest and son of the Pushitmarg sect founder Vallabhachrya, employed artisans under the temple administration to create pichhwais. These were traditionally made by the artisans only on commission by the chief priest for religious worship and ceremonies. However in the coming centuries, as the sect grew to various part of India such as Gujarat and Mathura, the art styles reached those places as well. Pichhwais were made to be taken by pilgrims from Shrinathji temple but were also commissioned by wealthy families. The heavy and intricate nature of this art also led to its favour by theatre companies, with production companies commissioning as backdrops for productions.

=== 19th Century ===
The start of the century had westernised art school painting forms gaining more preferability to the Indian business and upper classes compared to traditional styles such as pichhwai. To increase pichhwai demand, artisans started to make slight shifts in their painting techniques. pichwais were made both in the traditional style, but also started to incorporate western influences such as using oil paints and using realism rather than the traditional stylistic approach. One example is that the feet drawn in these paintings, particularity that of Shrinathji, were drawn with the western art technique of Foreshortening rather than the traditional portrayal of feet being sideways. However, this time period also had heavy influence from political movements such as the Swadeshi movement, where traditional Indian art, cultures and music was encouraged to be support. This, alongside the religious nature of the art form led artists to favour the traditional art styles and most artisans stayed with using traditional techniques in their own style.

=== Modern Day Production ===
Pichhwai have become the main export of Nathdwara and are in much demand among foreign visitors. The artists live mostly in Chitron ki gali (Street of paintings) and Chitrakaron ka mohallah (colony of painters) and are a close community with constant interaction. Often a pichhwai painting is a group effort, where several skilful painters work together under the supervision of a master artist.

There has also been a push by other artists and designers to preserve and showcase this art form to a wider, international audience. Designers have utilised the traditional colours, printing techniques and pattern styles associated pichhwai, in clothing attires and showcase them on international platforms such as Lakmé Fashion Week.

==== Artisans ====
Whilst little is known before the 19th century, the pichhwai artisans in Nathdwara come from three main sub-castes, the Adi Gaur who claim to have migrated from Udaipur, the Jangirs were migrated from Jaipur and Jodhpur, and the lesser known Mewaras.

<text>Old Town San Diego State Historic Park is a state protected historical park in the Old Town neighborhood of San Diego, California. The park commemorates the early days of San Diego; it includes many historic buildings from the period 1820 to 1870. The park was established in 1968. In 2005 and 2006, California State Parks listed Old Town San Diego as the most visited state park in California.

In 1969, the site was registered as California Historical Landmark No. 830. Then on September 3, 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Old Town San Diego Historic District.

==History==

The first European settlement on the West Coast of the present-day United States was the San Diego Presidio, a military outpost of Spanish California, founded by Gaspar de Portolà in 1769. Mission San Diego de Alcalá was founded by Father Junípero Serra the same year. The Presidio and Mission were originally built on a bluff above the San Diego River, Presidio Hill, which is now the site of the city-owned Presidio Park and which is immediately adjacent to Old Town State Historic Park.

After five years the Mission moved to a location several miles upriver at the present site of Mission San Diego de Alcalá. Presidio Hill remained the primary settlement for several decades because it was defensible against attack by European enemies or hostile Native Americans. As the need for defense decreased, settlers preferred to live at the base of the hill because of greater convenience. In the 1820s the town of San Diego grew up at the base of the bluff, at the site commemorated by Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. The Presidio was abandoned and fell into disrepair.

During the pueblo period following Mexican independence, the Old Town area was the commercial and governmental hub of the region, even though its population was never more than a few hundred. San Diego during this period is vividly described by Richard Henry Dana Jr. in his classic book &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot;. In 1834 the Mexican government granted San Diego the status of a pueblo or chartered town; however, its pueblo status was revoked in 1838 due to declining population. One problem limiting the town&#x27;s growth was its location far from navigable water. All imports and exports had to be brought ashore in Point Loma and carried several miles over La Playa Trail to the town.

When California was admitted to the United States in 1850, San Diego (still largely limited to the Old Town area) was made the county seat of San Diego County, even though the town&#x27;s population was only 650.

The Old Town area remained the heart of the city of San Diego until the 1860s, when a newcomer to San Diego named Alonzo Horton began to promote development at the site of present-day downtown San Diego. Residents and businesses quickly abandoned &quot;Old Town&quot; for Horton&#x27;s &quot;New Town&quot; because of New Town&#x27;s proximity to shipping. In 1871 government records were moved from Old Town to a new county courthouse in New Town, and Downtown permanently eclipsed Old Town as the focal point of San Diego.

Old Town San Diego State Historic Park preserves and recreates Old Town as it existed during the Mexican and early American periods, from its settlement in 1821, through 1872 when it lost its dominant position to Downtown.

The Old Town area is a popular tourist destination, known especially for its Mexican restaurants. The state park itself hosts several eating establishments, and other restaurants and gift shops are found in the surrounding neighborhood.

== Attractions ==


Five original adobe buildings are part of the complex, which includes shops, restaurants and museums. Other historic buildings include a schoolhouse, a blacksmith shop, San Diego&#x27;s first newspaper office, a cigar and pipe store, houses and gardens, and a stable with a carriage collection. There are also stores, with local artisans demonstrating their craft. The shops located in this area are festive and distinctive capturing the cultural history of San Diego. They have boutiques, antique stores, retro shops, outlet centers, and local independently owned shops. They also have diverse shops that highlight upcoming artists&#x27; work and their culture. There is no charge to enter the state park or any of its museums.

The museums include:
*Plaza San Diego Viejo, also called Plaza de Las Armas and Washington Square
*Casa de Estudillo, 1827 adobe house, a National Historic Landmark in its own right
*Casa de Machado y Silvas, 1840s adobe
*Casa de Machado y Stewart, a restored 19th century adobe
* Blackhawk Smithy &amp; Stable, which features blacksmith demonstrations
* Colorado House, reconstructed 1850s hotel building that serves as the Wells Fargo History Museum(Now closed), featuring a reconstructed 19th-century stage stop and telegraph office
* First San Diego Courthouse, a reconstructed mid-19th century courthouse
*Johnson House, a reconstructed mid-19th century office building later the house of George Alonzo Johnson.
* Mason Street School, the first public school house in San Diego
* Racine and Laramie (&quot;La Casa de Rodriguez&quot;), a reconstructed mid-19th century period tobacconist
* San Diego Union Museum, a mid-19th century period newspaper office and print shop
* Seeley Stables, a reconstructed mid-19th century stable and barns that feature horse-drawn buggies, wagons, carriages and western memorabilia
*Cosmopolitan Hotel and Restaurant (&quot;La Casa de Bandini&quot;), an 1870 restored hotel, still working as a hotel and restaurant.
* Living history demonstrations and free tours are regularly scheduled. Historical interpretation is primarily carried out by park employees and volunteers, and the Mexican Commercial Corner is host to several locally based small businesses and artists.

===Commercial concessions===

The commercial facilities in Old Town State Park, such as restaurants and gift shops, are managed by outside contractors. For more than 30 years the largest single contractor was Bazaar del Mundo (&quot;Bazaar of the World&quot;), run by San Diego businesswoman Diane Powers. In a controversial move, in 2005 the state park agency did not renew her contract but awarded it to Plaza del Pasado (&quot;Plaza of the Past&quot;), run by Delaware North Companies. The goal was to create a more authentic and historically accurate presentation and appreciation of life and commerce in San Diego from 1821 to 1872. However revenue plunged under the new management. In spring 2009, Delaware North withdrew from its contract with the state and management changed hands to the Old Town Family Hospitality Corporation, headed by local restaurateur Chuck Ross. The commercial area is now called Fiesta de Reyes (&quot;Festival of the Kings&quot;).

===Adjacent attractions===
*Adjacent to the state park is Heritage County Park, run by San Diego County. It houses seven buildings from the 1880s and 1890s which have been moved there from elsewhere in the city.
*Also nearby is the Mormon Battalion Historic Site. The city-owned Presidio Park, site of the original Presidio of San Diego, is on the adjacent hill.
*The San Diego Sheriff&#x27;s Museum and Educational Center is located in Old Town. It includes police equipment, uniforms, patrol car, helicopter, motorcycle, a jail cell and courtroom.
*The Whaley House museum is also nearby.

<doc id="1158974" wikidata="Q1754603" url="?curid=1158974" title="Lionheart (Kate Bush album)">
<text>Lionheart is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Kate Bush. It was released on 10 November 1978, nine months after Bush&#x27;s successful debut album &quot;The Kick Inside&quot;. &quot;Lionheart&quot; peaked at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart (her only album not to make the top 5), and has been certified Platinum by the BPI.

The first single taken from the album, &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, missed the UK Top 40. The follow-up single, &quot;Wow&quot;, was released on the back of Bush&#x27;s UK tour and peaked at No. 14 in the UK singles chart. The album is among Bush&#x27;s worst-reviewed, and Bush herself was reportedly not happy with the finished product, feeling it rushed.

==Overview==

=== Background ===
Following the success of her debut album, Kate Bush&#x27;s record company EMI were eager to get another out. Bush had composed many songs throughout her teens (she was at this time 19 years old); the majority of the tracks used for &quot;Lionheart&quot; were compositions from before her debut. Bush, however, was unhappy with the short length of time she had in which to produce the album. Recorded entirely at Super Bear Studios in Berre-les-Alpes on the French Riviera, this was to be her only album recorded outside the UK.

Of the ten tracks, only &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;, &quot;Fullhouse&quot; and &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot; were newly composed songs, although the other songs had been reworked by Bush in preparation for the recording. The album was produced, like her first, by Andrew Powell, with Bush feeling that she was at this stage too inexperienced to produce it herself (she would go on to produce all her following albums). Since the album&#x27;s release, Bush has many times said that she was unhappy with this album because of the restrictions imposed on it. In a 1989 interview she remarked: &quot;Considering how quickly we made it it&#x27;s a bloody good album, but I&#x27;m not really happy with it&quot;.

Bush said in a 1978 interview that some of the lyrics pertained to childhood. Literary references include J. M. Barrie&#x27;s Peter Pan in &quot;In Search of Peter Pan&quot; (a song which also quotes &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; from the Disney film &quot;Pinocchio&quot;), as well as a nod towards &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; in the song &quot;Coffee Homeground&quot;, which despite being similar in plot to the play, was inspired by a taxi driver who drove Bush once. Film references include &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, while although taking its name from the Hammer Film studios, is actually about a production of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;. The British television show &quot;The Sweeney&quot;, a popular police drama from the 1970s, was mentioned in the lyrics of the song &quot;Wow&quot;, which is a song about the music business and show business in general. &quot;Kashka from Baghdad&quot;, inspired by American detective series, is about the inhabitants of a town wondering about a couple living in an old house.

&quot;Lionheart&quot; was the first Kate Bush album to feature Del Palmer, who played bass and had previously been in the KT Bush Band. Palmer went on to play bass, or to engineer and record on every subsequent Kate Bush album up to and including &quot;50 Words for Snow&quot; (2011). He and Bush also had a long-term relationship between the late 1970s and early 1990s.

== Release ==
The album was released in November 1978, the title being taken from side one&#x27;s closing track &quot;Oh England My Lionheart&quot;. The front cover shot depicts Bush in an attic wearing a lion outfit, which she described as being &quot;slightly comical&quot;. The photographer was Gered Mankowitz. The lead single chosen was &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, which peaked at a low 44 in the UK (although fared better in many other countries). The album however performed well in the UK, peaking at No. 6. It remained on the chart well into 1979, its promotion being continued by the second single and Bush&#x27;s UK tour. In total it spent 36 weeks on the chart and was certified Platinum by the BPI for sales of over 300,000, making it one of Bush&#x27;s better-selling albums. The second single from the album was &quot;Wow&quot;, which was released in March 1979. This fared better than the first, peaking at No. 14 in the UK and performing well in many other countries also. In some territories, &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; was released instead. Around this time, Bush embarked on her first tour, which featured a number of songs from &quot;Lionheart&quot; – one of these (&quot;Don&#x27;t Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake&quot;) was included on the &quot;On Stage&quot; EP in September 1979.

In the US, the album was initially unreleased following the failure of her debut. As Bush gained a cult following over the coming years however, &quot;Lionheart&quot; was belatedly released in 1984 following the entry into the charts of her fourth album &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.

In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including &quot;Lionheart&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Reception to the album was average, with the album almost universally being looked upon as an inferior version of her debut. &quot;NME&quot;&#x27;s Ian Penman wrote: &quot;&#x27;Mature&#x27; lyrics sung in that twee irritating schoolgirl-siren voice [...] Actually most of the time she&#x27;s nearer a vague British lineage – Barbara Dickson to Lynsey de Paul – than a Joni/Janis wonderland&quot;. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; was not convinced and wrote about the performance between the musicians: &quot;The feel is often bland and soulless&quot;. Reviewer Chris Westwood concluded: &quot;A product which is at best moderate, lacking and often severely irritating... This is flat conceived silliness.&quot; The American magazine &quot;Trouser Press&quot; rated it well, in particular the songs &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot;, &quot;In the Warm Room&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Push Your Foot on the Heartbrake&quot;.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Mike DeGagne feels that the album lacks substance, while noting that Bush was capable of much better work. In a &quot;Guardian&quot; poll of Bush&#x27;s best albums, &quot;Lionheart&quot; placed lowly with just 2% of the vote. While Bush herself has said that she was unhappy with the finished album, she has mentioned satisfaction with the track &quot;Wow&quot;.

<doc id="1158984" wikidata="Q2936446" url="?curid=1158984" title="Gun (cellular automaton)">
<text>In a cellular automaton, a gun is a pattern with a main part that repeats periodically, like an oscillator, and that also periodically emits spaceships. There are then two periods that may be considered: the period of the spaceship output, and the period of the gun itself, which is necessarily a multiple of the spaceship output&#x27;s period. A gun whose period is larger than the period of the output is a pseudoperiod gun.


In the Game of Life, for every &quot;p&quot; greater than or equal to 14, it is possible to construct a glider gun in which the gliders are emitted with period &quot;p&quot;.

Since guns continually emit spaceships, the existence of guns in Life means that initial patterns with finite numbers of cells can eventually lead to configurations with limitless numbers of cells, something that John Conway himself originally conjectured to be impossible. However, according to Conway&#x27;s later testimony, this conjecture was explicitly intended to encourage someone to disprove it – i.e., Conway hoped that infinite-growth patterns did exist.

Bill Gosper discovered the first glider gun in 1970, earning $50 from Conway. The discovery of the glider gun eventually led to the proof that Conway&#x27;s Game of Life could function as a Turing machine. For many years this glider gun was the smallest one known in Life, although other rules had smaller guns.

<doc id="1158986" wikidata="Q535579" url="?curid=1158986" title="Something Else by the Kinks">
<text>Something Else by the Kinks, often referred to simply as Something Else, is the fifth studio album by the English rock band the Kinks, released on 15 September 1967 by Pye Records. The album continued the Kinks&#x27; trend toward an eccentric baroque pop and music hall-influenced style defined by frontman Ray Davies&#x27; observational and introspective lyrics. It also marked the final involvement of American producer Shel Talmy in the Kinks&#x27; 1960s studio recordings; henceforth Ray Davies would produce the group&#x27;s recordings. Many of the songs feature the keyboard work of Nicky Hopkins and the backing vocals of Davies&#x27;s wife, Rasa. The album was preceded by the singles &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, one of the group&#x27;s most acclaimed songs, and the Dave Davies solo record &quot;Death of a Clown&quot;, both of which charted in the UK top 3.

Though it contained two major European hits and earned positive notices from the music press in both the UK and US, &quot;Something Else&quot; sold poorly and became the Kinks&#x27; lowest-charting album in both countries at the time. As with the group&#x27;s other albums from the period, however, it found retrospective praise and became a cult favourite. The album was ranked No. 288 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was voted number 237 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; 3rd Edition (2000).

==Recording==
Ray Davies assumed control over production after the departure of Shel Talmy; hence &quot;Something Else&quot; marked a change in the sound and production style of the Kinks. Davies felt unsure of his skill in mixing and recording the group&#x27;s records, and later commented: &quot;I feel that I shouldn&#x27;t have been allowed to produce &quot;Something Else&quot;. What went into an album required someone whose approach was a little bit more mundane&quot;.

Apart from &quot;End of the Season&quot; (done in April 1966), the album was recorded between the autumn of 1966 and the summer of 1967, when the Kinks had cut back on touring and had begun recording and stockpiling songs for Davies&#x27;s as-yet poorly defined &quot;village green&quot; project. The song &quot;Village Green&quot; was recorded in November 1966 during the sessions for the album, but was released on a French EP in 1967 and did not appear on a Kinks LP until the next release, &quot;The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society&quot;.

==Composition==
Musically, &quot;Something Else&quot; features multiple different genres and stylistic influences, from the chamber pop of &quot;Death of a Clown&quot; to the bossa nova of &quot;No Return&quot;. With the exception of the garage rock-style &quot;Love Me Till the Sun Shines&quot; the album was a departure from the hard-edged rock and roll of the group&#x27;s earlier material, instead featuring mellower, acoustic baroque pop ballads, English music hall, and &quot;tempered&quot; R&amp;B.

Ray Davies&#x27;s lyrics on the album deal with English-inspired subject matter, particularly the harpsichord-laden &quot;Two Sisters&quot;, the lazy shuffle &quot;End of the Season&quot;, and the sardonic &quot;David Watts&quot;.

The album includes three songs composed by Dave Davies, including the hit single &quot;Death of a Clown&quot;.

==Reception==

The album sold poorly in the UK, in part because it competed with budget-priced compilation albums of early Kinks hits from 1964 to 1966; also, Pye Records had released &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;, &quot;Death of a Clown&quot; and other songs before the album appeared. &quot;Something Else&quot; also sold poorly in the US upon release there in January 1968, where the group was still the subject of a US ban on live and television performances.

James Pomeroy, in a March 1968 review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, felt it was the best album the Kinks had made to that point, praising the &quot;humor, cynicism, perception and irony&quot; where he felt the band are at their best. He picked out &quot;David Watts&quot; and &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot; as the best tracks, and also praised the three contributions of Dave Davies.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that the work was characterised by &quot;nostalgic and sentimental&quot; songwriting, and that part of &quot;the album&#x27;s power lies in its calm music, since it provides an elegant support for Davies&#x27; character portraits and vignettes&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Something Else&quot; was ranked No. 288 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, No. 289 in a 2012 revised list, and later at No. 478 in the 2020 revised list.

==Personnel==
According to the band researcher Doug Hinman, except where noted:

The Kinks
*Ray Davies lead vocals, electric and acoustic guitars, keyboards; Mellotron ; producer 
*Dave Davies backing vocals, electric guitars; lead vocals 
*Pete Quaife backing vocals, bass guitar
*Mick Avory drums; tambourine 
*Unidentified (played by the Kinks) handclaps 

Additional musicians
*The Mike Cotton Sound flute, saxophone and trumpet 
*Rasa Davies backing vocals
*Nicky Hopkins piano; harpsichord ; organ 
*David Whitaker string arrangement 
*Unnamed session musicians cello and viola 

Additional production
*Shel Talmy producer 
*Alan MacKenzie engineer
*Alan O&#x27;Duffy (credited as &quot;Irish&quot;) assistant engineer

Note
*The UK edition of the LP does not list a producer while the US edition credits Shel Talmy Productions. In April 1967, after most of the album had been recorded, Davies became unsatisfied with Talmy&#x27;s production. The relationship between the two dissolved, leaving Davies to produce the rest of the album alone. Dispute remains over who produced which tracks, though Hinman concludes the LP is &quot;a mixture of Ray Davies-produced and Shel Talmy-produced recordings.&quot;

<doc id="1158989" wikidata="Q1345758" url="?curid=1158989" title="Islay Airport">
<text>Islay Airport (also known as Glenegedale Airport) () is located north-northwest of Port Ellen on the island of Islay in Argyll and Bute, off the west coast of Scotland. It is a small rural airport owned and maintained by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited. Today the airport is used for scheduled services to the Scottish mainland, and for air ambulances.

==History==
The aerodrome was opened in May 1933, and initially services were provided from Glasgow via Campbeltown by the Midland and Scottish Air Ferries company. However, this was short-lived as the company closed down in late 1934. Services were taken over by a new company, Northern &amp; Scottish Airways who operated a De Havilland Dragon aircraft three times per week from Glasgow. In 1937, the company amalgamated with Highland Airways and formed Scottish Airways, who operated daily flights from Glasgow to Islay on Monday to Saturday. This service continued with minor disruptions for urgent military duties for the duration of the Second World War.

In 1940, during the Second World War, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, ordered military airfields to be constructed in the western islands of Scotland, both to defend against a German assault on the Scottish mainland and also to provide reconnaissance planes a base to fly missions over the Atlantic Ocean. The present Islay airport was constructed as RAF Port Ellen in 1940, and received a concrete runway in 1942. During the Second World War, over 1,500 Royal Air Force (RAF) personnel were stationed at RAF Port Ellen.

The following units were here at some point:
* Relief Landing Ground for No. 3 (Coastal) Operational Training Unit RAF (August 1941)
* No. 48 Squadron RAF
* No. 304 Ferry Training Unit RAF (December 1942 – December 1943)
* 878 Naval Air Squadron
* 890 Naval Air Squadron

On 1 February 1947, Scottish Airways Ltd and its subsidiary company Western Isles Airways Ltd was taken over by British European Airways Corporation as part of the nationalisation of transport services under the Civil Aviation Act of 1946. In 1948, a question was raised in the House of Commons in relation to the number of staff (17) currently employed.

On 28 September 1957, de Havilland Heron 1B G-AOFY, while operating a flight for the Scottish Air Ambulance Service, crashed on approach to Islay, in bad weather. The three occupants, Captain T.M. Calderwood, radio officer Hugh McGinlay, and Sister Jane Kennedy from Glasgow&#x27;s Southern General Hospital were killed. One of the remaining two Herons was named &quot;Sister Jean Kennedy&quot; after the nurse; the other after James Young Simpson, a Scottish pioneer in anaesthetics. This was the first crash in the history of the Scottish Air Ambulance Service.

On 29 June 1994, the Prince of Wales made headlines when he overshot the runway while landing a BAe 146 of No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron of the RAF on the runway of the airport. Although no one was injured, the plane was badly damaged.

Glas falls in love with her and agrees to help even though she already has another lover. He attempts to intervene, but the Reverend refuses to give up his &quot;marital rights&quot; – she must have sex with him whether she likes it or not. So, in order to make his love happy, he begins to plot her husband&#x27;s murder. The novel also deals with issues such as abortion, women&#x27;s rights, suicide, euthanasia, and eugenics. Not surprisingly, the book triggered a violent campaign against its author who was subsequently vilified in Swedish literary circles.

<text>Fajãzinha is a civil parish in the municipality of Lajes das Flores located from the main town of Lajes das Flores, on the western coast of Portuguese island of Flores. The population in 2021 was 71, in an area of . It contains the localities Fajãzinha and Ladeiras.

==History==

The western coast was explored during the middle of the 16th century, with the first stable settlements appearing in the beginning of the following century. These first colonists were captained by João Soares, native of São Miguel, who settled in the area of Lajedo.

Fajãzinha was de-annexed from Lajes das Flores in July 1676, by provision of the bishop of Angra, friar D. Lourenço de Castro. The parish of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios das Fajãs was established, with a jurisdiction that included the western coast from Ponta da Fajã until Mosteiro. It is the fourth oldest religious parish on the island.

One of the first stories from Fajãzinha was in 1789, by a judge, José Gonçalves da Silva, who referred to the construction of a stone bridge over the Ribeira Grande. It was a formidable construction for the era. It became historically referred to as &quot;a ponte da má memória&quot; (&quot;the bridge of bad memories&quot;); as Father António Camões would relate:
:&quot;[There was a flood in 1794] that did not just destroy the bridge, but not as much as a small vestige, no remains, it disappeared from the rivers course, disappearing into the sea, leaving a large sandy debris field to a distance of 300 braças [], with unmeasurable loss for the farmers who had lands along the river&#x27;s banks, and whom to the sea lost all.&quot;

Administratively, Fajãzinha has always been an administrative division of Lajes das Flores. Between 1895 and 1898, it was de-annexed from Lajes and incorporated into the neighbouring municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores. Since 1616 it was the religious center of the parish of the Fajãs, a Catholic organ whose principal patron was Nossa Senhora dos Remédios, that included Ponta, Fajã Grande, Caldeira and Mosteiro. But by 1850, Mosteiro and Caldeira become their own parishes, and in 1861, Fajã Grande and Ponta Delgada das Flores, received the same privilege.

===20th century===
On 3 December 2010, around 5:00 am, following 72 consecutive hours of rain, a mudslide hit the town, causing severe destruction. During the event, homes were inundated, while cars and property were dragged away by a river of mud, water, vegetation and refuse from the village. At about 11:50 a.m., as the showers dissipated, the extent of the damage was made evident: the &quot;junta de freguesia&quot; (), main access to the hamlet, and electricity were cut off (although EDA, the local utility, was able to put the village on generators quickly). As some villagers congregated in the primary school and local church, some were immediately evacuated to the tourist village of Cuada to the south of parish.

On 13 June 2012, the &quot;Secretaria Regional da Ciência, Tecnologia e Equipamentos&quot; (&quot;Regional Secretariat for Science, Technology and Equipment&quot;) awarded the contract for construction of two retaining walls, construction of ditches and new paving of the parish to Tecnovia Açores, S.A. in order to improve access to the region following the mudslides.

==Geography==

The parish is located on the west coast of the Flores, south of the Fajã Grande, and extends through an irregular plain that includes four crater-lakes: &quot;Lagoa Funda&quot; (&quot;Deep Lake&quot;, which is deep), &quot;Lagoa Comprida&quot; (&quot;Long Lake&quot;), &quot;Lagoa Branca&quot; (&quot;White Lake&quot;), and &quot;Lagoa Seca&quot; (Dry Lake). It is an area of many peat-bogs, and forests of endemic plants, including the &quot;cedro-do-mato&quot; (Azorean juniper), used by local artisans. Nearby is the waterfall, Cascata da Ribeira Grande.

Fajãzinha is intersected by the Ribeira Grande, a major river/rapids on the island, which, apart from its crystalline waters, is known for its innumerable floods. Father José António Camões, in his work Roteiro Exacto da Costa da Ilha, mentions the following:
:&quot;Passing that population you will encounter Ribeira Grande, which divides this parish...its exaggerated force and impetuousness, which is truly great. The waters fall from a formidable height, extreme in the parish of Fajãzinha, from a height of 200 braças [] it falls; it incorporates and aggregates all the waters of the headlands, which demarcate the parish, from the east to southwest, which is the river-valley of the blacksmiths, four grottoes, without name in the Rocha do Velho, the grotto do Enchente, whose waters increase in volume and become furious in the winter, and also when there is rain in the summer, its invariable.&quot;

The region is a natural jewel, that João Vieira wrote:
:&quot;“Along the difficult, the hand of man, with much sweat, constructed a church and houses, opened a road where heavy trucks cross, means of communication with the rest of the island. It&#x27;s an admirable example of the implantation in the land and harmony with nature. Seen from above, the houses, maybe because of jealousy, run to the seas, accompanying Ribeira Grande, which has for four centuries have filled the navigable waters that crossed between the Old and New World. Between cereal fields of corn that circle the white homes, a road of black asphalt serpentine between greenery. If a biblical paradise existed by the sea...we could think that this corner was part of it...&quot;

The 2011 Lorca earthquake was responsible for creating a special wetland around the coast of Fajazinha. Baptized the &quot;Lagoa do Rolo&quot;, it has become the most westerly lake in Europe, although it is considerably small, spawning a small habitat for migrating birds from North America, during the fall (including the hawfinch and the hooded merganser).

<doc id="1159023" wikidata="Q1019497" url="?curid=1159023" title="Mosteiro (Lajes das Flores)">
<text>Mosteiro is the smallest civil parish in the municipality of Lajes das Flores on the Portuguese island of Flores, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2021 was 19, in an area of .

==History==
Its toponymy has been debated by historians, although some theories suggest that it was named for the comparable civil parish on the island of São Miguel. The first colonists, motivated to settle here by a man named João Soares, were settlers from the region of Mosteiros, renaming this zone in its honour.

In 1676, the locality of Mosteiro was de-annexed from the parish of Lajes das Flores and included in the ecclesiastical parish of the Fajãs, with its seat in the parish of &quot;Nossa Senhora dos Remédios da Fajanzinha&quot;.

The adventurer António de Freitas, former seminarian, had emigrated to China, where he made his fortune. Returning from his life in the Far East in 1846, he ordered the construction of the Parochial Church of Mosteiro, in the invocation of the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot;, in gratitude for God&#x27;s intervention in saving his possessions during the trip.

In 1850, Mosteiro was elevated to parish, along with Caldeira, on the completion of the parochial church. As related by Francisco Gomes, &quot;at the time of the erection of the parish it was decently ornamented, and provided with vestments, and other objects necessary for the Divine Cult&quot;. During this period, the parish included 90 homes, including 300 inhabitants. As Father José António Camões, wrote after describing the bridge of Sargo, he also referred to the small port of Mosteiro &quot;&quot;where tragically three or four boats capsized...the small port is part of a small community called &quot;Os Mosteiros&quot;, and indicate the existence of two streams, the &quot;Ribeira do Mosteiro&quot; and &quot;Ribeira dos Ladrões&quot; (or Fundão) that ends the district of the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Remédios and Nossa Senhora do Rosário of Lajes&quot;&quot;. The same historian referred to a population of 31 homes, including 83 men and 92 women, noting: &quot;There are eight tiled houses, and not a man who wears shoes. There is a twenty-year judge with scribe, subject to the jurisdiction of the town of Lajes. The ordinance soldiers of the village are subordinate to the 2nd company in the villa of Lajes.&quot;

During the 18th century, with the lack of development and investments, many of the residents from the parish abandoned the parish for prosperous centres in Brazil. This was later supplanted by emigration to the United States.

The parish continued to be part of the municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores, between 18 November 1895 and 13 January 1898, when Lajes was suppressed.

==Geography==
The parish of Mosteiro is part of the municipality of Lajes das Flores, whose municipal seat is located . With an area of , it was one of the smallest parishes in Portugal, constituted by the settlements of Mosteiro and the locality of Caldeira.

The parish and pure coastal waters is a natural sanctuary for endemic, maritime flora and fauna, many unexplored, offering excellent conditions for fishing, diving and nautical sports.

==Economy==
Agriculture, herding and a subsistence economy supports the economy of the parish. Cultivation of lands and raising of dairy/cattle are the essential parts of the islands&#x27; economy. Almost all the residents raise dairy cattle, on a susbsistence basis, in particular pastures and greenspace, resulting in the associated nickname &quot;Green Meat&quot; (). Considered a specialty market, the meat produce has become a regional mark for the island.

Mosteiro is the centre of the regional public school for basic and 1st cycle instruction, but is inoperationive due to the lack of students.

Helping to support its nascent tourist market, the parish maintains several historical buildings and structures; these include parochial church, the &quot;Império de Divino Espírito Santo&quot;, the watermills and lookouts, such as the &quot;Chafariz da Caldeira&quot;, &quot;Cabeço do Sinal&quot;, &quot;Cabeço da Muda&quot;, &quot;Vista do Portal Poio&quot; and &quot;Cruz dos Bredos&quot;.

* Haylofts of Mosteiro (), a group of haylofts characterized by two story buildings of local stone, dating from the 19th century;

===Religious===
* Church of Santíssima Trindade (), an 18th-century, Revivalist temple, comprising a single nave and presbytery, with a well-illuminated interior and ceilings of wood. The principal facade was completed with a triangular frontispiece, marked by a rectangular portico and oculi, while the interior include a high altar, two lateral retables on angles, in addition to a revivalist altarpiece;
* Funeral Monument of António Freitas (), situated in the cemetery of Mosteiro, the funeral monument is composed of an urn elevated above four steps over a plinth, while surmounted by cross. The monument includes decorative elements, such as flowers, and to the north, the urn is decorated with a skull and crossbones.

<doc id="1159024" wikidata="Q1030183" url="?curid=1159024" title="Neil Gershenfeld">
<text>Neil Adam Gershenfeld (born December 1, 1959) is an American professor at MIT and the director of MIT&#x27;s Center for Bits and Atoms, a sister lab to the MIT Media Lab. His research studies are predominantly focused in interdisciplinary studies involving physics and computer science, in such fields as quantum computing, nanotechnology, and personal fabrication. He is a Fellow of the American Physical Society. &quot;Scientific American&quot; has named Gershenfeld one of their &quot;Scientific American 50&quot; for 2004 and has also named him Communications Research Leader of the Year. Gershenfeld is also known for releasing the &quot;Great Invention Kit&quot; in 2008, a construction set that users can manipulate to create various objects.

Gershenfeld has been featured in a variety of newspapers and magazines such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Economist&quot;, and on NPR.
He was named as one of the 40 modern-day Leonardos by the Museum of Science and Industry Chicago. &quot;Prospect&quot; named him as one of the top 100 public intellectuals.

==Early life and education==
Gershenfeld was born on September 1, 1959, in Ardmore, Pennsylvania. He attended Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, then Swarthmore College, where he graduated in 1981 with a B.A. degree in physics with high honors. In 1990, he earned a Ph.D. in physics at Cornell University, titled &quot;Representation of chaos&quot;.

==Career==

In 1998, Gershenfeld started a class at MIT called &quot;How to make (almost) anything&quot;. Gershenfeld wanted to introduce expensive, industrial-size machines to the technical students. However, this class attracted a lot of students from various backgrounds: artists, architects, designers, students without any technical background. In his interview to CNN, Gershenfeld said that &quot;the students... were answering a question I didn&#x27;t ask, which is: What is this stuff good for? And the answer is: Not to make what you can buy in stores, but to make what you can&#x27;t buy in stores. It&#x27;s to personalise fabrication&quot;. Gershenfeld believes that this is the beginning of a new revolution: digital revolution in fabrication that will allow people to fabricate things, machines on demand.

Gershenfeld has presented his course on &quot;How to make (almost) anything&quot; at the Association of Professional Model Makers (APMM) 2010 Conference.

This class later has led Gershenfeld to create Fab lab in collaboration with Bakhtiar Mikhak at MIT. Gershenfeld feels very passionate about this project, as he believes that teaching kids how to use technology and create it themselves will empower the future generations to become more independent and create technology that each individual community needs, not a technology that is currently available on the market. Fab labs have spread around the world, having been established in the remotest of places and countries. In his interview with &quot;Discover&quot; magazine on the question what personal fabrication might be useful for, Gershenfeld said, &quot;There is a surprising need for emergent technologies in many of the least developed places on the planet. While our needs might be fairly well met, there are billions of people on the planet whose needs are not. Their problems don&#x27;t need incremental tweaks in current technology, but a revolution&quot;.

As well as &quot;How to make (almost) anything&quot; class, Gershenfeld has started teaching the following classes: &quot;How To Make Something That Makes (almost) Anything&quot;, &quot;The Physics of Information Technology&quot;, &quot;The Nature of Mathematical Modeling&quot;.

Gershenfeld has been a keynote speaker at the Congress of Science and Technology Leaders (2015, 2016).

==Research==

Neil Gershenfeld is the director for MIT&#x27;s Centre for Bits and Atoms. His research lab&#x27;s work has been published in &quot;Science&quot; as well as in The American Physical Society journal. Amongst many is the research on Experimental Implementation of Fast Quantum Searching, Microfluidic Bubble Logic research, Physical one-way functions.

<text>A boule is a single-crystal ingot produced by synthetic means.

A boule of silicon is the starting material for most of the integrated circuits used today. In the semiconductor industry synthetic boules can be made by a number of methods, such as the Bridgman technique and the Czochralski process, which result in a cylindrical rod of material.

In the Czochralski process a seed crystal is required to create a larger crystal, or ingot. This seed crystal is dipped into the pure molten silicon and slowly extracted. The molten silicon grows on the seed crystal in a crystalline fashion. As the seed is extracted the silicon solidifies and eventually a large, cylindrical boule is produced.

A semiconductor crystal boule is normally cut into circular wafers using an inside hole diamond saw or diamond wire saw, and each wafer is lapped and polished to provide substrates suitable for the fabrication of semiconductor devices on its surface.

The process is also used to create sapphires, which are used for substrates in the production of blue and white LEDs, optical windows in special applications and as the protective covers for watches.

<text>Saúl Morales Corral (3 May 1973 – 28 February 2000) was a Spanish racing cyclist, who was born in Madrid.

Morales became a professional in 1999, at the Fuenlabrada team. That year his fellow team member Manuel Sanroma died during the Volta a Catalunya. Three years earlier, José Antonio Espinosa, another Fuenlabrada member, died as well. In 2000, during the Vuelta a la Argentina, he was hit by a truck that accidentally came between the riders. Out of protest, several European teams withdrew from the race; it has not been held since.

Morales&#x27; only victory was a stage in the 1999 Vuelta a Venezuela.

<text>Fazenda is a civil parish in the municipality of Lajes das Flores, on the island of Flores, in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2021 was 261, in an area of . This parish is the youngest in the municipality, having been de-annexed from the parish of Lajes das Flores in 1919.

== History ==
The first settlements In this region occurred In the zone called Eirinha Velha during the 16th Century. Few historians would refer to the area of Fazenda, until Father José António Camões elaborated on the island&#x27;s; from Ribeira Funda, he would recount: 
:&quot;In about 55 arms-lengths, the river runs to the sea along a cliff called Fazenda...continuing to the south-southeast, In the same bay, is a lowland called Cherne. A short distance from this lowland is a small point called Ponta da Fazenda&quot;. 
Later, Father Camões would note that the zone was occupied by 72 homes, 395 inhabitants in total (198 men to 197 women). He would go on to describe the local industry, noting how the men were &quot;hearty, robust and jovial&quot; and responsible for the production of best roof-tiles on the island.

Albeit only administratively autonomous in 1919, it was religiously independent of Lajes das Flores in 1904. At that time, Senator André de Freitas had unsuccessfully attempted to promote the village to civil parish status. Similarly, and much later, Senator Machado Serpa had a similar idea; on December 9, 1919, organic law 915 was promulgated creating the civil parish of Fazenda. On 10 November 1959, Bishop D. Manuel Afonso de Carvalho established Fazenda as a parochial church congregation with all the rights under Canonical Law.

During the 1940s, a small whaling industry was operated by Fazendense Francisco Nunes Azevedo.

==Geography==
Fazenda is administrative division of Lajes das Flores, and located to the north and northeast of the municipal seat. It extends from the eastern coast where it slopes along a north-northwest to south-southeast orientation to the center of the island. The settlements in this parish area oriented along the Regional Road connecting them to the parishes of Lomba (to the north) and Lajes das Flores (to the south). The parish contains the localities Calvário, Barreira Vermelha, Eiras and Feital.

== Economy ==
Fazenda has been characterized for its fertile soils, and the local population is primarily involved In agriculture and animal husbandry associated with the dairy industry. The parish&#x27;s experience with cooperativism started on 4 April 1919, with the establishment of the &quot;Fructuária de Produção de Lacticínios da Freguesia do Senhor Santo Cristo dos Milagres da Fazenda&quot;, later renamed the &quot;Cooperativa Agrícola Fructuária de Produção de Lacticínios Senhor Santo Cristo&quot; by its founder, Father José Furtado Mota. In 1950, the co-operative&#x27;s constitution was amended (29 November) and elaborated, becoming known As the &quot;Cooperativa Agrícola de Lacticínios do Senhor Santo Cristo, SCARL&quot;, under new directors Fernando Pereira Gomes, Francisco de Freitas Silva and Fernando Gomes Trigueiro. In 1968, the cooperative adapted new technologies and processes to produce a variant on the São Jorge cheese, while reducing the production of its local butter (At its only factory In Ribeirinha). At the time it was considered pioneering, and later duplicated by other dairy producers on the island. Later, In order to secure a greater portion of the export market, along with other branches on the island, the cooperative formed the &quot;União de Cooperativas da Ilha das Flores&quot;.

<doc id="1159051" wikidata="Q122638" url="?curid=1159051" title="Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules">
<text>Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules (AACR) were an international library cataloging standard. First published in 1967 and edited by C. Sumner Spalding, a second edition (AACR2) edited by Michael Gorman and Paul W. Winkler was issued in 1978, with subsequent revisions (AACR2R) appearing in 1988 and 1998; all updates ceased in 2005.

Published jointly by the American Library Association, the Canadian Library Association, and the UK Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals, the rules were designed for the construction of library catalogs and similar bibliographic tools. The rules cover the physical description of library resources, as well as the provision of name and title access points. 

AACR2 was issued in several print versions, including a concise edition and an online version. Various translations were also available. Principles of AACR included cataloguing based on the item &#x27;in hand&#x27; rather than inferring information from external sources and the concept of the &#x27;chief source of information&#x27; which is preferred where conflicts exist.

==Initial adoption==
Despite the claim to be &#x27;Anglo-American&#x27;, the first edition of AACR was published in 1967 in somewhat distinct North American and British texts. The second edition of 1978 unified the two sets of rules (adopting the British spelling &#x27;cataloguing&#x27;) and brought them in line with the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD). Libraries wishing to migrate from the previous North American text were obliged to implement &#x27;desuperimposition&#x27;, a substantial change in the form of headings for corporate bodies.

==Successor==

While the 2002 updates included substantial improvements to AACR&#x27;s treatment of non-book materials, the proliferation of 21st century formats in a networked environment and the rise of electronic publishing signaled the necessity for significant change in the cataloging code. Plans for a third edition (AACR3) were abandoned in 2005.

The international cataloging community turned its attention to drafting a completely new standard to succeed AACR. Informed by the work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), the new framework was crafted to be more flexible and suitable for use in a digital environment: Resource Description and Access (RDA) was released in June 2010. The Library of Congress, National Library of Medicine, National Agricultural Library, and several national libraries of other English-speaking countries performed a formal test of RDA, resulting in a June 2011 report of findings.

The physical description recorded in MARC field 300 illustrates some of the differences in cataloging practice between AACR2 and RDA. For example, many abbreviations, such as &quot;p.&quot; for &quot;pages,&quot; under AACR2 are spelled out under RDA. AACR2&#x27;s General Material Designation (GMD), recorded in subfield h in MARC field 245, was superseded under RDA rules by content, media, and carrier types, recorded in MARC fields 336, 337, and 338. However, some libraries retained GMDs after adopting RDA.

<doc id="1159052" wikidata="Q7744481" url="?curid=1159052" title="King's School, Worcester">
<text>The King&#x27;s School, Worcester is a private co-educational day school refounded by Henry VIII in 1541. It occupies a site adjacent to Worcester Cathedral on the banks of the River Severn in the centre of the city of Worcester. It offers mixed-sex mainstream education that follows the UK National Curriculum to around 1,465 pupils aged 2 to 18. At age 11, approximately two thirds of pupils join the senior school from its two prep schools, King&#x27;s Hawford and King&#x27;s St Albans, while others come from maintained schools in the city of Worcester and the surrounding areas that include Malvern, Redditch, Kidderminster, Evesham and Pershore.

==Campuses==
The King&#x27;s, Worcester group consists of three different schools. These include:

*King&#x27;s Hawford: (ages 2–11, c.320 pupils), formerly an autonomous fee-paying prep school named Hawford Lodge, purchased by King&#x27;s in 1992, situated north of central Worcester. No recommendations were made in the 2008 inspection.
*King&#x27;s St Alban&#x27;s: (ages 2–11, c.215 pupils), formerly the Cathedral Choir School, amalgamated with King&#x27;s in 1943, situated adjacent to the senior school. St Alban&#x27;s includes a pre-prep department for ages 4–7, opened September 2009.
*King&#x27;s Worcester: (ages 11–18, c.930 pupils), the senior school.

The senior school is situated on Worcester&#x27;s College Green, next to Worcester Cathedral and on the east bank of the River Severn. Many of the school&#x27;s buildings on the Green are leased from the cathedral, including College Hall (formerly the monastic refectory, for many years the school&#x27;s only teaching hall, and currently an assembly hall) and Edgar Tower, the medieval gatehouse to College Green, which for many years housed the school library. The school and the cathedral maintain a close relationship, with the school providing cathedral choristers and using the cathedral for major services. The most senior members of school staff, the cathedral choristers, and the school&#x27;s King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s Scholars are &quot;ex officio&quot; members of the cathedral foundation, while the school is required by statute to have the cathedral Dean and Chapter represented on its governing body.

The school owns extensive land next to New Road cricket ground across the river, used as sports pitches and fields. The school also owns an outward bound centre, the &quot;Old Chapel&quot; near Crickhowell in Mid Wales.

==History==

Following the dissolution of the monastery in 1540, the new cathedral foundation included provision for a choir school for ten cathedral choristers and tuition for forty &quot;King&#x27;s Scholars&quot;. The school was one of seven &quot;King&#x27;s Schools&quot; established or re-endowed by Henry VIII following the dissolution. On 7 December 1541, Henry VIII appointed the school&#x27;s first headmaster, John Pether, by means of a letter to Richard Rich. One early headmaster, Henry Bright is mentioned in Thomas Fuller’s Worthies of England, and is commemorated in Worcester Cathedral.

The school was managed by the cathedral Dean and Chapter until 1884, when Headmaster W.E. Bolland&#x27;s &quot;New Scheme&quot; introduced governance by a separate Governing Body, on which the Chapter nonetheless retained a majority. From its inception until the construction of School House in 1888, all teaching was conducted in College Hall, the former monastic refectory.

From 1945 to 1976, the school participated in the direct grant scheme, accepting pupils funded by central government on a competitive basis. The school first admitted girls in small numbers to the sixth form in 1971, prior to the establishment of College House in 1977, which housed 21 girls. In 1989 the decision was made to make the school fully co-educational, with girls entering the Lower Fourth (Year 7) in 1991. Having accommodated boarders since its inception, the final boarders left in July 1999.

==Activities==
The school has an artist-in-residence and actor-in-residence, provides one-to-one LAMDA tuition and has several performance venues, including the Keyes Building, College Hall and the John Moore Theatre. Art exhibitions, plays, musicals, dance showcases and other performances are staged across the age range. Partly due to its links with the cathedral the school has a musical tradition.

The school has achieved success at rowing with the King&#x27;s School Worcester Boat Club, and maintains a boathouse on the River Severn. The school also has an indoor swimming pool on the junior school campus and an outdoor pool at Hawford. Several sports undertake regular tours abroad.

The school has an active Combined Cadet Force with army and RAF sections.

The school produces three pupil-authored publications: &quot;Stepping Fourth&quot; (for the Fourth Forms, years 7–8), &quot;The Removes&#x27; Gazette&quot; (for the Removes, years 9–10) and &quot;Term Time&quot; a Sixth Form magazine, first published in summer 2010, as a replacement for the defunct &quot;King&#x27;s Herald&quot; newspaper. The &quot;King&#x27;s Herald&quot; was an annual newspaper written, compiled and formatted in a single day and submitted to a national competition which it won three times.

==Year classification system==
The school uses its own class nomenclature. In the main section of the school (ages 11–18), the classification runs as follows:

==Houses==
Upon reaching the &#x27;Lower Remove&#x27;, pupils are assigned to one of the following houses (listed with their respective colours):

Castle, Choir, Hostel and School Houses, all former boarding houses, are named for the buildings which originally housed them. As boarding diminished during the 1990s, these houses either converted to day houses (School and Choir), or were discontinued (Castle and Hostel). The remaining houses, which originated as day-boys&#x27; houses, are named for former school headmasters (Saint Oswald and Saint Wulstan, both Bishops of Worcester, being regarded as &quot;headmasters&quot; of the former monastic school).

==Old Vigornians==

All former pupils are considered to be Old Vigornians, and can use the post-nominal letters &quot;OV&quot;. Predecessor institutions are not considered: only those who attended King&#x27;s from its refoundation in 1541 onwards are listed below.

<doc id="1159061" wikidata="Q937312" url="?curid=1159061" title="Military budget">
<text>A military budget (or military expenditure), also known as a defense budget, is the amount of financial resources dedicated by a state to raising and maintaining an armed forces or other methods essential for defense purposes.

==Financing militaries==

Military budgets often reflect how strongly a country perceives the likelihood of threats against it, or the amount of aggression it wishes to conjure. It also gives an idea of how much financing should be provided for the upcoming fiscal year. The size of a budget also reflects the country&#x27;s ability to fund military activities. Factors include the size of that country&#x27;s economy, other financial demands on that entity, and the willingness of that entity&#x27;s government or people to fund such military activity. Generally excluded from military expenditures is spending on internal law enforcement and disabled veteran rehabilitation. The effects of military expenditure on a nation&#x27;s economy and society, and what determines military expenditure, are notable issues in political science and economics. Generally, some suggest military expenditure is a boost to local economies. Still, others maintain military expenditure is a drag on development.

Among the countries maintaining some of the world&#x27;s largest military budgets, China, India, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are frequently recognized to be great powers.

In 2023, the United States spent 3.4% of its GDP on its military, while China 1.7%, Russia 5.9%, France 2.1%, United Kingdom 2.3%, India 2.4%, Israel 5.3%, South Korea 2.8% and Germany spent 1.5% of its GDP on defense.

According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 2023, total world military expenditure amounted to US$2.443 trillion. It increased 6.8 percent over the previous year. With the Russo-Ukrainian War, European expenditures rose by 16 percent.

==Historic expenditure==

The &quot;Saturday Review&quot; magazine in February 1898 outlined the levels of military expenditure as a percentage of &quot;tax revenue&quot; spent by the then great powers for the year 1897:
* United States: 17%. The United States has fluctuated for decades, depending on the conflict of the time. The first spike in defense spending, and in turn taxes, came during the very beginning of the 19th century. During World War I, the United States spent 22% of gross domestic product, while during peacetime, the government spent on as little as 1% Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This changed following World War II as the United States government were experiencing an immense fear of the expansion of communism and therefore heightened security on all fronts. This was supported by Americans as it brought upon them a sense of security and the 3.6% GDP they were contributing to was a large decrease from the whopping amounts of capital being spent during WWII that exceeded 41%, before decreasing to 10% during the Cold War and for about two more decades after, including the Vietnam War, before beginning to decrease in the 1970s down to 6%, then 5.5% in 1979 before beginning to steadily incline once again. After 2001, though, and the September 11 terrorist attacks, defense spending spiked again, peaking at 5.7% in 2010. 
* Russian Empire: 21%
* French Third Republic: 39%
* British Empire: 39%
* German Empire: 43%
* Empire of Japan: 55%

<doc id="1159065" wikidata="Q1753798" url="?curid=1159065" title="Never for Ever">
<text>Never for Ever is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter Kate Bush, released on 8 September 1980 by EMI Records, it was Bush&#x27;s first No. 1 album and was also the first album by a British female solo artist to top the UK Albums Chart, as well as being the first album by any female solo artist to enter the chart at No. 1. It has since been certified Gold by the BPI. It features the UK Top 20 singles &quot;Breathing&quot;, &quot;Army Dreamers&quot; and &quot;Babooshka&quot;, the latter being one of Bush&#x27;s biggest hits. Bush co-produced the album with Jon Kelly.

==Background==
Beginning production after her 1979 tour, &quot;Never for Ever&quot; was Bush&#x27;s second foray into production (her first was for the &quot;On Stage&quot; EP the previous year), aided by the engineer of &quot;Lionheart&quot; (1978), Jon Kelly. Bush was keen to start producing her work and felt that this was the first album she was happy with, since it was more personal.

The first two albums had resulted in a particular sound, which was evident in every track, with lush orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on &quot;Never for Ever&quot; is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker &quot;Violin&quot; to the wistful waltz of hit single &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;. &quot;Never for Ever&quot; was the first Kate Bush album to feature digital synthesizers and drum machines, in particular the Fairlight CMI, which was programmed by Richard James Burgess and John L. Walters. Like her previous two albums, it was initially composed on piano.

Bush&#x27;s literary and cinematic influences were again to the fore. &quot;The Infant Kiss&quot;, the story of a governess who is frightened by the adult feelings she has for her young male charge (who is possessed by the spirit of a grown man), was inspired by the 1961 film &quot;The Innocents&quot;, which in turn had been inspired by &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; by Henry James. &quot;The Wedding List&quot; drew from François Truffaut&#x27;s 1968 film &quot;The Bride Wore Black&quot;. &quot;Delius (Song of Summer)&quot; was inspired by the 1968 Ken Russell television film &quot;Song of Summer&quot;, which portrays the last six years of the life of English composer Frederick Delius, when Eric Fenby acted as his amanuensis. Fenby is mentioned in the lyrics (&quot;in B, Fenby&quot;). &quot;Blow Away (for Bill)&quot; commemorates her lighting director Bill Duffield, killed in an accident at Poole Arts Centre during her 1979 tour. The song links his name to those of several music stars who died in the previous decade—Minnie Riperton, Keith Moon, Sandy Denny, Sid Vicious, Marc Bolan—and one earlier icon, Buddy Holly.

&quot;Never for Ever&quot; is the only studio album by Bush up to &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; (2011) not to have a title track. According to Bush, the title alluded to conflicting emotions, good and bad, which pass, as she stated: &quot;we must tell our hearts that it is &#x27;never for ever&#x27;, and be happy that it&#x27;s like that&quot;.

The album cover is an illustration (in pencil) by artist Nick Price, who had also designed the cover for the programme for her 1979 tour. Bush was pleased with the results (it depicts a multitude of animals and monsters emerging from under her skirt). Of the concept, Bush said that it reflects the title, depicting good and bad things that emerge from one&#x27;s self. The album was released on compact disc in Japan in 1987 with the cover art modified. A section of the original cover art was enlarged, creating two different booklet covers: the outer one modified; and underneath the original. The album&#x27;s cover was voted &#x27;Greatest Album Cover of 1980&#x27; by &quot;Record Mirror&quot;.

&quot;Violin&quot; and &quot;Egypt&quot; were performed live during The Tour of Life in April-May 1979. &quot;The Wedding List&quot; was aired in a BBC &quot;Christmas Special&quot; on 28 December 1979.

==Release and critical reception==
With work on the album completed in May, &quot;Never for Ever&quot; was released on 8 September 1980. Over the following week, Bush undertook a record signing tour of the UK including London, which resulted in lengthy queues down Oxford Street. During October she also undertook promotional appearances for the album throughout Europe, most prominently in Germany and France. In the US, the album was initially unreleased following the failure of her debut. As Bush gained a cult following over the coming years, however, &quot;Never for Ever&quot; was belatedly released in 1984 following the entry into the charts of her fourth album, &quot;The Dreaming&quot;. 

&quot;Never for Ever&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart on (week-ending) 20 September 1980 at No. 1. It remained there for one week, staying in the top 75 for a total of 23 weeks. The album became Bush&#x27;s first record to reach the top position on the UK Albums Chart, also making her the first female British solo artist to achieve that status. Technically, &quot;Never for Ever&quot; is the first &quot;studio&quot; album (i.e. not a greatest hits compilation) by &quot;any&quot; solo female artist to reach number 1 in the UK as only Barbra Streisand and Connie Francis had achieved the feat prior to 1980 but with compilation albums (Diana Ross had also achieved three UK number 1 albums by then but these were also compilations and were credited to Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes, and were therefore not solo albums).

Three singles were released from the album—all of which fared well in the charts. The first, &quot;Breathing&quot;, reached No. 16 in the UK, as did the third, &quot;Army Dreamers&quot;. The second single, &quot;Babooshka&quot;, became one of Bush&#x27;s biggest hits, peaking at No. 5 in the summer of 1980 in the UK and faring even better in Australia, where it reached No. 2 and was the 20th best-selling single of the year.

In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including &quot;Never For Ever&quot;.

The album was favourably received by music critics at the time, save for a curiously critical review in &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, which appears to criticise the album (and Bush herself), while complimenting a number of tracks. Based largely on this album, Bush was voted &quot;Best female artist of 1980&quot; in polls taken in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, &quot;Sounds&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and Capital Radio. Bush herself has said that it was her favourite album to date. More recently, AllMusic gave the album a favourable review, complimenting the three singles most highly but said that Bush would improve on the formula on later albums. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Never for Ever&quot; in their &quot;80 Greatest albums of 1980&quot; list, praising Bush for her songwriting and her imagination.

<text>N. Robin Crossby (May 18, 1954 – July 23, 2008) was the creator of the Hârn fantasy setting and the HârnMaster role-playing game system, as well as dozens of other related works describing the world of Hârn.

==Early life==
N. Robin Crossby was born of Anglo-Welsh parents in 1954 in London, England, the third of four children. His early hobbies included slot car racing, a fascination with dinosaurs and the drawing of fictional maps. His early education took place at William Ellis School in London. The roots of Hârn can probably be traced back to his early role-playing experiments with his brother and sister in the early 1960s, which involved a hand-drawn map and a personal history of the lost continent of Atlantis.

Crossby&#x27;s family emigrated to Canada in 1968, settling in the Vancouver, British Columbia suburb of Coquitlam. He attended Centennial High School. Between 1974 and 1980 Crossby was involved in dozens of projects, only some of which came to fruition. After graduating high school both he and his future wife Sharon went to work assembling circuit boards at Crossby Electronics. This company was owned by his father, Victor Crossby. They did a great deal of GlenAyre Electronics’ contract work during the 1970s and were responsible for the bulk of circuitry installed at the former BC Hydro tower located on Burnaby Mountain. Crossby was employed there until about 1980. He attended Douglas College from 1974 to 1976, graduating with an associate degree in Philosophy.

===College years===
During his tenure at Douglas College he began dabbling in graphic design, creating many logos and posters for various Douglas College clubs under the name Hexagon Graphics. Hexagon was still around decades later, its largest project being a logo design for Maple Ridge-based company Maple Meadows Glass in approximately 1995.

After graduating Douglas College he transferred to Simon Fraser University, where he co-founded SPLUD, the Society for the Protection of Large Unpleasant Dragons. SPLUD was a boardgame club that held meetings in the SFU Rotunda. Some of the games played there were designed earlier by Crossby with names like Power and Resource. After encountering &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, he started on early precursors of &quot;Hârn&quot;.

==Hobbies==
Crossby was similarly attracted to the arts; he was an accomplished guitar player and composer who often performed at family gatherings. He was also an amateur playwright, and between Douglas College and SFU Robin, his future wife Sharon, his sister Sue and their friends operated a small community theatre company called Threshold Theatre out of the James Cowan Theatre in Burnaby.

==Family life==
Not long after arriving in Canada he met his future spouse, Sharon MacLeod, a close friend of his sister Susan. Robin and Sharon had their first child in 1983 (a daughter named Arien) and their second in 1987 (Faya). They were not married until 1987 just barely before the birth of their third daughter, Kiley, in 1988.

==Business and Publishing==
Crossby started detailing his original fantasy world of Kethira in 1977. Near the end of the 1970s, Robin started calling his gaming system &quot;Hârn&quot; and began shopping it with publishers. In 1980, Robin made first contact with the gaming company that would later become Columbia Games

Robin signed his first contract with the Vancouver-based gaming company in 1983. Throughout that year CGI published a series of booklets called the &quot;Encyclopedia Hârnica&quot;, consisting of the history and background of several regions of the island of Hârn. These were followed in the next three years by the Kingdom Modules, a re-release of much of the same material in a more condensed format. Also in the early 1980s, Columbia Games released the &quot;Hârn Regional Module&quot;, which included a massive, full-colour map that attracted many reluctant players to the system. The &quot;Hârn Regional Module&quot; was later rereleased as &quot;HârnWorld&quot;.

==About Harn==
Like many popular role-playing environments of the time, Hârn took place in a quasi-medieval setting, on the world of Kèthîra in what could be described in another reality, but described in detail many factors that other systems often neglected. One section of HârnWorld, for instance, laid out a complex model for generating weather patterns that affected the entire planet. Hârn was unusual at its outset for having no defined system to support the story – many early players used Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules systems or RuneQuest models to actually play Hârn campaigns. It wasn&#x27;t until 1986 that Columbia Games released Hârn&#x27;s companion rule system, HârnMaster I, which was a leap forward in RPG design in that it calculated the probabilities of various battle, exploration and magic scenarios in a far greater degree of detail than any existing system of the time. The level of detail involved in both modules and statistics made it intimidating for more faint-hearted players. Hârn meta-material was available in the form of CGI&#x27;s HârnQuest Magazine, released four times annually, which is still published today. At one time Hârn fandom also had a thriving mailing list called HârnLine, also known as the Duffleboard for its moderator Rob Duff.

In 1996 CGI came out with HârnMaster Core (known colloquially as HârnMaster II), printed in full-colour on cardstock in a binder that theoretically allowed the system to expand with future modules. The modules included in the new HârnMaster Core series were also printed with the more popular D20 statistics, a different points system that simplified Hârn&#x27;s extremely detailed points system and brought out resentment in veteran Hârn players who preferred the HârnMaster I rules. CGI argued that this would bring in a new generation of players, but Hârn fandom has boasted about the same number of players since approximately 1990. HârnMaster II also retailed for nearly US$50, which for the time was extremely expensive.

Columbia Games moved to Washington state, and Crossby stopped writing new material for the company in 1994; fans began more and more to add expansions they created (called &quot;fanon&quot;) as no more official material was being produced for the setting, and Crossby also began working on his own version of Hârn.

===International Publishing and Conflict with Columbia Games===
In 1998, Robin and CGI were contacted by Auran Games, an Australian video game company interested in developing a Hârnic Internet role-playing game. Robin signed his second contract with CGI that same year. Over the next three years Auran paid for four trips to Australia including one where he was accompanied by his wife, as well as a business associate Tom Dalgliesh and his wife Penny. But tensions had been rising between Robin and Columbia Games, which had moved to Washington state for tax purposes in 1999. Robin had grown unhappy with the direction being taken with the Hârn product line and had begun self-publishing his own modules under the name Kelestia Productions in 1997. These modules and rulebooks diverged from CGI&#x27;s releases as of the HârnMaster I series. Robin released both digital products in PDF format through Hyperbooks.com and print products which were produced in Burnaby and shipped in large volume from his home with the help of his eldest daughter Arien. During this period he published nearly half a dozen products, including his own extension of the basic rules called HârnMaster Gold. HMG was not only a new version of the Hârn universe, but a guide to campaigning with the Hârn world in any gaming system without compromising on the level of detail.

CGI and Robin worked together alongside Auran until 2000 when the Auran project was cancelled by Electronics Arts, the games proposed publisher, before it was fully completed. It was one of a number of games cancelled by Electronic Arts at the time due to budget cutbacks. Over the next three years there arose more conflicts between Robin and CGI over licensing and unpaid royalties, which led to Robin formally dissolving his contract with Columbia Games in 2003. Columbia games continued to produce Hârn products in defiance of the contract dissolution up until Crossby&#x27;s death and beyond.

The present-day Kelestia Productions website was founded in approximately 2006 and began selling digital copies of modules under the name Hârn Canon, to differentiate it from the products still being sold by Columbia Games. These modules were created not only by Robin but by his fans; by this period Robin was actively encouraging the input of his fanbase to create new material. The Chélemby City (publication title: Chélemby: City of the Sea Kings) module was produced as a group effort between Robin and many contributors and fans, including his long-time friend Rob Duff. Kelestia Productions was incorporated in October 2008, and since his death in July 2008, the company has published modules and products under the guidance of his heirs and estate-appointed project heads Jeremy Baker (a New Zealander) and Ken Snellings (an American).

Though the dispute between Kelestia Productions and Columbia Games has never been completely resolved, Kelestia Productions has done business selling electronic-format modules since about 2006. After Robin&#x27;s death in 2008 his intellectual property rights passed on to his eldest daughter Arien. The trademark for the name “Hârn” was formally granted to Arien Crossby by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office in September 2009, and Kelestia Productions is not currently pursuing the American trademark, but continues to produce module content and other products independently.

==Later life and death==
In early 2006, Robin was diagnosed with liposarcoma of the bowel, a cancer arising in fat cells. Throughout his illness he continued his work, and the last map completed by Crossby was a map of the entire Harnic world. Many also applauded Crossby for keeping a sharp and witty blog on the Kelestia website during the course of his illness. Despite surgery and chemotherapy, he died two years later on July 23, 2008, in a hospice in Port Coquitlam, British Columbia.

<text>City Hall MRT station is an underground Singapore Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North–South line (NSL) and East–West line (EWL). Situated in the Downtown Core district, it is underneath Stamford Road near the road junctions with North Bridge Road and St Andrew&#x27;s Road. The station is near landmarks such as the former City Hall, Raffles City, the Padang, St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral and the Cenotaph.

Initially named St Andrew&#x27;s MRT station, the station was included in the early plans for the original MRT network in 1982. Construction of the tunnels between the City Hall and stations required the draining of the Singapore River. The station opened on 12 December 1987 as part of the MRT extension to Outram Park station. Cross-platform transfers between the NSL and EWL began on 28 October 1989, ahead of the opening of the MRT eastern line extension to Tanah Merah station on 4 November which split the MRT network into two lines. A designated Civil Defence shelter, the three-level station features a mural by Simon Wong which depicts government buildings in the area.

==History==
===Planning===

The station, then named St Andrew&#x27;s, was included in the early plans of the MRT network in May 1982. It was renamed to City Hall in November that year for historical reasons and to better reflect the area served. It was to be constructed as part of the Phase I MRT segment from the Novena to Outram Park stations; this segment was targeted to be completed by December 1987. This segment was given priority as it passes through areas that had a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio and the Central Area. The line aimed to relieve the traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang road corridor.

===Construction===
The contract for the construction of four tunnels between the City Hall and Raffles Place stations was awarded to a joint venture between Kajima Corporation and Keppel Shipyard in October 1983 for S$35.65 million (US$ million in ). Another contract for the construction of the station was awarded to a joint venture between Nishimatsu and Lum Chang at S$77.65 million (US$ million in ) in May 1984. Construction of the station began on 7 September 1984 with a Christian ceremony near the St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral. The gathering prayed for the safety of the cathedral and the construction workers, the successful completion of the station, and blessings for future commuters.

The construction of tunnels between the City Hall and Raffles Place stations required the draining of the Singapore River. The contractor used the cut-and-cover construction method since the tunnels, which cross over one another, would pass through a shallow part of the river. The tunnel boring machine was launched from Empress Place located by the river bank. Due to the acidity of the Singapore River, a layer of concrete was added to the frame around the tunnels, with a waterproofing additive for the base slab concrete. The frame was designed to prevent any corrosion and floatation of the tunnels.

Due to requirements by the Ministry of Environment ensuring that the work site did not occupy more than 40% of the river width, the work was originally planned to proceed in three stages. The cofferdam in the first stage occupied about of the river width from the riverbank at the Immigration Building site of Empress Place. However, this restriction led to a limited work area. The installation of piles was hindered by the boulders in the river, which were drilled through. The works were close to the historical monuments of the Immigration Building and the Cavenagh Bridge. These two sites had to be closely monitored for any ground movement. Monitoring instruments such as inclinometers and levelling pins were used to detect any structural movement.

There were concerns that the Cavenagh Bridge would not be able to absorb any significant strains with the settlement of the bridge&#x27;s anchor blocks. Saddles, joined by prestressing cables, were placed on either side of the bridge to unload and loosen the links and bridge wedges. However, these wedges could not be loosened. Instead, other temporary supports were placed to relieve any stress on the bridge. After finding some cracks on the entrance façade of the Immigration Building, the contractors underpinned the columns at the entrance.

Construction work at the Empress Place and City Hall construction sites uncovered fragmented pieces of Celadon pottery dating back to the Song and Yuan dynasties of China. Another stoneware jar, which retained its original bronze glaze but was missing its handles, was also uncovered at the Empress Place site. The artefacts were donated to the National Museum of Singapore.

After a seven-month delay, the first stage of the construction was completed in May 1985. To speed up the construction, the Environment Ministry agreed to lift workspace restrictions. The rest of the construction was completed in one stage, taking up the remaining of the river width. The subsequent stage also used fewer piles with the mixed use of cut slopes. Installation of the second stage cofferdam began in May and works were completed within 12 months.

====Incidents====
During the station&#x27;s construction, on 26 May 1985, the collapse of a portion of the supporting wall led to a landslip at the construction site. Those in the nearby St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral were evacuated as a safety precaution. The cathedral was eventually declared safe for use, and operations resumed on 2 June with the collapsed area backfilled. The engineers for the construction advised the Cathedral against using half of the church near the site. On 10 December, a Japanese foreman miner died, having fallen through a shaft. Investigators noted that he did not have his safety belt fastened, and with all other safety measures observed, it was ruled an accident.

===Opening and additional exits===

Train services commenced on 12 December 1987 when the line extension to Outram Park station was completed. The station was part of a route that ran continuously from Yishun station in the north to Lakeside station in the west. From 28 October 1989, it serves as the interchange station for both the East–West (EWL) and North–South (NSL) lines with the split of MRT operations. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew held an official inauguration ceremony for the MRT system at Raffles City on 12 March 1988 before he took a train ride from this station to Queenstown station.

The LTA announced plans in May 2014 to construct a new underpass between the station and the redeveloped Capitol Singapore. Construction of the underground link and the new entrance started in the fourth quarter of 2014, and was completed in the first quarter of 2015. Another linkway to Funan Centre was first announced in November 2017 and was completed in December 2021.

==Station details==

City Hall station is one of two stations which are paired cross-platform interchanges between the NSL and EWL. From the north, the station is after Bugis on the EWL and after Dhoby Ghaut station on the NSL. Both lines continue and interchange at Raffles Place station. The official station code is NS25/EW13. When it opened, it had the station code of C2 before being changed to its current station code in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System. Before the MRT eastern extension to Tanah Merah station and the Marina Bay southern extension on 4 November 1989, through services operated from the Yishun to Lakeside stations. A few days before the MRT extension, transfer drills were launched on 28 October for commuters to familiarise themselves with transferring between the two services – passengers from Yishun have to alight at either Raffles Place or City Hall to continue their journey to Lakeside or vice versa. In addition to advertisement campaigns and guides about the transfers, Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) staff were deployed at the platforms to help commuters.

At a depth of , the station has three levels, two of which are island platforms. The station has one of the MRT system&#x27;s longest escalators at . City Hall is one of the first nine underground MRT stations designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter. As a CD shelter, the station has to be structurally reinforced against bomb attacks with layers of earth-backed, air-backed and airtight walls and slabs. 

A mural by Simon Wong is displayed at this station as part of the MRTC&#x27;s S$2 million (US$ million in ) commission of artworks at six MRT stations along the NSL in 1987. The mural, depicting government buildings in the area, reflects the station&#x27;s themes of governance, justice and administration. Another mural by Kelvin Lee is displayed as part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect – a public art showcase of heritage-themed murals. The work depicts former and existing landmarks of Singapore&#x27;s Civil District, including the Old Raffles Institution Building, the Old National Library Building, CHIJMES and the Capitol Theatre.

The station has four entrances. Located in the Singapore Civic District, the station is underneath Stamford Road near the junction with North Bridge Road. Surrounding the station are cultural landmarks such as the former City Hall, Peranakan Museum, the Padang, St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, National Gallery Singapore, Old Supreme Court Building, Supreme Court of Singapore, Parliament House and the Cenotaph. Nearby commercial and retail developments include Marina Square, One Raffles Link, Raffles City and Suntec City. The station is within walking distance of the Esplanade and Bras Basah stations on the Circle line.

<doc id="1159074" wikidata="Q464011" url="?curid=1159074" title="Leonor Fini">
<text>Leonor Fini (30 August 1907 – 18 January 1996) was an Argentine-Italian surrealist painter, designer, illustrator, and author, known for her depictions of powerful and erotic women.

== Early life ==
Fini was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Malvina Braun Dubich (born in Trieste, with German, Slavic and Venetian ancestry) and Herminio Fini (with ancestry from Benevento, Italy). Herminio was a handsome and very wealthy man, but also tyrannical with extreme religious views. Within 18 months of Leonor&#x27;s birth, Malvina fled back to Trieste with the child. Leonor was raised there and was expelled from various schools for being rebellious. As a Catholic, Herminio refused to give Malvina a divorce, which was only granted to her in 1919 through an Italian court. Custody battles often forced Fini and her mother to take sudden flight and wear disguises. In her early teens, an eye disease forced Fini to wear bandages on both eyes. After recovering, she decided to become an artist.

She moved to Milan at the age of 17 and a gallery in Trieste exhibited one of her paintings that year. She thereafter received a commission to paint portraits from dignitaries in Milan where she had her first one-woman show at the Galerie Barbaroux in 1929. She moved to Paris in 1931 when she was 24. There, she became acquainted with Carlo Carrà and Giorgio de Chirico, whose metaphysical style of art influenced much of her work. She also came to know Paul Éluard, Max Ernst, Georges Bataille, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Picasso, André Pieyre de Mandiargues, and Salvador Dalí. Fini traveled Europe by car with Mandiargues and Cartier-Bresson where Cartier-Bresson took a photograph, one of his best known, of her naked in a pool with a shaved pubis. The photograph of Fini sold in 2007 for $305,000 – the highest price paid at auction for one of Cartier-Bresson&#x27;s works to that date.

== Career ==
Fini had no formal artistic training, but grew up surrounded by the Renaissance and Mannerist styles of Italy.

Her first major exhibition was in 1936 at New York&#x27;s Julian Levy Gallery. Though Fini is part of the pre-war generation of Parisian artists often overlooked in favour of male contemporaries, she was very important in the Surrealist movement. Fini never officially joined the movement, but she did show her work alongside Surrealist artists. She was included in Peggy Guggenheim&#x27;s 1943 show &quot;Exhibition by 31 Women&quot; at the Art of This Century gallery in New York.

Fini worked for Elsa Schiaparelli in the late thirties and early forties and designed the bottle for the perfume &quot;Shocking&quot;, basing the shape on Mae West&#x27;s torso. Fini networked into theatre circles when she started taking on costume design projects in the 1930s as a source of extra income. She also illustrated books and some of her best-known works in this area are her drawings for a 1944 edition of the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s &quot;Juliette.&#x27; Between 1944 and 1972, Fini’s main work was in costume design for film, theatre, ballet and opera including, famously, the first ballet performed by Roland Petit&#x27;s Ballet de Paris, &quot;Les Demoiselles de la nuit&quot;, featuring a young Margot Fonteyn in 1948. In 1949, Frederick Ashton choreographed a ballet she had conceptualized, &quot;Le Rêve de Leonor&quot; (&quot;Leonor&#x27;s Dream&quot;), with music by Benjamin Britten, and Fini designed the hybrid human-animal costumes for it as well. In 1959, Fini made a fairy tale-inspired painting called &quot;Les Sorcières&quot; for the Mexican actress, María Félix. She also designed the costumes for two films: Renato Castellani&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1954) and John Huston&#x27;s &quot;A Walk with Love and Death&quot; (1968). In London, she exhibited paintings at the Kaplan gallery in 1960 and at the Hanover Gallery in 1967. A 1986 retrospective at the Musée du Luxembourg in Paris featured over 260 of her works in a variety of media including watercolours and drawings, theatre/costume designs, paintings and masks. In the 1970s, she wrote three novels: &quot;Rogomelec&quot;, &quot;Moumour; Contes pour enfants velu&quot; and &quot;Oneiropompe&quot;. Many of Fini&#x27;s paintings featured women in positions of power or in very sexualised contexts. Madonna used the imagery of one of the exhibits, &quot;Le Bout du Monde,&quot; in her video, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; in 1994. In the spring of 1987, Fini had an exhibition at London&#x27;s Editions Graphique&#x27;s gallery. The San Francisco Modern Museum of Art also featured her work in an exhibition entitled &quot;Women, Surrealism, and Self-representation&quot; in 1999.

Fini&#x27;s work often included sphinxes, werewolves, and witches. Most of the characters in her art were female or androgynous.

She painted portraits of Jean Genet, Anna Magnani, Jacques Audiberti, Alida Valli, Jean Schlumberger and Suzanne Flon as well as many other celebrities and wealthy visitors to Paris. Her friends included Jean Cocteau, Giorgio de Chirico, and Alberto Moravia, Fabrizio Clerici and most of the other artists and writers inhabiting or visiting Paris.

Fini illustrated about 50 books, including &quot;Satyricon&quot; and works by Jean Genet and Charles Baudelaire. She illustrated many works of classic authors and poets, including Edgar Allan Poe, Charles Baudelaire and Shakespeare, as well as texts by new writers. Leonor Fini illustrated books by Lise Deharme, including &quot;Le Poids d’un oiseau&quot; in 1955 and &quot;Oh! Violette ou la Politesse des Végétaux&quot; in 1969. She was very generous with her illustrations and donated many drawings to writers to help them get published. She is, perhaps, best known for her graphic illustrations for the sexually explicit &quot;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Fini was openly bisexual and lived in a long-term polyamorous relationship. She told Whitney Chadwick in 1982: &quot;I am a woman, therefore I have had the &#x27;feminine experience&#x27;, but I am not a lesbian&quot;. She also said: &quot;Marriage never appealed to me, I&#x27;ve never lived with one person. Since I was 18, I&#x27;ve always preferred to live in a sort of community – a big house with my atelier and cats and friends, one with a man who was rather a lover and another who was rather a friend. And it has always worked.&quot;

Fini married once, for a brief period, to Federico Veneziani. They were divorced after she met the Italian count Stanislao Lepri, who abandoned his diplomatic career shortly after meeting Fini and lived with her thereafter. She met the Polish writer Konstanty Jeleński, known as Kot in Rome in January 1952. She was delighted to discover that he was the illegitimate half-brother of , who had been one of her favorite lovers. Kot joined Fini and Lepri in their Paris apartment in October 1952 and the three remained inseparable until their deaths. She later employed an assistant to join the household, which he described as &quot;a little bit of prison and a lot of theatre&quot;. One of his jobs was to look after her beloved Persian cats. Over the years she acquired as many as 23 of them; they shared her bed and were allowed to roam the dining-table at mealtimes. The &#x27;inner circle&#x27; expanded to include the American artist, and the Argentine poet Juan-Bautista Pinero, up to reaching the Italian artist .

<text>Raffles Place MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North–South Line (NSL) and East–West Line (EWL) in Singapore. Located in the Downtown Core, the station is underneath Raffles Place south of the Singapore River. The station serves various landmarks including The Fullerton Hotel, Merlion Park and the Asian Civilisations Museum and various commercial buildings such as One Raffles Place and OCBC Centre.

Initially named Central MRT station, the station was included in the early plans for the original MRT network in 1982. Construction of the tunnels between the City Hall and Raffles Place stations required the draining of the Singapore River. The station opened on 12 December 1987 with the MRT extension to Outram Park station. Like the adjacent City Hall station, cross-platform transfers between the NSL and EWL began on 28 October 1989, ahead of the split of the MRT network into two lines on 4 November.

The station has ten entrances, three of which adopt colonial-style facades. Three artworks are displayed at the station: two murals by Lim Sew Yong and Thang Kiang How depict scenes of Singapore&#x27;s history, while Aw Tee Hong&#x27;s sculpture draws inspiration from Chinese junks.

==History==
The station, then named Central, was included in the early plans of the MRT network in May 1982. It was renamed Raffles Place in November that year as the business district it serves would be called as such. Raffles Place station was constructed as part of the Phase I MRT segment from the Novena to Outram Park stations, which was scheduled to be completed by December 1987. Phase I was prioritised as it passes through areas that had a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio and the Central Area. The line aimed to relieve the traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang road corridor.

Train services commenced on 12 December 1987 when the line extension to Outram Park station was completed. The station was part of a route that ran continuously from Yishun station in the north to Lakeside station in the west. From 28 October 1989, it serves as the interchange station for both the East–West (EWL) and North–South (NSL) lines with the split of MRT operations.

===Station construction===
The contract for the construction of the station was awarded to a joint venture comprising Taisei Corporation, Shimizu Corporation, and Marubeni for S$70.723million (US$ million in 2021) in May 1984. Construction of the station began on 28 May. With a short construction schedule, the various stages of construction had to be overlapped. This required coordination between various subcontractors while overcoming space constraints at the site as the station was built right in the city centre. The buildings of the Standard Chartered Bank and the Indian Overseas Bank had to be demolished as well as an underground carpark. During the diversion of utilities at the site, the contractors used the utilities departments&#x27; records to determine their location; they were found to be inaccurate and outdated during surveying.

The soil at the site consisted of silty clay in between sandstone with boulders of varying sizes. With the high-rise buildings in the area, it was difficult to determine suitable locations for the installation of temporary ground support systems (including the piles and working deck). About 450 piles were installed in pre-bored holes that supported the station&#x27;s temporary work deck covering 40% of the site. The piles installation via rock augers penetrating into boulders was reinforced by using a &quot;down-the-hole&quot; (DTH) percussion machine.

Before the piles were installed, grout was injected via a central tube in the rock auger to stabilise the soil. Due to the instability of the rock auger when drilling into the boulders, the size of the drilling holes had to be minimised as much as possible. The DTH machine pre-bored the holes before allowing the augers to drill into the ground; this slowed down drilling rates. As the DTH machine was intended to drill in only hard ground, it became bogged in wet weather because it was unable to discharge the drill cuttings (mud slurry). An air lift and a tremie pipe at the bottom of the drilling hole were used to remove the mud slurry. During the station&#x27;s excavation, the boulders were broken apart through treatment with a cracking agent, hydraulic rock splitters or giant breakers. Some boulders were removed via explosives; this was used with caution due to the surrounding buildings.

In conjunction with the station&#x27;s opening, private developers constructed newer buildings that re-established Raffles Place area as a financial hub. The presence of the MRT station near these buildings also created additional convenience for corporations and banks operating in the area.

===Construction of tunnels===

The contract for the construction of four tunnels between the City Hall and Raffles Place stations was awarded to a joint venture between Kajima Corporation and Keppel Shipyard in October 1983 for S$35.65million (US$million in 2021). Another contract for the construction of tunnels between the Maxwell (now Tanjong Pagar) and Raffles Place stations was awarded to a joint Japanese consortium including Taisei, Shimizu, and Marubeni in December that year. The S$63.388million (US$million in 2021) contract included the construction of the adjacent Maxwell station.

The tunnel route to Tanjong Pagar station goes along Robinson Road. Cement grouting was used to strengthen the soil along the road so that the buildings above ground remained unaffected by the works underneath. Ground treatment of the soil began on 28 May 1984 and was completed by April the following year.

The construction of tunnels between the City Hall and Raffles Place stations required the draining of the Singapore River. The contractor used the cut-and-cover construction method since the tunnels, which cross over one another, would pass through a shallow part of the river. The tunnel boring machine was launched from the Empress Place building located by the river bank. Due to the acidity of the Singapore River, a layer of concrete was added to the frame around the tunnels, with a waterproofing additive for the base slab concrete. The frame was designed to prevent any corrosion and floatation of the tunnels.

As the Ministry of Environment required that the work site did not occupy more than 40% of the river width, the work was originally planned to proceed in three stages. The cofferdam in the first stage occupied about of the river width from the riverbank at the Immigration Building site of the Empress Place. However, this restriction led to a limited work area. The installation of piles was hindered by the boulders in the river, which had to be drilled through. The works were close to the historical monuments of the Immigration Building and the Cavenagh Bridge. These two sites was closely monitored for any ground movement. Monitoring instruments such as inclinometers and levelling pins were used to detect any structural movement.

There were concerns that the Cavenagh Bridge would not be able to absorb any significant strains with the settlement of the bridge&#x27;s anchor blocks. Saddles, joined by prestressing cables, were placed on either side of the bridge to unload and loosen the links and bridge wedges. However, these wedges could not be loosened. Instead, other temporary supports were placed to relieve any stress on the bridge. After finding some cracks on the entrance façade of the Immigration Building, the contractors underpinned the columns at the entrance.

After a seven-month delay, the first stage of the construction was completed in May 1985. To speed up the construction, the Environment Ministry agreed to lift workspace restrictions. The rest of the construction was completed in one stage, taking up the remaining of the river width. The subsequent stage also used fewer piles with the mixed use of cut slopes. Installation of the second stage cofferdam began in May and works were completed within 12 months.

==Station details==

Raffles Place station is one of two stations which are paired cross-platform interchanges between the NSL and EWL. From the north, the station is after City Hall station. To the south, both lines diverge from this station, with the NSL going towards Marina Bay station while the EWL goes towards Tanjong Pagar station. The official station code is NS26/EW14. When it opened, it had the station code of C1 before being changed to its current station code in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System. It is within walking distance to the Downtown and Telok Ayer stations on the Downtown Line.

Like the adjacent City Hall station, Raffles Place has two platform levels to facilitate its role as an interchange between the NSL and EWL. Before the MRT eastern extension to Tanah Merah station and the Marina Bay southern extension on 4 November 1989, through services operated from the Yishun to Lakeside stations. A few days before the opening of the MRT extension, transfer drills were launched on 28 October for commuters to familiarise themselves with transferring between the two services – passengers from Yishun have to alight at either Raffles Place or City Hall to continue their journey to Lakeside or vice versa. In addition to advertisement campaigns and guides about the transfers, Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) staff were deployed at the platforms to help commuters.

With an additional shopping floor, the station has a total of four basement levels. Raffles Place is one of the first nine underground MRT stations designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter. As a CD shelter, the station has to be structurally reinforced against bomb attacks with layers of earth-backed, air-backed and airtight walls and slabs. Raffles Place station has ten entrances; Three of the entrances&#x27; facades are inspired by various colonial-style buildings that once existed in the area, such as the John Little department store building and the old Mercantile Bank. These entrances serve various landmarks and commercial developments in the area including Raffles Place Park, Merlion Park, Asian Civilisations Museum, Telok Ayer Market, The Fullerton Hotel, One Raffles Place, Prudential Tower, OCBC Centre, SGX Centre and Raffles Quay.

Two murals by Lim Sew Yong and Thang Kiang How are displayed at the station, as part of the MRTC&#x27;s S$2million (US$million in 2021) commission of artworks at six MRT stations along the NSL. These murals on vitreous enamel panels depict scenes of Singapore&#x27;s history. A brass sculpture, &quot;Struggle for Survival&quot; by Aw Tee Hong, is displayed outside the station. The sculpture takes inspiration from the Chinese junks and the &quot;perahu&quot;, linked to people&#x27;s livelihoods of Singapore&#x27;s past. The artist felt the ships best reflected Singapore&#x27;s pioneering spirit through the hardship the early immigrants faced and decided to incorporate the shapes into the work.

<text>Jurong East MRT station is an elevated Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North–South (NSL) and East–West (EWL) lines in Jurong East, Singapore. Situated along Jurong Gateway Road, the station is located within the vicinity of Jem, Westgate, IMM, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Jurong East Bus Interchange and Jurong Town Hall Bus Interchange. The station is operated by SMRT Trains.

The station opened on 5 November 1988 as part of the MRT extension to Lakeside. The station was the terminus of the Branch line which later merged into the NSL. Through the Jurong East Modification Project, an additional track and platform were built in 2011 to improve train frequencies on the NSL. In May 2018, it was announced that the station would be an interchange with the Jurong Region Line (JRL) when the second stage opens in 2028. The station is planned to be integrated into the Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub – an integrated civic, retail and commercial complex.

==History==
===North–South and East–West lines===

The station, initially named Jurong Town, was announced in October 1983 to be built as part of Phase II of the initial MRT system. Initially expected to be completed by 1992, the completion date of Phase II was pushed earlier to 1990. The station would be part of the Phase II MRT segment from Clementi to Lakeside.

The contract for the construction of Jurong station was awarded to a joint venture between Jurong Engineering and JDC Corporation in October 1985. The S$79.58 million contract (US$ million in ) also included the construction of of viaducts and the Ulu Pandan Depot. In November that year, the contract for the construction of viaducts from this station to Lakeside was awarded to a joint venture between Aoki Corporation and Lim Kah Ngam Construction for S$64.75 million (US$ million in ). The contract included the construction of the Chinese Garden and Lakeside stations. In 1988, Communications Minister Yeo Ning Hong proposed allowing people to set up discos in the station to increase the station&#x27;s vibrancy.

Jurong Town station was renamed to Jurong in September 1984, and to Jurong East in March 1987. As announced by MRT Corporation chairman Michael Fam on 10 March 1988, Jurong East station opened on 5 November that year. An opening ceremony was held at the station to inaugurate the MRT extension to Lakeside station, attended by Yeo and Members of Parliament of the surrounding constituencies.

The station was the terminus for train services to Choa Chu Kang station when the Branch line opened on 10 March 1990. The Branch line was later incorporated into the North–South Line (NSL) with the Woodlands Extension on 10 February 1996.

===Jurong East Modification Project and other upgrades===

In July 2008, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced the Jurong East Modification Project (JEMP), which involved the construction of a new platform and tracks to increase train frequency for the NSL. At the time, NSL trains could only terminate at the middle platform of the station. The contract for the construction of the new platform and viaducts was awarded to Sato Kagyo Pte Ltd in September 2008. 

Originally projected to be completed in 2012, Transport Minister Raymond Lim announced on 12 February 2009 that the completion date of the JEMP was brought forward by a year to 2011. To facilitate turnout installation works, train services between Jurong East and Clementi were suspended from 4 to 5 September 2010 and subsequently between Jurong East and Bukit Batok from 18 to 19 September.

As announced on 16 May 2011, operations of the new platform commenced on 27 May that year. The new platform initially operated only during weekday morning peak hours, but from 27 December, it also began operating during weekday evening peak hours.

On 25 January 2008, Minister Lim announced the installation of half-height platform screen doors on elevated stations to improve safety on elevated stations. Jurong East station was among the first stations to have the screen doors installed as part of the pilot project carried out in 2009. High-volume low-speed fans were installed at the station between 2012 and 2013. Noise barriers were installed along the viaduct stretch from Jurong East Central to Jurong East Street 13 as part of a S$17 million (US$ million) contract awarded to CKT Thomas Pte Ltd in January 2015. Another set of noise barriers from Boon Lay Way to Jurong East Avenue 1 were installed from 2018 to 2020.

As part of a joint emergency preparedness exercise by the LTA and train operator SMRT trains, security screenings were held at this station on 5 April 2019. Metal detectors and X-ray machines were deployed for the screening of commuters and their belongings during the exercise. Such exercises were conducted to test established response protocols and maintain vigilance for quicker and more effective responses during emergencies and heightened security situations. The exercise saw the first deployment of the Human Security Radar – a fully automatic walk-through system with the ability to screen through a crowd for suspicious items.

===Jurong Region Line===

As part of feasibility studies in the 1990s for building future LRT lines in Singapore, the LTA considered building an LRT system in the Jurong area. While the Jurong Region Line (JRL) was first announced on 23 October 2001, the project was put on hold. The JRL was included as part of the 2013 Land Transport Masterplan announced by transport minister Lui Tuck Yew in January that year.

On 9 May 2018, the LTA announced that Jurong East station would interchange with the proposed JRL. The JRL station would be constructed as part of Phase 2 (JRL East), a branch line consisting of seven stations branching from Tengah to Pandan Reservoir. Phase 2 was expected to be completed in 2027. However, the restrictions on construction due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to delays, with the completion date pushed to 2028.

The contract for the design and construction of Jurong East JRL station and associated viaducts was awarded to Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd for S$197.4 million (US$ million) in February 2020. In addition, the contract for the construction of the Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub was awarded to China Communications Construction Company Limited (Singapore Branch) for S$447.4 million (US$ million) in February 2021.

To facilitate the construction of the JRL station, the Jurong East Bus Interchange was relocated on 6 December 2020 to a new site along Jurong Gateway Road. A sheltered pedestrian bridge was built to connect the MRT station to the temporary bus interchange, which was to operate until the completion of the Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub in 2027. A temporary protection enclosure was installed over the NSL and EWL tracks to prevent debris from falling on the tracks during construction works. To control the movements of the MRT viaduct superstructure and transfer loads to the columns and piles, the existing bearings at the viaducts were replaced.

The Hub Plaza of Jurong East station had to be reconstructed. The escalator and staircase leading to the Hub Plaza were closed on 18 December 2022 with new temporary linkways constructed to connect to Exit A of the station. A defunct coin lift, which was used to transport coins for the old Transitlink ticketing system, had to be demolished for a new staircase.

==Details==

Jurong East station is an interchange station on the North–South (NSL) and East–West (EWL) lines. The station is the terminus of the NSL with the adjacent station being Bukit Batok station. On the EWL, the station is between the Clementi and Chinese Gardens stations. The official station code is NS1/EW24. When it opened, it had the station code of W9 before it was changed to its current station code in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System. Being part of the NSL and EWL, the station is operated by SMRT Trains. Jurong East station is planned to be a future interchange with the JRL located between the and stations.

The station is located along Jurong Gateway Road near the junction with Venture Avenue. Surrounding landmarks of the station include Jurong East Bus Interchange, Jem, Westgate, IMM, the JTC Summit, Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, CPF Jurong Building and Jurong Regional Library, which are connected to the station via J-Walk, an elevated pedestrian network. Jurong East station is also near the Jurong Town Hall Bus Interchange. The station is planned to be integrated with the Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub, which will include the new offices of the Ministry of Transport and the LTA, community and civic institutions, an office tower and a bus interchange.

Jurong East station was designed by Scott Danielson of Parsons Brinckerhoff, who took inspiration from the adjacent Jurong East Bus Interchange and designed the space-frame roof of the station – a geometric pattern of cylindrical steel tubes connected by ball joints and topped with a flat lid. The new platform and tracks of the JEMP were integrated into the station design. Jurong East is a three-level station with three island platforms and four tracks. When the Jurong East Integrated Transport Hub designed by Aedas is completed, a link bridge over the tracks will connect the two buildings flanking the station. The JRL station will have a stacked platform configuration.

As part of SMRT&#x27;s heritage-themed artwork showcase &quot;Comic Connect&quot;, the station features &quot;A Journey Through Jurong East&quot; by students from the School of the Arts. The mural showcases the Jurong Bird Park, Jurong Town hall, Jurong River, and the Jurong Drive-in Cinema. In order to create the mural, the students researched the area&#x27;s history, ecology, and culture.

<text>Outram Park MRT station ( ) is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station in Singapore. The station is on the East–West, North East and Thomson–East Coast lines, and is located near the junction of Outram Road, Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road on the boundary of Bukit Merah and Outram planning areas. It is the closest MRT station to Singapore General Hospital, the Police Cantonment Complex, Outram Community Hospital and the Health Promotion Board. The station was included in the early plans of the MRT network in 1982; it was constructed as part of the Phase I MRT segment from Novena, and was completed in December 1987.

Before the line was planned to be extended to the World Trade Center, the station was originally the terminus of the North-East line. When the Thomson–East Coast Line opened on 13 November 2022, Outram Park station became a triple-line interchange.

==History==

===Construction and East–West Line===
Outram Park station was included in early plans of the MRT network in May 1982. It was to be constructed as part of the Phase I MRT segment from Novena station, due to be completed by December 1987; The segment was given priority because it transits areas with a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio, and the Central Area. The line was intended to relieve traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang Road corridor. 

The contract for the construction of Outram Park station and of tunnels between the Tiong Bahru and Maxwell (now Tanjong Pagar) stations was awarded to a Japanese joint venture Ohbayashi-Gumi/Okumura Corporation in November 1983 at a cost of S$73.85 million (US$95 million in 2020).

During the station&#x27;s construction, Outram Primary School was relocated. The tunnel from Outram Park to Tiong Bahru was expected to be completed in September 1984.

Train services commenced on 12 December 1987, when the line extension to the station was officially completed. The station was part of a line service that continuously ran from Yishun station in the north to Lakeside station in the west. From 28 October 1989, Outram Park station began to serve the East–West Line (EWL) with the operational split of the MRT system.

===North East line===
Preliminary studies for the North East Line (NEL) in 1986 included plans to terminate that line at Outram Park station rather than HarbourFront station. By 1995 the planned line had been extended to include an additional new stop, the World Trade Centre MRT station (now called HarbourFront). In March 1996, communications minister Mah Bow Tan confirmed the station would interchange with the NEL.

The site of the NEL station was the site of a prison complex demolished to make way for Housing and Development Board (HDB) developments. To construct the station, the contractor had to design and execute a major traffic diversion at the cross-junction of Eu Tong Sen Street, Outram Road, Cantonment Road and New Bridge Road, with construction taking place as close as 10 metres away from EWL tunnels. Contract 710 for the construction of Outram Park NEL platform and associated tunnels was awarded to Shimizu-Dillingham-Koh Brothers Joint Venture

In order to link both the NEL and EWL stations, a passageway opening up under the EWL platform was built. Construction of the passageway lasted from March 2001 to December 2001. Shimizu-Dillingham-Koh Brothers Joint Venture had to &quot;hack away the platforms to create openings in the [linkway] structure&quot;. A steel structure was also used to construct the linkway. To facilitate the construction of the NEL station, nine stages of traffic diversion was carried out. To handle the varying soil conditions along the route of the NEL tunnels, a dual-mode tunnel-boring machine was used to construct them, a first in Singapore. Hoardings were built near the site of the NEL station to minimise construction noise. The NEL station has four underground levels, with the second one being out-of-bounds and the first one intended for a public underpass.

In September 2000, construction of lift access in the station began. EWL station upgrades were completed on 12 October 2002. On 14 August 2017, two meeting points designated for assistance from commuters called Heart Zones were designated near the EWL and NEL exits as part of a trial to better assist the elderly, frail and disabled commuters.

===Thomson–East Coast Line===
On 29 August 2012, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced Outram Park station would interchange with the proposed Thomson Line. At the same time, the Singapore Land Authority announced the acquisition of Pearls Centre, a residential-commercial building, giving residents three years to vacate the premises to facilitate tunneling works under the complex.

On 15 August 2014, the LTA announced the Thomson Line would be integrated into the Thomson–East Coast Line (TEL). The TEL platform at Outram Park would be constructed as part of Phase 3, a section of the TEL consisting of 13 stations between Mount Pleasant and Gardens by the Bay. On 9 March 2022, Transport Minister S Iswaran announced in Parliament Phase 3 (Caldecott to Gardens by the Bay via Napier) would open in the second half of 2022. Following the opening of the Thomson–East Coast Line on 13 November 2022, Outram Park station became a triple-line interchange, joining Marina Bay and Dhoby Ghaut stations.

Contract T222 for the construction of Outram Park TEL platform and associated tunnels was awarded to Daelim Industrial Co. Ltd (now DL E&amp;C) at a cost of S$301 million in May 2014. Construction was expected to start in 2014 with completion expected in 2021. To facilitate the construction of the TEL station, a temporary pedestrian overhead bridge had to be removed and a road had to be diverted. The TEL train tunnels were built near existing EWL tunnels; they were tested and monitored for structural integrity during construction. In tandem with the TEL station&#x27;s opening, a new underpass was opened to allow commuters to cross Outram Road.

On 7 October 2022, during a visit by Transport Minister S. Iswaran to Outram Park and stations, it was announced the TEL platform would begin operations on 13 November that year.

===Incidents===
On 6 March 2008 in the NEL section of the station, a police officer shot a man who had threatened him with a knife. The man had already stabbed a person to death at a coffee shop in Jalan Kukoh. A coroner&#x27;s inquiry into the man&#x27;s death ruled the shooting as a case of justifiable homicide and a district judge ruled the shooting as with no criminal intent.

=== Location ===
Outram Park MRT station is located near the junction of Outram Road, Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road on the boundary of Bukit Merah and Outram planning areas. The station serves several health facilities, such as Singapore General Hospital, the National Cancer Centre, the Health Sciences Authority, National Dental Center, Outram Community Hospital and the Health Promotion Board.

<text>Dhoby Ghaut MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North South, North East and Circle lines in Singapore. Located beneath the eastern end of Orchard Road shopping belt in Dhoby Ghaut, Museum Planning Area, the station is integrated with the commercial development The Atrium@Orchard. The station is near landmarks such as The Istana, the MacDonald House, Plaza Singapura and Dhoby Ghaut Green.

Dhoby Ghaut station was part of the early plans for the original MRT network since 1982. It was constructed as part of Phase I of the MRT network which was completed in 1987. Following the network&#x27;s operational split, the station has been served by the North South line since 1989. To construct the North East line platforms, which were completed in 2003, the Stamford Canal had to be diverted while excavating through part of Mount Sophia. The Circle line platforms opened in 2010 along with Stages 1 and 2 of the line.

Dhoby Ghaut station is one of the deepest and largest stations, with five underground levels. Its deepest point is at below ground. The station features many forms of artworks, three of them under the Art-in-Transit scheme in the North East line and Circle line stations, a set of Art Seats at the Circle line platforms, and an art piece above the North South line platforms. It is also the first triple-line interchange station on the MRT network.

==History==
===North South line (NSL) station===

Dhoby Ghaut station was included in the early plans of the MRT network in May 1982. It was to be constructed as part of the Phase I MRT segment from the Novena to Outram Park station; this segment was targeted to be completed by December 1987. Phase I, which would be part of the North South line (NSL), was given priority as it passes through areas having a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio and the Central Area. The line was aimed to relieve the traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang road corridor.

Before construction began, tenants of Amber Mansions were compelled to relocate; the land had already been marked for acquisition in 1978. Contract 106 for the design and construction of Dhoby Ghaut NSL station was awarded to a joint venture between French contractor Campenon-Bernard and Singapore Piling and Civil Engineering Company Limited. The S$51.3 million(US$ million in ) contract, awarded in October 1983, included of tunnelling works between the Somerset and City Hall stations.

Due to the soft marine clay at the station site, jet grouting was used to stabilise the soil. In January 1985, the soft soil led to a tunnel cave-in, which formed a wide hole near Cathay Cinema. The hole was refilled and the soil was further strengthened by injecting a concrete mixture. On 17 June, an engineer died when a crane fell into the work shaft and crushed him. Investigations revealed that the three pieces of timber intended to support the crane were not properly fastened and inadequate in providing support. The contractor was fined S$1,000 (US$ in ) for failing to ensure that the crane was capable of handling the load. Despite the incidents, structural work for the station was completed that September.

To help people to become more familiar with the system, the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) organised an open house at the station on 6 December 1987. Train services commenced on 12 December when the line extension to Outram Park station was officially completed. The station was part of a line service that ran continuously from Yishun station in the north to Lakeside station in the west. From 28 October 1989, it began to serve the NSL with the operational split of the MRT system. In September 2000, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) installed lifts to allow barrier-free access to the station.

===North East line (NEL) station===

Plans were made in 1986 for a new line from Outram Park station via Dhoby Ghaut to Punggol station in the northeast. These were finalised as the North East line (NEL) in January 1996. In August 1997, the LTA awarded Contract C707 for building the NEL station to Obayashi Corporation. The S$268 million(US$ million in ) contract included the construction of two commercial buildings above the station. Construction began in 1996, with NEL commencing services on 20 June 2003.

Construction difficulties included having to reroute the Stamford Canal, which bisected the station site, to a temporary canal. The old canal box was rebuilt and replaced by a new, larger box, which lies above the second level of the station. The new canal was temporarily supported by steel piles while the NEL station box was being constructed. With the proximity of works near the existing NSL station and tunnels, motion detectors had to be set up to detect any settlement of the NSL tunnels. To facilitate the station&#x27;s construction, a part of Mount Sophia, the hill above the site, had to be removed. An high sheet pile wall, restrained with ground anchors, supported the unaffected parts of the hill.

Another construction difficulty was the irregular shapes and varying sizes of the station&#x27;s five levels bound by space constraints. This made it difficult to install the site&#x27;s temporary retaining walls because of the many voids in between the station levels.

===Circle line (CCL) station===

The station box for the Circle line (CCL) had been put in place when the NEL station was being constructed. It was planned for Dhoby Ghaut station to be the terminus of a branch of the Marina line (MRL). The MRL was finalised to serve six stations from this station to Stadium station in November 1999. The station became part of CCL Stage 1 (CCL1) when the MRL plans were incorporated into the CCL plans in 2001.

On 7 August 2001, the LTA awarded Contract 825 for the design and construction of the CCL station and associated tunnels to a joint venture among Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co. (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Woh Hup Pte Ltd and NCC International AB. The S$343.94 million(US$ million in ) contract included building the Bras Basah, Esplanade and Promenade stations. During construction, part of Orchard Road had to be realigned for three months from 10 June 2002. The underpass, linking the NEL and NSL platforms, had to be stabilised while construction works took place underneath. Seven caisson piles were installed to enhance the support of the underpass and capping beams were then constructed to form the supporting system. Along with the other stations on CCL1 and 2, the station began operations on 17 April 2010.

As part of a joint emergency preparedness exercise by the LTA and train operators SBS Transit and SMRT trains, security screenings were held at this station on 6 August 2024. Metal detectors and X-ray machines were deployed for the screening of commuters and their belongings during the exercise.

==Station details==
===Location and name===
The station is located in the eponymous Dhoby Ghaut along the eastern end of Orchard Road, near the junction of Handy Road and Bras Basah Road. It is on a former Jewish cemetery that was in operation between 1841 and 1983. The station name, Dhoby Ghaut, is a Hindi term referring to the area&#x27;s past as a traditional Indian open-air laundry (&quot;dhoby&quot; means &quot;washerman&quot; while &quot;ghat&quot; means &quot;place or steps along a river&quot;).

Landmarks surrounding the station include The Istana, the MacDonald House, the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association building, the House of Tan Yeok Nee, Singapore Management University and the National Museum of Singapore. It is underneath retail and commercial developments such as Plaza Singapura shopping mall and The Atrium@Orchard office complex.

===Services===
The station is served by the NSL, NEL and CCL and is the first triple-line interchange on the MRT network. The official station codes are NS24/NE6/CC1. When it opened, it had the station code of N1 before being changed to the current alphanumeric style in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System. Dhoby Ghaut station generally operates between 5:30am and 12:15am. The first train on the CCL departs from the station at 5:37am and the last train departs for Kranji station on the NSL at 12:13am. On the NSL, Dhoby Ghaut station is between the Somerset and City Hall stations, with a headway of 2 to 5 mins in both directions. The station is between the Clarke Quay and Little India stations on the NEL, with a headway of 2.5 to 5 mins in both directions. The station is the terminus of CCL inner spur to the station; the adjacent station is Bras Basah station. During off-peak, train frequency on the line range from 5 to 6 mins, increasing to 2 to 3 mins during peak hours.

===Station design===

Serving three MRT lines, the five-level underground station is the largest station on the network, with seven entrances connecting to the various developments around the station. The long NSL station, designed by French architect Spielman and local partner Chok and Associates, is located at Basement 3 of the station. The NSL station has brown and black geometric patterns that run throughout the station. These patterns guide passengers to the platforms, which has diamond-shaped tiles to indicate the platform screen doors. Initially with three levels, the station expanded to five underground levels with the NEL platforms.

The NEL platforms, constructed below ground at Basement 5, were the deepest on the network until 2010 when Bras Basah station on the CCL opened. Dhoby Ghaut station is the first MRT station to feature a set of travelators that link the NEL and NSL platforms. The expanded station is integrated with the twin-towered office complex The Atrium@Orchard above the station. The first such integration on the MRT network allows for more efficient land use while improving access to public transport. The station also has retail shops collectively part of Staytion Lifestyle Centre, previously SMRT&#x27;s Dhoby Ghaut XChange. It was initially planned for these shops to be taken over by an anchor tenant due to low footfall from the COVID-19 pandemic, but SMRT&#x27;s retail arm Stellar Lifestyle instead revamped the retail space as part of a new themed retail concept.

Unlike the other NEL stations, the station itself is not designated as a Civil Defence shelter; an underground car park underneath the ten-storey tower is a designated shelter instead. As a result, the station is more spacious and naturally illuminated with lightwells. The station architecture received an &quot;honourable mention&quot; at the Singapore Institute of Architects Design Awards in 2003.

The station is wheelchair accessible. The NSL station, initially without accessible facilities, has been upgraded to include lifts, ramps and dedicated toilets for the disabled. A tactile system, consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station, with dedicated routes that connect the station entrances to the platforms or between the lines. There are wider fare gates that allow easier access for wheelchair users into the station.

==Public art==
The station features six pieces of artworks. The artworks on the NEL and CCL platforms were commissioned as part of the MRT network Art-in-Transit programme, a showcase that integrates public artwork in the MRT network.

=== &quot;Lantern of Music&quot; ===
The mobile sculpture &quot;Lantern of Music&quot; by Tan Ping Chiang is suspended from the ceiling in the NSL concourse. Intended to depict Singapore&#x27;s multiracial culture, the sculpture resembles three lanterns. The largest &quot;lantern&quot; portrays the traditional and contemporary musical instruments of Singapore&#x27;s different ethnic groups, while the two smaller lanterns portray the dances of these ethnic groups and opera masks. It was installed as part of the MRTC&#x27;s S$2 million (US$ million in ) commission of artworks at six MRT stations along the NSL.

===&quot;Interchange&quot;===

Milenko and Delia Prvacki&#x27;s artwork &quot;Interchange&quot; is displayed across the linkway between the NSL and NEL portions of the interchange. Featured on the walls, columns and the floor, including the floor mosaic at the foot of the escalators and ceramic works on four pillars, the artwork is a combination of Delia&#x27;s ceramic works with Milenko&#x27;s mosaics. Seeking to reflect the ethnic‑cultural diversity of Singapore and the region, the Prvackis integrated various local and regional cultural elements such as batik, Peranakan clothing and Chinese ceramics.

The station&#x27;s role as an interchange between the lines, its layout and the cultural history of Singapore inspired the artwork, which was the first major collaborative work between the couple. The artists fused these elements to create modern art &quot;expressed in a marriage of languages&quot; while remaining sensitive to tradition and environment. Delia&#x27;s ceramics were inspired by Chinese ceramics which she was fascinated by since her first introduction to them by a teacher 30 years ago. In this work, she took the opportunity to renew her passion. Milenko&#x27;s mosaics are closely related to his life experiences and sense of identity. He explained that, in his home country of Serbia, mosaic is an important art form in Byzantine culture.

Unlike many other NEL artworks, the artists hand-crafted the work, with Milenko and his four assistants working on his thousands of miniature mosaic tiles. To emphasise the fusion of the artwork, the artists subtly adapted elements of each other&#x27;s portions in their works. Delia&#x27;s porcelains were integrated into Milenko&#x27;s mosaics while his mosaic patterns were among the various spiral and elliptical shapes of Delia&#x27;s tiles. Some patterns and colours are repeated so that the different parts of the work share a common theme. Reflecting on the artwork, the Prvackis said that the project was a learning experience for them that required stretching their artistic thinking within the structural requirements while meeting the needs of commuters. Milenko added it was a &quot;rare pleasure&quot; working with his wife on the project.

===&quot;Universal Language&quot;===
Another artwork, &quot;Universal Language&quot; by Sun Yu-Li, consists of 180‑floor tiles with various motifs distributed across the station. These tiles, accompanied by 14 glass plates positioned at various places in the station, act as wayfinding icons and guide commuters through the complex interchange via six different routes. These symbols lead to a large floor mosaic and a glass mural displayed at the centre of the station at Basement 2. The mosaic and mural incorporate the motifs used on the tiles.

The artwork, which reflects Sun&#x27;s background as an architect, was created to address the station&#x27;s complex layout. Sun also wanted his work to be enjoyable to commuters. Derived from the station&#x27;s role as a &quot;gateway&quot; for arts and culture in the area, he hoped to explore an &quot;objective&quot; and &quot;pure form of expression&quot; that connected to all cultures. This led Sun to develop a &quot;universal language of symbols&quot; based on prehistoric art. The hunter, dancer, rider, animal, fish and bird were used as different sets of symbols for each of the six routes. The initial concept was for the figures to emerge over time after accumulating dust and dirt. However, to improve the visibility of certain complex shapes, the figures were chemically treated.

===&quot;Man and Environment&quot;===

The CCL station features a wall relief, &quot;Man and Environment&quot; by Baet Yeok Kuan. The work consists of 36 white gypsum sculptures across the three columns supporting the CCL station. These sculptures depict unusual textures the artist captured in the station&#x27;s vicinity alongside impressions of rocks and plants. The artwork intends to urge commuters to be more perceptive of less evident details while relieving the pressures of commuting through the fast-paced station environment.

In creating the artwork, Baet used pencil and paper to sketch rubbings, while using plasticine to capture moulds. These collections of impressions were used as inspiration for the series of organic forms that the artwork uses. The work intends to connect commuters to their immediate surroundings while considering the station&#x27;s functionality and design. The sculptures are kept in their original white—the colour of the gypsum used to construct the station and artwork—to blend with the orange walls of the station, which signify the CCL&#x27;s colour. The colour also avoids distracting commuters while making them comfortable.

The work was produced over three months. Each of the art pieces was hand-sculpted in clay to create the mould for the actual gypsum sculpture. Baet was closely involved in the process and ensured the work had an organic and smooth texture. The sculptures were installed carefully near the operational area of the station to prevent disruption to commuters. The final touches to the work were moulded by hand, rather than using noisier and dustier power tools. Reflecting on his work, Baet felt he had &quot;served the public&quot; and found the project to be &quot;very meaningful&quot;; he hoped for his work to be relevant to commuters&#x27; daily travels.

===&quot;Matrix&quot;===

The CCL platforms feature a set of &quot;art seats&quot; entitled &quot;Matrix&quot;. Though the platform seats are intended to be works of art, they are designed to remain functional and practical. This work by Lui Honfay and Yasmine Chan, along with &quot;Rain&quot;, was selected through the International Art Seats Design Competition in 2006. &quot;Matrix&quot; consists of a series of benches engraved with the station name in a dot-matrix style on the seat surface. The dot-matrix system was adopted as it was flexible enough to be mass-produced for use in many stations. The intriguing combination of signage and seat &quot;impressed&quot; the judges who awarded it the top prize.

=== &quot;Comic Connect&quot; ===
A mural is displayed in the NSL station as part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect, a public art showcase of heritage-themed murals by the train operator. The mural, created by Lola Liu, Anthony Chong, and Rene Foo of Visual Arts Centre, depicts the heritage of Dhoby Ghaut through the portrayal of Indian dhobies (washerman), which is the namesake of the area. The work also showcases landmarks such as the MacDonald House, The Istana, National Archives of Singapore, Plaza Singapura, National Museum of Singapore, and The Cathay.

<doc id="1159092" wikidata="Q3427818" url="?curid=1159092" title="Social responsibility">
<text>Social responsibility is an ethical concept in which a person works and cooperates with other people and organizations for the benefit of the community.

An organization can demonstrate social responsibility in several ways, for instance, by donating, encouraging volunteerism, using ethical hiring procedures, and making changes that benefit the environment.

Social responsibility is an individual responsibility that involves a balance between the economy and the ecosystem one lives within, and possible trade-offs between economic development, and the welfare of society and the environment. Social responsibility pertains not only to business organizations but also to everyone whose actions impact the environment.

== History ==
Writers in the classical Western philosophical tradition acknowledged the importance of social responsibility for human thriving.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle determined that &quot;Man is by nature a political animal.&quot;

He saw ethics and politics as mutually-reinforcing: a citizen develops the virtues in large part so that they can contribute to making the an excellent and stable one. And the purpose of that was so that the would be fertile soil in which a thriving, virtuous citizenry could grow (and in order that there could be an appropriate political context in which one could successfully practice virtues like justice which require a political context).

He believed that the is meant to be &quot;a community of equals for the sake of a life which is potentially the best.&quot; Some of the virtues in his scheme of virtue ethics, like magnificence and justice were inseparable from a sense of social responsibility.

===Ancient Rome===
Cicero believed that &quot;In no other realm does human excellence approach so closely the paths of the gods as it does in the founding of new and in the preservation of already founded communities.&quot;

In the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, he wrote that &quot;That which isn&#x27;t good for the hive isn&#x27;t good for the bee.&quot;

===Modern times===

In 1953, the book &quot;Social responsibility of the businessman&quot; published by the American economist Howard Bowen was one of the first to address the issue of social responsibility as it relates to business activity.

==Individual social responsibility==

One can be socially responsible passively, by avoiding engaging in socially harmful acts, or actively, by performing activities that advance social goals. Social responsibility has an intergenerational aspect, since the actions of one generation have consequences for their posterity, and also can be more or less respectful for their ancestors.

Social responsibility can require a degree of boldness or courage. Alexander Solzhenitsyn, for example, believed that &quot;we have gotten used to regarding as valor only valor in war (or the kind that&#x27;s needed for flying in outer space), the kind which jingle-jangles with medals. We have forgotten another concept of &quot;valor—civil valor&quot;. And that&#x27;s all our society needs, just that, just that, just that!&quot;.

Another way to be socially responsible is by being careful not to spread information that you have not diligently vetted for its truth. In the modern information environment, &quot;the stakes of credulity are simply too high,&quot; says Francisco Mejia Uribe. Socially responsible people have &quot;the moral obligation to believe only what we have diligently investigated.&quot; And a socially responsible person &quot;in her capacity as communicator of belief… has the moral responsibility not to pollute the well of collective knowledge and instead to strive to sustain its integrity.&quot;

===Scientists and engineers===

Are scientists and engineers morally responsible for the negative consequences that result from applications of their knowledge and inventions? If scientists and engineers take pride in the positive achievements of science and technology, shouldn&#x27;t they also accept responsibility for the negative consequences related to the use or abuse of scientific knowledge and technological innovations? Scientists and engineers have a collective responsibility to examine the values embedded in the research problems they choose and the ethics of how they share their findings with the public.

Committees of scientists and engineers are often involved in planning governmental and corporate research programs, including those devoted to the development of military technologies and weaponry. Many professional societies and national organizations, such as the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in the United States, have ethical guidelines (see Engineering ethics and Research ethics for the conduct of scientific research and engineering). Scientists and engineers, individually and collectively, have a special and greater responsibility than average citizens with respect to the generation and use of scientific knowledge.

Some argue that because of the complexity of social responsibility in research, scientists and engineers should not be blamed for all the evils created by new scientific knowledge and technological innovations. First, there is fragmentation and diffusion of responsibility: Because of the intellectual and physical division of labor, the resulting fragmentation of knowledge, the high degree of specialization, and the complex and hierarchical decision-making process within corporations and government research laboratories, it is exceedingly difficult for individual scientists and engineers to control the applications of their innovations. This fragmentation of work and decision-making results in fragmented moral accountability, often to the point where &quot;everybody involved was responsible but none could be held responsible.&quot;

Another problem is ignorance. The scientists and engineers cannot predict how their newly generated knowledge and technological innovations may be abused or misused. The excuse of ignorance is stronger for scientists involved in very basic and fundamental research where potential applications cannot be even envisioned, than for scientists and engineers involved in applied scientific research and technological innovation since in such work objectives are well-known. For example, most corporations conduct research on specific products or services that promise to yield profit for share-holders. Similarly, most of the research funded by governments is mission-oriented, such as protecting the environment, developing new drugs, or designing more lethal weapons. In cases where the application of scientific knowledge and technological innovation is well-known &quot;a priori&quot;, a scientist or engineer cannot escape responsibility for research and technological innovation that is morally dubious. As John Forge writes in &quot;Moral Responsibility and the Ignorant Scientist&quot;: &quot;Ignorance is not an excuse precisely because scientists can be blamed for being ignorant.&quot;

Another point of view is that responsibility falls on those who provide the funding for the research and technological developments (in most cases corporations and government agencies). Because taxpayers provide the funds for government-sponsored research, they and the politicians that represent them should perhaps be held accountable for the uses and abuses of science. In times past scientists could often conduct research independently, but today&#x27;s experimental research requires expensive laboratories and instrumentation, making scientists dependent on those who pay for their studies.

Quasi-legal instruments, or soft law, has received some normative status in relation to private and public corporations in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) &quot;Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights&quot; developed by the UNESCO International Bioethics Committee particularly in relation to child and maternal welfare. The International Organization for Standardization will &quot;encourage voluntary commitment to social responsibility and will lead to common guidance on concepts, definitions and methods of evaluation.&quot;

==Corporate social responsibility==
Ethical decision-making by businesses can prevent costly government intervention in those businesses. For instance, if a company follows the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines for emissions of dangerous pollutants and goes further to involve the community and address concerns the public might have, they might be less likely to have the EPA investigate them. According to some experts, most rules and regulations are formed due to public outcry, which threatens profit maximization and therefore the well-being of shareholders; if there is no outcry, this limits regulation.

Some critics argue that corporate social responsibility (CSR) distracts from the fundamental economic role of businesses; others argue that it is nothing more than superficial window-dressing, such as &quot;greenwashing&quot;; others argue that it is an attempt to pre-empt the role of governments as a watchdog over powerful corporations. A significant number of studies have shown no negative influence on shareholder results from CSR but rather a slightly positive correlation with improved shareholder returns.

While many corporations include social responsibility in their operations, those procuring their goods and services may also independently ensure these products are socially sustainable. Verification tools are available from many entities internationally, for example the Underwriters Laboratories environmental standards, BioPreferred, and Green Seal. A corporate reputation aligned with social responsibility is linked to higher profits, particularly when firms voluntarily report the positive and negative impacts of their social responsibility endeavors.

Certification processes like these help corporations and their consumers identify potential risks associated with a product&#x27;s lifecycle and enable end users to confirm the corporation&#x27;s practices adhere to social responsibility ideals. A reputation for social responsibility leads to more positive responses toward a brand&#x27;s products by inducing a reciprocal desire to help companies that have helped others, an effect that is more prominent among consumers who value helping others and is reduced if consumers doubt a firm&#x27;s intentions.

<doc id="1159093" wikidata="Q3272355" url="?curid=1159093" title="HarbourFront MRT station">
<text>HarbourFront MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station in Singapore. The termini of the North East line (NEL) and Circle line (CCL), the station serves the HarbourFront area and Sentosa. Surrounding retail and commercial developments include VivoCity and HarbourFront Centre, and the station is near HarbourFront Bus Interchange and the Singapore Cruise Centre.

The NEL station was first announced as World Trade Centre MRT station in March 1996 as one of the line&#x27;s 16 stations. Its construction involved several road diversions and the opening of the drainage culverts. The NEL station was completed on 20 June 2003. The CCL platforms opened on 8 October 2011 along with Stages 4 and 5 of the line.

Reflecting the station&#x27;s location by the Singapore Strait, the station concourse has an elliptical motif resembling a ship hull. The station features three artworks as part of the Art-in-Transit programme. The NEL platforms and concourse display a series of line-drawings by Ian Woo, while the CCL platforms feature &quot;Commuting Waves&quot; by Jason Ong and a set of art seats entitled &quot;Matrix&quot;.

==History==
===North East line===
In preliminary studies for the North East line (NEL) in 1986, it was planned for the line to terminate at Outram Park station, rather than HarbourFront. In a later study in 1995, the planned NEL was extended to serve World Trade Centre. After plans for the new line were approved by the government in January 1996, the station, then tentatively named World Trade Centre, was among the 16 NEL stations announced by communications minister Mah Bow Tan in March 1996.

The contract for constructing the station and tunnels was awarded to Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction at S$132.8 million (US$ million in ) in September 1997. The scope of the contract included the widening of a section of Telok Blangah Road. The new station was expected to boost retail and residential developments in the Telok Blangah area, which was known for the Keppel Harbour and associated industries. The Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) had cooperated with the Land Transport Authority (LTA) officials on redevelopment plans for the area. To minimise impact on businesses in the area, the contractor used silent pilers when driving steel piles into the ground. These pilers created less noise and vibrations compared to conventional pilers.

The station was constructed near the seashore. In order to prevent water seepage into the site, the contractors injected cement into the soil surrounding the station site via jet grouting. Sheet piles were installed around the site, and tests were conducted to determine the amount of saltwater and groundwater at the site. The contractor initially considered rerouting the drainage system that channelled water to the sea but that was financially unfeasible. Instead, the culverts that crossed the site were cut open and diverted into temporary steel culverts or pipes that did not obstruct the works. Due to the limited space, two of the World Trade Centre&#x27;s exhibition halls were demolished to facilitate construction works.

Concurrently, the Telok Blangah Road was being upgraded with a new vehicular overpass being constructed. Hence, the LTA&#x27;s road and rail project teams had to coordinate to maximise the efficiency of both projects. The rail project team had constructed 10 viaduct foundations for the road section that crosses the station site. At the same time, the contractor had to maintain the traffic flow in the area – not just for visitors to the World Trade Centre, but to prevent delays and disruptions to port operations nearby. The traffic was diverted to temporary steel decking that ran over the construction site. The roads were diverted at least 30 times for the station&#x27;s construction.

The contractors (Shimizu Corporation, Koh Brothers and Dillingham Construction International) for the of tunnelling works between this station and the adjacent Outram Park station had to monitor for any ground movement for the shophouses and ensure operations for the Malaysian rail service was not affected. A dual-mode tunnel boring machine was used to deal with the varying soil conditions along the tunnel route.
HarbourFront station opened on 20 June 2003 with the rest of the NEL stations. In October 2012, the LTA announced that the NEL overrun tunnel would be extended by . Completed at the end of 2014 at a cost of S$8.2 million (US$ million), the extension is to facilitate quicker turnarounds for southbound trains.

As part of a joint emergency preparedness exercise by the LTA and train operators SBS Transit and SMRT, security screenings were held at the station on 2 August 2019. The screening machines deployed for the exercise include mass screening devices and X-Ray machines to check for possible threat items like firearms. Such exercises were conducted to test established response protocols and maintain vigilance for quicker and more effective responses during emergencies and heightened security situations.

===Circle line===

In 2001, Yeo Cheow Tong, the communications minister, announced that the Circle line (CCL) will serve the HarbourFront area. On 12 December 2003, the LTA confirmed that HarbourFront station will interchange with the CCL and the new platforms would be constructed as part of CCL Stage 5 (CCL5). This segment consisted of five stations from West Coast station to this station.

The contract for the fitting out works for the CCL station and connecting tunnels was awarded to SembCorp Engineers &amp; Constructors Pte Ltd (SembCorp E&amp;C) at S$335.38 million (US$ million) in October 2004. The contract include civil, architectural and building works for the West Coast, Pasir Panjang, Alexandra and Telok Blangah stations, alongside of twin bored tunnels and of cut and cover tunnels.

To facilitate construction works for the CCL platforms, Platform A of the NEL station was closed on 30 October 2005. Trains on the NEL from Punggol station terminated at Outram Park station, while a special shuttle train was launched for services between Outram Park and HarbourFront. In December 2009, structure works for the CCL station were completed, with backfilling in progress. As announced by transport minister Lui Tuck Yew during his visit to the CCL4 and 5 stations on 1 August 2011, the CCL platforms began revenue service on 8 October that year.

On 17 January 2013, transport minister Lui Tuck Yew announced that the CCL would be extended from HarbourFront station to Marina Bay station as part of CCL Stage 6. Tunnelling works between this station and Keppel station began on 25 July 2019, and were completed in August 2020.

==Station details==

HarbourFront station is the terminus of the NEL and CCL; its official station code is NE1/CC29. On the NEL, the adjacent station is Outram Park station. Trains turnaround by using the cripple siding on the west end of the station or the crossover on the east end of the station. The next stop on the CCL in the clockwise direction is Telok Blangah station. Trains turnaround on the CCL terminus by using crossovers located at both ends of the station. With the completion of CCL6, the subsequent station in the counterclockwise direction will be Keppel. Designed by Architects61, the station concourse has an elliptical motif resembling a ship hull, alongside floor patterns and the artwork that reflects the station&#x27;s location by the Singapore Strait.

The station is underneath Telok Blangah Road and has five entrances. HarbourFront station serves various commercial and retail developments including HarbourFront Centre and VivoCity. It is the closest MRT station to the tourist island of Sentosa. The station is also near HarbourFront Bus Interchange, Seah Im Food Centre, Singapore Cruise Centre and Mount Faber Park, along with the cultural sites of Temenggong Mosque and St James Power Station.

The NEL station is designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter. It is designed to accommodate at least 7,500 people and can withstand airstrikes and chemical attacks. Equipment essential for the operations in the CD shelter is mounted on shock absorbers to prevent damage during a bombing. When electrical supply to the shelter is disrupted, there are backup generators to keep operations going. The shelter has dedicated built-in decontamination chambers and dry toilets with collection bins that will send human waste out of the shelter.

The NEL and CCL platforms are wheelchair-accessible. A tactile system, consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station, with dedicated tactile routes that connect the station entrances to the platforms or between either line&#x27;s platforms.

==Public artworks==
The station displays four artworks; three as part of the MRT network&#x27;s Art-in-Transit programme – a showcase of public artworks on the MRT network and one as part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect display, a public art display of heritage-themed murals.

===&quot;Enigmatic Appearances&quot;===

&quot;Enigmatic Appearances&quot; by Ian Woo is a series of line-drawings depicting various sea creatures, ships and clouds in minimalist style. Painted on 60 blue vitreous enamel wall panels, the work was intended to reflect the station&#x27;s maritime theme and its location near the port. With its &quot;dream-like&quot; quality, the figures are in fragments dispersed throughout the station, allowing commuters in the station to slowly perceive the artwork over time. A set of footprints on the walls at the end of the NEL platforms references the station&#x27;s role as the terminus of the NEL.

Inspirations for the artwork were derived from what Woo captured in his visit to the HarbourFront area. In addition to taking photos of the area, he wrote about his experiences during his trip. Creating the work required him to co-operate with the station&#x27;s architects, since the LTA intended to integrate art with the station&#x27;s design. Although Woo was used to working independently, he learnt to articulate his thoughts and intentions with the architectural team, with the help of NEL art coordinator Constance Sheares. The collaboration allowed Woo and the architectural team to have deeper insights into each other&#x27;s works. While retaining his creative freedom over the work, Woo ensured that the work was compatible with the technical aspects of the station design.

After the architects and the Art Review Panel approved his line drawings, the figures were painted and enlarged. This process took place across two weeks, with some revisions made due to the artist&#x27;s dissatisfaction with some of the enlarged figures. The black-and-white figures were then coloured in blue at a vitreous enamel factory in England. Travelling to the factory to oversee the production process, Woo also gave further instructions and ensured the colours of the final product come out right.

===&quot;Commuting Waves&quot;===

Displayed on the wall of the CCL platforms near the escalators, &quot;Commuting Waves&quot; by Jason Ong is a pair of sculptures depicting 3D waveforms. The waveforms were derived from commuter traffic at the station, with the positions of the glass &#x27;fins&#x27; representing the passenger volume and train frequencies. The work is intended to reflect the rhythm and flow of human activities, which linked the work to the station&#x27;s location, human values and the MRT system.

The work was created through indeterminacy, inspired by experimental music of John Cage. The inspiration came when Ong was researching soundwaves (waveforms being a distinctive element of the waterfront area), and intended to create the waveforms based on the station&#x27;s environment. Two assistants recorded the train frequency and passenger traffic on a randomly selected weekday and weekend. The artist noted that the data was only derived from commuters on the NEL, since the CCL was not yet operational when the work was created. Nevertheless, he concluded that the graph shapes would remain similar if he were to include passenger numbers from the CCL.

The graphs had to be transformed into sculptures that are &quot;aesthetically pleasing&quot;. The protrusion and spacing of each &quot;fin&quot; were dependent on the passenger traffic and train frequency respectively. Using phase shift, a concept by minimalist composer Steve Reich, the data lines were spaced out from the original graphs. Each alternating frequency was split into different layers that spread across the walls. The eventual shapes of the waveforms were derived from the freehand outlines of the graphs. These outlines were also mirrored to produce the shapes.

The sculptures are in red, which not only reflects the human rhythm but also complements the CCL station&#x27;s theme, contrasting with the NEL&#x27;s blue theme. While initially planned to use metal shapes, upon seeing the portfolio of the production team, Ong changed to glass. Ong grouped the fins into sets of six and used serialism to give each fin a different red &quot;tone&quot;. The glass used were opaque edged, but as Ong did not like how it appeared, it was changed to transparent edged. An idea to create an illusion of wave moment was discarded due to various unresolved technical difficulties of getting the appropriate tone and colours for the illusion.

===&quot;Matrix&quot;===
The CCL platforms feature a set of &quot;art seats&quot; entitled &quot;Matrix&quot;. Though the platform seats are intended to be works of art, they are designed to remain functional and practical. This work by Lui Honfay and Yasmine Chan, along with &quot;Rain&quot;, was selected through the International Art Seats Design Competition in 2006. &quot;Matrix&quot; consists of a series of benches engraved with the station name in a dot-matrix style on the seat surface. The dot-matrix system was adopted as it was flexible enough to be mass-produced for use in many stations. The intriguing combination of signage and seat &quot;impressed&quot; the judges who awarded it the top prize.

=== &quot;Comic Connect&quot; ===
There is a heritage themed mural in the CCL station created by local artists Monica Lim, Kevin Lee, and Chris Lim as a part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect display. The mural features landmarks such as the Tang Gah Beo Taoist Temple, Catholic Church of St Teresa, Singapore Cruise Centre, and the Keppel terminal of the Port of Singapore.

<text>Paya Lebar MRT station ( ) is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the East West line (EWL) and Circle line (CCL) in Geylang, Singapore. Despite the name, this station is not located in Paya Lebar but rather along Paya Lebar Road, near the junction with Sims Avenue. It is located among the developments of the Paya Lebar Central commercial hub and near the Geylang Serai district.

The station opened on 4 November 1989 as part of the MRT eastern line extension to Tanah Merah station. The EWL station exterior has the characteristic dome-shaped segmented roof also seen on other elevated EWL stations. The station later interchanges with the Circle line on 17 April 2010, and was the first MRT station to serve both an elevated line and an underground line.

==History==
===East-West Line===
Paya Lebar station was first announced in May 1982 in the initial MRT plans. It was later announced that the station would be part of Phase II of the MRT system in October 1983.

There were several joint ventures between companies that prequalified for Contract 303 and Contract 302 by May 1985. Contract 303 initially detailed the construction of Paya Lebar station as well as a viaduct from Paya Lebar to Eunos station whilst Contract 302 detailed the construction of the station&#x27;s viaducts. Ultimately, Contract 302 was awarded to Lee Kim Tah Ltd. at a contract sum of S$59.52 million in November 1985. The contractor had partnered with a French company Societe Generale D&#x27;Enterprises Sainrapt Et Brice (SGE) for the construction. The contract also included the construction of the Kallang and Aljunied stations. Contract 303 was awarded to a Japanese-Singaporean joint venture between the Okumura Corporation and Oh Teck Thye for in December 1985, with Okumara having 60% interest in the contract whilst Oh Teck Thye having 40%. By then, the contract expanded to include the construction of Eunos station as well as viaducts to Kembangan station. Work began in the same month. However, on 30 December 1986, the joint venture for Contract 303 was terminated, with the Okumura Corporation undertaking all the responsibilities of Contract 303 and Oh Teck Thye to cease all interests in said contract. It was later found out that Oh Teck Thye owed to the United Overseas Bank (UOB) and was placed under receivership when it failed to repay its debts. Meanwhile, Okumura requested to take over Oh Teck Thye&#x27;s part of the contract. It was described to have been &quot;the first case of a joint-venture split in the MRT Project&quot;. By February 1986, 41% of the contract has been completed. The station had an expected opening date of 18 November 1989 but was opened on 4 November 1989.

As with most of the elevated stations along the East-West line, the station was initially built without platform screen doors. Following a rise in track intrusions as well as commuters slipping when rushing for the train, the LTA and SMRT decided to install platform screen doors. After several successful tests at Jurong East, Yishun and Pasir Ris, half-height platform screen doors were eventually installed and commenced operations at Paya Lebar station by March 2012. In addition, high-volume low-speed fans were installed and started operations since 14 July that year together with Kembangan station. Privacy screens were installed at some parts from Paya Lebar Road all the way to Geylang East Central, to minimise the noise impact from residents since October 2016 and completed in May 2017.

===Circle Line===

Contract 823 for the construction of Paya Lebar station was awarded to Lum Chang Building Contractors Pte Ltd-Nishimatsu Construction Co. Ltd. joint venture at a contract sum of S$322 million. The contract also includes the construction of the Mountbatten and Dakota stations. Construction of the station started in August 2002.

On 16 March 2003, several roads around the station, including Paya Lebar Road, Eunos Avenue 5 and Tanjong Katong Road, were converted to one-way traffic to facilitate the construction. A bus stop was also temporary relocated in front of Singapore Post Centre. A stretch of Sims Avenue was also temporarily realigned from 26 August 2003 until two months later. When the roads were reinstated, an extra lane for each direction of Paya Lebar Road was added.

The Circle line station faced a major civil engineering challenge with regard to the underpinning of two existing EWL viaduct pillars. The pillars foundations were obstructing the construction works needed for the station. This was the first time such an operation was conducted in Singapore, especially on a live, heavy-capacity MRT line. A concrete wall, a concrete beam and a powerful jacking device were used to transfer the load of the viaduct to other structures. It was followed by the removal of the old piles and construction of new piles to support the viaduct. Many monitoring devices were installed and key engineers looked out for any potential breaches. Additional materials and tools were on standby if the pillars start to tilt when the piles were cut, and the Land Transport Authority (LTA) worked out emergency procedures with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). The underpinning works were carried out successfully.

The Circle line station opened on 17 April 2010 when the line extended to Dhoby Ghaut station.

===Incidents===
On 4 April 2007, a man died after being hit by a train along the East West line sector at about 10:20 am. Police said the victim, a 52-year-old Chinese man, was pronounced dead by paramedics at 10:45 am. East-bound services were disrupted for 41 minutes but resumed by 11:02 am.

==Station details==
===Services===
The station serves the EWL between the Eunos and Aljunied stations, and the CCL between the Dakota and MacPherson stations. Being part of both the EWL and CCL, the station is operated by SMRT Trains. On the EWL, the station operates between 5:47am (6.13am on Sundays and public holidays) and 12:22am. On the CCL, the station operates between 5:40am (6.07am on Sundays and public holidays) and 12:26am.

===Design===

Like most EWL elevated stations on the eastern segment on the line (after Kallang station), Paya Lebar station has the notable feature of the dome-shaped roof, segmented like a caterpillar, over the platform level. The design was an attempt by the MRT Corporation (MRTC) to give the stations on the EWL an &quot;attractive look&quot;.

The CCL station design, like all stations on the line, takes into account certain factors such as safety, comfort and convenience, in addition to giving them a stylish modern outlook. The standardised layouts for the stations also make it simpler for commuters to navigate around. Paya Lebar station is also among the few stations with Y-shaped columns supporting the station structure. In addition, there are barrier-free transfers between the EWL and CCL. The CCL station itself, like the other stations on the line, has features such as lifts and wider faregates to make them accessible for wheelchair users. 
The CCL station contains three platforms, however only the two outer platforms are in active operation. The middle platform is used by terminating trains before they return to the depot or occasionally trains turning back in the opposite direction. This arrangement is similar to Ang Mo Kio MRT station.

===Public art===

The artwork &quot;The Signs of Times&quot; by Salleh Japar is showcased at the concourse level of the CCL station as part of the Art-in-Transit programme. The artwork showcases abstract pictographs reflecting the varying periods of Paya Lebar&#x27;s developments from a rural village to a satellite town. Some icons used includes pigs in a pig sty and an aeroplane taking flight from a nearby airport.

The station also features Art Seats, which have creative design to enhance the commuters&#x27; experience on the line. Two entries were selected through the International Art Seats Design Competition in 2006. The first entry – &quot;Matrix&quot;, which received the top prize in the international competition – consists of a series of benches engraved with the name of the station in a dot-matrix style on the seat surface. Another entry, &quot;Rain&quot;, showcases steel seats in the shape of water puddles. These seats are also displayed in the other CCL interchange stations.

There is also a mural created by local artists Sayed Ismali, James Suresh, and Suki Chong entitled &quot;The Paya Lebar Story&quot;. As a part of the heritage themed Comic Connect public art display by SMRT, the mural depicts squatters and Arab merchant Syed Omar Aljunied as well as a variety of landmarks such as Kampung Melayu, Sri Sivan Temple, Foo Hai Ch&#x27;an Monastery, Tanjong Katong Complex, the former Geylang Fire Station, and the former Singapore International Airport.
=== Connectivity ===
The station is linked directly by underpass to multiple shopping malls in the area, including Paya Lebar Quarter and Paya Lebar Square. Malls and other building in the vicinity that are not linked directly by underpass include SingPost Centre and Lifelong Learning Institute. Exit C provides access to Foo Hai Ch&#x27;an Monastery, Sri Sivan Temple and Masjid Wak Tanjong. Exit D provides access to City Plaza, Geylang Road and Wisma Geylang Serai.

<text>Buona Vista MRT station is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the East West line and Circle line in Queenstown, Singapore. This station is close to one-north, a high technology business park for the biomedical science, infocomm technology and media industries. It is located near the junction of North Buona Vista Road, Commonwealth Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue West.

==History==

Buona Vista station opened on 12 March 1988, as part of Phase 1B of the MRT line which runs from Outram Park to Clementi. The station was initially planned to be linked to a Light Rail Transit line that would have served residents living near the area, as well as students from the National University of Singapore and Singapore Polytechnic, as announced by Singapore&#x27;s then-Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan. However, it was eventually not built due to its lack of economic viability.

Following the 25 March 2005 accident, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) made the decision in 2008 to install platform screen doors in this station, whereby operations commenced on 10 June 2011.

===Circle Line interchange===
With the construction of the Circle line from 11 January 2005, the bridge was demolished and replaced with a newer one. The second level of the East West line station was also converted into a transfer level between the two lines. The Circle line platforms were opened on 8 October 2011, while the two new exits share the same location as the original one.

== Station details ==
The station is located along Buona Vista Road, near The Star.

=== East West Line ===
The station is situated between Commonwealth and Dover stations. Its official station code is “EW21”.

The station consists of an island platform, with doors opening on the right.

=== Circle Line ===
The station is situated between Holland Village and one-north stations. Its other official station code is “CC22”.

The station consists of one island platform, with doors opening on the right. The seats are dots in matrices, spelling the station&#x27;s name.

=== Artworks ===
The artwork featured under the Art in Transit programme is &quot;The Tree of Life&quot; by Gilles Massot. Located on the lift shaft in the CCL station, the artwork depicts a eucalyptus tree located at the nearby Kent Ridge Park that has been digitally edited to create an effect similar to David Hockney&#x27;s photo montages. The tree also represents the jungle greenery which used to exist next to the above-ground station and is a result of the deep impression left on the artist of the landscape and view of the area.

There is also a mural as part of the heritage-themed Comic Connect public art display by SMRT. Created by David Liew, the mural depicts Buona Vista&#x27;s history from the 1930&#x27;s to the 1970&#x27;s including the Singapore Motor Club, its various former military bases, and the Ghim Moh Estate.

<text>Bishan MRT station ( ) is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North–South (NSL) and Circle (CCL) lines in Bishan, Singapore. The station is located along Bishan Road within the town centre; it is integrated with Junction 8 shopping centre and is close to Bishan Bus Interchange. Nearby schools include Raffles Institution, Catholic High School, and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary and Secondary Schools.

Initially announced as Kampung San Teng, it was renamed San Teng and subsequently Bishan. Bishan NSL station opened on 7 November 1987; it was one of the first five stations on the MRT network. During its construction, the original island platform of the NSL was split into two separate side platforms and the station was upgraded to cope with increased passenger traffic from the CCL, which opened on 28 May 2009. In 2017, tunnels between Bishan and Braddell stations flooded, disrupting train services on the NSL. Bishan NSL is the only ground-level station on the MRT network, while the CCL station houses &quot;Move!&quot; by Soh Ee Shaun, an Art-in-Transit artwork. Due to the station&#x27;s location near a former cemetery, the station is said to be haunted.

==History==
===North–South line (1987)===
Bishan station, which was then named Kampung San Teng, was one of the first stations to be included in the planning stages of the MRT network. The station was renamed San Teng in November 1982 and would be built at a Chinese cemetery. Contract 103 for the construction of San Teng MRT station and of tunnels between San Teng and Braddell stations was awarded to a Belgian-Singaporean joint venture Hytech, Franki and Compagnie Francois d&#x27;Enterprises in December 1983 at a contract sum of . This was the first contract involving cut and cover construction MRT Corporation (MRTC) awarded. On 21 September 1984, the MRTC renamed San Teng to Bishan station to reflect the name of the new housing estate that was being built around the station&#x27;s site.

Structural work for Bishan station was completed on 23 October 1985. In January 1986, it was announced the station would be opened in early 1988 as part of the first section of the MRT system from Yio Chu Kang to Toa Payoh stations. In September 1987, it was announced the section would open on 7 November that year. To familiarise people with the system, the station opened for a preview from 24 to 25 October. As announced, Bishan was one of the first MRT stations on the network to be opened for service on 7 November 1987.
===Circle MRT line and further upgrades (2008-09)===

In July 2003, Contract C825A for the design, construction and completion of Bishan interchange station was awarded to Econ Corporation Ltd and Eng Lim Construction Co Pte Ltd Joint Venture at a sum of . The contract also included the upgrading of the NSL station. Construction was due to start in the third quarter of 2003 and was expected to be completed by early 2008.

The original NSL station underwent major alterations to enable it to accommodate increased passenger traffic when the CCL station opened. A new, air-conditioned platform to serve southbound trains to Marina South Pier was constructed to increase the station&#x27;s passenger capacity from 1,250 to 2,020. The new platform, Platform B, opened for service on 27 July 2008. Because Platform A, the original platform, was now serving northbound trains to Jurong East and remained in service, upgrading works for Platform A were hindered and took about a year to complete. While the platform was re-tiled during the day, platform screen doors (PSDs) were installed in sections through the night. An air-conditioning system was also installed as part of the upgrade. Upgrading work for the platform was completed on 23 May 2009. An additional entrance to the basement of Junction 8 was also built. Along with the other Stage 3 CCL stations, Bishan CCL station was opened on 28th of that month.

Due to the close proximity of a nearby tunnel portal to residential apartment blocks, the installation of -tall barriers stretching started in September 2011 and was completed by the second quarter of 2012. These barriers are insulated with noise-absorptive materials such as rock wool, which helped reduce noise volume by about five decibels. The NSL station underwent another upgrade in 2016; this included the repositioning of seats on the platforms to allow more space and seats for commuters to be added.

===Incidents===
On 28 July 2004, a 31-year-old accountant died after falling onto the track in front of an oncoming train at Bishan station, disrupting northbound train services for an hour. On September 15 the same year, an elderly man died in a similar incident.

On 7 October 2017, during heavy rain in the afternoon, water entered a section of tunnel between Bishan and Braddell MRT stations, disrupting NSL train services from Ang Mo Kio station to Marina South Pier for several hours. This was the first time train services in Singapore were affected by flooded tunnels. Separately, at about 5.55pm, a small fire ignited in the tunnel between Marina Bay and Raffles Place stations but it is not clear the fire, which was extinguished by itself, was linked to the flood, although electrical short circuits caused by water had previously caused tunnel fires.

Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton resumed at about 9.20pm that day. After the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) worked overnight to clear the water in the tunnels, train services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio stations resumed at 1.36 pm the following day. This train disruption was one of the worst in SMRT&#x27;s history. Through investigations by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), it was discovered the overflowing in the tunnel was caused by a malfunction in the poorly maintained water pumping system, which was repaired. On 20 July 2018, the Land Transport Authority fined the operator a combined S$1.9 million (US$ million) for this incident, in addition to the Pasir Ris rail accident, and subsequently sacked eight workers involved in the incident due to their negligence by falsifying maintenance records and not maintaining the pumps.

== Station details ==

=== Location and name ===
Bishan MRT station is located along Bishan Road in the Singapore neighbourhood Bishan. The name Bishan is the Mandarin pronunciation of &quot;Peck San&quot; (), which was derived from the name of a large Cantonese burial ground Peck San Theng that used to cover the area.

Bishan station is situated near the retail development Junction 8 and other public amenities such as Bishan Public Library, the CPF building, Bishan Neighbourhood Police Post, Bishan Stadium, Bishan Community Club and Bishan Bus Interchange. It is within walking distance of Catholic High School, Raffles Institution, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian School and the Ministry of Education Language Centre (Bishan).

==== Services ====
Bishan station serves the North–South (NSL) and Circle lines (CCL). The station code is NS17/CC15 according to official maps. On the NSL, Bishan station is located between Ang Mo Kio and Braddell stations, while on the CCL, the station is located between Lorong Chuan and Marymount stations. The NSL has headways of two to five minutes while the CCL services have headways of three-and-a-half to five minutes.

=== Station design ===
Bishan NSL station is the only ground-level station on the MRT network. The station was designed with an &quot;open, sunken-plaza&quot; concept that allows natural light onto the tracks. The station has a beige and brick-coloured scheme with plantings of bougainvillaeas outside. The station concourse has steel roof cladding that was installed by Robertson Building Systems (RBS) for . During construction of the CCL, the station entrance was upgraded to &quot;capture the essence&quot; of the station&#x27;s status as &quot;gateway&quot; to Bishan. The rebuilt station has a pyramidal opened-top aluminium roof over the existing flat roof, allowing sunlight and ventilation into the station.

The retail stores around the station use glass panels that have chamfered corners, giving balance to the roof. The glass walls are separated from the roofline via a small space at the top so the roof appears to be afloat. The paid area has a layered ceiling and design elements made of glass, giving it a spacious atmosphere. A glass canopy connects the station to the retail development Junction 8.

Bishan CCL station is one of eleven stations along the Circle Line that are designated as Civil Defence (CD) shelters that can be activated during national emergencies. The designated stations have reinforced construction, and are designed and equipped with facilities including protective blast doors, decontamination facilities, ventilation systems, power and water supply systems, and a dry toilet system to ensure the environment is tolerable if the station is used as a shelter.

== Public artworks ==
There are three artworks; one is part of the Art in Transit programme, one is part of a series of sculptures, and the other is part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect.

=== &quot;Move!&quot; ===
The artwork &quot;Move!&quot; by Soh Ee Shaun is displayed at the CCL station as part of the network&#x27;s Art-in-Transit programme. The artwork consists of three murals – &quot;The Family&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;The Heartland&quot; – each of which is made of 16 glass panels, all cast in film. The artwork reflects the artist&#x27;s view of the &quot;mindless rush of commuters&quot; through the station. &quot;The Family&quot;, a mural mainly in yellow and black, depicts ordinary activities that are part of Singapore&#x27;s &quot;air-conditioned&quot; lifestyle. &quot;The Scientist&quot; portrays larger-than-life scientists surrounded by modern technology such as rockets, robots and fighter jets; this mural is designed in blue and black and is painted on a canvas. &quot;The Heartland&quot;, on a panel, represents the neighbourhood of Bishan with the area&#x27;s notable landmarks against a pink backdrop. While these works cover different subject matters, all express the artist&#x27;s &quot;silly and illogical&quot; style.

The youngest to be commissioned for an Art-in-Transit artwork on the CCL, Soh initially planned to create an abstract work of people moving around to reflect the bustle of a train station. However, it was thought to be &quot;too literal&quot; and the Art-in-Transit curator Karen Lim, urged Soh to incorporate thematic stories. Soh initially drew up murals centred on general life in Singapore – &quot;Garden Circus&quot;, &quot;The Control Room&quot; and &quot;The Living Room&quot; – the latter two developing into &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;The Family&quot; respectively. &quot;Garden Circus&quot;, which illustrated the &quot;pace of life&quot; in Singapore, was withdrawn as it was considered &quot;not strong enough conceptually&quot;. Soh found inspiration for &quot;The Heartland&quot; on another visit to Bishan. He went on to draft and incorporate elements that he considered timeless so that his work would remain relevant throughout time. Lim also advised Soh to &quot;tone down&quot; his murals to avoid the viewers being &quot;drawn away&quot; from the narratives as Soh kept inserting more features and altering the work. The murals were reproduced digitally and enlarged to fit on the walls. Soh inspected the panels and oversaw the installation in the station, working with the station architects and production team. As a tribute, the artist included depictions of workers with construction hats in &quot;The Heartland&quot;. Soh hoped that the work would &quot;liven up&quot; the plain environment of the station and provide something fresh to the commuters.

=== Art Seats ===
Bishan CCL station includes two sets of Art Seats, which are designed to provide functional pieces of artwork. Two entries, both by Lui Honfay and Yasmine Chan, were selected through the International Art Seats Design Competition in 2006.

&quot;Matrix&quot;, which received the top prize in the international competition, consists of a series of benches engraved on the surface with the station name in a dot-matrix style, which was used because it was flexible enough to be mass-produced for use in many stations. 

&quot;Rain&quot; consists of steel seats in the shape of water puddles in place of the standard stone seats in other MRT stations. The sets&#x27; design was intended to include a &quot;natural element in an abstract matter&quot;.

=== Comic Connect ===
There is also a heritage-themed mural as a part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect. Created by local artist David Liew, the mural depicts the history of Bishan including Kampung San Teng, Peck San Theng Cemetery, secret societies in the area, and festivals celebrated in the cemetery.

==Cultural impact==
Due to it being located on the former burial site of the Peck San Theng, Bishan station is rumoured to be haunted. Tales of headless figures alighting and boarding at the station are locally well-known; one version mentions a ghost sitting in the last car with its severed head on the adjacent seat. Such tales likely originated from the Kwong Wai Siew Peck San Theng columbarium, which now houses 45,000 urns, according to Singapore Paranormal Investigators (SPI). In response to calls and letters from light-night passengers claiming to witness headless ghosts at the station, &quot;The New Paper&quot; investigated these claims in October 1988 but did not find any ghosts. The station&#x27;s operator MRTC, has said the operations and their staff have not been impacted by any sightings but confirmed the station is at the site of the former cemetery.

In April 2005, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; investigated and debunked several accounts of ghosts at Bishan station. One account mentioned a passenger being in a late-night train that did not stop at the station. When the passenger confronted the driver, the driver claimed to witness ghosts at the station when he said he could see more people than could the commuter. The station operator confirmed trains sometimes bypass stations, although usually these trains are empty. The operator added the train could have bypassed the station when it failed to stop &quot;due to a technical fault&quot;. &quot;The Straits Times&quot; article also mentioned a first-hand account from a former civil servant who claimed to have fainted while aboard a train in 1991; she said she felt many groping hands before fainting after the train pulled out of Bishan station. In a field investigation, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; reported no encounters of any ghosts.

<text>Marmaduke is a newspaper comic strip revolving around the Winslow family and their Great Dane, Marmaduke, drawn by Brad Anderson from June 1954 to 2015.

== Publication history ==
The strip was created by Anderson, and sold to the John F. Dille Co. (later known as the National Newspaper Syndicate) in 1954. Anderson said he drew on Laurel and Hardy routines for his ideas. Anderson illustrated the strip, writing it with help from Phil Leeming (1955–1962) and later Dorothy Leeming (1963–1969), and, after August 2, 2004, Anderson&#x27;s son Paul.

The strip on Sundays also has a side feature called &quot;Dog Gone Funny&quot;, in which one or more panels are devoted to dog anecdotes submitted by the fans.

Brad Anderson died on August 30, 2015, at the age of 91, leaving the long-term fate of the strip unknown; strips co-drawn with the help of his son, Paul Anderson, continue to be syndicated.

== Characters ==
* Marmaduke – a messy but lovable Great Dane owned by the Winslow family; he is large even for his breed, and has regularly been drawn as apparently measuring 40 inches (102 cm) and upwards at the withers.

* Phil – patriarch of the Winslow family
* Dottie – matriarch of the Winslow family
* Barbie  – the Winslows&#x27; older child
* Billy  – the Winslows&#x27; younger child
* Mr. and Mrs. Snyder – the Winslows&#x27; neighbors
* King Tut – A Siamese cat, based on Brad Anderson&#x27;s pet, who is Marmaduke&#x27;s nemesis

==Reception==
Brad Anderson won the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Reuben Award for Newspaper Panel Cartoon in 1978, and the George Arents Pioneer Medal for Syracuse University alumni in 1999.

As of 2015, &quot;Marmaduke&quot; continues to be widely syndicated, and is popular with readers. Attempts to cancel &quot;Marmaduke&quot; have drawn protest, such as those by readers of &quot;The Toronto Star&quot; in 1999, of the &quot;Sarasota Herald Tribune&quot; in 2007, and of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; in 1986.

===Criticism===
The strip&#x27;s longevity and perceived monotony have been noted by publications such as &quot;The Onion&quot; and have made it the butt of jokes. It has become &quot;a hot source of retro-ironic-subversive humor.&quot; For example, a blog called &quot;Joe Mathlete Explains Today&#x27;s Marmaduke&quot; deconstructs the strip to offer an alternative explanation for what is happening in the drawing. Another blog called &quot;Marmaduke Can Vote&quot; gives each panel a political slant, while another called &quot;Poignant Marmaduke&quot; changes all the captions to make the comics sad. Additionally, &quot;The Marmaduke Project&quot; re-imagines Marmaduke in other forms.

&quot;The Comic Strip Doctor&quot;, David Malki of &quot;Wondermark&quot; included Marmaduke for analysis of strips he disliked, alongside &quot;Heathcliff&quot;, &quot;Family Circus&quot;, and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Animated series===
Ruby-Spears produced &quot;Marmaduke&quot; segments for the 1980 animated series &quot;Heathcliff&quot;, whose title character was also based on a comic strip character. In this animated version, the male characters were voiced by Paul Winchell and the females were voiced by Russi Taylor.

===Films===

A live-action &quot;Marmaduke&quot; movie, in which the Winslows and their dog move from Kansas to California, was released on June 4, 2010 and received generally negative reviews from critics. The film featured Owen Wilson as the voice of Marmaduke, Lee Pace as Phil Winslow, Judy Greer as Debbie Winslow, Caroline Sunshine as Barbara Winslow, and Finley Jacobsen as Brian Winslow. 

It was announced on the Andrews McMeel website that an animated film adaptation of &quot;Marmaduke&quot; was planned to be released sometime in 2022. The film featured Pete Davidson as Marmaduke, J.K. Simmons as Zeus, Brian Hull as Guy Hilton, Shelby Young as Shantrelle, and David Koechner as Phil Winslow. It was released on Netflix on May 6, 2022 and like the live-action film was panned by critics.

<text>Changi Airport MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station in Changi, Singapore. The station is the terminus of the Changi Airport branch of the East–West Line (EWL); it is operated by SMRT Trains and is built in an east–west orientation. The station directly connects to Terminals 2 and 3 of Changi Airport and serves other airport amenities including the retail complex of Jewel.

A rail connection to the airport had been planned in the 1980s but these plans were shelved due to the low financial viability of such a branch. With increased air traffic to Changi Airport and the proposed construction of Terminal 3 in 1994, the plans were revived. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction began in 1998. Changi Airport station opened on 8 February 2002 with lower passenger demand than expected, but it continues to provide an alternative transport option to the airport. In May 2019, it was announced Changi Airport station would be incorporated into the Thomson–East Coast Line by 2040 as it extends to the airport&#x27;s Terminal 5.

Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, Changi Airport station includes elements that cater to airport travellers such as wider faregates at the platforms. The glass atrium walls at the ends of the station support an illuminated bridge that spans the island platform while allowing maximum sunlight into the station.

==History==
===Early plans===

A direct MRT link to Changi Airport was first announced in March 1976 during the planning of the MRT network. In May 1982, the plans showed an MRT branch to Changi Airport. The branch was to be built after the completion of the initial MRT network. In a 1983 feasibility study, the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) concluded the level of passenger traffic was insufficient to justify such a branch. Plans for the connection were reviewed again in 1984 because the MRT system was built below budget. In 1985, a survey on transport patterns to the airport was conducted by an MRTC consultant team to assess the viability of an airport MRT connection. However, the consultants concluded in January 1986 that the connection was financially unfeasible in the immediate period because travellers preferred to commute to the airport by taxi. In the following year, Communications Minister Yeo Ning Hong announced that the planned spur would be unfeasible despite the completion of Terminal 2.

In March 1989, the Member of Parliament for Changi, Teo Chong Tee, called for the airport extension, saying it would serve the increased passenger demand for the airport. In response, Minister Yeo said an extension would be considered if there were development plans in the Changi area. Otherwise, the low demand might not meet operating costs. In 1991, he stated a connection would only be justified when annual passenger numbers using Changi Airport reached 50 million, and projections said the airport would handle only about 34 million passengers per year at the beginning of the 21st century. The minister also claimed the airport was already well-served by expressways with affordable taxi rates. In 1992, Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan said the government had already reserved the land needed for the possible route.

===Finalisation of rail connection===
In August 1994, the proposal for a rail link was reconsidered after airport use grew by 10% annually, surpassing the previous projections of 6–7%. With plans for a new terminal to manage passenger growth, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) urged the MRTC to reevaluate the proposal as they were concerned the roads serving the new terminal might be insufficient. The CAAS also suggested that the new link be built in tandem with the new terminal. The MRTC opened consultation studies on the airport link, which would branch off from the East–West Line (EWL) at Tanah Merah station but without intermediate stops.

After another feasibility study by the Land Transport Authority (LTA), Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on 15 November 1996 that the branch would be built. The branch, which was projected to be completed in 2001, would run from Tanah Merah station and have an intermediate stop at Somapah (now Expo) to serve the Changi Business Park and the exhibition centre. There were no plans to extend the branch towards the cargo-and-engineering complexes due to low demand in the area. Teo, who had been advocating for the branch since 1987, was &quot;overjoyed&quot; and considered the announcement an &quot;excellent piece of news&quot;.

===Construction and opening===
In October 1998, the contract for the construction of Changi Airport station was awarded to a joint venture between Kumagai Gumi and Sembawang Engineering and Construction for . The contract included the construction of the station and associated tunnels, a new baggage tunnel between Terminals 2 and 3, and a new vehicular underpass to serve Terminal 3. CPG Consultants, which was designing Terminal 3, provided 20 staff to assist the LTA team on the line extension.

A groundbreaking ceremony was held on 29 January 1999. Speaking at the ceremony, Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan said the station&#x27;s construction would require close collaboration between stakeholders such as the LTA, CAAS and the contractors. As the station was built in a sensitive area, top-down construction works had to be carefully planned to limit disruption to airport operations. Close monitoring was required to construct the tunnels leading to the station, which pass directly beneath the runway and airport terminal.

The roads connecting to the arrival and departure halls of Terminals 1 and 2 were rerouted west of the station site during the construction. The east side of the station was constructed first due to more complex deep excavation works near developments such as Terminal 2. Extensive foundation reconstruction was required for the overrun tunnels as they passed through an irregular pile layout beyond the east side of the station. The LTA dismissed the idea of mining the tunnels as the works were in shallow ground. Instead, open-cut excavation within diaphragm walls and ground treatment methods were adopted.

As part of the President&#x27;s Challenge 2001, part of the charity walk went through the tunnel between Expo and Changi Airport stations. Changi Airport MRT station opened on 8 February 2002, and the official opening ceremony for the line extension was held at the station on 27 February 2002. When the station opened, passenger traffic has been moderate because bus transportation continued to be a popular means of cheap, direct transport for local airport and airline employees, and for travellers not living along the EWL. Many air travellers preferred to continue taking taxis or private transport because not all of the trains on the MRT had luggage racks. Taxi drivers said the station put them at a disadvantage, reporting a loss of 20% in earnings within the first month of station operations. At that time, the station had a daily ridership of 20,500 commuters. Despite developments built around the branch line to boost further ridership, it was not deemed cost-effective to run through services to the MRT, and hence, since 2003, the branch was instead served by a shuttle service running from Tanah Merah to Changi Airport.

===Incorporation into the TEL===
The possibility of extending the Eastern Region Line to Changi Airport via the airport&#x27;s Terminal 4 was first announced by LTA in May 2013 when Terminal 4 was under construction. The extension would have provided a more direct connection from the airport to the city. The Eastern Region Line was later merged into the Thomson–East Coast Line (TEL) in August 2014, and Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in July 2016 the TEL extension to the airport might be completed at the same time as Terminal 5. On 25 May 2019, the LTA confirmed that the Changi Airport branch line will become part of the TEL when it is extended to Changi Airport from Sungei Bedok station via Terminal 5. This extension is expected to be completed in 2040.

The contract for the construction of twin-bored tunnels from Changi Airport station to Changi Airport Terminal 5 was awarded to Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd for S$321.7 million (US$ million). Construction required tunnelling under a closed runway east of Terminal 2, which was completed in November 2022. On 29 April 2024, the LTA called a tender to modify the existing station, along with Tanah Merah and Expo stations, in preparation to integrate them into the TEL.

==Details==
===Services===
Changi Airport station is served by the Changi Airport Branch of the EWL, which connects to the airport from Tanah Merah station as a shuttle service. The official station code is CG2, which changed from EW29. The next station towards Tanah Merah is Expo station. Being part of the EWL, the station is operated by SMRT Trains. Changi Airport station is planned to be served by the TEL when the line extends to the airport in 2040. Changi Airport station is located underneath Airport Boulevard and between Terminals 2 and 3 of the airport. The station also serves various airport amenities including Airport Police Division, Jewel Changi Airport and Crowne Plaza Hotel.

When the station first opened in 2002, it was served by a through service from Boon Lay station. On 22 July 2003, this service changed to a shuttle service in which trains from Changi Airport station terminated at Tanah Merah station. The station is open from 5:10 am to 12:10 am. The first train departs from Changi Airport station at 5:31am on weekdays and Saturdays, and at 5:59am on Sundays. The day&#x27;s last train departs from the airport at 12:06am. From Tanah Merah station, the day&#x27;s first train towards Changi Airport station departs at 5:20am on weekdays and Saturdays, and at 5:47am on Sundays, and the day&#x27;s last train towards the airport from Tanah Merah station departs at 11:50pm. Headways between trains vary from 7 to 13 minutes.

===Design===
Changi Airport station is wide and long, and was constructed at a depth of . The station, aligned in an east-west direction, has crossover tracks at its west and overrun tunnels beyond the east side of the station. American architectural firm Skidmore, Owings and Merrill designed the station, which include multiple design elements catering to airport travellers. The station has wide faregates for commuters with luggage. These faregates, which are located on the same level as the platforms, also allow easier access for wheelchair users. Changi Airport station was one of the first MRT stations to be wheelchair-accessible when it was first built, with lifts and ramps for barrier-free access. A tactile flooring system, consisting of tiles with raised, rounded-or-elongated studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station.

The station is columnless but supported by platform-edge pillars each spaced apart and an external diaphragm and lining wall along each length of the station. At the station&#x27;s two entrances are glass atrium walls that support an illuminated, bridge spanning the island platform. The glass bridge allows unpaid transfer between the two terminals. At either end of the station is an atrium measuring approximately long by high. The glazing system and tensioned-cable network of the glass atria were structurally designed by engineering company Meinhardt Facades, with engineering input from Ove Arup and Partners.

The glass atria allow maximum sunlight into the station. The roof is supported only at its northern and southern ends, and a massive spine beam spine runs between the north and south. The spine is supported by a staggered structure made of reinforced concrete at one end and an A-frame column and stability truss at the other end. The facade panels are hung from vertical trusses at the end of each cantilever, and are supported by other cables that run diagonally and horizontally. The station design was awarded the 2004 American Architecture Award by Chicago Athenaeum.

<text>Boon Lay MRT station is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East West line (EWL) in Jurong West, Singapore. Situated along Boon Lay Way, the station is integrated with the Boon Lay Bus Interchange and Jurong Point as part of the Boon Lay Integrated Transport Hub. Other landmarks surrounding the station include the SAFRA Clubhouse and Jurong West Public Library.

Initially announced as Jurong West MRT station, the station was briefly shelved before the decision was reversed in August 1987. The EWL station opened on 6 July 1990 and was the last station to be completed on the initial MRT network. It was the terminus of the EWL until the line&#x27;s extension to station in 2009. In May 2018, it was announced that the station would be an interchange with the Jurong Region line when the first stage opens in 2027.

==History==
The station, then named Jurong West, was included in the early plans of the MRT network in May 1982, and would have been built as part of Phase II of the initial MRT system. In March 1986, however, the MRT Corporation (MRTC) said the station was shelved due to delays with Housing Development Board&#x27;s (HDB) development plans for the area. The telecommunications cables and antenna farms in the area had to be relocated to facilitate the expansion of Jurong West new town, which was estimated to take six years. As the HDB decided to proceed with development plans after an agreement with Telecoms for them to vacate the site, the MRTC decided on 7 August 1987 to construct the station.

The contract for the construction of Boon Lay station and of viaducts was awarded to a joint venture between RSEA International and Hock Lian Seng Engineering in May 1988 for S$34.19million (US$ million in 2021). The last viaduct beam between Boon Lay and Lakeside was laid on 12 August 1989, marking the end of viaduct works for the initial MRT system. On 10 March 1990, it was announced that the station would open on 6 July. Before the station&#x27;s opening, the Boon Lay Bus Interchange opened on 1 July to allow more convenient transfers between transport modes. The completion of the initial MRT system and the station&#x27;s opening was celebrated at a ceremony in Westin Stamford at Raffles City.

In 2002, new drop-offs and pick-up points were built at the station as many people were parking or stopping along Jurong West Street 64. In 2012, half-height platform screen doors was installed at this station as part of the Land Transport Authority&#x27;s (LTA) programme to improve safety in MRT stations. High-volume low-speed fans were installed above the platforms of the station between 2012 and 2013 as part of a national programme to improve ventaliation at station platforms.

Plans for an MRT extension to Tuas or the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) was first announced in 1994. The Boon Lay MRT Extension (BLE) was finalised in December 2004 to serve increased transport demand in Jurong Industrial Estate. Following its completion on 28 February 2009, it was reported that the BLE had relieved crowding at the station as some private bus operators had shifted operations to Joo Koon station.

===Jurong Region line===

On 9 May 2018, the LTA announced Boon Lay station will interchange with the proposed Jurong Region line (JRL). The station will be constructed as part of Stage 1 (JRL West), consisting of 10 stations from Choa Chu Kang to Bahar Junction and two branches to and this station. This stage was expected to be completed in 2026. However, restrictions on construction due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to delays, with the completion date pushed to 2027.

The contract for the design and construction of Boon Lay JRL station and associated viaducts was awarded to China Communications Construction Company Limited (Singapore Branch) for S$172 million (US$ million) in February 2020.

To facilitate the JRL construction, road diversion works for Jurong West Street 64 began in June 2022, alongside the relocation of a bicycle park near the station. Piling works were carried out from August to December 2022. A temporary protection enclosure was installed over the EWL tracks. The assembly of viaduct segments commenced in February 2023.

==Station details==
Boon Lay station serves the EWL and is between the and stations. The station code is EW27. Being part of the EWL, the station is operated by SMRT Trains. Boon Lay station will be a future interchange with the JRL, located between the and stations. The EWL station is located along Boon Lay Way while the JRL station is along Jurong West Street 64.

<doc id="1159104" wikidata="Q254212" url="?curid=1159104" title="Pasir Ris MRT station">
<text>Pasir Ris MRT station () is an elevated Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the East West line (EWL) in Pasir Ris, Singapore. Situated along Pasir Ris Central adjacent to Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, Pasir Ris Mall and the White Sands Shopping Mall, it is the eastern terminus of the EWL. The station exterior has the characteristic dome-shaped segmented roof also seen on other elevated EWL stations.

The station opened on 16 December 1989 as the terminus of the MRT&#x27;s eastern line extension. In 2016, two maintenance workers were run over and killed on the tracks away from the station. In January 2019, it was announced that the station would be an interchange with the Cross Island line (CRL) when the first stage opens in 2030. The station is also planned to be the terminus for the future CRL branch extension to Punggol station in 2032, as announced in March 2020. The CRL station will be the deepest MRT station on the network at underground..

==History==

The station was constructed as the terminus of an extension of the East West MRT line from Tanah Merah station, which in turn was part of Phase 2A of the MRT system. The contract for the construction of the stations from Changi Depot to Pasir Ris and of tracks was awarded to Sato Kogyo Pte Ltd at a contract sum of S$91.89 million (US$ million) in March 1986. The contract also included the construction of the Tampines and Simei stations.

The station opened on 16 December 1989 as the eastern terminus of the EWL as announced by then-deputy prime minister Goh Chok Tong on 4 November that year. The opening ceremony, officiated by then-Minister of State Mah Bow Tan, included an MRT ride for Mah and four other Members of Parliament from Simei to this station. The station opening was generally well received by residents in Tampines and Pasir Ris, who were hoping for quicker rides to their workplaces in the city via the MRT.

===EWL station upgrades===

Like the other elevated MRT stations, Pasir Ris station did not initially have platform screen doors installed. On 25 January 2008, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced the installation half-height platform screen doors on elevated stations to improve safety on elevated stations. The installation began at Pasir Ris station in August 2009 and the doors began operations later in November. High-volume low-speed fans were installed above the platforms of the station between 2012 and 2013 as part of a national programme to improve ventaliation at station platforms.

On 29 June 2018, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that the EWL overrun viaducts would be extended by . A new crossover, in conjunction with the implementation of communications-based train control (CBTC), will allow faster turnarounds for trains and segregation of platforms at the terminus. The station&#x27;s operations will be unaffected by the works as the enhancement works will be done away from the station itself. In March 2019, the contract for the construction of new overrun and crossover tracks was awarded to China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Branch Office Singapore / Gates PCM Construction Ltd (JV). The S$56.7 million (US$ million) contract included the partial removal of existing overrun tracks. Construction commenced in 2019 and was completed in May 2024. Currently only off service trains uses the Turnback tracks.

===Cross Island Line===
On 17 January 2013, transport minister Lui Tuck Yew announced that the proposed Cross Island line (CRL) will serve the Pasir Ris area. On 25 January 2019, the LTA confirmed that Pasir Ris station will be an interchange with the CRL. The CRL station will be constructed as part of Phase 1, consisting of 12 stations between Aviation Park and Bright Hill, and was expected to be completed in 2029. On 10 March 2020, it was announced that this station will serve as the eastern terminus for the CRL extension to Punggol station. The Punggol extension, consisting of four stations between this station and Punggol, was expected to be completed in 2031. However, the restrictions imposed on construction works due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to delays and the dates was pushed by one year to 2030 and 2032 for CRL1 and CRLe respectively.

The contract for the design and construction of Pasir Ris CRL Station and associated tunnels was awarded to a joint venture between Daewoo Engineering &amp; Construction Co Ltd and Dongah Geological Engineering Co Ltd Singapore Branch at S$980 million (US$ million) on 26 April 2021. Construction was scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of 2021, with expected completion in 2030. On 8 October 2023, a part of Pasir Ris Drive 1 between Pasir Ris Drive 8 and Pasir Ris Central was closed off to facilitate the construction of the station.

On 16 January 2024, a grab bucket toppled at the CRL site, resulting in damage to the noise barrier panel adjacent to the HDB block near the site. The compromised panel was removed and a professional engineer confirmed the stability of the remaining structure. No workers were injured, although the LTA had called for a safety time-out to review safety practices at the site.
===Incident===

On 22 March 2016, two SMRT maintenance trainees were run over and killed by an oncoming C151 train at around 11:10am. They were part of a team of 15 personnel tasked to investigate a possible signaling system fault, after a high voltage alarm set off. The incident took place at the track switch away from the station. This led to a 2.5-hour train service disruption from 11:10 am to 1:56 pm for train services between Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah, and had affected at least 10,000 commuters.

After an internal investigation, SMRT sacked both the engineer who led the track team and the train driver and also disciplined the staff involved for their role in the incident. The sacking of both employees attracted online controversy, with Singaporeans on social media questioning whether it was fair to sack the train driver. SMRT Trains, the director of control operations and the SMRT engineer who led the track team were charged for the incident. Upon investigation, it was revealed that safety protocols were not implemented that would have prevented the train from entering the worksite.

The engineer who led the inspection team was charged with negligence causing death under the Penal Code and was subsequently sentenced to 4 weeks in jail. SMRT Trains and one member of SMRT management were charged for violating the Workplace Safety and Health Act for lapses which led to the accident, and were fined $400,000 respectively. and $55,000. On 20 July 2018, the Land Transport Authority fined the operator S$1.9 million (US$ million) for this incident and the Bishan tunnel flooding.

==Details==
===Location===
As the name suggests, the station serves the town of Pasir Ris. The station is adjacent to the White Sands Shopping Mall, Pasir Ris Mall and the Pasir Ris Bus Interchange, and is close to prominent landmarks such as the Pasir Ris Town Park, Pasir Ris Sports and Recreation Centre, Pasir Ris Park and the retail development of Downtown East.

The station is planned to serve a mixed-use commercial and residential development that will integrate with the bus interchange, a polyclinic and a town plaza. The site for the development has been awarded to Phoenix Residential Pte. Ltd. &amp; Phoenix Commercial Pte. Ltd.for S$700 million (US$ million) in March 2019.

===Services===
As of June 2021, Pasir Ris is the eastern terminus of the EWL. The next station on the line is Tampines station. The official station code is EW1. When it opened, it had the station code of E12 before being changed to its current station code in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System. The station operates between 5:28am and 11:23pm. Train frequencies range from 2 to 5 minutes depending on peak hours.

When the CRL Phase 1 and the Punggol extension are completed, the station will be between the Pasir Ris East and Tampines North stations on the mainline. The CRL will branch off from this station to Punggol station via the adjacent Elias station.

===Design===

Like most EWL elevated stations on the eastern segment on the line (after Kallang station), Pasir Ris station has a prominent dome-shaped roof, segmented like a caterpillar, over the platform level. The design was intended by the MRT Corporation to give the stations on the EWL an &quot;attractive look&quot;. The station has a pink colour scheme, reflected on the doors to the restricted areas and the ceiling trunking box at the platform level of the station.

The CRL station will have a depth of , making it the deepest MRT station when completed.

=== Comic Connect ===
As part of SMRT&#x27;s Comic Connect – a public art showcase of heritage-themed murals, the station displays a mural &quot;Memories of Pasir Ris&quot; which depict various historic icons of Pasir Ris. These include a single-door bus route serving Pasir Ris and Tampines, the Worker&#x27;s Brigade (Singapore&#x27;s &quot;army without guns&quot; formed in 1959), the mosaic elephant playground, the Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple, Pasir Ris Hotel, and the Golden Palace Holiday Resort. Also depicted are the local wildlife of birds which inhabit the beaches of Pasir Ris.

<doc id="1159106" wikidata="Q2292422" url="?curid=1159106" title="Marina Bay MRT station">
<text>Marina Bay MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North South (NSL), Circle (CCL) and Thomson–East Coast (TEL) lines in Singapore. Located in the Downtown Core district near Marina Bay, the station serves the Marina One Residences, Marina Bay Suites and the Marina Bay Financial Centre.

Marina Bay station was one of the last stations to be completed in the early phases of the construction of the MRT network, opening on 4 November 1989. It was the terminus of the NSL until the line&#x27;s extension to Marina South Pier station in 2014. The station became an interchange station with the CCL upon the completion of the two-station branch extension from Promenade station in January 2012. The TEL station platforms were completed in November 2022 as part of TEL Stage 3, becoming a triple-line interchange on the MRT network.

The station features numerous works of art as part of the MRT network&#x27;s Art-in-Transit programme. An overhanging flower sculpture &quot;Flowers in Blossom II&quot; is displayed over the CCL mezzanine. The CCL platforms feature a series of photographs &quot;Train Rides on Rainy Days&quot; by Nah Yong En and the TEL station features a series of murals &quot;Walking into The Interstitial&quot; by Tang Ling Nah.

==History==
===North South Line===

The station was named Marina South in the early plans of the MRT network published in May 1982. Confirmation that the station would be among the Phase I stations (from Ang Mo Kio to this station) came in November that year alongside a name change to Marina Bay. This segment was given priority as it passed through areas that had a higher demand for public transport, such as the densely populated housing estates of Toa Payoh and Ang Mo Kio and the Central Area. The line aimed to relieve the traffic congestion on the Thomson–Sembawang road corridor.

Contract 310 for the construction of the cut-and-cover connecting tunnels, as well as Marina Bay MRT station, was awarded to a joint venture between Gammon and Antara Koh at a value of in April 1986. The main challenges of the construction included tunnelling underneath the Telok Ayer Basin and building the station and tunnels in soft soil. Due to the soft marine clay, open excavation was not possible. Divers had to cut the trenches for the MRT tunnels in zero visibility and very muddy water. A concrete base for the tunnels was then laid with the water pumped out, upon which the tunnels and the station were to be built. The tunnels were then covered with another layer of concrete before the seabed was refilled. During the construction, a World War II-era bomb was found at the work site and was safely detonated elsewhere by the Singapore Armed Forces Bomb Disposal Unit.

The station opened on 4 November 1989 and was the southern terminus of the North South line (NSL) until the extension to Marina South Pier station opened in 2014. On 8 January 2006, this station was one of the four stations that participated in Exercise Northstar V, a large-scale emergency preparedness exercise.

===Circle Line===
An extension of the Circle line (CCL) to this station was first announced in April 2007. Contract 901 for the construction and completion of Marina Bay CCL station was awarded to Hock Lian Seng Infrastructure Pte. Ltd. for in February 2008. The scope also included addition and alteration works to the existing NSL station, road diversions of the East Coast Parkway and Marina Street and the demolition of a vehicular underpass. Construction of the station started in February 2008 and was completed on schedule by January 2012.

During the construction, Exit A of the station had to be relocated for construction works for the Circle line station. As announced on 28 November 2011, the station opened on 14 January 2012 as part of the two-station, extension from Promenade, with an opening ceremony the day before.

On 17 January 2013, transport minister Lui Tuck Yew announced that the CCL would be extended from Marina Bay station to HarbourFront station as part of CCL Stage 6. Contract 886 for the construction of cut-and-cover tunnels at Marina Bay Area between the Prince Edward and Marina Bay stations was awarded to Koh Brothers Building &amp; Civil Engineering Contractor (Pte.) Ltd. at in September 2017. Construction began in 2017, and was expected to be completed by 2025. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, the completion date was pushed to 2026.
===Thomson–East Coast Line===

On 29 August 2012, it was announced that Marina Bay station would interchange with the 22-station Thomson line (TSL). Contract T226 for the design and construction of Marina Bay TSL Station and associated tunnels was awarded to Taisei Corporation for S$425 million (US$ million) in February 2014. Construction started in 2014, with an expected completion date in 2021.

On 15 August 2014, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) announced that TSL would merge with the Eastern Region line to form the Thomson–East Coast line(TEL). Marina Bay station was constructed as part of Phase 3, consisting of 13 stations between the Mount Pleasant and Gardens by the Bay stations. Ground freezing was applied for the first time in Singapore rail construction when building the TEL stacked tunnels and platforms, where it crosses underneath the existing NSL and CCL tunnels. This was due to the layers of weak and strong old alluvium, which do not allow effective ground treatment of the soil. The construction of tunnels also involved close monitoring of the existing train tunnels, especially as the piles supporting the NSL tunnels had to be cut off for the underground walkways and mined train tunnels.

With restrictions imposed on construction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the TEL3 completion date was pushed back a year to 2022. On 9 March 2022, Transport Minister S. Iswaran announced in Parliament that TEL 3 would open in the second half of that year. As confirmed during a visit by Iswaran at the and stations on 7 October 2022, the TEL station began operations on 13 November 2022.

==Details==
===Location===
Marina Bay station is located near the eponymous Marina Bay underneath the junction of Bayfront Avenue and Park Street. The station serves various developments, including Asia Square Towers 1 &amp; 2, Marina One Residencies, Marina Bay Financial Centre, Singapore Conference Hall and V on Shenton, as well as cultural landmarks such as Red Dot Museum, Shenton House and Singapore Chinese Cultural Centre. The station is also within walking distance of Downtown station on the Downtown line.

===Services===
Marina Bay station is an interchange station on the NSL, CCL and TEL. Its official station codes are NS27/CE2/TE20. When it opened, it had the station code of M1 before being changed to the current alphanumeric style in August 2001 as a part of a system-wide campaign to cater to the expanding MRT System.

On the NSL, the station is located between Raffles Place and Marina South Pier stations. The NSL platform is open from 5:37 am and closed at 12:15 am.

The station is the terminus of the CCL&#x27;s Marina Bay branch; the adjacent station is Bayfront station. Services from Marina Bay terminate at Stadium station during off-peak periods but continue around the CCL to HarbourFront station during peak. The CCL platform is open from 5:49 am and closed at 12:15 am.

The station is between the Shenton Way and Gardens by the Bay stations on the TEL, with headways of 3–6 minutes. The TEL platform is open from 5:45 am and closed at 12:40 am.

===Design===

Marina Bay station on the NSL was among the first nine underground MRT stations designated as a Civil Defence shelter. As such, the station is structurally reinforced against bomb attacks with layers of earth-backed, air-backed and airtight walls and slabs. Like many stations on the initial MRT network, Marina Bay NSL station has an island platform. The TEL station has a stacked platform layout. The lower platform is built at a depth of .

Aedas and Quarry Bay designed the CCL station around the concepts of visibility, integration and efficiency. Consequently, the station&#x27;s entrances are integrated with the park around it. A closed maintenance facility near the station is to be converted to a future underground pedestrian network connecting future developments around the station. The tracks leading to the defunct facility were removed in June 2021.

The translucent entrance canopy and the large CCL entrance are intended to maximise the amount of natural light entering the station. Only the lift, escalators, the lightweight ETFE canopy and the reflective pool are visible from street level; this reduces the station&#x27;s aesthetic impact on the park&#x27;s landscape while giving passengers a full view of the park from the station entrance. The reflective pool was also intended to provide a smooth transition between the exits and the park.

The station&#x27;s design was shortlisted for the Small Project Award at the World Architecture Festival in 2012. The station received numerous other awards, such as the Land Transport Excellence Awards 2012 (as the Best Design Rail / Road Infrastructure – Project Partner), the 2013 UIPT Asia-Pacific Grow with Public Transport Award and an honourable mention for the Singapore Institute of Architects Architectural Design Awards 2012.

The station is wheelchair-accessible. A tactile system, consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station, with dedicated tactile routes connecting the station entrances to the platforms. Wider fare gates allow wheelchair users to access the station more easily. The TEL station also has green building features including inbuilt solar panels to minimise energy consumption.

==Artworks==
===&quot;August 9 babies&quot;===

&quot;August 9 babies&quot;, a gallery of 50 photographs by Tay Kay Chin, was commissioned in advance of the 50th National Day, the anniversary of Singapore&#x27;s founding. The work was initially created as a tribute to Singapore&#x27;s 40th anniversary with only 40 photographs, as an answer to Tay&#x27;s personal question of what it means to be a Singaporean. The 40 photographs were of Singaporeans born on National Day, and Tay wondered if people born on that day have a stronger sense of patriotism.

With this background, the LTA approached him to update the collection of photographs for the country&#x27;s 50th National Day. Tay revisited some of the people he had photographed; he said the most rewarding part was how much they had changed since, especially regarding their aspirations and challenges in living in Singapore. The work took inspiration from Brian Lanker&#x27;s &quot;I Dream a World&quot; and Ron Kovic&#x27;s &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;, both a compilation of portraits. The subjects of the expanded project were chosen based on their gender, ethnicity and occupation, representing Singapore&#x27;s diverse demographics.

===&quot;Flowers in Blossom II&quot;===
The sculpture &quot;Flowers in Blossom&quot;, by Tay Chee Toh, was originally hung underneath the dome of Orchard station. Described as a &quot;colourful twirl&quot; of metal and plastic shapes, the sculpture was disassembled after the ION Orchard shopping mall was constructed over Orchard station. The recreated version, known as &quot;Flowers in Blossom II&quot;, is larger than the original version and was intended as a homage to the public artwork project predating the Art-in-Transit programme.

===&quot;Train Rides on Rainy Days&quot;===
&quot;Train Rides on Rainy Days&quot; by Nah Yong En is a series of fourteen raindrop pictures displayed at the CCL platform. One side is themed to greenery, while the other reflects &#x27;blue evenings&#x27;, contrasting with the orange pillars of the station. The raindrops in each picture produce inverted images of the area depicted. Intended to bring &quot;a refreshing element of nature&quot; into the underground station, the work represents scenes seen by commuters as they gaze out of the window from a train whenever it rains.

Nah had originally used the photographs as guides for his own paintings displayed at his graduation ceremony. The LTA architect Andrew Mead then recommended to the Art Review Panel that the station use Nah&#x27;s set of photos. According to Nah, the work came from his fascination with looking out of the trains&#x27; windows, which he said not many commuters do. The photographs for this project were reshot in higher quality using a new camera that could capture the raindrop up close, allowing it to look sharp against the blurred background. Nah&#x27;s main issue was taking the pictures under the right lighting conditions. The buildings would appear dark under rainy clouds if his camera was exposed to the sky, but the sky would appear washed out if the buildings were shot under better lighting conditions. To obtain the appropriate balance of light, Nah took his images during the short period after rain stopped falling.

These photographs were taken along the North South and East West lines. Initially, Nah&#x27;s two paintings at the graduation ceremony were to be displayed with his raindrop images. However, the Art Review Panel felt the paintings did not complement the photographs well, so they were replaced by two additional images.

===&quot;Walking into The Interstitial&quot;===
&quot;Walking into The Interstitial&quot; by Tang Ling Nah is a collection of charcoal drawings scanned and printed on vitreous enamel panels. The drawings depict various urban transitional spaces, including alleys, corridors and void decks. They were merged to form surrealistic murals with the trompe l&#x27;oeil effect, giving the impression of a larger space. These scenes were derived from Shenton Way, Cecil Street and Raffles Place, thus connecting the old financial district of Shenton Way with the new financial district of Marina Bay.

<doc id="1159107" wikidata="Q774073" url="?curid=1159107" title="Pangio">
<text>Pangio is a genus of small Asian freshwater fish in the true loach family Cobitidae. In earlier taxonomic schemes it was known as &quot;Acanthophthalmus&quot;. The &quot;kuhli loach&quot; is well-known in the aquarium trade and commonly identified as &quot;P. kuhlii&quot;, but most individuals actually appear to be &quot;P. semicincta&quot;.

The type species is &quot;Cobitis cinnamomea&quot; , now known as &quot;Pangio pangia&quot;.

These fish are best represented in Southeast Asia where all but five of the species live, including the Greater Sunda Islands with sixteen species. The five species found outside Southeast Asia are from India and Myanmar. They inhabit a wide range of mostly calm waters such as streams, swamps (often peat swamps) and backwaters, but there are also species in fast-flowing waters, and one, &quot;P. bhujia&quot;, lives underground.

==Species==

There are currently 35 recognized species in this genus:

* &quot;Pangio agma&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio alcoides&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio alternans&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio ammophila&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio anguillaris&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio apoda&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio atactos&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio bhujia&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio bitaimac&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio cuneovirgata&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio doriae&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio elongata&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio filinaris&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio fusca&quot; 
* &quot;Pangio goaensis&quot; (Indian coolie-loach)

<doc id="1159108" wikidata="Q868511" url="?curid=1159108" title="Fire-and-forget">
<text>Fire-and-forget is a type of missile guidance which does not require further external intervention after launch such as illumination of the target or wire guidance, and can hit its target without the launcher being in line-of-sight of the target. This is an important property for a guided weapon to have, since a person or vehicle that lingers near the target to guide the missile (using, for instance, a laser designator) is vulnerable to attack and unable to carry out other tasks.

Generally, information about the target is programmed into the missile just prior to launch. This can include coordinates, radar measurements (including velocity), or an infrared image of the target. After it is fired, the missile guides itself by some combination of gyroscopes and accelerometers, GPS, onboard active radar homing, infrared homing optics, and anti-radiation homing. Some systems offer the option of either continued input from the launch platform or fire-and-forget.

Fire-and-forget missiles can be vulnerable to soft-kill systems on modern main battle tanks, in addition to existing hard-kill systems. As opposed to unguided RPGs which require a hard-kill system (a counter projectile(s) used to destroy the incoming missile), fire-and-forget missiles can often be jammed by means such as electro-optical dazzlers.

==Examples==
Many of these are infrared homing missiles; some of the remainder (e.g. AIM-120) are active radar guided.

<doc id="1159117" wikidata="Q596135" url="?curid=1159117" title="Designated survivor">
<text>In the United States, a designated survivor (or designated successor) is a person in the presidential line of succession who is kept distant from others in the line when they are gathered together, to reduce the chance that everyone in the line will be unable to take over the presidency in a catastrophic or mass-casualty event. The person is chosen to stay at an undisclosed secure location, away from such events such as State of the Union addresses and presidential inaugurations. The designation of a survivor is intended to prevent the decapitation of the government and to safeguard continuity in the presidency if the president, the vice president, and others in the presidential line of succession die. The procedure began in the 1950s, during the Cold War, with the idea that a nuclear attack could kill government officials and the U.S. government would collapse.

In such an event, the surviving official highest in the line of succession in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, who might be the designated survivor, would become acting president of the United States. The designated survivor must be eligible to serve as president. The designated survivor usually is a member of the president&#x27;s Cabinet and is chosen by the president.

Being the designated survivor does not guarantee that this official will be the person to assume the presidency in such a situation. For the 2010 State of the Union address, Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, was the designated survivor, but Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also was absent from the address, for a conference in London; had a calamity occurred, Clinton, not Donovan, would have become acting president, because her office was higher in the line of succession.

Congress also designates members of the Senate and House (one from each party) to become congressional &quot;designated survivors&quot; to maintain the existence of Congress in a mass-casualty event.

==Selection==
In a 2016 interview, Jon Favreau, a speechwriter for President Barack Obama, said that the procedure for picking a designated survivor for a State of the Union address was &quot;entirely random&quot;, but later clarified that the content of the speech played a role in who was permitted to be absent. Favreau said that for a State of the Union address in which Obama&#x27;s education policy was a major focus, for example, the secretary of education, Arne Duncan, was not chosen as the designated survivor, because it was thought that he should attend and represent his department.

<text>The Polish Border Guard (Polish: Straż Graniczna, also abbreviated as SG) is a state security agency tasked with patrolling the Polish border. It existed in the Second Republic era from 1928 to 1939 and was reestablished in the modern-day Third Republic in 1990, going into operation the following year. During the communist era lasting from 1945 to 1989, the role of the border guard was carried out by the Border Protection Troops ().

==History==
=== 1928–1939 ===
The Straż Graniczna was founded in 1928. During the times of the Second Polish Republic, it was responsible for the northern, western and southern border of Poland (with Germany, the Free City of Danzig, the maritime border, Czechoslovakia and Romania). The eastern border, often raided by military bands supported by the Soviet Union, was under the jurisdiction of a separate, military formation (Border Protection Corps, ).

Responsibilities of Straż Graniczna included:
* prevention of illegal crossing of the land and sea border by people and goods (smuggling)
* ensuring safety and public order in the border area
* combating any threats to national security in the border area

The Border Guard was organized in a military style, with uniformed and armed agents. It was controlled by the Ministry of Treasury, Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Ministry of Military Affairs. The highest level of organizational structure of the agency was Main Headquarters (), based in Warsaw. It was followed by Regional Inspectorates, Border Inspectorates, stations and posts. It carried out actions through patrols, manning border checkpoints, tracking, rouses and intelligence work. It had its own river and sea flotilla, intelligence academy, and the Main School of Border Guard (), which was located firstly in Góra Kalwaria (until 1928), then in Rawa Ruska. The school had a department of training of guard dogs, also located in Rawa Ruska.

Each station of the agency was responsible for some 20 to 25 kilometers of the borderline. The stations oversaw posts of the first line and posts of the second line. In 1938, there were 129 stations of the Border Guard, 419 posts of the first line (these were located right along the border), and 212 posts of the second line (located in the interior of the country, right behind posts of the first line).

===Regional inspectorates in 1939===
* Mazovian Regional Inspectorate in Ciechanów,
* Pomeranian Regional Inspectorate in Bydgoszcz,
* Greater Poland Regional Inspectorate in Poznań,
* Silesian Regional Inspectorate in Katowice,
* Western Lesser Poland Regional Inspectorate in Kraków,
* Eastern Lesser Poland Regional Inspectorate in Lwów.
* Agency of the Customs Inspectorate of the Free City of Gdańsk.

In late 1938 and early 1939, following changes of borders of some Eastern European countries, the Border Guard took over protection of the boundary with Lithuania, while Border Defence Corps moved some of its units to the newly established border with Hungary. Furthermore, every station of the Border Guard was strengthened with a platoon of the Polish Land Forces.

Members of Straż Graniczna, under General Walerian Czuma, participated in the Second World War, fighting during the invasion of Poland together with Land Forces units.

=== 1945–1989 ===
During the period of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, the role of the border guards was carried out by the military formation of Border Protection Troops (), being a part of the Polish People&#x27;s Army and reporting directly to the Ministry of Interior, formerly under the Ministry of National Defense (from 1945 to 1949 and again from 1965 to 1970 and 1972), just as its 2nd Republic predecessors were assigned. After martial law, border battalions were reconstructed. Battalions were re-established in Sanok, Nowy Targ, Cieszyn, Racibórz, Prudnik, Zgorzelec, Gubin, Słubice and Chojna. The organization of battalions in Nowy Sącz, Lubań Śląski and Szczecin was stopped at the stage of the backbone commands. These were later disbanded.

===1990 – present===
Straż Graniczna has been reestablished in the Third Polish Republic as a civil, police-type service, with the act of 12 October 1990 and began operations on 16 May 1991. It considers itself the successor to the Second Polish Republic formations of the Straż Graniczna and Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza (plus the military heritage of the Wojska Ochrony Pogranicza of the People&#x27;s Republic), and thus is one of the only police-styled forces to use military-style ranks (the Government Protection Bureau, Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Wewnętrznego and the Służba Więzienna also use them as well).

From 1 May 2004, the day Poland became a member of the European Union, Straż Graniczna has performed its responsibility to guard and protect both the Polish and EU borders.

<text>Chinatown MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) interchange station on the North East (NEL) and Downtown (DTL) lines in Outram, Singapore. It serves the ethnic enclave of Chinatown. Situated at the junction of Eu Tong Sen Street, New Bridge Road and Upper Cross Street, the station is near several landmarks, including the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Masjid Jamae (Chulia), Chinatown Point and People&#x27;s Park Complex.

First announced as People&#x27;s Park MRT station in March 1996, the NEL station was one of the most challenging projects undertaken during that line&#x27;s construction. It involved multiple diversions of the main roads and the Eu Tong Sen Canal, in addition to the preservation of the Garden Bridge. The NEL station was completed on 20 June 2003. In March 2007, it was announced that the NEL will interchange with the DTL at this station. The DTL platforms of the station opened on 22 December 2013 as part of Stage 1 of the line.

Each of the six entrances has glass structures, with the Pagoda Street entrance having a pavilion-style transparent roof structure and the DTL entrance having an elliptical shape. The station features two artworks as part of the MRT network&#x27;s Art-in-Transit programme. The NEL concourse and platforms feature calligraphy as part of &quot;The Phoenix&#x27;s-Eye Domain&quot; by Tan Swie Hian, while the DTL concourse walls feature artworks of clothes lines as part of &quot;Flying Colours&quot; by Cheo Chai Hiang.

==History==
===North East line station (1996–2003)===

Chinatown station was first announced as People&#x27;s Park station, along with the 15 other North East line (NEL) stations, by Communications Minister Mah Bow Tan on 4 March 1996. The contract for the design and construction of the station – Contract 709 – was awarded to a joint venture between Gammon Construction and Econ Piling in June 1997 at S$141.5 million (US$ million in ).

The construction of the NEL station was one of the most challenging projects on the line. Arterial roads like New Bridge Road, Eu Tong Sen Street, and connecting streets had to be rerouted, closed and reinstated several times. These closures took place through seven major phases and numerous sub-stages from December 1997 to March 2002. The bus stops had to be shifted accordingly. As a result of the rerouted roads and the construction barriers, pedestrians had to take longer routes around the construction site to their desired destinations. In addition, businesses in the area were affected by the noise and construction dust, leading to tarnished goods and a decrease in patronage. The contractors made efforts to minimise these effects, such as using quieter machinery and cleaning the vehicles exiting the worksite. During the Lunar New Year in 2001, a temporary bridge was constructed to connect the two sides of Pagoda Street so pedestrians could walk over the entrance work site.

Following engagements with the local community, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) implemented measures such as shifting worksite hoarding aside to maximise walking space, working with artists to paint the worksite panels, minimising the worksite space at Pagoda Street and renovating the Garden Bridge to allow its integration with the station. A temporary taxi stand was installed at Upper Cross Street to serve the retail development of Chinatown Point. The LTA also built a temporary pedestrian staircase from the shops along New Bridge Road to the Garden Bridge.

Prior to the construction, the utilities at the site had to be diverted at a cost of S$7 million (US$ million in ) so the utilities were not damaged during the station&#x27;s construction. The utilities had to be protected or substituted during the manoeuvre, and took some time due to the poor documentation of the location of the old pipes and cables. The Eu Tong Sen Canal running through the station site had to be dismantled and diverted into four steel pipes to connect the unaffected parts of the canal. It was planned to use steel beams to support the canal during ground excavation and the station&#x27;s construction, but this would risk damaging the canal, causing the site to flood. The more time-consuming and expensive alternative to divert the canal into the diameter pipes would minimise such risks and allow sufficient space for the construction machinery. The LTA engineers decided to implement this alternative, which became one of the largest drainage diversion projects in Singapore. The pipes were suspended below the temporary road decking. After the station&#x27;s construction, the canal, now wider and deeper, was rebuilt above the station.

The construction also involved the preservation of Garden Bridge as it is a social and cultural landmark in Chinatown. Initially, there were plans to dismantle the bridge due to the columns and foundations being in the way of MRT works, but the LTA reversed its decision and decided to underpin the bridge using massive steel trusses. Certain sections of the bridge&#x27;s central support were cut away to allow more space for efficient excavation and construction. The support columns were rebuilt after the station&#x27;s completion.

Due to the soft marine clay above the stable sedimentary soil, there were a few cave-ins at the site during construction. On 3 July 1999, an unused section of the old canal caved in, forming a hole deep. Several I-beams, a compressor and a small machine, which fell into the hole, were retrieved using a crane. It was discovered that some soil had seeped through a gap in the perimeter wall of the station, resulting in the collapse of the structure. The gap was made to accommodate a sewer pipe. In the evening of 22 November, a section of Eu Tong Sen Street collapsed, and it was closed along with neighbouring streets. The collapse formed an hole with a depth of up to . Nobody was injured and the surrounding buildings remained intact. On 2 December that year, a depression, along with cracks, was discovered on the road away from the cave-in site, resulting in another road closure. It was found during an inspection of soil movement above the tunnelling machine underneath the street. One of the lanes remained open for buses. The road was dug open to inspect the utility pipes, cables and the two steel pipes underneath the road. Cement was pumped into the ground to stabilise the soil before the road was reopened to traffic on 5 December.

By mid-2002, the major roads were reinstated with most of the construction work complete. In conjunction with the station&#x27;s opening, the surrounding shopping complexes People&#x27;s Park Complex and the OG Shopping Centre underwent renovations and redevelopment. The former Majestic theatre near the station had also been refurbished and converted into a retail mall. With the NEL commencing services on 20 June 2003, it was expected that the station would bring further development to the area with more investments and crowds.

=== Downtown line station and further plans (2007–2013) ===


During the NEL station&#x27;s construction, provisions were made for Chinatown station to link with a future MRT line. In October 1997, it was announced that the station would become the terminus of the proposed Marina Line. In subsequent plans, however, the Chinatown branch was scrapped. The project was scaled down to six stations that would form the first stage of the Circle Line (CCL).

On 26 April 2005, &quot;Today&quot; reported that soil tests were being conducted around Chinatown station, raising speculations of a possible rail link between Chinatown and Marina Bay via a new developing downtown. However, the LTA expressed they had yet to decide whether to build such a line. On 14 June, the LTA announced that Chinatown station would be the terminus of the Downtown Extension (DTE) from Milennia station (now Promenade). The DTE, initially planned to be a branch of the CCL, was revised to be the first stage of the Downtown line (DTL) in 2007.

In preparation for the DTL construction, the utilities underneath Cross Street and Upper Cross Street were diverted into a long Common Utility Trench (CUT). The wide and deep CUT, located along Pickering Street and Church Street, was constructed using the cut and cover method. The contract for the CUT construction was awarded to Hwa Seng Builder Pte Ltd on 18 August 2006 for S$6.4 million (US$ million). Contract 909 for the construction of the DTL station and associated tunnels was awarded to Gammon Construction at S$160.3 million (US$ million) in August 2007. On 12 February 2008, the LTA held a ceremony at this station to mark the beginning of the DTL&#x27;s construction.

During the construction, traffic was diverted to Cross Street and Upper Cross Street from March 2007 to the end of June 2008. The area in front of Hong Lim Complex and Chinatown Point had been closed off to build the support wall for the station and tunnels. Subsequently, a section of Upper Cross Street between Yue Hwa Building and Block 34 was realigned from 18 January 2010 until the station&#x27;s completion in 2013. On 17 January 2013, the then-Minister of Transport Lui Tuck Yew visited the station, where he announced the 2013 Land Transport Master Plan. An open house was held on 7 December 2013, before the DTL station commenced operations on 22 December. The station was the terminus of the line until the opening of DTL Stage 3 to Expo station on 21 October 2017.

Extending the DTL tunnels from Chinatown to Fort Canning station was a challenge, due to the narrow space between two Housing and Development Board (HDB) blocks and the State Court along the route. In addition, the contractors had to divert the Singapore River for the tunnels’ construction. The DTL tunnels had to be stacked to overcome the space constraints. Before deciding on the route taken to cross the Singapore River, 20 other tunnel routes were considered by LTA engineers but were deemed too unsafe or too damaging to the environment or both. The diversion of the river was necessary as tunnelling underneath would risk sinking or flooding. The tunnel boring machine used could be obstructed by debris that remained stuck into the riverbed. There were considerations to dam the river but it would have disrupted businesses and tour boat operations along the river.

The river diversion, which started in 2012, involved removing components of the river embankment, constructing a series of dams, strengthening the soil and excavating a new canal on the river&#x27;s west bank. After the canal was built, part of the original river course was drained and filled with soil for the tunnels&#x27; construction. The debris along the tunnels’ routes were removed using piling rigs before tunnelling works commenced. To ensure the construction would not pollute the river (which is connected to the Marina Reservoir), the LTA had to maintain adequate hydraulic flows. After boring through the area, the river was realigned to its original course.

On 9 December 2022, as part of a joint emergency preparedness exercise by the LTA and train operator SBS Transit, security screenings were held at the station. Commuters entering the station were redirected to a set of fare gates near Exits A and G with Exit F closed. Such exercises were conducted to test established response protocols and maintain vigilance for quicker and more effective responses during emergencies and heightened security situations.

==Station details==
===Location===

The station is located within the Singapore Chinese ethnic enclave of Chinatown. The NEL station is situated underground between Eu Tong Sen Street and New Bridge Road, while the DTL is underneath Cross Street. The NEL site was chosen to avoid having to demolish the historical shophouses and buildings in the area.

In addition, this station site is closely linked to shopping centres and busy pedestrian areas, such as Chinatown Point, Hong Lim Complex, People&#x27;s Park Complex and The Majestic. Surrounding landmarks include the religious sites of Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, Masjid Jamae (Chulia), Fairfield Methodist Church, the Sri Mariamman Temple and the Sri Layan Sithi Vinayagar Temple. The station serves public amenities including the State Courts, Family Justice Courts, Chinatown Visitor Centre and the Kreta Ayer Community Centre.

===Services===
Chinatown station is served by the NEL and DTL; the official station code is NE4/DT19. On the NEL, the station is between the Outram Park and Clarke Quay stations, with trains running every 2.5 to 5 minutes. On the DTL, the station is between the Telok Ayer and Fort Canning stations, with trains on the line passing every 2.5 to 5 minutes.

===Design===
The station has two underground levels and six entrances. The NEL station has a length of and a depth of . The station is unusually long, allowing connections to various surrounding places of interest. Alluding to the area&#x27;s &quot;rich oriental culture&quot;, the station is decorated with Chinese calligraphy on the floors of the station platforms and concourse as well as a mural on the wall across the concourse. The DTL station is long, with plans to connect the station with the adjacent Telok Ayer station via an underground retail link.

The NEL station is designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter. It is designed to accommodate at least 7,500 people and withstand airstrikes and chemical attacks. Equipment essential for the operations in the CD shelter is mounted on shock absorbers to prevent damage during a bombing. When electrical supply to the shelter is disrupted, there are backup generators to keep operations going. The shelter has dedicated built-in decontamination chambers and dry toilets with collection bins that will send human waste out of the shelter.

The NEL and DTL platforms are wheelchair-accessible. A tactile system, consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station, with dedicated routes that connect the station entrances to the platforms or between the lines. There are wider fare gates that allow easier access for wheelchair users into the station.

Exit A to Pagoda Street features a pavilion-style transparent roof-structure which provides an unobstructed view of the shophouses and allows natural light into the station. As Pagoda Street is in a low-lying area vulnerable to flooding, the entrance has a mechanical flood barrier, eliminating the need to elevate the entrance to a level that would obstruct the view of the street. During a flood, water would flow into a chamber underneath the barrier&#x27;s floor, causing the barrier to rise against the overflow. The other station entrances employ glass structures that allow views of the surrounding developments and natural lighting. The new elliptical entrance serving the DTL station reflects the elliptical façade of the nearby Hong Lim Complex.

==Public artwork==
The station displays two artworks as part of the MRT network&#x27;s Art-in-Transit programme – a showcase of public artworks on the MRT network.

===&quot;The Phoenix&#x27;s-Eye Domain&quot;===

Tan Swie Hian&#x27;s &quot;The Phoenix&#x27;s-Eye Domain&quot; is a wall mural representing the journey of Singapore&#x27;s Chinese immigrants, supplemented by a poem written in three sets of rhyming couplets. The colourful mural, depicting a soaring phoenix in various forms, is displayed at the NEL concourse level, while the poem is engraved on the floors of the station platforms and concourse. The artist intended for the poem to be a &quot;footnote&quot; to the mural, while the mural is supposed to be a visual realisation of the poem.

Taking inspiration from the description of the mythical phoenix in the Chinese classic text &quot;Shan Hai Jing&quot;, the artist uses the phoenix as a symbol of perseverance and strength of the first Chinese settlers. Not intending to just use recognisable depictions of old Chinatown, Tan wished to capture the enduring and noble spirit of the ancestors, who are depicted in the artwork as helping build modern-day Singapore. In the mural, the phoenix flies over the waterfront of Singapore, which is by two kris-shaped rocks. These two rocks, which once existed at the waters&#x27; edge, were used as indicators by early Chinese navigators, who referred to Singapore as the &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Teeth Gate&quot;. Written on the phoenix&#x27;s body are five characters, each with different meanings: Virtue, Righteousness, Civility, Benevolence and Credibility, regarded to be the five core values of man.

In another section of the artwork, the phoenix is shown in its full glory, being surrounded by a myriad of birds. This was intended to be an auspicious sign of Singapore&#x27;s prosperity. In the last segment of the mural, the birds and phoenix combine into one, symbolising the &quot;universal energy&quot; of the cycle of life. The coolies on the mural are depicted as victorious strong men in classical Greek style rather than defeated labourers, as the artist felt the labourers were already well-built. Before the artwork was reproduced in the United Kingdom, Tan first drew out the work by hand. Instead of watering them down via a painting medium, Tan applied oil and acrylic paints directly onto the canvas. This was done to accomplish vibrant colour transitions for the work. However, it was difficult to reproduce this colour treatment when the mural was being produced in the United Kingdom. Through experimentation, the specialist company in Birmingham adopted a seven-colour process to closely match the original&#x27;s colours on the final artwork in vitreous enamel.

The poetry, composed in a semi-cursive calligraphic script, employs the couplet – a pair of complementary verses set side by side. The calligraphy was first written in ink on rice paper before being scanned onto a computer and reproduced on the granite tiles. Each of the Chinese characters was cut out from grey slabs and inlaid into slabs of a darker tone, hollowed out for the characters. Placing the work on the floor, however, was considered unusual, as calligraphic works were usually placed on walls in auspicious positions. Tan explained that since life comes from earth, the earth is as auspicious as the sky. The artist intended to lay the characters on the same earth the first settlers had set foot on.

===&quot;Flying Colours&quot;===

The DTL concourse level features &quot;Flying Colours&quot; by Cheo Chai Hiang. The artwork depicts several clothes lines, a scene representing Singapore&#x27;s high-rise HDB flats. The clothes lines changes slightly when viewed from different angles (i.e. a lenticular print). The artist sought to transform the &quot;mundane&quot; aspect of the scenery into something &quot;festive and celebratory&quot;, while creating an illusion of clothes &quot;flying in the wind&quot;. The angle of the clothes lines directs commuters to the platforms.

The DTL artwork has drawn mixed reactions from other artists. Jeremy Sharma, the artist of &quot;Holland Beat&quot; at Holland Village station, regarded the work as &quot;original and attractive with a lot of playful humour&quot;. On the other hand, Yek Wong, the artist who created the artwork at one-north station, felt that the work did not quite deliver the concept and suggested it could be more &quot;visually engaging&quot;.

<text>Clarke Quay MRT station is an underground Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) station on the North East line (NEL) in Singapore. Situated along Eu Tong Sen Street, near the junction of Merchant Road and North Canal Road, it is at the south of the Singapore River underneath The Central. The station serves Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, as well as other landmarks such as Hong Lim Park, The Riverwalk and the Swissotel Merchant Court.

First announced in March 1996, the station was planned to serve the redevelopment of the Singapore River. Explosives were used in the construction of bored tunnels between this station and Dhoby Ghaut station. Clarke Quay station was completed on 20 June 2003. The curvilinear features of the station entrances are designed to symbolise the flowing waters of the Singapore River. The station features an Art-in-Transit public artwork &quot;The Reflections&quot; by Chua Ek Kay.

==History==

The North East line (NEL) project, which was first proposed in 1984, received government approval in January 1996. Clarke Quay station was among the sixteen NEL stations announced by communications minister Mah Bow Tan that March. The Land Transport Authority (LTA) Deputy Chief Executive and his colleagues visited Clarke Quay in 1995. During their visit, they decided there should be a station built under Ellenborough Market, which lay along the proposed NEL route. The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) agreed, saying the proposed station would &quot;realise the tremendous commercial and aesthetic potential&quot; of the Singapore River. 

Some property developers felt the station was not as &quot;centrally located&quot; to serve the developments near Robertson Quay. Others, such as DBS Land and Far East Organisation, supported the proposed station as it would fill a &quot;major gap&quot; in transportation access to the area. The station opened on 20 June 2003 along with the other NEL stations.

===Station construction===
The contract for the design and construction of Clarke Quay station and tunnels was awarded to a joint venture of Nishimatsu Construction, Lum Chang Building Contractors and Bachy Soletanche Singapore. Stallholders of the Ellenborough Market had to move out by 31 March 1997 as the market would be demolished for the station. Due to the soft marine clay, a dam was built around the station site, and the contiguous concrete wall panels were installed via diaphragm walling.

The contractors had to monitor and minimise any ground movement of the heritage shophouses by the river and the Thong Chai building. Some of the perimeter walls were also installed near the river wall. The APG building located along New Bridge Road was detected to be settling unevenly because it had a separate foundations. Following a thorough survey of the building, the LTA engineers deemed it safe for use and made repairs and restorations.
===Tunnels construction===
The NEL tunnels cross the Singapore River near Coleman Bridge. This was the second MRT river crossing, though the first to use the tunnel boring machine (TBM) beneath the riverbed. Compared to the cut-and-cover method, the TBM was considered less time-consuming, had lower risks of tunnel flooding, and minimised environmental damage to Clarke Quay and the river. As the tunnels were only below the riverbed, it was decided to further lower the tunnels and the station by . The TBM had to tunnel through a layer of marine clay with varying thickness, loose fluvial sands and weathered sedimentary rocks that could create varying resistance to the TBM. Hence, it was essential to maintain effective control of the excavation rate to keep the TBM in alignment. While initially opposed by the management of Clarke Quay, the launch shaft was located at the former Whampoa Garden due to optimal soil conditions.

Explosives were used for the hard rock under Fort Canning Hill when workers tunnelled between Clarke Quay and Dhoby Ghaut. Sensitive structures, such as an underground enclosed reservoir atop Fort Canning and a telecom microwave tower, were closely monitored. A minor ground settlement at Fort Canning Country Club created a large void above the TBM. As a result, grout was pumped in to prevent further settlement. The tunnelling also encountered a huge inflow of water, and pipes were drilled into the rock face to channel the water out and prevent water from seeping into the rock cracks. 

The tunnel excavation also exposed a layer of sand in the rock face directly underneath the Oxley Rise flyover, causing slow settlement under the flyover. As survey teams established monitoring points at the flyover, pit bosses and miners hammered timber into the ground to stop ground loss. The ground was filled with chemical grout to add strength and cohesion to the soil before tunnelling resumed. Explosives were also used for another hard rock under the North-South line (NSL) tunnels near Dhoby Ghaut station as the manual excavation was too slow. Jet-grout arches supported the NSL tunnels while tunnelling near Dhoby Ghaut station.

==Details==

Clarke Quay station serves the North East line (NEL) of the Singapore MRT and is between the Chinatown and Dhoby Ghaut stations. The station code is NE5. Being part of the NEL, the station is operated by SBS Transit. The station operates daily from about 5:30am to 12:25am. Train frequencies vary from 2.5 to 5 minutes.

Located along Eu Tong Sen Street on the south bank of the Singapore River, the station is near the junction of Merchant Road and North Canal Road. The station is underneath The Central, a retail and residential development owned by the Far East organisation. Other developments surrounding the station include Hong Lim Park, Speaker&#x27;s Corner, Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, Asian Civilisation Museum, Fort Canning Hill, Park Regis Hotel, The Riverwalk, Swissotel Merchant Court and The Riverside Piazza. The station is also within walking distance to Fort Canning station on the Downtown line.

Clarke Quay station is designed by SAA Architects. The curved roof design of the station entrances draws inspiration from the flowing waters of the Singapore River, while its color scheme is reminiscent of the boats ferrying tourists and locals along the river. The station is designed to have a spacious interior while having large columns to support the commercial development built above the station. 

The station is designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter: it is designed to accommodate at least 7,500 people and withstand airstrikes and chemical attacks. Equipment essential for the operations in the CD shelter is mounted on shock absorbers to prevent damage during a bombing. When the electrical supply to the shelter is disrupted, there are backup generators to keep operations going. The shelter has dedicated built-in decontamination chambers and dry toilets with collection bins that will send human waste out of the shelter. Like all other NEL stations, the platforms are wheelchair-accessible. A tactile system, consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station. Dedicated tactile routes connect the station entrances to the platforms.

==Artwork==
&quot;The Reflections&quot; by Chua Ek Kay is displayed at this station as part of the Art-in-Transit (AiT) programme, a showcase of public artworks on the MRT network. The work consists of a mural portraying scenes from life on the Singapore River as well as an acid-etched brass mural reminiscent of light reflecting from the water. Exploring the themes of reflection, both pieces capture the vibrancy and vitality of the river. Complementing these artworks are floor tiles, each adorned with painted eyes reminiscent of those found on tongkangs or Chinese junks, and they serve as navigational aids for station commuters.

The work was inspired by Chua&#x27;s observations of contemporary river life and childhood memories of the bustling Teochew Street area, where the station now stands. As such, the murals depict key moments highlighting the significance of the Singapore River to the city. These include the arrival of early migrants in the 19th century, the bustling activity of tongkangs navigating the river, the architectural landscape surrounding it, and the street celebrations by its banks. The silkscreened mural was originally rendered in ink on rice paper before being transferred onto vitreous enamel panels in the United Kingdom. These nostalgic tones are juxtaposed against the &quot;raw energy&quot; of the brass mural. The brush strokes give the appearance of with the river&#x27;s energy and the reflections of passengers in motion. Mirroring the river&#x27;s ever-changing hues with the weather, the colours in the brass work from &quot;dominant reds&quot; to &quot;striking greens&quot;, accented with traces of gold on aquamarine.

Chua took pride in allowing viewers to engage with, and appreciate the details of, his brass artwork in the ticket concourse area. He further explained that the more abstract nature of the brass mural could &quot;open up a wider space for imagination&quot; through the work&#x27;s changing colours, movement, and rhythm. While Chua used Chinese brushwork for both murals, the brushstrokes on the brass panels diverged in all directions to achieve the &quot;shimmering, dynamic effect&quot; distinct from the tranquil, broad strokes for the other murals.

The artist first worked on the silkscreen murals, which were originally half the size before being rendered on the vitreous enamels. The brass work required deeper thought and a more intricate process. Chua worked on 60 brass sheets, each weighing and backed with cement board. He applied brushstrokes to the brass sheets before immersing them in a chemical bath, resulting in an etched effect with ageing acid-tinged patches that transitioned from turquoise to green, orange, and dark brown. Chua, who preferred full control over the work&#x27;s production, personally oversaw the creation of his brass artworks, rather than producing the work on paper before having contractors fabricate it in brass. Chua also engaged with various stakeholders for the artwork, and his close collaboration with the station&#x27;s architect led to adjustments in the station&#x27;s colour scheme from beige to grey, enhancing the presentation of Chua&#x27;s artwork on brass.

The station is located at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Race Course Road, and serves the ethnic neighbourhood of Little India. Several landmarks surrounding the station include KK Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital, Tekka Market, and the Land Transport Authority headquarters.

First announced as Kandang Kerbau MRT station in 1996, the construction required the use of metal decks to maintain traffic flow in the area. Skeletons with gold jewellery were also found during the station&#x27;s construction. The NEL station opened on 20 June 2003. In March 2007, it was announced that the NEL will interchange with the DTL at this station. The DTL platforms opened on 27 December 2015 as part of Stage 2 of the line.

The station was designed to reflect Indian traditions, especially with the leaf-shaped patterns in the metal grills of the walls and the flowing fabric theme inspired by the Indian sari for the DTL station. Two artworks are featured at this station as part of the Art-in-Transit programme. &quot;Memoirs of the Past&quot; by S. Chandrasekaran, which is inspired by Indian traditional art, is displayed in the NEL station. &quot;Woven Field&quot; by Grace Tan features a geometric tessellation of metal plates embedded into the baffle wall above the DTL platforms.

==History==
===North East line===

In 1986, preliminary studies for the North East line (NEL) commissioned by the MRT Corporation recommended that the line serve the Kandang Kerbau Hospital while the line paralleled the major Serangoon and Upper Serangoon Roads. The line was not considered financially viable by the Government of Singapore in 1989; it was only in January 1996 that the government approved plans to start the line&#x27;s construction right away.

The station was first announced as &quot;Kandang Kerbau&quot; when the 16 NEL stations were revealed by communications minister Mah Bow Tan in March 1996. Residents near the station welcomed the news as they hoped that the station would give the district a &quot;new lease of life&quot; with more developments around the station, reported &quot;The Straits Times&quot;. The contract for the design and construction of Kandang Kerbau station was awarded to a joint venture between Hyundai Engineering &amp; Construction and Zublin AG for S$311.56 million (US$ million) in April 1997. The contract also included the construction of the adjacent Farrer Park station.

In October 1998, construction workers at the site unearthed human skeletons, some of which were adorned with gold jewellery. A few speculated the skeletons to be massacred victims during the Japanese occupation, or unidentified cadavers from a mortuary given the station&#x27;s location at the old campus of Kandang Kerbau hospital, or part of a nearby cemetery at Kampung Java. Nevertheless, the exact origins of the skeletons remained unknown.

It was initially planned to close Buffalo Lane to facilitate construction works. However, as it was an important road for shoppers leaving Tekka Centre to Bukit Timah Road by car, the Moulmein Tekka Residents&#x27; Committee raised concerns of road congestion around the station site. Hence, a metal decking was constructed to keep Buffalo Lane open while works continued underneath. The decking had to be moved five times during construction works which impacted the construction schedule, costing the Land Transport Authority (LTA) about $1 million (US$ million).

To construct the underpass between Buffalo Lane and Bukit Timah Road underneath Bukit Timah Canal, the LTA dismissed the conventional cut-and-cover method as it would have disrupted vehicular traffic on Bukit Timah Road and risked flooding the road and the station due to obstructed water flow of the canal. The frontal segmental jacking method was briefly adopted until the discovery of boulders underground. Hence, the open-face tunnelling method was adopted, with metal decking built over the site that avoided traffic disruption of Bukit Timah Road.

When tunneling between the Little India and Farrer Park stations, the heritage buildings along Race Course Road required protection against ground settlement. As these buildings were built on &#x27;strip footings&#x27; and shallow timber piles, they were supported by the installation of metal supports and were being closely observed for any movement. An old church near the tunnel excavation works, Foochow Methodist Church, was built on a combination of timber and H-piles, which caused uneven settlement and cracks to appear on the church walls. As a safety precaution, the church attendees temporarily relocated to the nearby Rex cinema while the LTA and church engineers strengthened the church foundation with steel supports and micropiles.

Malaysia property developer DRB-Hicom built Tekka Mall from March 2001 to May 2003; hoping to take advantage of crowds that would come from the station, according to Tekka Mall&#x27;s marketing agent DTZ Debenham Tie Leung. The station commenced operations on 20 June 2003 as Little India station. The station&#x27;s name change was criticised by the Singapore Heritage Society, which claimed that the new name was &quot;misleading&quot; to suggest that the area was the &quot;main abode of Indians&quot;. They advocated keeping the original name as it better reflects the area&#x27;s heritage.

===Downtown line===

The LTA announced in March 2007 that Little India station would become an interchange station with the addition of the Downtown Line (DTL). The LTA further announced on 15 July 2008 that the station would be part of DTL Stage 2 (DTL2). The contract for the design and construction of Little India station and tunnels was awarded to SsangYong Engineering &amp; Construction Co. Ltd for , announced the LTA in June 2009. The contract also included the construction of the adjacent Rochor station. The station&#x27;s construction was arranged to start in the third quarter of 2009 with 2015 as the intended completion date.

A section of the DTL tunnel below the NEL tunnels had to be manually mined due to the hard ground and the large boulders underground. At the DTL station site, a boulder about the size of a double decker bus was also broken into smaller pieces using specialised hydraulic machinery. On the night of 26 March 2014, a fire started at the construction site but was put out in 30 minutes, said the LTA. As announced by the LTA in April 2015, the DTL station opened on 27 December.

== Details ==
Little India station is an interchange station on the NEL and the DTL, which are lines operated by SBS Transit. On the NEL, the station is between the and stations, while on the DTL, the station is between the and stations. The station code is NE7/DT12. Located along Bukit Timah Road at the junction of Race Course Road, the station serves the similarly named ethnic neighbourhood Little India. Surrounding landmarks include Albert Court, the KK Women&#x27;s &amp; Children&#x27;s Hospital, Tekka Market, Shree Lakshminarayan Temple and the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple. Little India station is also close to Tanglin Police HQ and the LTA Hampshire office.

The station has six entrances. Designed to reflect Indian traditions, the metal grills of the NEL station walls have leaf-shaped patterns which may be similar to the door patterns of Hindu prayer rooms. The NEL station is designated as a Civil Defence (CD) shelter: it is designed to accommodate around 7,500 people, withstand airstrikes and remove toxic air. Equipment essential for the operations in the CD shelter is mounted on shock absorbers to prevent damage during a bombing. When the electrical supply to the shelter is disrupted, there are backup generators to keep operations going. The shelter has dedicated built-in decontamination chambers and dry toilets with collection bins that will send human waste out of the shelter.

The DTL station was designed by Architects61, which adopted a flowing fabric theme reminiscent of the Indian sari to reflect the vicinity&#x27;s heritage. The NEL and DTL platforms are wheelchair-accessible. Tactile paving, consisting of tiles with rounded or elongated raised studs, guides visually impaired commuters through the station with dedicated routes that connect the station entrances to the platforms or between the lines. Wider fare gates allow easier access for wheelchair users into the station for both lines.

== Public artwork ==
The station displays two artworks as part of the MRT network&#x27;s Art-in-Transit programme – a showcase of public artworks on the MRT network.

=== &quot;Memoirs of the Past&quot; ===

S. Chandrasekaran&#x27;s artwork in the NEL station, &quot;Memoirs of the Past&quot;, consists of several sepia-coloured pieces honouring traditional Indian folk art. The work includes intricate bronze and granite floor designs and stylized animal paintings on the walls, referencing the area&#x27;s historical buffalo stables. The bronze kolam patterns represent Lord Shiva&#x27;s third eye, symbolizing wisdom and insight, said Chandrasekaran. This third eye is also a motif throughout Chandrasekaran&#x27;s work at Little India station.

Chandrasekaran recalls the daily ritual of making kolams by his Indian mother in his childhood home in Chinatown, though this Indian tradition is fading due to busy modern lifestyles. The kolam reminds him of the cycle of life and death, and symbolises the start of a new day, celebrating life, and giving thanks to God. Chandrasekaran&#x27;s paintings at Little India reflect the influence of Rajasthani folk art, which he explored during his postgraduate studies in India. Characterised by raw, simplistic lines and exaggerated proportions, his work combines a child-like appeal with stylised abstraction. The sepia tones in these works align with the monochromatic earth tones in his other pieces.

Chandrasekaran said he initially proposed a more &quot;abstract and intense&quot; artwork for the station akin to his previous works; however, the &quot;religious undertones or sexual connotations&quot; were deemed unsuitable for a public space. After consultations with the LTA, he ultimately focused on themes of daily life and local memories, acknowledging that &quot;public art must connect with commuters from all walks of life at a glance&quot;.

=== &quot;Woven Field&quot; ===

Grace Tan&#x27;s &quot;Woven Field&quot; is a geometric tessellation of metal plates embedded into the station&#x27;s aluminium wall above the DTL platforms. Using black perforated aluminium trays to hold 1,000 triangular units in three metallic shades, the wavy-shaped work spans with a height of . Triangular motifs within the work produce more complex imagery, including diamonds, butterflies, fish, and eight-petalled lotus, while blending with the station design &quot;to form a single entity&quot;, according to Tan. Reflecting the Rochor Canal and movements of commuters, the work took inspiration from Indian sari patterns.

The flowing white baffle panels of the station&#x27;s architecture induced Tan to think of vertical yarns on sari weavers&#x27; looms. She said this gave her the idea of &quot;weaving&quot; the artwork into the architecture to reinforce the design theme of its locality and place. Additionally, she was intrigued by the patterns found in saris – such as the fish, herringbone and lotus – that represent the diverse beliefs of Indian culture, and hence rendered these symbols to be expressed in geometric patterns.

<text>Farkas Bolyai (; 9 February 1775 – 20 November 1856; also known as Wolfgang Bolyai in Germany) was a Hungarian mathematician, mainly known for his work in geometry.

==Biography==
Bolyai was born in Bolya, a village near Hermannstadt, Grand Principality of Transylvania (now Buia, Sibiu County, Romania). His father was Gáspár Bolyai and his mother Krisztina Vajna. Farkas was taught at home by his father until the age of six when he was sent to the Calvinist school in Nagyszeben. His teachers recognized his talents in arithmetics and in learning languages. He learned Latin, Greek, Romanian, Hebrew and later also French, Italian and English. He easily multiplied, divided 13- or 14-digit numbers in his head, and was able to draw square and cubic roots from them. At the age of 12 he left school and was appointed as a tutor to the eight-year-old son of the count Kemény. This meant that Bolyai was now treated as a member of one of the leading families in the country, and he became not only a tutor but a real friend to the count&#x27;s son. In 1790 Bolyai and his pupil both entered the Calvinist College in Kolozsvár (today Cluj-Napoca) where they spent five years.

The professor of philosophy at the College in Kolozsvár tried to turn Bolyai against mathematics and towards religious philosophy. Bolyai, however, decided to go abroad with Simon Kemény on an educational trip in 1796 and began to study mathematics systematically at German universities first at Jena and then at Göttingen. In these times Bolyai became a close friend of Carl Friedrich Gauss.

He returned home to Kolozsvár in 1799. It was there he met and married Zsuzsanna Benkő and where their son János Bolyai – later an even more famous mathematician than his father – was born in 1802. Soon thereafter he accepted a teaching position for mathematics and sciences at the Calvinist College in Marosvásárhely (today Târgu-Mureş), where he spent the rest of his life.

==Mathematical work==
Bolyai&#x27;s main interests were the foundations of geometry and the parallel axiom.

His main work, &quot;Tentamen juventutem studiosam in elementa matheseos purae, elementaris ac sublimioris, methodo intuitiva, evidentiaque huic propria, introducendi&quot; (&quot;An Attempt to Introduce Studious Youths to the Elements of Pure Mathematics&quot;; 1832), was an attempt at a rigorous and systematic foundation of geometry, arithmetic, algebra and analysis. In this work, he gave iterative procedures to solve equations which he then proved convergent by showing them to be monotonically increasing and bounded above. His study of the convergence of series includes a test equivalent to Raabe&#x27;s test, which he discovered independently and at about the same time as Raabe. Other important ideas in the work include a general definition of a function and a definition of an equality between two plane figures if they can both be divided into a finite equal number of pairwise congruent pieces.

He first dissuaded his son from the study of non-Euclidean geometry, but by 1832 he became enthusiastic enough to persuade his son to publish his path-breaking thoughts. János&#x27;s ideas were published an appendix to the &quot;Tentamen&quot;.

<doc id="1159136" wikidata="Q902938" url="?curid=1159136" title="Bridgman–Stockbarger method">
<text>The Bridgman–Stockbarger method, or Bridgman–Stockbarger technique, is named after physicist Percy Williams Bridgman (1882–1961) and physicist Donald C. Stockbarger (1895–1952). The method includes two similar but distinct techniques primarily used for growing boules (single-crystal ingots), but which can be used for solidifying polycrystalline ingots as well.

==Overview==
The methods involve heating polycrystalline material above its melting point and slowly cooling it from one end of its container, where a seed crystal is located. A single crystal of the same crystallographic orientation as the seed material is grown on the seed and is progressively formed along the length of the container. The process can be carried out in a horizontal or vertical orientation, and usually involves a rotating crucible/ampoule to stir the melt.

The Bridgman method is a popular way of producing certain semiconductor crystals such as gallium arsenide, for which the Czochralski method is more difficult. The process can reliably produce single-crystal ingots, but does not necessarily result in uniform properties through the crystal.

The difference between the Bridgman technique and Stockbarger technique is subtle: While both methods utilize a temperature gradient and a moving crucible, the Bridgman technique utilizes the relatively uncontrolled gradient produced at the exit of the furnace; the Stockbarger technique introduces a baffle, or shelf, separating two coupled furnaces with temperatures above and below the freezing point. Stockbarger&#x27;s modification of the Bridgman technique allows for better control over the temperature gradient at the melt/crystal interface.

When seed crystals are not employed as described above, polycrystalline ingots can be produced from a feedstock consisting of rods, chunks, or any irregularly shaped pieces once they are melted and allowed to re-solidify. The resultant microstructure of the ingots so obtained are characteristic of directionally solidified metals and alloys with their aligned grains.

=== Bagdasarov method ===
A variant of the technique known as the horizontal directional solidification method (HDSM) developed by Khachik Bagdasarov () starting in the 1960s in the Soviet Union. It uses a flat-bottomed crucible made out of molybdenum with short sidewalls rather than an enclosed ampoule, and has been used to grow various large oxide crystals including Yb:YAG (a laser host crystal), and sapphire crystals 45 cm wide and over 1 meter long. However, the quality of the crystals grown by HDSM differ from the Czochralski method, due to the problem of the problematic presence of bubbles.

<text>Louis Theodor Weichardt (21 May 1894 – 26 October 1985) was a South African political leader, born in Paarl of German extraction, who founded the Greyshirts, a Nazi organization.

In Cape Town, on 26 October 1933, Weichardt founded the South African Christian National Socialist Spider Movement with a paramilitary section (modeled on Nazi Germany&#x27;s brown-shirted Sturmabteilung) called the Gryshemde or Grayshirts. He was interned during World War II, and released from custody in 1946. Afterwards, he worked with Oswald Pirow&#x27;s New Order. Disbanding his party in 1948, Weichardt gave his allegiance to Daniel François Malan&#x27;s National Party. He became senator from Natal Province from 1956 to 1970.

<doc id="1159157" wikidata="Q812822" url="?curid=1159157" title="Be Yourself Tonight">
<text>Be Yourself Tonight is the fourth studio album by British pop duo Eurythmics, released on 29 April 1985 by RCA Records. It spawned four singles – &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot;, &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; (a duet with Aretha Franklin) and &quot;It&#x27;s Alright (Baby&#x27;s Coming Back)&quot;. The album has been described as their most commercially successful album, and has been pitched as &quot;one of the greatest pop and rock albums of the 1980s&quot;. A notable departure from both the musical composition and image of their previous albums, &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot; was widely regarded as an example of their finest work due to their continued &quot;innovation&quot; of their music.

It was a major commercial success for Eurythmics on international albums charts, reaching the top five in regions including Australia (where it reached number one), New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, it reached the top ten in the United States, Switzerland and Germany.

It was nominated for the Billboard Music Award for Top Billboard 200 Album and Top Compact Disk Award at the 1985 Billboard Music Awards and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year at the 1986 Brit Awards. Two of the albums singles – &quot;Sisters Are Doin&#x27; It for Themselves&quot; and &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot; were nominated for two awards at the 28th Annual Grammy Awards in 1986 for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal respectively.

==Background==
Largely recorded in Paris, with additional recording in Detroit and Los Angeles, this album saw Eurythmics move away from their previous more experimental, synthesizer-based songs, to a more commercial pop/rock sound. Songs, such as &quot;Would I Lie To You?&quot; were influenced by 1960s style music, as well as utilising American soul and British pop. Combining elements of Motown and rock music, the album incorporates a more traditional band line-up/instrumentation. Nonetheless, the recordings still possessed an atmospheric and cutting edge sound, winning David A. Stewart awards for his production work on the album.

The release of the album coincided with a new look for singer Annie Lennox, who ditched the androgynous look of the previous albums and became, in biographer Lucy O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s words, &quot;a bleach-blonde rock &#x27;n&#x27; roller&quot;. &quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot; includes guest appearances by notable artists such as Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Elvis Costello. The album features a range of genres performed by the duo, many of which were performed by the band for the first time. It has been described as both a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;one of the best pop/rock albums of the 1980s&quot; largely in part a result of their &quot;innovation and ability to not succumb to the machine”.

==Release and promotion==

No tour followed the album&#x27;s release, due to Lennox&#x27;s recuperation from vocal fold nodules (which also caused her to miss 1985&#x27;s Live Aid concert). On 14 November 2005, Sony BMG repackaged and released Eurythmics&#x27; back catalogue as &quot;2005 Deluxe Edition Reissues&quot;. Each of their eight studio albums&#x27; original track listings were supplemented with bonus tracks and remixes.

==Chart performance==
&quot;Be Yourself Tonight&quot; reached the top 3 in the UK and top 10 in the US, as well as spawning several hit singles. The album includes the duo&#x27;s first (and only) UK number-one &quot;There Must Be an Angel (Playing with My Heart)&quot;. The first single released was &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;. It would hit #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, #6 on the Cash Box Top 100 and also hit #1 in Australia. The album was certified double platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), indicating sales in excess of 600,000 copies, and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of one million copies.

<doc id="1159161" wikidata="Q1414981" url="?curid=1159161" title="Malibu Comics">
<text>Malibu Comics Entertainment, Inc. (launched as Malibu Graphics) was an American comic book publisher active in the late 1980s and early 1990s, best known for its Ultraverse line of superhero titles. Notable titles published by Malibu included &quot;The Men in Black&quot;, &quot;Ultraforce&quot;, and &quot;Night Man&quot;.

The company&#x27;s headquarters was in Calabasas, California. Malibu was initially publisher of record for Image Comics from 1992 to 1993. The company&#x27;s other imprints included Adventure, Aircel and Eternity. Malibu also owned a small software development company that designed video games in the early to mid-1990s called Malibu Interactive.

==History==
=== Origins ===
Malibu Comics was launched in 1986 as Malibu Graphics by Dave Olbrich and Tom Mason with the private financing of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, who was operating a comic book distribution company (Sunrise Distribution) at the time. Unbeknownst to most people in the industry, Rosenberg was also financing a number of other small comics publishers: Eternity Comics, Amazing Comics, Wonder Color Comics, and Imperial Comics.

Malibu&#x27;s output began modestly, with creator-owned black-and-white titles; its first title was David Lawrence and Ron Lim&#x27;s &quot;Ex-Mutants&quot;.

=== Mergers/acquisitions of other publishers ===
In 1987, after Rosenberg&#x27;s behind-the-scenes roles were revealed, he discontinued most of the other small publishers, merging some with Malibu and retaining Eternity Comics as a Malibu brand. At this point, Chris Ulm joined Malibu as editor-in-chief.

In 1988, Malibu effectively acquired the Canadian publisher Aircel Comics as an imprint, and in 1989 it acquired Adventure Publications. 

From that point forward, the Malibu brand was used for superhero titles; while Eternity was used for the magazine line and also for anime-inspired titles like &quot;Robotech&quot;; Adventure was used for Malibu&#x27;s licensed titles, such as &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;Alien Nation&quot;; and Aircel was used for Barry Blair&#x27;s comics and Malibu&#x27;s adult line.

In 1998, the company also acquired the character Shuriken (a character that was self-published from 1985–1988 by Victory Productions) from its creator Reggie Byers. Shuriken was published in three limited series and two one-shots by Malibu; later the character was introduced in the Ultraverse imprint.

=== 1989-1992 ===
By this time, the company was publishing a combination of new series and licensed properties. Later, after a legal battle with the creators, Malibu created a shared universe called Shattered Earth.

In 1992, heroes from Centaur Publications (a Golden Age publisher whose properties fell into the public domain) were revived in the form of the Protectors, consisting of Airman, Amazing-Man, Aura, Arc, Arrow, Ferret, Man of War and Mighty Man, among others. Several of these characters had short-lived spin-off titles of their own. The Centaur heroes and other characters from Adventure (Miss Fury and Rocket Ranger), and Eternity (Dinosaurs for Hire, Ex-Mutants) plus Dead Clown and Widowmaker, were put together in one Universe to form the Genesis line. This line, however, had a short lifespan.

==== Image Comics&#x27; publisher of record ====
In early 1992, Malibu served as publisher of record for the first comics from Image Comics, making the upstart creator-run publisher members of the Malibu Graphics Publishing Group, and giving Image access to the distribution channels. This move led to Malibu obtaining almost ten percent of the American comics market share, temporarily moving ahead of industry giant DC Comics.

By the beginning of 1993, Image&#x27;s financial situation was secure enough to publish its titles independently, and it left Malibu.

=== Malibu Interactive and Ultraverse ===
In late 1992, seeking to capitalize on the growing video game market, Malibu merged with video game developer Acme Interactive to form Malibu Comics Entertainment, Inc., with Malibu Interactive acting as a subsidiary.

The Ultraverse line was launched in June 1993 during the &quot;boom&quot; of the early 1990s, roughly concurrent with the debut of publishers such as Image and Valiant, and new superhero lines from DC and Dark Horse (Milestone and Comics&#x27; Greatest World, respectively). The line was in part intended to fill the gap left by Image&#x27;s independence. 

Establishing itself as the first company to use digital coloring for all its titles, Malibu boasted improved production values over traditional comics, including higher-quality paper, and a roster of talented and respected writers and artists. Emphasizing the tight continuity between the various series in the Ultraverse line, Malibu made extensive use of crossovers, in which a story that began in one series would be continued in the next-shipping issue of another series. Various promotions for special editions or limited-print stories followed. The Ultraverse line came to dominate Malibu&#x27;s catalog.

The Bravura imprint, launched in January 1994, was Malibu&#x27;s creator-owned imprint. Founding members of the Bravura group were Dan Brereton (&quot;Nocturnals&quot;), Howard Chaykin (&quot;Power &amp; Glory&quot;), Steven D. Grant &amp; Gil Kane (&quot;Edge&quot;), Dan Jurgens (&quot;Deuce&quot;), Walt Simonson (&quot;Star Slammers&quot;), and Jim Starlin (&quot;Breed&quot;, &quot;Dreadstar&quot;). The group was represented by attorney Harris M. Miller II. The &quot;Bravura Gold Stamp Program&quot; encouraged readers to collect stickers from each issue of &quot;Breed&quot;, &quot;Power &amp; Glory&quot;, &quot;Edge&quot;, &quot;Dreadstar&quot;, and &quot;Star Slammers&quot; to qualify for various offers, including &quot;the rare&quot; &quot;Bravura&quot; #0!&quot;

Malibu launched the Rock-It Comix imprint for rock music comics in early 1994. Malibu worked with the management firm Gold Mountain Entertainment in dealing with the musicians, while International Strategic Marketing distributed the line to comic book shops, music outlets, and newsstands.

By early 1994, Malibu Comics Entertainment had large numbers of employees in various divisions, including editorial, design, the art department, coloring, imagesetting, marketing, film, finance, and administration.

=== Acquisition by Marvel Comics ===
As sales declined industry-wide in the mid-1990s, Malibu canceled lower-selling series. But the company&#x27;s biggest problem was its game division—started in an attempt to break into the video game market—which cost Malibu more than $200,000 a month. Nonetheless, the company&#x27;s assets were still seen as attractive enough to garner interest from DC Comics in the spring of 1994. In addition, Rosenberg and Malibu signed with the William Morris Agency. 

Because Malibu had sufficient market share that an acquisition from DC would make the latter surpass Marvel&#x27;s market share, Marvel decided to purchase Malibu itself to prevent this from happening: on November 3, 1994, Malibu was purchased by Marvel Comics. 

To slow down rumors that the Ultraverse titles would be canceled as soon as the deal closed, Malibu claimed that Marvel wanted Malibu because of its digital coloring system. Meanwhile, in the middle of the following year, 1995, Malibu standard-bearers Mason and Ulm left the company. Around the same, time in May–October 1995 (during the &quot;Black September&quot; event) Marvel re-launched a handful of the more popular Ultraverse titles as well as a number of crossovers with Marvel characters. The &quot;volume 2&quot; series each started with &quot;#∞ (infinity)&quot; issues — these were, however, canceled a short time later. With that, Marvel canceled the entire Ultraverse line. (Within the Marvel Comics multiverse, the Genesis Universe is designated as Earth-1136 and the Ultraverse as Earth-93060.)

Very little Malibu content was published after 1996.

==== Potential Ultraverse revival ====
In June 2005, when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied that:

In May 2012, Steve Englehart suggested in a podcast interview that the reason Marvel will not presently publish the Ultraverse characters is because five percent of the profits from those books would have to go to the Malibu creators who were still alive. Marvel Editor Tom Brevoort later denied that the five percent was what was holding Marvel back, but was unable to give a real explanation due to a non-disclosure agreement.

It has been speculated that Scott Mitchell Rosenberg&#x27;s ongoing producer deal for all Malibu properties (and his alleged personal troubles) is another possible factor in why the Ultraverse has never been revived.

==Titles==
Some of Malibu&#x27;s titles and imprints included:

<text>The Sensual World is the sixth studio album by the English singer-songwriter Kate Bush, released on 16 October 1989 by EMI Records. It entered and peaked at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart and has been certified Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for shipments in excess of 300,000 in the United Kingdom, and Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.

==Overview==
Bush drew inspiration for the title track from the modernist novel &quot;Ulysses&quot; by James Joyce. Bush realised that Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy, the closing passage of the novel, fitted the music she had created. When the Joyce estate refused to release the text, Bush wrote original lyrics that echo the original passage, as Molly steps from the pages of the book and revels in the real world. She also alluded to &quot;Jerusalem&quot; by William Blake in a reference to the song&#x27;s gestation (&quot;And my arrows of desire rewrite the speech&quot;). The song includes Irish instrumentation (uilleann pipes, fiddle, whistle) under a breathy rendering of the orgasmic &#x27;Yes&#x27; of the original text.

The songs &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Tail&quot; all feature backing vocals by the Bulgarian vocal ensemble Trio Bulgarka. &quot;Heads We&#x27;re Dancing&quot; includes a characteristic Mick Karn fretless bassline. The song &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; from the romantic comedy film &quot;She&#x27;s Having a Baby&quot; (1988) was re-edited for this album. On 27 November 2005 it was featured in the British TV drama &quot;Walk Away and I Stumble&quot; starring Tamzin Outhwaite. Due to that broadcast, the song reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Downloads Chart in late 2005. This song has also been used in a long-running UK television advert for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, broadcast between 2005 and 2008, and in the &quot;Extras&quot; Christmas Special in 2007. A version of the song was recorded by R&amp;B artist Maxwell in 1997 for his &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; EP.

Released as CD players were becoming increasingly popular, the original LP ended with &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot;, while &quot;Walk Straight Down the Middle&quot; was included as a bonus track on the CD and cassette versions of the album. The gap between these two tracks is slightly longer to indicate the album was intended to finish with &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot;. &quot;Walk Straight Down the Middle&quot; later appeared on the compilation &quot;The Other Sides&quot;.

A video collection called &quot;The Sensual World: The Videos&quot; was also released. It contained videos for the title song, &quot;Love and Anger&quot;, and &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot; (all directed by Bush herself), as well as excerpts from an interview Bush gave to the music TV channel VH1.

In May 2011, Bush released the album &quot;Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;, which featured new versions of four songs from &quot;The Sensual World&quot;, including the title song, now called &quot;Flower of the Mountain&quot;. Finally having received permission from the Joyce estate, Bush recorded a new vocal using Molly Bloom&#x27;s soliloquy as the lyric. Additionally, she re-recorded a sparse, piano-only version of &quot;This Woman&#x27;s Work&quot;. The new version of &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot; was released as a single, with an accompanying video.

The live version of &quot;Never Be Mine&quot; was included on her live album &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;, released in 2016. Although the song had not been performed before an audience, Bush included the live version in the recording.

In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including &quot;The Sensual World&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;While Bush&#x27;s famously fey voice would probably be enough to hold the disparate strands of &quot;The Sensual World&quot; together, the album takes its cue and colouring too from the hypnotically sinuous sway of the pipes on the title track,&quot; wrote Robert Sandall in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;There are some strapping power chords to be despatched here and there, most notably on &#x27;Love and Anger&#x27;, but the dominant mood is of Oriental reverie, similar in feel to that achieved latterly by Japan. And in fact the last track on side one, &#x27;Heads We&#x27;re Dancing&#x27;, reproduces that mysteriously &quot;sproingy&quot; bass sound favoured by Mick Karn.&quot;

In 1990, Bush received two nominations at the 10th Brit Awards in the categories Best British Producer and Best British Female. At the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards held the following year, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album.

&quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked &quot;The Sensual World&quot; at number 55 on its 2012 list of the best albums of the 1980s, writing, &quot;Blessed with one of music&#x27;s most wildly expressive voices, Bush takes each song further than she has to, resulting in an album that forms its own unique world.&quot;

==Comments from other musicians==
In December 1989, Robert Smith of the Cure chose &quot;The Sensual World&quot; as his favourite single of the year, &quot;The Sensual World&quot; as his favourite album of the year, and included &quot;all of Kate Bush&quot; in his list of &quot;the best things about the Eighties&quot;. Charli XCX named &quot;The Sensual World&quot; as one of the records that define her.

<text>USS &quot;Hardhead&quot; (SS-365), a submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the hardhead, a fish of the croaker family.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Hardhead&quot; was launched by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin on 12 December 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Inez Riddle McDonald, wife of Lieutenant Commander Eugene F. McDonald (Retired), President of Zenith Radio Corporation, and commissioned on 18 April 1944.

==Service history==
Following shakedown training in Lake Michigan &quot;Hardhead&quot; entered a floating dry dock at Lockport, Illinois, and was towed to New Orleans, Louisiana, where she arrived on 16 May 1944. She got underway from Algiers, Louisiana, on 22 May1944, and arrived at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, five days later. There she took part in additional training exercises before her arrival at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 July 1944.

===First war patrol, July – September 1944===
&quot;Hardhead&quot;, departed on her first war patrol 27 July and proceeded to her patrol area off the Philippines. Early 18 August she detected the east of San Bernardino Strait, and closed for a surface attack. The first well-directed salvo stopped the cruiser dead in the water; a second sent her to the bottom.

During the remainder of her first patrol &quot;Hardhead&quot; rendered lifeguard services during strikes by fleet aircraft on the Philippines and operated with a reconnaissance line during the Palaus operation. She arrived Fremantle, Australia, 26 September 1944.

===Second war patrol, October – December 1944===
&quot;Hardhead&quot;″s second patrol began as she departed Fremantle 24 October and set course for the Philippines. While steaming on the surface through the Sulu Sea October she discovered a life raft adrift. In it was Commander Bakutis, commander of a fighter squadron (VF-20) from the aircraft carrier , who had been in the water for six days after being shot down during America&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf.

Operating in a coordinated group with and , the submarine sighted a large cargo ship with escorts 8 November. After being driven off in one attack, &quot;Hardhead&quot; aggressively gained an ahead position and sank &quot;Manei Maru&quot;. It was during this attack that &quot;Growler&quot; was lost.

&quot;Hardhead&quot; performed lifeguard duty off Subic Bay in November and on 25 November came upon an escorted merchant ship. She sank a coast defense vessel, damaged the merchantman, and evaded a retaliatory depth charge attack. Soon afterward, the submarine returned to Fremantle, ending another patrol on 5 December.

===Third and fourth war patrols, December 1944 – May 1945===
Putting to sea again 24 December, &quot;Hardhead&quot; began her third war patrol in the South China Sea. Operating with and , &quot;Hardhead&quot; damaged several ships before sinking &quot;Nanshin Maru&quot; 2 February 1945. Following lifeguard duty for the B-29 strikes on Singapore she returned to Fremantle 15 February.

&quot;Hardhead&quot;″s fourth war patrol included a special mine-laying mission. She sailed 20 March 1945 and laid mines off French Indochina during the night of 2 April. The submarine then entered the Gulf of Siam, where after several attacks she sank cargo ship &quot;Araosan Maru&quot; 6 April. Following a visit to Subic Bay to reload 11 April – 15 April she patrolled the South China Sea, but found few contacts. American submarines had by this time reduced Japanese merchant activity to a trickle, effectively destroying the island nation&#x27;s lifeline to the outside world. &quot;Hardhead&quot; returned to Fremantle 16 May.

===Fifth and sixth war patrols, June – August 1945===
Sailing from Fremantle 18 June, &quot;Hardhead&quot; began her fifth war patrol, to be conducted in the Java Sea. She severely damaged a freighter with her deck guns 22 June, and next day sank four coastal defense craft during an attack on Ambat Roads with including submarine chasers &quot;Cha-42&quot; () and &quot;Cha-113&quot; (ex-Dutch minesweeper &quot;A&quot;) () and shuttle boat &quot;No. 8333&quot; southeast of the Masalembu Islands. The illness of her commanding officer forced &quot;Hardhead&quot; to end her fifth patrol 17 July at Onslow, Australia.

The submarine departed Onslow on her sixth and last patrol 18 July, and headed back into the Java Sea. On 23 July 1945, she torpedoed and sank the submarine chaser &quot;Cha-117&quot; (ex-Dutch &quot;Bantam&quot;) off the northeast coast of Bali (). She forced a merchant ship to beach 27 July but found few targets and returned to Subic Bay 10 August. Soon afterward the Pacific war ended. &quot;Hardhead&quot; sailed 31 August and arrived at San Francisco via Pearl Harbor 22 September 1945. She decommissioned 10 May 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at Mare Island.

===Post-war service, 1952–1972===
&quot;Hardhead&quot; was placed in commission in reserve 6 February 1952 and upon her arrival at New London for conversion was placed out of commission. Following her GUPPY IIA conversion, including streamlining, installation of a snorkel breathing apparatus, and larger storage batteries, the submarine recommissioned 24 March 1953. She joined the Atlantic Fleet for training exercises and tactical drills in the years that followed, operating mainly in the Caribbean and off the East Coast of the United States. She sailed for the Mediterranean 7 September 1956 to strengthen the 6th Fleet during the Suez Crisis.

In July 1958 &quot;Hardhead&quot;, joined Submarine Development Group 2, turning her attention from fleet operations to research and testing of equipment and tactical doctrine. She operated off the East Coast and in the north Atlantic, and by 1961 had won four consecutive &quot;E&quot; awards for her performance. &quot;Hardhead&quot; continued through 1972 to perform this vital work in maintaining the technical superiority and readiness of the fleet.
In 1962, Hardhead participated in the Cuban Missile Crisis.

===Honors and awards===
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with six battle stars for World War II service
* World War II Victory Medal

All six of &quot;Hardhead&quot;′s World War II combat patrols were deemed &quot;successful.&quot;

===Greek service===

&quot;Hardhead&quot; was decommissioned, struck from the Naval Register, and transferred (sold) under the terms of the Security Assistance Program to Greece. On 26 July 1972 raised the Greek flag at New London (Connecticut) by Lieutenant Commander Nikolaos Vassiliou and sailed to Greece on 29 December 1972. She was commissioned into the Hellenic Navy as &quot;Papanikolis&quot; (S-114). She was struck from the Greek Naval rolls on 4 May 1993.

<doc id="1159186" wikidata="Q899429" url="?curid=1159186" title="Seed crystal">
<text>A seed crystal is a small piece of single crystal or polycrystal material from which a large crystal of typically the same material is grown in a laboratory. Used to replicate material, the use of seed crystal to promote growth avoids the otherwise slow randomness of natural crystal growth, and allows manufacture on a scale suitable for industry.

==Crystal enlargement==
The large crystal can be grown by dipping the seed into a supersaturated solution, into molten material that is then cooled, or by growth on the seed face by passing vapor of the material to be grown over it.

==Theory==
The theory behind this effect is thought to derive from the physical intermolecular interaction that occurs between compounds in a supersaturated solution (or possibly vapor). In solution, liberated (soluble) molecules (solute) are free to move about in random flow. This random flow permits for the possibility of two or more molecular compounds to interact. This interaction can potentiate intermolecular forces between the separate molecules and form a basis for a crystal lattice. The placement of a seed crystal into solution allows the recrystallization process to expedite by eliminating the need for random molecular collision or interaction. By introducing an already pre-formed basis of the target crystal to act upon, the intermolecular interactions are formed much more easily or readily, than relying on random flow. Often, this phase transition from solute in a solution to a crystal lattice will be referred to as nucleation. Seeding is therefore said to decrease the necessary amount of time needed for nucleation to occur in a recrystallization process.

==Uses==
One example where a seed crystal is used to grow large boules or ingots of a single crystal is the semiconductor industry where methods such as the Czochralski process or Bridgman technique are employed.

Also during the process of tempering chocolate, seed crystals can be used to promote the growth of favorable type V crystals

<doc id="1159193" wikidata="Q1493698" url="?curid=1159193" title="Gants Hill tube station">
<text>Gants Hill is a London Underground station in the largely residential Gants Hill district of Ilford in east London. It is on the Hainault loop of the Central line between Redbridge and Newbury Park stations. The station is located in Travelcard Zone 4. It is the easternmost station to be below ground on the London Underground network and the busiest on the Hainault loop.

The station ticket hall is located beneath Gants Hill roundabout and reached via pedestrian subways. It opened on 14 December 1947 as an extension of the Central line to form the new phase of the Hainault loop. The station is known for its distinctive architecture featuring barrel-vaulted halls at platform level designed and created by Charles Holden.

==Location==
The station has taken its name from the Gants Hill roundabout, where the name Gants Hill could have originated from the le Gant family who were notable as stewards. The ticket hall is directly underneath the roundabout, located in the heart of Gants Hill district. The roundabout connects to Woodford Avenue, Eastern Avenue and Cranbrook Road. The station serves a mainly residential area, and is near Valentines Park, Valentines High School, and &quot;Faces&quot; Nightclub.

==History==
As part of the 1935–40 New Works Programme, the Central line was to be extended from Liverpool Street to south of Leyton where it would connect to and take over passenger operations on the London &amp; North Eastern Railway&#x27;s (LNER&#x27;s) suburban branch to Epping and Ongar in Essex. The section of the LNER&#x27;s Fairlop Loop (now known as Hainault Loop) between Woodford and Newbury Park was also to be transferred, though not the section south from Newbury Park to Ilford and Seven Kings on the Great Eastern Main Line. To replace the truncated route south from Newbury Park, a new underground section between Leytonstone and Newbury Park was constructed, running mostly under Eastern Avenue. Three new stations, which include Gants Hill were built to serve the new suburbs of north Ilford and the Fairlop Loop. During planning, the names &quot;North Ilford&quot; and &quot;Cranbrook&quot; were considered for this station.

Construction began before 1937 and most of the tunnelled section was completed by 1940 but delayed due to the outbreak of the Second World War and eventually came to a halt in June 1940. During the war, the station was used as an air raid shelter and the unused tunnels between the station and Redbridge were used as a munitions factory for Plessey electronics. Construction restarted after the war ended, with the line extended to Stratford on 4 December 1946, and then to Leytonstone on 5 May 1947. Gants Hill station opened on 14 December 1947 as part of an extension to Newbury Park.

==Design==

The station, like the other two new stations on the branch, was designed by architect Charles Holden in the 1930s. During the 1930s the London Passenger Transport Board had provided advice on the construction of the Moscow Metro and an internal report in 1935 by the Underground&#x27;s engineers on the Russian capital&#x27;s system led to the decision to construct a station in London to a similar design.

The station ticket hall is located beneath the roundabout at the centre of the road junction. It is accessed via a series of pedestrian subways and has no street level buildings, although low structures on the roundabout sit above the ticket hall and provide daylight and ventilation. From the ticket hall, three escalators lead to the barrel-vaulted lower concourse between the two platforms tunnels. The station also features miniature roundels on the tiles at platform level as well as the &quot;roundel clocks&quot;.

Gants Hill is the only Underground station with a concourse designed by Holden that has no surface buildings. Unlike Redbridge, the station is not Grade II listed although its distinctive architectural qualities have gained public support for listing the station.

==Services and connections==

<text>New York is a hamlet in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England, in the parish of Wildmore in the Lincolnshire Fens on the B1192 road near Coningsby, north of Boston. At the 2001 Census, its population was less than 150.

==Background==
A Methodist church was built in New York in 1872. It was purchased at auction by a private buyer in July 2011.

New York County Primary School is on Langrick Road, to the south.

The hamlet is the inspiration for the Gavin Bryars piece &quot;New York&quot;.

<text>The priestly breastplate or breastpiece of judgment ( &quot;ḥōšen&quot;) was a sacred breastplate worn by the High Priest of the Israelites, according to the Book of Exodus. In the biblical account, the breastplate is termed the &quot;breastplate of judgment&quot; ( &quot;ḥōšen mišpāṭ&quot; – ), because the Urim and Thummim ( &quot;hāʾūrīm wəhattummīm&quot;) were placed upon it (). These elements of the breastplate are said in the Exodus verse to carry the judgment ( &quot;mišpāṭ&quot;) of God concerning the Israelites at all times.

== Hebrew Bible ==
According to the description in Exodus, this breastplate was attached to the tunic-like garment known as an ephod by gold chains/cords tied to the gold rings on the ephod&#x27;s shoulder straps and by blue ribbon tied to the gold rings at the belt of the ephod. The biblical description states that the breastplate was also to be made from the same material as the ephod—embroidery of 3 colors of dyed wool and linen—and was to be of a cubit squared, two layers thick, and with four rows of three engraved gems embedded in gold settings upon it, one setting for each stone. The description states that the square breastplate was to be formed from one rectangular piece of cloth— of a cubit by of a cubit, folded so that it formed a pouch to contain the Urim and Thummim.

The Hebrew term for the breastplate, (&quot;ḥōšen&quot;), appears to be named from its appearance; The 19th-century German biblical scholar August Dillmann thought that it was likely to be derived from the Hebrew word (&quot;ḥōṣen&quot;), meaning &quot;fold&quot;, relating to its function.

According to the Talmud, the wearing of the Hoshen atoned for the sin of errors in judgment on the part of the Children of Israel.

== The jewels ==

According to the Biblical description, the twelve jewels in the breastplate were each to be made from specific minerals, none identical to another, and each of them representative of a specific tribe, whose name was to be inscribed on the stone.

According to a rabbinic tradition, the names of the twelve tribes were engraved upon the stones with what is called ‮שָׁמִיר‬‎ &quot;shamir&quot; in Hebrew, which Jewish legend explains to be a small, rare creature which could cut through the toughest surfaces. According to most authorities such as Rabbi David Kimhi and Rabbi Jonah ibn Janah, &quot;shamir&quot; was a stone stronger than iron, probably emery which finds its equivalent in the Greek, σμήρις (&quot;smeris&quot;).

There are different views in classical rabbinical literature as to the order of the names; the Jerusalem Targum, for example, argued that the names appeared in the order according to which they were born. Maimonides describes the jewel stones arranged in four rows, saying that on the first stone belonging to Reuben were also engraved the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, while on the last stone belonging to Benjamin were also engraved the words &quot;the tribes of God&quot;; kabbalistic writers such as Hezekiah ben Manoah and Bahya ben Asher argued that only six letters from each name were present on each stone, together with a few letters from the names of Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob, or from the phrase &quot;[these are] the tribes of Jeshurun&quot;, so that there were 72 letters in total (72 being a very significant number in Kabbalistic thought).

There was also a different order for the names inscribed on the two &quot;onyx&quot; stones on the High Priest&#x27;s shoulders. One opinion suggests that the names of the twelve tribes were arranged in groups after their mothers: Leah&#x27;s six sons aligned one after the other on one stone, with Judah heading this list, followed by Rachel&#x27;s sons with the names of the concubines&#x27; sons interposed between the two sons of Rachel. 

Unfortunately, the meanings of the Hebrew names for the minerals, given by the Masoretic text, are obscure and historically subjected to dispute. Several recent studies have developed a scientific methodology for identifying the jewels of the breastplate. &quot;Harrell, Hoffmeier &amp; Williams&quot; (2017) compared the Hebrew gemstones with attested gemstones from Ancient Egypt. &quot;Ayil&quot; (2024) compared the Hebrew names with names of gemstones from across the Ancient Near East, claiming to have identified 11 out of twelve with a high degree of certainty.

Though the Greek names for them in the Septuagint are more apparent, some scholars believe that they cannot be wholly relied on for this matter because the Septuagint&#x27;s translations are contradictory. Several Greek names for various gems have changed meaning between the classical era and modern times. Classical rabbinical literature argues that the names were inscribed using &quot;shamir&quot; because neither chisels nor paint nor ink were allowed to mark them out, whereas a more naturalistic approach suggests that the jewels must have had comparatively low hardness to be engraved upon. Therefore, this gives an additional clue as to the identity of the minerals.

Explanations of the symbolic meaning of the jewels generated a great deal of both Jewish and Christian writing and were a staple component of the tradition of lapidaries or books on gemology.

The names and proposed identities of the jewel stones are as follows:

=== First row ===

*&quot;Odem&quot; (אֹדֶם in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Sardios&quot; (in the Septuagint) – derives from the root meaning &#x27;red&#x27; and probably refers to carnelian or sard, a common gemstone in classical cultures. All authors agree that this stone was red. A parallel semantic development occurred in the Akkadian term &quot;sāmtu&quot; (&quot;carnelian&quot;), which derived from &quot;sāmu&quot; (also meaning &quot;red&quot;), suggesting that &quot;Odem&quot; referred to carnelian. Carnelian was a common gemstone in the surrounding regions of Egypt and Mesopotamia. Some modern translations translate this stone as being a ruby, even though rubies were unknown in biblical times.
*&quot;Pitdah&quot; (פִּטְדָה in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Topazios&quot; (in the Septuagint) – despite the suggestion of some interpreters that it was topaz, topaz was scarcely known at the time the Book of Exodus was written; in the classical era, &quot;topazios&quot; referred to Topazos Island (&quot;topazios&quot; means &quot;to seek&quot;, in reference to the difficulty in finding the island), on which a peridot was mined. Peridot, a light green semi-precious stone, was found in two Middle Kingdom scarabs discovered by Flinders Petrie and in Berenike&#x27;s Great Temple, respectively. The word &quot;pit&#x27;dah&quot; is thought by some scholars to be related to Greek &quot;topazios&quot;. In Ancient Greek literature, this word always refers to peridot.
*&quot;Bareḳet&quot; (בָּרֶקֶת in the Masoretic text, cf. בָּרְקַת) / &quot;Smaragdos&quot; (in the Septuagint) – &quot;Bareketh&quot; etymologically means &#x27;yellow-green&#x27;, whence its color. &quot;Smaragdos&quot; is cognate with &quot;emerald&quot;, but is somewhat of a false friend as the Greek term could apply to several different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. &quot;Smaragdos&quot; was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the stricter modern sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Emerald was not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Another mineral resembling the emerald is green jasper (taking into account the implication of &quot;Bareketh&quot; that it was green); there is much to be said for &quot;bareḳet&quot; being this stone. Although &quot;emerald&quot; is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, &quot;bareḳet&quot;, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezekiel 28:13), the word &quot;bareḳet&quot; is rendered as &quot;onyx&quot;. Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = &quot;barḳan&quot;, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba , the stone called &quot;bareḳet&quot; had veins or parallel bands of colors white, black, and red running through it, suggesting that it may have been a kind of agate or onyx. In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, &quot;baḳarani&quot; (believed to be a corruption of &quot;barḳan&quot;) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. This may explain why, in some French translations, the word is rendered as &quot;agate&quot;. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen&#x27;s &quot;Hexapla&quot;, has also written κεραύνιος in Exodus 28:17, literally meaning ‘of a thunderbolt’, following the resemblance of the Hebrew word &quot;bareḳet&quot; to the word &quot;baraḳ&quot; ‘lightning’. Jerome, however, understood the Greek word to mean &quot;onyx&quot;.. In the KJV Bible, the third stone is listed as a carbuncle, in Exodus 28:17.

=== Second row ===

*&quot;Nofekh&quot; (נֹפֶךְ in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Anthrax&quot; (in the Septuagint) – &quot;Nofekh&quot; appears to be a loan word, deriving from the Egyptian term &quot;&quot;, referring to turquoise, a frequently greenish blue stone. This mineral was most frequently mined in Egypt during the second millennium BCE at the sites of Serabit el-Khadim and Gebel Maghara in the Sinai Peninsula. While &quot;Anthrax&quot; means &quot;coal&quot; (presumably here referring to the color of burning coal), the Vulgate here has &quot;carbunculus&quot;, referring to the carbuncle, which was red. Philo of Alexandria, when writing about this stone, says that it was red. He seems to agree with Josephus, the LXX, and the Jerusalem Targum, the latter saying that it is כדכדנא, explained by Saadia Gaon as meaning &quot;karkand&quot;, a red variety of precious stone. In classical rabbinical literature, there is disagreement whether &quot;Nofekh&quot; was red or greenish blue; Exodus Rabbah and the second Jerusalem Targum favor it being red, while the Babylonian Targum and first Jerusalem Targum favor it being green.
*&quot;Sappir&quot; (סַפִּיר in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Sapphiros&quot; (in the Septuagint) – despite appearing to refer to sapphire, sapphire was essentially unknown before the era of the Roman Empire and its use in Greek texts is believed to be a mere transliteration of the Hebrew. Once it became more known, it was rendered in Greek and Latin as hyacinth or of jacinth. It is more likely that the term &quot;sappir&quot; referred to a mineral of similar color to sapphires and that the name gradually came to refer to the latter mineral on account of its color; scholars think the most likely candidate is lapis lazuli, a stone with a deep, ocean-blue color which was frequently sent as a gift to Akhenaten from Babylon. Theophrastus mentions the stone &quot;sapphirus&quot; as being &quot;dark&quot; and having the &quot;colour of verdigris&quot;, as well as being &quot;speckled as of with gold&quot;. By all accounts, his description fits the lapis-lazuli.
*&quot;Yahalom&quot; (יָהֲלֹם in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Iaspis&quot; ἴασπις (in the Septuagint) – in some other places the Septuagint instead has &quot;Beryllios&quot; where the Masoretic reads &quot;Yahalom&quot;. A few scholars have suggested that &quot;Yahalom&quot; may refer to diamonds, owing to their hardness, though the skill of cutting diamonds had not been discovered before the classical era. The Septuagint employs the word &quot;Iaspis&quot;, which Pliny the Elder only described as referring to a category of blue-green stones composed of a great number of mineral species. In the Syriac Peshitta of the sixth or seventh century (MS. B.21, Inferiore of the Ambrosian Library in Milan, Italy), the word used to describe this stone is ܢܩܥܬܐ = &quot;naq&#x27;atha&quot;, a word which is sometimes transliterated into Arabic as it is pronounced in Aramaic, mainly by Arabic-speaking Christians. Bar-Ali, a 9th-century Arab author, brings down two opinions about this stone, the &quot;naq&#x27;atha&quot;, saying, by one opinion, that it is &quot;honey-coloured&quot;, and by the other opinion that it is &quot;turquoise, a blue-coloured stone&quot;. In some versions of the Peshitta, the Aramaic word rendered for the same stone is &quot;shabzez&quot;, translated as &quot;diamond&quot;. This may account for today&#x27;s understanding of this word, although in ancient times &quot;yahalom&quot; may have meant something else. Other scholars have proposed a variety of quartz, especially the common milky quartz (known for its moon-like whiteness) or the sappharine variety of chalcedony, which was popular and precious in Mesopotamia at least, and has a moon-like bluish-white color. Spanish Jewish scholar Abraham ibn Ezra says the &quot;yahalom&quot; was a white stone.

=== Third row ===

*&quot;Lešem&quot; (לֶשֶׁם in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Ligurios&quot; (in the Septuagint) – the Hebrew name appears to be derived from Egyptian &quot;&quot;, referring to amazonite. This etymological translation stands in contrast to traditions following the Septuagint. Theophrastus mentions the fossilized pine resin, amber, called in Greek &quot;liggourrion&quot; or lyngurium, as does Dioscorides and Aëtius. In Greek antiquity, this stone was believed to have been the solidified urine of lynxes, and its name a mere corruption of &quot;lykos ouron&quot;, meaning &quot;white urine&quot;, presumably about its color. Pliny (who did not believe the stone existed) described the &quot;ligurios&quot; as having certain electrical properties, which some scholars have taken to imply that it referred to amber. Amber was one of the first items to have been discovered to have electrical properties (see Thales); the English stem &quot;electric&quot; derives from the Latin word for amber (&quot;elektrum&quot;). In the Latin Vulgate, the name was given as &quot;ligure&quot;, a Latinization invented by Flavius Josephus, and equated with lyngurium, but Luther used &quot;hyacinth&quot; (jacinth), and during the Renaissance belief in lyngurium died away. Modern scholars are inclined to think that the stone must have been similar to the pale color of natural gold (as opposed to the color known as &quot;gold&quot;); The Midrash Rabba states that the mineral had a black color, and is there named כוחלין, meaning the antimony known as stibium. Rabbi Saadia Gaon and other medieval rabbinical commentators argued that the gem itself was an onyx (Judeo-Arabic: גזע = جَزَع), although Abraham ibn Ezra casts doubt on the accuracy of Rabbi Saadia&#x27;s tradition. Modern English translations use either amber or jacinth.
*&quot;Ševo&quot; (שְׁבוֹ in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Achates&quot; (in the Septuagint) – &quot;achates&quot; definitely refers to a banded agate, and &quot;ševo&quot; may derive from the Akkadian term &quot;šubû&quot;, meaning agate. Agates were common in Egypt and Assyria and were regarded as potent talismans. Isidore of Seville lists agate as being among the black gems. The Midrash Rabba (Numbers 2:7) appears to argue for the jewel in question having been a grey variety. Conversely, in Rabbi Saadia Gaon&#x27;s (882–942 CE) Judeo-Arabic translation of the Pentateuch, as well as in the medieval Samaritan Arabic translation, the stone is rendered as سبج, meaning obsidian.
*&quot;Aḥlamah&quot; (אַחְלָמָה in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Amethystos&quot; (in the Septuagint) – &quot;amethystos&quot; refers to amethyst, a purple mineral which was believed to protect against getting drunk from alcohol (amethyst&#x27;s name refers to this belief, and literally translates as &quot;not intoxicating&quot;), and was commonly used in Egypt. However, most scholars agree that &quot;Aḥlamah&quot; is derived from Egyptian &quot;&quot; referring to red jasper, a mineral widely attested in Egypt. In the Babylonian Targum, &quot;aḥlamah&quot; is translated into a term meaning &quot;strong drinking&quot;, which appears to reference beliefs about amethyst, but in the Jerusalem Targum, it is translated into a term meaning &quot;calf&#x27;s eye&quot;. The Midrash Rabba , while describing the stone&#x27;s color, says: &quot;[It is] similar to clear wine whose redness is not too strong.&quot;

=== Fourth row ===
*&quot;Taršīš&quot; (‮תַּרְשִׁישׁ‬‎ in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Chrysolithos&quot; (in the Septuagint) – in some other places, the Septuagint instead has &quot;anthrax&quot; (meaning coal) where the Masoretic reads &quot;tarshish&quot;. &quot;Taršīš&quot; is thought by most scholars to be somehow related to the place Tarshish. &quot;Chrysolithos&quot; does not refer specifically to chrysolite, which was named much later, but is an adjective which translates as &quot;gold-stone&quot;, meaning that it was golden. As a golden material, it likely refers to amber, or to peridot (since &quot;chrysolithos&quot; could refer to peridot in the classical era). The 2nd-century Jewish translator, Symmachus, renders the word as &quot;yakinthos&quot;, meaning &quot;jacinth&quot;, or &quot;hyacinth&quot;. There is little certainty among scholars regarding which of these is the most likely to be the jewel in question.
*&quot;Šoham&quot; (שֹׁהַם in the Masoretic text) / &quot;Beryllios&quot; (in the Septuagint) – in some other places, the Septuagint instead has &quot;onychion&quot;, or &quot;smaragdos&quot;, or the phrase &quot;leek-green stone&quot;, where the Masoretic reads &quot;šoham&quot;; &quot;beryllios&quot; refers to beryl but earlier to the blue-green color of the sea, &quot;onychion&quot; refers to onyx, and &quot;smaragdos&quot; literally means &quot;green stone&quot; and refers to a bright columnar crystal (either beryl or rock crystal). Onyx is an opaque and banded stone, while &quot;smaragdos&quot; is translucent, and beryl is cloudy, and all these come in several colors. Onyx was apparently mined from the pre-exilic era, making it a viable candidate for &quot;šoham&quot;. &quot;Onyx&quot; is derived from the Greek for fingernail due to the pink-white veining. Because existing etymologies for &quot;šoham&quot; are problematic for one reason or another, the scholar Ephraim S. Ayil suggests a possible derivation from a reconstructed Old South Arabian word *&quot;šuwahbu(m)&quot; from the root &quot;w-h-b&quot; meaning &quot;gift&quot;. Jewish tradition generally favours leek-green beryl (heliodor) as the likely meaning of &quot;šoham&quot;, though scholars think it is more likely to be malachite, which can be green enough to be compared to &quot;smaragdos&quot; and the blue-green color of the sea (the original meaning of &quot;beryllios&quot;), is cloudy enough to be compared to a cloudy form of beryl, and is striped and opaque enough to be confused with a form of onyx. According to Epiphanius’ &quot;Treatise on the Twelve Stones&quot; (&quot;Epiphanius de Gemmis&quot;), the beryl was &quot;white like a cloud&quot;. Scholars point out that the Syriac form of the word is &quot;berūlā&quot; and/or &quot;belūra&quot;, the latter going back to a Pahlevi form (the old Persian tongue), and all in turn to the Sanskrit वैडूर्य = &quot;vaiḍūrya&quot; (Pali: &quot;veḷuriyaṁ&quot;), the gemstone which is called in English, &quot;cat&#x27;s eye, beryl&quot;, a variety of chalcedonic quartz that has a chatoyant luster resembling the eye of a cat when cut.
*&quot;Yošfe&quot; (‮יָשְׁפֶה‬‎ in the Masoretic text, cf. יָשְׁפֵה) / &quot;Iaspis&quot; (in the Septuagint and Josephus). Although &quot;yošfe&quot; and &quot;iaspis&quot; are cognate to &quot;jasper&quot;, they do not quite have the same meaning; while jasper can be any color, the mineral which the Greeks called &quot;iaspis&quot; was generally a blue or green one (the most prized form of jasper), and scholars think this is most likely to be the color referred to by &quot;yošfe&quot;. Since a blue chalcedony has been found bearing an Elamite inscription calling it &quot;yašpu&quot;, clearly a cognate of both &quot;yošfe&quot; and &quot;Iaspis&quot;, the biblical stone has been identified as a blue chalcedony. In the Targums, where the jewel is variously identified as a ruby (which is red), as a hyacinth (which is yellow), or as an emerald (which is green). In the Babylonian Talmud, one opinion states that the gemstone was the same as &quot;kadkhod&quot;, a stone described by Bar-Ali as being &quot;al-karkahan&quot; = الكركھن (the Baghdadi onyx), &quot;a kind of gemstone from which they cut [smaller] stones for setting in ouches&quot;. Rabbi Saadia Gaon, however, in his Judeo-Arabic translation of Isaiah, translates &quot;kadkhod&quot; as &quot;karkand&quot;, a red variety of precious stone. Josephus, quoting from one version of the Septuagint, says it was a beryl. Numbers Rabba 2:7 says that the stone was varicolored, meaning all of the colors combined were to be found in the &quot;yāšǝfêh&quot;.

=== 12 jewels in the New Testament ===
In the New Testament Book of Revelation is the description of a &quot;city wall&quot;, with each layer of stones in the wall being from a different material; in the original Koine Greek, the layers are given as &quot;iaspis&quot;, &quot;sapphiros&quot;, &quot;chalcedon&quot;, &quot;smaragdos&quot;, &quot;sardonyx&quot;, &quot;sardion&quot;, &quot;chrysolithos&quot;, &quot;beryllos&quot;, &quot;topazion&quot;, &quot;chrysoprason&quot;, &quot;yacinthos&quot;, &quot;amethystos&quot;. This list appears to be based on the Septuagint&#x27;s version of the list of jewels in the Breastplate – if the top half of the breastplate was rotated by 180 degrees, and the bottom half turned upside down, with &quot;Onchion&quot; additionally swapping places with &quot;Topazion&quot;, the lists become remarkably similar; there are only four differences:
* &quot;Onchion&quot; (literally &quot;onyx&quot;) has become sardonyx (red onyx)
* &quot;Anthrax&quot; has become &quot;chalcedon&quot; (literally meaning &quot;chalcedony&quot;, of which the red variety is the most common). &quot;Anthrax&quot; literally means &quot;coal&quot;, presumably the red color of burning coal.
* &quot;Ligurios&quot; has become &quot;chrysoprason&quot;. Scholars suspect that &quot;ligurios&quot; was a pale yellowish mineral, and although &quot;chrysoprase&quot; now refers to a specific gemstone which is generally apple-green in color, in earlier times it referred to gems of a yellowish leek-green, such as peridot; &quot;chrysoprase&quot; literally means &quot;golden leek&quot;.
* &quot;Achates&quot; (&quot;agate&quot;) has been replaced by &quot;yacinthos&quot; (&quot;jacinth&quot;). According to classical rabbinical literature, the specific agate was of a sky-blue color, and though &quot;jacinth&quot; now refers to a red-tinted clear gem, this was not the case at the time the Book of Revelation was written, and at that time &quot;jacinth&quot; appears to have referred to a bluish gem; Pliny describes &quot;jacinth&quot; as a dull and blueish amethyst, while Solinus describes it as a clear blue tinted gem – the modern sapphire.

===Pattern===
Whether there is any pattern to the choice of gemstones depends on their identity. Taking the majority view of scholars regarding the identity of the gems, and including the implication from the Book of Revelation that the &quot;onyx&quot; at the end of the fourth row was a &quot;sardonyx&quot;, there are four colors – red, green, yellow, and blue – each represented by a clear gem (red – carbuncle, green – heliodor, yellow – chrysolite, blue – amethyst), an opaque gem (red – carnelian/red jasper, green – green jasper, yellow – yellow jasper/yellow serpentine, blue – lapis lazuli), and a striped gem (red – sardonyx, green – malachite, yellow – pale golden agate, blue – sky-blue agate). The four colors of red, green, yellow, and blue are the first four colors (apart from black and white) distinguished by languages and are distinguished in all cultures with at least six color distinctions (the other two being black and white). These colors roughly correspond to the sensitivities of the retinal ganglion cells. (The retinal ganglia process color by positioning it within a blue to yellow range, and separately positioning it within a red to green range.)

<text>Walerian Czuma (24 December 1890 – 7 April 1962) was a Polish general and military commander. He is notable for his command over a Polish unit in Siberia during the Russian Civil War, and the commander of the defence of Warsaw during the siege in 1939.

==Biography==
At the outbreak of World War I Walerian Czuma joined the Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions. He was taken POW by the Russian Army and imprisoned in the Butyrka prison. Later he was sentenced to forced resettlement in Siberia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 he started to organise Polish military units in Siberia, which eventually became known as the Polish 5th Rifle Division.

After the collapse of Kolchak&#x27;s anti-Bolshevik movement, the Polish 5th Rifle Division, stranded in Siberia, was forced to surrender to the Red Army and Czuma was again imprisoned in Moscow, now Soviet Russia. After the Riga Peace Treaty he was allowed to return to Poland, where he rejoined the Polish Army.

From 1922 he served as the commanding officer of the 19th Infantry Division. Between 1927 and 1928 he was the commander of the Wilno Fortified Area. Later he was the commanding officer of the 5th Division. In March 1938 he was assigned to the Ministry of Internal Affairs as the commanding officer of the Border Guards (Polish &quot;Straż Graniczna&quot;). Between the wars Czuma was also an active member of several social organisations, among them the &quot;Guards of the Graves of Polish Heroes&quot; society which initiated the construction of Lwów Eagles mausoleum in Łyczaków Cemetery in Lwów.

After the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War of 1939 he declined to leave Warsaw together with the government and the civilian authorities. On 3 September Marshal of Poland Edward Śmigły-Rydz ordered the creation of an improvised Command of the Defence of Warsaw (&quot;Dowództwo Obrony Warszawy&quot;) and Czuma became its commander. He commanded all the units fighting in the Siege of Warsaw, for which he was awarded the Virtuti Militari medal.

On 28 September 1939, Czuma was taken POW by the Germans and remained in various POW camps for the rest of World War II. After he was liberated from the Oflag VII-A Murnau POW camp in Murnau am Staffelsee, Germany, by the American forces, he joined the Polish Army in the West. The new Soviet-dominated communist authorities deprived him of Polish citizenship and Czuma chose to remain an emigre in the United Kingdom, where he died at Penley near Wrexham in 1962. He was initially buried at Wrexham but in July 2004 his remains and those of his brother Władysław were moved to Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

He is an uncle of Andrzej Czuma, Polish politician.

<text>The Bahamas national football team is controlled by the Bahamas Football Association; it was founded in 1967 and joined FIFA in 1968. Bahamas has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup or the CONCACAF Gold Cup. They have been a part of CONCACAF since 1967.

==History==

The Bahamas played their first international matches in the 1970 Central American and Caribbean Games, losing their debut 3–0 against Puerto Rico, an 8–1 loss against Netherlands Antilles and 5–0 to Venezuela. They did manage to get their first draw though, a 2–2 result against Dominican Republic. The following year, Bahamas participated in the 1971 Pan American Games, achieving their first victory over Dominican Republic 4–2, but failing to exit the group stages. They returned to play in the 1974 Central American and Caribbean Games, and managed a historic 1–0 victory against Panama, but lost 3–0 to Bermuda and 2–0 to the Dominican Republic and was eliminated again in the first round.

Bahamas finished bottom of their group in the 1982 Central American and Caribbean Games and in the 1986 edition, they were given a bye into the quarterfinals due to a withdrawal, however Bahamas were beaten by Cuba and eliminated. They also participated in the qualifying rounds for the 1984 Olympic Games (eliminated by an amateur Mexico team) and the 1988 Olympics (beaten by Guyana). On 28 April 1987, the Bahamas experienced their worst defeat at the hands of the Mexican team, who crushed them 13–0 as part of the qualifying tournament for the 1987 Pan American Games.

In the 1990s, the Bahamas withdrew from 1998 World Cup qualifying, leaving Saint Kitts and Nevis to advance to the next round. Bahamas advanced past the preliminary round 1999 Caribbean Cup, but failed to beat Bermuda (0–6), Cuba (0–7) and the Cayman Islands (1–4) and finished last in their group.

The 2000s saw the &quot;Baha Boyz&quot; enter three consecutive World Cup qualifiers; 2002, 2006 and 2010 being eliminated by Haiti (aggregate score 13–0), Dominica (aggregate score 4–2) and Jamaica (aggregate score 13–0), respectively. In the 2007 Caribbean Cup they got through the first knockout round but finished in last position in the second qualifying round behind Barbados, Saint Vincent and Bermuda.

In the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, the Bahamas thrashed the Turks and Caicos Islands with an aggregate score of 10–0, advancing to the second phase however, the team withdrew from the competition as the renovations for the Thomas Robinson Stadium were not completed and playing the fixtures at neutral venues would have been financially prohibitive. In the 2018 World Cup qualifying, they faced Bermuda in the first round, losing 8–0 on aggregate. In the first round of 2022 World Cup qualification, Bahamas failed to score a goal, finishing in last place, having conceded 15.

<doc id="1159216" wikidata="Q4933689" url="?curid=1159216" title="Bob Prince">
<text>Robert Ferris Prince (July 1, 1916 – June 10, 1985) was an American radio and television sportscaster and commentator, best known for his 28-year stint as the voice of the Pittsburgh Pirates Major League Baseball club, with whom he earned the nickname &quot;The Gunner&quot; and became a cultural icon in Pittsburgh.

Prince was one of the most distinct and popular voices in sports broadcast history, known for his gravel voice, unabashed style and clever nicknames and phrases, which came to be known as &quot;Gunnerisms.&quot; His unique manner influenced a number of broadcasters after him, including Pittsburgh Penguins voice Mike Lange and Pittsburgh Steelers color analyst Myron Cope.

Prince called Pirates games from 1948 to 1975, including the World Series championship years of 1960 and 1971. Nationally, he broadcast the 1960, 1966, and 1971 World Series and the 1965 All-Star Game for NBC, as well as the first season (1976) of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot;. He also broadcast at different times for other Pittsburgh-area sports teams, including Steelers football and Penguins hockey.

==Early life and career==
Born in Los Angeles, California, Prince&#x27;s father was a former West Point football player and a career military man. An Army brat, he attended many schools before graduating from Schenley High School in Pittsburgh. An athlete himself, he lettered in swimming at the University of Pittsburgh. Prince worked for radio station WJAS, then landed a sports show on KDKA-TV. Prince joined Rosey Rowswell in the Pirates&#x27; broadcast booth as a commentator in , and he was promoted to the top spot shortly after Rowswell&#x27;s death in February 1955. He also broadcast Pittsburgh Steelers and Penn State football, Pittsburgh Hornets hockey and a Duquesne basketball game in the 1950s.
As a result of his distinct voice, knowledge of baseball, and high-profile persona, Prince was very popular among Pirates supporters. Prince was a fixture on team broadcasts for three decades on KDKA-AM, a clear channel radio station that could be heard throughout the eastern United States after sundown. He once claimed to have gone into the booth without anything more than a pencil, a scorecard, and his imagination; the approach of warm announcing and occasional rambling drew plenty of admiration from fans, albeit with detractors, most notably with Branch Rickey, who was general manager of the Pirates in the 1950s.

A regular smoker and social drinker, the fun-loving Prince jumped from the third floor of the Chase Hotel in St. Louis into a swimming pool in 1957, on a dare by Pirates third baseman Gene Freese. He became good friends with slugger Ralph Kiner and even formed a business to handle Kiner&#x27;s business interests. Prince, who also spoke Spanish, grew close with Roberto Clemente and was reportedly one of few people who could call him &quot;Bob&quot; on a regular basis. In the 1971 World Series, pitcher Bruce Kison had scheduled his wedding to take place after Game 7. Prince, in exchange for World Series tickets, found a way to get Kison a private jet so he could make his wedding.

===The Possum and The Gunner===
Many veteran observers believe Prince did his best work while paired with longtime sidekick Jim &quot;The Possum&quot; Woods and vice versa from 1958 through 1969, which coincided with the rise of the Pirates as a championship-caliber team. Indeed, it was roughly halfway through Woods&#x27;s debut season when Prince—inspired by Pittsburgh&#x27;s dramatically improved showing after nearly a decade mired deep in the National League&#x27;s second division—first dubbed Forbes Field &quot;The House of Thrills.&quot; It was Woods who first referred to Prince as &quot;The Gunner.&quot; Some say this was because of his staccato, rapid-fire style, others claim it was the result of an incident with a jealous, gun-toting husband. Woods allegedly recounted to an interviewer in Cleveland that two decades ago, during Woods&#x27; first spring-training with the Pirates in Fort Myers, Florida (1958), Prince had had a narrow escape from an encounter with a jealous husband who was packing a gun.

To be sure, no one bled black and gold like Prince did before or since. Invariably, when his Buccos were trailing in the late innings by two runs, he&#x27;d say, &quot;We need a bloop and a blast!&quot; If calling for three runs, he would say, &quot;We need a bleeder, a bloop and a blast!&quot; He would call a great double play a “Hoover job,” and his praise of Bill Mazeroski as perhaps the finest fielding second baseman ever was evident throughout Maz&#x27;s tenure with the Bucs. His great love, appreciation and respect for Roberto Clemente represented one of the few who didn&#x27;t downplay the great right fielder due to his playing for the non-elite Pittsburgh Pirates. Unique was Prince&#x27;s “excited voice,” an electrified component of his announcing which won the loyalty of Pirate fans forever. His cleverness slipped over into Woods&#x27; style as well, and by the mid-&#x27;60s, The Possum would be announcing the presence of pinch-hitter (and reserve catcher) Jesse Gonder with, &quot;Let&#x27;s go up yonder with Jesse Gonder.&quot; (The two would continue working together through the season, after which the flagship station KDKA refused to match a higher salary offer from KMOX in St. Louis for Woods to join Jack Buck in the Cardinals&#x27; booth; that partnership only lasted two seasons.) Prince was more of a rooter than a homer, in that he always showed respect to opponents and the game alike. Like the vast majority of broadcasters of his time, he rarely second-guessed players or managers. He was especially close friends with Milwaukee Braves pitchers Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette.

Prince would reunite with Woods on two separate occasions for the USA Network. The first was on July 26, 1979, for a game between the Pirates and Cincinnati Reds in Pittsburgh. The second occasion was on August 28, 1980, for another Pirates game in Pittsburgh against the Reds.

===&quot;The Green Weenie&quot;===
In 1966, Prince popularized a good-luck charm known as the Green Weenie, a plastic rattle in the shape of an oversized green pickle that Pirates fans used to jinx opponents. This came when he saw trainer Danny Whelan waving one while yelling at Astros pitcher Dave Giusti that he would walk a batter (which he did) in an ensuing Pirate victory. &quot;Never underestimate the power of the Green Weenie,&quot; he liked to assure listeners. At the height of the term&#x27;s popularity in 1966, Prince often punctuated the last out of a Bucs&#x27; victory by exclaiming, &quot;The Great Green Weenie has done it again!&quot; The pin&#x27;s shape and color is derived from the pickle-shaped pins distributed to schoolchildren when they toured the H. J. Heinz Company factory in Pittsburgh.

By late season, with the Pirates in a terrific pennant race with the Dodgers and Giants, some fans would parade a giant replica of the Green Weenie through the grandstand as a rally symbol. The hex symbol had started in the dugout with trainer Danny Whelan. Prince picked up on it and began talking about it on the broadcasts. No one thought to trademark the Green Weenie, so tens of thousands were sold in 1966, but Prince, Whelan, and the Pirates didn&#x27;t profit from it.

Pittsburgh finished in third place at , three games behind the league champion Dodgers; the Pirates lost their final three games, swept at home by the Giants.

Soon after control of the broadcasts changed from Atlantic Richfield to Westinghouse Broadcasting in 1969, Prince had personal conflicts with Westinghouse management. Pirates management often interceded to quell tensions between Prince and KDKA executives. Finally, in 1975, inexplicably, Prince and sidekick Nellie King were fired, a decision that Pirates management did not try to reverse, with regional director of Westinghouse Broadcasting Ed Wallis being labeled as the public target for fans to draw their ire. Pirates fans were shocked by the news. Egged on by competing radio station WEEP, hundreds of supporters held a parade and downtown rally. Several Pirates players also went to bat for him, but rehiring Prince was never a consideration. KDKA hired Milo Hamilton in December and distributed press kits at a news conference that had a cover sticker proclaiming, &quot;The New Voice of the Pirates.&quot; Hamilton was never popular with fans, later accusing Prince of badmouthing him and being &quot;bitter&quot;. After the 1979 season, Hamilton left, calling it &quot;living hell.” Lanny Frattare avoided the implied negativism toward Prince and worked as Hamilton&#x27;s junior partner and occasional play-by-play while going on to broadcast Pirates games with some significant acceptance until 2008.

After his time with the Pirates, Prince had stints calling Houston Astros baseball (1976), Pittsburgh Penguins hockey, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot;. On ABC, he was partnered with Warner Wolf and Bob Uecker. He was frustrated that ABC wouldn&#x27;t let him employ his usual style (the network encouraged talking without much personality) and was removed from the primary Monday night broadcast team during his first season () before being dropped altogether after the season. He also was released by the Astros after a one-year stay; he later said that Houston didn&#x27;t agree with him. His work with the Penguins was a cause of consternation for hockey fans because he didn&#x27;t understand the game and didn&#x27;t know the Penguins&#x27; personnel. Eventually he was taken off play-by-play and re-cast as an intermission interviewer. Eventually, he returned to Pirate baseball, thrilling his loyal fans, in 1982, calling a limited number of Pirates games for a cable station.

===May 3, 1985===
Three years after his return, KDKA and the Pirates decided to make Prince a member of the regular radio broadcast team in 1985. Broadcaster Lanny Frattare suggested that KDKA should launch a campaign to have Prince recognized with the Hall of Fame&#x27;s Ford Frick Award. At about the same time, independently, station executives Rick Starr and Chris Cross decided Prince should have a role on the radio broadcasts. The announcement came days after he had been released from a hospital for cancer treatments. Prince returned to the Pirates broadcast booth on May 3 to announce the middle three innings of the game between the Pirates and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Weakened from mouth cancer, Prince was able to announce only two innings but was given three standing ovations. The Pirates scored nine runs in the fourth, the first inning that Prince announced, one for each year of his absence from the booth. In the next inning Prince called for first baseman Jason Thompson to park one &quot;so we&#x27;ll have a little bit of everything,&quot; and Thompson homered; the Pirates won 16–2 to improve to .

The 1985 team finished last in the majors at . Willie Stargell had retired three years earlier, and most of the 1979 championship team had disbanded. The fourth inning broadcast announced by Prince on May 3 was the fifth-most runs scored in any one inning (9) in Pirates franchise history. A commentator on KDKA-TV (Channel 2) referred to it on the 6 p.m. news as the &quot;last revival of the Green Weenie,&quot; Prince&#x27;s good luck charm from 1966. Prince announced a few following homestands. Weeks later, he reported to the park for another game, but his illness forced him to go home after waiting through a long rain delay. Prince was unable to report for work again and was re-admitted to the hospital, where he died at age 68 on June 10. His brief funeral service on June 16 was attended by seven hundred.

==Honors and awards==
Prince was posthumously awarded the Ford C. Frick Award by the Baseball Hall of Fame as a broadcaster in . He also was a 1986 inductee in the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame.

Even today, his name remains synonymous with Pirates baseball including the naming of the new &quot;Gunner&#x27;s Lounge&quot; at PNC Park in 2012. In 1999, Prince was selected for the Pride of the Pirates award, a lifetime achievement honor given annually to a member of the organization.

<doc id="1159257" wikidata="Q5685506" url="?curid=1159257" title="Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt">
<text>Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt was a German field fortification, west of the village of Beaumont Hamel on the Somme. The redoubt was built after the end of the Battle of Albert (25–29 September 1914) and as French and later British attacks on the Western Front became more formidable, the Germans added fortifications and trench positions near the original lines around Hawthorn Ridge. At on 1 July 1916, the British fired a huge mine beneath the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. Sprung ten minutes before zero hour, the mine was one of 19 mines detonated on the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Geoffrey Malins, one of two official war cameramen, filmed the detonation of the mine. The attack on the redoubt by part of the 29th Division of VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Sir Aylmer Hunter-Weston) was a costly failure.

Hunter-Weston had ordered the mine to be fired early to protect the advancing infantry from falling debris but this also gave the Germans time to occupy the rear lip of the mine crater. When British parties advanced across no man&#x27;s land to occupy the crater, they were engaged by German small-arms fire. A few British soldiers reached the objective but at noon they were ejected by a German counter-attack. The success of the German defence of the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt crater contributed to the failure of the British attack on the rest of the VIII Corps front.

The British reopened the tunnel beneath the Hawthorn Ridge crater three days later and reloaded the mine with explosives for the Battle of the Ancre . The new mine was fired on 13 November in support of an attack on Beaumont-Hamel by the 51st (Highland) Division of V Corps. The Scottish infantry advanced from a trench from the German lines, half the distance of 1 July, with the support of tanks, an accurate creeping barrage and an overhead machine-gun barrage. Beaumont-Hamel was captured and prisoners taken.
==Background==

===1914–1915===
The 26th (&quot;Württemberg&quot;) Reserve Division Franz von Soden) of the XIV Reserve Corps, arrived on the Somme in late September 1914, attempting to advance westwards towards Amiens. By 7 October, the advance had ended and temporary scrapes had been occupied. Fighting in the area from the Somme north to the Ancre, subsided into minor line-straightening attacks by both sides. Underground warfare began on the Somme front, which continued when the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) took over from the French Second Army at the end of July 1915. Miners brought from Germany late in 1914 tunnelled under Beaumont-Hamel and the vicinity to excavate shelters in which infantry companies could shelter and against which even heavy artillery could cause little damage.
On the Somme front, a construction plan of January 1915, by which Falkenhayn intended to provide the western armies with a means to economise on infantry, had been completed. Barbed-wire obstacles had been enlarged from one belt wide to two belts wide and about apart. The front line had been increased from one trench to three, apart, the first trench () to be occupied by sentry groups, the second () to accommodate the front-trench garrison and the third trench for local reserves. The trenches were traversed and had sentry-posts in concrete recesses built into the parapet. Dugouts had been deepened from to , apart and large enough for An intermediate line of strong points (the ) about behind the front line had also been built. Communication trenches ran back to the reserve line, renamed the second line, which was as well built and wired as the first line. The second line was built beyond the range of Allied field artillery, to force an attacker to stop and move field artillery forward before assaulting the line.

===1915–1916===
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1915, a small mine was sprung under Redan Ridge north of Beaumont-Hamel, followed by German mine explosions on January. British mines were blown on January 1916 and both sides sprung mines in February; the Germans then dug a defensive gallery parallel to the front line to prevent surprises. On the night of a German raid by II Battalion, Reserve Infantry Regiment 119 (RIR 119) took place near Y Ravine, against the 2nd South Wales Borderers of the 29th Division and caused 112 casualties, for a loss of three killed and one man wounded. A big raid by the British on 30 April was seen by alert defenders and repulsed by small-arms fire and artillery as soon as it began. A report by the local German commander, showed that the preparations for the raid had been noticed a week before the attempt.

After the Second Battle of Champagne in 1915, construction of a third line another back from the had been begun in February 1916 and was nearly complete on the Somme front by 1 July. Divisional sectors north of the Albert–Bapaume road were about wide. German artillery was organised in a series of (barrage sectors). A telephone system was built with lines buried deep, for behind the front line, to connect the front line to the artillery. The Somme defences had two inherent weaknesses which the rebuilding had not remedied: The first was that the front trenches were on a forward slope, lined by white chalk from the subsoil and easily seen by ground observers. The second was that the defences were crowded towards the front trench, with a regiment having two battalions near the front-trench system and the reserve battalion divided between the and the second line, all within of the front line, accommodated in the new deep dugouts.

==Prelude==

===German preparations===
The headwaters of the Ancre river flow west to Hamel through the Ancre valley, past Miraumont, Grandcourt, Beaucourt and St. Pierre Divion. On the north bank, pointing south-east, lie the Auchonvillers spur, with a lower area known as Hawthorn Ridge, Beaucourt spur descending from Colincamps and Grandcourt spur crowned with the village of Serre. Shallow valleys link the spurs, the village of Beaumont-Hamel lies in the valley between Auchonvillers and Beaucourt spurs. A branch in the valley known as Y Ravine lies on the side of Hawthorn Ridge. In 1916, the front of VIII Corps lay opposite the line from Beaucourt to Serre, facing the series of ridges and valleys, beyond the German positions to the east. The German front line ran along the eastern slope of Auchonvillers spur, round the west end of Y Ravine to Hawthorn Ridge, across the valley of Beaumont-Hamel to the part of Beaucourt spur known as Redan Ridge, to the top of the Beaucourt valley to Serre. An intermediate line known to the British as Munich Trench began at Beaucourt Redoubt and ran north to Serre. The second position ran from Grandcourt to Puisieux and the third position was further back.
No man&#x27;s land was about wide from the Ancre northwards and narrowed to about beyond the redoubt on Hawthorn Ridge. The ground was flat and unobstructed, except for a sunken road from the Auchonvillers–Beaumont-Hamel road and a low bank near the German front trench. The German front had several shallow salients, flanks, a bastion at the west end of Y Ravine and cover in the valleys to the east. Beaumont-Hamel commanded the valley, which the VIII Corps divisions were to cross and had been fortified. Beaucourt Ridge further back, gave a commanding view to German artillery observers, who could see the gun flashes of British field artillery, despite the guns being dug in. British observers could not see beyond the German support trenches and the convex slope on the British side of no man&#x27;s land, making it difficult for heavy artillery to hit the front position, parts of which were untouched by the preliminary bombardment.

As signs of an Allied offensive increased during 1916, the lessons of the Second Battle of Artois and the Battle of Hébuterne in 1915, were incorporated into the defences of the Somme front. Observation posts were built in each defence sector, more barbed wire was laid and more telephone interception stations were installed, at the same time that more emphasis was laid on German telephone security. In early March and from the chief engineer of the 2nd Army inspected the first position in the area of the 26th Reserve Division; only in the area of RIR 119 at Beaumont-Hamel and the trenches to the west around Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, were there enough shell-proof concrete posts. German infantry made a great effort to gather intelligence, patrol and raid the British lines to snatch prisoners; the British became more experienced in responding to local attacks and began to use the same tactics. In May, Soden wrote that at least of artillery ammunition were necessary, to ensure the success of a raid. On the night of a raiding party of RIR 119 failed to get forward when the German artillery fired short.

===British preparations===
Special arrangements were made by the 29th Division to capture Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. Three tunnels were dug under no man&#x27;s land by tunnellers of the Royal Engineers. The first tunnel was to be a communication link to the Sunken Lane (shown in the film The Battle of the Somme, released in August 1916). British units had just moved into the Sunken Lane and the tunnel constructed by 252nd Tunnelling Company served to link it with the old British front line. In the early hours of 1 July, the 1st Battalion, The Lancashire Fusiliers were to use it to reach the Sunken Lane, ready to attack Beaumont-Hamel. Two other tunnels, First Avenue and Mary, named after the communications trenches leading into them, were Russian saps dug to within of the German front line, ready to be opened at on 1 July, as emplacements for batteries of Stokes mortars.

The 252nd Tunnelling Company placed mine H3 north of First Avenue and Mary, beneath the German stronghold on the ridge. The miners had dug a gallery for about from the British lines about underground beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt on the crest of the ridge and charged it with of Ammonal. The VIII Corps commander, Lieutenant-General Aylmer Hunter-Weston, wanted the mine to be sprung four hours before the offensive began so that the crater could be captured and consolidated in time for the alarm on the German side to have died down. On 15 June, the Fourth Army headquarters, ruled that all the mines on 1 July should be blown no later than eight minutes before zero; an unsatisfactory compromise was reached with Hunter-Weston to detonate the Hawthorn Redoubt mine ten minutes before zero hour.

An earlier detonation of the H3 mine in the VIII Corps sector was expected to divert German attention to the north bank of the Ancre, which would help the attacks of X Corps and XV Corps further south, where success was more important. Opinion in the 29th Division was that time was needed for the débris from the &quot;great mine&quot; to fall to earth, although it was demonstrated that all but dust had returned to the ground within twenty seconds. Firing the mine early conformed to the plan to occupy the crater quickly but it required the heavy artillery bombardment of the redoubt and adjacent trenches to lift during the assault. All of the VIII Corps heavy artillery was ordered to lift at and the field artillery to lift at A light shrapnel barrage fired by the divisional field artillery was to continue on the front trench until zero hour; in the 29th Division sector, half of the guns were to lift three minutes early.

===British plan===
The 29th and 4th divisions were to advance east across the valley of Beaumont-Hamel to an intermediate line on Beaucourt spur and then advance to the second position in hours. British artillery fire would lift off the German front trench at zero hour and the field artillery was to move eastwards in six lifts, from the first objective after zero and then lift in succession after about twenty minutes on each of the further objectives, the heavy artillery lifting five minutes earlier each time. The divisional field artillery was to lift for as each infantry advance began and then move east at per minute. Each division was to reserve two 18-pounder batteries ready to advance at short notice; visual signalling, runners, flares, signals to contact patrol aircraft and wide-angle signalling lamps were provided. Bombers (hand-grenade specialists in the infantry) carried flags to mark the front line.

==Battle==

===1 July===

A witness to the detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge mine was British cinematographer Geoffrey Malins, who filmed the 29th Division attack. Malins set up on the side of the White City trenches, about from Hawthorn Ridge, ready for the explosion at 

As soon as the mine was sprung, the bombardment on the German front line by heavy artillery lifted and Stokes mortars, which had been placed in advanced sites, along with four more in the sunken lane in no man&#x27;s land, began a hurricane bombardment on the front trench. The regimental history of RIR 119 recorded that


The detonation was the signal for the German infantry to at their shelter entrances. Two platoons of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Fusiliers (86th Brigade, 29th Division) with four machine-guns and four Stokes mortars, rushed the crater. As the British troops reached the near lip, they were engaged by small-arms fire from the far lip and the flanks. At least three of the 1st Platoon ( Renz) and the members of the 2nd Platoon ( Böhm) on the left side of the platoon area had been killed in the mine explosion. The entrances to the 3rd Platoon ( Breitmeyer) and some of the 2nd Platoon (underground shelters) caved in and only two escaped. The rest of the 9th Company in (deep-mined dug-outs) survived but the entrances were blocked and the troops inside were not rescued until after the British attack.

The detonation was swiftly followed by a German counter-barrage and in the next few minutes, German machine-guns opened fire all along the front. The British divisions forming up in no man&#x27;s land to reach the jumping-off position short of the German front line, were caught in the machine-gun fire and suffered many casualties. German troops occupied the far lip of the crater at the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, turned machine-guns and trench mortars to the right and left flanks and fired into the British troops as they tried to advance. The attack on the redoubt and the rest of the VIII Corps front collapsed and was a costly failure. By the only ground held by the 29th Division was the western lip of the crater. Two German platoons bombed from shell-hole to shell-hole towards the crater, forcing the survivors to retire to the British front line. RIR 119 suffered most in the mine explosion beneath the redoubt. Casualties in the 86th Brigade were whom killed and reported missing.

===13 November===
After the detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge mine on 1 July, the Royal Engineers began work on a new mine, loaded with of ammonal, which was placed beneath the crater of the first explosion. On 13 November 1916, two brigades of the 51st (Highland) Division attacked the first objective (green line) at Station road and Beaumont-Hamel, then the final objective (yellow line) at Frankfort Trench, with three battalions, the fourth providing carrying parties. Six minutes before zero, the leading battalion of the right brigade moved beyond the British wire and advanced when the new mine at Hawthorn Crater was blown.

The Scottish troops moved past the east end of Y Ravine and reached the first objective at with a stray party from the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division. The battalion pushed on and then withdrew slightly to Station Road. On the left, fire from Y Ravine held up the advance and at another battalion reinforced the attack. Troops skirted the ravine to the north and early in the afternoon, a battalion from the reserve brigade attacked Beaumont-Hamel from the south, troops in the vicinity joining in. The left flank brigade was held up by uncut wire to the south of Hawthorn Crater and by massed machine-gun fire north of the Auchonvillers–Beaumont-Hamel road. Two tanks were sent up, one bogging between the German front and support lines and the other north of the village. Consolidation began and three battalions were withdrawn to the German reserve line and reinforced at while one battalion formed a defensive flank to the south, as the positions reached by the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division on the right were unknown.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

The detonation of the Hawthorn Ridge mine, ten minutes before the general attack commenced, was not considered to be the main cause of the lack of surprise on 1 July. Lanes had been cut through the British wire, bridges had been placed over rear trenches several days earlier and a bombardment had been fired at each morning for a week. Zero Day was not known to the Germans but the imminence of the expected attack was made evident by the springing of the mine. The lifting of the heavy artillery bombardment made it safe for the Germans to emerge and occupy the front defences, despite the surface destruction caused by the preliminary bombardment and the cutting of much of the wire. The Hawthorn Ridge sector was not attacked again until 13 November, during the Battle of the Ancre. For this attack another mine was laid beneath Hawthorn Ridge, this time containing of explosives and Hawthorn Ridge as well as Beaumont-Hamel were captured.

The 51st Division had to cross of no man&#x27;s land, obscured by fog and supported by tanks, a creeping barrage and a machine-gun barrage, which caught German infantry in the open;the Highlanders took An analysis by the German 1st Army headquarters concluded that the positions were lost because of weeks of bombardment, part of which was from the flank and rear of the position, although the original deep-mined dug-outs survived. The British fired a hurricane bombardment each morning to lull the defenders with familiarity and the attack began in the morning after a short period of drumfire. Fog reduced the effect of the German counter-barrage and the front-line infantry were left to repulse the first attack. The 12th Division was severely criticised and the number of recruits in the division from Polish Upper Silesia was blamed on its poor performance. Troops had been slow to emerge from cover and were overrun, no initiative being shown by unit leaders or the divisional command, which failed to act until the 1st Army headquarters intervened.

===Commemoration===
In early 2018, after discussions between the landowners and the prospective members of the Franco–British Hawthorn Ridge Association, it was agreed that the ground comprising the craters and the path up to and around them would be sold to the local area of Albert, agreed to by the Mayor. In turn the Association would lease the land for a 99 year period for the nominal fee of €1. A multi-disciplinary research team then conducted three field seasons of research between 2018 and 2020 using UAV drones, surface Lidar, near-surface geophysics and archaeology to investigate the redoubt which was published in 2024.

<doc id="1159278" wikidata="Q614183" url="?curid=1159278" title="Killing Machine">
<text>Killing Machine (also known as &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot;) is the fifth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released in November 1978, by CBS Records internationally, and received a United States release on 28 February 1979, by Columbia Records. The album pushed the band towards a more commercial style while still featuring the dark lyrical themes of their previous albums. At about the same time, the band members adopted their now-famous &quot;leather-and-studs&quot; fashion image, inspired by Rob Halford&#x27;s interest in
leather culture. It is the band&#x27;s last studio album to feature drummer Les Binks.

==International and American versions==
The album was retitled &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; for its US release on 28 February 1979. Singer Rob Halford simply said that their US-label found &quot;Killing Machine&quot; too much of a heavy statement to use, and suggested the alternative title to the band. It was feared that the ‘murderous implications’ of the original title would be too much for the larger record retailers to want to put the LP on its racks. Both album titles are drawn from the titles of songs on the album with &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot;, an early Fleetwood Mac cover, being added to the US release.

The album was also pressed in red vinyl in the UK.

With &quot;Killing Machine&quot;, Judas Priest began moving to a more accessible, commercial format that abandoned the complex, fantasy-themed songs of their previous three albums. While this album still had dark undertones, it was more grounded in realism. This was reflected in their change of stage costumes from flowing Gothic robes to leather, but was also a reaction to the rising punk and new wave movements. K. K. Downing had expressed doubts about the new wave of British heavy metal stating &quot;everybody was totally dedicated to having their own show, their own images&quot;. Priest were part of the influence on the NWOBHM, but not part of it. The band&#x27;s new, simpler sound was the result of several factors, amongst them being a desire to compete with the energy and speed of punk rock, the need to produce songs that were easier to perform live, and the wish to appeal more to American audiences. Tracks such as &quot;Burnin&#x27; Up&quot; and &quot;Evil Fantasies&quot; are replete with S&amp;M themes while &quot;Running Wild&quot; is about late-night partying and &quot;Before the Dawn&quot; a depressing ballad. &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; reflected their newly adopted leather costumes as well as Rob Halford&#x27;s soon-to-be-trademark entrances on stage riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

The single &quot;Take On the World&quot; was an attempt at producing a stadium shoutalong tune in the mould of Queen&#x27;s &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, and was also covered by new wave band The Human League on their 1980 tour. The song&#x27;s influence endures : in 2021, the band Spoon released the single &quot;Wild&quot;, which samples its drum patterns from &quot;Take On the World.&quot; The record was released as a 7-inch single and was backed with a remix by Dennis Bovell which features the same drum pattern.

&quot;Hell Bent For Leather&quot; and a cover version of the Fleetwood Mac song &quot;The Green Manalishi&quot; were the two songs from &quot;Killing Machine&quot; which became standard parts of the band&#x27;s live setlist, with the other songs being performed rarely (&quot;Evil Fantasies&quot;, &quot;Running Wild&quot;, &quot;Rock Forever and &quot;Take On the World&quot;) or not at all. &quot;Running Wild&quot; and &quot;Delivering The Goods&quot; became regulars on the Firepower tour setlists in 2018 after not being played since 1980, and the title track returned to the band&#x27;s setlists at a show in Paris in January 2019 after being absent for 40 years.

The lyrics on the album were simplified somewhat in comparison with the band&#x27;s previous albums, adapted into a more mainstream arena rock format, but the instrumentation retains the band&#x27;s characteristic aggressiveness with heavier guitar riffing and elements of Blues influence returning on some songs. The album is certified gold by the RIAA.

==Reissues==
The album was remastered in 2001, with two bonus tracks added (three in the UK). The bonus track &quot;Fight for Your Life&quot; was the &quot;original&quot; version of Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Rock Hard Ride Free&quot; from their &quot;Defenders of the Faith&quot; album. &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two-Pronged Crown)&quot; is considered a bonus track on the UK remaster, but a regular track on the U.S. version.

In 2010, audiophile label Audio Fidelity released a limited-edition 24-karat gold CD of &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot;. Mastering was done by Steve Hoffman. This does not contain the bonus tracks from the 2001 edition.

==Recording and production==
This is the first Judas Priest album where Glenn Tipton incorporated the guitar technique of tapping into his soloing style, which had been popularized by Eddie Van Halen earlier that year with the release of Van Halen&#x27;s popular debut album (which incidentally was released the same day as &quot;Stained Class&quot;). This can be heard in the solos of &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; and &quot;Killing Machine&quot;.

This is also the final studio album for drummer Les Binks who had joined the band in early 1977 in time for the &quot;Sin After Sin tour&quot;; he is credited with helping develop the traditional Priest percussive sound. Binks was dropped and replaced by drummer Dave Holland after the 1979 tour because of a financial disagreement where the band&#x27;s manager Mike Dolan wanted Binks to &quot;waive his fees&quot; for performing on the platinum-selling 1979 live album &quot;Unleashed in the East&quot;.

==Critical reception==
In 2005, &quot;Killing Machine&quot; was ranked number 321 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. This album, as well as subsequent albums by the band, have somewhat divided fans, with some preferring the complexity and darkness of the early albums, while others prefer the more mainstream and polished later albums.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;Hell Bent for Leather&quot; is featured in Ari Gold&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Adventures of Power&quot;, the 2004 episode of the sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; entitled &quot;Surprise, Surprise&quot; and also featured in 2009 game &quot;Guitar Hero: Metallica&quot;.

<doc id="1159283" wikidata="Q9095379" url="?curid=1159283" title="Web Services Invocation Framework">
<text>The Web Services Invocation Framework (WSIF) supports a simple and flexible Java API (Application Programming Interface) for invoking any Web Services Description Language (WSDL)-described service.

Using WSIF, WSDL can become the centerpiece of an integration framework for accessing software running on diverse platforms which use different protocols. The software needs to be described using WSDL and have a binding included in its description ,that the client&#x27;s WSIF framework has a provider for. WSIF defines and comes packaged with providers for local Java, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), Java Message Service (JMS), and Java EE Connector Architecture (JCA) protocols, which means that a client can define an EJB or a Java Message Service-accessible service directly as a WSDL binding and access it transparently using WSIF, using the same API one would use for a SOAP service or a local Java class.

== Structure ==
In WSDL, a binding defines how to map between the abstract &quot;PortType&quot; and a real service format and protocol. For example, the SOAP binding defines the encoding style, the &quot;SOAPAction&quot; header, the namespace of the body (the targetURI), and so forth.

WSDL allows multiple implementations for a Web service and multiple ports that share the same PortType. In other words, WSDL allows the same interface to have bindings to services such as SOAP and IIOP.

WSIF provides an API to allow the same client code to access any available binding. Since the client code can be written to the PortType, the choice of which port and binding it uses can be determined by deployment, configuration settings, or code

The WSIF uses &quot;providers&quot; to support these multiple WSDL bindings. A provider is a piece of code that supports a WSDL extension and allows invocation of the service through that particular implementation. WSIF providers use the J2SE JAR service provider specification, making them discoverable at runtime.

Clients can utilize new implementations and delegate the choice of port to the infrastructure and runtime, which allows the implementation to be chosen on the basis of quality of service characteristics or business policy.

== Bindings for EJBs, JMS, and JCA ==
WSIF defines additional binding extensions so that Enterprise JavaBean (EJBs), local Java classes, software accessible over message queues using the Java Message Service (JMS) API, and software that can be invoked using the Java Connector architecture can also be described in WSDL. WSIF is packaged with providers that enable transparent invocation based on the corresponding WSDL description..

== Description ==
WSIF enables developers to interact with abstract representations of Web services through their WSDL descriptions instead of working directly with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) APIs, which is the usual programming model. With WSIF, developers can work with the same programming model regardless of how the Web service is implemented and accessed.

WSIF allows stubless or completely dynamic invocation of a Web service, based upon examination of the metadata about the service at runtime. It also allows updated implementations of a binding to be plugged into WSIF at runtime, allowing the calling service to defer choosing a binding until runtime.

It is closely based on WSDL enabling it to invoke any service that can be described in the language.

If a complicated enterprise software system consists of various pieces of software, developed over a period of decades—EJBs, legacy apps accessed using Java&#x27;s connector architecture, SOAP services hosted on external servers, old code accessed through messaging middleware—it is necessary to write software applications that use all these pieces to do useful things, where differences in protocols and mobility of software conflict with each other.

If the software is moved to a different server, the code breaks. The SOAP libraries used change—for example, when transitioning from using Apache SOAP to Apache Axis, as it employs a now-deprecated SOAP API. Something that was previously accessible as an EJB is now available through messaging middleware via JMS—again, the code that uses the software must be fixed, or if one has an EJB which is offered as a SOAP service to external clients. Using SOAP results in a performance penalty compared to accessing the EJB directly.

WSIF resolves these issues by enabling WSDL to serve as a normalized description of disparate software and allowing users to access this software without depending on a specific protocol or location. The separation of the API from the actual protocol also means there is flexibility—protocols, location, etc. can be switched without having to recompile client code. If an externally available SOAP service becomes available as an EJB, users can use RMI/IIOP by changing the service description (the WSDL), without making any modification in applications that use the service. WSDL&#x27;s extensibility, its capability to offer multiple bindings for the same service, deciding on a binding at runtime, etc. can be exploited.

== Differences between WSIF and Axis ==

Axis is an implementation of SOAP. It includes on the server-side infrastructure for deploying web service implementations and then routing SOAP messages between clients and those implementations. It also implements the JAX-RPC specification for invoking SOAP services.

WSIF is similar to the client piece of Axis, in that it is used for invoking services. However, WSIF&#x27;s API is WSDL-driven and protocol independent; it allows protocol-specific code (&quot;providers&quot;) to be plugged in. For invoking SOAP services, WSIF is packaged with an Axis provider, that uses Axis APIs (i.e. JAX-RPC) to do the invocation. So WSIF operates at a more abstract level than Axis.

== Differences between WSIF and JAX-RPC ==

JAX-RPC is an API for invoking XML-based RPC services – the current scope is limited to invocation of SOAP services. WSIF is an API for invoking WSDL-described services, whether they happen to be SOAP services or not (for example, WSIF defines WSDL bindings so that EJBs, enterprise software accessible using JMS or the Java Connector architecture as well as local Java classes can all be described as first-class WSDL services and then invoked using the same, protocol-independent WSIF API).

<doc id="1159290" wikidata="Q951023" url="?curid=1159290" title="Cabeus (crater)">
<text>Cabeus is a lunar impact crater that is located about from the south pole of the Moon. At this location the crater is seen obliquely from Earth, and it is almost perpetually in deep shadow due to lack of sunlight. Hence, not much detail can be seen of this crater, even from orbit. Through a telescope, this crater appears near the southern limb of the Moon, to the west of the crater Malapert and to the south-southwest of Newton.

== Description ==

The crater name &quot;Cabeus&quot; first appeared in the 1651 work &quot;Almagestum Novum&quot; by Giovanni Riccioli, who named it after Niccolò Cabeo. However, the position of the Cabeus crater was in the location later assigned to Newton crater. The official name and location for this crater was adopted by the IAU Commission 17, as established in the 1935 work &quot;Named Lunar Formations&quot; by Mary A. Blagg and Karl Müller.

This crater is a worn formation that has been eroded by subsequent impacts. The rim is eroded and uneven, with prominent ridges at the northern and southern ends. A small crater lies across the northeastern rim and there is 10–11 km crater on the interior floor near the west-southwestern rim. Near the center of the crater floor is a small ridge. The floor of the crater has an average depth of 4 km and it is 60 km across. The slope of the crater walls is 10–15°.

Because of the crater&#x27;s location near the lunar south pole, the main part of the crater is illuminated by the Sun during only 25% of each lunar day. The inner walls receive illumination for 30% of a lunar day, while part of the western end of the crater is in permanent shadow.

== Volatiles ==

The south polar region of the Moon was surveyed by the Lunar Prospector spacecraft and a hydrogen signature was detected. Potential sources for this hydrogen include water deposits from comet or meteorite impacts, the solar wind or out-gassing. This crater is sufficiently large that the temperature within the shaded region is below . This would allow water ice to remain on or near the crater surface for billions of years without sublimating.

=== LCROSS ===


The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration launched the LCROSS, impactor spacecraft on 18 June 2009, to look for water at the Lunar south pole. On 28 September 2009, Cabeus proper was selected as the impact target for the LCROSS mission, switching the target from satellite crater Cabeus A. The change was made after review of the latest data gathered by other lunar exploration craft, which indicated that Cabeus proper had a higher concentration of hydrogen than Cabeus A.

At 11:31 UTC on 9 October 2009 the Centaur upper stage of its Atlas V carrier rocket impacted Cabeus, followed shortly thereafter by the impact of the LCROSS spacecraft itself. The impact of the Centaur was intended to throw up a plume of lunar surface material to be sampled by sensors carried on the LCROSS spacecraft as it traversed the plume. But the debris plumes were smaller than predicted. Preliminary data from the LCROSS spectrometer measurements of the impact plume appeared to confirm the presence of water in the crater.

Analysis of the plume observations supports the presence of water in the regolith. Absorption in the near-infrared can be attributed to ice and water vapor, while emissions in the ultraviolet indicate the presence of hydroxyl radicals, which also supports the likelihood of water. The estimated total amount of water vapor and ice in the plume is up to , or an estimated by mass. The spectral signatures of other volatiles were observed, matching the signatures of carbon dioxide, light hydrocarbons, and sulfur-bearing compounds.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Cabeus.

<text>Stained Class is the fourth studio album by English heavy metal band Judas Priest, released on 10 February 1978 by Columbia Records. It is the first of three Judas Priest albums recorded with drummer Les Binks, as well as the first to feature the band&#x27;s now well-known logo in the artwork. Musically, &quot;Stained Class&quot; is considered the album on which the band honed many of the elements of their hard-edged signature sound, dispensing with most of the progressive and blues rock overtones and softer ballads of previous efforts. The album features such notable tracks as &quot;Exciter&quot;, considered an early precursor to speed metal and thrash metal, a cover version of &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot; by Spooky Tooth – which became the subject of an infamous civil suit in 1990 which alleged the song subliminally influenced two teenaged boys to make a suicide pact – and “Beyond the Realms of Death”, which is considered one of the band’s greatest songs by many fans and frequently included in the band’s live setlists.

Upon release, &quot;Stained Class&quot; was a modest commercial success, reaching number 27 on the UK Albums Chart and becoming the band&#x27;s first LP to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; it was eventually certified gold in the latter country. Retrospectively, it is regarded by some as one of the most important and influential albums in the development of heavy metal and one of Judas Priest&#x27;s best records, as well as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.

==Overview==
&quot;Stained Class&quot; is the only Judas Priest album to feature songwriting by all five members of the band. Newly added drummer Les Binks earned a songwriting credit for &quot;Beyond the Realms of Death&quot;, and bassist Ian Hill received his first songwriting credit for co-writing &quot;Invader&quot; with vocalist Rob Halford and lead guitarist Glenn Tipton.

Artist Rosław Szaybo&#x27;s cover artwork introduced the now-classic Judas Priest logo, replacing the Gothic Script logo which appeared on all of the band&#x27;s previous albums. &quot;Stained Class&quot; was the first Judas Priest album to crack the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was eventually certified gold in the US.

Dennis MacKay was brought in by CBS Records to produce the album. His resume at the time consisted mainly of jazz fusion artists and more progressive rock artists such as David Bowie and Supertramp. The recording sessions for &quot;Stained Class&quot; took place in October and November 1977 at Chipping Norton Recording Studios in Oxfordshire.

&quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot; was a last-minute addition to the album when CBS Records insisted on including something with commercial potential to liven up an album they felt had a very dark and sinister tone. The song was recorded with producer James Guthrie separately from the rest of the album, as MacKay had moved on to other projects and was no longer available. The band was reportedly so impressed with Guthrie&#x27;s production on &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot; that they asked him to produce their next album, &quot;Killing Machine&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Steve Huey of AllMusic described &quot;Stained Class&quot; as &quot;Judas Priest&#x27;s greatest achievement&quot;, commenting, &quot;This is the point where Priest put it all together, embracing their identity as the heaviest band on the planet and taking the genre to new heights of power, speed, musicality, and malevolence.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Stained Class&quot; was ranked number 307 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2017, it was ranked 43rd in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

After the success of subsequent Judas Priest albums in the US, &quot;Stained Class&quot; would eventually be certified Gold.

The song &quot;Invader&quot; was finally added to the band&#x27;s setlists in 2021, making &quot;Heroes End&quot; the only song off the album that has never been performed live.

==Lawsuit==

Twelve years after its release, &quot;Stained Class&quot; was the subject of a 1990 civil action brought against the band by the family of a teenager, James Vance, who entered into a suicide pact with his friend Ray Belknap after allegedly listening to &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot; on 23 December 1985. Belknap succeeded in killing himself, and Vance was left critically injured after surviving a self-inflicted gunshot to the face, eventually dying of a methadone overdose three years later. The suit alleged that Judas Priest recorded subliminal messages on the song that said &quot;do it&quot;. The suit was eventually dismissed. The song was originally written and performed by the band Spooky Tooth.

Three weeks after the lawsuit wrapped up, the band kicked off their Painkiller Tour by playing &quot;Better by You, Better than Me&quot; on the first concert in Burbank, California on 13 September. It is Judas Priest&#x27;s only live performance of the song since 1979.

Comedian Bill Hicks ridiculed the lawsuit as part of his act, pointing out (as many others have also done) the absurdity of the notion that a successful band would wish to kill off their purchasing fanbase.

<doc id="1159294" wikidata="Q304454" url="?curid=1159294" title="Abadan Crisis">
<text>The Abadan Crisis ( &quot;Bohrân Nafti Irân&quot;, &quot;Iran Oil Crisis&quot;) occurred from 1951 to 1954, after Iran nationalised the Iranian assets of the BP controlled Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) and expelled Western companies from oil refineries in the city of Abadan.

==Prelude==
The AIOC was the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;single largest overseas asset&quot; and a &quot;source of national pride&quot; in the British post-war era of Clement Attlee and Ernest Bevin. Even as late as the &quot;1940s and early 1950s some high British officials still believed that Persian petroleum was actually and rightly British petroleum because it had been discovered by the British, developed by British capital, and exploited through British skill and British ingenuity.&quot;

In stark contrast, Iranian Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh believed the 1933 concession granted to the AIOC by Iran was &quot;immoral as well as illegal&quot;. Mosaddeq &quot;challenged every aspect of the British commercial presence in Iran&quot;. The British feared that if Mosaddeq&#x27;s policies prevailed, &quot;nationalists throughout the world could abrogate British concessions with impunity.&quot;

==Nationalization==
The AIOC was nationalized by the Iranian Parliament in March 1951. In Iran this was enormously popular and seen as a long overdue staunching of the bleeding of its national wealth which could now be harnessed to fighting poverty in Iran. In Britain, the nationalisation was widely seen as an intolerable breach of contract or theft. British emissaries in the United States after the nationalisation, argued that allowing Iran to nationalise the oil company &quot;would be widely regarded as a victory for the Russians&quot; and would also &quot;cause a loss of one hundred million pounds per annum in the United Kingdom&#x27;s balance of payments, thus seriously affecting our rearmament program and our cost of living.&quot;

British warships blockaded Abadan. On 22 August, the British cabinet imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran. It prohibited exports of key British commodities, including sugar and steel, directed the withdrawal of all British personnel from Iranian oil fields and all but a hard core of about 300 administrators from Abadan and blocked Iran&#x27;s access to its hard currency accounts in British banks.

After the withdrawal of the British workers in the fall of 1951, the Iranians felt confident that they could easily hire non-British technicians to run the industry and then quickly train their own nationals to replace them. This did not prove to be the case; the United States, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and West Germany all refused to make their technicians available to the nationalized Iranian industry. Only Italy agreed, demonstrating that most industrialized countries supported Britain over Iran in the nationalization dispute.&quot;

In July 1952, the Royal Navy intercepted the Italian tanker &quot;Rose Mary&quot; and forced it into the British protectorate of Aden on the grounds that the ship&#x27;s petroleum was stolen property. News that the Royal Navy was intercepting tankers carrying Iranian oil scared off other tankers and effectively shut down oil exports from Iran.

==Coup d&#x27;état==

The prime minister, who was selected by the Shah and approved by the Majlis, was overthrown on 19 August 1953, following a coup d&#x27;état orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States. During the coup, codenamed Operation Ajax, the CIA and MI6 restored Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. In August 1954, the AIOC was set under the control of an international consortium. Initially, ownership shares in the consortium proposed to be divided along the following lines: 40% to be divided equally (8% each) among the five major American companies with BP to have a 40% share, Shell 14% and CFP 6%. Iran now received 25% of the profits compared to 20% of the original treaty with the AIOC. Saudi Arabia and other oil-exploiting countries of the region received up to 50% of the profits in cooperation with American oil companies at the same time.

In April 1951, the Majlis nationalized the Iranian oil industry by a unanimous vote, and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) was formed, displacing the AIOC. The AIOC withdrew its management from Iran and organized an effective worldwide embargo of Iranian oil. The British government, which owned the AIOC, contested the nationalization at the International Court of Justice at The Hague, but its complaint was dismissed. NIOC was established right after nationalization of oil.

<text>de Gerlache is a lunar impact crater that is located along the southern limb of the Moon, within a crater diameter of Shackleton at the south pole. From the Earth this crater is seen from the edge, and it lies in perpetual darkness. Thus little or no detail can be seen of this crater, other than the edge of the rim. However, the crater is clearly visible in Earth-based radar images. The crater is roughly circular, with some slight wear. No craters of note overlie the rim, although some formations may be attached to the southern and western edges.

The crater was identified by Jean-Luc Margot and Donald B. Campbell who jointly proposed the name to the International Astronomical Union. The name, honoring the Belgian explorer Adrien de Gerlache, was adopted by the IAU in 2000. In April 2023, a smaller crater on the floor of de Gerlache was named Brill by the IAU.

<doc id="1159298" wikidata="Q3962539" url="?curid=1159298" title="Skippy (peanut butter)">
<text>Skippy is an American brand of peanut butter manufactured in the United States and China. First sold in 1932, Skippy is currently manufactured by Hormel Foods, which bought the brand from Unilever in 2013. It is the best-selling brand of peanut butter in China and second only to the J.M. Smucker Company&#x27;s Jif brand worldwide.

== Brand name ==
The name &quot;Skippy&quot; was trademarked in 1925 by Percy Crosby, creator of the popular &quot;Skippy&quot; comic strip (1923–1945), which had been adapted into the 1929 novel &quot;Skippy&quot;, the daytime children&#x27;s radio serial &quot;Skippy&quot; (1932–1935), and the Oscar-winning 1931 film &quot;Skippy&quot;. 

In 1932, the Alameda, California food packer Joseph L. Rosefield began to sell Skippy. Crosby successfully had the trademark invalidated in 1934. Rosefield persisted using the name and after Crosby was committed to an asylum and after the passage in 1946 of the Lanham Act, Rosefield was granted rights to the trademark.

== Product ==
In 1955, Rosefield sold the brand to Best Foods. Its successor companies, most recently Unilever and Hormel, claim rights to the trademark over the objection of Crosby&#x27;s heirs, and much litigation has occurred on this point over the decades, some of which has continued into the 2000s.

Skippy is sold in many different sizes, including a jar, known as the &quot;Family Jar&quot;. In late 2000, Skippy reduced their standard jar size from to by adding a &quot;dimple&quot; in the bottom of the jar while retaining the jar&#x27;s height and diameter.

==Production==
Skippy has factories in Little Rock, Arkansas, and Shandong Province, China. About 750,000 pounds of peanuts are brought daily to the Skippy Peanut Butter plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, resulting in over 3.5 million pounds of peanut butter produced each week. 

There are 14 different varieties of Skippy Peanut Butter Spread. 

* Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter 
* Skippy Super Chunk Peanut Butter 
* Skippy Roasted Honey Nut Creamy Peanut Butter 
* Skippy Reduced Fat Creamy Peanut Butter 
* Skippy Reduced Fat Super Chunk Peanut Butter 
* Skippy Peanut Butter Blended with Plant Protein Creamy
* Skippy Peanut Butter Blended with Plant Protein Chunky
* Skippy Creamy Peanut Butter Spread No Sugar Added
* Skippy Chunky Peanut Butter Spread No Sugar Added
* Skippy Natural Creamy Peanut Butter Spread
* Skippy Natural Creamy Peanut Butter Spread with Honey
* Skippy Natural Super Chunk Peanut Butter Spread
* Skippy Natural Super Chunk Peanut Butter Spread with Honey
* Skippy Natural Creamy 1/3 Less Sodium &amp; Sugar Peanut Butter Spread

Skippy is also available in a 6 oz. squeeze pack in Creamy or Natural Peanut Butter Spread and 1.15 oz. individual squeeze 8 packs in Creamy or Natural Peanut Butter Spread. 

In 2018, Skippy added Skippy P.B. Fruit Bites to their Skippy P.B. Bites that were already available in Double Peanut Butter, Pretzel and Graham Cracker. 

On September 12, 2018, Skippy announced a new line of Skippy P.B. &amp; Jelly Minis in Peanut Butter &amp; Grape Jelly, Natural Peanut Butter &amp; Grape Jelly and Peanut Butter &amp; Strawberry Jelly.

== Nutrition ==
Skippy Peanut Butter is cholesterol-free and gluten-free. It contains sugar and hydrogenated vegetable oil (cottonseed, soybean and rapeseed oil) to prevent separation.

All varieties of Skippy Peanut Butter are also kosher except the Skippy P.B. bites.

<text>Halāyudha (Sanskrit: हलायुध) wrote the , a commentary on Pingala&#x27;s &quot;Chandaḥśāstra&quot;, was an Indian Mathematician and poet who lived and worked in the 10th century. The &quot;Chandaḥśāstra&quot; by the Indian lyricist Piṅgala (3rd or 2nd century BC) somewhat crypically describes a method of arranging two types of syllables to form metres of various lengths and counting them; as interpreted and elaborated by Halāyudha his &quot;method of pyramidal expansion&quot; (&quot;meru-prastāra&quot;) for counting metres is equivalent to Pascal&#x27;s triangle. 

== Biography ==

Halayudha originally resided at the Rashtrakuta capital Manyakheta, where he wrote under the patronage of emperor Krishna III. His &quot;Kavi-Rahasya&quot; eulogizes Krishna III. Later, he migrated to Ujjain in the Paramara kingdom. There, he composed &quot;Mṛta-Sañjīvanī&quot; in honour of the Paramara king Munja.

<text>Neumayer is a lunar impact crater that lies near the southern limb of the Moon. At this location the crater appears much foreshortened and can only be observed during favorable librations. It is attached to the southeastern rim of the slightly larger crater Helmholtz. To the south-southwest is the crater Demonax, and east-southeast is Hale.

This is a worn crater formation with features that have been softened and rounded by a history of minor impacts. But the rim remains intact and has not been significantly reshaped or indented by notable craters. The only crater of note within the rim is a small craterlet on the floor near the northern rim. There are much smaller craters scattered across the nearly flat and level floor, but no significant ridges or a central peak. In short, this crater appears as just an old depression in the surface.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Neumayer.

<text>Remedy Corporation was a software company that produced the Action Request System and various applications therein. It is one of the biggest and oldest names in ITSM software. Remedy is now the Service Management Business Unit of BMC Software.

==History==
Remedy Corporation was founded in 1990 by Doug Mueller, Dave Mahler, and Larry Garlick, who was the CEO until 2001. The company went public in 1995 and in 1996 was named by &quot;Business Week&quot; as the &quot;Number 1 Top Hot Growth Company in America.&quot;

In 2001, competitor Peregrine Systems, purchased the company for $1.2 billion in cash and stock. On September 22, 2002, Peregrine and its wholly owned subsidiary, Peregrine Remedy, Inc., filed for voluntary protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Two months after accounting irregularities forced Peregrine Systems into bankruptcy, it sold the Remedy business unit to BMC Software. Remedy was then known as &quot;Remedy, a BMC Software Company&quot; until 2004, when it became known as the &quot;Service Management Business Unit&quot;.

<doc id="1159314" wikidata="Q2248719" url="?curid=1159314" title="Schomberger (crater)">
<text>Schomberger is a prominent lunar impact crater that lies in the southern part of the Moon, in the area near the limb. It is located to the southwest of the crater Boguslawsky, and southeast of Simpelius. The relatively young satellite crater Schomberger A is nearly attached to the southern rim, and the much-aged Schomberger C lies just off the western rim.

This is a relatively well-defined crater with sharp features that have not been significantly worn down by minor impacts. The rim is roughly circular and sharp-edged, with a complex inner wall marked by slumping and many ridges and terraces. The inner floor is relatively flat and level, although somewhat rougher in the western half. At the midpoint of the interior is a central peak complex formed by several ridges.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Schomberger.
Due to its ray system, Schomberger A is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

<doc id="1159318" wikidata="Q7669220" url="?curid=1159318" title="TAESA Flight 725">
<text>TAESA Flight 725 was a scheduled flight originating in Tijuana International Airport and ending at Mexico City International Airport with intermediate stopovers in Guadalajara and Uruapan, that crashed shortly after departure from the latter city&#x27;s airport on November 9, 1999, killing all 18 passengers and crew on board. The crash led TAESA to ground its fleet and suspend operations a year later in 2000.

Investigators determined that the crew did not use the appropriate checklists prior to departure, and during the climbout, the pilots were confused about which heading to follow. Spatial disorientation was also believed to be a factor in the crash.

== Aircraft ==
The aircraft operating the flight was an McDonnell-Douglas DC-9-31, manufactured by McDonnell-Douglas, and first entered service with Trans Australia Airlines in February 1970. It was 29 years old at the time of the accident and accumulated more than 59,000 takeoff/landing cycles and 58,000 flight hours. Before being delivered to TAESA Lineas Aéreas, it previously operated for Australian Airlines, Sunworld International Airlines, Midway Airlines, NASA and Aeroméxico.

== Passengers and crew ==
The captain was 36-year-old Jesús José Gracián. He had 5,368 flight hours. The first officer was 22-year-old Héctor Valdez, who had 250 flight hours at the time of the accident. 

There were 18 people on board the DC-9 at the time it crashed, with 13 passengers and 5 crew members.

== Flight ==
The aircraft departed Uruapan for Mexico City at 18:59 local time. After rotation, the aircraft pitched up abnormally high, entered a stall, nosed over and crashed into an avocado field south of the runway on a heading of 110 degrees. All 18 people on board were killed.
