<text>The Stoner 63 is a 5.56×45mm NATO modular weapon system. Using a variety of modular components, it can be configured as an assault rifle, carbine, top-fed light machine gun, belt-fed squad automatic weapon, or as a vehicle mounted weapon. Also known as the M63, XM22&quot;, &quot;XM23, XM207 or the Mk 23 Mod 0 machine gun, it was designed by Eugene Stoner in the early 1960s. Cadillac Gage was the primary manufacturer of the Stoner 63 during its history. The Stoner 63 saw very limited combat use by US military units during the Vietnam War. A few were also sold to law enforcement agencies.

==History==
===Development===
Soon after leaving ArmaLite, Eugene Stoner, one of the United States&#x27; most prolific modern military small arms designers, responsible for the design of the ArmaLite AR-15/M16 assault rifles, ArmaLite AR-10 battle rifle and Armalite AR-7 survival rifle, among others, devised a concept for a modular weapon that would be built around a common receiver and certain interchangeable components and could be transformed into a rifle, carbine or various machine gun configurations by simply fitting the appropriate parts to the basic assembly.

Stoner managed to solicit the help of Howard Carson, in charge of Cadillac Gage&#x27;s West Coast plant in Costa Mesa, California (where Armalite was also located), in convincing the company&#x27;s president, Russell Baker, of the feasibility and commercial potential of his new weapons system. Russell obliged and Cadillac Gage (a subsidiary of the Ex-Cell-O Corporation) established a small arms development branch in Costa Mesa. Stoner then recruited his two principal aides at Armalite: Robert Fremont and James L. Sullivan (who would later design the Ultimax 100 light machine gun for the Chartered Industries of Singapore).

The first working prototype was chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO and completed in 1962. It was designated the Stoner M69W (for no other reason than when turned upside down it reads the same, symbolizing Stoner&#x27;s vision of a fully invertible receiver). The follow-up design, called the Stoner 62, also chambered in 7.62×51mm, was intended for mass production. However, the design team decided to focus on the 5.56×45mm small caliber high-velocity cartridge, as it appeared the new round was gaining mainstream military approval. Eugene Stoner had previously worked with the cartridge when he designed the AR-15. The weapon system using the smaller cartridge was known as the Stoner 63. The first models were produced in February 1963. The Costa Mesa facility produced 234 Stoner 63s, when production was then moved in September 1964 to the Cadillac Gage plant in Warren, Michigan. With the change in manufacturing plants, polycarbonate plastic was used for the stocks and grips instead of wood. The weapon is covered under .

===Trials===
On March 4, 1963, the Department of Defense&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency made the first purchase of the Stoner 63, ordering 25 units in various configurations. In August and September 1963, the Stoner 63 was sent to the Marines Corps Landing Force Development Center at Quantico for evaluation, where it made a positive impression with its light weight and high ammunition capacity; the Marines favored the rifle and light machine gun configurations. Trials were performed by the Army Materiel Command (responsible for logistical support for the Marine Corps) at their own test facilities.

Many bugs affected the outcome of the Army trials of the gun: the ammunition requirements proposed were unrealistic and the weapon was expected to perform with an extremely wide range of port pressures, leaving very little power reserve with some ammunition types. For instance, the tracer ammunition used in the Stoner 63 was of such low pressure that it even failed to function reliably in the M16.

These factors severely affected the weapon&#x27;s reliability. After several months of testing, the Stoner 63 system was ultimately deemed to be unacceptable for service use. The Army submitted recommendations for improvements to the design—these included a stainless steel gas cylinder, a two-position fire selector with separate safety, ejection port dust covers and modifications to the belt feed mechanism. The upgrades resulted in the improved Stoner 63A, which began production in 1966. Only about 2,000 examples of the initial version were manufactured before the transition to the model 63A.

XM207 upgrades

From 1969 to 1971 Cadillac Gage Co initiated a program to upgrade the Stoner 63 light machine gun due to Marine Corps interest. They were given one last chance to make design improvements and have a final test by the Army Materiel Command. Several changes were made to the weapon, soon to be designated &quot;XM207 Light Machine Gun&quot;. Misfires, high cyclic rates, jams and link separations were among the issues to be resolved.

The 63A used a stack of Belleville spring washers to absorb some of the shock and bounce when the firing pin struck the primer. By changing the configuration of the washers, a higher spring rate was achieved, and this was the solution for the bulk of the misfires.

The weapon, when cold, would fire at about 650 rounds per minute (rpm). When it was very hot, after several hundred rounds had been fired, the cyclic rate climbed as high as 1,100 rpm. The mechanical functions of the weapon just would not work properly at these high rates. There were several problems that occurred at high RPM, including link separation. A &quot;rate regulator&quot; similar to that used in M60 machine gun was installed in the buttstock. It was basically a shock absorber (designed by Cadillac Gage Co) that eliminated the recoil bounce off the back plate. This allowed the main drive spring to control the forward velocity of the carrier. With the &quot;rate regulator&quot; installed the cyclic rate of the weapon was limited to about 800 rpm. This resolved the mechanical malfunctions that occurred above 1,000 rpm. In combination with the &quot;rate regulator&quot; changes were made to the belt feed system for better reliability.

Another issue was low gas pressure when firing tracer rounds, causing failures to cycle. The addition of an expandable steel sealing ring in the gas chamber kept the external gas leaks to a minimum, retaining enough gas pressure to cycle the action reliably. The next issue was the polycarbonate buttstock being unable to withstand the 5,000+ pound recoil force of firing anti-tank grenades. With the weapon&#x27;s tight weight restriction, using a heavier metal buttstock was not an option. Several ribbed designs were evaluated, but none were successful. The solution was to pressure-fill the hollow buttstock with a lightweight urethane foam, imparting structural rigidity and high impact strength. This solved the problem without going over the weight limit, and made the buttstock extremely durable.

Several weapons with these improvements were produced by Cadillac Gage for testing by the Army Materiel Command. This would be the last chance for the weapon, now designated XM207. With its latest design changes, the weapon passed all tests. But soon afterwards, president Nixon announced that the United States would be withdrawing from Vietnam, eliminating the urgency to adopt a new infantry weapon. The XM207 project was cancelled.

===Deployment===
Even very early on in its development stage, a small number of weapons were hurriedly pressed into service with the U.S. Navy SEALs deployed to Southeast Asia. During 1967, the Stoner 63A system was field tested by Company L (Lima Company), 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. Riflemen were issued the weapon in the Rifle configuration (in both 63 and 63A variants, designated XM22 and XM22E1 respectively), while officers and certain other personnel received the Carbine (XM23). The Automatic Rifle configuration was deployed on a limited basis in the squad automatic role, while Lima&#x27;s weapons platoon received both the LMG and MMG configurations.

In 1967, Dutch firm NWM (Nederlandsche Wapen-en Munitiefabriek) De Kruithoorn N.V. of &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch acquired licensing rights to manufacture and sell the weapon worldwide with the exception of the United States, Canada and Mexico. NWM assembled several prototypes but the company failed to secure any export customers and the weapon was withdrawn.

The Stoner 63 was also considered for the Swiss armed forces as the W+F Stgw 71 chambered in 5.6x48mm Eiger.

In 1970, the U.S. Army designated the light machine gun configuration XM207 and issued it to select Army Special Forces units for evaluation. However, due to its complexity and high maintenance requirements (especially when compared to the new M16), the design was rejected, and the project was dropped in 1971. That same year, Cadillac Gage ceased all production of the Stoner 63. Around 4,000 63 and 63A units were built in total. The Navy SEALs continued to use the Stoner 63 and had officially adopted the Commando version as the Mark 23 Mod 0 machine gun. By the late 1980s the Stoner 63 was completely phased out in favor of the new M249 SAW, and most of the remaining guns were destroyed.

==Design details==
===Operating mechanism===
The Stoner 63 series of weapons are piston driven, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, fire from the open bolt position to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary bolt locking mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical locking lugs that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of locking lugs distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which is equipped with a curved cam track that guides the bolt&#x27;s cam pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a carbide rod that rides within the piston extension&#x27;s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).

When fired, propellant gases from the ignited cartridge following the projectile down the bore are vented through a gas port into a gas cylinder where they drive the piston and bolt carrier rearward. There is about of uninterrupted free travel calculated to permit the gas build-up in the bore to drop to a safe level before the carrier&#x27;s cam slot rotates the bolt counter-clockwise to unlock. The locking lugs have no pitch therefore no primary extraction occurs during the unlocking sequence. A deeply seated spring-loaded claw extractor in the bolt head extracts the spent cartridge casing from the chamber and a spring-powered ejector fixed to the front feed mechanism trigger housing ejects the casing. The bolt carrier continues to the rear and compresses the captive recoil spring on its guide rod.

The Stoner 63 has a unique buffering system contained within the bolt carrier. In front of the carrier cap are a steel shim and a set of 27 saucer-shaped Belleville washers oriented in opposing sets of three, which absorb energy from the piston stroke by deforming into a flat plate when the bolt carrier strikes the receiver&#x27;s end cap. When the plates return to their original shape they release a pulse of strain energy which propels the reciprocating parts forward in counter-recoil with a speed only slightly below that of the original recoil velocity. The plates will function without failure for between 40,000 and 50,000 rounds (depending upon the type of ammunition used and cyclic rates employed). This feature was designed to extend the weapon&#x27;s service life.

===Feeding===
In the belt-fed configuration, belt movement is produced by a roller riding in the channeled feed arm and is actuated by the reciprocating movement of the bolt. The spring-loaded feed arm is protected by a hinged top cover and is pivoted at its rear end. As the bolt travels back, the front end of the feed arm moves across the feed tray and operates a lever attached to a single set of spring-loaded pawls. These pawls move a cartridge and link over the feed tray&#x27;s stop pawl from where they are positioned onto the slotted feed path and held firmly in place by a spring-powered steel plate in the top cover. The cartridge is then pushed out of its link and the empty link is discarded through the link ejection port which is held closed by a spring-loaded dust cover.

The Stoner 63/63A is chambered for the now-standard 5.56×45mm intermediate rifle cartridge. When in the belt-fed role, the weapon would feed from a disintegrating metallic linked belt marked &quot;S-63 BRW&quot; which is a scaled-down version of the U.S. M13 link developed for the M60 GPMG. The Stoner 63/63A will not work reliably with the later M27 link developed for the M249 SAW. The belt is normally contained in a 150-round plastic ribbed container that has a tab allowing it to be clipped on to the side of the left-hand feed tray. Early ammunition boxes were olive drab in color and manufactured at Costa Mesa, this later changed to a black-colored plastic container made in Warren, Michigan. Stoner 63A boxes were also black but had a reduced capacity of 100 rounds as the larger container would unbalance the rifle. These can either be attached to the left-hand feed tray or held in a bottom box carrier when using the right-hand feed mechanism. Several drum-type belt carriers were designed for the left-hand feed system, with a 150-round drum container being the most popular and used frequently by SEALS in Vietnam. A 250-round drum carrier was also developed by NAWS China Lake, but this proved too heavy and cumbersome. SEALS would also resort to converting RPD belt carriers for use with their Stoners. The detachable magazines used in the Rifle, Carbine and Automatic Rifle models are fabricated from steel and weigh unloaded. In an effort to reduce weight, aluminum magazines were later developed cutting the weight down to . Standard magazines have a 30-round cartridge capacity but a 20-round magazine was also offered.

===Barrel===
Barrel interchangeability is one of the main features that provides the Stoner 63 rifle its outstanding versatility. There are 5 barrel options available for the system: the Rifle, Carbine, Automatic Rifle (AR) and two types of machine gun barrels, a standard heavy barrel and a short Commando tube. The standard machine gun and AR barrels are in length (not including the flash suppressor). The Commando barrel has a length of and is fluted to reduce weight and enhance the barrel&#x27;s cooling characteristics. This version was sometimes used by the Navy SEALS but was never fully reliable as the gas port is near the muzzle and as soon as the bullet leaves the barrel, gas pressures drop drastically leaving the operating system little to no power reserve. The gas port was drilled larger in an attempt to alleviate this problem; however this had the effect of merely accelerating the piston&#x27;s initial displacement. The issue was never truly resolved. The Rifle, Carbine and AR barrels have no gas valves as they are exclusively used in magazine-fed configurations and do not require the energy surplus levels of belt-fed mechanisms. The standard machine gun barrel has a manually adjustable gas regulator that can be operated by inserting the nose of a cartridge into a hole over the regulator&#x27;s lock detent, pushing down on the detent and rotating to the desired position. The gas regulator has three settings: a &quot;slow&quot; cyclic rate of about 700 rounds/min, produced when the narrowest indicator notch is set over the detent; a middle position with an intermediate rate of 830 rounds/min and a third &quot;fouled&quot; position that delivers the largest quantity of propellant gas to the system, resulting in a rate of fire of 865 rounds/min (the use of this setting should be limited as it induces excessive wear on the operating mechanism).

All Stoner 63/63A barrels are gas nitrided and have a quick-detach capability and can be removed in a matter of seconds in field conditions by simply pushing down a latch located on top of the weapon in front of the feed cover and pulling the barrel forward (with the bolt retracted). The chamber portion of the barrel rests on a U-shaped barrel bracket attached to the gas cylinder. The barrel is firmly locked in position by means of a spring-loaded latch (with two nested coil springs) which drives a steel pin into a hole in the barrel socket. All barrels have a gas block to which a bayonet lug and front sight assembly are mounted. The barrels are equipped with a bird cage type flash suppressor with six oval ports. The AR and standard machine gun barrels also have a carrying handle that can be snapped into one of three positions or removed altogether. The black-painted wooden handles are attached to a steel rod via roll pin. With a few exceptions, all the barrels used in the Stoner 63/63A have a six-groove right-hand rifling with a twist rate of 1:12-inch (305 mm), designed to stabilize the lightweight 55-grain M193 projectile, which was standard at the time. At the Army&#x27;s request, Cadillac Gage submitted for testing rifles, carbines, and light machine guns, with 1:9-inch (230 mm) twist barrels, respectively designated XM22E2, XM23E2, and XM207E2. The different twist was to test the 68-grain XM287 and XM288 bullets. After NWM obtained a license to produce the Stoner 63A, some barrels were manufactured with a 1:8-inch (200 mm) in rifling pitch to be used with heavier experimental bullets. None of these were ever produced in significant numbers.

===Fire control===
The Stoner 63/63A LMG is an automatic weapon that fires from the open bolt and the trigger mechanism permits only fully automatic firing. The entire trigger unit has four trigger pins that give the unit its modularity. The front pin holds a flapper-type magazine catch/release (used in the Rifle/Carbine variants and the left-hand feed LMG with a 150-round drum-type belt container), a full dust cover (used with the top-feeding Automatic Rifle or vertically mounted ammo box on any belt-fed system) or a half size dust cover (used with the right-hand-feed bottom box carrier). The next two pins retain the timer and hammer, both of which are absent in the open bolt configurations. The final pin acts as the trigger&#x27;s axis shaft; the spring-loaded sear pivots on the selector lever&#x27;s axis pin. The selector is disconnected when firing from the open bolt and a sliding manual safety installed near the trigger guard disables the trigger when pushed to the rear. The rear portion of the trigger housing serves as a receiver end cap and is used to attach the shoulder stock. The black polycarbonate pistol grip is also attached to the trigger housing. The checkered grip is flared at the bottom to prevent the shooter&#x27;s hand from sliding off and has an internal storage compartment sealed by a hinged cover with a spring-loaded hatch.

===Features===
The hooked, non-reciprocating steel charging handle is typically mounted on the right side of the receiver. It has 24 lightening holes and engages a projection on the piston to draw the piston and bolt group to the rear (cocked) position. The handle should then be pushed back forward allowing a flat-spring latch riveted to the front end to capture a slotted plate welded to the front of the receiver. With the right-hand feed mechanism with underslung box carrier installed the handle is awkward to operate, so a special slotted forearm with a bottom cocking handle was developed.

The nucleus of the Stoner 63 system is the receiver which is a rectangular sheet metal pressing. The gas cylinder, support structures, brackets, lugs and other devices are welded in place. The front portion carries the piston and barrel and is perforated to reduce weight and improve air circulation around the barrel and gas cylinder. The rear segment holds the piston extension and bolt group. The ejection port is on the right side when the receiver is inverted and the weapon is configured as a rifle or carbine and on the left side when in the various machine gun roles. The various components are phosphate finished and then coated with a black baked enamel finish called Endurion. Early examples of the Stoner 63 were delivered with all wood furniture, however these were soon replaced with black polycarbonate parts with the exception of the handguard, which remained wood, but was painted black.

The Stoner 63 bipod is a non-locking type that attaches to the gas tube; it does not pivot and has a limited height adjustment feature. The Stoner 63A bipod is extensively perforated with lightening holes and can be locked in either the stowed or deployed positions. It too does not pivot but is compatible with the earlier Stoner 63, whereas the Stoner 63 bipod will not work with the later 63A pattern guns as the gas tube is of a larger diameter.

===Sights===
The sight arrangement on the Stoner 63/63A differs amongst the various configurations. On the belt-fed LMGs, the rear sights are mounted on the top cover. These consist of a folding leaf aperture elevation scale graduated in 100 m increments from 200 to 1,000 m. The rear sight can also be corrected for windage in ¼-mil increments. When the primary sight is folded down, a battle sight aperture with a diameter of is exposed. The Rifle and Carbine versions have simple flip-type apertures with settings for 0–300 and 300–500 m contained between large perforated protective ears. The sights are adjustable in both windage and elevation in 1 MOA increments. All variants share the same front sight assembly—a semi-shrouded round threaded post adjustable for windage and elevation zero (similar to the M16 front sight).

===Accessories===
The Stoner 63/63A is supplied with several accessories, including: a blank-firing attachment (BFA), winter trigger guard, asbestos-lined spare barrel bag, cleaning kit, 40 mm grenade launcher, several types of slings and a wide range of belt box and magazine pouches.

The Stoner 63/63A used three different types of bayonets: the standard U.S. M7, the KCB 70, developed specifically for this rifle by the West German company Eickhorn-Solingen together with NWM and a rare bayonet made by the Swiss industrial conglomerate SIG. The KCB 70 features a long Bowie blade with a clip-point and an integrated wire-cutter, it was inspired by Soviet bayonets for the AKM. A highly successful multi-purpose tool, it evolved into the KCB 77, a modular design that was adapted to many different assault rifles.

==Variants==
The Stoner 63 was produced in several configurations, with 15 separate assemblies, which had limited parts commonality. These variants included a carbine, an assault rifle, and various light machine guns feeding linked ammunition from the left or right. The gas system was mounted in different positions depending on the weapon&#x27;s configuration. Due to the multi-role nature of the design the carbine and rifle versions were heavier than comparable weapons of the same type.

* Stoner 63/63A Rifle: A standard assault rifle fed from below by a 30-round box magazine. Spent cases are ejected to the right. The cocking handle and gas system are mounted above the barrel. Unlike the belt-fed configurations, the Rifle fires from closed bolt. The rifle configuration was field tested by the USMC for a short period during April to June 1964 by a recruit company at MCRD Parris Island, SC and elsewhere in 1967. It was eventually fitted with a lightweight bipod that folded beneath the handguard.
* Stoner 63/63A Carbine: The Carbine is similar to the Rifle configuration, but with a shorter barrel and a folding shoulder stock. The carbine configuration was field tested by the USMC for a short period during 1967.
* Stoner 63/63A Automatic Rifle: The Automatic Rifle is an open-bolt rifle fed from a top-mounted, 30-round magazine. The front and rear sights are offset to the left to compensate for the magazine&#x27;s position. The AR does not have a semi-automatic mode. The automatic rifle configuration was field tested by the USMC for a short period during 1967.
* Stoner 63/63A Light Machine Gun: The LMG configuration fires from an open bolt and is fed from the right-hand side by linked ammunition contained in a 75, 100, 150-round drum magazine. The receiver is identical to the Rifle variants, but is inverted, so that spent cases and links are ejected to the left. The LMG has a quick-change barrel and the gas cylinder is positioned below the barrel since the receiver is inverted. The LMG configuration was adopted for military use by Navy SEAL units operating in Southeast Asia.
* Stoner 63/63A Medium Machine Gun: Identical to the LMG configuration. The difference is that the MMG comes with a separate adapter that can be used to attach the weapon to an M2 or M122 tripod.
* Stoner 63/63A Fixed Machine Gun: Internally identical to the LMG configuration. Externally, the front sights, rear sights, foregrip and pistol grip are all removed. The trigger is activated remotely by a 24V solenoid. The FMG was designed for use with the Cadillac Gage Commando APC, but was never officially adopted.
* Stoner 63/63A Commando: The Commando is a derivative of the LMG configuration. It is fed from the right by a 100-round box magazine and has the charging handle located on the bottom of the handguard for easier access. To save weight, the Commando eschews the quick-change barrel found on the other belt-fed configurations. This variant was used by some United States Navy SEAL units in the Vietnam War.
* Stoner 63 Survival Rifle: The Survival Rifle was designed in 1964 to compete with the Colt Model 608 as an aircrew self-defense weapon. It is mechanically similar to the Rifle configuration, but has several external modifications made to fit into United States Air Force size constraints. These include a cut-down pistol grip, an absent handguard, shortened barrel and receiver, and a top-mounted cocking handle. The Survival Rifle does not incorporate the 63A upgrades. Only one prototype was ever produced—it survives to this day.
* Stoner 66 Civilian Rifle: A short-lived semi-automatic version for the civilian market. Never actually allowed to be sold.
* Stoner 93: A reworked Stoner 63 that was tested in the early 1990s by the Royal Thai Armed Forces using an ACOG scope.

The most recent descendant of this line is the Stoner LMG produced by Knight&#x27;s Armament Company, which has significant changes from the older Stoner 63, being based on Stoner&#x27;s later model 86.

Robinson Armament Co. also produced the semi-automatic M96 Expeditionary Weapon System which, though technically different, was based on the Stoner 63 design, and thus has some of its features and configurations.

===Dutch variants===
Although none were manufactured in the Netherlands, around 315 were modified and improved by NWM De Kruithoorn N.V. in various configurations for possible use in the Dutch Armed Forces as the Stoner 63A1 consisting of 6 variants One of the main modifications was an MP40 (later AK47) type underfolding and later side folding stock, a carbine, an assault rifle, heavy barrel assault rifle, belt fed machine gun, commando machine gun and fixed machine gun. The Stoner 63A1 was tested by the US Army and USMC as the XM22 assault rifle, XM23 carbine and XM207 machine gun. Various improvements was the Dutch pattern side folding stock, quick release bipod that folded under the handguard, an improved removable magazine floor plate, a quick release scope mount.

==Designations==
The rifle, carbine, commando, and LMG variants were all given designations by the US Military. They are as follows:

<text>Nathaniel Boyden (August 16, 1796 – November 20, 1873) was a U.S. Congressman from North Carolina between 1847 and 1849 and later between 1868 and 1869.

==Biography==
Born in Conway, Massachusetts in 1796, Boyden attended the common schools and then served in the War of 1812. He graduated from Union College in Schenectady, New York, in 1821 and moved to Stokes County, North Carolina in 1822.

After teaching school for several years in North Carolina, Boyden studied law and was admitted to the bar and practiced. In 1838 and 1840, he was elected to terms in the North Carolina House of Commons. In 1842, Boyden moved to Salisbury, North Carolina and continued to practice law. In 1844 he was elected to the North Carolina Senate, and in 1846, voted to a single term in the 30th United States Congress (March 4, 1847 – March 3, 1849) as a Whig.

Declining to stand for re-election in 1848, Boyden returned to the practice of law. After the American Civil War, he was a delegate to the 1865 North Carolina Constitutional Convention, and, upon the readmission to North Carolina to the union, he was elected as a Conservative (as some North Carolina members of the Democratic Party were calling themselves) to the 40th United States Congress and served from July 13, 1868 to March 3, 1869. Boyden was the sole non-Republican to vote in favor of the 15th Amendment, granting voting rights regardless of race.

He unsuccessfully contested the election of Francis Edwin Shober to the 41st United States Congress, and afterwards resumed the practice of law until elected associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court in 1872. He served in that post until his death in Salisbury, on November 20, 1873; he is buried in the Lutheran Cemetery in Salisbury.

He was married to Jane Caroline Henderson, daughter of Congressman and North Carolina politician Archibald Henderson (1768-1822).

<text>Frank Bernard Wearne VC (1 March 1894 – 28 June 1917) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Wearne was born to Frank and Ada (Morris) Wearne, the third of their five children. One of his brothers, Captain Keith Morris Wearne (1892–1917), was another casualty of World War I, falling in the Battle of Arras on 21 May 1917, aged 24. His only sister, Edith Ann (1889–1956), married Thomas Clinton Pears (1882–1912), a great great grandson of soap manufacturer Andrew Pears. Thomas and Edith were passengers on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. Edith survived while Thomas was lost.

Before joining the British Army he attended Bromsgrove School.
Wearne was 23 years old, and a second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion, Essex Regiment, British Army, attached to the 10th Battalion during the Great War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 June 1917 east of Loos, France, Second Lieutenant Wearne, commanding a small party in a raid on the enemy&#x27;s trenches, had gained his objective in the face of fierce opposition and managed to maintain his position against repeated counter-attacks. Then, realising that if the left flank was lost his men would have to give way, he leaped onto the parapet and followed by his left section, ran along the top of the trench firing and throwing bombs. While doing this he was severely wounded, but continued directing operations until he received two more wounds, the second mortal.

<text>Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU), also known as Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), is an algorithm in computer science that uses semidefinite programming to perform non-linear dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional vectorial input data.

It is motivated by the observation that kernel Principal Component Analysis (kPCA) does not reduce the data dimensionality, as it leverages the Kernel trick to non-linearly map the original data into an inner-product space.

== Algorithm ==
MVU creates a mapping from the high dimensional input vectors to some low dimensional Euclidean vector space in the following steps:

# A neighbourhood graph is created. Each input is connected with its k-nearest input vectors (according to Euclidean distance metric) and all k-nearest neighbors are connected with each other. If the data is sampled well enough, the resulting graph is a discrete approximation of the underlying manifold. 
# The neighbourhood graph is &quot;unfolded&quot; with the help of semidefinite programming. Instead of learning the output vectors directly, the semidefinite programming aims to find an inner product matrix that maximizes the pairwise distances between any two inputs that are not connected in the neighbourhood graph while preserving the nearest neighbors distances. 
# The low-dimensional embedding is finally obtained by application of multidimensional scaling on the learned inner product matrix.

The steps of applying semidefinite programming followed by a linear dimensionality reduction step to recover a low-dimensional embedding into a Euclidean space were first proposed by Linial, London, and Rabinovich.

==Optimization formulation==

Let formula_1 be the original input and formula_2 be the embedding. If formula_3 are two neighbors, then the local isometry constraint that needs to be satisfied is:

:formula_4

Let formula_5 be the Gram matrices of formula_6 and formula_7 (i.e.: formula_8). We can express the above constraint for every neighbor points formula_3 in term of formula_5:

:formula_11

In addition, we also want to constrain the embedding formula_7 to center at the origin:

formula_13

As described above, except the distances of neighbor points are preserved, the algorithm aims to maximize the pairwise distance of every pair of points. The objective function to be maximized is:

formula_14

Intuitively, maximizing the function above is equivalent to pulling the points as far away from each other as possible and therefore &quot;unfold&quot; the manifold. The local isometry constraint 

Let formula_15 where 
formula_16

prevents the objective function from diverging (going to infinity).

Since the graph has N points, the distance between any two points formula_17. We can then bound the objective function as follows:

:formula_18

The objective function can be rewritten purely in the form of the Gram matrix:

:formula_19

Finally, the optimization can be formulated as:

formula_20

After the Gram matrix formula_21 is learned by semidefinite programming, the output formula_22 can be obtained via Cholesky decomposition. 

In particular, the Gram matrix can be written as formula_23 where formula_24 is the i-th element of eigenvector formula_25 of the eigenvalue formula_26.

It follows that the formula_27-th element of the output formula_28 is formula_29.

<text>Lawrence Carthage Weathers, (14 May 1890 – 29 September 1918) was a New Zealand-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. His parents returned to their native South Australia when Weathers was seven, and he completed his schooling before obtaining work as an undertaker in Adelaide. He enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in early 1916, and joined the 43rd Battalion. His unit deployed to the Western Front in France and Belgium in late December. After a bout of illness, Weathers returned to his battalion in time to take part in the Battle of Messines in June 1917, during which he was wounded. Evacuated to the United Kingdom, he rejoined his unit in early December.

Promoted to lance corporal in March 1918, Weathers fought with his battalion during the German spring offensive, but was gassed in May and did not return to his unit until the following month. He participated in the Battle of Hamel in July, the Battle of Amiens in August, and the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin in September. At Mont Saint-Quentin he was recommended for the award of the Victoria Cross. Promoted to temporary corporal, he was mortally wounded in the head by a shell on 29 September during the Battle of St Quentin Canal, and died soon after, unaware that he was to receive the Victoria Cross, which was not announced until late December. Until 2016, his Victoria Cross was in private hands, but in that year it was purchased at auction and donated to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where it is displayed in the Hall of Valour.

== Early life ==
Lawrence Carthage Weathers was born in Te Kōpuru, near Dargaville, New Zealand, on 14 May 1890, one of eight children of John Joseph Weathers, a pastoralist, and his wife Ellen Frances Johanna McCormack. Both his parents were from Adelaide, South Australia, and the family returned there when he was seven years old. They settled in the rural mid-north of the state and Weathers attended Snowtown Public School. After leaving school, in 1909 he and two of his brothers travelled to Europe and America, including a four-month stay in England. Having spent two years away, he returned to Australia and worked as a horse handler, coachman, and as an undertaker in Adelaide. On 10 September 1913, he married Annie Elizabeth &quot;Tess&quot; Watson of Unley. The couple lived in the suburbs of Yatala and Parkside, and had two children. Weathers&#x27; elder brother Thomas enlisted to serve in World War I and died of wounds during the Gallipoli Campaign of 1915, while serving with the 9th Light Horse Regiment. His younger brother Joseph also enlisted, but was discharged at his own request before leaving Australia.

== World War I ==

On 8 February 1916, Weathers enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and was initially allocated as a reinforcement to the 10th Battalion. In June, he was transferred to the 43rd Battalion, part of the 11th Brigade, 3rd Division. The 43rd Battalion embarked on HMAT A19 (formerly SS &quot;Afric&quot;) in June 1916, and after a brief stop in the Middle East and transit through France, spent the rest of the year training at Larkhill on the Salisbury Plain in southern England. The 3rd Division embarked for the Western Front in November, and entered the trenches for the first time in late December. Weathers reported sick in late January 1917, and did not rejoin his unit until late April. He returned to the front lines in time to participate in the first major action his battalion saw in the war, the Battle of Messines, during which the 43rd Battalion incurred 122 casualties in a night-time operation to capture the final objective, the Oosttaverne Line. One of those casualties was Weathers, who suffered a gunshot wound to the leg on 10 June. Evacuated to hospital in the United Kingdom, he did not return to his unit until early December. The 3rd Division spent the winter of 1917–1918 rotating through the front lines in the Messines sector of the Flanders region of Belgium, largely improving the trenches against an expected German offensive in the spring.

Weathers was promoted to lance corporal on 21 March 1918, and a week later his battalion helped blunt the German spring offensive, taking up defensive positions between the Ancre and the Somme rivers west of Morlancourt. In late May he required medical treatment following a gas attack near Villers-Bretonneux that caused 230 casualties among the 43rd, and Weathers did not return to duty until mid-June.

The 43rd Battalion&#x27;s next major action was the highly successful Battle of Hamel on 4 July. The battalion was responsible for clearing the village itself and suffered 97 casualties. The 43rd played a supporting role in the first phase of the Battle of Amiens on 8 August, which marked the beginning of the Hundred Days Offensive to drive the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line of fortifications. This included fighting west of Suzanne on 25–26 August. On 2 September, during the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, the 43rd Battalion was tasked with clearing trenches north of the village of Allaines. It captured Graz Trench opposite Allaines without a fight, then using hand grenades (known as bombs), fought northwards towards Scutari Trench, and succeeded in containing about 150 Germans at a fork in the trench. Faced with a deluge of German fire, the troops halted and a deadlock ensued, which was broken by Weathers, supported by three other men. His actions on that day resulted in a recommendation for the award of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at the time. The citation read:

When Weathers returned to his comrades, his uniform was covered in mud, he had blood running down his face, and he had five days&#x27; stubble on his chin. He was also festooned &quot;like a Christmas tree&quot; with looted German binoculars and pistols. Full of nervous tension, he chattered to his mates about how he had &quot;put the wind up&quot; the Germans. During the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, the 43rd Battalion suffered 67 casualties. Over the next week, the 11th Brigade was part of the pursuit of the Germans to the main Hindenburg Line. Weathers was promoted to temporary corporal on 10 September. On 29 September, the 3rd Division was part of the Battle of St Quentin Canal, one of the last Australian ground actions of the war, which involved breaching the Beaurevoir Line, the third line of defences of the Hindenburg Line. During the battle, the 43rd Battalion was sheltering in a trench when a shell burst among a small group of men, wounding Weathers in the head. He died soon after, not knowing he would receive the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 24 December 1918. The same shell killed his uncle, Lance Corporal J. J. Weathers.

Weathers was buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Unicorn Cemetery, Vendhuile. Until 2016, his Victoria Cross was in private hands, but in that year it was put up for auction in Sydney, fetching a world record price for an individual medal. Late that year it was donated to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, where it is now displayed in the Hall of Valour.

<doc id="1187412" wikidata="Q12060356" url="?curid=1187412" title="Hogsmill River">
<text>The Hogsmill River in Surrey and Greater London, England, is a small chalk stream tributary of the River Thames. It rises in Ewell and flows into the Thames at Kingston upon Thames on the lowest non-tidal reach, that above Teddington Lock. 

The river is long and has a catchment area of about . Nearby land was formerly flood-meadows; following improvements it is now mostly sports grounds, a sewage treatment works and green space, save for Kingston and Epsom town centres. It is a habitat of many animals, fish and insects.

The 12th-century Clattern Bridge, one of the oldest road bridges in England, crosses the river in the southwest of Kingston town centre. The Coronation Stone, now sited close to the river in Kingston, is believed to have been used for the coronation of Saxon kings in the 10th century. It was used as a horse mounting block until 1850 when it was mounted on a plinth in the town centre.

The river has five tributaries: Green Lanes Stream, Ewell Court Stream, Horton Stream, Bonesgate Stream and Tolworth Brook.

==Course of the river==

=== Epsom and Ewell ===
The source of the Hogsmill River is a chalk spring just outside Bourne Hall Park in Ewell, Surrey. It flows in a northerly direction between Kingston Road and the sports field beside the railway track. The Hogsmill passes the sites of the Lower and Upper Mills, and Ewell Court Mills, where gunpowder was produced in the 18th and 19th centuries, and gently bends to the left before flowing under the Mole Valley railway line between and at the start of the Hogsmill Open Space which follows the river until the borough boundary with Kingston.

The river continues its course in green space between the residential areas of Ewell Court and West Ewell and is joined by the Green Lanes Stream. After a short distance of green space, the river runs as a boundary between Poole Road Recreation Ground and Ewell Court Park and flows behind Ewell Athletics Track. It reaches another confluence, this one being with the Ewell Court Stream, flowing in just downstream from Ewell Court Lake as it continues into West Ewell.

The Hogsmill runs further through the open space and passes near West Ewell Infants School and Ruxley Church before flowing under Ruxley Farm Bridge, the site of the former Ruxley Splash. It passes Riverview Primary School in the residential area of Ruxley Ward before the confluence with the Bonesgate Stream, which here marks the boundary between the boroughs of Epsom and Ewell in Surrey and Kingston in Greater London. After the confluence, the Hogsmill bends to the right near Riverview Road and continues as the boundary past Tolworth Court Bridge with the A240 (Kingston Road) to the junction with the B284 (Worcester Park Road).

=== Kingston ===
The river flows beside Worcester Park Road and Old Malden Lane (both the B284) along the edge of a few sports grounds and under the entrance to the Surbiton Raceway go-karting track. The river leaves the boundary as it turns left into the outskirts of Old Malden in an area of woodland and green space. It crosses the Chessington branch railway line a short distance away from Malden Manor railway station. The Hogsmill is now flowing in a NNW direction as it crosses the A3 between Tolworth and Malden junctions.

The river delimits New Malden (historically the bulk of &quot;Malden&quot;) and Berrylands (historically part of Kingston), beside sport and recreation grounds near Elmbridge Avenue, where it is joined by Tolworth Brook, after which it passes under the South Western main railway line near Berrylands railway station. The Hogsmill leaves the green space area at the railway line and passes Kingsmeadow, Kingston Cemetery and sewage works in the eastern outskirts of Kingston upon Thames, which covers not only that borough but also Epsom and Ewell which had a large sewage farm against the river in the decades around 1900.

It crosses under Villiers Road before heading alongside the Kingston School of Art campus of Kingston University and through the Middle Mill Hall of Residence site. It then crosses Springfield Road beside Denmark Road and Grange Road. It also runs under the bridge for the A307 (Wheatfield Way) near College Roundabout beside Kingston College. The river then runs under St. James&#x27;s Road by the Magistrates Court and the Guildhall before flowing under Kingston High Street and Wadbrook Street. The Hogsmill River meets the Thames beside a restaurant and street and promenade of shops beside the Thames Path footbridge at , just upstream of Kingston Bridge.

== Tributaries ==

=== Green Lanes Stream ===
The Green Lanes Stream is 2.1 miles (3.4 km) long and starts as a run-off from Stamford Green Pond on the eastern edge of Epsom Common. Other smaller streams from the common join the main stream a few metres from the pond as it goes underground. It runs near Manor Green Road and is above the ground in places, for example by the bridges under Christ Church Mount (a crescent road off Manor Green Road). Shortly afterwards, it flows underground again and this is where it runs under Epsom Primary School on Hook Road at the junction with Longmead Road. This is where the stream comes above the ground.

It runs parallel with Longmead Road where it runs near to Longmead Industrial Estate and Blenheim High School until the road meets the B2200 (Chessington Road) and the stream runs under it. This is where it flows between the two roads named Green Lanes (the river is named after the roads). It runs into the Hogsmill Open Space before meeting the confluence with Hogsmill Stream.

=== Ewell Court Stream ===
Ewell Court Stream is 1.7 miles (2.7 km) long and starts near a pond on the edge of Nonsuch Park by the A24 (London Road) in Stoneleigh. After running under the A24, it continues under Briarwood Road. It is visible again briefly in an alley near Stoneleigh railway station. The stream bends left under Stoneleigh Park Road and runs under Walsingham Gardens and the A240 (Kingston Road) where it enters Ewell Court. After running after Preston Drive, it enters Ewell Court Park and comes above ground before running through Ewell Court Lake.

As it continues through the park towards the meeting point with the Hogsmill it passes the Packhorse Bridge, which was named after the mules that regularly transported gunpowder from the mills, across the river and into a brick magazine. At its height in the mid-19th century, the gunpowder mill complex by the bridge employed 156 men. Gunpowder from Ewell is said to have been used in the American Civil War.

=== Bonesgate Stream ===

The Bonesgate Stream is the principal stream of the Hogsmill River. It is 3 miles (5 km) in length and rises in Malden Rushett near the crossroads of the A243 and B280. It flows in a NE direction through farmlands before flowing just east of Chessington. After crossing under Filby Road, it heads past the Bonesgate pub, now called the William Bourne, in Moor Lane on the eastern edge of Chessington. The bridge over the stream is where Moor Lane and Chessington Road meet. The river then heads through open space, flowing under a bridge near Cox Lane Community Centre. The river goes past the edge of the Cox Lane Estate shortly before joining the Hogsmill by Tolworth Court Bridge under the A240 Kingston Road. From the William Bourne pub to Tolworth Court Bridge, the river serves as a boundary between West Ewell (Surrey) and Chessington (Greater London).

=== Horton Stream ===
The source of Horton Stream is in the centre of Horton Country Park, Epsom. It is 3.3 miles (5.3 km) long and its source is near West Park Hospital beside Horton Lane, Epsom. The stream carries on parallel with Horton Lane as it passes near to West Park Farm and Horton Park Farm. After travelling through Horton Country Park, it heads through Horton Golf Course before crossing Chessington Road, West Ewell. It runs alongside Chessington Close before running through the playing fields of Epsom and Ewell High School. It continues behind Scotts Farm Road before the confluence with the Hogsmill near Ruxley Lane after running under Scotts Farm Road.

=== Tolworth Brook ===
At , Tolworth Brook (or Surbiton Stream) is the longest tributary. Its source is on the edge of Claygate from springs at Grapesome Wood on the west side of the A3, 

It flows under the A3 to skirt Lovelace Primary School, north under Clayton Road between the withy bed and Oaklands Close, then through rugby playing fields and crosses the A309 Esher bypass going north between allotments and Kelvin Grove. It then passes west of Gladstone and Brook Roads through playing fields, then is culverted from the rear of 1 Herne Road. Its culvert is then visible east of Hook Road at Vale Road North, and after, under Waterside Close and Thornhill Road, to turn east under Cotterill Road. It is the open limit of gardens between Cotterill and Ellerton Roads, until Ditton Road (where culverted). The brook reappears north of pub/restaurant &quot;The Oak&quot; on Ewell Road. It follows the rear of Beaconsfield Road and then goes under King Charles Road to reappear in Alexandra Recreation Ground, and then flows north-east bisecting Edith Gardens Nature Reserve; east under Raeburn Avenue; north under Meldone Close. It is the central, northward, feature of Berrylands Nature Reserve; under Stirling Walk, it falls east under Elmbridge Avenue to meet the Hogsmill.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. 
Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

Water quality of the Hogsmill in 2019:
== Flooding ==
In January 2014, the Hogsmill burst its banks on the edge of Bourne Hall in Ewell Village, causing several local roads to flood.

==In popular culture==
===Literature===
Richard Jefferies (1848–1887), best known for his nature-writing, wrote about the Hogsmill brook during his years living at Tolworth in two essays, &quot;A Brook&quot; and &quot;A London Trout&quot;, that were collected in his book, &quot;Nature Near London&quot;, published by Chatto and Windus in 1883.

===Art===
The Hogsmill has appeared in the art of the Pre-Raphaelite painters, John Millais in his rendition of &quot;Ophelia&quot;, and William Holman Hunt who painted &quot;The Hireling Shepherd&quot; on the meadows by the Hogsmill, looking north towards Ewell Court Farm. The doorway (to the soul) in Hunt&#x27;s &quot;The Light of the World&quot; is believed to be part of a gunpowder mill on the Hogsmill at Ewell.

===Local legend===
William the Conqueror is said to have &quot;watered his horse&quot; in the source waters near today&#x27;s Spring Hotel. Traditionally, this was at the pool in Bourne Hall Park.

==Industry==
Part of the course was engineered to be harnessed for watermills near Ewell Court. These joined those of nearby Whitton in the production of gunpowder; which continued for some time after the Napoleonic Wars to help supply the American Civil War. The mills closed in 1875 as they couldn&#x27;t meet new safety legislation. Dynamos were later installed in one of the old mill buildings to generate electricity for Ewell Court House.

There were also two flour mills in Ewell, the Upper and Lower mills, both also used for paper making at one time. The latter was supposed to have provided the flour for Queen Victoria&#x27;s bakers. The Upper Mill was the last working corn mill on the river, still working in 1951 when visited by Jack Hillier. It is now the headquarters of the Samaritans.

Another group of gunpowder mills were established at Worcester Park by William Taylor in 1720. They were variously known as the Malden Mills, Long Ditton Mills or Tolworth Mills, being located on the meeting of the three parishes. The works finally closed in the 1860s.

Kingston had three mills; Chapel Mill, or the Old Mill; Middle Mill and the eponymous Hogg&#x27;s Mill or New Mill. All three were corn mills originally. In later years Middle Mill was used for processing coconut fibres. Chapel Mill was used to crush the coconut kernels to produce oil. Hogg&#x27;s Mill found further use as a metal polish factory, possibly using crushed coconut shells as the secret ingredient. All have been demolished, although the Old Mill House still exists and is a Grade II listed building. The coconut fibre industry ceased by 1880 and the Middle Mill site was sold to Kelly &amp; Co, Printers (printers of the famous Kelly&#x27;s Directory,) and became a significant employer in Kingston. Kelly&#x27;s moved out in 1932 to Andover. The site was redeveloped by Kingston University in the 1990s.

<text>Henjo Oliver Richter, (born 24 November 1963 in Hamburg, West Germany) is a guitarist and keyboardist in Gamma Ray, the German power metal band formed by Kai Hansen.

==Biography==
Henjo is a self-taught musician and started playing at the age of 13. He is a veteran of the German heavy metal scene, but Gamma Ray is his first major band. He joined them as a replacement for guitarist Dirk Schlächter (who had switched instrument to bass) on &quot;Somewhere Out in Space&quot; (1997). However, in the mid-1980s, Henjo was a member of the heavy metal band Rampage, replacing Roland Grapow. Coincidentally, Michael Weikath considered Richter to join Helloween. Had this happened, he would have replaced Grapow just like he did in Rampage.

In 2001, Henjo was hired by Tobias Sammet to be the guitarist of his metal opera project Avantasia .

In 2017, it was announced on Gamma Ray&#x27;s website that the debut album of &#x27;The Unity&#x27;, which Richter founded together with Michael Ehré, was to be released in spring 2017.

===Injuries===
In 2005, Henjo was forced to miss part of Gamma Ray&#x27;s tour for their album &quot;Majestic&quot; after injuring himself falling down a set of stairs on the ferry going between Sweden and Finland.

Kasperi Heikkinen replaced Henjo Richter for shows scheduled in Germany and Czech Republic in March 2010 because Henjo was hospitalized on 16 March 2010 due to retinal detachment.

In 2011, he had a biking accident and broke three ribs and his collarbone.

In 2024, he was ran over

<text>James Welch VC (7 July 1889 – 28 June 1978) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

James Welch was born at Stratfield Saye. He was 27 years old, and a lance corporal in the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales&#x27;s), British Army during the First World War when he performed the actions for which he was awarded the VC.

On 29 April 1917 near Oppy, France, Lance-Corporal Welch entered an enemy trench and killed one man after a severe hand-to-hand struggle. Then, armed only with an empty revolver, he chased four enemies across the open and captured them single-handedly. He handled his machine-gun with the utmost fearlessness, and more than once went into the open, exposed to heavy fire, to search for and collect ammunition and spare parts in order to keep his guns in action, which he succeeded in doing for over five hours, until wounded by a shell.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant. He died at the age of 88 on 28 June 1978 at Bournemouth and was cremated there on 4 July. His VC is displayed at The Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (Salisbury) Museum, Salisbury, Wiltshire, England.

<doc id="1187418" wikidata="Q2343213" url="?curid=1187418" title="Marcus Siepen">
<text>Marcus Siepen (born 8 September 1968) is a German guitarist, best known as the rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist of power metal band Blind Guardian. For the biggest percentage of Blind Guardian&#x27;s songs, particularly in more recent years, he has almost strictly played rhythm guitar, with most lead and solo work being performed by André Olbrich. He has also been part of the band Sinbreed and live member of Demons &amp; Wizards.

== Personal life ==
Siepen is divorced and has a son from his first marriage. He has since remarried. Growing up in a Roman Catholic family, Siepen claims to not be religious, and that he doesn&#x27;t believe in God. He views Jesus Christ as a human philosopher, &quot;a very charismatic person with a great view of how people should live together.&quot;

== Equipment ==
Since 1995, Siepen has been an endorser of Mesa/Boogie amplifiers, using various Triple Rectifier heads and multiple preamps.

As of 2010, his main rack consisted of a Triple Rectifier &quot;Recto Reborn&quot; head, with a Fractal Audio Axe-FX II providing effects. He uses two Sennheiser wireless units, one as a backup, and his old two-channel Rectifier as a backup. When doing overseas shows, he solely uses an Axe-FX II. Previous versions of his rack featured the two-channel Triple Rectifier as his main amplifier, a Rocktron Intelliflex instead of the Fractal for effects, and either a Mesa/Boogie TriAxis preamp or Rectifier Recording Preamp instead of his two-channel Triple Rectifier as a backup.

For guitars, Siepen has made most use of Gibson and ESP Guitars, with Gibson being his preferred brand nowadays. Up until the late &#x27;90s, Siepen mostly used ESP guitars with Blind Guardian co-guitarist André Olbrich, both guitarists making use of custom-made Horizon and Mirage guitars, although Siepen has been seen using other shapes, such as a custom-built model based on the Jackson Randy Rhoads. He can sometimes be seen with a custom ESP Eclipse, but he does not use this model often.

His current main guitars, since then, have been several Gibsons, mostly Les Paul models, his main two being a Les Paul Custom and a Les Paul Standard Premium Plus. Most of his guitars, including the previously two mentioned models, feature dual EMG 81 pickups, Suhr Doug Aldrich pickups, and TonePros hardware.

<text>John Haring (September 28, 1739 – April 1, 1809) was an American lawyer from New York. During his long political career, he was a delegate to the First Continental Congress and Congress of the Confederation, served as president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the New York Provincial Congress, served in both the New York State Legislature and New Jersey Legislature, and was a presidential elector.

==Biography==

Haring was born to a large Dutch family at Tappan, New York, which was then part of Orange County. He was the fourth of eight children. His parents were Colonel Abraham and Martyntje (Bogart) Haring, and he was christened &quot;Jan&quot; at the Dutch Reformed Church of Tappan. He remained a member of that church throughout his life. Haring attended school and read law in New York City and was admitted to the bar. He practiced both in the city and in Orange County. He married a cousin, Maria Haring, on October 3, 1773. The couple went on to have ten children.

Haring took his place in a family that was locally prominent. He served as a county judge. As the American Revolution neared, he became a member, and then head, of Orange County&#x27;s committee of correspondence. On July 4, 1774, the community of Orangetown adopted the Orangetown Resolutions, which objected to the British &quot;act for shutting up the port of Boston&quot; and proposed &quot;stopping of all exportation and importation to and from Great Britain and the West Indies&quot;—Haring was one of five men named &quot;to correspond with the City of New York, and to conclude and agree upon such measures as they shall judge necessary in order to obtain a repeal of said acts.&quot; When Haring was sent to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, it adopted the Continental Association on October 20, 1774, which contained similar language calling for a trade boycott against British merchants; however, Haring was one of three members of the Continental Congress who did not sign the Continental Association.

Haring was elected to the New York Provincial Congress (or revolutionary government) five times, from 1775 to 1777. In two of those sessions, he was the president &quot;pro tempore&quot; of that body. In 1780, Haring and one of his daughters attended the hanging of John André, a British Army major who was executed as a spy. Haring served in the New York State Senate from 1781 to 1789.
Haring was returned to the Continental Congress from 1785 to 1787 (now referred to as the Congress of the Confederation to distinguish it from the Congresses of 1774–1781).

In 1784, the New York State Legislature was busy revising vestiges of the various laws and institutions from their colonial form to one befitting a free state. A new charter was adopted for King’s College in New York City (which had been formed in 1754 by a charter from the crown), incorporating it as Columbia College. The new charter established a board of regents, of which Haring was one of the original 24 members. He remained in that post until 1787.
In 1788, Haring was a delegate to the New York state convention that ratified the United States Constitution. His vote, however, was against ratification, since he believed a stronger recognition of state and individual rights was required. In 1794, Haring removed to Bergen County, New Jersey, and was a member of the New Jersey Legislature in 1795–96. About 1804, he returned to Tappan, New York, and was a presidential elector in 1804, voting for Thomas Jefferson and George Clinton.

He returned to the state legislature as a member of the New York State Assembly in 1806.
Haring died at Blauvelt, New York, on April 1, 1809, and is buried in the cemetery of the Reformed Church of Tappan. He left his wife, Maria, $800 along with a &quot;Negro woman slave&quot;. Maria lived another 16 years.

<text>A hypothetical Wutana language was mentioned in early editions of the Ethnologue as spoken in Nigeria, but has now been removed. The inclusion of Wutana in the Ethnologue was based on two sentences in a 1922 article by Olive Temple:

<doc id="1187427" wikidata="Q930082" url="?curid=1187427" title="Buhturi">
<text>Al-Walīd ibn Ubaidillah Al-Buḥturī () (821–97 AD; 206–84 AH) was an Arab poet born at Manbij in Islamic Syria, between Aleppo and the Euphrates. Like Abū Tammām (), he was of the tribe of Tayy, from the Buhturids.

==Biography==
While still young, al-Buḥturī visited Abū Tammām at Homs, on whose recommendation the authorities at Ma&#x27;arrat an-Nu&#x27;man awarded al-Buḥturī an annual pension of 4000 dirhams. Later he went to Baghdād, where he wrote verses in praise of the caliph al-Mutawakkil and of the members of his court. Although long resident in Baghdād, he devoted much of his poetry to the praise of Aleppo, and his love-poetry dedicated to a girl, Aiwa, of that city. He died at Manbij in 897.

He was often compared with the famous poet Abu Tammâm, who was his contemporary and mentor. The poems of al-Buhturî are examples of the classical style in Arabic poetry. He worked as a panegyrist to make a living and gained fame with his panegyrics.

His dīwan (collected poetry) was edited and published twice in the 10th century. First by Abū Bakr al-Ṣūlī, in the section of whose book &quot;Kitāb Al-Awrāq&quot; (كتاب الاوراق) on Muḥadathūn (modern poets), al-Buḥturī is included among a group of fourteen poets whose dīwans al-Ṣūlī edited and arranged alphabetically according to the final consonant in each line. The second editor arranged his dīwan according to subject (1883, Istanbul). Like Abu Tammam, he made a collection of early poems also known as the &quot;Hamasah&quot;. These collections of poems are also known as Diwans.

<doc id="1187432" wikidata="Q1581308" url="?curid=1187432" title="Conductive hearing loss">
<text>Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs when there is a problem transferring sound waves anywhere along the pathway through the outer ear, tympanic membrane (eardrum), or middle ear (ossicles). If a conductive hearing loss occurs in conjunction with a sensorineural hearing loss, it is referred to as a mixed hearing loss. 

Depending upon the severity and nature of the conductive loss, this type of hearing impairment can often be treated with surgical intervention or pharmaceuticals to partially or, in some cases, fully restore hearing acuity to within normal range. However, cases of permanent or chronic conductive hearing loss may require other treatment modalities such as hearing aid devices to improve detection of sound and speech perception.

== Causes ==
Common causes of conductive hearing loss include:

=== External ear ===
* Cerumen (earwax) or foreign body in the external auditory canal
* Otitis externa, infection or irritation of the outer ear
* Exostoses, abnormal growth of bone within the ear canal
* Tumor of the ear canal
* Congenital stenosis or atresia of the external auditory canal (narrow or blocked ear canal).
** Ear canal stenosis &amp; atresia can exist independently or may result from congenital malformations of the auricle such as microtia or anotia.
* Acquired stenosis (narrowing) of the external auditory canal following surgery or radiotherapy

=== Middle ear ===
Fluid accumulation is the most common cause of conductive hearing loss in the middle ear, especially in children. Major causes are ear infections or conditions that block the eustachian tube, such as allergies or tumors. Blocking of the eustachian tube leads to decreased pressure in the middle ear relative to the external ear, and this causes decreased motion of both the ossicles and the tympanic membrane.
* Acute or Serous otitis media
* Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM)
* Perforated eardrum
* Tympanosclerosis or scarring of the eardrum
* Cholesteatoma
* Eustachian Tube Dysfunction, inflammation or mass within the nasal cavity, middle ear, or eustachian tube itself
* Otosclerosis, abnormal growth of bone in or near the middle ear
* Middle ear tumour
* Ossicular discontinuity as a consequence of infection or temporal bone trauma
* Congenital malformation of the ossicles. This can be an isolated phenomenon or can occur as part of a syndrome where development of the 1st and 2nd branchial arches is seen such as in Goldenhar syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, branchio-oto-renal syndrome etc.
* Barotrauma, unequal air pressures in the external and middle ear. This can temporarily occur, for example, by the environmental pressure changes as when shifting altitude, or inside a train going into a tunnel. It is managed by any of various methods of ear clearing manoeuvres to equalize the pressures, like swallowing, yawning, or the Valsalva manoeuvre. More severe barotrauma can lead to middle ear fluid or even permanent sensorineural hearing loss.

=== Inner ear ===
Third window effect caused by:
* Superior canal dehiscence – which may require surgical correction.
* Enlarged vestibular aqueduct
* Labyrinthine fistula

==Presentation==
Conductive hearing loss makes all sounds seem faint or muffled. The hearing loss is usually worse in lower frequencies.
Congenital conductive hearing loss is identified through newborn hearing screening or may be identified because the baby has microtia or other facial abnormalities. Conductive hearing loss developing during childhood is usually due to otitis media with effusion and may present with speech and language delay or difficulty hearing. Later onset of conductive hearing loss may have an obvious cause such as an ear infection, trauma or upper respiratory tract infection or may have an insidious onset related to chronic middle ear disease, otosclerosis or a tumour of the naso-pharynx. Earwax is a very common cause of a conductive hearing loss which may present suddenly when the wax blocks sound from getting through the external ear canal to the middle and inner ear.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis requires a detailed history, local examination of the ear, nose, throat and neck, and detailed hearing tests. In children a more detailed examination may be required if the hearing loss is congenital.

===Otoscopy===
Examination of the external ear canal and ear drum is important and may help identify problems located in the outer ear up to the tympanic membrane.

===Differential testing===
For basic screening, a conductive hearing loss can be identified using the Rinne test with a 256 Hz tuning fork. The Rinne test, in which a patient is asked to say whether a vibrating tuning fork is heard more loudly adjacent to the ear canal (air conduction) or touching the bone behind the ear (bone conduction), is negative indicating that bone conduction is more effective that air conduction. A normal, or positive, result, is when air conduction is more effective than bone conduction.

With a one-sided conductive component the combined use of both the Weber and Rinne tests is useful. If the Weber test is used, in which a vibrating tuning fork is touched to the midline of the forehead, the person will hear the sound more loudly in the affected ear because background noise does not mask the hearing on this side.

The following table compares sensorineural hearing loss to conductive:
===Tympanometry===
Tympanometry, or acoustic immitance testing, is a simple objective test of the ability of the middle ear to transmit sound waves from the outer ear to the middle ear and to the inner ear. This test is usually abnormal with conductive hearing loss. A type B tympanogram reveals a flat response, due to fluid in the middle ear (otitis media), or an eardrum perforation. A type C tympanogram indicates negative middle ear pressure, which is commonly seen in eustachian tube dysfunction. A type As tympanogram indicates a shallow compliance of the middle ear, which is commonly seen in otosclerosis.

===Audiometry===
Pure tone audiometry, a standardized hearing test over a set of frequencies from 250 Hz to 8000 Hz, may be conducted by a medical doctor, audiologist or audiometrist, with the result plotted separately for each ear on an audiogram. The shape of the plot reveals the degree and nature of hearing loss, distinguishing conductive hearing loss from other kinds of hearing loss. A conductive hearing loss is characterized by a difference of at least 15 decibels between the air conduction threshold and bone conduction threshold at the same frequency. On an audiogram, the &quot;x&quot; represents responses in the left ear at each frequency, while the &quot;o&quot; represents responses in right ear at each frequency.

===CT scan===
Most causes of conductive hearing loss can be identified by examination but if it is important to image the bones of the middle ear or inner ear then a CT scan is required. CT scan is useful in cases of congenital conductive hearing loss, chronic suppurative otitis media or cholesteatoma, ossicular damage or discontinuity, otosclerosis and third window dehiscence. Specific MRI scans can be used to identify cholesteatoma.

==Pathophysiology==
==Management==
Management falls into three modalities: surgical treatment, pharmaceutical treatment, and supportive, depending on the nature and location of the specific cause.

In cases of infection, antibiotics or antifungal medications are an option. Some conditions are amenable to surgical intervention such as middle ear fluid, cholesteatoma, and otosclerosis. If conductive hearing loss is due to head trauma, surgical repair is an option. If absence or deformation of ear structures cannot be corrected, or if the patient declines surgery, hearing aids which amplify sounds are a possible treatment option. Bone conduction hearing aids are useful as these deliver sound directly, through bone, to the cochlea or organ of hearing bypassing the pathology. These can be on a soft or hard headband or can be inserted surgically, a bone anchored hearing aid, of which there are several types. Conventional air conduction hearing aids can also be used.

<text>The E8 European long distance path or E8 path is one of the European long-distance paths, leading 4,700 km (2,920 miles) across Europe, from Cork in Ireland to Bulgaria.

==Route==
After Ireland it crosses the Irish Sea into Wales and then into England, where it follows part of the Trans Pennine Trail. After crossing the North Sea, it passes through the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Poland, Ukraine and Romania. It finally crosses Bulgaria before reaching the border to Turkey.

==History==
It was the first European long-distance path to be designated, and opened, in the UK. The section was opened in 1996.

Some of the eastern sections of the route are yet to be finalised.

<doc id="1187445" wikidata="Q3614033" url="?curid=1187445" title="American Association of Port Authorities">
<text>The American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) is a trade association founded in 1912 that represents 150 port authorities in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, and Latin America.

Headquartered in Washington, D.C., AAPA protects and advances the common interests of its diverse member organizations as they connect their communities with the global transportation system. Member ports vary in size, cargo and vessel types handled, operating structure, and geographic service area.

According to AAPA, America&#x27;s ports are gateways to the world and a critical component in economic health and national defense. On average, each of the 50 states relies on 13 to 15 ports to handle its imports and exports, which add up to over $5.5 billion worth of goods moving in and out of U.S. ports every day.

The association has four main goals:

*Advocate governmental policies that strengthen and expand opportunities for member ports
*Advance professionalism in all facets of port management and operations
*Promote information sharing and relationship-building opportunities for all members
*Achieve greater understanding of the essential role and economic value of ports

==Key issues==
One key issue that AAPA focuses on is the reorganization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). AAPA hopes that the fund can be applied in a way that fully benefits ports and their surrounding communities. Since the creation of the fund in 1986, HMTF tax revenue has been used by the government to fund projects unrelated to port development. AAPA believes that the funding should go directly to ports in order to complete maintenance dredging. Regular maintenance dredging is crucial to most navigable waterways, harbors, and ports. Each year, several hundred feet of sand, gravel, and silt must be removed from waterways and harbors to maintain navigability -- enough for a four-lane highway four feet deep stretching between New York City and Los Angeles, California, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

AAPA also supports the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s National Freight Policy framework, which focuses on increasing public and private investment in freight infrastructure through tax incentives. It also seeks to improve public and private collaboration on freight-related issues by increasing public-sector awareness about trends in private-sector freight operations and investment.

In March 2020, due to a COVID-19-related decrease in traffic and revenue, the AAPA sought $6.5 billion in financial support from the federal government.

<doc id="1187454" wikidata="Q2529513" url="?curid=1187454" title="Rumble Roses">
<text>is a professional wrestling fighting game that was developed by Yuke&#x27;s and published by Konami for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The game uses the same engine as Yuke&#x27;s 2003 release &quot;WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain&quot;. &quot;Rumble Roses&quot; was followed by &quot;Rumble Roses XX&quot;, released for the Xbox 360 in 2006.

&quot;Rumble Roses&quot; features only female wrestling characters, each with both a good (Face) and bad (Heel) persona for players to choose from; the only limitation is that the good and bad version of the same character cannot fight each other. The game features 11 playable characters, each with two versions of the same character. It received lukewarm reviews, with most commending it for its graphics but being less impressed with the audio quality, gameplay and storyline.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Rumble Roses&quot; features an all-female cast. There are regular matches and mud wrestling matches. There is also a story mode and a watch-only mode where both wrestlers are played by the AI. Each character model is claimed to contain 10,000 polygons, a record number for the PlayStation 2.

&quot;Rumble Roses&quot; features a heel/face system derived from real-life American professional wrestling. Each character has an alternate side, bringing the total character count up to 22. Most characters start as a face, or good side. Three of them, however (Bloody Shadow, Candy Cane, and Evil Rose), start as the heel or evil side. Alternate forms of each character are unlocked through the Vow System. Vows are specific things the player must complete during matches, such as not using weapons, using a Killer Move, or winning the match within a certain time limit.

The game&#x27;s unique unlock system allows only one version of each character (either heel or face) to be unlocked for exhibition matches at any time. The characters can still change back and forth, and unlocked characters remain open for story mode and gallery mode. This effectively cuts the roster in half for exhibition mode.

==Plot==
A mad scientist disguised as a nurse holds an international women&#x27;s wrestling tournament, and brainwashes and takes DNA samples from the participants to create super soldiers.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Critics generally disliked the audio quality and plot but praised the graphics. J.M. Vargas&#x27;s review for PSX Nation said that English voices in the game are &quot;utter and complete garbage&quot;. Jeremy Dunham reviewed the game for IGN, giving it 7.8 out of 10 overall: 9 in both Presentation and Graphics, 6.5 in Sound, 7.5 in Gameplay, and 7 in Lasting Appeal. Dunham found the storyline to be lackluster but enjoyed the game, commenting that &quot;it&#x27;s one of those rare games that manages to capitalize on the whole sex appeal thing without sacrificing the gameplay along with it.&quot; In an article for GamerFeed, Chris Buffa said that the &quot;gorgeous women and environments will get your blood pumping&quot; and the &quot;corny dialogue only adds to the game&#x27;s hilarity.&quot; In 2012, &quot;FHM&quot; included Benikage among the nine &quot;sexiest ninja babes in games&quot; and compared her to Jade Lopez.

<doc id="1187457" wikidata="Q2082152" url="?curid=1187457" title="Freddie West">
<text>Air Commodore Ferdinand Maurice Felix West, (19 January 1896 – 8 July 1988) was a senior Royal Air Force officer, aviator, and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Born in Paddington, London, on 19 January 1896, &quot;Freddy&quot; West was the son of an army officer killed in 1902 during the Second Boer War. His mother Clemence was French, née 
de la Garde de Saignes, and moved with him to Milan, Italy. He began study of International Law at the University of Genoa in 1913, then during the 1914 vacation took up a post in a Zurich bank.

His mother and nun aunt were friendly with Monsignor Achille Ratti, who later became Pope Pius XI. The young Freddie West went on at least one local climbing expedition with the future pope, and later in life attended a Vatican audience.

==First World War==

When the First World War broke out he in 1914 joined the British Army, initially in the Royal Army Medical Corps as a private, before being commissioned in May 1915 and joining the Royal Munster Fusiliers. He arrived in France for service on the Western Front in November 1915.

After a flight in early 1917, West decided to transfer to the Royal Flying Corps, training as an observer at Brooklands, and sent back in France in April 1917 to No 3 Squadron, becoming a fully qualified observer in July 1917, having accumulated over 100 flying hours. After six months and 225 flying hours he was posted back to Britain to undergo pilot training at Grantham. He was then posted to No 8 Squadron in January 1918, flying Army co-operation duties with the infantry and tanks. Crewing up with Lt. William Haslam in March, West flew a series of hazardous sorties over the front, culminating with both men being awarded the Military Cross on 1 May 1918.

On 21 April 1918 West, flying with observer Grice, witnessed the last combat and fall of Manfred von Richthofen, Germany&#x27;s leading fighter pilot.

On 18 June 1918, West&#x27;s aircraft was attacked by four Pfalz D.III scouts. West personally claimed one shot down, and skillfully evaded the rest to return to base. The next day West was bounced by a group of Fokker DVII scouts, and West dropped to 200 feet altitude and flew through a network of kite balloons to escape.

===Victoria Cross===
He was 22 years old, and a captain in No. 8 Squadron, Royal Air Force during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 12 August 1918, the British Army was intending to start a major offensive, but it needed information about the enemy positions. Setting off at dawn, West and his observer, Lt. John Alec Haslam, flying an Armstrong Whitworth FK 8 (serial number C8602), spotted an enemy concentration through a hole in the mist. Avoiding severe ground fire, almost immediately they came under attack from seven German fighter aircraft and West was hit in the leg, and his radio transmitter was smashed.

Continuing to identify his location, he remained under attack and manoeuvred his machine so skilfully that his observer was able to get several good bursts into the enemy machines, which drove them away. Only when he was sure of the enemy&#x27;s position did he attempt to break off and head for his own lines. He twisted his trouser leg into a tourniquet to stem the flow of blood from his wounds. Unable to make his airfield West landed behind the Allied lines and insisted on reporting his findings despite being in excruciating agony. His left leg had five wounds, one of which had shattered his femur and cut the femoral artery, and had to be amputated.

Shortly afterwards he was invalided back to Britain, where on 9 November 1918 he learned that he had been awarded the Victoria Cross. After recovering from his amputation, West was fitted with an innovatively designed Swiss artificial leg.

==Royal Air Force==
West was awarded a permanent commission in the RAF during 1919. Posted to RAF Uxbridge, he gradually returned to flying duties. He commanded No. 4 Squadron RAF in 1936, and was then appointed Air Attache to Finland and the Baltic States. He was influential in the 1938 purchase of the Bristol Blenheim light bomber by the Finnish Air Force. 

During World War II he commanded No. 50 Wing in France in late 1939. He was subsequently Air Attaché at the British Embassy in Rome in early 1940 and thereafter was part of the British Legation in Berne, where he assisted Allied airmen who had escaped into Switzerland. At one stage the German Gestapo put a price on his head because of his underground activities. He attempted to assist in the case of Princess Mafalda of Savoy, but could do little. 

At the end of the war he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his work.
==Post-war and later life==
West later achieved the rank of air commodore. With the end of the war in Europe, he retired from the RAF and joined J. Arthur Rank Film Distributors in January 1946, working in overseas sales. He became managing director in 1947 until 1958 when he retired as chairman. Subsequent directorships included Hurst Park Syndicate, Continental Shipyard Agencies, Technical Equipment Supplies Ltd, Tokalon Ltd and Terravia Trading Services.

West was interviewed on 27 May 1979 by the art historian Anna Malinovska. The interview is reproduced in &quot;Voices in Flight&quot; (Pen &amp; Sword Books, 2006). He also appeared as a contributor in the 1987 documentary &#x27;The Cavalry of the Clouds&#x27;, produced by British regional commercial television station &#x27;HTV West&#x27;. West&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Imperial War Museum.

<text>The Bottle Rockets were an American rock band formed in Festus, Missouri in 1992, and was based in St. Louis. Its founding members were Brian Henneman (guitar, vocals), Mark Ortmann (drums), Tom Parr (1992–2002, guitar, vocals) and Tom Ray (1992–1997, bass guitar); the most recent lineup consisted of Henneman, Ortmann, John Horton (joined 2003, guitar) and Keith Voegele (joined 2005, bass, vocals). Most members of the band have contributed to their catalog of original songs, as have Robert Parr (Tom&#x27;s brother) and schoolteacher Scott Taylor (who writes lyrics for some of Henneman&#x27;s tunes).

As noted in the &quot;New York Times&quot; by William Hogeland, the Bottle Rockets&#x27; songwriting has been likened to Woody Guthrie&#x27;s folk style in spirit, smarts, and satire. The band&#x27;s lyrics encapsulate the common experiences of the everyman, and are set to rousing and searing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. The band has been named as one of the leaders of the &#x27;90s alt-country/roots rock revival, alongside Uncle Tupelo. The strong social commentary of their songs reflects the influences of Woody Guthrie, Neil Young and The Replacements.

==History==
===The 1990s===
For much of the Nineties, Missouri&#x27;s Bottle Rockets were the torchbearers for smart Southern-style rock.—Mark Kemp, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;
The Bottle Rockets released their self-titled first album in 1993. &quot;The Brooklyn Side&quot; followed on East Side Digital, in 1994, to resounding critical acclaim. In 1995, the Bottle Rockets then signed with Atlantic Records, which re-released &quot;The Brooklyn Side&quot;. In January of that same year, the Bottle Rockets appeared on the FX morning talk show &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; in what was supposed to be an episode long appearance, but after performing only one song, they left the studio because they were annoyed by the shows puppet Bob, and they would not return to the studio unless he was gone. Bob stayed and the band didn&#x27;t return. The single &quot;Radar Gun&quot; was a hit on rock radio—reaching No. 27 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s rock chart—and the band toured extensively to support the album. The band appeared on the television show Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien performing one of their original songs as well as being featured in a comedic skit. The relationship with Atlantic Records turned out to be difficult. Most of the original staff who promoted &quot;The Brooklyn Side&quot; had been laid off or fired from Atlantic. The release of the Bottle Rockets&#x27; next record, &quot;24 Hours a Day&quot;, was delayed until late 1997. The band parted ways with Atlantic in 1998.

The Bottle Rockets are featured in the PBS documentary The Mississippi River of Song: The Grassroots of American Music. In the series, which is narrated by Ani DiFranco, Brian Henneman says that he and the band are &quot;reporters from the heartland&quot; writing stories about their friends. The Bottle Rockets performed live at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC at the premiere for the film, and also appear on the Smithsonian Folkways Recordings soundtrack.

Bottle Rockets then signed with Doolittle records, which later became New West Records. Doolittle released an EP of outtakes from &quot;24 Hours A Day&quot; called &quot;Leftovers&quot; in 1998. About this time, Tom Ray was replaced on bass by Robert Kearns. The Bottle Rockets&#x27; fourth full-length record, &quot;Brand New Year&quot;, was released on Doolittle in 1999. &quot;Power hooks and muscular guitar fights that would make Skynyrd proud&quot; and &quot;&#x27;70s power rock with a dirty edge—sort of ZZ Top meets Lynyrd Skynyrd meets Bad Company&quot; is the calling card of &quot;Brand New Year&quot;.

===2000–2005===
The Bottle Rockets performed at the Horseshoe Tavern in early 2000. The band again had problems with their record label, and did not record anything else until &quot;Songs of Sahm&quot;, a collection of songs by Doug Sahm, which came out on Chicago label Bloodshot Records in early 2002. Shortly after finishing this record, Parr left the band. Bottle Rockets toured as a three-piece for a while, and recorded their fifth full-length record &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (which was released in 2003 on the Sanctuary label), before adding multi-instrumentalist John Horton to the band.

Kearns amicably split with the band in the spring of 2005. After a brief search the Bottle Rockets named Keith Voegele as their new bassist. Voegele is from Saint Louis and has played in bands including the Phonocaptors.

After the Bottle Rockets&#x27; eponymous debut, having a radio hit (&quot;Radar Gun&quot;) on their second album, extensive touring, and critical acclaim, the band endured a decade of subsequent hard luck, including problems with record companies, a UPS strike holding up distribution of one of their new records, band personnel changes, and family emergencies. Concurrent with the band&#x27;s business difficulties, grunge and alternative rock came to prominence. As a result, the music industry effectively abandoned traditional rock artists, in favor of marketing more trendy acts. The path Henneman and the Bottle Rockets had been on seemed to disappear.

Despite those struggles, in 2005, founders Brian Henneman and Mark Ortmann got the band back on course, along with the newest additions John Horton and Keith Voegele, the current line-up of band members. The band also re-hired their manager from the early days, Bob Andrews.

===2006–2007===
The Bottle Rockets&#x27; first live album &quot;Live in Heilbronn Germany&quot; was released in February 2006. The double-disc set was recorded on July 17, 2005 at the Burgerhaus, Heilbronn-Bockingen, Germany with the band&#x27;s current roster. It was released in Europe on CD and vinyl by Blue Rose Records.

Bloodshot Records released the band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Zoysia&quot;, recorded in Ardent Studios in Memphis with producer Jeff Powell, in June 2006. Zoysia (zoy-zhuh), a metaphor for tolerance and centered values and common ground, is a hardy grass, plentiful in Festus/Crystal City and Saint Louis, Missouri, where these hardworking musicians grew up. After years of misleading portrayals of the band&#x27;s music as &quot;hillbilly&quot;, the band&#x27;s catalog proves otherwise with themes of maturity, generosity of spirit, neighborliness, insightful self-reflection, personal roots and modern society, individualism, pride of place, slow-mending hearts, and post-9/11 reality through the filter of a couple&#x27;s romance. The Bottle Rockets continued with &quot;Zoysia&quot;:

It would be a mistake to claim that Missouri&#x27;s answer to Neil Young&#x27;s Crazy Horse has gone soft but their first release in more than three years shows greater range and reflection than is typical for the rock-solid quartet. The opening &quot;Better Than Broken&quot;, the brooding &quot;Happy Anniversary&quot;, and the acoustic wistful &quot;Where I Come From&quot; all evoke the aftermath of romantic upheaval... &quot;Middle Man&quot; could be the band&#x27;s signature tune defining a sensibility that is Middle American in more than geography. The sage wisdom of frontman Brian Henneman&#x27;s &quot;Blind&quot; and the twang of &quot;Feeling Down&quot; show the band&#x27;s countrier side while &quot;I Quit&quot; has the groove of retro soul. Yet the guitar finale of the seven-minute album-closing title song [&quot;Zoysia&quot;] finds the Bottle Rockets as explosive as ever. —&quot;Don McLeese&quot;

&quot;Zoysia&quot; received positive reviews, including a spot on novelist/audiophile Stephen King&#x27;s Best Records of 2006 list in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine.

===2008: 15th anniversary year===

The band celebrated its 15th anniversary throughout 2008. Instead of extensive touring like in previous years, the band played only 15 shows in select cities during the entire year.

The Bottle Rockets&#x27; reputation as the underdog spokesmen translated into a collaboration with fans in 2008. Fans of the Bottle Rockets had a voice in the band&#x27;s 15th Anniversary Tour, having been invited to design set lists for the 2008 tour from the Bottle Rockets’ catalog plus one cover song suggestion. The band hand-picked a fan&#x27;s set list for each of the special anniversary shows and entered the set list winners in a year-long contest to win one of 2 grand prizes, a $1500.00 custom Golden Rocket guitar by Creston Electric Instruments or the &quot;Bottle Rockets for life&quot; prize package.

The results of the first such collaboration were detailed by Roy Kasten and Barry Gilbert in their reviews of the performance, in the Riverfront Times and the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch, respectively.

While other artists have covered Bottle Rockets’ songs, including John Hiatt, (Hiatt recorded &quot;Welfare Music&quot; for Don Imus’ &quot;Ranch Record&quot;), Peter Blackstock of &quot;No Depression&quot; implores:

&quot;...somebody, SOMEBODY record [the Bottle Rockets’ song] &#x27;Kerosene&#x27; on your next album. Big band, little band, country rock band, rock band...punk rock band...somebody just get smart and give this song the respect, and legs, it deserves.&quot; 

In July 2008, The Bottle Rockets reunited with producer Eric Ambel (&quot;Brooklyn Side&quot;, &quot;24 Hours A Day&quot;, &quot;Leftovers&quot;, &quot;Brand New Year&quot;) at his Cowboy Technical Services Recording Studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York for their latest album, &quot;Lean Forward&quot; (Bloodshot).

===2009===
On May 2, The Bottle Rockets played a special concert at the High Dive in Champaign, IL that was filmed for an upcoming live concert documentary DVD release. The set list included &quot;Hard Times,&quot; &quot;Done It All,&quot; &quot;Shame On Me,&quot; &quot;Give Me Room,&quot; &quot;Way It Used to Be&quot; and &quot;The Long Way&quot; from the then-forthcoming &quot;Lean Forward&quot; album.

&quot;Lean Forward&quot; was released by Bloodshot Records. The album charted on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart at No. 23.

===2017===
On November 27, 2017, permission was granted to the Live Music Archive at the Internet Archive to add a collection for live audio recordings for public download and noncommercial, royalty-free circulation. As of March 2018, over 100 live recordings had been posted to that site.

===2021===

On March 2, 2021, the band announced its retirement, for reasons as posted to its public Facebook account: &quot;It’s with a sad heart that we announce this uneasy news: Brian has decided to retire from the Bottle Rockets. Although he’s in good health, he’s been feeling the passage of time and has lost interest in anything that distracts from or takes him away from home. Unfortunately, this means the Bottle Rockets can’t continue as we know it.&quot;

<text>Richard Annesley West, (26 September 1878 – 2 September 1918) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
Richard Annesley West was born on 26 September 1878 at 1 Oxford Street, Cheltenham, the sixth child of Irish landowner and former army officer Augustus George West and his wife Sara West (née Eyre), of Whitepark, County Fermanagh.

He was educated at Monkton Combe School in Somerset and at Uckfield Agricultural College in Sussex.

==Military career==
West enlisted in the Imperial Yeomanry in 1900 to serve in South Africa, transferring to Kitchener&#x27;s Fighting Scouts and spending time as a prisoner of war in Linley, Orange Free State. After the war, he remained in 
South Africa until 1909, farming and training racehorses.

West was 39 years old, and an acting lieutenant colonel in the North Irish Horse, seconded to 6th Battalion, Tank Corps during the First World War when the following action took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 21 August 1918 at Courcelles, France, during an attack, the infantry lost their bearings in dense fog and Lieutenant Colonel West at once collected any men he could find and led them to their objective, in face of heavy machine-gun fire. On 2 September at Vaulx-Vraucourt, he arrived at the front line when the enemy were delivering a local counter-attack. The infantry battalion had suffered heavy officer casualties and realizing the danger if they gave way, and despite the enemy being almost upon them, Colonel West rode up and down in face of certain death, encouraging the men. He fell riddled with bullets. His magnificent bravery at a critical moment so inspired the infantry that the hostile attack was defeated.

He is buried at the Mory Abbey Military Cemetery, Mory.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross was purchased on behalf of the Lord Ashcroft collection in 2002 and is displayed on rotation at The Lord Ashcroft Gallery: Extraordinary Heroes exhibition, Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>William Basil Weston (3 January 1924 – 3 March 1945) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Weston was 21 years old, and a lieutenant in the Green Howards (Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Regiment), British Army, attached to 1st Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment during the Second World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 3 March 1945 during the attack on Meiktila, Burma, Lieutenant Weston was commanding a platoon which, together with the rest of the company, had to clear an area of the town of the enemy. In the face of fanatical opposition he led his men superbly, encouraging them from one bunker position to the next. When he came to the last, particularly well-defended bunker, he fell wounded in the entrance. Knowing that his men would not be able to capture the position without heavy casualties he pulled the pin out of one of his grenades as he lay on the ground and deliberately blew himself up with the occupants of the bunker.

==Victoria Cross medal==
William Basil Weston&#x27;s medal was placed on permanent loan at the Green Howards Museum at Richmond in 2001 by his nephew, Basil Weston of Ulverston.

<doc id="1187487" wikidata="Q928697" url="?curid=1187487" title="Sensorineural hearing loss">
<text>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a type of hearing loss in which the root cause lies in the inner ear, sensory organ (cochlea and associated structures), or the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII). SNHL accounts for about 90% of reported hearing loss. SNHL is usually permanent and can be mild, moderate, severe, profound, or total. Various other descriptors can be used depending on the shape of the audiogram, such as high frequency, low frequency, U-shaped, notched, peaked, or flat.

&quot;Sensory&quot; hearing loss often occurs as a consequence of damaged or deficient cochlear hair cells. Hair cells may be abnormal at birth or damaged during the lifetime of an individual. There are both external causes of damage, including infection, and ototoxic drugs, as well as intrinsic causes, including genetic mutations. A common cause or exacerbating factor in SNHL is prolonged exposure to environmental noise, or noise-induced hearing loss. Exposure to a single very loud noise such as a gun shot or bomb blast can cause noise-induced hearing loss. Using headphones at high volume over time, or being in loud environments regularly, such as a loud workplace, sporting events, concerts, and using noisy machines can also be a risk for noise-induced hearing loss.

&quot;Neural&quot;, or &quot;retrocochlear&quot;, hearing loss occurs because of damage to the cochlear nerve (CVIII). This damage may affect the initiation of the nerve impulse in the cochlear nerve or the transmission of the nerve impulse along the nerve into the brainstem.

Most cases of SNHL present with a gradual deterioration of hearing thresholds occurring over years to decades. In some, the loss may eventually affect large portions of the frequency range. It may be accompanied by other symptoms such as ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and dizziness or lightheadedness (vertigo). The most common kind of sensorineural hearing loss is age-related (presbycusis), followed by noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL).

Frequent symptoms of SNHL are loss of acuity in distinguishing foreground voices against noisy backgrounds, difficulty understanding on the telephone, some kinds of sounds seeming excessively loud or shrill, difficulty understanding some parts of speech (fricatives and sibilants), loss of directionality of sound (especially with high frequency sounds), perception that people mumble when speaking, and difficulty understanding speech. Similar symptoms are also associated with other kinds of hearing loss; audiometry or other diagnostic tests are necessary to distinguish sensorineural hearing loss.

Identification of sensorineural hearing loss is usually made by performing a pure tone audiometry (an audiogram) in which bone conduction thresholds are measured. Tympanometry and speech audiometry may be helpful. Testing is performed by an audiologist.

There is no proven or recommended treatment or cure for SNHL; management of hearing loss is usually by hearing strategies and hearing aids. In cases of profound or total deafness, a cochlear implant is a specialised device that may restore a functional level of hearing. SNHL is at least partially preventable by avoiding environmental noise, ototoxic chemicals and drugs, and head trauma, and treating or inoculating against certain triggering diseases and conditions like meningitis.
==Signs and symptoms==
Since the inner ear is not directly accessible to instruments, identification is by patient report of the symptoms and audiometric testing. Of those who present to their doctor with sensorineural hearing loss, 90% report having diminished hearing, 57% report having a plugged feeling in ear, and 49% report having ringing in ear (tinnitus). About half report vestibular (vertigo) problems.

For a detailed exposition of symptoms useful for screening, a self-assessment questionnaire was developed by the American Academy of Otolaryngology, called the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults (HHIA). It is a 25-question survey of subjective symptoms.

==Causes==
Sensorineural hearing loss may be genetic or acquired (i.e. as a consequence of disease, noise, trauma, etc.). People may have a hearing loss from birth (congenital) or the hearing loss may come on later. Many cases are related to old age (age-related).

===Genetic===
Hearing loss can be inherited. More than 40 genes have been implicated in the cause of deafness. There are 300 syndromes with related hearing loss, and each syndrome may have causative genes.

Recessive, dominant, X-linked, or mitochondrial genetic mutations can affect the structure or metabolism of the inner ear. Some may be single point mutations, whereas others are due to chromosomal abnormalities. Some genetic causes give rise to a late onset hearing loss. Mitochondrial mutations can cause SNHL i.e. m.1555A&gt;G, which makes the individual sensitive to the ototoxic effects of aminoglycoside antibiotics.
* The most common cause of recessive genetic congenital hearing impairment in developed countries is DFNB1, also known as Connexin 26 deafness or GJB2-related deafness.
* The most common syndromic forms of hearing impairment include (dominant) Stickler syndrome and Waardenburg syndrome, and (recessive) Pendred syndrome and Usher syndrome.
* Mitochondrial mutations causing deafness are rare: MT-TL1 mutations cause MIDD (Maternally inherited deafness and diabetes) and other conditions which may include deafness as part of the picture.
* TMPRSS3 gene was identified by its association with both congenital and childhood onset autosomal recessive deafness. This gene is expressed in fetal cochleae and many other tissues, and is thought to be involved in the development and maintenance of the inner ear or the contents of the perilymph and endolymph. It was also identified as a tumor associated gene that is overexpressed in ovarian tumors.
* Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease an inherited neurological disorder with delayed onset that can affect the ears as well as other organs. The hearing loss in this condition is often ANSD (auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder) a neural cause of hearing loss. 
* Muckle–Wells syndrome, a rare inherited autoinflammatory disorder, can lead to hearing loss.
* Autoimmune disease: although probably rare, it is possible for autoimmune processes to target the cochlea specifically, without symptoms affecting other organs. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, an autoimmune condition, may precipitate hearing loss.

===Congenital===
* Infections:
** Congenital rubella syndrome, CRS, results from transplacental transmission of the rubella virus during pregnancy. CRS has been controlled by universal vaccination (MMR or MMRV vaccine).
** Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most common cause of progressive sensorineural hearing loss in children. It is a common viral infection contracted by contact with infected bodily fluids such as saliva or urine and easily transmitted in nurseries and thus from toddlers to expectant mothers. CMV infection during pregnancy can affect the developing foetus and lead to learning difficulties as well as hearing loss.
** Toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease affecting 23% of the population in the U.S., can cause sensorineural deafness to the fetus in utero.
* Hypoplastic auditory nerves or abnormalities of the cochlea. Abnormal development of the inner ear can occur in some genetic syndromes such as LAMM syndrome (labyrinthine aplasia, microtia and microdontia), Pendred syndrome, branchio-oto-renal syndrome, CHARGE syndrome
* GATA2 deficiency, a grouping of several disorders caused by common defect, viz., familial or sporadic inactivating mutations in one of the two parental &quot;GATA2&quot; genes. These autosomal dominant mutations cause a reduction, i.e. a haploinsufficiency, in the cellular levels of the gene&#x27;s product, GATA2. The GATA2 protein is a transcription factor critical for the embryonic development, maintenance, and functionality of blood-forming, lympathic-forming, and other tissue-forming stem cells. In consequence of these mutations, cellular levels of GATA2 are deficient and individuals develop over time hematological, immunological, lymphatic, and/or other disorders. GATA2 deficiency-induced abnormalities in the lymphatic system are proposed to be responsible for a failure in generating the perilymphatic space around the inner ear&#x27;s semicircular canals, which in turn underlies the development of sensorineural hearing loss.

===Presbycusis===

Progressive age-related loss of hearing acuity or sensitivity can start as early as age 18, primarily affecting the high frequencies, and men more than women. Such losses may not become apparent until much later in life. Presbycusis is by far the dominant cause of sensorineural hearing loss in industrialized societies. A study conducted in Sudan, with a population free from loud noise exposures, found significantly less cases of hearing loss when compared with age-matched cases from an industrialized country. Similar findings were reported by a study conducted of a population from Easter island, which reported worse hearing among those that spent time in industrialized countries when compared with those that never left the island. Researchers have argued that factors other than differences in noise exposure, such as genetic make up, might also have contributed to the findings. Hearing loss that worsens with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging, such as noise-induced hearing loss, is not presbycusis, although differentiating the individual effects of multiple causes of hearing loss can be difficult. One in three persons have significant hearing loss by age 65; by age 75, one in two. Age-related hearing loss is neither preventable nor reversible.

====Noise====

Most people living in modern society have some degree of progressive sensorineural (i.e. permanent) noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) resulting from overloading and damaging the sensory or neural apparatus of hearing in the inner ear. NIHL is typically a drop-out or notch centered at 4000 Hz. Both intensity (SPL) and duration of exposure, and repetitive exposure to unsafe levels of noise contribute to cochlear damage that results in hearing loss. The louder the noise is, the shorter the safe amount of exposure is. NIHL can be either permanent or temporary, called a threshold shift. Unsafe levels of noise can be as little as 70 dB (about twice as loud as normal conversation) if there is prolonged (24-hour) or continuous exposure. 125 dB (a loud rock concert is ~120 dB) is the pain level; sounds above this level cause instant and permanent ear damage.

Noise and ageing are the primary causes of presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss, the most common kind of hearing loss in industrial society.

 The dangers of environmental and occupational noise exposure are widely recognized. Numerous national and international organizations have established standards for safe levels of exposure to noise in industry, the environment, military, transportation, agriculture, mining and other areas. Sound intensity or sound pressure level (SPL) is measured in decibels (dB). For reference:

An increase of 6 dB represents a doubling of the SPL, or energy of the sound wave, and therefore its propensity to cause ear damage. Because human ears hear logarithmically, not linearly, it takes an increase of 10 dB to produce a sound that is perceived to be twice as loud. Ear damage due to noise is proportional to sound intensity, not perceived loudness, so it&#x27;s misleading to rely on subjective perception of loudness as an indication of the risk to hearing, i.e. it can significantly underestimate the danger.

While the standards differ moderately in levels of intensity and duration of exposure considered safe, some guidelines can be derived.

The safe amount of exposure is reduced by a factor of 2 for every exchange rate (3 dB for NIOSH standard or 5 dB for OSHA standard) increase in SPL. For example, the safe daily exposure amount at 85 dB (90 dB for OSHA) is 8 hours, while the safe exposure at 94 dB(A) (nightclub level) is only 1 hour. Noise trauma can also cause a reversible hearing loss, called a temporary threshold shift. This typically occurs in individuals who are exposed to gunfire or firecrackers, and hear ringing in their ears after the event (tinnitus).
* Ambient environmental noise: Populations living near airports, railyards and train stations, freeways and industrial areas are exposed to levels of noise typically in the 65 to 75 dBA range. If lifestyles include significant outdoor or open window conditions, these exposures over time can degrade hearing. U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development sets standards for noise impact in residential and commercial construction zones. HUD&#x27;s noise standards may be found in 24 CFR Part 51, Subpart B. Environmental noise above 65 dB defines a noise-impacted area.
* Personal audio electronics: Personal audio equipment such as iPods (iPods often reach 115 decibels or higher), can produce powerful enough sound to cause significant NIHL.
* Acoustic trauma: Exposure to a single event of extremely loud noise (such as explosions) can also cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. A typical source of acoustic trauma is a too-loud music concert.
* Workplace noise: The OSHA standards 1910.95 General Industry Occupational Noise Exposure and 1926.52 Construction Industry Occupational Noise Exposure identify the level of 90 dB(A) for 8 hour exposure as the level necessary to protect workers from hearing loss.

====Disease or disorder====

* Inflammatory
** Suppurative labyrinthitis or otitis interna (inflammation of the inner ear)
* Diabetes mellitus A recent study found that hearing loss is twice as common in people with diabetes as it is in those who don&#x27;t have the disease. Also, of the 86 million adults in the U.S. who have prediabetes, the rate of hearing loss is 30 percent higher than in those with normal blood glucose. It has not been established how diabetes is related to hearing loss. It is possible that the high blood glucose levels associated with diabetes cause damage to the small blood vessels in the inner ear, similar to the way in which diabetes can damage the eyes and the kidneys. Similar studies have shown a possible link between that hearing loss and neuropathy (nerve damage).
* Tumor
** Cerebellopontine angle tumour (junction of the pons and cerebellum) – The cerebellopontine angle is the exit site of both the facial nerve(CN7) and the vestibulocochlear nerve(CN8). Patients with these tumors often have signs and symptoms corresponding to compression of both nerves.
*** Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) – benign neoplasm of Schwann cells affecting the vestibulocochlear nerve
*** Meningioma – benign tumour of the pia and arachnoid mater
* Ménière&#x27;s disease – causes sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequency range (125 Hz to 1000 Hz). Ménière&#x27;s disease is characterized by sudden attacks of vertigo, lasting minutes to hours preceded by tinnitus, aural fullness, and fluctuating hearing loss. It is relatively rare and commonly over diagnosed.
* Bacterial meningitis e.g. pneumococcal, meningococcal, haemophilus influenzae may damage the cochlea – Hearing loss is one of the most common after-effects of bacterial meningitis. It has been estimated that 30% of bacterial meningitis cases result in mild to profound hearing loss. Children are most at risk: seventy percent of all bacterial meningitis occurs in young children under the age of five.
* Viral
** AIDS and ARC patients frequently experience auditory system anomalies.
** Mumps(epidemic parotitis) may result in profound sensorineural hearing loss (90 dB or more), unilaterally (one ear) or bilaterally (both ears).
** Measles may result in auditory nerve damage but more commonly gives a mixed (sensorineural plus conductive) hearing loss, and can be bilaterally.
** Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II (herpes zoster oticus)
* Bacterial
** Syphilis is commonly transmitted from pregnant women to their fetuses, and about a third of the infected children will eventually become deaf.

====Ototoxic and neurotoxic drugs and chemicals====

Some over-the-counter as well as prescription drugs and certain industrial chemicals are ototoxic. Exposure to these can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss.

Some medications cause irreversible damage to the ear, and are limited in their use for this reason. The most important group is the aminoglycosides (main member gentamicin). A rare mitochondrial mutation, m.1555A&gt;G, can increase an individual&#x27;s susceptibility to the ototoxic effect of aminoglycosides. Long term hydrocodone (Vicodin) abuse is known to cause rapidly progressing sensorineural hearing loss, usually without vestibular symptoms. Methotrexate, a chemotherapy agent, is also known to cause hearing loss. In most cases hearing loss does not recover when the drug is stopped. Paradoxically, methotrexate is also used in the treatment of autoimmune-induced inflammatory hearing loss.

Various other medications may reversibly degrade hearing. This includes loop diuretics, sildenafil (Viagra), high or sustained dosing of NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and various prescription drugs: celecoxib, etc.), quinine, and macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, etc.). Cytotoxic agents such as carboplatinum, used to treat malignancies can give rise to a dose dependent SNHL, as can drugs such as desferrioxamine, used for haematological disorders such as thalassaemia; patients prescribed these drugs need to have hearing monitored.

Prolonged or repeated environmental or work-related exposure to ototoxic chemicals can also result in sensorineural hearing loss. Some of these chemicals are:
* butyl nitrite – chemical used recreationally known as &#x27;poppers&#x27;
* carbon disulfide – a solvent used as a building block in many organic reactions
* styrene, an industrial chemical precursor of polystyrene, a plastic
* carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas resulting from incomplete combustion
* heavy metals: tin, lead, manganese, mercury
* hexane, an industrial solvent and one of the significant constituents of gasoline
* ethylbenzene, an industrial solvent used in the production of styrene
* toluene and xylene, highly poisonous petrochemical solvents. Toluene is a component of high-octane gasoline; xylene is used in the production of polyester fibers and resins.
* trichloroethylene, an industrial degreasing solvent
* Organophosphate pesticides

====Head trauma====
There can be damage either to the ear itself or to the central auditory pathways that process the information conveyed by the ears. People who sustain head injury are susceptible to hearing loss or tinnitus, either temporary or permanent. Contact sports like football (U.S. NFL), hockey and cricket have a notable incidence of head injuries (concussions). In one survey of retired NFL players, all of whom reported one or more concussions during their playing careers, 25% had hearing loss and 50% had tinnitus.

====Perinatal conditions====
These are much more common in premature babies, particularly those under 1500 g at birth. Premature birth can be associated with problems that result in sensorineural hearing loss such as anoxia or hypoxia (poor oxygen levels), jaundice, intracranial haemorrhages, meningitis. Fetal alcohol syndrome is reported to cause hearing loss in up to 64% of infants born to alcoholic mothers, from the ototoxic effect on the developing fetus, plus malnutrition during pregnancy from the excess alcohol intake.

====Iodine deficiency / Hypothyroidism====
Iodine deficiency and endemic hypothyroidism are associated with hearing loss. If a pregnant mother has insufficient iodine intake during pregnancy it affects the development of the inner ear in the foetus leading to sensorineural deafness. This occurs in certain areas of the world, such as the Himalayas, where iodine is deficient in the soil and thus the diet. In these areas there is a high incidence of endemic goitre. This cause of deafness is prevented by adding iodine to salt.

====Brain stroke====
Brain stroke in a region affecting auditory function such as a posterior circulation infarct has been associated with deafness.

==Pathophysiology==
Sensory hearing loss is caused by abnormal structure or function of the hair cells of the organ of Corti in the cochlea. Neural hearing impairments are consequent upon damage to the eighth cranial nerve (the vestibulocochlear nerve) or the auditory tracts of the brainstem. If higher levels of the auditory tract are affected this is known as central deafness. Central deafness may present as sensorineural deafness but should be distinguishable from the history and audiological testing.

===Cochlear dead regions in sensory hearing loss===
Hearing impairment may be associated with damage to the hair cells in the cochlea. Sometimes there may be complete loss of function of inner hair cells (IHCs) over a certain region of the cochlea; this is called a &quot;dead region&quot;. The region can be defined in terms of the range of characteristic frequencies (CFs) of the IHCs and/or neurons immediately adjacent to the dead region.

====Cochlear hair cells====
Outer hair cells (OHCs) contribute to the structure of the Organ of Corti, which is situated between the basilar membrane and the tectorial membrane within the cochlea (See Figure 3). The tunnel of corti, which runs through the Organ of Corti, divides the OHCs and the inner hair cells (IHCs). OHCs are connected to the reticular laminar and the Deiters&#x27; cells. There are roughly twelve thousand OHCs in each human ear, and these are arranged in up to five rows. Each OHC has small tufts of &#x27;hairs&#x27;, or cilia, on their upper surface known as stereocilia, and these are also arranged into rows which are graded in height. There are approximately 140 stereocilia on each OHC.

The fundamental role of the OHCs and the IHCs is to function as sensory receptors. The main function of the IHCs is to transmit sound information via afferent neurons. They do this by transducing mechanical movements or signals into neural activity. When stimulated, the stereocilia on the IHCs move, causing a flow of electric current to pass through the hair cells. This electric current creates action potentials within the connected afferent neurons.

OHCs are different in that they actually contribute to the active mechanism of the cochlea. They do this by receiving mechanical signals or vibrations along the basilar membrane, and transducing them into electrochemical signals. The stereocilia found on OHCs are in contact with the tectorial membrane. Therefore, when the basilar membrane moves due to vibrations, the stereocilia bend. The direction in which they bend, dictates the firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the OHCs.

The bending of the stereocilia towards the basal body of the OHC causes excitation of the hair cell. Thus, an increase in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. On the other hand, the bending of the stereocilia away from the basal body of the OHC causes inhibition of the hair cell. Thus, a decrease in firing rate of the auditory neurons connected to the hair cell occurs. OHCs are unique in that they are able to contract and expand (electromotility). Therefore, in response to the electrical stimulations provided by the efferent nerve supply, they can alter in length, shape and stiffness. These changes influence the response of the basilar membrane to sound. It is therefore clear that the OHCs play a major role in the active processes of the cochlea. The main function of the active mechanism is to finely tune the basilar membrane, and provide it with a high sensitivity to quiet sounds. The active mechanism is dependent on the cochlea being in good physiological condition. However, the cochlea is very susceptible to damage.

=====Hair cell damage=====

SNHL is most commonly caused by damage to the OHCs and the IHCs. There are two methods by which they might become damaged. Firstly, the entire hair cell might die. Secondly, the stereocilia might become distorted or destroyed. Damage to the cochlea can occur in several ways, for example by viral infection, exposure to ototoxic chemicals, and intense noise exposure. Damage to the OHCs results in either a less effective active mechanism, or it may not function at all. OHCs contribute to providing a high sensitivity to quiet sounds at a specific range of frequencies (approximately 2–4 kHz). Thus, damage to the OHCs results in the reduction of sensitivity of the basilar membrane to weak sounds. Amplification to these sounds is therefore required, in order for the basilar membrane to respond efficiently. IHCs are less susceptible to damage in comparison to the OHCs. However, if they become damaged, this will result in an overall loss of sensitivity.

===Neural tuning curves===

====Frequency selectivity====
The traveling wave along the basilar membrane peaks at different places along it, depending on whether the sound is low or high frequency. Due to the mass and stiffness of the basilar membrane, low frequency waves peak in the apex, while high frequency sounds peak in the basal end of the cochlea. Therefore, each position along the basilar membrane is finely tuned to a particular frequency. These specifically tuned frequencies are referred to as characteristic frequencies (CF).

If a sound entering the ear is displaced from the characteristic frequency, then the strength of response from the basilar membrane will progressively lessen. The fine tuning of the basilar membrane is created by the input of two separate mechanisms. The first mechanism being a linear passive mechanism, which is dependent on the mechanical structure of the basilar membrane and its surrounding structures. The second mechanism is a non-linear active mechanism, which is primarily dependent on the functioning of the OHCs, and also the general physiological condition of the cochlea itself. The base and apex of the basilar membrane differ in stiffness and width, which cause the basilar membrane to respond to varying frequencies differently along its length. The base of the basilar membrane is narrow and stiff, resulting in it responding best to high frequency sounds. The apex of the basilar membrane is wider and much less stiff in comparison to the base, causing it to respond best to low frequencies.

This selectivity to certain frequencies can be illustrated by neural tuning curves. These demonstrate the frequencies a fiber responds to, by showing threshold levels (dB SPL) of auditory nerve fibers as a function of different frequencies. This demonstrates that auditory nerve fibers respond best, and hence have better thresholds at the fiber&#x27;s characteristic frequency and frequencies immediately surrounding it. The basilar membrane is said to be &#x27;sharply tuned&#x27; due to the sharp V-shaped curve, with its &#x27;tip&#x27; centered at the auditory fibers characteristic frequency. This shape shows how few frequencies a fiber responds to. If it were a broader &#x27;V&#x27; shape, it would be responding to more frequencies (See Figure 4).

====IHC vs OHC hearing loss====

A normal neural tuning curve is characterised by a broadly tuned low frequency &#x27;tail&#x27;, with a finely tuned middle frequency &#x27;tip&#x27;. However, where there is partial or complete damage to the OHCs, but with unharmed IHCs, the resulting tuning curve would show the elimination of sensitivity at the quiet sounds. I.e. where the neural tuning curve would normally be most sensitive (at the &#x27;tip&#x27;) (See Figure 5).

Where both the OHCs and the IHCs are damaged, the resulting neural tuning curve would show the elimination of sensitivity at the &#x27;tip&#x27;. However, due to IHC damage, the whole tuning curve becomes raised, giving a loss of sensitivity across all frequencies (See Figure 6). It is only necessary for the first row of OHCs to be damaged for the elimination of the finely tuned &#x27;tip&#x27; to occur. This supports the idea that the incidence of OHC damage and thus a loss of sensitivity to quiet sounds, occurs more than IHC loss.

When the IHCs or part of the basilar membrane are damaged or destroyed, so that they no longer function as transducers, the result is a &#x27;dead region&#x27;. Dead regions can be defined in terms of the characteristic frequencies of the IHC, related to the specific place along the basilar membrane where the dead region occurs. Assuming that there has been no shift in the characteristic frequencies relating to certain regions of the basilar membrane, due to the damage of OHCs. This often occurs with IHC damage. Dead regions can also be defined by the anatomical place of the non-functioning IHC (such as an &quot;apical dead region&quot;), or by the characteristic frequencies of the IHC adjacent to the dead region.

===Dead region audiometry===

====Pure tone audiometry (PTA)====

Dead regions affect audiometric results, but perhaps not in the way expected. For example, it may be expected that thresholds would not be obtained at the frequencies within the dead region, but would be obtained at frequencies adjacent to the dead region. Therefore, assuming normal hearing exists around the dead region, it would produce an audiogram that has a dramatically steep slope between the frequency where a threshold is obtained, and the frequency where a threshold cannot be obtained due to the dead region.

However, it appears that this is not the case. Dead regions cannot be clearly found via PTA audiograms. This may be because although the neurons innervating the dead region, cannot react to vibration at their characteristic frequency. If the basilar membrane vibration is large enough, neurons tuned to different characteristic frequencies such as those adjacent to the dead region, will be stimulated due to the spread of excitation. Therefore, a response from the patient at the test frequency will be obtained. This is referred to as &quot;off-place listening&quot;, and is also known as &#x27;off-frequency listening&#x27;. This will lead to a false threshold being found. Thus, it appears a person has better hearing than they actually do, resulting in a dead region being missed. Therefore, using PTA alone, it is impossible to identify the extent of a dead region (See Figure 7 and 8).

Consequently, how much is an audiometric threshold affected by a tone with its frequency within a dead region? This depends on the location of the dead region. Thresholds at low frequency dead regions, are more inaccurate than those at higher frequency dead regions. This has been attributed to the fact that excitation due to vibration of the basilar membrane spreads upwards from the apical regions of the basilar membrane, more than excitation spreads downwards from higher frequency basal regions of the cochlea. This pattern of the spread of excitation is similar to the &#x27;upward spread of masking&#x27; phenomenon. If the tone is sufficiently loud to produce enough excitation at the normally functioning area of the cochlea, so that it is above that areas threshold. The tone will be detected, due to off-frequency listening which results in a misleading threshold.

To help to overcome the issue of PTA producing inaccurate thresholds within dead regions, masking of the area beyond the dead region that is being stimulated can be used. This means that the threshold of the responding area is sufficiently raised, so that it cannot detect the spread of excitation from the tone. This technique has led to the suggestion that a low frequency dead region may be related to a loss of 40-50 dB. However, as one of the aims of PTA is to determine whether or not there is a dead region, it may be difficult to assess which frequencies to mask without the use of other tests.

Based on research it has been suggested that a low frequency dead region may produce a relatively flat loss, or a very gradually sloping loss towards the higher frequencies. As the dead region will be less detectable due to the upward spread of excitation. Whereas, there may be a more obvious steeply sloping loss at high frequencies for a high frequency dead region. Although it is likely that the slope represents the less pronounced downward spread of excitation, rather than accurate thresholds for those frequencies with non-functioning hair cells. Mid-frequency dead regions, with a small range, appear to have less effect on the patient&#x27;s ability to hear in everyday life, and may produce a notch in the PTA thresholds. Although it is clear that PTA is not the best test to identify a dead region.

====Psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTC) and threshold equalizing noise (TEN) tests====

Although some debate continues regarding the reliability of such tests, it has been suggested that psychoacoustic tuning curves (PTCs) and threshold-equalising noise (TEN) results may be useful in detecting dead regions, rather than PTA. PTCs are similar to neural tuning curves. They illustrate the level of a masker (dB SPL) tone at threshold, as a function of deviation from center frequency (Hz). They are measured by presenting a fixed low intensity pure tone while also presenting a narrow-band masker, with a varying center frequency. The masker level is varied, so that the level of masker needed to just mask the test signal is found for the masker at each center frequency. The tip of the PTC is where the masker level needed to just mask the test signal is the lowest. For normal hearing people this is when the masker center frequency is closest to the frequency of the test signal (See Figure 9).

In the case of dead regions, when the test signal lies within the boundaries of a dead region, the tip of the PTC will be shifted to the edge of the dead region, to the area that is still functioning and detecting the spread of excitation from the signal. In the case of a low frequency dead region, the tip is shifted upwards indicating a low frequency dead region starting at the tip of the curve. For a high frequency dead region, the tip is shifted downwards from the signal frequency to the functioning area below the dead region. However, the traditional method of obtaining PTCs is not practical for clinical use, and it has been argued that TENs are not accurate enough. A fast method for finding PTCs has been developed and it may provide the solution. However, more research to validate this method is required, before it can be accepted clinically.

====Perceptual consequences of a dead region====

Audiogram configurations are not good indicators of how a dead region will affect a person functionally, mainly due to individual differences. For example, a sloping audiogram is often present with a dead region, due to the spread of excitation. However, the individual may well be affected differently from someone with a corresponding sloped audiogram caused by partial damage to hair cells rather than a dead region. They will perceive sounds differently, yet the audiogram suggests that they have the same degree of loss. Huss and Moore investigated how hearing impaired patients perceive pure tones, and found that they perceive tones as noisy and distorted, more (on average) than a person without a hearing impairment. However, they also found that the perception of tones as being like noise, was not directly related to frequencies within the dead regions, and was therefore not an indicator of a dead region. This therefore suggests that audiograms, and their poor representation of dead regions, are inaccurate predictors of a patient&#x27;s perception of pure tone quality.

Research by Kluk and Moore has shown that dead regions may also affect the patient&#x27;s perception of frequencies beyond the dead regions. There is an enhancement in the ability to distinguish between tones that differ very slightly in frequency, in regions just beyond the dead regions compared to tones further away. An explanation for this may be that cortical re-mapping has occurred. Whereby, neurons which would normally be stimulated by the dead region, have been reassigned to respond to functioning areas near it. This leads to an over-representation of these areas, resulting in an increased perceptual sensitivity to small frequency differences in tones.

===Vestibulocochlear nerve pathology===
* congenital deformity of the internal auditory canal,
* neoplastic and pseudo-neoplastic lesions, with special detailed emphasis on schwannoma of the eighth cranial nerve (acoustic neuroma),
* non-neoplastic Internal Auditory Canal/CerebelloPontine Angle pathology, including vascular loops,

==Diagnosis==

===Case history===
Before examination, a case history provides guidance about the context of the hearing loss.
* major concern
* pregnancy and childbirth information
* medical history
* development history
* family history

===Otoscopy===
Direct examination of the external canal and tympanic membrane (ear drum) with an otoscope, a medical device inserted into the ear canal that uses light to examine the condition of the external ear and tympanic membrane, and
middle ear through the semi-translucent membrane.

===Differential testing===
Differential testing is most useful when there is unilateral hearing loss, and distinguishes conductive from sensorineural loss. These are conducted with a low frequency tuning fork, usually 512 Hz, and contrast measures of air and bone conducted sound transmission.
* Weber test, in which a tuning fork is touched to the midline of the forehead, localizes to the normal ear in people with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.
* Rinne test, which tests air conduction &quot;vs.&quot; bone conduction is positive, because both bone and air conduction are reduced equally.
* less common Bing and Schwabach variants of the Rinne test.
* absolute bone conduction (ABC) test.

&quot;Table 1&quot;. A table comparing sensorineural to conductive hearing loss

Other, more complex, tests of auditory function are required to distinguish the different types of hearing loss. Bone conduction thresholds can differentiate sensorineural hearing loss from conductive hearing loss. Other tests, such as oto-acoustic emissions, acoustic stapedial reflexes, speech audiometry and evoked response audiometry are needed to distinguish sensory, neural and auditory processing hearing impairments.

===Tympanometry===
A tympanogram is the result of a test with a tympanometer. It tests the function of the middle ear and mobility of the eardrum. It can help identify conductive hearing loss due to disease of the middle ear or eardrum from other kinds of hearing loss including SNHL.

===Audiometry===
An audiogram is the result of a hearing test. The most common type of hearing test is pure tone audiometry (PTA). It charts the thresholds of hearing sensitivity at a selection of standard frequencies between 250 and 8000 Hz. There is also high frequency pure tone audiometry which tests frequencies from 8000 to 20,000 Hz. PTA can be used to differentiate between conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss and mixed hearing loss. A hearing loss can be described by its degree i.e. mild, moderate, severe or profound, or by its shape i.e. high frequency or sloping, low frequency or rising, notched, U-shaped or &#x27;cookie-bite&#x27;, peaked or flat.

There are also other kinds of audiometry designed to test hearing acuity rather than sensitivity (speech audiometry), or to test
auditory neural pathway transmission (evoked response audiometry).

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
MRI scans can be used to identify gross structural causes of hearing loss. They are used for congenital hearing loss when changes to the shape of the inner ear or nerve of hearing may help diagnosis of the cause of the hearing loss. They are also useful in cases where a tumour is suspected or to determine the degree of damage in a hearing loss caused by bacterial infection or auto-immune disease. Scanning is of no value in age-related deafness.

==Prevention==
Presbycusis is the leading cause of SNHL and is progressive and nonpreventable, and at this time, we do not have either somatic or gene therapy to counter heredity-related SNHL. But other causes of acquired SNHL are largely preventable, especially nosocusis type causes. This would involve avoiding environmental noise, and traumatic noise such as rock concerts and nightclubs with loud music. Use of noise attenuation measures like ear plugs is an alternative, as well as learning about the noise levels one is exposed to. Currently, several accurate sound level measurement apps exist. Reducing exposure time can also help manage risk from loud exposures.
==Treatment==
Treatment modalities fall into three categories: pharmacological, surgical, and management. As SNHL is a physiologic degradation and considered permanent, there are as of this time, no approved or recommended treatments.

There have been significant advances in identification of human deafness genes and elucidation of their cellular mechanisms as well as their physiological function in mice. Nevertheless, pharmacological treatment options are very limited and clinically unproven. Such pharmaceutical treatments as are employed are palliative rather than curative, and addressed to the underlying cause if one can be identified, in order to avert progressive damage.

Profound or total hearing loss may be amenable to management by cochlear implants, which stimulate cochlear nerve endings directly. A cochlear implant is surgical implantation of a battery powered electronic medical device in the inner ear. Unlike hearing aids, which make sounds louder, cochlear implants do the work of damaged parts of the inner ear (cochlea) to provide sound signals to the brain. These consist of both internal implanted electrodes and magnets and external components. The quality of sound is different than natural hearing but may enable the recipient to better recognize speech and environmental sounds.
Because of risk and expense, such surgery is reserved for cases of severe and disabling hearing impairment

Management of sensorineural hearing loss involves employing strategies to support existing hearing such as lip-reading, enhanced communication etc. and amplification using hearing aids. Hearing aids are specifically tuned to the individual hearing loss to give maximum benefit.

==Research==

===Pharmaceuticals===
* Antioxidant vitamins – Researchers at the University of Michigan report that a combination of high doses of vitamins A, C, and E, and Magnesium, taken one hour before noise exposure and continued as a once-daily treatment for five days, was very effective at preventing permanent noise-induced hearing loss in animals.
* Tanakan – a brand name for an international prescription drug extract of Ginkgo biloba. It is classified as a vasodilator. Among its research uses is treatment of sensorineural deafness and tinnitus presumed to be of vascular origin.
* Coenzyme Q10 – a substance similar to a vitamin, with antioxidant properties. It is made in the body, but levels fall with age.
* Ebselen, a synthetic drug molecule that mimics glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a critical enzyme in the inner ear that protects it from damage caused by loud sounds or noise 

===Stem cell and gene therapy===
Hair cell regeneration using stem cell and gene therapy is years or decades away from being clinically feasible. However, studies are currently underway on the subject, with the first FDA-approved trial beginning in February 2012.

==Sudden sensorineural hearing loss==
Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL or SSNHL), commonly known as sudden deafness, occurs as an unexplained, rapid loss of hearing—usually in one ear—either at once or over several days. Nine out of ten people with SSHL lose hearing in only one ear. It should be considered a medical emergency. Delaying diagnosis and treatment may render treatment less effective or ineffective.

Experts estimate that SSHL strikes one person per 100 every year, typically adults in their 40s and 50s. The actual number of new cases of SSHL each year could be much higher because the condition often goes undiagnosed.

===Presentation===
Many people notice that they have SSHL when they wake up in the morning. Others first notice it when they try to use the deafened ear, such as when they use a phone. Still others notice a loud, alarming &quot;pop&quot; just before their hearing disappears. People with sudden deafness often become dizzy, have ringing in their ears (tinnitus), or both.

===Diagnosis===
SSHL is diagnosed via pure tone audiometry. If the test shows a loss of at least 30 dB in three adjacent frequencies, the hearing loss is diagnosed as SSHL. For example, a hearing loss of 30 dB would make conversational speech sound more like a whisper.

===Causes===
Only 10 to 15 percent of the cases diagnosed as SSHL have an identifiable cause. Most cases are classified as idiopathic, also called sudden idiopathic hearing loss (SIHL) and idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL or ISSNHL) The majority of evidence points to some type of inflammation in the inner ear as the most common cause of SSNHL.
* Infection is believed to be the most common cause of SSNHL, accounting for approximately 13% of cases. Viruses that have been associated with SSNHL include cytomegalovirus, rubella, measles, mumps, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and West Nile virus. Patients with COVID-19 may also be at increased risk for developing SSNHL.
* Vascular ischemia of the inner ear or cranial nerve VIII (CN8)
* Perilymph fistula, usually due to a rupture of the round or oval windows and the leakage of perilymph. The patient will usually also experience vertigo or imbalance. A history of trauma is usually present and changes to hearing or vertigo occur with alteration in intracranial pressure such as with straining; lifting, blowing etc.
* Autoimmune – can be due to an autoimmune illness such as systemic lupus erythematosus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis

===Treatment===
Hearing loss completely recovers in around 35–39% of patients with SSNHL, usually within one to two weeks from onset. Steroid treatment within seven days, a lower initial severity of hearing loss, the absence of vertigo, younger patient age, and a history of cardiovascular disease are all associated with complete hearing recovery. Eighty-five percent of those who receive treatment from an otolaryngologist (sometimes called an ENT surgeon) will recover some of their hearing.
* vitamins and antioxidants
* vasodilators
* betahistine (Betaserc), an anti-vertigo drug
* hyperbaric oxygen
* rheologic agents that reduce blood viscosity (such as hydroxyethyl starch, dextran and pentoxifylline)
* anti-inflammatory agents, primarily oral corticosteroids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone)
* Intratympanic administration – Gel formulations are under investigation to provide more consistent drug delivery to the inner ear. Local drug delivery can be accomplished through intratympanic administration, a minimally invasive procedure where the ear drum is anesthetized and a drug is administered into the middle ear. From the middle ear, a drug can diffuse across the round window membrane into the inner ear. Intratympanic administration of steroids may be effective for sudden sensorineural hearing loss for some patients, but high quality clinical data has not been generated. Intratympanic administration of an anti-apoptotic peptide (JNK inhibitor) is currently being evaluated in late-stage clinical development.

=== Epidemiology ===
General hearing loss affects close to 10% of the global population. In the United States alone, it is expected that 13.5 million Americans have sensorineural hearing loss. Of those with sensorineural hearing loss, approximately 50% are congenitally related. The other 50% are due to maternal or fetal infections, post-natal infections, viral infections due to rubella or cytomegalovirus, ototoxic drugs, exposure to loud sounds, severe head trauma, and premature births 

Of the genetically related sensorineural hearing loss cases, 75% are autosomal recessive, 15-20% autosomal dominant, and 1-3% sex-linked. While the specific gene and protein is still unknown, mutations in the connexin 26 gene near the DFNB1 locus of chromosome 13 are thought to account for most of the autosomal recessive genetic-related sensorineural hearing loss 

At least 8.5 per 1000 children younger than age 18 have sensorineural hearing loss. General hearing loss is proportionally related to age. At least 314 per 1000 people older than age 65 have hearing loss. Several risk factors for sensorineural hearing loss have been studied over the past decade. Osteoporosis, stapedectomy surgery, pneumococcal vaccinations, mobile phone users, and hyperbilirubinemia at birth are among some of the known risk factors.

<text>Taarab is a music genre popular in both Tanzania and Kenya. It has been influenced by the musical traditions of the African Great Lakes, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Taarab rose to prominence in 1928 with the advent of the genre&#x27;s first star, Siti binti Saad.

According to local legend, taarab was popularized by Sultan Seyyid Barghash bin Said (1870-1888). He enjoyed luxury and the pleasures of life. It was this ruler who initiated taarab in Zanzibar; and later it spread all over the African Great Lakes region. The sultan imported a tarab ensemble from Egypt to play in his Beit el-Ajab palace. He subsequently decided to send Mohamed Ibrahim from Zanzibar to Egypt to learn music and to play the kanun, a string instrument similar to the zither. Upon his return, he formed the Zanzibar Taarab Orchestra. In 1905, Zanzibar&#x27;s second music society, Ikwhani Safaa Musical Club, was established, which continues to thrive in the 21st century. Ikwhani Safaa and Culture Musical Club, were founded in 1958, have been the leading Zanzibar taarab orchestras.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;taarab&quot; is a loanword from Arabic. The Arabic word means &quot;having pleasure, delight with music&quot;.

== History of taarab music ==
After the spreading of taarab from the Sultan&#x27;s palace to Zanzibari weddings and other community events, the first famous female singer of &quot;taarab&quot; was Siti bint Saad. In 1928, she and her band became the first from the region to make commercial recordings as the first East African to be recorded in the Bombay HMV studios. She would go on to become one of the most famous taarab musicians of all time.

Over the next several decades, bands and musicians like Bi Kidude, Mzee Yusuph, Culture Musical Club and Al-Watan Musical Club kept &quot;taarab&quot; at the forefront of the Tanzanian scene, and made inroads across the world. Playing in a similar style, smaller Kidumbak ensembles grew popular, at least among the poor of Zanzibar, featuring two small drums, bass, violins and dancers using claves and maracas. The 1960s saw a group called the Black Star Musical Club from Tanga modernize the genre, bringing it to audiences farther afield, especially Burundi and Kenya. More recently, modern taarab bands like East African Melody have emerged, as have related backbiting songs for women, called mipasho.

Taarab music is a fusion of Swahili poetry sung in rhythmic poetic style, performed by male or female singers and taarab ensembles comprising numerous musicians. Taarab forms a part of the social life of the Swahili people along the coastal areas, especially in Zanzibar, Tanga and even further in Mombasa and Malindi along the Kenya coast. Wherever the Swahili-speaking people travelled, Taraab moved with them. It has penetrated as far inland as Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi in East Africa, where taarab groups compete in popularity with other kinds of popular musical groups.

Nowadays a taarab revolution is taking place and much debate continues about the music which has been changed by the East African &quot;Melody&quot; phenomenon. Melody, as they are known by their mostly female fans, play modern taarab, which is &#x27;taarab to dance to&#x27; and features direct lyrics, bypassing the lyrical subtlety of the older songs, where the meaning of the lyrics is only alluded to, and never directly inferred. Today, taarab songs may be explicit – sometimes even graphic – in sexual connotation, and much of the music of groups like &quot;Melody&quot; and &quot;Muungano&quot; is composed and played on keyboards, increasing portability for different venues. Also, the groups are much smaller in number than traditional taarab orchestras and therefore more readily available to tour and play shows throughout the region and beyond.

<doc id="1187492" wikidata="Q1140226" url="?curid=1187492" title="Via Devana">
<text>Via Devana is the name given to a Roman Road in England that ran from Colchester in the south-east, through Cambridge in the interior, and on to Chester in the north-west. These were important Roman military centres and it is conjectured that the main reason the road was constructed was military rather than civilian. The Latin name for Chester is &quot;Deva&quot; and &#x27;Via Devana&#x27; is thus &#x27;The Chester Road&#x27;. Colchester was &quot;Colonia Victricensis&quot;, &#x27;the City of Victory&#x27;, and lays claim to be the oldest Roman city in Britain. The Via Devana had little civilian rationale and the road eventually fell into disuse as it was not possible to maintain extensive public works following withdrawal of the last Roman legion from Britain in 407. As a result, its route is difficult to find today, especially in its more northern reaches. It is omitted from some historians&#x27; maps for this reason but most nowadays accept its existence. The undocumented name &quot;Via Devana&quot; was coined by Charles Mason, D.D., of Trinity College, Cambridge, who was also rector of Orwell, Cambridgeshire, and Woodwardian Professor of Fossils at Cambridge University from 1734. During his life, Mason compiled a complete map of Cambridgeshire which was later published in 1808, long after his death.

==Route==
Its route ran north and west as follows:

* Colchester - &quot;Colonia Victricensis&quot;
* Wixoe (conjectured) - (possible fort)
* Cambridge - (Latin name: &quot;Cantabrigia&quot;. Roman Name: &quot;Durolipons&quot; or &quot;Duroliponte&quot;), now the main road through Cambridge from the station to Madgalene Bridge 
* Huntingdon / Godmanchester (&quot;Durolipus&quot; or &quot;Durovigutum&quot;) where it crossed Ermine Street
* Corby
* Medbourne - The stretch from Medbourne to Leicester is broken, but where it exists is nowadays known as the &quot;Gartree Road&quot; and &quot;Evington Footway&quot;
* Leicester- (&quot;Ratae Corieltauvorum&quot;), meeting Fosse Way
:There is speculation that finds in Moira indicates the Mason&#x27;s route, reported in 1831, may have some factual basis.
* Mancetter (&quot;Manduessedum&quot;) where it joined Watling Street until
* Water Eaton - (&quot;Pennocrucium&quot;) to
* Newport, Shropshire - (&quot;Plesc&quot; which meant fortified place or one with palisade) it is here that it followed the same route as the A41 towards
* Whitchurch, Shropshire - (&quot;Mediolan&quot; or &quot;Mediolanum&quot;)
* Chester

<text>Mikołaj &quot;Bearpaw&quot; Potocki (; 1595 – 20 November 1651) was a Polish nobleman, magnate and Field Crown Hetman of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from 1637 to 1646, Grand Hetman of the Crown from 1646 to 1651, governor of Bracław Voivodeship from 1636 and from 1646 Castellan of Kraków.

He was captured during the battle of Cecora by the Turks. In 1633 during the Battle of Paniowce, along with Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki and Stanisław Koniecpolski he defeated the Turk forces under Abaza Pasha.

In the 1637 Pavlyuk Uprising he defeated Cossacks under Pavlo Pavliuk at the battle of Kumejki. In the 1638 Ostryanyn Uprising he forced Dmytro Hunia to surrender. After those victories over the Cossacks he received large estates in Ukraine.

The 1637–38 Cossack rebellions suppressed by Potocki were minutely described by historian and bishop Szymon Okolski who witnessed and directly participated in the developments of those days. His field diaries became a valuable information source for historians.

During the Sejm of 1646 Potocki opposed the plan of the king Władysław IV Vasa to wage war against the Turks.

He was known as very oppressive to peasantry and Cossacks. His behavior was one of the causes of the Khmelnytsky Uprising. In 1648 he disregarded the monarch&#x27;s orders and attacked rebellious Cossacks in Ukraine. He was defeated at the Battle of Korsuń and captured by Tatars. In April 1650 he was released from jasyr. On 28–30 June 1651 he was victorious over Tatar and Cossack forces at the Battle of Berestechko.

On 18 September 1651, after the indecisive Battle of Bila Tserkva he negotiated a treaty with the Cossacks.

== Personal life ==
Potocki had two wives, Zofia Firlej and Elżbieta Kazanowska. He had six children with Firlej: Piotr Potocki, Stefan Potocki, Mikołaj Potocki, Marianna Potocka, Wiktoria Potocka and Henryk Potocki. With Kazanowska he had three children: Jakub Potocki, Joanna Potocka and Dominik Potocki.

Nair completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mechanical engineering from McGill University in Montreal in 1973. From 1974, he worked in Singapore&#x27;s Housing and Development Board. And in 1979, he joined the Administrative Service, working in the Ministry of Finance. During his time in the finance ministry, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in public administration from Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University in the United States.

In 1986, Nair rose to the post of Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Trade and Industry where he was involved in the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations, as well as with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). From 1989 to 1997, Nair was Singapore&#x27;s Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Defence. In 1997, he left the civil service to become the CEO of the Post Office Savings Bank of Singapore; the bank was acquired in 1998 by the Development Bank of Singapore and Nair stayed on as DBS&#x27;s Managing Director.

Nair was appointed to a five-year term as United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services on 24 April 2000, succeeding Karl Paschke in that position. In 2000, he wanted to determine vulnerability of the United Nations&#x27; Oil-for-Food Programme for Iraq. Benon Sevan, the head of the programme, along with UN Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, rejected any such investigation, claiming that it would be too expensive to be worthwhile.

In 2004, Nair was investigated for unspecified internal accusations of graft and sexual harassment against female staff. Nair relinquished his post upon expiration of his five-year contract and returned to his native Singapore on 23 April 2005. Subsequently, in May 2006, Secretary General Kofi Annan sent a letter to Nair clearing him again of all the allegations from the staff union and expressed regret at the extended period of unnecessary and unmerited public innuendo that Nair had been subjected to.

He was appointed the Singapore Consul General in the emirate of Dubai in August 2005 and served there for 6 years. In June 2011, Nair was appointed as the Singapore Ambassador to Laos and was posted in Vientiane. After completing his term in 2013, Nair was appointed as Singapore&#x27;s High Commissioner to Ghana, residing in Singapore. Nair completed his term in 2017. Nair is currently an Independent Director on three public listed companies in Singapore: Keppel Data Centre REIT, Thakral Corporation, and Singapore Reinsurance. Nair is also on the board of the Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority of Singapore and the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore.

<text>The Mini Moke is a small, front-wheel-drive utility and recreational convertible, conceived and manufactured as a lightweight military vehicle by British Motor Corporation (BMC), and subsequently marketed for civilian use under the Austin, Morris, Leyland, and Moke brands. The name &quot;Mini Moke&quot; combines &quot;mini&quot; with &quot;moke&quot;, an archaic term for a mule. The Moke is known for its simple, straightforward, doorless design; and for its adaptability.

BMC&#x27;s Cowley plant started building Mokes in January 1964, with 14,518 produced in the UK between 1964 and 1968; 26,000 were manufactured in Australia between 1966 and 1981; and 10,000 in Portugal between 1980 and 1993 when, after a nearly 30-year run, production ended.

In 2013, in a joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, Chinese automaker Chery Automobile started production in China of a new car called Moke. This evocation of the design is assembled and distributed by a number of companies in several countries including England, France, and the US, although ownership of the Moke trademark is disputed.

==History==
The original Moke was designed by Sir Alec Issigonis and John Sheppard. When Issigonis designed the Mini, he planned another vehicle to share the Mini&#x27;s mechanical parts, but with a more rugged body shell. This was an attempt to take a portion of the military vehicle business from Land Rover. Issigonis had previously designed the Nuffield Guppy in a failed attempt to break into that market. By 1959, BMC had working prototypes of what was codenamed &quot;The Buckboard&quot;, later to become the Mini Moke. These prototypes were shown to the British Army as a parachute-droppable vehicle, but poor ground clearance and a low-powered engine did not meet the most basic requirements for an off-road vehicle. Only the Royal Navy showed any interest in the Buckboard, as a vehicle for use on the decks of aircraft carriers.

Early promotional material made much of the lightness of the vehicle, showing four soldiers travelling in the Moke off-road, then picking it up by its tubular bumpers and carrying it when (inevitably) its low ground-clearance proved inadequate.

In a further attempt to make a viable military vehicle, a few four-wheel drive Mokes were made. This was accomplished by the addition of a second engine and transmission at the back of the vehicle with linked clutches and gear shifters, which did nothing for the ground-clearance problems. This vehicle was called &quot;The Twini&quot; and was shown to the US Army—again with no success. The added mechanical complexity and lack of interest by the military discouraged development beyond the prototype stage.

Three of these vehicles were used by the Brazilian Army after being captured during the 1969 Rupununi Rebellion from Guyanese rebels, who had crossed the border into Brazil.

During the Rhodesian Bush War there was an attempt by the Rhodesian Security Forces to create an &quot;Armoured Moke&quot; as an improvised fighting vehicle, which was seemingly unsuccessful.

Originally prototyped using the engine, transmission and suspension parts from the Mini Van, the design&#x27;s small wheels and low ground clearance made it unsuitable as an off-road military vehicle. The design was subsequently adapted and sold globally for general use as a low-cost, easily maintained, lightweight recreational and utility vehicle.

===British Mokes===
When BMC gave up on the idea of selling the Moke to the military, in 1963 they marketed it as a civilian vehicle, targeting farmers and light commercial applications. Several prototypes were built in 1963, one of which is still known to exist in Pinner just outside London, England. The Moke was launched onto the British market in 1964. The British Customs and Excise department decided that the Moke should be classified as a passenger car rather than as a commercial vehicle, which meant that it attracted purchase tax, reducing sales in its intended commercial market.

British-made Mokes were fitted with a low-end 848 cc transverse inline-four engine, detuned to use low-octane fuel. They used the same suspension, gearbox and 10 inch wheels as the standard Mini. Originally, passenger seats, grab handles, heater, windscreen washer and a removable canvas top were optional equipment, installed by the owner. The base price was £ 405. The &quot;Mk I&quot; Mokes had a single windscreen wiper and a floor-mounted headlight dip switch, and the only colour available was &quot;Spruce Green&quot;. In 1967, the &quot;Mk II&quot; Moke added a passenger-side wiper. Horn and headlight controls were moved onto the indicator stalk. These later British Mokes were also available in white.

The John Player &amp; Sons cigarette company ran a team of Mokes in autocross competitions on grass tracks through 1968. These vehicles were equipped with rollover protection and used the Mini Cooper S 1275 cc engine.

Despite the lack of success in selling the Mini Moke to the British Armed Forces, an unknown number (unlikely to have been more than a handful) of examples were apparently used by Land Forces Falkland Islands during the Falklands War and its immediate aftermath; the source of these vehicles is unclear. At least one commandeered civilian Mini Moke was also used by the Argentinian Forces during their occupation of the islands.

The original Moke was made in Britain until 1968.

===Australian Mokes===
Starting in 1966 the Moke was built in Australia where it was originally marketed as the Morris Mini Moke, and from 1973 as the Leyland Moke. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. There was also a widening piece welded to the wheel arches, front and rear to allow for wider tyres and rims. The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed &quot;deck-chair&quot; seats. This variant started with a 998 cc engine, which was switched mid-production to 1,098 cc. In 1976, with the advent of new anti-pollution requirements (Australian Design Rule 27A), the locally manufactured 1,098 cc motor was replaced by an imported version of the 998 cc motor with an air pump and exhaust gas recirculation, which had been developed to meet UK (US?) anti-pollution requirements.

For a brief period around 1971, Leyland Australia produced a variant referred to in Leyland literature as &quot;Moke, special export&quot;, but commonly called a &quot;Californian&quot;, which had a 1,275 cc engine and was fitted with side marker lamps and different rear lights to conform to US FMVSS standards. The fuel tank from the Austin Sprite or MG Midget was fitted beneath the rear load area, replacing the standard tank mounted in the left sidebox. The export Californian was readily recognisable by its roof and seats, trimmed in &quot;Op-pop verve&quot; black and white tiger-striped vinyl or &quot;Orange Bali&quot; vinyl, which looked rather like a fruit salad,&lt;ref name=&quot;Special Export Moke/&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; and was briefly marketed to the &quot;flower power&quot; culture in the United States.
The name &quot;Californian&quot; and the 1275 cc motor were resurrected in 1977 for Australian market Mokes with denim seat covers, more comfortable seats (which concealed the same basic frame within), spoked wheels and complex tubular bumpers (known as &quot;roo bars&quot;).

Australian Mokes were exported to many countries and pioneered large-scale exports of Australian-made vehicles. Leyland Australia made much of these exports in its advertising. The use of Australian-made Mokes by the Israeli Army (complete with a machine-gun tripod mounted in the rear) attracted controversy and media attention.

From 1975, a pickup version of the Moke was produced, with a 1.45 x 1.50 metre (55 x 59 in) drop-sided bed which protruded behind the back of the vehicle, and a cloth top over the cab area.

At least two four-wheel drive Moke prototypes were manufactured by Leyland Australia in the late 1970s, but unlike the British version, these used just one engine. Leyland were planning to market this version, but Moke production in Australia ended in 1981 and all that remains of the project is one of the prototypes which is now owned by an enthusiast in Western Australia and a modified differential crownwheel with gearteeth cut in the side to drive the rear tailshaft, in the personal collection of a Melbourne Mini specialist.

In 1977 a 1275 cc Cooper S-engined Moke (sponsored by Coca-Cola) was entered into the Singapore Airlines London-Sydney Marathon. The car was driven over over 30 days and finished in 35th place.

Australian production of the Moke ended in 1981.
===Portuguese Mokes===
As Australian Moke production wound down, manufacturing was transferred to British Leyland&#x27;s subsidiary in Portugal, which made 8,500 of the &quot;Californian&quot; Mokes in the Setúbal IMA plant between 1980 and 1984. In 1984 production was transferred to the Vendas Novas plant. Initially these Mokes were identical to late-model Australian Mokes; very soon, however, they were altered to use then-current British production Mini saloon components, including the standard-length Mini rear trailing arms and the 12–in wheels with modern low-profile tyres, which the saloon had acquired during the Moke&#x27;s absence from Europe.

In April 1990, British Leyland (by then called Rover Group) sold the &quot;Moke&quot; name to Cagiva, a motorcycle manufacturer in Bologna, Italy. Production continued in Portugal under Cagiva&#x27;s auspices until 1993, when Cagiva transferred the tooling to their own factory in Varese, Italy with the intention of restarting production there in 1995 — which they never did, although some unfinished cars were assembled in Italy. Cagiva was made to pay a considerably higher price for the Rover-made parts than had BL&#x27;s Portuguese subsidiary, and the enterprise never made financial sense. The Cagiva-built Mokes have a new top with C-shaped openings, as well as plastic curve handles at the rear longitudinal elements of the rollover bar. Since Cagiva did not own the &quot;Mini&quot; name, the 2071 cars they built were sold simply as &quot;Mokes&quot;. This brought the total production run of Mokes and Moke derivatives to about 50,000.

===MOKE International===

In 2012 MOKE International teamed up with designer Michael Young, Chery Automobile, and Sicar Engineering to design a new version of the Moke, styled MOKE, with the intention of releasing the car in Thailand, Australia, the Caribbean, the Seychelles and Mauritius, and Egypt by 2016. In 2013, Chery Automobile began manufacturing the reimagined Moke in China. The 2020 MOKE has a 1,083 cc four-cylinder fuel injected petrol engine with either manual or automatic transmission and was also made in France. An electric version based on this design has been manufactured in Britain since 2021. The Moke brand was acquired by EV Technology Group in 2022.

==Construction and maintenance==

The Moke&#x27;s construction is simple. The body mainly consists of two box-section &quot;pontoons&quot; or &quot;sideboxes&quot; running between the front and rear wheels and includes solid extensions running from the back of the car to the front. These are connected by the floor pan, the firewall and a sturdy lateral torque box that runs under the front seats and stiffens the body in torsion. The left-hand pontoon contains the fuel tank; the right-hand has a compartment for the battery and a small lockable storage area. The 1972 &quot;Moke, Special Export&quot;, commonly referred to as a &quot;Californian&quot; Moke, has an Austin Sprite/MG Midget type fuel tank fitted beneath the rear floor area to meet the American FMVSS safety requirements of the time. Standard Mokes of the same period and later Californian Mokes use the conventional tank mounted in the left sidebox. Later Portuguese Mokes have additional lockable storage space at the rear of the vehicle. The optional cloth canopy has plastic side windows and is held up by a thin tubular structure that can easily be removed when not needed. In later versions this was replaced with a more solid roll cage. The windscreen can easily be unbolted and removed if not needed. There are just three curved panels in the Moke, the bonnet, the firewall and the floor, each of which is only curved in one direction. This makes it relatively straightforward to reproduce and replace Moke body components without access to sophisticated machine tools.

Because the Moke&#x27;s A-Series engine, manual gearbox and suspension are identical to those of a standard Mini (which was still in production up to October 2000), most spare parts are still readily available. The Moke has no chassis, so the wheels, brake assemblies and suspension are attached to front and rear subframes bolted straight onto the monocoque shell, just as with a standard Mini. Mokes tend to require much structural maintenance if they are to stay in good running order.

==Kit cars, look-alikes, and customisations==
The true Mini Moke was never available as a kit car, however as the basic Mini parts were easily available, many companies have assembled and marketed look-alikes, hybrid copies, and custom versions of the vehicle with names such as the Andersen &quot;Mini-Cub&quot;, &quot;Comet&quot;, Del Tech &quot;Nomad&quot;, &quot;Gecko&quot;, &quot;Hobo&quot;, &quot;Hustler&quot;, &quot;Jimini&quot;, &quot;Mini-Scout&quot;, &quot;MPV&quot; (a 6-wheeler), &quot;Mule&quot;, &quot;Navajo&quot;, &quot;Ranger&quot;, &quot;Mini Scamp&quot;, &quot;Stimson&quot;, &quot;Warrior&quot;, and the &quot;Yak&quot;. Unusual one-off custom versions of the Mini Moke have also been created inspired by the original design, including a 454 hp Maserati V-8 powered example built by , and a three axle six-wheeler.

===Island Mokes===
The Moke gained much popularity as a beach buggy and was often rented to tourists in tropical island resorts such as Mauritius and Barbados.

The car also found a market in Macau, where it became the official transport for the local police; the Happy-Rent-a-Car company also owned 43 of the vehicles, which were made available for hire until February 2006 when they were outlawed by new car safety laws. The Macau branch of the car rental company Avis ran a fleet of Moke look-alike &quot;CUBs&quot; until July 2007. The CUB, although it resembled the Moke, was designed by Charles Andersen of Liverpool, England and used a 1275 cc version of the A-Series engine.

On Magnetic Island, off Australia&#x27;s Queensland coast, &quot;Moke Magnetic&quot; still operate a large fleet of Australian-made Mokes for hire to tourists.

The Mini Moke can still be seen around the town of Victoria, Seychelles, as it is still a popular mode of transport for tourists and can seat four people in relative comfort.

In the early 1970s, a Mini Moke was the first motor vehicle to be driven on Pitcairn Island and thereby became the most remote vehicle on Earth. It was chosen because it was the only off-road vehicle that could be lifted by the island&#x27;s only crane—there being no dock or airstrip at Pitcairn. However, the rough terrain and heavy rainfall proved too much for the Moke and it soon broke down. Eventually, a second and later a third Moke were sent to the island, and by cannibalising the three for spares, the island&#x27;s sole vehicle remained running until at least 1988.

===Railway Mokes===

The Moke was identified as an ideal conversion for use in railway service.

Two differing modifications were made: one using backing plates and spacers, the other a more conventional road-rail system.

Tasmanian Government Railways ran a fleet, estimated at 16, of hard-topped Mokes for inspection and maintenance service on its narrow-gauge network. These Mokes had slightly modified suspension, and used spacers and backing plates so that the wheels sat on and tracked on gauge track. Similarly, the Federal Government, through either its Commonwealth Railways or Australian National Railways Commission, ran at least two similarly set up Mokes on its Central Australia Railway. At least one of these Mokes also operated on the isolated Eyre Peninsula network.

George E Moss and Co (trading as GEMCO) developed a road-rail system based on a Western Australian Government Railways design which was fitted to at least two Mokes: one used by the District Engineer, Perth, and the other by the District Engineer, Northam.

=== Electric Mokes===

In 1981, Melbourne engineering firm Johns Perry developed the &quot;Electromoke&quot;, as part of a Victorian State Government trial investigating energy conservation. Four Leyland Mokes were produced without engines or wipers, and then fitted with elevator motors and car batteries. The rear suspension had to be upgraded due to the battery weight. The vehicles were tested by Australia Post, the State Electricity Commission of Victoria and the Electricity Commission of New South Wales. A change of government, high cost, poor performance, and the demise of the Leyland factory meant the project went no further. The one remaining Electromoke is on static display at the Museum of Vehicle Evolution, Shepparton.
A new design inspired by the Mini Moke was developed by Chery subsidiary Sicar Engineering and MOKE International in around 2007. This Chinese-manufactured design is assembled and distributed by various small companies in France, England, and United States.

==Future Mokes==
While BMW-owned Mini has discussed other vehicles named after the Moke, no production has ever taken place. A concept car called the MINI Beachcomber, which draws heavily on Moke styling, was used to build interest for the upcoming Mini Countryman.

==In popular culture==

The Moke attracted attention via media exposure, including the 1965 John Boorman film &quot;Catch Us If You Can&quot; (in which a Moke is driven by the Dave Clark Five), many appearances in the television series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; starring Patrick McGoohan (1967–68), as well as in popular songs such as the English rock group Traffic&#x27;s recording of &quot;Berkshire Poppies&quot;. The Moke also features in four James Bond movies: &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;, &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;, and &quot;Moonraker&quot;, as well as the films &quot;Emmanuelle&quot;, &quot;Carry on Camping&quot; and the Doctor Who story &quot;Fury from the Deep.&quot; In total, the Moke has made cameo appearances in over 70 films. The Beatles and the Beach Boys were also photographed behind the wheel of a Moke. Despite these cultural references and celebrity associations, only about a tenth of the 14,500 British produced Mokes were sold in the United Kingdom, although Mokes continued to be made in Britain until 1968.

The Moke met with renewed success in the 1980s after French actress and model Brigitte Bardot was pictured driving a Moke with her dogs in St. Tropez, France.

In 1982 the Seychelles issued a commemorative &quot;Transportation&quot; postage stamp featuring the Mini Moke. 

In 2016 the Moke was included in an exhibition titled &quot;AL(L) Projects with Aluminum&quot;, curated by Maria Cristina Didero at the Grand-Hornu in Belgium. The show explored experimentation with aluminium in art, design, and industry.

A &quot;Panorama Mokes&quot; event was held In October 2016 which brought together a group of Mini Mokes alongside their &quot;tin top&quot; cousins the &quot;Classic Minis&quot; which met at Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. Alongside the Minis, the MOKE also celebrated 50 years since production in Australia and participated in a four-day event with everyone arriving on cue to the 2016 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.

In 2021 the Moke that featured in &quot;The Prisoner&quot; sold at auction for £69,750. The last petrol powered Moke revival was sold at the Blenheim Palace Ball auction in 2022. The proceeds of the event were donated to the charity Starlight UK.

In 2024, a red Mini Moke is seen being driven by the principle character Mackenzie Clarke (played by Anna Samson) in the series Return to Paradise.

<doc id="1187515" wikidata="Q119716" url="?curid=1187515" title="Geography of Europe">
<text>Europe is traditionally defined as one of seven continents. Physiographically, it is the northwestern peninsula of the larger landmass known as Eurasia (or the larger Afro-Eurasia); Asia occupies the centre and east of this continuous landmass. Europe&#x27;s eastern frontier is usually delineated by the Ural Mountains in Russia, which is the largest country by land area in the continent. The southeast boundary with Asia is not universally defined, but the modern definition is generally the Ural River or, less commonly, the Emba River. The boundary continues to the Caspian Sea, the crest of the Caucasus Mountains (or, less commonly, the river Kura in the Caucasus), and on to the Black Sea. The Bosporus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles conclude the Asian boundary. The Mediterranean Sea to the south separates Europe from Africa. The western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean. Iceland is usually included in Europe because it is over twice as close to mainland Europe as mainland North America. There is ongoing debate on where the geographical centre of Europe falls.

==Overview==


Some geographical texts refer to a Eurasian continent given that Europe is not surrounded by sea and its southeastern border has always been variously defined for centuries.

In terms of shape, Europe is a collection of connected peninsulas and nearby islands. The two largest peninsulas are Europe itself and Scandinavia to the north, divided from each other by the Baltic Sea. Three smaller peninsulas—Iberia, Italy, and the Balkans—emerge from the southern margin of the mainland. The Balkan peninsula is separated from Asia by the Black and Aegean Seas. Italy is separated from the Balkans by the Adriatic Sea, and from Iberia by the Mediterranean Sea, which also separates Europe from Africa. Eastward, mainland Europe widens much like the mouth of a funnel, until the boundary with Asia is reached at the Ural Mountains and Ural River, the Caspian Sea, and the Caucasus Mountains.

Land relief in Europe shows great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are mountainous while moving north the terrain descends from the high Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians, through hilly uplands, into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. An arc of uplands also exists along the northwestern seaboard, beginning in southwestern Ireland, continuing across through western and northern Great Britain, and up along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine of Norway.

This description is simplified. Sub-regions such as Iberia and Italy contain their own complex features, as does mainland Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys, and basins that complicate the general trend. Iceland and the British Isles are special cases. The former is of North Atlantic volcanic formation, while the latter consist of upland areas once joined to the mainland until cut off by rising sea levels.

===Peninsula of peninsulas===
Europe is sometimes called a &quot;peninsula of peninsulas&quot;, to draw attention to the fact that Europe is a relatively small, elongated appendage to Asia, and that a large part of Europe is made up of peninsulas. A prehistoric perspective would include Britain and Ireland as the core of a further very significant European peninsula prior to the post-glacial rise in sea-levels.

** Istria
** Gallipoli
* Brittany
* Cotentin Peninsula
* Crimea
* Fennoscandian Peninsula
** Kola Peninsula
** Scandinavian Peninsula
* Iberian Peninsula
* Italian Peninsula
* Jutland
* Kanin Peninsula

== Geology ==
Europe&#x27;s most significant geological feature is the dichotomy between the highlands and mountains of Southern Europe and a vast, partially underwater, northern plain ranging from Great Britain in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the Pyrenees and the Alps/Carpathians. The northern plains are delimited in the west by the Scandinavian Mountains and the mountainous parts of the British Isles. The major shallow water bodies submerging parts of the northern plains are the Celtic Sea, the North Sea, the Baltic Sea complex, and the Barents Sea.

The northern plain contains the old geological continent of Baltica, and so may be regarded as the &quot;main continent&quot;, while peripheral highlands and mountainous regions in south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents.

The geology of Europe is hugely varied and complex, and gives rise to the wide variety of landscapes found across the continent, from the Scottish Highlands to the rolling plains of Hungary.

== Population ==
Throughout history, the population of Europe has been affected by migration into and out of the continent, disease and conflict. Figures for the population of Europe vary according to which definition of European boundaries is used. The population within the standard physical geographical boundaries was 701 million in 2005 according to the United Nations. In 2000 the population was 857 million, using a definition which includes the whole of the transcontinental countries of Russia and Turkey. Population growth is comparatively slow, and median age comparatively high in relation to the world&#x27;s other continents.

== Rivers ==


The most important rivers in Europe are Danube, Volga, Rhine, Elbe, Oder and Dnieper, among others.

Land area in different classes of European mountainous terrain (classification from UNEP-WCMC):

==Temperature and precipitation==

The high mountainous areas of Europe are colder and have higher precipitation than lower areas, as is true of mountainous areas in general. Europe has less precipitation in the east than in central and western Europe. The temperature difference between summer and winter gradually increases from coastal northwest Europe to southeast inland Europe, ranging from Ireland, with a temperature difference of only 10 °C from the warmest to the coldest month, to the area north of the Caspian Sea, with a temperature difference of 40 °C. January average range from 13 °C in southern Spain and southern Greek islands to -20 °C in the northeastern part of European Russia. Desert climates are found in the European portion of Kazakhstan and South Eastern Spain.

Western Europe and parts of Central Europe generally fall into the temperate maritime climate (Cfb), the southern part is mostly a Mediterranean climate (mostly Csa, smaller area with Csb), the north-central part and east into central Russia is mostly a humid continental climate (Dfb) and the northern part of the continent is a subarctic climate (Dfc). In the extreme northern part (northernmost Russia; Svalbard), bordering the Arctic Ocean, is tundra climate (Et). Mountain ranges, such as the Alps and the Carpathian mountains, have a highland climate with large variations according to altitude and latitude.

==Climate==

Europe&#x27;s climate is diverse due to its extensive range from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Mediterranean Sea in the south, and from the Atlantic Ocean in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east. Several climatic zones intersect the continent, influenced by factors such as latitude, proximity to water bodies, elevation, and prevailing wind patterns.

The North Atlantic Drift, a warm ocean current, significantly moderates temperatures across much of Western Europe, resulting in relatively mild winters for regions at similar latitudes elsewhere. This effect is particularly evident in countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, and coastal Norway, which experience oceanic climates characterized by cool summers and mild, wet winters.

Southern Europe enjoys a Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. This climate predominates in countries such as Spain, Italy, and Greece, where seasonal rainfall supports agriculture and tourism. Eastern Europe and parts of the continent&#x27;s interior feature continental climates with more pronounced seasonal temperature differences, including cold winters and warm summers. Precipitation in these regions is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.

Northern Europe, including Scandinavia, is characterized by subarctic and tundra climates, where winters are long and harsh, and summers are short and cool. The Arctic portions of Europe, particularly in Russia and Norway, also experience polar climates. Mountainous regions, such as the Alps and the Carpathians, exhibit alpine climates, with temperature and precipitation patterns that vary with altitude. Higher elevations generally experience cooler temperatures and greater precipitation, often in the form of snow.

Europe&#x27;s climate zones have been further influenced by anthropogenic climate change, leading to rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events across the continent.

==Landlocked countries==

The landlocked countries in Europe are: Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Czech Republic, Hungary, Kosovo, Liechtenstein (which is doubly landlocked), Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Moldova, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Switzerland, Vatican City

Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, and North Macedonia constitute a contiguous landlocked agglomeration of eight countries in Central Europe and the Balkans, stretching from Geneva all the way to Skopje. The other landlocked countries are &quot;standalone&quot; landlocked, not bordering any other such &quot;European&quot; one (the emphasis is necessary, since Kazakhstan borders Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, thus forming a vast landlocked expanse in Central Asia).

==Countries consisting solely of islands or parts of islands==
* Cyprus
* Iceland
* Ireland
* Malta
* United Kingdom

==Countries bordering or spanning another continent==
==Countries whose capital is not the most populous==
&quot;Note&quot;: Italy&#x27;s capital, Rome, is the country&#x27;s largest city if only the municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) is considered. Greater Milan is the largest metropolitan area in Italy.

Brussels is considered to be the largest city of Belgium, according to the population of the Brussels-Capital Region. The population of the City of Brussels is ~175,000. Antwerp is the biggest city of the country.

<text>Adelphopoiesis or adelphopoiia (from the Greek , derived from , , , and , , , literally &#x27;brother-making&#x27;) is a ceremony practiced historically in Eastern Christian tradition to unite together two people of the same sex (normally men) in a church-recognized relationship analogous to siblinghood.

Such ceremonies can be found in the history of the Catholic Church until the 14th century and in the Eastern Orthodox Church until the early 20th century. Documented in Byzantine manuscripts from the ninth to the fifteenth centuries, prayers established participants as &#x27;spiritual brothers&#x27; () and contained references to sainted pairs, including most notably Saints Sergius and Bacchus as well as Saints Cosmas and Damian, who were famous for their friendship.&quot; In England, some scholars believe an adelphopoiesis may have also taken place between William Neville and John Clanvowe.

In the late twentieth century, the Christian tradition gained notoriety as the focus of controversy involving advocates and opponents of secular and religious legalization of same-sex relationships.

==Adelphopoiesis in Christian tradition==

The Russian polymath scholar, priest, and martyr Pavel Florensky offered a famous description of adelphopoiesis in his monumental 1914 book &quot;The Pillar and the Ground of The Truth: An Essay in Orthodox Theodicy in Twelve Letters&quot;, which included an early bibliography on the topic. Florensky described traditional Christian friendship, expressed in adelphopoiesis, as &quot;a community molecule [rather than an atomistic individualism], a pair of friends, which is the principle of actions here, just as the family was this kind of molecule for the pagan community,&quot; reflecting Christ&#x27;s words that &quot;wherever two or more of you are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of thee.&quot; Florensky in his theological exegesis of the rite described an overlap of Christian agapic, philic, and erotic love in adelphopoiesis. He defines &quot;erōs&quot; as &quot;sensuous, passionate love,&quot; &quot;storgē&quot; as &quot;love of kith and kin,&quot; &quot;agapē&quot; as &quot;love of valuation, respect,&quot; and &quot;philia&quot; as &quot;love of inward acceptance, personal insight, friendliness.&quot; He then says, &quot;But in fact, none of these words expresses the love of friendship that we are considering in the present letter, a love that combines the aspects of &quot;philia, erōs,&quot; and &quot;agapē&quot;, a love the ancients attempted to express in some degree by the compound word &quot;philophrosunē&quot;.&quot; Were we to choose but one of these words, he says that &quot;the most suitable word here is &quot;philein&quot; with its derivatives,&quot; such as &quot;philia&quot; (&quot;friendship&quot;) and &quot;philos&quot; (&quot;friend&quot;). Within the Church, Florensky says that such philic relationships &quot;blossom in sacramental adelphopoeisis [&quot;sic&quot;] and the co-partaking of the Holy Eucharist, and are nourished by this partaking for co-ascesis, co-patience, and co-martyrdom.&quot; A similar vocation to co-martyrdom is entailed in the Orthodox rite of marriage, which contains an invocation to the martyrs, who have received their crowns, but the various extant rites of Adelphopoiesis, though in some respects resembling the marriage rite, do not appear to contain any crowning such as takes place in the Orthodox rite of matrimony. Rather the ritual act, apart from co-communing in the Eucharist, that has commonly symbolized the adelphopoietic relationship in Russia, Greece, and other Orthodox countries has been an exchange of baptismal crosses (usually worn throughout life). This exchange has commonly taken place, not in public, but in a private encounter between those entering this philic relationship. Such a private exchange is depicted between Parfen and the prince in chapter 20 of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot;:&quot;You wish to exchange crosses? Very well, Parfen, if that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;m glad enough--that makes us brothers, you know.&quot;

The prince took off his tin cross, Parfen his gold one, and the exchange was made.

Parfen was silent. With sad surprise the prince observed that the look of distrust, the bitter, ironical smile, had still not altogether left his newly-adopted brother&#x27;s face. At moments, at all events, it showed itself but too plainly.The relationship of &quot;Cross-Brotherhood&quot; appearing here in Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Idiot&quot; seems but a sad mockery of the mutually-edifying, faithful, intimate relationship envisioned by Pavel Florensky as blossoming &quot;in sacramental adelphopoeisis&quot; [&quot;sic&quot;]. Florensky cites the relationship between Prince Jonathan and the future king David the Shepherd as an example of the quality of relationship his letter is expounding, citing First Samuel 18:1, 3-4; 20:4, 8, 17 and 41 as his evidence. He writes that David&#x27;s &quot;friendship with Jonathan also rises above the level of the utilitarian friendship of the Old Testament and anticipates the &quot;tragic&quot; friendship of the New.&quot;

Alternative views are that this rite was used in many ways, such as the formation of permanent pacts between leaders of nations or between religious brothers. This was a replacement for &quot;blood-brotherhood&quot; which was forbidden by the church at the time. Others such as Brent Shaw have maintained also that these unions were more akin to &quot;blood-brotherhood&quot; and had no sexual connotation. 

Yet, explicitly contradicting the eros-excluding interpretations of the ritual is the Eastern Orthodox Church&#x27;s own Book of Canon Law, the &quot;Pedalion,&quot; which, as reported by historian Franco Mormando, &quot;acknowledges the frequently erotic nature of the relationship ritualized in the &#x27;brotherhood by adoption&#x27; or &#x27;wedbrotherhood&#x27; ceremony: in prohibiting the ceremony (in its chapter on marriage), the &quot;Pedalion&quot; states that wedbrotherhood &#x27;merely affords matter for some persons to fulfill their carnal desires and to enjoy sensual pleasures, as countless examples of actual experience have shown at various times and in various places...&#x27;&quot;

Rites for &quot;adelphopoiesis&quot; are contained in Byzantine manuscripts dating from the ninth to the 15th century.

==&quot;Same-sex union&quot; or &quot;brother-making&quot;==
The ritual gained popular attention in the West, however, after Yale historian John Boswell in his book &quot;Same-sex unions in pre-modern Europe&quot;, also published as &quot;The marriage of likeness&quot;, argued that the practice was to unite two persons in a marriage-like union. His theory was disputed by other academic experts on the issue, notably historian Claudia Rapp in a special issue of the Catholic scholarly journal &quot;Traditio&quot; (vol. 52) in 1997, as well as Byzantine liturgical historian Stefano Parenti, who identified the origins of problems in Boswell&#x27;s manuscript analysis. Boswell&#x27;s work also was disputed by the religious community today descended most directly from that involved in the original practice, the Greek Orthodox Church, which regarded his work as a modern American cultural appropriation of its tradition, and translates adelphopoiesis as &quot;fraternization,&quot; involving a chaste friendship. A similar translation of the term is &quot;brother-making&quot;.

While many scholars criticized Boswell&#x27;s findings, some agreed with him, including liberal American Episcopalian scholars Robin Scroggs and William L. Countryman. Boswell gave text and translation for a number of versions of the &quot;fraternization&quot; ceremony in Greek, and translation for a number of Slavonic versions (&quot;Bratotvorenie&quot; or &quot;Pobratimstvo&quot;), although Rapp and others disputed the accuracy of his translations. Boswell himself denied that &quot;adelphopoiesis&quot; should be properly translated as &quot;homosexual marriage,&quot; but he argued that &quot;brother-making&quot; or &quot;making of brothers&quot; was an &quot;anachronistically literal&quot; translation and proposed &quot;same-sex union&quot; as the preferable rendering. Boswell&#x27;s preference was problematic to Eastern Orthodox canonists, as well as scholars such as Rapp, who argued that it involved an anachronistically modern secular epistemology and anthropology, different from traditional Christianity. Boswell suggested a potential parallel to modern constructions of sexual identity, although the rites for &quot;adelphopoiesis&quot; explicitly highlighted the spiritual nature of the union in premodern Christian terms.

Some more recent scholarship has investigated Boswell&#x27;s claim along ethnographic lines. Nik Jovčić-Sas in his piece &quot;The Tradition of Homophobia: Responses to Same-Sex relationships in Serbian Orthodoxy from the nineteenth century to the present day&quot; highlights the distinctly sexual and romantic qualities of Pobratimstvo recorded in Serbia from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Looking at the work of anthropologists and ethnographers such as Mary Edith Durham, Paul Näcke, Dinko Tomašić and Tih R. Gregorovitch Jovčić-Sas argues that brotherhood unions were not simply platonic or political unions, as taught by the Serbian Orthodox Church. He also draws attention to the effects of Western European cultural shaming upon Serbian society--a shame resulting in suppression and cultural amnesia regarding the actual praxis and embodiment of Pobratimstvo in earlier same-sex relationships.

==Boswell&#x27;s critics==

Halsall (1996) has produced a detailed list of debates (including reviews by supporters and skeptics) surrounding Boswell&#x27;s works. The following are sourced from some of the more prominent critics.

<text>The Sikorsky Russky Vityaz (), or Russian Knight (S-21), previously known as the Bolshoi Baltisky () &quot;(The Great Baltic)&quot; in its first four-engined version, was the first four-engine aircraft in the world, designed by Igor Sikorsky and built at the Russian Baltic Railroad Car Works (&quot;Russo-Baltiiskyi Vagonnyi Zavod&quot; or &quot;R-BVZ&quot;) in Saint Petersburg in early 1913.

==Development==
Sikorsky conceived the S-21 design in 1911, when no known aircraft could lift more than . The carrying capacity record belonged to the French pilot Ducis, who had flown with a load of . On hearing about the construction of the &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot; in early 1913, the experts and the media around the world were predicting a complete failure. The first aerial test of the &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot; on 10 May 1913 was successful. At the time, many people in other parts of the world considered it to be a newspaper hoax, and did not believe it. Observers believed that an aircraft of such dimensions would never leave the ground.

==Design==
The &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot; was a four-engine multi-bay biplane with unequal-span wings. The dual-spar wings had a rectangular planform and a chord of . The distance between the wings (wing gap) was also . Its fuselage was a rectangular section girder, covered with plywood sheets. The aircraft had a cabin with dual control columns, two passenger cabins and a storage room for spare parts. There was also an open deck forward of the pilot&#x27;s cabin equipped with a searchlight and machine gun. The ailerons on the upper wings provided for the airplane&#x27;s stability. The first quadruple-engined version of what was to become known as the &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot;, originally known as the &quot;Bolshoi Baltisky&quot; (Great Baltic), was powered by four engines installed in tandem pairs (it was originally designed as a twin-engine plane, known as &quot;Le Grand&quot;). The &quot;Russky Vityaz&quot; relocated the twin pusher engines from the &quot;Bolshoi Baltisky&#x27;s&quot; layout onto the leading edge of the lower wing as tractor configuration powerplants, outboard of the original inner tractor configuration engines.

Sikorsky described the airplane&#x27;s instruments, &quot;There were four tachometers for the engines, two altimeters, a U-glass tube with alcohol connected to a sort of pressure receiver to indicate the flying speed, a ball in a curved glass tube to work as bank indicator and a long streamline tube mounted some three feet ahead of the window with divisions to indicate the incidence. The three latter instruments were &#x27;home made,&#x27; designed for the &#x27;Grand.&#x27; They were particularly necessary because of the enclosed cabin.&quot;

==Operational history==
After the Russky Vityaz&#x27;s first test flights between 10 and 27 May 1913 O.S., it was established that a passenger could even walk around the cabins without causing any problems to stability. The aircraft left the ground after a takeoff run.

After the first test flight with his co-pilot and mechanic on board, Sikorsky noted, &quot;in order to keep the engines close to the center line, they were mounted in two tandem groups on both sides of the fuselage. This was done chiefly to protect the plane from the danger of unsymmetrical thrust if one of the outer engines should stop.&quot; However, this configuration resulted in poor take-off and climb performance, due to propeller inefficiency. In June 1913, the airplane was altered so that the two rear engines were remounted outboard on the leading edges, &quot;...transforming the installation into a four-in-line. The change resulted in a substantially improved take-off and a slightly better climb. The rudders were still effective enough to hold the plane against two engines stopped on one side.&quot; On 2 August Sikorsky flew the &quot;Grand&quot; for one hour and fifty-four minutes with eight persons on board. 

Sikorsky made a total of fifty-three flights with the &quot;Grand&quot; before it was damaged by falling debris from a different aircraft. While parked on the runway on 23 June 1913, the aircraft was crushed by an engine that fell off a single-seat Morane-Saulnier aircraft during a landing. Sikorsky decided not to repair the seriously damaged Russky Vityaz and began working on his next brainchild — the &quot;Ilya Muromets&quot;.

<text>The Hemingray Glass Company was an American glass manufacturing company founded by Robert Hemingray and Ralph Gray in Cincinnati in 1848. In its early years, the company went through numerous and frequent name changes, including Gray &amp; Hemingray; Gray, Hemingray &amp; Bros.; Gray, Hemingray &amp; Brother; Hemingray Bros. &amp; Company; and R. Hemingray &amp; Company before incorporating into the Hemingray Glass Company, Inc. in 1870. The Hemingray Glass Company had factories in Cincinnati and Covington, Kentucky with main production in Muncie, Indiana. Although Hemingray was best known for its telegraph insulators, the company produced many other glass items including bottles, fruit jars, pressed glass dishes, tumblers, battery jars, fishbowls, lantern globes, and oil lamps. In 1933, the Owens-Illinois Glass Company purchased the company, but the Hemingray name was retained at the production facility in Muncie.

The main plant in Muncie closed in 1972 and the company ceased producing insulators. The complex is now used by Gerdau Ameristeel, a steel production company headquartered in Brazil.

== Insulators ==
Hemingray was best known for producing telegraph and telephone pin insulators used on utility poles. To give an overview of the large variety of styles produced, the following table contains the twenty most common. The table provides two numbers: the Consolidated Design (CD) number and the style number. The CD number is from a classification system developed by collectors that refers to the shape of the insulator, and is independent of the Hemingray Glass Company. However, the style number (or name) was assigned by Hemingray to each insulator. Due to slight modifications in design over years of production, single styles can span multiple CD numbers.

<text>Dolly Rathebe (OIS) (2 April 1928 – 16 September 2004) was a South African musician and actress who performed with the Elite Swingsters jazz band, and in Alf Herbert&#x27;s &quot;African Jazz and Variety Show&quot;.

Rathebe died on 16 September 2004 from a stroke.

==Music career==

Rathebe was born in Randfontein, South Africa but grew up in Sophiatown, which she describes as having been &quot;a wonderful place&quot;. She was discovered around 1948 after singing at a picnic in Johannesburg. A talent scout from Gallo approached her and it was not long before she became a star.

Rathebe rose to fame in 1949, aged 21, when she appeared as a nightclub singer in the British-produced movie &quot;Jim Comes To Jo&#x27;burg&quot; - the first film to portray urban Africans in a positive light. During a photo-shoot for &quot;Drum&quot; magazine at a mine dump, Rathebe and the white photographer, Jürgen Schadeberg, were arrested under the Immorality Act, which forbade interracial relationships.

When Alf Herbert&#x27;s African Jazz and Variety show opened in 1954, Rathebe appeared and stayed as Herbert&#x27;s main attraction for many years. She became an international star when she sang with the Afro jazz group, the Elite Swingsters, in 1964.

After Sophiatown was flattened by the Apartheid government in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Rathebe found it more and more difficult to perform, especially after an 8pm curfew was imposed. She moved with her family to Cape Town township and, to survive, ran a shebeen for many years.

In 1989, Rathebe re-united with the Elite Swingsters to perform in a film that was set in 1950s Johannesburg. The group stayed together, issuing a new album, &quot;Woza&quot;, in 1991. This was followed by two more albums, &quot;A Call for Peace&quot; (1995) and &quot;Siya Gida/We Dance&quot; (1997).

In 2001, Rathebe received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the South African Music Awards.

In 2003, at the age of 75, Rathebe appeared in a Johannesburg show &quot;Sof&#x27;Town, A Celebration!&quot;, where she sang &quot;Randfontein&quot;, the story of a drunk miner returning home to find his wife in bed with another man, who is then beaten and chased out.

==Community work==
In her latter years Rathebe was a leading light in Pretoria&#x27;s Ikageng Women&#x27;s League. She funded the construction of a multi-purpose hall at Sofasonke village near Klipgat, north of Pretoria. The hall is named &quot;Meriting kwaDolly&quot;, which means &quot;Dolly&#x27;s Retreat&quot;.

In 2004, Rathebe was awarded the South African Order of Ikhamanga in Silver for her &quot;excellent contribution to music and the performing arts and commitment to the ideals of justice, freedom and democracy&quot;.

<text>The Arab Voice (in Arabic صوت العروبة transliterated Sawt al Ourouba) is a New Jersey–based Arabic newspaper, published by and for Arab Americans. The paper&#x27;s editor, Walid Rabah, founded the paper in Paterson in 1992.

In 2002, the newspaper came under criticism for publishing excerpts from &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;, a forged document over a century old which is often used as anti-Semitic propaganda because it details a supposed Jewish plot for world domination. In its defense, the newspaper stated that it was not making such statements itself; Rabah claimed he published the excerpts because the &quot;Protocols&quot; were widely circulated and accepted as genuine in much of the Arab world.

<text>Patricia Thelma Thompson (née Amphlett) OAM (born 17 March 1949), known professionally as Little Pattie, is an Australian singer who started her career as a teenager in the early 1960s, recording surf pop, with her backing group The Statesmen. She subsequently went on to record adult contemporary music.

Billed as &quot;Little Pattie&quot;, she released her debut single in November 1963, &quot;He&#x27;s My Blonde Headed, Stompie Wompie, Real Gone Surfer Boy&quot; which peaked at No. 19 on the national Kent Music Report and entered No. 2 in Sydney.

She appeared regularly on television variety programs, including &quot;Bandstand&quot;, and toured as a support act for Col Joye and the Joy Boys. Little Pattie was entertaining troops during the Vietnam War in Nui Dat, Vietnam, as an Australia Forces Sweetheart (in the vein of Lorrae Desmond, Dinah Lee and others), when the nearby Battle of Long Tan began on 18 August 1966.

In 1994 she received the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal &quot;in recognition of her services in support of the Australian Armed Forces in operations in Vietnam.&quot;

==Beginnings==
Patricia Thelma Amphlett was born in March 1949 in Paddington, New South Wales, and has an older brother, Joe. She is the first cousin of the late Chrissy Amphlett, former frontwoman of Australian band Divinyls. She was educated at King Street Primary School and Sydney Girls High School. She was nicknamed &quot;Little Pattie&quot; at school as she had two taller friends also named Patricia.

At eight years old, she commenced piano lessons with Gwen Parsons, and then singing lessons when 11 years old. Parsons also taught Noeleen Batley, a popular singer called &quot;Australia&#x27;s Little Miss Sweetheart&quot;. Both persuaded her to audition for the Nine Network TV teen variety show &quot;Saturday Date&quot;, where she was a hit. She first appeared on TV, singing on the &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; series, when she was 13. While a third-year high school student, at the age of 14, she performed weekly at the Bronte Surf Club as lead singer of the Statesmen with Nev Jade, Peter Maxworthy, Duncan McGuire (on bass guitar), Mark Rigby and Peter Walker. Singer-songwriter Jay Justin was impressed with her vocals and recommended her for a recording contract with EMI.

==Teenage singing star==
Little Pattie&#x27;s debut single was the double A-sided &quot;He&#x27;s My Blonde Headed, Stompie Wompie, Real Gone Surfer Boy&quot; / &quot;Stompin&#x27; at Maroubra&quot;, both co-written by Jay Justin and record producer Joe Halford, which used the surf music style and a dance style craze that was known as &#x27;The Stomp&#x27;. It was released by EMI on HMV in November 1963 when she was aged 14, and reached No. 2 on the Sydney music charts (#1 was the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;), No. 6 in Brisbane, and peaked at No. 19 on the national Kent Music Report. Little Pattie left school in early 1964, and released her debut album, &quot;The Many Moods of Little Pattie&quot; on EMI / HMV. She had further hits on the Sydney charts with &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Have a Party Tonight&quot; (#18 in March), &quot;Pushin&#x27; a Good Thing Too Far&quot; (#28 in March 1965) and &quot;Dance Puppet Dance&quot; (#9 in October).

Her popularity saw her voted as Australian Female Singer of the Year in 1965. She appeared frequently on television variety programs, including &quot;Bandstand&quot;, &quot;Saturday Date&quot;, &quot;An Evening With&quot; and &quot;Sing, Sing, Sing&quot;.

Little Pattie regularly toured supporting Col Joye &amp; the Joy Boys, with Judy Stone, Cathy Wayne and international star Sandie Shaw. The Joy Boys included Joye&#x27;s brothers Kevin Jacobsen on piano and Keith Jacobsen on bass guitar.

On 16 August 1966, 17 years old and tall, Little Pattie became the youngest and shortest person to entertain troops during the Vietnam War. Along with Col Joye &amp; the Joy Boys she performed three concerts each day in Nui Dat. She was singing onstage backed by the Joy Boys when the Battle of Long Tan started on 18 August less than away. Although organisers had promised her safety, she was evacuated from the area before the completion of her scheduled performances.

In the days after the battle, Joye and Little Pattie visited injured soldiers in hospital to comfort and sing to them. In 1994 she received the Vietnam Logistic and Support Medal &quot;in recognition of her services in support of the Australian Armed Forces in operations in Vietnam&quot;. From 1966, Little Pattie was performing solo in cabarets and clubs, she continued releasing singles and albums with EMI until 1970, and then signed with Joye&#x27;s ATA recording label and management group. She subsequently appeared on several TV shows in America, including &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

==Later career==
As Little Pattie entered her twenties, she continued her career moving into adult contemporary music. During the 1972 Australian Federal election campaign she sang with other entertainers including Joye and Judy Stone in the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Time&quot; TV commercial, which featured future Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam. Styled as Pattie Amphlett from 1972, she released singles and albums on ATA / Festival Records and by 1977 had moved into country music. In 1973, she married Keith Jacobsen (Joy Boys&#x27; bass guitarist, ATA record producer and manager) and continued to perform on television and in clubs. Amphlett parted from Keith in 1984 and married Lawrie Thompson (a drummer) in 1986.

Her repertoire included swing tunes from Gershwin, Rodgers and Hart, and Cole Porter. In 1990, she toured China as vocalist for veteran jazz musician Graeme Bell and his Allstars. As Patricia Thompson, she became an active unionist in the entertainment industry, and a vocal teacher, later coaching Nikki Webster before her performance at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. She has taught at a number of Sydney high schools: Burwood Girls High School, St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Hunters Hill, Mercy College, Chatswood and Saint Ignatius&#x27; College, Riverview.

In 2001 EMI re-released a compilation album, &quot;20 Stompy Wompy Hits&quot;, which featured her early songs. The ABC-TV series &quot;Long Way to the Top&quot; was broadcast in August 2001. Little Pattie featured on Episode 1, &quot;Bed of a Thousand Struggles 1956–1964&quot;, where she discussed her early surf music and &#x27;The Stomp&#x27; dance craze. The TV series inspired the Long Way to the Top national concert tour during August–September 2002, which featured a host of the best Australian acts of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s including Little Pattie and Col Joye and the Joy Boys. In 2004, General Peter Cosgrove invited her to be patron of FACE (Forces Advisory Council on Entertainment) and she was invited to go to Iraq to perform for Christmas 2005 and New Year 2006. She performed at the &quot;Salute to Vietnam Veterans&quot; held at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra on 19 August 2006.

In addition to her music career, Little Pattie was a member of the Council for the Australian War Memorial from 1995 until 1998, and received an Order of Australia Medal in 2003 for her services (as national President) to the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance and (as vice-president) to Actors&#x27; Equity. She has been on the Federal Executive of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). In 2000 &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; included her on a list of the &#x27;century&#x27;s most loved faces&#x27;, and she was included in a 1998 issue of Australian stamps featuring pop and rock acts.

On 27 August 2009, Little Pattie was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame alongside Kev Carmody, The Dingoes, Mental As Anything and John Paul Young. She was inducted by her cousin, Christina Amphlett of Divinyls, with former &quot;Australian Idol&quot; star, Lisa Mitchell performing &quot;He&#x27;s My Blonde-Headed, Stompie Wompie, Real Gone Surfer Boy&quot;.

She is currently a singing teacher at various high schools in Sydney, including St Joseph&#x27;s College and Burwood Girls High School. As from October 2023 Little Pattie was performing on the nostalgia circuit as the Good Old Days of Rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, with fellow veterans, Digger Revell, Dinah Lee and Lucky Starr.

==Personal life==
In 1973, Little Pattie married Joy Boys&#x27; bass guitarist and ATA record producer and manager Keith Jacobsen, brother of Colin (Col Joye) and Kevin Jacobsen. Keith and Little Pattie parted in 1984 and she subsequently married Lawrie Thompson in 1986.

== National honours ==

<text>Harry Kandel (c. 1885–1943) was an American clarinetist and klezmer bandleader of the early twentieth century. His recording career with the Victor Recording Company lasted from 1916 to 1927, during which he released dozens of Jewish music records.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Harry was born Chaim Kandel () sometime around 1885; on some immigration documents he gave his birthdate as September 21, 1883 or March 28, 1884. Kandel&#x27;s birthplace is also unclear, as some sources say he was born in Kraków, Galicia whereas others say it was Lviv or just Galicia more generally. In a number of census and immigration documents Kandel listed his birthplace as Russia or more specifically Kovel, Volyn Oblast (now located in Ukraine). His father was named Mordko Kandel. Despite Harry&#x27;s later career recording klezmer music in the United States, he apparently did not come from a klezmer family, but one involved in the timber trade. He studied clarinet at the Odessa Conservatory and briefly served in a Russian army band before emigrating to New York City in October 1904.

===Music career===
Upon arriving in the United States, Kandel became a working musician on the popular Keith Vaudeville Circuit with the Great Lafayette Band, then appeared on Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West show. He seems to have lived in Philadelphia as early as 1904, although he also apparently lived and worked in New York City at other times. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1912. At some point in the 1910s he became bandleader at the Arch Street Theatre, a vaudeville and Yiddish Theatre venue, where he continued to work at least until 1918. He also became assistant band director in and clarinetist/saxophonist in John Philips Sousa&#x27;s Pennsylvania State Militia Band. He also played weddings and community functions in Philadelphia.

He formed his own group, Harry Kandel&#x27;s Famous Inlet Orchestra, in 1916. He also got into business, opening the People&#x27;s Talking Machine Company on South Street, a store which sold records, sheet music and Piano rolls.

At around the same time he was recruited by the Victor Recording Company to help develop its klezmer music catalog. He became one of the well-known names in the genre alongside his contemporaries Naftule Brandwein, Max Leibowitz and Dave Tarras. According to Philadelphia klezmer researcher Hankus Netsky, his recordings during this era were full of melodies and musicians from that city&#x27;s klezmer music milieu, including drummer and xylophonist Jacob Hoffman, and was quite distinct from the recordings of the better-known New York bandleaders. He also recorded for Brunswick and Okeh. He recorded roughly 90 sides of Jewish music from 1915 to 1927.

He mostly retired from orchestral work in 1924 to run a music store. He continued performing on occasions, and appeared on the radio. In the 1930s he primarily made his living running electrical appliance stores. In the early &#x27;30s he mainly sold radios and by the late &#x27;30s was running a store that sold Westinghouse refrigerators. Years later Kandel&#x27;s wife&#x27;s obituary remembered him not as a musician but as a &quot;pioneer electrical appliance dealer&quot;. He also used his businesses to lend support to Jewish radio; for a time in the 1930s he collaborated with the Kolster Radio Corporation to fund the Kandel-Kolster Hour. That program, which aired on WDAS, presented singers such as Chaim Towber and Moishe Oysher to the city.

He died in Philadelphia on July 20 or 22, 1943, and was buried in the Montefiore Cemetery.

===Family===
Kandel married his wife Pauline (née Wool or Voll) in Philadelphia in 1907. She continued to live in Philadelphia after Harry&#x27;s death and passed away herself in 1952. Their children were Reba (born 1911), Samuel (born 1913), and Doris (born 1921), all born in Philadelphia.

==Legacy==
A collection of music manuscripts assembled by Kandel ended up in the archive of the YIVO institute in New York City, and other manuscripts which he had submitted for copyright ended up in the Library of Congress. During the Klezmer Revival of the 1970s and 1980s, there was renewed interest in 78 rpm recordings of klezmer music from the 1910s and 1920s, and some of Kandel&#x27;s old recordings were reinterpreted or reissued. Some of the reissue albums they appeared on include &quot;Jakie jazz &#x27;em up: old-time klezmer music, 1912-1926.&quot; (Global Village, 1993), &quot;Klezmer pioneers : European and American recordings, 1905-1952.&quot; (Rounder Records, 1993), and &quot;Klezmer music: early Yiddish instrumental music, 1908-1927.&quot; (Arhoolie Records, 1997). In addition, Global Village put out two CDs entirely of reissued Kandel tracks: &quot;Russian sher: master of klezmer music&quot; (1993) and &quot;Master of klezmer music. Volume 2, Der gassen nigun&quot; (1997). In 2010 the Judaica Sound Archives at Florida Atlantic University also reissued a number of his tracks in CD form: &quot;The Kandel Orchestra. Volume 1: 1917-1918.&quot; and &quot;The Kandel Orchestra. Volume 2: 1921.&quot;.

<doc id="1187558" wikidata="Q74327" url="?curid=1187558" title="Harling (wall finish)">
<text>Harling is a rough-cast wall finish consisting of lime and aggregate, known for its rough texture. Many castles and other buildings in Scotland and Ulster have walls finished with harling. It is also used on contemporary buildings, where it protects against the wet Scottish and Ulster climates and eliminates the need for paint.

== Technique ==
Harling as a process covers stonework using a plastering process involving a slurry of small pebbles or fine chips of stone. After a wall is complete and has been pointed and allowed to cure then a base of lime render is applied to the bare stone. While this render is still wet a specially shaped trowel is used to throw the pebbles onto the lime surface, which are then lightly pressed into it. Harl, being mostly lime render, cures chemically rather than simply drying. After this setting process, the harl is sometimes lime washed in a colour using traditional techniques.

It is not recommendable to replace more than around 20% of the lime content with cement. Cement-based render is very stiff and prone to crack or detach from the wall when subjected to stress induced by expansion due to solar radiation and moisture. It is also less permeable to moisture and water vapour. Water entering through fine cracks in the surface does not easily diffuse and can penetrate into the softer stone, thus causing the deterioration which harling aims to prevent. For similar reasons, modern barrier paints should not be used in place of traditional lime washes.

An example of the inadequate protection afforded by high cement harling is the Charles Rennie Mackintosh designed Hill House completed in 1904 using the newly available but poorly understood Portland cement harling. Over the years water had penetrated the harling and threatened the overall integrity of the building. The National Trust for Scotland, the building&#x27;s owner, has (2019) enclosed Hill House in a transparent &#x27;box&#x27; which will allow some rain to enter but which will eventually allow it to dry naturally. It is estimated that this will take seven to ten years, after which the box will be removed. 

== Examples ==
The technique of harling features in a large number of famous Scottish buildings including:

* Clark Cottage, Scotland on the island of Islay
* Crathes Castle in Aberdeenshire (16th century)
* Craigievar Castle in Aberdeenshire (17th century)
* Muchalls Castle in Aberdeenshire
* Myres Castle in Fife (1530 onwards)
* Stirling Castle in Stirling
* Castle of Park (Aberdeenshire)

== Historic record ==

The word &quot;harling&quot; was used in this sense in building accounts written in the Scots language, possibly deriving from the name of a tool called a &quot;harl&quot;. At Falkland Palace, in 1540, John Kelly and John Malcolm &quot;alias&quot; Callum worked on the &quot;harling&quot; of the chapel (its interior), the tennis court walls, the east turnpike turret, and the Cross House of the East Quarter. Some of the interiors were plastered by a French specialist craftsman called Hector Beato.

The three craftsmen were known as &quot;pargeonars&quot; and their interior work was sometimes called &quot;pargeoning&quot;. Lime for the work came from kilns on the nearby Lomond Hills or was shipped from Dundee to Lindores. Some lime called &quot;unburnt plaster&quot; shipped from Dundee was processed for use at Falkland using coal. The lime used with sand to &quot;pergyn&quot; two round turrets and vaulted entranceways or &quot;transes&quot; at Holyrood Palace in 1532 came from Cousland and Gilmerton.

<text>A townland (; Ulster-Scots: &quot;toonlann&quot;) is a small geographical division of land, historically and currently used in Ireland and in the Western Isles in Scotland, typically covering . The townland system is of Gaelic origin, predating the Norman invasion, and most have names of Irish origin. However, some townland names and boundaries come from Norman manors, plantation divisions, or later creations of the Ordnance Survey. The total number of inhabited townlands in Ireland was 60,679 in 1911. The total number recognised by the Irish Place Names database as of 2014 was 61,098, including uninhabited townlands, mainly small islands.

==Background==
In Ireland, a townland is generally the smallest administrative division of land, though a few large townlands are further divided into hundreds. The concept of townlands is based on the Gaelic system of land division, and the first official evidence of the existence of this Gaelic land division system can be found in church records from before the 12th century, it was in the 1600s that they began to be mapped and defined by the English administration for the purpose of confiscating land and apportioning it to investors or planters from Britain.

===Etymology===
The term &quot;townland&quot; in English is derived from the Old English word &quot;tūn&quot;, denoting an enclosure. The term describes the smallest unit of land division in Ireland, based on various forms of Gaelic land division, many of which had their own names.

The term &quot;baile&quot;, anglicised as &quot;bally&quot;, is the most dominant element used in Irish townland names. Today, the term &quot;bally&quot; denotes an urban settlement, but its precise meaning in ancient Ireland is unclear, as towns had no place in Gaelic social organisation. The modern Irish term for a townland is &quot;baile fearainn&quot; (plural: &quot;bailte fearainn&quot;). The term &quot;fearann&quot; means &quot;land, territory, quarter&quot;.

The Normans left no major traces in townland names, but they adapted some of them for their own use, possibly seeing a similarity between the Gaelic &quot;baile&quot; and the Norman &quot;bailey&quot;, both of which meant a settlement.

===Historical land divisions and etymology===


Throughout most of Ulster, townlands were known as &quot;ballyboes&quot; (, meaning &quot;cow land&quot;), and represented an area of pastoral economic value. In County Cavan similar units were called &quot;polls&quot;, and in Counties Fermanagh and Monaghan, they were known as &quot;tates&quot; or &quot;taths&quot;. These names appear to be of English origin, but had become naturalised long before 1600. Modern townlands with the prefix &quot;tat-&quot; are confined almost exclusively to the diocese of Clogher, which covers Counties Fermanagh and Monaghan, and the barony of Clogher in County Tyrone), and cannot be confused with any other Irish word. The use of the term can also be seen in the diocese of Clogher parish of Inniskeen area within Louth where the townlands of Edenagrena, Drumsinnot, Killaconner and Torpass were referred to collectively as &quot;the four tates of Ballyfoylan.&quot; In modern townland names the prefix &quot;pol-&quot; is widely found throughout western Ireland, its accepted meaning being &quot;hole&quot; or &quot;hollow&quot;. In County Cavan, which contains over half of all townlands in Ulster with the prefix &quot;pol-&quot;, some should probably be better translated as &quot;the poll of ...&quot;.

In County Tyrone, the following hierarchy of land divisions was used: &quot;ballybetagh&quot; (, meaning &quot;cattle place&quot;), &quot;ballyboe&quot;, &quot;sessiagh&quot; (, meaning sixth part of a quarter), &quot;gort&quot; and &quot;quarter&quot; (). In County Fermanagh the divisions were &quot;ballybetagh&quot;, &quot;quarter&quot; and &quot;tate&quot;. Further subdivisions in Fermanagh appear to be related to liquid or grain measures such as &quot;gallons&quot;, &quot;pottles&quot; and &quot;pints&quot;.

In Ulster, the ballybetagh was the territorial unit controlled by an Irish sept, typically containing around 16 townlands. Fragmentation of ballybetaghs resulted in units consisting of four, eight, and twelve townlands. One of these fragmented units, the &quot;quarter&quot;, representing a quarter of a ballybetagh, was the universal land denomination recorded in the survey of County Donegal conducted in 1608. In the early 17th century 20 per cent of the total area of western Ulster was under the control of the church. These &quot;termonn&quot; lands consisted likewise of ballybetaghs and ballyboes, but were held by erenaghs instead of sept leaders.

Other units of land division used throughout Ireland include:

*In County Tipperary, &quot;capell lands&quot; and &quot;quatermeers&quot;. A &quot;capell land&quot; consisted of around 20 great acres (one great acre equalled 20 English acres).
*In the province of Connacht, &quot;quarters&quot; and &quot;cartrons&quot; (, also anglicised as &quot;carrowmeer&quot;), a quarter being reckoned as four cartrons, and each cartron being 30 acres. The quarter has also been anglicised as &quot;carrow&quot;, &quot;carhoo&quot; or &quot;caracute&quot; ().
*In County Clare, as in Connacht, &quot;quarters&quot;, &quot;half-quarters&quot; (), &quot;cartrons&quot; and &quot;sessiagh&quot;. Here a &quot;half-quarter&quot; equated to around 60 acres, a &quot;cartron&quot; equated to around 30 acres and a &quot;sessiagh&quot; was around 20 acres.

&quot;Cartrons&quot; were also sometimes called &quot;ploughlands&quot; or &quot;seisreagh&quot; (, meaning a team of horses yoked to a plough).

Thomas Larcom, the first Director of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, made a study of the ancient land divisions of Ireland and summarised the traditional hierarchy of land divisions thus:

&quot;10 acres – 1 Gneeve; 2 Gneeves – 1 Sessiagh; 3 Sessiaghs – 1 Tate or Ballyboe; 2 Ballyboes – 1 Ploughland, Seisreagh or Carrow; 4 Ploughlands – 1 Ballybetagh, or Townland; 30 Ballybetaghs – Triocha Céad or Barony.&quot;

This hierarchy was not applied uniformly across Ireland. For example, a ballybetagh or townland could contain more or less than four ploughlands. Further confusion arises when it is taken into account that, while Larcom used the general term &quot;acres&quot; in his summary, terms such as &quot;great acres&quot;, &quot;large acres&quot; and &quot;small acres&quot; were also used in records. Writing in 1846, Larcom remarked that the &quot;large&quot; and &quot;small&quot; acres had no fixed ratio between them, and that there were various other kinds of acre in use in Ireland, including the Irish acre, the English acre, the Cunningham acre, the plantation acre and the statute acre. The Ordnance Survey maps used the statute acre measurement. The quality and situation of the land affected the size of these acres. The Cunningham acre is given as intermediate between the Irish and English acres.

Many of these land division terms have been preserved in the names of modern townlands. For example, the term &quot;cartron&quot; in both its English and Irish forms has been preserved in the townland names of Carrowmeer, Cartron and Carrowvere, while the term &quot;sessiagh&quot; survives in the names Shesia, Sheshodonell, Sheshymore and Shessiv. The terms &quot;ballyboe&quot; and &quot;ballybetagh&quot; tend to be preserved in the truncated form of &quot;bally&quot; as a prefix for some townland names, such as Ballymacarattybeg near Poyntzpass, County Down. Less well-known land division terms may be found in other townland names such as Coogulla (, &quot;the Ulster fifth&quot;), Treanmanagh (, &quot;the third middle&quot;) and Dehomade (, &quot;the tenth part&quot;).

A problem with the term &quot;bally&quot; in some townland names is that it can be difficult to distinguish between the Irish terms &quot;baile&quot; meaning &quot;townland&quot; and &quot;béal átha&quot; meaning &quot;approach to a ford&quot;. An example of the latter is Ballyshannon, County Donegal, which is derived from &quot;Béal Átha Seanaidh&quot;.

&quot;Sub-townlands&quot; () are also recorded in some areas, smaller divisions of a townland with their own traditional names.

===Size and value===
The average area of a townland is about , but they vary widely in size. William Reeves&#x27;s 1861 survey states that the smallest was Old Church Yard, near Carrickmore, in the parish of Termonmagurk, County Tyrone, at and the largest, at , was and is Fionnán (also called Finnaun) in the parish of Killanin, County Galway. In fact, the townland of Clonskeagh in the barony of Uppercross (abutting the main Clonskeagh townland in the barony of Dublin) was only although the area is now urbanised, so that the townlands are unused and their boundaries are uncertain.

The ballyboe, a townland unit used in Ulster, was described in 1608 as containing 60 acres of arable land, meadow, and pasture. However, this was misleading, as the size of townlands under the Gaelic system varied depending upon their quality, situation and economic potential. This economic potential varied from the extent of land required to graze cattle to the land required to support several families. The highest density of townland units recorded in Ulster in 1609 corresponds to the areas with the highest land valuations in the 1860s.

It seems that many moorland areas were not divided into townlands until fairly recently. These areas were &quot;formerly shared as a common summer pasturage by the people of a whole parish or barony&quot;.

===Historical use===
Until the 19th century most townlands were owned by single landlords and occupied by multiple tenants. The cess, used to fund roadworks and other local expenses, was charged at the same rate on each townland in a barony, regardless of its size and productive capacity. Thus, occupiers in a small or poor townland suffered in comparison to those of larger or more fertile townlands. This was reformed by Griffith&#x27;s Valuation.

===Irish Ordnance Survey and standardisation===
During the 19th century an extensive series of maps of Ireland was created by the Irish division of the Ordnance Survey for taxation purposes. These maps both documented and standardised the boundaries of the more than 60,000 townlands in Ireland. The process often involved dividing or amalgamating existing townlands, and defining townland boundaries in areas such as mountain or bog that had previously been outside the townland system. Slight adjustments are still made. There were 60,679 in 1911, compared to 60,462 townlands in 1901.

===Current use===
 Townlands form the building blocks for higher-level administrative units such as parishes and district electoral divisions (in the Republic of Ireland) or wards (in Northern Ireland).

Before 1972 townlands were included on all rural postal addresses throughout the island, but in that year the Royal Mail decided that the townland element of the address was obsolete in Northern Ireland. Townland names were not banned, but they were deemed &quot;superfluous information&quot; and people were asked not to include them on addresses. They were to be replaced by house numbers, road names and postcodes. In response the Townlands Campaign emerged to protest against the changes. It was described as a &quot;ground-level community effort&quot;. Taking place in the midst of The Troubles, the campaign was a rare example of unity between Catholics and Protestants, nationalists and unionists. Townlands and their names &quot;seem to have been considered as a shared resource and heritage&quot;. Those involved in the campaign argued that, in many areas, people still strongly identified with their townlands and that this gave them a sense of belonging. The Royal Mail&#x27;s changes were seen as a severing of this link.

At the time the county councils were the government bodies responsible for validating the change. However, as local government itself was undergoing changes, the Royal Mail&#x27;s decision was &quot;allowed ... to become law almost by default&quot;. County Fermanagh is the only county in Northern Ireland that managed to resist the change completely. Nevertheless, many newer road signs in parts of Northern Ireland now show townland names (see picture). In 2001 the Northern Ireland Assembly passed a motion requesting government departments to make use of townland addresses in correspondence and publications.

In the Republic of Ireland townlands continue to be used on addresses. In 2005 the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced that a postcode system was to be introduced (see Republic of Ireland postal addresses). The system, known as Eircode, was introduced in 2014, but although more widely used by 2021, townlands remain predominant address identifiers in rural areas.

<text>George Godfrey Massy Wheeler, VC (31 January 1873 – 13 April 1915) was a British Army officer, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Background and family==
Wheeler was a grandson of Sir Hugh Massy Wheeler. He was educated at Bedford Modern School. In 1900 he married Nellie Purcell, a daughter of the surgeon Ferdinand Purcell.

==Military career==
Wheeler was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Wiltshire Regiment on 20 May 1893, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 April 1895. He transferred to the Indian Staff Corps in 1897 where he was attached to the 7th Bengal Lancers, stationed at Faizabad. Appointed adjutant of the regiment on 25 October 1901, he was promoted to captain on 20 May 1902.

Wheeler is buried in Basra War Cemetery - Plot III. Row C. Grave 22 his grave now unmarked. His name is mentioned on the map of the cemetery as he is situated at the end of the row.

==Victoria Cross==
He was Major in the 7th Hariana Lancers, British Indian Army, during World War I. On 12 April 1915 at Shaiba, Mesopotamia, Major Wheeler led his squadron in an attempt to capture a flag which was the centre-point of a group of the enemy who were firing on one of his troop&#x27;s picquets. He advanced, attacked the enemy&#x27;s infantry with the lance, and then retired while the enemy swarmed out of hidden ground where Royal Artillery guns could attack them. On 13 April Major Wheeler led his squadron to the attack of the North Mound. He was seen far ahead of his men, riding straight for the enemy&#x27;s standards, but was killed in the attack. Major Wheeler was 42 years old at the time of this action, for which he was awarded the VC.

<text>The merk () is a long-obsolete Scottish silver coin. Originally the same word as a money mark of silver, the merk was in circulation at the end of the 16th century and in the 17th century. It was originally valued at 13 shillings 4 pence (exactly of a pound Scots, or about one shilling sterling), later raised to 14&quot;s.&quot; Scots.
==Varieties==
In addition to the merks, coins issued include the four merk worth 56&quot;s.&quot; or £2/16/-; the half merk (or noble), worth 6/8 or 80 pence; the quarter merk, 3/4 or 40&quot;d.&quot;; the eighth-thistle merk, worth 1/8 or 20&quot;d.&quot;

==Issues and historical context==
The first issue weighed and was 50% silver and 50% base metals, thus it contained of pure silver.

&quot;Markland&quot;, or &quot;Merkland&quot;, was used to describe an amount of land in Scottish deeds and legal papers. It was based upon a common valuation of the land.

During the &quot;Lang Siege&quot; of Edinburgh Castle in 1572, the last phase of the Marian civil war, the goldsmith James Cockie minted half merks in the castle, while the supporters of James VI set up their mint at Dalkeith.

The &quot;Ten Merk Court,&quot; was a small-claims court in Edinburgh dealing with small debts up to the value of ten merks (i.e. £7), or for the recovery of servants&#x27; wages.

James VI issued silver merks with the lion of Scotland on the obverse and a thistle on the reverse. The last Scottish silver coinage of merks before the Union of Crowns of 1603, sometimes called the &quot;eighth coinage&quot; of James VI, were dated 1601, 1602, 1603, with some full thistle merks minted in 1604. James VI and I made the merk current in England on 8 April 1603, to be worth 13.5 English pence.

<text>Białostoczek is a district of the City of Białystok, Poland. It is a mixed residential and industrial area. Prior to its incorporation into the city in 1919, it was a separate village.

==History==
Białostoczek originally was a grange, later a village at the Wysokostocki grange, and was founded in 1547. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Białostoczek was part of the Highland farm belonging to Jan Klemens Branicki. It was then a large village with 47 farms and an inn. At the end of the 18th century, Białostoczek had the form of a street road, and its layout was characteristic of villages founded or regulated as part of spear measurements.

Białostoczek can be seen on city maps from the times of Jan Klemens Branicki. It is already marked on the &quot;Plan du chateauet de la ville de Bialystok&quot; from around 1771. As &quot;Bialystoczek&quot; it is present on the map of New East Prussia from 1808, as well as the tsarist military plan of Bialystok from 1886. Białystok was not included in Białystok until May 10, 1919. On the plan of Białystok from the 1930s, but also from 1966 there are only a few streets in the place of today&#x27;s housing estate: Białostoczek, Zagumienna, Kozłowa, Radzymińska, Suwalska, Sitarska, Bielska, Hajnowska and Sokólska. The latter, however, has a completely different course. From the Avenue of the Millennium of the Polish State to Zagumienna, it coincides with our modern street, but later it turns south and ends in the place of today&#x27;s roundabout of priest Zbigniew Krupski. On the plan from 1966, two colonies are also marked: Białostoczek I and Białostoczek II lying north of the intersection of Tysiąclecia Avenue of the Polish State and Sokólska Street.

In 1973, Białostocka Spółdzielnia Mieszkaniowa (BSM) announced a competition for an urban design of the housing estate between the Tysiąclecie Państwa Polskiego Street, the tracks to Kuźnica Białostocka and Sitarska Street. For further work, the project made by &quot;Inwestprojekt&quot; in Poznań by the team A. Łuczkowski (main designer), M. Weigt (designer) and N. Lewandowski (head of the studio) was selected. The first blocks began to be erected at the beginning of 1977. The first buildings were being built at Kozłowa Street. The oldest quarter of the estate is located between Kozłowa and Białostoczek streets (Białostoczek blocks 3,5,7,9 and Kozłowa 26, 30, 32, 34, 36).

== Places of interest ==
* Divine Mercy Sanctuary
* Białystok Power Station ()
* The Michał Sopoćko group of schools

==Overview==
A relic of the former village of Białostoczek is today&#x27;s Białostoczek Street. It runs along the trail of a country road leading from Białystok towards the forester&#x27;s lodge on the border of the Wesołowski Forest and the Pietrasze Forest. In turn, Zagumienna Street was marked out at the road behind individual farms.

There are two historic railway lines separating Białostoczek from the surrounding districts. From the south, the district is limited by the route launched in 1886 from Białystok to Baranowicze through Waliły and Wołkowysk. In turn, from the north-west it is the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway, which opened in 1862.

Relics of old buildings have survived in the western part of the estate. At Bielska, Olecka and Suwalska Streets, individual houses were built in the interwar years. Roadside crosses located along Białostoczek Street are other relics of the rural past of the estate.

<text>Alan Bray (13 October 1948 – 25 November 2001) was a British historian and gay rights activist. He was a Roman Catholic and had a particular interest in Christianity&#x27;s relationship to homosexuality.

==Early life==
Bray was born in Hunslet, Leeds, to a working-class family. His mother died when he was 12, an event that profoundly affected his relationships. He attended Leeds Central High School, where he met his lifelong friend Graham Wilson. He attended Bangor University and spent a year at an Anglican seminary before beginning a career in civil service.

==Gay rights activism==
He became involved with the Gay Liberation Front in the 1970s and actively campaigned for gay rights. His interest in sexual politics influenced his work on history, which culminated in two books. His groundbreaking book &quot;Homosexuality in Renaissance England&quot; was published in 1982. His second book, &quot;The Friend&quot;, was published posthumously after his death from heart failure in 2001.

==Legacy==
The Roman Catholic Caucus of the Gay and Lesbian Christian Movement, of which Bray was a member, instituted a series of Alan Bray Memorial Lectures on Catholic theology and homosexuality. British historians Michael Hunter, Miri Rubin, and Laura Gowing co-edited the book &quot;Love, Friendship and Faith in Europe, 1300–1800&quot; (Palgrave Macmillan, 2005), a collection of essays inspired by Bray&#x27;s idea of finding some universal component of homosexuality within the experiences of intimacy and friendship without &quot;locating a discourse that identifies persons as homosexual.&quot; Nick Rumens&#x27; &quot;Queer Company: The Role and Meaning of Friendship in Gay Men&#x27;s Work Lives&quot; (Ashgate, 2011), is also inspired by Alan Bray&#x27;s scholarship. Valerie Traub (&quot;Thinking Sex with the Early Moderns&quot;) is amongst many subsequent LGBTQ scholars who have engaged with and been inspired by Bray&#x27;s scholarship.

<text>Osiedle Sienkiewicza is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok. It is one of the smaller districts in terms of the area but is relatively densely populated. The district lies directly north to the city centre on the right bank of the Biala river (with the exception of a small segment of Pilsudski alley, which lies on the left bank). It is named after Henryk Sienkiewicz, whose statue can be found in the district.

The area comprises what used to be the northern part of the Jewish ghetto created by Nazi German occupying forces during World War II. On 20 August 1943 the ghetto was pacified, which resulted in a total destruction of the area - less than 20 buildings from before that period have survived until now.

After the World War II finished, the area was redeveloped and now consists of urban greenery, public buildings and a housing estate. The latter consists mainly of four- and eleven-storey blocks of flats administered by one housing association - Bialostocka Spoldzielnia Mieszkaniowa (BSM). There are also several buildings owned by other associations as well as private proprietors.

On 9 March 1989 a train carrying chlorine was derailed on the railway bordering the district. If the chlorine tanks had opened much of the population of the city would have been killed, but the emergency was successfully dealt with by fire brigade. This event is commemorated by a statue standing on Poleska street where the accident took place.

<text>Cotriade (&quot;Kaoteriad&quot; in Breton) is a fish stew specialty from the French region of Brittany that is made with different kinds of fish as well as potatoes, onions, and garlic. Oily fish are typically used, such as herring, sprats, and mackerel. Unlike Bouillabaisse, another French stew, it usually does not contain shellfish. It is traditionally served by pouring it over a toasted baguette. Other breads may also be used.

It is also very prominent in other French regions surrounding Brittany due to its access to the sea.

It is known in the UK as Brittany Fish Stew.

<text>Bojary is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok.

==History==
Bojary is first mentioned on December 5, 1581. The then owner of the Białystok estate, Piotr Wiesiołowski mentions the village under the name Miłosze. This tiny settlement was located along today&#x27;s Warszawska Street on its section from Sienkiewicza to Pałacowa Street. Inhabitants of the village, apart from cottages and farms, had a considerable area of arable land. They stretched from Słonimska St. to Sobieskiego St. In the second half of the 18th century the territories of Bojary were incorporated to the city of Bialystok. Branicki enlarged the city but for many years the section of Warszawska Street, the location high school, a post office, hospital, bank or Trylling Palace was called Bojarska Street. Despite the incarnation of the term &#x27;Bojary&#x27;, the inclusion of today&#x27;s Warszawska Street (from Pałacowa to Sienkiewicza) to the city, the lives of the inhabitants retained their rural character until the partitions. Some of the unique road network has survived, several houses. If the street meanders, has unusual faults (like the connection between Starobojarska and Sobieskiego Street) it is likely that it is an ancient way:
*Skorupska Street - as a former border between the Crown of the Polish Kingdom and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (1569-1795)
*Kraszewskiego Street - route to the Monastery in Supraśl
*Gliniana Street - based on former excavation, clay was mined here for centuries, through which the street clearly goes down
*Sobieskiego Street - road dividing arable land.

<text>Piaski is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok.

==History==
Piaski first mentioned in a census from 1825 kept in Grodno archives as a sandy area with empty properties behind Supraska Gate. People moved to the area during the 19th century. In the second half of the 19th century, Jews were grouped on the southern outskirts of the Great Synagogue, from where they were also close to the markets. Further, up to Zwierzyniec Forest, the authorities marked out the area for the barracks. Up to the Second Polish Republic, Piękna street connected the Sienna Market Square with the Fish Market (Rynek Rybna), which was reached by the streets: Wołodyjowskiego with Plutonowa and Wojskowa with Piwna (M. Skłodowskiej-Curie). The tsarist regiment took the place of the garrison command, and barracks of the cavalry reserve centers also stood in that area. The Fish Hall and adjacent shops, workshops and storehouses survived World War II. But with the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, private trade was forbidden. Piwna street was to renamed Aleja Pochodów, was widened to connect the edifice of the party&#x27;s Provincial Committee with the courts which and trade unions and the hospital complex. Later the street was changed to Skłodowskiej-Curie Street.

<text>Carlos Núñez Muñoz (born 1971) is a Spanish musician and multi-instrumentalist who plays the gaita, the traditional Galician bagpipe, Galician flute, ocarina, Irish flute, whistle and low whistle.

==Life and career==
Nuñez was born in 1971 in Vigo, Galicia. He began playing the bagpipes when he was eight years old. In his early teens, he was invited to play with the Festival Orchestra of the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in Brittany. He studied the recorder at the Royal Conservatory in Madrid, Spain and quickly gained stature as a young virtuoso. He met Paddy Moloney of The Chieftains and performed with the band two years later, becoming referred to as the &quot;7th member&quot; of the band. He appeared on their Grammy-winning &quot;Santiago&quot;, which focused on Galician music and included other artists such as Los Lobos and Linda Ronstadt.

He has collaborated with Ry Cooder, Sharon Shannon, Sinéad O&#x27;Connor, The Chieftains, Altan and La Vieja Trova Santiaguera. He collaborated with Liam O&#x27;Flynn on The Piper&#x27;s Call to perform &quot;Muiñeira de Poio / Muiñeira de Ourense.&quot; His most renowned album was 1996&#x27;s &quot;A Irmandade Das Estrelas&quot;, which sold an unprecedented 100,000 copies, and included collaborations with Nightnoise, Luz Casal, Tino di Geraldo, Tríona Ní Dhomhnaill and Mícheál Ó Domhnaill, Kepa Junkera, Ry Cooder, The Chieftains, and Dulce Pontes.

He was a key collaborator in Tamiya Terashima&#x27;s soundtrack for the film Tales from Earthsea (&quot;Gedo Senki&quot;), released in July 2006. He also released an additional album, titled &quot;Melodies from Gedo Senki&quot;, which included new Gedo Senki open source tracks (OST) along with new tunes by Carlos himself.

On his 1999 album &quot;Os Amores Libres&quot;, he collaborated with French producer Hector Zazou.

He continues to tour the world playing in large and small venues. Nuñez was in Japan in October 2011 reciting at two locations, at Sarutahiko Shrine in Ise, Mie and a live house in Tokyo with regular collaborator Pancho Álvarez (bouzouki), his brother Xurxo Nuñez (percussion) and Begona Rioboo (fiddle) working with an Okinawan singer songwriter Koja Misako and keyboardist Sahara Kazuya. He played his first major North American tour in October 2012, accompanied by his brother Xurxo on percussion, Álvarez on guitar, fiddle player Katie McNally (in the United States), and fiddle-player Sahra Featherstone and singer Eleanor McCain (in Canada). He was hailed as the &quot;Hendrix of the bagpipes&quot;.

In 2010 he collaborated with the French Puy du Fou theme park in the creation of their show &quot;The Secret of the Lance.&quot; In January 2013 he embarked on a seven date tour of the UK with fellow pipe-player Philip Pickett and early music ensemble The Musicians of the Globe.

In 2016 he participated in the film by Carlos Saura, the legendary Spanish film maker who reveals the energy and passion of the jota, a waltz-like castanet dance with its origins in Saura&#x27;s home province of Aragon. Around a Celtic circle, Nuñez with his bagpipe directed the Galician jota. Surrounded by musicians and dancers, he got a crescendo that ends up being one of the most energetic and magical moments of the film.

<text>George Campbell Wheeler VC (7 April 1880 – 26 August 1938) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Early life ==
Wheeler was born in 1880, and attended Bedford School from 1893 to 1897. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Indian Staff Corps on 20 January 1900, and served with the 9th (Gurkha Rifle) Bengal Infantry. He was promoted to lieutenant on 20 April 1902.

== Details ==
He was 36 years old, and a major in the 2nd Battalion, 9th Gurkha Rifles, British Indian Army during World War I when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 23 February 1917 at Shumran on the River Tigris, Mesopotamia, Major Wheeler, together with one Gurkha officer and eight men of Khas battalion crossed the river and rushed the enemy&#x27;s trench in the face of very heavy fire. Having obtained a footing on the far bank, he was almost immediately counter-attacked by the enemy with a party of bombers. Major Wheeler at once led a charge, receiving in the process a severe bayonet wound in the head. In spite of this, however, he managed to disperse the enemy and consolidate his position.

He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the National Army Museum, Chelsea, London.

<text>Antoniuk is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok, located in the central part of the city.

==History==
Antoniuk is named after a man called Antoniuk from the nearby former village of Wysokie. The district is built on what was one of the two mill settlements in today&#x27;s Białystok, located on the Biała River. The dam damming the pond (which no longer exists) was located near the bridge through which today runs Antoniukowska Street. Mention of a pond
Antoniukowski contains Teka Glinki. At the bottom of a drained pond there was a stadium and a training ground for the &quot;Włókniarz&quot; sports club. Later,
an apartment building was built here. 

Antoniuk settlement was located parallel to the fields of the village of Białostoczek, from the border with Pietrasze to Antoniukowska Street. The shape of the settlement was similar to a rectangle and bordered on from the east with the village of Białostoczek, from the north with Dziesięciny, from the west with today&#x27;s street Dębowa and to the south from Antoniukowska Street. The Antoniuk mill settlement boundaries also included the area of today&#x27;s Technical School of Water Melioration, where originally a mill with associated buildings owned by Antoniuk was located. The Wysokostockie hill was connected with the high elevation of the area, called Łysa Góra. In the years 1960 - 1965 construction of housing estates in the areas newly connected to the city began.

==Sights==

A monument to soldiers of the 1st Legions Infantry Regiment of the Polish Army who died in the Battle of Białystok (1920) during the Polish–Soviet War is located in the district.

<text>Jaroszówka is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok. It is a suburban dormitory district with low buildings, mainly detached houses.

==History==
In 1945 in Pietrasze Forest which is located within the district&#x27;s boundaries, an Internal Security Corps (KWB) firing range was established. At least one death sentence was publicly executed there, Mieczysław Kaźmierski nicknamed &quot;Hurricane&quot;, which deserted the KBW and joined the anti government guerrilla unit of Capt. Romuald Rajs &quot;Burego&quot;. Kaźmierski was tied to a tree, and fifteen random soldiers, colleagues of the convict, were selected for the firing squad. None of the soldiers fired a lethal shot. Shots from handguns were shot by the commanding chief of the regiment&#x27;s staff of execution. It is highly probable that the corpse of the executed was buried on the spot. An unconfirmed account also shows that the body of Capt. Władysław Łukasiuk &quot;Młot&quot; and another soldier of the anti-communist underground, unknown by name. Nowadays the area is publicly available and the remains of the shooting range are visible.

<doc id="1187611" wikidata="Q2098000" url="?curid=1187611" title="Hill of Fearn">
<text>Hill of Fearn () is a small village near Tain in Easter Ross, in the Scottish council area of Highland.

==Geography==
The village is on the B9165 road, between the A9 trunk road and the smaller hamlet of Fearn to the southeast. The parish church of Fearn Abbey stands a few minutes walk to the south-east of the village. Coincidentally, one of its Abbots, Abbot Finlay McFaed (d.1485) almost shares his unusual surname with the present renovator and owner of Balnagown Castle (Seat of the Clan Ross, 10 minutes drive to the southwest) - Mohamed Al Fayed.

The former RNAS Fearn (HMS Owl) is to the south of the village.

==Village==
Hill of Fearn has a post office which doubles as the village shop and butchers, a primary school and a bus stop. Fearn railway station, located on the Far North Line, is around from the village.

The &quot;N&quot; on the sign into the village is often removed, giving the village the more sinister title of &quot;Hill of Fear&quot; - despite the best efforts of Highland Council to replace the N, or the entire sign itself, on a number of occasions.

Care should be taken to distinguish between the village of Hill of Fearn and the parish of Fearn; the latter also contains the villages of Hilton and Balintore, distant from Hill of Fearn, as well as the hamlet of Fearn, away from Hill of Fearn. The name Fearn, according to Watson&#x27;s &quot;Place Names of Ross &amp; Cromarty&quot;, derives from the Scottish Gaelic &quot;Feàrna&quot; (an alder tree).

==Famous residents==
Hill of Fearn was the birthplace (28 August 1884) of New Zealand Prime Minister Peter Fraser (1 April 1940 to 13 December 1949). Tarbat Discovery Centre, located away in Portmahomack, has an archive relating to Peter Fraser (not on display, but may be consulted on request).

Hill of Fearn was also the birthplace (14 May 1948) of churchman John MacLeod.

The author Eric Linklater (1899–1974), when he was owner of nearby Pitcalzean House, Nigg in the 1940s and 1950s bought his clothes from the village tailor, Norman Smart.

<doc id="1187613" wikidata="Q7106748" url="?curid=1187613" title="Osiedle Wygoda, Białystok">
<text>Wygoda is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok, located north and north-east of the historic city center.

==History==
In the nineteenth century, the areas which today make up the district&#x27;s territory belonged to the Kryński family and were the location of the villages Bagnówka, Pieczurki and Pietrasze. Its name comes from the forest inn &quot;Wygoda&quot; which was located on the road to Supraśl, around which the settlement developed. After the January Uprising, the tsarist authorities deported the family to Siberia, and their property was confiscated. A Voltaire received them, who later sold the land to two people, Koch and Sosnowski who in turn allocated a plot for the construction of tsarist military barracks, and the 64th Kazan infantry regiment () moved to there. With the liberation of Białystok in 1919 and the establishment of the Second Polish Republic, the Polish Army occupied the barracks. They were rebuilt and named after Romuald Traugutt. From June 1921, the 42nd Infantry Regiment of the Polish Army was stationed there. A training ground was located in the Pietrasze Forest in nearby Jaroszówka district.

In the years 1934–1936, a military railway siding, five large, multi-storey warehouses, as well as administrative and auxiliary buildings were built here. The depot was to be useful in the event of war and the related mobilization of the Polish Army of the Second Polish Republic. This is how the complex of intent was created as a base for the 18th Infantry Division, whose staff was stationed in Łomża. From August 1944, the warehouses at Węglowa Street were used as supply base for the Soviet Armed Forces. After the reorganization of the army following the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, from 1952 the warehouses were again used as a base for the land base of material troops. Initially, the 18th Central Food Depot ( was stationed there, and from 1977 by the 1st Quartermaster Squad () (JW 1590).

===World War II===
In September 1939 with the onset of the Second World War and Invasion of Poland, the soldiers of the regiment left the barracks and fought against Nazi Germany at Ostrołęka, Myszyniec, and Nowogród. Following the Soviet occupation of the city and the Red Army was stationed in the barracks. In 1941 the Germans entered again the city and used the barracks. In 1944, when retreating from Bialystok, the Wehrmacht destroyed the city and set fire to the barracks. The barracks were finally demolished in 1951 with some building materials were used in the construction of a textile factory in Fasty district.

===Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus===
At first it was an orthodox church for the Kazan infantry regiment at the military barracks. From 1927, after the reconstruction, the church was converted to a catholic one, it was a garrison church and called Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus ().

During World War II, the church was badly damaged. After entering the Białystok, the Soviets completely devastated the interior and tractors were used to demolish the tower. In 1946, thanks to the commitment of priest Aleksander Syczewski and its residents, it was renovated. Finally, the reconstruction was completed by the priest Bogusław Kieżel.

===After the war===
The post war period saw massive growth and construction as with the rest of Bialystok when the old wooden buildings gave way to new buildings, a residential block housing was established at Wasilkowska Street and new industrial areas were also created (Preventative Police base in 42 Pułku Piechoty Street 44), Municipal Cleaning Company () in 42 Pułku Piechoty Street 48, Youth Correctional Facility (42 Pułku Piechoty Street 117 ), National Horticultural Farm Huta Szkła. In the 1960s a municipal gasworks (Dolistowska 1 Street) was built in the district. Also located in the district are a Roman Catholic Cemetery and Jewish Cemetery. Even though modern industrial construction occurred, few surviving old houses exists such as the one at 16 Kapralska Street.

According to a resolution of the city council adopted on October 25, 2004, on the new administrative division of Białystok, the Bagnówka and Pieczurki were incorporated to the enlarged Wygoda district.

In second decade of the 21st century transport arteries in the district were renovated and modernized: Two modern two-level road junctions were built: intersection of Wasilkowska Street with Andersa Street and the intersection of Casimir the Great street with a route to Bobrowniki (road 65). A modern route was created, running from the General Andersa railway viaduct to Wasilkowska Street and further along the new St. General Sulik to Zaścianiki.

<doc id="1187619" wikidata="Q7314660" url="?curid=1187619" title="Republican Party of Minnesota v. White">
<text>Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, 536 U.S. 765 (2002), was a decision of the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the First Amendment rights of candidates for judicial office. In a 5–4 decision, the court ruled that Minnesota&#x27;s announce clause, which forbade candidates for judicial office from announcing their views on disputed legal and political issues, was unconstitutional.

== Background == 
Minnesota, like many states, had a code of judicial ethics that constrained candidates seeking to be elected as judges from discussing issues that could come before them if elected and announcing their views—referred to as an &quot;announce clause.&quot;

In 1996, Gregory Wersal ran for associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. He distributed literature critical of several Minnesota Supreme Court decisions. An ethics complaint was filed against him; however, the board, which was to review the complaint, dismissed the charges and cast doubt upon the constitutionality of the announce clause.

In 1998, Wersal ran again for the same office. However, this time, he preemptively filed suit in Federal District Court against Suzanne White, the chairperson of the Minnesota Board on Judicial Standards. Wersal charged that the announce clause limited his right to free speech and made a mockery of the election process by denying him the ability to wage a meaningful campaign. The Republican Party of Minnesota joined in Wersal&#x27;s lawsuit, arguing that the restrictions prevented the Party from learning Wersal&#x27;s views on the issues and thus making an informed decision to oppose or support his candidacy.

The district court found that the announce clause did not violate the Constitution. Wersal appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and they affirmed the district court&#x27;s decision. Wersal then filed for a &quot;writ of certiorari&quot; to the United States Supreme Court, which was granted.

== The decision ==
In a 5–4 ruling, the Supreme Court reversed the Eighth Circuit and declared Minnesota&#x27;s announce clause to be in violation of the First Amendment. The Court reasoned that Minnesota&#x27;s announce clause &quot;burden[ed] a category of speech that is at the core of First Amendment freedoms -- speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office.&quot; 
The Court concluded that the announce clause was not narrowly tailored to serve the state&#x27;s compelling interest in judicial impartiality and therefore failed the test of strict scrutiny.

== Post-decision ==
In 2006, a retired Justice O&#x27;Connor expressed concern about her vote in the White case, stating, &quot;That (Minnesota) case, I confess, does give me pause.&quot;

<text>The party plan is a method of marketing products by hosting what is presented as a social event at which products will be offered for sale. It is a form of direct selling. The primary system for generating sales leads for home party plan sales is the home party itself: the salesperson uses the home party business model as a source for future business by asking attendees if they would like to host selling parties, too.

Direct selling through the party plan typically uses multi-level marketing (salesperson is paid for selling and for sales made by people they recruit or sponsor) rather than single-level marketing (salesperson is paid only for the sales they make themself).

This plan has been used primarily to sell items whose main appeal is to women by women, such as kitchen utensils, home decor items, jewelry, cosmetics, handbags, and similar products. Recent additions to the field include lingerie, wine, and sex toys. Sometimes a combination party is held, at which a wide variety of such merchandise is offered for sale.

==How it works==
In this system, representatives of the sales organization, usually women, approach other women about hosting a social event in their homes during which a product will be demonstrated and offered for sale to guests. In consideration, they will be given hostess gifts and a portion of the proceeds from the amount of goods sold. Frequently all in attendance will be given a token item of nominal value as an incentive to attend.

At the event, the salesperson displays and demonstrates various products. She then takes orders from attendees. The salesperson is almost always paid solely a commission on sales. If the salesperson has recruited other sales people into the organization, then she also receives a commission based on her recruits&#x27; sales.

==History==
The party plan is regarded as primarily the invention of Norman W. Squires, who developed it for Stanley Home Products in Westfield, MA, which company was founded by Stanley Beveridge and Catherine O&#x27;Brien in the mid-1930s. Mr. Beveridge and Ms. O&#x27;Brien were former employees of the Fuller Brush Company, which sold its products with door-to-door salespersons.

==Criticism==
The party plan is criticized for exploiting social conventions and pressuring &quot;guests&quot; into buying things they do not want.

Purse parties that are not done through a dedicated program by the manufacturer differ, however, from these other parties in that the merchandise at these parties often consists of counterfeit knock-offs of popular, name-brand purses. Merchandise at American purse parties is usually bought in bulk from smugglers in New York&#x27;s Chinatown or in Los Angeles&#x27; garment district and sold to unsuspecting customers at a significantly higher price, although still lower than the retail price of the legitimate product. These inferior smuggled goods have been linked to organized crime and the funding of terrorism, so purse parties have become of interest to law enforcement. Selling such purses, with an imitation designer label, is a US federal crime, even if the seller tells the buyer that the purse is a fake.

<text>Frederick Whirlpool, VC (17 July 1831 – 24 June 1899) was an English soldier and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC) during the Indian Mutiny. The Victoria Cross is the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. In his later life, Whirlpool migrated to Australia; as a result, he is sometimes claimed as an Australian VC recipient, although his name is not included in the official count.

==Early life and military career==
For many years he was believed to have been born as &quot;Frederick Conker&quot; in Liverpool, in either 1829 or 1830, and some sources state that he was born in London. However, in his 2018 book Allen Leek provided evidence that he was born on 17 July 1831 in County Carlow, in Ireland. His early childhood, was spent in Ireland where he most probably attended the Dundalk Institute an Irish Protestant school. Upon completion of his education he found himself working as a clerk for the Dundalk Poor Law Union, a job that he hated. Following an argument with his father, he left Ireland to enlist in the army of the East India Company.

Upon enlistment he assumed the name of Frederick Whirlpool, which he later explained was due to his father&#x27;s characterisation of his temper. He arrived in Bombay in 1855 and joined the 3rd Bombay European Regiment (later The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Leinster Regiment). Although he was assigned the role of an assistant schoolmaster, in early April 1858, during the Indian Mutiny, Whirlpool&#x27;s regiment was sent to Jhansi, to recapture it from mutineers who had taken it the previous year. Whirlpool subsequently found himself in the thick of the fighting.

Over the course of a month Whirlpool distinguished himself to his superiors on a number of occasions. The first instance came in early April when, during the fighting in Jhansi, braving heavy fire and at great personal risk he rescued two wounded men who had fallen in the open. Later, in May, during an assault on Lohari, he single-handedly defended a wounded subaltern who had fallen in the open and subsequently been surrounded by enemy soldiers. For his actions during this time, Whirlpool was nominated for the Victoria Cross, the British military&#x27;s highest decoration for gallantry. The award was announced in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 21 October 1859, which stated the following:

==Later life==
After the action for which Whirlpool later received the Victoria Cross, he was hospitalised in Jhansi. Surviving despite considerable odds, he was considered too injured to remain in the military and as a result was discharged prior to receiving his award. He was granted a pension and subsequently migrated to Australia. In 1859 he landed in Victoria and he began looking for work. He was employed briefly as a school teacher, and he applied unsuccessfully to join the police. Later he joined the Hawthorne and Kew Volunteer Rifles, assuming a different name. Eventually a drill instructor discovered who he was and in June 1861, in front of 2,000 people, in the uniform of his new regiment, Whirlpool reluctantly received his medal.

Later, after turning down a job offer to join the police, Whirlpool changed his name to Humphrey James and moved to Tasmania. By 1865, however, he had moved to Sydney. Keeping his identity secret, he undertook a teachers training course and then began working at a school near Wisemans Ferry. Still plagued by his injuries, and although considered to be a good teacher, he had a drinking problem, though for long periods a teetotaller, circumstances would have him lapse into a drinking binge, and this eventually led to him being dismissed from the state school system (he continued to teach in private schools and as a tutor).

Following this, Whirlpool became a &quot;hermit&quot; and moved to Windsor, although he continued to draw his pension. In the final part of his life, Whirlpool confided his true identity to a grocer called Smith, who allowed him to live on his property for a time and supported him by giving him free groceries. When Whirlpool died on 24 June 1899, Smith assumed the role of executor of Whirlpool&#x27;s estate, arranging for him to be buried in a Presbyterian churchyard. Whirlpool had been so reclusive in his final years that Smith was the only attendee at the funeral.

==The medal==

The presentation of Whirlpool&#x27;s medal, on 20 June 1861, was the first public presentation in Australia of a Victoria Cross. The medal was presented to him by Lady Barkly, the wife of Sir Henry Barkly, the governor of Victoria at that time. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, Australia.

The medal has not always been on display in the AWM, though, and the story of its acquisition is of itself indicative of the debate about Whirlpool&#x27;s national identity and the reluctance of Australians to consider the role of the British in the nation&#x27;s early military history. Where the medal went initially after Whirlpool&#x27;s death is unknown. There is speculation that it might have been kept by Smith, or that Smith sent it to Whirlpool&#x27;s brother in the United States; however, by the 1950s it was in the possession of a medal dealer in London. It was then purchased by Denys Croll, an Irish school teacher working in Australia. Croll subsequently offered to donate the medal to the AWM in the early 1960s but was turned down as it was initially felt that it did not belong in their collection because &quot;Whirlpool wasn&#x27;t Australian&quot;.

The Mitchell Library in Sydney offered to display it but Croll died before this could be affected. Croll&#x27;s widow subsequently offered to loan the medal and in the mid-1960s one of the AWM&#x27;s curators, Peter Burness, argued that Whirlpool was Australian and sought to acquire it for a new section of the memorial dedicated to Victoria Cross recipients. Nevertheless, the debate about the appropriate characterisation of Whirlpool&#x27;s nationality continued to affect the way the award was presented in the memorial for a number of decades. This lasted until the mid-1980s when Whirlpool&#x27;s integration into the story of Australia&#x27;s pre-First World War military history seemingly came into acceptance when he was included in the second edition of Wigmore and Harding&#x27;s &quot;They Dared Mightily&quot;, in which although he was not included in the official count of 96 Australian recipients he was characterised as an Australian recipient of the award, albeit one who had not served in the Australian forces and who had been born elsewhere.

<doc id="1187641" wikidata="Q2046809" url="?curid=1187641" title="Black Sea deluge hypothesis">
<text>The Black Sea deluge is the best known of three hypothetical flood scenarios proposed for the Late Quaternary history of the Black Sea. One other flood scenario proposes a rapid, even catastrophic, rise in sea level of the Black Sea.

==History==

In 1997, William Ryan, Walter Pitman, Petko Dimitrov, and their colleagues first published the &quot;Black Sea deluge hypothesis&quot;. They proposed that a catastrophic inflow of Mediterranean seawater into the Black Sea freshwater lake occurred around 7,600 years ago, .

As proposed, the Early Holocene Black Sea flood scenario describes events that would have profoundly affected prehistoric settlement in Eastern Europe and adjacent parts of Asia and possibly was the basis of oral history concerning the myth of Noah&#x27;s flood. Some archaeologists support this theory as an explanation for the lack of Neolithic sites in northern Turkey. In 2003, Ryan and coauthors revised the dating of the early Holocene flood to 8,800 years ago, .

Before that date, glacial meltwater had turned the Black and Caspian seas into vast freshwater lakes draining into the Aegean Sea. As glaciers retreated, some of the rivers emptying into the Black Sea declined in volume and changed course to drain into the North Sea. The levels of the lakes dropped through evaporation, while changes in worldwide hydrology caused global sea levels to rise.

The rising Mediterranean finally spilled over a rocky sill at the Bosporus. The event flooded of land and significantly expanded the Black Sea shoreline to the north and west. According to these researchers, of water poured through each day. The Bosporus valley roared and surged at full spate for at least 300 days. They argued that the catastrophic inflow of seawater resulted from an abrupt sea-level jump that accompanied the Laurentide Ice Sheet collapse and the ensuing breach of a bedrock barrier in the Bosporus strait.

===Popular press accounts===
Popular discussion of this early Holocene Black Sea flood scenario was headlined in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in December 1996 and later published as a book. In a series of expeditions widely covered by mainstream media, a team of marine archaeologists led by Robert Ballard identified what appeared to be ancient shorelines, freshwater snail shells, drowned river valleys, tool-worked timbers, and man-made structures in roughly of water off the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey.

== Late Pleistocene Great Flood hypothesis ==
In 2003 and 2007, a more ancient catastrophic flood scenario was proposed by Andrei L. Chepalyga for the Late Quaternary sea level rise of the Black Sea. The hypothesis for a Late Pleistocene Great Flood argues that a brackish Neoeuxinian Lake, which occupied the Black Sea basin, was rapidly inundated by glacial meltwater overflow from the Caspian Sea via the Manych-Kerch Spillway shortly after the Late Glacial Maximum, about 17,000–14,000 BP. These extensive meltwater flooding events linked several lacustrine and marine water bodies, starting with the southern edge of the Scandinavian Peninsula and southward, through spillways to the Manych-Kerch and Bosphorus, ultimately forming what has been referred to as the Cascade of Eurasian Basins. This event is argued to have caused a rapid, if not catastrophic, rise in the level of the Black Sea. It might have imposed substantial stresses upon contemporary human populations and remained in cultural memory as the &quot;Great Flood&quot;. The authors also suggested that the event might have stimulated the beginning of shipping and horse domestication.

==Black Sea gradual inundation hypothesis==
In addition to the early Holocene &quot;Noah&#x27;s Flood&quot; scenario proposed by Ryan, Pitman, Dimitrov, and their colleagues and the Caspian Sea overflow scenario of Chepalyga, the non-catastrophic &quot;progressive flood model&quot; (or &quot;gradual inflow model&quot;) has been proposed to explain the Late Quaternary sea level history of the Black Sea.

About 8,000 YBP, the level of the Marmara Sea would have risen high enough for two-way flow to start. The evidence used to support this scenario includes the disparate ages of sapropel deposition in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea; buried back-stepping barrier islands observed on the Black Sea shelf; and an under-water delta in the Marmara Sea, near the Bosporus Strait, composed of Black Sea sediments.

== Counter-arguments ==
Criticisms of the deluge hypothesis hinge on two main lines of arguments. The first mainly focuses on the water level of the Black Sea: if the magnitude and pace of the rise of the Black Sea level was moderate enough, or if it even outpaced the rise in the Aegian basin (with water flowing, when they reconnected, from the former to the latter as it does now), or if the straits were already opened (at a lower level than now) and the two basin already connected at the time of the hypothesised flood, the catastrophe hypothesis is voided. The second is the lack of archaeological evidence one would expect of a flood, such as impact on geology, wildlife or humans. 

In any case, a few key points should be noted:
* Since the end of the last glacial period, the global sea level has risen some .
* The flood hypothesis hinges on the geomorphology of the Bosporus since the end of the glacial age. The Black Sea area has been isolated and reconnected many times during the last 500,000 years.

Opponents of the deluge hypothesis point to clues that water was flowing out of the Black Sea basin as late as 15,000 years ago.

In this alternative scenario, much depends on the evolution of the Bosphorus. According to a study from 2001, the modern sill is below sea level and consists of Quaternary sand over-lying Paleozoic bedrock in which three sills are found at below sea level. Sedimentation on these sills started before 10,000 years ago and continued until 5,300 years ago.

A large part of the academic geological community also continues to reject the idea that there could have been enough sustained long-term pressure by water from the Aegean to dig through a supposed isthmus at the present Bosphorus or enough of a difference in water levels, if at all, between the two water basins.

In 2007, a research anthology on the topic was published which makes much of the earlier Russian research available in English for the first time and combines it with more recent scientific findings.

The level in the Black Sea before the marine reconnection was estimated to have been below present sea level, rather than of the catastrophe theories or even lower; if the flood occurred at all, the sea level increase and the flooded area during the reconnection were significantly smaller than previously proposed. Since the depth of the Bosphorus, in its middle furrow, at present varies from , with an average depth of , a calculated Stone Age shoreline in the Black Sea lying lower than in the present day would imply that the contact with the Mediterranean might never have been broken during the Holocene, and hence there could have been no sudden waterfall-style transgression. The flooding could have been &quot;not so big&quot;.

In 2011, several authors concluded that &quot;there is no underwater archaeological evidence to support any catastrophic submergence of prehistoric Black Sea settlements during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene intervals&quot;.

A 2012 study based on process length variation of the dinoflagellate cyst &quot;Lingulodinium machaerophorum&quot; shows no evidence for catastrophic flooding. 
Geophysical, geochronological, and geochemical evidence points to a &quot;fast transgression&quot; of the submergence lasting between 10 and 200 years.

A 2022 literature review concluded that there was insufficient evidence for a flood scenario. It was more likely that the waters of the Black Sea &quot;itself&quot; gradually outflowed to the Mediterranean. There was also no archaeological evidence of humans evacuating the area during the relevant time frame.

<doc id="1187650" wikidata="Q39180" url="?curid=1187650" title="George Vassiliou">
<text>George Vassiliou (; born 20 May 1931) is a Cypriot politician, who served as President of Cyprus from 1988 to 1993. He was also the President of United Democrats from 1996 to 2005 and Member of the Cypriot House of Representatives from 1996 to 2001. Prior to entering politics, he was a successful businessman. 

As President, he oversaw a successful period of both social and economic reform. This included the dismantling of the system of gathering information on politically active citizens. He sought to find a diplomatic solution to the Cyprus Problem, but was unable to do so and ultimately lost re-election. 

==Early life==
Vassiliou was born in Famagusta, British Cyprus, to a Greek Cypriot family. His father, Vasos, was a member of the central committee of the Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL), the Cypriot communist party. He was a doctor by profession, and volunteered as a doctor on the side of the Communists in the Greek Civil War. During the civil war, the rest of the Vassiliou family settled in Hungary. 

Vassiliou himself went to university in Hungary and was a student of Imre Nagy. He fled Hungary following the Soviet invasion and continued his studies at the University of London. In 2018, György Markó&#x27;s book The Rambo of Pest revealed that Vassiliou was a spy of the counter-intelligence in the Rákosi era, and after 1956 he was an inforant for the Ministry of Interior under the name &#x27;Gergely&#x27;, and he reported on the economist János Kornai, among others.

==Presidency==
He was elected president as an independent candidate with support from AKEL in 1988, succeeding Spyros Kyprianou, who had served two presidential terms. During his time in office, Cyprus experienced economic growth and he was responsible for a number of reforms including stopping the police practice of keeping files on Cypriot citizens&#x27; political beliefs. He worked towards a negotiated solution to the Cyprus dispute based on the Ghali set of ideas, although the dispute remained unresolved by the time he left office in 1993.

==Post-presidency==
After he lost the 1993 elections to Glafkos Klerides, he founded the Free Democrats Movement and he was elected president of the party. He was elected member of the Cypriot Parliamient, while his political party won two seats (out of 56) in the Parliamentary Elections in 1996. The same year the party was merged with the political party ADISOK and formed a new party United Democrats. He was also elected president of the United Democrats and remained its leader until 2005. In the Parliamentary Elections of 2001, his party lost one of its seats and he wasn&#x27;t re-elected. After the Cyprus referendum of 2004, in which he was a strong supporter of the Annan Plan, he resigned from the presidency of United Democrats due to the population&#x27;s rejection of the plan.

Vassiliou was the Chief Negotiator of Cyprus for its accession to the European Union from 1998 to 2003.

==Political ideology==
He is a strong supporter of European unity and recently co-signed George Soros&#x27; open letter calling for more European unity amidst the currency turmoil surrounding the increased usage of the Euro as a single currency for the continent. Vassiliou takes active part in international political and social organisations and events. He is currently a member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation, jointly chaired by Poland&#x27;s ex-President Aleksander Kwaśniewski and President of the European Jewish Congress Viatcheslav Moshe Kantor. ECTR is designed to monitor tolerance in Europe and prepare recommendations to national governments and IGOs in respect of fighting xenophobia, extremism and anti-Semitism.

==Personal life==
Vassiliou has three children and is married to Androulla Vassiliou.

In 2014, Vassiliou published a book about his life before presidency called &#x27;Odyssey&#x27;. In 2015, he began writing a sequel to his book about his life as president of Cyprus.

<doc id="1187657" wikidata="Q764933" url="?curid=1187657" title="Osiedle Mickiewicza, Białystok">
<text>Osiedle Mickiewicza is one of the districts in the Polish city of Białystok. It is located in the south-central part of the city and is named after poet Adam Mickiewicz.

==History==
Significant part of the district is occupied by the Zwierznicki National Forest which was used for several centuries as undeveloped territories adjustcent to the Branicki Palace. In the 19th century the area became under development with the construction of the Nowik Factories. In the second half of the 19th century, the Russians built a road to Baranowicze, using part of the former Slonim route, today&#x27;s Mickiewicza Street. During the 19th century fields and meadows were urbanized over several decades, sold off, divided or consolidated and transformed either into plots designated for residential development or for factories.

In the interwar period was developed on the basis of a detailed development plan from 1932 prepared by the Białystok City Council. The area of the estate, approximately five hectares in size, stretched at that time on the area located near the Nowik factory and two ponds marking the former Warsaw route, in the vicinity of which the Nowe tavern was located in the 18th century. In the 1870s, a machine and casting factory of Adolf Święcicki and Antoni Wieczorek operated nearby, referred to as the Krzywe Settlement. According to the original plans, the estate was to be one of the first examples of a satellite estate in Białystok, modelled on the garden city concept developed by the British urban planner Ebenezer Howard. In the interwar period, the most densely built-up part of the estate was the area between Jagiellońska and Drewniana streets (including Folwarczna, Bednarska, Lwowska streets). The layout of the district&#x27;s main routes (Mickiewicza, Jagiellońska, Pod Krzywa and Zwierzyniecka streets) has been preserved to this day, between which parallel estate streets run. A large part of the pre-war buildings has been preserved in this part, with the dominant feature being the building of the former primary school, maintained in the spirit of native architecture characteristic of the 1920s. However, most of the pre-war buildings were demolished, rebuilt and modernized. Among the notable buildings that have survived are wooden villa at 7 Pod Krzywą Street, built in 1934 in the functionalist style, which housed the first Białystok radio station just after the war. In addition 22 Gdańska Street, built in the style of functional modernism. Among the buildings on Pod Krzywą Street, the wooden electric mill (at no. 11/1), built in 1947 entered into the register of monuments of the Podlaskie Voivodeship in 2010.

In the spring of 1945, the administration of the penal and investigative prison in Białystok signed a lease agreement with the City Council for 10.5 ha of land located at the then Szosa Zambrowska (currently Ciołkowskiego street), in the area of Letniska street. The lease agreement was extended several times, at least until 1947. According to witness accounts, as well as intelligence documents of underground independence organizations, this area was used for individual burials of victims of communist crimes, and perhaps also for executions. Residents mark some of these places with images of the Mother of God attached to trees.

<text>Anne Thérèse Guérin (2 October 1798 – 14 May 1856), designated by the Vatican as Saint Theodora, was a French-American saint and the foundress of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, a congregation of Catholic sisters at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana. Pope John Paul II beatified Guérin on 25 October 1998, and Pope Benedict XVI canonized her a saint of the Catholic Church on 15 October 2006. Mother Guérin&#x27;s feast day is 3 October, although some calendars list it in the Roman Martyrology as 14 May, her day of death.

Guérin immigrated to Indiana from France in 1840, and became known for her advancement of education, especially in Indiana and in eastern Illinois; founding numerous schools including Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana; and for her care of the orphaned, the sick, and the poor of the Diocese of Vincennes, Indiana.

==Early life and education==
Anne-Thérèse Guérin was born on 2 October 1798, in the village of Étables-sur-Mer in Brittany, France, to Laurent Guérin, an officer in the French Navy under Napoleon Bonaparte, and Isabelle (Lefèvre) Guérin. Anne-Thérèse was born near the end of the French Revolution, which led to the Reign of Terror and the establishment of the French First Republic. This period of significant change also caused a crisis within French Catholicism, when schools and churches were closed, and many Catholic priests chose exile over death from the guillotine.

Laurent and Isabelle Guérin had four children, two sons (Jean-Laurent and Laurent-Marie) and two daughters; however, only Anne-Thérèse and her younger sister, Marie-Jeanne, survived to adulthood. The Guérin sisters were mostly educated at home by their mother and later by a relative who lived with the family.

Anne-Thérèse knew from an early age that she would devote her life to serving God. At the age of ten, when she was allowed to take her First Communion two years earlier than the custom of the time, she confided to the priest in Etables that she wished to enter a religious community when she was older.

When Guérin was fifteen, tragedy struck the family. Bandits robbed and killed her father as he was traveling home to visit his family. The grief proved to be too much for Isabelle Guérin, who already had lost two children, and she fell into a deep depression. The teenaged Anne-Thérèse accepted the responsibility of caring for her mother and sister, as well as the family&#x27;s home and garden. When her sister became old enough to take on household tasks, Anne-Therese took sewing jobs and work in a factory to help support the family. Around the age of twenty, Guérin asked for her mother&#x27;s blessing to join a religious order, but Isabelle was still unable to cope with her loss and refused. Five years later, Isabelle recognized the depth of Anne-Thérèse&#x27;s devotion to God and permitted her to leave home to join a convent.

===Entering religious life===
On 18 August 1823, Guérin entered the Sisters of Providence of Ruillé-sur-Loir congregation and was given the religious name of Sister Saint Théodore. She professed first vows 8 September 1825, and perpetual vows, which at the time were optional, on 5 September 1831.

Sister Saint Théodore spent her early career as an educator, beginning as a teacher at Preuilly-sur-Claise in central France. In 1826, she began serving as a teacher and superior at the Saint Aubin parish school in Rennes before her transfer to a school at Soulaines in the Diocese of Angers. She began to study medicine and remedies under a local doctor. She ministered to the needs of the area&#x27;s sick and poor and received a medal for her teaching from the inspector for the Academy of Angers. While working in France, Sister Saint Théodore became seriously ill, most likely with smallpox. Although she recovered, the illness damaged her digestive system. As a result, Sister Saint Théodore could only eat a simple, bland diet for the rest of her life.

==Emigration from France to Indiana==
In 1839, the Most Reverend Simon William Gabriel Bruté, the first bishop of the vast Diocese of Vincennes in Indiana, sent Vicar General Célestine Guynemer de la Hailandière as a representative to their native France. Bishop Bruté searched for a religious congregation to come to the diocese to teach, provide spiritual instruction, and assist the sick. With only a few priests and a significant influx of Catholic immigrants of French, Irish, and German descent, the diocese needed additional help with its expanding ministry. Bishop Bruté knew the great assistance that a religious order could provide, having worked with Mother Elizabeth Ann Seton and her Sisters of Charity during the founding and early years of Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Emmitsburg, Maryland.

In June 1839, while Hailandière was in France, Bishop Bruté died at Vincennes, Indiana; Hailandière, his successor, was consecrated a bishop of the diocese on 18 August 1839. One of Bishop Hailandière&#x27;s first acts was to ask the Sisters of Providence of Ruillé-sur-Loir to send a group of sisters to establish a ministry in Vincennes. Mother Mary, the superior general of the congregation, suggested Sister Saint Théodore for the task. Although Guérin was unsure of her ability to complete such a mission initially, she agreed after considerable discernment. Guérin later remarked that a sentence from the Rule of the congregation convinced her to answer the call to immigrate to the United States: &quot;The Congregation being obliged to work with zeal for the sanctification of souls, the sisters will be disposed to go to whatsoever part of the world obedience calls them.&quot;

==Founding a new order in Indiana==
On 15 July 1840, Sister Saint Théodore and five companions (Sister Olympiade Boyer, Sister Saint Vincent Ferrer Gagé, Sister Basilide Sénéschal, Sister Mary Xavier Lerée, and Sister Mary Liguori Tiercin) departed from France to sail to the United States. After a nearly two-month-long journey across the Atlantic Ocean, the six women traveled by steamboat and stagecoach to reach the dense forest of Indiana.

On 22 October 1840, Guérin and her companions arrived at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, a small, remote village in the wilderness in Vigo County, a few miles northwest of Terre Haute. For several months the sisters lived in a small frontier farmhouse with the Thralls family, along with a few postulants who had been waiting for them when they arrived. Only later did she learn that her French superiors had already decided the sisters in the United States should form a new religious congregation under her leadership. Guérin became known as Mother Théodore.

==Life work==
===Educator===
In July 1841, less than a year after they arrived in Indiana, and despite their meager resources, Mother Théodore and the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods opened Saint Mary&#x27;s Academy for young women. The academy was the forerunner of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College. Guérin had doubts that the new institution would succeed. 
As she reflected in her journals, &quot;It is astonishing that this remote solitude has been chosen for a novitiate and especially for an academy. All appearances are against it.&quot;

From the time of her arrival at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods in July 1840 to January 1849, Mother Théodore worked with Catholic parishes to establish parish schools at several sites within the Diocese of Vincennes. In 1843, Guérin traveled to France on a fundraising trip. Bishop Hailandière established two schools in Indiana while Guérin was traveling in France and assigned them to the Sisters of Providence to operate: St. Peter-Montgomery (1843) and Saint Mary Female School-Vincennes (1843).

Guérin personally directed the establishment of Saint Joseph School (1842) in Jasper; Saint Anne&#x27;s Academy (1844) in Madison; Saint Augustine&#x27;s (1846) in Fort Wayne; and Saint Vincent&#x27;s Academy (1849) in Terre Haute, Indiana; as well as a school in Saint Francisville, Illinois. After her return to the United States from a fundraising trip to France, Guérin and the Sisters of Providence established six other schools in Indiana: two in Evansville, Saint Joseph&#x27;s Academy (1853) and Assumption (1853); Saint Patrick&#x27;s (1853) in North Madison; Saint Mary&#x27;s (1853) at Fort Wayne; Saint Mary&#x27;s (1854) at Lanesville; and Saint Bartholomew (1855) at Columbus. 

In addition to establishing schools, Mother Théodore and the Sisters of Providence cooperated with Bishop John Stephen Bazin, Hailandière&#x27;s successor, and Bishop Jacques-Maurice de Saint-Palais, Bazin&#x27;s successor, in the establishment of two orphanages in Vincennes and free pharmacies at Vincennes and Saint Mary-of-the-Woods.

===Business and congregation leader===
Guérin proved to be a skilled businesswoman and leader and a beloved general superior and spiritual leader of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. She arranged to purchase a local farmhouse belonging to the Thralls family to serve as the congregation&#x27;s first convent at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. She oversaw the construction of a new Providence convent, which was formally dedicated on 7 August 1854. During the final years, Guerin was planning to build a new chapel at the convent in honor of the Blessed Virgin; however, she did not live to see it completed. The Church of the Immaculate Conception (Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana), her last major project, was completed in 1886.

Despite numerous challenges and hardships during the congregation&#x27;s early years, which included rebuilding after destructive fires and crop failures, prudent use of limited finances, and negotiating disagreements with Catholic leaders, Guérin remained devoted to her work and the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods endured. By the time of her death in May 1856, the Sisters of Providence congregation in Indiana had grown from its original six sisters and four postulants to sixty-seven professed members, nine novices, and seven postulants.

===Death===
Guérin suffered from poor health for most of her adult life; however, her final illness began in March 1856. Guérin died on 14 May 1856 at the motherhouse at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, at fifty-seven.

The &quot;Catholic Telegraph and Advocate&quot; of Cincinnati, Ohio, published the following notice about Mother Théodore&#x27;s death:

Guérin&#x27;s remains were buried on 15 May 1856 in the Sisters of Providence Cemetery at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana. Her grave is marked with a Celtic cross that bears an inscription in Latin, translated as: &quot;I sleep, but my heart watches over this house which I built.&quot; In 1907, Guérin&#x27;s remains were moved to the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, although some of her remains are still buried at the original gravesite.

==Veneration==
===Cause for sainthood===
In 1907, Guérin&#x27;s remains were exhumed from the convent cemetery and moved to the crypt at the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Saint Mary of the Woods. At that time, Bishop Francis Silas Chatard, the first bishop of the Diocese of Indianapolis and a medical doctor before becoming a priest, examined the remains of Mother Théodore. When Bishop Chatard found the brain had not fully decomposed after fifty-one years in the grave, he asked three other physicians to examine his findings. This phenomenon was the first physical sign to consider Guérin&#x27;s life and service to the people of the area worthy of further investigation. In 1909, after reviewing the medical reports on Guérin&#x27;s remains, Chatard introduced the Cause for Canonization, the first step in the extensive process of declaring saints in the Roman Catholic Church. During the early phase of the process, twenty-four individuals provided personal accounts of their experiences with Guérin. Theologians approved her spiritual writings on 28 July 1926 and 28 February 1940.

On 25 October 1998, after the first miracle attributed to Guérin was accepted, Pope John Paul II beatified and bestowed the title of &quot;Blessed&quot; on Mother Théodore. In his comments, the Pope recognized her as a &quot;holy woman of God&quot; and &quot;a woman for our time&quot; who &quot;lived a life of extraordinary love.&quot; On 1 July 2006, Pope Benedict XVI gave his final approval for her canonization as a saint after agreeing with the consensus view that a second miracle had occurred due to Guérin&#x27;s intercession. The canonization ceremony was held on 15 October 2006, in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square, Vatican City. Mother Théodore was given the official name of Saint Theodora Guérin.

===Miracles attributed to Guerin===
The first miracle attributed to Guérin is said to have occurred in 1908. Before going to bed on 30 October, Sister of Providence Mary Theodosia Mug prayed at Guérin&#x27;s crypt in the Church of the Immaculate Conception on the motherhouse grounds at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods for another sister who was ill. However, Mug herself suffered from damaged nerves in both arms and her right hand, breast cancer, and an abdominal tumor. When she awoke the next day, Sister Mary Theodosia was able to move her arms without pain, and the lump in her abdomen had disappeared. The cancer never returned. Sister Mary Theodosia died of old age in 1943 at the age of eighty-two.

The second of the miracles attributed to Guérin involves Phil McCord of Terre Haute, Indiana, and occurred in January 2001. McCord, who had worked in facilities management for the Sisters of Providence, stopped by the Church of the Immaculate Conception and was drawn in by music from the pipe organ. After entering the church, McCord felt compelled to pray to Guérin, asking for strength to undergo surgery, a cornea transplant for his right eye to improve his failing eyesight (Previous eye surgeries did not fully restore his eyesight, which had deteriorated to a legally-blind status of 20–800 in one eye and 20–1000 in the other.) McCord returned to his home, and when he awoke the next morning, his vision, although still blurry, had improved. A follow-up visit with his eye doctor confirmed that McCord no longer needed the cornea transplant. With subsequent laser treatment, McCord&#x27;s eyesight returned perfect, 20-20 vision. Ophthalmologists and others investigating the case could find no medical explanation for the change in his condition. In 2006 the Catholic cardinals at the Vatican reviewed and approved the findings in the case and declared the event a miracle, paving the way for the final step in Guérin&#x27;s canonization process.

==Legacy==
Guérin rose above numerous personal and professional challenges, such as ideological differences and financial disagreements with other Catholic leaders, frail health, and primitive living conditions in the Indiana wilderness, as well as religious, gender, and cultural prejudice. Guérin also broke barriers for women&#x27;s education when she and the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods opened an academy for young women in Indiana in 1841. The academy is the forerunner to the present-day Saint Mary-of-the-Woods College, the oldest Catholic women&#x27;s liberal arts college in the United States. In addition to being a capable businesswoman and school administrator, Guérin was a prolific writer whose journals provide details of her life and work. Still, her greatest legacy is the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, the congregation she founded in 1840, and its ongoing ministries.

===Sisters of Providence congregation===

More than 5,200 women have entered the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods congregation since its founding in 1840. As of 2010, there are nearly 400 sisters in the order. Roughly 300 of them live and minister from the motherhouse grounds at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana. 

Guérin was working on plans for constructing a new chapel for the Sisters of Providence at the end of her life, but she did not live to see the completion of the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods. The Sisters of Providence maintain various relics of Guérin&#x27;s life in their congregation archives at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, as well as in a Heritage Museum in Providence Center on the motherhouse grounds and the Shrine of Saint Mother Théodore Guérin, which is accessed through the Providence Center.

==Honors and tributes==
===Shrine of Saint Mother Theodore Guérin===
In October 2006, shortly before her canonization, Saint Theodora Guérin&#x27;s remains were moved from the crypt to the sanctuary of the Church of the Immaculate Conception on the motherhouse grounds at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana. The Shrine of Saint Mother Theodore Guérin is located beneath the Blessed Sacrament Chapel near the Church of the Immaculate Conception. The shrine was dedicated in October 2014 under the administration of general superior Sister Denise Wilkinson. It includes a small, simple chapel where Guérin&#x27;s remains rest in a coffin made of walnut wood from the Sisters of Providence grounds. There are also several rooms in the shrine that contain historical artifacts, relics, photos, and information about Guérin&#x27;s life and the early days of the Sisters of Providence.

<text>Admiral Sir Charles Hardy ( – 18 May 1780) was a Royal Navy officer, politician and colonial administrator who sat in the House of Commons of Great Britain between 1764 and 1780. He served as governor of New York from 1755 to 1757. 
==Early career==
Born at Portsmouth, the son of Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Hardy, Charles Hardy joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer in 1731.

He became a captain in the Royal Navy on 10 August 1741, around the age of 27. His first command was the 24-gun , stationed off the British Carolinas from January 1742 to February 1744. In 1744 he was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of the British colony of Newfoundland, though there is no record of his visiting it during his term in office. In 1745 he took command of HMS &quot;Torrington&quot;, assisting in the protection of a convoy which brought reinforcements from Gibraltar to the newly captured fortress of Louisbourg.

He was knighted in 1755 and served as governor of the Colony of New York from 1755 to 1757 (replaced by James Delancey). During his term he was made Rear-Admiral of the Blue.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==

In 1757, under the command of Vice Admiral Francis Holburne, Hardy escorted Lord Loudoun and his army from New York to Halifax intending to attack Louisbourg, but the attack was called off when Louisbourg was found to be strongly defended by a French fleet. The next year, he was second in command under Admiral Edward Boscawen at the successful Siege of Louisbourg.

That autumn, he and James Wolfe attacked French posts around the mouth of the St. Lawrence River and destroyed all of the French fishing stations along the northern shores of what is now New Brunswick and along the Gaspé Peninsula. He also participated in Hawke&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759.

Hardy served as the governor of Greenwich Hospital from 1771 to 1780. In 1778, he was made Admiral of the White. In 1779 he became Commander-in-Chief of the Channel Fleet, remaining in that post until his death in May 1780.

==Member of Parliament==
Hardy sat as Member of Parliament for Rochester from 1764 to 1768 and for Plymouth from 1771 to 1780.

==Personal life==
In 1749 he married Mary Tate, however she died the next year without issue and left her home Delapré Abbey to Hardy which he sold in 1764 to Edward Bouverie for £22,000. Following his first wife&#x27;s death, he married Catharine Stanyan, the daughter of Temple Stanyan. Through Catherine, he inherited Temple Stanyan&#x27;s estate at Rawlins, Oxfordshire.

The couple had three sons and two daughters. Sir Charles Hardy died at Spithead. He bequeathed £3000 to each of the sons and £4000 to each daughter, as well as leaving his estate to his eldest son Temple Hardy. By Catharine&#x27;s death in 1801, only Temple survived of the three sons. Hardy&#x27;s brother Josiah was a merchant and the Governor of New Jersey from 1761 to 1763.

<doc id="1187668" wikidata="Q16981987" url="?curid=1187668" title="Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad">
<text>The Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad is a historic railroad that operated in the southwest portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.

It connected Middletown, Butler County with Middletown Junction, Warren County, a distance of 14 miles.

The company&#x27;s predecessor, the Middletown and Cincinnati Railway Company, was organized on February 28, 1890, by Middletown industrialist Paul Sorg and others who were dissatisfied with the service provided to Middletown by the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railroad and the Cincinnati and Springfield Railroad. The new line was charted to provide more accessible facilities and provide better connections to Cincinnati.

The line was completed in December 1892. Beginning at a depot on Clinton Street in Middletown, the line ran southeast through Lemon Township near Oakland, crossed into Warren County east of Monroe into Turtlecreek Township and continued into Union Township. At Hagemans Crossing, about twelve miles southeast of Middletown, the line crossed the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway, then a narrow gauge railroad. This part of the line was roughly the route of the Warren County Canal. The line continued two miles southeast, crossing the Little Miami River on a 365-foot truss bridge, into Hamilton Township where it terminated on the Little Miami Railroad at Middletown Junction, between Kings Mills and South Lebanon. The route was very level, having a maximum grade of 0.46 percent.

The railroad was constructed largely on borrowed money and in 1894 it went into receivership. On October 20, 1894, it was sold at auction to the original owners, who had lent it considerable sums. It was reincorporated on December 24, 1894, as the Middletown and Cincinnati Railroad Company. Following the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s acquisition of the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway in 1896, the CL&amp;N on June 3, 1902 bought the M&amp;C for $400,000 and merged it into the CL&amp;N.

Following the bankruptcy of the Pennsy&#x27;s successor, the Penn Central company, the line became the property of Conrail in 1976. Conrail later sold the Middletown to Hagemans Crossing section to the Indiana and Ohio Railroad. The I&amp;O operates freight service to Lebanon and Mason via the track and formerly operated an excursion train to Monroe from Mason. The track southeast of U.S. Route 42 at Hagemans Crossing has been abandoned, the rails lifted, and the right-of-way sold to the City of Lebanon.

== Rail trail ==
The most southeasterly section, between Columbia Road and Middletown Junction has been converted to the Lebanon Countryside Trail by the City of Lebanon. The trail opened in the fall of 2005. The bridge is being used to link the trail to the Little Miami Bike Trail.

<text>Skorupy is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok, located in the eastern part of the city and contains industrial and residential buildings. 

==History==
In the 15th century, the area of the village of Skorupy belonged to the Białystok estate, which was received in the 30s of that century by a descendant of the boyars of Lithuania, Raczko Tabutowicz of Łabędź. The village of Skorupy was first recorded in 1633 during a visit to the Białystok Roman Catholic couple. All locations that were under the clerical authority of the presbytery in Bialystok were indicated. Were it not for sale in 1528 and inclusion within the boundaries of the Zabłudów estate, the Dojlidzkie estate with the village of Skorupa would remain in the Bielsko poviat of the Podlasie voivodeship and in 1569 it would pass along with the Białystok estate to the Polish Crown. However, after the Union of Lublin in 1569, the border between the Białystok and Zabłudów estates, which since 1513 was the border between the Podlasie and Trotsk provinces, became the border between the Polish Crown and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. There was an administrative border, since from 1569 both countries were merged into a single union. Nevertheless, until 1795, the village of Skorupy was in the Grodno poviat of the Trotsky province of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while Białystok remained in the Bielsko poviat of the Podlasie province in the Polish Crown. The border ran today with the Podlega, Środkowa, Kapralska, Dalka and Skorupska doul streets. Warszawska and nearby ul. E. Orzeszkowej leads along the Biała River to ul. Jagiellonian.

In Teki Glinki there is a mention from 1748 about the construction of a boyar boy&#x27;s cottage in Skorupy and mention of the village of Skorupy belonging to the Sobolewski estate from 1772. In the 18th century, Skorupy was a large boyar village with 29 houses. They lived here quite numerous treasury craftsmen working for the court. The proximity of Bialystok was favorable craft development. 

The act of measuring the land of the villages of Skorupy with the villages of Halickie and Zaścianki was prepared in 1864, while the broadcasting act of purchased land Białostocko-Sokólski Poviat Court, specifying the list of owners and area of surplus along with the full value of the purchase, was issued in February 1868. A total of 26 peasants received over 422 tithes of different categories of land.

Industry in Skorupy appeared already in the 1860s together with the construction of a textile plant by Albrecht Adolfai Scharlotta Zoi from Riedlów Reich from the Polish Kingdom. It is not known when exactly the Reichs arrived in Białystok. In the 1920s and 1830s, the couple lived in Ozorków, a small town in the Zgierz poviat, where Albrecht worked as a dyer.

Before 1869, Reicho acquired land from Aleksander Kruzensztern, located between the Biała River and the road to Zabłudów (today ul. Nowowarszawska), west of the former development of the village of Skorupy (today partly estates at Nowowarszawska street).

The development of Bialystok in terms of demographics and economics after 1944 left its mark on the former village of Skorupy, where within a few decades new arable land in the suburbs began to develop at a rapid pace, spilling out of wastelands often planless, chaotic and in uncontrolled manner. This concerned especially the areas located east of the center of the former village between the old streets of Zaścieńska, Zbożowa and Kujawska, where a real thicket of single-family houses situated on plots arose, perpetuating with its characteristic outline and arrangement the old ownership divisions. Serious spatial changes in the former village of Skorupy also occurred in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century with the emergence of large investments - large-scale housing estates (Piasta I and Piasta II) and the construction of new urban thoroughfares, including today&#x27;s ul. Piastowska and Jana Klemens Branicki. Construction movement after 1989 is continued by private entrepreneurs.

The area of the Skorupy district was defined by the Resolution of the Miejska Rada Narodowa in Białystok (city parliament in the communist period) of November 31, 1959 on establishing the districts of the city of Bialystok: currently the Skorupy district is concluded
is within: railway track to Krynki, Szosa Zambrowska, Biała river and Dolistówka river. Skorupska street is an old trail along which the land border ran
between the villages of Bojary and Skorupy.

<doc id="1187675" wikidata="Q146403" url="?curid=1187675" title="Polyvinyl fluoride">
<text>Polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) or –(CH2CHF)n– is a polymer material mainly used in the flammability-lowering coatings of airplane interiors and photovoltaic module backsheets. It is also used in raincoats and metal sheeting. Polyvinyl fluoride is a thermoplastic fluoropolymer with a repeating vinyl fluoride unit, and it is structurally very similar to polyvinyl chloride.

== History ==
The PVF-based film was first commercialised in 1961 by DuPont under the name Tedlar.

== Polymerization ==
The most widely used polymerizations of VF are in aqueous suspensions or emulsions. High pressures are required because of the VF volatility. The high electronegativity of fluorine makes the polymerization more difficult when compared to other vinyl halides. The polymerization temperatures range from 50 °C to 150 °C and can affect the crystallinity, melting point and branching of the product. Initiation is done by peroxides or azo compounds.

The resonance stabilization of the propagating intermediate (VF radical) is poor, which often leads to monomer reversals, branching and chain-transfer reactions. The presence of impurities greatly affects the molecular weight and thermal stability of the product, as the VF radical is highly reactive. This also limits the choice of polymerization mediums, surfactants, initiators or other additives.

=== Suspension polymerization ===
The liquid VF is suspended in water and stabilized either by water-soluble polymers based on cellulose or polyvinyl alcohol. Inorganic salts can also act as stabilizers. The suspension polymerization is usually initiated by organic peroxides (eg diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate), but UV light or ionizing radiation can also be used. However, when there are no radicals present, the UV radiation decomposes the VF into acetylene and HF.

=== Emulsion polymerization ===
Emulsion polymerization can be done at highly reduced pressures and lower temperatures compared to suspension polymerization. The improved process control and reaction heat removal lead to increase in molecular weight, rate of reaction and yield. Fluorinated surfactants such as perfluorinated carboxylic acids maintain a high rate of reaction even after 40% conversion, they are thermally and chemically stable and their incorporation does not impair PVF properties. Other emulsifiers (fatty alcohol sulfates, alkane sulfonates etc) are not as effective.

== Processing ==
PVF is usually converted into thin films and coatings. However, due to its hydrogen bonds and crystallinity, a temperature above 100 °C is necessary to dissolve PVF in latent solvents. The processing by melt extrusion depends on the latent solvation of PVF in highly polar solvents and its subsequent coalescence. The incorporation of additives (plasticizers, pigments, stabilizers etc.) is done by dispersion with PVF in the latent solvent. The solvent is evaporated after extrusion.

To create biaxially oriented films, the PVF dispersed in solvent must be trailed by both transverse directions and biaxial orientations, which results in higher tensile strength. The unoriented films are also slightly stretched after casting. They are more compliant and formable and exhibit higher elongation at break than the oriented films. 

== Properties ==
The majority of linkages in PVF are head-to-tail, and only 12-18 % of linkages are head-to-head. These irregularities are probably the cause of the variations in melting point, which ranges from 185 °C to 210 °C. The crystallinity of PVF ranges from 20 to 60%, depending on the polymerization method and thermal history of the polymer. It has been found that lower polymerization temperature leads to a decrease in head-to-head linkages and subsequently increase in melting point since the highly regular structures display higher crystallinity. As for stereoregularity, PVF is mostly atacic, but this does not significantly affect the melting point. The commercial atactic PVF film shows a melting point peak at 190 °C.

Several transition phases occur below the melting point, mainly at lower &quot;T&quot;g from -15 to ‑20 °C, and at upper &quot;T&quot;g with the temperature range of 40 to 50 °C.

PVF is insoluble in common solvents below 100 °C. When the temperature is raised, it becomes soluble in polar solvents (amides, ketones etc.). At room temperature, the PVF films are resistant to both acids and bases as well as aliphatic, aromatic and alcohol liquids.

The thermal stability of PVF is better than that of other vinyl halide polymers, reporting backbone cleavage and HF loss in an inert atmosphere at 450 °C, while in air the HF loss occurs at 350 °C.

== Safety ==
Since PVF has exceptional thermal stability, it is far safer than PVC, which degrades more easily. If PVF degradation happens, the highly reactive HF acid is generated but is quickly absorbed into the surrounding materials and dissipates.

The monomer, VF is flammable and highly reactive, forms an explosive mixture with air and is classified as &quot;probably carcinogenic to humans&quot;.

PVF has not caused any skin reaction or toxic effects, although after excessive exposure the fluoride content in urine increased. The overheating of PVF products may result in interaction with the additives such as pigments or fillers, which may pose as an additional risk. Some formulations of the Tedlar films may contain heavy metal compounds, which can be present in dust created by secondary operations (eg sanding).

Exterior and interior PVF finishes do not create an additional danger regarding fire in residential and industrial buildings, because the carbon monoxide created by the combustion of other construction materials is far more dangerous.

== Application ==
The main applications of PVF are protective and decorative coatings, thanks to its thermal stability, and general inertness towards chemicals, corrosives and staining agents. There are two ways to apply PVF, either as a preformed film (laminating) or from dispersion (coating). These coatings can be transparent or pigmented.

In the automotive industry, PVF primer is used to improve paint adhesion, while in the aerospace engineering industry, the PVF film is applied to insulating bags containing glass fibre, which are used on exterior airplane walls, in cargo space and air condition ducts.

On the top of photovoltaic cells, the transparent PVF film protects against moisture, while the white-pigmented film is used on their bottom surface.

PVF films are non-adhering to phenolic, acrylic and epoxy resins and can be therefore used as release films, usually in high-temperature processing of these resins.

<text>Dojlidy is a district of the Polish city of Białystok, formerly a village and farmlands. It is also known for its brewery, plywood factory (Fabryka Sklejek Biaform SA) and the Dojlidy fish ponds and recreation areas on the White River reservoirs. Until 1954 there was a Gmina Dojlidy, after which point it was incorporated into the city. District with the largest area in Bialystok.

==History==
In contrast to Białystok, which until the Third Partition of Poland in 1795 was part of the Kingdom of Poland, Dojlidy, belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

According to the 1921 census, the population of Dojlidy was 95.3% Polish and 4.7% Belarusian.

==Name==
The term Dojlidy comes from the Lithuanian word &quot;dailidė&quot; meaning carpenter, which makes it possible to speculate that Dojlidy was a settlement of carpenters, which in turn is confirmed by the forest character of the area. This concept was presented by prof. Michał Kondratiuk. A similar origin of the name Dojlid is also indicated by Andrzej Danieluk, underlining the Old Belarusian root of the loanword from Lithuanian –word &quot;dojlida&quot; meaning carpenter (in modern Belarusian &quot;дойлід&quot; means &quot;architect&quot;).

<text>Colonel Archie Cecil Thomas White (5 October 1890 – 20 May 1971) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and education==
White was born on 5 October 1890 in Boroughbridge, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. His father, Thomas White (also Wright; 1838-1911), was thrice married and worked as a draper, grocer and outfitter. His mother, Jeannie Finlayson ( 1852-1924), was Scottish. Archie was educated at the Municipal Secondary Day School, Harrogate. Having been awarded a scholarship, he studied English literature at King&#x27;s College, London, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1913. While at university, he was a cadet of the Officers Training Corps.

==Military service==

On 12 September 1914, White was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in the British Army. Having been assigned to the 6th (Service) Battalion, Alexandra, Princess of Wales&#x27;s Own (Yorkshire Regiment), he was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 10 December 1914. 

White was 25 years old, and a temporary captain in what was later known as the Green Howards, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC during the First World War:

During the period 21 September to 1 October 1916 at Stuff Redoubt, France, Captain White was in command of the troops which held the southern and western faces of a redoubt. For four days and nights by skilful disposition he held the position under heavy fire of all kinds and against several counterattacks. Although short of supplies and ammunition, his determination never wavered and when the enemy attacked in greatly superior numbers and had almost ejected our troops from the redoubt, he personally led a counter-attack which finally cleared the enemy out of the southern and western faces.

On 30 June 1917, he was transferred to the General Staff as a general staff officer (grade 3). On 28 March 1918, he was appointed brigade major of the 137th Brigade commanded by J. V. Campbell VC. He returned to the General Staff as a GSO 3rd grade on 25 April 1919.

On 25 November 1920, White transferred to the Army Education Corps with a permanent commission and the rank of major. On 8 January 1925, he was appointed commandant of Queen Victoria School, a boarding school in Dunblane. He rose achieved the rank of colonel. He wrote a history of the corps, published in 1963.

==Commemoration==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Green Howards Museum in Richmond, North Yorkshire, England.

A book on his life and that of his school friend and fellow VC Donald Simpson Bell called &quot;A Breed Apart&quot; by Richard Leake was published by Great North Publishing in 2008. &quot;The story of White and Bell deserves to be known by a wider audience. To have two school friends both awarded the VC on the same battlefield is probably unique in British military history,&quot; said Richard Leake.

<doc id="1187681" wikidata="Q145526" url="?curid=1187681" title="Polychlorotrifluoroethylene">
<text>Polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE or PTFCE) is a thermoplastic chlorofluoropolymer with the molecular formula , where &quot;n&quot; is the number of monomer units in the polymer molecule. It is similar to polytetrafluoroethene (PTFE), except that it is a homopolymer of the monomer chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) instead of tetrafluoroethene. It has the lowest water vapor transmission rate of any plastic.

== History ==
It was discovered in 1934 by Fritz Schloffer and Otto Scherer who worked at IG Farben Company, Germany.

== Trade names ==
After World War II, PCTFE was commercialized under the trade name of Kel-F 81 by M. W. Kellogg Company in early 1950s. The name &quot;Kel-F&quot; was derived from &quot;Kellogg&quot; and &quot;fluoropolymer&quot;, which also represents other fluoropolymers like the copolymer poly(chlorotrifluoroethylene-co-vinylidene fluoride) (Kel-F 800). These were acquired by 3M Company in 1957. 3M discontinued manufacturing of Kel-F by 1996.

PCTFE resin is now manufactured under different trade names such as Neoflon PCTFE from Daikin, Voltalef from Arkema, and Aclon from Honeywell. PCTFE films are sold under the tradename Aclar by Honeywell. Other current and former trade names of PCTFE include Hostaflon C2 from Hoechst, Fluon from ICI, Plaskon from Allied Chemical Corporation, Halon from Ausimont USA, and Ftoroplast-3 in the USSR and Russian Federation.

== Synthesis ==
PCTFE is an addition homopolymer. It is prepared by the free-radical polymerization of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) and can be carried out by solution, bulk, suspension and emulsion polymerization.

== Properties ==
PCTFE has high tensile strength and good thermal characteristics. It is nonflammable and the heat resistance is up to 175 °C. It has a low coefficient of thermal expansion. The glass transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g) is around 45 °C.

PCTFE has one of the highest limiting oxygen index (LOI). It has good chemical resistance. It also exhibits properties like zero moisture absorption and non wetting.

It does not absorb visible light. When subjected to high-energy radiation, it undergoes degradation like PTFE. It can be used as a transparent film.

The presence of a chlorine atom, having greater atomic radius than that of fluorine, hinders the close packing possible in PTFE. This results in having a relatively lower melting point among fluoropolymers, around 210–215 °C.

PCTFE is resistant to the attack by most chemicals and oxidizing agents, a property exhibited due to the presence of high fluorine content. However, it swells slightly in halocarbon compounds, ethers, esters and aromatic compounds. PCTFE is resistant to oxidation because it does not have any hydrogen atoms.

PCTFE exhibits a permanent dipole moment due to the asymmetry of its repeating unit. This dipole moment is perpendicular to the carbon-chain axis.

== Differences from PTFE ==

PCTFE is a homopolymer of chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE), whereas PTFE is a homopolymer of tetrafluoroethylene. The monomers of the former differs from that of latter structurally by having a chlorine atom replacing one of the fluorine atoms. Hence each repeating unit of PCTFE have a chlorine atom in place of a fluorine atom. This accounts for PCTFE to have less flexibility of chain and hence higher glass transition temperature. PTFE has a higher melting point and is more crystalline than PCTFE, but the latter is stronger and stiffer. Though PCTFE has excellent chemical resistance, it is still less than that of PTFE. PCTFE has lower viscosity, higher tensile strength and creep resistance than PTFE.

PCTFE is injection-moldable and extrudable, whereas PTFE is not.

== Applications ==
PCTFE is used primarily for two properties: water repulsion and chemical stability. 

PCTFE films are used as protective layers against moisture. These include:
* moisture barriers in pharmaceutical blister packaging
* water-vapour barriers for protecting phosphor coatings in electroluminescent lamps (the phosphor chemicals are sensitive to moisture)
* protection of liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels, which are sensitive to moisture

Due to its chemical stability, it acts as a protective barrier against chemicals. It is used as a coating and prefabricated liner for chemical applications. PCTFE is also used for laminating other polymers like PVC, polypropylene, PETG, APET etc. It is also used in tubes, valves, chemical tank liners, O-rings, seals and gaskets.

PCTFE is used to protect sensitive electronic components because of its excellent electrical resistance and water repulsion. Other uses include flexible printed circuits and insulation of wires and cables.

Low-molecular-weight PCTFE waxes, oils and greases find their application as inert sealants and lubricants. They are also used as gyroscope flotation fluids and plasticizers for thermoplastics.

PCTFE is used for cryogenic seals and components. The cryogenic and liquid gas sector uses mainly PCTFE seals as this material has low gas absorption and good resistance to temperatures below -200 °C.

<doc id="1187683" wikidata="Q7308929" url="?curid=1187683" title="Reginald of Durham">
<text>Reginald of Durham (died c. 1190) was a Benedictine monk and hagiologist, a member of the Durham Priory and associated with Coldingham Priory in Scotland.
The details of his life are uncertain, but he was &quot;apparently of English descent&quot; and had joined the monks at Durham by around 1153. He was active in the 1160s and 1170s, spending time in Finchale with the hermit and saint Godric, and writing the works for which he is now known. It is thought that the time spent in Coldingham came later, after 1188, though again this is not certain – an alternative explanation for the association with Coldingham is that it was his birthplace, though this is considered less likely.

Two lengthy works on saints are attributed to Reginald. The first is an account of the life of Godric—including his taming influence on the snakes of Finchale that eventually nestled by his fireside—and the miracles that followed the saint&#x27;s death. The second is a collection of 129 posthumous miracles attributed to the 7th-century saint Cuthbert, such as those associated with St Cuthbert&#x27;s Well. The stated purpose of his &quot;libellus&quot; or &quot;little book&quot;, kept near Cuthbert&#x27;s shrine in Durham Cathedral, was to honour Cuthbert; it was also in the interests of the monastic community in Durham to maintain the cult of Cuthbert when that of the 12th-century saint Thomas was growing in Canterbury. A much shorter work concerned another 7th-century saint, Oswald, a martyred King of Northumbria. All three of these works included contributions by Aelred of Rievaulx, who encouraged and aided Reginald&#x27;s work. 

A fourth work may have been the basis of a sermon about St Ebba (615–683), however the sermon itself is not in the style associated with Reginald. According to Tudor, that style could &quot;degenerate into almost incomprehensible turgidity&quot;, but his desire for detail and capacity for close observation made him capable of &quot;extremely vivid evocation of contemporary conditions&quot;.

<text>Nowe Miasto is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok.

==History==
The area of today&#x27;s Nowe Miasto got its name in the 1980s but its territory was the location of old settlements such as the village Słoboda. It was founded at the end of the 17th century between today&#x27;s Pogodna and Świerkowa streets, around. It had about 11–12 houses. At the end of the 18th century, the village was a linear village located on the right (eastern) bank of a now non-existent, nameless stream, a tributary of the Horodnianka River. The layout of its buildings at that time, with houses facing the street with their gables might hint that it was regulated during the Volok Reform. The village buildings were located in the area of today&#x27;s Emilii Plater street and the parallel section of today&#x27;s Sławińskiego street. Residents were probably exempt from taxes hence the name Sloboda (liberty). 

In May 1919 the village was included in Greater Białystok and designated as &quot;garden city&quot; which was then divided into building plots in 1925, an official colony. It is part of the architectural assumption of this colony laid out according to the assumptions of the Garden City. The Central Square of the Garden City is located at the intersection of Pułaskiego Streets (then Żurawie), Wspólna and Strzelecka. After the Second World War, there were about 50 houses in Słoboda.

The Nowe Miasto district was founded at the beginning of the 20th century, hence the distinctive name. The area of the modern Nowe Miasto district was defined by the City National Council resolution in Białystok of November 31, 1959 on the establishment of the districts of the city of Białystok: composed of Nowe Miasto, Swoboda, Bażantarnia and the former village of Starosielce. The borders run Kopernika and Zwierzyniecka Road, Świerkowa, Wiosenna, Zambrowska Road, along the tracks by rail from Bielsko to Południowa Avenue. The former village of Horodniany bordered on the south from in the village of Starosielce. The southern border of the village of Starosielce with the property of Horodyniany ran along Rzymowskiego, Wschodnia streets along the border with Białystok estate, along Zachodnia street. The latter got its name as it was the western border of the Białystok. The border than was parallel to today&#x27;s Składowa street up to Depowa street, then from this point along a curved line towards today&#x27;s Marczukowska Street, from where the direction of the border changed again to today&#x27;s Popiełuszki Street and the petrol station, and from there back towards Rzymowskiego Street. Currently, the Nowe Miasto district also includes Kawaleryjska, Świerkowa, Kopernik, Ciołkowskiego streets (formerly Szosa to Zielona). These are the areas belonging once to the village of Swoboda (Słoboda).

<text>Zielone Wzgórza is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok.

==History==
The district was constructed from the mid 1980s. Alongside with the construction of the buildings, the then pastor of the Catholic parish of st. Andrzej Bobola in Starosielce, he initiated the construction of a new church at the junction of Słoneczny Stok and Zielone Wzgórza. In 1984, the faithful began to pray in a makeshift chapel. Two years later, the construction of the St. Jadwiga Church, designed by Marian Szymański.

The dominant type of buildings within Zielone Wzgorza are four-floor apartment buildings with balconies, and small business area on the 1st floor of the outside wall of the buildings set-up in the shape of a letter &quot;U&quot;. In the middle of each U-shaped grouping of buildings there are parking lot, recreational area for small children, trash disposal, and place to clean rugs and carpets as well as low growing coniferous trees and grass. Each unit within a given building is assigned a basement cell as well as parking space.

<text>The Estadio Nemesio Camacho El Campín, commonly known as El Campín, is the main stadium of Bogotá, Colombia. It was inaugurated on 10 August 1938 and has a capacity of 39,512 spectators. It is the home ground of the Categoría Primera A teams Millonarios and Santa Fe.

The stadium is named after Nemesio Camacho, former manager of the then-existing streetcar system of Bogotá and also the father of Luis Camacho Matiz, the person who offered the land where the stadium would be constructed. The name Campín comes from a modification of the word &quot;camping&quot; because the area where the stadium currently stands was formerly a camping zone. It entered service as a football stadium around 1946, just in time to host the first national club tournament. It was used as the venue for the 2001 Copa América final, where the Colombian team were crowned champions of the American continent, defeating Mexico 1–0. This stadium was one of the eight stadiums of the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup held in Colombia, also hosted its closing ceremony. It also hosts matches of the 2024 FIFA U-20 Women&#x27;s World Cup, including the final.

==History==
In 1934, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, then-mayor of Bogotá, had the idea to build a stadium for the pleasure of the citizens of Bogotá, taking advantage of the occasion provided by Bogotá&#x27;s 400th anniversary, and also to host the 1938 Bolivarian Games. Until the opening of Estadio El Campín, the only major football ground in the city was the relatively small &quot;La Merced&quot; ground. Shortly after, then-councilman Luis Camacho offered a land to the city of Bogotá where the new stadium could be constructed.

At the time of the first Colombian Professional Football championship (1948 Campeonato Profesional), the stadium&#x27;s capacity was of 23,500 seated persons. The stadium has been remodeled many times, and although the stadium&#x27;s maximum capacity reached a maximum of 62,500 at 1968, capacity has since been decreased over time through various renovations.

The first game hosted at El Campín was a soccer match between Ecuador and Colombia, on August 10, 1938; Colombia lost 2–1. Millonarios has called El Campín their home ground since 1938, Santa Fe has played there since 1951. El Campín has been used several times to host matches of the Colombia national team, most notably the Copa América 2001 final against Mexico. El Campín was one of the many football grounds that could have been affected by FIFA&#x27;s decision to forbid playing international football in places located above 2500 meters above sea level, but FIFA has since allowed international FIFA games in this stadium.

==Concerts==
Until the field was renovated in 2005, many musical concerts were held in the stadium. Concerts and other cultural events were soon banned to protect the grass on the field. Concerts were then held at the Simón Bolívar Park, Palacio de los Deportes Arena, Movistar Arena, Plaza de Toros de Santamaria, Jaime Duque Park and Corferias.

December 15, 2011 the Congress approved a law that requires mayors to provide the use of stadiums in all Colombian cities at least once a month. Days later president Juan Manuel Santos approved the law. In consequence, since 2012 the stadium can be used again as venue for cultural events and it opens the possibility for great international singers to perform in Bogotá in 2012.

The Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Sport and the Institute for Recreation and Sport (IDRD), utilized various techniques to determine the impact of large events on the grass of the sports arena. Tests simulated the effects of a large crowd on the field. &quot;The first stage of the test consisted of pruning, surveying, geotechnical engineering and agronomy of 100 square meters of turf,&quot; said District. Also installed were protective devices that distributed weight and allowed photosynthesis to occur. Next a stage was installed and 400 graduates of the police auxiliary took the field, under which were placed the various turf protection elements, until a density of four persons per square meter was achieved, which is the density typical of large events. The staff entered at 4:00 pm and stayed until 10:00 pm.

March 8, 2012 the Ministry of Culture, Recreation and Sport confirmed that the stadium would again, after a 4-year pause, host concerts and cultural events. On March 15, 2012 concert producer Fernan Martinez and Bogotá Mayor (Gustavo Petro) confirmed that Paul McCartney would perform during his On the Run Tour on April 19, 2012 at the stadium. On March 27 at 4:00 p.m. tickets for the concert became available in TuBoleta and at 5:30 p.m. 75% of the tickets were already sold. It is expected for the show to sold all the tickets in less than 24 hours. On March 27 tickets started to be sold at 4:00 p.m. and one hour and a half later 75% of the tickets were already sold. 24 hours after 90% of the tickets were already sold.

Lady Gaga performed as part of her The Born This Way Ball on November 6, 2012 at the stadium in front of 30,546 people.

Justin Bieber performed on October 29, 2013 in the stadium during his Believe Tour

British boyband One Direction performed at the stadium for the first time in Colombia on April 25, 2014 during their Where We Are Stadium Tour 2014. Tickets for the show sold out in a record time, prompting concert producers to add an extra 6,000 tickets which also sold out the first day they became available for a total of 36,386 tickets sold by December 21, 2013.

Shakira holds the artist record for most events held at the stadium, having performed 5 shows since her first tour. In 2025, she will return to the stadium with 2 shows of Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour, extending her record as the most show in the venue&#x27;s history with 7 shows. 

The Foo Fighters performed for the first time in Colombia at the stadium on January 31, 2015.

The Rolling Stones performed for the first time in Colombia during their Olé Tour on March 10, 2016 at the stadium in front of an estimated 45,000 people.

Coldplay performed at the stadium on April 13, 2016 as part of their A Head Full of Dreams Tour for a sold out stadium of 41,376 people. They came back to the stadium on September 16 and 17, 2022 as part of their Music of the Spheres World Tour for a sold out crowd of 88,314 featuring opening act Camila Cabello.

U2 performed for the first time in Colombia as part of their Joshua Tree Tour 2017 on October 7, 2017, also to an estimated audience of 45,000 people.

The Weeknd performed at the stadium on 4 October 2023 as part of his After Hours til Dawn Tour for an audience of 35,386 people.

Guns N&#x27; Roses performed at the stadium on November 29, 1992 during the band&#x27;s Use Your Illusion Tour.

The same band returned almost 30 years later, and performed on October 11 and 12, 2022, both being sold outs, as part of their We&#x27;re F&#x27;N&#x27; Back! Tour. An estimated of over 85,000 people attended during those two dates. 
Colombian rock band Aterciopelados opened for them.

<doc id="1187691" wikidata="Q146339" url="?curid=1187691" title="Polyvinyl alcohol">
<text>Polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH, PVA, or PVAl) is a water-soluble synthetic polymer. It has the idealized formula [CH2CH(OH)]&quot;n&quot;. It is used in papermaking, textile warp sizing, as a thickener and emulsion stabilizer in polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) adhesive formulations, in a variety of coatings, and 3D printing. It is colourless (white) and odorless. It is commonly supplied as beads or as solutions in water. Without an externally added crosslinking agent, PVA solution can be gelled through repeated freezing-thawing, yielding highly strong, ultrapure, biocompatible hydrogels which have been used for a variety of applications such as vascular stents, cartilages, contact lenses, etc.

Although polyvinyl alcohol is often referred to by the acronym PVA, more generally PVA refers to polyvinyl acetate, which is commonly used as a wood adhesive and sealer.

==Uses==
PVA is used in a variety of medical applications because of its biocompatibility, low tendency for protein adhesion, and low toxicity. Specific uses include cartilage replacements, contact lenses, laundry detergent pods and eye drops. Polyvinyl alcohol is used as an aid in suspension polymerizations. Its largest application in China is its use as a protective colloid to make PVAc dispersions. In Japan its major use is the production of Vinylon fiber. This fiber is also manufactured in North Korea for self-sufficiency reasons, because no oil is required to produce it. Another application is photographic film.

PVA-based polymers are used widely in additive manufacturing. For example, 3D printed oral dosage forms demonstrate great potential in the pharmaceutical industry. It is possible to create drug-loaded tablets with modified drug-release characteristics where PVA is used as a binder substance.

Medically, PVA-based microparticles have received FDA 510(k) approval to be used as embolisation particles to be used for peripheral hypervascular tumors. It may also used as the embolic agent in a Uterine Fibroid Embolectomy (UFE). In biomedical engineering research, PVA has also been studied for cartilage, orthopaedic applications, and potential materials for vascular graft.

PVA is commonly used in household sponges that absorb more water than polyurethane sponges.

PVA may be used as an adhesive during preparation of stool samples for microscopic examination in pathology.

===Polyvinyl acetals===
Polyvinyl acetals are prepared by treating PVA with aldehydes. Butyraldehyde and formaldehyde afford polyvinyl butyral (PVB) and polyvinyl formal (PVF), respectively. Preparation of polyvinyl butyral is the largest use for polyvinyl alcohol in the US and Western Europe.

==Preparation==
Unlike most vinyl polymers, PVA is not prepared by polymerization of the corresponding monomer, since the monomer, vinyl alcohol, is thermodynamically unstable with respect to its tautomerization to acetaldehyde. Instead, PVA is prepared by hydrolysis of polyvinyl acetate, or sometimes other vinyl ester-derived polymers with formate or chloroacetate groups instead of acetate. The conversion of the polyvinyl esters is usually conducted by base-catalysed transesterification with ethanol:
: [CH2CH(OAc)]&quot;n&quot; + C2H5OH → [CH2CH(OH)]&quot;n&quot; + C2H5OAc

The properties of the polymer are affected by the degree of transesterification.

Worldwide consumption of polyvinyl alcohol was over one million metric tons in 2006.

==Structure and properties==
PVA is an atactic material that exhibits crystallinity. In terms of microstructure, it is composed mainly of 1,3-diol linkages [−CH2−CH(OH)−CH2−CH(OH)−], but a few percent of 1,2-diols [−CH2−CH(OH)−CH(OH)−CH2−] occur, depending on the conditions for the polymerization of the vinyl ester precursor.

Polyvinyl alcohol has excellent film-forming, emulsifying and adhesive properties. It is also resistant to oil, grease and solvents. It has high tensile strength and flexibility, as well as high oxygen and aroma barrier properties. However, these properties are dependent on humidity: water absorbed at higher humidity levels acts as a plasticiser, which reduces the polymer&#x27;s tensile strength, but increases its elongation and tear strength.

==Safety and environmental considerations==
Polyvinyl alcohol is widely used, thus its toxicity and biodegradation are of interest. Tests showed that fish (guppies) are not harmed, even at a poly(vinyl alcohol) concentration of 500 mg/L of water.

The biodegradability of PVA is affected by the molecular weight of the sample. Aqueous solutions of PVA degrade faster, which is why PVA grades that are highly water-soluble tend to have a faster biodegradation. Not all PVA grades are readily biodegradable, but studies show that high water-soluble PVA grades such as the ones used in detergents can be readily biodegradable according to OECD
screening test conditions.

Orally administered PVA is relatively harmless. The safety of polyvinyl alcohol is based on some of the following observations:
* The acute oral toxicity of polyvinyl alcohol is very low, with LD(50)s in the range of 15-20 g/kg;
* Orally administered PVA is very poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract;
* PVA does not accumulate in the body when administered orally;
* Polyvinyl alcohol is not mutagenic or clastogenic

<text>Geoffrey Saxton White VC (2 July 1886 – 28 January 1918) was an English Royal Navy officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Educated at Bradfield College, he was in September 1902 appointed a naval cadet on the armoured cruiser HMS &quot;Aboukir&quot;, serving with the Mediterranean Fleet.

He was 31 years old, and a Lieutenant-Commander during the First World War when he won the VC.

===The VC action===
On 28 January 1918 in the Dardanelles, Turkey, Lieutenant-Commander White, commanding British submarine &quot;E.14&quot; was under instructions to find the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot;, which was reported to be aground. She was not found, however, and &quot;E.14&quot; turned back. Then came the following sequence of events, for which White was posthumously awarded the VC on 24 May 1919:

White&#x27;s body was not recovered at the time, and he has no known grave. He is commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial.

<text>Voice leading (or part writing) is the linear progression of individual melodic lines (voices or parts) and their interaction with one another to create harmonies, typically in accordance with the principles of common-practice harmony and counterpoint. These principles include voices sounding smooth and independent, generally minimising movement to common tones as well as steps to the closest chord tone possible, therefore minimising leaps where possible. As a result, different voicings and inversions of chords may provide smoother voice leading.

Rigorous concern for voice leading is of greatest importance in common-practice music, although jazz and pop music also demonstrate attention to voice leading to varying degrees.

The style of voice leading will depend on the performing medium; for example, singing a large leap may be harder than playing it on piano.

==Example==
The score below shows the first four measures of the C-major prelude from J.S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, Book 1. Letter (a) presents the original score while (b) and (c) present reductions (simplified versions) intended to clarify the harmony and implied voice leading, respectively.

In (b), the same measures are presented as four block chords (with two inverted): I – II – V – I.

In (c), the four measures are presented as five horizontal voices identified by the direction of the stems, which are added even though the notes are actually whole notes, making them look like half notes. Notice that each voice consists of just &quot;three&quot; played notes due to the ties: from top to bottom, (1) E F — E; (2) C D — C; (3) G A G —; (4) E D — E; (5) C — B C. The &quot;four&quot; chords result from the fact that the voices do not move at the same time.

==History==
Voice leading developed as an independent concept when Heinrich Schenker stressed its importance in &quot;free counterpoint&quot;, as opposed to strict counterpoint. He wrote:

He continued:
Schenker indeed did not present the rules of voice leading merely as contrapuntal rules, but showed how they are inseparable from the rules of harmony and how they form one of the most essential aspects of musical composition.

==Common-practice conventions and pedagogy==

=== Chord connection ===

Western musicians have tended to teach voice leading by focusing on connecting adjacent harmonies because that skill is foundational to meeting larger, structural objectives.
Common-practice conventions dictate that melodic lines should be smooth and independent. To be smooth, they should be primarily conjunct (stepwise), avoid leaps that are difficult to sing, approach and follow leaps with movement in the opposite direction, and correctly handle tendency tones (primarily, the leading-tone, but also the , which often moves down to ). To be independent, they should avoid parallel fifths and octaves.

Contrapuntal conventions likewise consider permitted or forbidden melodic intervals in individual parts, intervals between parts, the direction of the movement of the voices with respect to each other, etc. Whether dealing with counterpoint or harmony, these conventions emerge not only from a desire to create easy-to-sing parts but also from the constraints of tonal materials and from the objectives behind writing certain textures.

These conventions are discussed in more detail below.

===Harmonic roles===

As the Renaissance gave way to the Baroque era in the 1600s, part writing reflected the increasing stratification of harmonic roles. This differentiation between outer and inner voices was an outgrowth of both tonality and homophony. In this new Baroque style, the outer voices took a commanding role in determining the flow of the music and tended to move more often by leaps. Inner voices tended to move stepwise or repeat common tones.

A Schenkerian analysis perspective on these roles shifts the discussion somewhat from &quot;outer and inner voices&quot; to &quot;upper and bass voices.&quot; Although the outer voices still play the dominant, form-defining role in this view, the leading soprano voice is often seen as a composite line that draws on the voice leadings in each of the upper voices of the imaginary continuo. Approaching harmony from a non-Schenkerian perspective, Dmitri Tymoczko nonetheless also demonstrates such &quot;3+1&quot; voice leading, where &quot;three voices articulate a strongly crossing-free voice leading between complete triads [...], while a fourth voice adds doublings,&quot; as a feature of tonal writing.

Neo-Riemannian theory examines another facet of this principle. That theory decomposes movements from one chord to another into one or several &quot;parsimonious movements&quot; between pitch classes instead of actual pitches (i.e., neglecting octave shifts). Such analysis shows the deeper continuity underneath surface disjunctions, as in the Bach example from BWV 941 hereby.
==Jazz and pop music==
Contemporary styles like jazz and pop treat voice-leading with more mixed importance than common-practice composition. For example, in &quot;Jazz Theory&quot;, Dariusz Terefenko writes that &quot;[a]t the surface level, jazz voice-leading conventions seem more relaxed than they are in common-practice music.&quot; Marc Schonbrun also states that while it is untrue that &quot;popular music has no voice leading in it, [...] the largest amount of popular music is simply conceived with chords as blocks of information, and melodies are layered on top of the chords.&quot;

<text>Starosielce (lit. &quot;Old Settlement&quot;) is a district of Białystok, Poland, located in the western part of the city.

==History==

The district traces its name to the village of Starosielce that existed before 1547. The first written source in which it was mentioned was a document delimiting the Białystok church property from 29 March 1533. The name of the village may indicate its older metrics. In the second half of the 18th century, Starosielce was part of the Wysokie Stok grange belonging to Jan Klemens Branicki. At that time, there were eighteen farms there. At the end of the 18th century, the village was a linear village located on the left (western) bank of the Biała River. The layout of its buildings at that time – with houses facing the street with their gables – suggests that it was founded or regulated during the Volok Reform.

Towards the later 19th century, the development of Starosielce was closely related to the Iron Railway Repair Center established in 1872. The settlement developed quickly with people pulled to the area. The railway authorities willingly employed both newcomers from Russia who worked on the railway or in the metal industry, as well as professionals associated with the construction of the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway just before the January Uprising. Many builders also settled in Białystok and the nearby villages of Klepacze and Oliszki. Owners also came from Polish landed estates that were under the Tsarist partition. In the 1890s, Starosielce was a large village in the Białystok commune. The area of its agricultural land was 3,000 square Morgen. A third of the village&#x27;s inhabitants were Germans.

After the First World War and the victory of the newly established Poland over Soviet Russia, many legionnaire soldiers settled in Starosielce. Legionnaire Mieczysław Bieguński lived in the district and member of the city council. He was active in the social committee for the construction of the Monument of Independence, which was set up on the square next to the Białystok Starosielce railway station, and in the foundation, which through residents&#x27; contributions issued a commemorative plaque on the anniversary of the death of Józef Piłsudski. Between 1919 and 1954 Starosielce had town rights. According to the 1921 census, the population of Starosielce was 97.2% Polish, 1.7% Belarusian and 0.7% Jewish.

After the Second World War and the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland everything related to Piłsudski, his life and activities was banned. and so, the board has been hidden. In the 1970s, during the demolition of the house where Bieguński&#x27;s shop was, the workers found a cracked plaque in the basement of the house. On 1 April 1954, it was incorporated to Białystok. when it was annexed to Białystok. Later on an industrial district was developed around Elewatorska street with various enterprises including Polmos Białystok and Podlaskie Zakłady Zbożowe.

<text>Słoneczny Stok is a district in the Polish city of Białystok, located in the western part of the city. The name means literally &#x27;Sunny Slope&#x27; and is a pun on the name Białystok, which stands for &#x27;White slope&#x27;.

==History==
In the territory of the district a windmill existed in the area of today&#x27;s intersection of Hetmańska and Marczukowska streets. A pond exists there up today, was a popular place for rest before the war, along with Dojlidy Ponds.

The plan was that hat the buildings would rise along with the terrain. From the side of Hetmańska Street, low atrial and terraced houses are planned, then three-story blocks transforming into 5- and 8-story buildings. The 11-story skyscrapers were to be the culmination. Only the concept of the northern part of the estate (the area of Wincentego Witosa and Skrajna streets) changed, where - instead of houses - blocks were also built. As it is commonly known, a well known Polish dog lives in this estate, under the name of Jakub Radulski.

The district was designed in the OWT-75 technology. Elements of the system were made by the Białystok Fadom-II It was planned to populate the blocks in December 1979. Finally, it only began after the new year, on January 21, 1980. Then the keys to the apartments were collected by tenants from the block at 68 Upalna Street. Eugeniusz Truszkowski from PZPR Bialystok Voivodeship Committee and vice-president Witalis Sadowski, as well as presidents of housing cooperatives and representatives of the contractor from Kombinat Budownictwa Mieszkaniowego. The competition jury consisting of Mieczysław Chaja (deputy chief of &quot;Gazeta Współczesna&quot;), Krystyna Jaroszewicz (member of the estate design team from &quot;Inwestprojekt&quot;), Zygmunt Kramarczuk (city architect) and Zenon Masalski (deputy president of the Provincial Housing Cooperative) selected seven names, among which The readers would ultimately choose the one and the best. The seven included: &quot;Na Stoku&quot;, &quot;Słoneczny Stok&quot;, &quot;Słoneczne&quot;, &quot;Zielone Wzgórza&quot;, &quot;Na Wyżyny&quot;. &quot;Wyżyny&quot; and &quot;Nad Bażantarka&quot;. Ultimately, the most votes - although it was not stated how many - were given to the name &quot;Słoneczny Stok&quot;.

<text>Nicholas Bobadilla, SJ (c.1509 – 23 September 1590) was one of the first Jesuits. A native of Spain, he spent most of his career in Germany.

==Biography==

Nicholas Bobadilla was boirn in Spain in about 1509 and was educated at Alcalá de Henares where in 1529 he earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He taught logic at Valladolid while studying theology.

In 1533 he went to Paris to acquire a more perfect knowledge of Greek, Latin and Hebrew. Here he fell under the influence of Ignatius of Loyola while studying at the University of Paris.

Bobadilla was among the first seven followers of Loyola to consecrate themselves to God in the Chapel of Saint-Denis on Montmartre, 15 August 1534. Two years later, the group, minus Ignatius who had returned temporarily to Spain, went to Venice, hoping to embark for the Holy Land. They worked in hospitals while waiting for a ship. After two months, they went to Rome to ask papal permission for their pilgrimage and Holy orders for those not yet ordained. Bobadilla was ordained in Rome on June 24, 1537. They returned to Venice, but an impending war with the Turks delayed their departure. While Ignatius went to Rome, the rest decided to go to various university towns and preach. Bobadilla and Francis Xavier went to Bologna.

When Giovanna d&#x27;Aragona, Duchess of Tagliacozzo, left her husband, Ascanio Colonna, and took their six children to Ischia, given the rank of the parties involved, the matter stirred up controversy among the Italo-Spanish nobility and in the papal court. Ignatius sent Bobadilla to attempt to persuade her to return to her husband. When this failed, he, himself visited her, but to no avail. Nonetheless, she donated to the Jesuits land on the Quirinal Hill to build their first seminary; now the site of Sant&#x27;Andrea al Quirinale.

Bobadilla was an effective speaker and saw the early Jesuits as living as the apostles. He preferred the role of itinerant preacher to that of establishing colleges as pastoral centers, which sometimes caused a degree of friction with his colleagues. King John III of Portugal had asked Pope Paul III to send priests to the new colony in India. Ignatius chose Simon Rodrigues and Bobadilla, but the latter got sick and could not go. Xavier took his place.

He was for a time attached to the papal nunciature in Germany, serving among the armies of the Emperor Charles V. In 1540, while tending the sick in the camp about Ratisbon, he himself caught the plague, but recovered. Bishop Giovanni Morone was papal legate in Germany; in 1542 Bobadilla traveled with him to the Diet of Speyer. Later that year he was at the court of Ferdinand I, King of the Romans in Vienna and accompanied the king to the Diet of Nuremberg in January 1543.

Bobadilla spent most of his long career in Germany and Italy, using his formidable intellectual and rhetorical prowess against the spread of Protestantism. He took a prominent part in the Diet of Ratisbon in 1546. That same year, as he was returning from camp into the city, he was waylaid by assassins and severely wounded. At another time he barely escaped with his life from an attempt to poison him. He was present at the Battle of Mühlberg in 1547.

He sometimes displeased Ignatius, as when he too strenuously opposed the efforts of Charles V to make peace with the Protestants. In 1548, the Augsburg Interim was published by the Emperor. It was a tentative document intended to suggest a basis of agreement between Catholics and Protestants until their religious differences could be definitely settled. But as it seemed to the eyes of many Catholics to go to far, and in the eyes of many Protestants not far enough, it satisfied neither party. Bobadilla opposed it in speech and in writing, and so vigorously, that though he was highly esteemed in the imperial court, he was obliged, by the Emperor&#x27;s order to leave Germany.

He went to Italy and then Dalmatia before returning to Italy in 1561. The last survivor of the seven first companions of Ignatius of Loyola, Bobadilla took part in the election of four generals of the Society of Jesus. He died at Loreto, Italy, in 1590.

<text>or is a yellow citrus fruit, a cultivar that originated as a mutation of the or . It was discovered in 1935 in Tsukumi, Oita Prefecture, Japan. The original natsu mikan that served as the basis for amanatsu was found in Yamaguchi Prefecture around 1700.

== Names ==
&quot;Amanatsu&quot; means &quot;sweet summer&quot; in Japanese. In Japan, the fruit is known as , but also colloquially the &quot;amanatsu&quot;, , , and .

== Description ==
Natsumikan is about the size of grapefruit and oblate in shape. The fruit contains 12 segments and about 30 seeds. The rough textured fruit is easy to peel and is commonly eaten fresh. It is also used for wide variety of products ranging from marmalades to alcoholic beverages.

== Cultivation ==
Natsumikan is grown commercially in Japan, notably in Yamaguchi, Kumamoto and Ehime prefecture. The city of Hagi is famous for its natsumikans, particularly when used in natsumikan juice and ice cream.

Yamaguchi Prefecture takes such pride in their natsumikan industry that the typically white crash barriers of Japan were changed to a befitting orange.

== Genetics ==
The natsumikan tree is believed to be genetically derived from the pomelo (&quot;Citrus grandis&quot; or &quot;Citrus maxima&quot;).

== Medicine ==
Researchers found that immature natsumikan peel is beneficial for the treatment of chronic allergic dermatitis in mice.

<doc id="1187711" wikidata="Q7106749" url="?curid=1187711" title="Osiedle Wysoki Stoczek, Białystok">
<text>Wysoki Stoczek is one of the districts of Białystok in Poland.

==History==
The district&#x27;s name preserves the name of the village that was located in the northern part of the district. In the second half of the 18th century, Wysokistoczek was part of the Wysokie Stoczek manor farm belonging to Jan Klemens Branicki. There was a small palace and two pavilions in the territory, built on the edge of the peak and the southern slope of the elevation descending towards the bend of the Biała River valley. The nearby fishery enterprise was located on the southern edge of the marshy valley of this river. 

The southern part of the district was the location of a village called &quot;Ogrodniczki&quot;, which preserved in the name of one of the streets located in that area. In the second half of the 18th century, Ogrodniki was part of the Wysokie Stockie farmstead. At that time, it had only six farms and, unlike other villages, it did not have arable land, only gardens. At the end of the 18th century, Ogrodniki was a single-manor settlement located on the northern bank of the Biała River, on the southwestern edge of the Fichten Wald, known in Polish as Wesołowski Forest. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the settlement was called Ogrodniki Wysokostockie and belonged to the cloth manufacturer Herman Commichau. Together with the land of the Antoniuk settlement, the agricultural land of Ogrodniki Wysokostockie covered 83 tithes (approx. 90.7 ha). 

The areas of Wysoki Stoczek and Ogrodniczki were annexed to Białystok on May 10, 1919. The spatial layout of the manor and fishery enterprise was completely erased by the contemporary development of Białystok. In the place of the manor there are currently multi-family blocks at Jana Pawła II Avenue no. 59 and 59A-F. In the place of fishery enterprise, the buildings of Primary School no. 49 are located. The spatial layout of Ogrodniki Wysokostockie has been partially preserved in the layout of Ogrodniczki Street.

At the end of the 1970s, Housing Cooperative &quot;Rodzina Kolejowa&quot; started building the first part of the district, then known as &#x27;Wysoki Stoczek Południe&#x27;, in the areas of Scaleniowa, Fiedorowicza and Gromadzka streets. In accordance with the resolution of the meeting of Members&#x27; Representatives, on 1 January 1989 from part of the resources of the Wysoki Stoczek Południe estate, a new independent cooperative was created called &quot;Bacieczki&quot; in the area of Swobodna, Szeroka and Łagodna streets.

<doc id="1187714" wikidata="Q317643" url="?curid=1187714" title="Marcos Pontes">
<text>Marcos Cesar Pontes (born 11 March 1963) is a Brazilian Air Force pilot, engineer, AEB astronaut, politician and author. He became the first South American and the first Lusophone to go into space when he docked onto the International Space Station aboard Soyuz TMA-8 on 30 March 2006. He is the only Brazilian to have completed the NASA astronaut training program, although he switched to training in Russia after NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program encountered problems. After Jair Bolsonaro&#x27;s election as President of Brazil in 2018, Pontes was officially nominated to be Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, a post which he accepted days later and assumed when Bolsonaro&#x27;s government began. He left the post on 31 March 2022 and in the same year was elected federal senator for his state, São Paulo.

==Early life==
Pontes was born in the town of Bauru, in the southeastern state of São Paulo. His father Vergílio was a civil servant of the Instituto Brasileiro do Café and his mother Zuleika was clerk of the Rede Ferroviária Federal (RFFSA).

==Air Force and Space career==

Pontes is one of the most experienced jet pilots in the Brazilian Air Force (FAB), where he holds the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and has flown more than 2000 hours in 25 different aircraft. 
In June 1998, he was selected by the Brazilian Space Agency to train in the NASA space program after he acquired a space-related background in the Aeronautical Engineering division of the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (the Aeronautics Institute of Technology, or &quot;ITA&quot;). He began NASA training in August 1998 and qualified as Space Shuttle Mission Specialist in December 2000. He attended the Naval Postgraduate School of the US Navy in 1998.
Initially, Pontes&#x27; maiden space flight was scheduled to be on a Space Shuttle, where he was to help transport the ExPRESS Pallet, which would have been the International Space Station&#x27;s first Brazilian-made component, into orbit. Negotiations between NASA and AEB (the Brazilian Space Agency) fell through due to budgetary concerns. During the delay, Pontes ran a campaign to pressure the Brazilian government to complete the Express Pallet, and he worked on technical assignments in the Astronaut Office Space Station Operations Branch at NASA. His flight was postponed indefinitely when AEB confirmed that it could not produce the Express Pallet and its components for NASA.

On 2 September 2005, an agreement between the governments of Brazil and Russia was reached which provided for Pontes to train at Star City, near Moscow, to learn about the Soyuz&#x27;s operational and life-support systems, and to fly to the International Space Station in March 2006. The agreement, which cost about US$20 million was signed by the presidents of the Brazilian and Russian space agencies, Sérgio Gaudenzi and Anatoli Perminov, respectively.

Pontes&#x27; flight coincided with celebrations of the 100th anniversary of Brazilian aviation pioneer Alberto Santos-Dumont&#x27;s successful flight of a fixed-wing airplane in Paris in October 1906.

On 30 March 2006, Pontes became the first Brazilian and the first native Portuguese-speaking person to go into space, where he stayed on the International Space Station for a week. During his trip, Pontes carried out eight experiments selected by the Brazilian Space Agency. He landed in Kazakhstan on April 8, 2006, with the crew of Expedition 12.

Following the Soyuz mission, Pontes returned to his technical duties for the International Space Station Program at the Johnson Space Center, working with FIESP/SENAI-SP on the development and fabrication of the Brazilian parts for the ISS.

Pontes entered the reserve of the Brazilian Air Force and awaits a new space mission. He is also an Invited Researcher at the Institute for Advanced Studies of the University of São Paulo at São Carlos. He is an ambassador of UNIDO and WorldSkills. Pontes opened an educational foundation and a tourism agency together with the future Brazilian space tourist Marcos Palhares, who will be traveling to space through the Virgin Galactic.

Pontes announced his intention to visit space a second time back in 2009.

==Political career==
In his 2011 book &quot;Missão Cumprida&quot;, he also declared that he is interested in a possible candidacy for an unspecified political post in Brazil and he tried to be elected as &quot;Deputado Federal&quot; during the 2014 São Paulo gubernatorial election. In the 2018 São Paulo gubernatorial election he was elected side with Major Olímpio as second alternate in the Senate.

On 31 October, Jair Bolsonaro announced that he would be the next Minister of Science and Technology. This choice left the scientific community with polarized opinions, ranging from how the public sees the profession of astronaut in connection with science and the fact that the minister is not an active scientist and researcher, in addition to concern about his lack of political articulation.

===Minister of Science===
After the disclosure of data on deforestation in the Amazon by INPE, discredited by Bolsonaro, Marcos Pontes called the then President of Inpe Ricardo Galvão to address the way he has been acting in the media and also declared to share &quot;...the strangeness expressed by our President Bolsonaro...&quot;. no matter how much he doesn&#x27;t believe the data to be false.

On 7 August 2019 the resignation of Ricardo Galvão was published after his resignation on 2 August. He was exonerated at the request of Bolsonaro. Directors of research centres linked to the Ministry asked Pontes to intercede on behalf of Galvão, something that did not happen.

Military Darcton Policarpo Damião was chosen to take over Inpe on an interim basis.

In July 2020, he tested positive for COVID-19.

In a survey published by Veja magazine in October 2021, it was revealed that the minister had made 107 international trips, had stayed 1 in 3 days away for travel among his nearly 1000 days in office, had spent more than R$500,000 (US$ ), and was the minister in the Bolsonaro government who traveled abroad the most. This travel expense becomes relevant after he criticized the government for cutting R$600 million (US$ ) from the Science and Technology Ministry.

==Works==
Besides his work as an astronaut and Air Force commander, Marcos also authored four books:

*

He also writes articles on his website. The main themes are motivation and space travel.

==Controversies==
===Critics from National Congress===
In 2006, Marcos Pontes returned to Brazil after the Missão Centenário, deciding to enter the Aeronautics reserve. In this sense, the repercussion around the situation became very wide, due to the indignation that was demonstrated by the National Congress. At first, the Palácio do Planalto, AEB (Brazilian Space Agency) and Aeronautics expected that Pontes could offer a stimulus factor to the space program and to new adhesions to the Armed Forces, as well as mentoring and training to new astronauts, justifying an investment of 10 million dollars from the Federal Government, strongly defended by the Lula Government, who even talked to the astronaut in videoconference on the International Space Station: &quot;In few moments in the history of Brazil, we were proud of a Brazilian like we are of you. You, when you departed, reminded me of Ayrton Senna with the national flag,&quot; Lula said. After the decision for the inactivity of Marcos Pontes&#x27; functions, President Lula did not comment on the choice, which had several frustration pronouncements from other congressmen, such as Walter Pinheiro (PT), at the time member of the House Science and Technology Commission; Alberto Goldman (PSDB), congressman for São Paulo in 2006; Orlando Fantazzini (PSOL) and Sérgio Gaudenzi. In the view of politicians, who expected the return of astronaut learning to the Brazilian Space Program, the entity should create protection mechanisms for possible future investments in other astronauts, taking into account that the services funded by the government are not lost in the private sphere.

===Investigation by the Military Prosecutor===
In 2006, Pontes was investigated by the Military Prosecutor to determine whether he had violated Article 204 of the Military Penal Code, which prohibits active military involvement in any commercial activity. In the investigation, the MPM inquired about the website Conexão Espacial, owned by the astronaut&#x27;s press officer, Christiane Gonçalves Corrêa, then owner of the company Portally Eventos e Produções, about the sale of T-shirts and caps with the image of Marcos from 2002 until the date of his departure. In September 2017, documents were released by &quot;The Intercept&quot; newspaper, which showed Marcos&#x27; supposed status as a partner in the company, but which had always been denied by him. After the extinctive prescription of the investigation, Pontes became a majority partner of the company, with 80% of participation, while Christiane Corrêa kept 20% of participation. The mother of the advisor, who owned about 45% of the shares, left the firm after Pontes joined. In August 2018, after the investigation had already prescribed, the appeal against Pontes was tabled and filed away by Supreme Court Minister Rosa Weber.

<text>Lake Ohrid is a lake which straddles the mountainous border between the southwestern part of North Macedonia and eastern Albania. It is one of Europe&#x27;s deepest and oldest lakes, with a unique aquatic ecosystem of worldwide importance, with more than 200 endemic species.

North Macedonia&#x27;s side of Lake Ohrid was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979, with the site being extended to also include the cultural and historic area of Ohrid in 1980. In 2010, NASA named one of Titan&#x27;s lakes after it. In 2014, the Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Reserve between Albania and North Macedonia was added to UNESCO&#x27;s World Network of Biosphere Reserves. Albania&#x27;s side of Lake Ohrid was also designated UNESCO world heritage status in 2019. North Macedonia&#x27;s portion was designated as a protected Ramsar site in 2021, passing all nine criteria for proclamation.

In Albania, the coastal portion of the lake holds Managed Nature Reserve status. In North Macedonia, a portion of the lakeside is part of the Galičica National Park.

The towns situated at the lakeside are Ohrid and Struga in North Macedonia along with Pogradec in Albania. The lake is otherwise surrounded by settlements in the form of villages and resorts in both basin countries.

==Geography==

Lake Ohrid is one of the oldest lakes in the world, and with a maximum depth of and mean depth of , it is the deepest lake in the Balkans. It covers an area of and contains an estimated 55.49 cubic kilometres ( million acre-feet) of water. The lake is long and wide at its maximum extent, with a shoreline of .

64% of Lake Ohrid&#x27;s shoreline and 69% of its surface area are within North Macedonia, whereas 36% of the shoreline and 31% of the surface area fall within Albania.

==Origin==
The Ohrid and Prespa Lakes are the two largest in a north–south chain of tectonic basins (grabens) including the Korçë basin, and Lake Ioannina in North West of Greece, known as the Dessaret group. The transition from compressional to extensional tectonics in the central Balkan Mts occurred around 6 million years ago, with the oldest lake sediments being Pliocene, possibly 3-5 million years old. The &quot;Dessaret chain&quot; is a poorly developed rift valley. Worldwide, rift valley lakes with similarly ancient origins include Lake Baikal, Lake Titicaca, Lake Tanganyika and the Dead Sea. Most lakes have much shorter life spans as they rapidly fill with sediments. Lake Ohrid is being infilled at its north end by its modest main tributaries, but is preserved by its great depth, by continuing tectonic subsidence, and by the main inflows being from underground karstic channels from Lake Prespa carrying minimal sediment. The graben system is still tectonically active and Lake Ohrid sits in a seismogenic landscape, with many visible traces including fresh fault scarps, displaced sediment and soil sequences, stepped hillsides, and a hydrothermal field near Kosel. Moderate earthquakes are frequent, with the strongest yet measured here on 18 February 1911, with a magnitude 6.6 at a focal depth of 15 km, destroying houses but with no loss of life.

==Hydrology==
The lake drains an area of around 2,600 km² and is fed primarily by underground springs on the eastern shore (about 50% of total inflow), with roughly 25% shares from rivers and direct precipitation. Over 20% of the lake&#x27;s water comes from nearby Lake Prespa, about to the southeast and at 150 m higher altitude than Lake Ohrid. The water leaves Lake Prespa trickling through underground watercourses in the karstic landscape, where it is joined by mountain range precipitation and eventually emerges in numerous springs along the eastern shore and below the water surface of Lake Ohrid. The water leaves Lake Ohrid by evaporation (~40%) and through its only outlet, the Black Drin River, which flows in a northerly direction into Albania and thus to the Adriatic Sea. The relatively dry, Mediterranean climate and the small drainage basin of 2,600 km² (catchment/lake surface ratio of ~7) of Lake Ohrid results in a long hydraulic residence time scale of ~70 yr.

==Physical and geochemical properties==
The water at the surface of Lake Ohrid moves predominantly in a counter-clockwise direction along the shore, as a result of wind forcing and the Earth rotation, similar to the Ekman-phenomenon known from oceans. In terms of vertical water exchange, convective mixing during winter cooling is the dominant process. However, in an average winter only the top 150–200 meters of the lake are mixed, whereas the water below is stably stratified by salinity. The stability due to this salinity gradient allows complete convective mixing events only roughly once every 7 years.

Both in terms of nutrient concentration (4.5 μg L−1 of phosphorus), as well as biological parameters Lake Ohrid qualifies as oligotrophic. Thanks to this oligotrophy and the filtered spring inflows, the water is exceptionally clear with transparencies to a depth of as much as 22 meters (66 feet). Lake Ohrid lacks an annual deep water exchange which in other lakes can bring complete overturn; plunging rivers are also absent. Despite this, dissolved oxygen never drops below ~6 mg L−1.

== Wetland habitats ==
Previously extensive wetland habitats in the vicinity of Lake Ohrid have been lost due to conversion into agricultural or urban land. These include Struga Marsh, large portions of which were drained for agriculture in the 1940s and again in the 1960s when the River Sateska was rerouted.

Nowadays, the last remaining significant coastline wetland at Lake Ohrid is Studenchishte Marsh, which is located on the eastern shore near the city of Ohrid. Despite degradation from a variety of sources such as large-scale disposal of construction waste, major land conversion, disruption of water connections to Lake Ohrid, beach urbanization and loss of reed belts, Studenchishte Marsh is still an important buffer to prevent lake eutrophication and a key habitat for biodiversity, including relict plants and endemic species. These values, and the comparative rareness of similar habitats in Macedonia (now North Macedonia), prompted an expert team in 2012 to recommend designation of a 63.97-hectare area at Studenchishte Marsh to be protected as a Natural Monument under Macedonian law.

Changes to the General Urban Plan for Ohrid 2014–2020, however, made provisions for Studenchishte Marsh to be drained and replaced with infrastructure for tourism and water-sports, a proposal which, together with other regional developments, was opposed by numerous local and international experts, including the Society of Wetland Scientists. A Strategic Environmental Assessment also concluded that no measure except non-implementation could reduce the direct negative impact on Studenchishte and the indirect negative impact on Lake Ohrid if the proposed construction was to take place at the wetland. Plans to drain the area have subsequently been reversed and the Macedonian government announced in 2018 that it would move forward with proclamation of Studenchishte Marsh as a protected area and its designation together with Lake Ohrid as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. Ramsar status was formalized in 2021 although protection of Studenchishte Marsh at the national level has not yet been completed. 

The IUCN identifies wetland rehabilitation as one of five potential site needs for the UNESCO Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid Region. However, the potential to restore Struga Marsh, which was not included in the boundaries of the Ramsar Site, is likely to be reduced by construction of the European Corridor VIII railway, while Studenchishte&#x27;s future is yet to be fully resolved. 

==Fauna==
Measured by its surface area of 358 km², Ohrid is probably among the most biodiverse lakes on Earth. While it is special as such, by far the most spectacular quality is its impressive endemism. Similar to Lake Baikal or Lake Tanganyika, Lake Ohrid harbors endemic species covering the whole food-chain, from phytoplankton and sessile algae (20 species; e.g., &quot;Cyclotella fottii&quot;), over plant species (2 species; e.g., &quot;Chara ohridana&quot;), zooplankton (5 species; e.g., &quot;Cyclops ochridanus&quot;), cyprinid fish (8 species; e.g., &quot;Pachychilon pictum&quot;), to predatory fish (two trout species; the Ohrid trout complex &quot;Salmo letnica&quot;, and &quot;Belvica&quot; &quot;Salmo ohridanus&quot;) and finally its diverse endemic bottom fauna (176 species; e.g. &quot;Ochridagammarus solidus&quot;), with particularly large endemism among crustaceans, molluscs, sponges and planarians. There were recorded 68 species of freshwater snails from the Lake Ohrid basin. 73.5% (50 species) of the total freshwater gastropod fauna appear to be endemic to the Lake Ohrid basin. Whereas the endemic species list cited above is based on morphological and ecological characteristics, some recent applications of molecular genetic techniques underline the difference of the fauna from common European taxa, as well as the old age of the lake.

Quite remarkably, exotic species do not seem to be a major issue in Lake Ohrid, although they have been recorded in small populations for several decades or exist in nearby rivers or lakes. The reason lies very probably in the ideal adaptation of the endemic species to the specific conditions in the lake, such as low nutrient availability, good living conditions in greater depth thanks to high water transparency and oxygen content, as well as subaquatic spring inflows supplying cool and oxygen-rich water. In total, seven introduced fish species are known from the lake.

Despite the exceptionally high level of endemism in Lake Ohrid (for example, a third of the 21 native fish species and almost 80% of its 72 mollusc species are endemic), a significant number of non-endemic species are found in Lake Ohrid. This includes species, which are mobile (e.g., via water birds) or migratory, such as the European eel.

===Birds===
The lakeshore reed beds and wetlands provide critical habitat for hundreds of thousands of wintering water birds, including rare and threatened species such as the Dalmatian pelican, ferruginous duck, swan, spotted eagle, and eastern imperial eagle. The Macedonian part of the lake has been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of common coots and pygmy cormorants (&quot;Microcarbo pygmaeus&quot;). The Albanian part of the lake has been designated a separate but corresponding IBA for the same reason, with additional bird species being common goldeneyes, red-crested pochards (&quot;Netta rufina&quot;) and black-necked grebes. Wetland of International Importance status under the Ramsar Convention is underpinned in part by the biogeographically significant populations of red-crested pochard and pygmy cormorants too, but also goosander (&quot;Mergus merganser&quot;).

==Socio-economy==

The prehistoric pile-dwelling near Lin in Pogradec, Albania, is Europe&#x27;s oldest of its kind, as confirmed by University of Bern specialists. Archaeologists from Albania and Switzerland have been excavating remains on the Ohrid Lake shore and underwater. This settlement, over 8,500 years old, developed agriculture 8,000–9,000 years ago, playing a key role in spreading farming practices across Europe. The Lin site predates similar Swiss sites by over 2,000 years.

There are three cities on the lake&#x27;s shores: Ohrid and Struga on the Macedonian side; and Pogradec in Albania. There are also several fishing villages, although tourism is now a more significant part of their income. The catchment area of the lake has a population of around 170,000 people, with 131,000 people living directly at the lake shore (43,000 in Albania and 88,000 in North Macedonia). The population in the catchment has increased by 100,000 people in the last half century, putting the lake&#x27;s fragile ecosystem under pressure. 

The historic monuments, as well as the pristine lake environment, make the area around Lake Ohrid a prime site for tourism. In the 1980s, more than 200,000 national and international tourists went on a pilgrimage to the Macedonian lake side every year. During the Yugoslav crisis and particularly after the interethnic conflicts within North Macedonia in 2001, international tourism collapsed but has been slowly recovering. Even though many visitors are staying for a weekend only, tourism makes an important contribution to the local economy (~1 visitor/inhabitant).Historically, Lake Ohrid was close to a main highway of the Roman Empire, the Via Egnatia, from Durrës on the coast of Albania to Thessalonika and Constantinople (Istanbul), but now is a communications backwater. There is a minor road around the lake, with border crossings between Albania and North Macedonia. Religious monuments such as the Black Madonna south west of Struga and St Naum monastery are counterposed with ravages of war, such as the fortifications of the Macedonian Front across Galicica Mountain.

== World Heritage Site ==
The Macedonian side of Lake Ohrid was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO at the 3rd Session of the World Heritage Committee in 1979 and holds that status under Criterion VII as a superlative natural phenomenon related to its refuge function for relict and world-unique freshwater species, and its rich bird life. The lake became part of a mixed Natural and Cultural World Heritage Site in 1980 when the city of Ohrid in Macedonia was also designated with UNESCO status for its architectural, artistic and religious values.

Concern over current and potential deterioration of the World Heritage Site prompted invitation of a joint Reactive Monitoring Mission by the World Heritage Centre, IUCN and ICOMOS in April 2017, which identified a wide range of pressures including from transport infrastructure, traffic, tourism developments, overfishing, sewerage, solid waste disposal, invasive species, both legal and illegal construction, and management of water levels. The mission report devised 19 recommendations for Macedonia, which were incorporated under Decision 41 COM 7B.34 of the World Heritage Committee at its 41st Session in Krakow, Poland in 2017.

In May 2019, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre expanded the World Heritage Site to the Albanian side of the lake. In addition, draft Decision 43 COM 7B.36 was released recommending for the Ohrid region, including Lake Ohrid, to be placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger during the 43rd Session of the World Heritage Committee in Baku, Azerbaijan. This position aligns with IUCN advice. In its analysis and conclusions, the World Heritage Centre observed threats to Lake Ohrid from &quot;decreased water levels, uncontrolled discharge, water pollution due to inadequate wastewater treatment systems leading to evident eutrophication at the mouths of intake rivers, heavy pressures from tourism, and extensive uncontrolled urban development and inappropriate exploitation of the coastal zones.&quot; It also observed that the majority of recommendations from the 2017 Reactive Monitoring Mission had not been implemented.

== Science and research ==
Due to its size, accessibility and species richness, Lake Ohrid is extremely well-suited to the function of a natural laboratory. Deep sediment cores augmented by diverse ecology in the present day offer an extensive archive from which to understand the history of its region over the past 1,200,000 years.

Research to date has investigated biodiversity processes, the interplay between geological and biological evolution, the birth of European agriculture, and investigations of regional climate and environmental conditions over hundreds of thousands of years.

Among other contributions, such research has delivered the first empirical evidence for niche-based assembly processes from a natural system and demonstrated the establishment of dynamic equilibrium in an isolated ecosystem during the slowdown of both speciation and extinction rates. It has also demonstrated the importance of tree cover for buffering soil erosion during times of climate change and provided insight into the composition of regional flora through glacial and inter-glacial periods.

==Human influence==

Shore habitats are under particular pressure from human activities. Particular threats are the building of tourist facilities directly at the shore, destroying of reed belts to gain agricultural land and intense pollution close to the mouth of tributaries. Although the effects of these human impacts have not been evaluated in detail they are of great concern, as the shallow water sites are particularly rich in endemic bottom fauna and form important spawning grounds for several endemic fish species. Moreover, reed belts have great importance for water birds.

Commercial fish yield, i.e. the two endemic trout species, has dropped significantly over the past decades, both in North Macedonia and in Albania. The most probable reason is overfishing and possibly destruction of spawning grounds. Pollution may also be a factor. Although there are regulations regarding fishing practice (e.g. minimal mesh size) and only a limited number of licensed fishermen, these rules are always not obeyed as a result of the high market value of the endemic trout. As a reaction to the situation, a seven-year moratorium on fishing Ohrid trout was imposed from 2004 to help the population recover and to allow scientists to collect further data. Nonetheless, even though thorough assessment of fish stocks has not been conducted since the 1990s and trout populations are still believed to be in decline, fishing with quotas was restarted in 2012 under the auspices of a concessionaire. More data is required to determine whether these current fishing levels are sustainable and illegal fishing, particularly on the Albanian side of the lake, remains a problem.

While most of the endemic fish species are non-migratory, the European eel spawns in the distant Sargasso Sea while its offspring return to the lake. Unfortunately, as in many European lakes, it is very unlikely today that eels can reach Lake Ohrid naturally and return to the Sargasso Sea, as a result of several hydropower dams on the Black Drin and the Drin River, both in North Macedonia and Albania. As a result, eel found in Lake Ohrid are stocked populations.
Given the population growth over the past 50 years, a particular concern is the potential eutrophication of currently oligotrophic Lake Ohrid from increased pollution. Indeed, sediment cores show a ~3.5 fold increase in phosphorus concentration over the past century. On the one hand, shifts from endemic to common European species, which are better adapted to higher nutrient conditions, have already been observed close to polluted inflows. On the other hand, higher nutrient levels have reduced the water transparency, as well as the oxygen availability in the deep water and at the lake bottom, two properties which are requisite for the endemic flora and fauna. Still, the lake is in a comparably good state at the moment. However it may take more than a decade to see the effects of today&#x27;s pollution level in the lake, because of its long water residence time. Moreover, it was shown that the negative effects from eutrophication would be significantly amplified by global warming. Although there is time to react, computer simulations indicate that at least a 50% reduction in phosphorus input must be reached to keep the deep water oxygenated for the next 50 years at predicted atmospheric warming. This aim could be reached by controlling household wastewater, which is by far the biggest phosphorus source at the moment. First steps in that direction have been taken by extending and improving the existing sewage system in North Macedonia in the framework of a GEF (Global Environment Facility) program. The most important next task would be a solution for three remaining, severely polluted tributaries, one in North Macedonia and two in Albania.

== Declaration on the Protection of the Lake Ohrid Ecosystem ==
On 3 May 2018, the Society of Wetland Scientists released the Declaration on the Protection of the Lake Ohrid Ecosystem, which was passed unanimously by 45 attending members at its 13th annual European meeting. Urging Macedonian authorities to substantially enhance protection of Lake Ohrid, the declaration outlines the unique significance of the interconnected Ohrid-Prespa lake system, both for its biodiversity and relevance to research on climate and evolution, and recommends measures for future management including revitalization and enlargement of wetland areas, pollution control and a re-orientation of tourism policy. It further describes the &quot;critical importance&quot; of the last intact marsh on the Lake Ohrid shore, Studenchishte Marsh, in terms of its species composition and ecosystem services such as water quality improvement, carbon storage and flood retention among others.

==Namesakes==
Lake Ohrid is also the namesake of Ohrid Lacus, a hydrocarbon lake on the Saturnian moon Titan. It is composed of liquid methane and ethane and is located 71.8°N 221.9°W on Titan&#x27;s globe.

<text>Bacieczki is one of the districts of the Polish city of Białystok. The elevation is .

==History==
The first records about Bacieczki date back to the 16th century. It was founded as a grange around 1533. Records further they say that together with Fasty it belonged to the monastery in Supraśl. Information about the &quot;wooden church in the Bacieczki farm&quot; erected from the foundation of Prince Aleksander Chodkiewicz comes from the same period. This church was called St. Jan Theolog, the heavenly patron of the founder&#x27;s father, Ivan Chodkiewicz, who died in Turkish captivity. The church in Bacieczki existed until 1773, when for unknown reasons it was demolished and the material obtained from it was used to expand the church in Zawyki (this church has survived to this day and currently functions as a cemetery Roman Catholic church). Papers from the early 19th century mentioning the existence of two villages, Dojlidzkie and Ogrodniczki on the territory of the neighborhood.

In the place where today there is a space neighbourhood (called so because of the street names) was the Bacieczki manor. It is located in the area of Produkcyjna, Saturna and Neptuna streets.

In the 19th century, a German factory colony began in the district&#x27;s territory, around Produkcyjna Street. It was founded by the Moes family, which ran its business in Choroszcz. The history of the settlement is connected with the fact that the owners of the textile factory in Choroszcz brought twenty-two families of German weavers in the 19th century. Each of them received land, and small wooden weaving factories were created in wooden houses, some of which have survived to this day - they write in the book &quot;Evangelicals in Bialystok. Historical guide ”, the priest of the Białystok Evangelical-Augsburg parish priest Tomasz Wigłasz and Krzysztof Maria Różański.

From these times comes the Evangelical-Augsburg cemetery formerly located outside the settlement (today it is located in the forest at Produkcyjna Street, just behind the Auchan hypermarket). At the turn of the century, Bacieczki and Kolonia Bacieczki had a total of 204 inhabitants. It was the seat of the commune, and there was also a school.
In Białystok, Bacieczki did not yet appear in 1919, but only at the next expansion of the city&#x27;s administrative boundaries in 1954. It happened pursuant to the regulation of October 1953. The following disappeared from the administrative map: clusters of Bacieczki, Kolonia Bacieczki, Korycin (today around Niska Street in Leśna Dolina), as well as the city of Starosielce, whose areas increased Białystok.

The third, much younger, historical site in the area is the &quot;Fasty&quot; Cotton Combine. Its history only begins at the beginning of the 1950s. The combine took up the area between today&#x27;s Przędzalniana, Produkcyjna streets and the road to Ełk. The factory took its name from the nearby village of Fasty. Its history dates back to 1529. The first settlers were to be the family of peasants – Chwastów ( Fastów).

In the Second Polish Republic, the village was the seat of the Białostoczek Gmina.

According to the 1921 census, the village of Bacieczki had 49 houses and was inhabited by 258 people, among whom 210 declared an Orthodox denomination, while the remaining 48 were Roman Catholic. At the same time, all residents of the then Bacieczki declared Polish nationality. During this period, the village was subject to the Orthodox parish of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in nearby Fasty.

In 1929, there was one brickyard in the village, a mill of &quot;Zakłady Przemysłowych S.A.&quot; a confectionery shop, two pubs, two grocery stores and one with cold cuts. There was one midwife, a carpenter, wheelwright, blacksmith, carpenter and shoemaker.

In 1933, 633 people lived in the village.

In 1941–1943 in the forest near Bacieczki, the Germans murdered over 3,000. people. Currently, there is a Monument to the place of a mass execution in the Bacieczki Forest.

In the years 1945–1954 the town was the seat of the Bacieczki Gmina. In 1954 the village was incorporated into the boundaries of Białystok. Currently, it is a residential district consisting of blocks of &quot;Towarzystwo Budownictwa Spółdzielczy (TBS)&quot; and single-family houses.

In a plan issued in 1966 on the occasion of the Millennium of the Polish State, only a few main streets in this area are marked. These are: Szosa Ełcka (today the Narodowych Sił Zbrojnych Street), North-Regional Road (today its fragment at the height of the TBS (Kleeberga Street), Przędzalniana, Tkacka and Bacieczka. There was also a road from the Biała River to the outskirts it partly coincides with the course of today&#x27;s Komisji Edukacji Narodowe Street (on the fragment from the Church of Our Lady Queen of Families to the meadows on the Biała River). On the orthophotomap from 1976, the village buildings of Bacieczki are perfectly visible. There is also a housing estate of semi-detached houses built by the Pionier I Association on the north-west side of Bacieczki Street, as well as erected houses on the side of the school at Strażacka Street. In the place of the TBS there are long fields. In the corner, between the outskirts and the exit to Ełk, there is a farm that somehow survived to this day.
On the southern side of the outlet to Warsaw, there is a vast green complex – Bacieczki Forest.

<text>Zawady is a district (osiedle) of Białystok, Poland. It is located in the north-eastern part of the city close to National road 19 and Expressway S8.

==History==
The district&#x27;s name takes its origin from the village located there, established in the second half of the 18th century, with 25 farms and belonged to Jan Klemens Branicki. There was also an inn with a brewery in the village. At the end of this century, Zawady was a linear village located on the right (eastern) bank of the Biała River. The layout of its buildings at that time with houses facing the street with their gables suggests that it was founded or regulated during the Volok Reform. At the turn of the 20th century, Zawady was a peasant village in the commune of Białostoczek. The area of the village land covered 480 dessiatin (approx. 524.4 ha), including 175 dessiatin of meadows and pastures (approx. 191.2 ha), 5 dessiatin of forest (approx. 5.5 ha) and 34 dessiatin of wasteland (approx. 37.1 ha). The areas of Zawady were incorporated into Białystok on May 10, 1919 but the village itself incorporated into the city in 2002. According to the 1921 census, the population of Zawady was 98.5% Polish and 1.5% Belarusian. The village&#x27;s spatial layout was preserved in the contemporary district, with Zawady street as the main road which crossed the village while Liliowa and Dolna Streets are old roads that bounded the village&#x27;s yards from the east and west. In 2023 Liliowa, Orląt Lwowskich and Zamojskiego streets were paved and renovated.

<text>Field Marshal Sir George Stuart White, (6 July 1835 – 24 June 1912) was an officer of the British Army. He was stationed at Peshawar during the Indian Mutiny and then fought at the Battle of Charasiab in October 1879 and at the Battle of Kandahar in September 1880 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War. For his bravery during these two battles, he was awarded the Victoria Cross. He went on to command a brigade during the Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1886 and became commander of Quetta District in 1889 in which role he led operations in the Zhob Valley and in Balochistan. He was commander of the forces in Natal at the opening of the Second Boer War and fought at the Battle of Elandslaagte in October 1899. He commanded the garrison at the siege of Ladysmith: although instructed by General Sir Redvers Buller to surrender the garrison he responded &quot;I hold Ladysmith for the Queen&quot; and held out for another 75 days before being relieved in February 1900. He finished his career as Governor of Gibraltar and then as Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

==Early career==
White was born at Low Rock Castle, Portstewart, County Londonderry. He was the son of James Robert White of Whitehall, Broughshane, County Antrim, and Frances Ann Stewart (daughter of George Stewart (d.1808), Surgeon-General to the British Forces in Ireland, and his wife Frances Stewart of Killymoon Castle). He was educated at Bromsgrove School in Worcestershire and later at King William&#x27;s College on the Isle of Man and then at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He was commissioned an ensign in the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot on 4 November 1853.

White was sent to India in 1854 and, having been promoted lieutenant on 29 January 1855, was stationed at Peshawar during the Indian Mutiny in 1857. He was promoted captain on 10 July 1863 and transferred to the 92nd Regiment of Foot on 4 August 1863. He returned to England before being further promoted major on 24 December 1863. After five years in England he went back to India with his regiment in 1868. He was given command of his battalion in 1875 and then fought at the Battle of Charasiab in October 1879 and at the Battle of Kandahar in September 1880 during the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

==Victoria Cross==
He was 44 years old when the following deeds took place in Afghanistan for which he was awarded the VC:
White&#x27;s Victoria Cross is displayed at the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, Scotland.

==Later career==
Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in February 1881 and promoted to lieutenant colonel on 2 March, White was briefly Military Secretary to the Viceroy and Governor-General of India before being given command of the 2nd Battalion of the Gordon Highlanders in October that year. He then joined the staff in Egypt as assistant-adjutant and quartermaster-general in February 1885 with promotion to colonel on 2 March 1885.
In September 1885 White was given command of a brigade of the Madras Army and led it as the 2nd Brigade of the British Burma Division during the Third Anglo-Burmese War in November 1885. Promoted to local major general on 1 April 1886, he led the subsequent occupation of Burma as Commander of the Upper Burma Field Force in mid-1886 and was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Promoted to the substantive rank of major general on 1 July 1887, he was given command of Quetta District in April 1889 and led operations in the Zhob Valley and in Balochistan. In the 1890 New Year Honours List White was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire. Upgraded to a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire in March 1893, he became Commander-in-Chief, India with the local rank of lieutenant general in April, which was made substantive on 1 April 1895. Made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in June 1897 and a Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India the following January, White became Quartermaster-General to the Forces in October 1898.

White became commander of the forces in Natal in September 1899 at the opening of the Second Boer War and fought at the Battle of Elandslaagte in October 1899. He then withdrew to Ladysmith where he took command of the garrison during the siege of Ladysmith with his aide-de-camp Clive Dixon (later portraying the siege in watercolour): when his position there became untenable he was instructed by General Sir Redvers Buller to destroy the guns and surrender the garrison on the best terms he could. White responded &quot;I hold Ladysmith for the Queen&quot; and held out for another four months before the town was relieved in late February 1900. His health greatly reduced, White left the city in early March to recover in more peaceful parts of the colony, before he left Cape Town for the United Kingdom later the same month. For his service in the war he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) later that year, having earlier been made a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in May 1900.

White became Governor of Gibraltar in May 1900 and, in that role, was promoted to full general on 9 October 1900 and to field marshal on 8 April 1903. In 1905 he was appointed to a Commission of Inquiry into contracts placed with private contractors during the Second Boer War; he was appointed a Member of the Order of Merit later that year. He was Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea from 17 June 1905 until his death there on 24 June 1912. He was buried at Broughshane, a village in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. A statue of White is currently located at Portland Place, London, while the Sir George White Memorial Flute Band still operates in Broughshane, Ballymena.

White was also honorary colonel of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion the Prince Albert&#x27;s (Somersetshire Light Infantry) and, later, of the Gordon Highlanders.

==Family==
In 1874 White married Amelia Maria Baly, daughter of the Venerable Joseph Baly, Archdeacon of Calcutta, with whom he had one son and four daughters. James Robert (Jack) White, Rose Frances White, May Constance White (Currie), Amy Gladys Stuart White (Lady Napier) and Georgina Mary White. Lady White was invested as a Companion of the Imperial Order of the Crown of India (CI) by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 6 March 1900. In the year after her husband&#x27;s death their unoccupied house at Englefield Green was badly damaged by suffragette arsonists. Elsie Duval and Olive Beamish were the suspects.

Their son Jack White, after service in the British Army, became an Irish republican and socialist who co-founded the Irish Citizen Army along with James Connolly and James Larkin.

<text>Jack White (born Jacob Weiss; 23 December 1896 – 27 November 1949) was a British recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Background ==
White was born Jacob Weiss in Leeds on 23 December 1896 into an immigrant Russian Jewish family. After finishing his education, he joined the family business, a waterproofing company. When the First World War broke out, he returned home from a business trip and volunteered for active service with the King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster). Originally assigned to a battalion destined for France, he missed the battalion&#x27;s deployment while home on compassionate leave to attend the funeral of his father. Instead, he was transferred to the 6th (Service) Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster).

The 6th Bn was attached to the 13th (Western) Division. Originally ordered to Gallipoli, he remained with the battalion through the Gallipoli campaign. Eventually, he and his unit were ordered to join the Tigris Corps, attempting to relieve the Siege of Kut. After the failure of the relief effort, White&#x27;s unit participated in the counter-offensive in 1917. It was during the 13th Division&#x27;s crossing of the Diyala River that he earned the Victoria Cross.

==Details==

White was 20 years old, and a private when, on 7/8 March 1917 on the Dialah River, Mesopotamia, the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC. This citation was gazetted on 27 June 1917:

He was also awarded the Italian Bronze Medal of Military Valour.

He was initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge Montefiore, No. 753, (Glasgow, Scotland) on 2 June 1919. The records show the following entry: &#x27;Jack White (Weiss) VC, Waterproof Maker Commercial. Age 23.&#x27;

==Later life==
White later achieved the rank of lance corporal. Although a Victoria Cross holder he was not permitted to join the Home Guard during World War II because his Russian-born father had failed to be naturalised as a British subject.

After his service, White returned to Manchester and undertook an apprenticeship as a trainee pattern cutter in a local factory. He went on to become General Manager and then Owner before fading health forced him to relinquish his interest and he died in 1949 aged 52.

He was the subject of a comic strip in &quot;The Victor&quot; published in 1987.

<text>William Allison White VC TD (19 October 1894 – 13 September 1974) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was 23 years old, and a temporary second lieutenant in the 38th Battalion, Machine Gun Corps (part of the 38th (Welsh) Division), British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 18 September 1918 at Gouzeaucourt, France, when the advance was held up by enemy machine-guns, Second Lieutenant White rushed a gun position single-handed, shot the three gunners and captured the gun. Later he attacked a gun position accompanied by two men, both of whom were immediately shot down. He went on alone to the gun, killing the team and capturing the gun. On a third occasion when the advance was again held up this officer collected a small party and rushed the position, inflicting heavy losses on the garrison. Subsequently, he consolidated the position by the skilful use of captured enemy and his own machine-guns. The full citation was published in a supplement to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 12 November 1918 (dated 15 November 1918):

In 1939, White was commissioned as a captain in the Royal Artillery, Territorial Army.

White married Violet Victoria Price, who died in 1956 after 35 years marriage. He died in 1974, aged 79 at Wellington, Shropshire, and was cremated at Emstrey Crematorium, Shrewsbury. He is mentioned on his wife&#x27;s headstone in St John&#x27;s Churchyard, Hildenborough, Kent.

<text>Exile is a single-player action-adventure video game originally published for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron in 1988 by Superior Software and later ported to the Commodore 64, Amiga, CD32 and Atari ST, all published by Audiogenic. The game was designed and programmed by Peter Irvin (creator of &quot;Starship Command&quot;) and Jeremy Smith (creator of &quot;Thrust&quot;). It is often cited as one of the earliest examples of a Metroidvania game and featured &quot;realistic gravity, inertia and object mass years before players understood the concept of a physics engine... an astounding level of AI, stealth-based gameplay, a logical ecosystem governing the world&#x27;s creatures and a teleportation mechanic that feels startlingly like a predecessor to &quot;Portal&quot;&quot;.

==Plot==

The player takes the role of Mike Finn, a leading member of a space-exploration organisation called Columbus Force, who have been ordered to the planet &quot;Phoebus&quot; as part of a rescue mission. Finn is tasked with abetting Commander David Sprake and the surviving crew of the disabled &quot;Pericles&quot; ship from a psychotic renegade genetic engineer, Triax (the titular Exile), who appears briefly at the very start of the game removing a vital piece of equipment called a Destinator from Mike&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Perseus&quot;. As with &quot;Elite&quot;, a novella (written by Mark Cullen, with input from the game&#x27;s authors) was included to set up the story, and to provide some clues as to the nature of the planet Phoebus&#x27; environment. The novella implies the events take place some time in the 22nd century.

==Gameplay==
The player is tasked with traversing a network of tunnels, collecting and interacting with objects, engaging hostile and friendly creatures, rescuing survivors and ultimately defeating Triax and escaping from Phoebus. Finn has a weapons and jet pack system which may be boosted by finding upgrades. Energy cells must be collected throughout the game to power the weapons and jet pack. Finn has a life-preserving teleport system. When he reaches a point near death he is automatically teleported to a safe location previously designated by the player, or ultimately back to his orbiting spaceship. Consequently, it is still possible to complete the game in many scenarios.

Exile permits a degree of nonlinear gameplay – challenges may be overcome in a number of possible orders and not all events have to be completed. The player is awarded points depending on goals achieved and time taken to complete the game. However, in some scenarios it becomes impossible to complete the game.

A major feature of the game is the single large and detailed world it offers for exploration. The subterranean setting is explained through the backstory in which the crew of the &quot;Pericles&quot; have set up a base in a natural cave system, with Triax having his own base in caves deep below.

The artificial intelligence features innovative routines such as creatures demonstrating awareness of nearby noises, line-of-sight vision through the divaricate caves and tunnels, and memory of where the player was last seen, etc.

Exile contains a physics model with gravity, inertia, mass, explosions, shockwaves, water, earth, wind, and fire. The game engine simulates all three of Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, with many puzzles and gameplay elements emerging from a few physical principles. For example, the player may experience difficulty when attempting to lift a heavy boulder across a windy shaft with a jet pack, or of trying to keep a glass of water from spilling while being pushed around by a pestering bird.

==Development==
The game was designed and programmed by Peter Irvin (author of &quot;Starship Command&quot;) and Jeremy Smith (author of &quot;Thrust&quot;). Jeremy Smith died in an accident several years after Exile was published and it is his last known game. William Reeve executed preliminary conversions of the earlier 8-bit versions to the Amiga and Atari ST. These were then upgraded and completed by Peter Irvin and Jeremy Smith. Tony Cox did a preliminary conversion of the game from the Amiga to Amiga CD32. Paul Docherty was involved in the graphics for the Commodore 64 version and Herman Serrano created some of the artwork used in the game and manual. Henry Jackman composed the title music for the Amiga and Atari ST versions and Paddy Colohan remixed this for the CD32 release.

The large subterranean world is procedurally generated. This is achieved using a compact but highly tuned pseudorandom process with a fixed seed number to generate the majority of the caverns and tunnels – augmented with a few custom-defined areas. The later Amiga and Atari ST release use a more conventional tiled map to allow greater customisation and variation in the landscape.

Peter Irvin later allowed the non-commercial redistribution of the Amiga version of the game.

==Releases==
The game was first published for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro in 1988 by Superior Software and later ported to the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga and CD32, all published by Audiogenic between 1991 and 1995. The game mechanics and level design are broadly similar across all Exile versions but visuals and sound vary depending on the capabilities of each system. Exile has never been released outside Europe.

===Acorn Electron / BBC Micro===
The standard 32 KB BBC Model B version uses a specially defined screen resolution (eight physical colours; 128 pixels across × 128 lines down = 8 KB screen memory), smaller than full-screen MODE 2. This is to free up memory for game data – a common technique in complex BBC games.

The simplified video hardware found in the Electron does not support this technique, so the additional data remains visible around the screen border. For speed reasons, the Electron release has only four on-screen colours. It did however boast a slightly larger view window of 128 pixels × 192 lines down.

Exile offers the option of playing an enhanced version of the game on a BBC Micro upgraded with a 16 KB page of sideways RAM. These enhancements include sampled sound effects and digitised speech (&quot;&quot;Welcome to the land of the Exile.&quot; and &quot;Alien die!&quot;&quot;), as well as a larger visible screen area (eight physical colours; 128 pixels across × 256 lines down = 16 KB screen memory).

The extreme measures taken to make the game operate on a standard BBC Micro mean that the main game had no on-screen status indications or text of any kind, or even load and save routines. Fuel and energy levels are sounded out by a series of chimes when a weapon is selected, and pocket contents can only be checked by putting items back into the player&#x27;s hands to make them visible. Saving the game entails pressing a shutdown key, resetting the computer, and launching the loader programme again. Despite such measures being forced by necessity, they formed part of the character and appeal of the game, leading to innovations such as the personal teleporter.

===Commodore 64===
The C64 conversion (1991) was carried out by the original programmers with graphics by Paul Docherty (credited as Dokk). It adds an on-screen status indicator and wider colour palette due to the extra RAM available but otherwise is a faithful port of the Acorn versions.

===Atari ST===
The Atari ST release (1991) was developed from the earlier 8-bit versions. The ST release has improved and recoloured graphics with a similar appearance to the 1991 Amiga version, though the sound effects differ somewhat.

===Amiga===
There were three releases for the Amiga platform, an OCS version (1991), an AGA version (1995) with enhanced graphics and finally a CD32 version (1995) based on the AGA release. Compared to the earlier 8-bit versions the OCS release has improved and recoloured graphics with a similar appearance to the Atari ST version. The AGA and CD32 versions have greatly reworked graphics with added detail and scrolling backdrops. The graphics of the CD32 version were made 50% larger than the AGA release for easier viewing on a console setup. All Amiga versions feature a dynamic in-game musical score which changes when a threat is near to the player. Amongst other digitised sound effects, the imps encountered in the cave system have a cry imitating Monty Python&#x27;s infamous &quot;Ni&quot;.

===Apple iOS===
Peter Irvin was working on an updated version for iOS based on the Amiga AGA version. This was scheduled for release in 2010. However, the game has not yet appeared and there have been no further announcements since 2010.

==Reception==
Electron User gave the game a positive review under the title &quot;The New Masterpiece&quot; concluding &quot;Exile&#x27;s detailed graphics enhance the game&#x27;s infuriating puzzles beautifully. Everything is drawn on a small scale, thereby emphasising the vastness of the underground complex. The animation is fast and incredibly realistic – I marvelled at the way Finn was bundled head over heels by a blast from the stun cannon.&quot; The game was only given a score of 8/10 although it has been alleged that the reviewers had not played very far into the game so did not appreciate its scale. Zzap!64, reviewing the Commodore 64 version, praised the game&#x27;s complexity and &quot;phenomenal attention to detail&quot;. They awarded the game a score of 91%, labeling it &quot;unmissable&quot;. Amiga Power magazine voted the Amiga version of &quot;Exile&quot; as the best game of 1991 with a score of 89%. In 2002 the multi-format magazine, Edge, retrospectively awarded it 10/10, an accolade which has only been awarded to two other games released before the magazine&#x27;s launch.

A 2010 article in The Escapist stated that &quot;Exile pioneered a lot of the science for which later games would become famous&quot;.

<text>A human video is a form of theater combining music, Modern Dance and drama, along with interpretive dance, American Sign Language, pantomime, and classic mime. A human video consists of a song or medley played over loudspeakers while actors use rhythmic physical movement (gestures and other movements of the limbs and body) to communicate emotions to a given audience.

The performance is presented in a form similar to a music video. It presents a story that illuminates a particular artistic intent through spatial relationships, meaningful gestures, and artistic movement. 

The story told within the video can be either implicit in the words of the song or a story written independently of the original artist&#x27;s meaning.

Just as more &quot;traditional&quot; forms of theater can be situated on different types of stages, so too can these dramatic acts. This particular form of drama can perform the same text in many different venues without disrupting its meaning. Because it typically has no set and limited costumes, it can be performed in nearly any location.

Props are sometimes used, but are forbidden in some competitive venues. In this instance, props are restricted in an effort to force creativity—because in the ideal Human Video, all actors on stage should be used to represent objects like crosses, thrones, trees or giants. Actors movements demonstrate a story and the theme of the song being played.

In the United States, one example of how human videos have permeated the culture is the inclusion of human videos in Fine Arts Festivals and church ministry groups (Assemblies of God, Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God, etc.) in a variety of Protestant denominations. The Fine Arts Festival in the Assemblies of God denomination is the largest and most intense of all competitions and categories. Churches spend many months and countless hours practicing in order to receive recognition at the National Fine Arts Festival.

One compelling example of Human Video creativity can be found in Solo Human Video Performed at NFAF. The talented artist invented a move, popularly known as &#x27;The Wheelchair Walk&#x27; in Human Video circles.

==History==
The name &quot;human video&quot; was coined by Randy Phillips. He is reported to have performed the first &quot;human video&quot; in a chapel service at Central Bible College, with several elements used from the then quite popular Deaf Ministry Team. It was used more formally in the early 1990s at Phoenix First Assembly of God led by Pastor Tommy Barnett.

Although elements of the form have existed in theatre for centuries and no one can actually claim to have invented it, Mr. Phillips began to use it as a ministry tool first at church services and then for outreach and missions with the help of Pastor Lloyd Ziegler and the ministry training program called Master&#x27;s Commission.

<text>The University of Harderwijk (1648–1811), also named the &quot;Guelders Academy&quot; (), was located in the city of Harderwijk, in the Republic of the United Provinces (now: the Netherlands). It was founded by the province of Guelders (Gelre).

==History==

The university of Harderwijk was founded during the Dutch Republic by the States of Gelre at the end of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, in 1648. The universities of Leiden (1575), Franeker (1585), Groningen (1614) and Utrecht (1636) had already been founded earlier. Harderwijk was the fifth Dutch university. It was always to be small, with never more than sixty new students, and a max of 150 each year. 

In the 18th century, the university of Harderwijk attracted students with its low fees. Many students went to Harderwijk to graduate. In the time of Linnaeus, the 18th century Swedish biologist, a doctorate could not be obtained in Sweden, or in many other European countries. Often, graduates went to the Dutch Republic, where the universities had a good reputation. The wealthy usually travelled to Leiden; the less fortunate could go to Harderwijk, where the doctorate was less expensive, and could be attained much faster.

One of the professors of Harderwijk was David de Gorter, who was friends with Linnaeus. He was royal physician to Empress Elizabeth of Russia.

The university was closed in 1811 during the French occupation. Later, king William I tried to re-establish the university, without success.

== Modern culture ==
In the 1990s, the university became more known to a new audience thanks to the fictional character Prof. Fetze Alsvanouds (&quot;Als vanouds&quot; loosely translated as &quot;like the good old days&quot;), who was played by Aart Staartjes and regularly appeared in the humorous Dutch children&#x27;s television program &quot;Het Klokhuis&quot;. Alsvanouds posed as a professor at the University of Harderwijk, and declaimed sundry false and often ridiculous &#x27;scientific&#x27; explanations for common things in everyday life for children.

==Notable alumni==
Some well-known graduates of the University of Harderwijk are
*Hungarian encyclopedist János Apáczai Csere (1651)
*artist Romeyn de Hooghe (1689)
*explorer Jacob Roggeveen (1690)
*physician and chemist Hieronymus David Gaubius
*physician Herman Boerhaave (1693)
*Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus (1735)
*Hungarian linguist János Uri (1749)
*explorer Robert Jacob Gordon (1759)
*statesman Herman Willem Daendels (1783)
*engineer and general Cornelis Krayenhoff (1784)
*poet A.C.W. Staring (1787)

<text>The hornero birds are members of the genus Furnarius in the family Furnariidae, native to South America. The English common name appears in many books as &quot;ovenbird&quot;.

Horneros are brown birds with rather short tails and fairly long bills. They are known for building mud nests that resemble old wood-fired ovens (the Spanish word &quot;hornero&quot; comes from &quot;horno&quot;, meaning &quot;oven&quot;). These nests have a unique chambered construction. While many Furnariids have different nests, the hornero nest is the reason for the common name applied to the entire family; &quot;ovenbirds&quot; (they are unrelated to the parulid warbler called the ovenbird in the United States). The size and exact shape of the hornero nest varies depending on the species. They generally lay two to four eggs, although the breeding behavior of the bay hornero is virtually unknown.

Adult horneros can frequently be seen sitting on top of their nest. Except for the uncommon and relatively shy bay hornero, horneros are typically fairly common and highly conspicuous birds. They are generally noisy. All horneros are partially terrestrial, and commonly seen walking on the ground with a relatively upright posture.

The rufous hornero is a national emblem of Argentina and Uruguay, two of the several countries it inhabits.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Furnarius&quot; was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot to accommodate a single species, the rufous hornero, which therefore becomes the type species. The genus name is from Latin &quot;furnarius&quot; meaning &quot;baker&quot; (from &quot;furnus&quot; meaning &quot;oven&quot;).

The genus contains eight species:

* Band-tailed hornero (&quot;Furnarius figulus&quot;)
* Pale-legged hornero (&quot;Furnarius leucopus&quot;)
* Pacific hornero (&quot;Furnarius cinnamomeus&quot;) – split from &quot;F. leucopus&quot;
* Caribbean hornero (&quot;Furnarius longirostris&quot;) – split from &quot;F. leucopus&quot;
* Bay (or pale-billed) hornero (&quot;Furnarius torridus&quot;)
* Lesser hornero (&quot;Furnarius minor&quot;)
* Rufous hornero (&quot;Furnarius rufus&quot;)
* Crested hornero (&quot;Furnarius cristatus&quot;)

<doc id="1187790" wikidata="Q576614" url="?curid=1187790" title="Luis Aragonés">
<text>Luis Aragonés Suárez (; 28 July 1938 – 1 February 2014) was a Spanish football player and manager.

Aragonés spent the majority of his career as a player and coach at Atlético Madrid. He was a prominent player and then coach of the successful Atlético team of the late 1960s and early 1970s. The team were national champions four times, reached the 1974 European Cup Final. Between 1964 and 1974, he played 265 Primera Liga games for Atlético and scored 123 goals. He also played for several other clubs, including Real Madrid, and played 11 times for Spain, scoring three goals.

Apart from Atlético he also coached seven other La Liga clubs as well as the Spain national team, whom he led to their second European Championship title in 2008. He then became the head coach of the Turkish club Fenerbahçe after the tournament, the only time he coached outside his native Spain.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
Aragonés began his playing career with Getafe Deportivo in 1957. In 1958, he signed for Real Madrid but never made it into the senior team. He spent most of his time at Real Madrid on loan to other clubs, including Recreativo de Huelva and Hércules and playing for AD Plus Ultra, the Real Madrid reserve team. In 1960, he joined Real Oviedo and made his debut in the Primera División. Between 1961 and 1964, he played for Real Betis, making 86 league appearances and scoring 33 goals.

===Atlético Madrid===
In 1964, Aragonés was signed by Atlético Madrid where he acquired the nickname &quot;Zapatones&quot;, meaning &quot;big boots&quot;, since he was known as a free kick specialist. Aragonés picked up silverware in his first season at the club, winning the Copa del Rey (then known as the Copa del Generalísimo). He then helped Atlético to win the La Liga title in 1965–66 and again in 1969–70, where he shared the &quot;Pichichi&quot; trophy for the highest scorer in the league with his fellow Atlético forward José Eulogio Gárate and Real Madrid&#x27;s Amancio. A second Copa followed in 1972 and the team achieved a third league title in 1972–73. The following year, Atlético reached the final of the European Cup played against German champions Bayern Munich. During the match, Aragonés scored a goal late in extra time to give Atlético a 1–0 lead. A 119th-minute equaliser from Georg Schwarzenbeck, however, sent the final to a replay, where Bayern prevailed with a convincing 4–0 victory. His retirement followed soon after and he was appointed Atlético coach for the first time in the same year. Until 2024, Aragonés remained Atlético&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer and is ninth in the club&#x27;s all-time appearance list.

===International===
Aragonés made his international debut for Spain on 8 May 1965 in a 0–0 friendly draw away to Scotland. The first of his three goals for Spain was in a friendly against France in Lyon, in a 3–1 win on his seventh cap on 17 October 1968. He captained the side for the sole time on his 10th of 11 caps, a 3–0 win over Northern Ireland in Seville on 11 November 1970 in qualification for UEFA Euro 1972. He scored in the match.

==Managerial career==

===Spanish clubs===

In his first season in charge at Atlético Madrid, Aragonés led Atlético to success over two legs in the 1974 Intercontinental Cup, where the team beat Copa Libertadores winners Independiente of Argentina 2–1 on aggregate. Atlético went on to claim the Copa del Generalísimo and La Liga title in 1976 and 1977 respectively.

Aragonés took over at Real Betis in 1981. His time in Andalusia, however, was brief and he returned to the Vicente Calderón in 1982. In his fourth spell at the club, his Atlético side came close to achieving a historic double during the 1984–85 season, winning the Copa del Rey and finishing runner-up in La Liga. The following season, the team reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, where it was beaten 3–0 by Dynamo Kyiv.

Aragonés&#x27; success saw him appointed as manager of Barcelona in 1987, where he spent one season, winning the Copa del Rey. He then spent a season at fellow Barcelona based club Espanyol before rejoining Atlético for a fifth spell, where he won the sixth Copa del Rey of his career in 1992.

After leaving the club for a fifth time in 1993, he went on to coach Sevilla, Valencia, Real Betis, Real Oviedo and Mallorca. His biggest success during this period was in the 1995–96 season coming within four points of winning the La Liga title with Valencia.

In 2001, with the club in the Segunda División, Aragonés took over at Atlético for a sixth time and led the team to promotion back to the Primera División as champions in the 2001–02 season. He left the club for the seventh and final time in 2003 and remains its most successful manager with eight trophies won.

Aragonés returned to Mallorca on 2 October of the 2003–04 season, after the dismissal of Jaime Pacheco for a poor start to the season. He steered the club to 11th by the end of the season. On 1 July 2004, he took the job of Spain national team after Iñaki Sáez resigned due to public disapproval for failing to qualify the team from the group stage at UEFA Euro 2004.

===Spain national football team===

On taking over the national team following the UEFA Euro 2004 humiliation, Aragonés made changes to the team, dropping experienced players such as Míchel Salgado and Raúl and revamped with some new blood. Spain were unbeaten in qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup under Aragonés, but finished as group runner-up to Serbia and Montenegro, and thus required a play-off against Slovakia to secure their place. Spain won the play-off 6–2 on aggregate, with Luis García scoring a hat-trick in the first-leg 5–1 win. At the finals, Spain won all three group games before facing France in the Second Round. After taking the lead through David Villa, they lost 3–1 following goals from Franck Ribéry, Patrick Vieira and Zinedine Zidane. Realizing the physical weakness of Spanish players, he employed &quot;tiki-taka&quot;, a system of short passing which subsequently would also be identified with the playing style of Barcelona, and became the biggest football revolution in the history of Spanish football.

Aragonés stayed on as manager and presided over the following qualifications for the European Championship. The initial phase of the qualifiers started on a poor note with a 3–2 defeat to Northern Ireland and a 2–0 defeat to Sweden both away from home, a pair of results that put tremendous pressure on Aragonés&#x27; position. Spain recovered strongly to seal a ticket as group winners ahead of Sweden that also qualified directly to the tournament, while Denmark missed out.

Aragonés then presided over Spain&#x27;s victorious campaign at Euro 2008, beating Germany 1–0 in the final with a goal from Fernando Torres for their first international honour since 1964. Aragonés had a superstitious fear of the colour yellow, and referred to Spain&#x27;s change kit for the semi-final match against Russia as &quot;mustard&quot; and not &quot;yellow&quot;.

His &quot;tiki-taka&quot; style of play was retained by his successor, Vicente del Bosque, who led Spain to further tournament victories.

===Fenerbahçe===
After denying an approach in late June, Aragonés replaced Zico as manager of Turkish Süper Lig club Fenerbahçe on 5 July 2008. He signed a two-year deal and declared his intention to win the league title in his first season. The club, however, finished in fourth, and he was dismissed on 2 June 2009 after the season had ended.

==Thierry Henry controversy==
In 2004, Aragonés was appointed coach of Spain. During a training session in the same year, a Spanish TV crew filmed Aragonés making offensive comments to José Antonio Reyes about Reyes&#x27; black Arsenal teammate Thierry Henry, saying:
The incident caused uproar in the English media with calls for Aragonés to be sacked or suspended of his duties, however the Spanish Football Federation stated that &quot;his offence has not been deemed serious enough to warrant a suspension of his duties, or his sacking&quot; After an investigation into the events during the match, UEFA fined the Royal Spanish Football Federation 100,000 Swiss francs/US$87,000 and warned that any future incidents would be punished more severely. UEFA noted that possible punishments could include suspension from major international tournaments or the closure of Spain&#x27;s home international matches to supporters.

In response to this, Aragonés said in public that he was not a racist, and claimed that he had black friends. Brazilian-born black midfielder Marcos Senna stated:

Aragonés also responded to the controversy by saying to a group of reporters: &quot;You are like wolves after the deer. You are kids. You don&#x27;t know anything, but I am nearly 70. I have a lot of black friends who have explained to me that the English were after them in the colonies.&quot; These comments were criticised by Bobby Barnes, a member of the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association&#x27;s executive and a trustee of the football anti-racism organisation Kick It Out, who suggested that Aragonés&#x27; comments on colonialism were an attempt &quot;...to justify his offensive and disgraceful statement&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Aragonés died on 1 February 2014 in Clínica CEMTRO hospital, Madrid, from leukemia.

The Royal Spanish Football Federation released a statement of &quot;grief and shock&quot; at the death of the man who was the coach at &quot;the start of its most glorious era of successes on the world stage&quot;. Diego Simeone, incumbent manager of Atlético Madrid, spoke on the day of Aragonés&#x27; death, saying, &quot;From here I want to send a very strong message to his family. Everyone at Atletico is hurting at the loss of such an important part of the club and for the Spanish football.&quot; Aragonés&#x27; successor as the coach of Spain national football team, Vicente Del Bosque gave his word, &quot;We&#x27;ve woken up to a sad news. Luis has been the father of the successes for the National Team. We are in his hall and I think we will always carry him in our memory.&quot;

His funeral was held on 2 February in Madrid with the attendance including Spanish players Carles Puyol, Cesc Fàbregas, Andrés Iniesta and Xavi. He was buried in the cemetery of La Paz in Alcobendas.

At the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final, Atlético Madrid wore shirts with Aragonés&#x27; name written in gold on the inside of the collar.

Atlético Madrid pays tribute to Aragonés in the club membership cards for 2019–20 season.

<text>Crivillén is a municipality in the Andorra-Sierra de Arcos comarca, province of Teruel, part of the autonomous community of Aragon, Spain. According to the 2023 census the municipality has a population of 90 inhabitants. Its postal code is 44557.

The sculptor Pablo Serrano spent his youth in Crivillén, and there is a museum on his honor.

According to Agustín Ventura Conejero, the name Crivillén comes from the Latin &quot;Fundus Crivillanus&quot;, Fundus meaning farm or place and Crivillanus coming from Criviliano or Crivilio. It is not clear who Criviliano or Crivilio refers to, but it is speculated to refer to a Roman official. Eventually, &quot;Fundus Crivillanus&quot; was shortened to Crivillanus and then again to Crivillán or Crivillén.

<doc id="1187792" wikidata="Q551458" url="?curid=1187792" title="Deviled egg">
<text>Deviled eggs, also known as stuffed eggs, curried eggs or dressed eggs, are hard-boiled eggs that have been peeled, cut in half, with the yolk scooped out and then refilled having been mixed with other ingredients such as mayonnaise, mustard and sprinkled with paprika, cinnamon or curry powder. They are generally served cold as a side dish, appetizer or a main course during gatherings or parties. The dish is popular in Europe, North America and Australia.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;devil&quot;, in reference to highly seasoned food, was in use in the 18th century, with the first known print reference appearing in 1786. In the 19th century, the adjective &quot;deviled&quot; came to be used most often with spicy or zesty food, including eggs prepared with mustard, pepper, or other ingredients stuffed in the yolk cavity. Similar uses of &quot;devil&quot; for spiced foods include deviled ham and sauce (from the Italian word for &quot;devil&quot;).

At church functions in parts of the Southern and Midwestern United States, the terms &quot;stuffed eggs&quot;, &quot;salad eggs&quot;, and &quot;dressed eggs&quot; occur instead, to avoid reference to the word &quot;devil&quot;. For this reason, the term &quot;angel eggs&quot; is also occasionally used.

==History==

Recipes for hard-boiled eggs stuffed with herbs, cheese and raisins can be found in the cookery texts of medieval European cuisine.

The earliest known recipe for stuffed eggs, and the one that most closely resembles the modern-day deviled egg, is believed to have been written in the Andalusian region of Spain during the 13th century. According to the English translation of a recipe found in an unnamed 13th century Andalusian cookbook, boiled egg yolks were mixed with cilantro (coriander), pepper, and onion juice, then beat with murri (a sauce made of fermented barley or fish), oil and salt. The mixture was then stuffed into the hollowed-out egg whites, and the two halves of the egg were fastened back together with a small stick and topped with pepper.

In his 1585 cookery book &quot;The Good Huswifes Jewell&quot;, Thomas Dawson suggests filling hardboiled eggs with a &quot;farsing stuffe as you do for flesh&quot;.

The first known recipe to suggest the use of mayonnaise as an ingredient in deviled eggs was in the 1896 version of &quot;The Boston Cooking School Cook Book&quot; by Fannie Farmer.

==Preparation and ingredients==
Cooled hard-boiled eggs are peeled and halved lengthwise, with the yolks then removed. (They can be cut crosswise for more filling). The yolk is then mashed and mixed with a variety of other ingredients. These usually incorporate a fat-based product (such as butter, heavy cream, or mayonnaise) with spicy and/or piquant ingredients to contrast taste (and, sometimes, texture). One recipe has the yolks mashed with mayonnaise, dijon mustard, vinegar, pickle relish and salt and pepper. The yolk mixture is then scooped into each egg &quot;cup&quot; formed by the firm egg whites.

Ingredient choices vary widely and there is no standard recipe. Although mayonnaise is most common, some recipes use butter, and sweet pickle relish sometimes replaces the sour pickles.

===Variations===

There are many variations on the basic recipe that may add ingredients such as:
==In different countries==
===United States of America===

Devilled eggs came over from the UK to the United states. In the United States, deviled eggs are a common dish that are typically served as hors d&#x27;oeuvres or appetizers during gatherings and parties.

The eggs are boiled, cooled, shelled, and then sliced in half. The yolk is then removed and mixed with other ingredients, such as mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, pickle relish, and other spices and herbs. It is then blended into a smooth paste which is used to fill the hollowed-out egg whites. They are generally served cold and are often dusted with paprika.

The earliest known American recipe for deviled eggs was printed in the Montgomery Advertiser, a news publication in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1877.

The first known recipe to use mayonnaise as an ingredient in deviled eggs was in the 1896 version of an American cookbook titled &quot;The Boston Cooking School Cookbook&quot; by Fannie Farmer. In this early recipe, the mayonnaise was recommended as a binding agent for the yolk mixture.

Deviled eggs have been a popular dish in the United States dating as far back as the 1920s. In 1923, Wanda Barton suggested in her newspaper column, “Home-Making Helps”, to save egg cartons because &quot;they are fine for carrying boiled or deviled eggs.&quot;
By the 1940s, deviled eggs had become a staple food at picnics, parties and gatherings in the United States.

According to an online survey commissioned by McCormick in 2019, nearly 61 percent of Americans planned to make and/or eat deviled eggs during Easter Sunday of that same year.

===Europe===
In many European countries, especially Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Germany, a variation is served known as &quot;Russian eggs&quot;. This consists of eggs cut in half, served with vegetable &quot;macédoine&quot; and garnished with mayonnaise, parsley and tomato. Contrary to what the name might suggest, the dish does not originate in Russia; its name derives from the fact that the eggs are served on a bed of &quot;macédoine&quot;, which is sometimes called &quot;Russian salad&quot;. In German cuisine, other common flavourings of the yolks are anchovies, cheese and caper. 

In France, the dish is called &quot;œuf mimosa&quot; (&quot;mimosa egg&quot;, named after the appearance of the mimosa tree); in Italy &quot;uova ripiene&quot; (literally &quot;stuffed eggs&quot;) in Hungary, &quot;töltött tojás&quot; (&quot;stuffed egg&quot;) or &quot;kaszinótojás&quot; (&quot;casino egg&quot;); in Poland, &quot;jajka faszerowane&quot; (&quot;stuffed eggs&quot;); in the Netherlands &quot;gevuld ei&quot; (&quot;stuffed egg&quot;); in Sweden &quot;fyllda ägg&quot; (&quot;stuffed eggs&quot;); on the island of Malta &quot;bajd mimli&quot; (&quot;stuffed eggs&quot;) 

United Kingdom

A 16th century recipe for devilled eggs comes from the book &quot;The Good Huswifes Jewell&quot;. It stuffs the eggs with a mixture of herbs and spices.

The term devilled eggs is British first appearing in print in 1786. 

In the UK, the dish is popular at buffets. The eggs are made with a mixture or mayonnaise, English mustard, paprika and chives. Cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce is often added to the mixture. 

====Italy====
In Italy uova ripiene are usually stuffed with minced boiled egg yolks, tuna, capers, anchovies, chopped parsley, and mayonnaise. They are usually prepared around Easter time.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the deviled egg (&quot;fyllda ägghalvor&quot;) is a traditional dish for the Easter Smörgåsbord, where the yolk is mixed with caviar, cream or sour cream, optionally chopped red onion, and decorated with chopped chives or dill, perhaps with a piece of anchovy or pickled herring.

====Hungary====
In Hungarian cuisine, the yolks are mashed and mixed with white bread soaked in milk, mustard and parsley, often served as an appetizer with mayonnaise, or as a main course baked in the oven with Hungarian sour cream topping and served with French fries.

==== Romania ====
In Romania, deviled eggs are called &quot;ouă umplute&quot; („stuffed eggs”) and are a popular dish frequently prepared both for religious and secular celebrations. Several stuffings are available with the most frequent consisting of the classic mixture of yolks with mayonnaise, or with liver paté added, a different mixture with cheese or fish paste decorated with carrot or pickle slices and parsley or dill leaves.

<text>Place Ville Marie (, abbr. PVM) is a large office and shopping complex skyscraper in Downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada, comprising four office buildings and an underground shopping plaza. The main building, 1 Place Ville Marie (formerly Royal Bank Tower from its anchor tenant), was built in the International style in 1962 as the headquarters for the Royal Bank of Canada. While RBC&#x27;s corporate headquarters and the majority of its management operations have been based in Toronto&#x27;s Royal Bank Plaza since 1976, Place Ville Marie remains RBC&#x27;s head office, a distinct title from its corporate headquarters. It is a , 47-storey, cruciform office tower. The complex is a nexus for Montreal&#x27;s Underground City, the world&#x27;s busiest, with indoor access to over 1,600 businesses, numerous subway stations, a suburban transportation terminal, and tunnels extending throughout downtown. A counter-clockwise rotating beacon on the rooftop lights up at night, illuminating the surrounding sky with up to four white horizontal beams that can be seen as far as away.
This beacon is not considered as a NAVAID for aviation purposes.

==Buildings==
The name &quot;Place Ville Marie&quot; is often used to refer to the cruciform building only, but it also applies to four shorter office buildings which were built around it in 1963 and 1964, and to the urban plaza which lies on top of the largest section of the shopping promenade, and between the buildings. From a postal point of view the cruciform tower is &quot;1, Place Ville Marie&quot; and the lesser buildings around it are &quot;2, Place Ville Marie&quot; and so on. The buildings and the plaza have been given many facelifts over the years. In the latest facelift, much of the grey concrete and terrazzo of the plaza was covered with grass, flowers and shrubs. The complex has of space and parking for about 900 vehicles. There are about 70 tenants with 3,000 employees. Via Rail has its headquarters in &quot;3, Place Ville Marie&quot;.

==Site==
The location of Place Ville Marie was originally a vast railway trench gouged in the flank of Mount Royal between the southern portal of Canadian National Railway&#x27;s Mount Royal Tunnel and Central Station. Most of the building was thus built over the tracks, requiring the structure to be more resistant to vibrations than normally required. As a result, it is the most earthquake-resistant office tower in Montreal.

All of the land bounded by Cathcart Street, Dorchester Boulevard (now René Lévesque Boulevard), University Street (now Robert-Bourrassa Street) and Mansfield Street was owned by the CNR, Railways, with the
exception of the venerable St. James Club at the corner of Dorchester and University. Developer William Zeckendorf offered the club the top floor of the Place Ville Marie tower in exchange for their property, but was turned down.

==History==

Place Ville Marie was one of the first built projects of Henry N. Cobb, a founding partner of Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners. His design was controversial from the start, given its proximity to many Montreal landmarks and the vast changes it would bring to the downtown core.

According to design historian Mark Pimlott, &quot;The most radical aspect of the Place Ville Marie project was that nearly one-half of its 280,000-square-metre area was beneath street level[...] deriving the obvious benefit of being protected from Montréal’s extreme winter and summer climate.&quot; Its vast network and multi-purpose is juxtaposed with a continuous interior &quot;with episodes of civic gravity and monumentality&quot;.

At the time of construction, the main tower was known as the tallest skyscraper in the Commonwealth, and was the third tallest skyscraper on Earth outside the United States. The equivalent of three floors was added late in the project to ensure that this building would not be topped by the neighboring Tour CIBC which was built at the same time.

Conceived and built at a time when Montreal was the metropolis of Canada, the structure&#x27;s largest occupant and anchor tenant was the head office of the Royal Bank of Canada, the country&#x27;s largest bank, which moved from its previous head office at 360 St Jacques in Old Montreal. The second new large corporate tenant was the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) who established in November 1962 occupying 6 floors of the building. The central plaza became an important new public space in downtown Montreal, hosting an historic election rally for Pierre Elliott Trudeau during the 1968 federal election.

Developer William Zeckendorf founded Trizec Properties in order to build Place Ville Marie. He lost a bet to then Royal Bank President Earle McLaughlin, making payment in full (US$0.10) in an elaborate dime encased in acrylic. Exactly what the bet concerned is unknown.

In 1975 Air Canada&#x27;s headquarters were at 1 Place Ville Marie.

Mayor Jean Drapeau chose the name himself. Ville-Marie was the name of the Catholic colony founded at what is now Montreal in 1642.

==Legacy==
On 12 March 1976 Canada Post issued &#x27;Place Ville Marie and Notre-Dame Church&#x27; designed by Jean Mercier &amp; Pierre Mercieron. The $1 stamps are perforated 13 and were printed by British American Bank Note Company.

==Other information==
The penthouse was home to the Restaurant Club Lounge Altitude 737 restaurant and nightclub, that opened onto a rooftop terrace. The club, which was named for its elevation in feet from sea level, was one of the most famous in the city, and featured one of the most unusual dance floors, which twisted and turned around, and spanned two floors. It later became home to the 360 Observatory, which suspended its operations on 13 March 2020 and announced permanent closure on 3 May 2020.

During the holiday season, a large artificial Christmas tree is installed in the central court. The plaza has a large fountain with programmed water jets and a large abstract sculpture at its centre: &quot;Feminine Landscape&quot; by Gerald Gladstone.

The complex is currently owned by Ivanhoé Cambridge, a division of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDP Capital), who bought the building in March 2000 for CA$450 million.

The building can be seen in the film &quot;Scanners II: The New Order&quot; in a few scenes.

<doc id="1187821" wikidata="Q499602" url="?curid=1187821" title="Arcadocypriot Greek">
<text>Arcadocypriot, or southern [[Achaeans (tribe)|Achaean]], was an ancient Greek dialect spoken in Arcadia, in the central Peloponnese, and in Cyprus. Its resemblance to Mycenaean Greek, as it is known from the Linear B corpus, indicates that they are closely related to it, and belong to the same dialect group, known as Achaean.

In Cyprus the dialect was written using solely the Cypriot syllabary. The most extensive surviving text of the dialect is the Idalion Tablet. A significant literary source on the vocabulary comes from the lexicon of 5th century AD grammarian Hesychius.

==History==
The prevailing dialect spoken in southern Greece (including Achaea, the Argolid, Laconia, Crete, and Rhodes) at the end of the Bronze Age, was Proto-Arcadocypriot. The Mycenaean and Arcadocypriot dialects belong to the same group, known as Achaean. Certain common innovations of Arcadian and Cypriot, as attested in the first millennium BC, indicate that they represent vernaculars that had slightly diverged from the Mycenaean administrative language, sometime before a migration to Cyprus; possibly during the 13th or 12th century BC. Pausanias reported:

The establishment happened before 1100 BC. With the arrival of Dorians in the Peloponnese, a part of the population moved to Cyprus, and the rest was limited to the Arcadian mountains.

According to John T. Hooker, the preferable explanation for the general historico-linguistic picture is that:
...in the Bronze Age, at the time of the great Mycenaean expansion, a dialect of a high degree of uniformity was spoken both in Cyprus and in the Peloponnese but that at some subsequent epoch the speakers of West Greek intruded upon the Peloponnese and occupied the coastal states, but made no significant inroads into Arcadia.
==Later developments==
After the collapse of the Mycenaean world, communication ended, and Cypriot was differentiated from Arcadian. It was written until the 3rd century BC using the Cypriot syllabary.

Tsan was a letter in use only in Arcadia until around the 6th century BC. Arcadocypriot kept many characteristics of Mycenaean, early lost in Attic and Ionic, such as the sound (digamma).

<text>Waterdown is a community in the city of Hamilton in the Canadian province of Ontario. Waterdown is approximately 60 km west of downtown Toronto and, as of 2021, has a population of approximately 24,400 residents.

On January 1, 2001, the new city of Hamilton was formed from the amalgamation of six municipalities, Hamilton, Ancaster, Dundas, Flamborough, Glanbrook, and Stoney Creek. Before the amalgamation, the old city of Hamilton had 331,121 Hamiltonians divided into 100 neighbourhoods. The newly-amalgamated city had 490,268 people in over 200 neighbourhoods.

Waterdown was created from that part of East Flamborough Township on the edge of the Niagara Escarpment, just east of the junction of Dundas Street (Highway 5) and Highway 6, traditionally known as Clappison&#x27;s Corners.

In 1974, the village was amalgamated with East Flamborough, West Flamborough and Beverly townships to form the Town of Flamborough. In 2001, Flamborough and five other municipalities were amalgamated into the City of Hamilton.

Waterdown has seen significant commercial development, including opening an expansive YMCA facility. Waterdown population growth was approximately 28.9% over the years 1996 and 2001. In 2012, the average house price in Waterdown was nearly $400,000.

Waterdown District High School (WDHS) expanded its facilities in 2012.

== History ==
Perched atop the Niagara Escarpment, the area that became Waterdown has been inhabited for thousands of years. Professor John Triggs of Wilfrid Laurier University found evidence of Algonquin-speaking Aboriginals from as far back as 7,500 BCE. One of the earliest known groups to inhabit the area was the Chonnonton Nation. The Jesuits in Quebec City wrote that the Chonnonton Nation was driven from the area by 1653, with remnants of the once powerful group reportedly migrating to seek shelter with the Anishinabe nations on Lake Huron and Lake Superior.

Following the war, the area around Waterdown was sparsely inhabited by newly arrived Haudenosaunee. The Haudenosaunee village of Tinawatawa (alternatively spelled Quinaouatoua) was located near Waterdown, likely somewhere near Beverly Township. It was one of only a few villages established in the newly conquered territories. Following the upheaval of the so-called Beaver Wars, the Haudenosaunee abandoned their settlements north of Lake Ontario, and the Mississaugas moved into the region.

=== Robert de la Salle explores Flamborough ===
1669 saw French explorer Robert de la Salle follow Spencer Creek (from Lake Ontario) up toward present-day Westover and the Indigenous settlement of Tinawatawa. Here, la Salle met up with another French explorer, M. Louis Joilet. Some historians think this meeting happened along the shores of Lake Medad (northeast of present-day Waterdown, beside Hidden Lake Golf Club).

=== British Conquest of 1760 and the American Revolution ===
After the fall of New France, the region changed dramatically. The Anishinabe allied with the British Crown, which was reaffirmed by King George III&#x27;s Royal Proclamation of 1763 and the Treaty of Niagara. For the Europeans, the region became part of the Province of Quebec, created by the British Crown.

The area remained largely unaffected until the American Revolution unleashed a flood of Loyalists fleeing the American republic. Access was primarily restricted to water, so the first settlements were along the coast of Lake Ontario. To facilitate the English-speaking settlers, the Province of Quebec was broken into Upper and Lower Canada with Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe as the first representative of the Crown for Upper Canada. It was John Graves Simcoe who was walking along the beach strip of Hamilton that looked up at the escarpment and named its northern arm around Burlington Bay &quot;Flamborough&quot; because it reminded him of Flamborough Head in Yorkshire, England.

The Flamborough area came into Treaty with the Crown on May 22, 1784 (formally confirmed by Treaty No.3 in 1792). The frontline of the new township was laid out by John Collins in 1790, with further surveys conducted through 1797. It was intended to be the Township of Flamborough but was broken into the separate entities of East Flamborough and West Flamborough in 1798. Today, Waterdown is the largest settlement in the former township of East Flamborough.

=== Alexander Brown and Merren Grierson ===
One of the first land grants in the area was to Lt. Alexander MacDonell of Butler&#x27;s Rangers. MacDonell never visited the area but sold 800 acres to Alexander Brown of the North West Fur Company in 1802. Brown built a log cabin and sawmill at the top of the Great Falls in present-day Smokey Hollow in 1805, making him the first European settler in the region. Alexander Brown married Merren Grierson and was a key figure in the community until he died in 1852. Alexander Brown II moved down Grindstone Creek to the site of present-day LaSalle Park, building a wharf (called &quot;Brown&#x27;s Wharf&quot; or &quot;Port Flamboro&quot;) to export the many things being created by the mills that quickly sprung up in the Waterdown area. It was Alexander Brown that built the first school of the village (on the site of the present-day American House) in 1815, employing Mary Hopkins as its first teacher.

=== Ebenezer Griffin – the founder of Waterdown ===
The arrival of entrepreneur Ebenezer Culver Griffin in 1823, purchasing over half of Alexander Brown&#x27;s property, marked the beginning of the Village of Waterdown. It was Griffin who had his property surveyed into village lots in 1830. The post office dates from 1840.

=== Waterdown name ===
A local story credits Ebenezer Griffin with giving Waterdown its name. A prohibitionist, Griffin disapproved of the vast quantities of alcohol being consumed during the Victorian Age, including the whiskey used to christen new mills. During the christening of one of Griffin&#x27;s mills, the carpenter called out for its name, and someone in the crowd called out, &quot;Hey Ebenezer, throw that water down.&quot; The carpenter heard the name &quot;Waterdown,&quot; and it was given to the mill and soon adopted by the emerging village.

A secondary story with a more plausible reality exists from the early pioneers of this area, naming Waterdown after Waterdown Forest in the UK. This area was a military encampment area that existed in 1782, extending from Tunbridge Wells in Kent in the north-west and Frant in Sussex. Many of the small towns and hamlets around Waterdown have been named after the exact named locations throughout the UK.

=== Industrial Revolution ===

Waterdown was born out of the Industrial Revolution. Thanks to the plan drawn up by Ebenezer Griffin, settlers and industrialists rooted themselves in village life. Mills grew along the banks of Grindstone Creek (especially in the area known as Smokey Hollowgiven this name because of all the smog caused by the many complexes) as individuals like William P. Howland arrived to make their fortune. In 1869, the population was 1,000. By 1879 the settlement was severed from the Township of East Flamborough and incorporated as a village in its own right with quarrier Charles Sealey as its first reeve. Waterdown remained its own municipality until it was absorbed into the Township of Flamborough in 1974.

=== Convent and academy ===
In 1927, the School Sisters of Notre Dame opened a Motherhouse in rural Waterdown and subsequently opened a private Catholic girls&#x27; school called Notre Dame Academy; classes started on 14 February 1927 with three teachers and 32 attendees. In addition to classrooms, the property included a residence for boarding students. The school was closed in 1993, but the convent continued to function and was renovated in 1997. Nuns continued to live there as the convent became a retirement home; as recently as summer 2019, 54 elderly nuns still reside there. The property was then put up for sale and plans were made move 300 bodies and gravestones from the cemetery to a nearby Catholic cemetery. Plans were also being made to relocate the residents of the convent.

=== 2001 amalgamation ===
Ontario&#x27;s Progressive Conservative government embarked on a province-wide restructuring of municipal governments, amalgamating several municipalities into larger ones. It was proposed that Flamborough be amalgamated into the City of Hamilton with five other municipalities. Due to Waterdown&#x27;s location as a &quot;sandwich town,&quot; resting between Burlington and Hamilton, residents argued that Hamilton would not extend city services, such as bus routes, to Waterdown. Instead, they suggested that Flamborough be split into parts, with Waterdown amalgamating with Burlington. Burlington had expressed some interest in amalgamation. Burlington is closer geographically, and the Aldershot and Kerncliff Park neighbourhoods wrap around the south and east ends of the community. Burlington had also expressed a willingness to expand bus service to Waterdown.

In 2001, Waterdown was amalgamated into Hamilton with the rest of Flamborough. This prompted the elected Member of Provincial Parliament at the time, Conservative Toni Skarica, to resign. Skarica ran partially due to a platform of keeping Flamborough unamalgamated and vowed to resign if the government amalgamated it with Hamilton.

===Souharissen Natural Area===
On August 21, 2014, the Souharissen Natural Area was dedicated in Waterdown by the Honourable David C. Onley, 28th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, and Chief Bryan Laforme and Council of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation. Over 50 people attended the dedication, including David Sweet MP, Councillor Judi Partridge, Carolyn King, United Empire Loyalists, and other members of the Mississaugas of the New Credit. The day began with lighting the first sacred fire in over two centuries, signalling the formal return of the Mississaugas to their traditional territory.

The Souharissen Natural Area covers 27 acres in the Village of Waterdown. It is the result of years of work following the discovery of 104 Indigenous archeological sites in the Waterdown Bay Development Area in 2005.

Along with the Indigenous sites, the foundations of an early 19th-century dwelling were uncovered in the area. This dwelling may have been used by the first European settlers of Waterdown, Alexander Brown and Merren Grierson. The Natural Area includes a plaque identifying this important landmark, as well as detailing the histories of Merren Grierson and Alexander Brown, which was unveiled by the Lieutenant Governor, Chief LaForme, and researcher Kekoa Reinebold.

Later that day, a community feast was held in Waterdown at a local residence in honour of the return of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation to Flamborough, as well as the visit by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and Chief of the Mississaugas of the New Credit. Everyone who was part of the dedication, including the Lieutenant Governor and Chief Laforme, attended.

=== The Queen&#x27;s Bench ===
Flamborough has a tradition of honouring royal milestones, including the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Trees&quot; in Harpers Corners, located outside the library and at Memorial Park. On September 9, 2015, the Honourable Elizabeth Dowdeswell, 29th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, visited Waterdown to unveil the Queen&#x27;s Bench in Memorial Park. The bench commemorates that on that day, the reign of Queen Elizabeth II surpassed that of Queen Victoria, making it the longest reign in Canada&#x27;s modern era. The bench is engraved with many of the Canadian milestones of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada. The project was completed thanks to generous donations made by community members.

== Natural attractions ==
Waterdown, and its associated Great Falls, (also called Grindstone Falls, so named for the Grindstone Creek that feeds it, or Smokey Hollow Falls, so named for the smoke rising from the hollow from the mills, or Barnes&#x27; Falls, named after the Barnes family who owned the property until 1978), are located on the local portion of the Bruce Trail System in Ontario. Many national and regionally rare flora species grow in the natural areas of Waterdown.

The Smokey Hollow Falls powered a sawmill and gristmill when the town was founded, and later several other small mills, and as a result of demand on the limited water supply, time shared the water. The last operating sawmill (Slater&#x27;s Lumber Mill) continued to produce lumber well into the 1970s. It was located along Grindstone Creek behind the Knox Presbyterian Church at the corner of Mill Street North and Church Street. During the 1950s and mid-1960s, the mill used horses and heavy tackle to haul the logs to the cutting area. Today, only remote foundation ruins of the mills remain, although a lookout over the falls and a signboard detailing the area&#x27;s history is in place.

Furthermore, Waterdown has many wetland trails at the eastern end of town, which are well-marked and have informational signage.

== Other attractions ==
Waterdown is also home to a hockey arena, Harry Howell Arena, which is home of the Flamborough Hockey Association, the Flamborough Girls Hockey Association, and the Flamboro Skating Club.

Each July 1 weekend, Waterdown hosts the Oh Canada! Ribfest, a joint community-focused event sponsored by the Rotary Clubs of Flamborough AM and Waterdown. Tens of thousands of people from Waterdown and surrounding communities fill Memorial Park enjoying local music artists, dancers, midway rides, kids&#x27; activities, and food.
