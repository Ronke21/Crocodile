<text>The Upper Paleolithic (or Upper Palaeolithic) is the third and last subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. Very broadly, it dates to between 50,000 and 12,000 years ago (the beginning of the Holocene), according to some theories coinciding with the appearance of behavioral modernity in early modern humans. It is followed by the Mesolithic.

Anatomically modern humans (i.e. &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) are believed to have emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago. It has been argued by some that their ways of life changed relatively little from that of archaic humans of the Middle Paleolithic, until about 50,000 years ago, when there was a marked increase in the diversity of artefacts found associated with modern human remains. This period coincides with the most common date assigned to expansion of modern humans from Africa throughout Asia and Eurasia, which may have contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthals.

The Upper Paleolithic has the earliest known evidence of organized settlements, in the form of campsites, some with storage pits. Artistic work blossomed, with cave painting, petroglyphs, carvings and engravings on bone or ivory. The first evidence of human fishing is also found from a 125,000 years old artefacts in Buya, Eritrea and in other places such as Blombos cave in South Africa. More complex social groupings emerged, supported by more varied and reliable food sources and specialized tool types. This probably contributed to increasing group identification or ethnicity.

The peopling of Australia most likely took place before c. 60 ka. Europe was peopled after c. 45 ka. 
Anatomically modern humans are known to have expanded northward into Siberia as far as the 58th parallel by about 45 ka (Ust&#x27;-Ishim man).
The Upper Paleolithic is divided by the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), from about 25 to 15 ka. The peopling of the Americas occurred during this time, with East and Central Asia populations reaching the Bering land bridge after about 35 ka, and expanding into the Americas by about 15 ka.
In Western Eurasia, the Paleolithic eases into the so-called Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic from the end of the LGM, beginning 15 ka. The Holocene glacial retreat begins 11.7 ka (10th millennium BC), falling well into the Old World Epipaleolithic, and marking the beginning of the earliest forms of farming in the Fertile Crescent.

==Lifestyle and technology==

Both &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and Neanderthals used the same crude stone tools. Archaeologist Richard G. Klein, who has worked extensively on ancient stone tools, describes the stone tool kit of archaic hominids as impossible to categorize. He argues that almost everywhere, whether Asia, Africa or Europe, before 50,000 years ago all the stone tools are much alike and unsophisticated.
Firstly among the artefacts of Africa, archeologists found they could differentiate and classify those of less than 50,000 years into many different categories, such as projectile points, engraving tools, knife blades, and drilling and piercing tools. These new stone-tool types have been described as being distinctly differentiated from each other; each tool had a specific purpose. The early modern humans who expanded into Europe, commonly referred to as the Cro-Magnons, left many sophisticated stone tools, carved and engraved pieces on bone, ivory and antler, cave paintings and Venus figurines.

The Neanderthals continued to use Mousterian stone tool technology and possibly Châtelperronian technology. These tools disappeared from the archeological record at around the same time the Neanderthals themselves disappeared from the fossil record, about 40,000 cal BP. 
Settlements were often located in narrow valley bottoms, possibly associated with hunting of passing herds of animals. Some of them may have been occupied year round, though more commonly they appear to have been used seasonally; people moved between the sites to exploit different food sources at different times of the year. Hunting was important, and caribou/wild reindeer &quot;may well be the species of single greatest importance in the entire anthropological literature on hunting&quot;.

Technological advances included significant developments in flint tool manufacturing, with industries based on fine blades rather than simpler and shorter flakes. Burins and racloirs were used to work bone, antler and hides. Advanced darts and harpoons also appear in this period, along with the fish hook, the oil lamp, rope, and the eyed needle. Fishing of pelagic fish species and navigating the open ocean is evidenced by sites from Timor and Buka (Solomon Islands).

The changes in human behavior have been attributed to changes in climate, encompassing a number of global temperature drops. These led to a worsening of the already bitter cold of the last glacial period (popularly but incorrectly called the last ice age). Such changes may have reduced the supply of usable timber and forced people to look at other materials. In addition, flint becomes brittle at low temperatures and may not have functioned as a tool.

===Notational signs===

Some notational signs, used next to images of animals, may have appeared as early as the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe circa 35,000 BCE, and may be the earliest proto-writing: several symbols were used in combination as a way to convey seasonal behavioural information about hunted animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1017/S0959774322000415&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Lines (|) and dots (•) were apparently used interchangeably to denote lunar months, while the (Y) sign apparently signified &quot;To give birth&quot;. These characters were seemingly combined to convey the breeding period of hunted animals.

==Changes in climate and geography==

The climate of the period in Europe saw dramatic changes, and included the Last Glacial Maximum, the coldest phase of the last glacial period, which lasted from about 26.5 to 19 kya, being coldest at the end, before relatively rapid warming (all dates vary somewhat for different areas, and in different studies). During the Maximum, most of Northern Europe was covered by an ice-sheet, forcing human populations into the areas known as Last Glacial Maximum refugia, including modern Italy and the Balkans, parts of the Iberian Peninsula and areas around the Black Sea.

This period saw cultures such as the Solutrean in France and Spain. Human life may have continued on top of the ice sheet, but we know next to nothing about it, and very little about the human life that preceded the European glaciers. In the early part of the period, up to about 30 kya, the Mousterian Pluvial made northern Africa, including the Sahara, well-watered and with lower temperatures than today; after the end of the Pluvial the Sahara became arid.
The Last Glacial Maximum was followed by the Allerød oscillation, a warm and moist global interstadial that occurred around 13.5 to 13.8 kya. Then there was a very rapid onset, perhaps within as little as a decade, of the cold and dry Younger Dryas climate period, giving sub-arctic conditions to much of northern Europe. 
The Preboreal rise in temperatures also began sharply around 10.3 kya, and by its end around 9.0 kya had brought temperatures nearly to present day levels, although the climate was wetter.
This period saw the Upper Paleolithic give way to the start of the following Mesolithic cultural period.

As the glaciers receded sea levels rose; the English Channel, Irish Sea and North Sea were land at this time, and the Black Sea a fresh-water lake. In particular the Atlantic coastline was initially far out to sea in modern terms in most areas, though the Mediterranean coastline has retreated far less, except in the north of the Adriatic and the Aegean. The rise in sea levels continued until at least 7.5 kya (5500 BC), so evidence of human activity along Europe&#x27;s coasts in the Upper Paleolithic is mostly lost, though some traces have been recovered by fishing boats and marine archaeology, especially from Doggerland, the lost area beneath the North Sea.

==Timeline==

==Cultures==
The Upper Paleolithic in the Franco-Cantabrian region:
*The Châtelperronian culture was located around central and south western France, and northern Spain. It appears to be derived from the Mousterian culture, and represents the period of overlap between Neanderthals and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. This culture lasted from approximately 45,000 BP to 40,000 BP.
*The Aurignacian culture was located in Europe and south west Asia, and flourished between 43,000 and 26,000 BP. It may have been contemporary with the Périgordian (a contested grouping of the earlier Châtelperronian and later Gravettian cultures).
*The Gravettian culture was located across Europe. Gravettian sites generally date between 33,000 and 20,000 BP.

<text>Takwin () was a goal of certain Muslim alchemists, notably Jabir ibn Hayyan. In the alchemical context, takwin refers to the creation of synthetic life in the laboratory, up to and including human life. Whether Jabir meant this goal to be interpreted literally is unknown.

Jabir states in his &quot;Book of Stones&quot; (4:12) that &quot;The purpose is to baffle and lead into error everyone except those whom God loves and provides for!&quot; The &quot;Book of Stones&quot; was deliberately written in a highly esoteric code, so that only those who had been initiated into his alchemical school could understand them. It is therefore difficult at best for the modern reader to discern which aspects of Jabir&#x27;s work are to be read as symbols (and what those symbols mean), and what is to be taken literally.

<text>Vatasseri Parameshvara Nambudiri ( 1380–1460) was a major Indian mathematician and astronomer of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics founded by Madhava of Sangamagrama. He was also an astrologer. Parameshvara was a proponent of observational astronomy in medieval India and he himself had made a series of eclipse observations to verify the accuracy of the computational methods then in use. Based on his eclipse observations, Parameshvara proposed several corrections to the astronomical parameters which had been in use since the times of Aryabhata. The computational scheme based on the revised set of parameters has come to be known as the &quot;Drgganita&quot; or Drig system. Parameshvara was also a prolific writer on matters relating to astronomy. At least 25 manuscripts have been identified as being authored by Parameshvara.

==Biographical details==

Parameshvara was a Hindu of Bhrgugotra following the Ashvalayanasutra of the Rigveda. Parameshvara&#x27;s family name (&quot;Illam&quot;) was Vatasseri and his family resided in the village of Alathiyur (Sanskritised as &quot;Asvatthagrama&quot;) in Tirur, Kerala. Alathiyur is situated on the northern bank of the river Nila (river Bharathappuzha) at its mouth in Kerala. He was a grandson of a disciple of Govinda Bhattathiri (1237–1295 CE), a legendary figure in the astrological traditions of Kerala.

Parameshvara studied under teachers Rudra and Narayana, and also under Madhava of Sangamagrama (c. 1350 – c. 1425) the founder of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. Damodara, another prominent member of the Kerala school, was his son and also his pupil. Parameshvara was also a teacher of Nilakantha Somayaji (1444–1544) the author of the celebrated Tantrasamgraha.

==Work==
Parameshvara wrote commentaries on many mathematical and astronomical works such as those by Bhāskara I and Aryabhata. He made a series of eclipse observations over a 55-year period. Constantly attempted to compare these with the theoretically computed positions of the planets. He revised planetary parameters based on his observations.

One of Parameshvara&#x27;s more significant contributions was his mean value type formula for the inverse interpolation of the sine.

He was the first mathematician to give a formula for the radius of the circle circumscribing a cyclic quadrilateral. The expression is sometimes attributed to Lhuilier [1782], 350 years later. With the sides of the cyclic quadrilateral being &quot;a, b, c,&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, the radius &quot;R&quot; of the circumscribed circle is:
:formula_1

<doc id="1158669" wikidata="Q5433101" url="?curid=1158669" title="Family Dollar">
<text>Family Dollar Stores, Inc. is an American variety store chain founded in 1959 by Leon Levine in Charlotte, North Carolina. With over 8,000 locations in all states except Alaska and Hawaii, it was the second largest retailer of its type in the United States until it was acquired by Dollar Tree in 2015 when its headquarters operations were moved from Matthews, North Carolina, a suburb of Charlotte, to Chesapeake, Virginia, located in South Hampton Roads.

In June 2014, activist investor and major shareholder Carl Icahn demanded that Family Dollar be immediately put up for sale. On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that it would buy Family Dollar for $8.5 billion. The sale delivered a windfall to the company&#x27;s biggest shareholder, Carl Icahn, who had acquired his 9.4 percent stake in June 2014. On January 22, 2015, Family Dollar shareholders approved the Dollar Tree bid.

Family Dollar, and dollar stores in general, have been alleged to create food deserts: areas with poor access to healthy and affordable food. In 2022, Family Dollar was sued by the Arkansas Attorney General following an investigation by the FDA into a rat infestation at its West Memphis, Arkansas, distribution center. The lawsuit ended in a $41 million fine to the company and the temporary closure of 400 stores.

In 2024, Dollar Tree, Family Dollar&#x27;s parent company, announced that it would consider a potential spin-off or sale of the Family Dollar brand.

==History==
===1959-1980===
Family Dollar was founded in 1959 by Leon Levine, a 21-year-old entrepreneur. In November of that year, the company&#x27;s first store was opened, in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1961, their first store in South Carolina opened, followed by stores in Georgia and Virginia, which were opened in 1962 and 1965, respectively. During the 1960s, the store company was largely a southern United States operation. By 1969, there were fifty stores in Charlotte alone.

The 1970s were growing years for the store chain. In 1970, Family Dollar&#x27;s stock went public for the first time, at $14.50 per share. In 1971, the chain&#x27;s 100th store opened, followed by their 200th in 1974 and their 300th in 1978. Also in 1974, a distribution center was opened in Matthews, North Carolina. In 1979, Family Dollar stock began trading at the New York Stock Exchange.

===1980-2000===
In 1981, the chain&#x27;s 400th store was opened, followed by a 500th store in 1982 and a 700th in 1983. The 1980s saw expansion at a wider scale for the company, and by 1989, 1,500 stores were operating.

The 1990s saw the pace of expansion slow down compared to the 1980s, with 1,000 stores opened. The company opened distribution centers in West Memphis, Arkansas; Front Royal, Virginia, and Duncan, Oklahoma. Since 2000, the pace of growth increased significantly, with the addition of about 3,500 new stores, and new distribution centers opening in Morehead, Kentucky; Maquoketa, Iowa; Odessa, Texas; Marianna, Florida; and Rome, New York.

===2000-2010===
In 2001, Family Dollar joined the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. In 2002, the company joined the &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of largest publicly held companies.

When Leon Levine retired in 2003, his son Howard R. Levine succeeded him as Chairman and CEO, keeping this multibillion-dollar company in the family.

In March 2005, Family Dollar restated the company&#x27;s fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2004 earnings per share downward by 2 cents to 3 cents a year, to correct lease-accounting issues.

===2010-2020===
As of August 2011, there were 7,000 stores in 44 states. According to their website in 2005, Family Dollar opened 500 new stores, 350 more in 2006, and an additional 300 in 2007. According to the Company&#x27;s 2013 Corporate Profile in 2010, Family Dollar opened 200 new stores, 300 more in 2011, 475 in 2012, and an additional 500 in 2013. On October 3, 2012, Family Dollar said they will open 500 stores in 2013. The next day, Family Dollar partnered with Healthways. Family Dollar operates 11 distribution centers - the latest of which opened in St. George, Utah, on October 16, 2013.

Family Dollar created a game show based on the store in late 2016. Hosted by celebrity chef Pat Neely, the show &quot;Save to Win&quot; aired on The CW between 2016 and 2017.

====Selling pressure====
In March 2011, Family Dollar rejected a takeover offer by Nelson Peltz&#x27;s Trian Fund Management reportedly between $55 and $60 a share.

On June 6, 2014, activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed that his firm, Icahn Enterprises, held a 9.4% stake in Family Dollar. On June 19, 2014, Icahn demanded in an open letter that Family Dollar be put up for sale immediately. Goldman Sachs and other analysts had identified a number of potential buyers.

As of June 19, 2014, 22% of Family Dollar&#x27;s shares were controlled by activist investors.

====Acquisition by Dollar Tree====
On July 28, 2014, Dollar Tree announced that it would acquire Family Dollar for $74.50 per share, a deal valuing Family Dollar at $8.5 billion, and that Dollar Tree would also assume $1 billion in debt currently owed by Family Dollar, for a total of $9.5 billion. Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said that Family Dollar CEO Howard R. Levine will remain with the company following the merger and will be appointed to Dollar Tree&#x27;s board of directors. Dollar General entered the bidding, shortly thereafter, surpassing Dollar Tree&#x27;s offer on August 18, 2014, $78.50 a share compared to Dollar Tree&#x27;s offer of $74.50 a share. The enterprise value of the Dollar General bid was $9.7 billion compared to that of Dollar Tree of $9.2 billion, while the quantum return to shareholders was varying as the stock and cash deal valuation was subjected to fluctuations of price of the competing bidders stock.

On August 20, 2014, Family Dollar rejected the Dollar General bid, saying it was not a matter of price, but concerns over antitrust issues that had convinced the company and its advisers that the deal could not be concluded on the terms proposed. Days after, Dollar General CEO Rick Dreiling sent a letter to the Family Dollar board of directors claiming that Levine rejected merger requests to protect his job. Levine, in a statement, said the Family Dollar board had been analyzing potential antitrust issues that could arise from doing a deal with Dollar General since the start of the year, and that was the reason it was not accepting the Dollar General bid.

On January 22, 2015, Family Dollar shareholders approved the Dollar Tree bid.

Several stores were required to be sold as a condition of the sale. Sycamore Partners acquired the stores in 2014 under the corporate name Dollar Express. The stores continued to operate under the Family Dollar name. In 2017, Dollar General acquired Dollar Express and converted the stores.

As a result of Family Dollar&#x27;s sale to Dollar Tree, some Family Dollar stores have opened in the same plaza, and at times even next door to Dollar Tree locations. On March 6, 2019, the retailer announced that it will close up to 400 stores nationwide due to heavy pressure from an activist investor. Most store locations were either shut down entirely or replaced with Dollar Tree stores.

The company has deployed a newer store format known as &quot;H2&quot; in new and renovated locations, which have a larger focus on groceries and incorporate Dollar Tree merchandise. The company has also deployed co-branded Family Dollar/Dollar Tree stores in smaller markets.

===2020-present===
In May 2020, eight Family Dollar stores were damaged by rioting and looting during the George Floyd protests in Minneapolis–Saint Paul, with two locations being destroyed by arson during the widespread civil unrest.

In March 2024, Dollar Tree, owner of Family Dollar stores since 2015, announced it would close 600 retail stores by July 2024 and another 370 over the next few years. The company will also close 30 Dollar Tree stores as well.

In June 2024 it was reported that Dollar Tree were in discussions to potentially spinoff or sell, Family Dollar due to poor financial performance for the chain. As of December 2024 such a spinoff or sale has not occurred. On February 20, 2025, Reuters reported that Apollo Global Management, Sycamore Partners, and Brigade Capital Management were among the parties expressing interest in acquiring the Family Dollar brand.

==Criticism and lawsuit==
===Allegations of creating food deserts===
Family Dollar, and dollar stores in general, have been alleged by a number of studies, individuals, and organizations to proliferate food deserts: areas with limited access to healthy and affordable food. Dollar stores are alleged to outcompete local grocery stores, and end up being one of the few options available for purchasing food in some communities. In line with these allegations, a number of states have passed restrictions on where new dollar stores can be opened.

===Rodent infestation in warehouse===
In February 2022, Family Dollar temporarily closed 400 stores in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee and recalled certain products purchased from January 1, 2021, through the present after the FDA found unsanitary conditions, including a rodent infestation, at the company&#x27;s distribution center in West Memphis, Arkansas. On May 18, 2022, the company announced that the West Memphis distribution center would be shut down permanently on or before July 17, 2022, with over 300 employees affected.

In 2024, the FDA announced that over 1000 rats were found in the Family Dollar distribution center in West Memphis. Inspection reports related to the investigation showed that violations had occurred as far back as January 2021, and the lawsuit determined that Family dollar had been aware of the infestation as early as January 2020. Family Dollar pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges relating to the infestation, agreeing to a $41 million fine and forfeiture. As part of the deal, Family Dollar agreed to pay $1.125 million to the state of Tennessee.

The West Memphis distribution center was subject to a $100 million development that rebuilt the facility after the rodent infestation incident. It reopened in 2024 as a Dollar Tree distribution center.

<text>Munishvara or Munīśvara Viśvarūpa (born 1603) was an Indian mathematician who wrote several commentaries including one on astronomy, the &quot;Siddhanta Sarvabhauma&quot; (1646), which included descriptions of astronomical instruments such as the &quot;pratoda yantra&quot;. Another commentary he wrote was the &quot;Lilavativivruti&quot;. Very little is known about him other than that he came from a family of astronomers including his father Ranganatha who wrote a commentary called the &quot;Gụ̄hārthaprakaśa/Gūḍhārthaprakāśikā,&quot; a commentary on the &quot;Suryasiddhanta&quot;. His grandfather Ballala had his origins in Dadhigrama in Vidharba and had moved to Benares. Ballala had several sons who wrote commentaries on astronomy and mathematics. Munisvara&#x27;s &quot;Siddhantasarvabhauma&quot; had the patronage of Shah Jahan like his paternal uncle Krishna Daivagna did. He was opposed to fellow mathematician Kamalakara, whose brother also wrote a critique of Munisvara&#x27;s bhangi-vibhangi method for planetary motions. He was also opposed to the adoption of some mathematical ideas in spherical trigonometry from Arab scholars. An edition of his &quot;Siddhanta Sarvabhauma&quot; was published in the Princess of Wales Sarasvati Bhavana Granthamala series edited by Gopinath Kaviraj. Munisvara&#x27;s book had twelve chapters in two parts. The second part had notes on astronomical instruments. He was a follower of Bhaskara II.

<doc id="1158682" wikidata="Q1428876" url="?curid=1158682" title="The Farm (British band)">
<text>The Farm are a British band from Liverpool. Their first album, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, reached the top position on the UK Albums Chart when it was released in March 1991; &quot;Spartacus 30&quot; was released in 2021 to commemorate the anniversary. &quot;Spartacus&quot; includes two songs which had been top 10 singles the year before. In 2012, they toured with their Spartacus Live shows and formed part of the Justice Tonight Band, supporting the Stone Roses at Heaton Park, Phoenix Park, Lyon and Milan. They formed part of The Justice Collective which had the 2012 Christmas number one with their recording of &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;.

==History==
The band was formed in early 1983 and initially comprised Peter Hooton, Steve Grimes, John Melvin and Andrew John &quot;Andy&quot; McVann, who was killed in a police chase on 1 October 1986 at the age of 21, and to whose parents the band&#x27;s subsequent album, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, is dedicated.

The band evolved from an earlier group called The Excitements, initially including Phil Stephenson on bass guitar, Neil (Cad) Campbell on drums, Grimes on guitar and Thomas (the band&#x27;s dancer). They became The Farm after Martin Dunbar (vocals) left and Peter Hooton joined, although they did play several gigs as The Excitements with Hooton on vocals. In 1984, they released the single, &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot;, produced by Graham &quot;Suggs&quot; McPherson, lead vocalist with Madness. In 1986, after McVann&#x27;s death, Melvin left the band to pursue a varied career as the director of his own construction firm, but he eventually returned to music in 1990 under the guise of Mr. Smith, a two-piece band that toured frequently, but did not release anything of note. In 1987, the band supported the Housemartins on their UK tour.

After the departure of Melvin and the death of McVann, Hooton brought in a new line-up. They released four independent singles, but did not have a big break until 1990. In 1989, the band had been given a cameo role in the movie &quot;The Final Frame&quot; starring Suggs. They were signed after this and hired Suggs as their producer. Their first single under new management was &quot;Stepping Stone&quot;, a dance remake of Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and The Monkees&#x27; single &quot;(I&#x27;m Not Your) Steppin&#x27; Stone&quot;, a 1966 single that in its day reached No. 20 in the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts for The Monkees. They appeared in &quot;The Face&quot;, an influential popular culture magazine in the UK, and their promotion of &quot;No alla violenza&quot; anti-hooligan T-shirts during Italia 90 helped to raise their profile further.
The Farm&#x27;s first song to reach the top part of the UK Singles Chart was &quot;Groovy Train&quot;, which reached the Top 10 in September 1990. During the summer that year they played in Ibiza and were a key feature in the film &quot;A Short Film About Chilling&quot;. In late November that year, they released their most memorable song, &quot;All Together Now&quot;, which instantly became a hit and peaked at number three in the charts in December 1990. It was on the crest of this wave that their album &quot;Spartacus&quot; reached No. 1 in the UK the following year.

In 1991, the Farm teamed up with Pete Wylie of Wah! (The Mongrel), to re-record his 1986 hit &quot;Sinful&quot; in the indie-dance &#x27;baggy&#x27; style and followed it up with three smaller hits on the Produce record label.

With the success of &quot;Spartacus&quot;, the band signed a major label deal with Sony Records, who gave them their own End Product record label (which played on the name of their former independent record company Produce). 
However their success was to be short-lived due to changes in the indie music scene and the move to a major. Their first single for Sony, &quot;Rising Sun&quot; (1992), moved away from the baggy sound and did not perform well, peaking at Number 48 in the UK Top 75. At this point the band had split from producers Pete Heller and Terry Farley and had joined up with Mark Saunders, who had produced Erasure and The Cure. In October 1992 they reached the Top 20 with a cover version of The Human League&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot;, recorded for charity album &quot;Ruby Trax - The NME&#x27;s Roaring Forty&quot; (a follow-up to the NME&#x27;s &quot;Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father&quot;).

The Farm&#x27;s last &#x27;new&#x27; top 40 under their own name was a re-recorded version of &quot;Love See No Colour&quot;, now used as the title track of their 1992 album.
The Sony Music version dispensed of the &#x27;Scally-baggy&#x27; rhythms of the original Produce release (which had got &#x27;lost in the Christmas chart rush&#x27; at the end of 1991), for a slower more synthpop sound with gospel overtones and a big budget video using classical and religious imagery. However, this song only reached Number 35 in the UK charts while the parent album did not chart at all (which means that The Farm join Steve Brookstein and Johnny Hates Jazz in the list of album chart &#x27;One-Hit Wonders&#x27;). The Farm were dropped from Sony Music.

In 1994, they released the album &quot;Hullabaloo&quot; on the Sire label, followed by their last major single. Despite being a group largely supporting Liverpool F.C., they allowed Everton Football Club
to release a version of &quot;All Together Now&quot; on MDMC Records (which was credited to Everton FC by the UK top 40) to accompany their presence in the 1995 FA Cup Final, in which Everton beat Manchester United 1-0.

Their most recent hit single under their own name was &quot;All Together Now 2004&quot;, featuring the S.F.X. Boys Choir of Liverpool, as the official anthem of the England National Football Team at Euro 2004. It was issued on 31 May 2004 and, as the name suggests, in a slightly remixed format, with radio commentary from the Euro 2004 qualifiers added to the track, whilst a bonus remix was included on the single with the help of DJ Spoony.

The Farm was also one of the first bands to perform at the Echo Arena Liverpool when it opened in January 2008.

===The Collective===

The Farm were also central to the track released to commemorate the Hillsborough disaster, &quot;The Fields of Anfield Road&quot;, the proceeds going to the families of those killed in the disaster. Credited to the Liverpool Collective featuring the Kop Choir, this single was a new entry at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart on 12 April 2009 and reached number 14 a week later.

In 2011, the Farm joined forces with others to create the &quot;Don&#x27;t Buy The Sun&quot; Gig, at the Olympia in Liverpool, which was part of the continuing protest on Merseyside against &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper for its false reporting on the Hillsborough disaster 22 years before. This comprised Mick Jones from the Clash, Pete Wylie from the Mighty Wah, John Power and others. This then formed the core of The Justice Tonight Band which toured from 2011 to 2012, including four performances supporting the Stone Roses in their comeback tour in 2012. The Justice Tonight Band headlined the Strummerville festival in 2012 and went on to form the Justice Collective who had the Christmas number 1 with their version of &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;, a charity single in aid of the families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster.

In 2014, &#x27;the Collective&#x27; reconvened again to record another charity record, with &quot;All Together Now&quot; being re-recorded again by members of the Farm now under The Peace Collective name. However, unlike &quot;The Fields of Anfield Road&quot; or &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot;, this failed to chart in the UK top 40, peaking at number 70.

===2010s to present===
Throughout 2013 and 2014, the band have continued to perform at festivals around the UK, including the Isle of Wight Festival in 2013. In 2014, Alan McGee said that the band&#x27;s acoustic gig at his new venue The Tabernacle, was in his &quot;Top Ten All Time Gigs&quot;. The Farm continued to perform live in 2015 at various festivals such as at the Shiiine On Weekender in November, 2015 and appeared live doing a number of acoustic performances.

In 2016, the band along with numerous other celebrities, toured the UK to support Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s bid to become Prime Minister. In June 2017, the band supported a Labour Party rally prior to the 2017 UK general election.

In 2018, Carl Hunter directed the feature film &quot;Sometimes Always Never&quot;, which was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and starred Bill Nighy, Sam Riley, Alice Lowe, Jenny Agutter and Tim McInnerny. This film received a 4 star review in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and even though the soundtrack featured music by Edwyn Collins and Sean Read rather than the Farm, the film was produced by members of group.

To commemorate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Spartacus&quot; being No. 1 in the album charts, BMG released &quot;Spartacus 30&quot; which includes many tracks/remixes previously unavailable and released a HD version of &quot;Groovy Train&quot;.

Former member George Maher died in December 2022.

<text>Mahendra Sūri (c. 1340 – 1400) is the 14th century Jain astronomer who wrote the &quot;Yantraraja&quot;, the first Indian treatise on the astrolabe. He was trained by Madana Sūri, and was teacher to Malayendu Sūri. Jainism had a strong influence on mathematics particularly in the last couple of centuries BC. By the time of Mahendra Suri, however, Jainism had lost support as a national religion and was much less vigorous.

==Works==

Mahendra Suri&#x27;s fame rests on the work &quot;Yantrarāja&quot;, which introduced the astrolabe to the Indian astronomer. Mahendra Sūri was patronized by the Tughluq ruler of Delhi, Firūz Shāh (r. 1351–1388), who evinced keen interest in astronomy. Firūz Shāh had earlier caused the &quot;Bṛhatsaṃhitā&quot; of Varāhamihira to be translated into Persian. At the sultan&#x27;s instance, Mahendra Sūri studied the astrolabe and introduced it to the Sanskrit audience in 1370 in his &quot;Yantrarāja&quot;. Its circulation was largely, if not wholly, confined to astronomers who worked within the Islamic and Ptolemaic traditions.

The &quot;Yantrarāja&quot; is best described as an astrolabe user&#x27;s manual. It explains how this king (&quot;rāja&quot;) of instruments (&quot;yantra&quot;) is to be constructed and commissioned for purposes of observation. The &quot;saumya&quot; &quot;yantra&quot; (northern instrument) projected from the South Pole and the &quot;yāmya&quot; &quot;yantra&quot; (southern instrument) projected from the North Pole are discussed separately, followed by a description of the &quot;phaṇīndra&quot; &quot;yantra&quot; (the serpentine instrument), which combines both.

A detailed discussion on the application of the astrolabe is found in Malayendu Sūri&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Yantrarāja&quot;. This commentary is also interesting because it provided, for the first time to Indian astronomers, tables for ready reference, which helped simplify calculations. The commentator gave latitudes of 75 cities. Malayendu made a list of latitudes for 32 stars, which were identified as relevant for purposes of calculations in India.

<text>Dwell is a design and technology brand. It was launched with a magazine in October 2000 by CEO Lara Hedberg Deam with architecture and design critic Karrie Jacobs as its editor-in-chief. In August 2002, Jacobs left the magazine and was replaced by senior editor Allison Arieff. After Arieff, Sam Grawe held the position from 2006 to 2011, followed by Amanda Dameron from 2011 to 2017. William Hanley became the editor-in-chief in 2019.

In January 2020, it was announced that Zach Klein would be taking over as Dwell&#x27;s CEO.

In summer 2016, Dwell relaunched as a community publishing platform.

In late 2016, the brand announced Modern by Dwell Magazine, a collection of over 200 products for Target. Designed by Dwell co-creative directors of product design Chris Deam and Nick Dine, the collection includes both furniture and decor pieces and will launch on December 27, 2016.

In 2022, Dwell was acquired by Recurrent.

==Recognition==
* April 2005 National Magazine Award for General Excellence in the 100,000-to-250,000 circulation category.
* March 2006 Adweek 2006 Creative Team of the Year award to creative director Claudia Bruno and photo editor Kate Stone.

==In popular culture==
The Tumblr blog “Unhappy Hipsters,” which launched in 2010, pairs photos from &quot;Dwell&quot; with humorous captions that mock the ascetic lifestyle suggested by some of the photos. The blog achieved significant popularity at the time, and its creators wrote a spinoff book in 2011, &quot;It&#x27;s Lonely in the Modern World&quot;.

The magazine features in the Simpson’s episode The Day The Earth Stood Cool.

== Dwell Home Design Invitational ==
In January 2003, Dwell magazine invited 16 architects to participate in the Dwell Home Design Invitational, an international competition to design a modern prefab home for $200,000. The competition was conceived by Allison Arieff, after she published a book on prefab homes in 2002, titled &quot;Prefab.&quot; After reading Arieff&#x27;s book, an entrepreneur in North Carolina, Nathan Wieler, contacted Arieff to inquire about how he and his fiancée, Ingrid Tung, could purchase a modern prefab home. Arieff&#x27;s conversation with Wieler about a lack of affordable modern houses available inspired her to launch the competition.

The site for the Dwell Home was a 12-acre plot of land that Wieler and Tung owned in Pittsboro, North Carolina, near Chapel Hill.

The participating architects were: Anderson Anderson in WA and CA; Anshen + Allen in CA; Michael Bell in NY; Central Office of Architecture in CA; Claesson Koivisto Rune in Sweden; Collins + Turner Architects in Australia; Jones Partners: Architecture in CA; Adam Kalkin in NJ; Konyk Architecture in NY; Marmol + Radziner in CA; William Massie and NY; Resolution: 4 Architecture in NY; Ralph Rapson &amp; Toby Rapson in MN; Rocio Romero in MO; Jennifer Siegal in CA; and su11 architecture+design in NY.

In May 2003, the architects submitted their proposals. Then, Wieler and Tung came to Dwell&#x27;s office in San Francisco to meet with Arieff and a panel of advisors to select the winning design. Judging was based on aesthetics, adherence to the budget of $200,000, construction viability, and potential for mass production. Soon after at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) in New York City, Dwell announced that (RES4) won the competition.

Resolution: 4 Architecture&#x27;s proposal, entitled &quot;Modern Modular,&quot; used prefabricated modules that were affordably built in a factory, shipped to the site, and craned onto a concrete foundation, which housed the mechanical systems. RES4&#x27;s concept was that prefabricated modules could be configured in countless ways for unlimited design possibilities, though their proposal also included a home designed specifically to the clients, Wieler and Tung, and to the site.

Architecturally, the 2,260-square-foot Dwell Home, composed of seven modules, reads as two intersecting bars, with the open-plan communal areas in the lower level bar and the private spaces in the second story. RES4&#x27;s design used many windows and sliding glass doors for daylighting and views, and a roof deck includes an outdoor fireplace. Materials such as cedar siding, bamboo flooring, and aluminum-clad windows demonstrated the potential for customization with prefabricated construction.

Carolina Building Solutions (CBS) was the factory selected to build the Dwell Home. Resolution: 4 Architecture&#x27;s plan for the Dwell Home was designed within the limitations of the highway department regulations for shipping, but CBS still spent several months on engineering the Dwell Home, working within CBS&#x27;s manufacturing procedures without changing RES4&#x27;s original design. CBS began constructing the modules on April 6, 2004, and finished on April 13, 2004. It took only five days to build the framing and install insulation, sheathing, rough plumbing, rough electrical, nearly all of the Sheetrock, windows and trim, weatherproofing, cabinetry and stairs. On April 21, 2004, the modules were shipped from the CBS factory in Salisbury, North Carolina, to the site. By April 23, 2004, all the modules were set on the foundation. On July 10, 2004, the Dwell Home Open House expected to receive about 500 visitors, but received nearly 2,500 visitors, coming from as far as Michigan, California, and Oregon. Initial construction cost estimates for the Dwell Home were about $87 per square foot, but the final cost in 2004 came in at about $110. The cost for the modules was $100,289.

<doc id="1158706" wikidata="Q118414942" url="?curid=1158706" title="Baudhayana sutras">
<text>The  (Sanskrit: बौधायन सूत्रस् ) are a group of Vedic Sanskrit texts which cover dharma, daily ritual, mathematics and is one of the oldest Dharma-related texts of Hinduism that have survived into the modern age from the 1st-millennium BCE. They belong to the &quot;Taittiriya&quot; branch of the Krishna Yajurveda school and are among the earliest texts of the genre.

The Baudhayana sūtras consist of six texts:
# the , probably in 19 (questions), 
# the in 20 (chapters), 
# the in 4 , 
# the Grihyasutra in 4 , 
# the  in 4 and 
# the  in 3 .

The is noted for containing several early mathematical results, including an approximation of the square root of 2 and the statement of the Pythagorean theorem.

==Baudhāyana Shrautasūtra==

Baudhayana&#x27;s Śrauta sūtras related to performing Vedic sacrifices have followers in some Smārta brāhmaṇas (Iyers) and some Iyengars of Tamil Nadu, Yajurvedis or Namboothiris of Kerala, Gurukkal Brahmins (Aadi Saivas) and Kongu Vellalars. The followers of this sūtra follow a different method and do 24 Tila-tarpaṇa, as Lord Krishna had done tarpaṇa on the day before amāvāsyā; they call themselves Baudhāyana Amavasya.

==Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra==
The Dharmasūtra of Baudhāyana like that of Apastamba also forms a part of the larger Kalpasutra. Likewise, it is composed of &quot;praśnas&quot; which literally means &#x27;questions&#x27; or books. The structure of this Dharmasūtra is not very clear because it came down in an incomplete manner. Moreover, the text has undergone alterations in the form of additions and explanations over a period of time. The &quot;praśnas&quot; consist of the Srautasutra and other ritual treatises, the Sulvasutra which deals with vedic geometry, and the Grhyasutra which deals with domestic rituals.

There are no commentaries on this Dharmasūtra with the exception of Govindasvāmin&#x27;s &quot;Vivaraṇa&quot;. The date of the commentary is uncertain but according to Olivelle it is not very ancient. Also the commentary is inferior in comparison to that of Haradatta on Āpastamba and Gautama.

This Dharmasūtra is divided into four books. Olivelle states that Book One and the first sixteen chapters of Book Two are the &#x27;Proto-Baudhayana&#x27; even though this section has undergone alteration. Scholars like Bühler and Kane agree that the last two books of the Dharmasūtra are later additions. Chapter 17 and 18 in Book Two lays emphasis on various types of ascetics and acetic practices.

The first book is primarily devoted to the student and deals in topics related to studentship. It also refers to social classes, the role of the king, marriage, and suspension of Vedic recitation. Book two refers to penances, inheritance, women, householder, orders of life, ancestral offerings. Book three refers to holy householders, forest hermit and penances. Book four primarily refers to the yogic practices and penances along with offenses regarding marriage.

==Baudhāyana Śulvasūtra==

===Pythagorean theorem===
The &quot;Baudhāyana Śulvasūtra&quot; states the rule referred to today in most of the world as the Pythagorean Theorem. The rule was known to a number of ancient civilizations, including also the Greek and the Chinese, and was recorded in Mesopotamia as far back as 1800 BCE. For the most part, the Śulvasūtras do not contain proofs of the rules which they describe. The rule stated in the &quot;Baudhāyana Śulvasūtra&quot; is:
दीर्घचतुरस्रस्याक्ष्णया रज्जुः पार्श्वमानी तिर्यग् मानी च यत् पृथग् भूते कुरूतस्तदुभयं करोति ॥
&quot;dīrghachatursrasyākṣaṇayā rajjuḥ pārśvamānī, tiryagmānī,&quot;
&quot;cha yatpṛthagbhūte kurutastadubhayāṅ karoti.&quot;
:The diagonal of an oblong produces by itself both the areas which the two sides of the oblong produce separately.
The diagonal and sides referred to are those of a rectangle (oblong), and the areas are those of the squares having these line segments as their sides. Since the diagonal of a rectangle is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by two adjacent sides, the statement is seen to be equivalent to the Pythagorean theorem.

Baudhāyana also provides a statement using a rope measure of the reduced form of the Pythagorean theorem for an isosceles right triangle:

:&quot;The cord which is stretched across a square produces an area double the size of the original square.&quot;

===Circling the square===
Another problem tackled by Baudhāyana is that of finding a circle whose area is the same as that of a square (the reverse of squaring the circle). His sūtra i.58 gives this construction:

:&quot;Draw half its diagonal about the centre towards the East–West line; then describe a circle together with a third part of that which lies outside the square. &quot;

Explanation:
*Draw the half-diagonal of the square, which is larger than the half-side by formula_1.
*Then draw a circle with radius formula_2, or formula_3, which equals formula_4.
* Now formula_5, so the area formula_6.

===Square root of 2===
Baudhāyana i.61-2 (elaborated in Āpastamba Sulbasūtra i.6)
gives the length of the diagonal of a square in terms of its sides, which is equivalent to a formula for the square root of 2:

:&quot;samasya dvikaraṇī. pramāṇaṃ tṛtīyena vardhayet tac caturthenātmacatustriṃśonena saviśeṣaḥ&quot;

: The diagonal [lit. &quot;doubler&quot;] of a square. The measure is to be increased by a third and by a fourth decreased by the 34th. That is its diagonal approximately.

That is,

:formula_7

which is correct to five decimals.

Other theorems include: diagonals of rectangle bisect each other, diagonals of rhombus bisect at right angles, area of a square formed by joining the middle points of a square is half of original, the
midpoints of a rectangle joined forms a rhombus whose area is half the rectangle, etc.

Note the emphasis on rectangles and squares; this arises from the need to specify &quot;yajña bhūmikā&quot;s—i.e. the altar on which rituals were conducted, including fire offerings (yajña).

<text>Gregg Bendian (born July 13, 1963) is an American jazz drummer, percussionist, pianist, and composer.

== Early life ==
Born in Englewood, New Jersey, Bendian was raised in Fairview and Teaneck. Bendian began playing drums at the age of nine and studied under Gary Van Dyke of the New Jersey Percussion Ensemble. In high school, he began composing chamber music and studied with Noel DaCosta, Andrew Cyrille and Steve McCall.

== Career ==
Bendian has played and recorded with Nels Cline, Pat Metheny, Derek Bailey, Peter Brötzmann, Steve Hunt, Gary Lucas and Cecil Taylor amongst others. Albums recorded under his own name and that of his group Interzone, incorporate elements of fusion and free jazz.

Bendian is fond of recording tributes. With Interzone, he recorded &quot;Requiem for Jack Kirby&quot;, a tribute to the comic book artist. He has also recorded tributes to Octavia Butler and others. In 1999, he and Nels Cline released &quot;Interstellar Space Revisited&quot;, a critically acclaimed cover album of John Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Interstellar Space&quot;, which Bendian described as &quot;my love letter to Free Jazz drumming&quot;. &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD&quot; said, &quot;Hard to listen to this contemporary pairing without returning to the source material. Hard to revisit that without wanting to hear Bendian and Cline again.&quot;

In 2000, he collaborated with violinist Jeff Gauthier, bassist Steuart Liebig, and guitarist G. E. Stinson on an album of collective improvisational pieces recorded live in the studio, entitled &quot;Bone Structure&quot;. Released in 2003, it was given four stars by Jon Andrews in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine.

<text>William Fitzhugh (August 24, 1741 – June 6, 1809) was an American planter, legislator and patriot during the American Revolutionary War who served as a delegate to the Continental Congress for Virginia in 1779, as well as many terms in the House of Burgesses and both houses of the Virginia General Assembly following the Commonwealth&#x27;s formation. His Stafford County home, Chatham Manor, is on the National Register for Historic Places and serves as the National Park Service Headquarters for the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park.
==Early and family life==

Born into the First Families of Virginia, Fitzhugh was born in King George County, Virginia, where his father owned large estates, largely acquired by the latter&#x27;s grandfather before the county&#x27;s creation. His family traced its descent from Bardolph, Lord of Ravensworth in Richmondshire in the time of William the Conqueror. His great-grandfather, also William Fitzhugh (1650–1701), immigrated from England to Virginia from England about 1671, became a successful lawyer and tobacco planter as well the first member of the family to sit in the House of Burgesses (in 1677). He established &quot;Bedford&quot; plantation as his family&#x27;s seat (which was later destroyed in the Civil War) and by the time he died in 1701, owned mostly in the Northern Neck of Virginia, most of which this man inherited. His brother Henry Fitzhugh would also serve in the House of Burgesses and became high sheriff of Stafford County in 1715. William Fitzhugh&#x27;s son (also William Fitzhugh, sometimes distinguished as &quot;of Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot;), also served as a burgess before his death in 1714.

The second William Fitzhugh&#x27;s eldest son, Henry Fitzhugh, studied at Oxford University and also served in the House of Burgesses in 1738, 1740 and 1742 representing Stafford County. In 1730, he married Lucy Carter in 1730 and became the father of two daughters and this man, who was a baby when his father died in 1742. Henry Fitzhugh&#x27;s eldest daughter could not inherit land by primogeniture, but married Benjamin Grymes of Spotsylvania County, who served in the House of Burgesses as did their descendants in the Virginia General Assembly. This man&#x27;s mother, the widow Lucy Carter Fitzhugh, a daughter of Robert &quot;King&quot; Carter (the largest landowner in Virginia in his lifetime, and who also provided for several other children) remarried to the widower Colonel Nathaniel Harrison of &quot;Brandon&quot; in Prince George County, Virginia, who would serve in the Virginia Senate even though the couple had no additional children. This man, William Fitzhugh of Chatham received a private education suitable to his class. He lost an eye in a childhood accident, hit by one of his Harrison stepbrothers with a horse riding crop. Fitzhugh owned 38 slaves in Fairfax County in 1810.

Fitzhugh married Ann Bolling Randolph (1747–1805), also descended from the First Families of Virginia. His wife&#x27;s paternal grandparents were William Randolph II and Elizabeth Beverley. This Randolph connection made Ann Fitzhugh cousin to Thomas Jefferson, who visited their home in Fredericksburg. This William and Ann had daughters but only one son, William Henry Fitzhugh, who continued the family&#x27;s planter and political traditions in the 19th century.

==Career==
In addition to the political activities described below, Fitzhugh was a planter, farming large estates (in several counties in Virginia&#x27;s Northern Neck and what has now become the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) using enslaved labor. He built Chatham Manor on property in Stafford County across the Rappahannock River from Fredericksburg, Virginia, and completed it in 1771 after three years of construction. The Fitzhughs lived a lavish life there that included experimental farming, and his special passions of horse breeding and racing. After the Revolutionary War, as the economy floundered, Fitzhugh sold Chatham Manor and to Churchill Jones for $20,000.

William Fitzhugh and George Washington visited each other frequently until Washington died in 1799. Washington mentioned Fitzhugh in his diary and they served together on the Pohick Church vestry. Fitzhugh was the last person that Washington visited outside of Mount Vernon before his death.

In the 1787 Virginia tax census, Fitzhugh or relatives of the same name owned 60 enslaved adults older than 16 as well as 91 children in King George County, 4 adult and 5 child slaves in Prince William County, 54 adult and 54 child slaves in Stafford County, 57 adult and 81 child slaves in Fairfax County, and 8 adults and 10 children in Westmoreland County. A man of the same name and possibly him or a relative owned 20 adult and 23 children in nearby Caroline County (south of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County).

After the new U.S. Congress decided to move the national capital to land donated by Virginia and Maryland along the Potomac River to become the new federal city (soon Washington, D.C.), Fitzhugh moved his main residence northward from near Fredericksburg to Alexandria, across from the new federal buildings (but part of the District of Columbia from 1790 until decades after Fitzhugh&#x27;s death). His cousin Col. Henry Fitzhugh (1723–1783; son of Burgess Henry Fitzhugh who died in 1745) having died, Fitzhugh acquired much of his estate in Fairfax County (where North Springfield is now located) from his heirs. In 1796 William Fitzhugh built another mansion, that he called Ravensworth. That Fairfax County property became his country home, with the Fitzhughs spending winters at their townhouse in Alexandria. Ravensworth stood until about 1925, when it burned under mysterious circumstances.

About 1799, William Fitzhugh bought the house at 607 Oronoco Street, Alexandria, Virginia, which is now usually known as &quot;The Boyhood Home of Robert E. Lee.&quot; The house had been built in 1795 by John Potts Jr. After William Fitzhugh&#x27;s death, William Henry Fitzhugh inherited the property and rented it to the Lee family.

==Political career==
Fitzhugh first served as a legislator when Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly consisted solely of the House of Burgesses. He was one of two part-time representatives from King George County, and served alongside Joseph Jones between 1772 and 1775. When tensions with Britain escalated and Virginia colonial governor John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, dissolved the Assembly, Fitzhugh and Jones continued to serve their County in all five ad hoc Virginia Revolutionary conventions (some held in Williamsburg and others in Richmond), as well as in the first sessions of the Virginia House of Delegates after creation of the new state government. Fitzhugh was also a member of the Revolutionary Committee of Safety in 1774–75. During the American Revolutionary War Fitzhugh was a commissioner of two arms and munitions factories. He represented Stafford County as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates beginning in 1777. Somewhat ironically, Fitzhugh served and then succeeded his distant cousin, Charles Carter, who had previously represented King George County in the House of Burgesses (as had his father of the same name, but who had been disinherited for his excessive spending, won a court case in order to acquire then resell that inherited property, and used the proceeds and loans from Speaker John Robinson in order to move from King George to Stafford County, which that Charles Carter represented before, during and after the American Revolutionary War while also incurring additional personal financial problems. Meanwhile, beginning in 1781 through 1785, voters in Westmoreland, Stafford, and King George Counties elected and re-elected Fitzhugh to the state Senate. Fitzhugh last represented Stafford County in the House of Delegates in 1787–1788. In 1797, Fitzhugh was a candidate in Virginia&#x27;s 18th congressional district.

Fitzhugh also was a presidential elector for the 1789 election from Westmoreland District. That District consisted of King George County, Lancaster County, Northumberland County, Richmond County, Stafford County, and Westmoreland County, which cover the area between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers.
All ten Virginia electors who voted each cast one of his two votes for George Washington. Although Fitzhugh&#x27;s second vote is unknown, five Virginia electors also voted for John Adams, three for George Clinton, one for John Hancock, and one for John Jay. In a letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson on 29 March 1789, &#x27;Mr W Fitzhugh of Chatham&#x27; is described as a Federalist.

In 1804 Fitzhugh&#x27;s daughter Mary Lee Fitzhugh was married in the parlor of the Alexandria townhouse to George Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Dandridge Custis Washington and adopted grandson of George Washington. In 1831 their daughter, Mary Anna Randolph Custis, married Robert E. Lee.
== Death and legacy ==
Fitzhugh died in 1809 at the age of 69, leaving behind the three of his children who survived to adulthood. He was initially buried at Ravensworth, which his son William Henry Fitzhugh inherited, but when the mansion was destroyed, his remains and gravestone were moved to historic Pohick Church cemetery in Lorton. He also gave the &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;Somerset&quot; plantations in King George County to his nephews William F. Grymes, Benjamin Grymes and Geeorge N. Grymes.

<text>Oppian (, ; ), also known as Oppian of Anazarbus, of Corycus, or of Cilicia, was a 2nd-century Greco-Roman poet during the reign of the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, who composed the &quot;Halieutica&quot;, a five-book didactic epic on fishing.

==Biography==
Oppian states that he is from &#x27;the city of Hermes&#x27; and the &#x27;city at the promontory of Sarpedon&#x27;. This has been supplemented by information from the biographies attached to medieval manuscripts, which state that his birthplace was Caesarea (now known as Anazarbus) or Corycus in Cilicia, or Corycus according to the Suda. All these cities were in the Roman province of Cilicia, in what is now southern Turkey.

He composed a didactic poem in Greek hexameter on fishing (, ). It is about 3500 lines and bears a dedication to Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus, placing it to the time of their joint rule (176-180 AD).

A later didactic poem on hunting, the &quot;Cynegetica&quot; (, ), was also attributed to Oppian. For that reason, its anonymous poet is generally referred to as Pseudo-Oppian or Oppian of Apamea. Furthermore, a didactic poem on bird catching, &quot;Ixeutica&quot; (, ), which now only survives in a prose paraphrase, was also attributed to Oppian in the manuscript tradition. The &quot;Ixeutica&quot; is now thought to describe a work composed by the Dionysus whom the Suda mention as the author of a treatise on rocks (, ). A likely explanation for the attribution of all these works to Oppian is that the three didactic poems on hunting, fishing, and fowling were at some point circulated as a complementary trio.

According to the anonymous biographies attached to the Byzantine manuscripts of the &quot;Halieutica&quot;, Oppian&#x27;s father, having incurred the displeasure of a colleague of Marcus Aurelius named Lucius Verus by neglecting to pay his respects to him when he visited Rome, was banished to Malta. Oppian, who had accompanied his father into exile, returned after the death of Verus and presented his poems to Marcus Aurelius, who was so pleased with them that he gave the author a piece of gold for each line, took him into favour, and pardoned his father. Oppian subsequently returned to his native country but died of the plague shortly afterwards at the early age of thirty. His contemporaries erected a statue in his honour, with an inscription which is still extant, containing a lament for his premature death and a eulogy of his precocious genius.

==The &quot;Halieutica&quot;==
The &quot;Halieutica&quot; consists of five books, which can be divided into two parts: books 1-2 describe the behaviour of fish and other marine animals, books 3-5 contain various fishing techniques. The content of the &quot;Halieutica&quot; is not sufficient to serve as a practical guide for fishing. Instead, the humans and animals described in the work often seem to provide examples of good and bad behaviour. The fish in the &quot;Halieutica&quot; are depicted in an anthropomorphic fashion, as their behaviour is generally motivated by emotions such as hate, love, greed, jealousy and friendship. The fish are also very frequently the subject of Homeric similes. In many cases, Oppian reverses the Homeric technique: where Homer compares epic heroes with animals, the actions of animals in the &quot;Halieutica&quot; are often compared to all types of human behaviour.

The content of the &quot;Halieutica&quot; is as follows:
* Book 1: after the introduction and dedication of the work to Marcus Aurelius, the first half of the work contains a catalogue of marine animal species, sorted by their habitat (&quot;Hal&quot;. 1.80-445). The second half describes their reproductive behaviour (&quot;Hal&quot;. 1.446-797).
* Book 2: this book describes the &#x27;battles&#x27; of fish, how predators catch their prey and techniques that fish use to avoid capture by other fish.
* Book 3: the book starts with a description of the preparations for fishing (&quot;Hal&quot;. 3.29-91). It then describes how fish escape fishermen (&quot;Hal&quot;. 3.92-168). The main portion of the book contains various techniques to capture fish through their gluttony (&quot;Hal&quot;. 3.169-528), followed by a list of fish that can be caught due to their aggression and ends with tuna fishing (&quot;Hal&quot;. 3.529-648).
* Book 4: the main theme of this book is fishing through manipulating the love and lust of fish (&quot;Hal&quot;. 4.1-449). The remainder of the book describes, among other things, frightening fish (&quot;Hal&quot;. 4.502-634) and fishing with poison (&quot;Hal&quot;. 4.647-693).
* Book 5: in many ways the grand finale of the &quot;Halieutica&quot;, as it teaches you how to catch the largest animals of the sea, including whales, sharks, and dolphins. The work is concluded by a section on the fatal outcome of sponge diving. (&quot;Hal&quot;. 5.612-680)

<text>The Middle Paleolithic (or Middle Palaeolithic) is the second subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age as it is understood in Europe, Africa and Asia. The term Middle Stone Age is used as an equivalent or a synonym for the Middle Paleolithic in African archeology. The Middle Paleolithic broadly spanned from 300,000 to 50,000 years ago. There are considerable dating differences between regions. The Middle Paleolithic was succeeded by the Upper Paleolithic subdivision which first began between 50,000 and 40,000 years ago. Pettit and White date the Early Middle Paleolithic in Great Britain to about 325,000 to 180,000 years ago (late Marine Isotope Stage 9 to late Marine Isotope Stage 7), and the Late Middle Paleolithic as about 60,000 to 35,000 years ago. The Middle Paleolithic was in the geological Chibanian (Middle Pleistocene) and Late Pleistocene ages.

According to the theory of the recent African origin of modern humans, anatomically modern humans began migrating out of Africa during the Middle Stone Age/Middle Paleolithic around 125,000 years ago and began to replace other &quot;Homo&quot; species such as the Neanderthals and &quot;Homo erectus&quot;.

==Origin of behavioral modernity==

The earliest evidence of behavioral modernity first appears during the Middle Paleolithic; undisputed evidence of behavioral modernity, however, only becomes common during the following Upper Paleolithic period.

Middle Paleolithic burials at sites such as Krapina in Croatia (dated to 130,000 BP) and the Qafzeh and Es Skhul caves in Israel ( 100,000 BP) have led some anthropologists and archeologists (such as Philip Lieberman) to believe that Middle Paleolithic cultures may have possessed a developing religious ideology which included concepts such as an afterlife; other scholars suggest the bodies were buried for secular reasons.

According to recent archeological findings from &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; sites in the Atapuerca Mountains, the practice of intentional burial may have begun much earlier during the late Lower Paleolithic, but this theory is widely questioned in the scientific community. Cut-marks on Neandertal bones from various sites – such as Combe Grenal and the Moula rock shelter in France – may imply that Neanderthals, like some contemporary human cultures, may have practiced excarnation for presumably religious reasons (see Neanderthal behavior § Cannibalism or ritual defleshing?).

The earliest undisputed evidence of artistic expression during the Paleolithic period comes from Middle Paleolithic/Middle Stone Age sites such as Blombos Cave in the form of bracelets, beads, art rock, ochre used as body paint and perhaps in ritual, though earlier examples of artistic expression such as the Venus of Tan-Tan and the patterns found on elephant bones from Bilzingsleben in Thuringia may have been produced by Acheulean tool-users such as &quot;Homo erectus&quot; prior to the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. Activities such as catching large fish and hunting large game animals with specialized tools indicate increased group-wide cooperation and more elaborate social organization.

In addition to developing advanced cultural traits, humans also first began to take part in long-distance trade between groups for rare commodities (such as ochre (which was often used for religious purposes such as ritual)) and raw materials during the Middle Paleolithic as early as 120,000 years ago.
Inter-group trade may have appeared during the Middle Paleolithic because trade between bands would have helped ensure their survival by allowing them to exchange resources and commodities such as raw materials during times of relative scarcity (i.e., famine or drought).

==Social stratification==
Evidence from archeology and comparative ethnography indicates that Middle Paleolithic people lived in small, egalitarian band societies similar to those of Upper Paleolithic societies and some modern hunter-gatherers such as the ǃKung and Mbuti peoples. Both Neanderthal and modern human societies took care of the elderly members of their societies during the Middle Paleolithic. Christopher Boehm (1999) has hypothesized that egalitarianism may have arisen in Middle Paleolithic societies because of a need to distribute resources such as food and meat equally to avoid famine and ensure a stable food supply.

It has usually been assumed that women gathered plants and firewood and men hunted and scavenged dead animals through the Paleolithic. However, Steven L. Kuhn and Mary Stiner from the University of Arizona suggest that this sex-based division of labor did not exist prior to the Upper Paleolithic. The sexual division of labor may have evolved after 45,000 years ago to allow humans to acquire food and other resources more efficiently.

==Nutrition==
Although gathering and hunting comprised most of the food supply during the Middle Paleolithic, people began to supplement their diet with seafood and began smoking and drying meat to preserve and store it. For instance the Middle Stone Age inhabitants of the region now occupied by the Democratic Republic of the Congo hunted large long catfish with specialized barbed fishing points as early as 90,000 years ago, and Neandertals and Middle Paleolithic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in Africa began to catch shellfish for food as revealed by shellfish cooking in Neanderthal sites in Italy about 110,000 years ago and Middle Paleolithic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; sites at Pinnacle Point, in Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTIMES/10/08/07&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists such as Tim D. White suggest that cannibalism was common in human societies prior to the beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, based on the large amount of &quot;butchered human&quot; bones found in Neandertal and other Middle Paleolithic sites. Cannibalism in the Middle Paleolithic may have occurred because of food shortages.

However it is also possible that Middle Paleolithic cannibalism occurred for religious reasons which would coincide with the development of religious practices thought to have occurred during the Upper Paleolithic. Nonetheless it remains possible that Middle Paleolithic societies never practiced cannibalism and that the damage to recovered human bones was either the result of excarnation or predation by carnivores such as saber-toothed cats, lions and hyenas.

==Technology==

Around 200,000 BP Middle Paleolithic Stone tool manufacturing spawned a tool-making technique known as the prepared-core technique, that was more elaborate than previous Acheulean techniques. Wallace and Shea split the core artifacts into two different types: formal cores and expedient cores. Formal cores are designed to extract the maximum amount from the raw material while expedient cores are based more upon functional need. This method increased efficiency by permitting the creation of more controlled and consistent flakes. This method allowed Middle Paleolithic humans correspondingly to create stone-tipped spears, which were the earliest composite tools, by hafting sharp, pointy stone flakes onto wooden shafts. Paleolithic groups such as the Neanderthals who possessed a Middle Paleolithic level of technology appear to have hunted large game just as well as Upper Paleolithic modern humans and the Neanderthals in particular may have likewise hunted with projectile weapons.

Nonetheless Neanderthal usage of projectile weapons in hunting occurred very rarely (or perhaps never) and the Neanderthals hunted large game animals mostly by ambushing them and attacking them with mêlée weapons such as thrusting spears rather than attacking them from a distance with projectile weapons. An ongoing controversy about the nature of Middle Paleolithic tools is whether there were a series of functionally specific and preconceived tool forms or whether there was a simple continuum of tool morphology that reflect the extent of edge maintenance, as Harold L. Dibble has suggested.

The use of fire became widespread for the first time in human prehistory during the Middle Paleolithic, and humans began to cook their food c. 250,000 years ago. Some scientists have hypothesized that hominids began cooking food to defrost frozen meat which would help ensure their survival in cold regions. Robert K. Wayne, a molecular biologist, has controversially claimed, based on a comparison of canine DNA, that dogs may have been first domesticated during the Middle Paleolithic around or even before 100,000 BCE.

<doc id="1158722" wikidata="Q2165214" url="?curid=1158722" title="Ezo (band)">
<text>was a Japanese heavy metal band originally formed as Flatbacker in the spring of 1982 in Sapporo, Japan out of the remnants of two high school bands, Power-Station and Scrap. EZO has been named a &quot;seminal influence by such artists as Steve McDonald of Redd Kross and Michael Steele of The Bangles.&quot;

==History==
EZO consisted of Masaki Yamada (vocals), Taro Takahashi (bass), Shoyo Iida (guitar) and Hiro Homma (drums). They released one demo cassette (&quot;Minagoroshi&quot;) in 1984 and two albums (1985&#x27;s &quot;Senzo&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Esa&quot;) in Japan as Flatbacker in the mid-1980s before coming to the U.S. Rumor has it that Gene Simmons of Kiss, who produced their self-titled U.S. debut album, was behind the band&#x27;s name change to EZO, inspired by Ezo, an ancient name for Hokkaidō. They released two albums for Geffen Records, 1987&#x27;s &quot;EZO&quot; and 1989&#x27;s Fire Fire, before being dropped from the label and internal differences led to the band&#x27;s demise.

Vocalist Masaki Yamada joined fellow Japanese heavy metal band Loudness in 1992 and drummer Hiro Homma joined Loudness in 1994. In 2000, the original Loudness lineup reunited and Masaki and Hiro left the band. Hiro Homma was the drummer for the Japanese metal band Anthem from 2001 to 2013 and vocalist Masaki Yamada is now the bass player for the New York-based band FiRESiGN.

A single guitar riff from &quot;EZO&quot; song &quot;House of 1,000 Pleasures&quot; served as the signature sound of syndicated radio network Z Rock.

<doc id="1158735" wikidata="Q253360" url="?curid=1158735" title="Figure skating at the 1998 Winter Olympics">
<text>The figure skating events in 1998 Winter Olympics were held at the White Ring in Nagano. There were no changes in the format or scoring systems from 1994. Professionals were again allowed to compete, although they had to declare that intention and compete in ISU-approved events to do so. Previously, the ISU had been accused of rejecting Western professionals, while allowing Eastern Bloc state-sponsored &quot;amateurs&quot; to compete. Most of the top competitors by 1998 were now openly professional.

The competitions took place on the following days:
* Pairs: 8–10 February 1998
* Men&#x27;s singles: 12–14 February 1998
* Ice dance: 13–16 February 1998
* Ladies&#x27; singles: 18–20 February 1998
* Exhibition gala: 21 February 1998

==Results==

===Men===
The favourites and top two after the short program were Ilia Kulik and Elvis Stojko, who would skate first and last, respectively. Medal contenders Alexei Yagudin, Todd Eldredge and Philippe Candeloro went in between. Steven Cousins was the other skater in the final draw, but he was not considered to have a realistic chance of making the podium.

Kulik skated a flawless program which included a quad toe loop to open the last session. Yagudin, who was one of several athletes suffering from the flu during these games, fell on his quad attempt and his triple Axel, which took him out of medal contention. Eldredge was skating cleanly until he popped what was to be his second triple Axel, and then he fell again when he tried to complete the jump again in the closing seconds. Candeloro, with the exception of a step out on his triple Axel, skated his program flawlessly to end up second in the free skating. Stojko, who skated last, originally intended to perform a quad toe loop/triple toe loop combination. However, a partial groin tear and the flu prevented him from attempting the combo, so he downgraded his quad to a triple. Despite his injury, he skated a clean program but finished the free skating third, placing second overall behind Kulik.

The countries represented by the podium finishers were the same as in the men&#x27;s competition at the Lillehammer 1994 games, with Stojko and Candeloro getting their second consecutive silver and bronze medals, respectively. In a noteworthy instance, Stojko had to limp to the podium on sneakers at the medal presentation. He also did not skate at the figure skating gala, although he did take the ice briefly to announce that he would skip the World Championships next month.

===Ladies===
The primary contenders for the gold medal were Americans Tara Lipinski and Michelle Kwan. Kwan and Lipinski were in first and second place respectively after the short program. In the free skating, both Lipinski and Kwan skated clean. 6 judges placed Lipinski ahead of Kwan, and three placed Kwan ahead of Lipinski, which meant Lipinski won the gold medal, and Kwan took the silver.

The primary competitors for the bronze medal were Maria Butyrskaya and Irina Slutskaya from Russia, and Chen Lu from China. In the free skating, they all skated well, but had mistakes. The final placements were very close. The 3rd–5th place votes were split unevenly between Chen, Butyrskaya, and Slutskaya. Chen beat Butyrskaya by the tally of 5 judges to 4 and beat Slutskaya 6 judges to 3, giving Chen her second straight bronze medal in the Olympic Games.

Tara Lipinski (gold), Michelle Kwan (silver) and Chen Lu (bronze) were the World Champions in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Lipinski also became the youngest competitor in Winter Olympics history to earn a gold medal in an individual event.

While not a medal winner, France&#x27;s injured Surya Bonaly, who placed 10th, completed an (illegal) backflip during her long program, making her the fourth person and only woman to ever land a backflip in competition. She is the only person to land on one foot and to do a split mid-air (now colloquially referred to as a &#x27;Bonaly&#x27;). She performed the unorthodox maneuver as a result of a previous fall and poor program due to an injured foot, however given the illegal nature of the move, her backflip was not considered when grading her technical merit.

===Pairs===
Artur Dmitriev of Russia won his second Olympic gold here. He had previously won in 1992 with a different partner. He was the first man to win the Olympics more than once with different partners. The first woman to do so was Russian skater Irina Rodnina, who won three Olympics with two different partners.

===Ice dance===
Grishuk and Platov became the first pair ever to repeat as champions in Olympic Ice Dance. They won 21 straight events before they won in Nagano.

The judging was marred by accusations that the Europeans colluded in &quot;bloc voting&quot; (where judges tend to favor skaters from their regions), so that the dance teams representing their countries would take the medals, while keeping the Canadians off the podium.

<doc id="1158736" wikidata="Q375957" url="?curid=1158736" title="James Bourne">
<text>James Elliot Bourne (born 13 September 1983) is an English singer-songwriter and musician. He is known as the co-founder of pop-punk bands Busted and Son of Dork, and he also created his own electronic project under the alias Future Boy. From 2013 to 2015 he was a member of McBusted, which consisted of himself, Busted bandmate Matt Willis, and McFly.

==Early life==
Bourne was born in Rochford, Essex to Peter and Maria Bourne and moved to Southend-on-Sea at age ten months. He has a sister named Melissa and two brothers named Nick and Chris.

Bourne attended the independent fee-paying Thorpe Hall School in Southend-on-Sea. Bourne plays electric guitar, piano, drums and bass guitar. He later attended Morgan Academy of Performing Arts, based in Essex.

==Music career==
===Busted===

At the age of 17, Bourne dropped out of the South East Essex College course in Music Technology to pursue his music career. He met Matt Willis at a gig and they started writing songs together at Bourne&#x27;s house in Southend. Willis and Bourne placed an ad for a third band member in &quot;NME&quot; magazine. They held auditions and after listening to a few songs the two had written together, Charlie Simpson joined the band. After signing to Universal in 2002, Busted released their first single, &quot;What I Go to School For&quot;, from their self-titled debut album in September that year, which quickly became No. 3 in the UK charts. &quot;Year 3000&quot; soon followed and became a hit as well reaching No. 2 in the charts, their third single &quot;You Said No&quot; was a No. 1 hit.

By the end of the band&#x27;s career, they had managed eight top 10 singles and four number ones – &quot;You Said No&quot;, &quot;Crashed the Wedding&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s David&quot; and &quot;Thunderbirds Are Go&quot;. Despite their success, Busted split on 14 January 2005 after just three years, following Simpson&#x27;s decision to leave the band to concentrate on his side project Fightstar.

On 10 November 2015 Busted announced their return as a band, featuring Simpson again. They also announced a 2016 nationwide tour, Pigs Can Fly Tour 2016. Their third album, &quot;Night Driver&quot;, was released on 25 November 2016. Their fourth studio album titled &quot;Half Way There&quot; was also released in 2019. At the latter end of that year, Bourne announced a new solo project – officially announcing Busted to be on their first hiatus since the split. In March 2023 they announced a tour to take place in September of the same year, they also re-released some songs from their first two albums, including Loser Kid and Meet You There. In these re-released they collaborated with other bands such as Simple Plan and Neck Deep, the songs were in more of a rock style than their original calmer renditions.

===Son of Dork===

After Busted disbanded in January 2005, Bourne formed a new pop rock band named Son of Dork. They released their first single, &quot;Ticket Outta Loserville&quot; in November 2005 followed by their debut album, &quot;Welcome to Loserville&quot;, two weeks later. Their second single Eddie&#x27;s Song reached No 10 in the UK charts. They also contributed to the soundtrack of British Comedy film &quot;Alien Autopsy&quot;.

The band ended in 2007 after Bourne had to dedicate his energy to an ongoing lawsuit for the rights to the Busted songs. He has, however, been open for a reunion though stated he would only bring back the members who wanted to come back. Bourne did reunite with bassist Steven Rushton and guitarist Chris Leonard to perform Man in the Mirror with Welsh Comedy Duo Lilygreen &amp; Maguire.

===Future Boy===

Following Son of Dork, Bourne pursued a musical career as a solo artist under the name Future Boy. In June 2009, Bourne announced that he had begun recording his debut solo album; &quot;not a rock album. It is 100% electronic.&quot; Volume 1 was produced and mixed by Tommy Henriksen and Bourne at Henriksen&#x27;s Anarchy Studio&#x27;s in Nashville and Los Angeles. Side A of &quot;Volume 1&quot; was released on 3 May 2010; the album was released via his official website and not a record label. Side B would be released on 3 June. Side B featured a further five songs, including a ballad with his then girlfriend Gabriela Arciero. As part of Valentine&#x27;s Day, Future Boy posted a new track on Facebook called &quot;Dangerous&quot;; the song didn&#x27;t make the final cut for &quot;Volume 1&quot;.

Although &quot;Volume 2&quot; was officially announced in February 2011 for a 3 May 2012 release as a Facebook video game &quot;Space Travellers&quot;, the album has yet to surface due to technical difficulties and other commitments. Bourne confirmed in 2020 that the second album was &#x27;mixed and mastered&#x27; but he would not be releasing it due to his commitment to his solo career.

===Solo projects===

In 2012, Bourne did his debut solo acoustic tour across the UK. Dates included London, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Islingon and Birmingham, with Matt Willis and wife, Emma Willis, as well as family members coming to support him. His set consisted of a mixture of songs from Busted, Future Boy and Son of Dork. He went on to do a brief tour in Spain.

On 31 December 2019, Bourne announced a new solo project but reassured Busted fans that the band was not splitting up, tweeting &quot;After twenty amazing years making music, I am stepping into 2020 on a brand new solo adventure. Busted will always be my band. But, I’ve dreamed for years about releasing my own album so here we go.&quot; His first album &quot;Safe Journey Home&quot; was self 
released in late 2020 on his own Bad Apple label. Bourne announced a follow-up album, &quot;Sugar Beach&quot;, on his Twitter for a Summer 2021 release.

===McBusted===

In 2013, Bourne supported for McFly, which was later referred to by the newly formed McBusted as the starting point for ideas of McFly and Busted joining as a contribution to the McFly tour, which then later sparked ideas of their own McBusted tour. McBusted released their self-titled debut album on 1 December 2014, with a large portion of the tracks written/co-written by Bourne. Some tracks on the album were from some of Bourne&#x27;s previous musical projects like &quot;What Happened To Your Band&quot; that was originally written for Son of Dork and &quot;Beautiful Girls Are The Loneliest&quot; which was intended for his solo project. McBusted went on a 21 date tour in 2015 and performed songs from their new album as well as previous McFly and Busted hits.

===Other projects===
In early 2013, Bourne formed a band with his brother Chris Bourne called the Bourne Insanity. They independently released their first single &quot;Mohawk&quot; on 16 April, written solely by Chris. In late 2013, Bourne announced via Twitter that he had posted &quot;secret&quot; music under a different name on iTunes. The band was later revealed to be &quot;88&quot;, which was Bourne and fellow musician Eric Bazilian. 88 released their first single, &quot;Angels Walk Beside You&quot;, on 5 December 2013, and on 8 February 2014 they released their second single &quot;Miss the Girl&quot;.

==Songwriting==

Bourne wrote the majority of Busted&#x27;s two albums with Matt Willis, Charlie Simpson and Tom Fletcher (McFly). Busted&#x27;s style of music can also be identified in Son of Dork&#x27;s poppier songs. He explains that his solo writing process is very similar to the creative process of Busted, though things move &quot;20% faster&quot; when he writes on his own.

Bourne has co-writing credits on the first four McFly albums – &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;, &quot;Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Motion in the Ocean&quot; and &quot;&quot;, contributing to the majority of the tracks on the former.

He is given writing credits for artists such as Melanie C for whom he wrote &quot;Immune&quot; for her fourth studio album &quot;This Time&quot;. Other artists Bourne has written for include MC Lars, with whom he wrote the song &quot;Twenty-three&quot; on the &quot;This Gigantic Robot Kills&quot; album, and Pat Monahan, with whom he co-wrote &quot;Great Escape&quot; on the album &quot;Last of Seven&quot;. Bourne has recently been writing with his girlfriend&#x27;s band The Lunabelles and JC Chasez as well as unknown artists as a part of Metrophonic. He has also helped write songs for the British drama &quot;Britannia High&quot;. He also wrote Eoghan Quigg&#x27;s debut solo single &quot;28,000 Friends&quot;, which was originally performed by Bourne at The Living Room, New York on 11 October 2007. He also co-wrote the Saturdays song, &quot;Forever Is Over&quot;, which was released on 2 October and reached number two in the charts. Bourne has also written for Gabriella Cilmi.

In November 2009, Bourne collaborated with Leon G. Thomas III to write the song &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Change Your Mind&quot;.

In 2014, Bourne was writing songs for supergroup McBusted, The Vamps and 5 Seconds of Summer. This includes the song &quot;Daylight&quot; by 5 Seconds of Summer which was cowritten with his brother Chris Bourne. Despite his prolific credits, Bourne says he much prefers writing for himself because he can be &quot;more in tune&quot; with his own songs.

==Musical theatre==

===&quot;Loserville: The Musical!&quot;===

In February 2009, Youth Music Theatre UK commissioned Bourne, along with his friend Elliot Davis, to write a musical based on the Son of Dork album &quot;Welcome to Loserville&quot;, &quot;Loserville: The Musical&quot;. The tickets for the 20 August premiere went up for sale on 7 May. The slogan used for the musical is &quot;I guess it really pays to be a slacker...&quot;, and is centred around 17-year-old Michael Dork, who is called a nerd, geek and slacker by others. Bourne tweeted that the musical would be hitting London&#x27;s West End in 2011; however, it eventually opened on 1 October 2012 at the Garrick Theatre. From 18 June 2012 to 14 July 2012 the musical ran in Leeds at the West Yorkshire Playhouse.
The show opened at the Garrick Theatre on 17 October 2012, following previews from 1 October officially beginning its tour on the West End. The production was originally set to run until 2 March 2013, but closed early on 5 January 2013. The production included past Son of Dork band member Danny Hall on drums.

===&quot;Out There: The Musical&quot;===
In 2011, Youth Music Theatre once again commissioned Bourne and Davis to write a new, original musical called &quot;Out There&quot;. First presented as a workshop presentation in a small theatre west of London, the musical is set in the fictional town of Hope, Texas, and follows the story of Logan Carter, who is on the run from his home town near Detroit after committing a minor felony. Hope is a dead-end, one-horse town (even the horse has died) and its inhabitants are searching for ways to rescue the town from obscurity and financial ruin. Meanwhile, a few miles away in the desert, an old man is building something weird in his outhouse.

In July 2012, the original Youth Music Theatre cast and crew reunited to put on several performances at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, London, with new songs added. Prior to this, a funding page was set up to allow them to perform and although they didn&#x27;t reach their $15,000 goal they still went ahead with the shows.

The musical is available to have amateur and professional performances in schools and the stage through the Josef Weinbeger LTD.

===&quot;Murder at the Gates&quot;===
In 2013, Bourne announced another musical he had been working on, &quot;Murder at the Gates&quot;. This time, the musical sees Bourne working with &quot;Spring Awakening&quot; writer Steven Sater, who has penned with book &amp; lyrics for this musical whereas Bourne worked solely on the music score. The musical had a trial run performance of three shows in New York under NYU in September 2013 using NYU students. &quot;Murder at the Gates&quot; is set in a posh gated community in a manor where a costume birthday party is being held for a murder mystery play.

==Personal life==
Bourne has a good relationship with the band members of McFly, especially Tom Fletcher, with whom he wrote several songs for both bands.

Bourne owns an American skating and apparel company called SicPuppy, named after a band he was once a member of. Bourne paid over £16,000 for his own record company, SicPuppy Records, which, in 2007, gave unsigned bands a chance to play on the Sic Tour 2007 at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. The event was hosted by David Gest and Matt Willis. Musicians who played the event are now pop industry music producers such as Jon Maguire and Phil Gornell.

Bourne dated Instagram and YouTube influencer Emily Canham for five years. Emily announced their split in a video posted on her Emily Canham vlogs YouTube channel on July 25, 2023.

<text>The University of Johannesburg, colloquially known as UJ, is a public university located in Johannesburg, South Africa. The University of Johannesburg was established on 1 January 2005 as the result of a merger between the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), the Technikon Witwatersrand (TWR) and the Soweto and East Rand campuses of Vista University. Prior to the merger, the Daveyton and Soweto campuses of the former Vista University had been incorporated into RAU. As a result of the merger of Rand Afrikaans University (RAU), it is common for alumni to refer to the university as RAU.

The institution is one of the largest comprehensive contact universities in South Africa from the 26 public universities that make up the higher education system. UJ has a student population of more than 50,000, of which more than 3,000 are international students from 80 countries.

==History==

===Early developments===

British colonialism, 1900s
During the Johannesburg gold rush, several training institutions were established to meet the skilled labour needs of the gold mines. One such institution was the &quot;Witwatersrand Technical Institute&quot;, founded in 1903, with origins tracing back to the Kimberly School of Mines. It later evolved into Technikon Witwatersrand in 1979, following the British educational model with English as the medium of instruction. Admission policies were initially restricted to white students proficient in English. In 2006, the University of Johannesburg, which had already absorbed the operations of Technikon Witwatersrand, sold the institute&#x27;s property.

Independence, 1960sIt would take more than thirty years before complete independence of South Africa from Britain was achieved. Following its election in 1948 the National Party sought to provide education in the Afrikaans language, the third most spoken mother-tongue language in South Africa. This led to the foundation of Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) in 1966. At the time of its founding, RAU was the second university to be established in Johannesburg and it was established through an act of parliament as the academic hub for Afrikaners. After the fall of Apartheid in 1994, African students started to become more involved in previously white institutions of higher education. RAU was no exception as for the first time in 1995, it had the largest number of African students in its ranks, followed by the University of the Witwatersrand, Rhodes University and the University of Cape Town.

In 1982, Vista University admitted the first black students in designated urban black settlements across South Africa. It was established in Port Elizabeth. It had seven satellite campuses throughout South African townships, making tertiary education accessible to most African people, and it had its first academic year in 1983.

===Recent history===
It was envisioned that a modern university would spring from unification, and not separation, as it was enforced in the past. The University of Johannesburg, established on 1 January 2005, is the result of the incorporation of the East Rand and Soweto campuses of Vista University into the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU). The merger of the modified RAU and the Technikon Witwatersrand took place on 1 January 2005 thus creating the University of Johannesburg.

The integration of these institutions – with seemingly more differences than similarities, offers the University of Johannesburg a unique identity and character, which serves to bridge the chasms that previously divided South Africa. Indeed, no other university in South Africa truly represents the rainbow nation like the University of Johannesburg.

The incorporation and merger was part of a series of major programmes that restructured higher education in South Africa; a result of the National Plan for Higher Education (2001). Consequently, this meant there was a reduction from 36 universities and technikons to 22 higher education institutions. South Africa now has 11 traditional universities, five universities of technology and six comprehensive institutions.

Logo and brand identityThe University of Johannesburg distinguishes itself from its previous institutions as a new, adaptable and progressive institution. Early on it was decided that UJ did not want a coat of arms and motto, as is custom with other tertiary educational institutions in South Africa. The administration decided rather to opt for a logo and brand identity. An internal competition was held where current students could put forward their proposals. In the interim, the previous motto of the Rand Afrikaans University &quot;Diens Deur Kennis&quot; (Afrikaans for &quot;Service Through Knowledge&quot;) was maintained.

Key elements of the logo include:

* Two Birds: Facing each other, these birds symbolize the union of two respected institutions, forming a new, influential entity. They represent freedom—the freedom to achieve potential, explore academic, personal, and social possibilities, and aspire to greater heights.
* Open Book: The space between the birds forms the image of an open book, representing a blank slate for students and staff to write their futures. It also symbolises the Book of Knowledge, highlighting the continuous development and renewal of knowledge and the endless nature of learning.
* Torch of Learning: An abstract element between the birds&#x27; heads, symbolising diversity and the wide range of qualifications offered by the university.

The official logo, designed by Joey Hifi, features two African hoopoes (Upupa africana), which is also the official mascot of the UJ Sports Bureau.

==Campuses==
UJ has four campuses: the Auckland Park Kingsway, Auckland Park Bunting Road, Doornfontein and Soweto campuses – all located in the metropolitan area of the City of Johannesburg.

The university comprises a built-up area over 45,000m2 and the facilities available at the respective campuses include:
* Lecture rooms and micro-laboratories
* Libraries
* Sports facilities
* Auditoriums, halls, galleries and conference venues
* Student shopping centres, restaurants and cafeterias
* Campus and health clinics.
* A villa for postgraduate students
* Court rooms

UJ owns an island in the Vaal River, formerly known as RAU Island.

===Auckland Park, Kingsway===
* Auckland Park (APK), or the Kingsway Campus Auckland Park (former RAU campus) 
APK, is the largest and most populated campus of the University of Johannesburg. It is also the seat of the administration and governance body of the university. The campus was formerly the only educational campus of the Rand Afrikaans University. The campus gets its name from a major Johannesburg road, Kingsway Avenue, that runs along the north-east side of the campus. The roads that form the boundary of the campus are (clock-wise) University Road, Ditton Avenue, Ripley Road, Hampton Avenue, Studente Avenue, Akademie Road and Perth Road. Although the official name of the campus implies that it is in Auckland Park, it actually falls just out of that suburb by one street. It is technically in the suburb of Rossmore with the first-year parking lot bordering the suburb of Melville, Gauteng.

===Auckland Park, Bunting Road===
* Auckland Park, Bunting Road (APB), or the Bunting Road Campus Auckland Park (former TWR campus)
The ABP was originally a campus of the Technikon Witwatersrand. Uniquely, the campus is an enclosed section of a suburb. The main thoroughfare of the suburb is Bunting Road. The name Bunting Road, according to the City of Johannesburg archives is derived from a subspecies of bird and not the decorative banner it is currently associated with. It houses the Faculty of Art, Design and Architecture.

===Doornfontein===
* Doornfontein (DFC), or the Doornfontein Campus (former TWR campus). It houses the administrative offices of the Faculty of Health Sciences, as well sub faculties of Engineering and Built Environment as well as Science. The campus offers several health services to the public via its private, yet affordable clinics. These clinics are most served by students obtaining clinic hours required prior to that of the completion of qualification. The faculty has several practical and academic workspaces available for students including a large practical workshop for the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment; Rescue Simulation Center; Laser Research Facilities and Anatomical Dissection Hall for the Faculty of Health Sciences; and several laboratories serving for faculties of Health Science, Engineering and Built Environment, and Science.

===Soweto===
* Soweto (SWC), or the Soweto Campus (former RAU campus, previously former Vista University Soweto campus)

The East Rand Campus (ERC) was temporarily closed halfway through 2007 pending proposed redevelopment of the campus, provisionally planned for reopening in 2009.

==Organisation and administration==
The university&#x27;s administration is structured into various departments and units, each with specific roles and responsibilities.

==Academic profile==
The university is home to nine faculties.

===Admission and registration===
As it is a common practice with all South African universities, South African applicants to the University of Johannesburg are required to apply in advance for admission into their preferred course by no later than the end of September. Therefore, prospective South African matriculants must apply for their preferred course of study before the completion of their matric year. As of 2013, the University of Johannesburg has adopted a &quot;no walk-in&quot; policy and therefore, prospective and current students are required to apply for admission and complete their registration online.

International students have to comply with a specialised admission process and must apply for admission into their preferred course by no later than the end of September.

Registration for undergraduates and postgraduates takes place before the commencement of the academic year. New registrations for qualifying matriculants takes place in January shortly after the matric results are released.

===Teaching and degrees===
Undergraduate teaching takes place over the duration of four terms or two semesters during the course of the year. Some subjects are taught throughout the duration of the year known as year-long subjects and other subjects are taught over the course of two terms or one semester. Some subjects have prerequisites such as a requirement for a student to complete a specific course or subject/s before they are permitted to continue with a related subject.

The teaching terms usually coincide with Gauteng public school terms though can change as the university administration sees fit.

Undergraduate programmeOnce a high school student has passed their Matric examinations obtaining an NQF level 5 qualification and meeting the minimum requirements of their chosen undergraduate programme the student may pursue a bachelor&#x27;s degree, Advanced Diploma, Post Graduate Certificate or B-tech which are set to be completed within three years for most faculties however, there are sometimes options to extend ones undergraduate programme usually by an extra year. Once a graduate has passed all of the requisite modules for their degree, the graduate will obtain a degree certificate (NQF level 7) with all the rights and privileges conferred on them by the university in accordance with the National Qualifications Framework (NQF).

The University of Johannesburg also offers undergraduate Higher Certificates and Advanced National (vocational) Certificates (NQF level 5) as well as National Diplomas and Advanced certificates (NQF level 6) which usually require fewer than three years to complete.

Graduate programmeOnce an undergraduate has obtained their undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degree, Advanced Diploma, Post Graduate Certificate or B-tech, the undergraduate may wish to pursue further education and research by obtaining a post-graduate degree. The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) is a statutory body, regulated in terms of the National Qualifications Framework Act that governs the National Qualification Framework (NQF) where an undergraduate may progress to further levels of education. The highest level the university may confer on a student is an NQF level of 10, also known as a PhD. The progression from one NQF level to the next after obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree, advanced diploma, post-graduate certificate or B-tech is the following:
* NQF level 8 - honours degree, post-graduate diploma and professional qualifications
* NQF level 9 - master&#x27;s degree
* NQF level 10 - doctor&#x27;s (PhD) degree

===Scholarships and financial support===
There are many opportunities for students studying at the University of Johannesburg to receive financial support. One of the primary methods in which a student may receive financial support is as a result of a students academic performance at the end of their matriculation year. This type of financial support is known as an academic merit bursary that is only awarded to students who observe the stringent &quot;M-score&quot; academic requirements of such support. The academic merit bursary offers up to 100% payment of tuition fees and an additional stipend amount to qualifying applicants.

An alumni bursary is offered to qualifying postgraduate students that may be applied for in the applicants respective faculty offices. Postgraduate students may apply for funding through the National Research Foundation (NRF) that offers up to 100% payment of tuition fees and an additional stipend amount to qualifying applicants.

Alternative funding includes applying for funding through the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) as well as through applying for funding through external sponsorship bursaries.

The &quot;UJ Observer&quot; also offers journalism students a practical platform to learn and develop journalistic and managerial skill sets. However, students do not necessarily have to be journalism students to be a members of the &quot;UJ Observer&quot;″s editorial team. The paper operates on all of the campuses of the University of Johannesburg.

Students interested in taking part in charity events can do so via UJ&#x27;s RAG (Remember and Give) committees, which are voluntary student organizations that raise funds and take part in community relief efforts. It is a tradition at UJ to host a RAG Week during the opening week of the academic year, in which events like musical performances, beauty competitions, fun days and float processions take place to generate funds. However, RAG committees operate throughout the academic year in various activities.

Registered students have the option to take part in societies at UJ which are divided into four broad kinds of society: academic societies, political societies, religious societies and social societies.

* United States president Barack Obama visited the University of Johannesburg&#x27;s Soweto campus on Saturday 29 June 2013. The main reasons for his visit included addressing questions relating to terrorism, the economy, trade in Africa and the US foreign policy. Obama addressed the young African leaders in Soweto, a historic part of South Africa which is now symbolic of tourism, culture, and a growing middle class. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Johannesburg.

Controversy

In 2011 the university decided to suspend ties with Israeli Ben-Gurion University, citing the university&#x27;s support for the Israeli military. The decision was seen to affect projects in biotechnology and water purification.

However, two days later, Ihron Rensburg, vice-chancellor and principal of the university issued a statement saying that &quot;UJ is not part of an academic boycott of Israel...It has never been UJ&#x27;s intention to sever all ties with BGU, although it may have been the intention of some UJ staff members.&quot;

<doc id="1158774" wikidata="Q88748" url="?curid=1158774" title="Willibald Beyschlag">
<text>Johann Heinrich Christoph Willibald Beyschlag (5 September 1823 – 25 November 1900 in Halle an der Saale) was a German theologian from Frankfurt am Main.

== Biography ==
He studied theology at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin, afterwards serving as an assistant pastor in Koblenz (1849), then as a pastor in Trier (1850). During the following year, Beyschlag began working as a religious instructor in Mainz. In 1856 he became a court preacher in Karlsruhe, and four years later, he was appointed a professor of practical theology and New Testament exegesis at the University of Halle.

Beyschlag was the leader of the &quot;Kirchenpartei&quot; called &quot;Mittelpartei&quot; (&quot;Middle Party&quot;), and in 1876, with Albrecht Wolters, founded the &quot;Deutsch-evangelische Blätter&quot; (a publication of the &quot;Mittelpartei&quot; in the &quot;Kirche der Altpreußischen Union&quot;). Because of the combative nature of the magazine, he was once sued for libel. Also, he was a primary catalyst in the founding of the &quot;&quot; (Protestant Confederation) — he believed that only in unity could German Protestantism find strength.

He was a leading supporter of the &quot;Vermittlungstheologie&quot; and was opposed to Chalcedonian Christology. Also, he stood for the rights of the laity, and believed in the autonomy of the church, leading him to be in favor of separation of church and state. Beyschlag was viewed as an antagonist of the Roman Catholic Church and a sharp critic of Ultramontanism.

== Selected works ==
In 1891 he published &quot;Neutestamentliche Theologie, oder, geschichtliche Darstellung der lehren Jesu und des Urchristenthums nach den neutestamentlichen Quellen&quot;, a book that was later translated into English and published as &quot;New Testament theology; or, Historical account of the teaching of Jesus and of primitive Christianity according to the New Testament sources&quot; (translation by Rev. Neil Buchanan; 1895). The following are a few of his many other writings:
* &quot;Die Christologie des Neuen Testaments : ein biblisch-theologischer Versuch&quot;, 1866 – Christology of the New Testament.
* &quot;Godofred, ein Märchen fürs deutsche Haus&quot;, 1890 – Godofred. A fairytale for German households.
* &quot;Das Leben Jesu&quot;, 1887 – The life of Jesus.
* &quot;Bischof D. Reinkens und der deutsche Altkatholizismus&quot;, 1896 – Bishop Joseph Hubert Reinkens and German Old Catholicism.
* &quot;Deutschland im Laufe des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts&quot;, 1900 – Germany during the nineteenth century.

<text>The FP-45 Liberator is a handgun manufactured by the United States military during World War II for use by resistance forces in occupied territories. The &quot;Liberator&quot; was never issued to American or other Allied troops, and there are few documented instances of the weapon being used for its intended purpose; this was compounded by the intended recipientsirregulars and resistance fightersrarely keeping detailed records due to the inherent risks if the records were captured by the enemy. Few FP-45 pistols were distributed as intended, and most were destroyed by Allied forces after the war.

==Project history==
The concept was suggested by a Polish military attaché in March 1942. The project was assigned to the US Army Joint Psychological Warfare Committee and was designed for the United States Army two months later by George Hyde of the Inland Manufacturing Division of the General Motors Corporation in Dayton, Ohio. Production was undertaken by General Motors Guide Lamp Division to avoid conflicting priorities with Inland Division production of the M1 carbine. The army designated the weapon the &quot;Flare Projector Caliber .45&quot; hence the designation FP-45. This was done to disguise the fact that a pistol was being mass-produced. The original engineering drawings labeled the barrel as &quot;tube&quot;, the trigger as &quot;yoke&quot;, the firing pin as &quot;control rod&quot;, and the trigger guard as &quot;spanner&quot;. The Guide Lamp Division plant in Anderson, Indiana assembled a million of these guns. The &quot;Liberator&quot; project took about six months from conception to the end of production with about 11 weeks of actual manufacturing time, done by 300 workers.

==Design==

The FP-45 was a crude, single-shot pistol designed to be cheaply and quickly mass-produced. It had just 23 largely stamped and turned steel parts that were cheap and easy to manufacture. It fired the .45 ACP pistol cartridge from an unrifled barrel. Due to this limitation, it was intended for short-range use, . Its maximum effective range was only about . At longer range, the bullet would begin to tumble and stray off course. The original delivered cost for the FP-45 was USD$2.10/unit (), lending it the nickname &quot;Woolworth pistol&quot;. Five rounds of ammunition could be stored in the pistol grip.

==Wartime use==
The &quot;Liberator&quot; was shipped in a cardboard box with 10 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition, a wooden dowel to remove the empty cartridge case, and an instruction sheet in comic strip form showing how to load and fire the weapon. The &quot;Liberator&quot; was a crude and clumsy weapon, never intended for front-line service. It was originally intended as an insurgency weapon to be mass-dropped behind enemy lines to resistance fighters in occupied territory. A resistance fighter was to recover the gun, sneak up on an Axis occupier, kill or incapacitate him, and retrieve his weapons.

It was manufactured under the &quot;FP&quot; prefix and referred to in official documentation as a &quot;Flare pistol&quot;. The pistol was valued as much for its psychological warfare effect as its actual field performance. It was believed that if vast quantities of these handguns could be delivered into Axis-occupied territory, it would have a devastating effect on the morale of occupying troops. The plan was to drop them in such great quantities that occupying forces could never capture or recover all of them. It was hoped that the thought of thousands of these unrecovered weapons potentially in the hands of the citizens of occupied countries would have a deleterious effect on enemy morale.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s staff never saw the practicality in mass dropping the &quot;Liberator&quot; over occupied Europe, and authorized distribution of fewer than 25,000 of the half million FP-45 pistols shipped to Great Britain for the French resistance. Generals Joseph Stilwell and Douglas MacArthur were similarly unenthusiastic about the other half of the pistols scheduled for shipment to the Pacific. The Army then turned 450,000 &quot;Liberators&quot; over to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which preferred to supply Resistance fighters in both theatres with more effective weapons whenever possible.

French use of the FP-45 remains undocumented, however, a first-hand account of an assassination with an FP-45 exists from German military policeman Niklaus Lange. He claimed that there were thousands in circulation in occupied France. The OSS did distribute a few to Greek resistance forces in 1944. Most of the pistols shipped to Britain were undistributed, and later dumped at sea or melted for scrap metal.

One hundred thousand FP-45 pistols were shipped to China in 1943, but the number actually distributed remains unknown. A few were distributed to the Philippine Commonwealth Army, Philippine Constabulary, and resistance fighters.

<text>The Tupolev ANT-20 &quot;Maxim Gorky&quot; (, sometimes romanized as &quot;Maksim Gorki&quot;) was a Soviet eight-engine aircraft, the largest in the world during the 1930s. Its wingspan was similar to that of a modern Boeing 747, and was not exceeded until the wingspan Douglas XB-19 heavy bomber prototype first flew in 1941.

== Overview ==
The ANT-20 was designed by Andrei Tupolev, using German engineer Hugo Junkers&#x27; original all-metal aircraft design techniques from 1918. It was constructed between 4 July 1933 and 3 April 1934, and was one of two aircraft of its kind built by the Soviets. The aircraft was named after Maxim Gorky and dedicated to the 40th anniversary of his literary and public activities. The ANT-20 was the largest known aircraft to have used the Junkers aviation firm&#x27;s design philosophy of corrugated sheet metal for many of the airframe&#x27;s key components, especially the corrugated sheet metal skinning of the airframe.

The Maxim Gorky was meant as the flagship of the Maxim Gorky propaganda squadron — Maxim Gorky Agiteskadril — which flew around the Soviet Union promoting the aims and achievements of Soviet Communism. For this purpose, it was equipped with a powerful radio set known as the &quot;Voice from the sky&quot; (), printing machinery, a library, radio broadcasting equipment, a photographic laboratory and a film projector with sound for showing films in flight. In a first in aviation the aircraft was equipped with a ladder which would fold on itself to become part of the floor.

The aircraft was the first to use both direct current and alternating current. The aircraft could be dismantled and transported by rail if needed. The aircraft set several carrying-capacity world records and is also the subject of a 1934 painting by Vasily Kuptsov, which is now in the collection of the Russian Museum at Saint Petersburg.

== 1935 Maxim Gorky crash ==

On 18 May 1935, the Maxim Gorky (with pilots I. V. Mikheyev and I. S. Zhurov) and three more aircraft (a Tupolev ANT-14, R-5 and I-5) took off for a demonstration flight over Moscow. The main purpose of the other three aircraft flying so close was to make evident the difference in size. The accompanying I-5 biplane piloted by Nikolai Blagin had performed two loop manoeuvres around the Maxim Gorky. On the third loop, they collided. The Maxim Gorky crashed into a low-rise residential neighbourhood west of present-day Sokol metro station. Forty-five people were killed in the crash, including the fighter pilot as well as both crew members and the 33 passengers on the Maxim Gorky, and an additional nine people on the ground.

== ANT-20bis ==

A replacement aircraft, the ANT-20bis (also designated PS-124 or &quot;Passazhirsky Samolyot&quot; 124, so named as it was built at Plant No. 124), had begun production the following year and first flew in 1938 (other sources mention 15 May 1939 as the date of the first flight). It was largely identical in design but with six more-powerful Mikulin AM-34FRNV engines. On 12 August 1939 it was sold to Aeroflot and served their transport routes in Russia and Uzbekistan. In December 1940, the aircraft was re-engined with two slightly more powerful Mikulin AM-35 engines in the inner positions (numbers three and four). On 14 December 1942, it crashed after the pilot allowed a passenger to take his seat momentarily and the passenger activated the stabilizer control mechanism via a switch on the pilot&#x27;s armrest, raising the stabilizer and sending the airplane into a nosedive from an altitude of , killing all 36 on board.

<doc id="1158786" wikidata="Q5572897" url="?curid=1158786" title="Glyn Valley Tramway">
<text>The Glyn Valley Tramway was a narrow-gauge railway that ran through the Ceiriog Valley in north-east Wales, connecting Chirk with Glyn Ceiriog in Denbighshire (now Wrexham County Borough). The gauge of the line was while it was horse-drawn, which was unofficially increased to when steam locomotives were introduced. The total length of the line was , of which were worked by passenger trains, the remainder serving a large granite quarry and several minor slate quarries.

== History ==
===Construction===

The railway was built to connect the quarries at Glyn Ceriog with the Shropshire Union Canal at Chirk. A standard gauge &quot;Ellesmere &amp; Glyn Valley Railway&quot; was authorised by the &#x27; (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. cccxxxv) of 6 August to run from the Cambrian Railway at Ellesmere to the GWR at Chirk and thence to follow the Glyn Ceiriog road to the quarries. No construction took place and by the &#x27; (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. cli), the Ellesmere to Chirk portion was abandoned. A further act of Parliament, the (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. clxvi), obtained on 10 August 1870, allowed the original company to be dissolved, and the Glyn Valley Tramway to be incorporated to take over the rights, assets and goodwill of the previous company. The company believed it could not raise the £120,000 capital required to build the standard gauge line. Henry Dennis suggested a narrow gauge line instead, which would only require £25,000. The line would run from the canal at Chirk Bank to the Cambrian Slate Quarries. This initial line, at long, was opened in 1873, and was worked by horse and gravity traction carrying passengers and freight.

The 1874 timetable shows three passenger journeys each way per day, originating at &quot;New Inn, Glyn&quot; at 8am, reaching &quot;Pontvaen (Chirk)&quot; at 8.45. The return journey took an hour. The terminus at Pontfaen was on the South side of the bridge as an account of an accident in December 1874 stated that &quot;near the Chirk terminus there is a sharp curve, almost at a right angle, to cross the River Ceriog by a wooden bridge&quot;. The tram reached this curve at too great a speed and the trucks were shot over the side throwing some of the passengers down the steep rocky bank into the river, fortunately without any fatalities.

=== Expansion ===

In 1885, additional parliamentary powers were obtained in the (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. cxl) to abandon the &quot;Quinta Tramway&quot; section between Pontfaen and Chirk Bank, replacing it with a new line from Pontfaen to the Great Western Railway&#x27;s Chirk station. Under the 1885 act access to canal wharfage was obtained by extending the tramway further North from Chirk Station to the redundant Black Park Collieries Dock Basin. A two-mile extension was also authorized from Glyn to the quarries around Pandy. While the modified route was opened for mineral traffic promptly, there was a substantial delay in opening for passenger traffic arising from a dispute about the erection of a fence between the railway and the road on the new section into Chirk. The tramway eventually re-opened for passengers on Monday 16 March 1891.

The re-opened passenger service had three intermediate stations, Castle Mill, Pontfadoc and Dolywern, with no provision for stopping between stations. The journey time was 50 minutes, with 5 up trains from Chirk and 4 return trains. There was a new 12 person passenger carriage at the opening made by the Midland Carriage Co. of Shrewsbury and there was no distinction between classes of seating. Tickets were bought from the van at the rear of the train, obviating the need for booking clerks and station masters. The locomotives used on this service were &quot;Sir Theodore&quot; and &quot;Dennis&quot;. The 1905 timetable shows Pontfaen introduced as a request stop, and journey times reduced to 40 minutes. There were 4 trains each way with extra trains on Wednesday and Saturday.

=== Quarries ===

===Decline and closure===
After the First World War costs started to rise significantly, while revenues did not. The railway&#x27;s financial situation declined steadily during the 1920s. The railway needed to carry approximately 45,000 tons of traffic per year to break even. In 1929 it carried 64,857 tons, but by 1932 this had dropped to 21,400 tons. Increased use of road haulage and a change in the ownership of the remaining quarries was the cause of this downturn in traffic.

In 1932, a bus service was started in the valley, for the first time offering passengers a serious competition to travelling on the tramway. Passenger receipts declined steeply that year, and passenger services were abandoned at the beginning of 1933. Freight traffic continued to decline and the losses to mount on the railway and all services ceased in July 1935 as the company went into voluntary liquidation. In 1936 the track was removed and all the locomotives were scrapped.

== Locomotives ==
At the time of the expansion, Henry Dennis was a director and also the tramway&#x27;s Engineer. He was also the Engineer for the Snailbeach District Railways, near Shrewsbury. When rebuilding of the line began in 1887, Dennis offered to loan the two steam locomotives from Snailbeach, as the carriage of lead ore on that railway had plummeted. They were of the slightly narrower gauge of , and the difference meant that they derailed very easily. The Act of Parliament did not allow the gauge to be changed as part of the rebuilding, but in practice, it was increased to . Davies suggests that the two locomotives, &quot;Belmont&quot; and &quot;Fernhill&quot;, normally worked on relatively straight track, but the Glyn Valley Tramway followed the course of the road, with numerous sharp bends, where the wheel flanges may have distorted the track, opening out the gauge, and this is the most likely reason for the change of gauge.

The new line was opened for freight traffic in 1888 and to passengers in 1891. Two locomotives, &quot;Sir Theodore&quot; and &quot;Dennis&quot; were in use when passenger services resumed, and were joined by a third Beyer Peacock tram locomotive &quot;Glyn&quot; in 1892. In 1921, an ex-War Department Light Railways Baldwin Class 10-12-D was purchased; it was regauged by Beyer Peacock from its original gauge.

When the line closed in 1936, no buyers were found for the locomotives (the unusual gauge may have been a factor), and so they were all scrapped on site.

== Preservation ==

Most of the railway&#x27;s stock and track were scrapped in the 1930s. However, some carriage bodies were sold to local farmers. Two of these bodies survived long enough to be rescued by the Talyllyn Railway where they have been restored to working order and are now used in regular traffic. A quantity of Glyn Valley track also found its way to the Talyllyn.

The waiting rooms in Pontfadog and Dolywern survive in their original locations. In 1950 the council officer used Pontfadog waiting room to collect rates and the locals nicknamed it ‘Pontfadog Town Hall’. It was later bought by the public house and it was also used as a craft shop.

=== Glyn Valley Tramway Trust ===
In October 2007, the Glyn Valley Tramway Trust was formed with the aim of restoring part of the tramway. They plan to recreate its appearance in the 1920s era and provide a visitor centre and workshops with educational facilities to display and interpret the history and development of the Tramway through artefacts and audio-visual media. The Glyn Valley Tramway Trust are to carry out a Design and Evaluation study of the entire route from Chirk to Glyn Ceiriog and beyond, and as a first phase intends to re-instate a section as an operational steam heritage railway from the original Chirk GVT station to Baddy&#x27;s Wood near Pontfaen.

In 2019, the Glyn Valley Tramway Trust started to clear trees and spoil from the station site at Chirk, adjacent to the Network Rail station. In August 2022, the platform and trackbed had been cleared. The Trust intends to rebuild the platform, and lay track in the station area.

On 31 October 2022, the trust announced that they intend to rebuild the section of the tramway between Chirk and Pontfaen to a gauge of —matching the Talyllyn Railway and Corris Railway—rather than the original Glyn Valley gauge of . The first section of track was laid at Chirk station in December 2022.

<text>Antisense RNA (asRNA), also referred to as antisense transcript, natural antisense transcript (NAT) or antisense oligonucleotide, is a single stranded RNA that is complementary to a protein coding messenger RNA (mRNA) with which it hybridizes, and thereby blocks its translation into protein. The asRNAs (which occur naturally) have been found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and can be classified into short (&lt;200 nucleotides) and long (&gt;200 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The primary function of asRNA is regulating gene expression. asRNAs may also be produced synthetically and have found wide spread use as research tools for gene knockdown. They may also have therapeutic applications.

== Discovery and history in drug development ==

Some of the earliest asRNAs were discovered while investigating functional proteins. An example was micF asRNA. While characterizing the outer membrane porin in &quot;E.coli&quot;, some of the promoter clones observed were capable of repressing the expression of other membrane porin such as . The region responsible for this repression function was found to be a 300 base-pair locus upstream of the promoter. This 300 base-pair region is 70% homologous in sequence with the 5&#x27; end of the mRNA and thus the transcript of this 300 base pair locus was complementary to the mRNA. Later on, this transcript, denoted micF, was found to be an asRNA of and capable of downregulating the expression of under stress by forming a duplex with the mRNA. This induces the degradation of the mRNA.

Unlike micF RNA being discovered by accident, the majority of asRNAs were discovered by genome wide searches for small regulatory RNAs and by transcriptome analysis. Conventionally, the first step involves computational predictions based on some known characteristics of asRNAs. During computational searches, the encoding regions are excluded. The regions that are predicted to have conserved RNA structures and act as orphan promoters and Rho independent terminators are preferenced during analysis. Because computational searches focuses on the intergenic region, the asRNAs that are transcribed from the opposite strand of an encoding gene are likely to be missed using this method. To detect asRNA transcribed from the encoding region, oligonucleotide microarrays can be used. In this method, one or both strands of encoding genes can be used as probes. In addition to computational searches and microarrays, some asRNAs were discovered by sequencing cDNA clones as well as mapping promoter elements. Although many findings from the approaches mentioned above gave rise to a lot of possible asRNAs, only few were proven to be actual asRNAs via further functional tests. To minimize the number of false positive results, new approaches from recent years have been focusing on strand-specific transcription, chromatin binding noncoding RNAs and single cell studies.

The idea of asRNAs as drug targets started in 1978 when Zamecnik and Stephenson found an antisense oligonucleotide to the viral RNA of Rous scarcoma virus that was capable of inhibiting viral replication and protein synthesis. Since then, much effort has been devoted to developing asRNAs as drug candidates. In 1998, the first asRNA drug, fomivirsen, was approved by FDA. Fomivirsen, a 21 base-pair oligonucleotide, was developed to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS. It works by targeting the transcribed mRNA of the virus and consequently inhibiting replication of cytomegalovirus. Despite fomivirsen being discontinued in 2004 due to the loss of the market, it served as a successful and inspiring example of using asRNAs as drug targets or drug candidates.

Another example of using an asRNA as a therapeutic agent is mipomersen, which was approved by FDA in 2013. Mipomersen was developed to manage the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), which is a rare autosomal dominant genetic condition. Because of the high level of total cholesterol (650–1000 mg/dL) and LDL receptor (above 600 mg/dL) in HoFH, patients with HoFH has a high risk for coronary heart disease. Because the protein apo-B-100 has been found to be required to produce very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL, mipomersen complements with the mRNA of apo-B-100 and target it for RNAse H dependent degradation. Ultimately, mipomersen is able to reduce the level of LDL.

== Examples across species ==
The initial asRNAs discovered were in prokaryotes including plasmids, bacteriophage and bacteria. For example, in plasmid ColE1, the asRNA termed RNA I plays an important role in determining the plasmid copy number by controlling replication. The replication of ColE1 relies on the transcription of a primer RNA named RNA II. Once RNA II is transcribed, it hybridizes to its DNA template and later cleaved by RNase H. In the presence of the asRNA RNA I, RNA I and RNA II forms a duplex which introduces a conformational change of RNA II. Consequently, RNA II cannot hybridize with its DNA template which results in a low copy number of ColE1. In bacteriophage P22, the asRNA sar helps regulate between lytic and lysogenic cycle by control the expression of Ant. Besides being expressed in prokaryotes, asRNAs were also discovered in plants. The most well described example of asRNA regulation in plants is on Flowering Locus C (FLC) gene. FLC gene in Arabidopsis thaliana encodes for a transcription factor that prevent expression of a range of genes that induce floral transition. In cold environment, the asRNA of FLC gene, denoted COOLAIR, is expressed and inhibits the expression of FLC via chromatin modification which consequently allows for flowering. Another well studied example is DOG1 (Delay of Germination 1) gene. Its expression level is negatively regulated by the antisense transcript (asDOG1 or 1GOD) acting in cis. In mammalian cells, a typical example of asRNA regulation is X chromosome inactivation. Xist, an asRNA, can recruit polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which results in heterochromatinization of the X chromosome.

== Classification ==
Antisense RNAs can be classified in different ways. In terms of regulatory mechanisms, some authors group asRNAs into RNA-DNA interactions, RNA-RNA interactions either in nucleus or cytoplasm and RNA-protein interactions (epigenetic). Antisense RNAs can be categorized by the type of the promoters that initiate expression of asRNAs: independent promoters, shared bidirectional promoters or cryptic promoters. In terms of length, although asRNA in general is classified as lncRNAs, there are short asRNAs with length of less than 200 base pairs. Because the regulatory mechanism of asRNAs are found to be species specific, asRNAs can also be classified by species. One of the common ways of classifying asRNAs is by where the asRNAs are transcribe relatively to their target genes: cis-acting and trans-acting.

=== Cis-acting ===

Cis-acting asRNAs are transcribed from the opposite strand of the target gene at the target gene locus. They often show high degree or complete complementarity with the target gene. If the cis-acting asRNA regulates gene expression by targeting mRNA, it can only target individual mRNA. Upon interactions with the targeting mRNAs, cis-acting asRNAs can either block ribosome binding or recruit RNAase to degrade the targeting mRNAs. Consequently, the function of these cis-acting asRNAs is to repress translation of the targeting mRNAs. Besides cis-acting asRNAs that target mRNAs, there are cis-acting epigenetic silencers and activators. Antisense RNA has been shown to repress the translation of LINE1-ORF2 domain of Entamoeba histolytica. However it is not confirmed yet whether its cis-acting or trans.

In terms of epigenetic modification, cis-acting refers to the nature of these asRNAs that regulate epigenetic changes around the loci where they are transcribed. Instead of targeting individual mRNAs, these cis-acting epigenetic regulators can recruit chromatin modifying enzymes which can exert effects on both the transcription loci and the neighboring genes.

=== Trans-acting ===
Trans-acting asRNAs are transcribed from loci that are distal from the targeting genes. In contrast to cis-acting asRNAs, they display low degree of complementarity with the target gene but can be longer than cis-acting asRNAs. They can also target multiple loci. Because of these properties of trans-acting asRNAs, they form less stable complexes with their targeting transcripts and sometimes require aids from RNA chaperone protein such as Hfq to exert their functions. Due to the complexity of the trans-acting asRNAs, they are currently considered to be less druggable targets.

=== Function ===
==== Epigenetic regulation ====
Many examples of asRNAs show the inhibitory effect on transcription initiation via epigenetic modifications.

===== DNA methylation =====
DNA methylation can result in long term downregulation of specific genes. Repression of functional proteins via asRNA induced DNA methylation has been found in several human disease. In a class of alpha-thalassemia, a type of blood disorder that has reduced level of hemoglobin leading to insufficient oxygen in the tissues, hemoglobin alpha1 gene (HBA1) is downregulated by an abnormal transcript of putative RNA-binding protein Luc7-like (LUC71) that serves as an asRNA to HBA1 and induces methylation of HBA1&#x27;s promoter. Another example is silencing of a tumor suppressor gene p15INK4b, also called CDKN2B, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. The asRNA that is responsible for this silencing effect is antisense non-coding RNA in the INK locus (ANRIL), which is expressed in the same locus that encodes for p15INK4b.

===== Histone modification =====

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is tightly packed by histones. Modification on histones can change interactions with DNA which can further induce changes in gene expression. The biological consequences of histone methylation are context dependent. In general, histone methylation leads to gene repression but gene activation can also be achieved. Evidence has shown histone methylation can be induced by asRNAs. For instance, ANRIL, in addition to the ability to induce DNA methylation, can also repress the neighboring gene of CDKN2B, CDKN2A, by recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which leads to histone methylation (H3K27me). Another classic example is X chromosome inactivation by XIST.

ANRIL induced epigenetic modification is an example of cis acting epigenetic regulation. In addition, Antisense RNA-induced chromatin modification can be both trans-acting. For example, in mammals, the asRNA HOTAIR is transcribed from homeobox C (HOXC) locus but it recruits PRC2 to HOXD which deposits H3K27 and silences HOXD. HOTAIR is highly expressed in primary breast tumors.

==== Co-transcriptional regulation ====
Epigenetic regulations such as DNA methylation and histone methylation can repress gene expression by inhibiting initiation of transcription. Sometimes, however, gene repression can be achieved by prematurely terminating or slowing down transcription process. AsRNAs can be involved in this level of gene regulation. For example, in bacterial or eukaryotic cells where complex RNA polymerases are present, bidirectional transcription at the same locus can lead to polymerase collision and results in the termination of transcription. Even when polymerase collision is unlikely during weak transcription, polymerase pausing can also occur which blocks elongation and leads to gene repression. One of the examples is repression of IME4 gene by its asRNA RME2. Another way of affecting transcription co-transcriptionally is by blocking splicing. One classic example in human is zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 2 gene (ZEB2) which encodes E-cadherin, a transcriptional repressor. Efficient translation of ZEB2 mRNA requires the presence of an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in intron of the mRNA at the 5&#x27; end. With the asRNA of ZEB2 being expressed, it can mask the splicing site and maintain the IRES in the mRNA which results in an efficient synthesis of E-cadherin. Lastly, depending on the level of asRNA expression, different isoforms of the sense transcript can be produced. Therefore, asRNA dependent regulation is not limited to on/off mechanism; rather, it presents a fine tone control system.

==== Post-transcriptional regulation ====
The direct post transcriptional modulation by asRNAs refers to mRNAs being targeted by asRNAs directly; thus, the translation is affected. Some characteristics of this type of asRNAs are described in the cis- and trans- acting asRNAs. This mechanism is relatively fast because both the targeting mRNA and its asRNA need to be present simultaneously in the same cell. As described in the cis-acting asRNAs, the mRNA-asRNA pairing can result in blockage of ribosome entry and RNase H dependent degradation. Overall, mRNA-targeting asRNAs can either activate or inhibit translation of the sense mRNAs with inhibitory effect being the most abundant.

=== Therapeutic potential ===
As a regulatory element, asRNAs bear many advantages to be considered as a drug target. First of all, asRNAs regulate gene expression at multiple levels including transcription, post-transcription and epigenetic modification. Secondly, the cis-acting asRNAs are sequence specific and exhibits high degree of complementarity with the targeting genes. Thirdly, the expression level of asRNAs is very small compared to that of the targeting mRNAs; therefore, only small amount of asRNAs is required to produce an effect. In terms of drug targets, this represents a huge advantage because only a low dosage is required for effectiveness.

Recent years the idea of targeting asRNAs to increase gene expression in a locus specific manner has been drawing much attention. Due to the nature of drug development, it is always easier to have drugs functioning as downregulators or inhibitors. However, there is a need in developing drugs that can activate or upregulate gene expression such as tumor suppressor genes, neuroprotective growth factors and genes that are found silenced in certain Mendelian disorders. Currently, the approach to restore deficient gene expression or protein function include enzyme replacement therapies, microRNA therapies and delivery of functional cDNA. However, each bears some drawbacks. For example, the synthesized protein used in the enzyme replacement therapies often cannot mimic the whole function of the endogenous protein. In addition, enzyme replacement therapies are life-long commitment and carry a large financial burden for the patient. Because of the locus specific nature of asRNAs and evidences of changes in asRNA expression in many diseases, there have been attempts to design single stranded oligonucleotides, referred as antagoNATs, to inhibit asRNAs and ultimately to increase specific gene expression.

Despite the promises of asRNAs as drug targets or drug candidates, there are some challenges remained to be addressed. First of all, asRNAs and antagoNATs can be easily degraded by RNase or other degrading enzymes. To prevent degradation of the therapeutic oliogoneucleotides, chemical modification is usually required. The most common chemical modification on the oligonucleotides is adding a phosphorothioate linkage to the backbones. However, the phosphrothioate modification can be proinflammatory. Adverse effects including fever, chills or nausea have been observed after local injection of phosphrothioate modified oligonucleotides. Secondly, off target toxicity also represents a big problem. Despite the locus-specific nature of the endogenous asRNAs, only 10–50% synthesized oligonucleotides showed expected targeting effect. One possible reason for this problem is the high requirement on the structure of the asRNAs to be recognized by the target sequence and RNase H. A single mismatch can result in distortion in the secondary structure and lead to off target effects. Lastly, artificial asRNAs have been shown to have limited intracellular uptake. Although neurons and glia have been shown to have the ability to freely uptake naked antisense oligonucleotides, a traceable carriers such as virus and lipid vesicles would still be ideal to control and monitor the intracellular concentration and metabolism.

<doc id="1158795" wikidata="Q4791371" url="?curid=1158795" title="2004 Arizona Proposition 200">
<text>Proposition 200, the &quot;Arizona Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act&quot;, was an Arizona state initiative passed in 2004 that basically requires: (a) persons to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote; (b) voters to present a photo identification before receiving a ballot at the polling place; and (c) state and local agencies to verify the identity and eligibility, based on immigration status, of applicants for non-federally mandated public benefits. The proposition also makes it a misdemeanor for public officials to fail to report violations of U.S. immigration law by applicants for those public benefits and permits private lawsuits by any resident to enforce its provisions related to public benefits. The requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote was later ruled invalid in federal court.

Authors of the ballot measure, the &quot;Protect Arizona Now&quot; committee, claimed that the provision of state identification and public benefits to individuals without adequately verifying their immigration status gave rise to opportunities for voter fraud and imposed economic hardship on the state.

Opponents of the ballot measure asserted that it was anti-immigrant and reminiscent of California&#x27;s 1994 Proposition 187, as well as disputed the existence of voter fraud and argued that immigrants were important contributors to the state&#x27;s economy.

==Proponents==
Two separate, rival groups supported Proposition 200. The first group was the proposition&#x27;s sponsor, the Protect Arizona Now (PAN) committee, led by Kathy McKee and supported at the national level by the Carrying Capacity Network (CCN) and Population-Environment Balance (PEB). The second group was the Yes on 200 committee, led by Rusty Childress, a Phoenix-area car dealer, and supported at the national level by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). There was a split within PAN, which McKee described as an &quot;attempted hijacking of a local effort by greedy, out-of-state interests&quot;; this split highlighted an ongoing feud within the immigration reduction movement between FAIR and the other two groups dating back to at least 2003, with CCN and PEB issuing frequent statements accusing FAIR (as well as NumbersUSA) of being &quot;reform lite&quot; and &quot;undermining real immigration reform.&quot;

PAN was formed by McKee and Childress, who became its chair and treasurer, respectively. The PAN National Advisory Board was chaired by Dr. Virginia Abernethy, and included Dr. David Pimentel and Marvin Gregory. Childress later joined a separate effort, Yes On 200, organized by FAIR.

During the signature gathering campaign, McKee accused Childress of withholding funds and petitions from PAN and fired him. Childress sued McKee over custody of PAN&#x27;s signatures and funds, but the court ruled in favor of McKee. Childress and the two most prominent supporters of the initiative within the Arizona state legislature, Russell Pearce and Randy Graf, then formed a separate organization, Yes On 200, which was funded almost entirely by out-of-state interests.

When FAIR began an independent signature gathering campaign to collect the remaining signatures needed to put the initiative on the ballot, McKee accused FAIR of attempting a hostile takeover of PAN. When McKee named Abernethy, an avowed &quot;ethnic separatist,&quot; as the chair of PAN&#x27;s national advisory board, FAIR responded by issuing a press release calling for both McKee and Abernethy to resign from PAN and saying that Abernethy&#x27;s views were &quot;repugnant, divisive and do not represent the views of the vast majority of Arizonans who support Proposition 200.&quot; Abernethy&#x27;s appointment drew harsh criticism from an anti-bigotry group based in Chicago, which noted her &quot;leadership roles in other extremist organizations,&quot; such as The Occidental Quarterly and the Council of Conservative Citizens.

==Campaign==
On July 5, 2004, Protect Arizona NOW&#x27;s Chairman, Kathy McKee, pursuant to Arizona law, submitted 190,887 signatures to the Arizona Secretary of State&#x27;s office, surprising critics, who had believed organizers would not be able to garner enough signatures before the deadline. A counter-organization, the Statue of Liberty Coalition, was formed to block Proposition 200, claiming the initiative was racist and would violate Latino civil rights. Opposition to Proposition 200 was bipartisan, including Senator John McCain (R), Senator Jon Kyl (R), Governor Janet Napolitano (D), the Arizona Republican Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the AFL-CIO. Tamar Jacoby, a writer on immigration-related issues in articles for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

Supporters partly relied for justification on a 2004 FAIR study that estimated that Arizona taxpayers were annually paying $1 billion to cover the education, uncompensated health care, and incarceration costs of illegal immigration, net of the taxes paid by the illegal immigrants. This study appeared to contradict a 2003 study performed by a team at the Thunderbird School of Global Management and sponsored by Wells Fargo and the Consul General of Mexico in Phoenix, which estimated that immigrants were annually contributing $318 million more in income and sales taxes than they were costing the state in services and uncompensated health care. However, it was not clear whether that estimate was based on all immigrants or only illegal immigrants.

In November 2004, the electorate passed Proposition 200, with 56% of voters voting in the affirmative. Exit polls found that 47% of Latino voters voted in favor of the initiative.

==Implementation==

A substantial legal battle erupted over the precise definition of &quot;public benefits.&quot; Arizona&#x27;s Attorney General ruled that the law pertains to only discretionary state programs. Federally funded entitlements like food stamps and subsidized school lunches are examples of public benefits to which, given the Attorney General&#x27;s finding, the new law would not apply. PAN interpreted the proposition to apply the welfare portion of the initiative to the nearly 60 programs contained in Arizona Revised Statutes Title 46, &quot;Welfare.&quot;

Despite withstanding three pre-election and two post-election lawsuits, at least one lawsuit related to Proposition 200 is still pending. &quot;Yes on 200&quot; filed a post-election lawsuit, initially dismissed in the lower court but currently on appeal, saying that the Attorney General overstepped his bounds when he narrowed the definition of &quot;public benefits.&quot;

On December 23, 2004, the federal appeals court in Tucson removed an earlier restraining order that had kept the state from implementing the law. The entire law, with one exception, is in effect, using the definition of &quot;public benefits&quot; promulgated by the Governor and Attorney General. State, county, and city workers may be fined up to $700 for each instance in which they provide such benefits to persons who cannot produce evidence of citizenship.

Kathy McKee has since started a new group, Protect America NOW, to support similar initiatives in other states.

==Voter registration and identification at the polls==
Proposition 200 required, among other things, proof of citizenship to register to vote and voter identification at the polling place. No major elections took place after its adoption before November 7, 2006, and the actual implementation of these two provisions of the proposition remained unclear. Opponents challenged the constitutionality of these requirements upon voters, arguing that such a law could be used to discriminate against ethnic groups, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment.

On October 5, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit temporarily suspended these requirements, a little over a month before the election. However, the ruling was stayed fifteen days later by the U.S. Supreme Court.

In October 2010, the Ninth Circuit held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as preempted by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid. However, in April 2011, the court granted Arizona&#x27;s petition for &quot;en banc&quot; review of this ruling, and it heard oral arguments on June 21, 2011.

In April 2012, the &quot;en banc&quot; court also held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as preempted by the NVRA and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to stay the ruling on June 28, 2012.

In July 2012, Arizona submitted to the Supreme Court a petition for writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s ruling that the state&#x27;s proof of citizenship requirement is preempted by the NVRA. The Court granted the petition in October 2012, and it heard oral arguments on March 18, 2013. On June 17, 2013, the Supreme Court affirmed, in a 7–2 vote with Justice Antonin Scalia delivering the Court&#x27;s opinion, the Ninth Circuit&#x27;s ruling that Arizona&#x27;s proof of citizenship requirement is preempted by the NVRA.

<doc id="1158798" wikidata="Q7463501" url="?curid=1158798" title="Lower Paleolithic">
<text>The Lower Paleolithic (or Lower Palaeolithic) is the earliest subdivision of the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. It spans the time from around 3.3 million years ago when the first evidence for stone tool production and use by hominins appears in the current archaeological record, until around 300,000 years ago, spanning the Oldowan (&quot;mode 1&quot;) and Acheulean (&quot;mode 2&quot;) lithics industries.

In African archaeology, the time period roughly corresponds to the Early Stone Age, the earliest finds dating back to 3.3 million years ago, with Lomekwian stone tool technology, spanning Mode 1 stone tool technology, which begins roughly 2.6 million years ago and ends between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago, with Mode 2 technology.

The Middle Paleolithic followed the Lower Paleolithic and recorded the appearance of the more advanced prepared-core tool-making technologies such as the Mousterian. Whether the earliest control of fire by hominins dates to the Lower or to the Middle Paleolithic remains an open question.

==Gelasian==
The Lower Paleolithic began with the appearance of the first stone tools in the world. Formerly associated with the emergence of &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, some 2.8 million years ago, this date has been pushed back significantly by finds of the early 2000s, the Oldowan or Mode 1 horizon, long considered the oldest type of lithic industry, is now considered to have developed from about 2.6 million years ago, with the beginning Gelasian (Lower Pleistocene), possibly first used by australopithecine forebears of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; (such as &quot;Australopithecus garhi&quot;).

However, even older tools were later discovered at the single site of Lomekwi 3 in Kenya, in 2015, dated to as early as 3.3 million years ago. As such, they would predate the Pleistocene (the Gelasian), and fall into the late Pliocene (the Piacenzian).

The early members of the genus &quot;Homo&quot; produced primitive tools, summarized under the Oldowan industry, which remained dominant for nearly a million years, from about 2.5 to 1.7 million years ago. &quot;Homo habilis&quot; is assumed to have lived primarily on scavenging, using tools to cleave meat off carrion or to break bones to extract the marrow.

The move from the mostly frugivorous or omnivorous diet of hominin &quot;Australopithecus&quot; to the carnivorous scavenging lifestyle of early &quot;Homo&quot; has been explained by the climate changes in East Africa associated with the Quaternary glaciation. Decreasing oceanic evaporation produced a drier climate and the expansion of the savannah at the expense of forests. Reduced availability of fruits stimulated some proto-australopithecines to search out new food sources found in the drier savannah ecology. Derek Bickerton (2009) has designated to this period the move from simple animal communication systems found in all great apes to the earliest form of symbolic communication systems capable of displacement (referring to items not currently within sensory perception) and motivated by the need to &quot;recruit&quot; group members for scavenging large carcasses.

&quot;Homo erectus&quot; appeared by about 1.8 million years ago, via the transitional variety &quot;Homo ergaster&quot;.

== Calabrian ==
&quot;Homo erectus&quot; moved from scavenging to hunting, developing the hunting-gathering lifestyle that would remain dominant throughout the Paleolithic into the Mesolithic.
The unlocking of the new niche of hunting-gathering subsistence drove a number of further behavioral and physiological changes leading to the appearance of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; by some 800,000-600,000 years ago. As such, &quot;Homo&quot; rose to the ranks of omnivorous predators (and possibly became hypercarnivores before &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; again transformed into hypocarnivores). As active hunters, they came in opposition to other, quadruped predators and started living in large groups.

&quot;Homo erectus&quot; migrated out of Africa and dispersed throughout Eurasia. Stone tools in Malaysia have been dated to be 1.83 million years old. The Peking Man fossil, discovered in 1929, is roughly 700,000 years old.

In Europe, the Olduwan tradition (known in Europe as Abbevillian) split into two parallel traditions, the Clactonian, a flake tradition, and the Acheulean, a hand-axe tradition. The Levallois technique for knapping flint developed during this time.

The carrier species from Africa to Europe was undoubtedly &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. This type of human is more clearly linked to the flake tradition, which spread across southern Europe through the Balkans to appear relatively densely in southeast Asia. Many Mousterian finds in the Middle Paleolithic have been knapped using a Levallois technique, suggesting that Neanderthals evolved from &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (or, perhaps, &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;; see below).

Monte Poggiolo, near Forlì, Italy, is the location of an Acheulian littoral handaxe industry dating from 1.8 to 1.1 million years ago.

The advent of technology and both verbal and non-verbal communication due to transition to group hunting and gathering resulted in the expansion of the parts of the brain associated with these, as well as greater cognition due to it being interlinked with the two. Later, behavioral adaptations to further social life, uncertain food distribution (resulting in need to find and secure food and remember where it could be found) and ecological changes brought about by &quot;Homo&quot; led to the further expansion of the brain in the areas of problem-solving, memory etc., ultimately leading to the great behavioral flexibility, highly efficient communication, and ecological dominance of humanity. The biological pre-adaptations of the great apes and earlier primates allowed the brain to expand threefold within just 2 to 2.3 million years of the Pleistocene, in response to increasingly complex societies and changing habitats.

==Chibanian==
The appearance of &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; about 600,000 years ago heralds a number of other new varieties, such as &quot;Homo rhodesiensis&quot; and &quot;Homo cepranensis&quot; about 400,000 years ago.
&quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; is a candidate for first developing an early form of symbolic language. Whether control of fire and earliest burials date to this period or only appear during the Middle Paleolithic is an open question.

Also, in Europe, a type of human appeared that was intermediate between &quot;Homo erectus&quot; and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, sometimes summarized under archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, typified by such fossils as those found at Swanscombe, Steinheim, Tautavel, and Vertesszollos (&quot;Homo palaeohungaricus&quot;). The hand-axe tradition originates in the same period. The intermediate may have been &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;, held responsible for the manufacture of improved &quot;Mode 2&quot; Acheulean tool types, in Africa, after 600,000 years ago. Flakes and axes coexisted in Europe, sometimes at the same site. The axe tradition, however, spread to a different range in the east. It appears in Arabia and India, but more importantly, it does not appear in southeast Asia.

==Transition to the Middle Paleolithic==

From about 300,000 years ago, technology, social structures and behaviour appear to grow more complex, with prepared-core technique lithics, earliest instances of burial and changes to hunting-gathering patterns of subsistence. &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; first appeared about 300,000 years ago, as evidenced by fossils found at Jebel Irhoud in Morocco.

==Lower Paleolithic era by region==
;South India
The Madrasian culture is a prehistoric archaeological culture of the Indian subcontinent, dated to the Lower Paleolithic, the earliest subdivision of the Stone Age. It belongs to the Acheulian industry, and some scholars consider the distinction between the Madrasian and the broader, regional Acheulian tradition defunct.

The Madrasian is characterized by bifacial handaxes and cleavers, but also includes flake tools, microliths and other chopping tools. Most were made from quartzite.

The Madrasian was named for its type site of Attirampakkam (then part of the Madras Presidency), and Pallavaram near to the city of Madras (now renamed as Chennai) in the state of Tamilnadu, discovered by British archaeologist and geologist Robert Bruce Foote in 1863. The oldest tools at Attirampakkam have been dated to 1.5 million years ago using cosmic-ray exposure dating.

North India

Guy Ellcock Pilgrim, a British geologist and palaeontologist, discovered 1.5 million-year-old prehistoric human teeth and part of a jaw indicating that ancient people, intelligent hominins dating as far back as 1,500,000 ybp Acheulean period, lived in the Pinjore region near Chandigarh. Quartzite tools of the lower Paleolithic period were excavated in this region extending from Pinjore in Haryana to Nalagarh (Solan district in Himachal Pradesh). The lands of Gujarat has been continuously inhabited from the Lower Paleolithic (c. 200,000 BP) period. Evidence of Stone Age habitation has been discovered in riverbeds of Sabarmati, Mahi River and lower Narmada rivers of Gujarat.

<text>The Thomson EF936x series is a type of Graphic Display Processor (GDP) by Thomson-EFCIS. The chip could draw at 1 million pixels per second, which was relatively advanced for the time of its release (1982 or earlier). There are various versions of the chip with slightly different capabilities.

The first version, EF9364 CRT Processor, was introduced in 1981.

In 1982 Commodore released a &quot;High Resolution Graphics&quot; board for the PET based on the EF9365 and EF9366 chips, allowing it to display or resolution graphics. The EF9366 was also used on the SMP-E353 graphic card for the Siemens computer series and on the NDR-Klein-Computer introduced in 1984.

Version EF9369, introduced in 1984, was used on computers such as the Thomson MO5NR, MO6, TO8, TO9 and TO9+, and from 1985 to 1989 on the DAI Personal Computer.

==Versions==
Based on the 1989 data book published by the company, the EF936x series was split into &quot;Graphics Controllers&quot; and &quot;Color Palette&quot; models:

=== Graphics Controllers ===
*EF9364 CRT Processor introduced in 1981
*EF9365 (interlaced), , , ; 50 Hz
*EF9366 (non-interlaced); 50/60 Hz
*EF9367 (interlaced), (interlaced); 50/60 Hz (capable of SECAM system output for the French market).
*SFF96364

=== Color Palette ===
*EF9369 - 4-bit DACs (16 out of 4096 colors - 12-bit RGB), generating gamma corrected (gamma 2.8) voltages.
*TS9370 - 4-bit DACs (16 out of 4096 colors)

==Capabilities==
*Integrated DRAM controller
*Line drawing, with delta-x and delta-y limited to 255 each. Support for solid, dotted, dashed and dotted/dashed lines.
*Built-in pixel ASCII font. Support for rendering tilted characters, and scaling by integer factors (no antialiasing)
*Clear screen
*Light Pen support

The GPUs did not support direct access to the graphics memory, although a special command was provided to aid in implementing access to individual memory words.

== Character Set ==
The Thomson EF9365/6 used the following character, displayed with a pixel font:

<doc id="1158816" wikidata="Q389933" url="?curid=1158816" title="The Miser">
<text>The Miser (; ) is a five-act comedy in prose by the French playwright Molière. It was first performed on September 9, 1668, in the theatre of the Palais-Royal in Paris.

==The play==
The play was first produced when Molière&#x27;s company was under the protection of Louis XIV. It was loosely based on the Latin comedy &quot;Aulularia&quot; by Plautus, from which many incidents and scraps of dialogue are borrowed, as well as from contemporary Italian farces.

The miser of the title is called Harpagon, a name adapted from the Greek ἁρπάγη pronounced &quot;harpágay&quot;, meaning a hook or grappling iron (ἁρπάγη &lt; ἁρπάζω = grab). He is obsessed with the wealth he has amassed and always ready to save expenses. Now a widower, he has a son, Cléante, and a daughter, Élise. Although he is over sixty, he is attempting to arrange a marriage between himself and an attractive young woman, Mariane. She and Cléante are already devoted to each other, however, and the son attempts to procure a loan to help her and her sick mother, who are impoverished. Élise, Harpagon&#x27;s daughter, is the beloved of Valère, but her father hopes to marry her to a wealthy man of his choosing, Seigneur Anselme. Meanwhile, Valère has taken a job as steward in Harpagon&#x27;s household so as to be close to Élise. The complications are only resolved at the end by the rather conventional discovery that some of the principal characters are long lost relatives. 
Satire and farce blend in the fast-moving plot, as when the miser&#x27;s hoard is stolen. Asked by the police magistrate whom he suspects, Harpagon replies, “Everybody! I wish you to take into custody the whole town and suburbs” (5.1) and indicates the theatre audience while doing so. The play also makes fun of certain theatrical conventions, such as the spoken aside addressed to the audience, hitherto ignored by the characters onstage. The characters of &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot;, however, generally demand to know who exactly is being spoken to.

==Roles and original actors==
; Harpagon: Molière
: The tyrannical father of Cléante and Élise Harpagon is a sexagenarian bourgeois miser whose love for his cash box exceeds that for his children. He builds his wealth by lending at usurious rate while pinching every penny at home, refusing to replace the worn-out clothes of the servants he abuses. The sexagenarian is suitor of the young Mariane, whom Cléante also wishes to marry.

; Cléante: Du Croisy
: Harpagon&#x27;s profligate son, Cléante is also in love with Mariane. Intending to run away with her, he attempts to procure an illegal loan to provide Mariane and her ill mother with money, only to discover the lender is his own father. There is mutual resentment between the two over not only money but over love when Harpagon tricks his son into revealing his love for Mariane.

; Élise: Mlle de Brie
: The daughter of Harpagon, Élise owes her life to Valère, who saved her from drowning just before the beginning of the play. She opposes her father&#x27;s plans to wed her to the elderly Anselme, who has agreed to take her without a dowry.

; Valère: La Grange
: Valère has saved Élise from drowning and has come into the employ of Harpagon with intentions to win her. Harpagon mistrusts him and suspects him of wanting to rob him. At the end it is revealed he is of noble Napolitan blood, the brother of Mariane, and the son of Anselme who is really Don Thomas D&#x27;Alburcy.

; La Flèche: Louis Béjart
: A servant in Harpagon&#x27;s household, La Flèche helps Cléante arrange a clandestine loan through Master Simon. In a dramatic turn he digs up and steals Harpagon&#x27;s cash box.

; Master Jacques: André Hubert
: Master Jacques is cook and coachman to Harpagon.

; Anselme: Mr de Brie
: An elderly gentleman and suitor to Élise, Anselme is a wandering Napolitan noble who believes his wife and children drowned sixteen years earlier. At the climax it is discovered that Valère and Mariane are his children and his real name is Don Thomas D&#x27;Alburcy.

; Mariane: Armande Béjart-Molière
: The young woman whom Harpagon intends to wed is also the woman his son Cléante intends to run away with. She is revealed at the end to be the sister of Valère and daughter of Anselme, who is really Don Thomas D&#x27;Alburcy of Naples.

; Master Simon: La Thorillière?
: A dishonest character, Master Simon tries to arrange a usurious loan between Cléante and his father.

; Frosine: Madeleine Béjart
: Frosine is an elderly woman who acts as a go-between to ensure the marriage of Harpagon and Mariane; she convinces Harpagon that Mariane&#x27;s frugality will outweigh her lack of dowry, and that Mariane loves bespectacled old men.

Harpagon&#x27;s servants with minor roles include Brindavoine, La Merluche, and Mistress Claude, a cleaning woman with no lines. In the last act appears a Magistrate who investigates the theft of the cash-box with his Clerk, who has no spoken part.

==Synopsis==

; Act I
: La Flèche is waiting for his master in Harpagon&#x27;s house. Valère explains to the audience how he has assumed the role of a servant to be closer to Élise. They met when he rescued her from drowning and they fell in love. Harpagon enters, angry with La Flèche for hanging around. He suspects him of stealing something from him. La Flèche is angry at being suspected and points out that Harpagon is so careful with his money that it would be impossible to steal it. Harpagon confides in the audience expressing anxiety about the large sum of money he has buried in the garden. As Cléante and Élise enter he is again fearful that they might have heard what he is saying about the hidden money. When they approach Harpagon thinks that they are plotting to steal from him. They are actually trying to work out how to broach the subject of marriage with him since they have both found people they want to marry. Harpagon also wants to discuss marriage with them and he mentions a young girl called Mariane. Harpagon wants to know what Cléante thinks of her. Cléante is shocked and rushes off the stage. Meanwhile, Harpagon says that Élise has to marry Seigneur Anselme. Harpagon asks Valère for his opinion on the matter. Valère is trying to suck up and agrees with Harpagon&#x27;s idea. Valère reassures Élise that somehow they will sort things out later.

; Act II 
: Cléante expresses his frustration that he and his father are rivals in love with the same woman but plans to keep his own sentiments secret while he tries to secure funds to help Mariane and her mother. Cléante has dispatched La Flèche to meet with a money-lender. Maitre Simon has acted as an intermediary between La Flèche and the money-lender until the deal is done so as to protect his identity. La Flèche explains that there are some conditions attached to the loan. Cléante is ready to accept them whatever they are, so long as he can get money to give to his beloved. When La Flèche refers to them as &#x27;several small conditions&#x27; it is rather an understatement. Cléante is resentful but feels trapped by his desire for the money. Meanwhile, Maitre Simon enters with Harpagon discussing a young man who wants to borrow from Harpagon. Harpagon is displeased that Cléante is trying to borrow money from someone else. Cléante, dismissed by his father, expresses disgust and leaves.

; Act III
: The scene begins with Harpagon calling his household together to issue instructions in preparation for Mariane&#x27;s arrival for dinner. When it is Master Jacques&#x27;s turn, he wants to know whether he is being consulted as coachman or cook. Master Jacques insists that he can only produce excellent food if given money. Harpagon wants his carriage cleaning and horses getting ready. Mariane enters. She is shocked at how unattractive Harpagon is when they first meet and then even more shocked to be introduced to Harpagon&#x27;s son, who is no other than the man with whom she is herself in love. Cléante begins complimenting her which makes Harpagon very agitated because to him, Cléante&#x27;s words sound insulting and offensive. Cléante pays her compliments on his father&#x27;s behalf and tells her of an expensive array of delicacies and drinks he has arranged. He then insists they takes as a present, the diamond ring on his father&#x27;s hand. Harpagon becomes angry with Cléante for wasting his money, but hides his anger from Mariane. Élise arrives, is introduced to Mariane, announcing that someone has brought Harpagon some money. Harpagon quickly exits while Cléante and Élise escort Mariane on a tour of the garden.

; Act IV
: Harpagon sees Cléante kissing Mariane&#x27;s hand and suspects that something is happening between them. Harpagon wants Cléante to tell him his feelings about Mariane. Cléante expresses a lack of interest in her. Harpagon tricks Cléante into confessing his true feelings by suggesting he is having second thoughts about taking her as his wife, and would have given her to Cléante if he thought that Cléante had any feelings for her. Through further questioning, he establishes that Cléante does feel for her and has visited her a few times. Harpagon is angered when Cléante refuses to stop loving Mariane. Master Jacques is called to judge which of them is right and wrong. On stage, he moves between Cléante and Harpagon, listening to their complaints about each other and taking back to each, the version of the response by the other party that he knows each wants to hear. As Master Jacques leaves, he brings the two men together physically on stage to show their new found accord and then leaves them to a new argument. As they make up, they promise respect and tolerance to one another and say thank you to one another for allowing the other to marry Mariane. It then becomes clear as to what has happened, and the conversation returns to the former state of anger. Harpagon tells Cléante to leave and threatens to disinherit him. La Flèche enters excitedly. He has managed to steal Harpagon&#x27;s money box.

; Act V
: In this scene Seigneur Anselme enters. He does not want to force Élise into an unhappy marriage. Master Jacques accuses Valère of stealing Harpagon&#x27;s gold. When Valère comes in he believes the crime to which Harpagon desires him to confess is the crime of stealing the love of his daughter. When Valère says that he won&#x27;t deny it and he has no regrets, he refers to loving Élise but Harpagon thinks he&#x27;s admitting the theft of the money. Harpagon is puzzled. He is furious with Élise for falling for Valère, especially since he believes him to be a thief. Élise tries to justify this love as Valère saved her life, but Harpagon is not interested. Valère reveals that he is the son of a man of high rank, Dom Thomas d&#x27;Alburcy from Naples. Anselme says that this cannot be true as the whole family died in a shipwreck. Valère reveals that when the ship went down, he was saved and he recently discovered his father had also survived. On his search for his father he had met, saved, and fallen for Élise and had decided the best way to be near her was to assume the role of servant. Mariane claims him as her long-lost brother. She also survived the wreck with her mother and eventually came to France. Anselme then reveals he is their father. Harpagon&#x27;s first reaction is to hold Anselme responsible for the theft of his money. He shows no other emotion than greed. Harpagon is wary of letting them marry because of the cost of a wedding. However, Anselme generously offers to pay for everything. Harpagon is more bothered to find out who took his money. Cléante returns to Harpagon and negotiates with him for the right to marry Mariane in return for getting his money back.

==Sources==

Aside from the example of contemporary misers, Molière drew from a number of ancient and contemporary sources for elements in his &quot;The Miser&quot;. The character of Harpagon draws from the Latin play &quot;Aulularia&quot; by Plautus in which the miser Euclio incessantly changes the hiding place of his pot of gold out of fear of having it stolen, and the miser&#x27;s fourth-act monologue exaggerating the loss of his pot was the basis for Harpagon&#x27;s. Also from &quot;Aulularia&quot; Molière appropriated the love affair between Élise and Valère, Harpagon&#x27;s inspection of the hands of La Flèche, and Valère&#x27;s avowals of love for Élise that Harpagon takes as his confession to theft. &quot;La Belle Plaideuse&quot; (1655) of François le Métel de Boisrobert furnished Molière with the father-as-usurer, and the scene in which a lender lends the borrower 15,000 francs, of which 3,000 is in goods; several of these items appear in the list in &quot;The Miser&quot;. Jean Donneau de Visé&#x27;s &quot;la Mère coquette&quot; (1665) gave Molière a father and son in love with the same young woman.

==Theatrical adaptations==

Very soon after the play&#x27;s first production in 1668, versions began to appear elsewhere in Europe. A German translation, &quot;&quot;, appeared in Frankfurt in 1670. In England Thomas Shadwell adapted Molière&#x27;s work under the title &quot;The Miser&quot; in 1672 and added eight new characters. An even more popular version based on both Plautus and Molière was produced by Henry Fielding in 1732.

In Italian &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; there was already a tradition of depicting misers as the Pantaleone figure, who was represented as a rich and avaricious Venetian merchant. However, Molière&#x27;s play was eventually adapted to opera. Giovanni Bertati&#x27;s libretto based on the play was set by Pasquale Anfossi as &quot;L&#x27;avaro&quot; in 1775 and in 1776 it was set again by Gennaro Astarita. Giuseppe Palomba also wrote a libretto based on the work which was set by Giacomo Cordella in 1814. In Russia, too, Vasily Pashkevich based his 18th century comic opera &quot;The Miser&quot; on Molière&#x27;s play. Another musical adaptation in Arabic was pioneered by the Lebanese Marun Al Naqqash (1817–55) as &quot;al-Bakhil&quot;. This was performed in Beirut in 1847.

Jovan Sterija Popović, the founding father of Serbian theatre, based his &quot;Tvrdica&quot; (The Miser, 1837) on Molière&#x27;s play. In this work, the Harpagon figure is represented as a small town Greek merchant.

One reason for so many versions must be the acknowledged fact that Molière&#x27;s humour does not translate well and requires more or less free adaptation to succeed. The history of &quot;De Vrek&quot;, Taco de Beer&#x27;s 1863 translation into Dutch provides another notable example. In 1878 he adapted this to Dutch contemporary life and an edition of that version found its way to Indonesia. There it was further adapted into Malay as &quot;Si Bachil&quot; and given a contemporary Indonesian background. In 1941 this production in turn served as basis for Tamar Djaja&#x27;s novel of the same title, by which time the story had become all but unrecognisable.

The earliest American production of a play titled &quot;The Miser&quot; was of Fielding&#x27;s version in the years following 1766. A Broadway production of a translation of Molière&#x27;s play ran for only three nights at the Experimental Theatre in 1936 and there have been several revivals since in one version or another.

In 1954, &quot;The Laird o&#x27; Grippy&quot;, a free translation into Scots by Robert Kemp, was staged by the Edinburgh Gateway Company, with John Laurie in the leading role. 

An audio recording of the 1969 Lincoln Center production produced by Jules Irving and directed by Carl Weber was released by Caedmon Records (TRS 338). This recording of the adaptation by Ranjit Bolt is available at the Internet Archive. The play itself ran at the Vivian Beaumont Theater for 52 performances.

An Australian musical theatre adaptation with the name &quot;Mistress Money&quot; premiered in Sydney in 1960. It had book and lyrics by Eleanor Witcombe and John McKellar and music by Dot Mendoza.

More recently in Britain, John Coutts&#x27; English-Scots version of &quot;The Miser&quot; was performed in 2009 under the title &quot;The Auld Skinflint&quot;. In 2012 the play was made into a Bollywood musical titled &quot;Kanjoos The Miser&quot; by Hardeep Singh Kohli and Jatinder Verma and toured the UK.

<doc id="1158823" wikidata="Q1060639" url="?curid=1158823" title="Reef aquarium">
<text>A reef aquarium or reef tank is a marine aquarium that prominently displays live corals and other marine invertebrates as well as fish that play a role in maintaining the tropical coral reef environment. A reef aquarium requires appropriately intense lighting, turbulent water movement, and more stable water chemistry than fish-only marine aquaria, and careful consideration is given to which reef animals are appropriate and compatible with each other.

==Components==
Reef aquariums consist of a number of components, in addition to the livestock, including:

*Display tank: The primary tank in which the livestock are kept and shown.
*Stand: A stand allows for placement of the display tank at eye level and provides space for storage of the accessory components.
*Sump: An accessory tank in which mechanical equipment is kept. A remote sump allows for a clutter-free display tank.
*Refugium: An accessory tank dedicated to the cultivation of beneficial macroalgae and microflora/fauna. The refugium and sump are often housed in a single tank with a system of dividers to separate the compartments.
*Lighting: Several lighting options are available for the reef-keeper and are tailored to the types of coral kept.
*Canopy: The canopy houses the light fixtures and provides access to the tank for feeding and maintenance.
*Filtration and water movement: A variety of filtration and water movement strategies are employed in reef aquaria. Bulky equipment is often relegated to the sump.

===Display tank===

A &quot;reef ready&quot; or simply &quot;drilled&quot; tank is often used. This style of tank has holes drilled into the rear pane allowing water to drain into the sump or refugium.

These drains are usually housed in an internal overflow apparatus made of plastic or glass which encloses a drain standpipe and a water return line. The surface water pours over the overflow, down the standpipe, through PVC piping, into the sump. After transiting the sump, water is pushed by a return water pump through the second hole and into the aquarium.

Alternatively, standard non-drilled aquariums employ an external &quot;hang-on&quot; overflow that feeds water via continuous siphon to the sump.

The tanks are usually constructed from either glass or acrylic. Acrylic has the advantage of optical clarity, lightness, and ease of drilling. Drawbacks include a tendency to scratch easily, bowing, and often limited access from above due to top bracing. Glass aquariums are heavier but harder to scratch. Other materials such as epoxy-coated plywood have been used by industrious DIYers, but these materials are typically reserved for the construction of larger tanks.

===Filtration===

The primary biological filtration for reef aquariums usually comes from the use of live rock which come from various tropical zones around existing reefs, or more recently aquacultured rock from Florida. Some reefkeepers also use what is called deep sand beds (DSB). These are often employed to augment the biological filtration by aiding in the reduction of nitrate, a waste product in an incomplete nitrogen cycle. Deep sand bed opponents may prefer a &quot;bare bottom&quot; or &quot;suspended reef&quot; which allows for easier removal of nitrate-generating accumulated detritus. This biological filtration is usually supplemented by protein skimmers. Protein skimmers use the foam fractionation process wherein air is introduced into a water stream creating microbubbles. Organic waste adheres to the surface of these microbubbles and is removed as it overflows at the reactor surface into a removable cup. This group of elements used in conjunction is characteristic of the Berlin Method, named for the city in which it was first devised.

In recent years, the Berlin Method is often supplemented with a refugium. A refugium provides many benefits, which include nitrate reduction, as well as providing a natural food source. It typically houses two main species of macroalgae, including &quot;Caulerpa prolifera&quot; or &quot;chaetomorphae&quot; or both (because these two strains are known not to spore but grow by rooting to propagate). Macroalgae is used for two reasons: to remove excess nutrients from the water such as nitrate, phosphate, and iron, and to support beneficial microflora and fauna (zooplankton). Small invertebrates (copepods and amphipods) are provided a space free of predation to grow and, when returned to the display tank, serve as food for corals and fish. Conventional combined mechanical/biological filtration used in fish only systems is avoided because those filters trap detritus and produce nitrates which may stunt or even kill many delicate corals. Chemical filtration in the form of activated carbon is used when needed to remove discoloration of the water, or to remove dissolved matter (organic or otherwise) to help purify the water in the reef system.

===Water movement===
Water movement is important in the reef aquarium with different types of coral requiring different flow rates. At present, many hobbyists advocate a water turnover rate of 10x: 10 x aquarium capacity in gallons = required flow in gallons per hour⁠—⁠this is mathematically equivalent to a complete aquarium water turnover every 6 minutes. This is a general rule with many exceptions. Some corals, such as mushroom corals and polyp corals, require very little flow to thrive. Conversely, large-polyp stony corals such as brain coral, bubble coral, elegance coral, cup coral, torch coral, and trumpet coral require moderate amounts of flow, and small polyp stony corals such as &quot;Acropora&quot;, &quot;Montipora&quot;, &quot;Porites&quot;, and &quot;Pocillopora&quot; require high, turbulent, conditions, which imitates breaking waves in shallow water near the tip of the reef. The directions which water pumps are pointed within an aquarium will have a large effect on flow speeds. Many corals will gradually move themselves to a different area of the tank if the water movement in its current area is not satisfactory. 
&quot;Since flow speed is the critical measure for determining the rate of gas exchange, turnover does little to convey how fast a coral will respire and photosynthesize.&quot;
Reef ready tanks obtain at least a portion of the required water motion from the pump that returns water from the sump. This flow usually is augmented by other strategies. A popular strategy is placement within the display tank of multiple powerheads. Powerheads are simply small submersible water pumps that produce a laminar or narrow, unidirectional water stream. If the presence of the powerhead in the tank does not fit with the aesthetics of the display, small holes may be drilled in an overflow of a tank and the bulk of the powerhead can be hidden, leaving only the small funnel spout visible in the tank. The pumps may be alternately switched on and off using a wave timer and aimed at one another or at the aquarium glass to create turbulent flow in the tank. Drawbacks to the use of these powerheads include their capacity to clutter the display tank, propensity for excess heat production, and the laminar quality of water flow often produced. Another method is the closed loop in which water is pulled from the main tank into a pump which returns the water back into the aquarium via one or more returns to create water turbulence. Newer submersible propeller pumps are gaining popularity and are able to generate large volumes of turbulent water flow without the intensely directed laminar force of a power head. Propeller pumps are more energy-efficient than powerheads, but require a higher initial investment.

Another recent method is the gyre tank. A gyre tank encourages a maximum amount of water momentum through a divider in the center of the aquarium. The divider leaves an open, unobstructed space which provides a region with little friction against water movement. Building water momentum using a gyre is an efficient method to increase flow, thus benefiting coral respiration and photosynthesis.

Water flow is important to bring food to corals, since no coral fully relies on photosynthesis for food. Gas exchange occurs as water flows over a coral, bringing oxygen and removing gases and shedding material. Water flow assists in reducing the risk of thermal shock and damage by reducing the coral&#x27;s surface temperature. The surface temperature of a coral living near the water&#x27;s surface can be significantly higher than the surrounding water due to infrared radiation.

===Lighting===

With the advent of newer and better technologies, increasing intensities and a growing spectrum, there are many options to consider.

Many, if not most aquarium corals contain within their tissue the symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae. It is these zooxanthellae that require light to perform photosynthesis and in turn produce simple sugars that the corals utilize for food. The challenge for the hobbyist is to provide enough light to allow photosynthesis to maintain a thriving population of zooxanthellae in a coral tissue. Though this may seem simple enough but in reality can prove to be a very complex task.

Some corals, such as mushroom corals and polyp corals, require very little light to thrive. Conversely, large-polyp stony corals such as brain coral, bubble coral, elegance coral, cup coral, torch coral, and trumpet coral require moderate amounts of light, and small polyp stony corals such as &quot;Acropora&quot;, &quot;Montipora&quot;, &quot;Porites&quot;, and &quot;Pocillopora&quot; require high intensity lighting.

Of the various types, most popular aquarium lighting comes from metal halide lamps, very high output or VHO, compact fluorescent and T5 high output lighting systems. Although they were once widely used, many reef tank aquarists have abandoned T12 and T8 fluorescent lamps due to their poor intensity, and mercury vapor due to its production of a limited light spectrum.

Recent advances in lighting technology have also made available a completely new technology for aquarium lighting: light emitting diodes (LEDs). Although LEDs themselves are not new, the technology has only recently been adapted to produce systems with qualities that allow them to be considered viable alternatives to gas- and filament-based aquarium lighting systems. The newness of the technology does cause them to be relatively expensive, but these systems bring several advantages over traditional lighting. Although their initial cost is much higher, they tend to be economical in the long run because they consume less power and have far longer lifespans than other systems. Also, because LED systems are made of hundreds of very small bulbs, a microcomputer can control their output to simulate daybreak and sunset. Some systems also have the ability to simulate moonlight and the phases of the moon, as well as vary the color temperature of the light produced. Moreover, some manufacturers produce LED lighting systems in single bright and double bright intensities for sustaining coral life in marine aquariums.

The choices for aquarium lighting are made complicated by variables such as color temperature, (measured in kelvins), color rendering index (CRI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and lumens. Power output available to the hobbyist can range from a meager 9 W fluorescent lamp to a blinding 1000 W metal halide lamp. Lighting systems also vary in the light output produced by each bulb type—listed in order of weakest to strongest they would be: T8/12 or normal output lamps, compact fluorescent and T5 high output, VHO, and metal halide lamps. To further complicate matters, there are several types of ballasts available: electric ballast, magnetic ballast, and pulse start ballast.

===Heating and cooling===

Reef tanks are usually kept at a temperature between . Radical temperature shifts should be avoided as these can be particularly harmful to reef invertebrates and fish. Depending on the location of the tank and the conditions therein (i.e. heat/air conditioning), one may install a heater and/or a chiller for the tank. Heaters are relatively inexpensive and readily available at any local fish store. Aquarists frequently use the sump to hide unsightly equipment such as heaters. Chillers, on the other hand, are expensive and are more difficult to locate. For many aquarists, installing surface fans and running home air conditioning suffice in place of a chiller. Fans cool the tank via evaporative cooling and require more frequent top-off of the aquarium water.

===Water chemistry===
Stony corals, which are defined by their calcareous calcium carbonate skeletons (CaCO3), are the focus of many advanced reef keepers. These corals require additional attention to water chemistry, especially maintenance of stable and optimal calcium, carbonate, and pH levels. These parameters may be tracked and adjusted with test kits and frequent manual dosing of calcium and pH buffer additives requiring no additional equipment. Alternatively, automated methods employing small dedicated computers with electronic water quality monitoring capabilities are often used to control water chemistry parameters via several components including calcium reactors and kalkwasser reactors. Calcium reactors are canisters filled with crushed coral skeletons. Carbon dioxide is injected into the canister acidifying the water and dissolving the coral skeletons. The acidified and CaCO3 rich solution is then pumped into the sump. The excess CO2 then diffuses out of the water and into the air leaving behind the CaCO3. Kalkwasser is an aqueous solution of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2. The kalk reactor stirs and dispenses the solution into the sump where the Ca(OH)2 combines with dissolved CO2 to produce CaCO3. These components must be controlled by a computer to prevent dangerous changes in pH due to the acidic calcium reactor effluent or alkaline kalkwasser effluent.

Optimal water parameters are:
*Salinity: 1.022–1.025 sg or 30–34 parts per thousand (ppt)
*Temperature: 24–27 °C (297-300 K, 76–80 °F, 536-540 °R)
*Ammonia (NH3): 0 parts per million (ppm)
*Nitrite (NO2−): 0 ppm
*Nitrate (NO3−): 0–10 ppm
*Phosphate (PO43−): 0–0.06 ppm
*pH: 8.2–8.6
*Calcium (Ca2+): 400–450 ppm
*Alkalinity: 7–12 dKH

Trace elements can become depleted by marine livestock and filtration, but can be replenished during a water change.

===Safety===
Large volumes of electrically conductive salt water, complex plumbing, and numerous electrical appliances housed in close proximity certainly pose a significant risk of damage to both person and property and require close attention to safety. All equipment should be used according to manufacturer instructions. Electrical equipment should be placed above water level whenever possible, and drip loops should always be used. Circuit limits should never be exceeded and all appliances should be plugged into ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets. These can be purchased at any hardware store and are relatively easy to install. Plug in GFCI power strips are also readily available. Home monitoring equipment with water sensors can also be adapted for the home aquarist and used to alert the owner of power outages or water overflows. This equipment can allow for timely intervention in a potential disaster and provides an added sense of security for frequent travelers.

==Nano reefs==
A nano reef is a type of marine aquarium that is typically less than 140 litres (30 Imperial gallons / 37 US gallons). The exact limit that distinguishes a nano reef from a regular reef is somewhat ill-defined. Some claim that anything less than 180 litres (40 Imperial gallons / 48 US gallons) would qualify. But 140 litres (30 Imperial gallons / 37 US gallons) seems to be the generally accepted limit. Nano reefs have become quite popular in recent years among fish keeping hobbyists, primarily because of their smaller size, maintainability, and the possibility of lower costs. The burgeoning interest in this niche of marine aquarium science has fostered several notable contributions ranging from specific consumer products such as specialized aquarium filters, compact high intensity lighting systems and smaller circulation pumps. Such equipment allows the aquarist to maintain an environment wherein many marine organisms are capable of thriving.

An early reference to these small reef aquariums was made in 1989 by Albert J. Thiel in his book &quot;Small Reef Aquarium Basics&quot;.

Nano reefs are very commonly sold as complete kits which contain the tank, stand, power compact T5, T8, PL lamps or metal halide lighting, protein skimmer, UV steriliser, 3 or more stage filtration, a heater and a water pump or powerhead. However, many nano reefkeepers decide to upgrade their aquariums with better quality equipment such as a more powerful protein skimmer or lighting.

===Pico reefs===
Another term gaining popularity is &quot;pico reef&quot;, which is used to refer to the smallest of nano reef aquariums. Most online forum polls set the range of approximately 10 litres (2.5 gallons) and below as pico reefs. These tiny tanks require even more diligence with regard to water changes and attention to water chemistry because the small water volume provides little room for error. Care must be exercised when stocking these tiny tanks because too many inhabitants can easily overload the tank&#x27;s ability to process wastes effectively. For the smallest of pico reefs, even the presence of a single fish is discouraged. Pico reefs often consist of live rock, hardy corals, and small invertebrates such as hermit crabs and marine snails. The keeping of pico reef aquariums has tested the extent of allelopathy, the chemical and physical means by which corals compete for space. Before the advent of these concentrated environments, it was thought to be impossible for corals of even a few mixed genera to occupy such a small shared water volume.

===Challenges associated with small reef aquariums===
Due to the small water volume, fluctuations of water quality occur more easily, and so nano reef aquariums require extra attention to water quality compared to aquariums of larger water volumes. Many experienced reef aquarists recommend testing the water twice weekly, with water changes at least every week. In particular, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, salinity, alkalinity, calcium and phosphate levels should be monitored closely. When it comes to nano reefs, even minute changes in water conditions such as mild temperature fluctuations can be problematic, whereas the greater water volume of larger aquariums provides a more stable and flexible environment.

Nano reefs also require extra care in the selection of occupants. There are two major factors to be considered: biological load, i.e., the ability of the tank to process the wastes produced by the occupants, and species compatibility. These issues, though present in larger tanks, are magnified in the nano tank. Species considered reef safe and able to coexist in larger tanks may not do well in a nano tank because of their close physical proximity. For this reason, smaller species of fish, such as gobies and clownfish, are popular choices because of their relatively small size and ability to coexist peacefully with other tank inhabitants.

===Filtration in nano reefs===
Many nano reef aquarists prefer their displays to be as natural-looking as possible, and therefore choose to use as few mechanical filtration methods as possible. A primary filtration method in nano reefs is live rock and live sand, which are pieces of rock and sand that have broken from the coral reef and are populated with beneficial bacteria and other organisms that aid in breaking down organic wastes produced by larger organisms in the nano reef. Other nano reef aquarists use devices such as protein skimmers to remove excess waste from the aquarium, before it has a chance to be broken down to nitrate. Removing the excess wastes mechanically can reduce the frequency of water changes needed to keep nitrate levels low. Delaying the action of the mechanical filters, such as by means of a day-night timer, can allow invertebrates to filter-feed naturally. A refugium may also be used to export nutrients, when packed with macroalgae such as &quot;Chaetomorpha&quot;, and live rock. Deep sand bed filters are another filtration method.
&lt;br&gt;Recently there have been several &quot;natural&quot; methods of processing waste in the aquarium and specifically small environments as nano-reefs. The research on the encouragement of the development of different types of sponges and micro-organisms to process the pollutants in the aquarium, a matter that has been gaining popularity in the aquarium community.

<text>&quot;Federmesser&quot; group is an archaeological umbrella term 
including the late Upper Paleolithic to Mesolithic cultures of the Northern European Plain, dating to between 14,000 and 12,800 years ago (the late Magdalenian). It is closely related to the Tjongerian culture, as both have been suggested.
It includes the &quot;Tjongerian&quot; sites at Lochtenrek in the Frisian part of the Netherland, spanning the area of Belgium, the Netherlands, northern France, northern Germany, southern Denmark, and Poland (&quot;Tarnowian&quot; and &quot;Witowian&quot; cultures). It is also closely related to the Creswellian culture to the west and the Azilian to the south. The name is derived from the characteristic small backed flint blades, in German termed &quot;Federmesser&quot; (&quot;quill knife&quot;). It is succeeded by the Ahrensburg culture after 12,800 BP.

<doc id="1158831" wikidata="Q5351778" url="?curid=1158831" title="El Paso Intelligence Center">
<text>The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) was established in 1974 in response to a study by the Justice Management Division of the U.S. Department of Justice entitled, &quot;A Secure Border.&quot; 

== History ==
Recommendation number 7 of this study suggested the establishment of a southwest border intelligence center to be led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and staffed by representatives of that agency, as well as the U.S. Customs Service. The initial focus of the Center was to assist in the identification of drug traffickers and alien traffickers along the U.S.-Mexico border. 

The current EPIC facility was dedicated on 22 February 1989 in memory of DEA Special Agent Enrique Camarena-Salazar who was slain in the line of duty while conducting an undercover operation in Mexico. Expanded in 1998–1999, EPIC headquarters lies within Biggs Army Airfield at Fort Bliss military reservation in El Paso, Texas and is run jointly by the DEA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In the pre-DHS era, the three main federal agencies at EPIC were DEA, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the U.S. Customs Service.

EPIC is now staffed with over 300 personnel and liaison officers from 15 agencies.

<doc id="1158832" wikidata="Q205592" url="?curid=1158832" title="Antony, Hauts-de-Seine">
<text>Antony () is a commune in the southern suburbs of Paris, France, from the centre of Paris. Antony is a subprefecture of the Hauts-de-Seine department and the seat of the arrondissement of Antony.

Watered by the Bièvre, a tributary of the Seine, Antony is at the crossroads of important transport routes, especially the main north–south axis, which has existed for 2,000 years. Little urbanized until the early 20th century, the city grew considerably between the two wars, under Senator-Mayor Auguste Mounié, from 4,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. In the early 1960s the population quickly increased from 25,000 to 50,000 to accommodate repatriated people from Algeria. Now incorporated in the Paris Metropolitan Area, it is particularly strong in education, with one of the largest private institutions in France, and in health, with the largest private establishment in Île-de-France.

The commune has been awarded &quot;two flowers&quot; by the National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom in the Competition for Cities and Villages in Bloom.

==Geography==

===Location===
Antony is a city in the southern suburbs of Paris in the Hurepoix and is the chief town of the arrondissement of Hauts-de-Seine - 12.2 km south of Notre-Dame Cathedral. Its altitude is 48m above sea level at the lowest point at rue Gabriel Chamon in the Bièvre Valley and 100m at the highest point in the Avenue d&#x27;Estienne d&#x27;Orves on the border with Châtenay-Malabry. Antony is at the intersection of three departments:
*Essonne, with the communes of Verrières-le-Buisson to the west, Wissous to the east, and Massy to the south;
*Hauts-de-Seine, with the communes of Châtenay-Malabry to the west, Sceaux and Bourg-la-Reine to the north;
*Val-de-Marne, with the communes of Fresnes and L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses to the east

Antony is traversed by three rivers: the Bièvre River and its two tributaries, the Ruisseau des Godets and the Ruisseau de Rungis. One branch of the Bièvre upstream flows in the open through Heller Park in an area where the Bièvre is maintained by the Inter-communal association for development of the Bièvre Valley. From there it has been channeled and covered since the decision of the municipal council on 26 October 1950 nearly all the way to Paris. It then becomes part of the network of the &quot;Inter-departmental association for sanitation of the Paris agglomeration&quot;. Since the early 2000s, the restoration of the open air to the Bièvre at Antony and downstream has been envisaged. In 2003 this was done to Fresnes at the &quot;Pars des Prés&quot; on the edge of the La Fontaine district of Antony.

Antony is bisected by the South Parisian Green corridor which forms a portion of the &quot;via Turonensis&quot;: one of four paths in France for the pilgrimage to Saint Jacques de Compostela.

===Geology and terrain===
The commune area is with the altitude varying between .

The plateaux of Beauce ends in the north in an area crossed by small tributaries of the Seine. Antony is located in the extreme north-east of this area, called Hurepoix.

The crust of limestone of Beauce ends with a ledge at the edge of the Bois de Verrières. It covers a thick impermeable layer about thick of sand mixed with marl from Fontainebleau which is itself resting on layers of green marl in which there are some areas of gypsum then finally blue marl forming the bottom of the Bièvre valley. These green and blue marls form a completely waterproof layer about thick. These set the date of these layers to the Tertiary period when the sea occupying the centre of the Paris Basin began to retreat.

The old village of Antony is located on the green marl at the edge of the outcrop of the water table. It was in the gypsum layer that, in Antony in 1807, Georges Cuvier discovered the fossils of an extinct animal, one of the first to be scientifically recognized - in 1796 Cuvier had been one of first to argue species could become extinct. Naming it &quot;Anoplotherium commune&quot;, he described a mammalian ungulate herbivore with a long tail and the stature of a donkey or horse that lived 30 million years ago in the Late Eocene to the earliest Oligocene.

===Climate===
Antony climate type is of degraded oceanic. The most commonly used meteorological observation stations for Antony are those at Orly and at the airport of Vélizy-Villacoublay, both being communes located near Antony. The climate in the departments of the inner suburbs of Paris is characterized by sunshine and relatively low rainfall. The following table compares the climate of the city of Antony with that of some large French cities:

The issue of flooding in some districts of Antony and Fresnes, following clogging of water networks (i.e. stormwater, wastewater and the Bièvre) during violent storms (1982, 2001, 2008) returns periodically although a protection plan against flooding was made, either by the prefect or the mayor, in August 2006.

===Channels of communication and transport===

====Roads====
Antony is primarily served by the D920 road (formerly National Route 20) which passes along the entire length of the commune tracing the route of the Roman road &quot;via Aurelianensis&quot; which crossed Gaul from south to north coming from Spain and going to Cologne.

Crossing Antony from east to west is the A86 autoroute which, since 1996, follows the route of National Road RN186 which itself traced the route of the road opened by Louis XV. The A86 is heavily used by Parisians during peak hours in the morning and late afternoon. It is a way of avoiding Paris by a peripheral route. Though it replaced the function of the RN186, the latter was retained as an urban axis. Parts of the A86 are covered or are in a tunnel at Antony. Work began there more than thirty years ago and was completed by the end of the 2000s. Due to lack of funding, construction of the southern tunnel of the A86 has currently stopped at the RER bridge. The drilling of the section between the Sub-Prefecture building and the RER bridge is still under consideration by State services.

These roads have very high traffic (20,000 to 40,000 vehicles per day) and cause nuisance to local residents. It is expected that eventually the RD920 will be converted into an urban boulevard.

Antony is also served by the A10 autoroute with an exit to join the RN20 and to enter through the south of the city.

====Bicycle paths and pedestrian areas====

In November 1989 a bike path running through the city inside the Green Belt was built for a length of . Since 9 October 2005 it has been possible to cycle inside the Parc de Sceaux, an area dependent on Hauts-de-Seine department but partly in Antony.

Given the density of traffic and as intended by PLU, a coherent easy circulation network consisting of areas limited to 30 km/h and cycling paths primarily to schools and colleges was created. A zone limited to 30 km/h is linked to a zone limited to 10 km/h: in this area priority is given to pedestrians as shown in the photo below.

Expansion of areas limited to 30 km/h is underway in all areas of Antony with the aim of gradually moving the whole city to 30 km/h except for the RD920, for which a redevelopment project is proposed for the creation of cycle paths.

The zones were defined in 2009 and most of the 30 km/h roads are accessible in both directions for cyclists.

====Communal Transport====
Antony is connected to the RER network through six stations:
;five stations on the RER Line B
These are, from north to south:
*Parc de Sceaux
*La Croix de Berny
*Antony
*Fontaine Michalon
*Les Baconnets

The first three stations are in zone 3 for the navigo pass, the other two are in zone 4. Antony station is the most important and was completely rebuilt and returned to service in June 2002. It includes both the station for RER line B, the terminus for 13 bus routes and the terminal of Orlyval. A taxi rank and two bicycle parking garages are nearby. Approximately 25,000 passengers pass through this transport axis every day.

;Chemin d&#x27;Antony
A station on RER Line C in zone 4.

Many bus routes connect Antony to Paris and neighbouring communes via bus networks in the Île-de-France:
*10 routes of RATP bus network: TVM, 119, 196, 197, 286, 297, 319, 379, 395, and 396;
*8 routes of the &quot;Paladin&quot; bus network: 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 12, and 13;
*2 routes of the &quot;Daniel Meyer&quot; bus network: DM151 and DM152;
*2 routes of Noctilien: N21 and N71

Since 21 July 2007 the city of Antony has been served by the &quot;Trans-Val-de-Marne&quot; (Tvm) through the RER station of La Croix de Berny. This rapid transit bus service has its own Bus lanes and links Antony to the Saint-Maur-Créteil railway station providing access to the limits of the region to the east such as Créteil, the Rungis International Market, The Belle Épine commercial centre, and Choisy-le-Roi.

Planned for 2020, the Antony-Clamart Tramway will connect La Croix de Berny railway station to Clamart - Place du Garde.

====Rail transport====
By RER Line B Antony is near Paris railway stations. Through Antony station the Gare du Nord and the Gare de Lyon can be reached in 28 minutes (direct connection to the RER) and the Gare Saint-Lazare railway station in 32 minutes. Antony is also very close to the Massy TGV railway station which can be reached in 5 minutes by RER. This station has the distinction of being both one of the new stations of Île-de-France served by inter-provincial TGV and also a new station for the LGV Atlantique radial line. Thus certain trains serve both the Paris-Montparnasse railway station and this station which makes it useful for going to Paris to take the TGV.

RER line C also passes through Antony (the Massy-Pontoise branch) but it is significantly underutilized as serving suburbs because of its simultaneous use as a connecting link for the TGV between the South-West network and the North network as well as having many heavy freight trains. Réseau Ferré de France (RFF) has proposed the creation of a third line on the right of way to facilitate the coexistence of three types of rail traffic, but in the absence of specific guarantees of soundproofing measures the project has been rejected both by the residents&#x27; associations and by the Antony council.

====Air transport and airport access====
Antony is near Orly Airport. Since 2 October 1991 it can be reached in seven minutes by Orlyval, a narrow-gauge light railway of VAL type from the Antony RER B railway station. The use of this line is provided by RATP and it has special pricing that does not include it in the package for the Navigo pass.

==Town planning==

===Urban Morphology===
INSEE divided the commune into four &quot;large quarters&quot; called Croix de Berny, Rabats, Baconnets, and Centre-ville which were themselves cut into 27 grouped blocks for statistical information.


Antony revised its local urban plan (PLU) in 2007 based on the findings of a survey conducted in 2004 among residents and the results have been an organisation and sustainable development plan (PADD). The development of this PLU ended with the adoption of the final draft by a vote of the City Council on 30 May 2008. The main direction for the PLU was a balanced urban development, a dynamic economy, developing public facilities, and to preserve a framework for a quality living environment with improved movement of people. This vision has however been challenged by a preceding public inquiry. The municipality indicated that the city enjoyed a lifestyle that should be preserved: a rich natural heritage, green spaces, a diverse architectural heritage (the old stone quarry, individual art nouveau houses, art deco and modern architecture), an ancient well-developed heart with many rows of trees and woodlands but, paradoxically, part of the suburban area was transferred into a zone where dense building development became possible.

The PLU (the subject of a draft amendment in 2012) defined the segmentation of the commune into 9 districts: Croix de Berny / La Fontaine, Coulée verte, Centre-ville / Hôtel de ville, Centre-ville / Mounié, Pajeaud, Paul-Bert, Noyer-Doré / Baconnets, Rabats, and Industrial Zones. Antony has of streets of which are local roads, departmental and national roads for which the city is responsible for maintenance, and of private roads.

===Housing===
To cope with the increasing number of people since the 1950s two interesting &quot;Castors&quot; (self-construction cooperative) experiments took place in Antony in 1953 and 1954. The &quot;Castor&quot; was responsible to build his own home there and to pay close attention. After the Second World War, before the housing shortage, the French decided to build their own houses by joining in anonymous cooperative societies. Thus companies were created, such as &quot;The Cricket of Île-de-France&quot; and &quot;The Castors of Bièvre&quot;. In 1953, the &quot;Company of Counters&quot; of Montrouge which had allotments at Antony (located behind the square Marc Sangnier on the border with Fresnes) offered its employees to sell the land at a nominal price. Nearly 150 houses were built between 1953 and 1957. Their owners were fully invested in these constructions, working on weekends and after their workday. The rules were very strict: rest was only allowed one Sunday per month and only during a week of paid leave. The allocation of houses to employees was made by lot, one each until every house was built. Many houses are still occupied by the original &quot;Castor&quot;.

The housing seen in Antony today represents a diversified heritage: ancient houses in quarry stone, individual Art Nouveau house, Art Deco houses, and contemporary architecture. Buildings built in the 1960s are being renovated while in recent years small buildings have replaced the old houses along the RD920 (ex-RN20) to achieve a continuous frontage. In a survey by the weekly &quot;Le Point&quot; on the cities of France &quot;where we saw the best&quot;, Antony is very well ranked in almost all areas studied, notably in first position for housing. In 2017 in Antony there were 28,841 housing units including 26,734 primary homes or 92.7% of all dwellings. Second homes and casual accommodation numbered 424 units or 1.5% of the total. The number of vacant houses totaled 1,684 or 5.8%. Of all of these units there were 9,275 individual houses (32.2%) and 19,394 units in shared buildings (67.2%).

The average number of occupants per dwelling decreased sharply: 3.24 in 1968, 2.65 in 1982 and 2.43 in 1999. The number of households of one or two persons increased between 1982 and 1999 and had an influence on the consumption of housing land, especially in the outer areas. Thus as the number of households increases the commune needs more housing to accommodate the same number of inhabitants.

The primary residences are relatively recent: in 2017, 2,731 units or 10.4% predated 1945, 9,035 dated from the period between 1946 and 1970 (34.4%); 7,337 dated from 1971 to 1990 (27.9%), and 4,042 dated from 1991 to 2005 (15.4%). As for the number of rooms in these houses, 7.4% had one room, 14.4% had two rooms, 27.6% had three rooms, 23.1% had four rooms, and 27.5% had five or more rooms.

In Antony the average price of real estate for sale in 2008 was about 4,270 euros/m2 and the average price of property for rent was EUR 17.39/m2/month. The suburban area covers of the city with a coefficient of occupation of land of 0.7. The municipality claims to be seeking to enforce a rule of 20% social housing but the communal social housing policy was challenged by an inter-ministerial mission during the summer of 2008. Many projects to rehabilitate social housing are underway but since 1990 there has been more destruction of social housing than creation. This is particularly the case in the construction of the &quot;Grand Ensemble&quot;, &quot;Parvis&quot; (Breuil, Bièvre), &quot;White City&quot;, and &quot;Guillebaud City&quot;. The municipality also highlighted the renovation of buildings along the RD920 (ex RN20) to promote a continuous frontage and dormant urbanisation spaces which is presented as an attempt to maintain the number of inhabitants despite the national trend of decline in the number of people per family.

===Development projects===
The two main urbanisation operations in Antony are in the quarter of Croix-de-Berny and Noyer-Doré. Organized by the law No. 2003-710 of 1 August 2003. The national urban renewal program provided an unprecedented national effort to renovate districts in difficulty. It is in this context that the Noyer-Dore district, in the south of Antony, is under renovation. The PLU also provided for two new urban developments: the development of the Bas-Graviers/Crocheteurs district along the A86 and to the east of the city, the development of the Cemagref land near the Descartes school.

The development work in Croix de Berny began in the 1970s with the creation of the A86 then its partial covering. Important work has been undertaken to extend to 2 lanes the 2 tunnels on the A86, its extension to 2 lanes in 3 tunnels is envisaged. The land near the square, which was occupied until 1989 by the sub-prefecture, was ceded to the city of Antony who built office buildings. The layout of the site itself began in the 2000s by installing a fountain in diameter whose style and cost have been variously appreciated.

The roofing of the A86 was provisionally completed in 2008. State services are currently working on the completion of the project &quot;Tube South-west&quot; which should finally complete the doubling of the tunnel of Croix de Berny commissioning with two lanes in three tunnels.

The renovation of the district of Noyer-Dore, planned for a decade, began in March 2001 with the destruction of several buildings (including &quot;The Big L&quot; built in the 1960s). This district, always characterized by geographic isolation from the rest of the commune and a deficit in public facilities and shops, is part of the sensitive urban zone called &quot;The Grand ensemble&quot;, a zone spread across the communes of Antony and Massy.

==Toponymy==
It was in a confirmation by King Louis I the Pious made for the monks of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in 829, that the toponym &quot;Antony&quot; is mentioned for the first time as &quot;Antoniacum&quot; meaning &quot;estate of Antonius&quot;, a Gallo-Roman landowner. Then it was attested in the forms: &quot;Anthoniaco&quot;, &quot;Anthognyaco&quot;, &quot;Antongni&quot;, &quot;Antoni&quot;, and &quot;Antony&quot; from the 18th century with the exception of a brief period during the French Revolution when it took the name of &quot;Antony-Révolution&quot;.

The known origin of the city dates back to the 3rd century. The name &quot;Antony&quot; is a Gallo-Roman formation and comes from the Latin anthroponym &quot;Antonius&quot; (giving &quot;Antoine&quot;, worn by a native), followed by the suffix &quot;-acum&quot; of Gallic origin. A Homonym with Antogny, Antoigné, and Antoigny all of which toponyms date back to the Gallo-Roman &quot;&quot;.

==History==
Related article: Île-de-France.

Antony has a long history, dating from the 3rd century in the Gallo-Roman era. Its history merges with that of the Royal Domain formed in the 10th century by the Capetian kings, which gave rise to the Île-de-France region.

===Prehistoric and Gallo-Roman era===
In prehistoric times people settled along the edges of the plateau overlooking the valley. The remains of their settlements are still visible in the &quot;Bois de Verrières&quot;. The selection of sites was from the beginning conditioned by water and access. The village that later gave birth to Antony was installed in a location conducive to human settlement: a hillside site with many advantages—easy to protect because of its height with richer soil than that on the plateau and in an area not subject to flooding as it was above the marshes but at the level of water sources that rise from the green marl. The many fountains in Rue de l&#x27;Eglise and the Avenue du Bois-de-Verrières and the place names (Sources, Gouttieres) attest to the existence of this Water table.

In 1852, when the cemetery was being moved from in front of the church, sarcophagi were discovered that were originally supposed to be Frankish or Merovingian. It may be that people have lived around the Gallo-Roman villa since ancient times.

===Antony from the 10th to the 15th centuries===
From the 10th to the 15th century the Lordship of Antony was one of the main dependencies of the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés. The location at Antony had a ford called &quot;Pont-aux-Ânes&quot; (Bridge of the Asses) from Roman and medieval times. This hillside location provided Antony with a connection with Montlhéry, a stronghold which monitored the southern approaches to Paris. Antony also had a small fortress, the &quot;Tour d&#x27;Argent&quot; (Tower of Silver) which was located in the upper part of the village in a position overlooking the ford and possibly serving a defensive function.

In 1042, the King of France, Henri I, accorded the abbot of Saint-Germain des Près &quot;an altar dedicated to Saint Saturnin and located in the territory of Paris, in the jurisdiction called Paris&quot;.

In 1177 in recognition of the importance of the village Antony chapel became a parish church. The people were then all serfs of the Abbey. City dwellers then began to get communal Charters and those campaigns began the great liberation movement that led to the emancipation of the serfs.

The decisive date was in 1248: Thomas de Mauleon, the Abbot of Saint-Germain des Près, freed his serfs in Antony and Verrières. Many expenses still faced these farmers: they had to pay an annual rent, tithes for the mills, ovens, and presses, and also provide Corvées or unpaid labour, such as cleaning the Bièvre every three years.

The Kings of France had the right of accommodation in Antony. Under Louis IX there were lawsuits against people who refused to submit to this law. They were condemned.

During the 14th and 15th centuries Antony had troubles from the Hundred Years War then the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War: plagues, famine and devastation. At the end of this long period, the Abbey was crushed by debt and the region was emptied of its inhabitants. There were only 100 inhabitants left in Antony at the end of the wars.

In 1346 King Philip of Valois, on his way to the feast of the Assumption, camped in Antony believing that Edward III, King of England, would pass through there on his way to Flanders. The prince waited in vain for two days, the King of England having passed through Poissy heading towards Beauvais.

===The opening up (16th to 18th centuries)===
The road from Paris to Orléans was paved under François I: it crossed the Bièvre at the &quot;Pont d&#x27;Antony&quot; from which a path led to the centre of the village near the church of Saint-Saturnin. The development of this road led to the development of the city.

In 1545 François I, while at prayers with Cardinal de Tournon, Commendatory abbot of Saint Germain, gave letters patent for the establishment of fairs at Antony on Thursday after Pentecost and on Saint Catherine&#x27;s day (25 November) as well as a market every Thursday.

The famous top-quality candle maker Trudon was established here in 1737 after buying the business established in 1702 from Pean de Saint Gilles, wax supplier to the King.

At the end of the 17th century and early in the 18th century, Antony became a holiday town close to Paris: La Fontaine and Charles Perrault took their summer quarters there. This is also the period during which many mansions were built by notable Parisian who came to Antony for the countryside just outside Paris. Most mansions still remained in the middle of the 20th century: the old castle, the property of the actor François Molé, the folly of the Castries family in Heller Park now demolished but an outbuilding remains, the house of the &quot;Belle Levantine&quot; (now the Maison Saint-Jean), the property of the Ladies of Saint Raphael, and the property of Ballainvilliers purchased in 1860 by the surgeon Alfred Velpeau.

===Development in the 19th century===

Antony remained predominantly agricultural until the early 20th century. Le Petit Journal wrote in 1922: &quot;The pretty commune of Antony is one of those, in the suburbs of Paris, where agriculture is still the most thriving&quot;. The city was known for its coaching inn for horses that welcomed travelers at the crossroads called &quot;Croix de Berny&quot; because it was at the intersection of the royal road, dating from the 18th century, leading from Versailles to Choisy-le-Roi, and the road from Paris to Orléans with the intersection in the north-west corner of the Château de Berny Park.

The construction of the railway profoundly transformed the activity of the city when the Sceaux line opened in 1854 then the Arpajonnais line in 1893. The building of mansions continued: the property of the Marquis of Castries was demolished and replaced in the Second Empire by Sarran Castle and Bourdeau Park whose remains have today become the &quot;Maison des Arts&quot; (Art House).

Antony became the seat of numerous religious congregations. The &quot;Sisters of the Cross of Saint-André&quot; who had a girls&#x27; religious school at Antony since 1720, in 1928 became the &quot;Institute of the Cross&quot;, then &quot;The Cross&quot; before being integrated into the &quot;Institution of Sainte-Marie of Antony&quot; which incorporated several religious congregations. The Marianists bought the Chénier property and installed their French seminar. Returning after their expulsion in 1903, their building became the Maison Saint-Jean, now a retreat for Marianists. In 1968 they created the &quot;Institution of Sainte-Marie of Antony&quot;.

The Redemptorists (Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer) purchased the property of the surgeon Velpeau on 5 August 1889 to build their novitiate. Following the Separation of Church and State in 1905 they had to leave Antony as they were expelled on 13 June 1908. They had meanwhile built very large buildings which were taken by the Seine Department and became the Paul-Manchon day nursery.

In 1890 the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny bought the buildings of the former royal manufactory of waxes. They installed a nursing home for the sisters returning from the colonies. The main building is now a retreat for the sisters of this congregation.

The &quot;Ladies of Saint Raphael&quot; settled in 1893. Their work was to host single mothers to help ensure their safe child-bearing and also ran a school founded by Father Amédée Ferrand de Missol (1805-1883), a physician who became a priest, friend and companion of Frédéric Ozanam. These religious left Antony in 1972 after creating a similar place in Colombia. The school was closed and the association was taken over by the laity.

===Development in the 20th century===
The first major development in Antony was performed under the guidance of its Senator-Mayor Augustus Mounié: the city went from 4,000 to 20,000 inhabitants. Elected mayor in 1912, he immediately attacked the problem of housing. Nicknamed in the newspaper &quot;Le Père des mal-lotis&quot; (The Father of the poor), he created more than forty associations of the poor to carry out sanitation of housing. He built schools, many roads, and installed street lighting.

In 1940 refugees flocking to the capital to go south. The mayor organised dormitories in schools and sought to supply the refugees by any means and 7,000 Antonians remained on site out of 19,000 inhabitants. Schools were emptied: students and teachers were first sent to Savigny-sur-Braye, then Saumur, and finally Bouille-Loretz. On 14 June 1940 the Germans come into town and used the stadium and the Jules Ferry school as places to hold 8,000 prisoners of war.

Antony was the first city in the Seine department liberated by troops of the 2nd Armoured Division of General Leclerc on 24 August 1944.

The second development was a consequence of the very rapid housing construction in the early 1960s to accommodate the returnees from Algeria. Rapid urbanization led to the construction of small buildings but also low-rise apartments such as &quot;The Grand L&quot; famous for its interior corridors long and a height of 11 floors which was demolished in February 2001. In 20 years, from 1955 to 1975, the population increased from 24,512 to 57,795. During this period, the city built 11 nursery and primary schools, three colleges, a school, a large stadium, five school gyms with a sports centre, a sports park, two leisure centres, a swimming pool, a city hall, and thousands of units of social housing. The new city hall is a modern work by architect Georges Felus and was inaugurated on 19 June 1970.

The 1990s saw the reconstruction of the library in 1990, then in 1996 the fire station and the Conservatory of Music. The 2000s saw the end of the development work undertaken for nearly 40 years in the Croix-de-Berny quarter. This quarter, a strategic crossroads of communication (the A86, A6, A10, and near Orly Airport and RER B), near the &quot;Parc de Sceaux&quot;, was redeveloped to attract businesses and create jobs. It is predicted that 7,000 jobs will be created in this district.

===Heraldry===
The arms of Antony were adopted on 20 June 1919 but have since been simplified. The latest version dates to 1987.

The bridge that was on the river has recently disappeared from the shield, but the motto remains: &quot;parvus ubi pagus fuit Urbem jam alluit unda&quot; meaning: &quot;where there was a village, the river now waters a city&quot;.

The original coat of arms of 1919 are officially blazoned as: &quot;Quarterly, 1 and 4 Azure with three fleurs-de-lis of Or with an escutcheon at Fess-point Sable with three roundels Argent; 2 and 3 quarterly, 1 and 4 Gules with a column Argent, in chief (sewn) Azure a lion passant of Or, 2 and 3 Azure with three bends of Or, in chief (sewn) Azure with a lion issuant of Or; over all in Vert a bridge of Argent masoned and Ajouré in Sable over a river Argent.&quot;.

In summary: the fleurs-de-lis, escutcheons, and roundels are for the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés, the tower evokes the old fortress overlooking the Bièvre ford; the lion is from the arms of Hugues de Lionne, first Marquis of Berny and French Foreign Minister (1663-1671).

==Politics and administration==
Antony is one of the two sub-prefectures of the department of Hauts-de-Seine in the Île-de-France region. The canton of Antony includes only two-thirds of the commune from its southern part, the rest belongs to the Canton of Bourg-la-Reine. The commune of Antony since 1986 has belonged to the thirteenth electoral district of Hauts-de-Seine.

Since 2006 Antony has been one of the communes that uses voting machines.

===Political balance===
Politically, from the early 1980s Antony has been a right-wing town. The current president of the General Council of Hauts-de-Seine and former minister, Patrick Devedjian, won four consecutive terms as mayor in the city of Antony. From 16 October 1983 to 30 May 2002 he ran for municipal elections as a member of the RPR. His successor as mayor, Raymond Sibille, was elected as a UMP mayor as was his successor, Jean-Yves Sénant, who was reelected in 2008.

In the 2005 French European Constitution referendum, Antonians voted overwhelmingly for the European Constitution with 63.60% for &quot;Yes&quot; against 36.40% for &quot;No&quot; with an abstention rate of 24.77% (Whole of France: 54.67% &quot;No&quot;, 45.33% &quot;Yes&quot;).

In the French presidential election of 2007, the first round saw Nicolas Sarkozy with 34.86% or 11,924 votes, followed by Ségolène Royal with 27.53% or 9,418 votes, then François Bayrou with 22.98% or 7,861 votes, and finally Jean-Marie Le Pen with 5.10% or 1,744 votes with no other candidate exceeding the 5% threshold. In the second round, voters voted 52.69% or 17,241 votes for Nicolas Sarkozy against 47.31% or 15,482 votes for Ségolène Royal, a result close to the national average, which was in the second round 53.06% for Nicolas Sarkozy and 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. Turnout was very high in this presidential election. There are 39,327 registered voters on the Antony electoral list and 87.05% or 34,234 voters participated in the voting. The abstention rate was 12.95% or 5,093 votes, 4.41% or 1,511 votes were blank or invalid so in total 95.59% or 32,723 votes were cast.

===Municipal administration===
The Antony municipal council consists of the mayor, 13 deputy mayors, 21 municipal council delegates, and 10 municipal councilors. Thirty-five city seats on the municipal council are filled by the electoral group &quot;Antony for all with Jean-Yves Sénant&quot;. The two opposition groups are &quot;Union for Antony&quot; led by François Rivet and &quot;Antony Plus&quot; led by Magali Buzelin. One municipal councilor was initially elected as a MoDem on the &quot;Antony Plus&quot; ticket and considered by the City Council as an opposition councillor, has sat since late 2008 in an independent group and voted with the municipal majority. The current mayor is also the 1st Vice President of the Aagglomeration Community of Hauts-de-Bièvre responsible for finance. He was Regional Adviser for Île-de-France from 2004 to 2010.

In 2000 the municipality established the Council of Young Citizens (CJC). CJC is composed of thirty students with parity between boys and girls. They are elected by their peers in the three schools in the town: Sainte-Marie, Descartes, and Theodore Monod. Divided into three committees, these young people have a duty to reflect on questions of general interest and to propose actions to the municipality.

The municipality also decided in 2008 to establish a &quot;Council of Seniors&quot; appointed by the mayor on a voluntary basis.

The seats in the municipal council of Antony are allocated as follows:

In the municipal elections of March 2008, the participation rate for the first and only round was low with only 56.98% of voters. Of the 40,770 registered on electoral lists, 23,229 voted and 22,453 voters made valid votes. Jean-Yves Sénant topped the list with &quot;Antony for all Jean-Yves Sénant&quot; and was elected with an absolute majority of 52.09% or 11,696 votes. He was followed by the United list of the left led by Francis Rivet who topped the list &quot;Union for Antony&quot;, who collected 29.39% of the vote or 6,599 votes. The centre-left list &quot;Antony Plus with you&quot;, with its leader Jean-François Homassel, ranked third with 18.52% of the collected votes or 4,158 votes.

===Judicial and administrative jurisdiction===
Antony is the seat of a District Court. The cantons under the court&#x27;s jurisdiction are the cantons of Antony, Bagneux, Bourg-la-Reine, Châtenay-Malabry, Fontenay-aux-Roses, Le Plessis-Robinson, Montrouge, and Sceaux.

Antony is also the seat of a Police Court.

Both courts are located in a building that was built in 1872 to accommodate the first school for boys. In 1927 the building was transformed into a city hall until the construction of the new city hall in 1970.

Antony reports to the &quot;Tribunal de Grande Instance&quot; of Nanterre, the Court of Appeal of Versailles, the Juvenile court of Nanterre, the &quot;Conseil de prud&#x27;hommes&quot; (labour court) in Boulogne-Billancourt, the Commercial Court of Nanterre, the Administrative Tribunal in Cergy-Pontoise, and the Administrative Court of Appeal of Versailles.

===Environmental policy===
For a long time Antony has sought to capitalize on its many green spaces. With the help of the Agglomeration Community of Hauts-de-Bièvre visits have been to different sites to discover their remarkable natural resources. The catchment area of the Bièvre has been classified as a &quot;natural ecological, fauna and flora zone&quot; since 1984 by the Ministry of the Environment. This area is a high quality wetland of regional interest—the most remarkable in the Hauts-de-Seine department. In 1992, an ornithological observatory was established at the city&#x27;s initiative on this site. 132 different species of birds have been observed between 1977 and 1993 including very rare species in Île-de-France. The entire valley to the Parc de Sceaux is registered in the inventory of natural areas of flora and fauna of ecological interest.

A process of planting large trees was initiated in 2008. These trees, high and 25 years old, are planted in particular locations with the aim of them becoming remarkable trees in the third millennium. These iconic trees mark the landscape and serve as landmarks for urban planning.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Antony maintains close ties with many foreign cities. It was on 18 February 1985 that the first French city to sign a twinning agreement with the Afghan resistance against the Soviet invasion during the war in Afghanistan (1979-1989) was signed. It united Antony with Paghman, a district on the outskirts of Kabul but has not been pursued with the new authorities. The René Descartes School of Antony organizes annual exchanges between Antony and its two twin towns: Lexington in the United States and Reinickendorf in Germany.

Antony is twinned with:

* Antelias, Lebanon (2018)
* Collegno, Italy (1961)
* Davtashen (Yerevan), Armenia (2015)
* Eleftheroupoli, Greece (2000)
* Hammam-Lif, Tunisia (1969)
* Lewisham, England, United Kingdom (1967)
* Lexington, United States (1990)
* Olomouc, Czech Republic (1995)
* Protvino, Russia
* Reinickendorf (Berlin), Germany (1966)
* Sderot, Israel (1984)
==Demography==

The main areas of activity and research present in Antony are:
*The Cemagref or Research Institute for Agricultural Engineering and the Environment (originally the National Centre of Agricultural Machinery, Rural Engineering, Water and Forestry) was created in Paris in 1944 and moved to Antony in 1956. Since then, many centres have been established in the provinces. The centre in Antony particularly specialises in water quality.
*The Sanofi company, previously Sanofi-Aventis, created a research centre devoted to chemistry at Antony in 1952. This centre was established on an area of 6 hectares which was occupied by vegetable crops near the Croix de Berny. This centre was completely renovated between 1984 and 1988 on the plans of architects A. Chamussi and Alexandre Chemetoff. In September 2011 the group announced the regrouping, planned for 2014, of its commercial activities onto three sites (Paris, Massy, and Gentilly) which would imply the closure of the Antony site.
*&quot;Antonypole&quot; is a business park consisting of an old industrial area built in the south of the city in 1970 and a former high-tech park built in 1980. In 2008, this business park included large institutions in the areas of health, research, and precision electronics, such as: Dräger Medical, Essilor, Siemens, Stallergenes, Air Liquide Medical Systems, Vannier Photolec etc. Priority is given today to the installation of high value-added businesses wishing to settle in the south of Paris.
*The crossroads of Croix de Berny where several companies settled in 2008 includes the headquarters of the Pomona company and Chronopost. Verisure set up its headquarters here in 2020.

Antony market dates back to François I who, in 1545, instituted weekly fairs on Thursdays in Antony. It was moved from the footpaths on Rue Mounié to the Firmin Gémier Square and settled on the site of the city centre in 1957. This is one of the two most important markets in the south of Paris. The grand hall was completely rebuilt between 2003 and 2006.

==Facilities==

===Education===
Antony is in the Academy of Versailles.

====Schools====
The city administers 15 kindergartens and 13 communal elementary schools serving approximately 5,300 children and whose names come from districts (La Fontaine, Les Rabats, Noyer-Doré, Val-de-Bièvre) or illustrious men (Paul Bert, Edmond Blanguernon, Ferdinand Buisson, André Chénier, André Dunoyer de Segonzac, Jules Ferry, Anatole France, Jean Moulin, Adolphe Pajeaud, André Pasquier, Alfred Velpeau, and Jean Zay). The department manages five colleges and the Île-de-France region two schools. The Anne Frank College building, built in 1978–1980, is a very original building, the result of &quot;politics of models&quot;: the municipality had to choose one of the models the Ministry proposed and asked two architects (Jean Nouvel and Gilbert Lézenès) to adapt the model according to their creative inspiration and constraints of the terrain.

Antony also three private schools: the &quot;Ozar Hatorah Jewish School&quot;, the &quot;New School of Antony&quot; whose teaching methods rely on the contributions of active methods of teaching by project and institutional teaching, and the &quot;Institution Sainte-Marie of Antony&quot; which is a Catholic private school under contract of association with the State and run by the Marianists that has had 3,200 students for several years, making it France&#x27;s largest private institution.

====Higher Education====
Antony is the seat of the &quot;Arc en Ciel - Jean Trubert&quot; School, a private higher technical school specializing in training in illustration and comics. &quot;Arc en Ciel - Jean Trubert&quot; School initiated the creation of the diploma course &quot;Certification of cartoonist and illustrator&quot; which is registered at the &quot;Répertoire national des certifications professionnelles&quot; (NCPR). This diploma recognized by the State for Level III sanctioned training of two or three years.

Two &quot;Institut Universitaire de Formation des Maîtres&quot; have been established in Antony: the IUFM Val-de-Bièvre and the IUFM Léon Jouhaux. All disciplines for teaching at professional schools are prepared on the training site of IUFM of Antony Jouhaux. Moreover, thanks to its hotel and restaurant-supply department, it prepares courses and teaching for jobs in hotels.

The IUFM Val de Bièvre, meanwhile, was closed down in September 2011, only the COSOM (group of gyms) is still active.

Antony is known for its Jean-Zay university residence whose existence is regularly questioned: Patrick Devedjian, the mayor of Antony for 20 years, saw it as a &quot;cyst&quot;.

Planned in 1945 its construction was decided on in 1952. With 2,500 rooms, it is one of Europe&#x27;s largest student housing complexes. Open to the students from 1 December 1955, it initially offered 1,580 individual rooms (including 1,040 rooms for boys and 540 rooms for girls), 490 apartments for couples, and many common areas (a library, an auditorium, a sports complex, workrooms). The buildings are spread over ten acres between the town centre and Sceaux Park. From the outset the residence welcomed students from around the world. At the height of its activity, it had three kindergartens, a school, a supermarket, and 50 different nationalities. The new sub-prefecture buildings were constructed in 1989 partly on the grounds of the residence after the demolition of one of its main buildings. The new local plan adopted in 2008 creates a &quot;placeholder&quot; in the hands of the RUA to create an avenue between the city centre and the Parc de Sceaux: achieving this project would result in the demolition of at least one building of the Residence. This project is very controversial because of the shortage of student accommodation in Île-de-France. In 2008, the Minister for Universities and President of the General Council of Hauts-de-Seine considered the &quot;transfer&quot; of the RUA, which the student union strongly opposed. In 2009, the property of the RUA was transferred to the Agglomeration Community of Hauts-de-Bièvre. In 2010, the buildings were demolished. In 2011, the municipality of Antony and the Agglomeration of Hauts-de-Bièvre presented a plan to reorganise the right-of-way by Jean Nouvel.

===Health===
Antony has some of the best healthcare in Île-de-France: both in number of general practitioners (2nd in the region with 1.52 physicians to 1,000 inhabitants) and specialists (3rd in the region with 2.19 for 1,000 inhabitants).

Antony has a modern private hospital built in 2002. It brings together a range of services over an area of 30,000 m2 and provides (as at 1 April 2010) a capacity of 417 beds which makes it the largest private hospital in Île-de-France. This hospital resulted from the successive mergers of clinics in the area:
*the &quot;House of Health of Antony&quot;
*the &quot;Clinic of Fresnes&quot;
*the &quot;Clinic of la Providence&quot; in Antony
*the &quot;Clinique Ambroise-Pare&quot; in Bourg-la-Reine
*the &quot;Clinic of Millers&quot; in Bagneux
*the &quot;Clinic of the Parc&quot; in Bourg-la-Reine
*the &quot;Clinic of the Bois de Verrières&quot; in Antony
*the &quot;Clinic of Hauts-de-Seine&quot;
*the &quot;Maternity Clinic of Valleys&quot; in Chatenay-Malabry

The new hospital opened on 28 November 2002 and was inaugurated on 14 May 2003 by Jean-François Mattei, Minister of Health, and Patrick Devedjian, Minister for Local Liberties. It employs 740 staff and 250 private doctors in 30 specialities.

Antony also has the &quot;Erasmus&quot; public health facility. This psycho-therapeutic hospital is built in a 5.5-hectare park and opened its doors on 17 May 1982 in new premises. Since 1993 it has included 21 associated institutions from Île-de-France. This hospital specializes in the treatment of mental disorders in all ages. It aims primarily to accommodate the residents from the centre and south of the Hauts-de-Seine department. The tasks assigned to it are varied: prevention, diagnosis, care, teaching, and research. It employs 600 staff.

Besides these two hospitals Antony has two specialised educational institutions: The &quot;Elizabeth Centre of Panouse-Debré&quot; (motor rehabilitation for very young children with physical disabilities) and the &quot;Psychotherapeutic Specialised Teaching Centre&quot; for children with serious mental disorders. There are also several specialised institutions such as the &quot;Alcoholic Cure Centre&quot; (alcohol and tobacco).

===Sports===
Numerous sports associations are grouped under the Antony Sports Council. There are 40 disciplines in 40 halls and stadiums with the main venues being:

*&quot;Heller Park&quot;
*the &quot;Velpeau stadium&quot;
*the &quot;Lionel Terray sports centre&quot;

The &quot;Antony Sports Rugby&quot; club plays in Fédérale 3.

The &quot;Antony Sport Football Association&quot;, founded in 1948, is an official partner of the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and plays in the regional football league (DSR).
In 1928 at the sports complex called &quot;Stadium of the croix de Berny&quot; or &quot;Sports Union Metropolitan&quot;: Gaston Vrolix, chief engineer of the RATP, created the Metropolitan Sports Union (currently USMT). He built a sports complex on the site of part of the former racetrack at La Croix de Berny where he transformed stables into locker rooms. The first phase was started in 1928 along the RN186 and included: football, rugby, hockey, basketball, tennis, a swimming pool, playground, gym, and a shooting range. The second phase was built around 1932 to the north: rugby pitches, tennis courts, and an athletic stadium. The third phase included a fronton for basque pelota and a velodrome was built in 1938 by a Dutch architect (a replica in concrete of the wooden Vigorelli track in Milan). This velodrome had to be rebuilt to accommodate cycling events in case the city of Paris was chosen for the 1992 Summer Olympics. The new local plan, adopted in 2008, includes the construction in a portion of this site of office buildings to finance the rehabilitation of all sports facilities of the USMT. The rugby team Racing Métro 92 was born from the collaboration of the Racing Club de France and the U.S. METRO which played its matches in the Top 14 in Colombes and trained at the Croix de Berny for several years before recently joining Le Plessis-Robinson.

The Tour de France passed through the streets of Antony in July 1999, July 2007, and in 2010. It was a &quot;stage-town&quot; for the beginning of the 20th stage of the Tour in 2006.

===Media===
Besides the traditional &quot;paper&quot; version, since October 2006 the city has published the magazine in an audio version (on CD) for the blind or visually impaired.

A wired network distributing radio broadcasting services and television has covered the city since 1988. Following the advent of digital terrestrial television, the CSA has chosen channels to broadcast via TNT-Île-de-France: channel 21 sharing Demain IDF, BDM TV, Cinaps TV, Télé Bocal; channel 22 IDF1; channel 23 NRJ Paris (ex-LTF); and channel 24 Cap 24 (ex-Côté Seine). Since 24 September 2007 the commune can also receive through TNT the Group France Télévisions chain: France Ô, available on channel 20.
In October 2007 Antony communes established a Wi-Fi network: internet terminals are accessible to all and allow free connection in various public places.

Antony has several local newspapers. The weekly newspaper &quot;Antony-Hebdo&quot; is the newspaper of the municipal opposition led by André Aubry, a former senator for Hauts-de-Seine and former PCF mayor of Antony. This newspaper is allowed to publish judicial and legal notices in the Arrondissement of Antony.

The periodical &quot;Présence&quot; (Journal of Catholic communities of Antony) is distributed three times a year in all mailboxes. One of the groups of the municipal opposition &quot;Antony Plus&quot; publishes &quot;Antony Public Place&quot; (formerly: &quot;Agora&quot;).

==Sites and monuments==
A large number of buildings and sites are registered as historical monuments. Below are some of the highlights of the heritage of Antony.

===Civil Heritage===
The former Royal Manufactory of Waxes (1714) whose exact name was &quot;Manufacture d&#x27;Antony pour le blanchissage des cires &amp; la fabrique des bougies&quot; (Manufacture of Antony for laundering of waxes &amp; candle factory) is located at 14 Avenue du Bois-de-Verrières. The factory was founded in 1702 by &quot;Péan de Saint-Gilles&quot; and it became a royal factory in 1719. Its motto was &quot;Deo, regique laborant&quot; meaning &quot;they (the drones) work for God and the King. The original building was built in 1714 where wax and tallow candles were produced for the Court of Versailles and other castles in the area. The enterprise left Antony for Bourg-la-Reine and still exists under the name of &quot;Cire Trudon&quot;. The building is now occupied by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny who settled there in 1890. The factory was built on this site to use the high quality water from the rivers which allowed candles to be produced with an exceptional whiteness.
The Maison Saint-Jean (House of Saint John) (1806) is a former &quot;Chénier property&quot; called &quot;La Belle Levantine&quot;. This building was built by Louis-Sauveur Chénier, the youngest son of Louis Chénier, and brother of André Chénier from plans by architect Georges Auguste Ranchon. In 1820 the house was purchased by Jean-Charles Persil, a Minister under Louis-Philippe, who died in 1870. In 1880, it became the property of four Parisian priests who, in 1898, built a building of brick and stone to serve as a Marianist seminary. After the expulsion of the Marianists the building was transformed into a guesthouse. The property was bought by the Marianists in 1965 to build the buildings for the &quot;Institution Sainte-Marie d&#x27;Antony&quot;.

===Religious Heritage===
Religious architectural heritage is rich in Antony from a historical perspective with the Church of Saint-Saturnin having the oldest parts in Île-de-France dating from the Carolingian period through to churches with modern architecture.

The Church of Saint-Saturnin is &quot;Located in an attractive square planted with linden trees on the site of the old cemetery, the church of Saint-Saturnin has a triple interest: historical, archaeological and artistic&quot;. Inside, in addition to the wash stand from the Carolingian period, there are stained glass windows from the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The choir is from the end of the 12th century, the bell tower from the 14th, the nave from the 15th century, and the south chapel is modern. The belfry supports four bells: the oldest, Charlotte Genevieve, from 1730. This monument has been undergoing major renovations in recent years. The rectory, on the church square, was restored in 1989. This church has been classified as a historical monument since 19 October 1928. In the &quot;Holy Mary Mother of the Church&quot; chapel of the &quot;Institution Sainte-Marie d&#x27;Antony&quot;, built in 1968 to plans by architects &quot;Georges Dengler&quot; and &quot;Zunz&quot;, there is a very large openwork brick wall - the work of master glassmaker &quot;Henri Martin-Granel&quot; and also a large ceramic mural 41 m2 in area, the work of &quot;Jacqueline Bechet-Ferber&quot;. The church contains a large number of items that are registered as historical objects.

The Church of Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal has a main building from the Colonial Exhibition of 1931. So that it would not be confused with the church of Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal in Paris, the qualifier &quot;hors-le-murs&quot; (Outside the Walls) was added to clarify that it was not within the walls of Paris. This building was renovated in 1954.

The Church of Saint-Jean-Porte-Latine (1967) was built between 1964 and 1967 on the plans of architects &quot;Pierre Pinsard&quot; and &quot;Hugo Vollmar&quot;. The church was consecrated to Catholic worship on 21 May 1967. It is dedicated to Saint Jean-Porte-latine, patron saint of the publishing industry. The &quot;Urban signal&quot;, surmounted by a giant cross, was inaugurated on 6 January 2002.

The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi was built in 1972 on the plans of architect Paul Henry by the &quot;Œuvre des Chantiers du Cardinal&quot; (Construction work of the Cardinal. It was dedicated to the Catholic faith on 7 October 1972 by Monseigneur Jacques Delarue, Bishop of Nanterre.

The Church of Saint-Maxime was built from 1978 to 1980 by the &quot;Œuvre des Chantiers du Cardinal&quot;. It is also designed by the architect Paul Henry and was dedicated to the Catholic faith on 16 November 1980 by Monseigneur Jacques Delarue. It contains a large Statue of Saint Maxime (1939) which is registered as an historical object.

The Church of Sainte-Odile (1933) was built under the direction of architect Charles Venner by the &quot;Œuvre des Chantiers du Cardinal&quot;. There is a Bas-relief of Saint Odile (1933) which is registered as an historical object.

The Evangelical Baptist Church, of modern architecture with large windows, has been completely rebuilt under the development project of the Croix de Berny and inaugurated in March 2001.

===Environmental heritage===
The policy of protecting and enhancing the environment makes Antony one of the greenest communes in Île-de-France: besides the Parc de Sceaux, there are 750,000 m2 of parks, woods, and leafy lanes. Antony has been labelled a &quot;flowery city&quot; with two flowers awarded since 2002 by the &quot;National Council of flowered towns and villages of France&quot; in the competition for cities and villages in bloom. The land in the region is particularly well suited for Wisteria which covers the houses in spring, as well as roses as in the names of the nearby communes of Fontenay-aux-Roses and L&#x27;Haÿ-les-Roses. Antony has several parks - the largest of which are:
*Parc de Sceaux (about 180 hectares of which 60 hectares are in the commune of Antony)
*Heller Park (9.6 ha)
*Raymond Sibille Park (1.4 ha)
*Bourdeau Park (1.2 ha)
*the green slopes of Godets (2.66 ha) and Paradis (2.2 ha)
*the green slopes of TGV (7 ha)
*Bois de Aurora (2.6 ha)

These parks are planted with trees &quot;remarkable&quot; for their size, age, history, botanical rarity, or which are particularly elegant or picturesque. The city is planted with over 50 different species. Inside Heller Park is the &quot;Antony Farm&quot; which allows children to play with pigs, cows, goats, and sheep as well as chickens, geese, and rabbits. It is managed by the pony club.

===Cultural heritage===


At the beginning of the 20th century Antony had three cinemas including:
*the Family Palace (2 rue de Fresnes), built in 1922, operated until 1981
*L&#x27;Artistic, built in 1928, municipalized in 1981 and renamed &quot;Le Sélect Louis-Daquin&quot; and classed as an &quot;Art et Essai&quot; cinema
*the Ciné du Soleil-Levant (Cinema of the Rising Sun) (6 Rue du Soleil-Levant), built in 1930, renamed &quot;L&#x27;Eden&quot; in 1948, operated until the 1970s.

Until the summer of 2011 the only remaining cinema was Le Sélect. In view of its growing attendance, 49,000 in 1983, 100,000 in 1995, in 1995 the city studied the replacement of the cinema hall with a set of four halls on the same site. Local associations wished to maintain an ambitious and quality program. The principle to rebuild the cinema was adopted by the City Council in April 1997 but, given the technical difficulties related to the environment, the project has not yet been completed. On 28 January 2008 the cinema was honoured by the profession when Christine Beauchemin-Flot, its director, received the trophy for the Operator of the Year. This trophy is awarded every year by &quot;Le Film français&quot;, a weekly reference publication in the profession.

Scenes from the film &quot;Né de père inconnu&quot; (Born from an unknown father) by Maurice Cloche (1950) were shot in the Paul Manchon day nursery (demolished in the early 2000s).

In July 2011 &quot;Le Select&quot; closed for the beginning of construction of the new multiplex. Restarting of shows was planned for November of that year at the Firmin-Gémier Theatre but, on 29 September, the mayor announced to council that the auditorium was contaminated with asbestos and could not accommodate any film screenings, performances, or performing arts. Antony found itself without any major cultural venues until the construction of the new theatre and cinema was completed in 2013.

On 10 June 2012 a short-lived cinema opened in the Pajeaud quarter between the COSOM gymnasium and the Iris pool near Heller Park. In an innovative concept, this temporary cinema of 205 seats will be dismantled when the town centre theatre opens.

The current public library, built in 1990, has a large Braille workshop, one of the few in France to offer a large selection of books free of charge to the blind. In 1995 the city was also equipped with a new bookmobile which can carry 2,500 books. The bookmobile serves eleven stops in all quarters of Antony.

Antony has a conservatory (dependent on the Agglomeration Community of Hauts-de-Bièvre), approved by the Darius Milhaud State Conservatory, that every year has more than 1,250 students supervised by a teaching faculty of more than 70 teachers. Its main mission is to discover, appreciate, and learn music, dance, and drama as part of courses of study in different departments. The conservatory was opened on 7 December 1996. Tributes were paid to Darius Milhaud, the &quot;godfather&quot; of the temple of music as well as Paul Arma, a famous composer who lived in Antony and who the auditorium is named after.

In 1967 Georges Suant, a theatre with 500 seats, and the Firmin-Gémier theatre, were installed in the hall built in 1930 on the &quot;Place du Marché&quot; after making some improvements including the provision of seats in the gods. The first director was &quot;Jacques Sarthou&quot;, then the director of the &quot;Théâtre de l&#x27;Île-de-France&quot;. Often referred to as the spiritual son of &quot;Firmin Gémier&quot;, given his similar experience in a traveling theatre, he hoped that this new theatre would take his name. Several very creative directors were then appointed to the theatre: &quot;Jean Rougerie&quot; appointed in 1972, &quot;Pierrette Garreau&quot; and &quot;Marc Ansel&quot; in 1979, &quot;Gérard Savoisien&quot; in 1984, &quot;René Chéneaux&quot; in 1991, &quot;François Kergourlay&quot; in 1995, and &quot;Marc Jeancourt&quot; in 2000. All these directors brought to Antony a cultural life that has quickly found a loyal following. In 2003 a &quot;circus space&quot;, national stage, was created where the Big Tops of &quot;new circuses&quot; performed regularly. A &quot;Scène conventionnée&quot;, as part of the Agglomeration Community of Hauts-de-Bièvre, the Firmin Gémier theatre was associated in 2007 with the &quot;Théâtre La Piscine&quot; of Chatenay-Malabry. The Spartan character and the inconvenient nature of infrastructure contrasted with the wealth of programming. In September 2011, following the discovery of asbestos in the premises, the theatre closed quickly and permanently. The construction of a new hall is planned near the municipal library.

Located in the Bourdeau Park, the &quot;Maison des Arts&quot; has free entrance and is dedicated to exhibitions with artistic programming, introductory workshops, and awareness for children.

===Suburban Quarters===
Much of Antony consists of suburban districts. These homes were mostly built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries shortly after the arrival of the Arpajonnais railway that transformed a self-sufficient agricultural village into a small market garden town then a residential town. Among these new houses, the houses on the Avenue Gabriel Peri were especially typical of the Art Nouveau style dating from 1890 to 1895. The subdivision of &quot;New Antony&quot; was designed by the architect Anatole de Baudot (who had already designed the Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux). Despite the new demographic development in the 1950s, Antony has so far maintained a largely suburban character. In the late 2000s the urban planning policy vis-à-vis this heritage became a significant issue. In June 2009 the city began to demolish houses on the Boulevard Pierre-Brossolette then published in October 2009 a plan for alignment of the Avenue Gabriel-Peri that should eventually lead to the demolition of other houses. These urbanisation operations have been challenged by residents and local associations.

===Cultural events and festivities===
In addition to the performances at the Firmin-Gémier theatre in the Chénier Grand Hall of the Institution Sainte-Marie notably by the Orchestre national d&#x27;Île-de-France (National Orchestra of Île-de-France) there are also regular concerts in the Auditorium of the Conservatory and at temporary exhibitions where many events are organized.

The main cultural events and festivities in the city of Antony are:
*February: the Antiques fair held since 1987

**the Village of nature and garden
*June:
**the Solstice Festival: Since 2001 oriented towards circus arts and the street, the principle of this festival, organized with the town of Chatenay-Malabry, is to transform the two cities into a giant theatre.
**Bubbles in the City: this day devoted to comics is the occasion of meetings with writers and designers, young talent show, and outdoor screenings.
*July and August:
**the International Handicapped Tennis Tournament: the first handicapped tennis tournament organized in Europe every year since 1986, it brings together the best male and female players of the NEC Wheelchair Tennis Tour.
*September:
**the Wine and Cheese Fair since 1987. This fair lasts three days and brings together 200 exhibitors from all parts of France in the Saint-Saturnin quarter with a wealth of local French cheeses and wines as well as meats, foie gras, and sweets. This major event of the season receives over 100,000 visitors.

**the Carousel of Art, an open-air gallery where Antonians exhibit their works of any nature whatsoever.
*October:

<doc id="1158836" wikidata="Q1036094" url="?curid=1158836" title="Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi">
<text>Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi is an American animated series created by Sam Register and produced by Renegade Animation and Cartoon Network Studios, which aired on Cartoon Network from 2004 to 2006. The series stars fictionalized and animated versions of the Japanese pop rock group Puffy AmiYumi. The series premiered on November 19, 2004, and ended on June 27, 2006, with a total of three seasons and 39 episodes.

During its short-lived run, the series was nominated for an Annie Award three times. Merchandise based on the series has also been produced, such as video games, home media releases, toys, and clothing.

== Premise ==

&quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; follows the adventures of two best friends: the peppy, optimistic, cheerful, girly girl Ami Onuki (voiced by Janice Kawaye); and the cynical, sarcastic, grumpy tomboy Yumi Yoshimura (voiced by Grey DeLisle). Both are based on the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi, but with different appearances and exaggerated personalities. They travel around the world on their customized tour bus along with their well-intentioned yet greedy manager Kaz Harada (voiced by Keone Young). From rocking out at a concert to hanging out in their hometown of Tokyo, the duo take the world by storm with their musical talent, trend-setting style, and humor, dishing out lessons in J-pop justice and establishing the international language of &quot;cool&quot; along the way.

Secondary characters include: Jang-Keng (voiced by Grey DeLisle) and Tekirai (voiced by Janice Kawaye), the duo&#x27;s pet cats who enjoy tormenting Kaz; Harmony (voiced by Sandy Fox), a six-year-old girl who is the self-proclaimed &quot;Number One Fan&quot; of Puffy AmiYumi and (later) Kaz and constantly stalks them; Eldwin Blair (voiced by Nathan Carlson), a sinister land developer who tries to tear down beloved places for his own selfish needs; the evil Talent Suckers (voiced by Nathan Carlson and Corey Burton), a vampire rock trio from Transylvania; and Atchan (voiced by Rob Paulsen), a caricature of Atsushi (lead singer of the punk band New Rote&#x27;ka) who speaks in third-person and thinks he is a superhero.

The animated Puffy AmiYumi travel all over the world in their tour bus. While appearing the same size as a regular bus on the outside, it appears to have enough internal space to house the girls&#x27; rooms (including full-sized beds), Kaz&#x27;s room, their equipment, televisions, and computers, among other things. In the episode &quot;Domo&quot;, Kaz refers to an upstairs area. It also seems capable of running on autopilot, as Kaz, Ami, and Yumi are sometimes sitting in the rear cabin of the bus while traveling. Occasionally, the rear door has been opened to receive packages delivered by a boy on a scooter.

During the first season, the show included live-action clips of the real Ami and Yumi making childish commentary (in English and non-subtitled Japanese) at the beginning and end of each episode. They only performed short clips at the beginning of the show during the second and third seasons. Starting with the second season, the duo was sometimes shown holding title cards introducing the cartoon segments. At the end of the episode &quot;Sitcomi Yumi&quot;, Ami and Yumi watched television and saw the animated Kaz with the real Ami and Yumi. All of the live-action clips were produced by Freegate, Ltd.

The real PUFFY performs the cartoon&#x27;s theme song (which is also in Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese in the respective countries), and many episodes feature one or more of the duo&#x27;s songs playing in the background, along with music by Andy Sturmer.

Though the characters speak English, the script intersperses their vernacular with Japanese speech, especially when the characters react to events that they find to be surprising. Calling out &quot;Tasukete!&quot; instead of &quot;Help!&quot; is commonly used.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

According to Register, the target audience of the show is children from 6 to 11 years old. However, it also has a cult following of teen and adult fans of the real-life Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura who make up the Japanese pop duo Puffy AmiYumi. Register, who was a fan of the band, wished to spread its fame to other parts of the world and thus created the series.

The series features the adventures of animated versions of the duo, who have been immensely popular in Japan since making their debut, and is the second television show to be based on the band after &quot;Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Puffy&quot;, which aired in Japan from 1997 to 2002. The group now has its own U.S. albums, including a 2004 companion album to this program, and was known to viewers of Cartoon Network in the U.S. for performing the theme to the &quot;Teen Titans&quot; animated series. During production of the series, DeLisle learned some Japanese from Kawaye and Young, both of whom speak the language fluently.

The cartoon was one of the few cartoons at the time produced entirely in the United States, with a number of characters designed by famed Canadian artist Lynne Naylor, who also designed characters for other Cartoon Network shows, including &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, &quot;Foster&#x27;s Home for Imaginary Friends&quot;, and &quot;The Powerpuff Girls&quot;, which got the show nominated for the coveted Annie Award. The pilot used a combination of Macromedia Flash and traditional cel animation. Each program was 30 minutes long (with commercials) and featured three seven-minute segments. The visual style of the show is anime-influenced. 

The show takes inspiration from various works animated in Japan, such as &quot;Pokémon&quot;, &quot;Digimon&quot;, the Sunbow Productions animated series based on Hasbro properties, the Walt Disney Animation Japan animated production, the Marvel Productions animated series, the Studio Ghibli animated production, and the Rankin/Bass animated series. Other inspirations included old MGM and Warner Bros. cartoons, as well as Hanna-Barbera and Mirisch/UA cartoons, UPA shorts, and the works of Jay Ward. Some of the show&#x27;s crew members included various writers from Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;CatDog&quot;, including Steven Banks, Kit Boyce, and Robert Lamoreaux. 

Sam Register originally pitched the idea of Puffy AmiYumi having their own television series on Cartoon Network, and afterwards, Renegade Animation developed a test short on April 22, 2003, in hopes of making the channel greenlight the show&#x27;s production. Renegade Animation originally, at first, created other Cartoon Network pilots before &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot;; two of which feature &quot;Captain Sturdy&quot;; one in 2001, entitled &quot;Back in Action&quot;, and the other in 2003, entitled &quot;The Originals&quot;, but they were ultimately rejected, and Renegade Animation then started working on &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; starting with its pilot on April 22, 2003. The pilot was not broadcast, but was initially successful, and got the green-light from Cartoon Network. Finally, it was shown in non-full version as a preview on Cartoon Network DVDs and VHS tapes. The entire pilot was found by series&#x27; director, Darrell Van Citters, and was uploaded to Vimeo on April 5, 2018. The series was officially announced at Cartoon Network&#x27;s upfront on February 26, 2004. It was originally planned to premiere in December 2004, but was later moved up to November 19.

=== Cancellation ===
On October 2, 2006, the show&#x27;s crew announced on their blog that Cartoon Network had cancelled &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; after three seasons and 39 episodes due to management shakeup, leading Sam Register to leave the channel, until Register officially became the president of Cartoon Network Studios on August 28, 2020.

== Appearances in other media ==

The show had been acknowledged and referenced several times, even outside of Cartoon Network themselves. These also come in the form of parodies, albeit rare.
* A clip of the episode, &quot;AmiYumi 3000&quot;, can be seen playing on TV in the film &quot;Nancy Drew&quot;.
* In 2012, Ami and Yumi appeared on Cartoon Network&#x27;s 20th anniversary poster.
* Yumi later made a cameo appearance in the &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot; special &quot;Crossover Nexus&quot;.
* Ami and Yumi made a background appearance, within their poster in a TV pilot for &quot;Villainous&quot;.
* Ami&#x27;s haircut appeared as a wardrobe item in the 2020 mobile game, &quot;KleptoCats: Cartoon Network&quot;.
* Parodies of Ami and Yumi, named Ori and Yori, show up in the Nickelodeon series &quot;Kappa Mikey&quot;.

&quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; premiered in the United States on Cartoon Network on November 19, 2004. After ending on June 27, 2006, the show continued to rerun until September 3, 2006, where it aired in reruns and occasionally as one of the few non-Cartoon Cartoons to air in reruns on &quot;The Cartoon Cartoon Show&quot; before being removed from the network&#x27;s schedule.

Since Cartoon Network is available worldwide, the show has been dubbed into multiple languages and aired on Cartoon Network worldwide. In Canada, the series premiered on YTV on September 5, 2005. In Japan, the show began airing on Cartoon Network in English with Japanese subtitles in 2005. A dubbed version began airing on TV Tokyo&#x27;s Oha Suta block on October 6, 2005, and started to air on January 8, 2006, on Cartoon Network Japan.

In Germany, the show aired on Cartoon Network Germany with all episodes. It premiered in 2005 on the Cartoon Network&#x27;s block of Kabel eins. The show stopped airing there after two seasons in 2006. The reason was that Cartoon Network Germany launched and most of the shows moved there.

In Poland, the show aired on Cartoon Network Poland from 2005 to 2006.

In Australia, the show premiered on April 3, 2005. It stopped airing on Cartoon Network Australia in November 2008. The third season was never shown there. From August to November 2009, the Australian channel 9Go! showed the last season instead and was abandoned in January 2010.

As of December 2023, the show airs on Tooncast at 2:30am and 2:30pm respectively.

While the show has had a limited release on DVD in America, the entire series was released on HBO Max in the Latin America area. The release includes both the Spanish and original English tracks.

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the show is &quot;modern, in its retro, Asian-tinged way -- in other words, right in line with the Cartoon Network aesthetic -- but nothing new&quot;, and called it &quot;bright and loud and sensational&quot;.

=== Ratings ===
&quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi&quot; debuted on Cartoon Network on November 19, 2004, at 7:30 PM ET/PT with two half-hour episodes. The show charted double-digit increases with Girls 6–11 in ratings and delivery for Cartoon Network&#x27;s Fridays programming block. During the following week, the show became the network&#x27;s top-rated hit for kids 6–11. It also increased Cartoon Network&#x27;s audience among that age group by 49% over the previous year.

=== Awards and nominations ===
The series has been nominated three times for the Annie Award.

<text>Sverre Fehn (14 August 1924 – 23 February 2009) was a Norwegian architect.

==Life==
Fehn was born at Kongsberg in Buskerud, Norway. He was the son of John Tryggve Fehn (1894–1981) and Sigrid Johnsen (1895–1985).
He received his architectural education at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design in Oslo. He entered his course of study in 1946 and graduated during 1949. Among other instructors, he studied under Arne Korsmo (1900–1968).

In 1949, Fehn and architect Geir Grung (1926–1989) won the competition for the Museum Building for the Sandvig Collections at Maihaugen in Lillehammer.
In 1950, Fehn joined PAGON (Progressive Architects Group Oslo, Norway). The group, which was led by Arne Korsmo, had the goal of implementing and promoting modern architecture.

In 1952–1953, during travels in Morocco, he discovered vernacular architecture
, which was to deeply influence his future work. Later he moved to Paris, where he worked for two years in the studio of Jean Prouvé, and where he knew Le Corbusier. On his return to Norway in 1954, he opened a studio of his own in Oslo. 
At the age of 34, Fehn gained international recognition for his design of the Norwegian Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition. In the 1960s he produced two works that have remained highlights in his career: the Nordic Pavilion at the Venice Biennale (1962) and the Hedmark Museum in Hamar (1967–79). Other notable works include the Norwegian Glacier Museum at Fjærland (1991-2002) and the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo (2003–08).
He was a professor at Oslo&#x27;s School of Architecture from 1971 to 1995 and principal from 1986–1989. 
He additionally lectured throughout Europe including at Paris, Stuttgart and Barcelona. He also lectured in the United States at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, Cooper Union in New York City and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. 
==Projects==
Fehn designed over 100 buildings; Some of the most notable are:
*1958 – Norwegian Pavilion at the Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, Belgium
*1962 – Nordic Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Italy
*1963 – Villa Schreiner, Oslo
*1963-64 – Villa Norrköping, Sweden
*1967 – Casa Bødtker House, Oslo
*1967-79 – Hamarhus at Hedmark Museum in Hamar, Norway
*1990 – Villa Busk, Bamble
*1991-2002 – Norwegian Glacier Museum, Fjærland
*1993-96 – Aukrust Centre in Alvdal
*2000 – Ivar Aasen-tunet in Ørsta
*2007 – Gyldendal House, Oslo
*2003-08 – National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design, Oslo

==Awards==
In 1961, he was awarded the Houen Foundation Award, jointly with Geir Grung, for the design of the Økern Nursing Home in Oslo. He received the Houen Foundation Award for his design of the Hedmark Museum at Hamar in 1975. In 1994 he was appointed Commander in the Order of St. Olav.
In 1998, he was awarded the Norsk kulturråds ærespris.
Sverre Fehn was awarded the first Grosch medal in 2001. 
In 2003, he was awarded the Anders Jahre Cultural Prize (&quot;Anders Jahres kulturpris&quot;).

His highest international honour came in 1997, when he was awarded both the Pritzker Architecture Prize and the Heinrich Tessenow Gold Medal (&quot;Heinrich-Tessenow-Medaille&quot;).

== Personal life ==
In 1952, he married Ingrid Løvberg Pettersen (1929–2005).
Fehn died in his Oslo home at the age of 84. He was survived by his son Guy Fehn and four grandchildren.

<text>Masti Venkatesha Iyengar (6 June 1891 – 6 June 1986) was a well-known writer in Kannada language. He was the fourth among Kannada writers to be honored with the Jnanpith Award, the highest literary honor conferred in India. He was popularly referred to as &quot;Maasti Kannadada Aasti&quot; which means &quot;Maasti, Kannada&#x27;s Treasure&quot;. He is most renowned for his short stories. He wrote under the pen name &quot;Srinivasa&quot;. He was honoured with the title &quot;Rajasevasakta&quot; by then Maharaja of Mysore Nalvadi Krishnaraja Wadeyar.

==Early life and education==
Maasti was born in 1891 at Hungenahalli in Kolar district of Karnataka in a Tamil speaking Sri Vaishnavaite Iyengar Brahmin family. He spent his early childhood in Maasti village. He obtained a master&#x27;s degree in English literature (Arts) in 1914 from Madras University. After joining the Indian Civil Service (Known as the Mysore Civil Service in the days of the Maharaja of Mysore), he held various positions of responsibility in different parts of Karnataka, rising to the rank of District Commissioner. After 26 years of service, he resigned in 1943, as a protest when he did not get the post equivalent to a Minister, which he felt that he deserved, and a junior was promoted ahead of him. He wrote some pieces in English and then switched to writing in the Kannada language. He often used the pen name &quot;Srinivasa&quot;.

==Works==
He published his first work, &quot;Rangana Maduve&quot; in 1910. His last work was &quot;Maatugara Ramanna&quot;, from 1985. &quot;Kelavu Sanna Kathegalu&quot; (Some Short Stories) was his first notable work in modern Kannada literature. Maasti also crafted a number poems on various philosophic, aesthetic and social themes. He composed and translated several important plays and was the editor of the monthly journal &quot;Jivana&quot; (Life) from 1944 to 1965.

A prolific writer, he wrote more than 123 books in Kannada and 17 in English, over the course of seventy years. He won the Jnanpith Award in 1983 for his novel &quot;Chikka Veera Rajendra.&quot; The story was about the last Rajah of Kodagu.

==Demise==
Masti Venkatesh Iyengar died on his 95th birthday in 1986.

==Commemorations==
Since 1993, an award in his name, the &quot;Masti Venkatesha Iyengar Award&quot; is presented to well-known writers from Karnataka. His house is located in Basavanagudi area in Bangalore. His house, located in Maasti village, Maluru Taluk (Kolar District) has been converted into a library and maintained by the Government of Karnataka. Masti Residential School was started in his memory in 2006–07, at a nearby location.

<text>BMW M GmbH, formerly known as BMW Motorsport GmbH, is a subsidiary of BMW AG that manufactures performance cars.

BMW M (&quot;M&quot; for &quot;motorsport&quot;) was initially created to facilitate BMW&#x27;s racing program, which was very successful in the 1960s and 1970s. As time passed, BMW M began to supplement BMW&#x27;s vehicle portfolio with specially modified higher trim models, for which they are now most known by the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include modified engines, transmissions, suspensions, interior trims, aerodynamics, and exterior modifications to set them apart from their counterparts. All M models are tested and tuned at BMW&#x27;s private facility at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany.

BMW M also provides M packages for the BMW S1000RR motorcycle, with a limited-production homologation-special, race-type machine designated M1000RR, produced from 2021 onwards.

==History==

===Origins===

Established in May 1972 with 35 employees, it grew to 400 employees by 1988, and is currently an integral part of BMW&#x27;s market presence. The first racing project was BMW&#x27;s 3.0 CSL. After this came the BMW 530MLE in 1976. It was designed to compete in South Africa&#x27;s Modified Production Series instead of the regular E12 528i. 100 homologated road cars had to be produced for this.

After the success of BMW M products like &quot;BMW 3.0 CSL&quot; in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for sale to the public. The first official M-badged car for sale to the public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978. The M1, however, was more of a racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver. The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW&#x27;s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan.

In 1993, BMW Motorsport GmbH changed their name to BMW M GmbH.

BMW Motorsport GmbH supplied the 6.1-litre V12 DOHC 48 valve engine that powers the McLaren F1, which, like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the first year of competition for the GTR racing variant.

===Recent history===
At present, BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every BMW nameplate, except for the Z1.

The BMW X5 and X6 sport activity vehicles received M derivatives for the 2010 model year onwards. These are the first M vehicles with xDrive four-wheel drive and automatic transmissions, and also the first M-badged SUV models. However, the E70 and E71 X5 and X6 M were actually developed by BMW Group rather than by BMW M.

Although these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, BMW M has a considerably different philosophy than Mercedes-AMG. BMW M has emphasized tuning only vehicles with &quot;Lateral agility&quot; (which has long been the 3 Series, 5 Series, and roadsters), while AMG has created fast versions of many of its nameplates, including flagship sedans and SUVs. Accordingly, &quot;an M car has to be responsive and fundamentally keen on turning as well as accelerating. The M5&#x27;s technical spec is all about connecting the driver to a car that reacts blindingly fast, whatever request the driver hands down.&quot; Until the 2010 model year, BMW M has also never used supercharging or turbocharging, unlike Mercedes-AMG or Audi; for instance the E39 and E60 iterations of the BMW M5 (using naturally-aspirated engines) competed against the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (with a supercharged V8) and the Audi RS6 (twin-turbo).

BMW &quot;M&quot; vehicles can use a variety of transmissions, including manual, dual-clutch, and automatic transmissions. The North American market E36 M3s in sedan and convertible form were the first M-vehicles offered with a traditional torque-converter automatic transmission.

BMW M engines were traditionally large displacement naturally aspirated high revving engines, particularly the S85 V10 in the E60 M5 and E63 M6 and the related S65 V8 in the E90 M3. These are the most powerful engines BMW has ever built (not including the BMW S70/2) without supercharging or turbocharging, with an output of 100 hp per liter of displacement, and each has won numerous International Engine of the Year Awards. As late as the early 2000s, BMW regarded forced-induction (supercharging or turbocharging) as low-tech shortcuts to boosting horsepower, stating that this adds weight and complexity while reducing throttle response. BMW purists have noted that while forced induction and/or large displacement does produce more torque for better day-to-day driving, most of them like the &quot;character&quot; and sound of low displacement naturally aspirated engines with high redlines.

However, the late 2000s international regulations trends on reducing emissions and fuel consumption are cited as the reasons not to continue further development on naturally aspirated high redline engines. The N54 twin-turbo inline-6 which debuted in the 2007 BMW 335i (E90) gives almost equivalent performance to the E46 and E90 iterations of the BMW M3, while being much more practical and fuel-efficient as a daily driver. Starting with the X5 M and X6 M, and featured in the F10 M5, BMW used the twin-turbocharged S63 which not only produces more horsepower and torque, but is also more efficient than the S85 V10. Also unlike the S85 and S65 which do not share a design with non-M BMW engines, the S63 has significant parts commonality with the base N63 V8 engine (which is also has twin turbochargers) making them less expensive to build. BMW has not yet considered supercharging.

The BMW M3 (E92/E93) was the last &quot;traditional&quot; M car left, as the rest of the list features turbocharged engines. The next iteration of the M3 (F80) and M4 (F82/F83) features a twin-turbocharged straight-6 engine.

==M cars versus M-badged cars==
Apart from the pinnacle M versions of each model, BMW Motorsport also offers &quot;M Sport&quot; accessories upgrades to cars in its lineup. This single purchase option, which offers more dramatic enhancements from the standard Sports Package, includes a sportier suspension, steering wheel, gearshift, wheels, fully-adjustable sport seats, and a sports aerodynamic package. Cars with the &quot;M Sport&quot; option are sportier than their respective stock models, but trade some of the performance and handling of &quot;M&quot; cars have in exchange for greater comfort. 

Vehicles with the &quot;M Sport&quot; upgrade feature smaller &quot;M&quot; badges on the wheels, front fenders, steering wheel, gearshift and door sills, whilst fully-fledged &quot;M&quot; cars have larger &quot;M&quot; badges on the grille and/or trunk, wheels, steering wheel, gearshift and door sills with the model number (e.g., &quot;M4&quot; or &quot;M5&quot;). The exceptions include the M Roadster and M Coupe models, both Z3, Z4 and 1 Series variants, which only have an &quot;M&quot; badge with no number displayed on the boot. 

BMW has offered these &#x27;M Sport&#x27; options on their standard vehicles since the late 1970s which explains why these vehicles carry &quot;M&quot; badges straight from the factory. In comparison, vehicle maker Audi also employs this same type of nomenclature. There are fully fledged &#x27;S&#x27; models (S4, S5, S6, S7 and TTS), as well as an optional &#x27;S&#x27;-line package that can be equipped to their standard vehicle lineup.

An example of &#x27;M&#x27;-badged vehicles in recent times includes the 5 Series and 6 Series only having a choice of either a manual or automatic transmission, but the &#x27;M&#x27; Sport package had an optional Sequential Sport Gearbox (SSG) (a gearbox similar to the M5 and M6 (SMG)) until after the 2007 model year.

=== Exclusive M cars ===

Two models, the M1 (1978–1981) and XM (2022–present), are not pinnacle versions of an existing BMW model, but rather, are ground-up performance models produced and sold exclusively in their M variant. Sometimes labelled as &quot;M Original&quot; cars, these models represent flagship performance and design for the M brand.

==M Performance models==
In 2012 BMW introduced a new category for &quot;M&quot; cars, branded as &quot;M&quot; Performance, designed “to bridge the gap between M Sport variants and the outright M high-performance models.“ The lineup included the diesel-powered M550d in saloon and touring body styles, X5 M50d, and X6 M50d, marking the first diesel-powered BMW models to ever carry M-badging. The gasoline-powered M135i debuted shortly after. 

BMW has since announced M Performance variants of nearly every model in their lineup, including three new electric models, the i4, ix and the i7.

===Exceptions===
*The BMW X-based M vehicles bear their normal model designations followed by the &quot;M&quot; stripe badge (the X3 M, X4 M, X5 M and X6 M). If the nomenclature followed tradition, then they would have had the &quot;M&quot; preceding the model designation, e.g. MX5 and MX6, already used by Mazda.
*The Z3-based M Roadster and M Coupe bore numberless &quot;M&quot; badges as standard fitment.
*The first generation Z4-based Z4 M Roadster and Z4 M Coupe bore their normal model designations followed by the &quot;M&quot; stripe badge (the Z4 M Roadster and Z4 M Coupe).
*The M635CSi followed the M535i naming tradition but was a fully-fledged M-Car (the M6).
*The BMW 1 Series-based M cars is called the BMW 1 Series M Coupe to avoid confusion with the original BMW M1.

===Previous M cars===
===M-badged cars===
All these cars are true BMW Motorsport models, not M-line sport models that bear BMW Motorsport features such as sport body kits, and interior specs.

*E12 M535i (1979–1981) – often considered the first mass-production vehicle built by BMW Motorsport
*E31 850CSi (1992–1996) – an M car in all but name; it had a BMW M–sourced engine and its VIN indicated that it was developed by BMW Motorsport, like all other M cars.

===M-engined cars===
In the late 1980s, due to prohibitive taxes for cars above 2.0-litres of engine displacement in Italy and Portugal, BMW decided to build the E30 320is as an alternative to the 2.3-litre M3. This car was equipped with a shorter stroke S14 engine and produced 192 PS. BMW produced a total of 3648 units between 9/1987 and 11/1990 of which a majority of 2542 units were made available in two-door form (code name AK95). No catalytic converters were installed on this limited version. The steering rack, springs, shock absorbers, and brakes were similar to the normal E30 6-cylinder models (i.e. 325i) with sports suspension. The engine was mated to a Getrag 265 5-speed transmission in dog-leg configuration.

==Competition==
Audi&#x27;s RS models, Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s AMG models, and Lexus F models are often reviewed in direct competition to a similarly sized BMW M car, such as the Lexus IS-F vs. Audi RS 4 vs. Mercedes-Benz C 63 AMG vs. BMW M3.

In contrast to aftermarket tuners, Alpina BMW-based cars are currently mostly built by BMW on its production lines and are more comfort-oriented. Alpina is recognized as a car manufacturer and works very closely with BMW, sometimes participating in the development of BMW models and engines. Some Alpina models are even sold in North-America by BMW and either compete with the BMW M6 Gran Coupé, in the case of the Alpina B6 Gran Coupé, or replace them, in the case of the Alpina B7 as there is no M7 variant of the 7 Series to compete with the model.

BMW M also faces competition from several independent companies offering their own performance versions of BMW models; some performance packs can be retrofitted to existing cars while others are applied to new cars bought directly from BMW AG and converted prior to first registration. Such companies include Hamann Motorsport, Dinan Cars, G-Power, AC Schnitzer and Hartge.

<doc id="1158874" wikidata="Q4729833" url="?curid=1158874" title="All Together Now (The Farm song)">
<text>&quot;All Together Now&quot; is a song by British band the Farm and the second single from their debut album, &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1991). The song was released in November 1990 by Produce, Jive, Sire, and Reprise. Vocalist of the band Peter Hooton wrote the lyrics in his early 20s, after reading about the Christmas truce of 1914. The song was first recorded under the title &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; for a John Peel session in 1983. In 1990, Hooton wrote the chorus after Steve Grimes suggested putting the lyrics of &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; to the chord progression of Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon. To shorten the song for radio, the producer Suggs cut the song to three verses from its original six. Its accompanying music video received heavy rotation on MTV Europe. &quot;All Together Now&quot; has been used by numerous football teams since, as well as by the Labour Party for their 2017 general election campaign, often played during rallies.

==Background and release==
The Farm was formed in the early 1980s in Liverpool, comprising Peter Hooton, Steve Grimes, John Melvin and Andrew John &quot;Andy&quot; McVann. In 1989, the band had been given a cameo role in the movie &quot;The Final Frame&quot; starring founding member of Madness and actor Suggs. They were signed after this and hired Suggs as their producer. The Farm were originally an indie band, but after hearing &quot;Loaded&quot; by Primal Scream, which was a top-20 hit in the UK at the time, they wanted to try something more dance-oriented. Band member Grimes wanted to use &quot;Pachelbel&#x27;s Canon&quot; by Johann Pachelbel in a song after hearing it in a TV advert and a chord sequence was taken from it. The band bought a sampler so they could do it, and they contacted DJ and house music producer Terry Farley. When he heard the result, he said, &quot;That&#x27;s a hit. You&#x27;ve got to write some lyrics.&quot; 

Vocalist Peter Hooton used lyrics from a song he had written earlier, named &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;. It was first recorded for a John Peel session in 1983. Verses from that song were used to make &quot;All Together Now&quot;. The lyrics tells about the Christmas Day Truce in World War I where, on Christmas Day 1914, soldiers from both sides put their weapons down, and met in no man&#x27;s land to exchange gifts and play football. &quot;All Together Now&quot; originally had six verses, but was cut in half to shorten it, after Suggs suggested this. He produced it and it was recorded at Mayfair Studios in London. The single was originally released on 26 November 1990 peaking at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 1 on the &quot;NME&quot; Independent chart and No. 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. Its cover showed a Subbuteo figure wearing an army uniform and brandishing a Bren machine gun. It was also the last video shown on The Power Station on 8 April 1991.

==Critical reception==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called &quot;All Together Now&quot; &quot;goofily endearing&quot; and &quot;truly memorable&quot;. Larry Flick from American magazine &quot;Billboard&quot; considered it &quot;anthemic&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; named it one of 1990&#x27;s &quot;most memorable songs&quot; and &quot;such a catchy song&quot;. Jon Wilde from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, &quot;1990 has seen the inexplicable rise of The Ordinary Bloke. They don&#x27;t come any more ordinary than the Farm, who look for all the world like a collection of bit actors in Northern soap operas, the kind of geezers you find hanging about by the pub dart-board scoffing salt and vinegar crisps as burly Betty Turpin types fetch hither mixers from the cellar. Their 15 seconds of minor celebrity will surely be up once the general public get wind of this ruthlessly awful rock dirge with dancefloor pretensions.&quot; Another &quot;Melody Maker&quot; editor, Bob Stanley, complimented the song as &quot;excellent&quot; and a &quot;enjoyable moment&quot; of the album. Andrew Collins from &quot;NME&quot; named it &quot;easily this LP&#x27;s grandest moment&quot; and &quot;one of 1990&#x27;s most durable hits, a scarfs-out-for-the-lads &#x27;Abide with Me&#x27; for last orders.&quot; 

Another &quot;NME&quot; editor, David Quantick, commented, &quot;Sometimes the Farm seem to be more anonymous than the person underneath the Jive Bunny mask. [...] And now they return with a record that has a powerfully singable chorus, a pounding beat, Shaun Ryder&#x27;s vocal dad Pete Wylie on backing singing...and I&#x27;m beggered if I can remember it for more than a nanosecond after it&#x27;s over. A chorus without a verse, an anthem without a purpose, an answer without a question.&quot; Andy Strickland from &quot;Record Mirror&quot; named it Single of the Week, adding, &quot;With things hotting up in the Gulf, this could prove to be one of the most poignant pop hits since the late Sixties. Musically, it picks up where &quot;Groovy Train&quot; left off; great groove, spacey guitar into and a guaranteed sing-a-long dancefloor filler.&quot; Miranda Sawyer from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a banner-waving epic, that&#x27;s what it is. Blimey. There&#x27;s still a nice jittery beat to shake your roomy trouserwear to, but the catchy chorus is unmistakably of the proud-scarf-waving-and-lighters-aloft genre. If you&#x27;re into flopping your fringe about then you&#x27;ll be a bit disappointed for this is definitely one for the terraces. Nice and uplifting.&quot;

==Promotion==
In March 1994, it was performed by the band and a host of Liverpudlians in front of the Spion Kop at Anfield before the last ever Merseyside derby in front of the old Kop, which was demolished later that year and replaced by an all-seater stand. In 2007 it was used in Scottish television adverts for Clydesdale Bank and in UK-wide advertisements promoting Cancer Research UK&#x27;s Race for Life. It is also used as the theme tune for Sky Sports Football League coverage and as the ending theme of the 1994 movie Double Dragon.

<text>A protein skimmer or foam fractionator is a device used to remove organic compounds such as food and waste particles from water. It is most commonly used in commercial applications like municipal water treatment facilities, public aquariums, and aquaculture facilities. Smaller protein skimmers are also used for filtration of home saltwater aquariums and even freshwater aquariums and ponds.

==Function==
Protein skimming removes certain organic compounds, including proteins and amino acids found in food particles and fish waste, by using the polarity of the protein itself. Due to their intrinsic charge, water-borne proteins are either repelled or attracted by the air–water interface and these molecules can be described as hydrophobic (such as fats or oils) or hydrophilic (such as salt, sugar, ammonia, most amino acids, and most inorganic compounds). However, some larger organic molecules can have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. These molecules are called amphipathic or amphiphilic. Commercial protein skimmers work by generating a large air–water interface, specifically by injecting large numbers of bubbles into the water column. In general, the smaller the bubbles the more effective the protein skimming is because the surface area of small bubbles occupying the same volume is much greater than the same volume of larger bubbles. Large numbers of small bubbles present an enormous air–water interface for hydrophobic organic molecules and amphipathic organic molecules to collect on the bubble surface (the air–water interface). Water movement hastens diffusion of organic molecules, which effectively brings more organic molecules to the air–water interface and lets the organic molecules accumulate on the surface of the air bubbles. This process continues until the interface is saturated, unless the bubble is removed from the water or it bursts, in which case the accumulated molecules release back into the water column. However, it is important to note that further exposure of a saturated air bubble to organic molecules may continue to result in changes as compounds that bind more strongly may replace those molecules with a weaker binding that have already accumulated on the interface. Although some aquarists believe that increasing the contact time (or dwell time as it is sometimes called) is always good, it is incorrect to claim that it is always better to increase the contact time between bubbles and the aquarium water. As the bubbles increase near the top of the protein skimmer water column, they become denser and the water begins to drain and create the foam that will carry the organic molecules to the skimmate collection cup or to a separate skimmate waste collector and the organic molecules, and any inorganic molecules that may have become bound to the organic molecules, will be exported from the water system.

In addition to the proteins removed by skimming, there are a number of other organic and inorganic molecules that are typically removed. These include a variety of fats, fatty acids, carbohydrates, metals such as copper, and trace elements such as iodine. Particulates, phytoplankton, bacteria, and detritus are also removed; this is desired by some aquarists, and is often enhanced by placement of the skimmer before other forms of filtration, lessening the burden on the filtration system as a whole. There is at least one published study that provides a detailed list of the export products removed by the skimmer. Aquarists who keep filter-feeding invertebrates, however, sometimes prefer to keep these particulates in the water to serve as natural food.

Protein skimmers are used to harvest algae and phytoplankton gently enough to maintain viability for culturing or commercial sale as live cultures.

Alternative forms of water filtration have recently come into use, including the algae scrubber, which leaves food particles in the water for corals and small fish to consume, but removes the noxious compounds including ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate that protein skimmers do not remove.

==Design==

All skimmers have key features in common: water flows through a chamber and is brought into contact with a column of fine bubbles. The bubbles collect proteins and other substances and carry them to the top of the device where the foam, but not the water, collects in a cup. Here the foam condenses to a liquid, which can be easily removed from the system. The material that collects in the cup can range from pale greenish-yellow, watery liquid to a thick black tar.

Consider this summary of optimal protein skimmer design by Randy Holmes-Farley: 

For a skimmer to function maximally, the following things must take place:
1. A large amount of air–water interface must be generated.
2. Organic molecules must be allowed to collect at the air–water interface.
3. The bubbles forming this air–water interface must come together to form a foam.
4. The water in the foam must partially drain without the bubbles popping prematurely.
5. The drained foam must be separated from the bulk water and discarded.
Also under considerable recent attention has been the general shape of a skimmer as well. In particular, much attention has been given to the introduction of cone shaped skimmer units. Originally designed by Klaus Jensen in 2004, the concept was founded on the principle that a conical body allows the foam to accumulate more steadily through a gently sloping transition. It was claimed that this reduces the overall turbulence, resulting in more efficient skimming. However, this design reduces the overall volume inside the skimmer, reducing dwell time. Cylindrical-shaped protein skimmers are the most popular design and allow for the largest volume of air and water.

Overall, protein skimmers can be classed in two ways depending on whether they operate by co-current flow or counter-current flow. In a co-current flow system, air is introduced at the bottom of the chamber and is in contact with the water as it rises upwards towards the collection chamber. In a counter-current system, air is forced into the system under pressure and moves against the flow of the water for a while before it rises up towards the collection cup. Because the air bubbles may be in contact with the water for a longer period in a counter-current flow system, protein skimmers of this type are considered by some to be more effective at removing organic wastes.

===Co-current flow systems===

====Air stone====
The original method of protein skimming, running pressurized air through a diffuser to produce large quantities of microbubbles, remains a viable, effective, and economic choice, although newer technologies may require lower maintenance. The air stone is most often an oblong, partially hollowed block of wood, most often of the genus Tilia. The most popular wooden air-stones for skimmers are made from limewood (Tilia europaea or European limewood) although basswood (Tilia americana or American linden), works as well, may be cheaper and is often more readily available. The wooden blocks are drilled, tapped, fitted with an air fitting, and connected by air tubing to one or more air pumps delivering at least 1 cfm. The wooden air stone is placed at the bottom of a tall column of water. The tank water is pumped into the column, allowed to pass by the rising bubbles, and back into the tank. To get enough contact time with the bubble, these units can be many feet in height.

Air stone protein skimmers may be constructed as a DIY project from pvc pipes and fittings at low cost and with varying degrees of complexity .

Air stone protein skimmers require powerful air pumps which are often power hungry, loud, and hot, leading to an increase in the aquarium water temperatures. While this method has been around for many years, due to more efficient technologies emerging, many regard it as inefficient current uses in larger systems or systems with large bio-loads.

====Venturi====
The premise behind these skimmers is that a high-pressure pump, combined with a venturi, can be used to introduce the bubbles into the water stream. The tank water is pumped through the venturi, in which fine bubbles are introduced via pressure differential, then enters the skimmer body. This method was popular due to its compact size and high efficiency for the time but venturi designs are now outdated and surpassed by more efficient needle-wheel designs.

===Counter-current flow systems===

====Aspirating: pin-wheel/adrian-wheel, needle-wheel, mesh-wheel====

This basic concept is more correctly known as an aspirating skimmer, since some skimmer designs using an aspirator do not use a &quot;pin-wheel&quot;/&quot;Adrian-wheel&quot; or &quot;needle-wheel&quot;. &quot;Pin-wheel&quot;/&quot;Adrian-wheel&quot; describes the look of an impeller that consists of a disk with pins mounted perpendicular (90°) to the disc and parallel to the rotor. &quot;Needle-wheel&quot; describes the look of an impeller that consists of a series of pins projecting out perpendicular to the rotor from a central axis. &quot;Mesh-wheel&quot; describes the look of an impeller that consists of a mesh material attached to a plate or central axis on the rotor. The purpose of these modified impellers is to chop or shred the air that is introduced via an air aspirator apparatus or external air pump into very fine bubbles. The mesh-wheel design provides excellent results in the short term because of its ability to create fine bubbles with its thin cutting surfaces, but its propensity for clogging makes it an unreliable design.

The air aspirator differs from the venturi by the positioning of the water pump. With a venturi, the water is pushed through the unit, creating a vacuum to draw in air. With an air aspirator, the water is pulled through the unit, creating a vacuum to draw in air. These terms, however, are often incorrectly interchanged. 

This style of protein skimmer has become very popular with public aquariums and is believed to be the most popular type of skimmer used with residential reef aquariums today. It has been particularly successful in smaller aquariums due to its usually compact size, ease of set up and use, and quiet operation. Since the pump is pushing a mixture of air and water, the power required to turn the rotor can be decreased and may result in a lower power requirement for that pump vs. the same pump with a different impeller when it is only pumping water.

====Downdraft====

The downdraft skimmer is both a proprietary skimmer design and a style of protein skimmer that injects water under high pressure into tubes that have a foam or bubble generating mechanism and carry the air–water mixture down into the skimmer and into a separate chamber. The proprietary design is protected in the United States with patents and commercial skimmer products in the US are limited to that single company. Their design uses one or more tubes with plastic media such as bio balls inside to mix water under high pressure and air in the body of the skimmer resulting in foam that collects protein waste in a collection cup. This was one of the earlier high performance protein skimmer designs and large models were produced that saw success in large and public aquariums.

====Beckett skimmer====

The Beckett skimmer has some similarities to the downdraft skimmer but introduced a foam nozzle to produce the flow of air bubbles. The name &quot;Beckett&quot; comes from the patented foam nozzle developed and sold by the Beckett Corporation (United States), although similar foam nozzle designs are sold by other companies outside the United States (e.g. Sicce (Italy)). Instead of using the plastic media that is found in downdraft skimmer designs, the Beckett skimmer uses design concepts from previous generations of skimmers, specifically the downdraft skimmer and the venturi skimmer (the Beckett 1408 Foam Nozzle is a modified 4 port venturi) to produce a hybrid that is capable of using powerful pressure rated water pumps and quickly processing large amounts of aquarium water in a short period of time. Commercial Beckett skimmers come in single Beckett, dual Beckett, and quad Beckett designs. Well engineered Beckett skimmers are quiet and reliable. Due to the advances in pump technologies and introduction of DC pumps, the concerns of powerful pumps taking up additional space, introducing additional noise, and using more electricity have all been alleviated. Unlike the Downdraft and Spray Induction skimmers, Beckett skimmer designs are produced by a number of companies in the United States and elsewhere and are not known to be restricted by patents.

====Spray induction====

This method is related to the downdraft, but uses a pump to power a spray nozzle, fixed a few inches above the water level. The spray action entraps and shreds the air in the base of the unit, similar to holding your thumb over a garden hose, which then rises to the collection chamber. In the United States, one company has patented the spray induction technology and the commercial product offerings are limited to that single company.

===Recirculating skimmer designs===

A recent trend is to change the method by which the skimmer is fed &#x27;dirty&#x27; water from the aquarium as a means to recirculate water within the skimmer multiple times before it is returned to the sump or the aquarium. Aspirating pump skimmers are the most popular type of skimmer to use recirculating designs although other types of skimmers, such as Beckett skimmers, are also available in recirculating versions. While there is a popular belief among some aquarist that this recirculation increases the dwell or contact time of the generated air bubbles within the skimmer there is no authoritative evidence that this is true. Each time water is recirculated within the skimmer any air bubbles in that water sample are destroyed and new bubbles are generated by the recirculating pump venturi apparatus so the air-water contact time begins again for these newly created bubbles. In non-recirculating skimmer designs, a skimmer has one inlet supplied by a pump that pulls water in from the aquarium and injects it with air into the skimmer and releasing the foam or air–water mix into the reaction chamber. With a recirculating design, the one inlet is usually driven by a separate feed pump, or in some cases may be gravity fed, to receive the dirty water to process, while the pump providing the foam or air–water mix into the reaction chamber is set up separately in a closed loop on the side of the skimmer. The recirculating pump pulls water out of the skimmer and injects air to generate the foam or air–water mix before returning it to the skimmer reaction chamber—thus &#x27;recirculating&#x27; it. The feed pump in a recirculating design typically injects a smaller amount of dirty water than co/counter-current designs. The separate feed pump allows easy control of the rate of water exchange through the skimmer and for many aquarists this is one of the important attractions of recirculating skimmer designs. Because the pump configuration of these skimmers is similar to that of aspirating pump skimmers, the power consumption advantages are also similar.

<text>Live After Death is a live album by English heavy metal band Iron Maiden, originally released in October 1985 on EMI in Europe and its sister label Capitol Records in the US (it was re-released by Sanctuary/Columbia Records in the US in 2002 on CD and by Universal Music Group/Sony BMG Music Entertainment on DVD). It was recorded at Long Beach Arena, California and Hammersmith Odeon, London during the band&#x27;s World Slavery Tour.

The video version of the concert only contains footage from the Long Beach shows. It was initially released though Sony as a &quot;Video LP&quot; on VHS hi-fi stereo and Beta hi-fi stereo with 14 songs and no special features and was reissued on DVD on 4 February 2008, which coincided with the start of the band&#x27;s Somewhere Back in Time World Tour. In addition to the complete concert, the DVD features Part 2 of &quot;The History of Iron Maiden&quot; documentary series, which began with 2004&#x27;s &quot;The Early Days&quot; and continued with 2013&#x27;s &quot;Maiden England &#x27;88&quot;, documenting the recording of the &quot;Powerslave&quot; album and the following World Slavery Tour.

==Background==
Iron Maiden&#x27;s World Slavery Tour began in Warsaw, Poland on 9 August 1984 and lasted 331 days, during which 187 concerts were performed To tie in with their 1984 album, &quot;Powerslave&quot;, the tour&#x27;s stage show adhered to an ancient Egyptian theme, which was decorated with sarcophagi and Egyptian hieroglyphs, and mummified representations of the band&#x27;s mascot, Eddie, in addition to numerous pyrotechnic effects. The theatricality of the stage show meant that it would become one of the band&#x27;s most acclaimed tours, making it the perfect backdrop to their first live double album and concert video.

For the &quot;Live After Death&quot; video, the band hired director Jim Yukich to film two shows of their four-night run at Long Beach Arena, California from 14 to 17 March 1985.

The double LP was also recorded at Long Beach, although side four contains tracks recorded at Hammersmith Odeon, London on 8, 9, 10 and 12 October 1984. Bassist Steve Harris has stated that, even if they had had the time, they would not have added any studio overdubbing to the soundtrack: &quot;We were really anti all that, anyway. We were very much, like, &#x27;This has got to be totally live,&#x27; you know?&quot;

The album has received consistent critical praise, with reviewers hailing it one of the genre&#x27;s best live albums. For the band, the release was advantageous as it meant they could delay the recording of their next studio album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. Time off was beneficial for the band, who desperately needed to recuperate following the World Slavery Tour&#x27;s heavy schedule.

===Recorded dates===
According to Harris, while the video used footage from two nights at Long Beach, the audio version is only made up of one performance, although no exact dates are specified. However, during &quot;Running Free&quot; on the audio version, vocalist Bruce Dickinson refers to it being the fourth concert at the venue, which should mean that the audio version was recorded on Sunday, 17 March. On the video version, after &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;, Dickinson refers to it being &quot;night number two&quot; (Friday, 15 March), while on the documentary &quot;12 Wasted Years&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot; and &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; are said to have been recorded on Saturday, 16 March.

== Cover art ==
The cover art, by Derek Riggs, pictures the band&#x27;s mascot, Eddie, rising from a grave. Engraved on his tombstone is a misquote from fantasy and horror fiction author H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Nameless City&quot;:
The original Lovecraft text has an &quot;and&quot; instead of a &quot;yet&quot;.

Also engraved on the headstone is what appears to be Eddie&#x27;s full name, &quot;Edward T H--&quot;, the remainder of which (his supposed surname, &quot;Head&quot;) is obscured by a clump of sod.

The depiction of Eddie follows continuity from previous artworks. His long hair is restored and he sports the metal screw cartouche from his &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; lobotomy, which is being struck by lightning. He is also bound by metal cuffs connected by an electrical surge, as seen in &quot;Powerslave&quot; tour promotional artwork.

The back cover depicts the rest of the graveyard and a city being destroyed by lightning, which Riggs states was inspired by John Martin&#x27;s painting, &quot;The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;. Death appears in the clouds above the destroyed city; the character is a regular feature of Riggs&#x27; covers (such as &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;The Trooper&quot;, &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;).

Near Eddie&#x27;s grave is a black cat with a halo, which also features in the &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; and &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; artworks. This, said Riggs, was &quot;not about anything really&quot; and was added &quot;to get people&#x27;s attention&quot;. To the cat&#x27;s left is a tombstone engraved with &quot;Here lies Derek Riggs&quot;. Riggs also included gravestones that state &quot;Live With Pride&quot;, added at the band&#x27;s request to show opposition to lip-synched performances, &quot;Here Lies Faust In Body Only&quot;, the German legend who sold his soul to the Devil (hence &quot;in body only&quot;), and a stone that simply reads &quot;Thank You&quot;, representing the Grateful Dead.

The sleeve was hung in the studio where Florence and the Machine recorded their debut album &quot;Lungs&quot;. &quot;Some of the songs on my album are like gothic horror shows,&quot; said singer Florence Welch. &quot;So, yeah, Iron Maiden massively influenced the album, quote-unquote!&quot;

The poster is shown on the episode of The Walking Dead, season 10 episode 22 &quot;Here&#x27;s Negan&quot;. It can be seen above Lucille and Negan&#x27;s bed.

== Intro ==
The intro before &quot;Aces High&quot; is a part of the We shall fight on the beaches speech made by Winston Churchill in the House of Commons on 4 June 1940. (Churchill re-recorded the speech – the original speech in the House of Commons was not recorded.):

It was later used for their Ed Hunter Tour, Somewhere Back in Time World Tour, Maiden England World Tour, and the Legacy of the Beast World Tour.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Live After Death&quot; has been highly rated by critics since its release; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and Sputnikmusic both agree that it is &quot;possibly the greatest live album of all time&quot;, while AllMusic describes it as &quot;easily one of heavy metal&#x27;s best live albums&quot;.

Sputnikmusic argues that it is the band&#x27;s best live album, concluding that &quot;Iron Maiden&#x27;s 1985 release has everything you could ask for. With, exciting renditions of classic songs, and brilliant performances, &quot;Live After Death&quot; is quite a fun listen.&quot; PopMatters describes it as &quot;a searing, 102-minute collection of Maiden at [their] peak ... an absolute treasure for fans [which] went on to be universally regarded as an instant classic in the genre&quot;.

The album&#x27;s video counterpart received similar critical acclaim, with AllMusic stating that &quot;&quot;Live After Death&quot; is a visual pleasure as much as a sonic one. The elaborate staging and lighting effects are excellent. The editing is superb as well [with] very few rapid-fire, seizure-inducing camera cuts&quot;. The bonus features included in the 2008 DVD reissue were also praised by &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; and &quot;About.com&quot;.

The album has also been described by &quot;Classic Rock&quot; as &quot;the last great live album of the vinyl era.&quot;

==Track listing==


*The first 13 tracks were recorded at Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California, from 14 to 17 March 1985. The last five songs were recorded earlier on the same tour, at the Hammersmith Odeon in London on 8, 9, 10 and 12 October 1984. The &quot;Live After Death&quot; video was also recorded at Long Beach Arena, but on different nights than the audio.
*The 1985 CD edition includes only the first 13 tracks due to CD length restrictions, and merges the intro track into the second, for a total of 12 tracks. A few tracks are also shortened, most notably &quot;Running Free&quot;, which is missing the entire audience participation middle section, thus reducing its length to only 3:24 from its full 8-minute runtime. A 1995 re-release features this same truncated version of the concert, but comes with an additional CD containing the B-sides from the &quot;Live After Death&quot; single releases.
*The 1998 and 2020 remastered CD reissues include the full concert in its original length, plus the additional tracks from side four on a second CD.
*The video releases contain the 13 tracks included with the audio releases and closes with &quot;Sanctuary&quot;. The DVD version features a bonus disc that includes &quot;The History of Iron Maiden – Part 2: Live After Death&quot;, the second part of an ongoing documentary series about the history of the band, &quot;Behind the Iron Curtain&quot; feature, promo videos and additional footage from various concerts, as well as a gallery of artwork and photos.

<doc id="1158881" wikidata="Q1986812" url="?curid=1158881" title="Tituba">
<text>Tituba () was an enslaved Native American woman who was one of the first to be accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials of 1692–1693.

She was enslaved by Samuel Parris, the minister of Salem Village, in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. She was pivotal in the trials because she confessed to witchcraft when examined by the authorities, giving credence to the accusations. She accused the two other women, Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of the same crime. She was imprisoned for over a year but never tried. What happened to her after a grand jury dismissed the case against her in May 1693 is unknown.

== Early life ==
The only records of Tituba pertain to her central position in the Salem witch trials, where she appears as the Indian slave of a local minister named Samuel Parris. It is not known how Parris initially came across Tituba, who was not from Massachusetts.

The sole source for Tituba&#x27;s birthplace is Thomas Hutchinson, who wrote in 1764 – decades after Tituba&#x27;s death – that she had been &quot;brought into the Country from New Spain&quot;. Later historians have taken this to mean the Caribbean or more specifically Barbados, but this is speculation. In the 1990s, Elaine G. Breslaw identified her with a &quot;Tattuba,&quot; born circa 1662–1666, who was documented as enslaved to one Samuel Thompson in Barbados in 1674. Breslaw proposed that the name Tituba was derived from the Tetebetana clan of Arawak language speakers, and that she was born near Venezuela and captured as a child. Other historians including Peter Charles Hoffer and Samuel Drake have suggested that Tituba was born in Africa. In 1998, Bernard Rosenthal objected to both lines of argument as compounded speculation. He observed that Barbadian slaves were indeed generally African, but Tituba was universally described as Indian in Puritan sources.

In support of the theory connecting Tituba to Barbados, Elaine Breslaw and Charles Upham pointed to Samuel Fowler&#x27;s writing, &quot;Account of the Life of Samuel Parrish&quot;, which described Tituba&#x27;s eventual master Samuel Parris as transporting slaves from there. While there is no direct evidence to prove this theory, Breslaw presumes that she was Samuel Thompson&#x27;s family cook, as most enslaved Native Americans were. Tituba would have interacted with a diverse group of people in Barbados, likely picking up knowledge about witchcraft from mistresses and other slaves.

Samuel Thompson inherited his farm in 1676, then fell deathly ill in 1679 and deeded his estate to others. No evidence links Thompson to Parris, but the Thompson estate was in flux at this time, and &quot;Tattuba&quot; could have been purchased or inherited by Parris, who returned to Massachusetts in 1680. There is no surviving record, however, of a woman named Tattuba or Tituba being transferred.

Tituba&#x27;s husband was called &quot;John Indian,&quot; and his origin is unknown. His name is an apparent exonym, and he may have been a Wampanoag or another Indian from New Spain. John became one of the accusers in the Salem witch trials. They appear documented together in Samuel Parris&#x27;s church record book.

== Salem witch trials ==

Tituba was one of the first people to be accused of practicing witchcraft by Elizabeth Parris and Abigail Williams. It has been theorized that Tituba told the girls tales of Haitian Vodou and witchcraft before the accusations. Tituba was allowed to speak against her accusers despite her race because it was not illegal for slaves to give testimony in court. She was also the first person to confess to practicing witchcraft in Salem Village in January 1692. Initially denying her involvement in witchcraft, Tituba later confessed to making a &quot;witch cake&quot;, but she confessed to making it only after Samuel Parris beat her. Tituba also confessed to speaking with the devil, and in her confession, she stated that he ordered her to worship him and hurt the children of the village. When she was questioned later, she added that she learned about occult techniques from her mistress in &quot;her own Country&quot; (presumably Barbados), who taught her how to ward herself from evil powers and reveal the cause of witchcraft. Since such knowledge was not supposed to be harmful, Tituba again asserted to Parris that she was not a witch. Still, she admitted that she had participated in an occult ritual when she made the witch cake in an attempt to help Elizabeth Parris. Due to how young the accusers were, the accusation did not get taken to court, but Samuel Parris still beat Tituba in an attempt to get her to confess. A month later, Tituba, as well as Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, were accused of witchcraft again, this time by two adult women who were able to get the accusation taken to court. Tituba, Sarah Good, and Sarah Osborne were sent to jail in Boston to await trial and punishment on March 7, 1692. Despite these confessions, there is no proof that she did the things to which she confessed.

Other women and men from surrounding villages were accused of practicing witchcraft and arrested during the Salem witchcraft trials. Tituba not only used these outlandish accusations to stir confusion among Massachusetts residents, but she also used them to displace the punishment and death sentence that could have been imposed upon her. By deflecting people&#x27;s attention, she convinced others that she was a credible witness, and her recognition saved her life and reputation. Tituba must have been aware that she could not hide from the accusations which were being made against her due to certain prejudices which people held against her based on her ethnicity. She claimed not to be a witch and denied that accusation against her despite her use of occult practices, admitting that the devil visited her and Parris&#x27; determination to find her guilty. Her confession and accusations not only served as a scapegoat, they also served as a new form of entertainment to the residents of Salem as they experienced possessions because of her words. Not only did Tituba accuse others in her confession, but she talked about black dogs, hogs, a yellow bird, red and black rats, cats, a fox, and a wolf. Tituba talked about riding sticks to different places. She confessed that Sarah Osborne possessed a creature with the head of a woman, two legs, and wings. Since it mixed various perspectives on witchcraft, Tituba&#x27;s confession confused listeners, and its similarities to certain stock tropes of demonology caused some Salem Village residents to believe that Satan was among them.

After the trials, Tituba remained in Boston Gaol, which had deplorable living conditions, for thirteen months because Samuel Parris refused to pay her jail fees. During that time, she would testify in other trials of accused witches. In April 1693, Tituba was sold to an unknown person for the price of her jail fees. In an interview with Robert Calef for his collection of papers on the trials, titled &quot;More Wonders of the Invisible World: Being an Account of the Trials of Several Witches, Lately Executed in New-England&quot;, Tituba confirmed that Parris had beaten a confession out of her and then coached her on what to say and how to say it when she was first questioned.

There is no record of Tituba or John Indian after 1693. In 1694, Parris apologized to the people of Salem for his role in the witch trials. In 1711, Massachusetts offered compensation to victims of the trials, but Tituba&#x27;s name was not listed among those compensated; she may have been deceased by this time. She may have had a daughter, as an &quot;Indian woman&quot; named Violet is named in Parris&#x27;s will in 1720, but nothing is known of Violet&#x27;s life either.

== In popular culture==
The majority of fictional pieces that artistically or historically depict Tituba&#x27;s life portray her as a Black woman or an &quot;outgroup&quot; by Puritan society, due to her racial and socioeconomic status as a South American Indigenous and an indentured servant woman or slave. Although it is not explicitly discussed in all of the movies, plays and books, that account for Tituba&#x27;s conviction, it is quite possible that the &quot;fear of strangers&quot; in combination with the Western European traditional belief and understanding of witchcraft, made Tituba a prime target for witchcraft conviction. With reference to the historical understanding of Tituba and why she was convicted, it has been argued that the pre-existing ideas about &quot;out groups&quot; and stereotypical ideas of foreign cultures combined with fictional portrayals of witchcraft and sorcery works, has created a case where history and fiction shape each other. Essentially, the fictional works have assisted in the idea of what the Salem Witch Trials were like and what events lead to the convictions, trials and confessions, but without factoring in racial, political, religious and economic influences of the time, the portrayals of Tituba in media remain, for the most part, fictional.

In John Neal&#x27;s 1828 novel &quot;Rachel Dyer&quot;, a socially isolated Matthew Paris (based on Samuel Parris) feels threatened by Tituba&#x27;s relationship with John Indian and is motivated to accuse her of witchcraft as a result. Neal described her as a &quot;female Indian&quot; who &quot;did the drudgery of the house&quot;.

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, in his 1868 play entitled &quot;Giles Corey of the Salem Farms&quot;, describes Tituba as &quot;the daughter of a man all black and fierce…He was an Obi man, and taught [her] magic.&quot; Obeah (also spelled Obi) is a specifically African and Afro-American system of magic.&quot;

Tituba is featured prominently in the 1953 play &quot;The Crucible&quot; by Arthur Miller. The image of Tituba as the instigator of witchcraft at Salem was reinforced by the opening scene of &quot;The Crucible&quot;, which owes much to Marion L. Starkey&#x27;s historical work &quot;The Devil in Massachusetts&quot; (1949).

In Miller&#x27;s play, Tituba is said to have come from Barbados, where she was taught how to conjure up spirits and had allegedly dabbled in sorcery, witchcraft, and Satanism. The play suggests that Abigail Williams and the other girls tried to use Tituba&#x27;s knowledge when dancing in the woods before the trials began; it was their being caught that led to those events. With the original intention of covering up their own sinful deeds, Tituba was the one to be accused by Abigail, who had drunk from a magic cup Tituba made to kill John Proctor&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth, and to bewitch him into loving her. She and the other girls claimed to have seen Tituba &quot;with the Devil&quot;. Ironically, the belief that Tituba led these girls astray has persisted in popular lore, fiction, and nonfiction. The charge, which is seen by some as having barely disguised racist undertones, is based on the imagination of authors like Starkey, who mirrors Salem&#x27;s accusers when she asserts that &quot;I have invented the scenes with Tituba ... but they are what I really believe happened.&quot;

Tituba appears in the novel &quot;Calligraphy of the Witch&quot; (2007) by Alicia Gaspar de Alba as an Arawak Native American Indigenous from Guyana fluent in several languages and the only person in the Boston area who understands Spanish. She is a friend and English tutor to the indentured servant Concepción Benavidez, who is accused of witchcraft in the Boston area because of her Mexican and Catholic culture.

In &quot;American Horror Story: Coven&quot; (2013–2014), young witch Queenie states that she is a descendant of Tituba. Later in the series, Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau and Supreme witch Fiona Goode have an in-depth discussion of Tituba&#x27;s history and legacy. They suggest her magic came from her Arawak ancestry.

In &quot;Salem&quot; (2014–2017), Tituba (Ashley Madekwe) is portrayed as an enslaved biracial woman of Arawak descent who made a deal with the Devil and taught witchcraft to leading character Mary Sibley, née Walcott (Janet Montgomery), plotting against Puritan settlers.

Tituba is portrayed in the Jayce Landberg song &quot;Happy 4 U&quot;, featured on the album &quot;The Forbidden World&quot; (2020).

Tituba is the protagonist of Maryse Condé&#x27;s 1986 novel, &quot;I, Tituba: Black Witch of Salem&quot;. The English translation includes a foreword by activist and academic Angela Y. Davis.

<text>Mithun Chakraborty (born Gouranga Chakraborty; 16 June 1950) is an Indian actor, film producer, screenwriter, entrepreneur and politician who predominantly works in Hindi and Bengali cinema. In a career spanning over five decades, he has done 350 films, mostly in Hindi and Bengali languages, and a few in Odia, Telugu, Kannada, Punjabi and Tamil. He is a former Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament. He is the recipient of three National Film Awards and four Filmfare Awards. In January 2024, Chakraborty was awarded Padma Bhushan, the third-highest civilian honour by the Government of India. He was also awarded India&#x27;s highest accolade in the field of cinema, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for the year 2022, whose announcement came from the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in September 2024. 

Chakraborty made his acting debut with the art house drama &quot;Mrigayaa&quot; (1976), directed by Mrinal Sen, for which he won his first National Film Award for Best Actor. Chakraborty gained greater fame with the 1982 film &quot;Disco Dancer&quot;, which was a major box office success in India and the Soviet Union. Besides &quot;Disco Dancer&quot;, Chakraborty also gained recognition for many other performances as both a lead and character artist. Chakraborty&#x27;s performance in &quot;Agneepath&quot; won him the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1990.

Chakraborty owns the Monarch Group, which has interests in the hospitality and educational sectors. He also started the production house Paparatzy Productions. In 1992, he, along with Dilip Kumar and Sunil Dutt, set up a trust to help actors in need of assistance called Cine &amp; T.V Artistes Association (CINTAA). He was also the Chairperson of Film Studios Setting &amp; Allied Mazdoor Union, which protects the welfare of cinema workers and resolves their demands and problems. The television show &quot;Dance India Dance&quot;, where Chakraborty was the Grand Master, also entered in the Limca Book of Records and the Guinness World Records. Chakraborty played a crucial mediating role between Pranab Mukherjee of the Indian National Congress and Mamata Banerjee, winning Mukherjee the support of Banerjee&#x27;s party, the All India Trinamool Congress, in the 2012 Indian presidential election. He joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on 7 March 2021, ahead of the 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election.

==Early life and education==
Mithun Chakraborty was born on 16 June 1950 into a Bengali Hindu family in Calcutta (now Kolkata), West Bengal, India to Basanta Kumar Chakraborty and Shanti Rani Chakraborty. He studied at Oriental Seminary and then earned his B.Sc. degree in Chemistry from Scottish Church College in Kolkata. After that, he attended and graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. He was a Naxalite before entering films, but tragedy struck his family when his only brother was electrocuted and killed in a freak accident. He returned to his family and left the Naxalite fold, even though this posed a grave risk to his own life. During his days as a Naxalite, he became friends with Ravi Ranjan, a popular Naxal figure, known to his friends as &quot;Bhaa&quot; (the ultimate saviour). Bhaa was known for his manipulative skills and oratory abilities.

==Film career==
===Early career (1976–1981)===
Chakraborty made his Hindi film debut in 1976 with Mrinal Sen&#x27;s art-house film &quot;Mrigayaa&quot;, for which he won the National Film Award for Best Actor. That same year, he played a brief role in Dulal Guha&#x27;s hit thriller &quot;Do Anjaane&quot; which had Amitabh Bachchan, Rekha and Prem Chopra in the lead. 

In 1978, Chakraborty made his debut in Bengali cinema with Arabinda Mukhopadhyay&#x27;s romantic blockbuster &quot;Nadi Theke Sagare&quot;. He also co-starred alongside Rameshwari in &quot;Mera Rakshak&quot;. A remake of R. Thyagarajan&#x27;s own directional venture &quot;Aattukara Alamelu&quot; (1977), it performed well commercially. In 1979, Chakraborty delivered another hit with Ravikant Nagaich&#x27;s spy thriller &quot;Surakksha&quot;. This was followed by a string of successful Hindi films, such as &quot;Taraana&quot; (1979), &quot;Patita&quot; (1980), &quot;Unees-Bees&quot; (1980), &quot;Hum Paanch&quot; (1980) and &quot;Hum Se Badkar Kaun&quot; (1981) and the Bengali film &quot;Kalankini Kankabati&quot; (1981).

===Stardom (1982–1995)===

In 1982, Chakraborty had a string of successes with &quot;Shaukeen&quot;, &quot;Ashanti&quot;, &quot;Taqdeer Ka Badshah&quot; and &quot;Swami Dada&quot;. He shot to superstardom in the same year with B. Subhash&#x27;s dance film &quot;Disco Dancer&quot;. &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; proved to be successful domestically and an All Time Blockbuster in overseas markets. It also became the first Indian film to do a business of . Its soundtrack composed by Bappi Lahiri was a huge chartbuster and played a big role in the box office success of the film, especially in countries like Soviet Union and China. The same year, he established himself in Bengali cinema as well with Gautam Mukherjee&#x27;s musical blockbuster &quot;Troyee&quot;. In 1983, he played lead roles in T. Rama Rao and Deepak Bahry&#x27;s ventures - &quot;Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye&quot; and &quot;Hum Se Hai Zamana&quot;, respectively and Basu Chatterjee&#x27;s critically acclaimed light-hearted romance &quot;Pasand Apni Apni&quot;. The following year, he appeared alongside Shashi Kapoor, Moushmi Chatterjee and Ranjeeta in the family drama film &quot;Ghar Ek Mandir&quot;. At release, it was thrashed by critics, but went on to become profitable at the box office. The huge box office success of &quot;Ghar Ek Mandir&quot; was followed by two successes in &quot;Jagir&quot; and &quot;Kasam Paida Karne Wale Ki&quot; alongside a decent runner &quot;Baazi&quot; to go with the major grossers. 

Chakraborty gained more recognition in 1985 with Vijay Sadanah&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Pyar Jhukta Nahin,&quot; acting opposite Padmini Kolhapure. The film opened to excellent audience response and went on to become a massive blockbuster. Its soundtrack composed by Laxmikant–Pyarelal dominated the musical charts and was the tenth best-selling Hindi film album of the 1980s. He followed it with a superhit in J. P. Dutta&#x27;s action drama &quot;Ghulami&quot; co-starring Dharmendra, Naseeruddin Shah, Reena Roy, Smita Patil and Anita Raj. His other major commercial success that year was another of B. Subhash&#x27;s directional venture &quot;Aandhi-Toofan&quot;. Chakraborty&#x27;s dream run continued in 1986 with the success of K. Bapayya&#x27;s family drama film &quot;Swarag Se Sunder&quot;, which also had Jeetendra, Jaya Prada and Kolhapure in the lead. That same year, he found success in Umesh Mehra&#x27;s actioner &quot;Jaal&quot;, followed by two more successful films, &quot;Dilwaala&quot; and &quot;Muddat&quot;. Apart from commercial success, he received acclaim for his performance in Basu Chatterjee&#x27;s &quot;Sheesha&quot;, which was the first Hindi film centred around sexual harassment at workplace. The following year, he starred in hits, including &quot;Dance Dance&quot;, &quot;Parivaar&quot; and &quot;Watan Ke Rakhwale&quot; alongside moderately profitable films, &quot;Hawalaat&quot; and &quot;Hiraasat&quot;. In 1988, Chakraborty reunited with K. Bapayya for &quot;Pyar Ka Mandir&quot;, co-starring Madhavi, Nirupa Roy, Sachin Pilgaonkar, Raj Kiran and Shoma Anand. The film performed very well at the box office and was declared a superhit by trade pundits. He then appeared alongside Sridevi and Moushmi Chatterjee in the action drama film &quot;Waqt Ki Awaz&quot;, which too went on to become a hit, followed by moderate successes in &quot;Charnon Ki Saugandh&quot; and &quot;Jeete Hain Shaan Se&quot;. 1989 also proved to be a big one for Chakraborty with four of his films emerging commercial successes, which were - &quot;Daata&quot;, &quot;Prem Pratigyaa&quot;, &quot;Mujrim&quot; and &quot;Aakhri Ghulam&quot;.

Chakraborty began the new decade with average fares, such as &quot;Pati Patni Aur Tawaif&quot; and &quot;Humse Na Takrana&quot;, while his most notable release of 1990 was Mukul Anand&#x27;s action crime film &quot;Agneepath&quot; alongside Amitabh Bachchan, which although a commercial failure, received highly positive response from critics and won him Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. For next two years, his successful films included &quot;Pyar Ka Devta&quot; (1991), &quot;Swarg Yahan Narak Yahan&quot; (1991), &quot;Dil Aashna Hai&quot; (1992) and &quot;Ghar Jamai&quot; (1992).

Chakraborty&#x27;s career as a matinee idol faded in the mid-1990s as he took a break from mainstream Hindi cinema and started working in low-budget productions, most of which lacked success due to their poor quality. Beginning from 1994, he starred in many such films, the majority of which performed miserably at the box office, with a few exceptions like &quot;Cheetah&quot; (1994), &quot;Jallaad&quot; (1995) and &quot;Ravan Raaj: A True Story&quot; (1995), which also proved to be his final successful film as a lead actor.

===Career fluctuations and return to prominence (1996–present)===
Post-stardom, Chakraborty continued to star in substandard productions which failed to propel his career forward. He appeared in hundreds of such films produced under his home banner Mithun&#x27;s Dream Factory. He was unable to accept the universally acclaimed Tamil film &quot;Iruvar&quot; (1997) as his character had to crop his hair, which would have affected his other 15 films at that time. By this time, Chakraborty held the record for appearing in the most Hindi films as a hero. During this phase, he saw moderate successes in &quot;Shapath&quot; (1997) and &quot;Chandaal&quot; (1998) and won the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actor for playing Ramakrishna Paramahansa in G.V. Iyer&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;Swami Vivekananda&quot; (1998).

With his Bollywood career taking a backseat, Chakraborty began to focus on Bengali films in the early 2000s. From 2000 to 2003, he appeared in highly acclaimed films like Nepaldev Bhattacharjee&#x27;s &quot;Chaka&quot; (2000), Rituparno Ghosh&#x27;s &quot;Titli&quot; (2002), Prasanta Bal&#x27;s &quot;Ferari Fauj&quot; (2002) and Narayan Rao&#x27;s &quot;Santrash&quot; (2003).

He returned to mainstream Hindi films in 2005 with the highly anticipated films &quot;Elaan&quot; and &quot;&quot;, but contrary to expectations, both the films proved to be critical and commercial duds and failed to re-establish him. He finally made a solid comeback in 2007 with Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Guru&quot;. &quot;Guru&quot; received highly positive response from critics and proved to be a commercial success at the box office. Chakraborty&#x27;s performance of an honest editor met with immense acclaim and he received a nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category. The same year, he also did a guest appearance in the song &quot;Deewangi Deewangi&quot; from Farah Khan&#x27;s reincarnation drama &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot;.

After another series of flops, he appeared in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s multi-starrer comedy &quot;Golmaal 3&quot; in 2010. It did a business of and was declared a &quot;Blockbuster&quot; by Box Office India. The huge success of &quot;Golmaal 3&quot; was followed by two more major hits in 2012 with &quot;Housefull 2&quot;, &quot;OMG – Oh My God!&quot;, as well as an average hit with &quot;Khiladi 786&quot;. Chakraborty had two full-fledged releases in 2013 - &quot;Enemmy&quot; and the much anticipated &quot;Boss&quot;, both of which were critical and commercial failures. He then played a supporting role in the Salman Khan action comedy film &quot;Kick&quot; (2014). The film took an initial of ₹260 million and collected by the end of its run, emerging a blockbuster at the box office.

In 2015, he made his Telugu and Tamil cinema debut with &quot;Gopala Gopala&quot; and &quot;Yagavarayinum Naa Kaakka&quot; respectively. While &quot;Gopala Gopala&quot; did well at the box office, the latter proved to be unsuccessful. That same year, he appeared in Vibhu Puri&#x27;s critically acclaimed historical drama &quot;Hawaizaada&quot; alongside Ayushmann Khurrana and Pallavi Sharda. He made his Kannada film debut with the successful action thriller &quot;The Villain&quot; in 2018. 

In 2019, Chakraborty played an important role in Vivek Agnihotri&#x27;s political thriller
&quot;The Tashkent Files&quot;. It received negative reviews from critics, but the audience reception was positive and as a result, it ran in cinemas for more than 100 days, eventually emerging as a sleeper hit at the box office. After a year&#x27;s gap, Chakraborty appeared in Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s horror thriller &quot;12 &#x27;O&#x27; Clock&quot;. In 2022, he starred in two notable box office successes, one in Hindi and one in Bengali. The first one was Agnihotri&#x27;s &quot;The Kashmir Files&quot; based on the Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus. Despite receiving polarizing response from reviewers, it grossed worldwide and was declared a major blockbuster by the end of its run. He received another nomination in the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor category for his performance of a retired IAS officer in &quot;The Kashmir Files&quot;. The next was Avijit Sen&#x27;s family drama &quot;Projapoti&quot; alongside Dev. This, too, emerged as a blockbuster at the box office. He made his digital debut in 2022 with Prime Video&#x27;s web show &quot;Bestseller&quot;. In 2023, he played the title role in Suman Ghosh&#x27;s hit Bengali film &quot;Kabuliwala&quot;. In 2024, he played the title role in Bengali film &quot;Shastri&quot; another release in 2024 was successful film Bengali film &quot;Shontaan&quot;.

==Television appearances==
After the success of the Bengali competitive dance reality show &quot;Dance Bangla Dance&quot;, Chakraborty developed the concept of Dance India Dance. This Indian dance competition show airs on Zee TV in India, is produced by UTV Software Communications, and has become India&#x27;s largest dance-based reality show. The contestants get a chance to perform before a panel of judges composed of Terrence Lewis, Remo D&#x27;Souza and Geeta Kapoor. The selection of the season&#x27;s Top 18 live show finalists is overseen by head judge Chakraborty. The show has won several television awards for most popular dance reality show. Chakraborty was also the Grand Master of &quot;Dance India Dance Li&#x27;l Masters&quot;, as well as the host of the reality show &quot;Dadagiri Unlimited&quot; on Zee Bangla channel.

<text>Newbury Park is a populated place in Ventura County, California, United States. 
Most of it lies within the western Thousand Oaks city limits, while unincorporated areas include Casa Conejo and Ventu Park. The town is located in Southern California around from the Pacific Ocean and has a mild year-round climate, scenic mountains, and environmental preservation. About 28,000 residents of Thousand Oaks reside in Newbury Park.

Newbury Park makes up around 40 percent of the total land area of Thousand Oaks. Lying within the Conejo Valley in the northwestern part of the Greater Los Angeles Area, Newbury Park abuts the Santa Monica Mountains. It is approximately 35 miles (56 km) from Downtown Los Angeles and less than 7 mi (11 km) from the Los Angeles County border in Westlake Village. The closest coastal city is neighboring Malibu which may be reached through winding roads, a bike path, or hiking trails crossing the Santa Monica Mountains. It makes up all of ZIP code 91320, and is within area code 805.

==Etymology==
Timberville was a 19th-century name for Newbury Park. Newbury Park is named after Egbert Starr Newbury, the founder of Newbury Park, who was also the first postmaster in the Conejo Valley in 1875. Egbert Starr Newbury called his ranch here &quot;Newbury Park&quot;, which became the name for the entire town.

Newbury had purchased 2200 acres of a former rancho in the Conejo Valley, but he and his family lived there for only six years. They returned to Michigan in 1877 because he was forced into bankruptcy due to crop and livestock losses after a protracted drought.

The Newbury Park Post Office has operated at numerous sites, but the Newbury Park name has survived, even though much of the area was incorporated into the city of Thousand Oaks.

Newbury had chosen the name &quot;Newbury Park&quot; for the US post office, as he felt the area looked like a park.

==History==
===Pre-colonial period===

Anthropologist John P. Harrington wrote, c. 1900, what he was told by the local Chumash people:
Early one morning in 9080 B.C., the ancestral grandfather from whom I took my name, headed west on one of his most adventurous hunting trips ever... As the group climbed Old Boney, they looked back to the north and could see the pleasant openings of the Conejo and Hidden Valleys. There, there appeared to be good grazing ground for the mammoth herd and they proceeded thence.

This story may be related to the lore about the Paleo-Indians, who are believed by some to be the distant ancestors of the Chumash. Mammoth fossils were unearthed in Newbury Park in 1961 and later in 1971. They are on display at the Stagecoach Inn Museum. The Newbury Park area is believed to have been inhabited by people of the Chumash culture for at least the past 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, or perhaps 10,000 years.

The Newbury Park area was previously the site of three Chumash villages: Satwiwa by the southern edge of town, and two villages located near today&#x27;s Ventu Park Road. These villages were settled 2,000 years ago, and had a population of 100–200 inhabitants in each village.

In addition, a large Chumash village was located just north of what is now known as Wildwood Regional Park in the Arroyo Conejo Open Space. Other nearby villages include Lalimanux (Lalimanuc or Lalimanuh) at the base of the Conejo Grade by westernmost Newbury Park, and Kayɨwɨš or Kayiwish (Kawyis) (CA-Ven-243), also near the Conejo Grade. This region contains numerous pictographs.

The Newbury Park area contains many ancient burial sites, most near the Santa Monica Mountains in the southern portion of the community. Many burial items have been discovered in the area, most notably by Rancho Sierra Vista in southern Newbury Park. Satwiwa, which is Chumash for &quot;the bluffs&quot;, was the name of a nearby village by the Big Sycamore Canyon. The canyon was a popular trading route for the Chumash and Tongva people, connecting the Conejo Valley to Mugu Lagoon through the Santa Monica Mountains.

Satwiwa is now protected as a part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. But the remains of two other Chumash villages are located on private lands by Ventu Park Road. These are known as CA-Ven-65, CA-Ven-261, and CA-Ven-260 near the fieldhouse in Newbury Park. At CA-Ven-261 is an ancient Chumash burial site, which suggests that the village existed here for a considerable time.
The Ventureño Chumash initially settled in the west end of the Santa Monica Mountains because of the abundant food supply. Roots, berries, seeds, bulbs, acorns and walnuts were plentiful in the region, and a variety of wildlife including birds, deer and squirrels made for good hunting. Shellfish and fish were transported from the nearby Mugu Lagoon across the Santa Monicas. The abundance of jackrabbits and other rabbit species were hunted widely for fur and meat. At one point, the Chumash here gathered a group of 27 men and killed hundreds of rabbits during a rabbit round-up, which was a significant event of late summers in the Conejo Valley.

Various Chumash artifacts from these older settlements, along with petroglyphs, have been found along the Arroyo Conejo, at Rancho Sierra Vista, and particularly in the Santa Monica Mountains.

The Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center and the Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park have displays based on some of these finds, as does the Chumash Indian Museum in Thousand Oaks.

In partnership with Friends of Satwiwa, in 1978 the National Park Service began talks of developing the current Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center and Natural Area. Boney Mountain in southern Newbury Park is identified as a sacred site for the Chumash, and nearby Satwiwa is frequently used by the Chumash Barbareño-Ventureño Band of Mission Indians for private events, such as traditional dances and sacred ceremonies.

===19th century===
When the Europeans first arrived in the Conejo Valley, they pressed plow to furrow and fields to barley and wheat. 
Newbury Park is named after its founder, Egbert Starr Newbury, who owned thousands of acres of land in the Conejo Valley and later became the first postmaster. E.S. Newbury, Howard Mills, and John Edwards were among the first to buy former Rancho El Conejo land in the early 1870s. El Rancho Conejo was an area which today encompasses most of the Conejo Valley and was named for its many rabbits. Its name derives from a Spanish land grant in California, encouraged by the Spanish- and Mexican governments.

Newbury and his wife Fannie moved to California from Michigan of health reasons in 1871. He later became the first postmaster in the Conejo Valley in 1875. The post office was near their house which was located at the current location of the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza. E.S. Newbury purchased 2,200 acres of land in 1874, which stretched from today&#x27;s old town Thousand Oaks and into Hidden Valley in southern Newbury Park. 
In the 1870s, Egbert S. Newbury and his wife Fannie moved full-time to their ranch in Conejo Valley which they named &quot;Newbury Park&quot; because the land looked so much like a park community. It consisted of his house, barn, and a guest house for visitors to &quot;enjoy the healthful climate&quot;, according to E.S. Newbury. The area was remote and only five families lived in the Conejo Valley at the time, all on large ranch lands. The ranches were miles apart and there were no grocery stores, medical facilities, schools, or churches in the valley. Newbury had acres of wheat and owned thousands of sheep. The weather had a great impact on his health, and he wrote to his sister Kittie in Michigan on November 23, 1874:

&quot;take wings and come to Conejo and enjoy our warm bright days all winter... be outdoors instead of confined indoors... I am out all the time and our drives now are just lovely with the country all turning green. The birds stay around our house in flocks all the time... Our roads to the ranch are splendid and they lie through beautiful canyons and large groves of live and white oak and sycamore, then into an open valley with slopes and surrounding hills covered with evergreen oaks...&quot;.
As a result of the increasing interest in the developing Conejo Valley, Newbury functioned as a public relations representative for the Conejo Valley. On December 25, 1875, E.S. Newbury wrote in the largest newspaper in Ventura County at the time, the &quot;Ventura Signal&quot;, the following words about Newbury Park:

&quot;Next to Ojai and Santa Ana ranchos, the Conejo mountain valley has the best reputation as a health resort. It is well fifteen miles from Port Hueneme. The soil is immensely fertile, producing large crops of wheat and other grain...&quot;.

Before Newbury Park existed, the Grand Union Hotel provided a stopover for travelers that dates back to 1876. The hotel was operated as a health- and pleasure resort, and provided a rest stop for stagecoach passengers and a gathering place for residents in Newbury Park.

The Conejo Valley pioneers were living in rugged individualism, where travelers had to make their journey over the Conejo Grade or Norwegian Grade to reach Camarillo where they could buy groceries. Newbury Park was an older settlement than Thousand Oaks, where people had settled wedged between Borchard lands on the south and Friedrich land on the north. The residents of the Conejo Valley had to travel to Oxnard for high school, burials or for marriages. 

As inhabitants of the valley had to travel to San Buenaventura (Ventura, CA) to get their mail, E.S. Newbury took the initiative to establish a local post office and applied to Washington, D.C. On July 16, 1875, the Newbury Park Post Office was established with E.S. Newbury as its first postmaster.

The Conejo School District was established in March 1877. At the time, the population was 126 in the Conejo Valley. E.S. Newbury and other residents of the Conejo Valley were unprepared for the 1876–78 drought. There were only six inches of rain in 30 months. The drought devastated Newbury Park and the valley. With no rain, the crops died and natural grasses as well, which were food for the ranchers&#x27; sheep. Egbert went bankrupt and decided to move with his family in 1877, and rode with his wagon and family back to Michigan where he ultimately settled in Detroit. On September 28, 1878, the land Egbert once called &quot;Newbury Park&quot; was sold at a sheriff&#x27;s sale. The post office remained its original name, despite having moved from its original destination, which is why Newbury Park has its name today.

===Modern history===

Newbury Park was a more established and older community than Thousand Oaks at the beginning of the 20th century.

In the early 20th century, Newbury Park had a few ranches and stores, wedged between Borchard lands to the south and Friedrich land on the north. During the 1940s, Ventu Park behind Newbury Park&#x27;s main street became a 500-acre real estate development. Lots sold to movie stars and others seeking a rustic retreat. One of the male members of the New York Rothschilds built a large home by Ventu Park and lived in relative seclusion here in the 1940s.

Prior to the 1960s, Newbury Park was never incorporated as its own city or municipality, it was unincorporated areas of Ventura County with little development. During the 1950s there were speculations persisting that Ventura County officials refused to allow Newbury Park to expand because of a feud with the would-be developers. Between 1950 and 1970, the Conejo Valley experienced a population boom, and increased its population from 3,000 to 30,000. 
Many Newbury Park residents did not want to be part of Thousand Oaks, and many residents fought to stop the incorporation in fear of losing the Newbury Park identity. Newbury Park had made failed attempts at creating its own municipality in the early 1960s, not only to create its own city, but to also remain independent of Thousand Oaks. A 1963 attempt at a cityhood election failed when the Janss&#x27;s Rancho Conejo Industrial Park and the Talley Corporation refused to join the efforts. Activist Reba Hays Jeffries of the Stagecoach Inn had a different explanation for interviewers when addressing why efforts at an independent municipality failed. She claimed the cityhood supporters were required to collect signatures from owners who represented 29% of the land area in Newbury Park. As the efforts collected signatures from 29% of registered voters, and not Newbury Park landowners, the petition never appeared on the ballot. Reba M.H. Jeffries was one of several opponents to the idea of annexation when it was first proposed in 1967. Jeffries feared for the identity of Newbury Park and was quoted in an interview saying: &quot;It&#x27;s a shame that the Thousand Oaks personality is overpowering to the extent that Newbury Park is losing its large ranches and freedom.&quot; Jeffries was also opposed to the proposition to demolish the Stagecoach Inn in 1964, and fought to keep the Newbury Park Post Office in town.

The City of Thousand Oaks was formally established on September 29, 1964, and throughout the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, most Newbury Park land was annexed by the City of Thousand Oaks. The annexed area was formerly controlled by Ventura County, but as of 2016, all but Casa Conejo and Ventu Park is within Thousand Oaks city limits. Together with Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park was part of a master planned community by the Janss Investment Company.

Newbury Park has had an increasing population due to the presence of biotechnology firms and technology corporations, such as Amgen (world headquarters) and Baxter, and other high-technology corporations.

President George W. Bush visited the Newbury Park High School and the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center in 2003.

====Housing====

The community contains two major new residential areas, Rancho Conejo Village (built on the site of the former Rancho Conejo Airport, where portions of the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot; were filmed) and Dos Vientos Ranch. The first planned community in Newbury Park was Casa Conejo, located in a roughly square-shaped unincorporated area.

==Geography==

Newbury Park can be described as a town, community, or section mostly within the Thousand Oaks city limits in addition to rural areas west of Thousand Oaks. Newbury Park is bordered by Lynn Road in the east and the Conejo Grade on the west. It borders the Santa Monica Mountains in the south, while Hill Canyon and the ridges of Conejo Canyons Open Space make up its northernmost area. It has an average elevation of above sea level, and is situated from the Pacific Ocean. Newbury Park is west of Los Angeles. It is situated in the southeastern corner of Ventura County, between the Santa Monica Mountains to the south, and protected nature areas such as Wildwood Regional Park to the north. Thousand Oaks proper is to the east and the city of Camarillo is down the Conejo Grade to the west. Newbury Park is made up of ZIP code 91320; however, certain post office boxes by Newbury Road use ZIP code 91319.

Compared to eastern part of Thousand Oaks, Newbury Park remains a significantly more rural community which includes for equestrian areas. The recreational areas accessible from U.S. Highway 101 include the Los Padres and Angeles National Forests. Being located less than six miles from the Los Angeles County line, Newbury Park is in the northwestern part of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Newbury Park is both a benefactor and a victim of the modern-day freeway development. It is a planned community, which originally solely functioned as a bedroom community. In recent times, however, Newbury Park has attracted numerous high-tech industries, keeping many of its former commuters home.

Newbury Park has three freeway exits on U.S. Route 101 (the Ventura Freeway). It can also be reached by crossing through the Santa Monica Mountains from the coast. The main road (Potrero Road) through Hidden Valley leads into Newbury Park. There are numerous trailheads including one into the Santa Monica Mountains that leads to the coast. There are also trailheads to Wildwood Regional Park with trails to other portions of Thousand Oaks and Moorpark.

The unincorporated county islands of Casa Conejo, Ventu Park and Kelley Estates are within Newbury Park. Street sign colors vary from unincorporated areas and areas incorporated into Thousand Oaks.

===Climate===
While the Conejo Valley is generally cooler than the San Fernando and Simi Valleys, the temperature remains temperate year-long in Newbury Park. The region has a mild, year-round Mediterranean climate or Dry-Summer Subtropical zone climate, with warm, sunny, dry summers and cool, rainy winters. Vegetation is typical of Mediterranean environments, with chaparral and grasses on the hillsides and numerous western valley oaks. Its elevation ranges from about (excluding hills). The area has slightly cooler temperatures than the surrounding areas, as it receives cooler air from the ocean through various hill and mountain passes.

Annual rainfall averages about ten inches in Newbury Park, while the humidity averages 52 percent. The temperature ranges from 55 to 77 degrees, and tends to be cooler than in neighboring Thousand Oaks.

There are typically at least a few days per year with lows below freezing, occasionally falling into the upper 20s.

On February 21, 2019, snow fell on the peak of Boney Mountain. Snow falls on the mountain approximately once every 10 years, previously occurring on December 17, 2008.

===Cityscape===

The physiography consists of prominent knolls, open vistas, surrounding mountains, and native oak woodland. It is characterized by its many rolling green hills. Businesses are centered on both sides of Ventura Freeway, which bisects the community. A number of businesses can for instance be found on Newbury Road, which is named after Egbert Starr Newbury, the founder of Newbury Park. The industrial area is centered around Rancho Conejo in northern Newbury Park, where corporations such as Amgen, Anthem Blue Cross, DesignworksUSA and Shire (formerly Baxalta) are located. The prominent 2,880 ft. Boney Mountain dominates the Newbury Park horizon from almost any angle.

Newbury Park is bounded by Malibu Coast AVA in the south, home of wineries such as SIP Malibu Grapes, Cornell Winery, and Malibu Family Wines.

===Natural hazards===

Some of the natural hazards include wildfires, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, landslides and erosion. The Conejo Valley is relatively often the victim of earthquakes, including the major 1994 Northridge earthquake. Along with most of Southern California, droughts are prevalent. The major drought of 1876–1878, with only six inches of rain in thirty months, devastated Newbury Park and forced its founder, Egbert Starr Newbury, to leave the area.

Two large fires have seriously threatened Newbury Park in recent years.

The Springs Fire started just west of Newbury Park, right off the U.S. 101 freeway, on May 2, 2013. It burned large portions of many of the hills and mountains surrounding the town, but no structures were lost in Newbury Park due to aggressive firefighting efforts. This fire was extinguished four days later, thanks to an unusual rainstorm falling in the area.

The Hill Fire and Woolsey Fire were separate fires which began within 23 minutes of one another on November 8, 2018. Both threatened many homes in Newbury Park, and while the Hill Fire was contained fairly quickly, the Woolsey fire rapidly got worse and destroyed large areas of southern California. Most of Newbury Park was evacuated for 2–3 days during these fires. Local schools were closed for 2 weeks, for the purpose of repair of smoke damage. No structures in Newbury Park were lost, partially due to aggressive firefighting, and also due to previous burn from the 2013 Springs Fire stopping the spread in that direction. These fires started just 15 hours after the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar and Grill, thus making it the most difficult day in the city&#x27;s history.

Newbury Park was also affected by the massive Thomas Fire of December 2017, and a smoke advisory was issued by the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. Subsequently, all public schools were closed on December 6, 2017. An additional 3-acre brush fire, nicknamed the Runner Fire, broke out behind the headquarters of Amgen and Shire (Baxalta) on December 5. Both Amgen and nearby SAGE Publishing decided to evacuate their employees due to thick smoke. The fire had a potential of reaching Hill Canyon due to the warm Santa Ana winds, but was contained before causing major damage or injuries.

===Geology===
Newbury Park is the westernmost community in the Conejo Valley, which is located in southern Ventura County. It is a broad, wide, and high-lying incline, with an average elevation of 900 feet above sea level. It is bordered by the steep ridge-lines of the Santa Monica Mountains to the south and southeast, Conejo Mountains to the west and north (including the Conejo Grade in westernmost Newbury Park), and the Simi Hills to the northeast.

While the Oxnard Plain and the community of Camarillo are immediately to the west, the Santa Rosa Valley is beyond the Conejo Mountains or through Hill Canyon to the north. Beyond the Santa Monica&#x27;s to the south is the Pacific Ocean, while the San Fernando Valley is beyond the valley&#x27;s eastern ridges. The physiography is characterized by open vistas, high peaks, creeks and creek-beds, prominent knolls, and native oak woodlands.

Along with the Santa Rosa-, Tierra Rejada- and Simi Valleys, the Conejo Valley is also drained by tributaries of the Calleguas Creek. Its principal tributary, Arroyo Conejo, flows through Newbury Park in a southwesterly direction before discharging into the Pacific Ocean by the Mugu Lagoon.

===Wildlife===

Being surrounded by open-space wilderness areas and wildlife corridors to both the south and north, the town is home to an abundance of wildlife. Compared to neighboring City of Thousand Oaks, which consists of nearly 50% developed area, Newbury Park remains a significantly more rural community than its counterpart to the east. Approximately 928 of the 63,000 acres compromising the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is located within Newbury Park. It is recognized as the largest urban national park in the United States and is a California wildlife preserve. Rancho Sierra Vista in southern Newbury Park is one of the primary park units and functions as a crucial Southern California wildlife-corridor. Wildlife in the southern edge of town is therefore incredibly abundant, and includes animals such as black bears, eagles, porcupines, deer, prairie wolves, rabbits, falcons, bobcats, foxes, hawks, and more.

The National Park Service estimates a population of 10–15 Mountain lions inhabiting the Santa Monica Mountains as of 2015, in addition to mountain lions living permanently in Wildwood Regional Park which borders the town to the north. As a result of bordering numerous wilderness areas, there are few dangers presented for the mountain lion, which is consequentially not a threatened species in the area. Because of their large habitat and few dangers, lions are relatively often creating a hazard in suburban areas of Newbury Park. The mountain lion is not the only mammal threatening both inhabitants and their pets, but outdoor dogs and cats are often prey for an increasing number of coyotes, bobcats, and owls. An increasing number of snake species in suburban areas have also recently been recorded and poses a threat to people and pets as well. Other animals posing potential danger includes venomous spiders and scorpions, most notably the Stripe-tailed scorpion.

Mammals more frequently encountered than the Mountain lion include the Valley coyote, Bobcat, Mule deer, Gray fox, Desert cottontail, Virginia opossum, California raccoon, Long-tailed weasel, American badger and the Striped skunk. Other species of mammals include the Ring-tailed cat, Spotted skunk, Botta&#x27;s pocket gopher, Brush rabbit, Broad-footed mole, California vole, Ornate shrew, and three species of squirrel: the California ground squirrel, Western gray squirrel, and Fox squirrel. Mice and rats include the California pocket mouse, House mouse, Western harvest mouse, Deer Mouse, Agile kangaroo rat, Pack rat, Dusky-footed woodrat, and the Brown- and Black rat. There are eleven recorded species of bats. Amphibians include the Blackbelly salamander, Ensatina, Western skink, and numerous toad- and frog species: California toad, American bullfrog, California treefrog and Pacific treefrog.

The Western pond turtle is an endemic species to the Arroyo Conejo and other creeks. Newbury Park is home to an abundance of reptiles, including lizards such as the Western fence lizard, Coast horned lizard, Common side-blotched lizard, Southern alligator lizard, Teiidae and the California legless lizard. There are eleven species of snake recorded in the Greater Thousand Oaks Area: Southern Pacific rattlesnake, Ring-necked snake, Western yellowbelly racer, California whipsnake, Coachwhip, Gopher snake, California kingsnake, Two-striped garter snake, Western Black-headed Snake, Lyre snake, and Night snake. Thousand Oaks proper is home to 171 recorded species of birds, including seventeen raptors such as the Barn owl, Cooper&#x27;s hawk, American kestrel, Prairie falcon, Red-shouldered hawk, Golden eagle, Great horned owl, White-tailed kite, California vulture, Northern harrier, Sharp-shinned hawk, Ferruginous hawk, Merlin and Screech owl. Commonly encountered bird species include the House sparrow, House finch, Brewer&#x27;s blackbird, Common raven, California towhee, Acorn woodpecker, California quail, and the Red-tailed hawk.

==Demographics==
According to the U.S. Census 2010, 76.81% of the population identify as White, 10.72% Asian-American, 1.88% African-American, 0.09% Native-American, and 6.78% claim &#x27;other&#x27;. 19.18% of the people in Newbury Park claim Hispanic ethnicity or heritage.

The median house value is $678,400.

==Economy==

Agriculture was the only industry present in Newbury Park for many decades, and dominated the economy until the 1950s. Today, most of the community is part of the City of Thousand Oaks, whose economy is based on a small range of businesses, with biotechnology, electronics, automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, healthcare, and financing occupying most of Thousand Oaks&#x27; employment sector. After the incorporation of large parts of Newbury Park, the City of Thousand Oaks helped revitalize sections of Newbury Park through the former Redevelopment Agency. The global headquarters of biotechnology firm Amgen, DesignworksUSA, as well as the industrial design and styling department of BMW are located in the community, as are offices for Anthem Blue Cross, SAGE Publishing, and Skyworks Solutions.

Amgen has its headquarters in Newbury Park, and is the world&#x27;s largest biotech company as well as the largest employer in the Conejo Valley. Founded in 1980, Amgen now employs nearly 7,000, and has attracted hundreds of scientists to the Newbury Park area. Focused on the cutting edge of molecular biology and biochemistry, its goal is to provide a healthcare business based on recombinant DNA technology. Besides Amgen, other major employers include Shire (formerly Baxalta), Baxter Bio Science, Wellpoint Blue Cross, Skyworks Solutions Inc., and many more. Hewlett-Packard was previously located here. Particularly during and after the 1960s, the area started to attract large corporations, biotechnology firms, and other high-technology industries. As a result of the steadily increasing number of high-technology industries in the area, Newbury Park has been dubbed &quot;the next Silicon Valley&quot;.

===Industry===

Northern Newbury Park, which had been land owned by the Janss Corporation since 1916, was zoned industrial and an industrial park started to appear here in 1954. A number of industries soon followed Talley Corporation&#x27;s 1954 move to Rancho Conejo, including Packard Bell, Westland Plastics and Technology Institute Corporation in 1960. Westinghouse Corporation moved to Rancho Conejo Industrial Park in 1961, while Northrop Ventura and North American Science Center moved here in 1963. Capitol Records opened its mail order center for all record club memberships in 1968, while Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) was planning to build a $30 million movie studio here in the late 1960s. Amgen, Anthem Blue Cross, Skyworks Solutions, SAGE Publishing, DesignworksUSA, Alcoa Fastening Systems &amp; Rings, Spectrum, Condor Pacific Industries, and Shire (formerly Baxalta) are some of the current corporations located in Rancho Conejo. Amazon opened a warehouse here in 2018.

As of 2017, Amgen employs 5,125 people, or 7.5% of Thousand Oaks&#x27; total employment. It is the largest employer in Ventura County.

<text>Karen Lee Orzolek (born November 22, 1978) is a South Korean-born American singer, musician, and songwriter. She is the lead vocalist of the indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

== Early life ==
Karen Lee Orzolek was born in Seoul, South Korea, the daughter of a Korean mother and a Polish father. The family eventually moved to Englewood, New Jersey, where she grew up and graduated from Dwight-Englewood School. About her childhood, she stated that &quot;it&#x27;s almost embarrassing how well-behaved I was, which is probably why I do things like spit water on myself on stage as an adult&quot;. She attended Oberlin College before transferring to New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts.

== Career ==
Karen O is best known as the lead vocalist for the band Yeah Yeah Yeahs. She has also been noted for her fashion, often wearing outfits made by her friend, fashion designer Christian Joy. In the early days of the band, she became well-known for her antics during live shows.

During a tour for the 2003 Livid Festival in Australia, at a sideshow at The Metro in Sydney, Karen O accidentally danced off the stage and was reluctantly taken to a hospital. A few days later, at the Sydney leg of the Livid Festival, she appeared in a wheelchair pushed onstage by Angus Andrew.

In 2007, Karen O was placed at number three on Spinner&#x27;s &quot;Women Who Rock Right Now&quot; list. The following year, she debuted a side project called Native Korean Rock with fellow New York City musicians, with two intimate performances at Union Pool in Brooklyn on July 21.

In 2009, she contributed backing vocals, screaming animal sounds and noises to the songs &quot;Gemini Syringes&quot;, &quot;I Can Be A Frog&quot; and &quot;Watching the Planets&quot; on The Flaming Lips&#x27; album &quot;Embryonic&quot;. In 2011, she contributed vocals on the song &quot;Pinky&#x27;s Dream&quot; on the David Lynch debut album &quot;Crazy Clown Time&quot;. In 2012, she collaborated with experimental rock group Swans on the song &quot;Song for a Warrior&quot; on their album &quot;The Seer&quot;. She also lends vocals to the song &quot;GO!&quot; on Santigold&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Master of My Make-Believe&quot;.

On the collaboration project with N.A.S.A. on &quot;The Spirit of Apollo&quot;, she appears on the track &quot;Strange Enough&quot;, together with Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard and Fatlip. Karen O&#x27;s vocal approach has been described as &quot;ethereal&quot; and has been described as &quot;yelping&quot; at times. She described her approach:

Karen O has also collaborated with James Iha on his second solo LP, &quot;Look to the Sky&quot;, in 2012. In 2014, her cover of &quot;A Marshmallow World&quot; was featured in Target&#x27;s holiday commercials. In 2015, her cover of Animotion&#x27;s &quot;Obsession&quot; was used as the opening theme for the Starz miniseries &quot;Flesh and Bone&quot;. On May 5, 2015, a song by Karen O in tribute to Nellie Bly was used as part of a Google doodle commemorating Bly&#x27;s 151st birthday. The same year, Microsoft approached Karen O to pen a theme song for Square Enix&#x27;s game &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider&quot;, which resulted in the song &quot;I Shall Rise&quot;.

=== Soundtrack work ===
Karen O was featured in the track &quot;Cut Me Up&quot; by Har Mar Superstar for the soundtrack to the 2005 horror film &quot;House of Wax&quot;. For the film &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, Karen O collaborated with electronic artist Peaches and Johnny Knoxville to record a track entitled &quot;Backass&quot;; for &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, she covered Roger Alan Wade&#x27;s &quot;If You&#x27;re Gonna Be Dumb&quot; under the alternative title of &quot;If You&#x27;re Gonna Be Dumb, You Gotta Be Tough&quot;. In 2007, she also contributed vocals to a version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; for the &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; film soundtrack. She performed a short song at the end of the &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; episode &quot;Brothers Cinco&quot;. She also performed the track &quot;Strange Love&quot; on the album &quot;Frankenweenie Unleashed! (Music Inspired by the Motion Picture)&quot;.

Karen O collaborated with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross on a cover version of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; for the soundtrack to the 2011 film &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;, for which Reznor and Ross composed the score.

==== Work with Spike Jonze ====
Karen O and Spike Jonze collaborated on a 2005 Adidas commercial, &quot;Hello Tomorrow&quot;, after Jonze had directed the video for the Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; 2004 single &quot;Y Control&quot;. Karen O composed all songs on the soundtrack of Jonze&#x27;s film &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (with the exception of a cover of the Daniel Johnston song &quot;Worried Shoes&quot;) in collaboration with Carter Burwell. She is listed on the soundtrack as &quot;Karen O and the Kids&quot;. The song &quot;All Is Love&quot;, written by Karen O and Nick Zinner and included in this soundtrack, was nominated for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the 2010 Grammy Awards.

Karen O also contributed &quot;The Moon Song&quot; to Jonze&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Her&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
Jonze shot the video for Karen O &amp; Danger Mouse&#x27;s &quot;Woman&quot; live in one take as the duo performed on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;.

=== Video work ===
In 2004, Karen O, using the moniker Marshmellow, directed the music video for &quot;We Fenced Other Gardens with the Bones of Our Own&quot; by Liars, fronted by her then-boyfriend Angus Andrew. The following year, she directed the &quot;Blessed Evening&quot; video for Foetus with her then-boyfriend Spike Jonze working as cinematographer. In 2006, she directed the Yeah Yeah Yeahs video for &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot;.

Under the moniker Kids with Canes, Karen O and her now-husband Barnaby Clay directed the music video for the Tiny Masters of Today song &quot;Hologram World&quot;, released in 2008. Karen O also contributed vocals to the song and served as choreographer of the video, in which she appears with Yeah Yeah Yeahs bandmates Nick Zinner and Brian Chase, as well as Mike D from the Beastie Boys, Gibby Haynes from the Butthole Surfers, Russell Simins from the Blues Explosion, and Sam James from The Mooney Suzuki.

=== &quot;KO at Home&quot; demo leak ===
On December 10, 2006, a home-recorded album titled &quot;KO at Home&quot; was leaked via an invite-only BitTorrent tracking site. The album, originally a personal gift to Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio, was discovered inside a suitcase that Sitek had left behind in a New York City apartment. The disc&#x27;s 14 tracks and scan of the cover (a photograph of Karen O with a poem written by Oscar Wilde on the back side of the photo) quickly spread. News sites broke the story of the leak when Sitek lashed out at the fan who leaked the demos. Eventually, Sitek followed up his comments with an apology letter. In response to the leak, Karen O said that &quot;shit happens&quot;, and although she was &quot;a little grossed out&quot;, she offered commentary on which of the songs she liked the most.

=== Solo career ===
Karen O&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Crush Songs&quot;, was released on September 9, 2014. It was released on Cult Records via Kobalt Label Services. On February 17, 2015, Karen O released a live album titled &quot;Live from Crush Palace&quot;, recorded during three shows at Hollywood Forever Cemetery&#x27;s Masonic Lodge in Los Angeles in September 2014. The album features live renditions of songs from &quot;Crush Songs&quot;, as well as &quot;Hideaway&quot; from &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; and &quot;The Moon Song&quot; from &quot;Her&quot;. On January 11, 2018, Karen O released the song &quot;Yo! My Saint&quot;, featuring guest vocals from Michael Kiwanuka, in support of Kenzo&#x27;s Spring Summer 2018 collection. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Karen O at number 184 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

== &quot;Lux Prima&quot; ==
&quot;Lux Prima&quot; is the collaborative album from Karen O and musician-producer Danger Mouse, released March 15, 2019. The two originally met to discuss collaboration in 2007 as mutual admirers, but did not collaborate until 2016 due to scheduling and availability, resulting in the album &quot;Lux Prima&quot; three years later.

=== An Encounter with &quot;Lux Prima&quot; ===

&quot;An Encounter with Lux Prima&quot; was an immersive art piece and communal listening experience soundtracked by Karen O and Danger Mouse&#x27;s collaborative album &quot;Lux Prima&quot;. The installation premiered at Los Angeles&#x27; Marciano Art Foundation in April 2019, where it played to sold-out audiences. The piece saw the duo collaborate with a number of artists, including creative director Barnaby Clay, sound designer Ren Klyce, lighting designer Tobias Rylander and visual artist Davy Evans, in collaboration with George Lucas&#x27; Skywalker Sound and Meyer Sound on audio design and build, as well as MSG&#x27;s Obscura Digital on projection mapping.

<text>Jamaica Hills is a small middle class neighborhood in the New York City borough of Queens. The neighborhood is surrounded by Hillcrest (at the Grand Central Parkway to the north), Jamaica Estates (at Homelawn Street, a continuation of Utopia Parkway, to the east), Jamaica (at Hillside Avenue to the south), and Briarwood (at Parsons Boulevard to the west). It is centered on the terminal moraine that runs the length of Long Island. Originally populated with people who left neighborhoods under ethnic transition, Jamaica Hills started to become more ethnically diverse after 1964. The population today is very mixed with a large South Asian population and smaller populations from the Caribbean, Central America, and China. Because of the opening of a Greek Orthodox church in the 1960s, many Greek immigrants also live in the area. Jamaica Hills is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 107th Precinct.

<doc id="1158902" wikidata="Q3739850" url="?curid=1158902" title="Abi Titmuss">
<text>Abigail Evelyn Titmuss (born 8 February 1976) is an English actress, television personality, and poker player. She is also a former glamour model and nurse.

==Early life and education==
Born in Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, Titmuss grew up in Ruskington, Lincolnshire; both of her parents were teachers.

At Kesteven and Sleaford High School, she played the clarinet, gaining GCSEs in Biology, English Language, English Literature, French, Maths, Physics, Religious Studies and Latin. Abigail did join the sixth form in September 1992, and by 1994, there is no record of her taking any A-levels at the Sleaford Joint Sixth Form.

When she was 17, her parents divorced and her father moved to Argyll, Scotland.

==Nursing==
Titmuss graduated from City University at the teaching hospital St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital in 1998. She completed a nursing diploma, because she &quot;was interested in becoming a doctor, but hadn&#x27;t taken A level Chemistry&quot; and became a staff nurse at London&#x27;s University College Hospital.

==Television and radio==
Titmuss was hired as a roving reporter on the Channel 4 programme &quot;Richard &amp; Judy&quot;, in late 2003, and stated at the time that the job was &quot;an absolute dream come true&quot;. She lost her job in January 2004 following allegations of group sex with her boyfriend John Leslie. A sex tape from four years earlier emerged, in which she had been privately filmed having sex with Leslie and Aisha Abubakar, an aspiring model. The footage was downloaded without permission from a private computer and made public by &quot;conman&quot; Jason Onabowale, subsequently convicted and sentenced to serve 18 years in jail for four counts of rape.

She appeared on &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; in 2004 and the following year appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot; as a regular guest; in &quot;Abi Titmuss: A Modern Day Morality Tale&quot;, a fly-on-the-wall documentary for Channel 4; and on ITV1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Love Island&quot;.

She starred on a celebrity edition of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; with Paul Ross, Lesley Joseph, Linda Lusardi and Rodney Marsh.

Titmuss appeared on the reality television series &quot;Deadline&quot; with Janet Street-Porter on ITV2. The show followed a number of celebrities as they attempted to produce a celebrity-based magazine each week, published as a supplement to &quot;Closer&quot;. Titmuss was the fourth celebrity to be sacked from the show.

She has guest-presented shows on Virgin Radio, MTV and LBC radio.

==Glamour==
Titmuss took up presenting on pornographic channel Television X; released a fitness video; put her name to an erotic novel published by Black Lace; and made personal appearances in nightclubs in the UK and Ireland. An initial offer of a photo shoot over two pages of &quot;FHM&quot; morphed into a three-page spread and a cover.

In December 2004, Titmuss appeared on the front cover of &quot;FHM&quot; again, with Swedish model Victoria Silvstedt, &quot;marking,&quot; as she wrote, &quot;the first time a girl was on the FHM cover twice in one year&quot;. In 2004 and 2005, she made a total of 38 front-page appearances on British men&#x27;s magazines, such as &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;Nuts&quot;, &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot;, &quot;Loaded&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Maxim&quot;. She also appeared in the &quot;Sunday Times Style&quot; section and in glamour pictures in several tabloid newspapers, including &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;News of the World&quot;, &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, &quot;The People&quot; and &quot;Daily Star&quot;.

In 2005, Titmuss was ranked seventh by readers in &quot;FHM&quot;″s list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World. She started writing a regular sex advice column for the magazine the same year. In 2005, Titmuss appeared in a high fashion shoot in &quot;Pop&quot; magazine, which commented on her status as the &quot;face of 21st century celebrity&quot;.

In her memoir, Titmuss states how she quickly realised that she wanted more control after seeing magazines pay her for one shoot and then sell the pictures many times over. Accordingly, she started paying for and directing her own shoots, thus owning the copyright over them and selling them herself, along with her manager.

After taking a break from modelling, Titmuss relaunched her glamour career in 2007, this time as a brunette, with an appearance on the cover of &quot;Zoo Weekly&quot; and the sale of the official &quot;Abi Titmuss Calendar&quot;.

After announcing in late 2007 that she would take a break from her glamour modelling career to concentrate on acting, Titmuss returned with a &quot;Nuts&quot; shoot in April 2009 to promote one more calendar.

==Acting==
Titmuss first acted during her university studies and then took part-time acting courses at the Central School of Speech and Drama, paid for from her nursing work. After reducing her glamour model work, Titmuss took a further short acting course at the same establishment. She also trained at Kensington and Chelsea College.

According to her memoir, the first West End theatre producer to audition her for a role was Marc Sinden:

In March 2006, Titmuss made her London theatre acting début at the Courtyard Theatre in King&#x27;s Cross, playing a prostitute with a multiple personality disorder in &quot;Two Way Mirror&quot; (a combination of the one-act plays &quot;Elegy for a Lady&quot; and &quot;Some Kind of Love Story&quot; by Arthur Miller); for which she won a Fringe Report Award for Best West End Début.

In 2006, Titmuss had a small role in the film &quot;Goal! 2&quot; and in the following year appeared in the second series premiere of &quot;Rob Brydon&#x27;s Annually Retentive&quot;, which aired on BBC Three; and as a character called Gezebelle in an episode of &quot;Katy Brand&#x27;s Big Ass Show&quot;, a sketch comedy series for ITV2.

Between 26 February and 23 March 2008, Titmuss appeared in the black comedy &quot;Fat Christ&quot; at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre in Islington, London.

She has been cast in small roles in the British independent films &quot;Do Elephants Pray?&quot; and &quot;Mixed Up&quot;. In 2008, she played the &quot;Mysterious Girl&quot; in the Beat 24 Films independent feature film &quot;Frontman&quot;.

In 2009, Titmuss was cast in the 25th anniversary production of John Godber&#x27;s play &quot;Up &#x27;n&#x27; Under&quot; at the newly refurbished Hull Truck Theatre, Hull. Titmuss played Hazel, the fitness instructor, starring alongside James Crossley (formerly the Gladiator &quot;Hunter&quot; in the British version of &quot;Gladiators&quot;) and soap actor Lewis Linford (&quot;Lee Naylor&quot; in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;). She also had a part in the BBC TV series &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;, playing a nun.

In November and December 2009, Titmuss appeared in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; with the Seagull Rep, playing the character of Lady Macbeth. The production opened at the Seagull Theatre in Lowestoft before transferring to other East Anglian venues.

In January 2015, Titmuss announced that she had changed her name to Abigail Evelyn, in the context of her relocation to Hollywood, California and her attempts to establish a new career as an actress. She made her U.S. acting debut as a nurse, on &quot;Days of Our Lives.&quot;

==Poker==
Titmuss started playing poker around 2001. In 2008, Titmuss played in &quot;Ante Up For Africa&quot;, a charity side-event of the World Series of Poker, in Las Vegas. Ladbrokes Poker started sponsoring her in 2005, when she appeared in the first Ladbrokes Poker European Ladies Championship.

==Publications==

In 2005, Titmuss produced a book, co-written with Jayne Lockwood, called &quot;Ten Fantasies&quot;, in which she revealed her &quot;ten most secret sexual fantasies.&quot; She stated that she did not want her mother to read it.

On 24 July 2008, her memoir, titled &quot;The Secret Diaries of Abigail Titmuss&quot;, on which she collaborated with &quot;Heat&quot; journalist Lucie Cave, was published by Headline Review. It was written in the form of a diary and is a day-to-day summary of her life for the previous six years. It includes an indepth look into the trial of Titmuss&#x27; then-boyfriend John Leslie, who had been accused of rape; her rise to fame; and how she dealt with the tabloids invading her life.

==Personal life==
Titmuss first came to public attention as the girlfriend of TV presenter John Leslie, whom she met in a Fulham bar on 10 April 1999. From 2007 to 2009, she was in a relationship with Marc Warren. In 2017, she married &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; co-star Ari Welkom. The couple have a son.

<doc id="1158905" wikidata="Q128495" url="?curid=1158905" title="Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)">
<text>Alpha 5 is a fictional character from the television series &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. A fully self-aware artificial intelligence, he is the robotic assistant of the Power Rangers, and resides in their base of operations, the Command Center along their mentor Zordon. The character is known for his &quot;Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!&quot; catchphrase.

Alpha 5 has been physically portrayed by multiple actors: Romy J. Sharf, Sandi Sellner and Donene Kistler in the television series, and Peta-Maree Rixon in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;. Richard Steven Horvitz voiced Alpha 5 for the character&#x27;s appearances in most &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise media, starting from &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; television series until &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;, which marked the character&#x27;s final appearance in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; television series. In the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character voiced by Bill Hader. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series&#x27; characters, has been released since the inception of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise.

==Character overview==
Alpha 5 appears as a recurring supporting character for the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; in the series. His role is to provide communications support for the Rangers on their missions and is responsible for maintenance of the Command Center. He also serves as the Rangers&#x27; technician, constructing weapons for them to use against their opponents. He is best known for his signature catchphrase, &quot;Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!&quot;, usually uttered by the character when he is distressed or excited. Alpha 5&#x27;s original iteration is described by Nicholas Mojica of &quot;International Business Times&quot; as a &quot;vintage robot look&quot;; his head is shaped like a golden flying saucer, adorned with a visor that flashes when he is speaking. Another one of the character&#x27;s visual cues is an inverted yellow stylized lightning bolt similar to the Power Rangers&#x27; lightning bolt symbol on his chest.

The character is depicted as naive and childlike in temperament, and often behaves like a surrogate younger sibling to the Power Rangers wanting to spend time with them.

==Creation and development==
Richard Horvitz, credited as &quot;Richard Wood&quot; for the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series, developed Alpha’s catchphrase when the series was in development. Horvitz also voiced Alpha 5&#x27;s future successor, Alpha 7, in the &quot;Power Rangers Wild Force&quot; episode Forever Red.

Romy J. Sharf physically portrayed Alpha 5 for 89 episodes of the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; series as well as the &quot;Alpha’s Magical Christmas&quot; holiday special. Sandi Sellner took over the role for 45 episodes in seasons 2 and 3. Donene Kistler, who also worked as a production assistant on the series, assumed the role for the remainder of Alpha 5&#x27;s appearances in the series. Kistler would go on to portray Alpha 5&#x27;s successor, Alpha 6, for &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot; and &quot;Power Rangers In Space&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;===

Alpha 5 debuted in the first episode of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; and provides a support role for the titular protagonists. Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In &quot;Green with Evil: Part 1&quot;, Rita sent the brainwashed Green Ranger to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a virus-infected CD-ROM into Alpha&#x27;s inner workings, which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuitry and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a force field, but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon&#x27;s instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the &quot;Singing Squash&quot; to undo a spell placed on Kimberly and Billy. he encountered Rita&#x27;s Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash.

In the second season of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;, Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd&#x27;s forces. In &quot;The Wannabe Ranger&quot;, he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self-destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers to do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and Goldar, but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in &quot;The Wedding&quot;, he was ambushed by Finster and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha&#x27;s circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha&#x27;s personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon&#x27;s pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon&#x27;s image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.

In the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the Andromeda constellation by King Lexian, the grandfather of the Masked Rider. The Power Rangers, minus a sick Kimberly, later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.

===&quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;===

Alpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by Rito and Goldar, though the duo&#x27;s second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center&#x27;s basement to place Lord Zedd&#x27;s detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5&#x27;s obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4&#x27;s body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.

===&quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot;===

Alpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of &quot;Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers&quot;, as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the Power Chamber. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the Power Rangers Zeo) as they battled the Machine Empire. A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.

===&quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot;===

When Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in &quot;Shift Into Turbo&quot;), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in &quot;Passing of the Torch&quot;, in which Tommy, Adam, Kat, and Tanya retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode &quot;The Robot Ranger&quot;.

==Reception==
Alpha 5 is noted as a &quot;beloved&quot; and &quot;lovable&quot; comic relief character of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise by various sources. Joe Anderton from &quot;Digital Spy&quot; opined that while Alpha 5 looked like he was &quot;made out of whatever props they could find&quot;, to him the character&#x27;s &quot;goofy little walk and head tilt made him feel human and relatable, as if those blinking red lights were eyes&quot;. Jessica Lachenal from &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; thought Alpha 5&#x27;s appearance, which resembled a Geordi La Forge-style visor which light up whenever he speaks, was &quot;adorable&quot; and &quot;endearing&quot;.

==In other media==
===Movies===
====&quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; ====

Peta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot;. Like the film&#x27;s other character costumes, the Alpha 5 suit Rixon donned was specifically designed for the movie.

====&quot;Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie&quot;====

In &quot;Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie&quot;, Alpha gains a new, streamlined body. His plating appears to be more reflective, and his lightning bolt was now an arrow pointing straight down.

====&quot;Power Rangers (2017 film)&quot;====
In the 2017 reboot film, Alpha 5 is a CGI character portrayed by Bill Hader. Hader acted out Alpha 5&#x27;s movements in a motion-capture suit, and provides the voiced dialogue for the character in the recording booth. To promote the film, Lionsgate launched a &quot;chat bot&quot; app, which features a completely personalized, spontaneous chat with Alpha 5. The app was cross-platform, enabling app users to chat with Alpha 5 on either Facebook Messenger, Kik, or Twitter in the role of a potential Power Ranger candidate, and receive exclusive content for the film as reward for the interaction.

The film&#x27;s iteration of Alpha 5 has a bio-mechanical look that uses darker hues of the original design&#x27;s red and blue colors, with a pair of eye stalks dangling from the saucer-shaped head as opposed to a visor. Like his original TV series iteration, Alpha 5 is an android aide of Zordon; however, he has a less convivial relationship with the teenagers and is skeptical of their competence as the new Power Rangers.

Alpha 5&#x27;s drastically different design from the original iteration received a mixed response, with some journalists labeling it &quot;weird&quot;, &quot;horrifying&quot;, or &quot;nightmarish&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;International Business Times&quot; both reported on strong disapproval from series fans in response to the reveal of Alpha 5&#x27;s redesign. Phillip Martinez from &quot;Player One&quot; dissented and opined that the redesign, though aesthetically jarring, matched the visual language of the film&#x27;s &quot;Power Rangers&quot; iteration.

The decision to cast Hader as Alpha 5 was mostly well received by journalists. Jacob Stolworthy from &quot;The Independent&quot; considered the casting to be &quot;odd&quot;. Joshua Rivera from GQ Magazine expressed his concerns about the film&#x27;s creation direction, and wondered if Hader would adopt Alpha 5&#x27;s &quot;classic high-pitched fretting&quot;, Alpha 6&#x27;s &quot;weirdly nasal Long Island stylings&quot;, or if he would approach the role as the &quot;latest Stefon joint&quot;. Andy Webster, in a review of the 2017 film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, commented that &quot;Hader&#x27;s dialed-down take&quot; of the character &quot;reflects the movie&#x27;s tempered refinement of the original&quot;.

===&quot;Alpha&#x27;s Magical Christmas&quot;===
Alpha 5 is the main character of &quot;Alpha&#x27;s Magical Christmas&quot;, a direct-to-video musical Christmas special produced during Season 2 of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot;. The Rangers are away at the North Pole assisting Santa Claus in preparation for the Christmas holidays, while Alpha remains with Zordon for Christmas at the Command Center. Despite Zordon&#x27;s presence, Alpha feels miserable from his loneliness. Zordon cheers Alpha up by presenting a Christmas tree to him, then follows that up by teleporting a group of children to the Command Center to sing Christmas carols with Alpha. Together they sing such carols as &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;, &quot;Deck the Halls&quot;, &quot;Here We Come A-Caroling&quot;, &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot;. After the children leave via the &quot;magical portal&quot;, Tommy, Kimberly and Billy teleport to the Command Center in their ranger suits, and the cast perform &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; to end the special.

===Comics===
Alpha 5 appears as a recurring character in the &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; comic series, published by Boom! Studios. One storyline even introduces Alpha&#x27;s predecessor, Alpha One, who is more willing to resort to ruthless tactics in the name of victory where Zordon and Alpha 5 prefer a less ruthless approach.

==Promotion and merchandise==
Like many &quot;Power Rangers&quot; series characters, various merchandise has been made of Alpha 5 since the inception of the franchise.

<doc id="1158906" wikidata="Q272374" url="?curid=1158906" title="Susanna Hoffs">
<text>Susanna Lee Hoffs (born January 17, 1959) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actress. With Debbi Peterson and Vicki Peterson, she founded the Bangles in 1981. Their debut album, &quot;All Over the Place&quot; (1984), was acclaimed by critics but sold poorly. Their second album, &quot;Different Light&quot; (1986), was also warmly received by critics and was certified double-platinum in 1987 and triple-platinum in 1994. It contained the US number two single &quot;Manic Monday&quot; written by Prince and the number one single &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot;. The group&#x27;s third album, &quot;Everything&quot; (1988), included the US top ten charting &quot;In Your Room&quot; and number one &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, both written by Hoffs with Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. Hoffs was lead vocalist on five of the seven singles released by the Bangles, resulting in her being seen as the face of the group, even though all four members shared lead vocal duties. Following tensions including resentment at Hoffs&#x27; perceived leadership and the stress of touring, the band split in 1989. It reformed in 1999 and released the albums &quot;Doll Revolution&quot; (2003) and &quot;Sweetheart of the Sun&quot; (2011).

Hoff&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;When You&#x27;re a Boy&quot; (1991), was followed by &quot;Susanna Hoffs&quot; (1996). Neither of the releases proved to be as popular as the Bangles&#x27; albums, although they yielded two charting singles in the US, the top 40 hit &quot;My Side of the Bed&quot;, and &quot;All I Want&quot;. She recorded several songs for films and formed the faux-British 1960s band Ming Tea with Mike Myers and Matthew Sweet. Hoffs teamed with Sweet to produce &quot;Under the Covers&quot;, a series of cover song albums. Her 2012 album &quot;Someday&quot; was followed by two more cover albums &quot;Bright Lights&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Deep End&quot; (2023).

Hoffs&#x27; first novel, &quot;This Bird Has Flown&quot;, a romantic comedy about a struggling musician, was published by Little Brown in 2023. It received favorable reviews, and Universal Pictures purchased the rights to the novel for a screen adaptation.

==Early life==
Susanna Lee Hoffs was born in Los Angeles, California, on January 17, 1959. She is the daughter of film director/writer/producer Tamar Ruth (née Simon) and Joshua Allen Hoffs, a psychoanalyst. Her family is Jewish. She has two brothers, John and Jesse. She has said that her home environment &quot;wasn&#x27;t really traditional&quot; and that it was an &quot;atheist, intellectual, creative world&quot;. She said that while her mother was religious and kept kosher, her father was secular. Her maternal grandfather, Ralph Simon, was a rabbi in Chicago and her maternal uncle, Matthew Simon, was rabbi emeritus for the B&#x27;nai Israel Congregation of Maryland and marched with Martin Luther King Jr. during the Civil Rights movement. Hoffs visited Israel for the first time at the age of 12 to see her grandparents, and she celebrated her bat mitzvah at the King David Hotel in Jerusalem.

Hoffs took ballet classes as a child, and started playing guitar in elementary school, learning chords from her uncle. She attended Palisades High School, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art in 1980 from the University of California, Berkeley, where she switched majors between dance, theater, film, and art. While in college, she worked as a production assistant and made her acting debut as part of a cast that included Richie Davis, Rae Dawn Chong, and Dennis Franz, in the 1978 film &quot;Stony Island&quot; directed by Andrew Davis and co-written by her mother. With college friends, she attended the final Sex Pistols show at Winterland Ballroom, and a Patti Smith concert that inspired her to pursue a career in music.

In the late 1970s, while a student at UC Berkeley, Hoffs and her then-boyfriend David Roback formed the Psychiatrists, later changing their name to the Unconscious. In one account, Hoffs said that the short-lived group would perform for 50 minutes, to reflect the duration of &quot;psychiatrists&#x27; hours&quot;, but in a 2012 interview she said that this early group never performed in public.

==The Bangles==
===The Bangs: first releases and name change===

There are different accounts of how Hoffs met the other members of the Bangles. She either posted an ad in a local newspaper and left flyers at the Whisky a Go Go at a Go-Go&#x27;s concert in search of potential bandmates, or answered an ad asking for musicians to join a group. In the second scenario, the woman who advertised had previously been in a group with sisters Vicki and Debbi Peterson and shared a house with them. Hoffs elected to form a group with the Petersons rather than with the original advertiser, and they started the band in Hoffs&#x27; parents&#x27; garage in Brentwood, which had been refurbished as an apartment for Hoffs.

The band was originally called the Colours, but changed it to the Supersonic Bangs after Hoffs saw an article about 1960s hairstyles in an old copy of &quot;Esquire&quot;, and subsequently to the Bangs. Hoffs said that the group &quot;liked the double-entendre of the name&quot; and that &quot;you can read a lot into it. There was something kind of gutsy about it.&quot; Annette Zilinskas joined as the bass player alongside Hoffs on rhythm guitar, Vicki Peterson on lead guitar, and Debbie Peterson on drums. The group&#x27;s influences included the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and the Hollies. Hoffs and the Petersons shared lead vocals. She said that the band&#x27;s first &quot;real performance&quot; was at Laird International Studios, where Vicki worked as a secretary. They played other venues in Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley, and recorded &quot;Getting Out of Hand&quot; released on their own label Downkiddie in 1981, pressing 1,000 copies. In a 1987 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; article, the critic Susan Orlean described the band&#x27;s early audience as &quot;mostly boys, who appreciated their tough-enough music and playfully flirtatious stage presence&quot;. Author James Dickerson later characterized the group&#x27;s loyal audience as &quot;made up of horny high-school and college-age males who relished their in-your-face sexuality&quot;, and commented that the musicians had gained their success through their own efforts, without intervention from any man.

Miles Copeland of I.R.S. Records saw the Bangs at a show and signed them to his Faulty Products label. He had previously signed the Go-Go&#x27;s, likewise an all-female band, whose albums had been commercially successful. In 1982, following a legal claim by another group called the Bangs, Hoffs and her bandmates changed their name again to the Bangles. Meanwhile, Faulty Products folded, and the band&#x27;s self-titled EP was eventually released on I.R.S. Records in 1982. In 1983, the group was signed to Columbia Records, and Zilinskas left and was replaced by Michael Steele. Hoffs played a role in the short comedy film, &quot;The Haircut&quot; (1982), starring John Cassavetes.

===Critical and commercial success===
The Bangles released their first full album, &quot;All Over the Place&quot;, in 1984 on Columbia Records; it was acclaimed by critics but sold poorly. Their breakthrough was the 1986 single &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, written by Prince, which reached number two on the charts in the US, the UK, West Germany and Austria, as well as reaching number one in South Africa and the top five in Sweden, Switzerland and Norway. This single was included on the album &quot;Different Light&quot; (1986), which was warmly received by critics and was certified double-platinum in 1987, then triple-platinum in 1994. &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; from the same album reached number one in the US in December 1986, and was their first American gold record single. It also became number one in the charts for Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, and West Germany. Dickerson wrote that &quot;Manic Monday&quot; and &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot; were more appealing to women and girls than the band&#x27;s previous records had been. Hoffs first met Prince in 1984 and the pair spoke regularly. He attended some of the group&#x27;s concerts and occasionally appeared on stage with them. Paul Evans and Ernesto Lechner of &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) wrote that Hoffs had &quot;mastered a singing style that combined pep, coy sweetness, and an occasional plaintive resonance&quot;.

In the music video for &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian&quot;, during a close-up of Hoffs&#x27; face, she moves her eyes from side to side. Hoffs recounted that she had been looking at selected members of the crowd to counter stage fright, and had not realized it would be a focal point in the video. Tom Breihan of Stereogum wrote of the scene: &quot;But it&#x27;s so . It makes her look like she&#x27;s up to some mischief.&quot; The television director Marty Callner later said: &quot;I saw situations where one shot would make a star, like with Susanna Hoffs and &#x27;Walk Like an Egyptian.&#x27; That thing she did with her eyes.&quot; In 2011, she said: &quot;I guess it&#x27;s become an iconic moment in that video, and I didn&#x27;t even realize it was happening.&quot;

A 1986 London performance by the Bangles was reviewed by David Sinclair of &quot;The Times&quot;, who felt that the band &quot;proved unconvincing in performance&quot;, although Hoffs &quot;was by and large the best at creating a mood of emotional involvement. Her clear, fragile voice and coquettish enunciation were reminiscent of Stevie Nicks.&quot; In the same paper a few months later, Richard Williams also compared Hoffs to Nicks, writing that Hoffs&#x27; &quot;dark eyes, dangerous pout and fancifully sexy costumes [that] match her sultry voice&quot; were reminiscent of the Fleetwood Mac singer. He concluded that Hoffs was &quot;an equally obvious candidate for a successful solo career&quot;.

The Bangles had another US number two single with a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; released in late 1987 and reaching its peak position in February 1988. Following a successful tour, the group issued their third and final Columbia album &quot;Everything&quot; in 1988. The first single, &quot;In Your Room&quot;, co-written by Hoffs with Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly, became a US top ten hit. The same album included their second US number one, and second American gold record single, &quot;Eternal Flame&quot;, which was also co-written by Hoffs, Steinberg and Kelly. The single also topped the chart in eight other countries. Hoffs sang the studio recording of &quot;Eternal Flame&quot; naked due to producer Davitt Sigerson pranking her by telling her Olivia Newton-John had done the same thing. He later told Hoffs he had just been pulling her leg. As the studio was dark, and Hoffs was standing behind a sound baffle, she could not be seen.

Hoffs was lead vocalist on five of the seven Columbia singles by the Bangles, leading to a public perception that she was the primary singer and face of the group, even though all four members shared lead vocals, and Steele and Peterson did most of the talking between songs in concert. As she was shorter in height than the other band members, photographs tended to feature her at front. She was the lead actress in &quot;The Allnighter&quot; (1987) and gained Prince&#x27;s attention. Orlean wrote that the cumulative effect was to &quot;vault Susanna into beyond-Bangles celebrity status&quot;.

===Disbandment and aftermath===
In 1989, while still popular, the Bangles disbanded to undertake individual projects. There had been tensions and disquiet in the group since &quot;Different Light&quot;; they saw themselves as musical creators, but their biggest successes had been versions of songs written by others. The public perception of Hoffs as bandleader took a toll on group harmony. In an interview for a 2002 book, Hoffs pinpointed the stress of touring as the breaking point. In her account, she recalled that the band members were tired and reluctant to tour, but agreed to do so at the behest of their management and record company, and in response to demand from their fans. According to the book&#x27;s authors Lee Miller and Jessica Miller, &quot;The situation deteriorated so badly that they canceled the tour abruptly and the band split up. Susanna always blamed the stress of that final tour for the breakup&quot;.

Hoffs contacted the other members of the Bangles in the late 1990s with the hope of reuniting. In 2008, she told Andrew Murfett of &quot;The Age&quot;: &quot;I wanted to do new Bangles music. I was driving the other girls crazy calling them. I didn&#x27;t want to be a &#x27;greatest hits&#x27; band. I wanted to write and sing new songs. That was really important to Vicki and Debbie, too. We didn&#x27;t want to go on a &#x27;Ladies of the 1980s&#x27; tour.&quot; The reunited Bangles played at a Beatles tribute concert conducted by George Martin, and recorded the single &quot;Get the Girl&quot; for the second &quot;Austin Powers&quot; film in 1999. In 2000 they announced their decision to reunite full-time. Hoffs recounted that following the experiences that led to the group disbanding in 1989, the band members agreed that each would have a veto on the group&#x27;s proposed activities. Their fourth album, &quot;Doll Revolution&quot;, was released in 2003; it received positive reviews, and sold moderately well. The group embarked on a tour following its release. Their fifth album, &quot;Sweetheart of the Sun&quot;, was released in 2011; it received an average score of 69 on review aggregator site Metacritic, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Evans and Lechner felt that the band &quot;achieved gigantically the dubious triumph of sound over significance&quot;, and of the &quot;inevitable reunion&quot; that &quot;even nostalgia has its limits&quot;. Robert Christgau rated all of the albums from their first incarnation B− or above and gave &quot;Doll Revolution&quot; three stars.

==Solo career==
Hoffs contributed lead vocals to covers of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; and Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot; on Rainy Day&#x27;s 1984 self-titled album. Led by the musician David Roback of Unconscious and later Mazzy Star, the project also included Vicki Peterson and members of other Paisley Underground bands including Dream Syndicate, the Three O&#x27;Clock, and Rain Parade. &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; was issued as the A-side of Rainy Day&#x27;s only single.

In 1987, Hoffs starred in the comedy &quot;The Allnighter&quot;, directed by Tamar Simon Hoffs, which also featured Joan Cusack and Pam Grier. Glenn Kenny wrote in &quot;Video Review&quot; that Hoffs&#x27; character was &quot;full of spunk&quot; like her Bangles persona, but less &quot;savvy&quot;, concluding that the film was &quot;unextraordinary and inoffensive&quot;. While he felt that Hoff&#x27;s acting abilities were on a par with her more seasoned colleagues in the cast, Patrick Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; argued that &quot;It&#x27;s her character we have trouble with&quot;, and disparaged the film. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin panned the work as &quot;outstandingly dim&quot;. The film was also dismissed by Richard Harrington in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, who wrote that she appeared &quot;stiff [and] self-conscious&quot;. It was commercially unsuccessful. Hoffs said she expected it to fare better as a home video, as the production was more suitable for home than cinema viewing. She later told journalist Chris Hunt: &quot;It was such a low budget quickie thing, a cutesy little teeny-bopper movie. It wasn&#x27;t a great movie but the whole experience of it was great.&quot;

In 1991, Hoffs released her first post-Bangles solo album, &quot;When You&#x27;re a Boy&quot;. It begins with the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 40 single &quot;My Side of the Bed&quot;, which also charted in the UK at number 44. It includes the track &quot;Unconditional Love&quot; and ends with a cover of &quot;Boys Keep Swinging&quot;, the 1979 song written by David Bowie and Brian Eno. The album was a critical failure; it reached number 83 in the US album charts and number 56 in the UK album charts. In &quot;The Times&quot;, Sinclair felt that with the exception of the Bowie cover, the album was an &quot;airbrushed exercise in boredom&quot;. It was rated as a &quot;dud&quot; by Christgau. In &quot;The Encyclopedia of Popular Music&quot; (2006), Colin Larkin gave the album 2 out of 5 stars, and argued that it &quot;failed to maintain the interest of the mainstream fans who had discovered the Bangles in the wake of the smash single &#x27;Eternal Flame&#x27;, while simultaneously alienating the Paisley Underground loyalists with its AOR Adult-oriented rock] clichés&quot;. &quot;The Trouser Press Record Guide&quot; entry by Ira Robbins panned the album as a &quot;no-holds-barred commercial bore&quot;. One upbeat assessment was provided by Alan Neister of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, who found the album as good as the Bangles&#x27; best work: &quot;Both as a songwriter and a song consumer, Hoffs has an ear fine-tuned to a great hook, and there isn&#x27;t a song on this album that isn&#x27;t hummable on the very first listen.&quot; Jimmy Nicol of &quot;Q Magazine&quot; gave the album four out of five stars and wrote that Hoffs was extending into &quot;undreamed of territories&quot;, adding &quot;She reveals herself to be a highly inventive composer, lyricist – and even humourist&quot;.

Her second solo album, &quot;Susanna Hoffs&quot;, was issued on London Records in 1996. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised it as an &quot;infectious and engaging set of melodic pop that also happens to be Hoffs&#x27; most introspective and personal record to date&quot;. Wook Kim of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; remarked that Hoffs &quot;performs a small act of bravery&quot; yet Larkin wrote that only one song, &quot;King Of Tragedy&quot;, &quot;had the edgy pop fizz of the Bangles&#x27; best work&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewed the single, &quot;Only Love&quot;, writing: &quot;Energetic and harmonious ditty recalls heyday of &#x27;60s-era girl groups. Lots of fun.&quot;

Hoffs covered the Oingo Boingo song &quot;We Close Our Eyes&quot; for the &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; film soundtrack in 1992, and provided the title song for the 1995 film &quot;Now and Then&quot;. She also recorded her versions of Burt Bacharach songs for the soundtracks of two Austin Powers films – &quot;The Look of Love&quot; appears on the soundtrack of the first film in 1997, &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; and &quot;Alfie&quot; is on the soundtrack of the third, &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;. Hoffs also contributed covers of &quot;The Water Is Wide&quot; and Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Catch the Wind&quot; for the soundtrack of Tamar Simon Hoffs&#x27; 2003 film &quot;Red Roses and Petrol&quot;.

Hoffs self-released her third solo album of new material (and her first full album since 1996), &quot;Someday&quot;, on her Baroque Folk label on July 17, 2012. It was distributed by Vanguard Records. &quot;American Songwriter&quot; gave &quot;Someday&quot; a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars and described it as &quot;easily and undeniably Hoffs&#x27; most definitive musical statement to date&quot;. James Reed from the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Someday&quot; reminds you that Hoffs is perfectly suited to sunny, winsome material... her performance on &quot;Someday&quot; isn&#x27;t that removed from how she sounded on say, &#x27;Eternal Flame&#x27;.&quot; The tracks include a newly recorded version of &quot;November Sun&quot;, which Hoffs had initially recorded for another unrealized album project in 2000. Produced by Mitchell Froom, the album is influenced by the music of the 1960s and features Davey Faragher and Pete Thomas from Elvis Costello&#x27;s band, the Imposters, and keyboards and orchestration by Froom. Larkin wrote: &quot;The Bangles folded in 1989 partly because Susanna Hoffs was being touted as the &#x27;star&#x27; in a previously egalitarian band. It is ironic, therefore, that her solo career failed to come close to the success enjoyed by her old band.&quot; Hoffs contributed vocals to &quot;One Voice&quot;, the end credits song for the film &quot;A Dog Named Gucci&quot; (2016), a track also featuring Norah Jones, Aimee Mann, Lydia Loveless, Neko Case, Brian May and Kathryn Calder. &quot;One Voice&quot; was released on Record Store Day, April 16, 2016, with profits from the sale of the single going to benefit animal charities. 

&quot;Bright Lights&quot;, Hoffs&#x27; fourth studio album, was released on Baroque Folk Records in 2021. The record was produced by Paul Bryan and features versions of songs by Nick Drake, Michael Nesmith, Richard Thompson, Pete Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger, and other songwriters. The album includes &quot;Name of the Game&quot;, featuring Mann. Jonathan Keefe of &quot;In Review Online&quot; wrote, &quot;Hoffs is in fantastic voice throughout the album&quot; and praised the versatility of her renditions.

Her fifth solo album, 2023&#x27;s &quot;The Deep End&quot;, was produced by Peter Asher; The album includes interpretations of songs by the Rolling Stones, Squeeze, and Lesley Gore and received favorable reviews; Lily Moayeri of &quot;Spin Magazine&quot; wrote, &quot;Hoffs&#x27; voice is immediately recognizable, clear and sweet, hitting all the notes she did some 40 years ago. But her singular interpretations are so unique, they sometimes render the songs unrecognizable—in a good way.&quot; Gary Graff of &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; wrote that the album was a &quot;delight, a demonstration of good taste and guts with Hoffs sounding as beguiling as she did lighting &#x27;Eternal Flame&#x27; or having a &#x27;Manic Monday&#x27; more than 30 years ago&quot;.

Hoffs co-wrote songs for the Go-Go&#x27;s, Belinda Carlisle, and Bette Midler. She sang on albums by artists such as Rufus Wainwright, Travis and the &quot;Lilith Fair: Celebration of Music&quot; compilation album (with Sarah McLachlin, Shawn Colvin, Emmylou Harris, and others). In 1992, she won Best Female Rock Vocalist at the Pro L.A. Music Awards.

Hoffs&#x27; debut novel, &quot;This Bird Has Flown&quot;, a romantic comedy about a struggling musician, was published by Little Brown in 2023. It received a favorable review from Beatriz Williams in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, who called it &quot;the smart, ferocious, rock-chick redemption romance you didn&#x27;t know you needed&quot;. Positive critical commentary also came from Mark Weingarten in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Michael Schaub of NPR, and from &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot;. Universal Pictures purchased the rights to the novel for a screen adaptation.

In 2024, Hoffs released, &quot;The Lost Record,&quot; an album she had recorded in her garage in 1999. The record was produced by Hoff and Dan Schwartz and includes, &quot;Life on the Inside&quot; (co-written with Jane Wiedlin and Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go&#x27;s).

==Other collaborations==
===Ming Tea===

Mike Myers, musician Matthew Sweet, and Hoffs formed the core of the faux-British 1960s band Ming Tea after Myers left &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the early 1990s. With Myers developing the Austin Powers character he had created, and with Hoffs pausing her solo career, they first met to play informally and all adopted pseudonyms for the band – Sweet became Sid Belvedere, and Hoffs became Gillian Shagwell. The trio played live at nightclubs in Los Angeles. Myers&#x27; then-wife, Robin Ruzan, encouraged him to write a film based on the character. The result was &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;, directed by Hoffs&#x27; husband Jay Roach. Ming Tea appeared in all three &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films and recorded the songs &quot;BBC&quot; and &quot;Daddy Wasn&#x27;t There&quot; for two of the soundtrack albums.

===With Matthew Sweet===
Hoffs teamed with Sweet, as &quot;Sid and Susie&quot;, to record several cover versions of classic rock songs from the 1960s for their album &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 1&quot; (2006). Hoffs and Sweet released a follow-up, &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 2&quot; in 2009, featuring songs from the 1970s by Fleetwood Mac, Carly Simon, and Rod Stewart, among others. &quot;Under the Covers, Vol. 3&quot; was released in 2013, featuring cover songs from the 1980s, the decade when both of their careers began; the album included covers of songs by the Smiths, the Pretenders, and Roxy Music. In 2013, Hoffs collaborated with Sweet and Tim Robbins on a recording of the traditional song &quot;Marianne&quot; for the sea shanty–themed compilation &quot;Son of Rogues Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs &amp; Chanteys&quot;.

===With Travis===

Hoffs was featured as a guest singer on Travis&#x27;s 2020 single &quot;The Only Thing&quot; from their ninth studio album, &quot;10 Songs&quot;.

==Equipment==
Hoffs learned to play electric guitar on a Gibson SG. Influenced by the Byrds and the Beatles, she changed to a Rickenbacker because she liked its &quot;angly, bright sound&quot; and purchased a 1960s model with black and white checked binding. She used this on the early Bangles recordings, but after some work on the guitar that affected its feel, she bought a Rickenbacker 325. She is depicted on the cover of &quot;All Over the Place&quot; holding her Rickenbacker 325V63. Musicologist Peter Mercer-Taylor observed that it was &quot;a black and white 6-string with three pick-ups and a hole for a vibrato bar, though the bar is not in place. Shortly after its 1963 appearance, this had become John Lennon&#x27;s signature instrument.&quot;

Hoffs used the 325 on some of the band&#x27;s recordings, but found it hard to tune, and said that it &quot;ended up being more of a video guitar&quot;. For some time, her main instrument was a borrowed Fender Telecaster, and she also used a Fender Stratocaster (including for live shows in 1984 and 1985); two Rickenbacker 350s and two Rickenbacker 620/12s (obtained during the &quot;Different Light&quot; sessions); and a Fritz Brothers Roy Buchanan Bluesmaster. 
She contributed to the design of a Susanna Hoffs model of the Rickenbacker 350 released in 1988 and 1989.

After the dissolution of the Bangles, Hoffs played a Taylor K22; she later worked with Taylor on the Susanna Hoffs Signature Series of guitars. She also has a 1966 12-string Guild Starfire which she says provides an &quot;incredible bright-but-warm sound&quot;, as used for tracks on &quot;Doll Revolution&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hoffs reportedly dated the actor Michael J. Fox for a short period in 1986, although both say they have no memory of this. In 1988 she met the actor Donovan Leitch, and the pair were in a relationship that lasted for about two years until 1991. She married filmmaker Jay Roach in 1993, and they have two sons, born in 1995 and 1998. Roach converted to Judaism when they married. In a 2023 interview with Debbie Millman for &quot;Print&quot; magazine, Hoffs said, &quot;In my life, it took many relationships to realize when I met Jay that that was the right partner for me.&quot;

==Legacy==
Hoffs inspired the Los Angeles–based rock band the Three O&#x27;Clock to write the song &quot;The Girl with the Guitar (Says Oh Yeah)&quot; for their 1985 album &quot;Arrive Without Travelling&quot;. In 2002, the alternative country artist Robbie Fulks wrote the paean &quot;That Bangle Girl&quot;.

The Bangles are one of the most successful all-female rock bands. Like their contemporaries the Go-Go&#x27;s, and Joan Jett and Suzi Quatro earlier, the Bangles composed songs and played instruments. This made them unlike most popular women musical artists of the 1980s, who were principally vocalists. The music historian Sean MacLeod posited that the success of the Go-Go&#x27;s and the Bangles as women in what were usually male roles in rock music opened a path for groups like Hole, Elastica and Dum Dum Girls. The Bangles were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000, and to the &quot;Goldmine&quot; Hall of Fame in 2013. They were presented with the Icon Award at the 2015 She Rocks Awards, thirty years after the release of &quot;All Over the Place&quot;.

<text>Plaxton is an English builder of bus and coach vehicle bodies based in Eastfield, North Yorkshire, England. Founded in 1907 by Frederick William Plaxton, it became a subsidiary of Alexander Dennis in May 2007. In 2019, the maker was acquired by Canadian bus manufacturer New Flyer which then became NFI Group.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The business was founded as a joinery workshop, and expanded into building contracting. As a building contractor, Plaxtons built a number of notable buildings in Scarborough. Soon after World War I Plaxtons diversified and began to build charabanc bodies on Ford Model T chassis. Of more importance at the time was the construction of automobile bodywork. This included bodywork for Rolls-Royce, Sunbeam and Daimler, but principally for Crossley car chassis. This activity continued through the 1920s, but the depression of 1929–1933 created difficulties for manufacture of luxury automobiles. As a result, the manufacture of charabanc, and later coach bodies became more important through the late 1920s and early 1930s. Customers during this time tended to be local to the Scarborough area, Scarborough being a popular seaside resort.

===Coaches of the 1930s===
By 1936 the company felt justified in constructing a large new manufacturing facility in Seamer Road, Scarborough. This allowed increased production, and Plaxtons became popular with many independent operators throughout Northern England. Many of these operators purchased their vehicles through independent dealers, rather than directly from the factory. In this regard, Plaxton&#x27;s sales were through Lancashire Motor Traders Ltd of Manchester and Arlington Motor Co Ltd of London. The company became known as FW Plaxton &amp; Son by 1937, as the founder&#x27;s son, also named Frederick William joined the company at the age of 18. FW Plaxton junior was to be known as Eric to avoid confusion with his father.

Plaxtons built a number of different coach designs through the 1930s, until settling on a distinctive house style. The style typically consisted of a very rounded front profile at the windscreen area with side windows that sloped backwards at the front, were upright at the centre, and sloped forward at the back. Bodywork for the Bedford WTB chassis was particularly distinctive, sloping steeply from the bottom of the front wheel arch to the roofline, leaving the &quot;bullnose&quot; radiator grille protruding. The rear also sloped prominently. The WTB chassis was very popular choice for operators at that time, together with the Dodge RBF and SBF. Leyland and AEC chassis were also popular for larger coaches, notably the Leyland Tiger and AEC Regal.

On the outbreak of World War II in 1939, coach production halted and the factory was turned into a munitions factory under the control of the Ministry of Aircraft Production. Many records from the early years were lost when an incendiary bomb set fire to the Seamer Road factory in 1943, causing much damage. As the factory was under control of the Ministry of Works, production continued in the open air whilst a replacement was constructed. Some adjacent land was loaned by a market gardener who subsequently joined the board years later.

===1950s===
Production restarted at the end of 1945, and in 1951 the business was registered for the first time as a private company, Plaxtons (Scarborough) Limited.

Two new models were exhibited at the 1950 Commercial Motor Show, with names instead of model codes for the first time. The Envoy was for traditional front-engined chassis, and featured a full-front cab with a vee-pattern windscreen, and aluminium trim across the lower part of the radiator grill extending around squared-off front corners to the wheel arches. The Crusader, which could be built on the traditional front-engined chassis or the new underfloor-engined chassis, had a more upright front profile, with curved glass panels at the windscreen corners, and in most cases an enlarged side window with sloping pillars between this and the entrance. With the front-engined chassis, the Crusader employed the Envoy&#x27;s front trim. Both the Envoy and Crusader were produced to the new maximum dimensions of by , and many examples were originally fitted with rear wheel spats.

The Envoy was short-lived, perhaps partly because of the obsolescence of most of the chassis types for which it was intended, while the Crusader was rapidly overtaken by a further new underfloor-engined model – the Venturer. The Venturer combined the front of the Crusader with more restrained and conservative styling, and proved so popular that it was not long before a version was produced for front-engined chassis (mostly lightweight Bedfords and Commers) with a rather more raked frontal appearance. By the time the Mark II version appeared at the 1952 show, the Venturer was Plaxton&#x27;s standard model.

The Venturer II had a common front profile for all models, together with a standard dash panel featuring a four-part radiator grille with a central cross within an oval outline which also embraced the headlamps. A rear-end revision marked the launch of the Venturer III in 1954, and the following year a version was produced for underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. This required a return to a more vertical front profile, and meant that there were now three variants of the Venturer – front engined, underfloor-engined with a centre entrance and underfloor-engined with a front entrance. This three-variant approach, established with the Venturer, continued throughout the life of the succeeding Consort model and into the Embassy era, although the relative importance of the three versions varied significantly over the years.

The Consort was first shown at the 1956 Commercial Motor Show. It was a development of the Venturer, but in place of the previous oval the four-part grill was now enclosed by a near-trapezoidal outline (though actually hexagonal), wider at the top than the bottom, with the headlamps outside. Trim was revised to be much squarer in outline, featuring ribbed brightwork, and the curved rear quarter lights, first standardised on the Venturer III, were now incorporated into the main window line. However, a year later the Consort II was announced, re-introducing the oval grill outline of the Venturer – but now surrounding a plainer grill with chrome flash across the middle – while the trim lines so recently squared up were softened once again. The evident popularity of the oval- shaped grill then ensured its survival as a Plaxton hallmark for many years to come.

In 1957 the founder of the company, FW Plaxton Senior, died, and was succeeded as chairman by his son Frederick Junior, though known as Eric.

In 1958, Plaxtons were approached by Sheffield United Tours (SUT) with a requirement for a new crisper design of coach body. The result was the first Panorama body. The main feature of the Panorama design was the large, fixed rectangular side windows. A vertical front from the contemporary Consort II design was used, with the door ahead of the front axle. The 1958 Panorama was entered into the British and the Nice coach rallies, winning top awards at both events. The first six Panoramas, designated &quot;Panorama Pioneer&quot; by SUT, were built on AEC Reliance chassis and seated 36 passengers.

The production version of the Panorama, with 41 seats as standard, was introduced at the 1958 Commercial Motor Show, as an addition to the existing range, available in one form only – on underfloor-engined chassis with the entrance ahead of the front axle. In common with the new Consort III and IV, it had a new silver-effect dished oval grill with a chrome flash through the middle, and a curved windscreen with a central division. The original Panorama&#x27;s short window immediately behind the entrance door was removed and encapsulated into the first bay, and the difference in level between the waistline and the rear window was accommodated by a stylish &quot;kick-up&quot; at the rear. The design then received minor modifications over the next two years.

Consort IV variants with the entrance further back, together with the smaller Consort III, were able to use a windscreen with even greater curvature, but it was the Panorama which was the trend-setter, becoming a strong influence on the development of British coach styling for years to come.

===1960s and 1970s===

Plaxton became a public company in January 1961.

For the 1961 coaching season the Consort IV evolved into the Embassy, the main change being that the windows now tapered inwards towards the roof rather than being vertical. At the same time a new version of the Panorama was created, using the same shell as the Embassy but with fewer window pillars.

The new Panorama boasted a completely new front, featuring a slight peak overhang above the windscreen (which was now optionally undivided), a small grill at the bottom of the front panel, and for the first time double headlights. Embassy bodies on underfloor-engined chassis shared some or all of these features, depending on the entrance position. However, because the standard offering in the underfloor-engined sector was now the Panorama, most Embassy bodies were built on lightweight front-engined chassis – particularly the Thames 570E and Bedford SB. In this form, with the entrance behind the front axle, the Embassy retained the dished oval grill and wrap-around windscreen of the Consort IV. The rear of both Panorama and Embassy comprised a two-piece curved glass window that wrapped around to meet the rearmost side pillars, and the lights were contained in a single unit with a fin-like top rather like the rear of the Ford Anglia 105E saloon.

 versions of both models were introduced, on Leyland Leopard and AEC Reliance chassis, as soon as legislation allowed, and were wide. The first 36-foot coach in Britain was a Panorama delivered to SUT in 1961. However, while the extra length gave a real boost to the Panorama&#x27;s appearance – with the falling roofline making the vehicle look even longer than it actually was – the extension of the Embassy by two additional window bays was less satisfactory. So much so that when a &quot;multi-windowed&quot; Embassy II, in the livery of Bloomfields Coaches of London, appeared on the newly introduced Bedford VAL 36-foot chassis at the 1962 Commercial Motor Show, the reaction was so negative than no more of this type were built.

Alongside the Bloomfields VAL on the Plaxton stand was a further revised Panorama. This was an altogether much larger looking vehicle than before, with deeper windows all round, the waistline curvature radically reduced to a point where it was almost straight, a new rear window interchangeable with the windscreen, and a reduction in the number of window pillars on 36-foot versions. Because of the adverse reaction to the &quot;multi-windowed&quot; Embassy, from 1963 all 36-foot Plaxton coach bodies used the new Panorama shell, with windows of large size whether fixed or opening, although, as previously, the Panorama name was restricted to underfloor-engined coaches with fixed glazing and entrance ahead of the front axle. Of the non-Panoramas, by far the most popular model was the new production body on the Bedford VAL chassis, which retained the large oval grill because of the front-mounted radiator, and was simply named Val.

The Embassy name was now being used for what were effectively two separate models. For underfloor-engined chassis there was a 36-foot body using the Panorama shell (built mainly for the Wallace Arnold Group), and for and shorter front-engined chassis the original short-windowed body was updated with a pronounced reverse-rake peak over the windscreen as the Embassy II. For the 1964 season the latter was substantially redesigned as the Embassy III, catching up in several respects with the development of the Panorama, but introducing a new near-rectangular grill which signalled the beginning of the end for the familiar Plaxton oval.
The Plaxton coach range which appeared at the 1964 Commercial Motor Show had been extensively revised with assistance from the Ogle design consultancy. Waistrails were virtually straight, and rooflines distinctly shallower. On the new Panorama (later to become Panorama I), a wide chrome trim band wrapped around the front and encompassed the first window bay on either side. The trim then swept upwards to the roof line and neatly terminated on the air scoop at the roof line. The window pillar on the first bay was noticeably thicker than the others and gave the impression of size that managed to enhance the appearance of the whole vehicle. The front grill was revised and basically split in two horizontally. Twin headlights were on each side of a panel that contained ventilation louvres at the top with the lower part being the actual grill that spanned the width of the vehicle. This grill was to become standard with little change until the Supreme IV of 1978. Again a bit of a Plaxton that was instantly recognisable and a familiar sight throughout Britain. The rear featured two large 9&quot; circular rear lights each side arranged vertically, and the entrance door was now the forward in-swinging type.

For the first time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, including Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the first window bay harmonised with the twin steering axles below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened window pillar was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.

In addition to the Panoramas, a more basic series of models was offered, with windows of similar size, but with simpler trim and top sliding vent windows instead of forced air vents. Initially these were built on Bedford and Ford chassis only and named variously as Val, Vam (on the new Bedford VAM chassis) or Embassy IV. However, when the Panorama was renamed Panorama I for the 1967 season, the less expensive &quot;bread and butter&quot; models became available on all chassis types as the Panorama II. The Panorama I in particular sold extremely well.

The Panorama cab was used in 1967 on a government commission of seven Bedford SB3 chassis mobile cinema units. With the height of these units being nearly the roof of the cab opens up into a very unusual looking perspex dome extension, somewhat altering the usual sleek lines of Plaxton&#x27;s Panorama. One of the seven units still remains in preservation, having been restored as a vintage mobile cinema.



Plaxton launched a new design – the Panorama Elite – at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show in London. This essentially set the basic design of British coaches for the next 14 years. The design was stylish, with long sleek lines and gentle curve in the vertical plane. The windows were gasket glazed and the glass gently curved in the vertical plane to suit the body curve. The rear again used the large soup plate lights of the Panorama I, and the front grill was also from the Panorama I.

The Panorama II was still available until 1970 with a large batch built for Midland Red.

The interior of the new Panorama Elite was to the usual high standard that everyone had come to expect from a leading coachbuilder like Plaxton. It made more use of laminate than before but this was tastefully specified &amp; well balanced. The interior skirt panels, racks and front cabinet made extensive use of this easily worked &amp; easy to maintain material. The analogue clock in the front dome was flanked either side by small square controllable air vents. The dashboard was improved and made use of a panel of rocker switches in front of the driver with each switch designation lighting for night time operation. Previous dashboards hid the switches in places inaccessible whilst moving. Ventilation was again improved though using the same design of moulded air output &amp; light assembly as the final version of the Panorama I. The racks were trimmed with laminate instead of using vinyl like material from the previous design.

The first major update of the Panorama Elite was unveiled at the 1970 Commercial Motor Show in London. The changes though relatively subtle were very relevant to a product that had so far enjoyed wide acclaim and sale.

The Panorama Elite II range built on the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up although it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other side windows. Parcel racks were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximise on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner side of the racks in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.

The Panorama Elite III was the last in the Elite series. Improvements continued to the basic Elite design; this included rear lighting, rear emergency door and subtle changes to the front grill. The rear emergency door was brought about by changes in legislation and did improve the offside appearance of the Elite, however some early Mark IIIs were completed with front emergency doors. The rear lights abandoned the soup plates in favour of tall lozenge shaped lights and the name badges were re-located from between the side bright metal strips at the back to the front just behind the front door.

All three marks of the Elite range were available with bus grant specification front doors and interiors, although this option was late for Panorama Elite and only a few built. It was however a very popular option for the Mark II and Mark III. To complement this destination blinds were also available in both the front grille and on the roof or front dome for front radiator chassis. This became known as &quot;the Bristol Dome&quot; due to the popularity of orders from the National Bus Company for coaches on Bristol RELH and REMH chassis.

The major competitor for the Panorama Elite III was the Duple Dominant launched at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show in London. The Duple was of all steel design and built at Duple&#x27;s Blackpool factory. The Dominant had many of the design cues of the Panorama Elite and that could be because the managing director at that time was an ex Plaxton employee. The Dominant sold well but never caught up with the Elite. The mere fact that at the 1972 Commercial Motor Show only one Dominant was available due to a long strike at the Blackpool factory couldn&#x27;t have helped much. The launch of the Dominant was at Lake Garda in Italy and was Duple&#x27;s most important launch for years.

By the time the final version of the Panorama Elite III was built around 6,000 of the Elite series bodies had been produced.

Development of a new coach range to supersede the Panorama Elite commenced in 1974 and was to be called Panorama Supreme, however the Panorama part was dropped in favour of simple Supreme. This series of bodies was to have a long development process as both the factory and work force wasn&#x27;t equipped for all-steel production at this stage.

At first the Supreme was designed to replace the ageing Panorama IV that was produced on the Bedford VAS and SB chassis for up to 41 passengers. The design for that coach went back to the Embassy body developed in the early 1960s. It had been re-vamped in the early 1970s and given an upright front and rear like the Elite III. Being front engined it had a centre door and still retained the Panorama I–style square cornered flat glass windows.

The Supreme was to herald (nearly) all-steel construction. Wood fillets still held the panels in place and in some areas wood was sandwiched in U-shaped steel. It would be 1978 before true all-steel construction was achieved.

Some early Mark III Supremes were all-metal. The body number of the all-metal versions had the final letters AM standing for &quot;all-metal&quot;. Many of the AM bodies were exported to the Netherlands and Denmark, a fact supported by the 1977 Supreme brochure and the 1982 centenary book Plaxtons The Great British Coachbuilders.

There was to be six marks of Supreme (Seven including Mini Supreme). Development was protracted as the builder was careful not to compromise their market leading position. Supreme I was a 29-seat coach on a Bedford VAS chassis with a standard Plaxton in-swing door located behind the front axle. Supreme II was on the 35 seat Bristol LHS chassis powered by a Leyland 400 series engine. The door located forward of the front axle in the usual place. Supreme III was the first full size coach although there seemed to be some development confusion and the actual mark of the initial standard length coaches is not clear however most of the late P and earlier R-reg bodies seemed to be the Mark III. There were no identifying numbers added to the badging.

As styling development commenced it was realised that to design another coach to match the success of the Panorama Elite series was to be a challenge. Looking at the existing range of Panorama Elite III it was decided to use the Elite&#x27;s most striking feature, notably the size of the windows and the curves that departed in every direction. The front of the coach was to follow closely with Elite by using the same double headlights with a panel between them (although the centre panel depended on the chassis requirements). The slats again horizontal but were fewer in number and thicker. The sides of the grill were squared up and were of stainless steel and not aluminium. A chrome bumper with over-riders at the bottom with two steps to allow access to the windscreen. Pantograph wipers with speed control were added. The dome was slatted on the early models but was not popular so was removed and simplified from Supreme IV. The side profile again had angles going in all directions although the main change to the side was that the windows curved into the cant rail almost like the Mercedes-Benz O302 bodies. The effect was to catch the light and highlighted the whole coach at roof level. The rear was like Panorama Elite with vertical lozenge shaped lights but the units themselves were slightly bigger, squared, more definite.

The interior had been updated with a new dashboard and a driver&#x27;s locker, non-reflective laminates and a re-designed front cabinet. The lift up roof vents and light clusters containing the speakers were almost like those of the final Panorama Elite III. Some very early Supremes had wood interior domes like Panorama Elite however this was changed from wood surrounding the clock to having ABS mouldings in black. The ceiling was of laminate that was bordered by chrome trim.

The racks though went through several important stages before the final design that would see Supreme through to the series.

Rack design on Panorama Elite, II and III contained window demisters. Those racks were joined to the cant rail and laminate was used as trim to connect the window edge to the rack. On Supreme the first versions used the same technique but the racks were swaddled in crash protection on each side of the passenger service unit that was fitted front to back. The service unit used were the same as the Panorama Elite, two controllable vents and a reading light with a rocker switch. The cushioning had a four pointed star engraved into it at intervals. From the Mark III the racks had flatter sides that had no connection to the cant rail. The demisters were located on the edge of the rack within a laminate strip. The PVC or maybe ABS material that coated the underneath of the rack was usually black. This was the final design of rack and saw Supreme through to the end of the series. Those racks used flatter service units with eyeball vents and a flat lens on the reading light.

The Supreme Mark IV was introduced to the market at the International Motor Show at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham in 1978. The main update was that construction was now all steel, frontal design was completely different from the past 14 years. The headlights were now rectangular and mounted above each other with side lights and indicators in the same cluster. The grill was not so prominent and various options were available as a package. So now the range consisted of Supreme IV, Supreme IV Express and Supreme IV GT. The GT option ushered in a distinctive grill design with a smart dual chrome flash, tinted windows and better sound system and soft trim to the ceiling to name a few &quot;standard&quot; extras.

Supreme V had a completely different rear design showing the styling of the next range that was probably under development. Tall heavily featured light clusters that were tinted to look dark were fitted vertically between the boot lid. The rear window was a one piece design. The seat backs were no longer visible from outside the coach.
The rear nearside had been tidied by removing the smaller windows. The improvements were also copied onto the high floor Viewmaster model with the exception of the shallow rear window.

The Supreme was also manufactured as a semi-integral on a DAF chassis. Around 20 were built. They were rear engined and the rear panel design was different from the Supreme V as it has vents and had odd shaped moulding around the rear window. As a semi-integral the body was required to support the full weight as there were no chassis members to support the body. Opening the side lockers luggage could be piled in one side and extracted from the other as nothing was in the way so it was very cutting-edge technology. It is said that 2 of these survive today. The bulk of the 20 were exported, mainly to the Netherlands, the left hand drive version had a tapered front to meet Dutch swept turning-circle requirements.

Final Supreme offering was the Supreme VI. This model was the least successful Supreme being an option for one season alongside the Supreme V. The panoramic windows had been replaced by a higher window line that was better suited to the long-distance market. Around 100 were built. The actual idea of the high window design was possibly in reaction to the Duple Dominant III that had shallow trapezoidal windows like an Austin Princess headlight of the mid-1970s.

The Supreme series like the Panorama I and Panorama Elite were simply a success from the outset winning many orders from small, national, and some international operators. It entered most fleets in large multiples. The export market was addressed with left hand drive versions, some modified for the Dutch market and at least one was built on Deutz chassis. The dynamic approach of Plaxtons relationship with their customers requirements was a huge factor in the success of the Supreme.

===The Paramount era===


By the end of the 1970s, the British coach scene was dominated by two similar vehicles – the Plaxton Supreme and the Duple Dominant. In the early 1980s coach services over 30 miles were deregulated by the Transport Act 1980 and there was an increasing attempt by some operators to compete with the railways and airlines for express and intercity travel. As a result, there was a move away from light-weight chassis by Bedford and Ford to heavier-duty chassis from Leyland and Volvo, and an emphasis on improved comfort and amenities. There was also a growing interest from operators in imports from Europe due to their stylish eye-catching designs that attracted passengers. In particular, designs from Neoplan and Van Hool received much attention.

In response, Plaxton returned to Ogle Design to create a new look for their coach products. The result was the Plaxton Paramount, which appeared at the 1982 British Motor Show. The Paramount was a squarer design than the Supreme, with cleaner lines, a flatter roof line and a distinctive &quot;feature window&quot; just behind the front wheelarch. The use of the &quot;feature window&quot; was a return to a trump card played by the Ogle-inspired Panorama/Panorama I first seen in 1964. From there the waistline sloped down to meet the deeper windscreen. Initially there were two versions, the Paramount 3200 (available in 8, 10, 11 and 12-metre lengths) and the high-floor Paramount 3500 (available in 11 and 12 metre lengths) to replace the successful Viewmaster. Around 30% of Mark I Paramounts were the 3500 high-floor option, a greater proportion than had been anticipated. The rear of both versions were similar to Supreme V and VI but all else was new.

In 1984 the design was adapted to produce the Paramount 4000 double-decker coach, initially built on Neoplan underframes. The design later appeared on chassis by Volvo, Scania and DAF.

The Paramount II launched for the 1985 season brought a tidier frontal appearance. (See the picture with the Paramount 4000) Gone was the black plastic moulding below the windscreen and the &quot;hole&quot; like appearance of the centre of the grille between the lights. The rectangular headlights were retained within a bright silver like surround. Other modifications included deeper parcel racks that were capable of supporting air conditioning. A tweed like material was used to cover the interior skirt and a large part of the racks.

A &quot;low driver&quot; option was available for the 3200. This was useful for touring however the driver lost the commanding view of the road ahead. The driver sat low in the body so the passengers have a better view ahead. The windscreen from the 3500 was used on this version of the 3200, the headlights being lower to the road than usual.

1986 saw the final and most elegant version of Paramount, the Mark III. According to brochures it was even stronger than the Paramount II. The sloping front window was gone and in its place a stepped front window that formed the first bay. In the glass Plaxton&#x27;s &quot;castle&quot; logo was etched, the rear window contained a blind like decal at the base with a castle badge in the centre. The dashboard consisted of a moulded cabinet, ceasing the use of wood and formica of earlier versions of Plaxton coaches since the Panorama&#x27;s. In the centre of the black finished cabinet was a large castle logo. Airline-style locker doors were now available on the parcel racks to further give a sleek appearance like a 747.

In 1989 Plaxton responded to a request from the privatised National Express for a further version of Paramount III to be leased to its contractors by a joint venture of Plaxton, National Westminster Bank and National Express. The Paramount Expressliner was created from the Mark III Paramount on a Volvo chassis and was tailored to National Express&#x27; specific requirements which included a closed back with the double N logo etched into the fibre glass rear moulding. This period of coach design seemed to introduce the windowless rear as a design feature for most coaches.

===Henlys and a new beginning===


The mid-1980s brought difficult times for Plaxton. A decline in orders due to the economic climate was compounded by management and production problems. The seasonal nature of coach production made recruiting difficult. In 1986, Plaxton bought Kirkby Bus &amp; Coach, based in Anston, near Sheffield. Kirby were Plaxton&#x27;s largest dealer, and also marketed the Hungarian Ikarus buses in the United Kingdom. Management expertise from Kirkby was soon in charge, investing in modernising the Scarborough factory and addressing some industrial relations problems.

In 1989, Plaxtons bought Henlys, a company that included 34 motor dealers and Coleman Milne, makers of hearses and limousines. The name of the company was changed to Plaxton Group plc.

In July 1989, Plaxton bought the manufacturing rights for the coach products of its main domestic competitor, Duple for £4 million. This included the jigs for the Duple 320 and the Duple 425 integral. Duple Services Ltd., the spares and repair business, was also purchased. The 320 was re-worked by Plaxtons at Scarborough later in 1989 and 25 were built and sold as the Plaxton 321. Many components from the Paramount were used both internally and externally. Identifying traits being the squared up wheel arches and Paramount side mouldings. The 321 was around £6,000 cheaper than a comparable Paramount 3200 III and was only available from the Kirkby dealership. A Plaxton version of the higher floor Duple 340 was considered but none were built. A modified version of the Duple 425 integral design was introduced in 1991 and was briefly built in France by Carrosserie Lorraine as the Plaxton 425.

Carrosserie Lorraine was a subsidiary of Iveco assembling Iveco 315 and 370 coaches for the French domestic market, but it was purchased by Plaxton in 1989 subject to a 3-year deal with Iveco to continue that arrangement. Sales of the Iveco-Lorraine had never been high (totalling only around 660 between 1981 and 1992) and Plaxton&#x27;s efforts to expand the business by offering Lorraine coaches in the UK market were frustrated by the early 1990s recession. One batch of ten Iveco 315 Lorraine midicoaches was sold in the UK in 1990–92, and only twelve Plaxton 425 integrals were built at the French plant in 1991–92. The Carrosserie Lorraine factory closed in March 1992 when the three-year deal with Iveco expired.

The Dennis Dart, released in 1989, had been a runaway success, so in 1991 the Plaxton Pointer midibus was announced, this was quite a utilitarian, square body. This was followed by the Plaxton Verde, which Plaxton hoped would match the success of its smaller sister, but it failed to capture the market quite as much as the Pointer, and it was clear that the bus industry wasn&#x27;t buying 12m single-deckers in as large numbers any more. Later that year new coach bodies, the Plaxton Premiere and Plaxton Excalibur, were launched.

In May 1992, after a management shake-up, the company was renamed Henlys Group.

Henlys pursued a strategy of diversification and expansion through the 1990s. The established bus bodybuilder Northern Counties was bought in 1995 for £10 million. The UK bus and coach manufacturing business, trading under the Plaxton brand, continued to produce a range of bus and coach bodywork. It also owned one of the largest UK coach dealers, Kirkby, and provided after-sales services to coach and bus operators.

In August 2000, Henlys entered a joint venture with Mayflower Corporation, owners of the Dennis and Alexander brands. The joint venture, known as TransBus International, included only the United Kingdom bus manufacturing operations of both companies, including Plaxton and Northern Counties. Henlys held a 30% stake in the joint venture, which employed 3,300 employees at seven locations. The traditional brands of Alexander, Dennis and Plaxton were replaced by TransBus International.

===Independent again===
On 31 March 2004, TransBus International was put into administration. On 17 May 2004, the Plaxton business was sold in a management buyout and resumed trading as Plaxton Limited.

Plaxton employed almost 300 people at its main coach plant in Scarborough and a further 59 at its facility in Anston, which builds small buses and coaches such as the Beaver and Cheetah.

In May 2005, Plaxton announced its return to the service bus market, launching the Centro, a low-floor single-deck vehicle initially to be offered on VDL SB120 chassis, in 10.7 m length, with the first bus completed in February 2006. The Centro is now available on the VDL SB180, VDL SB200, MAN 14.220 and Volvo B7RLE chassis, with 10.2 m and 12 m lengths also offered.

The company also revealed the Primo, a 28-seat low-floor minibus, in September 2005. This 7.9 m long vehicle is powered by the Cummins ISBe Euro III engine, mounted transversely at the rear. The Primo frame is assembled in Hungary by Enterprise Bus, effectively a conventional chassis in most respects but one which extends up to cantrail level, before being shipped to Scarborough for completion.

===Purchase by Alexander Dennis===
In May 2007, Plaxton was purchased by Alexander Dennis, effectively recreating the TransBus International business. Following the purchase, Plaxton&#x27;s Centro bodywork remained in production alongside Alexander Dennis&#x27;s Enviro200 and Enviro300.

In 2008, the new Plaxton Elite was launched at Birmingham Euro Bus Expo and by 2011 had delivered 100 Elites. Originally based on the Volvo B12B chassis, it was later developed to suit the Volvo B9R and B13R chassis.

Alexander Dennis announced in March 2024 that as a result of the shift of the company&#x27;s priorities to manufacturing battery electric buses, production of Plaxton coaches would be suspended until 2026.

<text>The Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (, ; abbreviated BBWR) was a &quot;non-political&quot; organization in the interwar Second Polish Republic, in 1928–35. It was closely affiliated with Józef Piłsudski and his Sanation movement. Its major activists included Walery Sławek, Kazimierz Bartel, Kazimierz Świtalski, Aleksander Prystor, Józef Beck, Janusz Jędrzejewicz, Wacław Jędrzejewicz, Adam Koc, Leon Kozłowski, Ignacy Matuszewski, Bogusław Miedziński, Bronisław Pieracki, Adam Skwarczyński, and Janusz Franciszek Radziwiłł.

In 1993, Lech Wałęsa, then President of Poland, founded a Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms, in Polish &quot;Bezpartyjny Blok Wspierania Reform&quot;, likewise abbreviated &quot;&quot;BBWR&quot;,&quot; which was meant to revive some of the traditions of the prewar &quot;BBWR&quot; and to form a parliamentary grouping explicitly supportive of President Wałęsa. In the 1993 elections, the new &quot;BBWR&quot; achieved limited success, capturing 5.41% of the vote.

== BBWR in 1928–35 ==

The BBWR was created in November 1927, by Walery Sławek, at the urging of Józef Piłsudski. The organization consisted of several smaller parties, including those representing national minorities. Also, a few deputies of the Polish Socialist Party and PSL Piast decided to join the new movement. The BBWR was not a classic political party, as it consisted of people with sometimes very different opinions. They were united by the personality of Piłsudski, whom they supported, and the BBWR had several targets: to carry out changes in the constitution, to keep the National Democracy political movement away from the parliament, and to attract conservatives and business circles.

The political program of the BBWR was announced on January 19, 1928. It was based on the following principles:
* the cult of Józef Piłsudski,
* criticism of party favouritism, which had a destructive influence on the condition of the state,
* the need to change the constitution, with more power in the hands of the president and limiting the powers of the parliament,
* social solidarism.
During the 1928 election campaign, which took place in March, the BBWR won 130 seats in the Sejm (out of 444), and 46 seats in the Senate (out of 111). On June 28, 1928, the government of Prime Minister Kazimierz Bartel was created. Even though the movement did not have a majority in the Polish Parliament, Józef Piłsudski regarded his party as the winner. Still, to his surprise, left-wing politician Ignacy Daszyński was chosen the speaker of the Sejm.

On April 14, 1929, Bartel&#x27;s government was replaced by the more radical government of Kazimierz Świtalski. It was based on the so-called “group of colonels”, who were personal friends of Piłsudski. On December 6, 1929, the Sejm passed the motion of no confidence, and Bartel replaced Świtalski. The new government was dissolved on March 29, 1930, and the new Prime Minister was Walery Sławek. In response, opposition parties united, creating the so-called Centrolew, and organizing a mass anti-government demonstration in Kraków, on June 29, 1930. On August 25, 1930, Józef Piłsudski took the post of Prime Minister, and on September 9, the first arrests of opposition politicians took place. The parliament was dissolved, and the opposition leaders were imprisoned in the Brest Fortress.

In the 1930 election, which was also called the “Brest election”, the BBWR won 249 seats in the Sejm, and 75 in the Senate. On December 4, 1930, the second government of Walery Sławek was created. It existed until May 1930, when Aleksander Prystor became a new Prime Minister. Facing the financial crisis (see Great Depression), Prystor decided to cut public spending in order to balance the budget. In 1933, a program of public works was created to reduce widespread unemployment. Furthermore, in 1932 - 1933, the BBWR government carried out significant educational reform. Simultaneously, oppositional activities were curbed, following three new bills, which limited the means of street protests and possibilities of creating new movements (see also Brest trials).

In the summer of 1933, Prystor lost the confidence of Józef Piłsudski and was replaced by Janusz Jedrzejowicz. At the same time, Piłsudski and his subordinates began drafting the April Constitution, and on May 15, 1934, the new government of Leon Kozłowski was created. In June of the same year, Minister of Internal Affairs Bronisław Pieracki was murdered by the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. The government in response opened the Bereza Kartuska detention camp.

After the death of Józef Piłsudski (May 12, 1935), the weakened BBWR continued to exist until October 30, when Walery Sławek dissolved it. The tradition of the movement was continued by the Camp of National Unity, formed in February 1937.

==Aftermath==
The Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (&quot;Bezpartyjny Blok Wspierania Reform&quot;, also abbreviated &quot;BBWR&quot;), was founded to continue the traditions of pre-war Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government. Its creation was announced by Lech Wałęsa on June 1, 1993, during a press conference in the garden of the Belweder. The movement was registered on October 30, 1993. It was a political party, supposed to provide Wałęsa with support in the Parliament. In the 1993 election, the BBWR won 5.41% of votes, or 8 seats (16 in the Sejm, 2 in the Senate). Disappointed with this result, Wałęsa began to disassociate himself from the organization.

The BBWR continued to exist until 1997. It supported Wałęsa in the 1995 presidential election, after which the party was split into several factions - the &quot;BBWR - Bloc for Poland&quot; (&quot;BBWR - Blok dla Polski&quot;), &quot;BBWR - United in Election&quot; (&quot;BBWR - Solidarni w Wyborach&quot;), &quot;New Poland&quot; (&quot;Nowa Polska&quot;), &quot;Republican Party&quot; (&quot;Partia Republikanie&quot;), and &quot;National Party of Retirees&quot; (&quot;Krajowa Partia Emerytow i Rencistow&quot;). In December 1997, Wałęsa created the Christian Democracy of the 3rd Polish Republic.

<text>The Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (, BBWR) was an officially nonpartisan organization (but, in fact, a political party) affiliated with Lech Wałęsa. The party was established in 1993, and became part of Solidarity Electoral Action in 1997.

It was founded to continue the traditions of Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s pre-war Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government (&quot;&quot;), which likewise had been known by the same initials, &quot;BBWR&quot;.

After local electoral losses in 1994, Wałęsa issued a statement that invoked comparisons with Piłsudski, who had become dictator of Poland: &quot;When the time comes to introduce a dictatorship, the people will force me to accept this role, and I shall not refuse.&quot;

==History==
BBWR was judicially registered on 30 November 1993 as a political association.

At the founders&#x27; meeting on 7 January 1994, Zbigniew Religa was appointed chairman. He served as chairman until the convention of the association. In November of the same year, he resigned and left the BBWR and was replaced as head of the association by Jerzy Gwiżdż.

The Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms was a political formation intended to form a backbench in the new parliament for the President of Poland, who hoped that his grouping would obtain at least 25% of the vote. At the time of its formation, a Demoskop poll gave the association the support of 18% of respondents.

As a result of the parliamentary elections held on 19 September 1993, BBWR received 746,653 votes, i.e. 5.41% support, which translated into 18 parliamentary seats (16 Sejm seats and 2 Senate seats). Already at that time Lech Wałęsa began to distance himself from his new formation.

In the 1995 Polish presidential election, the grouping worked towards Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s re-election. Wałęsa played an anti-communist note during the first round of presidential elections, presenting himself as an anti-communist hero, a person who &quot;had led the Russian army out of Poland&quot; and who saw his main enemy in the post-communist formation, the Democratic Left Alliance. During the campaign, Wałęsa did not attack the other candidates of the right, ignoring them or even making conciliatory gestures, as in the case of Jan Olszewski. Such a policy was in line with the slogan &#x27;There are many candidates - Lech Wałęsa is the only one&#x27;. 

Wałęsa&#x27;s efficient electoral staff argued that only Wałęsa is capable of defeating post-communist Kwaśniewski. This message resonated and allowed Wałęsa to avoid elimination in the first round, despitely disastrous polling at first. After 5 November, most right-wing parties in Poland concluded the only option was to support Lech Wałęsa, despite all reservations. The second round of the election was seen a clash of completely opposite visions of how the state should function, between an anti-communist and a post-communist candidate. 

The National Executive Board of the People&#x27;s Christian Party appealed for a vote for Lech Wałęsa, calling on its members and supporters, as well as all those who did not take part in the elections, to support the president. Its statement was: &quot;Lech Wałęsa is not only supported by his merits in the victory over communism, the restoration of independence, the building of democracy and the free market. Lech Wałęsa is also supported by his political will and ability to take the initiative in deciding the fate of the country. We take a positive view of the style of the presidential campaign and the candidate&#x27;s announcements, which speak not of creating a presidential party, but of helping to establish a right-wing and reform camp. The Candidate&#x27;s international position and his firm commitment to NATO and the European Union is a very important argument. In view of the advantages of President Wałęsa and the dangers of electing A. Kwasniewski, who brings decommunization political tendencies, the return of systems and people of the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, we call on all voters who voted in the first round for Solidarity candidates to vote for Lech Wałęsa on 19 November. Together we have collected more than 50% of the vote. The advantage is on our side. We cannot waste it&quot;.

Ultimately however, Wałęsa lost to Kwaśniewski in the second round, losing the presidency. Political commentators observed that despite most right-wing and anti-communist parties endorsing Wałęsa, the endorsement was not followed by unity and the anti-communist camp remained extremely disunited and was mired in in-fighting. Meanwhile, Kwaśniewski did not only enjoy an almost unanimous support of post-communist voters, but also made inroads with voters opposed to the neoliberal Balcerowicz Plan and transition of Polish economy towards capitalism. The defeat of Wałęsa dealt a decisive blow to the anti-communist camp, but also defeated the main reason for existence of the Nonpartisan Block for Support of Reforms. The party split after the election.

In February 1996, Jerzy Gwiżdż was suspended, and in March he was dismissed and excluded by an extraordinary congress. He subsequently resigned from the BBWR. Jerzy Gwiżdż was succeeded by Stanisław Kowolik.

During the second term of the Polish Sejm in 1993-1997, the BBWR Parliamentary Club proved to be the most divisive club. At the end of the term, its MPs were divided into several groups:

As a result, the former President appealed to BBWR politicians to withdraw their candidatures in the next parliamentary elections - the 1997 Polish parliamentary election, which, however, the vast majority did not do. In these elections, BBWR received 1.36% of the vote and failed to gain seats in parliament. In November of the same year, the activists of BBWR decided to transform the association into a political party called Blok dla Polski. At that time, Lech Wałęsa founded the party Christian Democracy of the Third Polish Republic (which included, among others, the former head of BBWR Jerzy Gwiżdż), whose environment ran in the elections from the Solidarity Electoral Action list.

==Ideology==
While the party served first and foremost as a way for president Lech Wałęsa to extend his influence into the Sejm and thus broadly included his political supporters, the BBWR had a clear ideology. It was considered a part of the Polish family of conservative and Christian Democratic parties, with the common link between such parties being a dislike for post-communist organizations. The party put emphasis on the importance of religion and the Catholic Church in public life, campaigned on &#x27;traditionalism&#x27; and &#x27;family values&#x27;, and evoked Polish nationalism.

Because the party was formed with the aim of expanding presidential influence in parliament, it became a grouping promoting the presidential system at the expense of the parliamentary one. The program of the party had two distinct ideological currents. It heavily evoked and pledged allegiance to Catholic values, and was placed within the family of Christian Democratic parties. On the other hand, it promoted economic proposals such as the idea of giving expansive loans on beneficial conditions to every citizen, which placed the party among the populist ones. Polish political scientist Marek Migalski described the party as partway between liberalism and rigorism, which nevertheless occupied a position closer to religious values and conservatism.
