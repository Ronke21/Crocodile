<text>Holland Park is a London Underground station, on Holland Park Avenue. It is on the Central line between Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Notting Hill Gate stations, in Travelcard Zone 2.

==History==
The original building was typical of those designed by Harry Bell Measures for the stations of the Central London Railway that opened on 30 July 1900. It was given a flat roof in the hope that commercial development would take place on top, as at Queensway station, but so far this has not happened. The building was refurbished in the 1990s.

On 28 July 1958 one passenger died as a result of a fire on a Central line train at Holland Park. There was an incident in August 2013 in which smoke started to fill the station after a train&#x27;s brakes malfunctioned.

==The station today==
The tube station is named after Holland Park, a park in west London, although the term also refers to the residential area to the north of the park.

The station was closed for lift replacement works and refurbishment from 2 January 2016 until it reopened in August of the same year. This station was the last of the deep level underground stations to retain the original 1950s signage until the refurbishment.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 31, 94, 148, 228 and N207 serve the station.

<doc id="1185526" wikidata="Q897416" url="?curid=1185526" title="Brain trust">
<text>Brain trust was a term that originally described a group of close advisers to a political candidate or incumbent; these were often academics who were prized for their expertise in particular fields. The term is most associated with the group of advisers of Franklin D. Roosevelt during his presidential administration. More recently, however, the use of the term has expanded beyond politics to encompass any specialized group of advisers aligned to a decision maker.

==Etymology==
Early use of the term &quot;brain trust&quot; was patterned on the use of the term &quot;trust&quot; to depict economic consolidation within an industry. This was a subject of much interest at the time and led to the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890. In 1888 the &quot;Springfield [Missouri] Leader&quot; used the term in connection with the consolidation of newspapers in the state: &quot;[Too many newspapers in Columbia, Mo.] overstocked the brain market of that town, and the &quot;Columbian&quot; and &quot;Statesman&quot; formed a &#x27;trust.&#x27; ... While sugar, coffee, lumber, whiskey, iron, coal and other trusts are forming we can see no reason why a &#x27;brain trust&#x27; can&#x27;t be organized.&quot; Around the same time the &quot;Philadelphia Press&quot; penned a witticism concerning free traders that made the rounds of U.S. papers. The joke implies the lack of thought output, just as &quot;trusts (consolidation of productive units) reduced industrial output: &quot;Some of the free trade shouters display enough ignorance to excite a suspicion that they have been made the victims of a brain &#x27;trust.&#x27;&quot; Using the term as an analogy to industrial trusts seems to have spread widely in 1888. For example, lawyers who signed a fee-fixing agreement were called a &quot;brain trust.&quot; In a long lament of the independence of small editors, the &quot;Marion [Ohio] Star&quot; says that a &quot;Brains Trust&quot; is evidenced by the &quot;machine made&quot; opinions of gullible editors.

Around the same time the term &quot;brain trust&quot; was employed in a slightly different sense by journalists covering Henry Cabot Lodge. During the Spanish–American War in 1898, a group of journalists would gather in Senator Lodge&#x27;s committee room and discuss with him the progress of the war. Lodge called this group his &quot;board of strategy,&quot; but the Senate press corp called it &quot;the brain trust.&quot;

The sense of the term as depicting a collection of well informed experts was this sense that seemed to catch hold. For example, in 1901 a group of journalists in a state press association was called a &quot;brain trust&quot; by the &quot;Deseret Evening News.&quot; It was not long before the term described a group that was so expert that their advice would be almost inevitably agreed to and acted upon. Such was the reference to the eight senators who made up the &quot;Brain Trust of the Senate&quot; as described by William Allen White in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. That use became regular for the next two decades, as can be seen from the use by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1928, which ran a headline on a meeting of the American Council on Learned Societies titled &quot;Brain Trust&quot;.

==Roosevelt&#x27;s &quot;Brain Trust&quot;==
Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s speechwriter and legal counsel Samuel Rosenman suggested having an academic team to advise Roosevelt in March 1932. In 1932, &quot;The New York Times&quot; writer James Kieran first used the term Brains Trust (shortened to Brain Trust later) when he applied it to the close group of experts that surrounded United States presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt. According to Roosevelt Brain Trust member Raymond Moley, Kieran coined the term, however Rosenman contended that Louis Howe, a close advisor to the President, first used the term but used it derisively in a conversation with Roosevelt.

The core of the Roosevelt brain trust initially consisted of a group of Columbia Law School professors (Moley, Tugwell, and Berle). These men played a key role in shaping the policies of the First New Deal (1933). Although they never met together as a group, they each had Roosevelt&#x27;s ear. Many newspaper editorials and editorial cartoons ridiculed them as impractical idealists.

The core of the Roosevelt brain trust later consisted of men associated with Harvard Law School (Cohen, Corcoran, and Frankfurter). These men played a key role in shaping the policies of the Second New Deal (1935–1936).

<doc id="1185528" wikidata="Q2287510" url="?curid=1185528" title="Simon Girty">
<text>Simon Girty (November 14, 1741 – February 18, 1818) was an American, Pennsylvania-born frontiersman. As a child he and his brothers James and George were captured and adopted by Native Americans. During the American Revolutionary War, after attempting to join the Pennsylvania Continental Army he became a Loyalist and an agent of the British Indian Department, serving as a guide and interpreter with indigenous warriors who fought against American troops. He played a similar role during the Northwest Indian War.

Girty was also known by his Seneca Nation name, Katepacomen, and the nickname &quot;Renegade Girty.&quot; 

==Early life==
Simon Girty was born to Simon Girtee and Mary Newton near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Girtee, a staunch Loyalist, was listed as a licensed Indian trader in 1740 and arrived in Pennsylvania sometime in the 1730s from Ireland. During his tenure operating a trading post, Girtee and Mary had four sons: Thomas, Simon, James, and George sometime between 1739–1746.

In 1750, a two year long complaint lodged by the Six Nations met its culmination, white settlers were illegally trespassing on Six Nations land and erecting homes, fences and other structures, the government sent Richard Peters of Philadelphia and Conrad Weiser and an Indian interpreter to consult with magistrates at Carlisle and have the trespassers removed. In 1748, Pennsylvania sent Conrad Weiser to Logstown, a council and trade village on the Ohio River. Here he held council with chiefs representing 10 tribes, including the Lenape, Shawnee, and the six nations of the Iroquois. Threatened by this development and the continued activity of British traders in the Ohio Valley, the French redoubled their diplomatic efforts, however in 1750, when Weiser traveled again to Onondaga, he found that the political dynamics in the Six Nations had shifted. Canasatego, always pro-British, had died. Some Iroquois tribes were leaning toward the French, although the Mohawk remained loyal to the Crown.

The magistrate reported that the trespassers had been at Sherman’s creek about six miles over the mountain, and found there James Parker, Thomas Parker, Owen McKeil, John McClare, Richard Kirkpatrick, James Murray, John Scott, Henry Glass, John Cowan, Simon Girtee, and John Kilgore, all who had settled lands and erected cabins or log houses there; and having convicted them of trespassing had them give bonds to appear at court to answer for their trespasses.

“The said trespassers had likewise given bonds in the sum of five hundred penalty to remove immediately with all their servants, cattle and effects, and had delivered possession of their homes to Mr. George Stevenson for the proprietor&#x27;s use, and that Mr. Stevenson had ordered some of the meanest of the cabins set on fire.”

In December 1750, after being forcefully relocated to the Conococheague settlement, Girtee and Samuel Sanders (or Saunders) in what historical accounts refer to as a &quot;drunken braw&quot; fought which ended with Girtee&#x27;s death.

Three years after Girtee was killed, his wife Mary married John Turner. She and her young sons, who were uneducated, did not know how to spell and listed the spelling of their name phonetically as &quot;Girty&quot;.

In 1756, Girty, his mother and step-father, and his brothers Thomas, George and James were taken captive by a Shawnee war band after an attack on Fort Granville. Girty&#x27;s step-father was tortured to death, and Simon Girty was transferred to the Seneca tribe, where at the age of 15, he underwent a rite of passage and was given his Indian name, Katepacomen.

==Adolescence==
Girty lived with Guyasuta of the Mingo and Seneca for seven years. He was returned to the British in November 1764, during a prisoner exchange after the end of Pontiac&#x27;s War, but upon going back to Pennsylvania he immediately returned to his former tribe, who had to convince him to leave.

On October 17, 1764, British commander Henry Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Indians return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Chief Guyasuta and other native leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into native families. On November 14, 1764, Girty returned to the British after a prisoner exchange, and resurfaced near Fort Pitt. Girty was fluent in the Algonquian language dialects, but due to his full immersion and upbringing in the native tribal culture, he was unable to read and write in English upon his return.

==Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War and American Revolution==
Girty, a former interpreter, briefly served as a messenger for Earl Dunmore in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774. Nervous about his personal safety, Dunmore stopped at Fort Pitt instead of meeting Colonel Andrew Lewis. There he commissioned two men to deliver a correspondence to Colonel Lewis, Girty, whom he commissioned as a Lieutenant, and Simon Kenton. Upon returning back to Fort Pitt, Girty accompanied Dunmore briefly to Fort Gowen. This period of less than one year, was the only time Girty was officially employed in the militia. Girty saw no combat, he did not participate in the Battle of Point Pleasant, and his name does not appear on the list of veterans. Shortly before departing back to Pennsylvania, in the presence of Major William Crawford, Girty attempted to receive compensation from Colonel Lewis for delivering the letter on behalf of Lord Dunmore. Lewis refused, and ordered him out of his tent.

After the Battle of Point Pleasant ended, and Major Crawford returned to Fort Pitt, Girty attempted to marry Crawford&#x27;s daughter and frequented Crawford&#x27;s residence multiple times. Crawford rejected the proposal, and shortly thereafter Girty deserted his post at Fort Pitt, perhaps in part due to growing hostilities between the Colonials and the Tories. In 1775 or 1776, Girty&#x27;s application for service in the Eighth Regiment of the Pennsylvania Continental Army was rejected. 

===Arrest Warrant for High Treason===
By April 20, 1778, Girty had reached Detroit, which was then in British North America. There Governor Henry Hamilton employed him at sixteen shillings a day (~$ in ).

On June 17, 1778 the United States of America issued a warrant for his arrest for High Treason. Simon, James, and George Girty, along with Alexander McKee and Matthew Elliot, were now considered outlaws and traitors to the United States. Immediately before or after publication of the arrest warrants, McKee and Elliot left Pennsylvania for the Six Nations. Pennsylvania placed a $800 bounty on Simon Girty&#x27;s head for inciting murder against fellow Americans, and acting as an agent for the British.

=== Siege of Fort Laurens ===
From February 22, 1779 to March 1779, Girty accompanied British Captain Bird and warriors of the Wyandot, Mingo, Munsee, and Delaware in the siege to Fort Laurens.

=== Ambush on convoy ===
On October 1, 1779, Girty and McKee, leading a large band of Indian warriors, ambushed a peaceful convoy of provisions which had been procured by American states from the Spanish in New Orleans. Girty&#x27;s forces ambushed the convoy near Dayton, Kentucky, across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. Only a handful of the one hundred survived, among them Colonel John Campbell and Captain Robert Benham.

=== Torture and murder of Colonel William Crawford ===
Girty is alleged to have been involved in the torture and murder of Colonel William Crawford, Girty&#x27;s former commander. On June 11, 1782, Crawford surrendered after a three-week battle against the Delaware Indians of the Wingenim tribe known as the Sandusky expedition. Crawford&#x27;s surgeon, Dr. John Knight, was also captured. Dr. Knight, in letters and testimony before the Continental Congress, detailed conversations he had with Crawford before he died. 

There has been controversy around the details of Crawford&#x27;s torture and murder. Reports of Girty&#x27;s role differ significantly. 

According to some accounts, Girty lied and informed Crawford that he would do his best to see to the release of Crawford and five other prisoners still living. Initially, Girty acted as though Crawford could be released as a gesture of comradery. However, upon a full inspection of the Wingenim tribal village, Knight recalled seeing four prisoners scalped and dead laying on the ground. Knight recalled the identity of one killed prisoner, Lieutenant John McKinley, a former officer in the 13th Virginia Regiment, whose head had been cut off and kicked around by the warriors. Shortly thereafter Girty and Chief Pipe led them to a fire pit where Girty ordered Colonel Crawford to be stripped naked at the fire and beaten with sticks and fists as he was tied to hickory poles six to seven yards from the fire. Next, Girty ordered burning logs to be placed on Crawford&#x27;s skin, followed by ordering the warriors to cut off his ears. In a plea for death amidst the extreme torture, Crawford yelled at Girty to shoot him – to which Girty rejected and &quot;laughed heartily and by all gestures seemed delighted at the horrid scene,&quot; stating he did not have a gun. Girty then was observed by Knight to order the warriors to shoot Crawford with only powder shots, which caused the flesh to burn. After over 70 blanks were shot at Crawford, he finally succumbed to death over two hours later. Girty then scalped Crawford and continuously placed his scalp in Knight’s face and mouth, saying, &quot;That was my great captain.&quot; Girty expressed to Knight that &quot;He swore to by God, I need not expect to escape death, but should suffer it in all its extremities.&quot; 

20th-century historians have noted potential bias in this account. Daniel Barr&#x27;s 1998 scholarly paper states that Hugh Henry Breckinridge, a frontier author, made &quot;subtle alterations&quot; to eyewitness statements which had the effect of presenting both the Indians and Girty in particular &quot;in a profoundly negative manner.&quot; Philip W. Hoffman&#x27;s 2009 biography states that newspapers of the era sensationalized the incident. Hoffman makes no mention of Girty directing the torture and killing of Crawford and notes that Girty had a history of consistently acting on behalf of white prisoners who were threatened by torture and death.

=== Ambush on Bryan Station and Battle of Blue Licks ===
On August 19, 1782, Girty, under the command of William Caldwell, along with about 300 Shawnee natives and British Canadians, attacked Bryan Station. Three days later, his band ambushed Daniel Boone and Colonel Todd at the Battle of Blue Licks. Girty&#x27;s conduct was described by a veteran of the battle to be &quot;the unusual scene of torturing the wounded and prisoners following the defeat.&quot; Girty&#x27;s character was also described in this battle to be the &quot;most discouraging stroke to that infant settlement.&quot; Both Todd and Boone were in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774.

==Northwest Indian War==
After the American Revolutionary War, Girty was involved in resistance to American westward expansion. During the Northwest Indian War, he commanded indigenous forces participating in the defeat of expeditions led by U.S. Generals Josiah Harmar (1790) and Arthur St. Clair (1791).

== Post Indian Wars ==
After the end of the war, Simon Girty settled in Upper Canada (now Ontario) along with other Loyalists and Indian allies of the British, such as nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. They were granted land by the British Crown in recognition of their service during the war. He retired to his farm near Fort Malden (present-day Amherstburg, Ontario) prior to the outbreak of the War of 1812. Girty&#x27;s son was killed in that conflict, reportedly while trying to rescue a wounded British officer from the battlefield.

==Modern representations and myths==

Modern historical accounts of Simon Girty (largely from Canadian biographers) falsely portray Girty as a servant of the world who rose up against the tyrannical Colonial government for a higher cause. Such accounts include &quot;Simon Girty: Wilderness Warrior&quot; by Edward Butts (2011), &quot;Simon Girty: His War on the Frontier&quot; (1999) and &quot;Simon Girty: Interpreter and Intermediary&quot; (1989).

Popular myths account for three people who claimed they were Simon Girty. One Simon Girty fled to Canada; one Simon Girty was said to have been killed with Tecumseh at the Battle of the Thames, and one Simon Girty was said to have been killed in Pocahontas, Virginia.

==Representation in culture==
* In his 1846 novel, &quot;Simon Girty: the Outlaw – An Historical Romance&quot;, Uriah James Jones depicts Girty as a &quot;fanatical tomahawk-waving warmonger. 

* &quot;Simon Girty: &quot;The White Savage&quot;—A Romance of the Border&quot; is a 1880 novel by Charles McKnight that presents Girty in a somewhat more favourable light.

* Girty is sympathetically portrayed in historical writer Allan Eckert&#x27;s &quot;The Frontiersmen&quot; (Boston: Little, Brown, &amp; Co., 1967) and &quot;That Dark and Bloody River&quot; (New York: Bantam, 1995), however, Eckert&#x27;s use of invented dialogue and filling historical gaps with conjecture tends to damage his credibility.

* Girty, along with his brothers, is vilified in novelist Zane Grey&#x27;s frontier trilogy series, &quot;Betty Zane&quot;, &quot;The Spirit of the Border&quot; and &quot;The Last Trail&quot;. In &quot;The Spirit of the Border&quot;, Grey made Girty and his brother James directly responsible for the Gnadenhutten massacre.

* Girty was played by American actor John Carradine in the 1936 film &quot;Daniel Boone&quot; directed by David Howard. In the film Girty is killed by Boone.

* Girty is featured as one of the jury members in Stephen Vincent Benét&#x27;s 1936 short story &quot;The Devil and Daniel Webster&quot; and in the 1941 movie of the same title. Benét describes Girty as “Simon Girty, the renegade, who saw white men burned at the stake, and whooped with the Indians to see them burn. His eyes were green like a catamount’s, and the stains on his hunting shirt did not come from the blood of the deer.”

* Girty is the main character in Timothy Truman&#x27;s two volume graphic novel, &quot;Wilderness: The True Story of Simon Girty the Renegade&quot; (Lancaster, PA: Four Winds Publishing, 1989-1990).

*Girty decision to fight on behalf of Native Americans is the inspiration for the 2002 song, &quot;Simon Girty&#x27;s Decision,&quot; by Indigenous poet, composer and instrumentalist Todd Tamanend Clark.

<text>Gabriel Asaad (Syriac: ܓܒܪܐܝܠ ܐܣܥܕ) (March 18, 1907, Midyat – July 6, 1997 Stockholm) was an Assyrian composer and musician.

<doc id="1185544" wikidata="Q7622013" url="?curid=1185544" title="Strath Haven High School">
<text>Strath Haven High School (also abbreviated as SHHS) is a four-year public high school in Wallingford, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, enrolling about 1,200 students. SHHS is the only high school in the Wallingford-Swarthmore School District. The school exhibits particular excellence in its special education program, connections to Swarthmore College and technical schools, and strong music and football programs. As of 2020, the current principal is Greg Hilden.

==History==
Strath Haven High School is the product of a 1983 merger between the former Swarthmore High School and Nether Providence High School. In 1971, Pennsylvania state officials had determined that Wallingford and Nether Providence school districts had too small enrollments to maintain an independent existence. By 1980, enrollment in Swarthmore High school had dropped to the point that maintaining separate middle and high schools was no longer feasible. Because it had smaller enrollment, the district closed Swarthmore High over bitter and acrimonious public protest. (Many parents, opposed to the decision, attempted to form Swarthmore School, a private high school on the former Swarthmore campus.) To mollify those opposed, the district officially closed Nether Providence High School as well, and created an entirely new school on the former Nether Providence campus, named after Strath Haven manor on the Thomas Leiper Estate.

In 2005, the School District of Philadelphia selected then-principal Albert Bichner as Superintendent of High Schools. In response, the school promoted assistant principal Mary Jo Yannacone, who remained principal until June 2018, when she became Assistant Superintendent for Springfield School District. The school was then temporarily led by Andrea LaPira until the selection of Greg Hilden in 2020.

== Overview ==
The typical graduating class is approximately 300 persons.

Former principal Al Bichner organized Strath Haven along the theme of the &quot;Five A&#x27;s&quot;, meaning academics, arts, athletics, altruism, and activities. An oft-cited &quot;Five A&#x27;s&quot; figure is that around 80% of Strath Haven High School students participate in athletics, music, the arts, and a host of extracurricular clubs.

All students are required to complete four years of study in major subject areas, but also have limited freedom to select &quot;elective&quot; classes. Strath Haven provides guidance counselors to assist in course selection and college and career planning.

A full-time psychologist and communications specialist are the core of a Student Assistance Program providing help to students at risk.

===Football===
The school competes in the twelve-team PIAA Central League, winning 10 times between 1996 and 2010. Between 1983 and 2022, the Strath Haven football team achieved an overall record of 280–145. The football team performed especially well in 1999 and 2000. The team won state championships in those years, led by Mark Jones, a former punt returner for the Tennessee Titans, and Dan Connor, an All-American linebacker for Penn State who went on to be drafted by the Carolina Panthers and spent six seasons in the NFL.

=== Marching band ===
Under previous director Jack Hontz, Strath Haven&#x27;s marching band grew to become the largest band in Pennsylvania and the second largest in the nation. In an average year, the band enrolled about 400 members, or one out of every three students. Since Hontz&#x27;s death in 2017, Strath Haven&#x27;s marching band has been directed by Nicholas Pignataro.

=== Visual arts ===
A comprehensive visual arts program at Strath Haven includes introductory and advanced level courses in drawing and painting, graphic design, ceramics, and photography and video. The visual arts department was recognized as an Outstanding Visual Arts Community by the Pennsylvania Art Education Association in 2022.

=== Student publications ===
Strath Haven publishes &quot;Jabberwocky,&quot; a student-produced literary magazine. The magazine, which is published once a year, includes artwork, poems, short stories, drawings and photographs.

The 240-page &quot;Haven Yearbook&quot; is produced by a club staff that meets weekly. The yearbook is delivered annually in the fall.

Newspaper club members publish &quot;The Panther Press&quot; student newspaper in print monthly or bimonthly, with more regular updates posted on the website shpantherpress.com.

The newspaper and yearbook staffs have been recognized with state and national awards, including Keystone Press Awards, National Student Media Awards, the National Federation of Press Women, and the National Scholastic Press Association.

=== Nontraditional education ===
Special education programs are available for students with special needs. Strath Haven High School is known in the area for its high-quality assistance for hearing-impaired and students with disabilities.

The high school has a limited affiliation with Swarthmore College. Exceptional students at the high school can — with the permission of Swarthmore professors — attend classes at the college for high school credit.

Similar partnerships with Delaware County-area technical schools also allow students to train in electrical wiring, machining, auto repair, and other similar vocational skills. Students enrolled in technical school programs spend one-half day at Strath Haven taking a required core curriculum, and one-half day at the technical high school.

== College preparation / Measured performance ==
The school is accredited by the Middle States Association and was awarded the National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the Department of Education in 1985 and 2002.

Strath Haven students typically perform well on standardized tests and other measures of secondary school achievement. Typically, about 15 students (5%) are National Merit Scholars; the Strath Haven mean SAT score exceeds the national mean by approximately 80-100 points in each category. Likewise, mean ACT scores exceed the national mean by 5-9 points per category.

==Other==
On April 2, 2008, Barack Obama held a town hall meeting and Question and Answer session in the Strath Haven High School gymnasium. Later, on November 2, 2008, Senator John McCain held a &quot;Road to Victory Rally&quot; in the school&#x27;s gymnasium. Senator McCain gave a speech, as did Senator Joe Lieberman, and Former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.

<doc id="1185547" wikidata="Q991279" url="?curid=1185547" title="Brownsville, Brooklyn">
<text>Brownsville is a residential neighborhood in eastern Brooklyn in New York City. The neighborhood is bordered by Crown Heights to the northwest; Bedford–Stuyvesant and Cypress Hills to the north; East New York to the east; Canarsie to the south; and East Flatbush to the west.

The area that comprises Brownsville has 58,300 residents as of the 2010 United States Census, with an estimated population of 128,369 residents in 2019. Founded in its current incarnation in 1858, Brownsville was initially a settlement composed of Jewish factory workers. The neighborhood underwent a major demographic change in the 1950s that saw an influx of African-American residents. Since the late 20th century, Brownsville has consistently held one of the highest poverty and crime rates of any neighborhood in New York City.

Brownsville is part of Brooklyn Community District 16, and its primary ZIP Code is 11212. It is patrolled by the 73rd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 42nd and 41st Districts.

==History==

===Early development===
The area that would become Brownsville was first used by the Dutch for farming, as well as manufacturing stone slabs and other things used to construct buildings. In 1823–1824, the Dutch founded the New Lots Reformed Church in nearby New Lots because the corresponding church in Flatbush was too far away. The church, which has its own cemetery that was built in 1841, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

In 1858, William Suydam parceled the land into 262 lots, providing simple two- to four-room accommodations for workers who were living there. However, Suydam vastly underestimated how undesirable the area was, and ran out of funding in 1861. After failing to pay his mortgages, the land was auctioned off in 1866 to Charles S. Brown of Esopus, New York. Believing the area to be useful for development, Brown subdivided the area and began calling it &quot;Brownsville&quot;, advertising the area&#x27;s wide open spaces to Jews who lived in Lower Manhattan. There were 250 houses in &quot;Brown&#x27;s Village&quot; by 1883, most of them occupied by factory workers who commuted to Manhattan. The first houses in the area were built by Charles R. Miller.

Through the 1880s, the area was a marshy floodplain that was used as a dumping ground. Fumes from the glue factories along Jamaica Bay would usually blow upwind into Brownsville. This place was inconveniently far enough from Manhattan that the affluent refused to move to Brownsville, but the land was cheap enough that tenements could be built for the poor there.

=== Jewish neighborhood (1880s-1950s) ===

Brownsville was predominantly Jewish from the 1880s until the 1950s. In 1887, businessman Elias Kaplan showed the first Jewish residents around Brownsville, painting the area as favorable compared to the Lower East Side, which he described as a place where one could not get away from the holds of labor unions. Kaplan built a factory and accommodations for his workers, then placed a synagogue, named Ohev Sholom, in his own factory. Other manufacturers that created low-tech products like food, furniture, and metals followed suit throughout the next decade, settling their factories in Brownsville. This led to much more housing being built there. The area bounded by present-day Dumont, Rockaway, and Liberty Avenues, and Junius Street, quickly became densely populated, with &quot;factories, workshops, and stores&quot; located next to housing. The farm of a local farmer, John J. Vanderveer, was cut up into lots and given to Jewish settlers after he sold it in 1892. Within three years of the first lot being distributed, there were 10,000 Jews living in Brownsville. By 1904, the lots comprising the former Vanderveer farm were entirely owned by Jews, who were spread out across .

An estimated 25,000 people lived in Brownsville by 1900, most of whom lived in two-story wooden frame accommodations built for two families each. Many of these buildings were grossly overcrowded, with up to eight families living in some of these two-family houses. They were utilitarian, and according to one &quot;New York Herald&quot; article, &quot;grossly unattractive&quot;. Many of these houses lacked amenities like running water, and their wood construction made these houses susceptible to fires. New brick-and-stone houses erected in the early 1900s were built with indoor plumbing and less prone to fire. The quality of life was further decreased by the fact that there was scant infrastructure to be found in the area, and as a result, the unpaved roads were used as open sewers. Compounding the problem, land prices were high in Brownsville (with lots available for $50 in 1907, then sold for $3,000 two years later), so in order to make their land purchases worthwhile, developers were frequently inspired to build as many apartments on a single lot as they possibly could. Within twenty years of the factories&#x27; development, the area acquired a reputation as a vicious slum and breeding ground for crime. By 1904, 22 of the 25 housing units in Brownsville were tenement housing; three years later, only one of these 25 housing units was not a tenement. It became as dense as the very densely packed Lower East Side, according to one account. This also led to dangerous conditions; a 1935 collapse of a tenement stairway killed two people and injured 43 others. This overcrowding was despite the availability of empty space in the fringes of Brownsville. There were also no playgrounds in the area, and the only park in the vicinity was Betsy Head Park.

In the early 20th century, the vast majority of Brownsville residents were born outside the United States; in 1910, 66% of the population were first-generation immigrants, and 80% of these immigrants were from Russia. By 1920, over 80,000 of the area&#x27;s 100,000 inhabitants were Russian Jews, and Brownsville had been nicknamed &quot;Little Jerusalem&quot;. In the 1930s it was considered the most densely populated district in all of Brooklyn. Brownsville was also considered to have the highest density of Jews of any place in the United States through the 1950s. The population remained heavily Jewish until the middle of the century, and the neighborhood boasted some seventy Orthodox synagogues. Many of these synagogues still exist in Brownsville, albeit as churches.

Brownsville was also a place for radical political causes during this time. In 1916, Margaret Sanger set up the first birth control clinic in America on Amboy Street. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the neighborhood elected Socialist and American Labor Party candidates to the state assembly. Two Socialist candidates for mayor in 1929 and 1932 both received roughly a quarter of Brownsville residents&#x27; mayoral votes. Socialist attitudes prevailed among Brownsville residents until World War II. The area&#x27;s Jewish population participated heavily in civil rights movements, rallying against such things as poll taxes, Jim Crow laws, and segregation in schools.

The area was fairly economically successful in its heyday. In 1942, there were 372 stores, including 8 banks and 43 stores selling menswear, along a stretch of Pitkin Avenue, which employed a combined 1,000 people and generated an estimated $90 million annually (equal to about $ today if adjusted for inflation). The median income of $2,493 in 1933 (about $ today) was twice that of a family living in the Lower East Side, who earned a median of $1,390 (about $ today) but lower than that of a middle-class family in outer Brooklyn ($4,320, inflation-adjusted to $) or the Bronx ($3,750, inflation-adjusted to $). The Fortunoff&#x27;s furniture chain had its roots on Livonia Avenue, its flagship store overshadowed by the tracks of New York City Subway&#x27;s New Lots Line from 1922 to 1964, eventually expanding elsewhere in the New York metropolitan area. At one point in the 1943 published book, &quot;New York City Market Analysis&quot;, it had described Brownsville as having a variety of small industry unlike Lower East Side. The book also mentioned the Jewish populations were a mix of Russian, Austrian, and Polish immigrants and were 80% of the foreign born population in the neighborhood.

In the 1930s, Brownsville achieved notoriety as the birthplace of Murder, Inc., who contracted to kill between 400 and 1,000 people through the 1940s. The organizations&#x27; criminal businesses also extended to nearby neighborhoods of Ocean Hill and East New York. The members mainly consisted of Jewish and Italian Americans as these neighborhoods during that time were mainly populated by Jewish and Italian enclaves. A film about the organization, Murder Inc., was produced and released in 1960.

===Late 20th century===
African Americans had begun moving into Brooklyn in large numbers in the early 20th century. The adjacent Bedford-Stuyvesant was the first large African American community of Brooklyn. In the 1930s, Brownsville began to receive growing numbers of African Americans. Most of the new residents were poor and socially disadvantaged, especially the new African-American residents, who were mostly migrants from the Jim Crow-era South where they were racially discriminated against. In 1940, black residents made up 6% of Brownsville&#x27;s population. The 1943 book &quot;New York City Market Analysis&quot; indicated the small but growing African American population was concentrated in the central portion of the neighborhood while most of the neighborhood was still populated by Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Although integration did take place in the neighborhood, there were racial tensions as well. By 1950, there were double the number of blacks, most of whom occupied the neighborhood&#x27;s most undesirable housing. At the same time, new immigration quotas had reduced the number of Russian Jews who were able to immigrate to the United States.

Spurred on by urban planner Robert Moses, the city replaced some of Brownsville&#x27;s old tenements with public housing blocks. Although the neighborhood was racially segregated, there were more attempts at improved quality of life, public mixing, and solidarity between black and Jewish neighbors than could be found in most other neighborhoods. However, due to socioeconomic barriers imposed by the disparities between the two populations, most of these improvements never came. Compounding the matter, the newly arrived African-American residents were mainly industrial workers who had moved to Brownsville just as the area&#x27;s factories were going out of business, so the black residents were more economically disadvantaged than the Jews who had historically lived in Brownsville. Finally, although both blacks and Jews living in Brownsville had been subject to ethnic discrimination, the situation for blacks was worse, as they were banned from some public places where Jews were allowed, and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) generally behaved more harshly toward blacks than toward Jews.

The breaking point for the area&#x27;s Jewish population came about in the 1950s, when the New York City Housing Authority decided to build more new public housing developments in blighted portions of Brownsville. The Jewish population quickly moved out, even though the new NYCHA developments were actually in better condition than the old wooden tenements. Citing increased crime and their desire for social mobility, Jews left Brownsville en masse, with many black and Latino residents moving in, especially into the area&#x27;s housing developments. For instance, in the Van Dyke Houses, the black population in 1956 was 57% and the white population that year was 43%, with a little over one percent of residents receiving welfare benefits. Seven years later, 72% of the residents were black, 15% Puerto Rican, and the development had the highest rate of per-capita arrests of any housing development citywide.

Through the 1960s, its population became largely African American, and Brownsville&#x27;s unemployment rate was 17 percent, twice the city&#x27;s as a whole. The newly majority-black Brownsville neighborhood had few community institutions or economic opportunities. It lacked a middle class, and its residents did not own the businesses they relied upon. In his book &quot;Brownsville, Brooklyn: Blacks, Jews, and the Changing Face of the Ghetto&quot;, W.E. Pritchett described the neighborhood as a &quot;ghetto&quot; whose quality of life was declining by the year. The NYCHA housing encouraged the creation of an African-American and Latino population that was poorer than the Jewish population it replaced. In 1965, sociologist and then-future U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote a report about black poverty entitled &quot;The Negro Family: The Case For National Action&quot;, in which he cited the fact that the 24% of the nation&#x27;s black communities were single-mother families, an attribute closely tied to poverty in these communities. At that time, Brownsville and East New York&#x27;s single-mother rate was almost twice the national rate, at 45%. Backlash against the report, mainly on accusations of victim blaming, caused leaders to overlook Moynihan&#x27;s proposals to improve poor black communities&#x27; quality of life, and the single-mother rate in Brownsville grew.

In 1966, black and Latino residents created the Brownsville Community Council in an effort to reverse the poverty and crime increases. The BCC secured welfare funding for 3,000 people, secure housing tenancies for 4,000 people, and voting rights for hundreds of new registrants. It closed down a block of Herzl Street for use as a play area, and it created the biweekly &quot;Brownsville Counselor&quot; newspaper to inform residents about government programs and job opportunities. However, in spite of the BCC&#x27;s efforts, crime went up, with a threefold increase in reported homicides from ten in 1960 to over thirty in 1966; a doubling of arrests from 1,883 in 1956 to over 3,901 in 1966; and claims that there could actually have been more than six times as much crime than was reported. Multiple robberies of businesses were reported every day, with robbers simply lifting or bending the roll-down metal gates that protected many storefronts. City officials urged people to not use public transportation to travel to Brownsville.

Brownsville began experiencing large-scale rioting and social disorder around this time. These problems manifested themselves in September 1967. A riot occurred following the death of an 11-year-old African American boy named Richard Ross, who was killed by an African-American NYPD detective, John Rattley, at the corner of St. Johns Place and Ralph Avenue. Rattley believed Ross had mugged a 73-year-old Jewish man. The riot was led in part by Brooklyn militant Sonny Carson, who allegedly spread rumors that Rattley was white; it was quelled after Brooklyn North Borough Commander Lloyd Sealy deployed a squad of 150 police officers. Officer Rattley was not indicted by the grand jury. Then, in 1968, Brownsville was the setting of a protracted and highly contentious teachers&#x27; strike. The Board of Education had experimented with giving the people of the neighborhood control over the school. The new school administration fired several teachers in violation of union contract rules. The teachers were all white and mostly Jewish, and the resulting strike badly divided the whole city. The resulting strike dragged on for half a year, becoming known as one of John Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;Ten Plagues&quot;. It also served to segregate the remaining Jewish community from the larger black and Latino community.

By 1970, the 130,000-resident population of Brownsville was 77% black and 19% Puerto Rican. Despite the activities of black civil rights organizations such as the NAACP and Urban League whose Brooklyn chapters were based in nearby Bedford-Stuyvesant, they were, overall, less concerned with the issues of the lower-income blacks who had moved into Brownsville, thus further isolating Brownsville&#x27;s population. These changes corresponded to overall increases in segregation and inequality in New York City, as well as to the replacement of blue-collar with white-collar jobs. The area gained a reputation for violence and poverty that was similar to the South Bronx&#x27;s, a reputation that persisted through the 21st century.

Meanwhile, rioting and disorder continued. In June 1970, two men set fire to garbage bags to protest the New York City Department of Sanitation&#x27;s reduction of trash collection pickups in Brownsville from six times to twice per week. In the riots that followed this arson, one man was killed and multiple others were injured. In May 1971, the mostly black residents of Brownsville objected to reductions in Medicaid, welfare funds, and drug prevention programs in a peaceful protest that soon turned violent. In the ensuing riot, protesters conflicted with police, with windows being broken, children stealing rides aboard buses, housewives tipping over banana stands, and the New York City Fire Department fighting over 100 fires in a single night. By then, people were afraid to go out at night, yet the 400 or so white families in south Brownsville were primarily concerned about housing remaining affordable. The streets had empty storefronts, with one block of Pitkin Avenue having over two-thirds of its 16 storefronts lying vacant. In 1970, Mayor John Lindsay referred to the area, which had been the city&#x27;s poorest for several years, as &quot;Bombsville&quot; because of its high concentration of empty lots and burned-out buildings.

=== Improvement and current status ===
After a wave of arson throughout the 1970s ravaged the low-income communities of New York City, many of the residential structures in Brownsville were left seriously damaged or destroyed, and Brownsville became synonymous for urban decay in many aspects. Even at the beginning of this arson wave, 29% of residents were impoverished, a number that would increase in later years. The city began to rehabilitate many formerly abandoned tenement-style apartment buildings and designate them low-income housing beginning in the late 1970s. Marcus Garvey Village, whose townhouse-style three-story apartment buildings had front doors and gardens, was an example of such low-income development that did not lower crime and poverty, as was intended; instead, the houses became the home base of a local gang, and poverty went up to 40%. However, the East Brooklyn Congregations&#x27; Nehemiah Housing, which also constructed buildings in East New York and Spring Creek, served to help residents find affordable housing with a good quality of life.

The neighborhood&#x27;s crime rate decreased somewhat by the 1980s. Many subsidized multi-unit townhouses and newly constructed apartment buildings were built on vacant lots across the expanse of the neighborhood, and from 2000 to 2003, applications for construction of residential buildings in Brownsville increased sevenfold. By 2015, many community organizations had been formed to improve the quality of life in parts of Brownsville. Changes included temporary markets being erected there as well as commercial developments in residential areas.

However, these improvements are limited to certain sections of Brownsville. In 2013, 39% of residents fell below the poverty line, compared to 43% in 2000, but the poverty rate of Brownsville is still relatively high, being twice the city&#x27;s overall rate as well as 13% higher than that of nearby Newark, New Jersey. Brownsville families reported a median income of $15,978 as of 2008, below the United States Census poverty threshold. There is a high rate of poverty in the neighborhood&#x27;s northeastern section, which is inhabited disproportionately by African-Americans and Latinos. The overall average income in Brownsville is lower than that of the rest of Brooklyn and the rest of New York City.

The reasons for Brownsville&#x27;s lack of wholesale gentrification are numerous. One reporter for the magazine &quot;The Nation&quot; observed that the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pico-Union, which had a poverty rate similar to Brownsville&#x27;s in 2000, had become a &quot;Businessweek&quot; &quot;next hot neighborhood&quot; by 2007. Brownsville had not seen a similar revitalization because, unlike Pico-Union, it had not been surrounded by gentrified neighborhoods; did not have desirable housing; and was not a historic district or an area of other significance. In addition, Brownsville is unlike similar neighborhoods in New York City that had since gentrified. The South Bronx&#x27;s coastline gave way to attractions like Barretto Point Park; Bedford-Stuyvesant offered brownstone townhouses comparable to those in affluent Park Slope, Fort Greene, and Prospect Heights; and Bushwick and Greenpoint became popular places for young professional workers once Williamsburg had become highly sought due to its waterfront location and proximity to Manhattan. By contrast, Brownsville is surrounded by other high-poverty, high-crime neighborhoods like East New York, Ocean Hill, and East Flatbush. Its high concentration of public housing developments has traditionally prevented gentrification in this area. Brownsville is still majority African-American and Latino, with exactly two Jewish-owned businesses in Brownsville in 2012.

A columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing for the paper&#x27;s &quot;Big City&quot; section on 2012, stated that the many improvements to the city&#x27;s overall quality of life, enacted by then-mayor Michael Bloomberg since 2002, &quot;might have happened in Lithuania for all the effect they have had (or could have) on the lives of people in Brownsville.&quot; On the other hand, the area&#x27;s lack of gentrification might have kept most of residents&#x27; money within the local Brownsville economy. The area&#x27;s largest employer is supposedly the United States Postal Service, and the lack of mobility for many residents encourages them to buy from local stores instead. Kay Hymowitz wrote in her 2017 book, &quot;The New Brooklyn: What It Takes to Bring a City Back&quot;, that Brownsville was &quot;the permanent ghetto&quot; and that despite the gentrification in other Brooklyn neighborhoods, Brownsville contained a &quot;concentrated, multigenerational black poverty&quot; that caused its development to &quot;remain static&quot;.

== Geography and land use ==
The total land area is , and the ZIP Code for the neighborhood is 11212. Although there are no official borders, Brownsville is generally bounded by East New York Avenue to the north on the Ocean Hill border; East 98th Street/Ralph Avenue to the west, bordering East Flatbush and Crown Heights; the freight rail Bay Ridge Branch of the Long Island Rail Road and Linden Boulevard to the south, adjacent to the neighborhood of Canarsie; and Van Sinderen Avenue to the east, next to East New York. It is part of Brooklyn Community Board 16, which also includes Ocean Hill.

===Residential development===

As of 2008, there were a total of 28,298 housing units in Brownsville. Brownsville is dominated by public housing developments of various types, mostly in a small area bounded by Powell Street and Rockaway, Livonia, and Sutter Avenues that is composed of multiple inward-facing developments located on six superblocks. The neighborhood contains the most densely concentrated area of public housing in the United States. NYCHA owns more housing units in Brownsville than in any other neighborhood, with about one-third of the housing stock (around 10,000 units) in its 18 Brownsville developments, comprising over 100 buildings within . In 2013, it was estimated that the housing developments alone contained nearly 21,000 people. Many of these buildings were built in the mid-20th-century and are deteriorating . Some of these NYCHA developments are in the process of being converted into RAD PACT Section 8 Developments, where, as part of a public-private partnership with NYCHA, private developers would take over the developments and provide funding for capital improvements. These conversions include Howard Avenue Houses, Seth Low Houses, Sutter Avenue-Union Houses, Tapscott Street Rehab Houses, Ralph Avenue Houses, 104-14 Tapscott Street Houses, and Lenox Road-Rockaway Parkway Houses.

Public housing developments include:
# 104–114 Tapscott Street; one 4-story building.
# Brownsville Houses; 27 buildings, 6- and 7 stories tall.
# Glenmore Plaza; four buildings, 10, 18 and 24 stories tall.
# Howard Avenue; five buildings, 3 stories tall.
# Howard Avenue-Park Place; eight buildings, 3 stories tall.
# Howard Houses; ten buildings, 7- and 13 stories tall.
# Hughes Apartments; three 22-story buildings.
# Lenox Road-Rockaway; three buildings, total 74 units.
# Marcus Garvey (Group A); three buildings, 6 and 14 stories tall.
# Ralph Avenue Rehab; five 4-story buildings.
# Reverend Randolph Brown; two 6-story buildings.
# Seth Low Houses; four buildings, 17 and 18 stories tall.
# Sutter Avenue-Union Street; three rehabilitated tenement buildings, 4 and 6 stories tall.
# Tapscott Street Rehab; eight 4-story rehabilitated tenement buildings.
# Tilden Houses; eight 16-story buildings.
# Van Dyke I; 22 buildings, 3 and 14 stories tall.
# Van Dyke II; one 14-story building.
# Woodson Houses; two buildings, 10 and 25 stories tall.
In addition, below Pitkin Avenue, there is also a significant concentration of semi-detached multi-unit row houses similar to those found in East New York and Soundview surrounding the public housing developments. Many have been torn down and replaced by vacant lots or newly constructed subsidized attached multi-unit rowhouses with gardens, driveways, and finished basements. Most of these houses were built in East New York, Ocean Hill, and Brownsville under the Nehemiah development program. Of the Nehemiah developments, most of them were built on the western half of the neighborhood. Other newly built or restored housing includes 3,871 housing units for low-income residents, as well as Noble Drew Ali Plaza, a 385-unit apartment building that was notorious for drug dealing before the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) helped New York Mets first baseman Mo Vaughn buy and redevelop the building.

The Livonia Avenue Initiative, a multi-phase project situated along Livonia Avenue, is intended to create 791 apartments or houses for low-income residents. The initiative includes Livonia Commons, a proposed mixed-use project on the north side of Livonia Avenue. Livonia Commons&#x27; postmodern buildings will contain 270 apartments for lower-income citizens and of commercial space at ground level. The initiative&#x27;s of community space will host a senior center and two concentrations of school classrooms, operated by two different groups. There would also be a gym, a swimming pool, a darkroom, and some studios. The entire Livonia Commons project would add of mixed-use space in multiple buildings. , there were 242 apartments being built, in addition to 468 affordable-housing units that had already been built in the East New York/Brownsville area.

Closer to the border with Ocean Hill, there are many limestone and brownstone townhouses in addition to tenements. In Brownsville, about 71% of rental housing is poorly maintained, more than the citywide rate of 56% and the boroughwide rate of 59%.

=== Empty lots ===
Many of Brownsville&#x27;s empty lots are now community gardens, which are also widespread in nearby East New York and are maintained by multiple community groups; the gardens are often planted with vegetables that could provide food for residents. The gardens were originally supposed to be temporary, filling lots that would have otherwise gone unused. After a failed sale of several abandoned lots in the 1990s that would have involved destroying some of these gardens around the city, some city residents founded the New York City Community Garden Coalition to protect these gardens.

From 2013 to 2015, NYCHA sold developers 54 lots in Brownsville, totaling . Some of these lots contained parks or parking lots. In December 2014 the HPD issued requests for qualifications to determine which developers could build new affordable housing on one of 91 empty HPD-owned lots in Brownsville. After controversy arose over the fact that some of these lots were actually garden sites, the HPD rescinded approval to build on 34 garden sites in Brownsville, while nine other garden sites in the area were approved for redevelopment.

===Points of interest===
The Loews Pitkin, an opulent , 2,827-seat movie theater built in 1929, was among 22 theaters in the area; the rest of the theaters had either been demolished or converted into stores. The Loews Pitkin, named after theater entrepreneur Marcus Loew, had fallen in disuse by the 1970s before being revitalized in the late 2000s. The theater&#x27;s decaying interior was used as a church and a furniture store before Poko Partners bought the space in 2008 and redeveloped the theater into a charter school and retail space for $43 million. The theater was renovated in response to residents&#x27; requests for more retail space, and as part of the theater&#x27;s refurbishment, the charter school would open in 2012 along with of retail space.

The NYPD&#x27;s 65th Precinct (originally the 73rd Precinct), built in 1901, covered most of the area until its closure in the mid-1980s. The old 65th Precinct building at 1546 East New York Avenue was then sold to a family with the last name of Chen. In 2004, the Chens sold the building to Family Services Network of New York, a nonprofit organization funded by the state government. Family Services borrowed $1.1 million, but failed to pay the mortgage. Despite Family Services&#x27; grandiose $3.8 million plan to rehabilitate the 65th Precinct building into a community center, it sits derelict , with graffiti on the walls, garbage in the interior, and jail cells still intact.

One block of Livonia Avenue from Barbey Street to Schenck Avenue is designated as &quot;African Burial Ground Square&quot;, commemorating an African burial ground at the site that was discovered in 2010. The site contains remains similar to those found in the African Burial Ground National Monument in lower Manhattan, as well as those discovered under the former 126th Street Depot in East Harlem. As part of the designation, the Schenck Playground, behind the New Lots branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, would be rethemed with African cultural motifs and designs.

Hyman Spitz Florists, one of the businesses that dates back to Brownsville&#x27;s initial settlement, was founded in 1898. It persisted at the same address, 1685 Pitkin Avenue, until 2004. Hyman Spitz Florists had helped provide flowers for such occasions as Donald and Ivana Trump&#x27;s wedding.

== Demographics ==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Brownsville was 58,300, a decrease of 799 (1.4%) from the 59,099 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 76.1% (44,364) African American, 0.8% (471) White, 0.3% (165) Native American, 0.7% (416) Asian, 0.0% (18) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (180) from other races, and 1.2% (703) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 20.6% (11,983) of the population. 29.9% of the population were high school graduates and 8.4% had a bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

The entirety of Community Board 16, which comprises Brownsville, had 84,525 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 75.1 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 28% are between the ages of 0–17, 27% between 25 and 44, and 23% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 12% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 16 was $30,207. In 2018, an estimated 28% of Brownsville residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in seven residents (14%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 57% in Brownsville, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Brownsville is considered to be low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

New York City Department of City Planning showed that in the 2020 census data, there were 40,000+ Black residents and 10,000 to 19,999 Hispanic residents. Each the White and Asian populations were less than 5000 residents.

==Police and crime==
The NYPD&#x27;s 73rd Precinct is located at 1470 East New York Avenue. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled separately by Police Service Area #2 (P.S.A. 2).

Brownsville has consistently been considered the murder capital of New York City, with the 73rd Precinct ranking 69th safest out of 69 city precincts for per-capita crime in 2009. That year, there were 3 murders per 10,000 residents (higher than in any other neighborhood in the city), making for 28 overall murders in Brownsville; in overall crime, the 73rd Precinct was the 66th safest out of 69 neighborhoods. In the 15 years between 1990 and 2005, reports of murder in Brownsville–Ocean Hill dropped 63 percent (to 22 murders in 2005); robberies 79 percent (to 597 in 2005); and felony assaults decreased 51 percent (to 562 in 2005). Crime rates in Brownsville had declined in the same manner that they had elsewhere in the city, but the declines were not as dramatic as in other areas of the city, with 72 people shot and 15 killed in Brownsville in 2013. With an incarceration rate of 1,698 per 100,000 residents, Brownsville&#x27;s incarceration rate is three times the city&#x27;s as a whole and higher than every other neighborhood&#x27;s incarceration rate. At a non-fatal assault rate of 175 per 100,000 people, Brownsville also sees the most violent crimes per capita out of any neighborhood in the city. By contrast, Morrisania, a Bronx neighborhood that once had a crime rate as high as Brownsville&#x27;s, saw its crime rate decline by 25 percent between 1998 and 2011, while Brownsville&#x27;s crime rate stayed roughly even during the same time period.

The social problems associated with poverty, from crime to drug addiction, have plagued the area for decades. Despite the decline of crime compared to its peak during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be a serious problem in the community, especially gang-related gun violence. Empty lots and unused storefronts are common in Brownsville due to high rates of crime, mostly in the area&#x27;s public housing developments. A reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that some of the area&#x27;s playgrounds were inadequately maintained with broken lights and unlocked gates, and that shootings were common in these public housing developments. Brownsville was so dangerous that one UPS driver, robbed at gunpoint, needed an armed security guard to accompany him while delivering packages to houses in the neighborhood. In an effort to reduce crime, the NYPD started a stop-and-frisk program in the early 2000s; this was controversial especially in Brownsville, with 93% of residents in one eight-block area reportedly being stopped and frisked (compared to a 7% rate citywide). However, serious crime per resident is decreasing, and from 2000 to 2011, the rate dropped from 45.0 to 35.3 serious crimes per 1,000 residents.

==Fire safety==
The firehouse for the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Company 231/Ladder Company 120/Battalion 44 is located in Brownsville. Engine Company 283/Division 15&#x27;s quarters are also located in Brownsville.

A , $32 million FDNY facility was completed at 1815 Sterling Place in 2019. Designed by Chicago-based architectural firm Studio Gang, the new facility is both an FDNY training center and the firehouse for Rescue Company 2. Ground broke on the project in July 2016. The new firehouse, announced in December 2015, replaced Rescue 2&#x27;s old location, a small building at 1472 Bergen Street in Crown Heights, which was built in the 1920s and had been occupied by Rescue 2 since 1985.

==Parks, open spaces, and recreation==

=== Parks ===
Just east of the Crown Heights–Utica Avenue subway station, on the border with Crown Heights, there is a park called Lincoln Terrace (also known as Arthur S. Somers Park), which slopes gently down toward the southern Brooklyn coastline. The New Lots Line transitions from a tunnel to an elevated structure within this park. The of land for Lincoln Terrace was purchased by the city in 1895–1897. In order to deter aircraft from flying through the area during World War I, parts of the park had turrets installed in &quot;serviceable but inconspicuous locations&quot; in 1918. Through 1935, additional land was added to the park (including land purchased from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company in 1928, which had built its New Lots Line in 1920). Streets were closed to make room for the extra parkland. The park was originally named after Abraham Lincoln, but in 1932, the western section of the park (west of Rockaway Parkway) was renamed after activist Arthur S. Somers, an area resident who had died that year. Around that time, the park and its playgrounds were refurbished.

Betsy Head Park is located in a lot on the north side of Livonia Avenue bounded by Strauss Street and Thomas S. Boyland Street. Opened in 1915, it is named after Betsy Head, a rich Briton, who died in 1907. In 1936, a new Olympic-size swimming pool, one of 11 across the city, was added as part of a Works Progress Administration project. In 2008, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Betsy Head Play Center as the first individual city landmark in Brownsville.

At Livonia Avenue and Powell Street, Livonia Park is named after Livonia, in the Baltic region in what is now Latvia and Estonia. Livonia Avenue itself is so named for the same reason. According to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, the park honors Livonia and its native people, the Livonians. The Livonians were never fully independent, instead being alternatively led by the Teutonic Order, Sweden, and the Russian Empire. The Kingdom of Livonia was a nominal state of Russia from 1570 to 1578 during the Livonian War, but did not actually gain independence. Eventually, the Livonians were assimilated into the larger Latvian population, keeping parts of their language and a few other cultural vestiges. The Russian Empire became communist as part of the October Revolution in 1917, and Latvia and Estonia gained independence soon after, only to become part of communist Russia again until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. The park itself was designated on August 15, 1969, as part of NYCHA&#x27;s development of the Tilden Houses. There are trees, benches, gaming spaces, a drinking fountain, and many grassy plots within the park. The red-and-white bricks in Livonia Park feature the colors of the Latvian flag.

=== Recreation ===
Brownsville also has its own recreation facility with indoor swimming pools, outdoor athletic fields, and a playground. The Brownsville Recreation Center at the corner of Linden Boulevard, Mother Gaston Boulevard, and Christopher Avenue. Like all other indoor pools in the city, the Brownsville Recreation Center requires a NYC Parks pool membership. It was opened in 1953 as the Brownsville Boys&#x27; Club, a &quot;one-room clubhouse&quot; affiliated with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. Over the next two years, the club raised $1.5 million in funds, and the city opened a brand-new recreation facility. Improvements were made to the center in the late 1990s and 2000s, including $265,000 of general repairs in 1996; $400,000 of heat and air conditioning refurbishments in 1998; and a $1.5 million renovation in 2008 that entailed installing a new playground, improving amenities such as benches and lighting, and replacing the athletic field with artificial turf.

The &quot;Soul in the Hole&quot; is a famous basketball court in Brownsville. The Hole is known for street basketball, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; characterizes it as having the &quot;toughest&quot; streetball competition in Brooklyn. It is located in the Brownsville Houses along Rockaway Avenue between Riverdale and Livonia Avenues. Famous players who played there included Fly Williams.

=== Other open spaces ===
The traffic triangle bounded by Pitkin and East New York Avenues and Legion Street was originally named Vanderveer Park after Peter L. Vandeveer, the former owner of the land constituting that triangle. Vanderveer donated the land in 1896, and in 1911, it was renamed Zion Park in recognition of the Jewish community. The Zion Park War Memorial, a monumental wall based on a design by sculptor Charles Cary Rumsey and architect Henry Beaumont Herts, was installed in the triangle and dedicated in 1925. During the 1970s, the monument was heavily vandalized, but it was restored and cleaned up by the 1990s. This monument features a star of David. The bas relief sculptures are mounted on a limestone stele and side pylons.

The Wyckoff Triangle, bounded by New Lots, Riverdale, and Van Siclen Avenues, is named after local property owner Hendrick Wyckoff, who ceded the land used for the traffic triangle. During the American Revolutionary War, Wyckoff was a spy for the colonists rebelling against the British. Through the 1920s, Wyckoff&#x27;s family maintained the park, which is now privately maintained because it is too small to be a NYC Parks public space.

==Politics and government==
Brownsville is a heavily Democratic area; in the 2012 presidential campaign, President Barack Obama &quot;won what was very close to a unanimous vote&quot; in the neighborhood.

The neighborhood is part of New York&#x27;s 9th congressional district, represented by Democrat Yvette Clarke . It is also part of the 20th State Senate district, represented by Democrat Zellnor Myrie, and the 55th State Assembly district, represented by Democrat Latrice Walker. Brownsville is located in New York&#x27;s 41st City Council district, represented by Democrat Darlene Mealy.

In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Rodham Clinton received 4,889 votes (73.9%) to Bernie Sanders&#x27;s 1,729 votes (26.1%). Brownsville had very few Republican primary voters: just 40 Brownsville voters cast ballots in the 2016 Republican primary.

==Health care==
Brownsville suffers from major health disparities in comparison to the rest of New York City. In 2006, Brownsville had the highest infant mortality rate in New York City (12.5 per 1,000 births), twice the overall city rate (5.9 per 1,000 births). , preterm births and births to teenage mothers were also more common in Brownsville than in other places citywide. In Brownsville, there were 127 preterm births per 1,000 live births (compared to 87 per 1,000 citywide), and 31.2 births to teenage mothers per 1,000 live births (compared to 20.2 per 1,000 citywide). In 2015, Brownsville had the lowest average life span (74.1 years) of any New York City neighborhood; the average life span in 2018 was 75.1 years, significantly lower than the city&#x27;s median life span. A New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene community health profile the next year found that in Brownsville, the average life expectancy is more than ten years shorter than in Manhattan&#x27;s Financial District. Brownsville has a high population of residents who are uninsured, or who receive healthcare through Medicaid. In 2018, this population of uninsured residents was estimated to be 12%, which is equal to the citywide rate.

Air pollution in Brownsville is , higher than the citywide and boroughwide averages. Seventeen percent of Brownsville residents are smokers, which is slightly higher than the city average of 14% of residents being smokers. In Brownsville, 41% of residents are obese, 13% are diabetic, and 33% have high blood pressure—compared to the citywide averages of 24%, 11%, and 28% respectively. In addition, 23% of children are obese, higher than the citywide average of 20%.

Eighty percent of residents eat some fruits and vegetables every day, which is lower than the city&#x27;s average of 87%. In 2018, 79% of residents described their health as &quot;good&quot;, &quot;very good&quot;, or &quot;excellent&quot;, slightly more than the city&#x27;s average of 78%. For every supermarket in Brownsville, there are 15 bodegas.

Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center is located in the neighborhood. The hospital has suffered from violence; in 2014, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a citation to the hospital for &quot;willful&quot; failure to protect hospital employees after an extensive series of incidents of violence against hospital workers took place.

Brownsville has one of the highest rates of psychiatric hospitalization in the city, with 1,727 such hospitalizations per 100,000 adults.

The area has also historically suffered from high levels of childhood lead exposure from environmental lead, particularly from lead-based paint in dilapidated housing stock.

==Education==

Brownsville has significantly high dropout rates in its schools. Brownsville also has one of the highest concentrations of &quot;persistently violent&quot; schools of any area in New York State, with five such schools in Brownsville and East New York on the 2015–2016 list of most dangerous schools. Students must pass through metal detectors and swipe ID cards to enter the buildings. This arose from two school shootings in East New York in 1991–1992 that, combined, resulted in the deaths of three students and the injury of one teacher. Other problems in local schools include low test scores, with 95% of students scoring below grade level on state tests.

Brownsville generally has a lower ratio of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . While 21% of residents have a college education or higher, 27% have less than a high school education and 52% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 40% of Brooklynites and 38% of city residents have a college education or higher. The percentage of Brownsville students excelling in reading and math has been increasing, with reading achievement rising from 26 percent in 2000 to 31 percent in 2011, and math achievement rising from 20 percent to 38 percent within the same time period.

Brownsville has the second-highest rate of student homelessness in Brooklyn. It also has the highest rate of elementary school student absenteeism in New York City, with 39 percent of Brownsville elementary school students missing twenty or more days per school year. Additionally, 65% of high school students in Brownsville graduate on time, less than the citywide average of 75%. As a result, Brownsville&#x27;s average educational attainment rates were low compared to the rest of the city, with few students continuing to college.

=== Schools ===
Public schools are operated by the New York City Department of Education. Due to the area&#x27;s high population density, there are 39 public and charter schools serving elementary and middle school students in Brownsville. Numbered public primary schools include P.S. 150 Christopher; P.S. 156 Waverly; P.S. 165 Ida Posner; P.S. 184 Newport; P.S. 189 Lincoln Terrace; P.S. 219 Kennedy-King; P.S. 284 Lew Wallace; P.S. 298; P.S. 327 Dr Rose B English; P.S. 332 Charles H Houston School; I.S. 392; P.S. 396 Special Education School; P.S. 398 Walter Weaver; P.S. 41 Francis White; P.S. 770 New American Academy; and P.S/I.S. 323 Elementary School. Until 2008, the neighborhood was also served by P.S. 183, the Daniel Chappie James Elementary School.

There are three high schools in Brownsville; two are housed in the same building at 226 Bristol Street. Teachers Preparatory opened in September 2001, while Frederick Douglass Academy VII opened in September 2004. Teachers Preparatory School serves 6th through 12th graders with 99% minority enrollment, receiving a grade of &quot;A&quot; on both its middle school and high school report cards for 2008. FDA VII serves 9th through 12th grades with 99% minority enrollment. The third high school is Brownsville Academy, which is a Diploma Plus transfer school serving 10th through 12th grades with a 100% minority enrollment. It received a &quot;Well Developed&quot; score for 2008–2009. It also received a grade of B on its 2007–2008 report card. Brownsville Academy, a relatively small school with 205 students as of 2016–2017, is located at 1150 East New York Avenue, close to the Crown Heights border.

=== Libraries ===
The Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) has two branches in Brownsville. The Brownsville branch is located on 61 Glenmore Avenue, near Watkins Street. It opened in 1905 and used a second-floor space of another building. The current branch opened in 1908.

The Stone Avenue branch is located at 581 Mother Gaston Boulevard. When it opened in 1914 as the Brownsville Children&#x27;s Library, it was among the world&#x27;s first children&#x27;s libraries, as well as one of the last Carnegie libraries in Brooklyn. The branch was renovated in 2014.

==Transportation==

=== Public transportation ===
The area is well-served by public transport. The New York City Subway serves Brownsville on the IRT New Lots Line () and BMT Canarsie Line (). The New Lots Line from Saratoga Avenue to Junius Street is definitively in Brownsville; additionally, the New Lots Line&#x27;s Sutter Avenue–Rutland Road station and the Canarsie Line from Atlantic Avenue to New Lots Avenue are located along the neighborhood&#x27;s borders with East Flatbush and East New York, respectively. Due to the lines being created by two different, competing subway companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, respectively), a direct transit connection does not exist between the two lines, although a free out-of-system transfer does exist. A pedestrian bridge from the Livonia Avenue station on the Canarsie Line spans west across the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Bay Ridge Branch to Junius Street, where an entrance to that street&#x27;s station along the New Lots Line is less than a block away. There are proposals to convert the overpass into a free-transfer passage between the two stations, due to increasing ridership and plans for additional housing in the area. Money is allocated in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority&#x27;s 2015–2019 Capital Program to build this transfer. The stations would also need to be upgraded to become compliant with mobility accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

MTA Regional Bus Operations operates bus lines in the area. The B15 bus crosses Brownsville horizontally, for the most part using New Lots Avenue; the B14 bus uses Pitkin and Sutter Avenues through its route in the area where Brownsville overlaps with East New York. North–south bus lines include the B7 on Saratoga Avenue and Thomas S Boyland Street and the B60 on Rockaway Avenue. The B8, B35, and B47 have segments along the outer borders of Brownsville, and the B8 and B35 both terminate along Hegeman Avenue in the neighborhood&#x27;s southwestern portion.

In 2011, 72% of residents used public transportation, up from 66% in 2000. More than 85% of residents live within of the subway.

=== Streets ===
The street grid aligns with the general East New York street grid, which contains streets that generally run north–south, though ten streets from the slightly diagonal street grid of Canarsie extend into Brownsville. The easternmost of these streets, East 98th Street, serves as the ending point for many main thoroughfares in central Brooklyn, including Church Avenue, Kings Highway, and Sutter Avenues.

As a result of its Jewish heritage, there are several streets named after Jewish community figures in the western portion of Brownsville. In 1913, nine years after writer Theodor Herzl died, residents successfully petitioned to rename Ames Street to Herzl Street, marking one of the few streets outside Israel that are named Herzl Street. One block away, the incorrectly spelled Strauss Street was named after two former Macy&#x27;s co-owners, brothers Nathan and Isidor Straus, the latter of whom died when his wife Ida gave up a seat on a lifeboat off the sinking RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;.

One of Brownsville&#x27;s main thoroughfares, Pitkin Avenue, is named after businessman John R. Pitkin of Connecticut. Pitkin developed East New York starting in 1835.

Hopkinson Street, originally named after Declaration of Independence signer Francis Hopkinson, was renamed in honor of State Assemblyman Thomas S. Boyland, who served the neighborhood from 1977 until his death in 1982. Incidentally, many places in Brownsville, including two schools and a housing development, are named after Boyland and two of his family members (his brother William F. Boyland Sr. and his nephew William Boyland Jr.), who also went into politics and represented Brownsville in various levels of local government.

Stone Avenue was renamed after Rosetta Gaston (1895–1981), founder of the Brownsville Heritage House on the avenue, as Mother Gaston Boulevard after her death. Mother Gaston, as she was called, operated the Heritage House inside the Stone Avenue Library, a Jacobean Revival-style library built in 1914 by William Tubby.

== In popular culture ==

The 1934 novel &quot;Call It Sleep&quot;, by Henry Roth, is about the Schearl family, who moves from Brownsville back to the Lower East Side. The main character, young David Schearl, must endure the &quot;terror of poverty&quot; on the Lower East Side. Brownsville, by contrast, is described in the book as a vast improvement over the Lower East Side. In addition, Alfred Kazin wrote about 1920s-era Brownsville in his memoir &quot;A Walker in the City&quot;.

<text>A tank car (International Union of Railways (UIC): tank wagon) or tanker is a type of railroad car (UIC: railway car) or rolling stock designed to transport liquid and gaseous commodities.
==History==

===Timeline===

The following major events occurred in the years noted:
*1865: Flatcars with banded wooden planks or decking mounted on top are employed for the first time to transport crude oil from the fields of Pennsylvania during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Laurence Myers of Philadelphia invented the &quot;Rotary Oil Car&quot;, as he named it. It was an improvement on a patent from 1851 of a freight car for transporting coal. The new invention patented on July 18, 1865, was for the transportation of crude oil and petroleum. It was the first appearance of an oil tank on a railroad flatcar. Three books mention his invention.
*1869: Wrought iron tanks, with an approximate capacity of per car, replace wooden tanks.
*1888: Tank-car manufacturers sell units directly to the oil companies, with capacities ranging from .
*1903: Tank-car companies develop construction safety standards. More than 10,000 tank cars are in operation.
*1915: A classification system is developed by the tank-car industry to ensure the correct match of car type to product being shipped. Some 50,000 tank cars are in use.
*1930: 140,000 tank cars transport some 103 commodities.
*1940s: Virtually every tank car is engaged in oil transport in support of the war effort.
*1945–1950: Welding replaces riveting in car construction (both underframes and tanks) for the major manufacturers, including American Car &amp; Foundry and General American. 
*1950: Pipelines and tank trucks begin to compete for liquid transport business.
*1963: The Union Tank Car Company introduces the &quot;Whale Belly&quot; tank car.

==Usage==
=== North America ===
Many variants exist due to the wide variety of liquids and gases transported. Tank cars can be pressurized or non-pressurized, insulated or non-insulated, and designed for single or multiple commodities. Non-pressurized cars have various fittings on the top and may have fittings on the bottom. Some of the top fittings are covered by a protective housing. Pressurized cars have a pressure plate, with all fittings, and a cylindrical protective housing at the top. Loading and unloading are done through the protective housing.

Tank cars are specialized pieces of equipment. As an example, the interior of the car may be lined with a material, such as glass, or other specialized coatings to isolate the tank contents from the tank shell. Care is taken to ensure that tank contents are compatible with tank construction.

As a result of this specialization, tank cars have generally been &quot;one-way&quot; cars. Other cars, like boxcars, can easily be reloaded with other goods for the return trip. Combinations of the two types were attempted, such as boxcars with fluid tanks slung beneath the floors. While the car could certainly carry a load in both directions, the limited tank size made this unsuccessful.

A large percentage of tank cars are owned by companies serviced by railroads instead of the railroads themselves. This can be verified by examining the reporting marks on the cars. These marks invariably end in &quot;X&quot;, meaning that the owner is not a common carrier.

Within the rail industry, tank cars are grouped by their type and not by the cargo carried. Food-service tank cars may be lined with stainless steel, glass, or plastic. Tank cars carrying dangerous goods are generally made of different types of steel, depending on the intended cargo and operating pressure. They may also be lined with rubber or coated with specialized coatings for tank protection or product purity purpose. The tank heads are also stronger to prevent ruptures during accidents. The whale-belly type is giving way to higher-capacity (longer), yet standard-width, AAR Plate &quot;C&quot;, cars.

All tank cars undergo periodic inspection for damage and corrosion. Pressure relief valves are inspected at every loading. Pressurized cars are pressure-tested regularly to ensure the integrity of the tank.

All tank cars operating throughout North America today feature AAR Type E double shelf couplers that are designed to prevent disengaging in event of an accident or derailment. This reduces the chance of couplers puncturing adjacent tank cars. However, if cars are prevented from disengaging in a derailment, the torsional forces of a derailing car can be transferred to other cars, resulting in the derailment of the adjacent cars.

Insulated cars (which may also incorporate heating or refrigeration systems) are used when the contents must be kept at a certain temperature. For example, the Linde tank car depicted below carries liquefied argon. Cars designed for multiple commodities are constructed of two or more tanks (compartments). Each compartment must have separate fittings. The lower capacity and added complexity of multicompartment cars means that they make up a small percentage of the tank car inventory.
==Specialized applications==

===DOT-111===

The DOT-111 tank car, designed to carry liquids such as denatured fuel ethanol, is built to a US standard. The design has been criticized on safety grounds. The train in the Lac-Mégantic derailment of 2013 was made up of 72 of these cars.

===DOT-112===

DOT-112 tank cars are used in North America to carry pressurized gases. One of these tank cars exploded in Waverly, Tennessee, killing 16, when a Louisville &amp; Nashville train derailed. While the clean up efforts were under way, the tank car, UTLX 83013, ended up exploding from a BLEVE.

===DOT-114===

DOT-114 tank cars are used in North America to carry pressurized gases.

===Milk cars===

A milk car is a specialized type of tank car designed to carry raw milk between farms, creameries, and processing plants.

Milk is now commonly chilled, before loading, and transported in a glass-lined tank car. Such tank cars are often placarded as &quot;Food service use only&quot;.

===Liquid hydrogen tank car===

Tank cars of this type are designed to carry cryogenic liquid Hydrogen (LH2). North American cars are classified as DOT113, AAR204W, and AAR204XT

===Pickle cars===
A pickle car was a specialized type of tank car designed to carry pickles. This car consisted of several wooden or metal vats (typically three or four) and was often roofed. Pickles which are preserved in salt brine were loaded through hatches in the roof.

===Tank containers===
A tank container, also known as ISO tank, is a specialized type of container designed to carry bulk liquids, such as chemicals, liquid hydrogen, gases and food grade products. Both hazardous and non hazardous products can be shipped in tank containers. A standard tank container is long, high and wide. The tank, which is made from stainless steel, is held within a box-shaped frame with the same shape as an intermodal container. This allows it to be carried on multiple modes of transport, such as truck, rail and ship.
===Torpedo wagons===
A torpedo car or bottle car is a type of railroad car used in steel mills to haul molten pig iron from the blast furnace to begin the process of primary steelmaking.

The thermally-insulated vessel is mounted on trunnions, and designed to endure extremely high temperatures, as well as keeping the metal in a molten state over extended periods of time. The vessel can be pivoted along its longitudinal axis to empty the pig iron into a ladle. The name is derived from the vessel&#x27;s resemblance to a torpedo.
===Vinegar cars===

A vinegar car is a specialized type of tank car designed to transport vinegar. The largest such car built was built by Morrison Railway Supply Corporation in 1968. The car&#x27;s underframe included all of the modern facets of freight car design including roller bearing trucks and cushioning devices built by FreightMaster, while the tank that rode on it, made of Douglas fir, had a capacity of . The car, in what has been called &#x27;the largest wooden tank car ever built&#x27;, took 18 months to build.

The Reinhart Vinegar Car can be seen at the Toronto Harbourfront Museum. 

Vinegar is now moved in ordinary tank cars lined with glass, plastic, or alloy steel.
===&quot;Whale belly&quot; cars===
In the early 1960s, the Union Tank Car Company introduced a series of &quot;whale belly&quot; tank cars which offered increased capacity. These cars carried from in CSOX #31084 to as much as in GATX #96500, which had been conceived as a &#x27;rolling experiment&#x27;. The largest tank car ever placed into regular service, UTLX #83699, was rated at . It entered service in 1963 and was used for over 20 years. GATX 96500 is now on display at the National Museum of Transportation in Saint Louis, Missouri. This car is long, weighs empty and rides on four two-axle trucks for weight distribution. It transported diverse substances, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and anhydrous ammonia.
== Safety ==

Where AAR couplers are fitted, the AAR type &quot;F&quot; coupler is preferred as these are less likely to become separated in a derailment and become a puncture hazard for other tank cars. A type &quot;E&quot; coupler that has shelves over and under the coupler that prevent the coupler sliding out of position after a derailment is used on some hazardous materials tank cars.

In addition, some types of tank cars have a second end plate visible from the exterior, to further avoid end punctures.

It is also preferable if each tap (valve) is recessed within the body of the tank so as to present a reduced knock-off hazard during a derailment. 

Tank cars have been involved in many rail disasters, including the Lac-Mégantic derailment in Quebec in 2013, the Nishapur train disaster in Iran in 2004, and the Viareggio train derailment in Italy in 2009.
== Outside North America ==

Outside of North America, tank cars are also known as tank wagons or tanker wagons. In the United Kingdom tank wagons were traditionally four-wheel vehicles. Some long-wheelbase four-wheelers are still in use but bogie vehicles are now used as well.

<text>Sky Sports Racing (formerly At The Races) is a British pay television channel devoted primarily to horse racing. The channel is operated by ATTHERACES Limited, a joint venture between Sky Group, Arena Racing Company and various racecourses. The channel broadcasts coverage of domestic, European and international horse racing events. The channel also broadcasts some greyhound racing.

In January 2019, after previously operating autonomously from its sisters, the channel was re-launched as part of the Sky Sports family of channels.

== History ==
It was originally launched on 1 May 2002 as Attheraces, a partnership between the aforementioned entities plus Channel Four Television Corporation. It stopped broadcasting on 29 March 2004 due to financial problems but, after restructuring, was relaunched on 11 June 2004 without Channel Four.

On 30 April 2018, it was announced that At The Races would be relaunched as part of the larger Sky Sports portfolio as Sky Sports Racing by the end of the year. With the relaunch, the channel will have wider distribution within Sky Sports&#x27; packages, and availability on mobiles through Sky Go. Within the same month, it was announced Chester Race Company had signed a 10-year deal to bring Live Racing from Bangor-On-Dee and Chester to Sky Sports Racing from March 2019. In July 2018, it was also announced that beginning also in March 2019, it would also hold rights to Ascot. The rebranding occurred 1 January 2019 although the &quot;At the Races&quot; brand remains as the channel&#x27;s parent company, while the website and app became the channel&#x27;s digital partners.

==Programming==
The channel starts broadcasting at 9am every day. In the mornings on the hour, Racing News is shown, followed by reviews of previous days racing. This format is repeated several times and updated with interviews. Presenters change over in the early afternoon and the lead presenter is joined by a guest to discuss the afternoon&#x27;s racing. Until 1 January 2019, it was produced at the SIS broadcast facility in Milton Keynes. It is now produced from the newly automated Studio G at Sky Campus in Isleworth.

<doc id="1185571" wikidata="Q5533523" url="?curid=1185571" title="Genovese Drug Stores">
<text>Genovese Drug Stores was a pharmacy chain with stores in New York City, Long Island, northern New Jersey, Fairfield County, Connecticut, and Hartford County, Connecticut. It was acquired by JCPenney in 1998 and merged with its Eckerd Corporation subsidiary.

==History==
Genovese Drug Stores was founded in 1924 by Joseph Genovese in Astoria, Queens. In 1955, Joseph W. Genovese Jr., the son of the founder and the chairman of the board, introduced self‐service in the chain. 

Joseph Jr. died in December 1975 at the age of 46 after undergoing surgery. His father died in November 1978 at the age of 75. His second son, Leonard Genovese, replaced him as chairman.

By 1978, the chain had 50 locations with headquarters in Melville, New York. In the early 1980s, some locations added arcade video games as an alternative source of revenue. Genovese also operated Genrex, a nursing home division during this time. The company opened its first Manhattan location in 1993. That year, it also opened its 100th store.

In January 1998, the company closed 5 stores and cut 11% of its workforce due to declining profitability.

In November 1998, the chain was acquired by JC Penney, the parent company of Eckerd, for $432 million in stock and the assumption of $60 million in debt. At that time, the chain was headquartered in Melville, New York and had 141 stores with 5,000 employees. It was still almost entirely owned by the Genovese family.

Following the acquisition, the new owners planned to convert all Genovese locations to the Eckerd name within a year. However, the chain ultimately remained. By 2003, all Genovese stores were remodeled and rebranded as Eckerd. 

Three years later, Eckerd was in turn purchased by Rite Aid and all locations were rebranded. In 2023, Rite Aid filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Despite shutting down 20 years prior, Genovese Drug Stores was still listed in the filing.

<doc id="1185576" wikidata="Q827402" url="?curid=1185576" title="Putāruru">
<text>Putāruru is a small town in the South Waikato District and the Waikato region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It lies on the western side of the Mamaku Ranges and in the upper basin of the Waihou River. It is on the Oraka Stream 65 kilometres south-east of Hamilton. State Highway 1 and the Kinleith Branch railway run through the town.

== Name ==
The town gets its name from a historic event which occurred nearby. Korekore a granddaughter of Raukawa, the founder of the Ngāti Raukawa iwi, was murdered by her husband Parahore. Her servant Ruru witnessed her murder and escaped into the forest where he hid and waited for Parahore and his men to give up their pursuit of him. The place where he exited the forest was named &quot;Te Puta a Ruru&quot; or &quot;the exit of Ruru&quot;. This was eventually shorted to Putāruru.

==History and culture==
===Pre-colonial history===

There were several Māori settlements in the Putāruru district in pre-colonial times. Ngāti Raukawa is the main tribe or iwi in the area and Ngāti Mahana is the hapū (subtribe) within Putāruru. During Te Rauparaha&#x27;s migration to the Cook Strait area in the 1820s, many Ngāti Raukawa people moved from these settlements to Rangitikei and Manawatu localities, and others followed after the Siege of Ōrākau in 1864. Te Kooti and his followers were pursued through the district early in 1870 by a force under Lt-Col. Thomas McDonnell.

===European settlement===
The Patetere Block, containing the future town site of Putāruru, was acquired from the Māori in the 1860s. In the early 1880s large areas in the Putāruru district came into the possession of the Patetere Land Company, and from 1883 much of this land passed into the hands of the Thames Valley Land Company. Roadmaking commenced in the late 1880s, but the railway, begun by the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Co., was the most important factor in the progress of settlement in the area.

The first settler in the district bought his section in 1892.

In the 1880s Putāruru consisted of little more than a hotel and a blacksmith shop. 

Exotic afforestation was begun in the district some time after 1910 by a land and timber company with an outlet to the Hamilton-Rotorua railway near Pinedale. Commercial tree planting with &quot;Pinus radiata&quot; took place between 1924 and 1928 on the Pinedale Block. Milling began in 1940–41 and by 1951 the area had been cut out and replanted. Larger areas further south were planted in 1924 for future milling and to provide the raw material for pulp and paper manufacture. The town of Putāruru was surveyed in 1905 and on 18 December an area of 50,987 acres (206 km2), which had been acquired from the Thames Valley Land Co. by the Crown and included town allotments in Putāruru and Lichfield, was opened by ballot.

The history of the local timber industry is preserved in the New Zealand Timber Museum.

Much of the land in the Putāruru district suffered from a cobalt deficiency, which made farming practically impossible, but since 1935 measures have been taken to restore fertility, and farming has expanded. Putāruru was created a town district in 1926, and on 1 July 1947 it was constituted a borough.

===Marae===

The Putāruru area has two marae, affiliated with the hapū of Ngāti Raukawa:

* Mangakāretu Marae and Ngā Hau e Maha meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Ahuru
* Whakaaratamaiti Marae and Korōria meeting house are affiliated with Ngāti Ahuru and Ngāti Mahana

In October 2020, the Government committed $1,259,392 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Mangakāretu Marae, Whakaaratamaiti Marae and 6 other Ngāti Raukawa marae, creating 18 jobs.

==== Bent St. Skate Park ====
One of Putaruru’s most prominent features is it historical skate-bowl park. It was built in the 1980s, as one of the first skate parks in the country, and was recently chosen for a major refurbishment project. This community-led project is set to receive $550,000 from the South Waikato District Council in order to facilitate its upgrade. Intended upgrades include additional skating features, court area, and seating area. 

==Demographics==
Putāruru covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

==Economy==

Putāruru&#x27;s economy is based on farming, forestry and timber production.

The nearby Blue Spring is the current source of about 70% of New Zealand&#x27;s bottled water. Much of the town&#x27;s water comes from the spring, which is on the Waihou River to the north east.

== Railways ==
===New Zealand Railways Rotorua Branch===

Construction of the Rotorua Branch line was started by the New Zealand Thames Valley Land Company (NZTVLC). The line reached Oxford (Tīrau) on 8 March 1886 and Putāruru and Lichfield, further south-east, on Monday 21 June 1886.

The New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) took over the line on 1 April 1886.

The Putāruru-Ngātira section of the line to Rotorua was built by contractor Daniel Fallon, and work was underway by April 1887. 

The branch opened on 8 December 1894. Putāruru was then served by the Rotorua Express.

===Taupo Totara Timber Company Railway===

In the early 1900s the Taupo Totara Timber Company (TTT) acquired bush blocks north and north-west of Lake Taupō and erected a sawmill at Mokai. The company built a railway between Mokai and Putāruru, where it connected with the NZ Government Railway. The TTT railway opened in 1905 as a private carrier, carrying TTT staff and their families, guests,

 freight, and mail between Putāruru and Mokai.

From January 29, 1908, the TTT Railway opened its freight and passenger services to the public.

===New Zealand Railways Kinleith Branch===

The NZ Government purchased a section of the TTT Railway, from Putāruru to the &quot;19-Mile Peg&quot;, near the present-day location of the Kinleith Paper Mill south of Tokoroa. From Tuesday, 10 June 1947, the NZ Government took over the operation of this part of the TTT line.

This section of railway was reconstructed under a NZ Government scheme for development of the Waikato River basin and surrounding areas. The project was completed on 6 October 1952.

===Putāruru Railway Station===

Putāruru railway station was near the junction of Arapuni and Princes Streets, north of the junction of the Kinleith Branch with the former Rotorua Branch.

In August 1886 the station had a by shelter shed, three cottages, a by goods shed and an incomplete station master&#x27;s house.

Putāruru was still a flag station in 1890, when the daily train took about 3 hours to cover the between Putāruru and Frankton (Hamilton).

About the time of the Rotorua Branch&#x27;s completion, the station was rebuilt and extended to about long. It had a refreshment room and a bookstall and, from 1907, the railway yard had a turntable and handled much livestock, as well as timber. The refreshment room, run by the hotel until 1919, burnt down in 1925 and was replaced by a room to the south of the main building, which closed in 1968.

Putāruru railway station closed to passengers on 12 November 1968 and freight on 10 December 2002, though it was served by the Geyserland Express from 1991 to 2001. The station was demolished during March and April 2013. Only a signals equipment shelter and a passing loop now remain on the station site.



=== Taumangi railway station ===

Taumangi (or Taumanga) was a flag station north of Putāruru and south of Tīrau. It was just south of Taumangi Road. In 1923 Taumangi Road was diverted north, when a bridge replaced the former level crossing.

Taumangi opened on the same day as Putāruru, 8 March 1886. By August 1886 there was a by shelter shed and two cottages and by 1896 there was also a platform and cart approach. In 1925 it was noted that inwards traffic was of timber, shingle, gravel, coal, 13 loads of manure, a wagon of lime, hardware and small goods. The public siding closed on 8 September 1941, as it was in a poor condition, but the station remained open for passengers until 22 November 1948, and for parcels, and roadside traffic until 30 July 1951. There is now only a single line through the station site.

<doc id="1185578" wikidata="Q1348502" url="?curid=1185578" title="Genovese crime family">
<text>The Genovese crime family (), also sometimes referred to as the Westside, is an Italian-American Mafia crime family and one of the &quot;Five Families&quot; that dominate organized crime activities in New York City and New Jersey as part of the American Mafia. The Genovese family has generally maintained a varying degree of influence over many of the smaller mob families outside New York, including ties with the Philadelphia, Cleveland, Patriarca, and Buffalo crime families.

The modern family was founded by Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano and was known as the Luciano crime family from 1931 to 1957, when Vito Genovese became boss. Genovese was head of the family during the McClellan hearings in 1963, which gave the Five Families their current names. Originally in control of the waterfront on the West Side of Manhattan as well as the docks and the Fulton Fish Market on the East River waterfront, the family was run between 1981 and 2005 by &quot;The Oddfather&quot;, Vincent &quot;The Chin&quot; Gigante, who feigned insanity by shuffling unshaven through New York&#x27;s Greenwich Village wearing a tattered bath robe and muttering to himself incoherently to avoid prosecution.

The Genovese family is the oldest and the largest of the &quot;Five Families&quot;. Finding new ways to make money in the 21st century, the family took advantage of lax due diligence by banks during the housing bubble with a wave of mortgage frauds. Prosecutors say loan shark victims obtained home equity loans to pay off debts to their mob bankers. The family found ways to use new technology to improve on illegal gambling, with customers placing bets through offshore sites via the Internet.

Although the leadership of the Genovese family seemed to have been in limbo after the death of Gigante in 2005, sources believe that Liborio &quot;Barney&quot; Bellomo is the current boss of the organization. The FBI described the Genovese family as the largest and most powerful of the Five Families in December 2001. The family is unique in today&#x27;s Mafia, and has benefited greatly from members following &quot;omertà&quot;, a code of conduct emphasizing secrecy and non-cooperation with law enforcement and the justice system. While many mobsters from across the country have testified against their crime families since the 1980s, the Genovese family has had only eleven members and associates turn state&#x27;s evidence in its history. Detective Joseph J. Coffey of the New York Organized Crime Task Force described the Genovese family as &quot;the Ivy League of the underworld&quot; in April 1998.

==History==

===Origins===

The Genovese crime family originated from the Morello gang of East Harlem, the first Mafia family in New York City. In 1892, Giuseppe Morello arrived in New York from the village of Corleone, Sicily, Italy. Morello&#x27;s half-brothers Nicholas, Vincenzo, Ciro, and the rest of his family joined him in New York the following year. The Morello brothers formed the 107th Street Mob and began dominating the Italian neighborhood of East Harlem, parts of Manhattan, and the Bronx.

One of Giuseppe Morello&#x27;s strongest allies was Ignazio &quot;the Wolf&quot; Lupo, a mobster who controlled Manhattan&#x27;s Little Italy. In 1903, Lupo married Morello&#x27;s half-sister, uniting both organizations. The Morello-Lupo alliance continued to prosper in 1903, when the group began a major counterfeiting ring with powerful Sicilian &quot;mafioso&quot; Vito Cascioferro, printing $5 bills in Sicily and smuggling them into the US.

New York police detective Joseph Petrosino, later assassinated while in Sicily seeking evidence to permit the deportation of Morello and other mafiosi, began investigating the Morello family&#x27;s counterfeiting operation, the barrel murders, and the black hand extortion letters. On November 15, 1909, Morello, Lupo, and others were arrested on counterfeiting charges. In February 1910, Morello and Lupo were sentenced to twenty-five and thirty years in prison, respectively.

In 1910 the Lomonte Brothers, cousins of Morello, ran East Harlem until 1915. Fortunato Lomonte was shot and killed in 1914 on East 108th st. Tomasso Lomonte and cousin Rose Lomonte were both shot and killed in 1915 on East 116th st.

===Mafia-Camorra War===
As the Morello family increased in power and influence, bloody territorial conflicts arose with other Italian gangs in New York. The Morellos had an alliance with Giosue Gallucci, a prominent East Harlem businessman and &quot;Camorrista&quot; with local political connections. On May 17, 1915, Gallucci was murdered in a power struggle between the Morellos and the Neapolitan Camorra organization, which consisted of two Brooklyn gangs run by Pellegrino Morano and Alessandro Vollero. The fight over Gallucci&#x27;s rackets became known as the Mafia-Camorra War.

After months of fighting, Morano offered a truce. A meeting was arranged at a Navy Street cafe owned by Vollero. On September 7, 1916, Nicholas Morello and his bodyguard Charles Ubriaco were ambushed and killed upon arrival by five members of the Camorra gang. In 1917, Morano was charged with Morello&#x27;s murder after &quot;Camorrista&quot; Ralph Daniello implicated him in the murder. By 1918, law enforcement had sent many Camorra members to prison, decimating the Camorra in New York and ending the war. Many of the remaining Camorra members joined the Morello family.

The Morellos now faced stronger rivals than the Camorra. With the passage of Prohibition in 1920 and the ban of alcohol sales, the family regrouped and built a lucrative bootlegging operation in Manhattan. In 1920, both Morello and Lupo were released from prison and Brooklyn Mafia boss Salvatore D&#x27;Aquila ordered their murders. This is when Giuseppe &quot;Joe&quot; Masseria and Rocco Valenti, a former Brooklyn Camorra, began to fight for control of the Morello family.

On December 29, 1920, Masseria&#x27;s men murdered Valenti&#x27;s ally, Salvatore Mauro. Then, on May 8, 1922, the Valenti gang murdered Vincenzo Terranova. Masseria&#x27;s gang retaliated killing Morello member Silva Tagliagamba. On August 11, 1922, Masseria&#x27;s men murdered Valenti, ending the conflict, as Masseria took over the Morello family.

===The Castellammarese era===

During the mid-1920s, Masseria continued to expand his bootlegging, extortion, loansharking, and illegal gambling rackets throughout New York. To operate and protect these rackets, he recruited many ambitious young mobsters, including future heavyweights Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Frank Costello, Joseph &quot;Joey A&quot; Adonis, Vito Genovese, and Albert Anastasia. Luciano soon became a top aide in Masseria&#x27;s organization.

By the late 1920s, Masseria&#x27;s main rival was boss Salvatore Maranzano, who had come from Sicily to run the Castellammarese clan. Their rivalry eventually escalated into the bloody Castellammarese War. As the war turned against Masseria, Luciano, seeing an opportunity to switch allegiance, decided to eliminate him in 1931. In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer Masseria&#x27;s death in return for taking over his rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command.

Adonis had joined the Masseria faction, and when Masseria heard about Luciano&#x27;s betrayal, he approached Adonis about killing Luciano. However, Adonis instead warned Luciano about the murder plot.

On April 15, 1931, Masseria was killed at Nuova Villa Tammaro, a Coney Island restaurant, while playing cards with Luciano, who allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, when four gunmen (Anastasia, Genovese, Adonis, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel) shot Masseria to death then escaping in a car driven by Ciro &quot;The Artichoke King&quot; Terranova. It was reported that Terranova was too nervous to drive, so Siegel took the driver&#x27;s seat and drove the car out of the crime scene.

With Maranzano&#x27;s blessing, Luciano became his lieutenant and took over Masseria&#x27;s gang, ending the Castellammarese War. Between August 1 and 3, 1931, Maranzano called a meeting where crime bosses met at Nuova Villa Tammaro in Coney Island for a bacchanalian banquet to celebrate the death of Masseria right on the spot where he was murdered and another one on Washington Avenue at a hall in the Bronx. Maranzano called another meeting of crime bosses in Wappingers Falls, New York, where he declared himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (&quot;boss of all bosses&quot;). Under Maranzano rule the Italian-American gangs in New York City were reorganized into Five Families headed by Luciano, Joe Profaci, Tommy Gagliano, Vincent Mangano, and himself. Maranzano also whittled down the rival families&#x27; rackets in favor of his own. Luciano appeared to accept these changes, but was merely biding his time before removing Maranzano. Although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that Maranzano was even more greedy, power-hungry and hidebound than Masseria had been.

By September 1931, Maranzano realized Luciano was a threat, and hired Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll, an Irish gangster, to kill him. However, Tommy Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. On September 10, Maranzano ordered Luciano, Genovese, and Costello to come to his office at the 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Convinced that Maranzano planned to murder them, Luciano decided to take pre-emptive action. He sent to Maranzano&#x27;s office four Jewish gangsters, secured with the aid of Siegel and Meyer Lansky, whose faces were unknown to Maranzano&#x27;s people. Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano&#x27;s bodyguards. The other two, aided by Lucchese, stabbed Maranzano multiple times before shooting him.

===Luciano and the Commission===
After Maranzano&#x27;s murder, Luciano called a meeting in Chicago with various bosses, where he proposed a Commission to serve as the governing body for organized crime. Designed to settle all disputes and decide which families controlled which territories, the Commission has been called Luciano&#x27;s greatest innovation. Luciano&#x27;s goals with the Commission were to quietly maintain his own power over all the families, and to prevent future gang wars; the bosses approved the idea of the Commission.

The Commission&#x27;s first test came in 1935, when they ordered Dutch Schultz to drop his plans to murder Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey. Luciano argued that an assassination of Dewey would precipitate a massive law enforcement crackdown. An enraged Schultz vowed to kill Dewey anyway and walked out of the meeting.

Anastasia, now the leader of Murder, Inc., approached Luciano with information that Schultz had asked him to stake out Dewey&#x27;s apartment building on Fifth Avenue. Upon hearing the news, the Commission held a discreet meeting to discuss the matter. After six hours of deliberations, the Commission ordered Lepke Buchalter to eliminate Schultz. On October 23, 1935, before he could kill Dewey, Schultz was shot in a tavern in Newark, New Jersey, and succumbed to his injuries the following day.

On May 13, 1936, Luciano&#x27;s pandering trial began. Dewey prosecuted the case that Eunice Carter had built against Luciano, accusing him of being part of a massive prostitution ring known as &quot;the Combination&quot;. During the trial, Dewey exposed Luciano for lying on the witness stand through direct quizzing and records of telephone calls; Luciano also had no explanation for why his federal income tax records claimed he made only $22,000 a year, while he was obviously a wealthy man.

Dewey&#x27;s case against Luciano on the prostitution charges actually leveled in the indictment, on the other hand, rested on much shakier ground: first on the testimony of Joe Bendix, who was discredited by his own testimony as well as that of others, and then later on the testimony of three prostitutes, whom Dewey rewarded by either paying for a trip to Europe after the trial or arranging for lucrative film and magazine deals. All three witnesses subsequently recanted their testimony.

On June 7, 1936, Luciano was convicted on 62 counts of compulsory prostitution. On June 18, he was sentenced to thirty to fifty years in state prison, along with David Betillo and others.

Luciano continued to run his crime family from prison, relaying his orders through Genovese, his acting boss. However, in 1937, Genovese fled to Naples to avoid an impending indictment for murder in New York. Luciano appointed Costello, his &quot;consigliere&quot;, as the new acting boss and overseer of Luciano&#x27;s interests.

During World War II, federal agents came to Luciano for help in preventing enemy sabotage on the New York waterfront and other activities. Luciano agreed to help, in return for a pardon from the State of New York, made contingent on Luciano&#x27;s deportation to Italy. In reality Luciano provided insignificant assistance to the Allied cause.

After the end of the war, the arrangement with Luciano became public knowledge. To prevent further embarrassment, the government followed through on its plans to deport Luciano on condition that he never return to the U.S. In 1946, Luciano was taken from prison and deported to Italy, where he died in 1962.

===The Prime Minister===

From May 1950 to May 1951, the U.S. Senate conducted a large-scale investigation of organized crime, commonly known as the Kefauver Hearings, chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. Costello was convicted of contempt of the Senate and sentenced to eighteen months in prison. Kefauver concluded that New York politician Carmine DeSapio was assisting the activities of Costello, and that Costello had become influential in decisions made by the Tammany Hall political machine. DeSapio admitted to having met Costello several times, but insisted that &quot;politics was never discussed&quot;.

In 1952, the federal government began proceedings to strip Costello of his U.S. citizenship and he was indicted for evasion of $73,417 in income taxes between 1946 and 1949. He was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $20,000. In 1954, Costello appealed the conviction and was released on $50,000 bail; from 1952 to 1961, he was in and out of half a dozen federal and local prisons and jails, his confinement interrupted by periods when he was out on bail pending determination of appeals.

===The return of Genovese===
Costello ruled for twenty peaceful years, but his quiet reign ended when Genovese was extradited from Italy to New York. During his absence, Costello demoted Genovese from underboss to &quot;caporegime&quot;, leaving Genovese determined to take control of the family. Soon after his arrival in the U.S., Genovese was acquitted of the 1936 murder charge that had driven him into exile. Free of legal entanglements, he started plotting against Costello with the assistance of Mangano family underboss Carlo Gambino.

On May 2, 1957, Luciano mobster Vincent &quot;the Chin&quot; Gigante shot Costello in the side of the head as Costello returned to his apartment. Gigante&#x27;s aim proved errant, however, and Costello survived the attack with no more than a flesh wound. Costello claimed he could not identify his attacker; Gigante was later acquitted when prosecuted for the shooting.

Months later, Anastasia, the boss of the Mangano family and a powerful ally of Costello&#x27;s, was murdered by Gambino&#x27;s gunmen at the Park Central Hotel in Manhattan. With Anastasia&#x27;s death, Carlo Gambino seized control of the Mangano family. Fearing for his life and isolated after the shootings, Costello quietly retired and surrendered control of the Luciano family to Genovese.
Having taken control of what was renamed the Genovese crime family in 1957, Genovese decided to organize a Mafia conference to legitimize his new position. Held at mobster Joseph &quot;Joe the Barber&quot; Barbara&#x27;s estate in Apalachin, New York, the Apalachin meeting attracted over 100 mobsters from around the nation. However, local law enforcement stumbled upon the meeting and quickly surrounded the estate. As the meeting broke up, the police stopped a car driven by Russell Bufalino, whose passengers included Genovese and three other men, at a roadblock as they left the estate. Mafia leaders were chagrined by the public exposure and bad publicity from the Apalachin meeting, and generally blamed Genovese for the fiasco. All those apprehended were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years, but all the convictions were overturned on appeal in 1960.

Wary of Genovese gaining more power in the Commission, Gambino used the Apalachin meeting as an excuse to move against his former ally. Gambino, Luciano, Costello, and Lucchese allegedly lured Genovese into a drug-dealing scheme that ultimately resulted in his conspiracy indictment and conviction. In 1959, Genovese was sentenced to fifteen years in prison on narcotics charges. Genovese, who was the most powerful boss in New York, had been effectively eliminated as a rival by Gambino.

===The Valachi Hearings===

Genovese soldier Joe Valachi was convicted of narcotics violations in 1959, and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Valachi&#x27;s motivations for becoming a government informant had been the subject of some debate; Valachi claimed to be testifying as a public service and to expose a powerful criminal organization that he had blamed for ruining his life, but it is possible he was hoping for government protection as part of a plea bargain in which he was sentenced to life imprisonment instead of the death penalty for a 1962 murder.

While serving his sentence for heroin trafficking, Valachi came to fear that Genovese, also serving a sentence on the same charge, had ordered his murder. On June 22, 1962, using a pipe left near some construction work, Valachi bludgeoned an inmate to death whom he had mistaken for Joseph DiPalermo, a Mafia member he believed had been contracted to kill him. After time with FBI handlers, Valachi came forward with a story of Genovese giving him a kiss on the cheek, which he took as a &quot;kiss of death&quot;. A $100,000 bounty for Valachi&#x27;s death had been placed by Genovese.

Soon after, Valachi decided to cooperate with the US Justice Department. In October 1963, he testified before Arkansas Senator John L. McClellan&#x27;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the US Senate Committee on Government Operations, known as the Valachi hearings, stating that the Italian-American Mafia actually existed, the first time a member had acknowledged its existence in public. Valachi&#x27;s testimony was the first major violation of omertà, breaking his blood oath. He is credited with popularization of the term &quot;cosa nostra&quot;.

Although Valachi&#x27;s disclosures never led directly to the prosecution of any Mafia leaders, he provided many details of history of the Mafia, operations, and rituals; aided in the solution of several unsolved murders; and named many members and the major crime families. The trial exposed American organized crime to the world through Valachi&#x27;s televised testimony.

===Front bosses and the ruling panels===
After Genovese was sent to prison in 1959, the family leadership secretly established a &quot;Ruling Panel&quot; to run the family in his absence. This first panel included acting boss Thomas &quot;Tommy Ryan&quot; Eboli, underboss Gerardo &quot;Jerry&quot; Catena, and Catena&#x27;s protégé Philip &quot;Benny Squint&quot; Lombardo. After Genovese died in 1969, Lombardo was named his successor.

However, the family appointed a series of &quot;front bosses&quot; to masquerade as the official family boss. The aim of these deceptions was to protect Lombardo by confusing law enforcement as to who was the true leader of the family.

In the late 1960s, Gambino lent $4 million to Eboli for a drug scheme in an attempt to gain control of the Genovese family. When Eboli failed to pay back his debt, Gambino, with Commission approval, had him murdered in 1972.

After Eboli&#x27;s death, Genovese &quot;capo&quot; and Gambino ally Frank &quot;Funzi&quot; Tieri was appointed as the new front boss. In reality, the Genovese family created a new ruling panel to run the organization. This second panel consisted of Catena, Lombardo, and Michele &quot;Big Mike&quot; Miranda. In 1981, Tieri became the first Mafia boss to be convicted under the new RICO Act and died in prison later that year.

After Tieri&#x27;s imprisonment, the family reshuffled its leadership. The &quot;capo&quot; of the Manhattan faction, Anthony &quot;Fat Tony&quot; Salerno, became the new front boss. Lombardo, the &quot;de facto&quot; boss of the family, soon retired and Gigante, the triggerman on the failed Costello hit, took actual control of the family.

In 1985, US Attorney General for the Southern District of New York, Rudolph Giuliani set his sights on taking down the Mafia Commission through wiretaps, cooperating witnesses, and surveillance cameras. In 1985, Salerno was convicted in the Mafia Commission Trial and sentenced to 100 years in federal prison. In 1986, shortly after Salerno&#x27;s conviction, his longtime right-hand man, Vincent &quot;The Fish&quot; Cafaro, turned informant and told the FBI that Salerno had been the front boss for Gigante. Cafaro also revealed that the Genovese family had been keeping up this ruse since 1969.

After the 1980 murder of Philadelphia boss Angelo &quot;Gentle Don&quot; Bruno, Gigante and Lombardo began manipulating the rival factions in the war-torn Philadelphia family. They finally gave their support to Philadelphia mobster Nicodemo &quot;Little Nicky&quot; Scarfo, who in return gave the Genovese mobsters permission to operate in Atlantic City in 1982.

===The Oddfather===

Gigante built a vast network of bookmaking and loansharking rings, and from extortion of garbage, shipping, trucking, and construction companies seeking labor peace or contracts from carpenters&#x27;, Teamsters, and laborers&#x27; unions, including those at the Javits Center, as well as protection payoffs from merchants at the Fulton Fish Market. Gigante also had influence in the Feast of San Gennaro in Little Italy, running illegal gambling operations, extorting payoffs from vendors, and pocketing thousands of dollars donated to a neighborhood church—until a crackdown in 1995 by New York City officials. During Gigante&#x27;s tenure as boss of the Genovese family, after the imprisonment of John Gotti in 1992, Gigante came to be known as the figurehead &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot;, the &quot;Boss of All Bosses&quot;, despite the position being abolished since 1931 with the murder of Salvatore Maranzano.

Gigante was reclusive, and almost impossible to capture on wiretaps, speaking softly, eschewing the phone, and even at times whistling into the receiver. He almost never left his home unoccupied because he knew FBI agents would sneak in and plant a bug. Genovese members were not allowed to mention Gigante&#x27;s name in conversations or phone calls; when they had to mention him, members would point to their chins or make the letter &quot;C&quot; with their fingers.

On May 30, 1990, Gigante was indicted along with other members of four of the Five Families for conspiring to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on multimillion-dollar contracts with the New York City Housing Authority to install windows. Gigante attended his arraignment in pajamas and bathrobe, and due to his defense stating that he was mentally and physically impaired, legal battles ensued for seven years over his competence to stand trial. In June 1993, Gigante was indicted again, charged with sanctioning the murders of six mobsters and conspiring to kill three others, including Gotti.

At sanity hearings in March 1996, Sammy &quot;The Bull&quot; Gravano, former underboss of the Gambino family, who became a cooperating witness in 1991, and Alphonse &quot;Little Al&quot; D&#x27;Arco, former acting boss of the Lucchese family, testified that Gigante was lucid at top-level Mafia meetings and that he had told other gangsters that his eccentric behavior was a pretense. Gigante&#x27;s lawyers presented testimony and reports from psychiatrists stating that, from 1969 to 1995, Gigante had been confined twenty-eight times in hospitals for treatment of hallucinations and that he suffered from &quot;dementia rooted in organic brain damage&quot;.

In August 1996, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ruled that Gigante was mentally competent to stand trial; he pleaded not guilty and had been free for years on $1 million bail. Gigante had a cardiac operation in December 1996. On June 25, 1997, Gigante&#x27;s trial started, which he attended in a wheelchair.

On July 25, after almost three days of deliberations, the jury convicted Gigante of conspiring in plots to kill other mobsters and of running rackets as head of the Genovese family but acquitted him of seven counts of murder. Prosecutors stated that the verdict finally established that Gigante was not mentally ill as his lawyers and relatives had long maintained. On December 18, 1997, Gigante was sentenced to twelve years in prison and fined $1.25 million by Judge Jack B. Weinstein, a lenient sentence due to Gigante&#x27;s &quot;age and frailty&quot;, who declared that Gigante had been &quot;finally brought to bay in his declining years after decades of vicious criminal tyranny&quot;.

While in prison, Gigante maintained his role as boss of the Genovese family while other mobsters were entrusted to run its day-to-day activities. Longtime capo Matthew &quot;Matty the Horse&quot; Ianniello became acting boss of the family. Gigante relayed orders to the family through his son, Andrew, who visited him in prison.

On January 23, 2002, Gigante was indicted with several other mobsters, including Andrew, on obstruction of justice charges due to his causing a seven-year delay in his previous trial by feigning insanity. Several days later, Andrew was released on $2.5 million bail. On April 7, 2003, the day the trial began, Prosecutor Roslynn R. Mauskopf had planned to play tapes showing Gigante &quot;fully coherent, careful, and intelligent&quot;, running criminal operations from prison, but when Gigante pled guilty to obstruction of justice, Judge I. Leo Glasser sentenced him to an additional three years in prison. Mauskopf stated, &quot;The jig is up ... Vincent Gigante was a cunning faker, and those of us in law enforcement always knew that this was an act ... The act ran for decades, but today it&#x27;s over.&quot; On July 25, 2003, Andrew Gigante was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $2.5 million for racketeering and extortion.

On July 27, 2005, Matthew Ianniello was indicted in on charges of racketeering related to extortion and loansharking. On June 10, 2006, Ianniello was indicted once again for racketeering charges related to Genovese control of waste management businesses in Southwestern Connecticut.

Gigante died on December 19, 2005, at the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri. His funeral and burial were held four days later, on December 23, at Saint Anthony of Padua Church in Greenwich Village, largely in anonymity.

===After Gigante&#x27;s death===
After Gigante&#x27;s death, the leadership of the Genovese family went to &quot;capo&quot; Daniel &quot;Danny the Lion&quot; Leo, who was apparently running the day-to-day activities of the family by 2006. That same year, Cirillo was reportedly promoted to &quot;consigliere&quot; behind bars and Mangano was released from prison. By 2008, the family administration was believed to be whole again.

In March of that year, Leo was sentenced to five years in prison for loansharking and extortion. Former acting &quot;consigliere&quot; Lawrence &quot;Little Larry&quot; Dentico was leading the New Jersey faction of the family until convicted of racketeering in 2006; he was released from prison in 2009. In December 2008, Liborio Bellomo was paroled after serving twelve years; what role he plays in the Genovese hierarchy is open to speculation, but he likely has had a major say in the running of the family since his tight parole restrictions expired.

A March 2009 article in the &quot;New York Post&quot; claimed Leo was still acting boss despite his incarceration. It also estimated that the Genovese family consists of about 270 &quot;made&quot; members.

The family maintains power and influence in New York, New Jersey, Atlantic City and Florida. It is recognized as the most powerful Mafia family in the U.S., a distinction brought about by their continued devotion to secrecy. According to the FBI, many Genovese family associates do not know the names of family leaders or even other associates, making it difficult for investigators to gather intelligence about the family&#x27;s current status.

On August 4, 2016, United States Attorney of New York charged 46 Mafia leaders with racketeering conspiracy, arson, illegal trafficking in firearms and conspiracy to commit assault throughout the East Coast of the United States from Springfield, Massachusetts to Southern Florida. The 46 defendants were leaders, members, and associates of the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, Bonanno, and Philadelphia crime families. The charges stem from evidence obtained during FBI Special Agent time undercover and infiltrating Genovese family capo Pasquale Parrello&#x27;s Bronx crew who were operating from Parrello&#x27;s restaurant Rigoletto. Cooperating witness who worked for Parrello began working with Joseph Merlino, the boss of the Philadelphia crime family and Eugene O&#x27;Nofrio, a Genovese family acting capo with crews operating from Mulberry Street in New York and Springfield, Massachusetts. Other Genovese members charged were Capo Conard Ianniello, who was using O&#x27;Nofrio as his acting capo to run his crews, soldier Ralph Balsamo and associates Anthony Vazzano, Anthony Zinzi, Vincent Terracciano, Ronald Mastrovincenzo, Israel Torres and others.

In 2016, Eugene &quot;Rooster&quot; Onofrio, who is believed to be a &quot;capo&quot; largely active in Little Italy and Connecticut, was accused of operating a large multimillion-dollar enterprise that ran bookmaking offices, scammed medical businesses, and smuggled cigarettes and guns. He was also alleged to have run a loanshark operation from Florida to Massachusetts. Other members of his reputed crew pleaded guilty to extortion and other crimes. Gerald Daniele, an associate, was sentenced to two years in prison in March 2018. On April 10, 2018, Ralph Santaniello, suspected of being a Genovese &quot;acting capo&quot;, was sentenced to five years in prison for extorting $20,000 from Craig Morel, the owner of one of the biggest towing and scrap-metal companies in Massachusetts, including threatening his life and assaulting him. Morel managed to negotiate the extortion price from $100,000 to $20,000. Associate Giovanni &quot;Johnny&quot; Calabrese was sentenced to 3 years in prison.

In October 2017, thirteen Genovese and Gambino associates and soldiers were sentenced after being indicted following an NYPD operation in December 2016. Dubbed &quot;Shark Bait&quot;, the investigation focused on a large-scale illegal gambling and loansharking ring. Prosecutors claimed 76-year-old Genovese soldier Salvatore DeMeo was in charge of the operation and had generated several million dollars from the enterprise. Soldier Alex Conigliaro was sentenced to four months in jail and four months house arrest in late October 2017, with a fine of $5,000, after admitting that he supervised and financed a $14,000-per-week illegal bookmaking and sports betting operation between 2011 and 2014. Genovese associates Gennaro Geritano and Mario Leonardi were allegedly partners in selling untaxed cigarettes in New York, alleged to have sold over 30,000 packs.

===Current position and leadership===

According to the FBI, the Genovese family had not had an official boss since Gigante&#x27;s death and the leadership was in a state of limbo for some time. Law enforcement considers Leo to be the acting boss, Mangano the underboss, and Cirillo the &quot;consigliere&quot;. The family is known for placing top &quot;capos&quot; in leadership positions to help the administration run day-to-day activities. At present, &quot;capos&quot; Bellomo, Muscarella, Cirillo, and Dentico hold the greatest influence within the family and play major roles in its administration. The Manhattan and Bronx factions, the traditional powers in the family, still exercise that control today. By 2016 however the FBI considers Liborio Bellomo to most likely be the official boss of the Genovese family.

On January 10, 2018, five members and associates, including Gigante&#x27;s son Vincent Esposito, were arrested and charged with racketeering, conspiracy, and several counts of related offenses by the NYPD and FBI. The charges include extortion, labor racketeering conspiracy, fraud and bribery. Genovese associate and Brooklyn-based United Food and Commercial Workers officer Frank Cognetta was also charged. Union official and associate Vincent D&#x27;Acunto Jr. was also involved and allegedly acted on behalf of Esposito to pass along threat messages and to also collect extortion money from the union, in particular from Vincent Fyfe, the president of a wine liquor and distillery union in Brooklyn. Fyfe was forced to pay $10,000 per year to keep his $300,000-a-year union job, which he obtained through the influence of the Genovese family. The labor union infiltration was alleged to have taken place for at least sixteen years. Esposito allegedly extorted several other union officials and an insurance agent. At his home during a warranted search, authorities recovered an unregistered handgun, $3.8 million in cash, brass knuckledusters, and a handwritten list of American Mafia members.

Esposito was granted bail for almost $10 million in April 2018, and pled not guilty. In April 2019, Esposito pled guilty to conspiring to commit racketeering offenses with members and associates of the Genovese family. He was sentenced in July 2019 to two years in prison.

On August 13, 2020, an indictment charged soldier Christopher Chierchio along with Colombo family associate Frangesco &quot;Frankie&quot; Russo (the grandson of Colombo family boss Andrew Russo), attorney Jason &quot;Jay&quot; Kurland and securities broker Frank Smookler with conspiracy, wire fraud and money laundering. The indictment accused the &quot;lottery attorney&quot; Kurland along with Russo, Chierchio and Smookler with swindling $80 million from jackpot winners in an illegal scheme of siphoning money from the jackpot winners&#x27; investments.

On April 26, 2022, an indictment was served charging capos Nicholas Calisi and Ralph Balsamo, soldiers Michael Messina and John Campanella, and associates Michael Poli and Thomas Poli, with racketeering conspiracy involving illegal gambling and extortion. Balsamo was previously arrested on April 12, and Calisi was detained in Boca Raton, Florida, and presented before a U.S. magistrate judge in the Southern District of Florida. According to the indictment, the defendants operated a criminal racketeering enterprise since at least 2011. On February 9, 2023, it was announced that all six defendants in the case had pleaded guilty to the racketeering charges.

On May 3, 2022, exactly a week after the Calisi and Balsamo indictments, another indictment was served that charged capo Anthony &quot;Rom&quot; Romanello, soldier Joseph Celso, and small-time actor and family associate Luan Bexheti with extortion and obstruction of justice. Romanello, who authorities state controls the family&#x27;s Queens crew, oversaw the extortion and intimidation of a Brooklyn restaurant owner, which was carried out by Celso and Bexheti. All three pleaded not guilty and were released on bond.

On August 16, 2022, acting capo Carmelo &quot;Carmine&quot; Polito along with family soldier Joseph Macario, Genovese family associates Salvatore Rubino and Joseph Rutigliano, Bonnano family capo Anthony Pipitone, Bonanno soldier Vito Pipitone, Bonanno associate Agostino Gabriele and Nassau County Police Detective Hector Rosario were indicted and charged with racketeering, money laundering, illegal gambling, conspiracy and obstruction of justice. The Genovese family and the Bonanno family jointly operated several illegal gambling operations while using front businesses in Queens and Long Island to launder illegal profits. The indictment revealed that beginning in May 2012, the Genovese and Bonanno families jointly operated a lucrative illegal gambling operation in Lynbrook, New York called the Gran Caffe.

<text>Melba Newell Phillips (February 1, 1907 – November 8, 2004) was an American physicist and a pioneer science educator. One of the first doctoral students of J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley, Phillips completed her PhD in 1933, a time when few women could pursue careers in science. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips published their description of the Oppenheimer–Phillips process, an early contribution to nuclear physics that explained the behavior of accelerated nuclei of radioactive hydrogen atoms. Phillips was also known for her refusal to cooperate with a U.S. Senate judiciary subcommittee&#x27;s investigation on internal security during the McCarthy era which led to her dismissal from her professorship at Brooklyn College, where she was a professor of science from 1938 until 1952. (The college publicly and personally apologized to Phillips for the dismissal in 1987.)

Phillips also taught at the University of Minnesota (1941–44) and served as associate director of a teacher-training institute at Washington University in St. Louis (1957–62) before joining the faculty at the University of Chicago (1962–72) as a professor of physics. During her retirement years, Phillips was a visiting professor at Stony Brook University (1972–75) and taught at the University of Science and Technology of China, Chinese Academy of Science (1980) in Beijing. Phillips was a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In addition to teaching, Phillips co-authored science textbooks and was active in the American Association of Physics Teachers. In 1981, the AAPT established the Melba Newell Phillips Medal in her honor to recognize outstanding service to the organization.

==Early life and education==
Melba Phillips was born on February 1, 1907, near Hazleton, Gibson County, Indiana. She was the only daughter and eldest of Eilda Elizabeth (Meehan) and Virgil B. Phillips&#x27; four children.

Phillips graduated from Union High School in 1922 at the age of fifteen. Intending to become an educator, Phillips studied mathematics at Oakland City College in Indiana, where she earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1926. Afterwards, Phillips taught at her former high school for two years before entering graduate school.

Phillips earned a master&#x27;s degree in physics from Battle Creek College in Michigan in 1928 and a doctorate in physics (PhD) at the University of California, Berkeley in 1933. She was one of the first doctoral students of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who later became scientific head of the Manhattan Project, the Allied effort to develop the Atomic bomb. In 1935, Oppenheimer and Phillips published their description of the Oppenheimer–Phillips process, which explained the behavior of accelerated nuclei of radioactive, &quot;heavy hydrogen&quot; atoms. The Oppenheimer–Phillips effect was one of the earliest contributions to nuclear physics.

==Career==
In an era when few women were working as scientists, Phillips became a leading science educator and spent the majority of her career as a professor of physics.

Phillips began teaching during the Great Depression. Initially, she took part-time and temporary positions at Battle Creek College (1928–30) and at Connecticut College for Women (1937–38). Phillips also held postdoctoral fellowships at the University of California and at Bryn Mawr College. In early 1936 the American Association of University Women announced that Philips was the recipient of its Margaret E. Maltby award, one of six women to receive its research fellowships for the 1936–37 academic year. Phillips&#x27;s research focused on application of quantum mechanics to the study of nuclear physics. Before accepting a full-time faculty position at Brooklyn College in 1938, Phillips worked as a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

Except for three years during World War II, when she taught at the University of Minnesota (1941–44), Phillips spent a decade as a professor of physics at Brooklyn College (1938–52). She also conducted research on a part-time basis at the Columbia University Radiation Laboratory. In 1945, while teaching at Brooklyn College, Phillips helped organize the Federation of American Scientists at a meeting held in Washington, D.C.

In 1952 Phillips was summoned to appear before the McCarran Commission, a judiciary subcommittee investigating internal security during the McCarthy era. Although Phillips appeared before a subcommittee hearing in New York and agreed to answer questions relating to her work as a scientist and physics educator, she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights when asked about other topics, including questions about whether she was a member of the Communist party. As a result of her refusal to cooperate with the commission as a matter of principle, Phillips, a highly regarded physics educator, was dismissed from her professorship at Brooklyn College and her part-time position at the Columbia University Radiation Laboratory. She remained unemployed as a college professor for five years.

While unemployed, Phillips lived on her modest savings and co-authored two science textbooks: &quot;Principles of Physical Science&quot; (1957), with Francis Bonner, and &quot;Classical Electricity and Magnetism&quot; (1955), with Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky. Both of these publications became standard textbooks in collegiate-level science courses.

Phillips returned to teaching in 1957, when she became associate director of a teacher-training institute at Washington University. Phillips remained at St. Louis until 1962, when she joined the faculty at the University of Chicago as a professor of physics. Under her guidance the university began teaching physical science courses to non-science majors. She also made laboratory work part of its curriculum. Phillips retired as a &quot;professor emerita&quot; from the University of Chicago in 1972, but continued to teach elsewhere.

Philips was active in the American Association of Physics Teachers throughout her career. She became a member of the AAPT in 1943 and served as its first woman president (1966–67). She also co-edited the organization&#x27;s official history. In addition, Phillips served on the Commission in College Physics (1960–68) and on the advisory board of the School of Mathematics Study Group (1964–67). For her service to the field of science education, Phillips was elected a fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

== McCarran Commission ==

During the early Cold War, the Red Scare in the United States led to widespread accusations of disloyalty. As part of this activity, Senator McCarran headed the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee which called Phillips to testify. Phillips worked not only with Robert Oppenheimer on nuclear physics and the Oppenheimer–Phillips process, but also worked with the Teachers&#x27; Union. When questioned about whether she was involved with the Communist party, Phillips chose to neither confirm or deny, but to simply state that her lineage goes back just as far as any other American.

== Later years ==

After she retired from the University of Chicago in 1972, Phillips continued teaching as a visiting professor at Stony Brook University (1972–75) and at the graduate school of the University of Science and Technology of China, Chinese Academy of Science, in Beijing in 1980.

In 1987 Brooklyn College publicly and personally apologized to Phillips for her dismissal from the College in 1952.

==Death and legacy==
Phillips died of coronary artery disease on November 8, 2004, at the age of ninety-seven, at Amber Manor nursing home in Petersburg, Indiana.

As a leading physics educator of her era, Phillips received numerous citations and awards for her contributions to science education. Phillips is especially noted for developing and implementing a curriculum for teaching physics and co-authoring two textbooks in the 1950s for collegiate physics courses. She also wrote and edited works history of physics and the history of the American Association of Physics Teachers.

==Honors and tributes==

<doc id="1185592" wikidata="Q4115925" url="?curid=1185592" title="Sultan of Egypt">
<text>Sultan of Egypt was the status held by the rulers of Egypt after the establishment of the Ayyubid dynasty of Saladin in 1174 until the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517. Though the extent of the Egyptian Sultanate ebbed and flowed, it generally included Sham and Hejaz, with the consequence that the Ayyubid and later Mamluk sultans were also regarded as the Sultans of Syria. From 1914, the title was once again used by the heads of the Muhammad Ali dynasty of Egypt and Sudan, later being replaced by the title of King of Egypt and Sudan in 1922.

==Ayyubid dynasty==

Prior to the rise of Saladin, Egypt was the center of the Shia Fatimid Caliphate, the only period in Islamic history when a caliphate was ruled by members of the Shia branch of Islam. The Fatimids had long sought to completely supplant the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate based in Iraq, and like their Abbasid rivals, they also took the title Caliph, representing their claim to the highest status within the Islamic hierarchy. However, with Saladin&#x27;s rise to power in 1169, Egypt returned to the Sunni fold and the Abbasid Caliphate. Recognizing the Abbasid Caliph as his theoretical superior, Saladin took the title of Sultan in 1174, though from this point until the Ottoman conquest, supreme power in the caliphate would come to rest with the Sultan of Egypt.

==Mamluk dynasties==
In 1250, the Ayyubids were overthrown by the Mamluks, who established the Bahri dynasty and whose rulers also took the title sultan. Notable Bahri sultans include Qutuz, who defeated the invading Mongol army of Hulagu at the Battle of Ain Jalut, and Baibars, who finally recaptured the last remnants of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Bahri were later overthrown by a rival Mameluke group, who established the Burji dynasty in 1382.

==Ottoman Sultanate and autonomous Khedivate==
The Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517 ended the Egyptian Sultanate, with Egypt henceforth a province of the Ottoman Empire. It also marked the end of the Mamluk Abbasid dynasty, as the Ottomans captured the current Caliph Al-Mutawakkil III, and forced him to relinquish the title to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. The Ottomans subsequently paid little interest to Egyptian affairs, and the Mamelukes rapidly regained most of their power within Egypt. However, they remained vassals of the Ottoman Sultan and their leaders were limited to the title of Bey.

In 1523, the Ottoman-appointed Turkish governor of Egypt, Hain Ahmed Pasha, declared himself the Sultan of Egypt and Egypt independent from the Ottoman Empire. He struck his own coins to legitimize his rule, but soon thereafter, Ottoman forces under Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha captured him and executed him, with Ibrahim Pasha assuming the governorship until he found a more permanent replacement, Hadım Süleyman Pasha. 
Following the defeat of Napoleon I&#x27;s forces in 1801, Muhammad Ali Pasha seized power, overthrowing the Mamelukes, and declaring himself ruler of Egypt. In 1805, the Ottoman Sultan Selim III reluctantly recognized him as Wāli under Ottoman suzerainty. Muhammad Ali, however, styled himself as Khedive, and though technically a vassal of the Ottoman Empire, governed Egypt as if it were an independent state. Seeking to rival and ultimately supplant the Ottoman Sultan, Muhammad Ali implemented a rapid modernization and militarization program, and expanded Egypt&#x27;s borders south into Sudan and north into Syria. Eventually, he waged war on the Ottoman Empire with the intention of overthrowing the ruling Osman Dynasty and replacing it with his own. Though the intervention of the Great Powers prevented Muhammad Ali from realizing his grandiose ambitions of becoming sultan himself, obliging Egypt to remain technically part of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt&#x27;s autonomy survived his death with the Porte recognizing the Muhammad Ali Dynasty as hereditary rulers of the country.

Muhammad Ali&#x27;s grandson, Ismail I, acceded to the Egyptian throne in 1863 and immediately set about achieving his grandfather&#x27;s aims, though in a less confrontation manner. A combination of growing Egyptian power, deteriorating Ottoman strength, and outright bribery led to Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz formally recognizing the Egyptian ruler as Khedive in 1867. As Ismail expanded Egypt&#x27;s borders in Africa, and the Ottoman Empire continued to decay, Ismail believed he was close to realizing formal Egyptian independence, and even contemplated using the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 to declare himself Sultan of Egypt. He was persuaded otherwise by pressure from the Great Powers, who feared the consequences of further disintegration of Ottoman power. Ultimately, Ismail&#x27;s reign ended in failure, due to the massive debt his ambitious projects had incurred. European and Ottoman pressure forced his removal in 1879 and replacement by his far more pliant son Tewfik. The subsequent Orabi Revolt resulted in Great Britain invading Egypt in 1882 on the invitation of Khedive Tewfik, and beginning its decades long occupation of the country.

==Restoration of Egyptian Sultanate==
From 1882 onwards, Egypt&#x27;s status became deeply convoluted: officially a province of the Ottoman Empire, semi-officially a virtually independent state with its own monarchy, armed forces, and territorial possessions in Sudan, and for practical purposes a British puppet. The legal fiction of Ottoman sovereignty in Egypt was finally ended in 1914 when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in First World War. Alarmed that the anti-British Khedive Abbas II would side with the Ottomans, the British deposed him in favor of his uncle Hussein Kamel and declared Egypt a British protectorate. Symbolizing the official end of Ottoman rule, Hussein Kamel took the title Sultan as did his brother Fuad I who succeeded him in 1917, though in reality Egypt remained under British domination. Both Hussein Kamel and Fuad maintained Egypt&#x27;s claim to Sudan, with Egyptian nationalists declaring both in turn to be the &quot;Sultan of Egypt &quot;and&quot; Sudan&quot;.

Rising nationalist anger at the continued British occupation forced Britain to formally recognize Egyptian independence, in 1922. However, the title of Sultan was dropped and replaced with King. 
Nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul, who was later exiled by the British, maintained that this was because the British refused to recognize a sovereign Egyptian ruler who outranked their own king (in the hierarchy of titles, sultan, like shah in Iran, is comparable to emperor, being a sovereign who recognizes no secular superior). Another reason offered for the change in title, is that it reflected the growing secularization of Egypt at the time, as sultan has Islamic overtones, whereas the Arabic word for king, &quot;malik&quot;, does not.

Upon overthrowing Fuad&#x27;s son, King Farouk I, in the Egyptian revolution of 1952, the Free Officers briefly considered declaring his infant son Sultan to reinforce Egypt&#x27;s sovereignty over Sudan and demonstrate their rejection of British occupation. However, since the revolutionaries had already decided to abolish the Egyptian monarchy after a brief period of consolidating their hold on power, they determined that it would be an idle gesture and Farouk&#x27;s son was duly declared King Fuad II. The following year, on 18 June 1953, the revolutionary government officially abolished the monarchy and Egypt became a republic.

<doc id="1185619" wikidata="Q4836843" url="?curid=1185619" title="BWI Rail Station">
<text>BWI Rail Station (signed as BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport) is an intermodal passenger station in Linthicum, Maryland near Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI). It is served by Amtrak Northeast Corridor intercity trains, MARC Penn Line regional rail trains, and several local bus lines.

The station is located just over a mile from the airport&#x27;s terminal. It was the first intercity rail station in the United States built to service an airport. A free shuttle bus runs between the station and the airport terminal at all hours.

Although Penn Station is the Baltimore area&#x27;s main intercity station, BWI Airport is a major station in its own right. It is Amtrak&#x27;s sixth-busiest station in the Mid-Atlantic region (behind New York Penn, Washington, Philadelphia, Baltimore Penn, and Albany-Rensselaer), the third-busiest in the Baltimore-Washington corridor, and the 12th busiest nationwide.

== History ==

First proposed in 1964 by Charles Adler, a Baltimore-based inventor of traffic and aircraft safety devices, the station was dedicated on October 23, 1980coincidentally, mere hours after Adler&#x27;s deathand opened for Amtrak intercity and Conrail (now MARC) commuter trains three days later.

The station&#x27;s building houses a ticketing desk, waiting room, and a concessions area. The adjacent parking garage is used by commuters who ride the train to work in Baltimore or Washington, and also contains the bus stop for shuttles to the BWI terminal. The garage was built in the late 1990s to replace a smaller surface lot. It contains 3,200 parking spaces and typically does not fill to capacity. The &quot;Carolinian&quot; served the station between 1991 and 2004.

=== Platform renovations ===
The high-level platforms were rebuilt and lengthened between 2006 and 2010. The existing structures were replaced with new precast concrete segments, and new signs, lights, shelters, railing, canopies, and benches were installed.

=== Expansion ===

In 2010, $9.4 million was allocated for design and engineering of a new station building and fourth track, which was then expected to cost $80–100 million. MDOT requested $300 million in federal funds for the project in 2011, but the request was denied. The Federal Railroad Administration issued a Finding Of No Significant Impact—a major step in the environmental review process—in February 2016, clearing the way for final design and construction to begin after funding was obtained. The project was then expected to cost $600 million and include of fourth track.

On August 27, 2018, the MTA began a $4.7 million project to rebuild and enlarge the station. A temporary station building was used during construction. The new station opened in October 2019, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony held in December. The renovation did not modify the Amtrak-owned footbridge, which has water leakage and cleanliness issues, nor add WiFi service in the MTA-owned waiting area. In response, the MTA said that it does not offer WiFi at any of its stations, but is working with Amtrak to ensure that the footbridge gets needed repairs.
== Station layout and services ==
=== Northeast Corridor ===
BWI Rail Station is located on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, a rail line connecting Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, &quot;Acela Express&quot;, &quot;Vermonter&quot;, and &quot;Palmetto&quot;, as well as the MARC Penn Line commuter rail service, stop at the station. Amtrak long distance trains, as well as some &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and &quot;Acela Express&quot; trains, bypass the station.

The station appears in Amtrak timetables as BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport. Unlike most major stations along the Northeast Corridor, it is not possible to check bags to and from BWI; it is the busiest Amtrak station without checked baggage service.

=== Public transit services ===

* Airport shuttle bus: The station is indirectly connected to MTA&#x27;s Baltimore Light Rail, for which there is a stop (BWI Marshall Airport) station at the airport terminal.
* MTA LocalLink 75: Connects the station to Arundel Mills (to the south) and the Patapsco Baltimore Light Rail station (to the north), with stops at the airport terminal and the BWI Business District station.
* MTA commuter bus route 201: Offers service between Gaithersburg and BWI Airport.
* UMBC Transit
* BayRunner Shuttle, a private shuttle connecting east to the Eastern Shore area of Maryland and connecting shuttle to Cumberland.
* County Connector, a semi-public funded, free-to-use shuttle, connecting to Arundel Mills, and with Anne Arundel County&#x27;s 202 and Fort Meade routes, provides a inter-agency link for the NSA Friendship Annex to the National Security Agency.

=== Pedestrian and bicycle access ===
* BWI Trail: A walk/bike trail completely encircles the airport grounds parallel to the Airport Loop, and runs adjacent to the station.
* An elevated walkway connects the station (at the second floor of the southbound platform&#x27;s stairwell) with office buildings on Corporate Center Drive, including the Maryland Department of Transportation headquarters.

<text>Gaius Julius Callistus (flourished 1st century) was a Greek imperial freedman during the reigns of Roman Emperors Caligula and Claudius. Callistus was originally a freedman of Caligula, and was given great authority during his reign, which he used to amass even greater wealth. He often advised Caligula on imperial policy and how to deal with emergent issues such as the abundant conspiracies against the emperor. He used his influence to help his friends, including Domitius Afer, whose treason case was dropped at Callistus&#x27; behest. However, Callistus was not immune from Caligula&#x27;s wrath, and when a thwarted assassin named Callistus as a fellow conspirator in the failed plot, Caligula was ready to believe him. It was only pleading that saved Callistus&#x27; life.

This distrust by Caligula may have caused Callistus to turn on him. He is named by the ancient sources as a prime mover in Caligula&#x27;s murder (24 January 41) rallying the other freedmen to the cause. When Claudius succeeded Caligula, he pardoned most of the conspirators.

In order to impress the new emperor Claudius, Callistus stated that Caligula had ordered him to murder Claudius several times, but he had always refused. Whether or not this was true, Claudius allowed Callistus to stay in the imperial service. Claudius divided the daily maintenance of the empire among various freedmen and Callistus became Secretary of Justice and Law. His job was to oversee the running of the courts and the conduct of trials. He used the position to amass personal wealth, and carried on much the way he had under Caligula, advising the emperor on policy and the like. Callistus persuaded Claudius to hire his friend Scribonius Largus as a personal physician. After the disgrace and death of Roman Empress Valeria Messalina, Callistus is said to have promoted Caligula&#x27;s former wife Lollia Paulina as a replacement. He would have been acquainted with her from his days in Caligula&#x27;s court.

Most of the details of Callistus&#x27; personal life and ultimate fate are unknown, although he was dead by the end of Claudius&#x27; reign. Claudius died by poison on 13 October 54. Callistus supposedly pushed his daughter Nymphidia to become one of Caligula&#x27;s mistresses. Callistus&#x27; grandchild Nymphidius Sabinus later claimed to be the product of this union, and tried unsuccessfully to gain the principate in the Year of the Four Emperors.

<text>Old Kea () is a hamlet in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated on the west bank of the Truro River approximately two miles (3 km) south of Truro.

This and the nearby village of Kea are said to have been named after the Saint Kea who arrived at Old Kea from Ireland in the 5th century.

The manor of &quot;Landighe&quot; (Landege) is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) when it was held by Godwin from Robert, Count of Mortain. There was one hide of land and land for 5 ploughs. There were one and half ploughs, 3 serfs, 2 villeins, 4 smallholders, 2 acres of meadow, 3 acres of woodland, one square league of pasture, 2 cattle, 40 sheep and 15 goats. The value of the manor was 10 shillings though it had formerly been worth £1-10s.

Only the tower remains of the original parish church which stood at Old Kea. A small mission chapel was built onto the church in 1863 and services are still held twice a month.

Old Kea lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

<text>Salvatore LoCascio (born July 21, 1958) is a reputed former caporegime in the New York Gambino crime family. His father, Frank LoCascio, was the acting underboss (1988-1990), and acting consigliere (1990-1992) for John Gotti.

==Early life==
LoCascio grew up in Eastchester, New York. In 1985, with $115,000 that he received from wedding gifts he started his own business, Creative Program Communications, Incorporated with a few friends.

==The Scores case==
In 1998, LoCascio and Michael &quot;Mikey Scars&quot; DiLeonardo were arrested for attempting to extort money from Scores, a famous upscale strip club in Manhattan. However, the case against LoCascio was weak, so prosecutors offered to drop the charges. In return, LoCascio pleaded guilty to tax evasion for deriving income from illegal gambling. He was sentenced to ten months, part of which was home arrest, and a $1.5 million fine. At the time of his plea, Locascio ran numerous 900 number phone services, from psychic hot lines to sports scores.

==Pornography and credit card fraud==
While serving his time in home, LoCascio was already building what would be called the largest consumer fraud in American history. Along with Gambino mob soldier Richard &quot;Richie&quot; Martino, LoCascio created a number of pornographic websites. These websites were formed through a partnership between Martino and Norman Chanes, a direct marketer. The scam required an age verification check before an adult could access a &quot;free preview&quot; of the sexual content. To perform an age verification check, the customer had to enter their credit card information. The websites clearly stated that the viewer was getting a &quot;free preview&quot; and their credit card would not be charged. In reality, Locascio and crew were fraudulently charging $25 to $75 on these accounts. 

Local phone carrier services had been allowing third party telecommunication companies to bill existing customers for services rendered. Typically this would include items such as voice mail and overseas long distance charges. The LoCascio crew then set about billing customers located primarily in the United States mid west for charges they had not requested. This billing was facilitated through the now defunct USP&amp;C of Overland Park, Kansas. The scheme is known as &#x27;cramming&#x27;.

Soon complaints from victims of both the internet sites and phone bills caught the attention of the US Justice Department. By February 2004, the entire LoCascio crew had been arrested. Federal prosecutors estimate that the Gambinos grossed approximately $500 million from the phone cramming operation. LoCascio was sentenced to two years in federal prison; he was released on August 1, 2008.

<doc id="1185646" wikidata="Q296439" url="?curid=1185646" title="Mentuhotep II">
<text>Mentuhotep II (, meaning &quot;Mentu is satisfied&quot;), also known under his prenomen Nebhepetre (, meaning &quot;The Lord of the rudder is Ra&quot;), was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth ruler of the Eleventh Dynasty. He is credited with reuniting Egypt, thus ending the turbulent First Intermediate Period and becoming the first pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom. He reigned for 51 years, according to the Turin King List. Mentuhotep II succeeded his father Intef III on the throne and was in turn succeeded by his son Mentuhotep III.

Mentuhotep II ascended Egypt&#x27;s throne in the Upper Egyptian city of Thebes during the First Intermediate Period. Egypt was not unified during this time, and the Tenth Dynasty, rival to Mentuhotep&#x27;s Eleventh, ruled Lower Egypt from Herakleopolis. After the Herakleopolitan kings desecrated the sacred ancient royal necropolis of Abydos in Upper Egypt in the fourteenth year of Mentuhotep&#x27;s reign, Pharaoh Mentuhotep II dispatched his armies north to conquer Lower Egypt. Continuing his father Intef III&#x27;s conquests, Mentuhotep succeeded in unifying his country, probably shortly before his 39th year on the throne. Following and in recognition of the unification, in regnal year 39, he changed his titulary to Sematawy (, meaning &quot;He who unifies the two lands&quot;).

Following the unification, Mentuhotep II reformed Egypt&#x27;s government. To reverse the decentralization of power, which contributed to the collapse of the Old Kingdom and marked the First Intermediate Period, he centralized the state in Thebes to strip nomarchs of some of their power over the regions. Mentuhotep II also created new governmental posts whose occupants were Theban men loyal to him, giving the pharaoh more control over his country. Officials from the capital travelled the country regularly to control regional leaders.

Mentuhotep II was buried at the Theban necropolis of Deir el-Bahari. His mortuary temple was one of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s most ambitious building-projects, and included several architectural and religious innovations. For example, it included terraces and covered walkways around the central structure, and it was the first mortuary temple that identified the pharaoh with the god Osiris. His temple inspired several later temples, such as those of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Some depictions of Mentuhotep II seem to indicate that he suffered from elephantiasis, resulting in swollen legs.

== Family ==
Mentuhotep II was the son of Intef III and Intef III&#x27;s wife Iah who may also have been his sister. This lineage is demonstrated by the stele of Henenu (Cairo 36346), an official who served under Intef II, Intef III and his son, which the stele identifies as Horus &quot;s-ankh-[ib-t3wy]&quot;, Mentuhotep II&#x27;s first Horus name. As for Iah, she bore the title of &quot;mwt-nswt&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s mother&quot;. The parentage of Mentuhotep II is also indirectly confirmed by a relief at Shatt er-Rigal. Some scholars have suggested that Mentuhotep II was of Nubian origin. Specifically, Wildung and Lobban have argued that Egyptian iconography represented Mentuhotep II with pronounced, Nubian facial features. Crawford noted that the rulers of the 11th dynasty were based in the Theban or southern region of Upper Egypt and had close relations with Nubia. Mentuhotep II had many wives who were buried with him in or close to his mortuary temple:

* Tem (&quot;tm&quot;) who might have been Mentuhotep II&#x27;s chief wife as she bore the titles of &quot;ḥmt-nswt&quot; &quot;King&#x27;s wife&quot;, &quot;ḥmt-nswt mryt.f&quot; &quot;King&#x27;s wife, his beloved&quot; and &quot;wrt-ḥts-nbwj&quot; &quot;Great one of the hetes-sceptre of the two Lords&quot;. She gave Mentuhotep II two children, one of whom was certainly Mentuhotep III since Tem was also called &quot;mwt-nswt&quot;, &quot;&quot;King&#x27;s mother&quot; and &quot;mwt-nswt-bjtj&quot;, &quot;Dual king&#x27;s mother&quot;. Apparently she died after her husband and was buried by her son in Mentuhotep&#x27;s temple. Her tomb was discovered in 1859 by Lord Dufferin and fully excavated in 1968 by D. Arnold.
* Neferu II (&quot;The beautiful&quot;) was called &quot;King&#x27;s wife&quot; and &quot;ḥmt-nswt-mryt.f&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s wife, his beloved&quot;. She might have been Mentuhotep II&#x27;s sister since she also bore the titles of &quot;sȝt-nswt-šmswt-nt-ẖt.f&quot;, &quot;Eldest king daughter of his body&quot;, &quot;jrjt-pˁt&quot;, &quot;hereditary princess&quot; and &quot;ḥmwt-nbwt&quot;, &quot;mistress of all women&quot;. She was buried in the tomb TT319 of Deir el-Bahri.
* Kawit (&quot;kȝwj.t&quot;) was one of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s secondary wives. She bore the titles of &quot;ḥmt-nswt mryt.f&quot; &quot;King&#x27;s wife, his beloved&quot; and &quot;ẖkrt-nswt&quot;, &quot;King&#x27;s embellishment&quot;. She was a &quot;Priestess of the goddess Hathor&quot;. It has been suggested that she was Nubian. She was buried under the terrace of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s mortuary temple where E. Naville uncovered her sarcophagus in 1907.
*Sadeh, Ashayet, Henhenet and Kemsit were all Mentuhotep II&#x27;s secondary wives. They bore the title of &quot;ḥmt-nswt mryt.f&quot; &quot;King&#x27;s wife, his beloved&quot; and &quot;ẖkrt-nswt-wˁtit&quot; &quot;Unique embellishment of the King&quot;. They were priestesses of Hathor and each of them was buried in a single pit dug under the terrace of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s temple. Note that an alternative theory holds that Henhenet was one of Intef III&#x27;s secondary wives, possibly the mother of Neferu II. Henhenet might have died in childbirth. On the interior decoration of Ashayet&#x27;s coffin she included her household with images that included racial markers in the coloring of her black skin and yellow skin for her three female scribes. Kemsit is also shown in a painting in her tomb with black skin. The artists apparently was commissioned to show the Nubian origin of these queens. 
*Mwyt, a five-year-old girl buried with Mentuhotep II&#x27;s secondary wives. She is most likely one of his daughters.

== Reign ==

Mentuhotep II is considered to be the first ruler of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt. The Turin Canon credits him with a reign of 51 years. Many Egyptologists have long considered two rock reliefs, showing Mentuhotep II towering over smaller figures labeled king &quot;Intef&quot;, to be conclusive evidence that his predecessor Intef III was his own father; this is, however, not entirely certain, as these reliefs may have had other propagandistic purposes, and there are other difficulties surrounding Mentuhotep&#x27;s true origin, his three name-changes, and his frequent attempts to claim descent from various gods.

=== Early reign ===

When he ascended the Theban throne, Mentuhotep II inherited the vast land conquered by his predecessors from the first cataract in the south to Abydos and Tjebu in the north.
Mentuhotep II&#x27;s first fourteen years of reign seem to have been peaceful in the Theban region as there are no surviving traces of conflict firmly datable to that period. In fact, the general scarcity of testimonies from the early part of Mentuhotep&#x27;s reign might indicate that he was young when he ascended the throne, a hypothesis consistent with his 51 years long reign.

=== Reunification of Egypt ===
In the 14th year of his reign, an uprising occurred in the north. This uprising is most probably connected with the ongoing conflict between Mentuhotep II based in Thebes and the rival 10th Dynasty based at Herakleopolis who threatened to invade Upper Egypt. The 14th year of Mentuhotep&#x27;s reign is indeed named &quot;Year of the crime of Thinis&quot;. This certainly refers to the conquest of the Thinite region by the Herakleopolitan kings who apparently desecrated the sacred ancient royal necropolis of Abydos in the process. Mentuhotep II subsequently dispatched his armies to the north. The famous tomb of the warriors at Deir el-Bahari (MMA 507) discovered in the 1920s, contained the linen-wrapped, unmummified bodies of 60 soldiers all killed in battle, their shroud bearing Mentuhotep II&#x27;s cartouche. Due to its proximity to the Theban royal tombs, the tomb of the warriors is believed to be that of heroes who died during the conflict between Mentuhotep II and his foes to the north. Merikare, the ruler of Lower-Egypt at the time may have died during the conflict, which further weakened his kingdom and gave Mentuhotep the opportunity to reunite Egypt. The exact date when reunification was achieved is not known, but it is assumed to have happened shortly before year 39 of his reign. Indeed, evidence shows that the process took time, maybe due to the general insecurity of the country at the time: commoners were buried with weapons, the funerary stelae of officials show them holding weapons instead of the usual regalia and when Mentuhotep II&#x27;s successor sent an expedition to Punt some 20 years after the reunification, they still had to clear the Wadi Hammamat of rebels. 
Following the reunification, Mentuhotep II was considered by his subjects to be divine, or half divine. 
This was still the case during the late 12th Dynasty some 200 years later: Senusret III and Amenemhat III erected stelae commemorating opening of the mouth ceremonies practiced on Mentuhotep II&#x27;s statues.

=== Military activities outside Egypt ===
Mentuhotep II launched military campaigns under the command of his vizier Khety south into Nubia, which had gained its independence during the First Intermediate Period, in his 29th and 31st years of reign. This is the first attested appearance of the term &quot;Kush&quot; for Nubia in Egyptian records. In particular, Mentuhotep posted a garrison on the island fortress of Elephantine so troops could rapidly be deployed southwards. There is also evidence of military actions against Canaan. An inscription was found at Gabal El Uweinat close to the borders of modern Libya, Sudan and Chad, naming the king and attesting at least trade contacts to this region.

=== Officials ===
The king reorganized the country and placed a vizier at the head of the administration. The viziers of his reign were Bebi and Dagi. His &quot;treasurer&quot; was Kheti who was involved in organising the sed festival for the king. Other important officials were the treasurer Meketre and the &quot;overseer of sealers&quot; Meru. His &quot;general&quot; was Intef.

=== Reorganization of the government ===
Throughout the First Intermediate Period and until Mentuhotep II&#x27;s reign, the nomarchs held important powers over Egypt. Their office had become hereditary during the 6th Dynasty and the collapse of central power assured them complete freedom over their lands. After the unification of Egypt however, Mentuhotep II initiated a strong policy of centralization, reinforcing his royal authority by creating the posts of &quot;Governor of Upper Egypt&quot; and &quot;Governor of Lower Egypt&quot; who had power over the local nomarchs. 

Mentuhotep also relied on a mobile force of royal court officials who further controlled the deeds of the nomarchs. Finally, the nomarchs who supported the 10th Dynasty, such as the governor of Asyut, certainly lost their power to the profit of the king. In the meantime, Mentuhotep II started an extensive program of self-deification emphasizing the divine nature of the ruler.

===Titulary===
Mentuhotep II&#x27;s self-deification program is evident from temples he built where he is represented wearing the headgear of Min and Amun. But perhaps the best evidence for this policy is his three titularies: his second Horus and Nebty names were &quot;The divine one of the white crown&quot; while he is also referred to as the &quot;son of Hathor&quot; at the end of his reign.

Mentuhotep II changed his titulary twice during his reign: the first time in his 14th regnal year, marking the initial successes of his campaign against Herakleopolis Magna to the north. The second time on or shortly before his 39th year of reign, marking the final success of that campaign, and his reunification of all of Egypt. More precisely, this second change may have taken place on the occasion of the &quot;sed&quot; festival celebrated during his 39th year on the throne.

In general, the titularies of Mentuhotep II show a desire to return to the traditions of the Old Kingdom. In particular he adopted the complete five-fold titulary after his reunification of Egypt, seemingly for the first time since the 6th Dynasty, though known records are sparse for much of the First Intermediate Period that preceded him. Another proof that Mentuhotep II paid great attention to the traditions of the Old Kingdom is his second Nomen, sometimes found as

This reference to Hathor rather than Re is similar to the titulary of Pepi I. Finally, in later king lists, Mentuhotep was referred to with a variant of his third titulary

== Monuments ==
Mentuhotep II commanded the construction of many temples though few survive to this day. In doing so, Mentuhotep followed a tradition started by his grandfather Intef II: royal building activities in the provincial temples of Upper Egypt began under Intef II and lasted throughout the Middle Kingdom. Most of the temple remains are also located in Upper Egypt, more precisely in Abydos, Aswan, Tod, Armant, Gebelein, Elkab, Karnak and Denderah.

===Abydos===
At Abydos, a well preserved funerary chapel called the Mahat chapel was found in 2014.

== Mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II ==

Mentuhotep II&#x27;s most ambitious and innovative building project remains his large mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. The many architectural innovations of the temple mark a break with the Old Kingdom tradition of pyramid complexes and foreshadow the Temples of Millions of Years of the New Kingdom. 
As such, Mentuhotep II&#x27;s temple was certainly a major source of inspiration for the nearby, but 550-year later temples of Hatshepsut and Thutmose III.

However, the most profound innovations of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s temple are not architectural but religious. First, it is the earliest mortuary temple where the king is not just the recipient of offerings but rather enacts ceremonies for the deities (in this case Amun-Ra).
Second, the temple identifies the king with Osiris. Indeed, the decoration and royal statuary of the temple emphasizes the Osirian aspects of the dead ruler, an ideology apparent in the funerary statuary of many later pharaohs.

Finally, most of the temple decoration is the work of local Theban artists. This is evidenced by the dominant artistic style of the temple which represents people with large lips and eyes and thin bodies. At the opposite, the refined chapels of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s wives are certainly due to Memphite craftsmen who were heavily influenced by the standards and conventions of the Old Kingdom. This phenomenon of fragmentation of the artistic styles is observed throughout the First Intermediate Period and is a direct consequence of the political fragmentation of the country.

===Situation===
The temple is located in the cliff at Deir el-Bahri on the west bank of Thebes. The choice of this location is certainly related to the Theban origin of the 11th Dynasty: Mentuhotep&#x27;s predecessors on the Theban throne are all buried in close by saff tombs. Furthermore, Mentuhotep may have chosen Deir el-Bahri because it is aligned with the temple of Karnak, on the other side of Nile. In particular, the statue of Amun was brought annually to Deir el-Bahri during the Beautiful Festival of the Valley, something which the king may have perceived as beneficial to this funerary cult. Consequently, and until the construction of the Djeser-Djeseru some five centuries later, Mentuhotep II&#x27;s temple was the final destination of the barque of Amun during the festival.

===Discovery and excavations===
In the early 19th century, the ruins of the temple of Mentuhotep II were completely covered with debris. They consequently went unnoticed until the second half of the century, in spite of extensive excavations performed on the nearby Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut.
Thus it was only in 1859, that Lord Dufferin and his assistants, Dr. Lorange and Cyril Clerke Graham, started to excavate the southwest corner of the hypostyle hall of Mentuhotep&#x27;s temple. Clearing the immense mass of debris, they soon discovered the plundered grave of Queen Tem, one of Mentuhotep&#x27;s wives. Realising the potential of the site, they then gradually worked their way to the sanctuary, where they found the granite altar of Mentuhotep with a representation of Amun-Re and various other finds such as the grave of Neferu TT319. Finally, in 1898, Howard Carter discovered the Bab el-Hosan cache in the front court, where he uncovered the famous black seated statue of the king.
The next important excavation works took place from 1903 to 1907 under the direction of Henri Édouard Naville, who worked there on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund. He was the first to undertake a systematic exploration of the temple.
About ten years later, between 1920 and 1931, Herbert E. Winlock further excavated the temple for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. However, his results were published only in the form of preliminary reports in summary form. 
Finally, from 1967 to 1971, Dieter Arnold conducted research on the site on behalf of the German Archaeological Institute. He published his results in three volumes.
===Foundational offerings===
Under the four corners of the temple terrace, H. Winlock discovered four pits during his 1921–1922 excavations. These pits were dug into the ground before the construction of the temple for the purpose of foundation rituals. Indeed, when H. Winlock discovered them, they still contained many offerings: a cattle skull, pitchers and bowls filled with fruits, barley and bread and a mud brick bearing Mentuhotep II&#x27;s name.

Further excavations of the pits undertaken in 1970 by Dieter Arnold revealed more food offerings such as bread and beef ribs, but also some bronze objects, a faience scepter and sheets of fabric. The sheets were marked in red ink at the corner, seven with the name of Mentuhotep II and three with that of Intef II.

=== Architecture ===

==== Causeway and courtyard ====
Similarly to the mortuary complexes of the Old Kingdom, Mentuhotep II&#x27;s mortuary complex comprised two temples: the high temple of Deir el-Bahri and a valley temple located closer to the Nile on cultivated lands. The valley temple was linked to the high temple by a 1.2 km long and 46 m wide uncovered causeway. The causeway led to a large courtyard in front of the Deir el-Bahri temple.

The courtyard was adorned by a long rectangular flower bed, with fifty-five sycamore trees planted in small pits and six tamarisk plus two sycamore trees planted in deep pits filled with soil. This is one of the very few archaeologically documented temple-gardens of ancient Egypt that are known enough about to reconstruct its appearance. The maintenance of such a garden more than 1 km from the Nile into the arid desert must have required the constant work of many gardeners and an elaborate irrigation system.
Left and right of the processional walkway were at least 22 seated statues of Mentuhotep II wearing, on the south side, the White Crown of Upper Egypt and on the north side the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. These were probably added to the temple for the celebration of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s &quot;Sed&quot; festival during his 39th year on the throne. Some headless sandstone statues are still on site today. Another was discovered in 1921 during Herbert Winlock&#x27;s excavations and is now on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

====Front part of the temple====
West of the causeway is the main temple, which consisted of two parts. The front part of the temple is dedicated to Montu-Ra, a merger of the sun god Ra with the Theban god of war Montu, particularly worshipped during the 11th Dynasty. 
A ramp aligned with the central axis of the temple led to the upper terrace. The ramp that is visible today was constructed in 1905 by Édouard Naville over the remains of the original ramp, which only is visible in two places as the lowest two layers of the lateral limestone cladding.
The eastern front part of the temple, on both sides of the rising ramp, consists of two porticos with a double row of rectangular pillars, which make the temple look like a saff tomb, the traditional burial of Mentuhotep II&#x27;s 11th-Dynasty predecessors.
On the temple terrace, a 60-metre-wide, 43-metre-deep and 5-metre-high podium supports the upper hall surrounding an ambulatory and the core building. The ambulatory, separated from the upper hall by a 5-cubit-thick wall, comprised a total of 140 octagonal columns disposed in three rows. For most of these columns, only the base is still visible today.

The courtyard of the ambulatory was completely filled by the core building, a massive 22 m large and 11 m high construction. This edifice, located at the center of the temple complex, was excavated in 1904 and 1905 by Edouard Naville. He reconstructed it as a square structure topped by a small pyramid, a representation of the primeval mount which possibly resembled the superstructures of the royal tombs at Abydos. This reconstruction, supported by H. E. Winlock, was contested by D. Arnold, who argued that, for structural reasons, the temple could not have supported the weight of a small pyramid. Instead, he proposed that the edifice was flat-roofed.
====Rear part of the temple====
Behind the core edifice was the center of the cult for the deified king. The rear part of the temple was cut directly into the cliff and consisted of an open courtyard, a pillared hall with 82 octagonal columns and a chapel for a statue of the king. This part of the temple was dedicated to Amun-Ra.

The open courtyard is flanked on the north and south sides by a row of five columns and on the east side by a double row totalling sixteen columns. At the center of the open courtyard lies a deep dromos leading to the royal tomb. 
Archaeological finds in this part of the temple include a limestone altar, a granite stele and six granite statues of Senusret III. To the west, the courtyard leads to the hypostyle hall with its ten rows of eight columns each, plus two additional columns on both sides of the entrance. The hypostyle hall is separated from the courtyard by a wall and, being also higher, is accessed via a small ramp.

On the west end of the hypostyle hall lies the holiest place of the temple, a sanctuary dedicated to Mentuhotep and Amun-Ra leading to a small speos which housed a larger-than-life statue of the king. The sanctuary itself housed a statue of Amun-Re and was surrounded on three sides by walls and on one side by the cliff. The inner and outer faces of these walls were all decorated with painted inscriptions and representations of the kings and gods in high relief. Surviving relief fragments show the deified king surrounded by the chief deities of Upper and Lower Egypt, Nekhbet, Seth, Horus and Wadjet, and on a par with them. The gods present the king with bundles of palm branches, the symbol of Millions of Years. This relief is a manifestation of the profound religious changes in the ideology of kingship since the Old Kingdom:

===Royal tomb===

As mentioned above, the open courtyard of the rear part of the temple presents a dromos in its center. This dromos, a 150 m long straight corridor, leads down to a large underground chamber 45 m below the court which is undoubtedly the tomb of the king. This chamber is entirely lined with red granite and has a pointed roof. It contained an alabaster chapel in the form of an Upper-Egyptian Per-wer sanctuary.
This chapel was once closed by a double door now missing. It contained a wooden coffin and ointment vessels which left traces in the ground. Most of the grave goods that must have been deposited there are long gone as a result of the tomb plundering. The few remaining items were a scepter, several arrows, and a collection of models including ships, granaries and bakeries.

<text>FBi (call sign: 2FBI) station is an independent, not-for-profit community radio in Sydney, Australia. FBi places a heavy emphasis on local emerging music: it has a policy that at least 50 per cent of its music content is to be Australian, of which at least half comes from Sydney musicians.

==History==
FBi began &#x27;test broadcasting&#x27; as an &#x27;aspirant broadcaster&#x27; in 1995 following the then-Keating government&#x27;s decision to allocate the last three FM licences in Sydney. The election of John Howard delayed the process as the Coalition government focussed on radio licences for country towns. After making a series of short-term broadcasts over eight years, FBi Radio beat 16 other aspirant broadcasters to be granted a permanent licence by the Australian Broadcasting Authority in 2002.

Popular dance and hip hop aspirant station DEX FM were unsuccessful and FBi President Cassandra Wilkinson invited DEX founder George Crones to join the FBi board and merge the two stations.

A failed takeover attempt by one of the losing bidders for the permanent licence, Wild FM (a more commercially oriented dance music station) pushed FBi&#x27;s full-time 24/7 broadcast to August 2003. At the launch, company President Cassandra Wilkinson told radioinfo that FBi 94.5FM aims to &quot;celebrate the creativity and diversity of the city’s music and arts communities.&quot;

The station went to air with program director Meagan Loader and station manager Christina Alvarez in charge with Australia&#x27;s youngest Music Director Dan Zilber calling the tunes.

In November 2006, FBi&#x27;s &#x27;Sunset&#x27; program won the Best Radio Show award at the national Australian Dance Music Awards.

In September 2007, the Australian Labor Party chose FBi as the platform to announce its electoral commitment to resume funding for the Australian Music Radio Airplay Project.

In 2009, FBi asked listeners to ask Richard Branson to donate $1 million to the station, with the person getting his attention being promised $50k if he came through with the goods... A young Australian woman swam to his house on Necker Island to inform him of the campaign and Branson called the station to chat on air to broadcaster Alison Piotrowski. While Branson did not pay up the $1 million he did donate prizes to the Save FBi campaign which raised nearly half a million dollars to save the station from the global financial crisis which had significantly impacted revenues and membership.

During mid-2014, FBi Radio officially launched FBi Click - a second station dedicated to dance and electronic music. FBi Click broadcast on DAB+ in Sydney and via online stream at fbiradio.com/click. A number of Sydney dance music promoters and collectives presented shows on the station; including Picnic, Motorik, Purple Sneakers, THUMP by Vice and others. On 5 June 2017 FBi Click was discontinued, although many of the programs were merged back into the main FBI station&#x27;s programming. The rationale for the change was that listeners wanted to hear the main FBi station on DAB+.

==Reach and format==
FBi is Sydney&#x27;s only independent youth radio station, broadcasting across the city with a signal strength as large as its commercial rivals - reaching Gosford, the Blue Mountains and Wollongong. A ratings survey conducted by McNair in 2019 showed that FBi&#x27;s audience was per month. Its music policy is 50% Australian, half of that from Sydney. The eclectic music mix that results is different from anything available through commercial music stations in Sydney.

==FBi SMAC Awards==

The FBi Sydney Music, Arts &amp; Culture (SMAC) Awards recognising Sydney musicians, artists, performers, restaurants and events. They are voted on by the public and presented in an annual ceremony. The 2022 event took place at the Powerhouse in Ultimo on 10 November 2022.

<text>Bottom trawling is trawling (towing a trawl, which is a fishing net) along the seafloor. It is also referred to as &quot;dragging&quot;. The scientific community divides bottom trawling into benthic trawling and demersal trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Bottom trawling can be contrasted with midwater trawling (also known as pelagic trawling), where a net is towed higher in the water column. Midwater trawling catches pelagic fish such as anchovies and mackerel, whereas bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish (groundfish) and semi-pelagic species such as cod, squid, shrimp, and rockfish.

Trawling is done by a trawler, which can be a small open boat with only or a large factory trawler with . Bottom trawling can be carried out by one trawler or by two trawlers fishing cooperatively (pair trawling).

Global catch from bottom trawling has been estimated at over 30 million tonnes per year, an amount larger than any other fishing method. Concerns about the environmental impacts of bottom trawling have led to changes in gear design, such as the addition of turtle excluder devices to reduce bycatch, and limitations on locations where bottom trawling is allowed, such as marine protected areas. A 2021 paper estimated that bottom trawling contributed between 600 and 1500 million tons of carbon dioxide a year by disturbing carbon dioxide in the sea floor – emissions approximately equivalent to those of Germany, or the aviation industry. However, these values are highly uncertain and have been criticized as overestimates. International attempts to limit bottom trawling have been ineffective.

==History==
An early reference to fishery conservation measures comes from a complaint about a form of trawling dating from the 14th century, during the reign of Edward III. A petition was presented to Parliament in 1376 calling for the prohibition of a &quot;subtlety contrived instrument called the &quot;wondyrchoum&quot;&quot;. This was an early beam trawl with a wooden beam, and consisted of a net 6 m (18 ft) long and 3 m (10 ft) wide,

of so small a mesh, no manner of fish, however small, entering within it can pass out and is compelled to remain therein and be taken...by means of which instrument the fishermen aforesaid take so great abundance of small fish aforesaid, that they know not what to do with them, but feed and fatten the pigs with them, to the great damage of the whole commons of the kingdom, and the destruction of the fisheries in like places, for which they pray remedy.

Another source describes the wondyrchoum as:

three fathom long and ten men&#x27;s feet wide, and that it had a beam ten feet long, at the end of which were two frames formed like a colerake, that a leaded rope weighted with a great many stones was fixed on the lower part of the net between the two frames, and that another rope was fixed with nails on the upper part of the beam, so that the fish entering the space between the beam and the lower net were caught. The net had maskes of the length and breadth of two men&#x27;s thumbs

The response from the Crown was to &quot;let Commission be made by qualified persons to inquire and certify on the truth of this allegation, and thereon let right be done in the Court of Chancery&quot;. Thus, already back in the Middle Ages, basic arguments about three of the most sensitive current issues surrounding trawling - the effect of trawling on the wider environment, the use of small mesh size, and of industrial fishing for animal feed - were already being raised.

Until the late 18th century sailing vessels were only capable of towing small trawls. However, in the closing years of that century a type of vessel emerged that was capable of towing a large trawl, in deeper waters. The development of this type of craft, the sailing trawler, is credited to the fishermen of Brixham in Devon. The new method proved to be far more efficient than traditional long-lining. At first its use was confined to the western half of the English Channel, but as the Brixham men extended their range to the North Sea and Irish Sea it became the norm there too.

By the end of the 19th century there were more than 3,000 sailing trawlers in commission in UK waters and the practice had spread to neighbouring European countries. Despite the availability of steam, trawling under sail continued to be economically efficient, and sailing trawlers continued to be built until the middle of the 1920s. Some were still operating in UK waters until the outbreak of World War II, and in Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands until the 1950s.

English commissions in the 19th century determined that there should be no limitation on trawling. They believed that bottom trawling, like tilling of land, actually increased production. As evidence, they noted that a second trawler would often follow a first trawler, and that the second trawler would often harvest even more fish than the first. The reason for this peculiarity is that the destruction caused by the first trawl resulted in many dead and dying organisms, which temporarily attracted a large number of additional species to feed on this moribund mass.

Bottom trawling does not only have a long tradition in European waters. It was also recognized in 1704 during the Edo era in Japan as a common fishing method. A slightly different approach was developed where the &quot;Utase Ami&quot; or &quot;trawled bottom net&quot; was deployed from a sideways sailing boat.

Bottom trawling has been widely implicated in the population collapse of a variety of fish species, locally and worldwide, including orange roughy, barndoor skate, shark, and many others.

==Fishing gear==

The design requirements of a bottom trawl are relatively simple, a mechanism for keeping the mouth of the net open in horizontal and vertical dimensions, a &quot;body&quot; of net which guides fish inwards, and a &quot;cod-end&quot; of a suitable mesh size, where the fish are collected. The size and design of net used is determined by the species being targeted, the engine power and design of the fishing vessel and locally enforced regulations.

===Beam trawling===

The simplest method of bottom trawling, the mouth of the net is held open by a solid metal beam, attached to two &quot;shoes&quot;, which are solid metal plates, welded to the ends of the beam, which slide over and disturb the seabed. This method is mainly used on smaller vessels, fishing for flatfish or prawns, relatively close inshore.

===Otter trawling===

Otter trawling derives its name from the large rectangular otter boards which are used to keep the mouth of the trawl net open. Otter boards are made of timber or steel and are positioned in such a way that the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, push them outwards and prevent the mouth of the net from closing. They also act like a plough, digging up to into the seabed, creating a turbid cloud, and scaring fish towards the net mouth.

The net is held open vertically on an otter trawl by floats and/or kites attached to the &quot;headline&quot; (the rope which runs along the upper mouth of the net), and weighted &quot;bobbins&quot; attached to the &quot;foot rope&quot; (the rope which runs along the lower mouth of the net). These bobbins vary in their design depending on the roughness of the sea bed which is being fished, varying from small rubber discs for very smooth, sandy ground, to large metal balls, up to in diameter, for very rough ground. These bobbins can also be designed to lift the net off the seabed when they hit an obstacle. These are known as &quot;rock-hopper&quot; gear.

===Body of the trawl===
The body of the trawl is funnel-like, wide at its &quot;mouth&quot; and narrowing towards the cod end, and usually is fitted with wings of netting on both sides of the mouth. It is long enough to assure adequate flow of water and prevent fish from escaping the net, after having been caught. It is made of diamond-meshed netting, the size of the meshes decreasing from the front of the net towards the codend. Into the body, fish and turtle escape devices can be fitted. These can be simple structures like &quot;square mesh panels&quot;, which are easier for smaller fish to pass through, or more complicated devices, such as bycatch grills.

===Cod end===
The cod end is the trailing end of the net where fish are finally &quot;caught&quot;. The size of mesh in the cod end is a determinant of the size of fish which the net catches. Consequently, regulation of mesh size is a common way of managing mortality of juvenile fishes in trawl nets.

==Environmental damage==
Trawling gear produces acute impacts on biota and the physical substratum of the seafloor by disrupting the sediment column structure, overturning boulders, re-suspending sediments and imprinting deep scars on muddy bottoms. Also, the repetitive passage of trawling gear over the same areas creates long-lasting, cumulative impacts that modify the cohesiveness and texture of sediments. It can be asserted nowadays that due to its recurrence, mobility and wide geographical extent, industrial trawling has become a major force driving seafloor change and affecting not only its physical integrity on short spatial scales but also imprinting measurable modifications to the geomorphology of entire continental margins.

Bottom fishing has operated for over a century on heavily fished grounds such as the North Sea and Grand Banks. While overfishing has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities. A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water coral &quot;Lophelia pertusa&quot;. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling. A global analysis of the impacts of bottom trawling found that the impact on seabed biota was strongly dependent on the type of gear used, with otter trawls estimated as having the smallest impact and removing 6% of biota per pass while hydraulic dredges had the largest impact and removed 41% of biota per pass. Other research found trawled canyon sediments contained 52 percent less organic matter than the undisturbed seafloor. There were 80 percent fewer sea worms in the trawled region and only half as much diversity of species in the trawled seafloor.

===Resuspension and biogeochemistry===
Bottom trawling stirs up the sediment at the bottom of the sea. The suspended solid plumes can drift with the current for tens of kilometres from the source of the trawling, increasing sedimentation rates in deep environments Bottom trawling-induced resuspended sediment mass on the world&#x27;s continental shelves has been estimated at 22 gigatonnes per year, approximately the same as the sediment mass supplied to the continental shelves through the world&#x27;s rivers. These plumes introduce a turbidity which decreases light levels at the bottom and can affect kelp reproduction. Repeated resuspension can also lead to a hardening of the sea bottom as finer sediments are proportionally more effectively carried away by currents than larger sediments, thus leading to habitat change.

Bottom trawling can both resuspend and bury biologically recyclable organic material, changing the flow of nutrients and carbon through the food web and thereby alter geomorphological landscapes. Ocean sediments are the sink for many persistent organic pollutants, usually lipophilic pollutants like DDT, PCB and PAH. Bottom trawling mixes these pollutants into the plankton ecology where they can move back up the food chain and into our food supply.

Phosphorus is often found in high concentration in soft shallow sediments. Resuspending nutrient solids like these can introduce oxygen demand into the water column, and result in oxygen deficient dead zones.
Even in areas where the bottom sediments are ancient, bottom trawling, by reintroducing the sediment into the water column, can create harmful algae blooms. More suspended solids are introduced into the oceans from bottom trawling than any other man-made source.

Multiple large-scale reviews on bottom trawling have noted that there is a great need for further studies that properly examine the effects of nutrient and toxin remobilization as well as carbon cycling, in order to better estimate greenhouse gas emissions and hence the impact on climate change.

===Deep sea damage===
The Secretary General of the United Nations reported in 2006 that 95 percent of damage to seamount ecosystems worldwide is caused by deep sea bottom trawling. A study published in &quot;Current Biology&quot; suggests a cutoff of is a point which ecological damage increases significantly. 

=== Carbon release ===
An estimated 370 million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide stored in seafloor sediment is released by bottom-trawling fishing. Most carbon released into the sea enters the atmosphere within a decade. Banning bottom trawling in marine protected areas has been suggested.

===Current restrictions===
Today, some countries regulate bottom trawling within their jurisdictions:

* The United States Regional Fishery Management Councils limit bottom trawling in specific closed areas to protect specific species or habitat. For instance, on the United States West Coast a large Rockfish Conservation Area was created in 2002 prohibiting trawling in most areas of the coast between 75 and 150 fathoms – – to protect overfished rockfish species. In 2018, these closures were revised to allow trawling in some previously closed areas while closing new areas of sensitive habitat to bottom trawling.
* The Council of the European Union in 2004 applied &quot;a precautionary approach&quot; and closed the sensitive Darwin Mounds off Scotland to bottom trawling.
* In 2005, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization&#x27;s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below 1000 meters (3,281 ft) and, in January 2006, completely closed ecologically sensitive areas off Italy, Cyprus, and Egypt to all bottom trawling.
* Norway first recognized in 1999 that trawling had caused significant damage to its cold-water &quot;lophelia&quot; corals. Norway has since established a program to determine the location of cold-water corals within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) so as to quickly close those areas to bottom trawling.
* Canada has acted to protect vulnerable coral reef ecosystems from bottom trawling off Nova Scotia. The Northeast Channel was protected by a fisheries closure in 2002, and the Gully area was protected by its designation as a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in 2004.
* Australia in 1999 established the Tasmanian Seamounts Marine Reserve to prohibit bottom trawling in the south Tasman Sea. Australia also prohibits bottom trawling in the Great Australian Bight Marine Park off South Australia near Ceduna. In 2004, Australia established the world&#x27;s largest marine protected area in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.
* New Zealand in 2001 closed 19 seamounts within its EEZ to bottom trawling, including in the Chatham Rise, sub-Antarctic waters, and off the east and west coasts of the North Island. New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton announced on 14 February 2006 that a draft agreement had been reached with fishing companies to ban bottom trawling in 30 percent of New Zealand&#x27;s EEZ, an area of about reaching from subantarctic waters to subtropical ones. But only a small fraction of the area proposed for protection will cover areas actually vulnerable to bottom trawling.
* Palau has banned all bottom trawling within its jurisdiction and by any Palauan or Palauan corporation anywhere in the world.
* The President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, announced in early 2006 the formation of the world&#x27;s first deep-sea marine reserve area. This measure – the Phoenix Islands Protected Area – created the world&#x27;s third-largest marine protected area and may protect deep sea corals, fish, and seamounts from bottom trawling. However, the actual boundaries of this reserve and what harvest limitations may occur therein have not been detailed. Moreover, Kiribati currently has only one patrol boat to monitor this proposed region.
*Venezuela was the first country to ban industrial trawling in its territorial waters and EEZ in 2009.
* Hong Kong passed legislation banning trawling on 18 May 2011 in an effort to restore the territory&#x27;s devastated fish stocks and marine ecosystem. The ban came into effect on 31 December 2012. The government paid HK$1.72 billion to affected trawlers in a buyout scheme. Persons who contravene the ban can be fined or imprisoned under the Fisheries Protection Ordinance (Cap 171).
* Sri Lanka banned trawling in 2017, however, Indian fishermen regularly engage in banned trawling in Sri Lankan waters.

===Lack of regulation===
Beyond national jurisdictions, most bottom trawling is unregulated either because there is no Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) with competence to regulate, or else what RFMOs that do exist have not actually regulated. The major exception to this is in the Antarctic region, where the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources regime has instituted extensive bottom trawling restrictions. 

The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) also recently closed four seamounts and part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge from all fishing, including bottom trawling, for three years. This still leaves most of international waters completely without bottom trawl regulation.

As of May 2007 the area managed under the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) has gained a new level of protection. All countries fishing in the region (accounting for about 25 percent of the global ocean) agreed to exclude bottom trawling on high seas areas where vulnerable ecosystems are likely or known to occur until a specific impact assessment is undertaken and precautionary measures have been implemented. Observers will also be required on all high seas bottom trawlers to ensure enforcement of the regulations.

===Failed United Nations ban===
Palau President Tommy Remengesau has called for a ban on destructive and unregulated bottom trawling beyond national jurisdictions. Palau has led the effort at the United Nations and in the Pacific to achieve a consensus by countries to take this action at an international level. Palau has been joined by the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu in supporting an interim bottom trawling ban at the United Nations. The proposal for this ban did not result in any actual legislation and was blocked.

In 2006, New Zealand Fisheries Minister Jim Anderton promised to support a global ban on bottom trawling if there was sufficient support to make that a practical option. Bottom trawling has been banned in a third of New Zealand&#x27;s waters (although a large percentage of these areas were not viable for bottom trawling in the first place)

<text>National Museums Scotland (NMS; ) is an executive non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government. It runs the national museums of Scotland.

NMS is one of the country&#x27;s National Collections, and holds internationally important collections of natural sciences, decorative arts, world cultures, science and technology, and Scottish history and archaeology.

==List of national museums==
* The National Museum of Scotland, comprising two linked museums on Chambers Street, in the Old Town of Edinburgh:
** The Museum of Scotland - concerned with the history and people of Scotland
** The Royal Museum - a general museum encompassing global geology, archaeology, natural history, science, technology and art
* The National Museum of Flight, at East Fortune, East Lothian
* The National Museum of Rural Life, at Wester Kittochside farm, in South Lanarkshire (previously the Museum of Scottish Country Life, previously the Scottish Agricultural Museum)
* The National War Museum, at Edinburgh Castle

==Other collections==
The main storage building at the National Museums Collection Centre, at Granton in Edinburgh, opened in 1996. It is open to the public for guided tours. A new storage building has been constructed, which houses the textile and costume collections, including the Jean Muir Collection of 20th century costume and accessories.

The National Museum of Costume was located at Shambellie House, in New Abbey, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. In January 2013, National Museums Scotland announced that the National Museum of Costume was to close and the site would not reopen for 2013.

==Trustees==
National Museums Scotland is Scotland&#x27;s national museum service, governed by a board of trustees. It is a non-departmental public body, funded by the Education and Lifelong Learning Directorate of the Scottish Government.

<text>Bonifatius (or Bonifacius; also known as Count Boniface; died 432) was a Roman general and governor of the diocese of Africa. He campaigned against the Visigoths in Gaul and the Vandals in North Africa. An ally of Galla Placidia, mother and advisor of Valentinian III, Bonifacius engaged in Roman civil wars on her behalf against the generals Felix in 427-429 and Aetius in 432. Although he defeated the latter at the Battle of Rimini, Bonifacius suffered a fatal wound and was succeeded by his son-in-law Sebastianus as &quot;patricius&quot; of the Western Roman Empire.

== Biography ==

=== Early career ===
Bonifatius first appears as a general of Constantius III in 413, where he defeated the Visigoths of Athaulf at Massilia; he allegedly threw a weapon and wounded the Gothic king himself. Later that decade, Bonifatius was known to be a &quot;tribunus&quot; commanding a Gothic regiment of &quot;foederati&quot; in North Africa campaigning against the Mauri, and had a friendship with St. Augustine of Hippo with whom he discussed theological matters. In 422 he was likely recalled to the Western court in Ravenna, where he probably married his Gothic wife Pelagia, daughter of Beremudus, and inherited her father&#x27;s &quot;bucellarii&quot;. Bonifatius and Castinus then prepared to launch a campaign against the Vandals and Alans in Spain, but Bonifatius&#x27; forces never arrived as the two commanders had quarreled constantly since its inception. Galla Placidia sought to prevent Castinus from gaining the position of Stilicho before him, and as a result Castinus attempted to remove Bonifatius from power. Bonifatius retreated to North Africa where he acquired the command of comes africae under dubious circumstances and continued his campaigns against the Mauri tribes. After the death of Emperor Honorius the &quot;primicerius notariorum&quot; Joannes was elevated to the throne by Castinus in 424, and Bonifatius responded by cutting off the Grain supply from North Africa, showing his support for the Theodosians (Placidia and Theodosius II).
Prosper states that Joannes&#x27; forces were weakened because they were campaigning against Bonifatius in North Africa, but were unable to depose him like in the campaigns against Gildo and other North African usurpers. After a revolt in Gaul and a military campaign under the eastern generals Ardabur and Aspar sent by Theodosius II, Joannes was overthrown, and Valentinian III, half-nephew of Honorius, was made Western emperor by the &quot;magister officiorum&quot; Helion. Bonifatius supported him, and resumed the grain shipments to Rome, being rewarded the position of comes domesticorum in return.

=== Civil War with Felix ===

In 427, Bonifatius was recalled to Ravenna by Placidia, but refused the summons. Bonifatius was accused of attempting to form his own empire in Roman Africa at the allegation of Flavius Constantius Felix, who had also been a staunch supporter of Placidia and had been installed as the &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot; of the west by Theodosius II. Placidia ordered Felix to send an army to restore the vital province in response. Felix&#x27;s generals for the expedition included Mavortius, Gallio, and Sanoeces. Mavortius and Gallio led Roman forces proper, while Sanoeces commanded the Hun Foederati troops. Together the three generals laid siege to Bonifatius at Carthage. The three besiegers, however, turned on each other, and Sanoeces and his Huns killed the Romans before he was killed himself, which lifted the siege. When news reached Ravenna, Felix sent the Comes Sigisvultus against Bonifacius, who campaigned with his Goths in Africa for two years. Sigisvultus captured Carthage, but Bonifatius and his Gothic bucellarii continued to campaign in Numidia, where they were allowed to loot the province. Bonifatius also had his daughter baptized by an Arian priest, which caused a falling out between him and St. Augustine. However, Placidia sent an envoy to Bonifatius in 429, from which she learned that a letter had been forged ordering him not to return to Ravenna if summoned. A man named Darius was sent to negotiate a truce between Bonifatius and Sigisvultus, and as a result Bonifatius was restored to Placidia&#x27;s favor and the civil war ended in time to face the Vandal threat.

=== Campaigns against the Vandals ===

Some sources report that Bonifatius invited the Vandals to Africa, though doubt has been cast on this in recent years. The Vandals crossed near Roman Tingis, and an inscription at Altava dated to 429 mentions the deceased was wounded by a &quot;barbarian&quot; during the Vandal advance across Africa. Their campaign was briefly halted by Darius, who negotiated a brief truce, but Gaiseric quickly resumed. Bonifatius, the African army, and a contingent of supporting Gothic &quot;foederati&quot; confronted and were defeated by Gaiseric near the city of Calama in 430, after which Bonifatius retreated to the city of Hippo Regius. In May or June of 430, Gaiseric laid siege to the city, and St. Augustine died during the siege, which was finally lifted in July or August of 431. Leaving it at the mercy of Gaiseric, Bonifatius retreated out of the city to join his forces with the Eastern Roman general Aspar, who had been sent to reinforce Africa by Theodosius II. In early 432, Bonifatius and Aspar engaged Gaiseric in battle, but were again defeated. Allegedly, the future emperor Marcian was captured in this engagement, but released after Gaiseric had a vision of him becoming Emperor.

=== Civil war with Aetius and death ===

In 432, after Flavius Felix, his wife Padusia, and a deacon had been hanged by the Roman army, allegedly at the instigation of Flavius Aetius whose power she sought to resist, Placidia appointed Bonifatius &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot; and &quot;patricius&quot; of the west, despite his unsuccessful record in Africa. Bonifacius led his forces against Aetius and the Gallic army at the Battle of Rimini in 432. Bonifacius and his son-in-law Sebastianus were victorious, and Aetius was allowed to retire to his private estates, although Bonifatius was mortally wounded by a lance during the conflict. He died sometime between a few days and three months after the battle. Sebastianus, appointed to fill his place, attempted to have Aetius assassinated, only for Aetius to flee to the court of the Huns and return with their support. Allegedly Sebastianus was preparing to fight Aetius by summoning the Visigoths to his aid, but he was evidently unpopular among the troops and allowed them to engage in piracy, and had lost support in the court as well. Sebastianus was exiled, and as a result Aetius became the dominant power in the Western Roman Empire, and married Bonifacius&#x27; widow Pelagia allegedly at his request.

<doc id="1185673" wikidata="Q4636228" url="?curid=1185673" title="3CR Melbourne">
<text>3CR is a community radio station that broadcasts on the AM band and on the digital spectrum as 3CR Digital in Melbourne, Australia. It features mainly talk-based programs with political (particularly trade unions) and environmental themes, as well as some music and community language-based programs. Today the station hosts over 130 programs presented by over 400 volunteers.

The radio station is located in Smith Street, Fitzroy, Victoria. Initially broadcasting on 837 kHz, 3CR now broadcasts on 855 kHz at 2 kW into a directional aerial, from a site at Hoppers Crossing about 15 km west of Melbourne.

==History==
The station&#x27;s broadcasting licence was approved on 10 October 1975, by the Minister for the Media, Dr Moss Cass. Test broadcasting began on 1 May 1976, and full operation began 3 July 1976 from studios in High Street, Armadale. The station was Melbourne&#x27;s first such community radio station to obtain a licence.

3CR began digital broadcasting in 2010. In 2013 the station was part of the &quot;Commit to Community Radio&quot; campaign which successfully convinced the federal government to extend funding for community radio digital broadcasting until 2016. Over 30 shows now publish a podcast on the website.

In 2016, 3CR published a history of the station titled &quot;Radical radio: Celebrating 40 years of 3CR&quot;.

===Controversies===
In 1978 &quot;The Bulletin&quot; accused 3CR of being &quot;the voice of terrorism&quot;, because of 3CR&#x27;s support for the Palestinian position in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. A series of meetings between 3CR, the Jewish Board of Deputies and the Public Broadcasting Association took place. As 3CR was not prepared to give in to the demands of the Jewish Board of Deputies, they initiated a full tribunal hearing about 3CR&#x27;s coverage of the issue. During two weeks of a &#x27;Fight Back&#x27; campaign in November, about 1,000 listener sponsors helped distribute nearly 500,000 leaflets throughout the Melbourne metropolitan area, supporting and outlining 3CR&#x27;s views.

In the mid-1990s, the station was infiltrated by undercover members of the Victoria Police who pretended to be volunteers to gather information.

==Programming==
===Special broadcasts===
Since its founding, 3CR has done regular live broadcasts from major activist events in Melbourne and beyond, including Occupy Melbourne, the S11 World Economic Forum protests, the Honeymoon Mine occupation, and union campaigns.

Regular special broadcasts include:
*&quot;Beyond the Bars&quot; - an annual broadcast since 2001, by Indigenous prisoners from inside various men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prisons
*Survival Day – hosted by indigenous programmers on 26 January
*Sustainable Living Festival - 3CR holds live forums from the festival every year, including environmental science experts David Suzuki and Clive Hamilton
*International Women&#x27;s Day - hosted by women on 8 March
*International Day of People with Disability – 12 hours of programming by and about people living with disabilities on 3 December
*Human Rights Day – 10 December

===Women===
In 1986, 3CR became to first radio station in Australia to appoint a paid Women&#x27;s Officer. The station hosts several programmes promoting women&#x27;s voices in both English and community languages, and feminist current affairs shows. It also promotes training opportunities for girls and women, such as Girls Radio Club.

In July 2013, a program by Clemmie Wetherall from &#x27;Women on the Line&#x27; on family violence was recognised by the Eliminating Violence Against Women Media Awards in the category &#x27;Best Radio News / Current Affairs&#x27;. Her piece used a well–known Hollywood incident to explore family violence and make it relevant to the ordinary person.

===Gay and lesbian (LGBTIQA+)===
Gay Liberation (Melbourne) was a founding member of 3CR in 1975, with the Gay Liberation Radio Collective producing their first program, and Australia&#x27;s first gay radio program, in 1976. The Gay Liberation program was following by the Lesbian and Gay Show, HIV Plus (formerly Positively Primed), In Ya Face, Dykes on Mics, Out of the Pan, and Queering The Air; with lesbian, gay, trans*, and queer issues also covered in current affairs and social justice programming.

==Governance==

3CR is run by a combination of paid staff, an oversight committee, and over 300 volunteers.

<doc id="1185697" wikidata="Q596083" url="?curid=1185697" title="Lake Karapiro">
<text>Lake Karapiro () is an artificial reservoir lake on the Waikato River at Karapiro, south-east of Cambridge in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. The lake was formed in 1947 by the damming of the Waikato River to store water for the 96-megawatt Karapiro power station. The lake is also one of two premier rowing venues in New Zealand (alongside Lake Ruataniwha in Canterbury) and is the base for the country&#x27;s high-performance rowing programme.

== History and etymology ==
In about 1600, Te Ihingarangi built a pā (fortified village) called Te Tiki o Ihingarangi near where Lake Karapiro is today.

In 1830, Ngāti Hauā defeated Ngāti Maru in a battle at Taumatawīwī, two kilometres south of Karapiro Domain. On the orders of the Ngāti Hauā chief Te Waharoa, his dead warriors were cremated, this taking place on rocks beside the Waikato River, the location then becoming known as &quot;Karāpiro&quot;, from the Māori language words , meaning &quot;basaltic stone&quot;, and , meaning &quot;foul smelling&quot;. The site was flooded when the lake created. The ten-megawatt Horahora Power Station, 13 km upstream of Karapiro Dam was also flooded with the formation of Lake Karapiro.

Construction of the Karapiro Dam began in 1940, however progress was slow due to labour and material shortages related to World War II. The dam was completed in early 1947, four years behind schedule. Due to the post-war electricity shortages, the filling of Lake Karapiro had to be coordinated to minimise the time between Horahora&#x27;s decommissioning and Karapiro&#x27;s commissioning. The lake level reached Horahora on 4 April 1947 upon which Horahora stopped generating and was submerged. The lake was sufficiently filled on 10 April 1947 to allow the first turbine-generator at Karapiro to enter service.

== Rowing venue ==
The lake, regarded as one of New Zealand&#x27;s best rowing venues, hosted the World Rowing Championships in 1978 and 2010, as well as the rowing events for the 1950 British Empire Games. The national rowing championships, then called the Dominion championships, were first held on the lake in 1949. Since the 1980s, Lake Karapiro alternates with the South Island&#x27;s Lake Ruataniwha in hosting the New Zealand national rowing championships and the New Zealand secondary school rowing championships (Maadi Cup). Rowers who train on the lake mostly live in nearby Cambridge.

An International Rowing Federation inspection panel visited Lake Karapiro in March 2006 and said in its report that it was one of the fairest courses in the world they had seen and that the lake was one of the most picturesque in the world.

The lake hosted the 2010 Rowing World Championships. The purpose-built Sir Don Rowlands Centre was completed in June 2010, prior to the event.

==Hydroelectric power==
The 96-megawatt Karapiro Power Station is located adjacent to the dam at the head of the lake, and is the eighth and last hydroelectric power station located on the Waikato River. Water taken from the lake is passed through three Kaplan turbines in the powerhouse, before being deposited into the lower Waikato River. Each turbine turns a 32 MW generator, and the electricity from the generators is fed into Transpower&#x27;s national grid. The station is a base load generator due to its need to maintain water flows into the Waikato River system beyond the lake.

==Invasive species==
Lake Karapiro is infested with hornwort, a submerged macrophyte from North America that is ranked as the worst submerged macrophyte in New Zealand. This plant is an unwanted organism under the Biosecurity Act 1993. 

More recently, the lake was the first site where gold clams were detected in New Zealand, in May 2023. The gold clam grows and breeds very quickly, and can alter an ecosystem by reducing the majority of the phytoplankton, excreting a lot of nitrogen and phosphorus, and physically dominating the available space on the river or lakebed. Despite this, the lake is still open for recreation, making it a threat to other waterways because people may unknowingly spread golden clams on their watercrafts. It has been added to the unwanted organism register.

<doc id="1185709" wikidata="Q7433709" url="?curid=1185709" title="Science of value">
<text>The science of value, or value science, is a creation of philosopher Robert S. Hartman, which attempts to formally elucidate value theory using both formal and symbolic logic.

==Fundamentals==
The fundamental principle, which functions as an axiom, and can be stated in symbolic logic, is that &quot;a thing is good insofar as it exemplifies its concept&quot;. To put it another way, &quot;a thing is good if it has all its descriptive properties.&quot; This means, according to Hartman, that the good thing has a name, that the name has a meaning defined by a set of properties, and that the thing possesses all of the properties in the set. A thing is bad if it does not fulfill its description.

He introduces three basic dimensions of value, &quot;systemic&quot;, &quot;extrinsic&quot; and &quot;intrinsic&quot; for sets of properties—&quot;perfection&quot; is to &quot;systemic value&quot; what &quot;goodness&quot; is to &quot;extrinsic value&quot; and what &quot;uniqueness&quot; is to &quot;intrinsic value&quot;—each with their own cardinality: finite, formula_1 and formula_2. In practice, the terms &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; apply to finite sets of properties, since this is the only case where there is a ratio between the total number of desired properties and the number of such properties possessed by some object being valued. (In the case where the number of properties is countably infinite, the &quot;extrinsic&quot; dimension of value, the &quot;exposition&quot; as well as the mere definition of a specific concept is taken into consideration.)

Hartman quantifies this notion by the principle that &quot;each property of the thing is worth as much as each other property, depending on the level of abstraction&quot;. Hence, if a thing has &quot;n&quot; properties, each of them—if on the same level of abstraction—is proportionally worth &quot;n&quot;−1.

==Infinite sets of properties==
Hartman goes on to consider infinite sets of properties. Hartman claims that &quot;according to a theorem of transfinite mathematics, any collection of material objects is at most denumerably infinite&quot;. This is not, in fact, a theorem of mathematics. But, according to Hartman, people are capable of a denumerably infinite set of predicates, intended in as many ways, which he gives as formula_2. As this yields a notional cardinality of the continuum, Hartman advises that when setting out to describe a person, a continuum of properties would be most fitting and appropriate to bear in mind. This is the cardinality of &quot;intrinsic value&quot; in Hartman&#x27;s system.

Although they play no role in ordinary mathematics, Hartman deploys the notion of aleph number reciprocals, as a sort of infinitesimal proportion. This, he contends goes to zero in the limit as the uncountable cardinals become larger. In Hartman&#x27;s calculus, for example, the assurance in a Dear John letter, that &quot;we will always be friends&quot; has axiological value formula_4, whereas taking a metaphor literally would be slightly preferable, the reification having a value of formula_5.

<text>Theresa Owana Kaʻōhelelani Laʻanui (May 1, 1860 – January 5, 1944) was a descendant of Kalokuokamaile, the eldest brother of Kamehameha I. She was a member of the House of Laʻanui, a collateral branch of the House of Kamehameha.

== Birth and early life ==
Theresa was born on May 1, 1860, in Honolulu. She was born of high aliʻi descent, through her father, Gideon Kailipalaki Laanui, a brother of Elizabeth Kekaaniau who attended the Chiefs Children&#x27;s School and was deemed eligible to the throne by King Kamehameha III. Her mother was Elizabeth Kamaikaopa, said to be a great-granddaughter of Keohokalole, the mother of Liliuokalani. She was a member of the House of Laanui, a collateral branch of the House of Kamehameha. Her children (except her daughters by Cartwright) and male-line descendants belong paternally to the Wilcox family.

As a child, Theresa grew up during the royal court of Kamehameha V and would often go to the palace to make leis for the king. She was married four times, although she only had children from her first and second marriages. She was one-eighth French by her great-grandfather Jean Baptiste Rives, who had twin daughters both being hanai at birth by Kaahumanu. One daughter was given the name Theresa Owana Kaheiheimalie, Theresa&#x27;s grandmother whom she was named after. The rest she was of pure Hawaiian descent. After her parents died in 1871, she was adopted by her aunt Elizabeth Kekaaniau Pratt.

== Marriage and children ==
She married Alexander Joy Cartwright III, son of Honolulu businessman and baseball pioneer Alexander Cartwright II on April 23, 1878. She was married under the name Theresa Owana Rives. By this marriage she had two or three daughters, an unnamed daughter born in 1879, Eva Kuwailanimamao Cartwright (1881–1948) and Daisy Emmalani Napulahaokalani Cartwright (1885–1957)
They divorced on April 5, 1883, and he eventually moved to San Francisco and married Susan Florence McDonald.


Her second marriage was on August 20, 1896 to Robert William Kalanihiapo Wilcox (1855–1903), a military leader who King Kalakaua sent to Italy at the Royal Military Academy in Turin and lead an unsuccessful attempt to restore Queen Lili`uokalani back to the throne. He then became a popular politician and was elected as the first U.S. Territory of Hawai`i Delegate to Congress. By this marriage she had a son, Robert Kalanikupuapaikalaninui Keōua Wilcox (1893–1934) and two daughters, Virginia Kahoa Kaahumanu Kaihikapumahana Wilcox (1895–1954) and Elizabeth Kaakaualaninui Wilcox who was born January 2, 1898, and died young November 24, 1898.

==First Lady, politics and business ==

Theresa and Robert Wilcox owned and operated two Hawaiian newspapers, the Liberal and the Home Rula Repubalika, which were written in both the Hawaiian language and English. Their Newspaper was an opposition to the oligarchy&#x27;s newspaper the Hawaiian Gazette which was run by Alatau Atkinson, William Richards Castle, William Owen Smith, Sandford Dole and Lorrin Thurston, and they were the conspirators who overthrew Queen Lili`uokalani. The Gazette later merged with the Advertiser, combining the voice of their occupied government as their newspaper was a mechanism to promote their regime through journalism. Their oligarchy newspaper promoted an &quot;all white&quot; territorial government of Hawai`i while the Wilcox&#x27;s newspaper promoted the voting rights for Hawaiians to be restored. The Wilcox&#x27;s husband and wife team became a thorn in the side of the oligarchs, as Theresa and her aunt had a claim for the ceded crown lands which was held in control under the new regime and because of Roberts counter revolution against them to restore the queen, then with the publishing of the Home Rula Repubalika, the Wilcox&#x27;s were definitely considered a threat. Victory came in the year 1900 when Theresa&#x27;s husband Robert Wilcox was supported by many Hawaiians and they voted for him to be the first U.S. Territory of Hawai`i Delegate to Congress. This was considered a major win for Hawaiians since all other attempts to restore the monarchy had failed.

Because of her relation to the royal family, she was famously known by many as Princess Theresa. She was received at the White House during Wilcox&#x27;s term from 1900 to 1903 and attended the Inauguration of U.S. President McKinley as well as the Inauguration Ball where she met McKinley and his wife. She had left the ball with U.S. vice president, Theodore Roosevelt to get something to eat because the snacks of sherbet and punch was to slim for her Hawaiian appetite. After the death of her husband Robert Wilcox in 1903, she remained active in Hawai`i politics and made national news, she was called upon by many, such as Queen Dowager Margherita of Savoy, Prince Ferdinando, Duke of Genoa and the Chinese Consul, Chang Tso Fan during a reception on New Years Day. She was a master in coordinating luau&#x27;s for events and political parties some attended by Liliuokalani, she was known for her large luau&#x27;s at her Kaimuki home which was called &quot;Luauville&quot; because of it. She started her own Pa&#x27;u riding club and a hula entertainment business.

== Queen Liliʻuokalani&#x27;s alleged forged will and conspiracies ==

When Queen Liliʻuokalani died on November 11, 1917, two controversial wills of her estate were being presented for probate, the first one, a trust deed which was executed on December 2, 1909, was already in litigation for several years by Prince Kuhio. He filed a lawsuit against the trustees on November 30, 1915, for an annulment of the 1909 trust deed as being a result of a conspiracy on the part of Curtis Iaukea and John Aimoku Dominis. The other presented will dated on August 29, 1917, caused much debate of who would have immediate authority over Lili`uokalani&#x27;s funeral services and her estate. The appointed trustees of the 1909 trust deed and Kuhio both objected to the second presented will of 1917, saying they would contest it. The 1917 will, said to be Lili`uokalani&#x27;s last will and testament, divided her estate to Theresa and her two children, Elizabeth Keka`aniau, Prince David Kawananakoa and children, Aimoku Dominis and children, Fred Iaukea, Mrs Huchison, Curtis Iaukea, Mrs Lahilahi Webb, Mrs. Waikiki Heleluhe and daughter, Mrs. Kahae Aea, Mrs. Kahanuʻu Meek, Mrs Mary Auld, Mrs. Lilia Auld, Mrs. Laura Puhiula, Mrs. Kaahawelani and children, Mrs. Paakai Ulaula Bush and children, Mrs. Chas Guilick, Mrs. Ellen Dwight, Mrs. Anaole, Saint Andrews Cathedral, Leahi Home, Board of Health, Leper Colony Settlement, Lili`uokalani School, Wainee Church, Mrs. Hakanoaloha Mana, Mrs. Jennie Clark and Fred Beckley, (Presented at 840 a.m. November 19, 1917, clerks office), (#1142 Received and filed in the Supreme Court, Nov. 11, 1918, Robert Parker Jr., assistant clerk), Hawai`i State Archives.

Theresa claimed that the queen signed the will on August 29, 1917, in the presence of herself and two witnesses who were named on the will as James Kealoha and Kamakaia. John F Colburn, former manager and treasurer of Kapiolani&#x27;s estate was the executor of the will, his lawyers brought in the witnesses to interrogate and examine them in separate rooms. The witnesses signed sworn affidavits under oath that they witnessed the queen signing the will, describing it in great detail and they were found to be telling the truth. Soon after, Kamakaia was paid a large sum of money ($900.00) by an unknown foreigner and suddenly changed his story and said he lied and that the queen did not sign the will. He said that Theresa told him what to say in exchange of a church and that god told him to tell the truth. After changing his statement, Theresa was being accused of forging the will, Theresa claimed that &quot;they must have got to him&quot; and that he is lying. The will was immediately withdrawn, but a conviction was needed to prevent it from ever surfacing again in probate. Theresa was then prosecuted by the Territorial Court for conspiracy of forgery and Kamakaia was to be the key witness for the prosecution. Theresa pleaded not guilty and in her defense, she claimed that &quot;it was all a cover up&quot; by her enemies and that the queen did not trust them. She further stated that upon Prince Kuhio&#x27;s lawsuit against the trustees, the queen had asked to prepare another will so she may leave something for her and her children since they were related. It was stated that Iaukea said the queen wanted to execute a new will and she had already started drafting one in July. But Theresa was found guilty and in 1918, she was sentenced to three years of hard labor in prison for conspiracy in the first degree along with James Kealoha. Her sentence was commuted in June 1922, and she was released on parole from the territorial prison by Governor McCarthy. Her full civil rights were restored by Governor Farrington in his Christmas pardons in 1923. She continued to maintain her innocence throughout her life.

== Queen Liliuokalani&#x27;s estate, next of kin claimants ==
Four other court cases surrounded Kuhio&#x27;s lawsuit to dissolve Liliuokalani&#x27;s trust and claim next of kin to the queen&#x27;s estate. One was Theresa, the other three claimants were John Colburn, representing the Kawananakoa minors, Emma Defries and Mrs. Keawe Nawahie. Theresa claimed next of kin as a great-granddaughter of Keohokālole, Liliuokalani&#x27;s mother, through her own mother Kamaikaopa. Theresa claimed that Keohokalole had four husbands, Kumimeheua was the first husband and Kapaakea the second. Kauahaka was the issue of Keohokalole and Kumimeheua. Kauahaka had a husband by the name of Kaukahele and born was Kamaikaopa who married Gideon Kailipalaki La`anui and had Theresa. Her aunt, Elizabeth Keka`aniau testified in court that it was true along with other testimony from her mother&#x27;s sister and by elder Hawaiians. But without further sufficient evidence, the claim was dismissed by the Territorial Supreme Court. The other three claimants, John Colburn, for the Kawananakoa minors was ruled against and dropped out of court, Emma Defries and Mrs. Keawe Nawahie, were all dismissed by the Territorial Supreme Court for insufficient evidence as well. The trustees of Lili`uokalani&#x27;s estate sued all three Theresa, Emma Defries and Nawahie, demanding to be re-reimbursed for court costs (First Judicial Circuit Court Territory of Hawaii, Filed April 2, 1919, Hawaii State Archives). Kuhio&#x27;s case was settled out-of-court, in exchange of Kuhio dropping the suit, he was awarded the fee simple ownership of Kealohilani property and all his legal expenses were paid by the trustees, Washington Place was to be sold to the Territorial government.

Both the 1917 alleged forged will and the lawsuit of Prince Kuhio against the Lili`uokalani&#x27;s trustees, delayed the distribution of the queen&#x27;s estate up to six years. Lili`uokalani&#x27;s 1909 trust deed was finally admitted to probate in 1923, The lawyer who recommended, drafted and assisted Liliuokalani to establish the trust was William O. Smith (one of the conspirators of the overthrow who drafted the &quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot;) he was also one the trustees for her estate.

== Later life ==
In 1923, After Delegate Kuhio died, his widow received a pension from the U.S. Territory, Theresa claimed and petitioned to receive a pension also, stating that she was entitled as well because she was the widow of the first Delegate to Congress. Lorrin Thurston, agreed to her plead and represented her case with an article in his newspaper, the Advertiser. In support of her claim, he said that Theresa and Kuhio were both equal to the throne and that Theresa was a victim of circumstance and now she is in need of financial help as a widow of a delegate. The Territory agreed and Theresa received her monthly pension.

In 1936, Theresa&#x27;s status as a member of the Kamehameha dynasty was called upon by Postmaster Wilson. The Postmaster received a postcard addressed to Kamehameha and did not know what to do with it, so he called on Princess Theresa to legally open the envelope. It was a request from a stamp collector in Pennsylvania asking to receive the new Kamehameha stamp. When the new Kamehameha stamps were issued, it broke national records in sales and 1000 stamps were endorsed by Princess Theresa. While endorsing the stamps, she wore her shell bracelet from Queen Ka`ahumanu and a brooch from Queen Emma in honor of the Kamehameha Dynasty.

In 1942, a huge luau was given for her birthday, some of the events were sponsored on the part of Mayor Petrie, endorsing the Royal Hawaiian Band to serenade her at her house on 7th avenue in Kaimuki where the celebration was held. Many friends and relatives called on her throughout the day and enjoyed the luau. The second grade students from Iolani School came to present her with leis. She was assisted by her daughters Eva Cartwright, Virginia Kapu Miller and her grand daughter, Helena Salazar, also her great-granddaughter, Victoria Kamamalu Shaw greeted the guests.

== Death and claims ==
On February 10, 1909, Theresa married Lewis R. Belliveau. and on January 16, 1922, she married John G. Kelly., divorcing both. She continued throughout her life to stake claims for the restoration of the monarchy and inheritance of the crown lands that were being held and used by the Territory of Hawaii. In her life story published in 1936, she claimed she may have been queen and that someday she would restore the rights of Hawaiians to their land. If she was awarded inheritance of the crown lands of Hawaii, she would give each family beach front to catch fish and lobster and gather seaweed, and a mountain property to raise pigs, chickens and taro, also building free schools and free hospitals in every district, all anybody could need and want. Today, her family continues to carry on her claims. Theresa Owana Ka`ohelelani died on January 5, 1944, at The Queen&#x27;s Hospital and was buried at the Puea Cemetery in Kalihi., but was later removed and cremated.

<text>CKCW-DT (channel 2) is a television station in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. It serves as the network&#x27;s outlet for both New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island (by way of a repeater in Charlottetown). Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, CKCW-DT maintains studios at Halifax and George Streets in Moncton, with a PEI bureau in Charlottetown. Its transmitter is located on Wilson Road in Hillsborough.

CKCW-DT is part of the CTV Atlantic regional system in the Maritimes. It is a sister station to CKLT-DT in Saint John, which essentially operates as a CKCW rebroadcaster even though it is separately licensed.

==History==
The station first went on the air in 1954 and was founded by Fred A. Lynds and his company, Moncton Broadcasting, along with CKCW radio (AM 1220, now 94.5 FM). It was originally the CBC Television affiliate for central and northern New Brunswick. CKCW was part of a regional network of stations called the Lionel Television System. Its mascot was called Lionel the Lobster.

On September 21, 1969, as part of a complex realignment of television affiliations in the Maritimes, Saint John&#x27;s original station, CHSJ-TV (now CBAT-DT) set up a rebroadcaster in Moncton, enabling CKCW-TV to switch to CTV. CKCW then built a full-time satellite in Saint John, CKLT. However, since CHSJ-TV needed time to build rebroadcasters in the northern part of the province, CKCW&#x27;s rebroadcasters in Campbellton, Upsalquitch and Newcastle aired a mixed CBC-CTV schedule until October 1976.

The two stations were bought by CHUM Limited and merged into the Atlantic Television System, forerunner of CTV Atlantic, in 1972. At the same time, CKCW signed on a repeater in Charlottetown, making PEI the last portion of eastern Canada to receive CTV.

Although for many years the station continued to air local programming, since the mid-1990s it has been a semi-satellite of CTV Atlantic flagship CJCH-DT in Halifax, Nova Scotia, except for local news inserts and some commercials.

===Transmitters===
* These and a long list of CTV rebroadcasters nationwide were to shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators. A subsequent change in ownership assigned full control of CTVglobemedia to Bell Canada; as of 2011, these transmitters remain in normal licensed broadcast operation.

Additionally, CKLT (and its associated rebroadcasters) is considered a full-time satellite of CKCW.

On February 11, 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular license renewals, which included applications to delete a long list of transmitters, including CKAM-TV-1, CKAM-TV-2, CKCW-TV-2, and CKCD-TV. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analog repeaters is below:
&quot;We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.&quot;
At the same time, Bell Media applied to convert the licenses of CTV2 Atlantic (formerly ASN) and CTV2 Alberta (formerly ACCESS) from satellite-to-cable undertakings into television stations without transmitters (similar to cable-only network affiliates in the United States), and to reduce the level of educational content on CTV2 Alberta.

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down two additional transmitters as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019–268. The transmitters for CKAM-TV-3 and CKAM-TV-4 will be shut down by December 3, 2021.

===Former repeaters===

On January 27, 2016, Bell Media was granted approval by the CRTC to delete their analog repeater (CKAM-TV) in Upsalquitch, New Brunswick. Bell estimated that only 200 viewers were served by this transmitter, and had received zero complaints or questions about the proposed shut-down. To further complicate matters, the high-powered VHF transmitter cost a great deal to maintain and operate, as well being expensive on electricity, and does not bring in any revenue of its own. Since CKCW-DT would remain available on local cable and satellite providers, there would be no loss of coverage or CTV programming to the area.

<text>CKLT-DT (channel 9) is a television station in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, the station has studios on Brunswick Square in Saint John, and its transmitter is located near Whitaker Lake in Petersville. It also operates analogue rebroadcast transmitters in Woodstock and Boiestown.

CKLT-DT is part of the CTV Atlantic regional system in The Maritimes. Although separately licensed, the station (along with its two rebroadcasters) is considered a full-time satellite of CKCW-DT in Moncton. Master control and most internal operations are based at CKCW&#x27;s studios on Halifax and George Streets in Moncton.

Its programming is the same as that of CTV Atlantic flagship CJCH-DT in Halifax, Nova Scotia, with commercials provided from Moncton.

==History==
CKLT signed on for the first time on September 21, 1969, owned by Moncton Broadcasting along with CKCW-TV. As part of a complex realignment of television affiliations in the Maritimes, Saint John&#x27;s original station, CHSJ-TV (now CBAT-DT) set up a translator in Moncton, enabling CKCW-TV to switch to CTV. CHUM Limited bought CKCW-TV and CKLT-TV in 1972 and merged them into the Atlantic Television System (ATV) later that year. Along with the rest of the ATV stations, it was sold to Baton Broadcasting on February 26, 1997 (with CRTC approval given on August 28, 1997), enabling Baton to take control of CTV.

<text>CJCB-DT (channel 4) is a repeater television station in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, the station has a transmitter in Blacketts Lake southwest of the city. It operated a TV studio in Sydney from 1954 until 2021, with all production and master control work now done in Halifax at CJCH-DT.

On August 1, 2012, CJCB-DT – at the time known as CJCB-TV – became the only terrestrial broadcaster in the market. CBC repeater station, CBIT-TV, was closed the previous evening. CJCB-TV became CJCB-DT in January 2022 when it switched to digital broadcasting.

CJCB-DT is part of the CTV Atlantic regional system in the Maritimes, carrying the same programming as sister station CJCH-DT at all times, except for some commercials and an annual telethon. &quot;Mass for Shut-ins&quot; is the last original program still associated with the station that is still broadcasting. Currently, it is a two-person news bureau covering Cape Breton Island for CTV News.

==History==

===CBC affiliate===
CJCB-TV was the first television station to broadcast in Nova Scotia, when it signed on for the first time on October 9, 1954, beating CBHT-TV in Halifax by two months. Nate Nathanson named the station after his wife and the island he lived on. So, its call sign means &quot;Canada Jennie Cape Breton&quot; (CJCB) which originated at its sister radio station CJCB (AM). It was originally a CBC affiliate. It joined the Trans Canada Microwave network on July 1, 1958, linking all CBC stations between Sydney to British Columbia. Prior to the microwave connection, programming was either from live local studio productions or kinescope 16mm film copies of CBC network shows.

===Ownership, CTV affiliation===
CJCB was originally owned by the Nathanson family, who also owned CJCB radio at the time. CHUM Limited, owner of CJCH-TV, bought CJCB-TV in 1971 and applied to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to switch it to the CTV network. The switch occurred on September 26, 1972, when the CBC put CBIT-TV on the air in Sydney. After the switch occurred, it immediately joined the newly formed Atlantic Television Network (ATV), CHUM&#x27;s network of CTV affiliates in the Maritimes.

As part of CBIT&#x27;s licence, it was not allowed to show local advertising, leaving CJCB with a monopoly in local advertising. CJCB&#x27;s monopoly was reaffirmed in a CRTC decision in 1985 that denied a CBIT request to enter that part of the market. CHUM continued to own CJCB-TV until February 26, 1997, when it swapped the entire ATV group to Baton Broadcasting. The CRTC approved the deal on August 28, 1997. With the deal approved by CRTC, Baton became the majority owner of CTV.

Baton changed its name to CTV Inc. and was bought by Bell Canada Enterprises Inc. (BCE) in 2000 but BCE divested most of its shares in 2005. In October 2005, all CTV owned-and-operated stations stopped using their call sign as their brand name, meaning CJCB-TV became &quot;CTV Sydney&quot;. BCE purchased 100 percent of CTV Inc.&#x27;s shares in a $1.3 billion CAD deal and changed the name of its division that dealt with CTV and CJCB-TV to Bell Media when the acquisition was finalized on April 1, 2011.&lt;ref name = &quot;BCE/CTV Deal Completed&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
CJCB-TV maintained offices, studios and the main transmitter tower at 1283 George Street in Sydney since it opened in 1954. It was the last of the three ATV stations to get colour production equipement. The station fully converted to NTSC colour production in 1975, though it was able to transmit colour programming originated through the network starting in September 1966. The offices and studio were permanently closed in February 2021, after being temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. After the switch to ATSC digital broadcasting, in January 2022, the old analogue NTSC transmitter was turned off. Bell Media had the unmaintained tower demolished in July 2023. The current digital transmitter tower is located at 345 McMillan Road, in Blacketts Lake, southwest of Sydney.

==Programming==
One of Canada&#x27;s longest-running TV programs, &quot;Mass for Shut-ins&quot;, originates at CJCB-TV. It premiered on March 3, 1963. Since before the closure of the TV studio, in 2021, the show is recorded at various churches in Cape Breton and on the eastern mainland. The program continues to be telecast across the CTV Atlantic system.

&quot;Shantytown&quot; was another TV program that originated at CJCB-TV; it was aimed at children and ran from 1978 to 1984. Like &quot;Mass for Shut-ins&quot;, it was also telecast to all three Maritime provinces. Characters include Sam the Sailor, Katie the Craft Lady, Marjorie the Music Lady and their puppet friends.

Local broadcaster, and occasional CBC-TV &quot;Front Page Challenge&quot; panelist, Anne Terry, worked on many programs from the station&#x27;s debut, until she left broadcasting in August 1972. She was known for hosting &quot;women&#x27;s feature&quot; and interview programs at CJCB.

CJCB had an evening weekday newscast until 1980, when all newscasts were centralized at ATV’s studios in Halifax. Until the pandemic, the CJCB studio was used for filing reports from the various reporters that worked on Cape Breton stories. When Bell Media closed the Sydney studio, in 2021, it only had two reporters remaining. Bell went through many rounds of layoffs in January and February 2024, and that caused CTV Sydney to lose reporter Kyle Moore. The remaining reporter is Ryan MacDonald, and a producer.

==Technical information==
===Subchannel===
===Analogue-to-digital conversion===
The station ceased broadcasting in analogue NTSC on January 28, 2022, and began broadcasting in digital ATSC on the same date.

===Transmitters===
The station has analogue rebroadcast transmitters in the following communities:

The station originally operated CJCB-TV-4 (channel 2) in New Glasgow, until that transmitter closed in late 2010. The transmitter was closed down for years, as the area was also being served by the CJCB-TV-2 transmitter in nearby Antigonish.

During the CRTC&#x27;s licence renewal period in 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular license renewals, which included applications to delete 40 rebroadcast transmitters, including CJCB-TV-5. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analog repeaters was they were costly to operate and maintain; they did not generate much revenue; and viewers mostly had direct-to-home satellite subscriptions that carried these same signals.

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down an additional transmitter as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. The transmitter for CJCB-TV-3 was shut down in 2021.

<text>Vergennes Union High School is a high school/junior high school of about 700 students in Vergennes, Vermont, United States. The school serves the city of Vergennes, as well as the towns of Addison, Ferrisburgh, Panton, and Waltham. This group of towns is the Addison Northwest School District.

==Campus ==
Aside from over 31 rooms, the school&#x27;s main structural features are a cafeteria, library, auditorium (renovated 2014), two gymnasiums, a computer center, a wood and metal shop, a chorus room, and an acoustic music rehearsal chamber.

==Student life==
Each student meets in an advisor led daily group called a Morning Meeting with 10-12 other students. Students have the same advisor for the two years spent in middle school and a different advisor for the four years spent in high school. In order for students to graduate, they must create and maintain a Graduation Portfolio that reflects their knowledge, skills, and understanding of particular topics. This is called a Performance Based Graduation Requirement (PBGR). Students who have taken German II or above have the opportunity to participate in a German exchange program that has been going on since 1990. German students from Bochum, Germany visit and stay in student host families in the fall semester, and Vergennes students take a trip to Germany during the spring semester. Students have the opportunity to visit historical landmarks such as the Berlin wall in Berlin, Germany before they reach Bochum, Germany where they are hosted by the same German students who visited in the fall. Spanish students also have the opportunity to travel to Costa Rica as a school trip.

The school day runs from 8am-3:10pm.

Performance Based Graduation Requirements:

== Bicknell v. Vergennes Union High School ==
In 1979, the Vergennes Union High School Board of Directors ordered the removal of two books,
&quot;The Wanderers&quot; and &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, from the school library&#x27;s collection.
The school librarian Elizabeth Phillips and others challenged the removal in the federal court case
&quot;Bicknell v. Vergennes Union High School&quot;. A U.S. District Court judge dismissed the case
holding that school boards had the final authority to determine the inclusion or removal of
works from school library collections. In 1980, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the dismissal.

<doc id="1185725" wikidata="Q7824273" url="?curid=1185725" title="Tooth of Time">
<text>The Tooth of Time is an igneous intrusion of dacite porphyry formed in the tertiary period some 22 to 40 million years ago. It is a geological feature on the Philmont Scout Ranch located southwest of Cimarron, New Mexico, United States, and is one of Philmont&#x27;s most popular sights. It is an igneous intrusion of dacite porphyry formed in the Paleogene Period of the Cenozoic Era some 22-40 million years ago.

== Santa Fe Trail ==

The Tooth rises prominently from the valley floor, some below, creating a sheer vertical face unable to support substantial plant life. Both its pinkish-gray color and its unusual shape make it a particularly notable geological landmark. It was well known among the overland traders on the Santa Fe Trail, who used it to mark the final seven-day push to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

== Geology ==

The Tooth was formed when magma from deep within the Earth rose through older rock layers and slowly cooled. Over many thousands of years, the older sedimentary rock eroded and left the harder igneous formation. The sedimentary rock acted as a mold for the intrusive magma, causing it to harden and cool where the sedimentary rock was strongest.

The Tooth sits atop a prominent ridge created through the process mentioned above.

== Climbing ==

The Tooth of Time is located on the east end of Tooth of Time Ridge, while Shaefer&#x27;s Peak is located on the west end of the ridge. A trail extends about 3.5 miles from Shaefer&#x27;s Pass to the Tooth Ridge campsite, located at the base of the Tooth of Time, with a short scramble ascending the Tooth. Another trail, known as the Stockade Trail, extends along the steeper back side and terminates at an animal stockade along a road. The first roped ascent of the main face was completed in July, 1972 by Lee Davis, Rick Barrett and Randy Wright.

<doc id="1185739" wikidata="Q5297892" url="?curid=1185739" title="Doris Anderson">
<text>Doris Hilda Anderson, (November 10, 1921 – March 2, 2007) was a Canadian author, journalist and women&#x27;s rights activist. She is best known as the editor of the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, mixing traditional content (recipes, décor) with thorny social issues of the day (violence against women, pay equality, abortion, race, poverty), putting the magazine on the front lines of the feminist movement in Canada. Her activism beyond the magazine helped drive social and political change, enshrining women&#x27;s equality in the Canadian Constitution and making her one of the most well-known names in the women&#x27;s movement in Canada.

==Personal life==
Doris Anderson was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta as Hilda Doris Buck to Rebecca Laycock Buck and Thomas McCubbin. Mrs. Buck, whose first husband had abandoned her and her two young sons, leaving them in debt, met McCubbin when he was a guest at her mother&#x27;s boarding house in Calgary. She was staying with her sisters in Medicine Hat when Anderson was born and briefly placed her &quot;illegitimate&quot; child in a home for unwanted babies in Calgary, reclaiming her several months later. Buck and McCubbin married shortly before Anderson&#x27;s eighth birthday.

Anderson described her father as difficult and domineering, rebuking her forward and unladylike demeanour. Her mother wanted Anderson to be demure, keep her head down and conform to &quot;respectable&quot; expectations, perhaps as a result of her experiences as a single mother bearing a child out of wedlock. Anderson chafed under the expectations of her parents that she marry and raise children and chose instead to forge an independent life.

Anderson attended Crescent Heights High School and went on to graduate from teacher&#x27;s college in 1940. She used her teaching income to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Alberta in 1945.

Anderson married Prince Edward Island-born lawyer and Liberal Party organizer David Anderson in 1957. The pair had three sons: Peter (born 1958), Stephen (born 1961), and Mitchell (born 1963), before divorcing in 1972. Theirs was not a love match; she married because she wanted children.

When her employers discovered she was pregnant, they sent her to work at home. At the time, women were expected to resign from their employment when their pregnancies began to show. Anderson, however, worked until her due date, and returned to work almost immediately (there was no parental leave available).

==Career at &quot;Chatelaine&quot;==
Upon receiving her degree, Anderson wrote and sold pieces of fiction and spent time in Europe before she returned to Canada and secured a job writing advertising copy for &quot;Chatelaine&quot; in 1951. By 1955, she&#x27;d worked her way up to associate editor. When John Clare, the editor, stepped down, and a new male editor was appointed, Anderson threatened to quit, and her publisher eventually relented and gave her the job instead.

Anderson held the position of editor of &quot;Chatelaine&quot; from 1957 to 1977. Her early tenure at the magazine saw it transformed from a traditional women&#x27;s publication into one that addressed challenging issues of the day, including legal abortion in specific circumstances (1959), child abuse (1960), Canadian divorce laws (1961) and a call for equal pay for women (1962). The female writers she employed (June Callwood, Barbara Frum, Adrienne Clarkson, and Michele Landsberg) would go on to have successful careers as journalists.

In 1963, Anderson chose not to run an excerpt from a new novel in &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, feeling the material had already been well explored by the magazine. The book was Betty Friedan&#x27;s &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;.

In 1969, she campaigned for, and did not receive, the editorship of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine, losing the job to Peter Gzowski despite her significantly longer tenure with the company and her track record of success. The job would have meant more than increased visibility in the publishing industry – it paid more than twice as much. The publisher said that she wouldn&#x27;t have been able to represent the company publicly, but couldn&#x27;t explain why.

Promoting the role of women in politics under her direction, &quot;Chatelaine&quot; identified 50 women who had potential as parliamentarians and put 12 of them - including Member of Parliament Flora MacDonald - on the cover. For much of her life, Anderson supported greater representation of women in Parliament.

She departed &quot;Chatelaine&quot; in 1977. In her two decades as editor, she&#x27;d tripled circulation of the magazine, and made it the most profitable of the Maclean-Hunter publications. By the late 1960s, one in every three women in Canada was reading the magazine.

In 2008, the magazine was recognized as the second-most influential magazine in Canada – just ahead of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;.

==Post-&quot;Chatelaine&quot; career==
In the 1978 by-election she ran unsuccessfully for the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal in the Toronto riding of Eglinton, as the Liberals were swept from office in a wave of anti-Trudeau sentiment.

She was appointed chair of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women (CACSW) in 1979. She worked successfully for the inclusion of women&#x27;s rights in the Canadian Constitution and the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; (section 28), adding a single statement to the Charter indicating that men and women are equal under law. The specific wording reads: &quot;Notwithstanding anything in the Charter, the rights and freedoms referred to in it are guaranteed to male and female persons.&quot; It was clear, Anderson said, &quot;that the charter of rights could do good things for women or, if it was a bad charter, it could be a terrible problem for women for generations to come.&quot;

With CACSW, she commissioned research into issues such as the prevalence and prevention of domestic abuse and other violence against women.

Her frustration with the status quo was evident in a column published in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; in 1980, where she wrote of wage inequality, domestic violence, and being ignored by politicians.

From 1982 to 1984, she was the president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, where she was known as a peacemaker within the movement. For almost a decade, beginning in 1984, she was a columnist for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; (that ended when she refused to cross a picket line when &quot;Star&quot; writers were on strike). She was named a recipient of the Governor General&#x27;s Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case in 1991, and served as Chancellor of the University of Prince Edward Island from 1992 to 1996.

In 1994, Doris Anderson was invited to be an observer in the South African election that brought Nelson Mandela to power and ended apartheid, an opportunity her son Mitchell described as &quot;one of the greatest thrills of his mother&#x27;s life.&quot;

==Final years==
Anderson was named the chair of the Ontario Press Council in 1998, and in 2001, the Doris Anderson Ontario Graduate Scholarship in Women&#x27;s Studies was established at York University to recognize her contributions. She was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 2002, the last public award she received during her lifetime.

Anderson&#x27;s final years were marked by ill health, from heart failure in 2001 to numerous other health problems that developed after a 2006 visit to Costa Rica. In February 2007, she was admitted to St. Michael&#x27;s Hospital in Toronto, where she died on March 2 at age 85 from pulmonary fibrosis.

==Legacy==
Doris Anderson has been posthumously recognized for her contributions to Canadian society. In 2016, her accomplishments were recognized on a plaque by Heritage Toronto. In 2017, she was included in the &quot;She Who Dares&quot; project by the Calgary YWCA, which recognized women who impacted Calgary as part of Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial.

Anderson&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Rebel Daughter&quot;, was transformed into a play by students at the University of Toronto Mississauga and Sheridan College in 2014, which became the subject of a radio documentary entitled &quot;Daughters and Sons&quot;

Her impact on Canadian feminism was documented in a 2007 edition of &quot;Canadian Woman Studies&quot;, entitled &quot;Celebrating Doris Anderson&quot;.

In 1981 a grass-roots, feminist group opened an emergency shelter for women and children fleeing violence and named it Anderson House, after Doris Anderson. The shelter is still in operation today.

==Honours==
Doris Anderson was widely recognized, and received many awards during her life:
* National honours: Canadian Centennial Medal (1967); Officer of the Order of Canada (1974); Governor General&#x27;s Awards in Commemoration of the Persons Case (1991); Companion of the Order of Canada (2002)

<doc id="1185745" wikidata="Q1634355" url="?curid=1185745" title="Dodes'ka-den">
<text>is a 1970 Japanese drama film directed by Akira Kurosawa. The film stars Yoshitaka Zushi, Kin Sugai, Toshiyuki Tonomura, and Shinsuke Minami. It is based on Shūgorō Yamamoto&#x27;s 1962 novel &quot;A City Without Seasons&quot; and is about a group of homeless and poverty-stricken people living on the outskirts of Tokyo.

&quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; was Kurosawa&#x27;s first film in five years, his first without actor Toshiro Mifune since &quot;Red Beard&quot; in 1965, and his first without composer Masaru Sato since &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; in 1954. Filming began on April 23, 1970, and ended 28 days later. This was Kurosawa&#x27;s first-ever color film and had a budget of only . In order to finance the film, Kurosawa mortgaged his house, but it failed at the box office, grossing less than its budget, leaving him with large debts and, at sixty-one years old, dim employment prospects. Kurosawa&#x27;s disappointment culminated one year later on December 22, 1971, when he attempted suicide.

==Plot==
The film is an anthology of overlapping vignettes exploring the lives of a variety of characters who live in a suburban shantytown atop a rubbish dump. The first to be introduced is Roku-chan, a boy who lives in a fantasy world in which he is a trolley driver. In his fantasy world, he drives his trolley along a set route and schedule through the dump, reciting the refrain &quot;dodeska-den&quot; (&quot;clickety-clack&quot;, mimicking the sound of a trolley). His dedication to the fantasy is fanatical. Roku-chan is called &quot;trolley freak&quot; (&quot;densha baka&quot;) by locals and by children from outside the shantytown. His mother is concerned that Roku-chan is genuinely mentally challenged. (Roku-chan has earned the label in several cinematographic writings.)

Ryotaro, a hairbrush maker by trade, is saddled with supporting many children whom his unfaithful wife Misao has conceived in different adulterous affairs, but he is wholeheartedly devoted to them. A pair of drunken day laborers (Masuda and Kawaguchi) engage in wife-swapping, only to return to their own wives the next day as though nothing has happened. A stoic, bleak man named Hei is frequently visited by Ocho, who appears to be his ex-wife, and he watches emotionless as she does his domestic chores. It is eventually revealed that she cheated on him and returned, wracked with guilt; he does not forgive her. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Shima, a man with a tic who is always defending his outwardly unpleasant and bullying wife. He flies into a rage when friends criticize her and says that she&#x27;s always been there for him. A beggar and his son live in a derelict car, a Citroën 2CV. While the father is preoccupied with daydreams of owning a magnificent home, the boy dies tragically of food poisoning and his father&#x27;s neglect. He buries his son&#x27;s cremated remains with Tanba&#x27;s help, still keeping up the fantasy that the grave is a swimming pool built for his son to enjoy. Katsuko, a mute girl, is raped by her alcoholic uncle and becomes pregnant, and in a fit of irrationality stabs Okabe, a boy who works at the liquor shop who has tender feelings for her, not having any other way to vent her emotional turmoil. When her uncle is confronted as a suspect for this abusive act, he flees town. Okabe recovers and forgives Katsuko when she apologizes to him, his warmth toward her undaubted. Tanba the chasework silversmith is a sage figure who shows kindness to the people of the town, disarming a youth swinging a katana sword with understanding words and helping a burglar who broke into his house, first by giving him money and later denying to police that a robbery occurred.

After exploring the setbacks and anguish that surround many of the indigent characters, along with the dreams of escape that many of them support to maintain at least a superficial level of calm, the film comes full circle, returning to Roku-chan as he returns home, takes his imaginary tram conductor hat off, and hangs it up.

==Production==
Five years had elapsed since the release of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s last film, &quot;Red Beard&quot; (1965). The Japanese film industry was collapsing as the major studios were slashing their production schedules or shutting down entirely due to television stealing the movie audience. When Kurosawa was let go from the American film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; by Twentieth Century Fox in 1969, it was rumored that the Japanese director&#x27;s mental health was deteriorating. Teruyo Nogami, Kurosawa&#x27;s frequent script supervisor, believes the director needed to make a good film to put that rumor to rest. &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; was made possible by Kurosawa forming the Club of the Four Knights production company with three other Japanese directors; Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa. It was their first and only production.

It marks a stylistic departure from Kurosawa&#x27;s previous works. It has no central story and no protagonist. Instead it weaves together the stories of a group of characters living in a slum as a series of anecdotes. It was his first color film, and he had only ever worked with a few of the actors previously; Kamatari Fujiwara, Atsushi Watanabe, Kunie Tanaka, and Yoshitaka Zushi. It marks the first time Kurosawa had used Takao Saito as principal cinematographer, and Saito became his &quot;cinematographer of choice&quot; for the rest of his career. Nogami said that Kurosawa told the crew that this time he wanted to make a film that is &quot;sunny, light, and endearing.&quot; She speculated that &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; was his rebuttal to what went wrong on &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;. The script supervisor of the film opined that the director was still recuperating from the shock of what happened on that Hollywood film, and was not operating at full strength. Nogami said that she gets choked up whenever she watches the scene where Rokuchan is called &quot;trolley crazy&quot; by children, because she imagines Kurosawa as the boy, with people yelling &quot;Movie-crazy&quot; at him. Kurosawa said that he wanted to show younger filmmakers that it did not need to cost a lot of money to make a movie. David A. Conrad wrote that an influence of the surging Japanese New Wave can be felt in this impulse and in the decision to focus on outcasts in contemporary society.

===Filming===
In contrast to &quot;Red Beard&quot;, which was in production for two years, filming for &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; began on April 23, 1970, and was finished in only 27 days, two months ahead of schedule. According to Stephen Prince, it was shot for standard-ratio 35 mm movie film rather than the anamorphic widescreen that Kurosawa had used since &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot; (1958). Prince writes that this was because the director did not like how anamorphic lenses handled color information. As a result, it marks a return to the 1.33:1 aspect ratio he used regularly in the 1940s and early 1950s. Prince also states that &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; marks the first time the director used zoom lenses; a sign of the &quot;speed and economy&quot; with which he made the film. Nogami stated that she had never seen Kurosawa as &quot;quiet and undemanding&quot; on set as he was for &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot;. As an example, she explained how during a nine-minute scene that had to be shot in one take, Junzaburō Ban had trouble memorizing all of his dialogue and caused numerous retakes. Nogami said &quot;the old Kurosawa&quot; would have lost his temper and started yelling, but instead he just gently said &quot;let&#x27;s try it again.&quot; and eventually praised Ban when the shot was finally completed. Nogami also related how Fujiwara was well-known for not being able to memorize his lines. While filming an eight-minute scene with Watanabe, Kurosawa finally had had enough and had Nogami give Fujiwara verbal prompts. Nogami said her voice was hard to remove from the final tape. The drawings that cover the walls of Rokuchan&#x27;s house were initially drawn by Kurosawa at home. But he decided they were too &quot;grown-up&quot;, and had schoolchildren draw them instead.

===Title===
The film&#x27;s title &quot;Dodeska-den&quot; are the playacting &quot;words&quot; uttered by the boy character to mimic the sound of his imaginary trolley car in motion. It is not a commonly used onomatopoeic word in the Japanese vocabulary, but was invented by author Shūgorō Yamamoto in &quot;&quot; (&quot;A City Without Seasons&quot;), the original novel on which the film was based. In standard Japanese language, this sound would be described as &quot;gatan goton&quot;, equivalent to &quot;clickity-clack&quot; in English.

==Reception==
&quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; was Kurosawa&#x27;s first film in color. Domestically, it was both a commercial and critical failure upon its initial release. Abroad, however, the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 44th Academy Awards. Its Japanese reception, among other things, sent Kurosawa into a deep depression, and in 1971 he attempted suicide.

Despite continuing to draw mixed responses, &quot;Dodes&#x27;ka-den&quot; received votes from two artists – Sion Sono and the Dardenne brothers – in the British Film Institute&#x27;s 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls of the world&#x27;s greatest films.

==Awards==
The film won the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association.

==Documentary and home media==
A significant short 36-minute documentary was made by Toho Masterworks concerning this film, &quot;Akira Kurosawa: It Is Wonderful to Create&quot; (Toho Masterworks, 2002). The film was released by the Criterion Collection on DVD in 2009, and it includes the documentary by Toho Masterworks.

<doc id="1185756" wikidata="Q1193365" url="?curid=1185756" title="Eightfold way (physics)">
<text>In physics, the eightfold way is an organizational scheme for a class of subatomic particles known as hadrons that led to the development of the quark model. Both the American physicist Murray Gell-Mann and the Israeli physicist Yuval Ne&#x27;eman independently and simultaneously proposed the idea in 1961.
The name comes from Gell-Mann&#x27;s (1961) paper and is an allusion to the Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism.

==Background==
By 1947, physicists believed that they had a good understanding of what the smallest bits of matter were. There were electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons (the components that make up the vast part of everyday experience such as visible matter and light) along with a handful of unstable (i.e., they undergo radioactive decay) exotic particles needed to explain cosmic rays observations such as pions, muons and the hypothesized neutrinos. In addition, the discovery of the positron suggested there could be anti-particles for each of them. It was known a &quot;strong interaction&quot; must exist to overcome electrostatic repulsion in atomic nuclei. Not all particles are influenced by this strong force; but those that are, are dubbed &quot;hadrons&quot;; these are now further classified as mesons (from the Greek for &quot;intermediate&quot;) and baryons (from the Greek for &quot;heavy&quot;).

But the discovery of the neutral kaon in late 1947 and the subsequent discovery of a positively charged kaon in 1949 extended the meson family in an unexpected way, and in 1950 the lambda particle did the same thing for the baryon family. These particles decay much more slowly than they are produced, a hint that there are two different physical processes involved. This was first suggested by Abraham Pais in 1952. In 1953, Murray Gell-Mann and a collaboration in Japan, Tadao Nakano with Kazuhiko Nishijima, independently suggested a new conserved value now known as &quot;strangeness&quot; during their attempts to understand the growing collection of known particles.
The discovery of new mesons and baryons continued through the 1950s; the number of known &quot;elementary&quot; particles ballooned. Physicists were interested in understanding hadron-hadron interactions via the strong interaction. The concept of isospin, introduced in 1932 by Werner Heisenberg shortly after the discovery of the neutron, was used to group some hadrons together into &quot;multiplets&quot; but no successful scientific theory as yet covered the hadrons as a whole. This was the beginning of a chaotic period in particle physics that has become known as the &quot;particle zoo&quot; era. The eightfold way represented a step out of this confusion and towards the quark model, which proved to be the solution.

==Organization==
Group representation theory is the mathematical underpinning of the eightfold way, but that rather technical mathematics is not needed to understand how it helps organize particles. Particles are sorted into groups as mesons or baryons. Within each group, they are further separated by their spin angular momentum. Symmetrical patterns appear when these groups of particles have their strangeness plotted against their electric charge. (This is the most common way to make these plots today, but originally physicists used an equivalent pair of properties called &quot;hypercharge&quot; and &quot;isotopic spin&quot;, the latter of which is now known as &quot;isospin&quot;.) The symmetry in these patterns is a hint of the underlying symmetry of the strong interaction between the particles themselves. In the plots below, points representing particles that lie along the same horizontal line share the same strangeness, , while those on the same left-leaning diagonals share the same electric charge, (given as multiples of the elementary charge).

===Mesons===
In the original eightfold way, the mesons were organized into octets and singlets. This is one of the finer points of differences between the eightfold way and the quark model it inspired, which suggests the mesons should be grouped into nonets (groups of nine).

====Meson octet====

The eightfold way organizes eight of the lowest spin-0 mesons into an octet. They are:

*, , and kaons

Diametrically opposite particles in the diagram are anti-particles of one another, while particles in the center are their own anti-particle.

====Meson singlet====
The chargeless, strangeless eta prime meson was originally classified by itself as a singlet:

Under the quark model later developed, it is better viewed as part of a meson nonet, as previously mentioned.

===Baryons===

====Baryon octet====

The eightfold way organizes the spin- baryons into an octet. They consist of

====Baryon decuplet====

The organizational principles of the eightfold way also apply to the spin- baryons, forming a decuplet.
*, , , and delta baryons
*, , and sigma baryons
* and xi baryons
* omega baryon

However, one of the particles of this decuplet had never been previously observed when the eightfold way was proposed. Gell-Mann called this particle the and predicted in 1962 that it would have a strangeness −3, electric charge −1 and a mass near . In 1964, a particle closely matching these predictions was discovered by a particle accelerator group at Brookhaven. Gell-Mann received the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the theory of elementary particles.

==Historical development==

===Development===

Historically, quarks were motivated by an understanding of flavour symmetry. First, it was noticed (1961) that groups of particles were related to each other in a way that matched the representation theory of SU(3). From that, it was inferred that there is an approximate symmetry of the universe which is represented by the group SU(3). Finally (1964), this led to the discovery of three light quarks (up, down, and strange) interchanged by these SU(3) transformations.

===Modern interpretation===

The eightfold way may be understood in modern terms as a consequence of flavor symmetries between various kinds of quarks. Since the strong nuclear force affects quarks the same way regardless of their flavor, replacing one flavor of quark with another in a hadron should not alter its mass very much, provided the respective quark masses are smaller than the strong interaction scale—which holds for the three light quarks. Mathematically, this replacement may be described by elements of the SU(3) group. The octets and other hadron arrangements are representations of this group.

==Flavor symmetry==
===SU(3)===

There is an abstract three-dimensional vector space:

formula_1

and the laws of physics are &quot;approximately&quot; invariant under a determinant 1 unitary transformation to this space (sometimes called a &quot;flavour rotation&quot;):

formula_2

Here, SU(3) refers to the Lie group of 3×3 unitary matrices with determinant 1 (special unitary group). For example, the flavour rotation

formula_3

is a transformation that simultaneously turns all the up quarks in the universe into down quarks and vice versa. More specifically, these flavour rotations are exact symmetries if &quot;only&quot; strong force interactions are looked at, but they are not truly exact symmetries of the universe because the three quarks have different masses and different electroweak interactions.

This approximate symmetry is called &quot;flavour symmetry&quot;, or more specifically &quot;flavour SU(3) symmetry&quot;.
===Connection to representation theory===

Assume we have a certain particle—for example, a proton—in a quantum state formula_4. If we apply one of the flavour rotations &quot;A&quot; to our particle, it enters a new quantum state which we can call formula_5. Depending on &quot;A&quot;, this new state might be a proton, or a neutron, or a superposition of a proton and a neutron, or various other possibilities. The set of all possible quantum states spans a vector space.

Representation theory is a mathematical theory that describes the situation where elements of a group (here, the flavour rotations &quot;A&quot; in the group SU(3)) are automorphisms of a vector space (here, the set of all possible quantum states that you get from flavour-rotating a proton). Therefore, by studying the representation theory of SU(3), we can learn the possibilities for what the vector space is and how it is affected by flavour symmetry.

Since the flavour rotations &quot;A&quot; are approximate, not exact, symmetries, each orthogonal state in the vector space corresponds to a different particle species. In the example above, when a proton is transformed by every possible flavour rotation &quot;A&quot;, it turns out that it moves around an 8 dimensional vector space. Those 8 dimensions correspond to the 8 particles in the so-called &quot;baryon octet&quot; (proton, neutron, , ,, ,, ). This corresponds to an 8-dimensional (&quot;octet&quot;) representation of the group SU(3). Since &quot;A&quot; is an approximate symmetry, all the particles in this octet have similar mass.

Every Lie group has a corresponding Lie algebra, and each group representation of the Lie group can be mapped to a corresponding Lie algebra representation on the same vector space. The Lie algebra formula_6(3) can be written as the set of 3×3 traceless Hermitian matrices. Physicists generally discuss the representation theory of the Lie algebra formula_6(3) instead of the Lie group SU(3), since the former is simpler and the two are ultimately equivalent.

<text>Rick Jore (born December 21, 1956) is an American politician and businessman who served as a member of the Montana House of Representatives from 1995 to 2001 and 2007 to 2009.

== Early life and education ==
Jore was born and raised in Ronan, Montana, and received his associate degree from North Idaho College in 1978.

== Career ==
He is also the owner of Westslope Trout Company and the vice chairman of the Constitution Party of Montana. Jore spent 10 years working in a lumber mill.

First elected as a Republican in 1994, Jore served three terms in the Montana House of Representatives before switching his affiliation to the Constitution Party in March 2000. Jore ran again for the legislature in 2000 and 2002 as a Constitution Party candidate and was narrowly defeated in both attempts. A very narrow defeat in 2004, after a recount, was followed by a successful run in 2006, defeating his Democratic opponent 2,045 to 1,643 votes.

===2004 election===
In the very close 2004 election, following a recount, Jore initially tied with Democratic nominee Jeanne Windham, with each receiving 1,559 votes (Republican Jack Cross received 1,107 votes) in state House District 12.

Because there was a tie, under Montana law the outgoing Republican Governor Judy Martz, was entitled to choose the winner, and she selected Jore—which gave the Republicans a 50-49 lead over Democrats in the state House, with Jore as the only Constitution Party member.

The matter went to the state courts, and in December 2004, the Montana Supreme Court issued its initial ruling, finding in a 6-1 decision that &quot;one or more&quot; of seven contested ballots for Jore were invalid. The decision meant that Windham was elected to office, which in turn created a tie in the state House, which was evenly split (50-50) between Republicans and Democrats in the House. Because the incoming governor, Brian Schweitzer, was a Democrat, this meant that the new state House speaker would be a Democrat. The Court&#x27;s written opinion was issued March 18, 2005.

===2006 election===
In the next election, Jore had a rematch with Jeanne Windham. This time, Jore won with 55.4% of the vote. With Republicans controlling the Montana House by a slim margin of 50-49, Jore obtained an unexpected amount of political leverage and was appointed chairman of the House Education Committee.

===2008 election===
Since Jore had already served in the Montana House as a Republican before his 2006 election as a member of the Constitution Party of Montana, state term-limit laws barred him from running for the Montana House in 2008. He attempted to qualify an initiative for the ballot, called the Personhood Amendment, but failed to gather enough signatures. As of March 19, 2009, he was still serving as the vice chairman of the Constitution Party of Montana.

==Political positions==
Jore has been described as a &quot;no-compromise conservative&quot; and as one of the most conservative legislators in Montana. Jore supports an &quot;original intent&quot; approach to interpreting the U.S. Constitution, stating that &quot;The concept of a living constitution is in my mind an absolute perversion.&quot;

Jore has authored bills that call for eliminating state laws requiring compulsory school attendance, outlawing affirmative action and abandoning Montana&#x27;s no-fault divorce laws by requiring a judge to publicly declare who is to blame for the breakup and imposing a financial penalty. Other bills that Jore has authored would end the state inheritance tax, phase in a 20 percent reduction in individual income taxes, terminate the state-tribal hunting and fishing agreement on the Flathead Indian Reservation, and a right-to-work state by prohibiting payment of union dues as a condition of employment.

== Personal life ==
He and his wife homeschooled their five children.

<text>Planet Ark Environmental Foundation is an Australian non-profit environmental organization founded in 1992. Planet Ark aims to partner with organizations in the public and private sectors to help find ways to reduce impact on planet Earth. The focus areas are the environmental impacts of human consumption in the home, the workplace, and the community. Planet Ark&#x27;s campaigns include &#x27;Cartridges 4 Planet Ark&#x27;, Australia&#x27;s &#x27;National Recycling Week&#x27;, and the country&#x27;s biggest annual community tree planting event, National Tree Day. The organization operates from its office in Sydney.

== History ==
Ark Australia was founded in 1992 by Paul Klymenko, Peter Shenstone, and former Ark UK member Jon Dee. At the time, curbside recycling was in its infancy, and environmental information was very limited. The organization was commissioned to create 300 &quot;Save the Planet&quot; videos involving high profile celebrities and soon became known as Planet Ark. Several major events are organized by Planet Ark, including National Tree Day, founded in 1996 with Olivia Newton-John; National Recycling Week; and the Schools Recycle Right Challenge. The organization began many high profile campaigns that have since either moved to other providers or become staples of the public recycling sphere, including &#x27;Cards 4 Planet Ark&#x27;, &#x27;Phones for Planet Ark&#x27;, Steel Can and Aluminum Can (Al Cans) recycling. To demonstrate that cleaning products could be as effective without a heavy chemical composition, Planet Ark released the Aware Laundry Powder range in 1994. This was soon followed by 100% recycled toilet tissue.

== Campaigns ==
Planet Ark&#x27;s campaigns seek to promote positive action that directly changes people&#x27;s behavior. The organization intends to be non-political and non-confrontational, aiming to unite people and business in action. Planet Ark&#x27;s main objectives are to promote sustainable resource use, encourage low carbon lifestyles, and connect people with nature. Planet Ark works with businesses and endorses a number of commercial products it considers to be environmentally friendly in production and manufacture, including recycled toilet paper, cleaning products, and car tires.

Planet Ark&#x27;s campaigns include:
* National Tree Day is Australia&#x27;s largest tree-planting and nature care event. 2014 was the biggest year in the event&#x27;s history, with more than 4,000 sites and events and almost 300,000 people taking part, with similar numbers participating every year.
* National Recycling Week is the annual opportunity for Australian schools, workplaces, councils, and the public to focus on the benefits of recycling. In 2013, more than 70,000 children participated in the Schools Recycling Right Challenge.
* Cartridges 4 Planet Ark is a partnership between Planet Ark, the recycling center Close the Loop and six of the largest cartridge manufacturers – Brother, Canon, Epson, HP, Konica Minolta and Kyocera. By 2017 more than 30 million cartridges had been diverted from landfill with zero waste to landfill.
* BusinessRecycling.com.au is designed to make recycling at work easy. The site lists recycling services for more than 90 different materials ranging from aluminum can to fly ash and from packaging to batteries. The site is made possible through support of the NSW EPA.
* RecyclingNearYou.com.au is a comprehensive directory of the recycling services offered by more than 500 councils around Australia. Each year millions of enquiries are made to the site covering items that can go in their home recycling to those items that must be recycled through dedicated schemes.
* Make it Australian Recycled was launched in partnership with Australian Paper to promote the practice of purchasing consumer goods made from recycled materials to Australians.
* Make it Wood is designed to encourage individuals and businesses to use responsibility sourced wood as a building material.
* The Australasian Recycling Label was developed by Planet Ark and Green Chip with the Australian Packaging Covenant Organization to create a standardized labeling system to allow consumers to make better decisions about packaging recyclability.

== Celebrity supporters ==
Celebrities who have fronted Planet Ark campaigns include Pierce Brosnan, Kamahl, Olivia Newton-John, Jamie Durie, Steve Irwin, Kylie Minogue, Dannii Minogue, Nicole Kidman, Tom Cruise, Shelley Craft, Richard Branson, and TV personality Tim Webster. Current ambassadors include surfer Layne Beachley, TV personality James Treble, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Gardening Australia&quot; host Costa Georgiadis, &quot;Grand Designs Australia&quot; host Peter Maddison, author Anita Van Dyke, Dr. Amanda Lloyd, Magdalena Roze, Ranger Stacey, Candice Dixon, and children&#x27;s sensation dirtgirlworld.

Planet Ark&#x27;s official spokesperson is environmentalist Rebecca Gilling.

== Criticism ==
Planet Ark&#x27;s carbon capture and sustainable building materials campaign &#x27;Make it Wood&#x27; was criticized by Jon Dee and Pat Cash who appeared on television to complain about the links to the timber industry and involvement in drafting the Australian Forestry Standard. which Nick Xenophon has said &quot;raises some serious questions of a potential conflict of interest&quot; and caused Christine Milne to criticize the organization. Planet Ark responded to the enquiries in a letter explaining its position in detail. The Australian Forestry Standard is an attempt to create an Australian specific standard, as opposed to the international Forest Stewardship Council and Planet Ark recommends choosing FSC wood products.

<doc id="1185771" wikidata="Q3611150" url="?curid=1185771" title="Alfonso Caruana">
<text>Alfonso Caruana (; born 1 January 1946) is an Italian-Canadian crime boss and member of the Sicilian Mafia who was the head of the Sicilian Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan&#x27;s branch in Canada.

In 1997, he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; in Italy, on several charges, to nearly 22 years in prison. In 1998, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) amassed enough evidence, and Caruana was arrested at his Woodbridge, Ontario, home. In 2000, he was sentenced to 18 years in prison by the Ontario Superior Court, but in 2008, was extradited to Italy to serve his sentence.

==Early life==

Caruana was born in Castelvetrano in the province of Trapani, Sicily. His family originated from Siculiana in the province of Agrigento and is closely related to the Cuntrera family through several marriages. Alfonso Caruana married his niece Giuseppina Caruana and has a son and two daughters.

==Mafia career==

In 1968, Alfonso Caruana arrived in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with $100 in his pocket pretending to be an electrician. Ten years later, he was stopped at the international airport of Zürich, Switzerland with $600,000 in a suitcase. He was released after paying a fee.

When the Caruanas and Cuntreras moved to Montreal in the mid-1960s, they became affiliated with Nicolo Rizzuto and his son, Vito Rizzuto. They began to work together in drug trafficking activities.

In the 1970s, Caruana, together with his brothers Gerlando Caruana and Pasquale Caruana left Montreal for Caracas in Venezuela due to the conflict with the Cotroni crime family. In 1978, Cotroni family boss Paolo Violi was killed, and they returned to Canada; the Rizzuto crime family subsequently took over. Caruana also acquired Canadian citizenship in 1978.

At the beginning of the 1980s, Alfonso established himself near Lugano in a luxurious villa, supervising the laundering of the proceeds of heroin-trafficking. The funds were deposited in Canadian banks and channelled through Swiss bank accounts. Two years later he moved to the stockbroker belt near London. From his £450,000 mansion, he supervised a heroin pipeline from Thailand, through England, to Canada. His partner in the UK was Francesco Di Carlo. Caruana went to Thailand to set up the route. When the pipeline was dismantled in England in 1985, he managed to escape arrest, moving back to a Montreal suburb where he opened a pizzeria. Alfonso prepared the pizzas while his wife tended the pay-desk.

According to Di Carlo, who became a &quot;pentito&quot; (state witness) in 1996, Caruana was sentenced to death by Sicilian Mafia Commission in the early stages of the Second Mafia War. His brother Leonardo was killed on 2 September 1981 on the order of Totò Riina. Di Carlo was ordered to carry out the killing of Alfonso Caruana and Pasquale Cuntrera, but refused, which resulted in Di Carlo&#x27;s suspension from the organization.

===Cocaine trafficker===

Meanwhile, Caruana organised a network that smuggled eleven metric tonnes of cocaine to Italy from 1991 until 1994. Caruana brought together the cocaine producers of the Colombian cartels with the Italian distributors, six &#x27;Ndrangheta families from Calabria. At the time, the Cuntrera-Caruana family was labelled as &quot;the fly-wheel of the drug trade and the indispensable link between suppliers and distributors&quot;.

The investigation, code-named Operation Cartagine, started when the police seized 5,497 kilos of cocaine (a European record at the time) in March 1994 in Turin. A year later, the Turin Prosecutors Office presented the indictment. The operation neutralized the most important supply line of narcotics to Europe, investigators claimed.

===Later years and convictions===

In March 1995, Caruana filed for bankruptcy after declaring $250 worth of assets following a notice of assessment from Revenue Canada to pay $8.6 million in unpaid taxes, plus accrued interest and various penalties accounting for $21.2 million. In early 1997, Revenue Canada took him to Quebec Superior Court in Montreal to challenge his bankruptcy claims. Caruana claimed to be a carwash attendant who made $400 per week, however, had Swiss bank accounts in his name, of which $21 million was moved through; he claimed most of the money belonged to his uncle Pasquale Cuntrera. Revenue Canada was unsuccessful in recovering the amounts due, as Caruana was officially bankrupt on paper; he was ordered to pay a mere $90,000 over a three-year period.

Caruana was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; on 30 July 1997, by the Palermo court of appeal to 21 years and 10 months for Mafia association, conspiracy to traffic narcotics and aggravated importing, possession and sale of large quantities of narcotics for his involvement in heroin trafficking in the 1980s. At the same time, he was prosecuted in Turin for cocaine trafficking in the 1990s. The Palermo court concluded that the network was &quot;a further indication of the high criminal capability&quot; of Caruana who had &quot;escaped every judicial initiative during the last decades and succeeded in reaching the top of the international drug trade, adjusting his criminal contacts and showing such skill that he is to be considered as one of the most important exponents in this sector.&quot;

In July 1998, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) amassed enough evidence from surveillance and wiretaps on Caruana&#x27;s home through Project Omerta, he was arrested at his Woodbridge, Ontario home, where police also found large amounts of hidden cash and jewellery.

According to police, he controlled one of the largest drug-dealing networks in the world. The officer in charge of the investigation, RCMP Chief Superintendent Ben Soave, said: &quot;If organized crime were a hockey game, Mr. Caruana would be [Wayne] Gretzky.&quot; In February 2000, after associate Oreste Pagano testified against Caruana, Caruana pleaded guilty to charges of importing and trafficking narcotics, and was sentenced to 18 years in prison by the Ontario Superior Court. Alfonso&#x27;s brothers, Pasquale and Gerlando Caruana were also arrested in the Project, receiving 10 and 18-year prison sentences respectively. In July 2004, Caruana was denied bail.

In June 2007, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that Caruana be extradited to Italy to face prison time. On 20 December 2007, Caruana&#x27;s efforts to appeal were dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada, and was extradited to Italy on 29 January 2008, to serve a nearly 22-year prison sentence.

In 2019, Caruana was convicted of running a cocaine trafficking and money laundering empire between Italy and North America, and after the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed his appeal in November 2020, he faces an additional 17 years in prison.

<text>The Ross 930 is a class of fast cruiser-racer yachts named after its designer, New Zealander Murray Ross. The design is marked by light weight and moderate sail area, with a sail-area-to-displacement (SA/D) ratio of about 24, and displacement-to-length (D/L) ratio of 98. The bow section is quite narrow, providing relatively low wave-making resistance and reducing pounding while sailing upwind in waves, and the stern section is wide and flat, making the boat easy to control sailing fast downwind. The interior of the Ross 930 is comfortable, including (and requiring for racing) fitted berths for five, a two-burner stove, galley with sink, and a head. The standard engine is an outboard in a well (this must not be removed for racing), but a few boats were built with small inboard diesel engines.

The prototype was launched in New Zealand in 1982, and since then, over 50 boats have been built to this design.

A few were imported into the US in the mid-80&#x27;s, and several now reside in the Pacific Northwest region. The boat is fractionally rigged, with a conventional spinnaker pole and symmetric spinnaker. An unusual feature of the rig, required for class racing, is that the jib is sheeted to a self-tacking traveler car. The Ross 930 has a PHRF rating between 96 and 120, depending on region.

==Ross 930 Modified==
Some Ross 930s have been modified to increase their performance down wind, with a prod (sometimes articulating) and gennakers. A common trend is to also fit a mast head spinnaker halyard so mast head spinnakers and gennakers can be hoisted.

In order to control these more powerful sails, heavier and deeper keels must also be fitted. This will also increase the boat&#x27;s heavy weather upwind performance. The mast loading is also considerably increased so carbon fibre masts are becoming common place among modified 930s too.

With the use of gennakers and the heavier keels, speeds in excess 20 knots can easily be sustained for long periods of time with the correct wind angle and strength

A &#x27;Box&#x27; rule is under development for the Ross 930 Modified so that these can be run as their own class alongside the standard 930 fleet, as currently these boats are sailed as a sort of &quot;outlaw&quot; class.

<doc id="1185786" wikidata="Q1377468" url="?curid=1185786" title="Paul Prudhomme">
<text>Paul Prudhomme (July 13, 1940 – October 8, 2015), also known as Gene Autry Prudhomme, was an American celebrity chef whose specialties were Creole and Cajun cuisines, which he was also credited with popularizing. He was the chef proprietor of K-Paul&#x27;s Louisiana Kitchen in New Orleans, and had formerly owned and run several other restaurants. He developed several culinary products, including hot sauce and seasoning mixes, and wrote 11 cookbooks.

==Early life==
The youngest of 13 children born to Eli Prudhomme, Jr. and Hazel Reed, Prudhomme was raised on a farm near Opelousas, the seat of Saint Landry Parish, Louisiana. His father was a farmer, who struggled financially during Prudhomme&#x27;s childhood, and his mother was a creative cook.

Previously named after Saint Paul, as chosen by a Catholic priest, Prudhomme adopted the pseudonym &quot;Gene Autry Prudhomme&quot; during his youth.

His maternal ancestors include early Acadian settlers Martin Aucoin (c. 1651 – 1711) and Marie Gaudet (c. 1657 – 1734).

==Career==
Prudhomme opened his first restaurant in Opelousas in 1957, a hamburger restaurant called Big Daddy O&#x27;s Patio. The restaurant went out of business in nine months, during which time his first marriage also ended. He became a magazine seller initially in New Orleans, and afterward several restaurant jobs took him around the country. During this period he began creating his own spice mixes and giving them away to customers. In 1970, he moved back to New Orleans to work as a sous chef at Le Pavillon Hotel. He soon left to open Clarence Dupuy&#x27;s restaurant Maison du Puy. While there, he met his second wife, Kay Hinrichs, who worked at the restaurant as a waitress. In 1975, Prudhomme left to become the first American-born executive chef at Commander&#x27;s Palace under Richard Brennan, Sr. Chef Paul turned the Garden District restaurant into a world-class destination.

In 1979, Prudhomme and Kay opened K-Paul&#x27;s Louisiana Kitchen in the French Quarter of New Orleans. The restaurant was named as a portmanteau of their names, with Paul working as head chef and Kay as restaurant manager. For a while he attempted to operate the restaurant while still working at Commander&#x27;s Palace, but the demand in his new restaurant was such that he moved to work there full-time, while also appointing Emeril Lagasse to take over as executive chef at Commanders Palace. In 1980, Prudhomme was made a Chevalier (Knight) of the French Ordre National du Mérite Agricole in honor of his work with Cajun and Creole cuisines.

His cookbook, &quot;Paul Prudhomme&#x27;s Louisiana Kitchen&quot;, was published by William Morrow and Company in 1984. It was given a Culinary Classic Book Award in 1989 by the International Association of Culinary Professionals. Prudhomme has been credited with having popularized cajun cuisine and in particular blackened redfish during the 1980s. The popularity of the fish was such that commercial fishing of the species was restricted to prevent its extinction. Prudhomme was also credited with introducing the turducken into American cuisine.

During a summer residence in New York City in 1985, Prudhomme&#x27;s pop-up restaurant was reported to the Board of Health, which visited the restaurant and closed it before it opened, reporting 29 violations of the city&#x27;s health code. Prudhomme ignored the order and opened the restaurant anyway, resulting in the Board of Health threatening him with jail time if he continued to operate the restaurant. The city&#x27;s mayor Ed Koch appeared with Prudhomme at the restaurant to declare an end to what the media reported as the &quot;gumbo war&quot;. The restaurant was quite successful during the five weeks it was open, with lines sometimes reaching four blocks long. Four years later, Prudhomme opened a permanent restaurant in New York City at 622 Broadway, which had queues of up to two hours.

In 1992, he was charged with possession of a weapon while trying to board a plane at Baltimore/Washington International Airport after leaving a loaded revolver in his carry-on luggage. He later released a press statement saying that he had forgotten it was in the bag.

He made a guest appearance at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, France, in October 1994.

In 2004, he traveled to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, along with of food and seasonings to cook for the troops stationed there.

Following Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, Prudhomme was forced to close his restaurant. During the restoration efforts, he cooked for free at a relief center for the military and residents staying in the French Quarter; at one point his team cooked over 6,000 meals in ten days. He reopened the restaurant during the following October; the premises were not extensively damaged by the storm. &quot;Bon Appétit&quot; awarded Prudhomme their Humanitarian Award in 2006 for his efforts following the hurricane.

After his death in 2015, Prudhomme&#x27;s personal library of nearly 600 cookbooks, food reference books and technical books on food science was donated to the John and Bonnie Boyd Hospitality and Culinary Library, which is affiliated with the Southern Food and Beverage Museum.

===Product lines===
Along with being a chef, Prudhomme launched a range of products called Chef Paul Prudhomme Magic Seasoning Blends. The line includes his signature blackened redfish seasonings. The products are sold throughout the U.S. and in over 30 countries worldwide. In 1986, he released two volumes of a &quot;video cookbook&quot; on VHS titled &quot;Chef Paul Prudhomme&#x27;s Louisiana Kitchen&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1986, Prudhomme&#x27;s wife, Kay, was diagnosed with lung cancer. She died seven years later on December 31, 1993.

One of his students was Aaron Sanchez, who moved from New York to become an apprentice when Sanchez was 16.

Prudhomme had a long-running issue with his weight, resulting in his working from an electric wheelchair on occasion. In order to lose weight, he wrote his 1993 cookbook, &quot;Chef Paul Prudhomme&#x27;s Fork in the Road&quot;. He deliberately avoided marketing it as a low-fat cookbook in order to prevent customers from being put off by the premise after testing the recipes at K-Paul&#x27;s Kitchen in New Orleans.

In March 2008, Prudhomme was grazed by a .22-caliber stray bullet while catering the Zurich Classic of New Orleans golf tournament. He at first thought a bee had stung his arm, required no serious medical attention and within five minutes was back to cooking for the golf tournament. It was thought to have been a falling bullet.

Prudhomme died in New Orleans on October 8, 2015, after a brief illness. He was 75.

<doc id="1185790" wikidata="Q7624514" url="?curid=1185790" title="Strong RSA assumption">
<text>In cryptography, the strong [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] assumption states that the RSA problem is intractable even when the solver is allowed to choose the public exponent &quot;e&quot; (for &quot;e&quot; ≥ 3). More specifically, given a modulus &quot;N&quot; of unknown factorization, and a ciphertext &quot;C&quot;, it is infeasible to find any pair (&quot;M&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) such that &quot;C&quot; ≡ &quot;M&quot; &quot;e&quot; mod &quot;N&quot;.

The strong RSA assumption was first used for constructing signature schemes provably secure against existential forgery without resorting to the random oracle model.

<doc id="1185797" wikidata="Q595439" url="?curid=1185797" title="Santa Monica Pier">
<text>The Santa Monica Pier is a large pier at the foot of Colorado Avenue in Santa Monica, California, United States. It contains a small amusement park, concession stands, and areas for views and fishing. The pier is part of the greater Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

==Attractions==
===Pacific Park===

The pier contains Pacific Park, a family amusement park with its solar panelled Ferris wheel. The brightly lit wheel can be seen from a distance and has been turned off during the Earth Hour observance.

===Other attractions===
It also has an original carousel hippodrome from the 1920s, the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium operated by Heal the Bay, shops, entertainers, a video arcade, a trapeze school, pubs, and restaurants. The pier&#x27;s west end is a popular location for anglers.

The pier is a venue for outdoor concerts, movies, and other activities.

==History==



Santa Monica has had several piers; however, the current Santa Monica Pier is made up of two adjoining piers that long had separate owners. The long, narrow Municipal Pier opened September 9, 1909, primarily to carry sewer pipes beyond the breakers and had no amenities. The short, wide adjoining Pleasure Pier to the south, also known as Newcomb Pier, was built in 1916 by Charles I. D. Looff and his son Arthur, amusement park pioneers. Attractions on the Pleasure Pier eventually included the Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome building (which now houses the current carousel and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places), the Blue Streak Racer wooden roller coaster (which was purchased from the defunct Wonderland amusement park in San Diego), the Whip, merry-go-rounds, Wurlitzer organs, and a funhouse.

The Philadelphia Toboggan Company built the Carousel, PTC #62, in 1922. It features 44 hand-carved horses. It was rebuilt in 1990 inside the Hippodrome. A calliope provides musical accompaniment.

The La Monica Ballroom opened on July 23, 1924. Designed by T. S. Eslick with a Spanish façade and French Renaissance interior, it was the largest dance hall on the west coast, accommodating 5,000 dancers on its hard maple floor. Country music star Spade Cooley began broadcasting his weekly television show from the ballroom in 1948, where the program remained until 1954. In the summer of 1955, the Hollywood Autocade opened at the La Monica with one-hundred famous and unusual cars, including Jack Benny&#x27;s Maxwell and a Rumpler Drop Car. From 1955 until 1962, the ballroom served as a roller skating rink; first as Skater&#x27;s Ballroom, and later as the Santa Monica Roller Rink, where the speed skating club won many state and regional championships and later Champion speed skater Ronnie Rains become a Roller Derby star. The rinks operator was Jack Goodrich who was a former vaudeville and silent film star. The operators daughter Michelle Goodrich later became a showgirl in the Ice Capades. The La Monica Ballroom was demolished in 1963 as a result of the Newcomb family waiting too long to start repairs.

The Pleasure Pier thrived during the 1920s but faded during the Great Depression. During the 1930s, most of the amusement park facilities were closed down and its attractions sold off. A breakwater was built in 1934 that provided docking for up to 100 fishing and pleasure boats near the pier.

The bridge and entry gate to Santa Monica Pier were built in 1938 by the federal Works Project Administration, and replaced the former grade connection.

The Newcomb Pier was privately owned until it was acquired by the city in 1974. During the 1960s and 1970s, various plans were proposed that would entail removal of the pier. The most extensive included the construction of an artificial island with a 1,500-room hotel. It was approved by the City Council, but citizens formed &quot;Save Santa Monica Bay&quot; to preserve the pier. The order to raze the pier was revoked by the city council in 1973. Within that same year, the Carousel and Hippodrome were locations for the film &quot;The Sting&quot;.

Storms swept away the protective breakwater in 1982. During storms in early 1983, the pier experienced a significant loss. On January 27, there were reported swells of 10-feet during this winter storm. When the storm was over, the lower deck of the pier was destroyed. The City of Santa Monica began repairs on March 1, 1983, when another storm rolled in. A crane which was being used to repair the west end was dragged into the water and acted as a battering ram against the pilings. Over one-third of the Pier was destroyed. On May 25, 1996, The Santa Monica Pier welcomed its newest attraction Pacific Park. Pacific Park was the first new attraction since the 1930s. Construction began on December 2, 1994 and ended in February, 1996. 

On June 18, 2009, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment issued a safe eating advisory for any fish caught from Santa Monica Pier to Ventura Harbor due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs.

On October 9, 2023, part of the pier was forced to evacuate after a man who claiming to have a bomb climbed onto the Ferris wheel at Pacific Park. He was then arrested and taken into custody.

==Management==
The City of Santa Monica created a non-profit in response to the damage and called it Santa Monica Pier Restoration Corporation (SMPRC). SMPRC is headquartered Hippodromes second floor, with former apartments being converted into offices, and conducted the daily operations of the Santa Monica Pier, such as managing events, filming, promotions, tenants, and street performers. SMPRC has produced the Santa Monica Pier Paddle Board Race and the Twilight Summer Concert Series. Also, in 2011, SMPRC changed the company name to the Santa Monica Pier Corporation (SMPC).

==In popular culture==
===Books===
In the popular book series &quot;The Dark Artifices&quot; by Cassandra Clare, the fictional Los Angeles Institute overlooks the Santa Monica Pier. Most of the major plot is set in this vicinity.

===Songs===
*Kay Kyser&#x27;s Campus Cowboys - &quot;When Veronica Plays the Harmonica (On the Pier at Santa Monica)&quot; (1946)
*Noel Harrison - &quot;Santa Monica Pier&quot; (1968)
*The Beach Boys - &quot;Strange World&quot; (2012)
*Hayley Kiyoko - &quot;Curious&quot;

===Films===
The Santa Monica Pier lies within the studio zone; consequently, it has been used as a filming location for many decades. The amusement park attractions as they existed in 1930s are seen prominently in the &quot;Our Gang&quot; short &quot;Fish Hooky&quot; (1933). It also appears prominently in &quot;Tillie&#x27;s Punctured Romance&quot; (1914), &quot;Quicksand&quot; (1950), &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; (1960), &quot;1941&quot; (1979 film), &quot;The Opposite of Sex&quot; (1998), &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969), &quot;Night Tide&quot; (1961), &quot;Bean&quot; (1997), &quot;The Sting&quot; (1973), &quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; (1975) with Robert Mitchum, &quot;Her&quot; (2013), &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot; (1998), &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; (1998), &quot;Miracle Beach&quot;, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (there is a Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant on the pier), &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Desperate Teenage Lovedolls&quot;, &quot;Dark Ride&quot;, &quot;Cellular&quot;, &quot;The Hottie and the Nottie&quot;, &quot;Falling Down&quot;, &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (the pier is the site of the movie&#x27;s climactic final scene), &quot;Love Stinks&quot;, &quot;Hancock&quot;, &quot;The Happytime Murders&quot;, &quot;Sharknado&quot;, the indie romantic comedy &quot;She Wants Me&quot;, and &quot;Hannah Montana: The Movie&quot; (the scene with Lilly&#x27;s birthday party). During the earthquake in the movie &quot;2012&quot;, the pier can be seen sinking beneath the waves. The Natalie Wood film &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; (1965) features the pier in the beginning of the picture. The pier was also featured in the 2012 film version of &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;. &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot; with Jimmy Stewart has a sequence toward the beginning where he goes to the La Monica Ballroom for an audition. The pier is also featured in the 2018 film &quot;Pacific Rim Uprising&quot;, starring John Boyega, where a kaiju attack destroys the pier (as well as the entire city). Jack Dawson in &quot;Titanic&quot; references the pier, which would have been just three years old in 1912, when the ship sank.

<text>Pierre Certon (ca. 1510–1520 – 23 February 1572) was a French composer of the Renaissance. He was a representative of the generation after Josquin and Mouton, and was influential in the late development of the French chanson.

==Life==
Most likely he was born in Melun, but he lived most of his life in Paris. The earliest records of his life date from 1527, when he was in the service of the king. In 1530 he was charged with playing ball at Notre Dame Cathedral as well as refusing to go to a service, both dangerous irreverences that almost cost him prison time—but he was young enough to be forgiven. From this event a birthdate between 1510 and 1520 can be inferred. In 1536 he became a master of choristers at the Sainte-Chapelle (choir), and he remained at this post, with a few additional benefices, for the rest of his life.

Another post he held late in his life – concurrently with his activity in Paris – was as canon at the cathedral in Melun. He seems to have helped organize many grand entertainments, and doubtless composed many of his works for them. Most likely he was a close friend of the more famous composer Claudin de Sermisy, as evidenced by his dedications, notes, and the poignant lament he wrote for his death in 1562, which was closely modeled on the similar work by Josquin for the death of Johannes Ockeghem.

==Music and influence==
Certon wrote eight masses that survive, motets, psalm settings, &quot;chansons spirituelle&quot; (chansons with religious texts, related to the Italian &quot;madrigali spirituali&quot;), and numerous secular chansons. His style is relatively typical of mid-century composers, except that he was unusually attentive to large-scale form, for example framing longer masses (such as his &quot;Requiem&quot;) with very simple movements, with the inner movements showing greater tension and complexity. In addition he was skilled at varying texture between homophonic and polyphonic passages, and often changing the number and register of voices singing at any time.

His chanson settings were famous, and influential in assisting the transformation of the chanson from the previous light, dance-like, four-part texture to the late-century style of careful text setting, emotionalism, greater vocal range, and larger number of voices. Cross-influence with the contemporary Italian form of the madrigal was obvious, but chansons such as those by Certon retained a lightness and a rhythmic element characteristic of the French language itself.

<text>Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP () (KMEP) is a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, Inc. The company, which is classified as an oil and gas master limited partnership (MLP), owns or operates petroleum product, natural gas, and carbon dioxide pipelines, related storage facilities, terminals, power plants and retail natural gas in the United States and Canada. 

== History ==
Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, headquartered at One Allen Center in Houston, Texas, was co-founded by Richard Kinder and William Morgan. The company began in 1997, when Kinder, a former Enron executive, and Morgan purchased the liquid pipeline assets of Enron for $40 million. It has since employed many former Enron employees, including former Enron whistleblower Jordan Mintz. 

Kinder Morgan is credited for bucking the trend in MLPs that traditionally deliver low double-digit total return to investors. It has produced a 26 percent compound growth rate from its founding to May 2009.

On March 1, 2002, Shares of Kinder Morgan Inc., fell to a 15-month low on concern that the company faced competition for assets and on investor wariness about its partnership arrangements. On March 1, 2002, Nova Chemicals Corp. sold its 20-per-cent share of the Cochin pipeline, and the sale, for $64 million (U.S.), is subject to right of first refusal by the other Cochin owners, which include subsidiaries of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP.

In May 2013, the company acquired Copano Energy LLC (NASDAQ:CPNO, closed), which is now assigned under the company&#x27;s Natural Gas Pipeline section as well as under Product Pipeline section. On August 10, 2014, Kinder Morgan announced it was moving to full ownership of along with two other partly owned companies, Kinder Morgan Management, and El Paso Pipeline Partners, in a deal worth $71 billion. Kinder Morgan announced its completion of the acquisition on November 26, 2014. The combined entity became the largest midstream energy company in North America.

==Regulatory oversight==
The majority of its pipelines fall under the regulatory oversight of the U.S. Department of Transportation. The company maintains a safety record and follows many regulations and procedures to monitor and ensure the integrity of its pipelines, despite involvement in numerous accidents as outlined below. Interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to the rate and facility regulation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under the Natural Gas Act.

== Facilities ==

* Calnev Pipeline (Hazardous Liquids)
* Central Florida Pipeline (Hazardous Liquids)
* Cypress Pipeline System (Hazardous Liquids)
* Plantation Pipe Line (Hazardous Liquids)
* Portland Jet Line
* Rockies Express-West Pipeline (Gas Transmission)

==Accidents==

Pipelines operated by this company have failed throughout the United States.

===Suisun Marsh diesel spill===
On April 28, 2004, a petroleum pipeline owned and operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ruptured, spilling an estimated 1,500 barrels (240 m2) of diesel fuel into marshes adjacent to Suisun Bay.

===Walnut Creek gasoline fire===
On November 9, 2004 in Walnut Creek, California, a petroleum pipeline carrying gasoline to San Jose owned and operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMEP) was struck by a backhoe used by Mountain Cascade Inc. (MC), a contractor operating in the construction of a water pipeline for the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). A massive gasoline spill was subsequently ignited, likely by the unaware welders of subcontractor Matamoros Welding working inside the steel water pipe, resulting in an explosive fireball that caused the deaths, by burns, of four workers and one supervisor and the severe injury of four others. Several nearby homes were ignited and one was partially destroyed. The fire burned for several hours before being brought under control by firefighters from departments throughout the central Contra Costa County region. CalOSHA (California Occupational Safety and Health Administration) cited KMGP Services Company (a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan) for failure to accurately stake-out the pipeline location.
On Wednesday, July 7, 2005, the California State Fire Marshal assessed a fine of $500,000 upon KMGP, the largest ever levied within the state.

On September 22, 2007, KMGP was convicted on six felony charges related to the Walnut Creek Explosion. They were fined $15 million in connection with the case. Over $90 million in legal settlements were paid to the various victims of the explosion.

===Burnaby crude oil spill===
On July 24, 2007, a crude oil pipeline owned and operated by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners was ruptured by an excavator digging a storm sewer trench. The rupture was a few hundred meters from the final location at the Westridge Marine Terminal. It resulted in almost 2,000 barrels of crude oil being released into the residential neighborhood and the ocean near Inlet Drive in Burnaby, British Columbia. The crude oil sprayed 11 houses on Inlet Drive and caused an evacuation of the area, forcing 250 residents from their homes. Approximately 600 barrels of the oil flowed into Burrard Inlet, the resulting cleanup costing more than $15 million. The cleanup operation ultimately recovered 1,800 barrels of oil from the Inlet and coastline.

The Transportation Safety Board released a report on the incident in 2009, which concluded that the pipe, which was 610 mm in diameter, was struck and punctured by a contractor’s excavator bucket during excavation of a trench for a new storm sewer line along Inlet Drive in Burnaby. On October 3, 2011, three companies—two contractors and Kinder Morgan—each entered guilty pleas to a 21-count indictment in Provincial Court. The Crown sought a sentence of a $1,000 fine and a $149,000 contribution to the Habitat Conservation Trust Foundation, which works to protect B.C.&#x27;s fish, wildlife and habitats. Kinder Morgan was also asked to contribute $100,000 to an educational and training program.

===Burnaby Mountain oil spill===
On May 6, 2009, a contractor discovered that oil was leaking from one of the tanks Kinder Morgan&#x27;s Burnaby Mountain terminal. In total, almost 1,700 barrels of crude oil were spilled. Fire and HazMat teams were called to the scene and contained the spill.

===Abbotsford oil spill===
On January 24, 2012, an oil spill was discovered at Kinder Morgan&#x27;s Sumas terminal in Abbotsford. Local residents began reporting a strong gas-like smell coming from the area as early as 4:30 a.m. The spill was reported to be limited to a &quot;containment area.&quot;

<text>Paul Martin Newby (born May 5, 1955) is an American judge, who was first elected to a seat on the North Carolina Supreme Court in 2004. He was elected chief justice in 2020 defeating incumbent Cheri Beasley.

==Early life and education==
Newby was born in Asheboro, North Carolina. He graduated from Ragsdale High School in Jamestown, North Carolina. He is an Eagle Scout and former Scoutmaster. A resident of Raleigh, North Carolina, Newby earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Public Policy Studies from Duke University in 1977 and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1980.

==Career==
After four years in private practice in Kannapolis, a year as a counsel to a real estate developer, vice president and general counsel of Cannon Mills Realty and Development Corporation, Newby was appointed as an assistant United States attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina in 1985, a post he held for almost twenty years. He is an adjunct professor at the Campbell University&#x27;s Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, and the co-author of a book on the North Carolina Constitution.

=== North Carolina Supreme Court ===

Following the resignation of Justice Robert F. Orr, Newby was one of eight candidates, four Republicans and four Democrats, who filed in a special election to fill the vacant seat; he won that race with 23% of the vote for an eight-year term on the court in the statewide judicial elections. In the officially non-partisan race, Newby was endorsed by the North Carolina Republican Party—the North Carolina Democratic Party refused to endorse any candidate in the race.

In November 2012, he won re-election to a second eight-year term, defeating Sam J. Ervin IV.

On November 3, 2020, Newby was elected as the chief justice, for an eight-year term beginning Jan. 1, 2021. On January 1, 2021, he was sworn in as the 30th Chief Justice.

<text>The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and museum of John F. Kennedy (1917–1963), the 35th president of the United States (1961–1963). It is located on Columbia Point in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, next to the University of Massachusetts at Boston, the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, and the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum. Designed by the architect I. M. Pei, the building is the official repository for original papers and correspondence of the Kennedy Administration, as well as special bodies of published and unpublished materials, such as books and papers by and about Ernest Hemingway.

The library and museum is part of the Presidential Library System, which is administered by the Office of Presidential Libraries, a part of the National Archives and Records Administration.

The library and Museum were dedicated in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter and members of the Kennedy family.

==History==
===Original site and name===
During a weekend visit to Boston on October 19, 1963, President Kennedy and John Carl Warnecke, the architect who designed Kennedy&#x27;s Tomb of the Eternal Flame at Arlington National Cemetery viewed several possible locations offered by Harvard University as a site for the library and museum. At the time, there were only four other presidential libraries: the Hoover Presidential Library, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, the Truman Library, and the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library. They were all scattered around the country in small towns from New York to Iowa. Kennedy had not decided on any design concept yet, but he felt that the existing presidential libraries were placed too &quot;far away from scholarly resources.&quot;

Kennedy chose a plot of land next to the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration. The building would face the Charles River which was a few feet away, and on the other side of which, the dormitories that included Winthrop House where Kennedy spent his upperclassman days.

Since Kennedy encouraged his administration to save effects of both personal and official nature, the complex would not just be a collection of the President&#x27;s papers, but &quot;a complete record of a Presidential era.&quot; Therefore, the building would have the word &quot;museum&quot; appended to its name as the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.

===Initial progress===
After President Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963, his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy&#x27;s widow Jacqueline, who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months, and visited with architects from around the world including Pietro Belluschi and others from the United States, Brazil&#x27;s Lucio Costa, and Italy&#x27;s Franco Albini. Mrs. Kennedy and others met with the candidates together at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis, Massachusetts, and visited several in their offices. The committee also conducted a secretive process whereby the architects voted anonymously for the most capable of their colleagues.

After the assassination, Cambridge residents actively opposed the Kennedy family&#x27;s efforts to build a presidential library at Harvard Square due to traffic concerns. On January 13, 1964, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy announced that a taped oral-history project was to be undertaken for inclusion in the library. The project would feature administration staff, friends, family, and politicians from home and abroad. The Attorney General also announced that Eugene R. Black Sr. agreed to serve as chairman of the board of trustees and that $1 million of Black&#x27;s $10 million goal had been given to the trust by the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation.

By March of that year $4.3 million had been pledged, including 18,727 unsolicited donations from the public. Large donations came from the Hispanic world with Venezuela pledging $100,000 and Governor of Puerto Rico Luis Muñoz Marín offering the same. The oral-history project also began recording, starting with Jacqueline Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. Originally projected to consist of interviews with 150 people, 178 had agreed to participate and the total number of expected participants doubled to 300.

Fourteen architects were named to serve on a design advisory committee:

Over the following months pledges continued to funnel in for the building still being conceptualized by the various architects. Some notable donations include $900,000 handed over to Postmaster General John A. Gronouski on July 9, 1964. It was the sum of a campaign encompassing 102 Federal agencies. Gronouski said many of the Federal employee contributions were in the form of a $5 withholding each payday for a period of three years. The next day the Indian ambassador to the United States, Braj Kumar Nehru. presented Black with a check for $100,000 during a ceremony at the River Club. Nehru said that the Indian people were hit by a &quot;sad blow&quot; when the President died, and that they held him &quot;in the highest regard, esteem and affection.&quot; He desired for Indian students abroad in the United States to use the library, then still planned for construction at Harvard along the banks of the Charles River.

===Pei selected as architect===

On December 13, 1964, the Kennedy family announced that I. M. Pei was unanimously chosen by a subcommittee as the architect of the library. Even though Pei was relatively unknown amongst the list of candidates, Mrs. Kennedy, who viewed him as filled with promise and imagination and after spending several months inspecting the many architects&#x27; offices and creations, selected him to create the vision she held for the project. Pei did not have a design yet, but the idea as described by Robert Kennedy was to &quot;stimulate interest in politics&quot;. Meanwhile, the suggestion that Harvard may not be a suitable site for the library had begun cropping up. When asked if Pei may have had to start from scratch, he said this was the case. With an &quot;encouraging grin&quot; Robert Kennedy simply wished Mr. Pei &quot;Good luck&quot;.

Mrs. Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. &quot;He didn&#x27;t seem to have just one way to solve a problem,&quot; she said. &quot;He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.&quot; Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it &quot;really an emotional decision&quot;, she explained: &quot;He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.&quot;

Not long before Pei was selected, the $10 million goal set by Black had been reached. By 1965, fundraising was suspended when the contributions reached $20 million.

===Years of setbacks===
In January 1966, when Massachusetts Governor John A. Volpe signed a bill allowing the state to purchase the land for the site—an old train yard belonging to the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA)—it was expected that the project would be complete by 1970. The original design was a large complex comprising the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum, the John F. Kennedy School of Government, and an Institute of Politics. The project faced many delays. The MBTA would not agree to remove the heavy machinery from the land until 1970. By that time construction costs had risen to over $20 million. Only now could Pei prepare a six-month study of the site&#x27;s soil, and he said the &quot;money we had six years ago, today will barely pay for 60 percent of the original plans.&quot;

Robert Kennedy, by then a senator from New York, had been serving as president of the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation until he was assassinated in 1968. Weeks before, William Manchester and Harper &amp; Row donated $750,000 to the library. The first in a series of installments expected to total $5 million, came from the profits of the 1967 book &quot;The Death of a President&quot; which caused a bitter feud between the Kennedys and Manchester. Mrs. Kennedy remarked &quot;I think it is so beautiful what Mr. Manchester did. I am glad that Senator Kennedy knew about it before he died.&quot; The youngest of the Kennedy brothers, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, stepped down as vice president of the corporation to fill the newly vacant position.

By 1971, construction had still not begun; researchers and scholars were forced to work out of the Federal Records Center which was temporarily housing some of the 15 million documents and manuscripts. Pei said there was finally &quot;a clear way ahead&quot;. He was asked to save on construction expenses by using inexpensive materials. This would translate into Pei working with concrete instead of his preferred stone.

On May 22, 1971, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy as president, saw the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum in Austin, Texas.

Meanwhile, the Cambridge community was in fierce opposition to having the library being built in Cambridge at all. Although originally welcomed in 1965, the library was now seen as a great attractor of over a million annual tourists who would change the neighborhood with &quot;hordes of tourists, automobiles, fast-food franchises and souvenir shops&quot;, as well as cause a negative environmental impact. A neighborhood group filed a lawsuit in federal court demanding that the General Services Administration study, which found that the great number of visitors would have &quot;no adverse effect on the area,&quot; be reexamined.

Stephen E. Smith, a Kennedy in-law who heads the John F. Kennedy Library Corporation decided that &quot;we want the Kennedy Library to be a happy place. It would not be in keeping with the nature of this memorial for it to open in an atmosphere of discord and controversy.&quot; In February 1975 the plans for having the library where President Kennedy would have wanted it, were dropped.

===New location, new plan===
In 1975, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library Corporation announced that it would locate the library on a 10-acre site offered by the University of Massachusetts Boston adjacent to its campus on the Columbia Point peninsula, and was described as a group of &quot;massive, blocky structures...in sharp contrast to the mellow and urbane atmosphere of the library&#x27;s original site near Harvard Square.&quot; The site was originally a garbage dump; Pei recalls finding old refrigerators and appliances under the soil. In all seriousness, he asserted that one could toss a lit match on the earth and watch the ground ignite as the soil emitted methane gas.

June 12, 1977, marked the official groundbreaking for the library with construction following in August. The site overlooks Boston, Dorchester Bay and the ocean. The area was covered in of earth and topsoil. Pei was particularly proud of the landscaping results.

The design would be a simple geometric structure with a large glass pavilion. The concrete tower stands tall and houses offices and archives. A circular section contains two theaters and is connected to the tower by the grey-glass pavilion. The concrete finish of the building directly reflects the budget. With more money Pei would have made the building with stone which he believes offers a nicer finish with more detail. The materials chosen kept the costs within budget, in total costing $20.8 million.

Over 30 million people contributed to the cost of construction, which more than 225 construction workers labored to complete before the end of 1979.

===Dedication===
The dedication was held on October 20, 1979. Outside the building on the green, on a blue-carpeted stage with a bank of yellow chrysanthemums sat the Kennedy family and those close to them. Among many others, President Jimmy Carter was in their company. The ceremony began with President Kennedy&#x27;s daughter, Caroline Kennedy, introducing her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr., who read from the Stephen Spender poem, &quot;I Think Continually of Those Who Were Truly Great&quot;.

President Carter said of John F. Kennedy that he embodied &quot;the ideals of a generation as few public figures have ever done in the history of the earth.&quot; He spoke of openly weeping upon hearing about the death of Kennedy, something that he had not done since his own father died, ten years before. Afterwards, he accepted the library &quot;on behalf of the American people&quot; and the National Archives and Records Administration.

Senator Edward M. Kennedy, said of his brother&#x27;s life, that it &quot;was a voyage of discovery, a quest for excellence that inspired universal trust and faith. In that brief unfinished journey, he made us believe once more in the great historic purpose of this land. He filled America with pride and made the nation young again.&quot;

Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. &quot;I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,&quot; he said in 2000. &quot;It could and should have been a great project.&quot; Perhaps the most important consequence of the Kennedy project for Pei was his elevation in the public&#x27;s consciousness as an architect of note. Pei considered the John F. Kennedy Library &quot;the most important commission in my life.&quot;

=== Temporary closure ===
During the federal mass layoffs, the library was closed until further notice on February 18, 2025, at approximately 2:00 PM. The reason given was &quot;Due to an executive order&quot;. The library reopened the next day with free admission.

==Exhibits and collection==

The library&#x27;s first floor features a museum containing video monitors, family photographs, political memorabilia. Visitors to the museum begin their visit by watching a film narrated by President Kennedy in one of two cinemas that show an orientation film, and a third shows a documentary on the Cuban Missile Crisis.

There are seven permanent exhibits:
* Campaign Trail – Exhibit on the presidential campaign of 1960 and New Frontier, featuring 1960 Democratic National Convention memorabilia, and a replica of a Kennedy campaign office.
* The Briefing Room – Exhibit on Kennedy&#x27;s speeches and press conferences.
* The Space Race – Exhibit on the Space Race and the U.S. space program during Project Mercury; features the Mercury-Redstone 3 (&quot;Freedom 7&quot;) space capsule in which astronaut Alan B. Shepard became the first American in space. The capsule, which was displayed at the United States Naval Academy&#x27;s Armel-Leftwich Visitor Center from 1998 to 2012, came to the JFK Library in 2012, and returned to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., in 2021.
* Attorney General&#x27;s Office – Exhibit on Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, President Kennedy&#x27;s brother and closest political advisor. Features information on RFK&#x27;s role in fighting organized crime as chief counsel for the Senate McClellan Committee, and the Department of Justice&#x27;s role in the American Civil Rights Movement during RFK&#x27;s time as attorney general. The centerpiece of the exhibit are items that RFK had in his office at the Department of Justice Building. These include documents, personal items, and a bust of Winston Churchill by Leo Cherne.
* The Oval Office – Exhibit features information on the American Civil Rights Movement during the Kennedy presidency, items that Kennedy kept in the Oval Office, and a replica of the &quot;Resolute&quot; desk.
* First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy – Exhibit on the life of First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy; features footage of the First Lady and artifacts from her life, include several pieces of clothing.
* The Kennedy Family – This exhibit on the famous Kennedy family features a number of artifacts, including Kathleen Kennedy&#x27;s Red Cross uniform jacket, a commemorative cup, a blackthorn walking stick, and a replica of the Great Mace of Galway, Ireland.

Among the Library&#x27;s art collection is a 1962 portrait of Robert F. Kennedy by Lajos Markos, a watercolor sketch of John F. Kennedy by Jamie Wyeth, a watercolor painting of the White House painted by Jacqueline Kennedy and given as a gift to her husband, who had it hung in the Oval Office, a fingerpainting by Caroline Kennedy as a child, and a bust of John F. Kennedy sculpted by Felix de Weldon.

Kennedy&#x27;s 25-foot Wianno Senior sailboat &quot;Victura&quot; is on display on the grounds of the Library from May to October. Acquired by the family when Kennedy was 15, it played an important role in forging sibling bonds and, after the president&#x27;s death, continued being sailed by other members of the family, especially race-enthusiast brother Ted.

The Library has a variety of temporary and special exhibits.

==Archives==
===Audiovisual===
The audiovisual archives contain over 400,000 still photographs taken from 1863 to 1984, over of film shot between 1910 and 1983, and 11,000 reels of audio recordings from 1910 to 1985.

===Oral-history project===
Begun in 1964, the oral-history project was a unique undertaking to document and preserve interviews with those associated with Kennedy. Initially expected to have about 150 participants, today it contains over 1,100 interviews and continues to this day. It is modelled after a program by the Columbia University Oral History Research Office, the world&#x27;s oldest, which began in 1948. At its conception, while serving as Attorney General, Robert Kennedy speculated that some of the interviews, such as ones relating to the Cuban Missile Crisis, might have to be sealed for a while due to containing &quot;highly classified material.&quot; He said that although the emphasis would be on releasing everything as soon as possible, some items might remain closed for 10 to 25 years.

Because the interviewees are allowed to review their transcripts before the interviews are released for use by scholars, the audio may differ from the written record so that the interviewees may disambiguate any misunderstanding in their speech and make it clear in a written form.

===Artifacts===
The library keeps a wide range of artifacts, many of which can be found in their respective exhibits. One is the original coconut on which a rescue message was inscribed by Kennedy to rescue the crew of the &quot;PT-109&quot;, which was delivered to coastwatcher Reginald Evans by Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana, natives of the Solomon Islands.

==The Ernest Hemingway Collection==
The library is also home to a collection of documents and belongings from Ernest Hemingway. The collection was established in 1968 following an exchange of letters between Hemingway&#x27;s widow Mary and Jacqueline Kennedy that confirmed that Hemingway&#x27;s papers would be archived there. In 1961, despite a U.S. travel ban to Cuba, President Kennedy had arranged to allow Mary Hemingway to go there to claim her recently deceased husband&#x27;s documents and belongings. A room for the collection was dedicated on July 18, 1980, by Patrick Hemingway and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

The Ernest Hemingway Collection spans Hemingway&#x27;s career, and includes &quot;ninety percent of existing Hemingway manuscript materials, making the Kennedy Library the world&#x27;s principal center for research&quot; on his life and work. It includes:
* Over 1000 manuscripts of varying lengths, including hand-written drafts of &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and dozens of hand-drafted alternate endings to &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;
* Research material on bullfighting, used as background for &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; and &quot;The Dangerous Summer&quot;
* Thousands of letters written by or to Hemingway; this included correspondence with fellow writers such as Sherwood Anderson, Carlos Baker, John Dos Passos, William Faulkner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Robert Frost, Martha Gellhorn, A. E. Hotchner, James Joyce, Archibald MacLeish, Ezra Pound, and Gertrude Stein, as well as with actress Marlene Dietrich, restaurateur Toots Shor, Cardinal Francis Spellman, publisher Charles Scribner, his editor Maxwell Perkins, and his lawyer Alfred Rice
* More than 10,000 photographs, as well as press clippings and other ephemera
* Books from his private library, many with marginalia, and including a rare copy of Francisco Goya&#x27;s &quot;Los Proverbios&quot;

==Incidents==
In 2013, a fire occurred in the library. Reports initially stated that the fire appeared to have started in a mechanical room. The fire was unrelated to the Boston Marathon bombing, which occurred simultaneously.

In 2022, a window washer fell to his death in the building&#x27;s pavilion.

The brush head vibrates at hundreds of times per second, with the latest models at 31,000 strokes per minute (517 Hz) or 62,000 movements per minute (1033 Hz). Rather than connecting to its charger with conductors, it uses inductive charging—the charger includes the primary winding of the voltage-reducing transformer and the handle of the brush includes the secondary winding. The replaceable head is also driven magnetically. Currently, there are multiple types of Sonicare brushes.

===Clinical research===

Individual clinical research has shown Sonicare toothbrushes to be more effective than comparable Oral-B electric toothbrushes in reduction of gingival inflammation and therefore improvement in periodontal health. However a 2004 review of 29 studies concluded that only electric toothbrushes with rotational/oscillation movement removed more plaque than other brushes when correctly used. A second review found no clinical evidence for the dynamic fluid activity of the Sonicare toothbrush being more effective in plaque removal than an Oral-B oscillating/rotating electric toothbrush. A 2007 study comparing the two found the rotation/oscillation brush to be more effective in single-use plaque reduction.

An additional study showed that while both Sonicare and Oral B electric toothbrushes do better than manual toothbrushes in removing plaque, reducing gingival inflammation, and reducing probing depths, the Sonicare showed significantly more improvement than Oral B. The percentage reduction in inflammation from baseline at 6 months was 31.9% for Sonicare and 18.1% for Oral B. In regards to probing depth, Sonicare showed a mean reduction of 0.84 mm from baseline at 6 months, while Oral B showed an average reduction of 0.39 mm.

Individual studies have shown that Sonicare toothbrushes are more effective at removing plaque and reducing gingivitis than manual toothbrushes.

==History==
In 1987, David Giuliani, an entrepreneur with a background in electrical engineering, met with University of Washington professors Drs. David Engel and Roy Martin. They formed a new company named GEMTech to promote a dental hygiene device using a piezoelectric multimorph transducer. After several years of research and creating prototypes, the Sonicare toothbrush was introduced in 1992.

In 1995, GEMTech changed its name to Optiva Corporation. The company was originally headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, and moved to Snoqualmie, Washington, in 1999. The plant in Snoqualmie was later supplemented by an additional facility in Auburn, Washington. In October 2000, Philips Domestic Appliances and Personal Care, a division of Philips, acquired the company. A few months later Optiva Corporation changed its name to Philips Oral Healthcare, Inc. By the end of 2001, Sonicare had become the number-one selling rechargeable power toothbrush in the United States. In 2003, to improve Philips brand recognition in the US, Philips rebranded the Sonicare toothbrush as &quot;Philips Sonicare&quot;.

<text>Andrew Kevin Walker (born August 14, 1964) is an American screenwriter. He is known for having written &quot;Seven&quot; (1995), for which he earned a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay, as well as several other films, including &quot;8mm&quot; (1999), &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; (1999) and many uncredited script rewrites.

==Early life and education==
Walker was born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, though some time during his childhood, he moved to Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, where he was raised. He attended the Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School until his graduation in 1982. Walker soon enrolled in Penn State University to pursue a career in film production. He graduated from Penn State in 1986, with a Bachelor of Arts in film and video.

==Film career==
Shortly after completing his education, he moved to New York City and took a job at Tower Records. During that time, he worked on several projects, but Walker was unable to find much success until 1991, when he completed the script for &quot;Seven&quot;. Walker decided to move to Los Angeles to sell his screenplay. There, he personally contacted screenwriter David Koepp, who showed the script to executives at New Line Cinema, who ended up purchasing the rights to it. The film, however, took nearly three years to begin production. &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; director Jeremiah S. Chechik was originally chosen to direct the optioned film but he asked for a number of modifications, including the changes to the ending, particularly the removal of the head in a box scene. Walker continued reworking the script but the film got passed around in Hollywood. The project finally went ahead when David Fincher agreed to direct the film after he read the original draft, which was accidentally sent with the ending intact.

While the project was ongoing, Walker found other work as a screenwriter, including a short stint with HBO&#x27;s television series &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot;, as well as writing two other films, &quot;Brainscan&quot; (1994) and the novel adaptation &quot;Hideaway&quot; (1995).

&quot;Seven&quot; began production between his two other films, headed by Fincher as the director and starring Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey. At one point during production, the studio proposed several changes — which would later become a recurring theme throughout Walker&#x27;s career — deeming it too dark for its target audience. Both Fincher and Freeman backed Walker&#x27;s original script, and it eventually went unchanged. The film was met with critical acclaim and enormous box office success, earning $327,311,859 worldwide. It would allow Walker to make a name for himself in the movie industry.

However, Walker would not earn another film credit to his name for another four years, though he penned several uncredited rewrites during this period, including &quot;The Game&quot; (on which he again worked with David Fincher) and Paul W. S. Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Event Horizon&quot;. In 1999, Walker&#x27;s &quot;8MM&quot; finally saw the light of day, having been sold by him for a reported $1.25 million. Once again, the film&#x27;s production encountered concerns regarding the dark subject matter, and the studio asked Walker to lighten the film&#x27;s tone. With Joel Schumacher as director, Walker felt a rewrite would no longer be needed. But as it turned out, Schumacher supported the studio and made changes of his own, leading to a much-publicized fallout between the two, with Walker virtually disowning the film and walking away from the set. He refused to even watch the film, which became a critical failure. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, he said that &quot;it was such an inherently depressing experience that the very least I can do is protect myself from the miserable experience of actually watching it.&quot; In 2015, he expressed his openness to a redo &quot;8MM&quot; instead of remaking &quot;Seven.&quot; The latter had left the studios and producers unhappy with Somerset merely standing there helpless as Mills shot John Doe.

Walker found other success in 1999, as he penned uncredited rewrites to the critical hits &quot;Stir of Echoes&quot; and &quot;Fight Club&quot;, now considered a cult classic. Walker&#x27;s adaptation of Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; also wrapped up production as &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;, directed by Tim Burton. While Burton admired Walker&#x27;s original script, he hired the playwright and Academy Award-winning screenwriter Tom Stoppard to tone down the violence. The film, starring Johnny Depp, was still a box office and critical success.

Since the mid-1990s, Walker wrote several screenplays that were never greenlit or have yet to go into production, such as a script for a movie starring the superhero Silver Surfer, a version of &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000; his script was written in 1994), and a film tentatively titled &quot;Batman vs. Superman&quot;. The latter film was set to go into production, but Warner Bros. opted to revive their franchises separately, and so the script was shelved. After the announcement and subsequent successes of &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and &quot;Superman Returns&quot;, the film seemed to be shelved permanently, though Wolfgang Petersen, who was due to direct the feature, had continued to express his interest in the project. That script and version of the project was permanently shelved in favor of the Zack Snyder helmed &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;.

Walker wrote the 2016 animated dark comedy &quot;Nerdland&quot;, starring Paul Rudd and Patton Oswalt.

Walker also wrote as-yet unproduced screenplays for the American version of &quot;The Girl Who Played with Fire&quot; and a remake of &quot;The Reincarnation of Peter Proud&quot;, both for &quot;Seven&quot; director David Fincher, as well as the adaption of the graphic novel &quot;The Killer&quot; by Alexis Nolent, which has been filmed by Fincher and stars Michael Fassbender. 

===Other projects===
Walker also wrote two shorts for the BMW Films series &quot;The Hire&quot;, starring Clive Owen: &quot;Ambush&quot;, directed by John Frankenheimer, and &quot;The Follow&quot;, by Wong Kar-wai.

Walker also co-wrote (with David Self and Paul Attanasio) the screenplay for &quot;The Wolfman&quot;, a remake of the Universal Studios classic. The remake, directed by Joe Johnston and starring Benicio del Toro in the title role, received a 2010 release.

Amazon named Walker&#x27;s 2015 Kindle Single, &quot;Old Man Johnson&quot; (his first novel), among its &quot;Best of the Year.&quot;

=== Appearances in film ===

Walker is known for making short cameos in films for which he served as a writer. In &quot;Panic Room&quot;, he appears as a sleepy neighbor; in &quot;Fight Club&quot;, three detectives are named, respectively, Andrew, Kevin and Walker; and in &quot;Seven&quot;, he is the corpse near the very beginning of the movie.

<doc id="1185836" wikidata="Q1754244" url="?curid=1185836" title="Mind Body &amp; Soul">
<text>Mind Body &amp; Soul is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Joss Stone, released on 15 September 2004 by S-Curve Records. The album received generally favourable reviews from music critics and earned Stone three Grammy Award nominations, including Best New Artist and Best Pop Vocal Album.

&quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 75,000 copies sold in its first week, making Stone the youngest female singer to top the chart. It also performed strongly on international record charts, reaching number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States and charting within the top 10 in several countries across Europe and Oceania.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 64, based on 11 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic noted that, compared to &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;, &quot;[c]ertain songs are a little brighter and a little more radio-ready than before, there&#x27;s a more pronounced hip-hop vibe to some beats, and she sounds a little more like a diva this time around—not enough to alienate older fans, but enough to win some new ones. The album has a seductive, sultry feel; there&#x27;s some genuine grit to the rhythms, yet it&#x27;s all wrapped up in a production that&#x27;s smooth as silk.&quot; John Murphy of &quot;musicOMH&quot; wrote that &quot;[t]his is a terrific album, and on this basis Joss Stone is going to be a household name for years and years to come.&quot; Darryl Sterdan of Jam! wrote that &quot;even if her contributions were limited to lyrics and melodies, she still comes through with flying colours, displaying a knack for sharp hooks and catchy choruses.&quot; Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK commented that songs like &quot;Right to Be Wrong&quot;, &quot;Jet Lag&quot; and &quot;Killing Time&quot; &quot;confirm that not only can she deliver pain and passion like a lover three times her age, she can write it like one too.&quot; He continued: &quot;There&#x27;s not a bad song here, but there are some that never make it out of the rootsy background.&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; critic Michael Paoletta stated that Stone &quot;continues to reinvent soul music, injecting a very classic sound with contemporary sass and verve&quot;, while noting that &quot;[t]hroughout, &quot;that&quot; voice reigns supreme.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Caroline Sullivan believed that &quot;this record is best seen as a stepping stone by which she shouldn&#x27;t be judged too exactingly.&quot; She also praised Stone&#x27;s &quot;ripening&quot; voice, saying it is &quot;foxier&quot; than on &quot;The Soul Sessions&quot;. At &quot;Blender&quot; magazine, Robert Christgau opined that &quot;this album&#x27;s compromise with the teen-pop divahood she was groomed for will feel like a bid for authenticity. Stone&#x27;s infatuation with band grooves provides relief from the radio-ready synthesizers and compressors.&quot; Dimitri Ehrlich of &quot;Vibe&quot; called the album &quot;deeply refreshing&quot;, adding that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s nothing new here [...] but if your ears are inured to the dense, overly polished production of contemporary R&amp;B, Stone&#x27;s simplicity and rawness will come as a revelation.&quot; Laura Sinagra of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;As on her last album, tasteful retro organs and wah-wah dominate this batch of originals&quot; and named &quot;Spoiled&quot; one of the album&#x27;s &quot;strongest moments&quot;, but felt that songs like &quot;Don&#x27;t Cha Wanna Ride&quot; and &quot;You Had Me&quot; are &quot;more Destiny&#x27;s Child than yesterday&#x27;s blues&quot;. In a mixed review, David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; stated, &quot;Save for a mild foray into reggae and a stab at power balladry, the tracks are monotonously midtempo, supper-club soul.&quot;

===Accolades===
At the 2005 Brit Awards, Stone won the awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Urban Act, and was nominated for British Breakthrough Act, becoming the youngest recipient of a Brit Award at age 17. That same year, Stone received three nominations at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;You Had Me&quot; and Best Pop Vocal Album for &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot;. The album earned Stone a nomination for International Newcomer of the Year at Germany&#x27;s Echo Awards in 2005.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number one with first-week sales of 75,000 copies, making Stone the youngest female singer to top the chart at 17 years and five months old, a record previously held by Avril Lavigne with her album &quot;Let Go&quot; (2002). The record was eventually broken by Billie Eilish in April 2019, when her album &quot;When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?&quot; debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart while she was 17 years and three months old. It also became the first number-one album for Relentless Records. The album spent one week atop the UK Albums Chart, and was certified triple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 9 September 2005. As of July 2012, &quot;Mind Body &amp; Soul&quot; had sold 940,617 copies in the United Kingdom. The album debuted at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, selling 73,487 copies in its first week. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 9 September 2005, and had sold 1.3 million copies in the US by July 2011.

<doc id="1185840" wikidata="Q1532069" url="?curid=1185840" title="Private information retrieval">
<text>In cryptography, a private information retrieval (PIR) protocol is a protocol that allows a user to retrieve an item from a server in possession of a database without revealing which item is retrieved. PIR is a weaker version of 1-out-of-&quot;n&quot; oblivious transfer, where it is also required that the user should not get information about other database items.

One trivial, but very inefficient way to achieve PIR is for the server to send an entire copy of the database to the user. In fact, this is the only possible protocol (in the classical or the quantum setting) that gives the user information theoretic privacy for their query in a single-server setting. There are two ways to address this problem: make the server computationally bounded or assume that there are multiple non-cooperating servers, each having a copy of the database. 

The problem was introduced in 1995 by Chor, Goldreich, Kushilevitz and Sudan in the information-theoretic setting and in 1997 by Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky in the computational setting. Since then, very efficient solutions have been discovered. Single database (computationally private) PIR can be achieved with constant (amortized) communication and k-database (information theoretic) PIR can be done with formula_1 communication.

==Advances in computational PIR==
The first single-database computational PIR scheme to achieve communication complexity less than formula_2 was created in 1997 by Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky and achieved communication complexity of formula_3 for any formula_4, where formula_2 is the number of bits in the database. The security of their scheme was based on the well-studied quadratic residuosity problem. In 1999, Christian Cachin, Silvio Micali and Markus Stadler achieved poly-logarithmic communication complexity. The security of their system is based on the phi-hiding assumption. In 2004, Helger Lipmaa achieved log-squared communication complexity formula_6, where formula_7 is the length of the strings and formula_8 is the security parameter. The security of his system reduces to the semantic security of a length-flexible additively homomorphic cryptosystem like the Damgård–Jurik cryptosystem. In 2005 Craig Gentry and Zulfikar Ramzan achieved log-squared communication complexity which retrieves log-square (consecutive) bits of the database. The security of their scheme is also based on a variant of the Phi-hiding assumption. The communication rate was finally brought down to formula_9 by Aggelos Kiayias, Nikos Leonardos, Helger Lipmaa, Kateryna Pavlyk, Qiang Tang, in 2015.

All previous sublinear-communication computational PIR protocol required linear computational complexity of formula_10 public-key operations. In 2009, Helger Lipmaa designed a computational PIR protocol with communication complexity formula_6 and worst-case computation of formula_12 public-key operations. Amortization techniques that retrieve non-consecutive bits have been considered by Yuval Ishai, Eyal Kushilevitz, Rafail Ostrovsky and Amit Sahai.

As shown by Ostrovsky and Skeith, the schemes by Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky and Lipmaa use similar ideas based on homomorphic encryption. The Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky protocol is based on the Goldwasser–Micali cryptosystem while the protocol by Lipmaa is based on the Damgård–Jurik cryptosystem.

==Advances in information theoretic PIR==
Achieving information theoretic security requires the assumption that there are multiple non-cooperating servers, each having a copy of the database. Without this assumption, any information-theoretically secure PIR protocol requires an amount of communication that is at least the size of the database &quot;n&quot;. Multi-server PIR protocols tolerant of non-responsive or malicious/colluding servers are called &quot;robust&quot; or &quot;Byzantine robust&quot; respectively. These issues were first considered by Beimel and Stahl (2002). An ℓ-server system that can operate where only &quot;k&quot; of the servers respond, ν of the servers respond incorrectly, and which can withstand up to &quot;t&quot; colluding servers without revealing the client&#x27;s query is called &quot;&quot;t&quot;-private ν-Byzantine robust &quot;k&quot;-out-of-ℓ PIR&quot; [DGH 2012]. In 2012, C. Devet, I. Goldberg, and N. Heninger (DGH 2012) proposed an optimally robust scheme that is Byzantine-robust to formula_13 which is the theoretical maximum value. It is based on an earlier protocol of Goldberg that uses Shamir&#x27;s Secret Sharing to hide the query. Goldberg has released a C++ implementation on SourceForge.

==Relation to other cryptographic primitives==
One-way functions are necessary, but not known to be sufficient, for nontrivial (i.e., with sublinear communication) single database computationally private information retrieval. In fact, such a protocol was proved by Giovanni Di Crescenzo, Tal Malkin and Rafail Ostrovsky to imply oblivious transfer (see below).

Oblivious transfer, also called symmetric PIR, is PIR with the additional restriction that the user may not learn any item other than the one she requested. It is termed symmetric because both the user and the database have a privacy requirement.

Collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions are implied by any one-round computational PIR scheme, as shown by Ishai, Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky.

==PIR variations==
The basic motivation for private information retrieval is a family of two-party protocols in which one of the parties (the &quot;sender&quot;) owns a database, and the other part (the &quot;receiver&quot;) wants to query it with certain privacy restrictions and warranties. So, as a result of the protocol, if the &quot;receiver&quot; wants the &quot;i-th&quot; value in the database he must learn the &quot;i-th&quot; entry, but the &quot;sender&quot; must learn nothing about &quot;i&quot;. In a general PIR protocol, a computationally unbounded &quot;sender&quot; can learn nothing about &quot;i&quot; so privacy is theoretically preserved. Since the PIR problem was posed, different approaches to its solution have been pursued and some variations were proposed.
A CPIR (computationally private information retrieval) protocol is similar to a PIR protocol: the &quot;receiver&quot; retrieves an element chosen by him from the sender&#x27;s database, so that the &quot;sender&quot; obtains no knowledge about which element was transferred. The only difference is that privacy is safeguarded against a polynomially bounded sender.

A CSPIR (computationally symmetric private information retrieval) protocol is used in a similar scenario in which a CPIR protocol is used. If the &quot;sender&quot; owns a database, and the &quot;receiver&quot; wants to get the &quot;i-th&quot; value in this database, at the end of the execution of a SPIR protocol, the &quot;receiver&quot; should have learned nothing about values in the database other than the &quot;i-th&quot; one.

==PIR implementations==
Numerous Computational PIR and Information theoretic PIR schemes in the literature have been implemented. Here is an incomplete list:

* MuchPIR is a CPIR implementation as a Postgres C/C++ Extension [GitHub, 2021].
* SealPIR is a fast CPIR implementation [ACLS 2018].
* Popcorn is a PIR implementation tailored for media [GCMSAW 2016].
* Percy++ includes implementations of [AG 2007, DGH 2012, CGKS 1998, Goldberg 2007, HOG 2011, LG 2015].
* RAID-PIR is an implementation of the ITPIR scheme of [DHS 2014].
* XPIR is a fast CPIR implementation [ABFK 2014].
* upPIR is an ITPIR implementation [Cappos 2013].

<doc id="1185843" wikidata="Q603325" url="?curid=1185843" title="Antonio Maria Valsalva">
<text>Antonio Maria Valsalva (17 January 1666 – 2 February 1723), was an Italian anatomist born in Imola. His research focused on the anatomy of the ears. He coined the term Eustachian tube and he described the aortic sinuses of Valsalva in his writings, published posthumously in 1740. His name is associated with the Valsalva antrum of the ear and the Valsalva maneuver, which is used as a test of circulatory function. Anatomical structures bearing his name are &quot;Valsalva’s muscle&quot; and &quot;taeniae Valsalvae&quot;. He observed that when weakness of one side of the body is caused by a lesion in the brain, the culprit lesion tends to be on the side opposite (contralateral) to the weak side; this finding is named the &quot;Valsalva doctrine&quot; in his honor.

==Background==
Valsalva was born in Imola, which was then under the rule of the Pope. His initial studies were at a Jesuit school where he studied humanities, mathematics, and natural sciences. After studies of the liberal arts, he studied medicine and philosophy at the University of Bologna, where he trained under Marcello Malpighi, who was among the first to study microscopic anatomy. Valsalva graduated from medical school in 1687. In 1695, he was named surgeon for the Hospital of the Incurables (Sant&quot;Orsola) in Bologna. In 1705, he was appointed professor of anatomy at the University of Bologna. He was later chosen as president of the &quot;Istituto Clementino delle Scienze ed Arti&quot; (Clementine Institute of Arts and Sciences). Valsalva taught Giovanni Battista Morgagni who edited Valsalva’s complete writings and published a biography on Valsalva, both in 1740.

In 1709, Valsalva married Elena Lisi. As he lost his health, he lost his sense of smell, but he recognized the prodromal symptoms, in the form of dyslalia, of the disease that would eventually cause his death from stroke at Bologna in 1723.

Valsalva was buried in the church of San Giovanni in Monte, Bologna. The Valsalva family donated a collection of dried anatomical specimens to be used for educational purposes to the Institute of Sciences founded in 1711. The wear of this material that followed possibly inspired the work of the Bolognese school of wax modeling and the artists Ercole Lelli and Giovanni and Anna Morandi Manzolini. This new anatomic collection includes models of the heart and lungs and is today presented at the Museum of Anatomy.

Valsalva was described as a skillful surgeon and excellent physician, a meticulous anatomist with high scientific integrity, and a man of great kindness. Morgagni wrote &quot;. . . there is nobody of those times who goes ahead of him, very few who are his equals.&quot;

==Research==

Valsalva both studied and taught in the fields of science, surgery, anatomy, physiology, and psychiatry. At a young age, Valsalva had successfully removed a dog’s kidney. He opposed cauterization in the treatment of wounds, and recommended humanitarian treatment of mentally ill patients. His main interest was the middle and internal ear, including the muscles of the external ear and the pharyngeal muscles.

Valsalva named the Eustachian tube and described its function and that of its muscle. He showed the connection between the mastoid cells and the tympanic cavity, and made observations on physiologic and pathologic processes of the ear. &quot;De aure humana tractatus&quot; published in 1704 contains a description of the Valsalva maneuver and patency test of the auditory tubes.

A skilled anatomist, Valsalva conducted many autopsies on deceased patients. During the 17th century, lacking chemical tests and knowledge of disease transmission mechanisms, he sometimes tasted the fluids he encountered in cadavers in an effort to better characterize them. &quot;Gangrenous pus does not taste good&quot;, he wrote, &quot;leaving the tongue tingling unpleasantly for the better part of the day.&quot;

(Translated into Italian by Vincenzo Mangano)

==Valsalva device in spacesuits==
The Valsalva device is a device used in spacesuits to allow astronauts to equalize the pressure in their ears by performing the Valsalva maneuver inside the suit without using their hands to block their nose. It has also been used for other purposes, such as to remove moisture from the face.

<text>Kihikihi, a small town located in the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand, serves as a satellite community of Te Awamutu, five kilometres to the north, and lies 35 kilometres south of Hamilton. The 2018 New Zealand census recorded a population of 2,808 people The main reason for the large increase since 2013 is the construction of a large number of new dwellings.

The town&#x27;s outer rim has merged with the expanding rim of Te Awamutu, rendering the boundary between the two towns difficult to perceive.

&quot;Kihikihi&quot; is a Māori-language word meaning &quot;cicada&quot;; the name imitates the sound made by the insect.
A large statue of a cicada stands at the northern entrance to the town.

Kihikihi&#x27;s multi-purpose sports domain hosts national and international equestrian events such as the FEI Eventing World Cup.

The town is also home to the historic Kihikihi Polo Club, founded in 1892 by the Kay family.

== History == 
Kihikihi in the 19th century was described as a &quot;border settlement&quot; or a &quot;frontier town&quot; by James Cowan, ruined in the 1880s by the &quot;Great Wet Peace&quot; with the partition of the King Country and land-buying from Māori .

==Demographics==
Kihikihi covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.


Before the 2023 census, the town had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Kihikihi had a population of 2,808 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 336 people (13.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 447 people (18.9%) since the 2006 census. There were 999 households, comprising 1,389 males and 1,422 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female, with 585 people (20.8%) aged under 15 years, 531 (18.9%) aged 15 to 29, 1,260 (44.9%) aged 30 to 64, and 432 (15.4%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 78.8% European/Pākehā, 29.8% Māori, 2.5% Pacific peoples, 2.6% Asian, and 1.5% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 13.4, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 52.6% had no religion, 32.4% were Christian, 2.6% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% were Hindu, 0.5% were Buddhist and 1.7% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 273 (12.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 555 (25.0%) people had no formal qualifications. 315 people (14.2%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,170 (52.6%) people were employed full-time, 300 (13.5%) were part-time, and 96 (4.3%) were unemployed.

== People ==
John Rochford (1832–1893) died in the Star Hotel and is buried in the Kihikihi Cemetery near the Kihikihi Primary school. He was one of the first to survey the routes of today&#x27;s railways in both the North and South Islands. A reserve in Kihikhi commemorates the name of John Rochford.

Rewi Maniapoto (1807–1894) lived in Kihikihi, on the site of the Rewi Maniapoto Reserve and the memorial. Kihikihi stood at the core of the productive farm-lands that Maori developed in the 1850s with the help of CMS missionaries. The district supplied food to new settlers in Auckland for a brief period. The area became the heartland of anti-government Maori in 1863, during the New Zealand Wars.

== Archaeological sites ==
20 archaeological sites have been identified in the town, 9 of which are listed by Heritage New Zealand -
* c1868 Alpha Hotel
* 1879 Major Jackson&#x27;s House
* 1881 Christ Church (Anglican)
* 1883 Star Hotel
* 1894 Rewi Maniapoto Memorial and Reserve
* 1904 Town Hall
* 1907 Constable&#x27;s House and Police Station
* 1920 World War One Memorial
* 94 Lyon St
Under the Reserves Act 1977, a management plan for some of the historic area was drawn up for Waipa District Council.

==Education==

Kihikihi School is a co-educational state primary school for Year 1 to 8 students, with a roll of as of Kihikihi is a dual medium Kura, meaning there is an Aoraki stream taught in English, and a Rumaki stream taught entirely in Te Reo Māori. It opened in 1873, and moved to its current site in 1884. It was destroyed by fire in 1938, and rebuilt in 1952.

== Transport ==
Kihikihi is on SH3. An infrequent bus service operated by GoBus links it to Te Awamutu and Hamilton. The Kihikihi Trail cycleway to Te Awamutu opened in 2017.

== Sport ==
Kihikihi Speedway is a motorcycle speedway venue located on Grey Street. The track races various types of cars, such as stock cars, superstocks, midgets, sprint cars, sidecars and saloons, in addition to motorcycle speedway. and has been a significant venue for important motorcycle speedway events, including qualifying rounds of the Speedway World Championship and finals of the New Zealand Solo Championship.

<text>Milonia Caesonia (died AD 41) was Roman empress as the fourth and last wife of the Roman emperor Caligula from their marriage in AD 39 until they were both assassinated in 41.

==Life==
===Early life===
The daughter of Vistilia, Milonia was born toward the beginning of the first century, but the year is not certain. Her birthday was celebrated between 2 June and 4 June. Caesonius Maximus was believed by Marco Agosti to have been her father. The gens Caesonia was of modest origin, and had only recently come to prominence. David Wardle on the other hand argued that her father was likely a Milonius. Milonia had six half-brothers, five of whom are known, Servius Cornelius Scipio Orfitus (whose son, Servius Cornelius Scipio Salvidienus Orfitus, was consul in AD 51), Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo (consul in 39, and a distinguished general under Claudius and Nero, was the father of the empress Domitia Longina), Quintus Pomponius Secundus (consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in 41), Publius Pomponius Secundus (consul &quot;suffectus&quot; in 44) and Publius Suillius Rufus (consul in 43, and father of Marcus Suillius Nerullinus, consul in 50).

===Marriages===
Milonia was married first to a man of uncertain name, some historians have speculated that he was the Rufus mentioned to be married to a woman named Caesonia who was born on the same date as Domitian (24 October) in a poem by Martial. Marco Agosti identified him as Instanius (sometimes corrected as Instantius, Insantius, Istantius or Istanius) Rufus, a patron of Martial.

Suetonius says that when Caligula married her, she was neither beautiful nor young, and was already the mother of three daughters by her first marriage. He describes her as a woman of reckless extravagance and wantonness, whom Caligula nonetheless loved passionately and faithfully. According to Cassius Dio, the two entered into an affair some time before their marriage, either late in AD 39 or early in 40, and the emperor&#x27;s choice of a bride was an unpopular one. The satirist Juvenal suggests that Caligula&#x27;s madness was the result of a love potion administered to him by Milonia.

Milonia was pregnant at the time of the marriage, and gave birth to a daughter, Julia Drusilla, only one month later (or according to Suetonius, on her wedding day).

In the account given by Suetonius, the emperor would parade Milonia in front of his troops, and sometimes displayed her naked in front of select friends. In an odd demonstration of affection, he would jokingly threaten to have her tortured or killed.

On 24 January, AD 41, Caligula was slain by an assassin. As part of the wider conspiracy, Milonia and her daughter Julia Drusilla were murdered just hours after Caligula&#x27;s demise. Josephus reports that she died bravely: stricken with grief at her husband&#x27;s death, she willingly offered her neck to the assassin, telling him to kill her without hesitation.

==Portrayals==
Milonia has been portrayed several times on film and television:
*1937 – Leonora Corbett in the uncompleted film &quot;I, Claudius&quot;
*1966 – Krista Keller in the TV movie &quot;Caligula&quot;
*1968 – Barbara Murray in the TV series &quot;The Caesars&quot;
*1975 – Yvonne Lex in the TV movie &quot;Caligula&quot;
*1976 – Freda Dowie in the TV series &quot;I, Claudius&quot;
*1979 – Helen Mirren in the theatrical film &quot;Caligula&quot;

<text>The Baetic System or Betic System () is one of the main systems of mountain ranges in Spain. Located in the southern and eastern Iberian Peninsula, it is also known as the Cordilleras Béticas (Baetic Mountain Ranges) or Baetic Mountains. The name of the mountain system derives from the ancient Roman region of Baetica, one of the Imperial Roman provinces of ancient Hispania.

==Geography==
The Baetic System is made up of multiple mountain ranges that reach from western Andalusia to the Region of Murcia, southern Castile-La Mancha and southern Land of Valencia. To the north, the Baetic Ranges are separated from the Meseta Central and the Sierra Morena by the basin of the Guadalquivir. The Iberian System rises north of the eastern part of the Prebaetic System, the northernmost part of the Baetic System. The mountain ranges that are part of this system are generally aligned \along a southwest-northeast direction.
The best-known range of the Baetic System is the Sierra Nevada, which contains the Mulhacén, the highest mountain in continental Spain and in the Iberian Peninsula. 
The Rock of Gibraltar is also considered part of the Baetic System, but not the Cabo de Gata area further east which includes rocks of volcanic origin.

==Geology==
The Baetic System as a geological feature belongs to a larger orogeny usually called the Gibraltar Arc, which represents the westernmost edge of the Alpine Orogeny. The geodynamic mechanisms responsible for its formation are so far relatively unknown.

Geologically the Rif mountains in Morocco and the Serra de Tramuntana in the island of Majorca are, respectively, Soutwestern and Northeastern extensions of the Baetic System.
The Gibraltar Arc geological region follows the Moroccan coast from Oujda in the east to Tangier in the west, then crosses the Strait of Gibraltar and goes east again from Cádiz to Valencia and the Balearic Islands.

==Ecology==
The Baetic System is home to a number of Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub plant communities, including shrublands, oak woodlands, broadleaf forests, and coniferous forests, which vary with elevation, soils, and topography.

The Baetic System, together with the Rif Mountains of Morocco, which face the Baetic Ranges across the Alboran Sea, is one of the Mediterranean basin&#x27;s ten biodiversity hotspots, known to ecologists as the Baetic-Rifan complex. The Baetic mountains are home to a rich assemblage of Mediterranean plants, including a number of relict species from the ancient laurel forests, which covered much of the Mediterranean basin millions of years ago when it was more humid.

==Subdivision==
The Baetic System is divided into the following sub-chains (from south to north):

===Penibaetic System===

The Penibaetic System includes the highest point in the peninsula, the 3,478 m high Mulhacén in the Sierra Nevada; other ranges and features are:

*Sierra de Alhamilla
*Sierra Espuña
*Sierra Cabrera
*Sierra de las Estancias
*The Surco Intrabético comprises a series of valleys and depressions separating the Penibaetic from the Subbaetic System
===Subbaetic System===

The Subbaetic System occupies a central position within the Baetic System. Highest point high Peña de la Cruz in Sierra Arana.

<text>USS &quot;Hazard&quot; (AM-240) is an that served in the United States Navy during World War II.

==Service history==
&quot;Hazard&quot; was launched on 1 October 1944 and was commissioned on 30 December 1944. The vessel was built by the Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company of Winslow, Washington. &quot;Hazard&quot; was fitted for both wire and acoustic sweeping and could double as an anti-submarine warfare platform. The &quot;Admirable&quot; class of minesweepers were also used for patrol and escort duties.

&quot;Hazard&quot; first served in this capacity, escorting a convoy from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor, and then running with convoys to Eniwetok and Ulithi. In March 1945, the minesweeper was sent to Okinawa, where she first performed anti-submarine patrols before sweeping the waters off Kerama Retto in keeping with the minesweeper&#x27;s slogan, &quot;No Sweep, No Invasion.&quot;

At the war&#x27;s end the ship cleared the seas off Korea and Japan for the occupation forces.

Returning to the United States in 1946, &quot;Hazard&quot; was decommissioned and joined the reserve fleet. Stricken from the Navy Register in 1971, &quot;Hazard&quot; was purchased by a group of Omaha, Nebraska businessmen and placed on public display. Her paint job has since been restored to the camouflage paint she had during World War II. She is open to the public along with the submarine , an A-4 Skyhawk, an A-7 Corsair II, and an HH-52A Seaguard US Coast Guard helicopter at Freedom Park on the Missouri River waterfront in East Omaha.

&quot;Hazard&quot; earned three battle stars for her World War II service.

&quot;Hazard&quot; is a National Historic Landmark, the only &quot;Admirable&quot;-class minesweeper left in the United States. Her sister ship, was a museum ship in St. Louis until she was destroyed in the Great Flood of 1993.

<doc id="1185875" wikidata="Q7874850" url="?curid=1185875" title="USS Trenton (1876)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Trenton&quot; was a wooden-hulled screw steamer, classified as a screw frigate, in the United States Navy. She was named for Trenton, New Jersey.

&quot;Trenton&quot; was laid down by the New York Navy Yard in 1875; launched on 1 January 1876; sponsored by Miss Katherine M. Parker; and commissioned on 14 February 1877, Captain John Lee Davis in command.

The &quot;Trenton&quot; was the first US naval vessel to use electric lights, which were installed in 1883.

==Mediterranean, 1877-1881==
&quot;Trenton&quot; departed New York on 8 March 1877 and reached Villefranche, France on 18 April. The following day, Rear Admiral John L. Worden broke his flag in her, and she became flagship of the European Station. A week after, she reached the Mediterranean, Russia declared war on Turkey. Consequently, &quot;Trenton&quot; and the other ships of the squadron alternated tours of duty in the eastern Mediterranean protecting U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals resident in or visiting Turkish possessions. On 9 May, she departed Villefranche for Smyrna, Turkey, and – but for a run to Salonika from 9–13 June with – remained there until 25 August, when the flagship left the eastern Mediterranean behind to return to Villefranche. Next, &quot;Trenton&quot; visited Marseilles for two weeks in mid-September; then steamed back to Villefranche on the 18th and remained there until Christmas Day, when she put to sea to return to the eastern Mediterranean. Reentering Smyrna on the second day of 1878, she showed the flag there until 16 March, when she sailed for Piraeus, the port-city for Athens, Greece. On 2 April, she got underway again for Villefranche, touching at La Spezia and Leghorn in Italy &quot;en route&quot;.

On 17 July 1878, she headed for Gibraltar, and on the 24th exited the Mediterranean. She cruised north, visited Lisbon, Portugal; Cherbourg, France; and Yarmouth, England; and then returned to the Mediterranean, reaching Villefranche in mid-October. &quot;Trenton&quot; resumed her cruises between Mediterranean ports, adding Genoa, Naples, and Tangiers to her itinerary in the spring of 1879. In June, she again headed out through the Strait of Gibraltar to visit Portsmouth, England; Terneuzen, Netherlands; Antwerp, Belgium; and Copenhagen, Denmark. She was back at Villefranche late in September. In mid-November, she sailed to Gibraltar and waited there until 7 December for to arrive with &quot;Trenton&quot;″s replacement crew. The warship remained in the western Mediterranean until early April 1880.

On 3 April 1880, she headed east once more. After stops at Naples and at Alexandria, Egypt, the warship began cruising the Aegean again. She visited Smyrna, Tenedos, and Chamak Kelessi in Turkey as well as Piraeus before returning to Villefranche on 25 May. After a visit to Marseilles on 7 June, the flagship left the Mediterranean for the third time during this deployment and made another cruise to English, Belgian, and Dutch ports. Four of &quot;Trenton&quot;″s crew rescued fellow sailors from drowning during this period, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor: Seamen Philip Moore and John Russell at Genoa, Italy, on 21 September 1880, and Ordinary Seaman John Davis and Seaman Alexander Haure Turvelin at Toulon, France, in February 1881.

&quot;Trenton&quot; returned to the western Mediterranean in August and operated there until 7 September 1881, when she sailed for the U.S. She arrived in Hampton Roads on 12 October, and three days later moved up the York River for the Yorktown centennial celebration. On 22 October, the warship departed Yorktown and the following day arrived in the New York Navy Yard. There, she was decommissioned on 9 November 1881.

==Far East, 1883-1886==

Reactivated on 18 September 1883, &quot;Trenton&quot; departed New York in November for duty on the Asiatic Station. Steaming via the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, Ceylon, and Singapore, she arrived at Hong Kong on 1 May 1884 to begin two years of cruising in the Far East. She visited ports in China, Korea, and Japan, carrying out various diplomatic missions. On occasion, &quot;Trenton&quot; sent landing parties ashore in China and Korea to protect American nationals and other foreigners during periods of internal unrest. The warship completed this tour of duty in the spring of 1886; departed Yokohama, Japan on 9 May; retraced her voyage back across the Indian Ocean, through the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea, and across the Atlantic to reach Hampton Roads on 2 September. She entered the Norfolk Navy Yard on 9 September and was decommissioned for repairs on 17 September 1886.

==Pacific, 1887-1889==
On 16 May 1887, she was placed in commission once again. On 25 July, she exited Hampton Roads and headed south for Brazil. &quot;En route&quot;, &quot;Trenton&quot; stopped at St. Vincent in the Windward Islands and entered Rio de Janeiro on 10 September for a fortnight visit. After touching at St. Thomas on the return voyage, she dropped anchor in New York harbor on 3 November.

Almost three months later, on 30 January 1888, &quot;Trenton&quot; sailed for the Pacific. The voyage took her more than a year to complete, for she had to steam around Cape Horn at the southern end of South America. After stops at Panama and Tahiti, the warship reached Apia, Samoa, on 10 March 1889 and joined other units of the Pacific Squadron. Six days later, on 16 March 1889, a cyclone struck Apia and the thirteen ships anchored in her harbor.

For thirty-six hours the storm ravaged the harbor. The &quot;Trenton&quot;, having lost steam and rudder, was in imminent danger of foundering on the reef. An unusual maneuver suggested by Lieutenant Robert M. G. Brown, &quot;Trenton&quot;″s navigator, is credited for saving the flag ship from complete destruction. &quot;Trenton&quot;″s commander, Norman von Heldreich Farquhar, ordered every man into the port rigging. With the wind striking against the compact mass of bodies, which acted as a sail, the vessel was steered away from the reef and into the bay. &quot;Trenton&quot; collided with the SMS &quot;Olga&quot; and then floated toward the sinking . With her crew still in the rigging, the approach was slowed and another collision avoided with the &quot;Trenton&quot; safely maneuvered alongside the &quot;Vandalia&quot;. The &quot;Vandalia&quot;″s crew escaped to deck of the &quot;Trenton&quot;, saving many lives that otherwise might have been lost. Both ships were later abandoned.

Out of 450 men on the crew of &quot;Trenton&quot;, only one life (Landsman J. Hewlett) was lost. &quot;Trenton&quot; was declared a total loss, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 April 1891.

==Pioneer in Electricity for US Naval Vessels 1883==

&quot;Trenton&quot; was the first U.S. Navy ship to have electric lights. A dynamo, engine, and lights were installed in the summer of 1883. The successful use of electricity on this ship led to the installation of electricity on the first ships of the New Steel Navy.

<text>Port Waikato is a New Zealand town that sits on the south bank of the Waikato River, at its outflow into the Tasman Sea, in the northern Waikato.

Port Waikato is a well-known surfing and whitebaiting destination and a popular holiday spot. Fish can be caught off the rocks and surf beach, and off the sand dunes that border the river mouth. Flounder and mullet are also plentiful using drag nets. Port Waikato is a location where sedimentary rock formations of 65–85 million years&#x27; antiquity are found, and a Jurassic-period dinosaur fossil was found there. Weathertop footage from the Lord of the Rings was filmed in limestone outcrops just south of the town.

The Port has a Wharf Store, established 1893, a take-away shop, café, campground, library, community hall, fire station, surf lifesaving club, yachting club and an active fishing club. A school camp was established near the town in the 1920s, which boasts a well-formed BMX track. Port Waikato also serves as a popular wedding destination.

==History==

Port Waikato was an important port during the New Zealand Wars of the 19th century. It was the first of the colonial settlements to be constructed after the wars, being started in 1863. It had until then been called Putataka, but soon the present name was in general use. The Māori name remains for the hill above the town.

For many years Port Waikato was the transhipment point between ships of the Northern Steamship Co and the river steamers of the Waikato Shipping Co, run by Caesar Roose. The frequency increased to twice a week in 1924. At the same time a Cambridge to Port Waikato excursion was being run two or three times a year, taking 12 to 14 hours downstream and a few hours longer upstream. Now the only public transport is a morning and afternoon bus from Pukekohe on Thursdays.

<text>Several judges of the North Carolina Supreme Court and the North Carolina Court of Appeals, the state&#x27;s two appellate courts, were elected on November 2, 2004. The 2004 United States presidential election, 2004 United States House election, 2004 United States Senate election, 2004 North Carolina Council of State election and 2004 North Carolina General Assembly election were held on the same day.

Appellate judges in North Carolina are elected to eight-year terms in statewide judicial elections. In 2004, for the first time, all these elections were non-partisan. If more than two candidates filed for a given seat, a non-partisan primary would be held, and the two highest vote-getters, regardless of party, would advance to the general election. The only 2004 race in which more than two candidates filed for the primary was the Thornburg Court of Appeals seat.

==Supreme Court (Parker seat)==
Associate Justice Sarah Parker, the incumbent, was challenged by Court of Appeals Judge John M. Tyson.

===Results===
==Supreme Court (Orr seat)==
The resignation of Associate Justice Robert F. Orr, too late for a primary election to be held, led to a situation in which there was no primary election to eliminate candidates, but rather, the winner was simply determined by plurality. Eight candidates filed: Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Newby (who received the endorsement of the state Republican Party), North Carolina Superior Court Judge Howard Manning, Pre-Paid Legal Services attorney and former judicial law clerk Rachel Hunter, Administrative Law Judge Fred Morrison, attorney Ronnie Ansley, former appeals court judge Betsy McCrodden, current appeals court judge Jim Wynn, and attorney Marvin Schiller (who had just lost in the primary for the Thornburg Court of Appeals seat).

===Results===
==Court of Appeals (McGee seat)==
Incumbent Judge Linda McGee was challenged by attorney Bill Parker.

===Results===
==Court of Appeals (Bryant seat)==
Incumbent Judge Wanda G. Bryant had been appointed to the Court by the Governor following her 2002 defeat for a different seat. She was challenged by Wake County District Court Judge Alice Stubbs.

===Results===
==Court of Appeals (Thornburg seat)==
Incumbent Judge Alan Thornburg had been appointed to the court by the Governor. Three candidates filed to challenge Thornburg for a full term: Barbara Jackson, who was then general counsel at the N.C. Department of Labor, along with attorneys Marcus W. Williams and Marvin Schiller. Jackson and Thornburg finished first and second, respectively, in the July primary, thereby qualifying them to compete in the general election.

<text>Franchester Martin Brennaman (born July 28, 1942) is an American former sportscaster, best known for his long tenure as the play-by-play voice of Major League Baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds on the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network. Known for his opinionated, zealous, and occasionally contentious style, Brennaman called Reds games from 1974 to 2019.

==Early life==
A native of Portsmouth, Virginia, Brennaman attended Randolph-Macon College and the University of North Carolina, graduating from the latter institution with a communications degree in 1965. He began his broadcasting career at WGHP-TV in High Point, North Carolina, and followed with stints in Salisbury, North Carolina and Norfolk, Virginia. From 1970 to 1974, he called games for the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association.

In 1971, Brennaman began his career as a baseball radio announcer for the Tidewater Tides (now Norfolk Tides), the then-New York Mets&#x27; affiliate in the International League (Class AAA).

For the 1972 football season, he called the radio play-by-play action for the William &amp; Mary Indians (now nicknamed the Tribe).

In 1973, Virginia Tech athletic director Frank O. Moseley hired Brennaman to be the new voice of the Hokies. Brennaman was the first Tech broadcaster to call both football and basketball, but he left VT in 1974 to become the broadcaster for the Cincinnati Reds.

==Career==
Brennaman joined Joe Nuxhall on the Reds radio team in 1974. &quot;Marty and Joe&quot; became an institution in the city, appearing together in numerous radio and television commercials. Brennaman&#x27;s trademark call of a Reds victory (&quot;And this one belongs to the Reds!&quot;) was coined during his second game with the team. This same phrase was expected to be placed in lights, outside of the Great American Ball Park in 2003, but Hamilton County officials nixed the idea, citing that the ballpark belongs to the taxpayers and not the team. Instead, only Nuxhall&#x27;s signature signoff, &quot;...Rounding third and heading for home.&quot; was used.

On January 16, 2019, Brennaman announced he would retire following the 2019 season. He broadcast his final Reds game on September 26, 2019.

===Notable calls===
*Hank Aaron&#x27;s record-tying 714th career home run in 1974 (Brennaman&#x27;s first regular season game as a Reds announcer)
*Tom Seaver&#x27;s only career no-hitter in 1978 (when Seaver was a member of the Reds)
*Pete Rose&#x27;s record-breaking 4,192nd career hit in 1985
*Tom Browning&#x27;s perfect game in 1988
*Ken Griffey Jr.&#x27;s 500th career home run in 2004 and his 600th in 2008
*The Reds&#x27; World Series appearances in 1975, 1976, and 1990 (the first two for a nationwide audience on NBC television)
*Roy Halladay&#x27;s no-hitter (second in postseason history) in game one of the 2010 NLDS between Cincinnati and Philadelphia.
* Jay Bruce&#x27;s walk-off home run to clinch the NL Central divisional title for the Reds in 2010
*Homer Bailey&#x27;s no-hitters against the Pirates in 2012 and against the Giants in 2013
*Jake Arrieta&#x27;s no-hitter against the Reds in 2016

==Accolades==
In 1999, Brennaman was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame.

In 2000, Marty Brennaman won the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually by the National Baseball Hall of Fame to a broadcaster &quot;for major contributions to the game of baseball&quot;.

The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association (NSSA) has named Brennaman as Ohio Sportscaster of the Year 16 times and Virginia Sportscaster of the Year four times, for his versatility in calling baseball, football, and basketball games on both the collegiate and professional levels. In addition to the Virginia Squires and the Norfolk Tides, he has called games for the Indiana Pacers, Virginia Tech, and William and Mary, as well as NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournament games.

In 2005, Brennaman was inducted into both the NSSA Hall of Fame and the National Radio Hall of Fame.

On August 16, 2019, it was announced that Brennaman will be the only inductee to the Cincinnati Reds Hall Of Fame &amp; Museum in 2020; the induction ceremony was scheduled to take place on April 26, 2020, but the ceremony eventually was pushed back to August 27, 2021, due to concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Controversies==
In 1988, Brennaman and Nuxhall appeared before National League President A. Bartlett Giamatti at the NL office, in New York City in regard to accusations that Brennaman incited the crowd to cause a delay of game after an altercation between Reds manager Pete Rose and umpire Dave Pallone. After Rose was ejected from the game and Brennaman criticized Pallone during the live radio broadcast, fans littered the field with debris, leading to a game delay. Brennaman had this to say regarding the incident.

&quot;I still maintain we were right&quot;, Brennaman said. &quot;I&#x27;ll never apologize for that. They accused us of inciting a riot. I don&#x27;t think we did then and I don&#x27;t think we did now.&quot;

On June 12, 2007, Brennaman made an on-air apology during the Cincinnati Reds Radio Network broadcast for a comment he had recently made comparing an upcoming road trip to the Bataan Death March. The Reds, who at the time held the worst record in the National League, were set to face the Oakland Athletics, the Seattle Mariners and Philadelphia Phillies on the road trip.

On April 17, 2008, during the top of the eighth inning of a game between the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Brennaman made comments about Cubs fans and the Cubs team. This occurred after then-Reds player Adam Dunn connected for a home run. Several baseballs, including the home run ball, were thrown onto the field, resulting in a game delay as the field crew recovered the debris. Said Brennaman:

&quot;This is the kind of thing, quite honestly, right now, that makes you want to see the Chicago Cubs team lose. Among all baseball fans, and I can&#x27;t attest to the Yankees or Red Sox, because we don&#x27;t see them with any degree of regularity unless it&#x27;s inter-league play, but far and away the most obnoxious fans in baseball, in this league, are those who follow this team right here. Throwing 15 or 18 balls onto the field, there&#x27;s absolutely no excuse for that, and that is so typical of Chicago Cubs fans. It&#x27;s unbelievable.&quot;
&quot;You simply root against &#x27;em. Y&#x27;know, I&#x27;ve said all winter they talked about this team winning the division, and my comment is they won&#x27;t win it, because at the end of the day, they still are the Chicago Cubs, and they will figure out a way to screw this whole thing up.&quot;

On April 18, 2008, Brennaman appeared in an interview on Chicago sports radio station WMVP-AM 1000 in which he reinforced his position on Cubs fans, and compared Chicago Cubs fans to rival St. Louis Cardinals fans. 
&quot;If they can&#x27;t understand what happened Wednesday night was completely over the top, then I&#x27;m sorry&quot;, Brennaman said. &quot;I said how tough it is to root for the Cubs. I think a lot of people feel the same way I do, but they won&#x27;t articulate it. I&#x27;m not afraid to say what I think.&quot;&quot;[Compared to Cubs fans] Cardinals fans are hands down the best in baseball. They respect the game. They don&#x27;t go to the game to do stupid stuff.&quot;&quot;The Cubs have some great baseball fans. But the ones who act like idiots (ruin) it for people like me.&quot;

On February 5, 2010, Brennaman was chastised for commenting that Marshall University&#x27;s president must be &quot;queer&quot; for softball at the university&#x27;s baseball banquet and fundraiser. Brennaman stated, &quot;I probably could have made a better choice of words, but in no way does that reflect my opinion about gays at all. It&#x27;s just a comment I made about the president of the university.&quot;
==Personal life==
Brennaman has three children. His son, Thom, and daughter, Dawn, are children from his first marriage. He also has a daughter, Ashley, from his second marriage. He has seven grandchildren. He is married to Amanda Ingram. Thom, also a broadcaster, worked with the Reds, the Chicago Cubs, Arizona Diamondbacks, and was the number two baseball play-by-play man (behind Joe Buck) on Fox Sports&#x27; Major League Baseball broadcasts. Thom now works for the ACC, calling college football and basketball.

On October 4, 2006, the Cincinnati Reds re-hired Thom to join his father in the radio booth as well as do play-by-play on television starting with the 2007 season..

After years of making good-natured fun of his longtime broadcast partner, the late Joe Nuxhall, for playing golf, Brennaman is now an avid golfer himself and speaks of the sport often during his broadcasts. The Marty Brennaman Golf Classic takes place annually at Maketewah CC.

<doc id="1185889" wikidata="Q979744" url="?curid=1185889" title="Electric toothbrush">
<text>An electric toothbrush, motorized toothbrush, or battery-powered toothbrush is a toothbrush that makes rapid automatic bristle motions, either back-and-forth oscillation or rotation-oscillation (where the brush head alternates clockwise and counterclockwise rotation), in order to clean teeth. Motions at sonic speeds or below are made by a motor. In the case of ultrasonic toothbrushes, ultrasonic motions are produced by a piezoelectric crystal. A modern electric toothbrush is usually powered by a rechargeable battery charged through inductive charging when the brush sits in the charging base between uses.

Electric toothbrushes can be classified according to the frequency (speed) of their movements as power, sonic or ultrasonic toothbrushes, depending on whether they make movements that are below, in or above the audible range (20–20,000 Hz or 2400–2,400,000 movements per minute), respectively.

== History ==
The earliest example of an electric toothbrush was first produced by Tomlinson Moseley. Sold as the Motodent, a patent was filed by his company, Motodent Inc. on December 13, 1937. In Switzerland in 1954 Dr. Philippe Guy Woog invented the Broxodent. Woog&#x27;s electric toothbrushes were originally manufactured in Switzerland (later in France) for Broxo S.A. The device plugged into a standard wall outlet and ran on line voltage. Electric toothbrushes were initially created for patients with limited motor skills and for orthodontic patients (such as those with braces).

The Broxo Electric Toothbrush was introduced in the US by E. R. Squibb and Sons Pharmaceuticals in 1960. After introduction, it was marketed in the US by Squibb under the names Broxo-Dent or Broxodent. In the 1980s Squibb transferred distribution of the Broxodent line to the Somerset Labs division of Bristol-Myers Squibb.

The General Electric automatic toothbrush was introduced in the early 1960s; it was cordless, with rechargeable NiCad batteries and although portable, was rather bulky, about the size of a two-D-cell flashlight handle. NiCad batteries of this period suffered from the memory effect. The GE automatic toothbrush came with a charging stand that held the hand piece upright; most units were kept in the charger, which is not the best way to get maximum service life from a NiCad battery. Also, early NiCad batteries tended to have a short lifespan. The batteries were sealed inside the GE device, and the whole unit had to be discarded when the batteries failed.

The use of an AC line voltage appliance in a bathroom environment was problematic. By the early 1990s Underwriter Laboratories (UL) and Canadian Standards Association (CSA) no longer certified line-voltage appliances for bathroom use. Newer appliances had to use a step-down transformer to operate at low voltage (typically 12, 16 or 24 volts). Wiring standards in many countries require that outlets in bath areas must be protected by a RCD/GFCI device (e.g., required in the US since the 1970s on bathroom outlets in new construction).

By the 1990s there were problems with safety certification of Broxo&#x27;s original design. Further, improved battery-operated toothbrushes were providing formidable competition.

The first ultrasonic toothbrush, first called the Ultima and later the Ultrasonex, was patented in the US in 1992, the same year the FDA gave it approval for daily home use. Initially, the Ultima worked only on ultrasound, but a few years later, a motor was added to give the Ultrasonex brush additional sonic vibration. Today, several ultrasonic toothbrushes simultaneously provide both ultrasound and sonic vibration. In more modern times, electric toothbrushes have been used as a substitute for vibrators for those who wish to avoid embarrassment.

The negative environmental impact of electric toothbrushes when compared with manual toothbrushes has been established.

== Types ==

Electric toothbrushes can be classified according to their type of action:

* Side to side vibration, which has a brush head action that moves laterally from side to side.
* Counter oscillation, which has a brush action in which adjacent tufts of bristles (usually six to 10 in number) rotate in one direction and then the other, independently, with each tuft rotating in the opposite direction to that adjacent to it.
* Rotation oscillation, which has a brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction and then the other.
* Circular, which has a brush action in which the brush head rotates in one direction only.
* Ultrasonic, which has a brush action where the bristles vibrate at ultrasonic frequencies (&gt; 20 kHz).
* Ionic, which has a brush that aims to impart an electrical charge to the tooth surface with the intent of disrupting the attachment of dental plaque.

For some vibrating toothbrush designs, a brushing technique similar to that used with a manual toothbrush is recommended, whereas with brushes with a spinning head the recommended cleaning technique is to simply move the brush slowly from tooth to tooth.

Electric toothbrushes can also be classified according to the speed of their movements as standard power toothbrushes, sonic toothbrushes or ultrasonic toothbrushes. If the motion of the toothbrush is sufficiently rapid to produce a hum in the audible frequency of human range (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz), it can be classified as a sonic toothbrush. Any electric toothbrush with movement faster than this limit can be classified as an ultrasonic toothbrush. Certain ultrasonic toothbrushes, such as the Megasonex and the Ultreo, have both sonic and ultrasonic movements.

=== Oscillating rotating ===

The oscillating rotating toothbrush is a type of electric toothbrush which was introduced by Oral-B in the 1990s. This type of toothbrush is not shaped like a conventional manual toothbrush. Instead, it is made of a small round brush head that oscillates and rotates to remove plaque. The shape of the brush head is very similar to the prophylaxis hand piece used by dental professionals to remove plaque in the dental office. This design enables the bristles to reach further into the hard-to-reach areas between the teeth to remove plaque. Some versions of the oscillating rotating toothbrush also involve a pulsating motion which enables a more three dimensional clean.

The Oral-B iO toothbrush has a linear magnetic drive system. This system allows the concentration of energy to be at the tip of the brush bristles while using the oscillating rotating motion. The brush also allows for 3D tracking using artificial intelligence that connects the toothbrush with an app. This technology enables the user to have instant feedback on their brushing efficacy and can track the data if the user wishes to bring the information to their dental professional for more personalized oral health instruction and education. Furthermore, the Oral-B iO toothbrush also has a smart pressure sensor which is electronically calibrated to let the user know if they are brushing with too much pressure, or not enough, and automatically adapts the oscillation speed to protect the teeth and gums when excess pressure is applied.

The safety of oscillating rotating toothbrushes has also been studied. Oscillating rotating toothbrushes are proven to be safe as compared to manual toothbrushes and are safe for both the hard and soft tissues of the oral cavity.

=== Sonic ===

Sonic toothbrushes are a subset of electric toothbrushes with movement that is fast enough to produce vibration in the audible range. Most modern rechargeable electric toothbrushes from brands such as Sonicare, FOREO, and Oral-B fall into this category and typically have frequencies that range from 200 to 400 Hz, that is 12,000–24,000 oscillations or 24,000–48,000 movements per minute. Because sonic toothbrushes rely on sweeping motion alone to clean the teeth, the movement that they provide is often high in amplitude, meaning that the length of the sweeping movements that they make is large. One study found that using a sonic toothbrush causes less abrasion to the gum when compared to the manual toothbrush.

=== Ultrasonic ===
The newest developments in this field are ultrasonic toothbrushes, which use ultrasonic waves to clean the teeth. In order for a toothbrush to be considered &quot;ultrasonic&quot; it has to emit a wave at a minimum frequency of 20,000 Hz or 2.4 million movements per minute. Typically, ultrasonic toothbrushes approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) operate at a frequency of 1.6 MHz, which translates to 192 million movements per minute.

Ultrasonic toothbrushes emit vibrations that are very high in frequency but low in amplitude. These vibrations break up bacterial chains that make up dental plaque and remove their methods of attachment to the tooth surface up to 5 mm below the gum line.

Some ultrasonic toothbrushes, such as the Emmi-Dent, provide only ultrasonic motion. Other ultrasonic toothbrushes, such as the Ultreo and the Megasonex, provide additional sonic vibration ranging from 9,000 to 40,000 movements per minute, comparable to a sonic toothbrush, in order to provide additional sweeping motion which facilitates removal of food particles and bacterial chain remnants. The sonic vibration in these ultrasonic toothbrushes may be lower in amplitude than that found in a comparable sonic toothbrush because the bacterial chains do not need to be removed through sonic vibration, simply swept away, as they have already been broken up by the ultrasound.

Because of the similarity of the terms &quot;ultrasonic&quot; and &quot;sonic&quot;, there is some confusion in the marketplace and sonic toothbrushes are frequently mislabeled as ultrasonic ones. A toothbrush operating at a frequency or vibration of less than 20,000 Hz is a &quot;sonic&quot; toothbrush. It is called &quot;sonic&quot; because its operating frequency, for example 31,000 movements per minute, is within the human hearing range of between roughly 20 Hz to about 20,000 Hz. Only a toothbrush that emits ultrasound, or vibration at a frequency greater than the upper limit of human hearing, can be called an &quot;ultrasonic&quot; toothbrush.

== Effectiveness ==
In 2014, a Cochrane review demonstrated that power toothbrushes remove more plaque and reduce gingival inflammation more than manual toothbrushes. This review showed electric toothbrushes had greater effectiveness over manual ones. For example, plaque build-up and gingival inflammation were reduced by 11% and 6% respectively after one to three months of use. After three months of use, the reduction observed was even greater – 21% reduction in plaque and 11% reduction in gingival inflammation. Although the scale of these differences in a clinical setting remains questionable, other reviews have reached similar conclusions. Another large review of studies also concluded that power toothbrushes were more effective in removing plaque than manual brushes for children. For patients with limited manual dexterity or where difficulty exists in reaching rear teeth, electric toothbrushes may be especially beneficial.

With regards to the effectiveness of different electric toothbrushes, the oscillation rotation models have been found to remove more plaque than manual toothbrushes. More specific studies have also been conducted demonstrating oscillating rotating toothbrush effectiveness to be superior to manual toothbrushes for patients undergoing orthodontic treatment. Only the oscillating rotating power toothbrush was able to consistently provide statistically significant benefit over manual toothbrushes in the 2014 Cochrane Review. This suggests that oscillating rotating power toothbrushes may be more effective than other electric toothbrushes. More recent evidence also supports this as new studies suggest that oscillating rotating toothbrushes are more effective than high frequency sonic power toothbrushes. Overall, oscillating rotating toothbrushes are effective in reducing gingival inflammation and plaque.

Other factors that influence effectiveness amongst electric toothbrushes involve factors such as the amount of time spent brushing and the condition of the brush head. Manufacturers recommend that heads be changed every three months or as soon as the brush head has visibly deteriorated.

== Power source and charging ==
Modern electric toothbrushes run on low voltage, 12 V or less. A few units use a step-down transformer to power the brush, but most use a battery, usually but not always rechargeable and non-replaceable, fitted inside the handle, which is hermetically sealed to prevent water damage. While early NiCd battery toothbrushes used metal tabs to connect with the charging base, some toothbrushes use inductive charging.

== Environmental concerns ==
According to Friends of the Earth, &quot;Disposable electric toothbrushes are one example of a terrible product ... it&#x27;s virtually impossible to separate out the tech from the batteries and plastic casing which means valuable and often toxic materials are dumped in landfill or burnt in incinerators.&quot; A study published in British Dental Journal found climate change potential of the electric toothbrush was 11 times greater than the bamboo toothbrush. The bamboo toothbrush was, however, not the most environmentally sustainable toothbrush, contrary to popular belief because using them just stops land from being put to better use such as helping biodiversity, or in growing forests to offset carbon emissions. A plastic manual replaceable head toothbrush was probably the best, according to the study.

== Optional features ==

=== Timer ===
Many modern electric toothbrushes have a timer that buzzes, or briefly interrupts power, typically after two minutes, and sometimes every 30 seconds. This is associated with a customary recommendation to brush for two minutes, 30 seconds for each of the four quadrants of the mouth.

=== Display ===
Some electric toothbrushes have LCD screens that show brushing time and sometimes smiley face icons or other images to encourage optimal brushing. These features could encourage people to brush more accurately.

=== Pressure sensor ===
Brushing teeth too hard causes enamel and gum damage. Most modern top-end sonic toothbrushes come with a pressure sensor, which prevents users from brushing too aggressively. There are two types of pressure sensors. Some sensors produce a sound warning and some immediately stop movements of the sonic toothbrush when it is used too aggressively. Some electric brushes, such as the Oral-B oscillating rotating brush, simultaneously coach the user to brush with optimal pressure during the brushing experience itself using AI and Bluetooth technology.

=== Ultrasound indicator ===
Because ultrasonic frequencies are beyond the audible range and the amplitude of movement emitted by an ultrasonic toothbrush is typically too small to be perceived, the ultrasound is imperceptible to humans and it may not be apparent that a brush running if pure ultrasound is turned on. Ultrasonic toothbrushes may include an indicator to notify the user that ultrasound is being emitted.

=== Bluetooth ===

Bluetooth connectivity enables data to be transmitted from an electric toothbrush to another Bluetooth device, such as a smartphone. The brush can send data to a mobile app such as how long it has been brushing for and if too much pressure has been applied when brushing. The app can in turn send data back to the brush such as changing the cleaning modes available, and cleaning time. The sharing of data between toothbrush and smartphone is intended to assist the user in creating better brushing technique and habits. This technology enables coaching for the user as it tracks where the user brushes, how long in each area, and consequently, can identify areas where the user commonly misses. 
Electric toothbrush models that currently utilise Bluetooth include the Oral-B Pro 6000, Pro 6500, Pro 7000 and Genius 9000, Oral-B iO as well as Phillips Sonicare Diamond Clean Smart.

== Cleaning modes ==
Most sonic toothbrushes come with different cleaning modes and intensity levels. Cleaning modes are designed for special types of cleaning efficiency. Some of the most well known are Sensitive, Daily care, Whitening and Tongue cleaning.

Certain toothbrushes that offer both ultrasonic and sonic motion allow for the intensity of the sonic motion to be reduced, or even for the sonic motion to be turned off entirely so that only ultrasound is emitted. Since ultrasound movements are very low in amplitude, this setting may be indicated for patients who may not be suitable candidates for typical sonic or power toothbrush vibration but need the additional cleaning power of an ultrasonic toothbrush, such as patients who have recently undergone periodontal surgery.

<text>Mangakino is a small town on the banks of the Waikato River in the North Island of New Zealand. It is located close to the hydroelectric power station at Lake Maraetai, southeast of Hamilton. The town and its infrastructure are administered as the Mangakino Pouakani ward by the Taupō District Council.

==History and culture==

In 1896, (after 40 years of resistance) the British Crown acquired the Wairarapa Lakes from Ngāti Kahungunu and in 1915, gave in return land in middle North Island, land known as part of the Pouakani Block. At that time the land where Mangakino lies today was described as native bush and pumice wastelands, barren, unoccupied and unfarmed. In 1946, as the Karapiro Dam neared completion, workers were to transfer to the next dam construction site – &#x27;Maraetai I&#x27;, near Mangakino. The Crown, under the Public Works Act, reacquired a portion of the unoccupied Pouakani Block alongside the Waikato River to build a &quot;hydroelectric station&quot; and a temporary township, &quot;Mangakino&quot;, was established to house the hundreds of construction workers needed. The town was only ever meant to be there on a temporary basis until the completion of the proposed dams.

The city planner Ernst Plischke who emigrated from Austria in 1939 developed a plan for the town centre of Mangakino, which was put into action in 1947–1948. His plan included a pedestrian area in the town centre free from through traffic.

In 1952 the population exceeded 5,000. Mangakino also serviced the construction of Ātiamuri and Ohakuri hydro schemes further upstream which were commissioned in 1959 and 1961 respectively. Mangakino and to a lesser extent Whakamaru and Ātiamuri, owe their existence to the hydro schemes and the roads constructed gave access which allowed development of the land for farming in the 1960s. The decline for Mangakino occurred after the hydro dams were commissioned and over time communities such as Maraetai and Waipapa disappeared altogether.

In 2001, the Mangakino Township Incorporation obtained approval through the Māori Land Court to legally change the title of the majority of residential sections in Mangakino from Māori land to General title. They then put Mangakino’s 500+ leasehold sections on the market as a single purchase. In July 2002, the majority of the town’s sections were sold to MV Properties of Pukekohe. A stipulation of the tender was that residents would be given the first opportunity to purchase their perpetually leased sections. The land valuations that had been exceedingly low for decades, then skyrocketed. Some locals chose to freehold their homes immediately, empty sections without current leases were sold on the open market. Many residents continue to remain perpetual leaseholders.

===Marae===

Pouākani Marae and its meeting house, Tamatea Pokai Whenua, is a meeting place for Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa. The marae was first built in 1972 on land exchanged for Lake Wairarapa for Ngāti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa members and other Māori who were working on the dam. The marae was destroyed by arson in 2007 but reopened in 2012 after five years of reconstruction.

In October 2020, the Government committed $4,525,105 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Pouākani Marae and 9 other marae, creating 35 jobs.

Miringa te Kakara Marae and Te Whetū Marama o Ngā Tau o Hinawa meeting house are a meeting place of Ngāti Maniapoto and Rereahu.

==Demographics==
Statistics New Zealand describes Mangakino as a rural settlement, which covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. The settlement is part of the larger Marotiri statistical area.
