<text>Eustáquio van Lieshout, SSCC (also Eustachius or Eustache; November 3, 1890 – August 30, 1943) was a Dutch Catholic missionary priest in Brazil from the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary.

He was beatified in 2006 by Cardinal José Saraiva Martins on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI.

==Life==
He was born Huub van Lieshout on November 3, 1890 in Aarle-Rixtel in the province of Brabant, the eighth of eleven children. His family was a very Catholic rural family. In 1903, he was enrolled in the Latin school in Gemert. After reading the biography of Damien de Veuster, van Lieshout transferred in 1905 to the minor seminary of the Picpus Fathers, becoming a member of the Congregation in 1913, at which time he received the religious name of Eustachius.

Upon completion of his theological studies in 1919, he was ordained a priest in August 1919. His first assignment was as assistant novice master for his order. He was then assigned to the towns of Maassluis and Roelofarendsveen in South Holland, where he provided pastoral care for the many Belgian refugees. In recognition of his work, the King of Belgium knighted him in the Order of Leopold. He then spent two years in Roelofarendsveen as a parochial vicar. In 1924 he was sent to Spain to learn Spanish, in anticipation of an assignment in Uruguay. However, he ended up being sent to Brazil, where the language was Portuguese.

=== Career in Brazil ===
Van Lieshout, along with two other Picpus priests and three lay brothers, was sent to Brazil, in response to an appeal for help by a local bishop. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 12 of May 1925 and had to wait until the 15th of July when he was appointed pastor for the town of Agua Suja in Romaria. The inhabitants in parish of Agua Suja, where he served as a pastor, were occupied in searching gold along the shores of the river Bagagem. These people being deeply Catholics didn&#x27;t meet the Catholic behavior in their common life. Van Lieshout saw his apostolic aim to change them and, with the course of time, he managed to do this because people in his parish gradually acquired the taste to the virtuous life.
In 1935 he was sent by his religious superiors to Poá. After news spread of van Lieshout&#x27;s transfer, the population of the town started a bloodless uprising to stop him from leaving. Nevertheless, he left in obedience to his superiors for his new parish, where he worked to oppose the widespread practice of Candomblé. His blessings and cures of the sick through the intercession of St. Joseph made the little village a noted center of pilgrimage.

This, however, brought major problems to the town. Railroads were not able to furnish transportation for the great crowds; the lack of adequate housing meant that sanitary conditions were inadequate to the need. The police were no longer able to maintain order. Merchants sold bad food at high prices and thieves roamed the pilgrimage area preying on innocent victims. Van Lieshout was ordered to leave the parish to prevent these conditions from continuing. Despite this, tremendous crowds followed him everywhere. Brazilian authorities became so alarmed that they ordered him out of towns and villages. No one had anything against him, but they were afraid of the crowds and the commotion that would follow him.

The Cardinal Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro instructed van Lieshout to leave the capital by midnight. Subsequently, a fanatical crowd blocked traffic and invaded church rectories looking for him. He left Poá in May 1941.

Somehow, he managed to find a hiding place and passed a year in peace and happiness. His final appointment was as pastor of Belo Horizonte, where he lived the last two years of his life. He was given an assistant who was able to control the crowds. No one was permitted to enter the rectory without a letter of introduction. In this fashion, van Lieshout was able to devote his complete energy to the work of his parish. After a week of sickness caused by an insect bite, he died on August 30, 1943. He spent his last years in the precincts of Celeste Império around Jardim Montanhês, where he served his masses in chapel Cristo Rei. He travelled a lot all around the area and resumed his mission in the following words &quot;health and peace&quot; towards the faith and charity.
At his death, on his body was found a penitential pointed iron chain, buried so deep in his flesh that it could not be removed without tearing the flesh. Miracles are attributed to him. At first he was buried at the church of Santo Domingo, Belo Horizonte. But then he was reinterred at the church of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, Belo Horizonte in 1949.

==Beatification==
Eustáquio van Lieshout was venerated on April 12, 2003 by Pope John Paul II (decree of heroic virtues). Following a papal rescript of December 19, 2005, which declared authentic a miracle attributed to his intercession, van Lieshout was beatified in Belo Horizonte on June 15, 2006, the Feast of Corpus Christi that year, at a service led by the Archbishop of Belo Horizonte, Walmor de Oliveira de Azevedo. It was presided over by Cardinal José Saraiva Martins, Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, acting on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI.

<text>Disney Interactive Studios, Inc. was an American video game developer and publisher owned by The Walt Disney Company through Disney Interactive. Prior to its closure in 2016, it developed and distributed multi-platform video games and interactive entertainment worldwide.

Most of the games released by Disney Interactive Studios were typically tie-in products to existing character franchises. On May 10, 2016, as a result of the discontinuation of its &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; series, Disney shut down Disney Interactive Studios, and exited the first-party home console game development business in order to focus on third-party development of home console video games through other developers. However, it continues to release games for iOS and Android mobile devices under its own label, Disney Mobile. Disney Electronic Content is a spiritual successor to the company.

==History==
===1988–1994: Walt Disney Computer Software===
Disney established its own in house gaming unit, Walt Disney Computer Software, Inc. (WDCS), and it was incorporated on September 15, 1988. WDCS generally used third-party development studios to design spin-off games using its existing portfolio of characters. WDCS failed to meet the high expectations that came with the Disney name, although three of its self-published computer titles – &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Runaway Zoo&quot;, &quot;Donald&#x27;s Alphabet Chase&quot; and &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; – sold more than 100,000 copies, the industry equivalent of earning a Gold Record. The underlying issues were later attributed by senior Disney executives as being due to low product quality and lack of understanding of the differences between film and games.

WDCS also published a series of Nintendo (NES) and Gameboy platform game titles with Japanese video game company Capcom. Of these titles, 1989&#x27;s &quot;DuckTales&quot; received the most commercial and critical success, selling approximately 1.67 million and 1.43 million copies worldwide respectively, each becoming Capcom&#x27;s highest-selling titles for their respective platforms. Produced by founding WDCS producer Darlene Waddington, &quot;DuckTales&quot;″ Gameboy version was named &quot;Gameboy Game of the Year&quot; by &quot;PC Player Magazine&quot;. &quot;DuckTales&quot; continues to be considered a game with high nostalgic interest and was remade in 2013 as &quot;DuckTales: Remastered&quot;.

Following &quot;DuckTales,&quot; WDCS developed and published another NES platform game with Capcom, &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;. &quot;Rescue Rangers&quot; proved to be a commercial success, selling approximately 1.2 million copies worldwide, becoming Capcom&#x27;s fourth highest-selling game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Continuing with the success of these titles, Disney continued to find success with another Capcom developed title, &quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (developed by Westwood Studios) in 1993 and 1994 respectively. This led to a move from self-developed and self-published to funding and development management of games with third parties published the game.

===1994–2002: Disney Interactive===

Using the film studio style formula, WDCS was reorganized into Disney Interactive, Inc. (DI) on December 5, 1994 with the merging of WDCS and Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications. On April 15, 1997, Disney Interactive reduced its staff by 20%, effectively ending all in-house video game production. This increased the requests for licensing from third-party games companies. Under this plan, development and production cost risks were transferred to the game companies but reduced the per-unit revenue generated to Disney and effectively yielded a near 100 percent margin of licensed game sales. A thirteen-game agreement was made between Nintendo of America and Disney Interactive in 1999 for both the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color.

In May 2001, the company signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment to allow the latter to publish titles based on &quot;&quot;, &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot;, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot;, and &quot;Peter Pan: Return to Never Land&quot; on the PlayStation and PlayStation 2.

In European territories, Infogrames formerly distributed several of Disney Interactive&#x27;s PC titles, however, this agreement was later replaced with several separate distribution deals, including JoWooD Productions in Germany.

===2003–2007: Buena Vista Games===
In 2003, Disney announced in their 2003 strategic review that they would re-enter the core publishing market and rebranded Disney Interactive, Inc. as Buena Vista Games, Inc. (BVG) The Disney Interactive and Buena Vista Interactive brands were retained as publishing labels for children&#x27;s and core titles respectively.

On April 19, 2005, Buena Vista Games announced that they had entered the game development market. The company formed Propaganda Games, based in Vancouver, British Columbia; which was made up of former employees at EA Canada, and purchased Avalanche Software in Salt Lake City, Utah for an undisclosed amount. On May 13, 2005, the company announced they had acquired the video game rights to the &quot;Turok&quot; franchise from owners Classic Media; which had been previously held by Acclaim Entertainment.

On April 27, 2006, Buena Vista Games entered into a publishing agreement with Japanese developer Q Entertainment where the company would publish four of the developer&#x27;s titles globally except in Asia; including a Disney-themed version of &quot;Meteos&quot;. In September, Buena Vista expanded their developer cycle by purchasing Climax Racing from the Climax Group and formed Fall Line Studios in November to create casual titles for the Nintendo DS and the Wii consoles.

===2007–2014: Disney Interactive Studios===
On February 8, 2007, The Walt Disney Company renamed Buena Vista Games to Disney Interactive Studios as part of a larger company initiative to phase out the Buena Vista brand that year. The studio publishes both Disney and non-Disney branded video games for all platforms worldwide, with titles that feature its consumer brands including Disney, ABC, ESPN, and Touchstone (which is used as a label for Disney). In July 2007, the studio acquired Junction Point Studios.

On June 5, 2008, Disney Interactive Studios and the Walt Disney Internet Group, merged into a single business unit now known as the Disney Interactive Media Group, and it merged its subsidiary Fall Line Studios with its sister studio, Avalanche Software, in January 2009. In February 2009, Disney Interactive acquired Gamestar, a Chinese game development company. On September 8, 2009, Disney Interactive announced that it had acquired Wideload Games.

In November 2010, the executive Graham Hopper left the company. He announced his departure via an internal e-mail saying &quot;the time has come for me to move on from the company and set my sights on new horizons.&quot;

DIS in October 2012 announced &quot;Toy Box&quot;, a cross platform gaming initiative where Pixar and Disney characters will interact from a console game to multiple mobile and online applications. The first Toy Box cross platform game is &quot;Disney Infinity&quot; based on the &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; game&#x27;s Toy Box mode crossed with a toy line.

After the purchase of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney Interactive assumed the role of developing &quot;Star Wars&quot; games for the casual gaming market, while Electronic Arts would develop &quot;Star Wars&quot; games for the core gaming market through an exclusive license (although LucasArts did retain the ability to license &quot;Star Wars&quot; games to other developers for the casual gaming market).

At E3 2013, Disney and Square Enix released a teaser trailer for &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, after going seven years of not declaring any console &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game since &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. The game would release nearly six years later in January 2019.

Disney Interactive Studios has lost more than $200 million per year from 2008 to 2012 during a period in which it shut down Propaganda Games, Black Rock Studio and Junction Point Studios and its co-president John Pleasants stepped down in November 2013 after the launch of &quot;Disney Infinity&quot;.

===2014–2016: Decline and dissolution===
On March 6, 2014, 700 employees were laid off. After the cancellation of &quot;Disney Infinity&quot;, Disney Interactive Studios closed in 2016.

==List of games==

The company also publishes games from &quot;Q Entertainment&quot; worldwide except Asia: &quot;Lumines II&quot;, the sequel to the puzzle game for the PSP system; &quot;Lumines Plus&quot;, a new version of &quot;Lumines&quot; for the PlayStation 2; &quot;Every Extend Extra&quot;, a puzzle shooter; and a Disney Interactive Studios&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the popular &quot;Meteos&quot; game for the Nintendo DS with Disney characters.

The company revealed a lineup of games at E3 2006, which include DIE&#x27;s &quot;Turok&quot;, a re-imagining of the video game series of the same name and &quot;Desperate Housewives: The Game&quot;, based on the hit television show.

Disney Interactive Studios is credited in all entries to the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; franchise, with the original release box art of each entry to the series having different logos and name of the company seeing as coincidentally, the company is re-branded in between the releases. Notably however, the company is not credited to actually developing the game.

<text>The Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG) is a part of the Australian Department of Defence, which provides science and technology support to Defence and defence industry. The agency&#x27;s name was changed from Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) on 1 July 2015. It is Australia&#x27;s second largest government-funded science organisation after the CSIRO and its research outcomes have supported operations for over 100 years.

The Chief Defence Scientist leads DSTG. The position is supported by an independent Advisory Board with representatives from defence, industry, academia and the science community. DSTG employs over 2500 staff, predominantly scientists, engineers, IT specialists and technicians.

DSTG has establishments in all Australian states and the Australian Capital Territory with representatives in Washington, London and Tokyo. It collaborates with science and technology organisations around the world to strengthen its technology base and works with Australian industry and universities to enhance defence capability. DSTG is a member of The Technical Cooperation Program (TTCP) with the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. It also has bilateral defence science agreements with USA, UK, France, Sweden, Netherlands, Norway and Singapore. In February 2012, DSTG was given the whole-of-government responsibility to co-ordinate research and development for Australia&#x27;s national security.

==History==

<text>The Daihatsu Mira (also known as the Cuore, Domino, and more recently Charade) was a kei-type city car built by Japanese car maker Daihatsu. It was built with a variety of options and chassis variations, with the latest variant having four models: Mira, Mira AVY, Mira Gino, and Mira VAN. The Mira is the latest successor to the line of cars begun with the Daihatsu Fellow of 1966, and was originally introduced as the commercial version of the Cuore. Outside of Japan, the Mira has also been offered with larger 850 or 1000-cc engines. In Australia, the two-seater version was marketed as the Daihatsu Handivan and later as the Daihatsu Handi. The term &quot;&quot; means &quot;to see&quot; in Spanish and &quot;goal&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot; in Latin.

==History==
The Daihatsu Mira and Cuore replaced the Daihatsu Max Cuore in July 1980. This was replaced by the second generation (L70) of the Mira/Cuore, which was introduced in 1985. For most generations, two engine sizes were available, one smaller version, to suit Japanese domestic regulations of either 550 or 660 cc, and a bigger-engined version for export markets. The L200 variant (1990–94), for instance, came with a three-cylinder 660-cc engine with in Japan, while other parts of the world received a stronger variant with an 847- or 1000-cc engine. The L500 Mira was the first kei car from Daihatsu to offer a four-cylinder (660-cc) engine.

== L55/L60 series (1980)==
In July 1980,&lt;ref name=&quot;xs4all.nl/~mjs/daihatsuk.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the Daihatsu Mira and Cuore arrived to replace the Daihatsu Max Cuore. A certain amount of confusion arises from the fact that this, the L55-series, was the first-generation Daihatsu Mira, but is usually considered the second generation of the Cuore – and that the Mira was originally marketed as the &quot;Mira Cuore&quot;. The range was facelifted lightly in May 1982, when the Mira dropped the &quot;Cuore&quot; portion of its name. Also new was the sporty five-speed MGX (three-door only), fitted with radial tires. The autoclutch &quot;Daimatic&quot; transmission was replaced by a fully automatic two-speed unit at the same time. In October 1983, turbocharged and four-wheel drive versions of the Mira van were made available (not in conjunction, however).

The L55 series was sold with two main engines - the two-cylinder AB10 unit of 547 cc, and the slightly larger 617-cc AD unit, which was installed in the export-only L60 Cuore. They both featured twin balancing shafts, producing a smoothness and silent operations on par with a traditional four-cylinder engine. In tests, the 617-cc version of the car received plaudits for its refinement and its &quot;lively&quot; character and &quot;enthusiastic&quot; performance when compared to European competitors such as the Fiat Panda 30 and the Citroën Visa Club, both also with two-cylinder engines. The main issue was cost; the balance shaft-equipped two-cylinder supposedly cost as much to build as a conventional four-cylinder engine. The car was also commended by &quot;Quattroruote&quot; for its agile city driving characteristics, although it could hardly be considered fully fit for the &quot;autostrada&quot;. The &quot;big&quot; version has a top speed of .

The bigger engine was introduced in the second half of 1982, as part of a push by Daihatsu to push its European exports. In some markets, the two engines were both available. In Belgium, for instance, they were sold as the Cuore 550 for the small version and as the Cuore 623/625, depending on which bodywork was fitted. The Cuore sold well in both Argentina and Chile in 1980 (4,300 cars shipped), but economic hardship there led to a cancellation of exports by 1982.

In 1983, the Mira Turbo appeared. Only available in the Japanese market, and only as a commercial vehicle, it had a carburetted and turbocharged version of the little two-cylinder engine. This was enough for and a resulting top speed of . In February 1985, the first Mira Parco special edition arrived, heralding a long relationship between Daihatsu and the Parco clothing chain. It received 10-inch alloy wheels, front disc brakes, air conditioning, radial tires, and a special Parco interior, and was sold directly through 11 Parco stores nationwide. Parco also advertised the car through their own publications.

Giovanni Michelotti used this generation Cuore as the basis for the &quot;Michelotti PAC&quot; prototype (Personal Automotive Commuter) shown at Geneva in 1985.

== L70/L80 series (1985)==
The second-generation (L70) Mira/Cuore was released in August 1985. It had a longer wheelbase and a new generation of three-cylinder engines replacing the previous two-cylinder (AB) versions. Displacement of the new EB engines remained exactly the same, at 547 cc. For the L80 export versions, an 847-cc three-cylinder was developed, called ED-10. In September 1986, a special version for the Swiss market appeared, with a narrower bore version displacing 796 cc (called ED-10A). Unlike the fractionally larger standard version, this one suited the four tax horsepower category in certain cantons, while other cantons had prominent tax limits at 800 cc.

For the domestic Japanese market versions, commercial versions (Mira) were sold alongside passenger-car versions (Cuore). The commercials had temporary rear seats that fold completely flat, and are easily recognized by luggage rails in the rear side windows. For the previous generation, a version with switchable four-wheel drive was available for the &quot;Van&quot; version (chassis code L71V). The engines were originally carburetted, and either naturally aspirated or turbocharged (with intercooler). These offered , respectively. The turbo version was originally only available as a Mira (three-door commercial), and was introduced two months after the regular version. Transmissions were either four- or five-speed manuals, with a two-speed automatic also available for the non-turbo versions.
In January 1986, a five-door &quot;Van&quot; (Mira) version was added. A &quot;Walk-through Van&quot; version, using the regular bonnet combined with near square rear bodywork, appeared two months later. Folding doors (optional at the rear) made access possible even in the tightest streets. In August 1987, the Mira/Cuore received a minor facelift with a new grille and bonnet, as well as some other detail changes, all making for a smoother appearance overall. Two months later, a all-wheel drive version was made available in the turbocharged version. In February 1988, another Mira Parco special edition arrived. It was only available in black and with a bright, pop-colored interior, and was aimed at 20-something buyers. This model sold out rapidly, and for the summer, a second Parco edition (now with a bright-blue interior) arrived, followed by the third Mira Parco in February 1989. This version received a turbocharged engine and four-wheel drive.

After having undergone another minor change in October 1988, a 50-PS turbocharged Cuore TR/CR series for passenger use was also made available, in a five-door version as well. A limited edition of 500 examples of the Mira Sedan TR-XX Limited was also sold. In the Japanese kei car market, &quot;sedan&quot; refers to the car&#x27;s intended usage as a passenger car rather than as a commercial vehicle; these have a proper rear seat and generally more comfortable equipment. This was introduced in April 1989, which also marked the end of the division of the line into Mira and Cuore – as the Cuore nameplate was retired in Japan with the abolition of commodity tax; from now on the commercial and passenger models were simply called Mira Van and Mira Sedan. Japanese production of the L70 series ended when the new 660-cc L200 version was introduced in March 1990 in response to new regulations for the kei class.

===Thailand===

Daihatsu&#x27;s Thai arm carried on producing the L70 series after it was replaced in Japan, beginning in the second half of 1990. These were built by Daihatsu Phra Nakhon Motor, a joint venture between Daihatsu, Phra Nakhon Automobile, and the C. Itoh trading company. In addition to assembling the regular version, they also developed a ute version for the pickup-hungry Thai domestic market called the Mira P1, which was built from 1990 to 1995. This featured a pickup bed, tailgate, and redesigned taillights. The Mira pickup was extremely popular, with Daihatsu&#x27;s Thai sales jumping by 50% as a result. Coming full circle, and mirroring the development of the SUV, Daihatsu Phra Nakhon also developed the Mira P4 - a roofed four-seater wagon version of this micro-ute. Some P4s retained the pickup&#x27;s fold-down tailgate, adding a top-hinged glass, while some had a top-hinged one-piece tailgate. Later, an extended-cab 2+2-seater ute (&quot;Daihatsu Miracab&quot;) and a hatchback with an enlarged rear end, called the &quot;Mint&quot;, were offered.

While originally using the smaller engines as per the original Japanese specifications, these were too long to be classified as true kei cars. Later cars have the 850-cc engine as used in many other export markets. Nonetheless, the 1997 Asian financial crisis marked the end for Daihatsu in Thailand, as sales plummeted from 4,000 in 1995 to 160 in 1997. Production ended in February 1998, and by March 1998, Daihatsu no longer offered cars in the Thai market.

===Philippines===
In 2004, Norkis, a Philippine company (known as the former assembler and distributor of Yamaha motorcycles in the country), revived the Mira Pickup, locally reconditioned from used imports and sold as the Legacy. A panel van version is also available, as is a four-door double cab with a very short bed. Unlike the original L70 Mira, they have the later 659-cc EF engine, which is also available to run on LPG. It is longer and heavier than the original, with the original two-seat pickup weighing in at and long.
== L200 series (1990)==
The L200/201 was the third and thus far most popular generation of the vehicle, offered in a large number of variants. The Cuore name was dropped in the Japanese domestic market, as the differences between passenger and commercial versions were narrowed. The L200 (front-wheel drive) was produced with the Mira badge from the spring of 1990 until at least 1998, but the platform has lived on under other names. L201 was the chassis code used on export market cars, usually labelled Cuore.
As with most kei cars, the 200-series was built in two primary variants: The &quot;V&quot; Series is a windowed van style intended for light commercial use. This variant featured a fold-down rear bench seat without seat belts. The &quot;S&quot; series, intended for private use, is largely similar, but the larger, more comfortable rear seats are equipped with belts and are further to the rear of the vehicle with more leg room. While the seats still fold down, unlike the &quot;V&quot;, the &quot;S&quot; does not offer a flat loading floor. These characteristics are due to Japanese tax preferences for commercial vehicles, which only allow for temporary accommodation in the rear and demand a flat loading floor. The top-of-the-line, turbocharged TR-XX model was available both as a passenger car version and as a van, with slightly higher equipment levels for the passenger version, which was fitted with a fuel-injected, 12-valve, turbocharged, and intercooled engine (EF-JL) producing . The TR-XX van, meanwhile, had less stringent emissions requirements and received a carburetted, six-valve version of the same intercooled turbo engine (EF-XL), producing without the passenger version&#x27;s three-way catalyst.

The range received a very subtle facelift of a more rounded overall appearance for 1993; it included altered front and rear lights, bumpers, and a new bonnet and front seats. This version was available to Japanese customers from August 1992, and also incorporated some changes to the lineup. Turbocharged automatics now received a four-speed transmission. Shortly thereafter, the new RV-4 model appeared. This version, with its crossover pretensions, latched onto the wave of so-called &quot;RVs&quot; (recreational vehicles) that became popular in Japan in the early 1990s. The RV-4 received distinct cladding, somewhat raised suspension, a roof rack and bullbar, as well as a protective plate for the engine.
The Mira could either be equipped with a three-speed automatic, or four- or five-speed manual transmission. A part-time four-wheel drive variant known as the L210 was also available in V or S models, only with the five-speed manual. Also, a version with mechanical four-wheel steering (the L220), so far was the only kei car to feature this option. In November 1990, a version with all-wheel drive (permanent four-wheel drive) appeared, called the X-4. This had the same fuel-injected, turbocharged engine as the front-wheel drive-only TR-XX, and shared much of that car&#x27;s equipment. Sales targets were about 700 cars per month for this version. Along with the August 1992 facelift, the X-4 was incorporated into the TR-XX series, while the TR-XX van was discontinued, reflecting changing tax conditions.

The TR-XX&#x27;s electronically fuel-injected, SOHC, 12-valve (four per cylinder) turbo was the range topper, whereas the normally aspirated base versions made do with a single-barrel carburetor. To break the stranglehold of the Suzuki Alto Works on the All-Japan Rally Championship, the Mira X4R was developed in 1991. It had a strengthened engine with a forged crankshaft and flywheel and other detail improvements, a close-ratio gearbox, and various chassis improvements. Equipment was stripped, with a minimal interior and diagonal tires since all such parts would be replaced by competitors. The Group A X4R was sold at a rate of about 10 units per month at a price about twenty percent higher than the regular X-4. Noriyuki Hotta won the class championship in 1992.

A taller, highly customizable, two-seat step-van variant (Walk-through Van) with folding side doors on the passenger side and a regular driver&#x27;s side door was also produced, solely for the Japanese market. This reached the maximum height allowed for kei cars, .

;Export

The L201 was sold outside Japan, primarily in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The three- or five-door L201 retained the larger-displacement engine of 847 cc (ED10K) and a choice of four- or five-speed manual transmissions, or a three-speed automatic option. This carburetted engine produced (ECE) at 5500 rpm. Van versions were also available in Australia, called Handivan (later shortened to Handi). The van, sometimes with filled-in rear windows, was also marketed in certain other markets, such as the Netherlands, where the tax structure favoured it.

The L200/L201 had a myriad of market and model differences. Most European-bound models were badged as Cuore, but the name Domino was retained in Belgium and Luxembourg. And despite the Mira badge mostly being used in right-hand drive markets, left-hand drive Mira-badged L201s were sold in the Dominican Republic.

Left-hand drive European-spec L201s received a fog lamp on the left side. When sold in the United Kingdom (where Japan-specification Miras were also available), they had a rear fog lamp mounted on the right side. L200 Miras produced for Japan had no rear fog lamps. Later models of the Mira had fog lamps on both sides. The L201 also had two license-plate lamps, while the L200 had only one.

This generation of the Mira was chosen by Malaysia&#x27;s Perodua to be rebadged as its first product. The L200 went on sale in Malaysia as the Perodua Kancil in 1994. After several facelifts (around 1997, 2000 and 2002), production of the Kancil finally came to an end in July 2009. The Malaysian-built Kancil was marketed as the Daihatsu Ceria in Indonesia between 2001 and 2006.

== L500 series (1994)==

Production of the L500 Miras started in September 1994. The design of the car was slightly altered throughout, but retained a look similar to that of the L200. The L500 Mira was badged outside Japan primarily as the L501 Cuore. The 200 series Mira ceased sales in Japan, but continued in some other markets, where it received the same engine updates as did the export L500.

In the Japanese market, the Mira Moderno, a separate range of cars (noncommercials), was added in October 1995. This range received a minor facelift in May 1996, which was extended to the rest of the range in May 1997. In August 1997, the Mira Classic was added, a retro-look version. The Classic was available with naturally aspirated engines ( as a front-wheel drive, with 4WD) or a turbocharged option with . The Classic was succeeded by the equally retro-designed Mira Gino, which was based on the fifth generation (L700). In January 1998, in cooperation with Sanrio, a &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; version of the Mira Moderno appeared. This was available in pastel colors and received various Hello Kitty details throughout the car, such as a Hello Kitty ignition key.

The L500 was Daihatsu&#x27;s first kei-class vehicle to feature a four-cylinder engine, with the option of the new JB-series engine. When equipped with this engine, the model code became L502. The range of models available in the 200 platform more or less carried over to the 500 series. One change was that the export versions received fuel injection as standard, which brought the output of the 847 cc engine up by one, to . This engine was called the ED-20. The four-speed manual was no longer available, but a four-speed automatic joined the existing three-speed version in the domestic Japanese market. In November 1996 a twin-cam, 12-valve version of the 847 cc three-cylinder was also made available. This, the ED-DE, produced at 5,500 rpm.

In Australia, the L500 Mira was sold as the Daihatsu Charade Centro. The model remained in production in Pakistan, as the Daihatsu Cuore. The L500 was produced by Toyota Indus Motor Company between March 2000 and 2012, with the 847-cc, carburetted engine (ED-10), which has been used in export models since 1986. The Pakistani Cuores have and were only built with the five-door hatchback bodywork. In all, 2440 cars were built in 2001, although annual capacity was about four times higher.

== L700 series (1998)==
The fifth-generation Cuore received the chassis code L700, with L710 being used for four-wheel drive versions. The new model appeared in the fall of 1998. While the engines of cars sold in the domestic Japanese market had to stay beneath the 659-cc threshold, export versions (L701/711) received a new engine: the 989-cc EJ-DE was a 12-valve, DOHC, three-cylinder producing at 5200 rpm. Also new for export models was the availability of a three-speed automatic. After a facelift in 2001, the car was equipped with a new, more powerful engine code EJ-VE engine with and VVT-i. For some markets the previous, 850 cc ED-DE engine was retained.

The Japanese market Mira received fuel injected 659 cc engines from the EF family. Base models received an SOHC 6-valve engine with , upscale models had a 12-valve DOHC variant with DVVT and , and the sporty TR version received a turbocharged and intercooled derivative with double overhead cams and four valves per cylinder. Claimed power was ; the maximum allowed for kei cars because of a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement. In December 1998, the fuel-economy oriented TV model was introduced, fitted with CVT and a high compression version of the EF-VE engine producing and allowing a fuel mileage of in the standard Japanese test cycle. In October 2000, the turbocharged Mira TR was discontinued (leaving only the Mira Gino to be fitted with the turbo engine), while the low-end EF-SE engine was upgraded and now produced .

===Overseas production===
Production of the L700 Mira was picked up in Malaysia in 2001, where it was sold alongside the Perodua Kancil as the Perodua Kelisa with the familiar Daihatsu E-series engines of 850 and 1,000 cc. Perodua ended production of the model in 2007.

===Mira Gino===

A retro version of the Daihatsu Mira based on the L700 platform began production in 1999, replacing the preceding Mira Classic. The Mira Gino received features and options similar to those of the regular variant, but was styled with a retro look. The Mira Gino was originally only offered with a 659-cc engine in Japan, but the 1-litre EJ-VE engine (as for the export market L700s) was briefly available in Japan as the Mira Gino 1000. A car based on the succeeding, second-generation Gino (which was a stand-alone lineup with its own model code of L650/L660) with a 1.0-L engine was sold as the Daihatsu Trevis in export markets.
== L250 series (2002)==
The L250/L260 Mira, unrelated to the earlier 200-series, is the sixth generation of the car. It is produced as the Mira in Japan. The L250 was labeled Daihatsu Charade in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and Gulf States. Elsewhere, this was badged and sold as the Cuore. Export versions, equipped with the 1.0-litre EJ engine as first seen in the previous generation, are L251, while L260 is used on four-wheel drive versions (for the Japanese domestic market only). After the sixth-generation Mira was replaced in late 2006, the production line was shifted to Malaysia, where production of this car as the Perodua Viva commenced in May 2007.

In Japan, a sportier Mira Avy version also is available. The range underwent a very minor facelift in August 2005. A special needs-friendly (Mira Friend-Matic) version appeared in November 2005. This car could be driven directly from a special self-powered wheelchair (the Mira Self-Matic), with a driver&#x27;s door that could open at 90° and a fully automated entry and exit system. Buyers of the Self-Matic would receive government assistance. The Friend-Matic version continued to be available until August 2009, long after the rest of the L250 range had been replaced.

== L275 series (2006)==
In December 2006, the L275, the seventh-generation Mira, was presented. Initially only available as a passenger version, the van derivative appeared in early 2007. As usual four-wheel drive versions received a different model code (L285). Two Topaz Neo KF engines are available: a 658-cc KF-VE twin-cam, DVVT, three-cylinder engine of , and the KF-DET turbo engine of same displacement that produces . The naturally aspirated engine is available with five-speed manual transmission, three- or four-speed automatic transmission or continuously variable transmission. Export models (L276) first appeared in September 2007 and receive the very light Toyota KR engine, an inline-three of 1.0-litre displacement.

Under the Japanese 10–15 test cycle, fuel economy varies from for three-speed automatic transmissions to for continuously variable transmissions. For cars with the &quot;Smart Drive package&quot;, which come with a new idle start-stop system, fuel economy increases to .

Inside, the gear shift has been moved from between the front seats to centre dash. An optional sliding rear seat, with a range of 255 mm, allows for more luggage room or extra knee room.

Sales of the export 1.0-litre model in South Africa (as Daihatsu Charade) ended in 2011, followed by the European version (Daihatsu Cuore) in 2013.

The Mira, alongside the Mira Cocoa, was discontinued in Japan on 30 March 2018.

*The YouTube channel show &quot;Mighty Car Mods&quot; featured multiple L700 Cuores, namely a blue-colored, two-door 2002 Daihatsu Mira, which due to severe neglected state it was found in when bought by one of the show&#x27;s hosts, was affectionately called &quot;The Blue Turd&quot;. Despite the nickname, subsequent modifications (including an engine swap from a larger Daihatsu Sirion) have elevated the model&#x27;s reputation among affordable DIY car enthusiasts who watch the show. An L200 Mira TR-XX was used in their film &quot;Kei To The City&quot;. In season 9, they imported the Mira as a &quot;halfcut&quot;, due to Australian import regulations preventing it being brought into the country as a working car. Using an Australian-bought Mira as a base car, and as much of the Japanese halfcut Mira as possible, the duo were aiming to recreate the TR-XX in Australia. The car was finally finished and revealed on 8 September 2019.

<doc id="1167779" wikidata="Q2140029" url="?curid=1167779" title="Suzuki Cappuccino">
<text>The is a sports car produced by the Japanese company Suzuki from 1991 to 1998. It is a two-seater roadster with a detachable hardtop that is designed to meet Japanese kei car regulations.

==Description==
The vehicle was designed to meet Kei car specifications for lower tax and insurance in Japan. Weighing , the Cappuccino is powered by a turbocharged, three-cylinder, 657 cc DOHC engine (just under the 660 cc maximum displacement allowed for a Kei car). Its dimensions also conformed to Kei car regulations on length and width, being long and wide.

Front-rear weight distribution is claimed to be 50/50% when both seats are occupied. Layout is front mid-engined and rear-wheel drive. The hood, roof, roll bar and lower front guard panels are aluminium.

Three removable roof panels mean that the car can be used as a closed coupé; T-top; targa; or, on retraction of the rear window and roll bar, a full convertible. Roof panels stow in the trunk (taking almost all the luggage space), and the rear window/rollcage assembly retracts into the body behind the seats. Unlike many convertibles of the time, the rear window is glass and wraparound, with demisting elements.

It was originally equipped with the F6A engine: later models were fitted with a K6A engine which was lighter and had chain-driven, rather than belt-driven camshafts and more torque. Both are DOHC 12-valve, inline three-cylinder engines that were turbocharged and intercooled. Power output was a claimed at 6500 rpm so as to not exceed the maximum power allowed for Kei cars.

The initial Cappuccino featured all-wheel disc brakes and rear-wheel drive. Later versions in Japan had an early production iteration of speed-sensing electric power-assisted steering and aluminium double wishbone suspension. Production began in 1991 and ceased in 1998. The Cappuccino&#x27;s closest competitor of the time were the Autozam AZ-1, Honda Beat and the Daihatsu Leeza Spyder. (The Autozam AZ-1, Honda Beat and Suzuki Cappuccino were together called the Sporty Kei-Car&#x27;s ABC.)

==History==

===Emergence===
The dream of recreating a sporting image for Suzuki began in 1987 and within two years the &quot;project car&quot; was shown for the first time at the Tokyo Motor Show. Suzuki intentionally designed the Cappuccino just for the Japanese market, meeting the tax needs of the Kei-class: body length less than , body width not exceeding and engine size less than 0.66 L. There was originally no intention to export the Cappuccino. Production of the Cappuccino started in October 1991 at the Kosai Plant.

The car had the designation SX306, and the model identification (incorporated in the VIN) EA11R. The sales launch of the Cappuccino was November 1991 in Japan, with the advertising theme: &quot;fulfilling one&#x27;s dream of owning a stylish and very affordable 2 seater sportscar&quot;. The first two years (1991–92) saw 15,113 cars produced with 13,318 (or 88% of production) sold in Japan.

===UK/EU version===
In 1991 Suzuki GB opened discussions with Suzuki Motor Corporation about launching the car in the United Kingdom and meeting the needs of British National Type Approval. After 18 months of negotiation and technical co-operation between SMC and SGB, the Suzuki Cappuccino type was approved and homologated, with 23 adaptations required for the vehicle to conform to British NTA. The work was performed at the Kosai Plant and at the Suzuki Import Centre.

In October 1992, the Cappuccino&#x27;s first public viewing outside Japan occurred at the British International Motor Show, where it won two IBCAM Design awards: Best Sportscar Under £20,000 and Best Car of the Show. In October 1993, the Cappuccino was officially launched in the UK, priced at £11,995. Due to the car&#x27;s initial success in Japan, and the tight import quota of Japanese products to the UK, the original allocation of 1,500 cars was cut to 1,182. Such limited quantities dictated a streamlined colour choice: red and silver in the ratio 4:1. Between 1993 and 1995, a total of 1,110 cars were registered in the UK, with the balance sold to other Suzuki distributors across Europe: Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden.

===Revised Cappuccino (EA21R)===
In 1995 tougher emission controls were set by the European Commission, which led to the unsold cars being registered by 30 September 1995; any unregistered after that date would have had to be re-homologated. Discussions took place between SMC and Suzuki distributors in Europe to assess and &quot;value&quot; the necessary changes for the Cappuccino to meet these new emission levels. The corporate decision was made not to proceed with a revised European version due to the vast expense involved and lack of economy of scale due to the limited production run.

The later specification (EA21R), introduced in 1995, had new, lighter engine with chain-driven camshafts, slightly increased torque, lighter wheels and an optional 3-speed automatic transmission with power steering. Both EA11R and EA21R (MT only) versions had optional &quot;high specification&quot; BA variants, which came with an airbag for the driver, ABS on all four wheels, a limited-slip differential and (in some cases) power-operated door mirrors. There were three limited editions of the EA11R, offering variations of colour and trim; the later two had power steering.

<text>Miklos Jon Molnar (; born 10 April 1970) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a striker. Nicknamed the &quot;Danish Dynamite&quot;, Molnar played for a number of European clubs as well as the Denmark national team. He was the top goalscorer of the 1989 and 1997 Danish championships, and won the 2000 MLS Cup with American team Kansas City Wizards. He scored two goals in 18 caps for the Denmark national football team, and represented his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2000 tournaments. He was also a member of the Denmark team competing at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

After retiring from football in 2000, Molnar took up triathlon and competed semi-professionally. In 2005, he ran under three hours (2:59:20) in the Copenhagen Marathon and under 10 hours (9:50) in an Ironman in Austria.

==Biography==
Born in Copenhagen, Molnar played football in Copenhagen clubs B 1908, Fremad Amager and Hvidovre IF. Molnar&#x27;s talent was acknowledged, as he played seven games and scored four goals for the Danish under-19 youth national team from 1986 to 1988. He made his senior debut in 1987 for Hvidovre in the Danish 2nd Division, before moving to play semi-professionally for top-flight club Boldklubben Frem in 1989. Molnar got his senior level breakthrough when he became joint top goalscorer of the 1989 Danish 1st Division championship with 14 goals, as Frem finished eighth of 14 teams. He was selected for the Danish under-21 national team in June 1989. Several clubs were interested in buying Molnar, including Danish club AGF, English club Chelsea, French club Olympique Lyonnais and Standard Liège from Belgium.

In January 1990, Molnar moved abroad to play professionally for Standard Liège. In his first full season at Liège, Molnar scored 11 goals in 26 games, and he was called up to the Danish national team by national manager Richard Møller Nielsen. Molnar made his national team debut in September 1990, and he played a total three national team games until June 1991. When Liège hired new manager Arie Haan, Molnar did not feel appreciated and sought to be loaned out. He moved from Liège to Swiss club Servette FC in the summer 1991. Molnar became league top goalscorer, as he scored 18 goals in 34 games for Servette in the Swiss 1991–92 Nationalliga A championship.

Molnar was an integral part of the Danish under-21 national team from 1991 to 1992, forming a successful attacking partnership with Peter Møller. Molnar played all Denmark&#x27;s games from the qualification to the semi-finals of the 1992 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, which qualified Denmark for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He was named 1991 Danish &quot;under-21 Player of the Year&quot;. Molnar played all of Denmark&#x27;s three games at the 1992 Olympics final tournament, but was sent off for a physical scuffle with a defender in Denmark&#x27;s final game before elimination against the Australia under-23s. He ended his under-21 career after the 1992 Olympics, having scored a total eight goals in 21 caps.

Having ended his loan at Servette, Molnar looked to find a new club in the summer 1992. Molnar was bought by French club AS Saint-Étienne for FRF 6.000.000. He did not fit into Saint-Étienne&#x27;s technical short passing tactics, and did not find goalscoring success at the club.

He was released from his contract in January 1994, and moved back home to Denmark. In February 1994, he agreed to play for Lyngby BK in the top-flight Danish championship, now called the Danish Superliga. With the stated ambition of moving abroad, Molnar played half a year at Lyngby, but did not get along with Lyngby manager Michael Schäfer. He moved to German club FSV Frankfurt in September 1994. Despite scoring 12 goals in 20 games in the 1994–95 German 2nd Bundesliga season, Molnar could not keep Frankfurt from relegation into the lower Regionalliga division.

Molnar went home to Denmark, and started playing for Superliga club Herfølge BK in September 1995. When Lyngby&#x27;s first-choice striker David Nielsen left the club in June 1996, Molnar moved back to his old club to fill the spot. He was the leading goal scorer in the 1996–97 Danish Superliga with 26 goals in 33 games, and was recalled to the Danish national team by new national manager Bo Johansson, after a hiatus of more than five years. After three goals in five games at the start of the 1997–98 Superliga season, Molnar was sold to Spanish club Sevilla FC in the secondary Segunda División league, where he joined fellow Danish international Thomas Rytter.

In his first year at Sevilla, Molnar scored ten goals in 27 games, and he was included in the Danish squad for the 1998 World Cup. He took part in one match at the tournament, when he most remarkably came on as a substitute in the 58th minute of the 1–1 draw with South Africa, only to be sent off eight minutes later. His second season at Sevilla was not as successful, and Molnar was dropped from the team. When visiting American international midfielder Chris Henderson in Colorado, a former teammate of his, Molnar had been fascinated by the atmosphere in the American Major League Soccer (MLS) championship. In January 2000, he moved to MLS to play for Kansas City Wizards. While at the Wizards, he was included in the Danish squad for the 2000 European Championship in June 2000. He played a single match at the tournament, before ending his national team career. He retired from football in October 2000, after scoring the game-winning goal during the 2000 MLS Cup, as the Wizards beat Chicago Fire 1–0.

On 2 October 2011, he got a comeback, playing 20 minutes for his childhood-club, B1908, in a 2nd division game.

<doc id="1167786" wikidata="Q1149475" url="?curid=1167786" title="Daihatsu Copen">
<text>The is a 2-door convertible kei car built by the Japanese car company Daihatsu. It debuted at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, as the Daihatsu Copen concept. The second generation model debuted as the Kopen (Future Included) at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show.


== First generation (L880; 2002) ==
The Copen was originally designed with a 660 cc turbocharged engine in order to meet Japanese kei car regulations. However, since this engine did not meet environmental emissions standards in several other countries, the Copen was fitted with a more powerful 1.3 L non-turbo engine in these markets in 2007. Styling was inspired by the Nissan Figaro and Audi TT Roadster.

The leading characteristic of this model was the active top, a motorized hide-away hard roof. However, between 2002 and 2007 there existed a variation with a detachable top. This version was about 30 kg. lighter than the regular model.

The Copen was never built with left-hand-drive for the first four model years (2002-2005). The right-hand-drive Copen was officially sold in Germany and some European countries from 2003 to 2005 and with smaller 660cc engine. After a lackluster sale in Germany for the right-hand-drive Copen, Daihatsu introduced the left-hand-drive Copen with bigger 1.3 L engine for non-Japanese markets, which was announced at 2005 IAA Frankfurt, along with new trim level, ZZ. The sales increased to 802 units for model year 2006. The sales number declined greatly from 2007 until the Copen was withdrawn from German market in the summer of 2011. Daihatsu introduced 60 &quot;farewell edition&quot; (Abschiedsmodell) Copen in Germany.

The Copen has been featured on the UK show &quot;Top Gear&quot; where James May attempted to find the best convertible car. The contestants were the Mercedes-Benz CLK, Audi A4, Citroën C3 Pluriel, Volkswagen New Beetle, and the Copen. May loved the Copen, but he had one small problem: it felt &quot;toy-ish&quot;.

On 13 January 2011, Daihatsu announced that it would withdraw the Copen from the European market in 2011 due to the increasing strength of the Japanese Yen and sharp decline in sales from 2006 to 2011. Daihatsu announced on 2 April 2012 that the production for the Copen would cease in August 2012 with the final &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; model. The 500 &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; models were luxuriously appointed with leather upholstery and commemorative 10th Anniversary plate in the door openings.

== Second generation (LA400; 2014) ==
Less than one year after the car&#x27;s discontinuation, Daihatsu announced the Copen would be returning to production with a new model. At the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, Daihatsu unveiled two Copen concept cars called the Kopen, with the tagline &quot;Future Included&quot;. The name &quot;Kopen&quot; was a combination of &quot;kei&quot; class car, and &quot;open&quot; for convertible roadster. The spelling was changed from &quot;k&quot; to &quot;c&quot; for &quot;convertible&quot;. Production of the new model was announced on June 19, 2014.

The Copen has been restyled to be more angular than its predecessor with a new monocoque chassis structure called a D-Frame. The structure allows owners to select the interior and exterior design of the car according to their preferences. The body panels are made of 13 separate resin components, 11 of which are interchangeable to modify design and colours. The Copen also features a new suspension system, a new 660cc turbo three-cylinder engine with DVVT , better sounding exhaust system and weight reduction. In Japan, models sold initially were Copen XPLAY, Copen Robe and a special S type for the Copen Robe.

For the &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot; video game, a specially tuned model called the Daihatsu Copen RJ Vision Gran Turismo was included as part of the series&#x27; Vision Gran Turismo program of concept cars.

The Copen Robe was officially exported to Indonesia and sold between 2015 and 2019.

=== Copen Cero ===
In 2015, Daihatsu launched the Copen Cero, which is similar in form to the first-generation model.

=== Copen Coupe ===
At the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon, Daihatsu unveiled the Copen Coupe, a fixed-roof coupé version of the Copen Cero. The CFRP roof features an optional sunroof. Standard features include a Momo leather wrapped steering wheel, limited-slip differential, BBS aluminum wheels, and serialized plates on the centre console. Options include a sports muffler and HKS suspension. Daihatsu produced a limited run of 200 units in April 2019 to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the second generation Copen.

=== Copen GR Sport ===
The Copen GR Sport went on sale on October 15, 2019. It is sold under both Daihatsu and Toyota dealership networks (as the Toyota Copen GR Sport). This variant neither carries a Daihatsu nor Toyota logo, a neutral oval-shaped &#x27;C&#x27; Copen logo is used instead for the front and rear badging. The Copen GR Sport gets sporty exterior looks with BBS wheels, a Momo-branded steering wheel and a specially tuned suspension for body rigidity.

<doc id="1167787" wikidata="Q752712" url="?curid=1167787" title="Volumetric display">
<text>A volumetric display device is a display device that forms a visual representation of an object in three physical dimensions, as opposed to the planar image of traditional screens that simulate depth through a number of different visual effects. One definition offered by pioneers in the field is that volumetric displays create 3D imagery via the emission, scattering, or relaying of illumination from well-defined regions in (x,y,z) space.

A true volumetric display produces in the observer a visual experience of a material object in three-dimensional space, even though no such object is present. The perceived object displays characteristics similar to an actual material object by allowing the observer to view it from any direction, to focus a camera on a specific detail, and to see perspective – meaning that the parts of the image closer to the viewer appear larger than those further away.

Volumetric 3D displays are a type of autostereoscopic display, in that they provide a different view to each eye, thus creating three-dimensional imagery that can be viewed by unaided eyes. However, they have the advantage over most flat-screen autostereoscopic displays, that they are able to provide realistic focal depth in addition to providing motion parallax and vergence, thus avoiding vergence-accommodation conflict.

Volumetric displays are one of several kinds of 3D displays. Other types are stereoscopes, view-sequential displays, electro-holographic displays, &quot;two view&quot; displays, and panoramagrams.

Although first postulated in 1912, and a staple of science fiction, volumetric displays are not widely used in everyday life. There are numerous potential markets for volumetric displays with use cases including medical imaging, mining, education, advertising, simulation, video games, communication and geophysical visualisation. When compared to other 3D visualisation tools such as virtual reality, volumetric displays offer an inherently different mode of interaction, providing the opportunity for a group of people to gather around the display and interact in a natural manner without having to don 3D glasses or other head gear.

== Types ==

Many different attempts have been made to produce volumetric imaging devices. There is no officially accepted &quot;taxonomy&quot; of the variety of volumetric displays, an issue which is complicated by the many permutations of their characteristics. For example, illumination within a volumetric display can either reach the eye directly from the source or via an intermediate surface such as a mirror or glass; likewise, this surface, which need not be tangible, can undergo motion such as oscillation or rotation. One categorization is as follows:

=== Swept-volume display ===

Swept-surface (or &quot;swept-volume&quot;) volumetric 3D displays rely on the human persistence of vision to fuse a series of slices of the 3D object into a single 3D image. A variety of swept-volume displays have been created.

For example, the 3D scene is computationally decomposed into a series of &quot;slices&quot;, which can be rectangular, disc-shaped, or helically cross-sectioned, whereupon they are projected onto or from a display surface undergoing motion. The image on the 2D surface (created by projection onto the surface, LEDs embedded in the surface, or other techniques) changes as the surface moves or rotates. Due to the persistence of vision, humans perceive a continuous volume of light. The display surface can be reflective, transmissive, or a combination of both.

Another type of 3D display that is a candidate member of the class of swept-volume 3D displays is the varifocal mirror architecture. One of the first references to this type of system is from 1966, in which a vibrating mirrored drumhead reflects a series of patterns from a high-frame-rate 2D image source, such as a vector display, to a corresponding set of depth surfaces.

An example of a commercially available Swept-volume display is the Voxon VX1 from Voxon Photonics. This display has a volume area that is deep and can render up to 500 million voxels per second. Content for the VX1 can be created using Unity or using standard 3D file types such as OBJ, STL and DICOM for medical imaging.

=== Static volume ===

So-called &quot;static-volume&quot; volumetric 3D displays create imagery without any macroscopic moving parts in the image volume. It is unclear whether the rest of the system must remain stationary for membership in this display class to be viable.

This is probably the most &quot;direct&quot; form of volumetric display. In the simplest case, an addressable volume of space is created out of active elements that are transparent in the &quot;off&quot; state but are either opaque or luminous in the &quot;on&quot; state. When the elements (called voxels) are activated, they show a solid pattern within the space of the display.

Several static-volume volumetric 3D displays use laser light to encourage visible radiation in a solid, liquid, or gas. For example, some researchers have relied on two-step upconversion within a rare-earth-doped material when illuminated by intersecting infrared laser beams of the appropriate frequencies.

Recent advances have focused on non-tangible (free-space) implementations of the static-volume category, which might eventually allow direct interaction with the display. For instance, a fog display using multiple projectors can render a 3D image in a volume of space, resulting in a static-volume volumetric display.
A technique presented in 2006 does away with the display medium altogether, using a focused pulsed infrared laser (about 100 pulses per second; each lasting a nanosecond) to create balls of glowing plasma at the focal point in normal air. The focal point is directed by two moving mirrors and a sliding lens, allowing it to draw shapes in the air. Each pulse creates a popping sound, so the device crackles as it runs. Currently it can generate dots anywhere within a cubic metre. It is thought that the device could be scaled up to any size, allowing 3D images to be generated in the sky.

Later modifications such as the use of a neon/argon/xenon/helium gas mix similar to a plasma globe and a rapid gas recycling system employing a hood and vacuum pumps could allow this technology to achieve two-colour (R/W) and possibly RGB imagery by changing the pulse width and intensity of each pulse to tune the emission spectra of the luminous plasma body.

In 2017, a new display known as the &quot;3D Light PAD&quot; was published. The display&#x27;s medium consists of a class of photoactivatable molecules (known as spirhodamines) and digital light-processing (DLP) technology to generate structured light in three dimensions. The technique bypasses the need to use high-powered lasers and the generation of plasma, which alleviates concerns for safety and dramatically improves the accessibility of the three-dimensional displays. UV-light and green-light patterns are aimed at the dye solution, which initiates photoactivation and thus creates the &quot;on&quot; voxel. The device is capable of displaying a minimal voxel size of 0.68 mm3, with 200 μm resolution, and good stability over hundreds of on–off cycles.

== Human–computer interfaces ==

The unique properties of volumetric displays, which may include 360-degree viewing, agreement of vergence and accommodation cues, and their inherent &quot;three-dimensionality&quot;, enable new user interface techniques. There is recent work investigating the speed and accuracy benefits of volumetric displays, new graphical user interfaces, and medical applications enhanced by volumetric displays.

Also, software platforms exist that deliver native and legacy 2D and 3D content to volumetric displays.

== Artistic use ==

An artform called Hologlyphics has been explored since 1994, combining elements of holography, music, video synthesis, visionary film, sculpture and improvisation. Whilst this type of display may render visual data in a volume, it is not an addressable display and capable of only lissajous figures, such at those generated by bouncing a laser off a galvo or speaker cone.

== Technical challenges ==

Known volumetric display technologies also have several drawbacks that are exhibited depending on trade-offs chosen by the system designer.

It is often claimed that volumetric displays are incapable of reconstructing scenes with viewer-position-dependent effects, such as occlusion and opacity. This is a misconception; a display whose voxels have non-isotropic radiation profiles are indeed able to depict position-dependent effects. To-date, occlusion-capable volumetric displays require two conditions: (1) the imagery is rendered and projected as a series of &quot;views&quot;, rather than &quot;slices&quot;, and (2) the time-varying image surface is not a uniform diffuser. For example, researchers have demonstrated spinning-screen volumetric displays with reflective and/or vertically diffuse screens whose imagery exhibits occlusion and opacity. One system created HPO 3D imagery with a 360-degree field of view by oblique projection onto a vertical diffuser; another projects 24 views onto a rotating controlled-diffusion surface; and another provides 12-view images utilizing a vertically oriented louver.

So far, the ability to reconstruct scenes with occlusion and other position-dependent effects have been at the expense of vertical parallax, in that the 3D scene appears distorted if viewed from locations other than those the scene was generated for.

One other consideration is the very large amount of bandwidth required to feed imagery to a volumetric display. For example, a standard 24 bits per pixel, 1024×768 resolution, flat/2D display requires about 135 MB/s to be sent to the display hardware to sustain 60 frames per second, whereas a 24 bits per voxel, 1024×768×1024 (1024 &quot;pixel layers&quot; in the Z axis) volumetric display would need to send about three orders of magnitude more (135 GB/s) to the display hardware to sustain 60 volumes per second. As with regular 2D video, one could reduce the bandwidth needed by simply sending fewer volumes per second and letting the display hardware repeat frames in the interim, or by sending only enough data to affect those areas of the display that need to be updated, as is the case in modern lossy-compression video formats such as MPEG. Furthermore, a 3D volumetric display would require two to three orders of magnitude more CPU and/or GPU power beyond that necessary for 2D imagery of equivalent quality, due at least in part to the sheer amount of data that must be created and sent to the display hardware. However, if only the outer surface of the volume is visible, the number of voxels required would be of the same order as the number of pixels on a conventional display. This would only be the case if the voxels do not have &quot;alpha&quot; or transparency values.

<doc id="1167789" wikidata="Q6365402" url="?curid=1167789" title="Kantha">
<text>Kantha, also spelled kanta or qanta, is a type of embroidery craft in Bangladesh and eastern regions of India, particularly in the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Odisha. In Odisha, old saris are stacked on each other and hand-stitched to make a thin piece of cushion. This is normally used above a bed cushion or instead of a cushion. &quot;Kantha saris&quot; are traditionally worn by women in Bengal region. In these days, embroidery is stitched, popularly known as &#x27;kantha stitched&quot;, on sari, kurta (or panjabi) and churidar and many other garments and gaining popularity due to their aesthetic value and handmade characteristics.

Kantha stitching is also used to make simple quilts, commonly known as nakshi kantha. Women in Bengal typically use old saris and cloth and layer them with kantha stitching to make a light blanket, throw, or bedspread, especially for children. Kantha is very popular with tourists visiting the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;kantha&quot; has no discernible etymological root. The exact origin of the word is not precisely known, although it probably has a precursor in &quot;kheta&quot; (meaning &quot;field&quot; in Bengali). According to Niaz Zaman, the word &quot;kantha&quot; originates from the Sanskrit word &quot;kontha&quot;, which means rags, as &quot;kantha&quot; is made of rags. Its name in Bengali also varies from dialect to dialect and may be known as কাঁথা, খেতা, কেন্থা, শুজনি romanized in ISO standard 15919 as &quot;kām̐thā, khētā, kēnthā, śujani&quot; respectively.

==Weave==

Kantha is a form of embroidery often practised by rural women. The traditional form of Kantha embroidery was done with soft dhotis and saris, with a simple running stitch along the edges. Depending on the use of the finished product they were known as &quot;Lepkantha&quot; or &quot;Sujni Kantha&quot;.

The embroidered cloth has many uses including shawls, covers for mirrors, boxes, and pillows. In some cases, the entire cloth is covered with running stitches, employing beautiful motifs of flowers, animals, birds and geometrical shapes, as well as themes from everyday activities. The stitching on the cloth gives it a slightly wrinkled, wavy effect. Contemporary kantha is applied to a wider range of garments such as sarees, dupatta, shirts for men and women, bedding and other furnishing fabrics, mostly using cotton and silk. Modern Kantha-stitch craft industry involves a very complex multi-staged production model.

<text>Antarā is the equivalent of a verse in Hindustani classical music.

In Hindustani classical music, the fixed (dhrupad/bandish) section is in four parts of which only the first two are performed regularly: Sthāyī (pallavi in Carnatic music) - the first line of the Sthāyī serves as a cadence (music), while the section itself serves as a base for the singer returns to the Sthāyī time and again after each part; Antarā (Anupallavi in Carnatic music) - the intermediate part sung in a high register focusing on the tar shadja, with a good deal of text manipulation and repeated forays into sthāyī; the third section Sanchari (charanam in Carnatic music) - created by the division of the Abhoga and it remains a free-moving section; the fourth and concluding section Abhoga (Pallavi in Carnatic music because this section is often replaced by the Sthāyī) includes notes from all three registers, and in present-day performances, may well be sung with the Sanchari, if these two sections are included.

<text>The Daihatsu Fellow Max is a small Japanese automobile in the Kei car class. Originally introduced as the Daihatsu Fellow, the name was partially retained for its successor, the Max Cuore (1977), and then revived in 2000 for the Daihatsu Max.

==360cc era==
=== Fellow===
On 9 November 1966, Daihatsu introduced the Fellow, also known as &quot;Daihatsu 360&quot; in export markets. Originally only available in DeLuxe and Super DeLuxe equipment levels, a Standard version joined in February 1967. Also available with a wagon body (Fellow Van), as a mini-pickup truck and as a panel van from June 1967, the L37 was conventionally built with a front-mounted engine and rear wheel drive. It used a 23 PS iteration of the 356 cc, water-cooled two-cylinder two-stroke &quot;ZM&quot; engine already seen in the Hijet and a four-speed manual transmission. The self-lubricating (&quot;Oil-Matic&quot;) little engine weighed only . The Fellow was the first Japanese car to be equipped with rectangular headlights.

As a result of Honda&#x27;s 31 PS N360 being introduced early in 1967, a Kei-car horsepower war broke out, with Honda, Subaru, Suzuki, Mazda, and Mitsubishi contributing competitors. Daihatsu&#x27;s response, the Fellow SS, was presented at the 1967 Tokyo Motor Show in October but did not go on sale until June the next year. A Le Mans-style sportscar prototype, the P-5 with the SS engine was shown alongside. The 32 PS &quot;SS&quot; could do the 400 meter sprint in 21.2 seconds and had a top speed.

The Fellow also received a slight facelift in October 1967, with a new dashboard and steering wheel most noticeable. Another minor change came in January 1969, with a fixed driver&#x27;s side headrest and seatbelts installed because of new safety regulations. In July, along with what was literally a facelift (the front bumper was now mounted higher), the lesser engine&#x27;s output increased to 26 PS and a comparatively luxurious &quot;Custom&quot; version was added at the top of the lineup. The size of the taillights also increased somewhat. An electric version called the Daihatsu Fellow Van EV went on sale in September 1969.


=== Fellow Buggy===

A beach buggy version was introduced simultaneously with the other three body styles. While highly prized by collectors today, the Buggy only sold about 100 examples and was only available for a single model year. The 440 kg Fellow Buggy was not actually a &quot;real&quot; Fellow, as it was built on a Hijet S37 chassis, with fibre-reinforced plastic bodywork. The Buggy also used the Hijet&#x27;s lower powered () engine, providing a top speed of .

===Fellow Max===

In April 1970, the front-wheel drive L38 Daihatsu Fellow Max was introduced to replace the rear-wheel drive Fellow. Originally only available as a two-door sedan and three-door van (L38V), a hardtop coupé with a lower roofline and a somewhat baroque front-end treatment was added in August 1971 (L38GL). SL and GXL Hardtops received standard front disc brakes. In October 1972 a four-door version (L38F) appeared; it was the only four-door Kei car at the time of its introduction. Dimensions were 2,995 mm × 1,295 mm as dictated by the Kei car regulations, although the wheelbase was stretched by 100 mm to 2,090 mm. The engine was a 360 cc two-cylinder two-stroke (&quot;ZM4&quot;), offering at the time of introduction. In July 1970 the SS version appeared, featuring a twin-carb, 40 PS (SAE) version of the ZM engine (ZM5) - a specific output of over 112 PS per litre. Top speed was 120 km/h, compared to 115 km/h () for the lesser versions. This highly tuned engine had an 11:1 compression ratio, versus 10:1 for the ZM4 engine, and required high octane gasoline. With a narrow powerband at the high end of the range, its expansion chambers in the front and rear meant that noise levels were elevated.

In October 1972, for the 1973 model year, engine outputs dropped somewhat, to 31 and 37 PS respectively to lower fuel consumption and meet new, more stringent emissions standards. These engines were called ZM12 and ZM13 respectively.

In export markets, this car was usually sold simply as the &quot;Daihatsu 360&quot;. In Australia, where the car went on sale in early 1972 as a two-door sedan, it was called the Max 360X. It was the cheapest new car available in Australia at the time. Unaffected by emissions regulations, it was equipped with the 33 PS version of the engine; in a period road test by Wheels magazine it reached and managed the sprint to in 33.2 seconds. It was also sold as the Daihatsu 360X in New Zealand.


The Fellow Max received a steady stream of facelifts during its existence. It underwent minor changes in March 1971 (new grille, dash modifications), March 1972 (new dash, round headlights and a new bonnet with longitudinal creases), May 1973 (changes to the fenders and new bumpers that fitted into the bodywork, and another new bonnet) and in October 1973 (new safety equipment). In February 1975 the bumpers were modified again, to allow for the fitment of new, larger license plates. The grille and front bumper arrangement was changed yet again. At the same time the interior saw some changes and the powerful twin-carb model was dropped as it wouldn&#x27;t pass new emissions regulations. From now on, all models were equipped with the 31 PS &quot;ZM12&quot; engine. In May 1976 the car underwent more thorough changes as new Kei car regulations were introduced. This also marked the end of the Hardtop versions, which anyhow had lost relevance once the twin-carb engine was discontinued.

==550cc era==

In May 1976, responding to a change in the Kei car regulations, Daihatsu increased the Fellow Max&#x27; engine size to 547 cc and gave it a new chassis code (L40/L40V). The name remained, although the &quot;Fellow&quot; portion received less prominence and some marketing material simply referred to the car as the &quot;Max 550&quot;. The new &quot;AB10&quot; four-stroke two-cylinder engine replaced the old two-cycle &quot;ZM&quot;. This, developed with help from Toyota, was an overhead camshaft design (belt-driven) which also featured balance axles to smoothen the inherently imbalanced two-cylinder design. The AB10 engine was also briefly sold to Suzuki for use in the four-stroke version of their Fronte 7-S. The cleaner four-stroke offered less power than the revvy 360, down to at 6,000 rpm. Torque increased somewhat, to at a significantly lower 3,500 rpm.

New bumpers meant length and width were up marginally to and . Claimed top speed was , somewhat lower than that of the 360. With Honda withdrawing from the Kei passenger car segment, Daihatsu became the only maker to offer a Kei car featuring front-wheel drive. The Van used the front end and front doors from the two-door Max, but with a more square-rigged rear end featuring a split tailgate (divided horizontally) and a folding rear seat which allowed for a flat loading floor.

===Max Cuore===
In July 1977, the name was changed to Max Cuore (chassis code L45, although Vans remained L40V). The new name also heralded a wider body shell (up to ) which also increased the length to 3160 mm for the sedan and 3165 mm for the wagon. By March, 1979 the car was renamed Daihatsu Cuore (though it still carried discrete &quot;Max&quot; badging), along with a power upgrade to at 6000 rpm. Torque increased to for the engine, which now featured the DECS (Daihatsu Economical Clean-up System) emissions control system to meet the stricter 1978 (53年) emissions standards. The front grille and emblems were changed, while the seats were improved and new colors (inside and out) became available. The Cuore Van, available in Standard, DeLuxe, and Super DeLuxe grades, now had on tap.
In most of Europe, the car was simply called Daihatsu Cuore beginning in 1977, although it retained the &quot;Max&quot; prefix in some markets. Export versions received the same lower-powered engine as the Cuore Van did in Japan. 1980 saw the introduction of the parallel commercial series Daihatsu Mira, while the name &quot;Max&quot; finally disappeared entirely from the Cuore. In Japan, the 1979 Max Cuore was available as Standard (two-door), Deluxe (two or four doors), Custom (four-door), Hi-Custom (two or four doors), and Hi-Custom EX (four-door). The top of the line Hi-Custom EX was new for 1979.
==2000s==
The Daihatsu Max was a partial revival of the Daihatsu Fellow Max nameplate, appearing on October 10, 2001. Sales of the Daihatsu Max 5-door wagon began on November 1, using the same technical data as the second generation Move, though 10 mm lower. In 2006, the Max was discontinued and replaced by the Sonica.

<doc id="1167800" wikidata="Q650670" url="?curid=1167800" title="Nilpotent matrix">
<text>In linear algebra, a nilpotent matrix is a square matrix &quot;N&quot; such that
:formula_1
for some positive integer formula_2. The smallest such formula_2 is called the index of formula_4, sometimes the degree of formula_4.

More generally, a nilpotent transformation is a linear transformation formula_6 of a vector space such that formula_7 for some positive integer formula_2 (and thus, formula_9 for all formula_10). Both of these concepts are special cases of a more general concept of nilpotence that applies to elements of rings.

==Examples==
===Example 1===
The matrix
:formula_11
is nilpotent with index 2, since formula_12.

===Example 2===
More generally, any formula_13-dimensional triangular matrix with zeros along the main diagonal is nilpotent, with index formula_14 . For example, the matrix
:formula_15
is nilpotent, with

:formula_16

The index of formula_17 is therefore 4.

===Example 3===
Although the examples above have a large number of zero entries, a typical nilpotent matrix does not. For example, 
:formula_18
although the matrix has no zero entries.

===Example 4===
Additionally, any matrices of the form

:formula_19

such as 

:formula_20

or 

:formula_21

square to zero.

===Example 5===
Perhaps some of the most striking examples of nilpotent matrices are formula_22 square matrices of the form:

:formula_23

The first few of which are:

:formula_24

These matrices are nilpotent but there are no zero entries in any powers of them less than the index.

===Example 6===
Consider the linear space of polynomials of a bounded degree. The derivative operator is a linear map. We know that applying the derivative to a polynomial decreases its degree by one, so when applying it iteratively, we will eventually obtain zero. Therefore, on such a space, the derivative is representable by a nilpotent matrix.

==Characterization==

For an formula_25 square matrix formula_4 with real (or complex) entries, the following are equivalent:
* formula_4 is nilpotent.
* The characteristic polynomial for formula_4 is formula_29.
* The minimal polynomial for formula_4 is formula_31 for some positive integer formula_32.
* The only complex eigenvalue for formula_4 is 0.
The last theorem holds true for matrices over any field of characteristic 0 or sufficiently large characteristic. (cf. Newton&#x27;s identities)

This theorem has several consequences, including:
* The index of an formula_25 nilpotent matrix is always less than or equal to formula_13. For example, every formula_36 nilpotent matrix squares to zero.
* The determinant and trace of a nilpotent matrix are always zero. Consequently, a nilpotent matrix cannot be invertible.
* The only nilpotent diagonalizable matrix is the zero matrix.

See also: Jordan–Chevalley decomposition#Nilpotency criterion.

==Classification==
Consider the formula_25 (upper) shift matrix:
:formula_38
This matrix has 1s along the superdiagonal and 0s everywhere else. As a linear transformation, the shift matrix &quot;shifts&quot; the components of a vector one position to the left, with a zero appearing in the last position:
:formula_39
This matrix is nilpotent with degree formula_13, and is the canonical nilpotent matrix.

Specifically, if formula_4 is any nilpotent matrix, then formula_4 is similar to a block diagonal matrix of the form
:formula_43
where each of the blocks formula_44 is a shift matrix (possibly of different sizes). This form is a special case of the Jordan canonical form for matrices.

For example, any nonzero 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix is similar to the matrix
:formula_45
That is, if formula_4 is any nonzero 2 × 2 nilpotent matrix, then there exists a basis b1, b2 such that &quot;Nb1 = 0 and &quot;Nb2 = b1.

This classification theorem holds for matrices over any field. (It is not necessary for the field to be algebraically closed.)

==Flag of subspaces==

A nilpotent transformation formula_6 on formula_48 naturally determines a flag of subspaces
:formula_49
and a signature
:formula_50

The signature characterizes formula_6 up to an invertible linear transformation. Furthermore, it satisfies the inequalities
:formula_52
Conversely, any sequence of natural numbers satisfying these inequalities is the signature of a nilpotent transformation.

==Additional properties==
==Generalizations==
A linear operator formula_53 is locally nilpotent if for every vector formula_54, there exists a formula_55 such that
:formula_56
For operators on a finite-dimensional vector space, local nilpotence is equivalent to nilpotence.

<doc id="1167803" wikidata="Q1157575" url="?curid=1167803" title="Daihatsu Move">
<text>The is a kei car/city car manufactured by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu between August 1995 and June 2023. The Move was Daihatsu&#x27;s response to the similarly designed Suzuki Wagon R that was introduced two years earlier in 1993. The first Move was designed by Italian design house I.DE.A Institute and succeeding generations continued to build upon the original design. The Move is built upon the chassis of the Mira but with a taller body.


== First generation (L600; 1995) ==
The first-generation Move was designed by I.DE.A in Turin, Italy. It was marketed with a 659 cc three-cylinder engine in Japan and with an &quot;ED-20&quot; engine in export markets. The Japanese domestic market models were internally designated L600, or L610 when equipped with four-wheel drive system; export models were internally designated L601. In 1997, a variant marketed as the &quot;Move Custom&quot; was introduced with larger headlamps and revised front styling, and was available in subsequent generations.

Daihatsu produced more than half a million L600/L610 Move models, mostly in Japan. It was imported to Europe, including the UK; its 1999 successor was not exported to Europe.

The Move was also offered with the turbocharged 659 cc &quot;JB-JL&quot; all-aluminium four-cylinder engine producing and using the internal designation L602; this version was only available with front-wheel drive.

The export model&#x27;s &quot;ED-20&quot; engine produced , offering more torque than the naturally aspirated 660 cc engines thanks to the larger displacement. The turbocharged engine was not offered in Europe due to its excessive emissions. The export model has a top speed of , in the version with an automatic transmission.

== International markets ==
In Malaysia, Perodua manufactures a version of the Move called the Kenari.

In China, the FAW Tianjin joint venture between First Automotive Works and Toyota produces a petrol and electrical version of the Move. The electric version is exported to the US as the Miles ZX40.

The first two generation Moves were also exported to Europe, where they also went by the Japanese market name. Due to poor sales, Daihatsu did not export the third or fourth-generation Moves to Europe after the brand&#x27;s departure from the continent, making it strictly a Japanese domestic market model.

<text>The is a mini SUV produced by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Daihatsu since 1997 as the successor to the F300 series Rocky. It was initially offered in both short- and long-wheelbase configurations before the former stopped production in 2016 to be replaced by the A200 series Rocky crossover in 2019. The long-wheelbase variant is available mainly for the Indonesian market with three-row seating options. A smaller kei car model called the Terios Kid/Lucia was also available for the first-generation model.

Rear-wheel drive is standard across all generations, while four-wheel drive option was available for the first- and second-generation models.

Since August 2016, the Terios has been sold exclusively in Indonesia. Throughout three generations, it has also been marketed by Toyota and Perodua under various nameplates as well.

The name &quot;Terios&quot; is originated from the Old Greek word, which is roughly translated to &quot;making dreams come true&quot;.

== First generation (J100/F500; 1997) ==
Initially previewed as the MS-X97, the first-generation Terios was available as a five-door wagon, and a smaller kei car model called the Terios Kid, which was only released in Japan. Model codes for the first generation were J100, J102 and J122. The Terios Kid arrived in October 1998 and continued to be built six years after the original Terios had been replaced. By the end of 2002, Daihatsu sold 33,000 units of Terios and 97,000 units of Terios Kid.

In 2000, Daihatsu gave the Terios a mild facelift both in the exterior and interior of the vehicle. A new chrome grille replaced the black plastic grille. The high-grade model gained electric front windows, central locking, rear seat head restraints, alloy wheels, roof rails and a roof-mounted rear spoiler. Mechanically, the 1.3-litre SOHC four-cylinder engine fitted to the previous model had been replaced by the new 1.3-litre DOHC four-cylinder engine. Power was also increased by . A sport version of the K3-VET engine was produced in Japan.

In Australia, a limited edition sports series was introduced in 2001 with only 200 units being available. The vehicle had body colour matching bumpers, different from the two-tone bumper colour on the standard model. Rear spoiler and sunroof became standard. The interior was updated with metallic paint finish on the centre console and dashboard.

This is the first Daihatsu automobile to be assembled in Venezuela, where production began in November 2001.

===== Terios Kid / Terios Lucia =====
A kei car version called the Terios Kid or Terios Lucia was also available in the local market. The 4WD version of the Terios Kid was introduced in October 1998, with a rear-wheel-drive version following in January 2000. Production of both versions ended in June 2012. The Terios Lucia was available from December 2001 until August 2003.

==== Malaysia ====
In Malaysia, the Terios was locally assembled as the Perodua Kembara by Perodua. It was unveiled in August 1998. In June 2003, the Kembara was updated with DVVT engines. In July 2004, the Kembara CT Elegance was unveiled and came with ABS, front dual airbags, leather seats, different designed alloy rim, flat type side step and cubic printing cluster. It was priced at RM59,988 and only available in one colour: Klasik Gold.

==== Indonesia ====
In Indonesia, a version of the Terios is known as the Daihatsu Taruna (chassis code: F500/F520), with a different front/rear styling and longer rear-based body capable of seating seven people. The name Taruna translates roughly as &quot;young knight&quot; or &quot;cadet&quot; in Indonesian. The Taruna was launched in July 1999 with a 1589 cc HD-C petrol engine with carburetor. It was initially available in short-wheelbase configuration only, the C-series. The engine was later replaced with a 1498 cc HE-E petrol engine with electronic fuel injection in 2001 and the long-wheelbase configuration, the F-series, was introduced with the same HD-C engine as the 1999-2001 C-series, and later replaced with the same HE-E engine as the 2001 C-series in the same year. The Taruna received facelifts in August 2001, July 2003, March 2004 and March 2005. It was available with CL and FL, CX and FX, and CSX and FGX grades. There were also CSR and FGZ special grades, which were similar to CSX and FGX, with a 1589 cc HD-E petrol engine with electronic fuel injection.

==== China ====
In China, the Terios was produced under two different brand names: as the Zotye 2008/Hunter and 5008 powered with a 1.5-litre engine from Mitsubishi Motors (first series body); the Zotye was an unauthorised copy of the Terios, which caused some controversy, while FAW badged the Terios as the Huali Terios or Dario. In 2009, Daihatsu withdrew from the China market due to bad performance and sold the tooling and rights of this car to First Auto Works (FAW), who was their official joint venture partner in China. Production for the 2008 ran from 2005 to 2010, while the 5008 was produced from 2008 to 2013.

The concept model called D-Compact 4x4 made an appearance in September 2005 at the 61st Frankfurt Motor Show and in November 2005 at the 39th Tokyo Motor Show before being named to Terios, which went into production in January 2006. The model codes are J200, J210 and J211 for the short-wheelbase configuration which has a 5-seater configuration; F700 and F710 for the long-wheelbase configuration that was built to accommodate the 7-seater configuration. It is built on a &quot;built-in ladder frame&quot; monocoque body, which is claimed to &quot;achieve balance between lighter weight, higher body rigidity, and comfort&quot;.

In European, South American and most other Asian markets, the model is sold under the name Terios. Daihatsu designed and manufacture the Terios and also supplies the vehicle to Toyota as the under a consigned/OEM manufacturing agreement. According to the company, the name &quot;Rush&quot; is inspired from a &quot;sense of energetic vitality and cheerfulness&quot;.

=== Markets ===

==== Japan ====
For the Japanese market, the first-generation Terios was succeeded by the and the first-generation Toyota Rush. Both vehicles were announced on 17 January 2006. According to Daihatsu, the name &quot;Be‣go&quot; was derived from the combination of &quot;being&quot; and &quot;going&quot; words. The Rush was an exclusive model to the &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; dealership network.

Both use either 1.3-litre or 1.5-litre engine. Only the 1.5-litre variant is available with both two- or four-wheel drive. The vehicle has a permanent 4WD system via lockable central differential. However, it lacks low ratio gears.

A minor refresh of the Be‣go and Rush was unveiled on 13 November 2008 in Japan. The minor facelift brought redesigned front bumper, tail lamps, alloy wheel design for the G grade and a 5% improvement for fuel economy for the 2WD automatic model. The Be‣go and Rush were discontinued in March 2016 and succeeded by the A200 series Rocky/Toyota Raize crossover in November 2019.
==== Indonesia ====
The second-generation Terios and first-generation Rush were both launched in Indonesia on 14 December 2006, with the former succeeded the Taruna. Both cars were sold in long-wheelbase configuration and rear-wheel drive layout only. Three-row seating were standard on the Terios and optional on the Rush. The Terios was initially offered in TS, TS Deluxe, TS Extra, TX Deluxe, TX Elegant and TX Adventure grade levels, while the Rush came with G and S grades. On 1 October 2008, the Indonesian market Terios received updates such as standard body-coloured side body mouldings, as well as side visors, single SRS airbag on the driver&#x27;s side and parking sensors, followed by the Rush in August 2009. The TX Elegant grade was removed in this update.

The Terios and Rush received their first facelift on 5 and 6 October 2010 respectively, equipped with dual SRS airbags as standard. The S grade of Rush was later replaced by TRD Sportivo grade on 29 August 2013. At the same time, the Terios received some minor updates.

On 20 March 2015, both the Terios and Rush received their second facelift, consisted of projector headlamps with LED positioning lamps, a wider grille with a chrome lower bar, a full-width air intake for the lower bumper and a blacked-out centre piece. The steering wheel was updated to the one used in F650 series Xenia/Avanza. The grade levels for Terios were renamed to X, X Extra, R and R Adventure. On 18 February 2016, the R Custom grade was added for the Terios, followed by TRD Sportivo Ultimo grade (with TRD suspension kits) for the Rush on 26 February. Three-row seating became standard on both TRD Sportivo grades.

==== Singapore ====
In Singapore, the Terios is offered by the local distributor in both short- and long-wheelbase configurations with an 1.5-litre engine and as a 4WD as standard.

==== Malaysia ====
In Malaysia, the second-generation Terios is available as the Toyota Rush (2008 to 2017) and Perodua Nautica (2008 to 2009). The Rush was introduced in January 2008 as a long-wheelbase model. Imported from Indonesia, it offers three-row seating as standard. The Nautica was introduced in April 2008 as a rebadged model of the short-wheelbase Terios/Rush. Available with standard four-wheel drive, it was imported from Japan as the replacement to the Perodua Kembara.

===== Toyota Rush =====
The first-generation Rush was launched in Malaysia in January 2008. It is available in two grade levels: 1.5G (with either manual or automatic transmission) and 1.5S (with automatic transmission only). The Rush sold in Malaysia is the long-wheelbase model in seven-seat configuration.

In December 2010, the Rush received its first facelift for 2011.

In April 2015, the Rush received its second facelift with the same model in the Indonesian market. Exterior changes included redesigned front bumper, radiator grille and bonnet. The bumper is finished in a two-tone effect and the grille is finished with faux carbon-fibre. Elsewhere, there is a new integrated chrome lining highlight running across the headlamp and radiator grille, restyled tail lamps with combination LEDs and smoked lenses. The 1.5S has additional equipment including fog lamps, chrome covers for the wing mirrors, and leather steering wheel and gear knob.

===== Perodua Nautica =====
Perodua launched the rebadged version of the short-wheelbase Terios, called &quot;Nautica&quot; in May 2008. The model was fully imported from Japan, except for the front grille, front bumper and rear bumper which are manufactured and fitted in Malaysia. It has a 1.5-litre DVVT engine, full-time 4WD, projector headlamps, and five seats with dark interior. The price tag of the Nautica is not much different from the long-wheelbase Rush. It comes with only two colour choices: Medallion Grey and Majestic Black, and comes in automatic transmission only. The Nautica was quietly discontinued in 2009, slightly less than a year after its launch. Only a mere total of 489 units were ever sold. The reason for the discontinuation was because as a national car company focused on local manufacturing, Perodua was unable to obtain sufficient necessary Approved Permits for vehicle importation, as the Nautica was imported in CBU form from Japan.

==== South America ====
In Chile, the second-generation Terios in short-wheelbase configuration was launched in 2006. It was re-branded as the Toyota Rush in August 2016, as Daihatsu left that market.

== Third generation (F800/F850; 2017) ==
The third-generation Terios was unveiled in Indonesia on 23 November 2017, along with the second-generation Rush.

It uses the same platform as the long-wheelbase version of the second-generation model, albeit with some tweaks.

==== Recalls ====
On 15 July 2019, Toyota had announced that around 60,000 units of the Indonesian market Rush manufactured from December 2017 to February 2019 would be recalled due to a problem regarding the airbags. It is stated that the affected models were found to have an improperly programmed airbag control module which could cause the side curtain airbags to accidentally deploy even when the vehicle is running normally. An impact on the rear wheel when passing a pothole or dent may be misinterpreted as a collision, which may cause deployment of the side curtain airbags. The Terios models were not affected due to the fact that the model is not being equipped with side curtain airbags.

=== Awards ===
In July 2018, the car won the &quot;Good Design Indonesia of The Year&quot; award.

<doc id="1167813" wikidata="Q1157583" url="?curid=1167813" title="Daihatsu YRV">
<text>The was a mini MPV which was manufactured by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu from 2000 to 2005. The name &quot;YRV&quot; is an abbreviation for &quot;Young Recreational Vehicle&quot;. The YRV is based on the contemporary Daihatsu Storia/Sirion; it offered a sportier character, nimbler handling, and more powerful engine options than its period competitors in the Japanese market.

== Engines and trim levels==
A four-wheel drive system named &quot;4Trak&quot; is available only with the 1.3 L &quot;K3-VE&quot; engine internationally. A Japanese domestic market turbocharged version was also available. All other versions are equipped with front-wheel drive system. There was also the &quot;F-Speed&quot; semi-automatic transmission version. The gear shifter was mounted on the steering column (called a &quot;dashboard shift&quot; by Daihatsu); along with minor updates in December 2001, the YRV Turbo received the more common, floor-mounted shifter instead.

While the handling had been described as &quot;European&quot; in the Japanese domestic market, the turbocharged YRV was deemed to need additional tuning. The new engine was mounted in a Sirion for initial testing, and then the YRV underwent more testing and modification before going on sale in Europe. A premium specification was also available; this featured the naturally aspirated &quot;K3-VE&quot; engine, side skirts and five-spoke alloy wheels. This version was the highest selling YRV specification of the three in the United Kingdom and remains the most common variant there.

The YRV has an option for an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission. The international-market YRV Turbo comes with this transmission as standard equipment.

A four-wheel drive Japanese domestic market version was available at launch and up until discontinuation in 2005. This version had a turbocharged 1.3 L &quot;K3-VET&quot; engine, producing in Japanese specifications, and an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic transmission or an upgraded 5-speed manual transmission option, exclusively for this model.

<text>Diplomatic service is the body of diplomats and foreign policy officers maintained by the government of a country to communicate with the governments of other countries. Diplomatic personnel obtain diplomatic immunity when they are accredited to other countries. Diplomatic services are often part of the larger civil service and sometimes a constituent part of the foreign ministry.

Some intergovernmental organizations, such as the European Union, and some international non-state organizations, such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, may also retain diplomatic services in other jurisdictions. For non-state organizations, the reciprocation of diplomatic recognition by other jurisdictions is difficult, as diplomacy tends to establish the concept of recognition upon an assumed sovereignty over geographical territory; the SMOM, in this case, receives diplomats at its headquarters in Rome, as all permanent missions to the SMOM are jointly accredited as permanent missions to the Holy See. In relation, many more non-state international organizations, such as the IFRC/ICRC, maintain permanent non-voting observer status to intergovernmental bodies such as the United Nations General Assembly, appointing individual representatives to the observer office.

<doc id="1167816" wikidata="Q497821" url="?curid=1167816" title="Samgeun of Baekje">
<text>Samgeun (465–479) (r. 477–479) was the 23rd king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. According to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot;, he was the eldest son of the 22nd king Munju.

==Background==
In 475, the northern Korean kingdom of Goguryeo had forced Baekje&#x27;s capital south from the present-day Seoul region to Ungjin (near present-day Gongju), and the Baekje court had lost much of its power to the aristocracy. Within the aristocracy, clans from the local Mahan confederacy, which Baekje conquered and absorbed earlier, gained strength against the traditional clans descended from the northern kingdom of Buyeo.

In the midst of this instability, the chief general and Minister of Defense, Hae Gu, took control of the military and killed Munju&#x27;s brother Buyeo Gonji in 477. After this Hae Gu exercised effective rule over the country. That year, he ordered the death of Munju.

==Reign==
Samgeun was only thirteen years old when he took power after his father&#x27;s death. Since he was not fit to oversee the military, the armies continued to be overseen by General Hae Gu, who maintained actual political control.

In 478, Hae Gu found common cause with rebels led by Yeon Sin, based in Daedu Castle. Samgeun first sent the noble Jin Nam to capture the castle with 2,000 men, but he failed. He then sent Jin Ro, who defeated the rebels with 500 men, whereupon Yeon Sin fled to Goguryeo. With this event, the Jin clan gained great strength in Baekje.

The next year, Samgeun died, succeeded by his uncle Buyeo Gonji&#x27;s son, Dongseong of Baekje.

<text>Nuuksio National Park (, ) is one of Finland&#x27;s 40 national parks. Established in 1994, the park spreads over an area of forests and lakes in Espoo, Kirkkonummi and Vihti. North-west from Helsinki, it is the second-closest national park to the capital behind the recently established Sipoonkorpi National Park. The name is derived from the Nuuksio district of Espoo.

Located less than 30 kilometers from downtown Helsinki, the park can easily be reached by public transportation. Bus 245A leaves from Espoon keskus to Nuuksionpää and Kattila during daytime.

Within the park there are eight marked trails for hiking. These trails vary in length and difficulty, being between 1.5 km and 17 km long. In addition, there are 30 km of biking trails and 22 km of horse riding trails. Designated spots for grilling, camping and skiing are scattered across the park.

The Siberian flying squirrel (&quot;Pteromys volans&quot;) is the emblem of the national park due to their high population density in the park.

The national park comprises the westernmost part of the so-called Nuuksio lake highlands. Dozens of endangered or near threatened species animals, plants and fungi are known to inhabit the area, for instance the Siberian flying squirrel, the European nightjar and the woodlark.

<text>Curt Johnson is an American soccer executive who currently serves as General Manager and President of North Carolina Football Club, home of North Carolina FC of the USL Championship and the North Carolina Courage of the National Women’s Soccer League.

A Raleigh native, Johnson graduated from Ravenscroft School and played collegiately at North Carolina State University, where he served as senior captain, helped the Wolfpack win the 1990 ACC Championship and graduated with a degree in communications studies. In 2013, Johnson was inducted into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame.

Before working in his current position, Johnson previously worked for the Richmond Kickers, Kansas City Wizards, Carolina Hurricanes and U.S. Club Socce.

== Playing career ==

Following his prep career at Ravenscroft School and Capital Area Soccer League (CASL), Johnson continued his player career at the collegiate level in his hometown, starring for the NC State Wolfpack men’s soccer team from 1987–90.

During his career with the Wolfpack, Johnson appeared in 72 matches, and served as a captain in his senior season, as NC State won an ACC Championship and reached the NCAA semifinals. After his playing career, Johnson would later return to NC State as an assistant coach.

== North Carolina Football Club (North Carolina FC/NC Courage) ==

In February 2011, it was announced that Johnson would serve as President of the Carolina RailHawks. In Johnson&#x27;s first season leading the club, the RailHawks won the NASL regular season title under first-year head coach Martin Rennie, going 17W–8L–3D with a then league-record 13-game unbeaten streak.

From 2012–14, the RailHawks developed a reputation as one of the toughest second-division teams in the country to play against due to their performances in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. From 2012–14, the RailHawks recorded five wins against Major League Soccer opponents, including three in as many years against the LA Galaxy. The RailHawks reached the quarterfinals of the competition in both 2012 and 2014.

In 2015, Johnson helped oversee the transfer in ownership of the RailHawks from Traffic Sports USA to Stephen Malik, a local Triangle businessman and medical software entrepreneur. In 2016, Johnson was instrumental in the RailHawks hosting English Premier League Club West Ham United in front of a then North Carolina Football Club-record 10,125 fans.

In December 2016, the RailHawks rebranded to North Carolina FC, and in January 2017 Malik announced the addition of the North Carolina Courage, an NWSL team which Johnson was named president and general manager of.

Both NCFC and the Courage reached the postseason in 2017, as the Courage claimed the NWSL Shield and reached the league’s title game. Johnson also played a role in negotiating a partnership between North Carolina Football Club, Capital Area Soccer League and Triangle Futbol Club, which led to the creation of NCFC Youth, which Johnson currently serves on the board of.

Ahead of the 2018 season, Johnson helped orchestrate a deals that saw the Courage acquire U.S. Women’s National Team star Crystal Dunn and former USWNT standout Heather O&#x27;Reilly, and the team became the first in NWSL history win both the shield and NWSL Championship.

Following the 2018 USL season, Johnson made his second NCFC coaching change, as the club announced the hiring of former U.S. Men’s National Team Manager Dave Sarachan on December 17, 2018. With Sarachan in charge, NCFC finished seventh in the USL Championship Eastern Conference and reached the playoffs for the second time in three years in 2019. Meanwhile, the Courage became the first team in NWSL history to win a league championship on its home field, as it defeated the Chicago Red Stars 4–0 in front 10,227 spectators, the largest crowd in North Carolina Football Club history.

== Previous Front Office Experience ==

Johnson&#x27;s first stint as a professional soccer executive came in the late 1990s with the Richmond Kickers of the A-League. From 1997–99, Johnson served in a leadership role, both as vice president of operations and general manager. During Johnson&#x27;s tenure with the Kickers, the team won the Atlantic Division in 1998.

After his third season in Richmond, Johnson was chosen as the general manager of the Kansas City Wizards by Lamar Hunt and Clark Hunt. During his tenure with the Wizards, Johnson made an immediate impact, as Kansas City completed the double by winning both the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield and the MLS Cup in 2000. Four years later, Johnson and Kansas City once again lifted a trophy in 2004 with a win over the Chicago Fire in the U.S. Open Cup Final. Johnson was instrumental in the transfer of ownership of the club from the Hunt family to OnGoal, LLC.

Before joining North Carolina Football Club in 2011, Johnson served as the Carolina Hurricanes&#x27; director of marketing from 2007–08 and later worked for U.S. Club Soccer, where he helped to develop strategies for growth of the game at the youth levels for both boys and girls.

<text>Nuuksio (Finnish) or Noux (Swedish) is a district of Espoo, a city in Finland, best known for the Nuuksio National Park. The Solvalla Sports Institute is also located in Nuuksio.

== Etymology ==
The Finnish name, &quot;Nuuksio&quot;, comes from the Swedish name, &quot;Noux&quot;, an old name which has had many forms, such as &quot;Noox&quot; (1540), &quot;Noosis&quot; (1541), &quot;Nooxby&quot; (1552) and &quot;Nowx&quot; (1556). The name has been thought to have been derived from the Sámi word &quot;njukča&quot;, meaning swan.

<text>SAS &quot;Isandlwana&quot; (F146) is the second of four s for the South African Navy built by the European South African Corvette Consortium. SAS &quot;Isandlwana&quot; was named after the Battle of Isandlwana at a ceremony held in Kiel in December 2002, by Deputy Defence Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge.

==Construction==
SAS &quot;Isandlwana&quot; was manufactured by the European South African Corvette Consortium (ESACC), consisting of the German Frigate Consortium (Blohm+Voss, Thyssen Rheinstahl and Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werft), African Defence Systems (part of the French Thales defense group) and a number of South African companies.

The ships were built to the MEKO modular design concept and are designated by the manufacturer as the MEKO A-200SAN class. Some controversy exists as to the class type of the vessel, with both the manufacturer and the South African Navy referring to her as a &quot;corvette,&quot; but other similar vessels in other navies being referred to as frigates. Some have claimed the use of the word &quot;corvette&quot; was a political decision made by the South African government to ease criticism of the procurement of the vessels.

SAS &quot;Isandlwana&quot; was built at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft shipyards in Kiel, Germany, and she arrived in South Africa on 25 February 2004.

In 2007, SAS &quot;Isandlwana&quot; took part in the Atlasur Exercise in cooperation with the fleets of Brazil and Chile.

==Status==
According to a presentation made to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence by Rear Admiral B.K. Mhlana, Deputy Chief of the Navy in May 2023, &quot;Isandlwana &quot; had been scheduled for a refit in both 2012 and 2018 but no work had been done to date. Her mid-life update was scheduled for 2024. The admiral described the ship as effectively non-operational until a refit could be completed.

==Namesake==
As with all the other ships of the Valour class, &quot;Isandlwana&quot; is named after a famous South African battle or instance of great valour. In this case the famous Battle of Isandlwana between the Zulu nation and the British Empire, at the beginning of the Anglo-Zulu War.

<doc id="1167843" wikidata="Q664902" url="?curid=1167843" title="Siemens Avenio">
<text>The Siemens Avenio is a low floor tram family produced by Siemens Mobility, a subsidiary of the German conglomerate Siemens. It is the successor to the Combino family. The first generation was sold as the Combino Supra , Combino MkII, or Combino Plus. With the introduction of the second generation in 2009 the Combino brand was dropped and Siemens have referred to Combino Plus trams in Almada (Portugal) and Budapest (Hungary) as part of the Avenio range.

The Avenio is made of stainless steel instead of light materials, and is manufactured at a new assembly line in Vienna. Like the Combino it utilizes a modular design with standardised components, with resulting reduced costs.

==Differences between the Combino and the Combino Supra==
Unlike the Combino, the Combino Supra is designed in fixed sections. Each section has a bogie, either powered or unpowered. The length can be anywhere from two sections () to eight (). In Budapest and Almad, modules are in two-car blocks, each connected by a double articulation joint. In the Combino and other articulated low-floor trams, the modules are suspended between the bogies. Siemens claims the axle load is for a width of , such as the Almada.

For Budapest, the length went from nine modules of the Combino to six for the Combino Supra.

The Combino had a half-width door near the driver&#x27;s cab, where the Combino Supra has a full double-leaf door.

==Combino Plus==
===Budapest===
The city transport company of Budapest ordered 40 Combino Supra Budapest NF 12B units for the city&#x27;s tram network. The six-module trams (three units of two sections) are 53.99 meters long, exceeded only by the 59.4 m CarGoTrams in Dresden, thus making them the longest passenger trams in the world at the time of their introduction. (In 2016 56 meters long CAF Urbos 3 trams entered service in Budapest.) The first two units were delivered on March 14, 2006, and the rest was delivered by the summer of 2007.

In the summer of 2006 problems arose. On August 1, 2006 Budapest mayor Gábor Demszky ordered all six trams to be withdrawn from service until technical problems were rectified. There were problems with the doors, caused by sensitive fail-safe systems that brought trams to a halt for reasons including luggage or the odd leg getting stuck in a door. Siemens AG reportedly admitted the door problem to be a &quot;design fault&quot;.

Another problem was the overhead wires, rebuilt in April and June for the new trams. This was done in a hurry and of poor quality, causing the Ganz trams still running to have problems with their pantographs. On July 15 one catenary mast fell to the road on Margaret Bridge, causing tram services to be suspended between Jászai Mari tér and Moszkva tér till July 25. In the last week of August the overhead was adjusted to prevent new problems from occurring.

The teething problems were eventually sorted out, and all 40 trams were in regular service by the summer of 2007. But Siemens realises further improvements in the ventilation (the vehicles were ordered without air conditioning, and later retrofitted), and door closing signals will be changed, after inhabitants of the streets passed complained that they are too loud by night.

===Almada===

Metro Transportes Sul de Tejo (MST) ordered 24 four-module Combino Plus vehicles for a new light rail system in Almada, south of Lisbon. The first unit was delivered by the end of May 2005, but after the problems with the Combino surfaced the order was converted to stainless steel-bodied Combinos, to be delivered by 2007.

===Melbourne===
Siemens leased Almada tram C008 to Melbourne&#x27;s tram network for research and development purposes. It entered service on Grand Prix shuttles on route 96 shuttles on 18 March 2007, before commencing a three-month stint on route 16 the following day, running alongside the classic Combino and other tram models.

===Toronto===
The Combino Plus was offered by Siemens in August 2007 in its bid to deliver 204 articulated, low-floor vehicles for the Toronto streetcar system as replacements for aging CLRVs and ALRVs. These three-module units were supposed to be in length, have a width of , and carry 183 passengers. Siemens withdrew their first bid, citing an inability to meet the TTC&#x27;s 25-percent Canadian content requirement. When tenders were reopened in August 2008, Siemens bid again using the same model, but their price was 50 percent higher than that of Bombardier&#x27;s locally built Flexity Outlook model, who subsequently won the bid.

== Siemens Avenio ==
The Avenio brand was introduced at the UITP 2009 trade fair in Vienna, marketed as the &quot;longest tram in the world&quot; with 100% low floor (referring to the 72 meter version with eight modules).

Avenio is based on the Siemens Combino Plus but is simplified. There is now one secondary spring which now seemingly can do the work of two. There are more seats over the bogies. There are no more hydraulics and the tram is made of CorTen steel. So in fact it is a completely new design.

=== Tel Aviv ===
It was announced that the first production series would go to Tel Aviv in Israel for its upcoming light rail network, but the project was delayed and the construction of the first line, the Red Line, started in September 2011. It will be in operational in 2016-2017 with the majority of stations underground. However, Tel Aviv Municipality later awarded the bid for rolling stock to rival CAF of Zaragoza, Spain instead.

=== The Hague ===

HTM Personenvervoer of The Hague in the Netherlands, the operator of the city&#x27;s tram network, announced in November 2011 the purchase of 40 Avenio trams. They will be long at a width of with a seating capacity of 70 and a standing capacity of 168. The contract is worth 100 million euro including driver training and spare parts. They are being built in Wien Simmering, with the bogies in Graz. In March 2014 it was announced a further 20 trams were being ordered. The first (5003) entered service on 2 November 2015 on Route 2. Power and braking is controlled by pedals.

=== Doha ===
A consortium led by Siemens built the tram system for Education City in Doha, the capital of Qatar. The opening was scheduled for autumn 2015 but was delayed to 2016. No overhead wires are installed, since the 10 Avenio trams is powered by the Siemens Sitras HES system (Hybrid Energy Storage), a combination of a supercapacitor and a traction battery that will be charged at each stop through an overhead conductor rail. The network has 25 stops on of track; the trams are in three modules with a capacity of 238 passengers.
=== Munich ===
On 28 September 2012, Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) of Munich, Germany, announced an order of 8 Avenio trams for that city&#x27;s tramway system. They are 36 m long, 2.3 m wide and have 4 modules. The contract was worth approx. 29 million Euros and it is understood that this allows six units to be built ahead of the Den Haag trams. Due to bad management and ongoing problems with the Stadler Variobahns the Avenios were necessary to deliver the advertised service improvements in the new timetable effective December 2013. They were supposed to be fully operational in little more than a year, however the first entered service on 17 September 2014 on Route 19.

=== Copenhagen ===
29 Avenios will operate Hovedstadens Letbane (Greater Copenhagen Light Rail) from its opening in 2025.

== Avenio M and Avenio HF==
For systems that still prefer to use the Combino concept, can order the &quot;Avenio M&quot;. Systems that require trams that can stop at high-platform stops, can order the &quot;Avenio HF&quot;.

<text>The Sidgwick Site is one of the largest sites within the University of Cambridge, England.

==Overview and history==

The Sidgwick Site is located on the western side of Cambridge city centre, near the Backs. The site is north of Sidgwick Avenue and south of West Road, and is home to several of the university&#x27;s arts and humanities faculties. The site is named after the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who studied at Cambridge in the 19th century. The site as it is now has its origins in plans drawn up by Casson and Conder in 1952 for making use of land to the west of the Cambridge city centre which was previously used as cricket grounds for Corpus Christi college. Much of the site&#x27;s current architecture derives from these original plans. However, many faculty buildings, especially to the north of the site, have been designed by separate architects with little reference to the coherence of the site as a whole. In July 2002, the old Faculty of English, a converted Victorian villa, was demolished, and a more practical building designed by Allies and Morrison to reflect the needs of the faculty was completed in 2004. The Alison Richard Building, completed in 2012 and designed by Nicholas Hare Architects, brings together a number of different research groups (Interdisciplinary Geographical Centres), the new department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS) and the Centre for Research in Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH).
On 29 October 2006, &quot;Education Not For Sale&quot; supporters at Cambridge University organised the first occupation in the UK in protest at the introduction of top-up fees on the Sidgwick Site Lecture Hall, occupying it for 12 hours. In 2009, Cambridge Gaza Solidarity occupied three lecture theatres and the common area of the law faculty. On 22 February 2022, Cambridge Defend Education, a student-led campaign group, occupied a lecture block declaring support for the current University and College Union strike. Cambridge Students&#x27; Union, although not directly involved in the occupation issued a statement in support of the action, declaring themselves opposed to the marketisation of education.

Although less popular now, the site was formerly a thriving location with the local skateboarding community because of its undercover benches, numerous sets of stairs and L-shaped concrete banks. These features have since been amended to discourage skateboarding.

==Faculties on the Sidgwick Site==

The following University of Cambridge faculties and departments are located on the site:

* Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies
* Faculty of Classics with the Museum of Classical Archaeology
* Faculty of English, incorporating the Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic
* Faculty of Music
* Faculty of History
* Faculty of Law
* Department of Politics and International Studies
* Faculty of Modern &amp; Medieval Languages
* Faculty of Economics
* Faculty of Divinity
* Faculty of Philosophy
* Institute of Criminology
* Centre of Latin American Studies

The Department of Land Economy is planned to move to the Sidgwick Site.

==Facilities==
The site has a buttery which sells snacks and drinks throughout the day with seating inside and a number of picnic tables outside. There is also an Origin8 which offers a soup of the day, hot panini and wraps, sandwiches, snacks, and various drinks, and a number of food and drink machines along with seating in basement of the law faculty building. The Modern &amp; Medieval Languages faculty has tea/coffee machines on all floors and a snack machine. On Thursdays, the English faculty provides &quot;tea at 3&quot; for students and faculty. There is also a nearby cafe popular with students named Harvey&#x27;s Coffee House, situated in the adjacent Harvey Court Building.

There is a student prayer room on the Sidgwick Site located at the back of Lecture Block A. Here, the University Islamic Society holds Jamaat five times a day.

<text>SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; (F147) is the third of four s for the South African Navy built by the European South African Corvette Consortium. She was named by Ms Thandi Modise, the then Chairperson of the Portfolio Committee on Defence, in Hamburg, Germany, on 4 June 2003.

==Construction==
They were manufactured by the European South African Corvette Consortium (ESACC), consisting of the German Frigate Consortium (Blohm+Voss, Thyssen Rheinstahl and Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werf), African Defence Systems (part of the French Thales Group defence company) and a number of South African companies.

The ships were built to the MEKO modular design concept, and they are designated by the manufacturer as the MEKO A-200SAN class. Some controversy exists as to the class type of the vessel, with both the manufacturer and the South African Navy referring to her as a &quot;corvette&quot;, but other similar vessels in other navies being referred to as frigates. Some have claimed that the use of the word corvette was a political decision made by the South African government to ease criticism of the procurement of the vessels.

SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; was built at the Blohm + Voss shipyards in Hamburg, Germany, and arrived in South Africa on 31 May 2004.

==Namesake==
As with all the other ships of the Valour class, &quot;Spioenkop&quot; is named after a famous South African battle or instance of great valour. In this case the famous Battle of Spion Kop between the Boers and Britain, during the Anglo-Boer War.

==Notable deployments==

===Exercise Whippet===
The South African Navy conducted its first combined tactical Exocet missile firing exercise when the frigates, SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; and SAS &quot;Mendi&quot;, fired two missiles (one from each frigate) at MFV &quot;Azalea&quot;, an old fishing trawler donated to the SA Navy by I&amp;J fishing company for use a target ship. The firing was conducted on 28 June 2007 in Exercise Area Pandora, south of Cape Point.

===Exercise Dolphin 2008===
A joint naval exercise between Ghana and South Africa. The following ships were involved in the exercise, SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; and the Ghanaian Naval vessels &quot;Anzone&quot;, &quot;Bonsu&quot;, &quot;Yogaga&quot;, &quot;Sero&quot; and &quot;Achimota&quot;. Activities included simulated opposed and unopposed boarding, fleet work as well as rescue assist. To add to this schedule there was a contingent of Ghanaian media representatives on board, who were ferried between the different vessels.

===Exercise Greenpoint 2008===
This was an exercise in preparation for the FIFA 2010 World Cup Soccer tournament, as part of Operation KGWELA. A combined exercise with SANDF and SAPS personnel took place over the period 13 to 19 March 2008 in Cape Town to formalise the air defence concept for the tournament.

===Operation Caraway 2008===
The ship conducted a three-month, six-country visit to the Far East. &quot;Spioenkop&quot; visited Singapore from 3–8 October, Shanghai in the People’s Republic of China from 16–20 October, Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia from 25–29 October, Ho Chi Minh City in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam from 31 October to 5 November), Cochin in India from 14–20 November and Port Louis in Mauritius from 26 November to 1 December. The ship conducted naval exercises with the Singaporean Navy, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Indian Navy and the Mauritian Coast Guard. The ship&#x27;s company also engaged in various diplomatic related activities with all the countries visited.

===FIFA World Cup 2010===
SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; patrolled the coast during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and provided its radar for anti-aircraft surveillance to boost security for the event.

===IBSAMAR II trilateral exercises 2010===
SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; took part in the trilateral exercise along with ships from the South African, Indian and Brazilian navies.

===Exercise Red Lion===
Held annually, Exercise Red Lion is run by Fleet Command and concentrates its efforts on preparing all available vessels for future Force Employment as a Task Group. The latest exercise was held between 4 and 15 March 2013 around Cape Town.

===Exercise Shared Accord 2013===
SAS &quot;Spioenkop&quot; participated in a beach landing exercise on 29 July as part of the bilateral Exercise Shared Accord between the United States and South Africa.

===Interop West Deployment 2013===
The ship conducted a six-week Military Diplomatic Mission to the West Coast of Africa from October to November. She visited Namibia, Angola, Nigeria, Ghana, Equatorial Guinea and Senegal.

===Operation Copper 2013-2014===
The ship conducted a five-month anti-piracy mission in the Mozambique Channel from 28 December 2013 to 14 May 2014. The mission for Operation Copper is to provide maritime security and prevent piracy in the Mozambique Channel. The vessel was relieved by the offshore patrol vessel .

==Refits==

After the ship returned from her deployment on Operation Vikela as part of the SADC Mission in Mozambique, &quot;Spioenkop&quot; was scheduled to enter an extensive maintenance period. According to a presentation made to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence by Rear Admiral B.K. Mhlana, Deputy Chief of the Navy in May 2023, &quot;Spioenkop&quot; had been scheduled for refits in both 2013 and 2019 but no work had been done to date. Her mid-life update was scheduled for 2025. The admiral described the ship as effectively non-operational until a refit could be completed.

<text>Dongseong (?–501, r. 479–501) was the 24th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He was the son of Buyeo Gonji, the younger brother of the 22nd king Munju who returned to Baekje from Yamato Japan in 477 after hearing of the fall of the Baekje capital. Gonji died that same year, and like Munju, he may have been murdered by Hae Gu. Dongseong appears to have been promoted to the throne by the Jin clan, which prevailed over Hae Gu&#x27;s rebellion. After Samgeun died without children, the throne passed to Dongseong.

==Reign==
He worked to strengthen the court&#x27;s power after the move of the capital from the present-day Seoul area to Ungjin. He built several fortresses and castles to build out the new capital. He incorporated the local Sa, Yeon, and Baek clans into the court to counter the entrenched aristocracy from the former capital.

Dongseong sent a tribute mission to the Southern Qi in 484, reopening Baekje&#x27;s ties with southern China after a long hiatus.

He established an alliance with Silla through his marriage of a Silla noblewoman in 493, and the two countries united in attacking Goguryeo in 495.

In 498, the Baekje army subjugated Tamna, the kingdom on Jeju Island which had formally accepted Baekje rule twenty-two years before, because it failed to send tributes.

The Book of Qi states that Dongseong sent armies to Liaodong and Liaoxi (요서 遼西) in China to defeat Goguryeo forces.

==Death==
Beginning in 499, the country was stricken by famine, but according to the &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; the king was unresponsive. He continued to live an indulgent lifestyle while brigandage spread.

By the end of Dongseong&#x27;s rule, the local clans of the new capital had eclipsed the traditionally powerful Hae and Jin clans, and even pressured the throne. Dongseong sought to contain them by exiling Baek Ga to an outlying castle. This caused great resentment, and Baek Ga&#x27;s forces assassinated Dongseong while he was hunting.

==Family==
* Father: Buyeo Gonji (son of the 21st King, Gaero of Baekje)
* Mother: unknown
*** Queen: unknown
** Son: Buyeo Sama/Buyeo Yung (扶餘斯摩/扶餘隆, 462–523) – 25th King of Baekje, Muryeong of Baekje
*** Concubine: unknown – from the Jin clan
*** Concubine: unknown – from Lee clan of Silla (伊飡 比智女를), married 493
**** Daughter: Princess Bogwa () – consort of the 23rd King of Silla, Beopheung of Silla.

<doc id="1167853" wikidata="Q5429000" url="?curid=1167853" title="Faculty of Law, University of Cambridge">
<text>The Faculty of Law, Cambridge is the law school of the University of Cambridge.

The study of law at the University of Cambridge began in the thirteenth century. The faculty sits the oldest law professorship in the English-speaking world, the Regius Professorship of Civil Law, which was founded by Henry VIII in 1540 with a stipend of £40 per year for which the holder is still chosen by The Crown. 

The present-day faculty incorporates the Institute of Criminology as well as 11 Research Centres, including the world&#x27;s leading research institute for international law, The Lauterpacht Centre for International Law. The faculty has 31 professors, six readers, and over 70 other university, faculty and college teaching officers. The student body comprises about 700 undergraduate and 250 postgraduate students. It is also home to the Cambridge University Law Society, the largest student-run law society in the United Kingdom and among the largest in the world.

== Courses offered ==
The BA Tripos undergraduate degree at Cambridge is intended to give a thorough grounding in the principles of law viewed from an academic rather than a vocational perspective. The faculty offers the following postgraduate degrees: the LLM, the MCL, the MLitt, the MPhil in Criminology, the MPhil in Criminological Research, the M.St in Applied Criminology, Penology and Management, the M.St in Applied Criminology and Police Management, the PhD in Criminology, and the PhD in Law. In addition, the faculty offers the Postgraduate Diploma in Legal Studies and the Postgraduate Diploma in International Law.

== Rankings and reputation ==
Cambridge is unanimously ranked as the best law school in the UK by all major national academic league tables. It is currently ranked first by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times/The Sunday Times&#x27; Good University Guide&quot;, and &quot;The Complete University Guide.&quot; Since it started publishing its annual rankings for 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; has ranked Cambridge first six times (2010, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018). &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot; has given the top spot to Cambridge since 2013 and eight times in the last 11 years. The &quot;Times&quot; &quot;Good University Guide&quot; law rankings has Cambridge atop its league table since 2014.

In 2021, THE ranked Cambridge as the world&#x27;s second best university for law in its 2021 subject rankings. In 2021, the QS World University Rankings ranked Cambridge as the world&#x27;s third best university for law and legal studies.

== Facilities ==

===David Williams Building===

The faculty is housed in the David Williams Building on the university&#x27;s Sidgwick Site in Cambridge. The building is named after the university&#x27;s first full-time vice-chancellor and professor of public law, Professor Sir David Williams. It opened in 1996 and was designed by Lord Norman Foster of Thames Bank, who also designed the terminal building at Stansted Airport and 30 St Mary Axe (the &quot;Gherkin&quot; in London). The building suffered serious acoustic problems (primarily due to a lack of consideration of acoustics in Foster&#x27;s design), with its form amplifying any noise from the lower levels and causing significant disturbance at higher levels, not least in the library. This was fixed in 1999 with the installation of a glazed acoustic screen, separating quiet areas from noisy ones. Other issues still remain: the toilets in the building are often out of order due to plumbing issues. Additionally, due to an excessive focus on the design of the study spaces, the toilets appear to have been an afterthought, being unbearably small and cramped.

The David Williams Building contains the university&#x27;s Squire Law Library, together with offices, lecture and seminar rooms and common room facilities.

=== Squire Law Library ===

The Squire Law Library, which occupies the majority of the first, second and third floors of the building, is a dependent library of Cambridge University Library. It contains one of the three largest legal collections in the UK with more than 180,000 volumes. The collection is very strong across UK law, the law of other major common law countries (the United States, Australia, Canada and New Zealand), international law and the law of the European Union, France and Germany. There are also smaller collections for the law of many other countries. The library provides its users with access to many major legal databases.

The library was founded in 1904, at first with only 8,000 volumes, although this soon increased. In 1934, together with the Seeley Historical Library, it moved to the Cockerell Building on Senate House Passage, previously the home of the University Library built in 1837–42. The Squire took over the whole of the Cockerell Building on the construction of James Stirling&#x27;s building for the history library in 1968. With the Squire&#x27;s own move in turn, its former site became the library of Gonville and Caius College.

Most individual colleges also have a smaller law library of their own, while the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law has its own library composed of international law books and other related materials.

== Societies ==
There are a number of groups and societies based around the Faculty of Law:
* Cambridge University Law Society
* Cambridge Societies at the Inns of Court (Gray&#x27;s Inn, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and Middle Temple)
* Graduate Law Society
* The Cambridge University Society for Women Lawyers
* Cambridge University Students&#x27; Pro Bono Society
* Cambridge Pro Bono Project
Most colleges also have their own law societies.

* University of Cambridge Faculty of Law Legal Studies Research Paper Series 
* The Cambridge Law Journal
* International Law Reports
* Clarendon Studies in Criminology (joint venture with the criminology centres at Oxford and the London School of Economics)

<doc id="1167856" wikidata="Q1974839" url="?curid=1167856" title="Chinese Filipinos">
<text>Chinese Filipinos (sometimes referred as Filipino Chinese in the Philippines) are Filipinos of Chinese descent with ancestry mainly from Fujian, but are typically born and raised in the Philippines. Chinese Filipinos are one of the largest overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia.

Chinese immigration to the Philippines occurred mostly during the Spanish colonization of the islands between the 16th and 19th centuries, attracted by the lucrative trade of the Manila galleons. During this era, they were referred as the Sangley, who were mostly the Hokkien-speaking Hokkien people, who later became the dominant group within the Filipino-Chinese community. In the 19th century, migration was triggered by the corrupt and bad governance of the late Qing dynasty, combined with economic problems in China due to the Western and Japanese colonial wars and Opium Wars. It subsequently continued during the 20th century, from American colonial times, through the post-independence era to Cold War, to the present. In 2013, according to older records held by the Senate of the Philippines, there were approximately 1.35 million ethnic (or pure) Chinese within the Philippine population, while Filipinos with any Chinese descent comprised 22.8 million of the population. However, the actual current figures are not known since the Philippine census does not usually take into account questions about ethnicity. Accordingly, the oldest Chinatown in the world is located in Binondo, Manila, founded on December 8, 1594.

Chinese Filipinos are a well established middle class ethnic group and are well represented in all levels of Filipino society. Chinese Filipinos also play a leading role in the Philippine business sector and dominate the Philippine economy today. Most in the current list of the Philippines&#x27; richest each year comprise Taipan billionaires of Chinese Filipino background. Some in the list of the political families in the Philippines are also of Chinese Filipino background, meanwhile the bulk are also of Spanish-colonial-era Chinese mestizo (&quot;mestizo de Sangley&quot;) descent, of which, many families of such background also compose a considerable part of the Philippine population especially its bourgeois, who during the late Spanish Colonial Era in the late 19th century, produced a major part of the &quot;ilustrado&quot; intelligentsia of the late Spanish Colonial Philippines, that were very influential with the creation of Filipino nationalism and the sparking of the Philippine Revolution as part of the foundation of the First Philippine Republic and subsequent sovereign independent Philippines.

==Identity==
The organization &quot;Kaisa para sa Kaunlaran&quot; (Unity for Progress) omits the hyphen for the term Chinese Filipino, as the term is a noun. &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; and the APA, among others, also omits the hyphen. When used as an adjective as a whole, it may take on a hyphenated form or may remain unchanged.

There are various universally accepted terms used in the Philippines to refer to Chinese Filipinos:
*Chinese (Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin )—generalized term referring to any and all Chinese people in or outside the Philippines in general regardless of nationality or place of birth.
*Chinese Filipino, Filipino Chinese or Philippine Chinese (Philippine &quot;Chinoy&quot;; Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin )—refers to people with some level of Han Chinese ethnicity with Philippine nationality and to people of Han Chinese ethnicity with Chinese nationality (either PRC or ROC) or whichever nationality but were born or mainly raised in the Philippines and usually have permanent residency. This also includes Chinese Filipinos who now live and/or were born overseas, but still have close ties to the community in the Philippines.
**Hokkienese / Fukienese / Fujianese / Fookienese (Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin )—terms referring to Chinese Filipinos whose predominant ancestry is from Fujian Province in China, especially the Hokkien-speaking region in Southern Fujian. Chinese Filipinos of this background typically have Philippine Hokkien as a heritage language, though just as any Chinese Filipino may also normally speak Philippine English, Filipino/Tagalog or other Philippine languages (such as Visayan languages) and may also code-switch any and all of these languages, such as Taglish, Bislish, Hokaglish, etc.
**Cantonese (Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin )—terms referring to Chinese Filipinos whose ancestry is from Guangdong Province in China, especially the Taishanese or Cantonese-speaking regions.
*Chinese mestizo (Philippine ; Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin )—refers to people who are of mixed Han Chinese and indigenous Filipino ancestry, a common and historical phenomenon in the Philippines especially families tracing from the Spanish colonial times. Those with 75% Han Chinese ancestry or more are typically not considered to be characteristically mestizo. Many Chinese mestizos are still Chinese Filipinos, though some with more indigenous Filipino ancestry or family or have just had a very long family history of living and assimilating to life in the Philippines may no longer identify as Chinese Filipino.
*Mainland Chinese, Mainlander (Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin )—refers to any PRC citizens from China (PRC), especially those of Han Chinese ethnicity with Chinese nationality that were raised in China (PRC).
*Taiwanese (Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Taiwanese Mandarin )—refers to ROC citizens from Taiwan (ROC), especially those of Han Chinese ethnicity with Republic of China (Taiwan) nationality that were raised in Taiwan (ROC).
*Hongkonger (Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin , Cantonese )—refers to people from Hong Kong, especially those of Han Chinese ethnicity with Hong Kong (SAR) residency or Hong Kong British National (Overseas) status that were born or raised in Hong Kong (SAR) or British Hong Kong.
*Macanese (Filipino/; Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin , Cantonese )—refers to people from Macau, especially those of Han Chinese ethnicity with Macau permanent residency that were born or raised in Macau (SAR) or Portuguese Macau.
*tornatrás or torna atrás—obsolete Spanish term referring to people who are of varying mixtures of Han Chinese, Spanish and indigenous Filipino during the Spanish Colonial Period of the Philippines.
*Sangley—obsolete term referring to people of unmixed Chinese ancestry, especially fresh first generation Chinese migrants, during the Spanish Colonial Period of the Philippines. The mixed equivalents were likewise the above terms, &quot;mestizo de Sangley&quot; and &quot;tornatrás&quot;.

Other terms being used with reference to China include:
*華人 – &quot;Hoâ-jîn&quot; or &quot;Huárén&quot;—a generic term for referring to Chinese people, without implication as to nationality
*華僑 – &quot;Hoâ-kiâo&quot; or &quot;Huáqiáo&quot;—Overseas Chinese, usually China-born Chinese who have emigrated elsewhere
*華裔 – &quot;Hoâ-è&quot; or &quot;Huáyì&quot;—People of Chinese ancestry who were born in, residents of and citizens of another country

&quot;Indigenous Filipino&quot; or simply &quot;Filipino&quot;, is used in this article to refer to the Austronesian inhabitants prior to the Spanish Conquest of the islands. During the Spanish Colonial Period, the term &quot;indio&quot; was used.

However, intermarriages occurred mostly during the Spanish colonial period because Chinese immigrants to the Philippines up to the 19th century were predominantly male. It was only in the 20th century that Chinese women and children came in comparable numbers. Today, Chinese Filipino male and female populations are practically equal in numbers. Chinese mestizos, as a result from intermarriages during the Spanish colonial period, then often opted to marry other Chinese or Chinese mestizos. Generally, Chinese mestizos is a term referring to people with one Chinese parent.

By this definition, the ethnically Chinese Filipino comprise 1.8% (1.35 million) of the population. This figure however does not include the Chinese mestizos who since Spanish times have formed a part of the middle class in Philippine society nor does it include Chinese immigrants from the People&#x27;s Republic of China since 1949.

==History==
===Early interactions===
Ethnic Han Chinese sailed around the Philippines from the 9th century onward and frequently interacted with the local Austronesian people. Chinese and Austronesian interactions initially commenced as bartering and items. This is evidenced by a collection of Chinese artifacts found throughout Philippine waters, dating back to the 10th century. Since Song dynasty times in China and precolonial times in the Philippines, evidence of trade contact can already be observed in the Chinese ceramics found in archaeological sites, like in Santa Ana, Manila.

&lt;/gallery&gt;In the year 972 AD, the Song dynasty annals briefly mentioned &quot;麻逸&quot; (Ma-i, or in Hokkien ) which is generally accepted to be located in Mindoro island, southwest of Manila. A year earlier, the annals recorded traders from Ma-i coming to Canton, and then in 982 AD. In the 11th century, the states—or chief settlements—recorded by the local Bureau of Maritime Trade are Butuan, written in records as &quot;蒲端&quot; (Hokkien ) and Sanmalan recorded as &quot;三麻蘭&quot; (Hokkien ), whose traders presented themselves as tribute-paying envoys to China. They continued trade with the Song court in the years 1004, 1007 and 1011 and brought home Chinese ceramics. A century later, in addition to Ma-i, the bureau then recorded another states from the Philippines Baipuer (Babuyan Islands) and the group of islands collectively known as &quot;Sandao&quot; or &quot;Sanyu&quot; which were Jamayan (now Calamian, recorded as &quot;加麻延&quot;(Hokkien )), Balaoyu (Palawan, recorded as &quot;巴姥酉&quot;(Hokkien )), and Pulihuan (approximate location is Manila, or areas near it, recorded as &quot;蒲裏喚&quot;(Hokkien )). These native traders mostly belonged to the elite. In a Song dynasty record, a man from Sandao was treated with respect after he returned home from Quanzhou for a unique tradition seemed to have stemmed from the native&#x27;s village that a man who had been to China was revered. In 1007 AD, a local chief from Butuan sent an envoy to China, requesting an equal status with Champa, however, this was rejected for the Song court appear to have favored Champa.

While there is evidence that the Chinese had interactions with the island of Luzon and Mindanao, for the Visayas, not all historians agree such as William Henry Scott, and Isabelo de los Reyes. Both authors claimed that the Chinese only began to arrive in the early colonial period, and the latter claimed that by the administration of Lakan Dula, Luzon (or sometimes referring to Manila) had monopolized the articles distributed by the Chinese and sometimes by the Japanese. In the Philippine Islands by Blair and Robertson, Chao Ju-Kua from the 13th century mentioned &quot;&quot;San-hsii&quot;,&quot; which they believed to be the Visayas islands, however no other historian has affirmed nor investigated this claim.

===Spanish colonization of the Philippines (16th century–1898)===


When the Spaniards arrived in the Philippines, there was already a significant population of migrants from China all of whom were male due to the relationship between the &quot;barangays&quot; (city-states) of the island of Luzon and the Ming dynasty. &quot;Sangley&quot; was the term used during the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines to refer to any ethnic Chinese person, regardless of specific ancestral origin in China. In the case of the Philippines, majority came from the province of Fujian in China, mostly the Southern Min people in Southern Fujian, specifically the Hokkien people, who speak southern Fujian&#x27;s Hokkien language (referred also in the Philippines as Fukien or Fookien). The Hokkien people have their own unique culture, language, and religious belief systems, different from other ethnic groups in China.

The first encounter of the Spanish authorities with the Chinese occurred when several Chinese pirates under the leadership of Limahong attacked and besieged the newly established capital of Manila in 1574. The pirates tried to capture the city but were defeated by the combined Spanish and native forces under the leadership of Juan de Salcedo in 1575. Almost simultaneously, the Chinese imperial admiral Homolcong arrived in Manila where he was well received. On his departure he took with him two priests, who became the first Catholic missionaries in China sent from the Philippines. This visit was followed by the arrival of Chinese ships in Manila in May 1603 bearing Chinese officials with the seal of the Ming Empire. This led to suspicions that the Chinese had sent a fleet to try to conquer the islands. However, seeing the city&#x27;s strong defenses, the Chinese made no hostile moves. They returned to China without showing any particular motive for the journey and without either side mentioning the apparent motive. Fortifications of Manila were started, with a Chinese settler in Manila named Engcang, who offered his services to the governor. He was refused and a plan to massacre the Spaniards quickly spread among the Chinese inhabitants of Manila. The revolt was quickly crushed by the Spaniards, ending in a large-scale massacre of the non-Catholic Sangley in Manila.

The Spanish authorities started restricting the activities of the Chinese immigrants and confined them to the &quot;Parían&quot; near Intramuros. With low chances of employment and prohibited from owning land, most of them engaged in small businesses or acted as skilled artisans to the Spanish colonial authorities.

The Spanish authorities differentiated the Chinese immigrants into two groups: &quot;Parían&quot; (unconverted) and &quot;Binondo&quot; (converted). Many immigrants converted to Catholicism and due to the lack of Chinese women, intermarried with indigenous women and adopted Hispanized names and customs. The children of unions between indigenous Filipinos and Chinese were called Mestizos de Sangley or Chinese mestizos, while those between Spaniards and Chinese were called Tornatrás. The Chinese population originally occupied the Binondo area although eventually they spread all over the islands, and became traders, moneylenders and landowners.

In the late 18th century, Fr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga conducted a census of the Archdiocese of Manila, which held most of Luzon under its spiritual care, and he reported that the tributes represented an average family of 5 to 7 per tribute; in which case there were 90,243 native Filipino tributes; 10,512 Chinese (Sangley) and mixed Chinese Filipino mestizo tributes; and 10,517 mixed Spanish Filipino mestizo tributes. Pure Spaniards were not counted, as they were exempt from tribute. Out of these, Fr. Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga estimated a total population count exceeding half a million souls with Chinese and Chinese Mestizos forming 10,512 of the total tribute of 110,000+. In the provinces: Pampanga was home to 870 Chinese Filipino tributes/families, the City of Pasig has had half of its 3000 tributes/families at 1,500 be Chinese Filipinos. In 1603, Manila itself was also home to 25,000 Chinese immigrants. Ilocos which was a separate bisphoric from the Archdiocese of Manila had a comparatively large Chinese population which numbered 10,041 Chinese Filipino families. The province of Laguna had 2,000 Chinese-Filipino farmers/families. Biñan on the other hand had 256 Chinese-Filipino tributes. 

The Spanish, who initially viewed the Sangley as a good source of manpower and commerce for the colony, gradually had shifting perspectives due to presupposed threats of Chinese invasion, which historically never materialized. Regardless, the Spanish, including the clergy, sought ways to justify the limiting or expulsion of the Sangley population in the Philippines. The main contentions were often on religious morality grounds, such as vices of sodomy by homosexuals, gambling, greed and the like that Spanish friars identified among non-Christian Sangley.

===Chinese mestizos as Filipinos===
During the Philippine Revolution of 1898, &quot;Mestizos de Sangley&quot; (Chinese mestizos) would eventually refer to themselves as &quot;Filipino&quot;, which during that time referred to Spaniards born in the Philippines. The Chinese mestizos would later fan the flames of the Philippine Revolution. Many leaders of the Philippine Revolution themselves have substantial Chinese ancestry. These include Emilio Aguinaldo, Andrés Bonifacio, Marcelo del Pilar, Antonio Luna, José Rizal and Manuel Tinio.

===Chinese mestizos in the Visayas===
Sometime in the year 1750, an adventurous young man named Wo Sing Lok, also known as &quot;Sin Lok&quot; arrived in Manila, Philippines. The 12-year-old traveler came from Amoy, the old name for Xiamen, an island known in ancient times as &quot;Gateway to China&quot;—near the mouth of Jiulong &quot;Nine Dragon&quot; River in the southern part of Fujian Province.

Earlier in Manila, immigrants from China were herded to stay in the Chinese trading center called &quot;Parian&quot;. After the Sangley Revolt of 1603, this was destroyed and burned by the Spanish authorities. Three decades later, Chinese traders built a new and bigger Parian near Intramuros.

For fear of a Chinese uprising similar to that in Manila, the Spanish authorities implementing the royal decree of Gov. Gen. Juan de Vargas dated July 17, 1679, rounded up the Chinese in Iloilo and hamletted them in the parian (now Avanceña Street). It compelled all local unmarried Chinese to live in the Parian and all married Chinese to stay in Binondo. Similar Chinese enclaves or &quot;Parian&quot; were later established in Camarines Sur, Cebu and Iloilo.

Sin Lok together with the progenitors of the Lacson, Sayson, Ditching, Layson, Ganzon, Sanson and other families who fled Southern China during the reign of the despotic Qing dynasty (1644–1912) in the 18th century and arrived in Maynilad; finally, decided to sail farther south and landed at the port of Batiano river to settle permanently in &quot;Parian&quot; near La Villa Rica de Arevalo in Iloilo.

===American colonial era (1898–1946)===
During the American colonial period, the Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States was also put into effect in the Philippines. Nevertheless, the Chinese were able to settle in the Philippines with the help of other Chinese Filipinos, despite strict American law enforcement, usually through &quot;adopting&quot; relatives from Mainland or by assuming entirely new identities with new names.

The privileged position of the Chinese as middlemen of the economy under Spanish colonial rule quickly fell, as the Americans favored the &quot;principalía&quot; (educated elite) formed by Chinese mestizos and Spanish mestizos. As American rule in the Philippines started, events in Mainland China starting from the Taiping Rebellion, Chinese Civil War and Boxer Rebellion led to the fall of the Qing dynasty, which led thousands of Chinese from Fujian in China to migrate &quot;en masse&quot; to the Philippines to avoid poverty, worsening famine and political persecution. This group eventually formed the bulk of the current population of unmixed Chinese Filipinos.
===Formation of the Chinese Filipino identity (1946–1975)===
Beginning in World War II, Chinese soldiers and guerrillas joined in the fight against the Japanese Imperial Forces during the Japanese Occupation in the Philippines (1941–1945). On April 9, 1942, many Chinese Filipino Prisoners of War were killed by Japanese Forces during the Bataan Death March after the fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942. Chinese Filipinos were integrated in the U.S. Armed Forces of the First &amp; Second Filipino Infantry Regiments of the United States Army. After the Fall of Bataan and Corregidor in 1942, Chinese Filipinos joined as soldiers in a military unit of the Philippine Commonwealth Army under the U.S. military command as a ground arm of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) which started the battles between the Japanese Counter-Insurgencies and Allied Liberators from 1942 to 1945 to fight against the Japanese Imperial forces. Some Chinese Filipinos who joined as soldiers were integrated into the 11th, 14th, 15th, 66th &amp; 121st Infantry Regiment of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Philippines – Northern Luzon (USAFIP-NL) under the military unit of the Philippine Commonwealth Army started the Liberation in Northern Luzon and aided the provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Abra, Mountain Province, Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Vizcaya in attacking Imperial Japanese forces. Many Chinese Filipinos joined the guerrilla movement of the Philippine-Chinese Anti-Japanese guerrilla resistance fighter unit or Wha-Chi Movement, the Ampaw Unit under Colonel Chua Sy Tiao and the Chinese Filipino 48th Squadron since 1942 to 1946 in attacking Japanese forces. Thousands of Chinese Filipino soldiers and guerrillas died of heroism in the Philippines from 1941 to 1945 during World War II. Thousands of Chinese Filipino veterans are interred in the Shrine of Martyr&#x27;s Freedom of the Filipino Chinese in World War II located in Manila. The new-found unity between the ethnic Chinese migrants and the indigenous Filipinos against a common enemy – the Japanese, served as a catalyst in the formation of a Chinese Filipino identity who started to regard the Philippines as their home.

===Chinese as aliens under the Marcos regime (1975–1986)===
Under the administration of Ferdinand Marcos, Chinese Filipinos called &quot;lao cao&quot; (Philippine Hokkien , meaning &quot;old people&quot; or literally, &quot;old monkey&quot; (a comedic reference to the Monkey King (Sun Wukong) from the old famous Chinese classical novel, &quot;Journey to the West&quot;)), i.e., Chinese in the Philippines who acquired citizenship, referred only to those who arrived in the country before World War II. Those who arrived after the war were called the &quot;jiu qiao&quot; (Mandarin ). They were residents who came from China (also usually southern Fujian) via British Hong Kong, such as through North Point, Causeway Bay, or Kowloon Bay, between the 1950s to 1980s.

Chinese schools in the Philippines, which were governed by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of China (Taiwan), were transferred under the jurisdiction of the Philippine government&#x27;s Department of Education. Virtually all Chinese schools were ordered closed or else to limit the time allotted for Chinese language, history and culture subjects from four hours to two hours and instead devote them to the study of Filipino languages and culture. Marcos&#x27; policies eventually led to the formal assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos into mainstream Filipino society, the majority were granted citizenship, under the administration of Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos.

Following the February 1986 People Power Revolution (EDSA 1), the Chinese Filipinos quickly gained national spotlight as Cory Aquino, a Tarlac Chinese mestiza from the influential Cojuangco family took up the Presidency.

===Return of democracy (1986–2000)===
Despite getting better protections, crimes against Chinese Filipinos were still present, the same way as crimes against other ethnic groups in the Philippines, as the country was still battling the lingering economic effects of the Marcos regime. All these led to the formation of the first Chinese Filipino organization, Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran, Inc. (Unity for Progress) by Teresita Ang See which called for mutual understanding between the ethnic Chinese and the native Filipinos. Aquino encouraged free press and cultural harmony, a process which led to the burgeoning of the Chinese-language media During this time, the third wave of Chinese migrants came. They are known as the &quot;xin qiao&quot; (Mandarin ), tourists or temporary visitors with fake papers, fake permanent residencies or fake Philippine passports that started coming starting the 1990s during the administration of Fidel Ramos and Joseph Estrada.

===21st century (2001–present)===
More Chinese Filipinos were given Philippine citizenship during the 21st century. Chinese influence in the country increased during the pro-China presidency of Gloria Arroyo. Businesses by Chinese Filipinos were said to have improved under Benigno Aquino&#x27;s presidency, while mainland Chinese migration into the Philippines decreased due to Aquino&#x27;s pro-Filipino and pro-American approach in handling disputes with China. &quot;Xin qiao&quot; Chinese migration from mainland China into the Philippines intensified from 2016 up to the present, due to controversial pro-China policies by the Rodrigo Duterte presidency, prioritizing Chinese POGO businesses.

The Chinese Filipino community have expressed concerns over the ongoing disputes between China and the Philippines, which majority preferring peaceful approaches to the dispute to safeguard their own private businesses. The community has also expressed concerns over the increased anti-Chinese sentiment from other Filipinos resulting from issues surrounding the POGO businesses and investigations on the background of former Bamban mayor Alice Guo, who was accused by the authorities of having connections with a POGO business in the said municipality.

==Origins==
Most Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines are Hokkien people, historically speaking Hokkien. Many Chinese Filipinos are either fourth-, third-, or second-generation; in general natural-born Philippine citizens who can still recognize their Chinese roots and have Chinese relatives in China, as well as in other Southeast Asian, Australasian or North American countries.

According to a study of around 30,000 gravestones in the Manila Chinese Cemetery of Metro Manila with marked birthplaces or ancestral places of the interred, 89.26% were from within the Hokkien-speaking Southern Min region in Southern Fujian, while 9.86% were from Cantonese regions in Guangdong (Canton) province. More specifically on those of the Southern Min region, 65.01% hailed from Jinjiang () [from coastal Quanzhou], 17.25% from Nan&#x27;an () [from coastal Quanzhou], 7.94% from Xiamen () (Xiamen city proper), 2.90% from Hui&#x27;an () [from coastal Quanzhou], 1.52% from Longxi () [within Longhai, coastal Zhangzhou], 1.21% from Siming () [southern district of Xiamen or Xiamen itself], 1.14% from Quanzhou () (Quanzhou city proper), 1.10% from Tong&#x27;an () [from coastal Xiamen], 0.83% from Shishi () [from coastal Quanzhou], 0.57% from Yongchun () [from inland Quanzhou], and 0.53% from Anxi () [from inland Quanzhou].

According to a study in March 27 to 29, 2005 by two scholars, Gyo Miyabara and Ito Jimenez, in Metro Cebu, they inspected 1,436 gravestones of Chinese Filipinos in five cemeteries of Cebu, namely Cebu Memorial Park, Queen City Memorial Park, Manila Memorial Park Cebu (Liloan), Cebu Chinese Cemetery (宿務華僑義山), and Ludo Memorial Park. The gravestones inspected with marked birthplaces or ancestral places from China of those interred were as follows, 669 graves (46.6%) hailed from Jinjiang () [from coastal Quanzhou], 362 graves (25.2%) from Nan&#x27;an () [from coastal Quanzhou], 147 graves (10.2%) from Huli district (, former ) [from northern Xiamen], 80 graves (5.6%) from Siming district () [from southern Xiamen], 46 graves (3.2%) from Kinmen (), 31 graves (2.2%) from Guangdong (), 11 graves (0.8%) from Shishi () [from coastal Quanzhou], and 45 graves (3.1%) from other parts of China or left unlabeled.

===Hokkien (Fujianese / Hokkienese / Fukienese / Fookienese / Hoklo) people===
Chinese Filipinos who have roots as Hokkien people (福建人/閩南人) predominantly have ancestors who came from Southern Fujian and usually speak or at least have Philippine Hokkien as heritage language. They form the bulk of Chinese settlers in the Philippines during or after the Spanish Colonial Period, and settled or spread primarily from Metro Manila and key cities in Luzon such as Angeles City, Baguio, Dagupan, Ilagan, Laoag, Lucena, Tarlac and Vigan, as well as in major Visayan and Mindanao cities such as Bacolod, Cagayan de Oro, Cotabato, Metro Cebu, Metro Davao, Dumaguete, General Santos, Iligan, Metro Iloilo, Ormoc, Tacloban, Tagbilaran and Zamboanga.

Hokkien peoples, also known in &quot;Fukienese / Hokkienese / Fookienese / Fujianese&quot; or in Philippine Hokkien or in Mandarin , form 98.7% of all unmixed ethnic Chinese in the Philippines. Of the Hokkien peoples, about 75% are from Quanzhou Prefecture (especially around Jinjiang City), 23% are from Zhangzhou Prefecture and 2% are from Xiamen City.

The Hokkien-descended Chinese Filipinos currently dominate the light and heavy industries, as well as the entrepreneurial and real estate sectors of the Philippine economy. Many younger Hokkien-descended Chinese Filipinos are also entering the fields of banking, computer science, engineering, finance and medicine.

To date, most emigrants and permanent residents from Mainland China, as well as the vast majority of Taiwanese people in the Philippines are also of Hokkien background.

===Teochews===
Linguistically related to the Hokkien people are the Teochew (Philippine Hokkien or in Mandarin ).

They migrated in large numbers to the Philippines during the Spanish Period to the main Luzon island of the Philippines, such as the famed smuggler, Limahong (林阿鳳), and his followers who were originally from Raoping, Chaozhou, but later on were eventually assimilated by intermarriage with the mainstream Hokkien.

The Teochews are often mistaken for being Hokkien.

===Cantonese people===
Chinese Filipinos who have roots as Cantonese people (Cantonese ) have ancestors who came from Guangdong Province and speak or at least have Cantonese or Taishanese as heritage language. They settled down in Metro Manila, as well as in major cities of Luzon such as Baguio City, Angeles City, Naga and Olongapo. Many also settled in the provinces of Northern Luzon (e.g., Benguet, Cagayan, Ifugao, Ilocos Norte) especially around Baguio. Examples of those of Cantonese descent are people like Ma Mon Luk, the Tecson and families descended from the three &quot;Tek Sun&quot; brothers from Guangzhou (Canton), Guangdong.

The Cantonese people (Philippine Hokkien , Mandarin ) form roughly 1.2% of the unmixed ethnic Chinese population of the Philippines, with large numbers of descendants originally from either Taishan, Kaiping, Macau, Hong Kong, Canton (Guangzhou), or nearby areas transiting from either Macau, Hong Kong, Guangzhou (Canton). Many were/are not as economically prosperous as the Hokkien Chinese Filipinos. Barred from owning land during the Spanish Colonial Period, most Cantonese were into the service industry, working as artisans, miners, househelpers, bakers, shoemakers, metal workers, barbers, herbal physicians, porters (&quot;cargadores / coulis&quot;), soap makers and tailors. They also intermarried with other local Filipinos during the Spanish Colonial Era and many of their descendants are now assimilated as Chinese mestizos. There are also those that came during the American Colonial Period before WW2 especially in Baguio as part of the 700 Chinese (Cantonese) coolie laborers recruited from British Hong Kong by the British managing the Manila Railroad Company for the construction of the Benguet Road (Kennon Road) along with the Japanese (who also later stayed to become Japanese Filipinos) and other lowland Filipinos. In Baguio, Cantonese Chinese were known for their carpentry, masonry, and culinary skills, where they were employed in hotels and places like Camp John Hay and they set up businesses like restaurants, grocery stores, bazaars, hardware stores, sari-sari stores and dried fish stalls. The logging, mining, and agribusiness industry during the 1930s in Baguio was also big among the Cantonese Chinese Filipinos there and it was only at such time during 1930s and after WW2 when Hokkien Chinese Filipinos started to establish themselves in Baguio. Presently, they are into small-scale entrepreneurship and in education. There are also about 30 or so Filipino Cantonese associations in the Philippines, such as the Baguio Filipino Cantonese Association CAR (BFCA-CAR), which was merged from The Baguio Cantonese Association and the Brotherhood of Filipino-Cantonese Mestizos during 1999. There are also schools such as Baguio Patriotic School and Manila Patriotic School.

===Others===
There are also some ethnic Chinese from neighboring Asian countries and territories, most notably from Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan and Hong Kong who are naturalized Philippine citizens and have since formed part of the Chinese Filipino community. Many of them are also Hokkien speakers, with a sizeable number of Cantonese and Teochew speakers.

Temporary resident Chinese businessmen and envoys include people from Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities and provinces throughout China.

=== Chinese Moro mestizos ===
The Chinese Moro mestizos are of paternal Han Chinese descent who married Moro Muslim women from Tausug, Sama and Maguindanaon ethnicities and are not descendants of Hui Muslims. The Moros did not follow Sharia prohibitions on marriage of Muslim women to non-Muslims. So, Han Chinese men from the Straits Settlements and the Chinese mainland migrated to Mindanao (and the islands of Sulu) and founded families. These mestizos celebrated Chinese New Year and Chinese holidays including ones of pagan origin and practice Han cultural taboos; like the taboo against patrilineal cousin marriage. Hui in China practice marriage of patrilineal cousins of the same surname to each other, which the Han-descended Chinese Moro mestizos do not. Observant Hui Muslims also do not practice Chinese pagan holidays. The Han men continued practicing their own pagan religions and holidays when married to Moro Muslim women. As late as the 1970s, Professor Samuel Kong Tan said among the Chinese and Moros of Sulu, it was still normal for non-Muslim men to marry Muslim women.

The Han who became part of the Chinese-Moro mestizo community are mostly of Minnan background, either directly from southern Fujian like Xiamen (Amoy) or the Peranakans who are descendants of Minnan speaking Han men and Malay women, with a small minority of them being descendants of other Han like one northern Han family who married into the Tausug. Some Han of either Hakka or Cantonese background in Sabah, Borneo married Tausug women there before World War II ended.

The Chinese families among the Tausug include the Kho, Lim, Teo, Kong and multiple families with the surname Tan, including the family of Tuchay Tan and Hadji Suug Tan. These families maintain the Chinese practice of not permitting marriages in the same paternal families with the same surname, and even though the Tans are multiple families, they still adhere to the rule of avoiding marriage to each other believing they were related far in the past.

The assimilation and intermarriages between the local Muslim Moro Tausug and Sama in Sulu and the Han Chinese immigrants, in contrast to Chinese living in Filipino Catholic areas, was facilitated by the good relations throughout history between China and Sulu.

The Chinese mestizo descendants of Han Chinese men and Moro Muslim Tausug and Sama women are integrating and dissolving into the Tausug and Sama population as they lose practice of Chinese culture except celebrating some festivals and their Chinese names.

==Demographics==

* &quot;The figure above denotes first-generation Chinese mestizos – namely, those with one Chinese and one Filipino parent. This figure does not include those who have less than 50% Chinese ancestry, who are mostly classified as &quot;Filipino&quot;.&quot;

The exact number of all Filipinos with some Chinese ancestry is unknown. Various estimates have been given from the start of the Spanish Colonial Period up to the present ranging from as low as 1% to as large as 18–27%. The National Statistics Office does not conduct surveys of ethnicity.

According to a research report by historian Austin Craig who was commissioned by the United States in 1915 to ascertain the total number of the various races of the Philippines, the pure Chinese, referred to as &quot;Sangley&quot;, number around 20,000 (as of 1918), and that around one-third of the population of Luzon have partial Chinese ancestry. This comes with a footnote about the widespread concealing and de-emphasising of the exact number of Chinese in the Philippines.

Another source dating from the Spanish Colonial Period shows the growth of the Chinese and the Chinese mestizo population to nearly 10% of the Philippine population by 1894.
==Language==
The vast majority (74.5%) of Chinese Filipinos, especially those in Metro Manila and surrounding regions, speak Filipino (Tagalog) and/or Philippine English as their native language. Most Chinese Filipinos (77%) still retain the ability to understand and speak Hokkien as a second or third language.

The use of Hokkien as a first language is seemingly confined to the older generation and to Chinese Filipino families living in traditional Chinese Filipino centers, such as Binondo Chinatown district of Manila, Caloocan, Davao Chinatown, Cebu, and many other parts of the Philippines. In part due to the increased adoption of Philippine nationality during the Marcos Sr. era, most Chinese Filipinos born from the 1970s to the mid-1990s tend to use English, Filipino (Tagalog) and other Philippine regional languages, which they frequently code-switch between as Taglish or mix together with Hokkien as Hokaglish. Among the younger generation (born from the mid-1990s onward), the preferred language is often English besides also, of course, knowing Filipino (Tagalog) and, in most regions of the Philippines, other regional languages. Recent arrivals from Mainland China or Taiwan, despite coming mostly from traditionally Hokkien-speaking areas, typically use Mandarin among themselves.

Unlike other overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, which feature an assortment of dialect groups, Chinese Filipinos descend overwhelmingly from Hokkien-speaking regions in Southern Fujian. Hence, Hokkien remains the main heritage language among Chinese Filipinos. Mandarin, however, is perceived as the most prestigious Chinese language, so it is taught in Chinese Filipino schools and used in all official and formal functions within the Chinese Filipino community despite the fact that very few Chinese Filipinos are conversant in Mandarin or have it as a heritage language.

For the Chinese mestizos, Spanish used to be the most important prestige language and the preferred first language during the Spanish colonial era. Starting from the American period, the use of Spanish gradually decreased and is now completely replaced by either English or Filipino.

===Hokkien / Fukien / Fookien (Philippine Hokkien)===
Since most Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines trace their ancestry to Southern Fujian in Fujian Province of Mainland China, the Hokkien language, specifically the Philippine Hokkien dialect, is the &quot;heritage language&quot; of most Chinese Filipinos. Currently, it is typically the elderly and those of the older generations, such as the Silent Generation, the Baby boomer generation and part of Generation X, who speak Philippine Hokkien as their first or second language, especially as first- or second-generation Chinese Filipinos. The younger generations, such as part of Generation X and most Millennials and Generation Z youth, sparsely use Hokkien as a second or third language and even more seldom as a first language. This is due to Hokkien nowadays only being used and heard within family households and no longer being taught at schools. As a result, most of the youth can either only understand Hokkien by ear or do not know it at all, using instead English, Filipino (Tagalog) and in some cases one or more other Philippine languages.

The variant of Hokkien spoken in the Philippines, Philippine Hokkien, is locally called &quot;Lannang-ue&quot; (Philippine Hokkien ). Philippine Hokkien is mutually intelligible to a certain degree with other Hokkien variants in mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, etc. and is particularly close to the variant spoken in Quanzhou, especially around Jinjiang. Its unique features include its conservative nature that preserves old vocabulary and pronunciations, the presence of a few loanwords from Philippine Spanish and Filipino and frequent code-switching with Philippine English, Filipino/Tagalog and other Philippine languages (such as Visayan languages), excessive use of shortenings and colloquial words (e.g., &quot;pīⁿ-chhù&quot; [病厝]: literally, &quot;sick-house&quot;, instead of the Taiwanese Hokkien term &quot;pīⁿ-īⁿ&quot; [病院] to refer to &quot;hospital&quot; or &quot;chhia-thâu&quot; [車頭]: literally, &quot;car-head&quot;, instead of the Taiwanese Hokkien term &quot;su-ki&quot; [司機] to refer to a &quot;driver&quot;) and use of vocabulary terms from various variants of Hokkien, such as from the Quanzhou, Amoy (Xiamen) and Zhangzhou dialects of the Hokkien language.

The Chinese Sangley community in the Philippines centuries ago during Spanish colonial times spoke a mix of different Hokkien dialects (Zhangzhou/Chiangchiu, Quanzhou/Chuanchiu, Amoy/Xiamen), enough that the Hokkien recorded by the Spaniards during the early 1600s, such as in the &quot;Dictionario Hispanico Sinicum&quot; (1604), resembled the Zhangzhou dialect more, contrary to the modern 21st century Philippine Hokkien that now resembles the Quanzhou dialect more.

===Mandarin===
Mandarin is currently the subject and medium of instruction for teaching Standard Chinese (Mandarin) class subjects in Chinese Filipino schools in the Philippines. However, since the language is rarely used outside of the classroom besides jobs and interactions related to Mainland China and Taiwan, most Chinese Filipinos would be hard-pressed to converse in Mandarin.

As a result of longstanding influence from the ROC Ministry of Education of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Council of the Republic of China (Taiwan) since the early 1900s up to 2000, the Mandarin variant (known in many schools in Hokkien ) taught and spoken in many older Chinese Filipino schools in the Philippines closely mirrors that of Taiwanese Mandarin, using Traditional Chinese characters and the Zhuyin phonetic system (known in many schools in Hokkien ) being taught, though in recent decades Simplified Chinese characters and the Pinyin phonetic system were also introduced from China and Singapore. Some Chinese Filipino schools now also teach Mandarin in Simplified characters with the Pinyin system, modeled after those in China and Singapore. Some schools teach both or either of the systems.

Spanish Dominican Catholic missionaries like Francisco Varo who visited 17th century Fujian (late Ming and early Qing) learned both local Min Chinese and the official Ming dynasty Mandarin Chinese (guanhua) and they explicitly noted that Mandarin was regarded as an elegant, &quot;elevated&quot; language by the local Fujianese Chinese while their own local Min speech were regarded as &quot;coarse speech&quot;. They noted Mandarin Guanhua was solemn and used by the educated Fujianese literati and officials while it was the rural villagers and women who only spoke the local Min patois (xiangtan) since they didn&#x27;t speak Mandarin. Jesuits in Ming dynasty China like Matteo Ricci generally focused on studying the official and prestigious Mandarin while Dominicans studied vernacular Hokkien dialects in Fujian.

===Cantonese and Taishanese===
Currently, there are still a few minority Cantonese Chinese Filipino families that still privately speak Cantonese or Taishanese at home or in their circles, but many who still interact with the overall Chinese Filipino community have also learned to speak Philippine Hokkien for business purposes due to Hokkien&#x27;s status as a community lingua franca within the Chinese Filipino community. Due to the relatively small population of Chinese Filipinos who are or claim to be of Cantonese ancestry, most Filipinos of Cantonese ancestry, such as Spanish-colonial-era Chinese mestizos (&quot;Mestizos de Sangley&quot;) that originally trace back to Macau or Canton (Guangzhou), especially the younger generations thereof, do not speak Cantonese or Taishanese anymore and can only speak the local languages, such as Filipino (Tagalog), English and other Philippine languages such as Ilocano, Cebuano, etc. Some families of Cantonese ancestry within the Chinese Filipino community also speak Philippine Hokkien with their family, especially those that intermarried with Chinese Filipinos of Hokkien ancestry. There may also be some Chinese Filipino families of Hokkien ancestry that speak Cantonese due to a family history of having lived in Hong Kong, such as around the districts of North Point (), Kowloon Bay or Causeway Bay, during the Cold War period, when many families fled the communist advance to British Hong Kong and then later to countries in Southeast Asia such as the Philippines or Indonesia.

===English===

Just like most other Filipinos, the vast majority of Chinese Filipinos who grew up in the Philippines are fluent in English, especially Philippine English (which descends from American English) as taught in schools in the Philippines. They are usually natively bilingual or even multilingual since both English and Filipino are required subjects in all grades of all schools in the Philippines, as English serves as an important formal prestige language in Philippine society. Due to this, around 30% of all Chinese Filipinos, mostly those belonging to the younger generations, use English as their preferred first language. Others have it as their second language or third language, being natively bilingual or multilingual together with Filipino and sometimes one or more other Philippine languages.

===Filipino and other Philippine languages===

The majority of Chinese Filipinos who were born, were raised, or have lived long enough in the Philippines are at least natively bilingual or multilingual. Along with English, Chinese Filipinos typically speak Filipino (Tagalog) and, in non-Tagalog regions, the dominant regional Philippine language(s), such as the Visayan languages (Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Waray, etc.) spoken in the Visayas and Mindanao.

Many Chinese Filipinos, especially those living in the provinces, speak the regional language(s) of their province as their first language(s), if not English or Filipino. Just like most other Filipinos, Chinese Filipinos frequently code-switch either with Filipino or Tagalog and English, known as Taglish, or with other regional provincial languages, such as Cebuano and English, known as Bislish. This frequent code-switching has produced a trilingual mix with the above Philippine Hokkien, known as Hokaglish, which mixes Hokkien, Tagalog and English. However, in provinces where Tagalog is not a native language, the equivalent dominant regional language(s) may be mixed instead of Tagalog or along with Tagalog in a mix of four or more languages due to the normalcy of code-switching and multilingualism as part of Philippine society.

===Spanish===

During the Spanish colonial period and subsequent few decades before its replacement by English, Spanish used to be the formal prestige language of Philippine society and hence, Sangley Chinese (Spanish-era unmixed Chinese), Chinese mestizos (Spanish-era mixed Chinese Filipinos) and &quot;Tornatras&quot; mestizos (Spanish-era mixed Chinese-Spanish or Chinese-Spanish-native Filipinos) also learned to speak Spanish throughout the Spanish colonial period to the early to mid 20th century when its role was eventually eclipsed by English and later largely dissipated from mainstream Philippine society. Most of the elites of Philippine society during the Spanish colonial era and American colonial era were Spanish mestizos or Chinese mestizos, which later intermixed together to an unknown degree and now frequently treated as one group known as Filipino mestizos. Due to this history in the Philippines, many of the older generation Chinese Filipinos (mainly those born before WWII), whether pure or mixed, can also understand some Spanish, due to its importance in commerce and industry. The Chinese community of the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era used to also speak a sort of Spanish pidgin variety known as &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot;. This was especially the case with the local Sangley Chinese that intermarried during Spanish colonial times. They brought forth Spanish-speaking Chinese Mestizos of varying proficiency, from the accented pidgin Spanish of the new Chinese immigrants to the fluent Spanish of Sangley Chinese old-timers.

==Religion==

Chinese Filipinos are unique in Southeast Asia in being overwhelmingly Christian (83%). but many families, especially Chinese Filipinos in the older generations still practice traditional Chinese religions. Almost all Chinese Filipinos, including the Chinese &quot;mestizos&quot; but excluding recent migrants from either Mainland China or Taiwan, had or will have their marriages in a Christian church.

In the 18th century, many Chinese converted from traditional religions to Catholicism.
===Roman Catholicism===

The majority (70%) of Christian Chinese Filipinos are Catholic. Many Catholic Chinese Filipinos still tend to practice the traditional Chinese religions alongside Catholicism, due to the recent openness of the Church in accommodating Chinese beliefs such as ancestor veneration.

Unique to the Catholicism of Chinese Filipinos is the religious syncretism that is found in Chinese Filipino homes. Many have altars bearing Catholic images such as the &quot;Santo Niño&quot; (Child Jesus) as well as statues of the Buddha and Taoist deities. It is not unheard of to venerate the Blessed Virgin Mary, saints, or the dead using joss sticks and otherwise traditional offerings, much as one would have done for Guan Yin or Mazu.

===Protestantism===

Approximately 13% of all Christian Chinese Filipinos are Protestants.

Many Chinese Filipino schools are founded by Protestant missionaries and churches.

Chinese Filipinos comprise a large percentage of membership in some of the largest evangelical churches in the Philippines, many of which are also founded by Chinese Filipinos, such as the Christian Gospel Center, Christ&#x27;s Commission Fellowship, United Evangelical Church of the Philippines and the Youth Gospel Center.

In contrast to Roman Catholicism, Protestantism forbids traditional Chinese practices such as ancestor veneration, but allows the use of meaning or context substitution for some practices that are not directly contradicted in the Bible (e.g., celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival with moon cakes denoting the moon as God&#x27;s creation and the unity of families, rather than the traditional Chinese belief in Chang&#x27;e). Many also had ancestors already practicing Protestantism while still in China.

Unlike native and mestizo Filipino-dominated Protestant churches in the Philippines which have very close ties with North American organizations, most Protestant Chinese Filipino churches instead sought alliance and membership with the Chinese Congress on World Evangelization, an organization of Overseas Chinese Christian churches throughout Asia.

===Chinese traditional religions and practices===

A small number of Chinese Filipinos (2%) continue to practise traditional Chinese religions solely. Mahayana Buddhism, specifically, Chinese Pure Land Buddhism, Taoism and ancestral worship (including Confucianism) are the traditional Chinese beliefs that continue to have adherents among the Chinese Filipino.

Buddhist and Taoist temples can be found where the Chinese live, especially in urban areas like Manila. Veneration of the Guanyin (觀音), known locally as &quot;Kuan-im&quot; either in its pure form or seen a representation of the Virgin Mary is practised by many Chinese Filipinos. The Chinese Filipino community also established indigenous religious denominations like Bell Church (钟教), which is a syncretic religion with ecumenical and interfaith in orientation. There are several prominent Chinese temples like Seng Guan Temple (Buddhist) in Manila, Cebu Taoist Temple in Cebu City and Lon Wa Buddhist Temple in Davao City.

Around half (40%) of all Chinese Filipinos regardless of religion still claim to practise ancestral worship. The Chinese, especially the older generations, have the tendency to go to pay respects to their ancestors at least once a year, either by going to the temple, or going to the Chinese burial grounds, often burning incense and bringing offerings like fruits and accessories made from paper.

Chinese traditional religions have been practiced on the Philippines since 985 at the latest, but there is evidence of cultural and human transference from China to the Philippines since at least 5000 BC, including in matters of folk belief and mythology.

===Others===
There are very few Chinese Filipino Muslims, most of whom live in either Mindanao or the Sulu Archipelago and have intermarried or assimilated with their Moro neighbors. Many of them have attained prominent positions as political leaders. They include Datu Piang, Abdusakur Tan and Michael Mastura, among such others.

Others are also members of the Iglesia ni Cristo, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses or the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Some younger generations of Chinese Filipinos also profess to be atheists.

==Education==

There are 150 Chinese schools that exist throughout the Philippines, slightly more than half of which operate in Metro Manila. Chinese Filipino schools typically include the teaching of Standard Chinese (Mandarin), among other school class subjects, and have an international reputation for producing award-winning students in the fields of science and mathematics, most of whom reap international awards in mathematics, computer programming, and robotics Olympiads.

===History===

The first school founded specifically for the Chinese in the Philippines, the Anglo-Chinese School (now known as Tiong Se Academy) was opened in 1899 on the Qing Dynasty Chinese Embassy grounds. The first curriculum called for rote memorization of the four major Confucian texts (the Four Books and Five Classics) along with Western science and technology. This was followed suit in the establishment of other Chinese schools, such as Hua Siong College of Iloilo, established in Iloilo in 1912, the Chinese Patriotic School, established in Manila in 1912 (the first school for the Cantonese Chinese), Saint Stephen&#x27;s High School, established in Manila in 1915 (the first sectarian school for the Chinese), and the Chinese National School, established in Cebu in 1915.

Burgeoning of Chinese schools throughout the Philippines, including in Manila, occurred from the 1920s until the 1970s, with a brief interlude during World War II, when all Chinese schools were ordered closed by the Japanese and their students were forcibly integrated into Japanese-sponsored Philippine public education. After World War II, the Third Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of China (ROC) signed the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Amity, which provided for the direct control of Chinese schools throughout the archipelago by the Republic of China (Taiwan)&#x27;s Ministry of Education. In the late 20th century, despite Mandarin taking the place of Amoy Hokkien as the usual Chinese course taught in Chinese schools, some schools still tried to teach Hokkien as well, deeming it more practical in the Philippine-Chinese setting.

Such a situation continued until 1973, when amendments made during the Marcos Era to the Philippine Constitution effectively transferred all Chinese schools to the authority of the Republic of the Philippines&#x27; Department of Education (DepEd). With this, the medium of instruction for teaching Standard Chinese (Mandarin) was shifted from Amoy Hokkien Chinese to Mandarin Chinese (or in some schools to English). Teaching hours relegated to Chinese language and arts, which featured prominently in the pre-1973 Chinese schools, were reduced. Lessons in Chinese geography and history, which were previously subjects in their own right, were incorporated into the Chinese language subject(s), whereas Filipino (Tagalog) and Philippine history, civics and culture became newly required subjects.

The changes in Chinese education initiated with the 1973 Philippine Constitution led to a large shifting of mother tongues, reflecting the assimilation of the Chinese Filipinos into general Philippine society. The older generation of Chinese Filipinos, who were educated in the old curriculum, typically use Philippine Hokkien at home, while most younger-generation Chinese Filipinos are more comfortable conversing in English, Filipino (Tagalog), and/or other Philippine languages like Cebuano, including their code-switching forms like Taglish and Bislish, which are sometimes varyingly admixed with Philippine Hokkien to make Hokaglish.

===Curriculum===

Chinese Filipino schools typically feature curriculum prescribed by the Philippine Department of Education (DepEd). The limited time spent in Chinese instruction consists largely of language arts.

The three core Chinese subjects are &quot;Chinese Grammar&quot; (), &quot;Chinese Composition&quot; (), and &quot;Chinese Mathematics&quot; (). Other schools may add other subjects such as &quot;Chinese Calligraphy&quot; (). Chinese history, geography and culture are also integrated in all the three core Chinese subjects – they stood as independent subjects of their own before 1973. Many schools currently teach at least just one Chinese subject, known simply as just &quot;Chinese&quot; (). It also varies per school if either or both Traditional Chinese with Zhuyin (known in many schools in Hokkien ) and/or Simplified Chinese with Pinyin is taught. Currently, all Chinese class subjects are taught in Mandarin Chinese (known in many schools in Hokkien ) and in some schools, students are prohibited from speaking any other language, such as English, Filipino (Tagalog), other regional Philippine languages, or even Hokkien during Chinese classes, when decades before, there were no such restrictions.

===Schools and universities===

Many Chinese Filipino schools are sectarian, being founded by either Roman Catholic or Chinese Protestant Christian missions. These include Grace Christian College (Protestant-Baptist), Hope Christian High School (Protestant-Evangelical), Immaculate Conception Academy (Roman Catholic-Missionary Sisters of the Immaculate Conception), Jubilee Christian Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), LIGHT Christian Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), Makati Hope Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), MGC-New Life Christian Academy (Protestant-Evangelical), Saint Peter the Apostle School (Roman Catholic-Archdiocese of Manila), Saint Jude Catholic School (Roman Catholic-Society of the Divine Word), Saint Stephen&#x27;s High School (Protestant-Episcopalian), Ateneo de Iloilo, Ateneo de Cebu and Xavier School (Roman Catholic-Society of Jesus).

Major non-sectarian schools include Chiang Kai Shek College, Manila Patriotic School, Philippine Chen Kuang High School, Philippine Chung Hua School, Philippine Cultural College – the oldest Chinese Filipino secondary school in the Philippines, and Tiong Se Academy – the oldest Chinese Filipino school in the Philippines.

Chiang Kai Shek College is the only college in the Philippines accredited by both the Philippine Department of Education (DepEd) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) Ministry of Education.

Most Chinese Filipinos attend Chinese Filipino schools until Secondary level and then transfer to non-Chinese colleges and universities to complete their tertiary degree, due to the dearth of Chinese language tertiary institutions.

==Name format==

Many Chinese who lived during the Spanish naming edict of 1849 eventually adopted Spanish name formats, along with a Spanish given name (e.g., Florentino Cu y Chua). Some adopted their entire Chinese name romanized as a surname for the entire clan (e.g., Jose Antonio Chuidian (); Alberto Cojuangco ()). Chinese mestizos, as well as some Chinese who chose to completely assimilate into the local Filipino or Spanish culture during Spanish colonial times also adopted Spanish surnames, just as any other Filipino, either as per christening of a new Christian name under Catholic Christian baptismal under the Spanish friars or through the 1849 decree of Gov-Gen. Narciso Claveria that distributed surnames from the &quot;Catálogo alfabético de apellidos&quot;, most of which listed there were Spanish surnames.

Newer Chinese migrants who came during the American Colonial Period use a combination of an adopted Spanish (or rarely, English) name together with their Chinese name (e.g., Carlos Palanca Tan Quin Lay or Vicente Go Tam Co). This trend was to continue up to the late 1970s.

As both exposure to North American media as well as the number of Chinese Filipinos educated in English increased, the use of English names among Chinese Filipinos, both common and unusual, started to increase as well. Popular names among the second generation Chinese community included English names ending in &quot;-son&quot; or other Chinese-sounding suffixes, such as &quot;Anderson&quot;, &quot;Emerson&quot;, Jackson, Jameson, Jasson, &quot;Patrickson&quot;, &quot;Washington&quot;, among such others. For parents who are already third and fourth generation Chinese Filipinos, English names reflecting American popular trends are given, such as &quot;Ethan&quot;, &quot;Austin&quot; and &quot;Aidan&quot;.

It is thus not unusual to find a young Chinese Filipino, for example, named &quot;Chase Tan&quot;, whose father&#x27;s name is &quot;Emerson Tan&quot; and whose grandfather&#x27;s name is &quot;Elpidio Tan Keng Kui&quot;, reflecting the depth of immersion into the English language as well as into the Philippine society as a whole.

===Surnames===

Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines from 1898 onward usually have monosyllabic Chinese surnames. On the other hand, most Chinese ancestors came to the Philippines prior to 1898 usually have multisyllabic surnames such as Gokongwei, Ongpin, Pempengco, Yuchengco, Teehankee and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Chinese names which were transliterated in Spanish orthography and adopted as surnames.

Common single-syllable Chinese Filipino surnames are Tan (), Lim (), Chua (), Uy () and Ong (). Most such surnames are spelled according to their Hokkien pronunciation.

On the other hand, most Chinese Filipinos whose ancestors came to the Philippines prior to 1898 use a Hispanicized surname &quot;(see below)&quot;. Many Filipinos who have Hispanicized Chinese surnames are no longer pure Chinese, but are Chinese mestizos.

====Hispanized surnames====

Chinese Filipinos and Chinese mestizos usually have multisyllabic surnames such as Angseeco (from ang/see/co/kho) Aliangan (from liang/gan), Angkeko, Apego (from ang/ke/co/go/kho), Chuacuco, Chuatoco, Chuateco, Ciacho (from Sia), Cinco (from Go), Cojuangco, Corong, Cuyegkeng, Dioquino, Dytoc, Dy-Cok, Dysangco, Dytioco, Gueco, Gokongwei, Gundayao, Kiamco/Quiamco, Kimpo/Quimpo, King/Quing, Landicho, Lanting, Limcuando, Ongpin, Pempengco, Quebengco, Siopongco, Sycip, Tambengco, Tambunting, Tanbonliong, Tantoco, Tinsay, Tiolengco, Yuchengco, Tanciangco, Yuipco, Yupangco, Licauco, Limcaco, Ongpauco, Tancangco, Tanchanco, Teehankee, Uytengsu and Yaptinchay among such others. These were originally full Hokkien Chinese names which were transliterated in Latin letters with Spanish orthography and adopted as Hispanicized surnames.

There are also multisyllabic Chinese surnames that are Spanish transliterations of Hokkien words. Surnames like Tuazon (Eldest Grandchild, , &quot;Tuā-sun&quot;), Tiongson/Tiongzon (Eldest Grandchild, , &quot;Tióng-sun&quot;)/(Second/Middle Grandchild, , &quot;Tiōng-sun&quot;), Sioson (Youngest Grandchild, 小孫, &quot;Sió-sun&quot;), Echon/Ichon/Itchon/Etchon/Ychon (First Grandchild, 一孫, &quot;It-sun&quot;), Dizon (Second Grandchild, 二孫, &quot;Dī-sun&quot;), Samson/Sanson (Third Grandchild, 三孫, &quot;Sam-sun&quot;), Sison (Fourth Grandchild, 四孫, &quot;Sì-sun&quot;), Gozon/Goson/Gozum (Fifth Grandchild, 五孫, &quot;Gǒ͘-sun&quot;), Lacson (Sixth Grandchild, 六孫, &quot;La̍k-sun&quot;), Sitchon/Sichon (Seventh Grandchild, 七孫, &quot;Tshit-sun&quot;), Pueson (Eighth Grandchild, 八孫, &quot;Pueh-sun&quot;), Causon/Cauzon (Ninth Grandchild, 九孫, &quot;Káu-sun&quot;), are examples of transliterations of designations that use the Hokkien suffix -son/-zon/-chon (Hokkien ) used as surnames for some Chinese Filipinos who trace their ancestry from Chinese immigrants to the Philippines during the Spanish Colonial Period. The surnames 孫, , 長孫 are listed in the classic Chinese text Hundred Family Surnames, perhaps shedding light on the Hokkien suffix -son/-zon/-chon used here as a surname alongside some sort of accompanying enumeration scheme.

The Chinese who survived the massacre in Manila in the 1700s fled to other parts of the Philippines and to hide their identity, some also adopted two-syllable surnames ending in &quot;son&quot; or &quot;zon&quot; and &quot;co&quot; such as: Yanson = Yan = 燕孫, Ganzon = Gan = 颜孫(Hokkien), Guanzon = Guan/Kwan = 关孫 (Cantonese), Tiongson/Tiongzon = Tiong = 仲孫 (Hokkien), Cuayson/Cuayzon = 邱孫 (Hokkien), Yuson = Yu = 余孫, Tingson/Tingzon = Ting = 陈孫 (Hokchew), Siason = Sia = 谢孫 (Hokkien).

Many also took on Spanish or native Filipino surnames (e.g. Alonzo, Alcaraz, Bautista, De la Cruz, De la Rosa, De los Santos, Garcia, Gatchalian, Mercado, Palanca, Robredo, Sanchez, Tagle, Torres, etc.) upon naturalization. Today, it can be difficult to identify who are Chinese Filipino based on surnames alone.

A phenomenon common among Chinese migrants in the Philippines dating from the 1900s would be to purchase their surname, particularly during the American Colonial Period, when the Chinese Exclusion Act was applied to the Philippines. Such law led new Chinese migrants to purchase the Hispanic or native surnames of native and mestizo Filipinos and thus pass off as long-time Filipino residents of Chinese descent or as native or mestizo Filipinos. Many also purchased the Alien Landing Certificates of other Chinese who have gone back to China and assumed his surname and/or identity. Sometimes, younger Chinese migrants would circumvent the Act through adoption – wherein a Chinese with Philippine nationality adopts a relative or a stranger as his own children, thereby giving the adoptee automatic Filipino citizenship – and a new surname.

==Food==

Traditional &quot;Tsinoy&quot; cuisine, as Chinese Filipino home-based dishes are locally known, make use of recipes that are traditionally found in China&#x27;s Fujian Province and fuse them with locally available ingredients and recipes. These include unique foods such as &quot;hokkien chha-peng&quot; (Fujianese-style fried rice), &quot;si-nit mi-soa&quot; (birthday noodles), &quot;pansit canton&quot; (Fujianese-style e-fu noodles), &quot;hong ma&quot; or &quot;humba&quot; (braised pork belly), &quot;sibut&quot; (four-herb chicken soup), &quot;hototay&quot; (Fujianese egg drop soup), &quot;kiampeng&quot; (Fujianese beef fried rice), &quot;machang&quot; (glutinous rice with adobo) and &quot;taho&quot; (a dessert made of soft tofu, &quot;arnibal&quot; syrup and pearl sago).

However, most Chinese restaurants in the Philippines, as in other places, feature Cantonese, Shanghainese and Northern Chinese cuisines, rather than traditional Fujianese fare.

==Politics==

With the increasing number of Chinese with Philippine nationality, the number of political candidates of Chinese-Filipino descent also started to increase. The most significant change within Chinese Filipino political life would be the citizenship decree promulgated by former President Ferdinand Marcos which opened the gates for thousands of Chinese Filipinos to formally adopt Philippine citizenship.

Chinese Filipino political participation largely began with the People Power Revolution of 1986 which toppled the Marcos dictatorship and ushered in the Aquino presidency. The Chinese have been known to vote in blocs in favor of political candidates who are favorable to the Chinese community.

Important Philippine political leaders with Chinese ancestry include the current president Bongbong Marcos, and former presidents Rodrigo Duterte, Emilio Aguinaldo, Benigno Aquino III, Cory Aquino, Sergio Osmeña, Manuel Quezon and Ferdinand Marcos, former senators Nikki Coseteng, Alfredo Lim, Raul Roco, Panfilo Lacson, Vicente Yap Sotto, Vicente Sotto III and Roseller Lim, as well as several governors, congressmen and mayors throughout the Philippines. Many ambassadors and recent appointees to the presidential cabinet are also Chinese Filipinos like Arthur Yap, Jesse Robredo, Jose Yulo, Manuel Yan, Alberto Lim, Danilo Lim, Karl Chua and Bong Go.

The former Archbishop of Manila, Cardinals Jaime Sin, Rufino Santos and Luis Antonio Tagle also have Chinese ancestry.

==Society and culture==

===Society===

The Chinese Filipino are mostly business owners and their life centers mostly in the family business. These mostly small or medium enterprises play a significant role in the Philippine economy. A handful of these entrepreneurs run large companies and are respected as some of the most prominent business tycoons in the Philippines.

Chinese Filipinos attribute their success in business to frugality and hard work, Confucian values and their traditional Chinese customs and traditions. They are very business-minded and entrepreneurship is highly valued and encouraged among the young. Most Chinese Filipinos are urban dwellers. An estimated 50% of the Chinese Filipino live within Metro Manila, with the rest in the other major cities of the Philippines. In contrast with the Chinese mestizos, few Chinese are plantation owners. This is partly due to the fact that until recently when the Chinese Filipino became Filipino citizens, the law prohibited the non-citizens, which most Chinese were, from owning land.

===Culture===

As with other Southeast Asian nations, the Chinese community in the Philippines has become a repository of traditional Chinese culture common to unassimilated ethnic minorities throughout the world. Whereas in mainland China many cultural traditions and customs were suppressed or destroyed during the Cultural Revolution or simply regarded as old-fashioned nowadays, these traditions have remained largely preserved in the Philippines.

Many new cultural twists have evolved within the Chinese community in the Philippines, distinguishing it from other overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia. These cultural variations are highly evident during festivals such as Chinese New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. The Chinese Filipino have developed unique customs pertaining to weddings, birthdays and funerary rituals.

====Weddings====
Wedding traditions of Chinese Filipinos, regardless of religious persuasion, usually involve identification of the dates of supplication or &quot;pamamanhikan&quot; (&quot;kiu-hun&quot;), engagement (&quot;ting-hun&quot;) and wedding (&quot;kan-chhiu&quot;) adopted from Filipino customs. In addition, &quot;feng shui&quot; based on the birthdates of the couple, as well as of their parents and grandparents may also be considered. Certain customs found among Chinese Filipinos include during supplication (&quot;kiu-hun&quot;) also include a solemn tea ceremony within the house of the bridegroom ensues where the couple will be served tea, egg noodles (&quot;misua&quot;) and given red packets or envelopes containing money, commonly referred to as an &quot;ang-pao&quot;.

During the supplication ceremony, pregnant women and recently engaged couples are forbidden from attending the ceremony. Engagement (&quot;ting-hun&quot;) quickly follows, where the bride enters the ceremonial room walking backward and turned three times before being allowed to see the groom. A welcome drink consisting of red-colored juice is given to the couple, quickly followed by the exchange of gifts for both families and the wedding tea ceremony, where the bride serves the groom&#x27;s family and vice versa. The engagement reception consists of sweet tea soup and &quot;misua&quot;, both of which symbolizes long-lasting relationship.

Before the wedding, the groom is expected to provide the matrimonial bed in the future couple&#x27;s new home. A baby born under the Chinese sign of the Dragon may be placed in the bed to ensure fertility. He is also tasked to deliver the wedding gown to his bride on the day prior to the wedding to the sister of the bride, as it is considered ill fortune for the groom to see the bride on that day. For the bride, she prepares an initial batch of personal belongings (&quot;ke-chheng&quot;) to the new home, all wrapped and labeled with the Chinese characters for &quot;sang-hi&quot;. On the wedding date, the bride wears a red robe emblazoned with the emblem of a dragon prior to wearing the bridal gown, to which a pair of &quot;sang-hi&quot; (English: marital happiness) coin is sewn. Before leaving her home, the bride then throws a fan bearing the Chinese characters for &quot;sang-hi&quot; toward her mother to preserve harmony within the bride&#x27;s family upon her departure. Most of the wedding ceremony then follows Catholic or Protestant traditions.

Post-wedding rituals include the two single brothers or relatives of the bride giving the couple a &quot;wa-hoe&quot; set, which is a bouquet of flowers with umbrella and sewing kit, for which the bride gives an &quot;ang-pao&quot; in return. After three days, the couple then visits the bride&#x27;s family, upon which a pair of sugar cane branch is given, which is a symbol of good luck and vitality among Hokkien people.

====Births and birthdays====
Birthday traditions of Chinese Filipinos involve large banquet receptions, always featuring noodles and round-shaped desserts. All the relatives of the birthday celebrant are expected to wear red clothing which symbolize respect for the celebrant. Wearing clothes with a darker hue is forbidden and considered bad luck. During the reception, relatives offer &quot;ang paos&quot; (red packets containing money) to the birthday celebrant, especially if he is still unmarried. For older celebrants, boxes of egg noodles (&quot;misua&quot;) and eggs on which red paper is placed are given.

Births of babies are not celebrated and they are usually given pet names, which he keeps until he reaches first year of age. The Philippine custom of circumcision is widely practiced within the Chinese Filipino community regardless of religion, albeit at a lesser rate as compared to native Filipinos. First birthdays are celebrated with much pomp and pageantry, and grand receptions are hosted by the child&#x27;s paternal grandparents.

====Funerals and burials====
Funerary traditions of Chinese Filipinos mirror those found in Southern Fujian. A unique tradition of many Chinese Filipino families is the hiring of professional mourners which is alleged to hasten the ascent of a dead relative&#x27;s soul into Heaven. This belief particularly mirrors the merger of traditional Chinese beliefs with the Catholic religion.

===Subcultures===
Most of the Chinese mestizos, especially the landed gentry trace their ancestry to the Spanish era. They are the &quot;First Chinese&quot; or Sangley whose descendants nowadays are mostly integrated into Philippine society. Most are from Zhangzhou, Fujian province in China, with a minority coming from Guangdong. They have embraced a Hispanized Filipino culture since the 17th century. After the end of Spanish rule, their descendants, the Chinese mestizos, managed to invent a cosmopolitan &quot;mestizo&quot; culture coupled with an extravagant Mestizo de Sangley lifestyle, intermarrying either with native Filipinos or with Spanish mestizos.

The largest group of Chinese in the Philippines are the &quot;Second Chinese&quot;, who are descendants of migrants in the first half of the 20th century, between the anti-Qing 1911 Revolution in China and the Chinese Civil War. This group accounts for most of the &quot;full-blooded&quot; Chinese. They are almost entirely from Fujian Province.

The &quot;Third Chinese&quot; are the second largest group of Chinese, the recent immigrants from mainland China, after the Chinese economic reform of the 1980s. Generally, the &quot;Third Chinese&quot; are the most entrepreneurial and have not totally lost their Chinese identity in its purest form and seen by some &quot;Second Chinese&quot; as a business threat. Meanwhile, continuing immigration from mainland China further enlarge this group

===Civic organizations===
Aside from their family businesses, Chinese Filipinos are active in Chinese-oriented civic organizations related to education, health care, public safety, social welfare and public charity. As most Chinese Filipinos are reluctant to participate in politics and government, they have instead turned to civic organizations as their primary means of contributing to the general welfare of the Chinese community. Beyond the traditional family and clan associations, Chinese Filipinos tend to be active members of numerous alumni associations holding annual reunions for the benefit of their Chinese-Filipino secondary schools.

Outside of secondary schools catering to Chinese Filipinos, some Chinese Filipinos businessmen have established charitable foundations that aim to help others and at the same time minimize tax liabilities. Notable ones include the Gokongwei Brothers Foundation, Metrobank Foundation, Tan Yan Kee Foundation, Angelo King Foundation, Jollibee Foundation, Alfonso Yuchengco Foundation, Cityland Foundation, etc. Some Chinese-Filipino benefactors have also contributed to the creation of several centers of scholarship in prestigious Philippine Universities, including the John Gokongwei School of Management at Ateneo de Manila, the Yuchengco Center at De La Salle University, and the Ricardo Leong Center of Chinese Studies at Ateneo de Manila. Coincidentally, both Ateneo and La Salle enroll a large number of Chinese-Filipino students. In health care, Chinese Filipinos were instrumental in establishing and building medical centers that cater for the Chinese community such as the Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center, the Metropolitan Medical Center, Chong Hua Hospital and the St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center, Inc., one of Asia&#x27;s leading health care institutions. In public safety, Teresita Ang See&#x27;s Kaisa, a Chinese-Filipino civil rights group, organized the Citizens Action Against Crime and the Movement for the Restoration of Peace and Order at the height of a wave of anti-Chinese kidnapping incidents in the early 1990s. In addition to fighting crime against Chinese, Chinese Filipinos have organized volunteer fire brigades all over the country, reportedly the best in the nation. that cater to the Chinese community. In the arts and culture, the Bahay Tsinoy and the Yuchengco Museum were established by Chinese Filipinos to showcase the arts, culture and history of the Chinese.

===Ethnic Chinese Filipinos&#x27; perceptions of non-Chinese Filipinos===

Non-Chinese Filipinos were initially referred to as &quot;huan-á&quot; () by ethnic Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines. It is also used in other Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia by Hokkien-speaking ethnic Chinese to refer to peoples of Malay ancestry. In Taiwan, it was also used but it has become a taboo term with negative stigma since it was used to refer to indigenous Taiwanese aboriginals and the Japanese during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan. The term itself in mainland China originally just meant &quot;foreigner&quot; but at times may also have been considered derogatory since it could negatively connote to &quot;barbarian/outsider&quot; by some who had negative views on certain neighboring non-Chinese peoples that certain groups historically lived with since for centuries this was the term predominantly used to refer to non-Chinese people, but today, it does not necessarily carry its original connotations, depending on the speaker&#x27;s perceptions and culture of how they grew up to learn to perceive the term, since in the Philippines, its present usage now mostly just plainly refers to any non-Chinese Filipinos, especially native Filipinos. When speaking Hokkien, most older Chinese Filipinos still use the term, while younger Chinese Filipinos may sometimes instead use the term &quot;Hui-li̍p-pin lâng&quot; (), which directly means, &quot;Philippine person&quot; or simply &quot;Filipino&quot;. This itself brings complications though as Chinese Filipinos themselves are Filipinos too, born and raised in the Philippines often with families of multiple generations carrying Filipino citizenship.

Some Chinese Filipinos perceive the government and authorities to be unsympathetic to the plight of the ethnic Chinese, especially in terms of frequent kidnapping for ransom during the late 1990s. Currently, most of the third or fourth generation Chinese Filipinos generally view the non-Chinese Filipino people and government positively, and have largely forgotten about the historical oppression of the ethnic Chinese. They are also most likely to consider themselves as just being &quot;Filipino&quot; and focus on the Philippines, rather than on just being &quot;Chinese&quot; and being associated with China (PRC) or Taiwan (ROC).

Some Chinese Filipinos believe racism still exists toward their community among a minority of non-Chinese Filipinos, who the Chinese Filipinos refer to as &quot;pâi-huâ&quot; () in Philippine Hokkien. Organizations belonging to this category include the Laspip Movement, headed by Adolfo Abadeza, as well as the Kadugong Liping Pilipino, founded by Armando &quot;Jun&quot; Ducat Jr. that stirred tensions around the late 1990s. Also due in part to racial or chauvinistic views from Mainland Chinese towards native Filipinos or Filipinos in general in the 1980s after Filipinos became in demand in the international work force, some racial tendencies of mainland Chinese brought about by Han chauvinism against native Filipinos have intensified in the 21st century, where many Mainland Chinese from mainland China have branded the Philippines as a &quot;gullible nation of maids and banana sellers&quot;, amidst disputes in the South China Sea. Due to such racist remarks against native Filipinos, racism against mainland Chinese in mainland China and by extension, ethnic-Chinese in general such as Chinese Filipinos, later developed among certain native or mestizo Filipino communities as a form of backlash. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some Chinese Filipinos have also voiced concerns about Sinophobic sentiments that some non-Chinese Filipinos may carry against any ethnic Chinese, especially those from mainland China due to being the site of the first coronavirus outbreak, that may sometimes extend and generalize on Chinese Filipinos. Chinese Filipino organizations have discouraged the mainstream Filipino public from being discriminatory, particularly against Chinese nationals amid the global spread of COVID-19.

==Intermarriage==
Chinese mestizos are persons of mixed Chinese and either Spanish or indigenous Filipino ancestry. Mestizos are thought to make up as much as 25% of the country&#x27;s total population. A number of Chinese mestizos have surnames that reflect their heritage, mostly two or three syllables that have Chinese roots (e.g., the full name of a Chinese ancestor) with a Hispanized phonetic spelling.

During the Spanish colonial period, the Spanish authorities encouraged the Chinese male immigrants to convert to Catholicism. Those who converted got baptized and their names Hispanized, and were allowed to intermarry with indigenous Filipino women. The couple and their mestizo offspring became colonial subjects of the Spanish crown, and as such were granted several privileges and afforded numerous opportunities that were denied to the unconverted and non-citizen Chinese. Starting out as traders, many Chinese mestizo businesspeople branched out into land leasing, money-lending, and later, landholding.

Chinese mestizo men and women were encouraged to marry Spanish and indigenous women and men, by means of dowries, as part of a colonial policy to mix the different ethno-racial groups of the Philippines so as it would be impossible to expel the Spanish.

Today, &quot;blood purity&quot; is still of prime concern in most traditional Chinese Filipino families, especially pure-blooded Han ones. Many Chinese Filipinos who maintain traditional perspectives on marriage continue to uphold the belief that a Chinese Filipino can only be married to another fellow Chinese Filipino since marriages to a non-Han Chinese Filipino or any non-Han Chinese outsider was considered taboo and undesirable. The prospects and implications of the sustained trend of ongoing intermarriage between Chinese to native, mestizo Filipinos, and other outsiders, still continues to be shrouded in ambiguity, raising controversy, casting doubt, and posing uncertainty for all parties involved, even to this day. As the Chinese Filipino family structure is traditionally patriarchal hence, it is the male that carries the last name of the family which also entails the pedigree and legacy of the family name itself. Marriages between Chinese Filipino men and native Filipinas or mestizas, or any outsider, was deemed more socially permissible than the other way around. In the case of the Chinese Filipina female marrying a native or mestizo Filipino or any outsider, it may incur several unwanted racial issues and tensions, especially on the side of the Chinese family.

In some instances, a member of a traditional Chinese Filipino family may be denied of his or her inheritance and likely to be disowned by his or her family for marrying an outsider without their consent. However, there are narrow exceptions in which intermarriage to a non-Chinese Filipino or any outsider would considered socially permissible provided that their family&#x27;s socioeconomic background is well-off or influential.

On the other hand, modern Chinese Filipino families who exhibit more liberal cosmopolitan views and beliefs are generally more receptive to interracial marriage by allowing their children to marry native or mestizo Filipino or any non-Han Chinese outsider. Even with these changes in attitude and shifting perspectives towards miscegenation, many contemporary Chinese Filipino families would still by and large prefer that the Filipino or any non-Han Chinese outsider would have some or little Han Chinese ancestry, such as the descendants of Chinese mestizos dating back to the Spanish colonial period.

==Trade and industry==


Like much of Southeast Asia, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry dominate the Filipino economy and commerce at every level of society. Chinese Filipinos collectively wield and uniformly demonstrate a disproportionatly high level of economic achievement and clout relative to their small population size over their indigenous Filipino majority counterparts while also playing a critical role in maintaining the country&#x27;s economic vitality and prosperity. With their powerful economic prominence, the Chinese virtually make up the country&#x27;s entire wealthy elite. Chinese Filipinos, in the aggregate, represent a disproportionate wealthy, market-dominant minority not only form a distinct ethnic community, they also form, by and large, an economic class: the commercial middle and upper class in contrast to their poorer indigenous Filipino majority working and underclass counterparts around them. Entire posh Chinese enclaves have sprung up in major Filipino cities across the country, literally walled off from the poorer indigenous Filipino masses guarded by heavily armed, private security forces. Though the contemporary Chinese Filipino community albeit remains stubbornly insular, given their propensity to voluntarily segregate themselves from the indigenous Filipino populace through typically associating themselves with the Chinese community, their collective impacting presence nonetheless still remains powerfully felt throughout the country at large. In particular, given their dominant middleman minority status and ubiquitous economic influence and prosperity owing to their shrewd business acumen and astute investment savvy have prompted the community&#x27;s acculturation into mainstream Filipino society and their maintenance of their exclusively unabashed distinctive cultural sense of ethnic identity, clannishness, community, kinship, nationalism, and socioethnic cohesion through clan associations.

The Chinese have had a significant presence in Filipino business and industry, having been at the forefront of controlling the economy of the Philippines for many centuries long before the Spanish and American colonial eras. Long before the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, Chinese merchants carried on trading activities with native communities along the coast of modern mainland China. By the time the Spanish arrived, the Chinese controlled all the commercial trading activities across the Philippines, serving as retailers, artisans, and food providers for various Spanish settlements. During the American colonial epoch, Chinese merchants controlled a significant percentage of the retail trade and internal commerce of the country. They predominated the retail trade and owned three-quarters of the 2500 rice mills interspersed along with the Filipino islands. Total resources of banking capital held by the Chinese was US$27 million in 1937 to a high of US$100 million in the estimated aggregate, making them second to the Americans in terms of total foreign capital investment held. Under Spanish rule, the Chinese were willing to engage in trade and venture into other business activities where Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry were responsible for introducing sugar refining devices, new construction techniques, movable type printing, and bronze making into the Filipino economic landscape while also providing fishing, gardening, artisan, and other such trading services. Many poverty-stricken Filipinos of Chinese ancestry were drawn towards business ownership and investing as they were prohibited from owning land and saw the only path out of abject poverty was by going into commercial business, entrepreneurship, and investing as a sole recourse to alleviate themselves from extreme economic destitution and ameliorate the parlous state of their personal financial situations. Numerous budding Chinese-born and Filipino-bred entrepreneurs and investors, driven by their shrewd commercial instincts, have leveraged their business skills and entrepreneurial spirit to change the trajectory of the parlous state of their financial destinies in unshackling themselves from the debilitating stranglehold of poverty towards a pathway of financial prosperity and economic enlightenment. By assuming responsibility for their personal financial circumstances empowered and precipitated countless budding Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry to become self-employed as dealers, distributors, hawkers, marketers, peddlers, producers, retailers, sellers, and vendors of variegated goods and services catered to the Spanish and American colonizers as well as the masses of indigenous Filipino consumers. Mainly attracted and lured by the promise of bountiful economic opportunities brought upon by the auspices of American colonial influence during the first four decades of the 20th century actuated the Chinese to vigorously assert and ultimately secure their domains of economic power fostered amongst their entrepreneurial activities and investment pursuits. The implementation of a free trade policy between the Philippines and the United States allowed the Chinese to capitalize on the growth of a burgeoning Filipino consumer market. As a result, Filipino entrepreneurs and investors of Chinese ancestry were able to capture a significant market share across the country by expanding their commercial business activities in which they were the key players who ventured into then newly emerging industries such as industrial manufacturing and financial services. The American and Spanish colonizers who saw the indispensable benefit of the enterprising Chinese, harnessed their commercial expertise, contacts, capital, and presence to serve and protect their colonial economic interests. Chinese-owned sari-sari stores that cropped up all over the Philippines were utilized to distribute and supply American and cheap Chinese-made Filipino goods and raw materials with the finished products purposed for the eventual export to the American and other foreign markets overseas. The conspicuous presence of the Chinese that permeated throughout the textual fabric of daily Filipino economic life incurred the volatile emotions and hostility of the indigenous Filipino masses manifested in the form of animosity, bitterness, envy, grievance, insecurity, and resentment.

Up until the 1970s, many of the Philippines&#x27;s biggest corporations and commercial economic activities had long been under the control of the Americans and Spaniards. Since the 1970s, a significant shift has occurred in the commercial economic sector of the Philippines, whereby numerous Filipino enterprises previously owned by Americans and Spaniards came under the control of the Chinese, who have collectively emerged and established themselves as the country&#x27;s most dominant economic force. Although the modern Chinese community in the Philippines amounts to 1 percent of the country&#x27;s entire population, they are estimated to effectively control 60 to 70 percent of the modern Filipino economy. The enterprising Chinese minority, comprising 1 percent of the total population of the Philippines, control the country&#x27;s largest and most lucrative department stores, supermarkets, hotels, shopping malls, airlines, and fast-food restaurants in addition to all of its major financial services providers, banks and stock brokerage houses, as well as dominating the nation&#x27;s wholesale distribution networks, shipping lines, banks, construction, textiles, real estate, personal computer, semiconductors, pharmaceutical, mass media, and industrial manufacturing industries. Filipinos of Chinese ancestry also control 40 percent of the Philippine&#x27;s national corporate equity. Filipinos of Chinese ancestry are also involved in the processing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. More than 1000 companies are involved in this industry, with most being small and medium-sized businesses amounting to an aggregate capitalization of ₱1.2 billion. Filipinos of Chinese ancestry are also prominent players in the Filipino mass media sector, as the Chinese control six out of the ten English-language newspapers in Manila, including the one with the largest daily circulation. Many retail stores and restaurants presided by Filipino owners with Chinese ancestry are regularly featured in Manila newspapers which often attracted great public interest as such examples of high-profile business ownership were used to illustrate the Chinese community&#x27;s strong economic influence that permeated throughout the country. The Chinese also dominate the Filipino telecommunications industry, where one of the current significant players in the Filipino telecom sector was the business taipan John Gokongwei, whose conglomerate JG Summit Holdings controlled 28 wholly-owned subsidiaries with interests ranging from food and agro-industrial products, hotels, insurance agencies, financial services providers, electronic components, textiles and garment manufacturing, real estate, petrochemicals, power generation, printing, newspaper publishing, packaging materials, detergents, and cement mixing. Gokongwei&#x27;s family firm is one of the six largest and most well-known Filipino conglomerates that has been under the hands of an owner of Chinese lineage. Gokongwei began his business career by starting out in food processing during the 1950s, venturing into textile manufacturing in the early 1970s, and then cornered the Filipino real estate development and hotel management industries by the end of the decade. In 1976, Gokongwei established Manila Midtown Hotels and has since then assumed the controlling interest of two other hotel chains, Cebu Midtown and Manila Galleria Suites respectively. In addition, Gokongwei has also made forays into the Filipino financial services sector as he expanded his business interests by investing in two Filipino banks, PCI Bank and Far East Bank, in addition to negotiating the acquisition of one of the Philippines&#x27;s oldest newspapers, &quot;The Manila Times&quot;. Gokongwei&#x27;s eldest daughter became publisher of the newspaper in December 1988 at the age of 28, at which during the same time her father acquired the paper from the Roceses, a Spanish Mestizo family. Of the 66 percent remaining part of the economy in the Philippines held by either Chinese or indigenous Filipinos, the Chinese control 35 percent of all total sales. Filipinos of Chinese ancestry control an estimated 50 to 60 percent of non-land share capital in the Philippines, and as much as 35 percent of total sales are attributed to the largest public and private firms owned by the Chinese. Many prominent Filipino companies that are Chinese-owned focus on diverse industry sectors such as semiconductors, chemicals, real estate, engineering, construction, fibre-optics, textiles, financial services, consumer electronics, food, and personal computers. A third of the top 500 companies publicly listed on the Philippines Stock Exchange are owned by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry. Of the top 1000 firms, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry control 36 percent of them and among the top 100 companies, 43 percent. Between 1978 and 1988, 146 of the country&#x27;s 494 top companies were under Chinese ownership. Filipinos of Chinese ancestry are also estimated to control over one-third of the Philippines&#x27;s 1000 largest corporations with the Chinese controlling 47 of the 68 locally owned companies publicly listed on the Manila Stock Exchange. In 1990, the Chinese controlled 25 percent of the top 100 businesses in the Philippines and by 2014, the share of top 100 firms owned by them grew to 41 percent. Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry are also responsible for generating 55 percent of overall Filipino private commercial business activity across the country. In addition, Chinese-owned Filipino companies account for 66 percent of the sixty largest commercial entities. In 2008, among the top ten wealthiest Filipinos, 6 to 7 were of Chinese ancestry with Henry Sy Sr. having topped the list with an estimated net worth US$14.4 billion. In 2015, the top 4 wealthiest people in the Philippines (with 9 being pure-blooded Han Chinese in addition to 10 out of the top 15) were of Chinese ancestry. In 2019, 15 of the 17 Filipino billionaires were of Chinese ancestry.

Filipinos of Chinese ancestry exert a considerable influential foothold across the Filipino industrial manufacturing sector. With respect to delineating the parameters by industry distribution, Chinese-owned manufacturing establishments account for a third of the entirety of the Filipino industrial manufacturing sector. The majority of Filipino industrial manufacturing establishments that produce the processing of coconut products, flour, food products, textiles, plastic products, footwear, glass, as well as heavy industry products such as metals, steel, industrial chemicals, paper products, paints, leatherwork, garments, sugar refining, timber processing, construction materials, food and beverages, rubber, plastics, semiconductors, and personal computers are controlled by Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry. In the secondary industry, 75 percent of the country&#x27;s 2500 rice mills were Chinese-owned. Chinese Filipino entrepreneurs were also dominant in wood processing, and accounted for over 10 percent of the capital invested in the lumber industry and controlled 85 percent of it as well as accounting for 40 percent of the industry&#x27;s annual output propagated through their extensive control of nearly all the sawmills throughout the country. Emerging import-substituting light industries induced the active participation and ownership of Chinese entrepreneurs being involved in various several salt works in addition to a large number of small and medium-sized producers engaged in food processing as well as the production of leather and tobacco goods. The Chinese also hold enormous sway over the Filipino food processing industry with approximately 200 outlets being involved in this sector alone predominating the eventual export of their finished products to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. More than 200 Chinese-owned companies are also involved in the production of paper, paper products, fertilizers, cosmetics, rubber products, and plastics. By the early 1960s, the Chinese presence in the manufacturing sector became even more significant. Of the industrial manufacturing establishments that employed 10 or more workers, 35 percent were Chinese-owned and among 284 enterprises employing more than 100 workers, 37 percent were likewise Chinese-owned. Of the 163 domestic industrial manufacturing companies operating throughout the Philippines, 80 were Chinese-owned and included the manufacturing of coconut oil, food products, tobacco, textiles, plastic products, footwear, glass, and certain types of metals such as tubes and pipes, wire rods, nails, bolts, and containers. In 1965, the Chinese controlled 32 percent of the country&#x27;s top industrial manufacturing outlets. Of the 259 industrial manufacturing establishments belonging to the top 1000 that operated throughout the entire country, the Chinese owned 33.6 percent of the top manufacturing companies as well as 43.2 percent of the top commercial manufacturing outlets in 1980. By 1986, the Chinese controlled 45 percent of the country&#x27;s top 120 domestic manufacturing companies. These manufacturing establishments are mainly involved in the production of tobacco and cigarettes, soap and cosmetics, textiles and rubber footwear.

Today, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry control all of the Philippines&#x27;s largest and most lucrative department stores, supermarkets, and fast-food restaurants. In the fast-food industry, Filipino restaurateurs of Chinese ancestry have been behind the Philippines&#x27;s biggest fast-food restaurant franchises. A wave of big-name of domestically homegrown restaurant chains such as Chowking, Greenwich Pizza, Mang Inasal, Red Ribbon in addition to the mainland Chinese-based establishment Yonghe Dawang (永和大王) have made headway into the Filipino restaurant industry with their various constiuent outlets being cropped up across various cities around the country. There are roughly 3000 fast-food outlets and restaurants controlled by Filipino restaurateurs of Chinese ancestry around the country, especially eating establishments specializing in Chinese cuisine have attracted an influx of foreign capital investments from Hong Kong and Taiwan. The banker and business taipan George Ty was responsible for securing and franchising the rights of the famous publicly traded American hamburger franchise McDonald&#x27;s across the Philippines and the Jollibee fast-food joint, whose founder Tony Tan Caktiong is a Filipino restaurateur of Chinese ancestry. Jollibee&#x27;s popularity around the country has since then led to the expansion of its corporate presence throughout the world by establishing subsidiaries in the Middle East, Hong Kong, Guam, and other Southeast Asian countries such as Brunei and Indonesia. The chain has since evolved into the Jollibee Foods Corporation with the company having expanded gradually its corporate operating presence throughout mainland China as evidenced by its foreign acquisition of the Chinese fast food chain Dim Sum in 2008. In the beverage sector, San Miguel Corporation is among the Philippines&#x27;s most prominent beverage providers. The company was founded in 1851 by Enrique María Barretto de Ycaza y Esteban and is responsible for supplying the country&#x27;s entire beverage needs. Two Chinese-owned Filipino beverage companies, namely Lucio Tan&#x27;s Asia Brewery and John Gokongwei&#x27;s Universal Robina, along with several lesser-known beverage companies are also now competing with each other to capture the largest share in the Filipino beverage market.

In 1940, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry were estimated to control 70 percent of the country&#x27;s entire retail trade and 75 percent of the nation&#x27;s rice mills. By 1948, the economic standing of the Chinese community began to elevate even further allowing them to wield considerable influence by expanding their commercial business presence across the Filipino retail industry. As the Chinese community exercised a considerable percentage of the total commercial investment, including the command of 55 percent of the Filipino retail trade and 85 percent of the country&#x27;s lumber industry at this time. After the end of the Second Sino-Japanese war, Chinese Filipinos controlled 85 percent of the nation&#x27;s retail trade. The Chinese also presided over 40 percent of the retailing imports coupled with substantial controlling interests in banking, oil refining, sugar milling, cement, tobacco, flour milling, glass, dairy farming, automobile manufacturing, and consumer electronics. Although the Filipino Hacienderos owned an extensive array of businesses, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry greatly augmented their economic power coinciding with the pro-market reforms of the late 1980s and 1990s initiated by the Marcos administration. As a result, the Chinese gradually increased their commanding role in the domestic Filipino commercial retail sector over time by acting as an intermediary in connecting Chinese-owned Filipino retailers to the masses of indigenous Filipino consumers through the exchange of various goods and services. The Chinese Filipino business community accomplished such commercial feats as a tight-knit group in an enclosed system via vertical integration by setting up their own supply chains, distribution networks, locating key competitors, making use of geographical coverage, attributes and characteristics, business strategies, staff recruitment, store proliferation, and establishing their own independent trade organizations. Chinese-owned Filipino retail outlets also exercised a vast disproportionate share of several local goods such as rice, lumber products, and alcoholic drinks. Some Chinese Filipino merchant traders even branched into retailing these products in addition to rice milling, logging, saw-milling, distillery, tobacco, coconut oil processing, footwear making, and agricultural processing. Over time, the domestic Filipino economy began to broaden by the multitudinous expansion of commercial business activities long held by the Chinese which also ushered in new forms of entrepreneurship with the Chinese having assiduously devoted and directed their corporate efforts, energies, and capital into cultivating new industries and growth areas over other well-established and matured sectors.

Since the 1950s, Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have controlled the entirety of the Filipino retail industry. Every small, medium, and large enterprise in the Filipino retail sector is now completely under Chinese hands as they have been at the forefront at pioneering the modern and contemporary development of the Philippines&#x27;s retail sector. From the 1970s onward, Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have re-established themselves as the dominant players in the Filipino retail industry with the community having achieved a collective corporate feat of presiding an estimated 8500 Chinese-owned retail and wholesale outlets that predominate across various metropolitan areas the country. On a microscopic scale, the Hokkien community have a proclivity to run capital intensive businesses such as banks, commercial shipping lines, rice mills, dry goods, and general stores while the Cantonese gravitated towards hotels, restaurants, and laundromats. Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry control 35 percent to upwards to two-thirds of the domestic sales among the country&#x27;s 67 largest commercial retail outlets. By the 1980s, Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry began to expand their business activities by venturing into large-scale retailing.

Chinese-owned Filipino retail outlet&#x27;s today are among the single largest owners of department store chains in the Philippines with one prominent example being Rustan&#x27;s, which is one of the country&#x27;s most prestigious department store brands. Other prime retailers such as Shoe Mart owned by Henry Sy and John Gokongwei&#x27;s Robinson&#x27;s percolated rapidly throughout major cities around the country, with the products that they retailed having made their way into the shopping malls situated across various parts of the Manila Metropolitan area. Another prominent business figure in Philippines&#x27;s retail industry is the Fujian-born and Filipino-bred taipan, Lucio Tan. Tan started off his business career in the cigarette distribution industry and then catapulted himself into entrepreneurial prominence within the major leagues of elite Filipino business circles after masterminding the corporate takeover of General Bank and Trust Company in 1977 and later renamed it as the Allied Bank. Tan, whose flagship cigarette manufacturing company Fortune Tobacco (now a Philippine affiliate of Philip Morris International) controls the largest market share of cigarette distribution in the country and has since then emerged as of one richest men in the Philippines. Aside from taking over the Philippines&#x27;s tobacco distribution networks, Tan has since parlayed his business interests into a corporate conglomerate behemoth of his own LT Group Inc.. His corporate empire presides over a portfolio of diversified business interests including chemicals, sports, education, brewing, financial services, real estate, hotels (Century Park Hotel), in addition to his company having purchased a majority controlling interest in PAL, one of the Philippines&#x27;s largest airlines. In terms of industry distribution, small and medium size Chinese-owned retailers account for half of the Philippines retail trade, with 49.45 percent of the retail sector alone being controlled by Henry Sy&#x27;s Shoemart, and the remaining share of the retail trade being dominated by a few larger Chinese-owned Filipino umbrella retail outlets that include thousands of smaller retail subsidiaries. Sy built his business empire from scratch out of his Shoe Mart department store chain, and has since made forays into banking and real estate development after purchasing a controlling interest of Banco de Oro, a private commercial bank as well as acquiring a substantial block of China Banking Corporation, another privately Chinese-owned Filipino commercial bank and wealth management house whose services are specifically catered and tailored to the banking and financing needs of up-and-coming Chinese Filipino entrepreneurs.

From small trade cooperatives clustered by hometown pawnbrokers, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry would go on to establish and incorporate the largest financial services institutions in the country. Filipinos of Chinese ancestry have been the chief pioneering influence in the Filipino financial sector as they dominated the country&#x27;s financial services domain and have had a presence in the country&#x27;s banking industry since the early part of the 20th century. The two earliest Chinese-founded Filipino banks were China Bank and the Mercantile Bank of China, established in 1920 and 1924 respectively. Dee C. Chuan, one of the most high-profile Filipino businessmen of Chinese ancestry at the time, played a key role in initiating the establishment of Chinabank, as he remained adamant in establishing a financial services institution that was specifically tailored to serve the needs of the Chinese Filipino business community. Following the country&#x27;s rapid parallel economic shift at the time towards the burgeoning industrial manufacturing sector prompted the Chinese business community to concurrently venture into the nascent banking and financial services sector. In 1956, there were four Chinese-owned Filipino banks, nine by 1971, sixteen in 1974, with the Chinese holding majority stakes in 10 of the 26 private commercial Filipino banks by the early 1990s. Today, the overwhelming majority of the Philippines&#x27;s principal banks have come under Chinese ownership with Filipinos of Chinese ancestry owning six of the top ten banks in the country. Of these six banks, the Chinese collectively control 63 percent of the aggregate assets among the top ten banks in the country. Chinese-controlled Filipino banks include the China Banking Corporation, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Philippine Savings Bank, the Philippine National Bank (owned by LT Group, Inc.), and most notably Metrobank Group that was owned by banker and businessman George Ty, which has been the country&#x27;s second-largest and most aggressive financial services conglomerate. Lesser-known private commercial banks established in the 1950s and 1960s are also owned and controlled by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry. The lone exception of a non-Chinese and non-foreign owned Filipino bank was the Spanish Filipino Lopez-owned Philippine Commercial International Bank, which has since been taken over by Henry Sy&#x27;s holding and investment company SM Investments Corporation, and later reemerged itself as a subsidiary of Banco de Oro in 2007. Banco De Oro, which saw its beginnings as a mere savings bank in 1980, catapulted itself into the ranks of prominence in the Filipino financial services sector when it subsumed Equitable-PCI Bank in July 2005 under the aegis of Sy. With Sy having assumed majority ownership of Banco de Oro, a commercial bank as well as acquiring a 14 percent stake in the China Banking Corporation, he also took a controlling interest in the Philippine National Bank, and 7 percent of the Far East Bank. By 1970, among the Philippines&#x27;s five largest banks holding almost 50 percent of all assets in the industry, namely China Banking Corporation, Citibank, the Bank of the Philippine Islands, Equitable PCI Bank, in addition to the formerly government-owned Philippine National Bank came under the control of Chinese shareholders. Among the top ten private commercial banks in 1993, Chinese-Filipino business families were in full control of four of them, namely the Metropolitan Bank, Allied Bank, Equitable Banking, and China Banking. George Ty&#x27;s Metropolitan Bank generated the industry&#x27;s highest share of gross revenues and net income in addition to holding the Filipino banking industry&#x27;s largest amount of total assets during that year. In 1993, Chinese-owned Filipino banks controlled 38.43 percent of the total assets in the private Filipino commercial banking sector. By 1995, banks owned by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry had captured an even greater market share of the Philippines&#x27;s financial services sector after the formerly government-owned Philippine National Bank was partially privatized, along with four of the top five banks that were substantially controlled by Chinese shareholders claiming 48 percent of all bank assets and over 60 percent of all those held by private domestic commercial banks. At the turn of the 20th century, among the plethora of mergers and acquisitions that occurred within the Filipino banking sector due to major industry realignments that were set in motion with regards to how private commercial banks were owned, sparked a flurry of mergers and acquisitions that continued to consolidate the Chinese community&#x27;s grip on the Philippines&#x27;s private commercial banking sector. Among the most notable transactions that took place was George Ty&#x27;s Metrobank, which at this time acquired Asian Bank and Global Business Bank and with Lucio Tan in 1992 having assumed a 67 percent controlling ownership of the privatized Philippine National Bank, which was once the Philippines&#x27;s foremost government bank following the aftermath of the country&#x27;s national privatization program in the 1980s. Tan has since then solidified a commanding presence in the Filipino banking sector towards the beginning of the new millennium when he continued his corporate onslaught through the buyout, absorption, and subsequent merger of Philippine National Bank with his own bank, Allied Bank. Fellow taipan John Gokongwei was also a major shareholder in the Far East Bank, Philippine Commercial and International Bank, and controlled a 19 percent stake in the Philippine Trust Company. During the 1999 Filipino banking mergers and acquisition frenzy, Gokongwei realized an immense windfall gain following the high-profit sale of his shares in PCIB and the Far East Bank in the process. In terms of industry distribution, Chinese-owned firms account for a quarter of the Filipino financial services sector. Today, the overwhelming majority of the Philippines&#x27;s nine principal banks in addition to the formerly state-owned Philippine National Bank are now under the ownership of Chinese shareholders, including the Allied Banking Corporation, Banco de Oro Group, China Banking Corporation (Chinabank), East West Banking Corporation, Metrobank group, Philippine Trust Company (Philtrust Bank), Rizal Commercial Banking group, Security Bank Corporation (Security Bank) and the United Coconut Planters Bank. Most of these banks comprise a larger part of an umbrella owned family conglomerate with assets exceeding ₱100 billion. The total combined assets of all the Philippines&#x27;s commercial banks under Chinese ownership account for 25.72 percent of all the aggregate assets in the entire Filipino commercial banking system. Among the Philippines&#x27;s 35 banks, shareholders of Chinese ancestry on average control 30 percent of the total banking equity. There are also 23 Filipino insurance agencies that are Chinese-owned, with some branches operating overseas and in Hong Kong.

Filipinos of Chinese ancestry also wield enormous clout over the Philippines&#x27;s real estate sector with much of the modern industry&#x27;s grip being commercially grasped in their shrewdly enterprising and investment-savvy clutches. The line of revenue-generating business and income-producing investment opportunities that allowed the Chinese to expand their economic predominance into the Filipino real estate industry presented themselves occurred when they were finally conferred full-fledged Filipino citizenship during the Martial Law Period in order to gain the privilege to buy, sell, and own land. Initially, the Chinese were not allowed to own land until formally acquiring Filipino citizenship in the 1970s, which eventually permitted them to be granted with the same economic rights, freedoms, and privileges as their indigenous Filipino counterparts. In the aftermath of such a historically significant legal change that occurred throughout the Filipino geopolitical landscape at this time, its reverberating ramifications afterwards soon led to an upsurge of massive land purchases throughout the country predominated by Filipino investors of Chinese ancestry which started by the next decade following the country&#x27;s political transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. The acquisition of Filipino citizenship during the 1970s allowed the Chinese to expand their economic presence even more greatly by venturing into larger-scale investment-grade commercial real estate ventures and delving into other property investment opportunities that inevitably augmented and galvanized their economic grip on the Filipino real estate markets while elevating their respective socioeconomic positions in the process. Since the 1980s, Filipino businessmen and investors of Chinese ancestry have cornered much of the Philippines&#x27;s real estate investment markets, land, and property development sectors, when much of the industry&#x27;s grasp had long been held by the Spaniards. Chinese-owned Filipino real estate companies have devoured large swathes of prime commercial and residential real estate across Metro Manila and other urban Filipino cities utilized for the exploitative purposes of profit through commercial property development and investment. Since 1990, the Filipino real estate markets have been primarily controlled by both Chinese and non-Chinese Filipino entrepreneurs and investors alike, all strategically vying for lucrative opportunities in key property developments and prime real estate investments across the country. The competitive landscape amongst these entrepreneurs and investors alike have been positioning themselves to capitalize on the promising potential for profitability. Notably through cash flow generation and capital appreciation in rapidly growing real estate markets around the country, leading to intense competition among these stakeholders. Presently, many of the biggest real estate development operators in the Philippines are owned by Filipino businessmen and investors of Chinese ancestry following the exodus of the Spanish Filipino Mestizo landowning elites such as the Araneta&#x27;s, Ayala&#x27;s, Lopez&#x27;s, and Ortiga&#x27;s. Of the 500 real estate companies operating in the Philippines, 120 are owned by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry with the firms mostly specializing in real estate investment, land, and property development, in addition to construction having much of their commercial presence mainly being concentrated in the Manila Metropolitan area. Well-known real estate companies controlled by some of the Philippines&#x27;s most high-profile businessmen and investors include SMDC owned by the Sy&#x27;s, Robinsons Land by the Gokongwei&#x27;s, Megaworld Properties &amp; Holdings Inc. which is controlled by Andrew Tan, Filinvest that is commanded by the Gotianun&#x27;s, and DoubleDragon Properties, presided by businessman Edgar Sia II of Mang Inasal fame. Large scale commercial real estate projects such as the Eton Centris in Pinyahan, the Shangri-La Plaza in Mandaluyong and the Tagaytay Highlands Golf Club and Resort development in Tagaytay City were testaments of such joint projects undertaken by Filipino real estate developers of Chinese ancestry in cooperation with other fellow Overseas Chinese dealmakers operating throughout the Southeast Asian real estate markets. These corporate partnerships were largely forged by Overseas Chinese business tycoons such as the investor Liem Sioe Liong, businessman Robert Kuok and dealmakers Andrew Gotianun, Henry Sy, George Ty and Lucio Tan. Besides being responsible for spearheading the pioneering development and growth of the Philippines&#x27;s modern real estate industry, both Sy and Tan have been generous patrons of the mainland Chinese on top of the local Chinese Filipino community, ardently extending their philanthropic hospitality by actively investing in the economic development and revitalization of their ancestral hometowns back in China. With Sy constructing supermalls in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Suzhou and Tan developing a 30-story banking center in Xiamen.

The Chinese also pioneered the Filipino shipping industry which eventually germinated into a major industry sector as a means of transporting goods cheaply and quickly between the islands. Filipino entrepreneurs of Chinese ancestry have remained dominant in the Philippines&#x27;s maritime shipping and sea transport industry as it was one of the few efficient methods of transporting goods cheaply and quickly across the country, with the Philippines geographically being an archipelago, comprising more than 1000 islands and inlets. There are 12 Filipino business families of Chinese ancestry engaged in inter-island transport and shipping, particularly with the shipping of food products requiring refrigeration amounting to an aggregate capitalization of ₱10 billion. Taiwanese expatriate investors have participated in various joint ventures by opening up new shipping lanes on the route between Manila and Cebu. Prominent shipping lines owned by Filipinos of Chinese ancestry include Cokaliong Shipping Lines, Gothong Lines, Lite Shipping Corporation, Sulpicio Lines which was infamously associated with a tragedy that led to the deaths of hundreds and Trans-Asia Shipping Lines. One enterprising and pioneering Filipino businessman of Chinese ancestry was William Chiongbian, who established William Lines in 1949, which by the end of 1993, became the most profitable inter-island Filipino shipping line ranking first in terms of gross revenue generated as well as net income among the country&#x27;s seven biggest shipping companies at that time. Currently, the Filipino inter-island shipping industry is dominated by four Chinese-owned shipping lines led by William Chiongbian&#x27;s William Lines. Likewise, Filipinos of Chinese ancestry also own all of the major airlines in the country, including the flagship carrier Philippine Airlines, AirphilExpress, Cebu Pacific, South East Asian Airlines, Air Manila and Zest Air.

As Filipino businesspeople of Chinese ancestry became more financially prosperous, they often coalesced their financial resources and pooled large amounts of seed capital together to forge joint business ventures with expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese businessmen and investors from all over the world. Like other Chinese-owned businesses operating throughout the Southeast Asian markets, Chinese-owned businesses in the Philippines often link up with Greater Chinese and other Overseas Chinese businesses and networks across the globe to focus on new business opportunities to collaborate and concentrate on. Common industry sectors of focus include real estate, engineering, textiles, consumer electronics, financial services, food, semiconductors, and chemicals. Besides sharing a common ancestry, cultural, linguistic, and familial ties, many Filipino entrepreneurs and investors of Chinese ancestry are particular strong adherents of the Confucian paradigm of interpersonal relationships when doing business with each other, as the Chinese believed that the underlying source for entrepreneurial and investment success relied on the nurturing of personal relationships. Moreover, Filipino businesses that are Chinese-owned form a part of the larger bamboo network, an umbrella business network of Overseas Chinese companies operating in the markets of Greater China and Southeast Asia that share common family, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural ties. With the spectacular growth of varying success stories witnessed by a number of individual Chinese Filipino business tycoons and investors have allowed them to expand their traditional corporate activities beyond the Philippines to forge international partnerships with increasing numbers of expatriate Mainland and Overseas Chinese investors on a global scale. Instead of quixotically diverting excess profits elsewhere, many Filipino businesspeople of Chinese ancestry are known for their penurious and parsimonious ways by eschewing improvident lavish extravagances and frivolous conspicuous consumption but instead adhere to the Chinese paradigm of being frugal by pragmatically, productively, and methodically reinvesting substantial surpluses of their business profits devoted for the purpose of commercial business expansion and performing the acquisition of cash flow producing and income-generating assets. A sizable percentage of the conglomerates managed by capable Filipino entrepreneurs and investors of Chinese ancestry that are armed with the necessary managerial capabilities, enterprising disposition, commercial expertise, entrepreneurial acumen, investment savvy, and visionary foresight were able to germinate from small budding enterprises to making headway into gargantuan corporate leviathans garnering widespread economic influence across the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and the global financial markets. Such massive corporate expansions engendered the term &quot;Chinoy&quot;, which is colloquially used in Filipino newspapers to denote Filipino individuals with a degree of Chinese ancestry who either speak a Chinese dialect or adhere to Chinese customs.

As Chinese economic might grew, much of the indigenous Filipino majority were gradually driven out and displaced into poorer land on the hills, on the outskirts of major Filipino cities, or into the mountains. Disenchantment grew among the displaced indigenous Filipinos who felt they were unable compete with Chinese-owned businesses. Underlying resentment and bitterness from the impoverished Filipino majority has been accumulating as there has been no existence of indigenous Filipino having any substantial business equity in the Philippines. Decades of free market liberalization brought virtually no economic benefit to the indigenous Filipino majority but rather the opposite resulting a subjugated indigenous Filipino majority underclass, where the vast disproportion of indigenous Filipinos still engage in rural peasantry, menial labor or domestic service and squatting. The Filipino government has dealt with this wealth disparity by establishing socialist and communist dictatorships or authoritarian regimes while pursuing a systematic and ruthless affirmative action campaigns giving privileges to allow the indigenous Filipino majority to gain a more equitable economic footing during the 1950s and 1960s. The rise of economic nationalism among the impoverished indigenous Filipino majority prompted by the Filipino government resulted in the passing of the Retail Trade Nationalization Law of 1954, where ethnic Chinese were barred and pressured to move out of the retail sector restricting engagement to Filipino citizens only. In addition, the Chinese were prevented from owning land by restricting land ownership to Filipinos only. Other restrictions on Chinese economic activities included limiting Chinese involvement in the import-export trade while trying to increase the indigenous Filipino involvement to gain a proportionate presence. In 1960, the Rice and Corn Nationalization Law was passed restricting trading, milling, and warehousing of rice and corn only to Filipinos while barring Chinese involvement, in which they initially had a significant presence. These policies ultimately backfired on the government as the laws had an overall negative impact on the government tax revenue which dropped significantly because the country&#x27;s biggest source of taxpayers were Chinese, who eventually took their capital out of the country to invest elsewhere. The increased economic clout held in the hands of the Chinese has triggered bitterness, suspicion, resentment, envy, insecurity, grievance, instability, ethnic hatred, and outright anti-Chinese hostility among the indigenous native Filipino majority towards the Chinese minority. Such hostility has resulted in the kidnapping of hundreds of Chinese Filipinos by indigenous Filipinos since the 1990s. Many victims, often children are brutally murdered, even after a ransom is paid. Numerous incidents of crimes such kidnap-for-ransom, extortion, and other forms of harassment were committed against the Chinese Filipino community starting from the early 1990s continues to this very day. Thousands of displaced Filipino hill tribes and aborigines continue to live in satellite shantytowns on the outskirts of Manila in economic destitution where two-thirds of the country&#x27;s indigenous Filipinos live on less than 2 dollars per day in extreme poverty. Such animosity, antagonmism, bitterness, envy, grievance, hatred, insecurity, and resentment is ready at any moment to be catalyzed as a form of vengeneance by the downtrodden indigenous Filipino majority as many Chinese Filipinos are subject to kidnapping, vandalism, murder, and violence. Anti-Chinese sentiment among the indigenous Filipino majority is deeply rooted in poverty but also feelings of resentment and exploitation are also exhibited among native and mestizo Filipinos blaming their socioeconomic failures on the Chinese.

==Future trends==
Most of the younger generations of &quot;pure&quot; Chinese Filipinos are descendants of Chinese who migrated during the 1800s onward – this group retains much of Chinese culture, customs, and work ethic (though not necessarily language), whereas almost all Chinese mestizos are descendants of Chinese who migrated even before the Spanish colonial period and have been integrated and assimilated into the general Philippine society as a whole.

There are four trends that the Chinese Filipino would probably undertake within a generation or so:
*assimilation and integration, as in the case of Chinese Thais who eventually lost their genuine Chinese heritage and adopted Thai culture and language as their own
*separation, where the Chinese Filipino community can be clearly distinguished from the other ethnic groups in the Philippines; reminiscent of most Chinese Malaysians
*returning to the ancestral land, which is the current phenomenon of overseas Chinese returning to China
*emigration to North America and Australasia, as in the case of some Chinese Malaysians and many Chinese Vietnamese (Hoa people)

During the 1970s, Fr. Charles McCarthy, an expert in Philippine-Chinese relations, observed that &quot;the peculiarly Chinese content of the Philippine-Chinese subculture is further diluted in succeeding generations&quot; and he made a prediction that &quot;the time will probably come and it may not be far off, when, in this sense, there will no more &#x27;Chinese&#x27; in the Philippines&quot;. This view is still controversial however, with the constant adoption of new cultures by Filipinos contradicting this thought.

===Integration and assimilation===

Assimilation is defined as the adoption of the cultural norms of the dominant or host culture, while integration is defined as the adoption of the cultural norms of the dominant or host culture while maintaining their culture of origin.

As of the present day, due to the effects of globalization in the Philippines, there has been a marked tendency to assimilate to Filipino lifestyles influenced by the US, among ethnic Chinese. This is especially true for younger Chinese Filipino living in Metro Manila who are gradually shifting to English as their preferred language, thus identifying more with Western culture, at the same time speaking Chinese among themselves. Similarly, as the cultural divide between Chinese Filipino and other Filipinos erode, there is a steady increase of intermarriages with native and mestizo Filipinos, with their children completely identifying with the Filipino culture and way of life. Assimilation is gradually taking place in the Philippines, albeit at a slower rate as compared to Thailand.

On the other hand, the largest Chinese Filipino organization, the &quot;Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran&quot; openly espouses eventual integration but not assimilation of the Chinese Filipino with the rest of Philippine society and clamors for maintaining Chinese language education and traditions.

Meanwhile, the general Philippine public is largely neutral regarding the role of the Chinese Filipino in the Philippines, and many have embraced Chinese Filipino as fellow Filipino citizens and even encouraged them to assimilate and participate in the formation of the Philippines&#x27; destiny.

===Separation===

Separation is defined as the rejection of the dominant or host culture in favor of preserving their culture of origin, often characterized by the presence of ethnic enclaves.

The recent rapid economic growth of both China and Taiwan as well as the successful business acumen of Overseas Chinese have fueled among many Chinese Filipino a sense of pride through immersion and regaining interest in Chinese culture, customs, values and language while remaining in the Philippines.

Despite the community&#x27;s inherent ethnocentrism – there are no active proponents for political separation, such as autonomy or even independence, from the Philippines, partly due to the small size of the community relative to the general Philippine population, and the scattered distribution of the community throughout the archipelago, with only half residing in Metro Manila.

===Returning to the ancestral land===

Many Chinese-Filipino entrepreneurs and professionals have flocked to their ancestral homeland to partake of business and employment opportunities opened up by China&#x27;s emergence as a global economic superpower.

As above, the fast economic growth of China and the increasing popularity of Chinese culture has also helped fan pro-China patriotism among a majority of Chinese Filipino who espouse 愛國愛鄉 (ài guó ài xiāng) sentiments (love of ancestral country and hometown). Some Chinese Filipino, especially those belonging to the older generation, still demonstrate &quot;ài guó ài xiāng&quot; by donating money to fund clan halls, school buildings, Buddhist temples and parks in their hometowns in China.

===Emigration to North America and Australasia===

During the 1990s to the early 2000s, Philippine economic difficulties and more liberal immigration policies in destination countries have led to well-to-do Chinese Filipino families to acquire North American or Australasian passports and send their children abroad to attend prestigious North America or Australasian universities. Many of these children are opting to remain after graduation to start professional careers in North America or Australasia, like their Chinese brethren from other parts of Asia.

Many Philippine-educated Chinese Filipino from middle-class families are also migrating to North America and Australasia for economic advantages. Those who have family businesses regularly commute between North America (or Australasia) and the Philippines. In this way, they follow the well-known pattern of other Chinese immigrants to North America who lead &quot;astronaut&quot; lifestyles: family in North America, business in Asia.

<text>Chaudhvin Ka Chand () is a 1960 Indian Hindi-language film directed by Mohammed Sadiq. 

This film was a super-hit at the box-office, and became one of the top-grossing films of 1960. A production of Guru Dutt, the film centers on a love triangle between Dutt, Rehman and Waheeda Rehman, and features music by Ravi. After the disastrous box office performance of &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot;, Guru Dutt ventured into the idea of producing a commercial project to protect his studio from ruin. The next commercial venture by the studio was &quot;Chaudhvin ka Chand&quot;, which was a successful comeback film for Guru Dutt and saved Guru Dutt&#x27;s production studio.

The film is considered a notable Muslim-social. It was ranked &quot;#28&quot; in 2003 Outlook Magazine poll of &quot;25 Leading Indian Directors&quot; for &quot;Best Bollywood Movies of all time&quot;&quot;&quot;. Filmfare listed it among &quot;Seven Muslim socials you must watch&quot;&quot;&quot;. 

Its music album was ranked #30 in &quot;Top 100 Bollywood Albums&quot; by &quot;Film Companion&quot; website. The film&#x27;s title track &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot; became especially popular and is noted for picturization of the song sequence. The song is regarded as one of the most acclaimed romantic ballads in India and one of the most loved &quot;filmi&quot; songs of all time.

In 2014, the film&#x27;s screenplay was published as a book, titled &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand: The Original Screenplay&quot;, by the film historians Dinesh Raheja and Jitendra Kothari. 

This film also entered into the 2nd Moscow International Film Festival.

== Plot ==
The setting is the city of Lucknow in northern India, where Islamic culture flourished. Aslam and Nawab are two best friends looking for a wife and end up in an accidental love triangle. 

At a gathering they attend, the ladies exchange veils for fun. This causes the two best friends who live in this city to accidentally fall in love with the same woman named Jameela. Jameela is in love with Aslam and marries him. After marriage, Aslam figures out that his friend Nawab had fallen in love with Jameela as well. However, because the veils had been switched by the girls earlier he was unaware of this. Aslam wants nothing but his friend Nawab to be happy and tries to act in a way that would cause Jameela to divorce him, so that Nawab can then marry her. However, Jameela loves Aslam despite this and will not leave him. Eventually Nawab realizes the misunderstanding and is overcome with grief to cause his friend so much sorrow. He is devastated and commits suicide knowing this will ensure there are no obstacles to Aslam loving Jameela.

Hence, the music composing of this film was offered to composer Ravi and was critically acclaimed, and the lyrics by Shakeel Badayuni. The title song is sung by Mohammed Rafi.

<text>Sinfjötli ( ) or Fitela (in Old English) in Norse mythology was born out of the incestuous relationship between Sigmund and his sister Signy. He had the half-brothers Sigurd, Helgi Hundingsbane and Hamund.

==Etymology and orthography==
&quot;Sinfjǫtli&quot; is formed from two parts, &quot;sin-&quot;, and &quot;fjǫtli&quot;. The latter is cognate with the Old English &quot;Fitela&quot;. In the standardized Old Norse orthography, the name is spelled &quot;Sinfjǫtli&quot;, but the letter &#x27;ǫ&#x27; is frequently replaced with the Modern Icelandic ö for reasons of familiarity or technical expediency.

==Life==
In &quot;Beowulf&quot;, Fitela is the nephew of Sigmund, whereas the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; describes him as both Sigmund&#x27;s son and nephew due to incest.

In the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Sinfjǫtli is the grandson of King Völsung. Signý, King Völsung&#x27;s daughter, despises her husband King Siggeir, and begs &quot;that she may not be made to return to King Siggeir.&quot; Völsung denies her request to leave, reminding her of the commitment their family must maintain. Despite a warning from Signý, King Völsung and his 10 sons engage in a battle as King Siggeir&#x27;s unbeatable army treacherously murders King Völsung. Signý pleads with her husband not to dispose of her 10 brothers, but rather Siggeir grants her request &quot;because [he thinks] it better that they suffer more and are tortured longer before they die.&quot;

Through 9 long nights, a returning she-wolf (thought to be King Siggeir&#x27;s mother) kills 9 of Signý&#x27;s brothers in turn. A message is passed to the last brother remaining, Sigmund, to smear honey on his face and bite the tongue out of the she-wolf&#x27;s mouth, thus killing her and saving himself. Since Sigmund has lost his father and brothers, Signý wishes to support him in avenging their family by sending her son to be his companion in his hideout in the forest. However, each of her sons by King Siggeir proves cowardly: they cannot withstand the pain of having the cuffs of their kirtles sewn to their skin. So Signý has Sigmund kill them as they are no longer of any use. Sigmund being of the Völsung line, Signý believes her brother will produce a son worthy of claiming a place in that line, and one night she &quot;exchange[s] shape&quot; with a völva, goes to Sigmund in his underground dwelling, and spends three nights in his bed with Sigmund unaware that she is his sister in another form. Very unlike her previous sons born of the devious and unpleasant King Siggeir, Signý then bears a son who is no less strong, handsome, and fearless than Völsung himself. This is Sinfjǫtli, who together with Sigmund will avenge their clan by killing Siggeir. Sinfjǫtli ignores the pain, saying that &quot;such pain would seem trifling to Völsung.&quot; The incestuous product of the coalesced Völsung line, he is capable of the great deeds Signý requires.

In their wanderings, before killing Siggeir, he and Sigmund come across men sleeping in cursed wolves&#x27; skins. By killing the men and donning the wolf skins, they are cursed with a type of lycanthropy.

Sigmund and Sinfjǫtli go to Hunaland where Sigmund is proclaimed king of the Huns. He marries Borghild and has the sons Helgi Hundingsbane and Hámundr. Sinfjötli slays Borghild&#x27;s brother while vying for a woman both the brother and Sinfjǫtli want. Borghild avenges her brother by poisoning Sinfjötli. In order to dispose of him, Borghild gives Sigmund three cups of wine, of which the last contains poison. Sigmund, suspecting Borghild, drinks two of the cups, but inebriated, encourages Sinfjǫtli to drink the third, which he does, and subsequently dies.

Sigmund brings his son&#x27;s corpse to the fjords, where he meets Odin disguised as a ferryman. The ferryman says that he can only take one passenger at a time and takes Sinfjǫtli&#x27;s body first. Out on the water, he and Sinfjǫtli disappear.

Sigmund goes home and banishes Borghild. This is roughly the tale told in J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún&quot;.

In the First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane, from the Poetic Edda, Gudmund accuses Sinfjǫtli of being a werewolf.

<doc id="1167865" wikidata="Q2656382" url="?curid=1167865" title="Christmas Uprising">
<text>The Christmas Uprising (), also known as the Christmas Rebellion (, ), was a failed uprising in Montenegro led by the Greens in early January 1919. The military leader of the uprising was Krsto Popović and its political leader was Jovan Plamenac.

The catalyst for the uprising was a decision of the controversial Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, commonly known as the Podgorica Assembly. The assembly decided to directly unify the Kingdom of Montenegro with the Kingdom of Serbia, which would shortly after become the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Following a questionable candidate selection process, the unionist Whites outnumbered the Greens, who were in favour of preserving Montenegrin statehood.

The uprising reached a climax in Cetinje on 7 January 1919, which was the date of Eastern Orthodox Christmas. The unionists with support from the Serbian Army defeated the rebel Greens. In the aftermath of the uprising, the dethroned King Nikola of Montenegro was forced to issue a call for peace, since many homes were destroyed. As a result of the uprising, a number of participants complicit in the uprising were tried and imprisoned. Other participants in the uprising fled to the Kingdom of Italy, meanwhile some retreated to the mountains and continued guerrilla resistance under the banner of the Montenegrin Army in exile, which lasted until 1929. The most notable guerilla militia leader was Savo Raspopović.

==Background==
Multiple historians acknowledge that a majority of Montenegrins supported the unification with other Southern Slavs on a federal basis after the World War I. However, support for unification did not involve the same degree of support for the Podgorica Assembly, since many of those who supported unification wanted Montenegro to join the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as an autonomous entity, ultimately in a confederation rather than a centralized Serbian kingdom.

Historian Ivo Banac suggested that the Greens enjoyed support from a larger proportion of the population but were comparably poorly organised, indecisive, and politically divided. While some fought for full independence and the return of Nikola to the country, others supported union with Serbia, objecting only to Montenegro&#x27;s unequal status in such a union.

==Plan==
The plan of the Greens consisted of six points.

* &quot;Vojvoda &quot;, leading several rebel battalions, was to take the town of Nikšić. From there, they were to march through Čevo and Cuce to Cetinje, in coordination with rebels from Njeguši.
* General Milutin Vučinić, leading troops from Piperi, Lješkopolje and Zeta, was to attack Podgorica and move towards Cetinje, crossing through Lješanska nahija. His troops were to meet up with the troops of &quot;vojvoda&quot; Đuro Petrović between Čevo and Lješanska nahija.
* Jovan Plamenac, leading troops from Crmnica, and with the support of detachments from Ljubotinj, was to head towards Cetinje. The three groups were to attack Cetinje simultaneously to disarm the Serbian troops there, and kill them if they resisted. In the case of a victory, the plan was to transport captured Serbians to the island of Lesendro in Lake Skadar. Rebels were instructed to carry food for three days, and the government in exile in Neuilly-sur-Seine was requested to provide food for 15,000 people for twenty days, a uniform for those currently without one, rifles, machine guns, ammunition and several cannons. They were to send the food and equipment to a place near Lake Skadar.
* When the entirety of Montenegro is freed, the government in exile would begin sending food more regularly to the civilian population.
* Expecting a counter-attack from the Vasojevići and Serbians, the government in exile was requested to facilitate the creation of bands of Albanian fighters which would attack them between Peć and Plav. For this reason, the government in exile was to supply Jovan Plamenac with 1.200.000 francs.
* The government in exile was to inform the world of the public opinion in Montenegro.

This plan was delivered to Antonio Baldacci on 14 December 1918.

==Rebellion==
===Fighting around Podgorica===
The rebellion first broke out around Podgorica. Some Martinići headed by commanders Stevan and Bogić Radović took control of Spuž Fortress. The Piperi headed by Brigadier General Milutin Vučinić severed the road between Danilovgrad and Podgorica at Vranićke Njive. Commander Andrija and Captain Mato Raičević seized Velje Brdo overlooking Podgorica.

Since most Bjelopavlići were supporters of the unification, the rebels who occupied Spuž Fortress were quickly forced to capitulate with no bullets fired. The leaders were detained and their troops were sent home. The Bjelopavlići, for the most part consisting of the youth, continued toward Podgorica. They were met at Vranićke Njive by Vučinić, where fighting would have probably broken out, had the youth of Podgorica, Piperi and Kuči not simultaneously reached his troops from behind. Vučinić was surrounded, and ordered his troops to lay down their arms. The leaders were, again, detained and transported to Podgorica, and the troops sent home. The same happened at Velje Brdo.

The defeat at Podgorica would prove to be a strong setback for the rebels, since the troops that were disarmed were supposed to help with the sieges of Nikšić and Cetinje. Also, the rebels seemed less united and less willing, which had its toll on the confidence of the Greens in other areas.

===Fighting around Nikšić===
The town of Nikšić was surrounded on but no fighting broke out until the afternoon of 5 January. The siege was led from one side by Major Šćepan Mijušković, a veteran of several previous wars. During the morning, the rebels delivered an ultimatum to the town&#x27;s defenders to send their commanders to the new brewery by the Bistrica river. Shots were fired first from Trebjesa hill, and after from Čađelica, Glavica and from around the brewery.

The town&#x27;s youth organized a council where Dr Niko Martinović was elected president, and Marko Kavaja, later screenwriter, secretary. Some veterans also joined, however the troops in the town under the command of Captain Stojić lost contact with Cetinje and stood down. Stojić armed the youth with one machine gun. Kavaja went to negotiate with the rebels in Pandurica, in the company of a POW, the brother of Radojica Nikčević, one of the rebel leaders. He claims that the rebels were not opposed to the unification, but were fighting for their &quot;honorable &quot;vojvodas&quot; and &quot;serdars&quot;&quot;. The negotiations failed to stop the fighting.

At sunset, the siege was relieved by Bjelopavlići forces. After hearing that more reinforcements from Grahovo were coming to the aid of the defenders, many rebels deserted. The Drobnjaci arrived late to the defense, being sidetracked by bad weather. After the fighting had ended, several rebel leaders were captured including Đuro and Marko Petrović, and former Defense Minister Marko Đukanović. Misja Nikolić and Brigadier General Đuro Jovović escaped, having gone into hiding and crossed into Italy, respectively.

===Siege of Virpazar===
Unrest started around the Crmnica town of Virpazar on , where the supporters of King Nicholas were led by Jovan Plamenac.

According to Commander Jagoš Drašković, Plamenac approached Virpazar in the morning of 3 January with over 400 men, while Drašković defended the town with around 350. The number of defenders increased during the day, and Plamenac hoped to reach the Italian troops further to the south for supplies and ammunition. Since Drašković placed his troops between Plamenac and the Italians, Plamenac agreed to meet with Drašković, who was accompanied by Dr Blažo Lekić, leader of the Crmnica youth and an older local, Stanko Đurović. Plamenac agreed to send his men home, in return for a letter guaranteeing his safe passage to Cetinje after his men disbanded.

Drašković concludes that Plamenac agreed to disband his troops because he was unsure of his victory, and because his plan was to deal with Virpazar and Rijeka Crnojevića quickly, after which his troops in the area could join the siege of Cetinje, which was planned to be over by 5 January. Since this proved impossible, he counted on improving the Greens&#x27; odds with Cetinje by appearing in person and in the company of at least a few men.

Plamenac disbanded most of his troops in the evening of 3 January, and proceeded to his native village of Boljevići with around 60 men, who planned to march on Cetinje the following day. On 4 January, Andrija Radović stopped in Virpazar while returning from Shkodër, where he held a speech in front of the Crmnica locals. He threatened Plamenac, and pointed out that he was now decorated with more foreign honors than the late Ilija Plamenac. Drašković considers this speech to have acted to the detriment of the White cause, primarily because it enraged the locals who held Ilija Plamenac in high regard. Because of this new situation, Jovan Plamenac started rallying his men again.

In the evening of 4 January, Drašković marched on Boljevići with around 150 men, but Plamenac had already retreated toward Seoca and Krnjice. Drašković returned to Virpazar and boarded his men on a ship headed for Krnjice, where he attacked Plamenac and his troops. The Greens retreated into Skadarska Krajina, and crossed the Bojana to join the Italian troops in Albania.

===Fighting around Rijeka Crnojevića===
Though a minor hamlet, Rijeka Crnojevića was central to the Greens&#x27; plan. After its fall, troops from the area were to launch a serious strike on Cetinje. The town was surrounded on by troops under the command of Commander Đuro Šoć. The towns defenders were led by Brigade General Niko Pejanović and, though low in number, held their positions.

The first day of the siege, Pejanović wrote to one of the Greens&#x27; commanders to call off the attack. Šoć wrote to the local command, the head of the &quot;srez&quot; and the president of the municipality. He requested that the defenders produce three hostages, evacuate all Serbian troops and provided that the defenders leave Rijeka Crnojevića armed, after which he guaranteed that they would be escorted to Shkodër with honor. He states in his letters that Montenegro had been &quot;sold for Judas&#x27; silver&quot; and that while being the &quot;torch of Serb freedom&quot;, it was occupied by &quot;brotherly Šumadijans who replaces the Austro-Hungarians&quot;. His claims that 35,000 Montenegrins were participating in the uprising and that Virpazar was already conquered were widely overstated.

During the night, reinforcements arrived from Podgorica to lift the siege. According to Jovan Ćetković, member of the Podgorica Assembly, the youth of Podgorica met with the Greens during the night around Carev Laz near Rvaši. After a short verbal confrontation, leaders of the youth agreed to negotiate with the Greens in Rvaši. Todor Božović, Captain Jovan Vuksanović and Podgorica Assembly MP Nikola Kovačević–Mizara proceeded to Rvaši accompanied by 5-6 other members of the youth. The rest set up camp near Carev Laz and were led by Captain Radojica Damjanović and flag-bearer Nikola Dragović. There, they met Captains Đuza Đurašković and Marko Radunović who were waiting for a negotiator from the Greens. They waited in Rvaši until daybreak, when a group went toward Rijeka to the village of Drušići. They found &quot;serdar&quot; Joko Jovićević who summoned a local, Captain Đuko Kostić, and initiated negotiations between the two groups.

In the morning of 4 January, while the groups were negotiating, the youth decided to push forward contrary to the command of Todor Božović. They met the Greens under the command of Captain Jovan Vujović in the village of Šinđon, near Rijeka Crnojevića, where the Greens held higher ground. The Greens realized that, while initially outnumbering the town&#x27;s defenders, they were now outnumbered. They agreed to send their men home and salute to the Whites&#x27; flag, which was highly unpopular among the rebel troops.

After breaking the siege of Rijeka Crnojevića, the Whites achieved an extremely significant victory and by 5 January, troops under the command of Serbian General Dragutin Milutinović had both ended a minor uprising in Rijeka Crnojevića and had stopped a larger attack on Nikšić.

===Siege of Cetinje===
As Jovan Plamenac and the other rebel leaders had planned, Cetinje turned out to be the epicenter of the uprising. After several days of exchanging letters, the rebels began forming armed squads on 1918. The rebels gathered in front of the House of Government on 1 January 1919 and left town for the hills. Recruits were called to arms by ringing the church bells in the vicinity of Cetinje. By 2 January, Cetinje was surrounded from all sides.

According to Ćetković, the town was, at this moment in time, defended by around 100 members of the national guard i.e 20–30 men each from several tribes around Cetinje, 50–60 members of the youth, 50 gendarmes and policemen and 100 members of the 2nd Yugoslav Regiment under Colonel Dragutin Milutinović. The troops were lacking in ammunition, and every defender had between 50 and 100 rounds. Milutinović&#x27;s troops were armed with two cannons and around 1,000 shells.

Youth leader Marko Daković requested that Milutinović deliver arms to his troops, but since he was himself lacking in arms and ammunition, he directed Daković toward the commander of the Second Army stationed in Sarajevo, &quot;vojvoda&quot; Stepa Stepanović. The telephone lines were still operational and Stepanović allowed Daković to restock from the army garrison in Tivat. During 2 January, leader of the Lješanska national guard Lieutenant Radoje Ćetković reached Tivat and returned with around 2,000 rifles and ample ammunition.

The following day, on 3 January, a delegation headed by Brigade Generals Milutin Vukotić and Jovo Bećir went to negotiate with the rebel leaders at their headquarters in the village of Bajice. According to General Milutinović, the negotiations were unsuccessful and he went to negotiate personally around 2 P.M. Milutinović met Captain Đuro Drašković and Lieutenant Ilija Bećir, the latter of whom he describes as insolent for having said &quot;Either the Serbians leave Montenegro or there will be blood, there isn&#x27;t and there cannot be any other way&quot;. In his return, Milutinović met his troops who begged him to attack Bajice, but their request was denied because he &quot;still hoped that everything would end peacefully&quot;.

In the morning of 4 January, &quot;serdar&quot; Janko Vukotić arrived in Cetinje. He had broken through the rebels&#x27; advance guard with a force of 30 men from Čevo. Milutinović advised Vukotić to make arrangements with the National Executive Committee, to allow him to try negotiating with the rebels in Bajice. The Committee agreed, and Vukotić went to Bajice by car, accompanied with two captains and an MP of the Podgorica Assembly . The two captains returned on foot not long after with word that Vukotić and the MP had been captured. Other than the capture of &quot;serdar&quot; Vukotić and some gendarmes encountering a minor roadblock on their way to the villages of Kosijeri and Jabuka, no fighting took place on that day.

Jailed in Bajice, &quot;serdar&quot; Janko Vukotić wrote to General Milutinović in the morning of 5 January, pleading him to allow the rebels to enter Cetinje without a struggle, while securing the area around his command with Serbian troops and the area between the Zetski Dom theater, the hospital and the barracks with troops under the command of &quot;vojvoda&quot; Stevo Vukotić. His message was pessimistic, as he believed Milutinović&#x27;s forces to be severely outnumbered. Around 6 A.M., a list of demands written by Captain Krsto Popović the previous day was delivered to Milutinović, asking for the termination of resolutions of the Podgorica Assembly. The message was delivered to Milutinović by Captain Đuro Drašković and Lieutenant Grujičić. Drašković complained to Milutinović verbally about the disrespect towards Montenegrin military units by the Serbian command.

In his letter, Captain Popović demanded that the organization of the emerging Kingdom of Yugoslavia be decided by the Constitutional Assembly, that anyone responsible for the events in Montenegro be tried and that new elections were held to produce a new government which would represent Montenegro in international relations. He gave Milutinović until 6 January to acquiesce and threatened to enter the town with several thousand troops. Milutinović replied to Popović promising to put an end to any irregularities by the new police authorities and agreeing to bring Popović&#x27;s requests to the government in Belgrade, but declining any of his other demands. Milutinović was more confident in his ability to hold Cetinje, as a load of arms and ammunition had arrived from Tivat the previous evening.

During the afternoon, &quot;vojvoda&quot; Stevo Vukotić, brother of Queen Milena of Montenegro, went to visit &quot;serdar&quot; Janko Vukotić in Bajice where he was being held. &quot;Serdar&quot; Janko pleaded with Stevo Vukotić in tears, while Stevo was unwilling to accept any of the rebels&#x27; demands. Milutinović held a meeting with the Executive Committee in the afternoon during which Divisional General Mitar Martinović suggested accepting the rebels&#x27; terms. Milutinović proceeded with his defense, ignoring the Committee&#x27;s stance, and put Prince Michael&#x27;s godfather Captain Božo Novaković in command of the volunteer troops.

In the evening of 5 January, an artillery unit from Zelenika armed with two cannons and led by Commander Ljubodrag Janković tried to reach Cetinje. They reached Kotor around 5 P.M. and set off for Cetinje two hours later. The unit was held back by the rebels at the village of Njeguši, after which the command in Kotor ordered them to open fire. They failed to follow their order and camped for the night on the hillside of Krstac near Njeguši. At the same time, a group of more than 600 Whites proceeded towards Cetinje from the failed siege of Rijeka Crnojevića. The group was made up of Kuči, Piperi and Bjelopavlići tribesmen. They formed a column near Belveder, where they were ambushed by the Greens. The group entered Cetinje near the hospital late in the evening.

On 6 January 1919, around 250 Serbian troops and 850 volunteers from nearby Montenegrin tribes fought a formation of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 rebel Greens in Cetinje. That day, the Greens initiated a siege on Cetinje, killing some members of the Great National Assembly and killing some Whites. After that, the Greens experienced severe factionalism, in addition to facing the militarily stronger Whites.

==International influence and reactions==
===Italian role===
As a result of the Podgorica Assembly, King Nicholas was exiled to the Kingdom of Italy, from which the uprising enjoyed substantial support, due to the Italian claims and desired influence in the region. King Nicholas&#x27;s Ministers asked for the Italian Expedition Corps in Albania to enter Montenegro, &quot;in order for it to be liberated solely by Italian troops&quot;. A committee organized by Italian ethnographer Antonio Baldacci supported the Greens until at least 1921.

In late November 1918 during the Podgorica Assembly, Italian troops attempted to take control of the coastal areas of Montenegro under the guise of Entente troop movement, but got prevented from doing so.

===International response===
In the spring of 1919, the United States sent Charles W. Furlong as an envoy from the Peace Commission to Montenegro. Furlong reported to &quot;The New York Times&quot; in an interview published on June 15, 1919, that the electors in the Podgorica Assembly acted as carpetbaggers did in the United States.

An initiative called the Inter-Allied Commission of Investigation monitored the Podgorica Assembly and the Whites after the uprising. It included Louis Franchet d&#x27;Espèrey, as well as lieutenants from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. They recorded that there were as few as 500 unionist troops in Montenegro, and that they were not exclusively Serbian but from other constituents of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The commission also concluded from interviewing Greens held as prisoners that the uprising had been &quot;caused by agents of King Nicholas I and supported by some emissaries from Italy.&quot;

==Aftermath==
Later in the twentieth century, the Christmas Uprising was subject to ideological emphasis in Montenegrin nationalism. In World War II, one of the earliest leaders of the Greens, Sekula Drljević, invited the Italian occupation of Montenegro and collaborated with the Independent State of Croatia in order to break away from Yugoslavia.

Since Montenegro declared independence from Serbia in 2006, the Christmas Uprising has been memorialized on polar opposite ends of the Montenegrin historical consciousness. In 1941, a memorial on the burial site of unionist Whites was destroyed by the Italian occupation of Montenegro in Cetinje. As of 2017, a walkway was paved on the same burial site in Cetinje without any recognition to the Whites. On 7 January 2008, on the 90th anniversary of the uprising, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo Đukanović revealed a memorial statue for the Greens who were killed in the insurrection.

<text>In British politics and some Commonwealth nations, a parliamentary assistant is an unelected partisan staff member employed by a Member of Parliament (MP) to assist them with their parliamentary duties. Parliamentary assistants usually work at the House of Commons in the UK Parliament or in their MP&#x27;s constituency office.

==Duties==
The duties of parliamentary assistants vary significantly depending on the MPs they work for and their position in Parliament; but generally they facilitate the day-to-day working life of their MP and make it as efficient as possible. The office in which a parliamentary assistant is based may determine the type of work they do. 

==Alternative titles and pay==
MPs may distinguish between parliamentary assistants in terms of seniority. For example, some MPs differentiate between parliamentary assistants and senior parliamentary assistants. Parliamentary assistants may also be called parliamentary researchers if they are principally tasked with conducting research. 

Salaries for MPs&#x27; staff are set by the MP they work for, but must be within the bounds of the pay scales set by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority.

In Australia, individuals employed by an MP at their electorate (constituency) office are usually referred to as electorate officers, if employed on a permanent or full-time basis, or assistant electorate officers, if employed on a part-time or casual basis. Such persons are also often referred to as staffers, and is a common way for younger party members to gain political experience prior to running for preselection in an internal ballot.

==Controversies==
In recent years, there has been controversy over the tradition of MPs hiring their family members as parliamentary assistants. In 2017, it was revealed that one in five MPs employed a member of their family, despite the practice being banned for new MPs before the 2017 general election.

<text>Bennet Evan Miller (born 24 February 1966) is an English comedian, actor and author. He rose to fame as one half of the comedy duo Armstrong and Miller. He is also known for his roles as Angus Jeremy Bough in the &quot;Johnny English&quot; film series, DI Richard Poole in the BBC crime drama series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; and James Lester in the ITV sci-fi series &quot;Primeval&quot;.

==Early life==
Bennet Evan Miller was born in London on 24 February 1966, the son of Welsh mother Marion and English father Michael Miller. He grew up in Nantwich, Cheshire. His father taught American literature at the City of Birmingham Polytechnic. His maternal grandfather was a Lithuanian immigrant. His paternal grandfather was a tailor in the East End of London, while his paternal great-grandmother taught English at South Cheshire College. He has two younger sisters. He is a distant cousin of Abraham Lincoln.

Miller was educated at Malbank School and Sixth Form College in Nantwich before studying Natural Sciences at St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate, he participated in theatre with his then-girlfriend, actress Rachel Weisz. He remained at Cambridge to read for a PhD in solid state physics, with his proposed thesis, &quot;Novel quantum effects in low-temperature quasi-zero-dimensional mesoscopic electron systems.&quot; He abandoned his thesis to pursue a career in comedy. His interest in comedy began when a friend asked him to help chauffeur the judges of the National Student Drama Festival, which was being held that year in Cambridge. Having already finished his degree, he joined the Footlights in 1989 and worked with Andy Parsons, David Wolstencroft and Sue Perkins before he directed a revue.

==Career==
Miller moved to London to pursue a career in comedy. He was introduced to fellow Cambridge graduate Alexander Armstrong in 1992, at the TBA Sketch Comedy Group, a comedy club which ran at the Gate Theatre Studio, Notting Hill throughout the 1990s. They performed their first full-length show together at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1994 and returned in 1996, when they were nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award.

Their success resulted in the commission of the television series &quot;Armstrong and Miller&quot;, which ran for four series from 1997 to 2001 – one on the Paramount Comedy Channel and three on Channel 4. In 1998, the duo also had their own radio show with the same name on BBC Radio 4, which featured many of the sketches and characters from their TV series. After a six-year break, the show was recommissioned for Hat Trick Productions as &quot;The Armstrong &amp; Miller Show&quot; and three series have been produced. In 2008, they also had a second radio show, &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour with Armstrong and Miller&quot;.

Miller also started acting in films, starring in Steve Coogan&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;The Parole Officer&quot; (2001). In 2003 he played the role of Bough, sidekick to Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s title character, in the film &quot;Johnny English&quot;. In 2004 he co-starred in the romantic comedy &quot;The Prince and Me&quot;.

In 2004 and 2005, he starred in two series of the BBC television series &quot;The Worst Week of My Life,&quot; with Sarah Alexander. In 2006 he took part in a three-part Christmas special, &quot;The Worst Christmas of My Life&quot;. He starred as James Peregrine Lester in ITV&#x27;s 2007 sci-fi drama &quot;Primeval&quot; and as children’s dance instructor Mr Jonathan in the Australian mockumentary film &quot;Razzle Dazzle: A Journey into Dance&quot;.

He and Alexander Armstrong formed a production company named Toff Media in 2007. The company was dissolved in 2023.

Miller provided the voice for the ITV Digital and later PG Tips Monkey in a popular series of television advertisements featuring Johnny Vegas. In 2008, he appeared as television producer Jonathan Pope in Tony Jordan&#x27;s series &quot;Moving Wallpaper&quot; on ITV1 and starred in &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;. 

In 2009, Miller appeared with Rob Brydon in an episode of &quot;QI&quot; (Series 6. 9). The two have often been mistaken for each other, and as a joke they dressed in similar shirts for the episode and shared an on-screen kiss.

In 2010, he made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Huge&quot;.

In January 2011 he presented an episode of the BBC science series &quot;Horizon&quot; titled &quot;What is One Degree?&quot;. Later in 2011 he reprised his role as James Lester in the TV series &quot;Primeval&quot;. From November 2011 he played the role of Louis Harvey in &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; at the Gielgud Theatre.

On 23 July 2012, Miller began touring for his book, &quot;It&#x27;s Not Rocket Science,&quot; from the Royal Society in London. He also appeared at the British Comedy Awards with Armstrong on Channel 4. In 2013, Miller took part in an episode of &quot;Room 101&quot; and a &quot;Comic Relief&quot; special of game show &quot;Pointless&quot;. On 13 December 2014, he appeared in a Christmas edition of &quot;The Celebrity Chase&quot;.

From 2011 until the series three premiere in 2014, Miller starred in the BBC-French co-produced series &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; as Detective Inspector (DI) Richard Poole. A third series of &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; was commissioned for early 2014. On 9 April 2013 it was announced that Miller would be departing the series, to be replaced by actor Kris Marshall. Filming began in March 2013, and Miller left in May after completion of the first episode, in which his character was murdered. Miller reprised his role for a cameo appearance in a dream sequence during the tenth series in 2021.

Miller explained he had personal reasons for the change: &quot;It was the job of a lifetime, but logistically I just didn&#x27;t feel I could continue. My personal circumstances just made it too complicated, but I will miss it like a lung. I love it here.&quot; Miller&#x27;s wife had discovered she was pregnant after he had begun filming the first series. Their time apart caused strains on his relationship with her and their sons, so he wanted to spend more time with his family.

In 2014, Miller appeared in the feature film &quot;Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism&quot;. He also appeared with Billy Connolly and David Tennant in the film &quot;What We Did on Our Holiday&quot;. Miller guest starred in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as the Sheriff of Nottingham in the third episode: &quot;Robot of Sherwood&quot;.

Starring opposite Nancy Carroll and Diana Vickers, Miller played Robert Houston in the play &quot;The Duck House&quot; by Dan Patterson and Colin Swash. The show is a political satire based on the UK parliamentary expenses scandal.

In 2015, following the 800th anniversary of the &quot;Magna Carta&quot;, Miller starred as King John in Series 6 of &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;.

Since October 2015, Miller along with Ruth Jones and Will Close, appears in adverts for British supermarket Tesco as Roger with Jones as his wife Jo and Close as their son Freddie. In 2016, Miller co-presented the ITV entertainment series &quot;It&#x27;s Not Rocket Science&quot; alongside Rachel Riley and Romesh Ranganathan.

In February 2016 Miller issued a book, accompanied by a lecture tour, entitled &quot;The Aliens are Coming!&quot;, examining the question &quot;are we alone in the universe?&quot; That year, Miller played the role of Murray in the six-part BBC sitcom &quot;I Want My Wife Back&quot;, starring alongside Caroline Catz. In 2016 he appeared in the Channel 4 comedy &quot;Power Monkeys&quot;.

In 2018 he returned to the role of &#x27;Bough&#x27;, sidekick again to Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s title character, in the film &quot;Johnny English Strikes Again&quot;. In September of that same year he played the role of Wolf Hall on the BBC sitcom &quot;Upstart Crow&quot;.

In November 2022, Miller released his seventh children&#x27;s book &quot;Secrets of a Christmas Elf&quot;. In 2024, Miller acted as children&#x27;s author Jullian Hartswood in the comedy drama &quot;Austin&quot; for Australian television network ABC TV, and produced by Northern Pictures and Lincoln Pictures.

==Personal life==
Miller dated actress Rachel Weisz while they were both studying at Cambridge University during the early 1990s. He married actress Belinda Stewart-Wilson in 2004, and they had a son before divorcing in 2011. He married production executive Jessica Parker, the daughter of musician Alan Parker, in September 2013; they have a son and daughter.

He has been diagnosed with OCD. 

Despite reports to the contrary, in an interview with Roman Kemp on BBC Radio 5 Live in December 2024, Miller said he could not play the drums and did not know where this claim came from.

==Awards==
Miller was awarded a Judges&#x27; Commendation for his portrayal of Hamlet at the 1990 National Student Drama Festival. He co-wrote &quot;MindGym&quot;, winner of the first BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Award for comedy in 1998, with Tim Wright and Adam Gee. He and Armstrong won a BCA Award for &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show.&quot; In 2010 they also won a BAFTA for &quot;The Armstrong and Miller Show.&quot;

In 2021, with the cast of &quot;Bridgerton&quot;, Miller received a nomination for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series.

<text>SAS &quot;Mendi&quot; (F148) is the last of four s built for the South African Navy by the European South African Corvette Consortium and entered service in March 2007. SAS &quot;Mendi&quot; was named by Mrs Helena Retief, wife of the (then) Chief of the Navy Vice Admiral Johan Retief.

==Construction==
&quot;Mendi&quot;, as with all the Valour-class vessels, was manufactured by the European South African Corvette Consortium (ESACC), consisting of the German Frigate Consortium (Blohm+Voss, Thyssen Rheinstahl and Howaldtswerke Deutsche Werf), African Defence Systems (part of the French Thales defence group) and a number of South African companies.

The ships were built to the MEKO modular design concept, and are designated by the manufacturer as the MEKO A-200SAN class. Some controversy exists as to the class type of the vessel, with both the manufacturer and the South African Navy referring to her as a &quot;corvette&quot;, but other similar vessels in other navies being referred to as frigates.

SAS &quot;Mendi&quot; was built at the Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft shipyards in Kiel, Germany, and arrived in South Africa on 20 September 2004.

==Status==
According to a presentation made to the Joint Standing Committee on Defence by Rear Admiral B.K. Mhlana, Deputy Chief of the Navy in May 2023, &quot;Mendi&quot; had been scheduled for refits in both 2013 and 2019 but no work had been done to date. Her mid-life update was scheduled for 2024. The admiral described the frigate as the only vessel of the class still effectively operational.

==Namesake==
As with all the other ships of the Valour class, &quot;Mendi&quot; is named after a famous South African battle or instance of great valour. In this case the sinking of SS &quot;Mendi&quot; in the English Channel during World War I. On the 23 August 2004, en route from the shipyards to South Africa, SAS &quot;Mendi&quot; and , a Type 42 destroyer, met at the site where sank and lay wreaths in remembrance of those who died in service for their country

==Notable deployments==
*A deployment to Brazil and Ghana from Aug to Sep 2007
*Operation Boniso 2004
*Operational Sea Training Phase training with the German Navy
*Exercising with the off Cape Point
*Conducted Exocet MM 40 missile firings with in 2007
*Exercise Red Lion
*Exercised with off Cape Town
*On 5 September 2008 &quot;Mendi&quot; led seven of the South African Navy&#x27;s newest vessels in a Presidential Fleet Review, the first to be held in South Africa since the 75th anniversary of the Navy in 1997.
*Since 2011, SAS &quot;Mendi&quot; has intermittently been deployed on anti-piracy operations in the Mozambique Channel as part of Operation Copper. All four Valour-class frigates, SAS &quot;Drakensberg&quot;, and two of the SAN&#x27;s offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) have intermittently spent time on station since the operation began.
==Repair and return to operational status==

As of 2021 SAS &quot;Mendi&quot; was reported to be in reasonable shape and was being brought back to operational status through a staged maintenance and repair program. However, it was also reported that there still remained: &quot;much work ahead. As long dormant systems are used again, small kinks and issues will show and must be ironed out”.

In February 2023, &quot;Mendi&quot; participated in joint South African-Russian-Chinese exercises (exercise Mosi II) which involved the frigate &quot;Admiral Gorshkov&quot; and tanker &quot;Kama&quot; from the Russian Navy along with the destroyer &quot;Huainan&quot;, the frigate &quot;Rizhao&quot; and the support ship &quot;Kekexilihu&quot; from the Chinese Navy, as well as other smaller units from the South African Navy.

<text>Tartuffe, or The Impostor, or The Hypocrite (; , ), first performed in 1664, is a theatrical comedy (or more specifically, a farce) by Molière. The characters of Tartuffe, Elmire, and Orgon are considered among the greatest classical theatre roles.

==History==
Molière performed his first version of &quot;Tartuffe&quot; in 1664. Almost immediately following its performance that same year at Versailles&#x27; grand fêtes (The Party of the Delights of the Enchanted Island/&quot;Les fêtes des plaisirs de l&#x27;ile enchantée&quot;), King Louis XIV suppressed it, probably under the influence of the archbishop of Paris, Paul Philippe Hardouin de Beaumont de Péréfixe, the King&#x27;s confessor and former tutor. While the king had little personal interest in suppressing the play, he did so because, as stated in the official account of the fête:

although it was found to be extremely diverting, the king recognized so much conformity between those that a true devotion leads on the path to heaven and those that a vain ostentation of some good works does not prevent from committing some bad ones, that his extreme delicacy to religious matters can not suffer this resemblance of vice to virtue, which could be mistaken for each other; although one does not doubt the good intentions of the author, even so he forbids it in public, and deprived himself of this pleasure, in order not to allow it to be abused by others, less capable of making a just discernment of it.

As a result of Molière&#x27;s play, contemporary French and English both use the word &quot;tartuffe&quot; to designate a hypocrite who ostensibly and exaggeratedly feigns virtue, especially religious virtue. The play is written entirely in twelve-syllable lines (alexandrines) of rhyming couplets—1,962 lines total.

==Characters==
==Plot==
Orgon&#x27;s family is up in arms because Orgon and his mother have fallen under the influence of Tartuffe, a pious fraud (and a vagrant prior to Orgon&#x27;s help). Tartuffe pretends to be pious and to speak with divine authority, and Orgon and his mother no longer take any action without first consulting him.

Tartuffe&#x27;s antics do not fool the rest of the family or their friends; they detest him. Orgon raises the stakes when he announces that Tartuffe will marry Orgon&#x27;s daughter Mariane (who is already engaged to Valère). Mariane becomes very upset at this news, and the rest of the family realizes how deeply Tartuffe has embedded himself into the family.

In an effort to show Orgon how awful Tartuffe really is, the family devises a scheme to trap Tartuffe into confessing to Elmire (Orgon&#x27;s wife) his desire for her. As a pious man and a guest, he should have no such feelings for the lady of the house, and the family hopes that after such a confession, Orgon will throw Tartuffe out of the house. Indeed, Tartuffe does try to seduce Elmire, but their interview is interrupted when Orgon&#x27;s son Damis, who has been eavesdropping, is no longer able to control his boiling indignation and jumps out of his hiding place to denounce Tartuffe.

Tartuffe is at first shocked but recovers very well. When Orgon enters the room and Damis triumphantly tells him what happened, Tartuffe uses reverse psychology and accuses himself of being the worst sinner:

&lt;poem&gt;

Yes, my brother, I am wicked, guilty.
A miserable sinner just full of iniquity.&lt;/poem&gt;

Orgon is convinced that Damis was lying and banishes him from the house. Tartuffe even convinces Orgon to order that, to teach Damis a lesson, Tartuffe should be around Elmire more than ever. As a gift to Tartuffe and further punishment to Damis and the rest of his family, Orgon signs over all his worldly possessions to Tartuffe.

In a later scene, Elmire challenges Orgon to be witness to a meeting between her and Tartuffe. Orgon, ever easily convinced, decides to hide under a table in the same room, confident that Elmire is wrong. He overhears Elmire resisting Tartuffe&#x27;s very forward advances. When Tartuffe has incriminated himself definitively and is dangerously close to violating Elmire, Orgon comes out from under the table and orders Tartuffe out of his house. The wily guest means to stay, and Tartuffe finally shows his hand. It turns out that earlier, before the events of the play, Orgon had admitted to Tartuffe that he had possession of a box of incriminating letters (written by a friend, not by him). Tartuffe had taken charge and possession of this box, and now tells Orgon that he (Orgon) will be the one to leave. Tartuffe takes his temporary leave. Orgon&#x27;s family tries to decide what to do. Very soon, Monsieur Loyal shows up with a message from Tartuffe and the court itself; they must exit the house because it now belongs to Tartuffe. Dorine makes fun of Monsieur Loyal&#x27;s name, mocking his fake loyalty. Even Madame Pernelle, who had refused to believe any ill about Tartuffe even in the face of her son&#x27;s actually witnessing it, has become convinced of Tartuffe&#x27;s duplicity.

No sooner does Monsieur Loyal leave than Valère rushes in with the news that Tartuffe has denounced Orgon for aiding and assisting a traitor by keeping the incriminating letters and that Orgon is about to be arrested. Before Orgon can flee, Tartuffe arrives with an officer, but to his surprise, the officer arrests him instead. The officer explains that the enlightened King Louis XIV—who is not mentioned by name—has heard of the injustices happening in the house and, appalled by Tartuffe&#x27;s treachery towards Orgon, has ordered Tartuffe&#x27;s arrest instead. 

It is revealed that Tartuffe has a long criminal history and has often changed his name to avoid being caught. As a reward for Orgon&#x27;s previous good services, the king not only forgives him for keeping the letters but also invalidates the deed that gave Tartuffe possession of Orgon&#x27;s house and possessions. The entire family is thankful that it has escaped the mortification of both Orgon&#x27;s potential disgrace and their dispossession.

The drama ends well, and Orgon announces the upcoming wedding of Valère and Mariane. The surprise twist ending, in which everything is set right by the unexpected benevolent intervention of the heretofore unseen king, is considered a notable modern-day example of the classical theatrical plot device &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.

==Controversy==
Though &quot;Tartuffe&quot; was received well by the public and even by Louis XIV, it immediately sparked conflict amongst many different groups who were offended by the play&#x27;s portrayal of someone who was outwardly pious but fundamentally mercenary, lecherous, and deceitful; and who uses their profession of piety to prey on others. The factions opposed to Molière&#x27;s work included part of the hierarchy of the French Roman Catholic Church, members of upper-class French society, and the illegal underground organization called the Compagnie du Saint-Sacrement. &quot;Tartuffe&quot;″s popularity was cut short when the archbishop of Paris Péréfixe issued an edict threatening excommunication for anyone who watched, performed in, or read the play. Molière attempted to assuage church officials by rewriting his play to seem more secular and less critical of religion, but the archbishop and other leading officials would not budge. The revised, second version of the play was called &quot;L&#x27;Imposteur&quot; and had a main character named Panulphe instead of Tartuffe, the only performance of which occurred in the Palais-Royal theatre on 5 August 1667. Immediately the following day, on 6 August, as the king was away from Paris, Guillaume de Lamoignon, first president of the Paris Parlement, censored public performances. 

Even throughout Molière&#x27;s conflict with the church, Louis XIV continued to support the playwright; it is possible that without the King&#x27;s support, Molière might have been excommunicated. Although public performances of the play were banned, private performances for the French aristocracy did occur. In 1669, after Molière&#x27;s detractors lost much of their influence, he was finally allowed to perform the final version of his play. However, due to all the controversy surrounding &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, Molière mostly refrained from writing such incisive plays as this one again.

An ally of Molière (believed by Robert McBride to be François de La Mothe Le Vayer, but a hotly-debated point) responded to criticism of &quot;Tartuffe&quot; in 1667 with a &quot;Lettre sur la comédie de l&#x27;Imposteur&quot;. The anonymous author sought to defend the play to the public by describing the plot in detail and then rebutting two common arguments made for why the play was banned. The first being that theatrical works should not discuss religion at all; the second being that Tartuffe&#x27;s actions on stage, followed by his pious speech, would make the audience think that they were to act as Tartuffe did. This section of letter contradicts the latter by describing how Tartuffe&#x27;s actions are worthy of ridicule, in essence comic, and therefore by no means an endorsement.


Centuries later, when the satirical anticlerical magazine &quot;La Calotte&quot; started publication in 1906, its first editorial asserted that &quot;Laughter is the only weapon feared by the soldiers of Tartuffe&quot;; the new magazine proposed to effectively deploy that weapon, with articles and cartoons mercilessly lampooning the Catholic Church and its clergy.

==Production history==
The original version of the play was in three acts and was first staged on 12 May 1664 at the Palace of Versailles&#x27; Cour de Marbre as part of festivities known as &quot;Les Plaisirs de l&#x27;île enchantée&quot;. Because of the attacks on the play and the ban that was placed on it, this version was never published, and no text has survived, giving rise to much speculation as to whether it was a work in progress or a finished piece. Many writers believe it consisted of the first three acts of the final version, while John Cairncross has proposed that acts 1, 3, and 4 were performed. Although the original version could not be played publicly, it could be given privately, and it was seen on 25 September 1664 in Villers-Cotterêts, for Louis&#x27; brother Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, aka &quot;Monsieur&quot; and 29 November 1664 at the Château du Raincy, for the veteran of the Fronde, Armand de Bourbon, Prince of Conti.

The second version, &quot;L&#x27;Imposteur&quot;, was in five acts and performed only once, on 5 August 1667 in the Théâtre du Palais-Royal. On 11 August, before any additional performances, the Archbishop of Paris Péréfixe banned this version also. The largely-final, revised third version in five acts, under the title &quot;Tartuffe, ou L&#x27;Imposteur&quot;, appeared on 5 February 1669 at the Palais-Royal theatre and was highly successful. This version was published and is the one that is generally performed today.

===Modern productions===
Since Molière&#x27;s time, &quot;Tartuffe&quot; has stayed on the repertoire of the Comédie-Française, where it is its most performed play.

The Russian theatre practitioner Constantin Stanislavski was working on a production of &quot;Tartuffe&quot; when he died in 1938. It was completed by Mikhail Kedrov and opened on 4 December 1939.

The first Broadway production took place at the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in New York and ran from 14 January 1965 to 22 May 1965. The cast included Michael O&#x27;Sullivan as Tartuffe, Sada Thompson as Dorine, Salome Jens as Elmire, Hal Holbrook as M. Loyal, John Phillip Law as King&#x27;s Officer, Laurence Luckinbill as Damis and Tony Lo Bianco as Sergeant.

The National Theatre Company performed a production in 1967 using the Richard Wilbur translation and featuring John Gielgud as Orgon, Robert Stephens as Tartuffe, Jeremy Brett as Valere, Derek Jacobi as The Officer and Joan Plowright as Dorine.

A production of Richard Wilbur&#x27;s translation of the play opened at the Circle in the Square Theatre in 1977, with John Wood as Tartuffe, and co-starring Tammy Grimes as Elmire, Stefan Gierasch as Orgon, Ray Wise as Damis, Swoosie Kurtz as Mariane and Patricia Elliott as Dorine.

A Royal Shakespeare Company production using the Christopher Hampton translation and directed by Bill Alexander was performed at The Pit Theatre in London in 1983. The production included Antony Sher as Tartuffe, Nigel Hawthorne as Orgon, Mark Rylance as Damis, Alison Steadman as Elmire, Stephanie Fayerman as Dorine and David Bradley as Cleante.

Charles Randolph-Wright staged a production of Tartuffe, July 1999, at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, which was set among affluent African Americans of Durham, North Carolina, in the 1950s.

A translation by Ranjit Bolt was staged at London&#x27;s Playhouse Theatre in 1991 with Abigail Cruttenden, Paul Eddington, Jamie Glover, Felicity Kendal, Nicholas Le Prevost, John Sessions and Toby Stephens. Bolt&#x27;s translation was later staged at London&#x27;s National Theatre in 2002 with Margaret Tyzack as Madame Pernelle, Martin Clunes as Tartuffe, Clare Holman as Elmire, Julian Wadham as Cleante and David Threlfall as Orgon.

David Ball adapted &quot;Tartuffe&quot; for the Theatre de la Jeune Lune in 2006 and Dominique Serrand revived this production in 2015 in a coproduction with Berkeley Repertory Theatre, South Coast Repertory and the Shakespeare Theatre Company.

Liverpudlian poet Roger McGough&#x27;s translation premièred at the Liverpool Playhouse in May 2008 and transferred subsequently to the Rose Theatre, Kingston.

The Royal Shakespeare Company produced a new version by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto which relocated the story to the modern-day Pakistani-Muslim community of Sparkhill, Birmingham. It premiered at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon in September 2018 before transferring to Birmingham Repertory Theatre in October 2022.

In 2021, Singapore theatre company W!ld Rice commissioned a new version by Singaporean playwright Joel Tan, which premiered in 2022. Tan&#x27;s version adds a new plot twist: Valère&#x27;s engagement to Mariane is a lavender marriage to cover up his torrid affair with Damis and her desire to become an independent woman.

In 2022, a feminist reimagining written by Flora Davies and Siân Lawrence was presented at Oxford&#x27;s BT Studio by Green Sun Productions to great acclaim. This adaptation sets the action within a fictional feminist consultancy firm; Orgon and Elmire become Co-CEOs and Tartuffe a new hire in the office. The production transferred to the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2023.

==Adaptations==

===Film===
* The film &quot;Herr Tartüff&quot; was produced by Ufa in 1926. It was directed by F. W. Murnau and starred Emil Jannings as Tartuffe, Lil Dagover as Elmire and Werner Krauss as Orgon.
* Gérard Depardieu directed and starred in the title role of &quot;Le tartuffe&quot;, the 1984 French film version.
* The 2007 French film &quot;Molière&quot; contains many references, both direct and indirect, to &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, the most notable of which is that the character of Molière masquerades as a priest and calls himself &quot;Tartuffe&quot;. The end of the film implies that Molière went on to write &quot;Tartuffe&quot; based on his experiences in the film.

*The National Theatre, England, adapted this for stage in 1967 at The Old Vic Theatre, London. Translated by Richard Wilbur, directed by Tyrone Guthrie and ran for 39 performances, closing in 1969.
*&quot;Tartuffe in Texas&quot; is set in Dallas, Texas; published in 2012 by Eldridge Publishing.
*Bell Shakespeare Company, &quot;Tartuffe - The Hypocrite&quot; translated from original French by Justin Fleming in 2014 and earlier for Melbourne Theatre Company in 2008, with uniquely varied rhyming verse forms.
*American Stage Theatre Company in St. Petersburg, Florida, adapted Tartuffe in 2016, staged in modern-day as a political satire, with Orgon, as a wealthy American businessman who entrusts his reputation and his fortune to up-and-coming politician, Tartuffe.
*It was adapted for an Australian audience in the &quot;post-truth&quot; age by playwright Philip Kavanagh, performed by the State Theatre Company of South Australia and Brink Productions, October–November 2016 in Adelaide.
*An adaptation in English rhyming couplets set in London in 2017 by Andrew Hilton and Dominic Power, premiered by Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory and Tobacco Factory Theatres in Bristol, April–May 2017. Tartuffe a bogus business guru preying on old-school Tory politician in mid-life crisis.
*In 2022, a feminist reimagining written by Flora Davies and Siân Lawrence was presented at Oxford&#x27;s BT Studio by Green Sun Productions to great acclaim. This adaptation sets the action within a fictional feminist consultancy firm; Orgon and Elmire become Co-CEOs and Tartuffe a new hire in the office. The production transferred to the Edinburgh Fringe in August 2023.

===Television===
* Productions for French television were filmed in 1971, 1975, 1980, 1983 and 1998.
* On 28 November 1971, the BBC broadcast as part of their &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series a production directed by Basil Coleman using the Richard Wilbur translation and featuring Michael Hordern as Tartuffe, Mary Morris as Madame Pernelle and Patricia Routledge as Dorine.
* Donald Moffat starred in a 1978 videotaped PBS television production with Stefan Gierasch as Orgon, Tammy Grimes as Elmire, Ray Wise as Damis, Victor Garber as Valère and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Madame Pernelle. The translation was by Richard Wilbur and the production was directed by Kirk Browning. Taped in a television studio without an audience, this production was based on at the 1977 Circle in the Square Theatre production (see &quot;Modern Productions&quot; above), but with a slightly different cast – John Wood played Tartuffe in the Broadway version, and Madame Pernelle was played by Mildred Dunnock in that same production.
* The BBC adapted the Bill Alexander production for the Royal Shakespeare Company. This television version was first screened in the UK during November 1985 in the &quot;Theatre Night&quot; series with most of the original cast, including Antony Sher, Nigel Hawthorne, Stephanie Fayerman and Alison Steadman, reprising their stage roles (see &quot;Modern Productions&quot; above) (Lesley Sharp replaced Katy Behean as Mariane and Michael Maloney replaced Mark Rylance as Damis). While this television version does derive from the RSC&#x27;s 1983 stage production, IMDb is inaccurate in dating this videotaped version from that year. The BFI Film &amp; TV Database indicates the start date for this programme&#x27;s production was in 1984, while the copyright date is for 1985.
*The 2022 Birmingham Repertory Theatre version by Anil Gupta and Richard Pinto was broadcast on BBC Four on 12 March 2023. The production relocated the story to the modern-day Pakistani-Muslim community of Sparkhill, Birmingham and had previously been produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 2018. 

===Opera===
* The composer Kirke Mechem based his opera &quot;Tartuffe&quot; on the play.

===Audio===
* On 10 December 1939, an hour-long adaptation was broadcast on the NBC radio series &quot;Great Plays&quot;.
* In 1968, Caedmon Records recorded and released on LP (TRS 332) a production performed that same year by the Stratford National Theatre of Canada as part of the Stratford Festival (see &quot;Stratford Shakespeare Festival production history&quot;) using the Richard Wilbur translation and directed by Jean Gascon. The cast included Douglas Rain as Orgon and William Hutt as Tartuffe.
* In 2009, BBC Radio 3 broadcast an adaptation directed by Gemma Bodinetz and translated by Roger McGough, based on the 2008 Liverpool Playhouse production (see &quot;Modern Productions&quot; above), with John Ramm as Tartuffe, Joseph Alessi as Orgon, Simon Coates as Cleante, Annabelle Dowler as Dorine, Rebecca Lacey as Elmire, Robert Hastie as Damis and Emily Pithon as Marianne.
* L.A. Theatre Works performed and recorded a production in 2010 () with the Richard Wilbur translation and featuring Brian Bedford as Tartuffe, Martin Jarvis as Orgon, Alex Kingston as Elmire, Matthew Rhys as Valere, Gia Carides as Dorine, and John de Lancie as Cleante. The production was directed by Dakin Matthews.
* In 2022, for Moliere&#x27;s 400th Anniversary, a modern English adaptation is released, starring David Serero as Tartuffe.

<text>Jay Sarno (July 2, 1922 – July 21, 1984) was an American developer, hotelier, and casino owner. He developed and owned the Atlanta Cabana Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, as well as several motels in California and Texas. He was the founder of the Caesars Palace and Circus Circus hotels in Las Vegas.

==Early life==
Sarno was born in 1922 in St. Joseph, Missouri. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland. His father was a cabinet maker, his mother a homemaker.

Sarno graduated from the University of Missouri, with a degree in business. While in college, he met Stanley Mallin, who would become his lifelong friend and business partner. 

During World War II, he served in the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations alongside Mallin.
==Career==
With Stanley Mallin, Sarno became a tile contractor in Miami, Florida. They subsequently built subsidized housing in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1958, after they had met Jimmy Hoffa and Allen Dorfman, they built the Atlanta Cabana Motel with a loan from the Central States Pension Fund. They went on to build Cabanas in Palo Alto, California and another motel in Dallas.

Sarno developed the Caesars Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. It was inaugurated on August 5, 1966.

Sarno later built Circus Circus. The attraction featured a circus tent with daily acts and Sarno would dress up as a ringmaster and attend to families and children personally. Sarno subsequently leased it to Bill Pennington and Bill Bennett, a Del Webb executive, and they purchased it in 1983.

Sarno planned to develop Grandissimo, a hotel and casino with 6,000 rooms. However, the project was shelved when Sarno died.

==Personal life==
Sarno married Joyce Sarno Keys but they later divorced. They had four children.

==Death and legacy==
Sarno died of a heart attack on July 21, 1984 at the age of 62, at Caesars Palace.

Sarno was posthumously elected to the Gaming Hall of Fame in 1989. He received, also posthumously, the inaugural Sarno Award for Casino Design from the Global Gaming Expo in 2003.

<text>Live at Hammersmith Odeon is a 1994 live album by the British singer Kate Bush. It is a re-release of an abridged video recording of the 1979 The Tour of Life, first released on home video in 1981, complete with a CD version of the video soundtrack. 

The video and CD contain twelve songs recorded live at the Hammersmith Odeon on 13 May 1979, consisting mainly of songs from &quot;The Kick Inside&quot; and &quot;Lionheart&quot; with a new song &quot;Violin&quot;; which would subsequently appear on Bush&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Never for Ever&quot; in 1980.

In September 1979, Bush released &quot;On Stage,&quot; an EP of four tracks recorded ostensibly at the same concert.

<text>Sarah Alexander (&quot;née&quot; Smith; 3 January 1971) is an English actress. She has appeared in British series including &quot;Armstrong and Miller&quot;, &quot;Smack the Pony&quot;, &quot;Coupling&quot;, &quot;The Worst Week of My Life&quot;, &quot;Green Wing&quot;, &quot;Marley&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; and &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot;.

==Early life==
Alexander was born on 3 January 1971 in Hammersmith, London. Her father, Frank Smith, was a television producer and director on factual shows such as &quot;Panorama&quot;; he died when she was still at school. She attended Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith. At the age of 19, she left home after her A-levels and travelled to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe to get a start in acting. Her parents wanted her to continue to university, but she turned down a place at the University of Manchester to take her first professional acting job.

==Career==
In 1992, Alexander appeared in &quot;The Bill&quot;, as a witness to an attempted robbery. The following year she played Muriel in an episode of the BBC comedy-drama &quot;Lovejoy&quot;. In 1994, she played Nicky, Damien&#x27;s risk-addicted weather reporter girlfriend in &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot;. In 1996, she played Beatrice in the British première of Octavio Paz&#x27;s only play, &quot;Rappaccini&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, at the Gate Theatre Studio. She has appeared in other theatre productions, including &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;, &quot;The Secretary Bird&quot;, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, and as Lady Macbeth in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. In the mid-1990s, she met Ben Miller when they filmed an advertisement for disposable cameras together, and through him she met Alexander Armstrong. Miller and Armstrong became friends and collaborators, and Alexander went on to appear on their Channel 4 sketch show &quot;Armstrong and Miller&quot; (1997–2001), usually in the regular &quot;Nude Practice&quot; segment.

Alexander moved into comedy acting, in which she has since specialised. Her other sketch show work included &quot;Smith and Jones&quot; (1997–1998) and &quot;Smack the Pony&quot; (1999–2003), also writing for the latter. In the science-fiction comedy series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, she played the Queen of Camelot in &quot;Stoke Me a Clipper&quot;. She appeared in the &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; episode &quot;The Garden of Death&quot;, as Fliss Inkpen-Thomas. In 2000, she appeared in the comedy &quot;The Strangerers&quot;, as well as becoming co-host of the final series of the current-affairs satire &quot;The 11 O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;, alongside Jon Holmes. She made her debut as Susan Walker in the BBC sitcom &quot;Coupling&quot;, which ran for four series from 2000 to 2004. Other British TV roles included Mel in &quot;The Worst Week of My Life&quot; and Angela Hunter in the hospital comedy &quot;Green Wing&quot;.

Alexander appeared as Alice Fletcher in NBC&#x27;s short-lived remake of the British comedy series &quot;Teachers&quot;, before roles in the films &quot;I Could Never Be Your Woman&quot; and &quot;Stardust&quot; (both released in 2007). Her previous film credits include &quot;Seaview Knights&quot; (1994) and &quot;Going Off Big Time&quot; (2000). She also starred in the 2008 BBC dramedy &quot;Mutual Friends&quot;, and played Layla Barton in the BBC drama &quot;All The Small Things&quot;, which debuted in 2009.

Since 2011, she has played Mimi in the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;The Gobetweenies&quot;. The first series was broadcast in 2011 and two more followed in 2012 and 2013. She starred in the 2012 BBC series &quot;Me and Mrs Jones&quot;. Since 2013, she has starred in the BBC One series &quot;Jonathan Creek&quot; as Polly Creek, wife of main character Jonathan, making her first appearance in the episode titled &quot;The Clue of the Savant&#x27;s Thumb&quot; in 2013. She starred in the Dave comedy &quot;Undercover&quot; as DS Zoe Keller. From 2015 she has starred in the comedy series &quot;Marley&#x27;s Ghosts&quot; on Gold. In 2019, Alexander appeared as Undine Thwaite in the Epix series &quot;Pennyworth&quot;.

==Other work==
Alexander has contributed to the BBC charity telethon &quot;Comic Relief&quot;, appearing in 2001 as a judge based on Nicki Chapman in a parody of &quot;Popstars&quot;, in 2003 as Liza Goddard in a spoof of &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;, and, in 2005, in a celebrity version of &quot;University Challenge&quot;. Since 2021, she has contributed to Mark Steel&#x27;s podcast &quot;What the F*** Is Going On?&quot;, appearing in sketches as &quot;woman overheard in cafe&quot;, &quot;tory MP Nadine Boris&quot;, and &quot;phone-in show caller&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 2001, at the age of 30, Alexander began a relationship with 70-year-old actor Gerald Harper. The following year, she left him for actor Peter Serafinowicz, whom she later married. They live in West London, and have a son and daughter together. She appeared in both series of &quot;Look Around You&quot;, which Serafinowicz co-created and starred in, as well as &quot;O!News&quot;, his parody of &quot;E! News&quot;.

<doc id="1167905" wikidata="Q705339" url="?curid=1167905" title="Tortoise heavy assault tank">
<text>The Tortoise heavy assault tank (A39) was a British heavy assault gun tank design developed during the Second World War, but never put into mass production. It was developed for the task of clearing heavily fortified areas such as the Siegfried Line and as a result favoured armour protection over mobility.

Although heavy, at 78 tons, and not readily transported, it was considered reliable and a good gun platform.

Only a few prototypes of the Tortoise had been produced by the end of the war. After testing was complete, one was retained for preservation and the others disposed of.

==Development==
In the early part of 1943, the Allied forces anticipated considerable resistance in the projected future invasion of Europe, with the enemy fighting from heavily fortified positions such as the Siegfried Line. As a result, a new class of vehicles emerged, in the shape of assault tanks, which placed maximum armour protection at a higher priority than mobility. Initially, work was concentrated on the Excelsior tank (A33), based on the Cromwell tank. There was also a programme to upgrade the armour of the Churchill tank. For similar work in the Far East, the Valiant tank (A38), based on the Valentine tank was considered, although weight was specified to be as low as possible.

The Secretary of State for War (James Grigg) and the Minister of Supply (Andrew Duncan) issued a Joint Memorandum in April 1943 that gave a vague specification for an assault tank, classing it as a special purpose vehicle to operate in heavily defended areas as part of the specialist 79th Armoured Division.

The Nuffield Organization responded with 18 separate designs (AT1 through AT18) drafted between May 1943 and February 1944, each design larger and heavier than the last. By February 1944, design AT16 was complete and was approved by the Tank Board, who proposed that month that 25 should be produced directly from the mockup stage without bothering with a prototype, to be available for operational service in September 1945. An order for 25 was placed by the War Office and work was begun.

Following the end of the war the order was reduced and only six vehicles were built. One example was sent to Germany for trials, where it was found to be mechanically reliable and a powerful and accurate gun platform. However, at a weight of 80 tons and a height of it was extremely slow and proved difficult to transport.

==Description==
The primary requirement for an assault tank is armour, to enable the tank to assault a heavily emplaced enemy. This led to Tortoise having very thick armour, arranged as a one piece casemate to avoid the weak spots of a turret design. This differs from the design of other wartime era assault tanks, the Excelsior tank and assault tank T14.

Since the Tortoise had a fixed casemate superstructure instead of a turret, it can be classified as a self-propelled gun or an assault gun and not a tank. The crew included a commander, driver, and gunner, with two loaders for the 32-pounder gun and two machine gunners.

Internally, it was split into three compartments: the transmission to the front, the crew in the centre and the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine at the rear. The suspension consisted of four bogies on each side of the hull. Each bogie had two pairs of wheels, with each pair linked to a transverse torsion bar. The Merritt-Brown transmission was fitted with an all speed reverse, giving approximately the same speed backwards as forwards.

==Armament==
The Ordnance QF 32-pounder gun design was adapted from the British 3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun. The ammunition used a separate charge and shell, the latter a armour piercing shot (APCBC). In tests, the gun was successful against a German Panther tank at nearly .

The 32-pdr gun was mounted in a power-assisted limited traverse mounting; rather than being mounted on the more traditional trunnions, it protruded through a large ball mount in the front of the hull, protected by armour. To the left of it was a Besa machine gun in an armoured ball mount. A further two Besa machine guns were mounted in a turret on the top of the hull to the right.

==Surviving vehicles==

*One of the six prototype Tortoises constructed of mild steel has been preserved at The Tank Museum in Bovington, England. The vehicle is in running condition. A 2011 overhaul saw it running under its own power for the first time since the 1950s. It was shown to the public in June 2011 at &quot;Tankfest 2011&quot;, the Bovington museum&#x27;s annual display of running vehicles.
*A Tortoise, without its gun, lies on the former Kirkcudbright military training area (now a Site of Special Scientific Interest) in Scotland. The location and condition of the vehicle mean that recovery and restoration is unlikely.
*Another Tortoise was used as a target on Lulworth Ranges, Dorset in the early 1970s. By August 1974 it was little more than a metal shell.

<doc id="1167930" wikidata="Q855880" url="?curid=1167930" title="Football tennis">
<text>Football tennis, also known as futnet and soccer tennis (Czech and Slovak: &quot;nohejbal&quot;), is a sport played with a football. The sport is played indoors or outdoors on a court divided by a low net with two opposing teams made up of one, two or three players, who try to score a point by hitting the ball with any part of their body except for the hands and making it bounce in the opponent&#x27;s area in a way that makes it difficult or impossible for the other team to return it over the net.

==History==
In 1922, the members of the football club Slavia Prague started playing a game which they called &#x27;football over the rope&#x27;, because it was initially played over a horizontally suspended rope, which was later replaced by a net. Usually, two or three players on each side could touch the ball three times (though a single player could not touch the ball twice consecutively) with all parts of the body except for the arms. Players could let the ball bounce once between the touches up to three times before passing it to the other side.

In 1940, the first official rules were written. The first futnet cup was played in 1940, and between 1953 and 1961, the first league, called Trampská Liga, was played. In 1961 futnet was recognized as an official sport by Czechoslovak Sports Organisation (ČSTV), and the Prague Futnet Commission was established. In 1971, the &quot;Český nohejbalový svaz&quot; (Czech Futnet Association) was founded, followed in 1974 by the &quot;Výbor nohejbalového zväzu SÚV ČSTV&quot; (Slovak Futnet Association).

Official international competitions have been organized for decades. European championships have been held since 1991 and world championships since 1994.

== Rules ==
There are three futnet disciplines:
*Single: one player, two touches, one bounce in all categories, court dimensions 9 m × 12.8 m.
*Double: two players, three touches (but not two consecutive touches by the same player), one bounce allowed for men and two bounces for women and juniors, court dimensions 9 m × 12.8 m. 
*Triple: three players, three touches (but not two consecutive touches by the same player), one bounce allowed for men and two for women and juniors, court dimensions 9 m × 18 m.

In all the disciplines, a set finishes once a side gains 11 points with a two-point difference between the sides; the maximum score is 15:14. To win a match, a team has to win 2 sets. The height of the net is 1.10 m. The players may not touch the net during the game; otherwise, it is a point for the opponent. The futnet ball is similar to a football in size, but is glued, made of 32 panels of synthetic (natural) leather, and when properly inflated should bounce more than half a meter.

If the ball hits the net and comes back to the side of the team that attempted to hit it over, it cannot be hit back, unlike in volleyball.

== International associations ==
In 1987, the International Footballtennis Association (IFTA, later renamed to FIFTA, the Federation International de Footballtennis Association) was founded. In 2010, Union Internationale de Futnet (UNIF) was founded by some former FIFTA members, later joined by other nations, to govern, regulate and promote the sport of futnet. In December 2012, UNIF had 17 member countries.

In April 2010 European Futnet Association (EFTA) was founded in Marseille, France, to reactivate the sport in Europe where it had been stagnating under FIFTA. Current EFTA members include Switzerland, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Ireland, Basque Country, Denmark, England, Poland, Ukraine and Austria. EFTA is the continental association of UNIF in Europe.

== International name ==
While the term football tennis is still commonly used, the word futnet is being used more as the new international name to reflect the independent nature of this sport which has around 100 years of history and which has its own rules and regulations, governing structures and regular competitions.

<text>Tamsin Morwenna Banks (born 20 September 1961) is a British actress, comedian, writer, and producer. She appeared in the Channel 4 comedy sketch show &quot;Absolutely&quot;, and wrote, produced, and appeared in the British ensemble film &quot;The Announcement&quot;. She voices Mummy Pig, Madame Gazelle and Dr Hamster in the children&#x27;s series &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;. She adapted Nick Hornby&#x27;s novel &quot;Funny Girl&quot; for Sky Max (renamed &quot;Funny Woman&quot; for TV&quot;)&quot; and is a writer on &quot;Slow Horses&quot; for Apple TV+.

==Early life==
Banks attended the private Truro High School for Girls and Robinson College, Cambridge, and was a member of the Cambridge Footlights from 1981 to 1983. She also acted with the Marlowe Society, such as in a brief comic cameo as the Widow in Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, alongside Tilda Swinton.

==Career==
One of Banks&#x27; early major television roles was as part of the team on the comedy sketch show &quot;Absolutely&quot;, broadcast on Channel 4 between 1989 and 1993. Her other television appearances include the BBC series &quot;The Thick of It&quot;, &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, &quot;Ruddy Hell! It&#x27;s Harry and Paul&quot; and the Steve Coogan comedy &quot;Saxondale&quot;, in which she played receptionist Vicky. She also appeared as Anthea Stonem in the E4 Teen drama &quot;Skins&quot; and was a cast member on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, for four episodes of the show&#x27;s twentieth season. She appeared as Carmen Kenaway in the first two episodes of the ninth series of &quot;Shameless&quot;.

Her voice roles include Claire Feeble in &quot;Stressed Eric&quot;; Cleo Lion in Between the Lions; (Nick Jr UK) Mummy Pig and various other characters in &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;; the ship&#x27;s computer in the BBC TV series &quot;Hyperdrive&quot;; Ping Pong in &quot;Rupert Bear&quot;; (Channel 5); and Guinevere in &quot;King Arthur&#x27;s Disasters&quot; (CITV). Banks won Best Voice Performance at the 2014 British Animation Awards for providing the voice for Queen Marigold in &quot;Ben and Holly&#x27;s Little Kingdom&quot; and a voice in &quot;Humf&quot;.

Banks wrote, produced, and appeared in the British ensemble film &quot;The Announcement&quot; in 2001. She also appeared in season one, episode 13 of &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot; as a &quot;rulebearer&quot;. In 2004, she played the central role of Tess in the series &quot;Catterick&quot;, with Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. She also appeared in their shows &quot;The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer&quot;, &quot;Bang, Bang, It&#x27;s Reeves and Mortimer&quot; and &quot;Monkey Trousers&quot;.

Banks had also voiced Sophie in &quot;Crapston Villas&quot;, an adult animated sitcom soap opera, which was produced in the 1990s. Both Banks and the television programme’s creator, Sarah Ann Kennedy, would later go on to voice characters in &quot;Peppa Pig&quot;.

===Since 2009===
In 2009, Banks made a series of web videos for BBC Comedy called &quot;Celebrities STFU&quot;, each video featuring her in costume impersonating Lady Gaga, Noel Gallagher, Susan Boyle, Pixie Lott, Jools Holland, and Duffy.

On 19 October 2013, BBC Radio 4 broadcast Banks&#x27; play &quot;Goodbye&quot; about a woman diagnosed with breast cancer. The play is an account of the path from the first diagnosis to the death of Lizzie, played by Olivia Colman; it deals with her relationships with her family and best friend Jen, played by Natascha McElhone, and their reactions to Jen&#x27;s illness and death. The cast included Darren Boyd, John Simm, Alison Steadman, Banks&#x27; &quot;Peppa Pig&quot; co-star Harley Bird, Banks&#x27; son Ezra, and singing by Banks&#x27; daughter Dolly. It was produced by Heather Larmour. Banks received the 2015 Tinniswood Award for the play. She subsequently wrote the play&#x27;s 2015 film adaptation, titled &quot;Miss You Already&quot;.

From 2012 to 2018, she played Venus Traduces (a parody of Violet Trefusis) and other roles in the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Gloomsbury&quot;.

Banks&#x27; later voice work includes the roles of Betty and Sonia in the 2008 film version of &quot;Tales of the Riverbank&quot;; and a translator at the trial of Adolf Eichmann in &quot;The Eichmann Show&quot;.

In 2016, Banks co-wrote and starred in the comedy series &quot;Damned&quot;. She co-starred in and wrote (with Rebecca Front) &quot;Shush!&quot;, a sitcom set in a library broadcast on BBC Radio Four in 2017. In late 2019, she provided the voice of Mrs Brown in &quot;The Adventures of Paddington&quot; which began airing on Nick Jr. in early 2020.

She adapted Nick Hornby&#x27;s novel &quot;Funny Girl&quot; for a 2023 series which airs on Sky as &quot;Funny Woman,&quot; and is a writer on &quot;Slow Horses&quot; for Apple TV+, which premiered in 2022.

==Awards==
* 2014 British Animation Award for Best Voice Performance in &quot;Ben and Holly&#x27;s Little Kingdom: Nanny&#x27;s Magic Test&quot;
* 2015 Tinniswood Award for the radio play &quot;Goodbye&quot;

== Charity ==
Banks is a patron of the Drama Express charity.

==Personal life==
Banks and fellow comedian David Baddiel have been together since 1998 and have been married since 2017. They have two children, a daughter Dolly (b. 2001), and a son Ezra (b. 2004), both of whom starred in Banks&#x27; play, &quot;Goodbye&quot; and live in North London.

<text>John George Robinson CBE, (30 July 1856 – 7 December 1943) was an English railway engineer, and was chief mechanical engineer of the Great Central Railway from 1900 to 1922.

==Early life==
Born at Newcastle upon Tyne, the second son of Matthew Robinson, a locomotive engineer, and his wife Jane, Robinson was educated at the Chester Grammar School, and in 1872 commenced an engineering apprenticeship with the Great Western Railway at Swindon Works, as a pupil of Joseph Armstrong. In 1878 he became assistant to his father Matthew Robinson at Bristol, and in 1884 joined the Waterford and Limerick Railway (which became the Waterford, Limerick and Western Railway in 1896) as their locomotive, carriage and wagon assistant superintendent. He was promoted to superintendent the following year.

==Great Central Railway==
In 1900 Robinson joined the Great Central Railway as locomotive and marine superintendent and in 1902 was appointed chief mechanical engineer. He remained in that post until 1922, when prior to the Great Central&#x27;s grouping into the London and North Eastern Railway he declined the post of chief mechanical engineer of the LNER, choosing instead to step aside for the younger Nigel Gresley. Robinson was awarded a CBE in 1920.

Robinson&#x27;s first passenger locomotive design for the GCR was Class 11B (LNER Class D9) 4-4-0, of which 40 were built between 1901 and 1904, the last being withdrawn by British Railways in 1950. Robinson followed in 1913 with the larger Class 11E (LNER D10) &quot;Director&quot; Class 4-4-0 locomotive, which was used on GCR express trains from London Marylebone to Sheffield Victoria and Manchester London Road. Ten were built, followed by eleven &quot;Improved Director&quot; (GCR Class 11F, LNER Class D11) locomotives during 1920–1924.

Robinson&#x27;s famous GCR Class 8K 2-8-0 heavy freight locomotive was introduced in 1911 and many more were built for the Railway Operating Division of the Royal Engineers in 1917. Some of these reliable locomotives, of which over 400 were built, remained in service with the LNER and later British Railways until 1966.

==Preserved Robinson locomotives==
Two Robinson-designed locomotives are preserved in the UK:
* 4-4-0 &quot;Improved Director&quot; GCR Class 11F No. 506 &quot;Butler–Henderson&quot; (Later BR No. 62660), which is preserved at the National Railway Museum, York, and currently on display at Barrow Hill Roundhouse, near Chesterfield, Derbyshire
* 2-8-0 GCR Class 8K No. 102 (Later BR No. 63601), also owned by the National Railway Museum is on loan to the Great Central Railway (preserved) at Loughborough. It is currently (2008) operational and used on demonstration goods trains.
Three Robinson-designed locomotives are preserved in Australia
* 2-8-0 ROD ROD 1984 (later J &amp; A Brown No. 20) preserved by the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum
* 2-8-0 ROD ROD 2003 (later J &amp; A Brown No. 24) this loco was actually built by the GCR at Gorton Works and is preserved by the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum
* 2-8-0 ROD ROD 2004 (later J &amp; A Brown No. 23) this loco was actually built by the GCR at Gorton Works and is preserved by the Richmond Vale Railway Museum

<text>John O&#x27;Sullivan, CBE (born 25 April 1942) is a British conservative political commentator and journalist. From 1987 to 1988, he was a senior policy writer and speechwriter in 10 Downing Street for Margaret Thatcher when she was British prime minister and remained close to her up to her death.

O&#x27;Sullivan served as vice president and executive editor of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty from 2008 to 2012. He was editor of the Australian monthly magazine &quot;Quadrant&quot; from 2015 to 2017.

Since 2017, he has been president of the Danube Institute, a Fidesz government-financed think tank based in Budapest, Hungary, and a member of the board of advisors for the Global Panel Foundation, an NGO that works behind the scenes in crisis areas around the world. 

A former editor of &quot;National Review&quot; from 1988 to 1997, O&#x27;Sullivan has been an editor-at-large there since then.

==Early life==
Born in Liverpool, O&#x27;Sullivan was educated at St Mary&#x27;s College, Crosby, and received his higher education at the University of London. He stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate for the constituency of Gateshead West in the 1970 British general election.
In 2014 he moved to Budapest, to set up the Danube Institute. He is the Director of 21st Century Initiatives and Senior Fellow at the National Review Institute in Washington, D.C..

==Journalism career==
O&#x27;Sullivan is a former editor (1988–1997) and current editor-at-large of the opinion magazine &quot;National Review&quot; and a former senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. He had previously been the editor-in-chief of United Press International, editor-in-chief of the international affairs magazine, &quot;The National Interest&quot;, and a special adviser to British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1991 New Year&#x27;s Honours List.
In 1998 O&#x27;Sullivan was a leading member of the journalistic team that founded the &quot;National Post&quot;, a right-leaning national newspaper in Canada.

O&#x27;Sullivan is the founder and co-chairman of the New Atlantic Initiative, an international organisation dedicated to reinvigorating and expanding the Atlantic community of democracies. The organisation was created at the Congress of Prague in May 1996 by Václav Havel and Margaret Thatcher.

In 2013, O&#x27;Sullivan became first the director and then president of the Danube Institute, a Budapest-based think tank, for which he is paid an annual salary of 150,000 Euros, indirectly financed by the Hungarian government. The Danube Institute exists to provide a centre of intellectual debate for conservatives and classical liberals and their democratic opponents in Central Europe. Based in Budapest and Washington, D. C., it seeks to engage with centre-right institutions, scholars, political parties and individuals of achievement across the region to discuss problems of mutual interest.

Concurrently, in February 2015 O&#x27;Sullivan also became the editor of the Australian monthly magazine &quot;Quadrant&quot;. In January 2017 he stepped down as editor and become the international editor.

O&#x27;Sullivan has published articles in &quot;Encounter&quot;, &quot;Commentary&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Policy Review&quot;, &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, &quot;The American Spectator&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, &quot;Quadrant&quot;, &quot;The Hibernian&quot;, the &quot;Hungarian Review&quot; and other journals, and is the author of &quot;The President, the Pope, and the Prime Minister&quot; (Washington, D.C.: Regnery, 2006).

Philosopher Roger Scruton praises O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s book, which &quot;forcefully&quot; argues &quot;that the simultaneous presence in the highest offices of Reagan, Thatcher and Pope John Paul II was the cause of the Soviet collapse. And my own experience confirms this.&quot;

He also lectures on British and American politics and is the Bruges Group&#x27;s representative in Washington DC.

==Views==
===O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first law===
He is known for O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first law, or O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s law, stating: &quot;All organizations that are not actually right-wing will over time become left-wing.&quot; The law is identical to Robert Conquest&#x27;s second law of politics.

===Multiculturalism===

In an article, O&#x27;Sullivan wrote: &quot;After all, radical Islamists have three advantages on their side: demography (the populations of Islamic nations are increasing while the West suffers a &#x27;birth dearth&#x27;); rapidly growing Islamic diasporas in the West, fueled by illegal immigration; and official Western policies of multiculturalism (which not only encourage immigrants to retain their original cultural identity but even promote the &#x27;de-assimilation&#x27; of previously assimilated minorities in the West)...the decline of Christian belief and social influence; and the habit of respecting other cultures as unities while treating the West as a kind of multi-cultural supermarket in which Western civilization is merely one rather dusty shelf. To these trends politicians add appeasement, both diplomatic (of neighboring North Africa) and electoral (of local Muslim constituencies)&quot;.

On July 18, 2005, O&#x27;Sullivan wrote an article titled, &quot;The Islamic Republic of Holland. How One Nation Deals with a Revolutionary Problem&quot;.

In a 2017 review, O&#x27;Sullivan says &quot;The new policy [encouraging migration] accelerated the transformation of Britain into a multicultural society with racial and religious tensions; terrorist murders, bombings, and beheadings; physical attacks on gays in East London; the extraordinary epidemic of the rape and sexual grooming of underage girls...hostile demonstrations against British soldiers returning from Afghanistan; an estimated (by the British Medical Association) 74,000 cases of female genital mutilation by 2006; the occasional honor killing; and excellent restaurants&quot;.

==Private life==
O&#x27;Sullivan currently resides in Budapest with his wife Melissa.

<doc id="1167949" wikidata="Q858400" url="?curid=1167949" title="Cardinal (train)">
<text>The Cardinal is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak between New York Penn Station and Chicago Union Station via Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Charlottesville, Charleston, Huntington, Cincinnati, and Indianapolis. Along with the &quot;Floridian&quot; and &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, it is one of three trains linking the Northeast and Chicago&quot;.&quot; The trip between New York and Chicago is scheduled for 28 hours.

The &quot;Cardinal&quot; has three round trips each week, departing New York City on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and departing Chicago on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Prior to being discontinued in 2019, the &quot;Hoosier State&quot; provided service on the portion of the &quot;Cardinal&#x27;s&quot; route between Indianapolis and Chicago on the other four days of the week.

The &quot;Cardinal&#x27;s&quot; ridership was 82,705 in fiscal year 2023, a 3.0% increase from FY2022, but approximately 25% below its pre-COVID-19 pandemic ridership of about 109,000 in FY2019. In the two fiscal years prior to the pandemic (FY2018 and FY2019), ridership had increased 12.5%. In FY2020, the Cardinal earned $7.1 million on expenses of $22.6M—a revenue-to-cost ratio of 31%, the second lowest among all Amtrak routes.

== History ==

The &quot;Cardinal&quot; is the successor of several previous trains, primarily the New York Central (later Penn Central) &quot;James Whitcomb Riley&quot; and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) &quot;George Washington&quot;. The &quot;James Whitcomb Riley&quot; was a daytime all-coach train which operated between Chicago and Cincinnati (via Indianapolis). The &quot;George Washington,&quot; the C&amp;O&#x27;s flagship train, was a long-distance sleeper that ran between Cincinnati and—via a split in Charlottesville, Virginia—Washington, D.C. and Newport News, Virginia. Until the late 1950s, the &quot;Riley&quot; carried the &quot;Washington&quot;″s sleeper cars between Cincinnati and Chicago. Both routes survived until the formation of Amtrak in 1971.

Amtrak kept service mostly identical through the spring and summer of 1971. It slowly began integrating the trains that summer. The two trains began exchanging through Washington—Chicago and Newport News—Chicago coaches at Cincinnati on July 12, and a through sleeping car began September 8. On November 14, the &quot;Riley&quot; and &quot;George Washington&quot; merged into a single long-distance Chicago-Washington train, with the eastbound train (train 50) known as the &quot;George Washington&quot; and the westbound train (train 51) known as the &quot;Riley&quot;. The eastern terminus was briefly extended to Boston, giving the Northeast Corridor a one-seat ride to Chicago. However, it was truncated back to Washington in 1972. On May 19, 1974, Amtrak fully merged the &quot;George Washington&quot; into the &quot;Riley&quot;.

During the early Amtrak era, the &quot;Riley&quot; was plagued by the poor condition of ex-New York Central track in Indiana. In 1973, it was moved to ex-Pennsylvania Railroad track through Indianapolis. By 1974, Amtrak rerouted it off Penn Central track altogether; by then, the trackage had deteriorated so badly that the &quot;Riley&quot; was limited to for much of its route through Indiana. The Newport News section ended in 1976, replaced by the Boston–Newport News &quot;Colonial&quot;. A number of long-distance trains running along former Penn Central trackage in the Midwest were plagued by similar problems.

The &quot;James Whitcomb Riley&quot; was renamed the &quot;Cardinal&quot; on October 30, 1977, as the cardinal was the state bird of all six states through which it ran. However, due to poor track conditions in Indiana, the train was rerouted numerous times, first over various Penn Central/Conrail routings that had once been part of the Pennsylvania Railroad, then ultimately over the former Baltimore and Ohio route via Cottage Grove by 1980.

The &quot;Cardinal&quot; was eventually extended to run along the Northeast Corridor again in an effort to improve the Cardinal&#x27;s cost recovery ratio, but this time with the eastern terminus moved to New York. Previously, the &quot;Broadway Limited&quot; ran from New York to Chicago along the Northeast Corridor, but only as far south as Philadelphia. The train was discontinued on September 30, 1981, but revived on January 8, 1982, per a mandate initiated by Senator Robert C. Byrd. While the &quot;Cardinal&quot; and its predecessors had run daily, the revived Cardinal ran only three times per week. The revived train followed another new route, via Richmond and Muncie, Indiana. This arrangement lasted until April 27, 1986, when the train was finally moved to its current route via Indianapolis. On October 29, 1995, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; was truncated to Washington, D.C. after the consist was updated with Superliners. On October 27, 2002, after derailments on other routes depleted available Superliner cars, the Superliners were replaced with Viewliners. The &quot;Cardinal&quot; continued to operate the Chicago-Washington D.C. schedule. Service to New York was restored on Sunday&#x27;s westbound &quot;Cardinal&quot; on October 27, 2003. Full service to New York resumed on April 26, 2004.

From March 29, 2018, to November 8, 2018, due to continuing construction at New York Penn Station, the &quot;Cardinal&quot;″s eastern terminus was temporarily moved to Washington. &quot;Cardinal&quot; passengers needing to travel to or from points north of Washington were transferred to a &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;.

=== &quot;Hoosier State&quot; ===

With the Indianapolis routing, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; began operating jointly with the Chicago–Indianapolis &quot;Hoosier State&quot;. The &quot;Hoosier State&quot; operated to Indianapolis on the days the &quot;Cardinal&quot; did not, assuring seven-day service between Chicago and Indianapolis. This pattern ceased on October 25, 1987, when the &quot;Hoosier State&quot; became a full-fledged daily train once again. The &quot;Hoosier State&quot; was dropped on September 8, 1995, but resumed again on July 19, 1998, again running on days that the &quot;Cardinal&quot; did not run.

On December 17, 1999, Amtrak extended the &quot;Hoosier State&quot; to Jeffersonville, Indiana, (and later to Louisville, Kentucky) and renamed the train the &quot;Kentucky Cardinal&quot;. This new train was a daily service; on days when the &quot;Cardinal&quot; operated, the two trains ran combined between Indianapolis and Chicago. Amtrak ultimately discontinued the &quot;Kentucky Cardinal&quot; on July 4, 2003, and brought back the &quot;Hoosier State&quot; on the pre-1999 schedule.

After Indiana discontinued its subsidy, Amtrak suspended the &quot;Hoosier State&quot; as of June 30, 2019. Passengers who booked trips after that date were compensated with &quot;Cardinal&quot; tickets.

=== Plans ===
In the July 2010 issue of &quot;Trains&quot; magazine, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; was noted as being one of five routes under consideration for performance improvement. For the &quot;Cardinal&quot;, the proposed changes included increasing service from thrice-weekly to daily operation, and changing the western terminus to St. Louis, Missouri. &quot;Railfan and Railroad&quot; magazine also suggested that the train be rerouted to St. Louis, with a separate section bound for Chicago.

In early October 2010, Amtrak released a report detailing plans to increase the &quot;Cardinal&quot;″s service from thrice-weekly to daily service, as well as increasing the train&#x27;s on-time performance and food service. The January 2011 issue of &quot;Trains&quot; later revealed that Amtrak would scrap re-routing and Superliner conversion and instead adopt not only daily service, but also purchasing dome cars to be used along the Chicago-Washington, D.C., portion of the trip. In addition, the routing into Chicago Union Station would be changed and station platforms along the route containing coal dust would be scrubbed and cleaned.

However, obstacles to a daily &quot;Cardinal&quot; persist. Track capacity is limited on the Buckingham Branch Railroad, a short line railroad between Orange and Clifton Forge, Virginia where the &quot;Cardinal&quot; operates along former C&amp;O/CSX trackage, preventing frequent freight trains from passing a daily &quot;Cardinal&quot;. This problem also applied to the planned-but-failed &quot;Greenbrier Presidential Express&quot; train, which would also have traversed the Buckingham Branch on a weekly basis. The Buckingham Branch requires additional funding to expand several sidings before allowing additional service. Another obstacle is freight congestion in Chicago particularly at the 75th Street Corridor on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. The third obstacle is capacity at the Long Bridge in Washington, D.C. Infrastructure improvements are being made at all three. The Orange Branch between Orange and Gordonsville raised train speed after the completion of a track and signal project in 2017. The Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) has received funding under a public–private partnership (P3) for the 75th Street Corridor with construction beginning in October 2018 and is scheduled to be finished by 2025. A parallel span of the Long Bridge is full funded and moving towards engineering design and financing.

Starting on October 1, 2019, traditional dining car services were removed and replaced with a reduced menu of &quot;Flexible Dining&quot; options. As a result, the changes to the consist of the train will have the dining car serve as a lounge car for the exclusive use of sleeping car passengers.

In June 2021, Senator Jon Tester of Montana added an amendment to the Surface Transportation Investment Act of 2021 which would require the Department of Transportation (not Amtrak itself) to evaluate daily service on all less frequent long-distance trains, meaning the &quot;Cardinal&quot; and &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;. The bill passed the Senate Commerce Committee with bipartisan support, and was later rolled into President Biden&#x27;s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which Congress passed on November 5, 2021. The report is known as the Amtrak Daily Long-Distance Service Study and must be delivered to Congress within two years. In mid-2023, Amtrak applied for a federal grant to operate the &quot;Cardinal&quot; daily and increase speeds between Indianapolis and Dyer. In December 2023 the daily &quot;Cardinal&quot; project was granted $500,000 from the IIJA through the Federal Railroad Administration&#x27;s Corridor Identification and Development Program.

== Train consist ==
In the early 1990s, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; ran with the usual Amtrak long-distance consist of two EMD F40PHs or one GE E60, plus several material handling cars (MHC) and baggage cars, followed by several Amfleet coaches, an Amfleet lounge, a Heritage diner, two or three Heritage 10-6 sleepers, a slumbercoach, and finally, a baggage dormitory car. Following the delivery of the Superliner II fleet, however, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; was re-equipped with Superliner cars in 1995. As a result, its route was truncated to end in Washington D.C., as Superliners cannot operate on the Northeast Corridor due to low tunnel clearances in Baltimore and New York City. With the Superliner equipment, the consist would usually be two Superliner sleeping cars, a diner, a Sightseer Lounge, a baggage coach, and a coach.

In 2002, two derailments on other routes took numerous Superliner cars out of service. Because of this, insufficient Superliner equipment was available for use on the &quot;Cardinal&quot;. The &quot;Cardinal&quot; was re-equipped with a consist of single-level long-distance cars, including dining, lounge, sleeping, and dormitory cars, although service to New York was not restored until 2004. Subsequent fleet shortages shortened the &quot;Cardinal&quot; further, and at one point, the train was running with two or three Amfleet II coaches and a combined diner-lounge car. While the sleeping car was later restored, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; has not had a dormitory car or a diner since. Similarly, though the baggage car was also removed, it was restored in response to an upturn in patronage in mid-2010. In 2016, Amtrak added business class service to the &quot;Cardinal&quot;. The &quot;Cardinal&quot; seasonally included a dome car prior to the car&#x27;s retirement.

Amtrak began replacing the older P40DC and P42DC locomotives with Siemens ALC-42 locomotives in 2023. 

The &quot;Cardinal&#x27;s&quot; typical consist as of July 2024 is made up of:

* P42DC or ALC-42 locomotive
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Coach
* Amfleet II Café/Lounge Car
* Viewliner II Sleeping Car
* Viewliner II Baggage/Dorm Car

== Route overview ==
Amtrak bills the &quot;Cardinal&quot;″s route as one of the most scenic in its system. After an early morning departure from New York and traveling south down the Northeast Corridor, the train passes through Virginia&#x27;s rolling horse country, across the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah Valley. It then climbs the Allegheny Mountains and stops at the resort town of White Sulphur Springs, home to The Greenbrier, a famous luxury resort. The &quot;Cardinal&quot; descends on tracks through New River Gorge National Park and Preserve, a unit of the National Park Service protecting the longest deepest river gorge in the Eastern U.S. The river is popular for white water rafting, and the cliffs attract rock climbers. The forests blaze with autumn foliage and the train usually sells out during the peak season.
The schedules are timed to provide a daylight transit of the New River Gorge nearly all year. Westbound, the train travels at night from Charleston, West Virginia, on to Indianapolis, where it arrives at about dawn, reaching Chicago mid-morning. Eastbound, the &quot;Cardinal&quot; departs late afternoon, reaching Indianapolis before midnight, Charleston mid-morning, and New York City in the late evening. While Cincinnati is served both directions with stops after midnight, about 15,000 passengers a year arrive or depart from this station.

The &quot;Cardinal&quot; is one of only two of Amtrak&#x27;s 15 long-distance trains to operate only three days a week, the other being the &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;. Like other long-distance trains, passengers are not allowed to travel only between stations on the Northeast Corridor on the &quot;Cardinal&quot;. Eastbound trains only stop to discharge passengers from Alexandria northward, and westbound trains only stop to receive passengers from Newark to Washington. This policy aims to keep seats available for passengers making longer trips; passengers traveling between Northeast Corridor stations can use the more frequent &quot;Acela Express&quot; or &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; services.

== Route details ==
The &quot;Cardinal&quot; operates over Amtrak, CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, Buckingham Branch Railroad, Canadian National Railway, Union Pacific Railroad, and Metra trackage:

*Amtrak Northeast Corridor, New York to Washington
*CSX RF&amp;P Subdivision, Washington to Alexandria
*NS Washington District, Alexandria to Orange

<doc id="1167973" wikidata="Q5536190" url="?curid=1167973" title="George Allen (American football coach)">
<text>George Herbert Allen (April 29, 1918 – December 31, 1990) was an American football coach. He served as the head coach for two teams in the National Football League (NFL), the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 to 1970 and the Washington Redskins from 1971 to 1977. Allen led his teams to winning records in all 12 of his seasons as an NFL head coach, compiling an overall regular-season record of 116–47–5. Seven of his teams qualified for the NFL playoffs, including the 1972 Washington Redskins, who reached Super Bowl VII, losing to Don Shula&#x27;s Miami Dolphins. Allen made a brief return as head coach of the Rams in 1978, but was fired before the regular season commenced.

Allen began his coaching career at the college football level, serving as head football coach at Morningside College from 1948 to 1950 and Whittier College from 1951 to 1956. He moved to the NFL in 1957 as an assistant coach for the Rams under head coach Sid Gillman. Allen then spent eight years, from 1958 to 1965, as an assistant coach and head of player personnel for the NFL&#x27;s Chicago Bears before returning to the Rams as head coach in 1966.

After three years as a broadcaster for CBS Sports, from 1978 and 1981, and a short stint as an executive with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL) in 1982, Allen resumed coaching in 1983 as head coach for the Chicago Blitz of the newly formed United States Football League (USFL). The following year, he served as head coach of the USFL&#x27;s Arizona Wranglers, leading them to the league&#x27;s title game, where the Wranglers lost to the Philadelphia Stars. After a second hiatus from coaching, Allen returned to the game a final time, serving as head football coach for one season, in 1990, at California State University, Long Beach. In ten seasons as a college football head coach, Allen amassed a record of 53–38–7.

Allen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002. His eldest son, also named George Allen, is a Republican politician who served as Governor of and United States Senator from Virginia. His second son, Bruce, followed his father&#x27;s footsteps as a football coach and executive, serving as general manager for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Redskins of the NFL.

==Early life==
Born in the Grosse Point Woods district of Detroit, Allen was the son of Loretta M. and Earl Raymond Allen, who was recorded in the 1920 and 1930 U.S. census records for Wayne County, Michigan as working as a chauffeur to a private family. He earned varsity letters in football, track and basketball at Lake Shore High School in St. Clair Shores, Michigan and graduated in 1937.

Allen went to Alma College in Alma, Michigan and later at Marquette University in Milwaukee, where he was sent as an officer trainee in the United States Navy&#x27;s V-12 Navy College Training Program. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in education from Michigan State Normal College—now known as Eastern Michigan University—in Ypsilanti and then attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where he earned a Master of Science degree in physical education in 1947.

==Coaching career==
===Morningside===
Allen was the head football coach at Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa. The Morningside team was called the Chiefs at that time. He held that position for three seasons, from 1948 through 1950. His coaching record at Morningside was 16–11–2.

===Whittier===
Allen was the head football coach at Whittier College in Whittier, California for six seasons, where he was 32–22–5 from 1951 through 1956. He was also the head baseball coach there from 1952 to 1957.

===Assistant coach in the NFL===
Allen joined the Los Angeles Rams staff in 1957, under fellow Hall of Fame coach Sid Gillman. Allen was dismissed after one season and, after he resided in Los Angeles out of football for several months, George Halas, founding owner and head coach of the Chicago Bears, brought him to Chicago during the 1958 season. The original purpose of Allen&#x27;s hiring was to scout the Rams, whom the Bears would play twice during the season; Allen was asked for insights into Gillman&#x27;s, and the Rams&#x27;, offensive strategy and signals. Allen&#x27;s thoroughness and attention to detail so impressed Halas that he eventually earned a full-time position on the coaching staff. During the latter stages of the 1962 season Allen replaced veteran Clark Shaughnessy as Halas&#x27; top defensive assistant, effectively making him the Bears&#x27; defensive coordinator.

His defensive schemes and tactics—and his strong motivational skills—helped make the Bears&#x27; unit one of the stingiest of its era. Allen&#x27;s presence also had a formative effect on such future Hall of Fame players as linebacker Bill George and end Doug Atkins during their most productive years. By 1963, in his first full season in charge of the Bears&#x27; defense, Allen&#x27;s innovative strategies helped the Bears yield a league-low 144 total points, 62 fewer than any other team, and earn an 11–1–2 record that was a half-game better than the two-time defending league champion Green Bay Packers and allowed the Bears to host the NFL championship game. Following their 14–10 victory over the New York Giants on December 29 at frigid Wrigley Field, the Bears&#x27; players awarded Allen the &quot;game ball.&quot; NBC&#x27;s post-game locker-room television coverage infamously captured Bears players singing &quot;Hooray for George, hooray at last; hooray for George, he&#x27;s a horse&#x27;s ass!&quot;

Allen was also given responsibility for the Bears&#x27; college player drafts; most likely his best-remembered choices were three players who won election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and became household names in American sport—end Mike Ditka (chosen in 1961), halfback Gale Sayers, and middle linebacker Dick Butkus (1965). Allen&#x27;s was the most common name to be suggested as a replacement for Halas should the grand old man of the league decide to step down. Jeff Davis&#x27;s biography &quot;Papa Bear&quot; states that Halas informally told Allen in 1964 and 1965 that he would ultimately name him as head coach. But in 1965, after a 9–5 Bears finish that earned the iron-willed Halas NFL Coach of the Year honors, Allen decided to look elsewhere to fulfill his head-coaching ambitions. Halas stayed on as head coach through the 1967 season.

===NFL head coaching career===
====Return to the Rams====
On January 10, 1966, ex-Rams assistant coach Allen reached an agreement with Los Angeles Rams owner Dan Reeves to replace Harland Svare as head coach. He quickly faced a legal battle with Halas, who claimed that Allen&#x27;s leaving was in breach of his Bears contract. (Halas accused Allen and the Rams of &quot;chicanery.&quot;) The Bears&#x27; owner did win his case in a Chicago court but immediately allowed Allen to leave, saying he initiated the lawsuit to make a point about the validity of contracts. Halas would not be so magnanimous in an NFL meeting soon after when he attacked Allen&#x27;s character. Upon hearing this, Green Bay coach Vince Lombardi joked to Reeves, &quot;Sounds like you&#x27;ve got yourself a hell of a coach.&quot;

The Rams had only notched one winning season since 1956, and for much of that time been dwelling in or just above the NFL&#x27;s basement. The team boasted considerable talent at several positions, most notably on the defensive line; the &quot;Fearsome Foursome&quot; (David Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen, Rosey Grier, and Lamar Lundy) had gained vast attention on a losing team. Allen brought his well-known motivational skills to Los Angeles, and his twice-daily (sometimes three times) rigorous training-camp practices took players by surprise. He revealed the philosophy that he would be known for throughout his NFL career—acquiring veteran players for draft picks to fill specific roles. His motto was &quot;the future is now.&quot; He also emphasized the role of special teams (kickoff, punt, and field-goal units) as integral to team success. He revamped the Rams&#x27; secondary with trades and installed quarterback Roman Gabriel, previously relegated to the bench, as his starter. Allen vaulted the Rams from a 4–10 record in 1965 to 8–6 in his first year—the team&#x27;s first winning season since 1958. Allen received 1967 Coach of the Year honors for leading the Rams to an 11–1–2 record and the NFL Coastal Division title, their first post-season berth since 1955. Despite an 11–3 record (while winning their first 11 games) during the 1969 season and losing a conference playoff game to Joe Kapp and the Minnesota Vikings, the offense and the record did not rollover to the 1970 season and Allen was released at the end of season. The news surprised the football world, but subsequent reports revealed that discord between Reeves and Allen had been growing for some time. By some accounts, the owner&#x27;s lower-key temperament differed from Allen&#x27;s intense approach; more importantly, some animus had developed between the two men in November 1968. After the favored Rams struggled to a tie at San Francisco, Allen disparaged the sloppy Kezar Stadium turf; a few days later Reeves, addressing reporters, subtly admonished his coach for making what he considered an &quot;alibi.&quot; The next week, after a narrow home win over the New York Giants, Allen rebuffed Reeves&#x27;s handshake and upbraided him for &quot;embarrassing me and my family.&quot;

Allen&#x27;s firing was met not only with criticism from fans and reporters, but an overwhelming show of support from Ram players: 38 members of the team&#x27;s 40-man roster, including such standouts as Gabriel, Jones, Olsen, Lundy, Dick Bass, Jack Snow, Bernie Casey, Tom Mack, Irv Cross, Ed Meador, and Jack Pardee, stated for the record that they would seek a trade or retire if Allen were not reinstated. Many of these players convened a press conference at a Los Angeles hotel to urge their employer, Reeves, to reconsider his decision. Allen, wearing dark glasses, spoke briefly to thank his players for their support but did not make an appeal for his job. After some negotiation Reeves offered Allen a new two-year contract, although there was no indication that the two men had reconciled their differences.

Allen and the 1969 Rams seemed to justify the coach&#x27;s renewed presence; their 11–3 record earned them a Coastal Division title as Gabriel won the NFL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award. But in both 1969 and 1970 Allen&#x27;s team could not produce the championship that many had predicted for them. At the end of 1970, with the Rams missing the playoffs and Allen&#x27;s contract expiring, Reeves dismissed the coach again. It had been tacitly assumed that Allen had been granted the two extra years to bring the Rams a title, and so the second time the firing met with neither fan outrage nor player objection. Allen quietly left Los Angeles as the most successful coach in Rams history; he is currently fourth on the franchise&#x27;s all-time wins list behind John Robinson, Chuck Knox, and Mike Martz. He was replaced by UCLA head coach Tommy Prothro, almost Allen&#x27;s opposite in personality and approach.

====Washington Redskins====
Allen was hired as head coach and general manager of the Washington Redskins on January 6, 1971. Shortly after joining the Redskins, Allen made a series of trades with his former Ram team and brought seven 1970 Los Angeles players to Washington, including the starting linebacker corps (Maxie Baughan, Myron Pottios, and Pardee). Sportswriters nicknamed the team the &quot;Ramskins&quot; or the &quot;Redrams.&quot; Allen continued his practice of bringing in veteran players at all positions; one was quarterback Billy Kilmer, something of an NFL journeyman for a decade, whose wobbly but efficient passing and raw-boned leadership complemented and eventually supplanted strong-armed veteran Sonny Jurgensen. Allen restored the Redskins to competitiveness after over two decades of losing. The 1971 team was undefeated through late October and finished with a surprising 9–4–1 record and its first trip to the playoffs since 1945. Perhaps Allen&#x27;s most satisfying 1971 victory was a 38-24 Monday night win in Los Angeles in December that clinched a playoff berth.

Allen&#x27;s 1972 team, with Kilmer by now the starting quarterback, won the NFC East title with an 11–3 record; the defense allowed a conference-low 218 points on the way to a NFC title, which was secured with a 26–3 home victory over the defending Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys. The Redskins gained the chance to contest the undefeated Miami Dolphins for the world championship, a team they had beaten in the pre-season, but in Super Bowl VII at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the &quot;&#x27;Skins&quot; were overmatched by the Dolphins&#x27; relentless running game and staunch defense and lost, 14–7.

With Allen&#x27;s painstaking attention to detail and enthusiastic approach, Washington&#x27;s teams were known for their spirited play and camaraderie, with the coach often leading a chant of &quot;Three Cheers for the Redskins&quot; (&quot;Hip Hip Hooray&quot;) in the locker room after wins. The Redskins acquired a reputation of a team that came by its success through hard work and workmanlike play that was rarely reflected in individual statistics. Becoming a household phrase among NFL fans was the &quot;Over-the-Hill Gang&quot;—the aging Redskin veterans who seemed to save their best efforts for the most important games. They reached the playoffs in five of Allen&#x27;s seven years, but were not able to duplicate their 1972 Super Bowl trip. It was during this time that the Redskins&#x27; fierce rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys became a choice subject for pro football fans, and Allen inflamed it with bizarre actions like taunting Cowboys players while wearing an Indian headdress.

As had been the case with the Rams, Allen&#x27;s intense approach was seen to indicate that winning in the present was all-important, with planning for the franchise&#x27;s future taking a lesser priority. In 1977, the Redskins were 9–5, but failed to reach the postseason for the second time in three seasons. Although owner Williams did attempt to negotiate a new pact for Allen, there were rumors that he was beginning to question his coach&#x27;s philosophy.

====Third stint with the Rams====
After rejecting a $1 million, four-year contract offer throughout the 1977 season, Allen was dismissed by the Redskins in mid-January 1978. He was replaced by one of his favorite players, Jack Pardee, by then the promising young head coach of the Bears, who had gained the wild card playoff berth ahead of the Redskins; both had finished at 9–5.

Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom was searching for a new coach after parting ways with Chuck Knox, and decided to bring Allen back. Allen&#x27;s hiring was announced on February 1, and he returned to Los Angeles in 1978 with much media fanfare. His second stint as the Rams&#x27; head coach was an unfortunate experience for all concerned. Unlike his first stint, Allen did not have full authority over personnel. He thus worked with general manager Don Klosterman to oversee a talented roster that had made the team a perennial playoff challenger.

Allen brought with him his scrupulous discipline and attention to detail, which extended to practice-field protocol and dining-hall decorum. However, his autocratic coaching style did not play well with the new generation of NFL players, and a group of Ram players chafed at the regulations almost immediately. Some made their grievances public; a few, including standout linebacker Isiah Robertson, briefly left camp. As newspaper reports were quoting players expressing confidence that differences would be resolved, the Rams played listlessly and lost the first two games of the 1978 exhibition schedule. Rosenbloom decided that an immediate change was needed to save the season, and announced Allen&#x27;s firing on August 13. Many of Allen&#x27;s own players were surprised by the decision. Defensive coordinator Ray Malavasi, well-respected and liked by players (and the only holdover from Chuck Knox&#x27; staff), replaced him; the Rams ultimately advanced to that year&#x27;s NFC Championship Game and the following year to the Super Bowl. Rosenbloom died in April 1979.

Although he was off the sidelines for the first time in three decades, Allen was not unemployed for long. He soon joined CBS Sports as an analyst for NFL network telecasts, and worked in the broadcast booth from 1978 to 1981. For much of his tenure, he was part of CBS&#x27; number-two broadcast team with play-by-play announcer Vin Scully. During 1978, Scully and Allen were teamed with former NFL great Jim Brown as the network&#x27;s only three-man broadcast team.

====CFL, USFL, and Long Beach State====
George Halas biographer Jeff Davis notes that Allen had contacted Halas in late 1981, asking to be considered for the vacant head coaching position with the Bears. However, Halas was still smarting at how Allen left the Bears 15 years earlier. He angrily rejected Allen&#x27;s overtures and hired his old friend and former player Mike Ditka instead.

Allen had a brief flirtation with the Canadian Football League when he was hired by the Montreal Alouettes as president and chief operating manager on February 19, 1982. Allen also agreed to purchase 20 percent of the team, with an option to become the majority shareholder. However, three months later, Allen resigned after continued financial troubles and a shift in majority ownership from Nelson Skalbania to Harry Ornest soured Allen on the situation.

On June 21 of that same year, Allen became part-owner, chairman and head coach of the Chicago Blitz of the fledgling United States Football League, returning to the city where he had established his NFL coaching credentials two decades earlier. In his first season in 1983, the Blitz were tabbed as the early favorite to capture the league&#x27;s inaugural title, in part because Allen assembled a roster laden with NFL veterans. The team finished in a tie for first with the Michigan Panthers with a 12–6 record, but the team lost the tiebreaker, making them the wild card team. In their playoff game against the Philadelphia Stars, the Blitz held a commanding 38–17 lead before a late comeback sent the game into overtime, where Chicago lost by a 44–38 score.

Two months after that collapse, the Blitz were part of a bizarre transaction in which the entire franchise was essentially traded for the Arizona Wranglers. Blitz owner Ted Diethrich was disgusted at the team&#x27;s lackluster attendance figures. Looking for a way out, he found it when Wranglers owner Jim Joseph decided to get out after suffering massive losses of his own. The Diethrich/Allen group sold the Blitz to James Hoffman, then bought the Wranglers from Joseph. Diethrich and Hoffman then engineered a swap of assets that resulted in the 1983 Blitz roster moving virtually en masse to Arizona, while nearly all of the 1983 Wranglers moved to Chicago. Allen, who retained his posts as part-owner, chairman, and head coach, was thus able to retain much of the core of a roster that had been considered NFL-caliber.

During that 1984 season, Allen&#x27;s Wranglers struggled early before finishing with a 10–8 mark, earning another wild card spot. In the opening round of the playoffs, Arizona staged a comeback to knock off the Houston Gamblers, 17–16. The following week, the Wranglers stopped the Los Angeles Express, 35–23, in the Western Conference final. However, the run of success came to an end in the USFL Championship Game, when Arizona was shut down in a 23–3 defeat.

In September 1984, Allen resigned his positions with the team after the Wranglers&#x27; financial troubles necessitated severe budget cuts.

Following several years out of the public eye, he accepted a one-year offer to coach at Long Beach State University in 1990. The 49ers, which had managed only 11 wins against 24 losses their previous three seasons, responded to Allen&#x27;s mentoring with a 6–5 record.

Following Allen&#x27;s death, the team played one additional season in 1991 under Willie Brown, then LBSU dropped the football program.

===Legacy===
Allen was considered one of the hardest-working coaches in football. He is credited by some with popularizing the coaching trend of 16-hour (or longer) work-days. He sometimes slept at the Redskin Park complex he designed. Allen&#x27;s need for full organizational control and his wild spending habits would create friction between him and the team owners he worked for. Edward Bennett Williams, the Redskins&#x27; president, once famously said, &quot;George was given an unlimited budget and he exceeded it.&quot; In ending Allen&#x27;s second stint as the Rams&#x27; head coach after only two preseason games in 1978, Carroll Rosenbloom said, &quot;I made a serious error of judgment in believing George could work within our framework.&quot; and &quot;He got unlimited authority and exceeded it.&quot; Allen was also notorious for his paranoia, regularly believing that his practices were being spied upon and that his offices were bugged. He even went as far as being the first coach in the NFL to employ a full-time security man, Ed Boynton, to keep potential spies away and patrol the woods outside Redskin Park.

As documented by NFL Films, Allen was known to eat ice cream or peanut butter for many meals because it was easy to eat, and saved time so Allen could get back to preparing for the next game. Allen kept in shape as a coach, and would run several miles at the start of each day. He did not curse, smoke, or drink, instead habitually consuming milk (some suspected that this beverage of choice arose from ulcers they suspected the always-high-strung coach to suffer from). Coach Allen would later be appointed by President Ronald Reagan to the President&#x27;s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It is interesting to note that President Richard Nixon (an armchair coach) once &quot;recommended&quot; the team run an end-around play by wide receiver Roy Jefferson. Allen agreed, choosing to run the play against the San Francisco 49ers in the 1971 NFC Divisional playoff game. Jefferson was tackled by the 49ers&#x27; Cedrick Hardman for a 13-yard loss on the play, a game the Redskins lost by four points. 

====Preferring veteran players over younger players====
As a coach, Allen was known for his tendency to prefer veteran players to rookies and younger players. During Allen&#x27;s early years with the Redskins, the team was known as the &quot;Over-the-Hill Gang,&quot; due to the predominance of players over the age of 30, such as quarterback Billy Kilmer. Upon becoming Redskins coach, Allen traded for or acquired many players - all veterans of course - he had formerly coached with the Rams, including Jack Pardee, Richie Petitbon, Myron Pottios, John Wilbur, George Burman, and Diron Talbert, leading to the Redskins sometimes being referred to in those days as the &quot;Ramskins.&quot; The phrase &quot;the future is now&quot; is often associated with Allen; he made 131 trades as an NFL coach, 81 of which came during his seven years with the Redskins.

====Emphasizing special teams play====
Allen was also known for emphasizing special teams play, and in 1969 became the NFL&#x27;s first coach to hire a special teams coach, 32-year-old Dick Vermeil, to run a standalone special teams unit. (Jerry Williams followed suit a month later when he hired Marv Levy.) When Vermeil went to UCLA in 1970, Allen hired Levy, and then brought Levy with him to Washington in 1971. During the 1971 preseason, Allen coaxed his former long snapper with the Rams, George Burman, out of retirement, bringing him to Washington for the primary purpose of being the snapper on punts, thus making Burman the NFL&#x27;s first modern specialist long snapper, while Sam Wyche was brought as a specialty Holder.

Allen&#x27;s coaching tree led to several high-profile special teams coaches and achievements. Vermeil discovered special teams standout Vince Papale in 1976, won a Super Bowl as head coach of the St. Louis Rams, and coached return great Dante Hall with the Chiefs. Levy led the Buffalo Bills to four consecutive Super Bowl appearances in the early 1990s, while coaching perhaps the greatest special teams coverage man ever, Steve Tasker. Allen&#x27;s longtime offensive assistant Ted Marchibroda gave Bill Belichick his first NFL coaching job. Both Vermeil and Levy would go on to employ Frank Gansz, whom Vermeil called &quot;the finest special teams coach ever.&quot;

===Notable accomplishments===
Allen had the third-best winning percentage in the NFL (.681), exceeded only by Vince Lombardi (.736) and John Madden (.731). He also never coached an NFL team to a losing season. This was particularly notable in the case of the Redskins, who had finished above .500 only once over the past 15 seasons (1969, under Lombardi) before Allen&#x27;s arrival.

Allen was noted primarily as a defensive innovator and a motivator. He was an early innovator in the use of sophisticated playbooks, well-organized drafts, use of special teams, and daring trades for veterans over new players. He is also known for sparking the Dallas Cowboys–Washington Redskins rivalry to new heights. In the seven seasons that Allen&#x27;s team played the Cowboys, six of them saw the teams split the two contests they played before the Cowboys finally broke through in winning both contests in Allen&#x27;s final season as coach in Washington; in total, Allen went 7–8 against the Cowboys in Washington but managed to reach the Super Bowl with Washington&#x27;s victory over Dallas in the 1973 NFC Championship Game.

Allen was inducted to the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Allen married the former Henrietta (Etty) Lumbroso (1922–2013), with whom he had four children, three sons and one daughter. His son George became a Republican politician, having served as Governor and U.S. Senator from Virginia. Another son, Bruce, served as an executive for the Oakland Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Washington Redskins of the NFL. Allen&#x27;s third son, Gregory, is a sports psychologist. His daughter, Jennifer, is an author.

===Death===
Allen died at age 72 from ventricular fibrillation in his home in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on December 31, 1990.

There was some speculation afterward that his death may have been caused by a form of Gatorade shower. On November 17, some of his Long Beach State players dumped a Gatorade bucket filled with ice water on him following a season-ending victory over UNLV; in an interview some weeks later, Allen quipped that the university couldn&#x27;t afford actual Gatorade, and said that he had felt somewhat unwell since then. The sports editor of the Long Beach State newspaper, the &quot;Daily Forty-Niner&quot;, recalled that the temperature was in the 50s with a biting wind. Allen stayed on the field for media interviews for a considerable length of time in his drenched clothing, and remained in his wet clothing on the bus back to Long Beach state.

However, in 2012, Allen&#x27;s son George denied that the Gatorade shower caused the death, saying it merely caused a cold, and said that his father had a pre-existing heart arrhythmia. He stated that seeing Gatorade showers on television was a reminder that his father &quot;went out a winner&quot;.

After Allen&#x27;s death, the soccer and multipurpose field area on the lower end of campus was dedicated in his honor as George Allen Field. A youth baseball field in Palos Verdes Estates is also named after him.

<text>Dushasana (,दुःशासन, ), also spelled Duhshasana, Dussasana or Duhsasana, also known as Sushasana, is an antagonist in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He was second eldest among the Kaurava princes and the younger brother of Duryodhana. Dushasana&#x27;s jealousy and herd mentality were the two qualities said to have led to his downfall in the Mahabharata.

==Etymology==
His name derives from the Sanskrit words &quot;duḥ-&quot; &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;śāsana&quot; &quot;rule&quot;; thus &quot;duḥśāsana&quot; means &quot;[one who is] hard to rule.&quot;

==Birth and early life==
When Dhritarashtra&#x27;s queen Gandhari&#x27;s pregnancy continued for an unusually long time, she beat her womb in frustration and out of jealousy towards Kunti, the wife of Pandu, who had just given birth to Yudhishthira (the eldest of the five Pandava brothers). At this, a hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh emerged from her womb. Gandhari was devastated and called upon Vyasa, the great sage who had prophesied she would give birth to one hundred sons, to redeem his words.

Vyasa divided the ball of flesh into one hundred and one equal pieces, each piece no bigger than a thumb. He put them in pots of milk, which were sealed and buried in the earth for two years. At the end of the second year, the first pot was opened and Duryodhana emerged. Within a period of one month all the other 99 sons and single daughter of Dhritarashtra were born. Dushasana was the second after Duryodhana.

Dushasana was devoted to his older brother Duryodhana. He (along with Duryodhana and Shakuni) was very closely involved in the various schemes and plots to kill the Pandavas.

==Draupadi&#x27;s humiliation==
After Yudhishthira lost a game of dice with Shakuni—losing first his kingdom, then his brothers and his wife Draupadi—Dushasana, at the behest of his brother Duryodhana, dragged Draupadi by the hair into the assembly and tried to disrobe her. Draupadi prayed to Krishna, who made her sari to be of an infinite length so that Dushasana could not take it off. The assembled men were amazed at this miracle. They condemned Dushasana and praised Draupadi. However, Draupadi was humiliated at being dragged into court by her hair. Unlike the critical version, some tellings of the story say that she swore that she would never again tie up her hair until it was washed in Dushasana&#x27;s blood. Then Bhima, who could no longer watch Draupadi&#x27;s insult in silence, arose. He vowed to tear open Dushasana&#x27;s chest in battle and drink his blood. Bhima also exclaimed that if he could not fulfill his oath, then he would not meet his ancestors in heaven.

==Kurukshetra war and death==
 Dushasana played an important role in Kurukshetra War and fought many warriors.

On the first day of war, Dushasana was the first one to shot the first arrow. He fought a fierce battle with Nakula and later with Yudhishthira and was defeated by them.
On the second day of war, Dushasana killed Nakula&#x27;s bodyguards. An angry Nakula defeated and nearly killed Dushasana in a sword fight.
On the 10th day of war, Dushasana attacked and injured Shikhandi in order to save Bhishma.
On the 13th day of war, Dushasana was among the powerful warriors who brutally murdered Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu badly injured Dushasana. Later, his son Drumasena killed Abhimanyu.
On the 14th day, Dushasana tried to stop Arjuna from reaching to 
Jayadratha but defeated by him in a small archery duel.
During the night war, Dushasana defeated and killed Virata&#x27;s bodyguards.
On the 16th day of the Kurukshetra War, Dushasana killed Magadha&#x27;s minister Vrihanta. Bhima fought with Dushasana in a mace war and beat him. When Dushasana was unable to fight Bhima uprooted both the arms of Dushasana. Then he took out his armour, tore his chest using his bare hands and killed Dushasana. Dushasana&#x27;s death was the most brutal death in the entire epic. To fulfill his oath, Bhima drank the blood from Dushasana&#x27;s open chest. The soldiers who witnessed this brutal scene fainted, thinking of Bhima as a monster. All the Kaurava supporting warriors were highly disturbed by this scene.

Though not attested in the Mahabharata, according to folk narratives, Bhima washed Draupadi&#x27;s hair with Dushasana&#x27;s blood as a symbolic revenge for her humiliation.

<doc id="1167978" wikidata="Q836984" url="?curid=1167978" title="Orica">
<text>Orica Limited () is an Australian-based multinational corporation that is one of the world&#x27;s largest providers of commercial explosives and blasting systems to the mining, quarrying, oil and gas, and construction markets, a supplier of sodium cyanide for gold extraction, and a specialist provider of ground support services in mining and tunnelling.

Orica has a workforce of around 15,000 employees and contractors, servicing customers across more than 100 countries. Orica is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange. It has in recent years been subject to a number of high-profile industrial accidents and fatalities.

==History==
Founded in 1874 as Jones, Scott and Co, a supplier of explosives during the Victorian gold rush, the company was bought by Nobel Industries. Nobel later merged with several British chemical manufacturers to form Imperial Chemical Industries. In 1928, Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ) was incorporated to acquire and coordinate all of its Australasian interests.

In July 1997, ICI Australia became an independent Australasian company after Imperial Chemical Industries, divested its 62.4 per cent shareholding in the company. ICI Australia was required to change its name and on 2 February 1998 was rebranded as Orica.

In 2010, Orica spun off Dulux leaving the company to focus on the provision of services to the mining, construction and infrastructure industries.

In November 2014, Orica sold its chemicals business to the Blackstone Group. The sale was completed on 2 March 2015, and the chemicals business now operates under the name Ixom.

In 2018, Orica acquired GroundProbe, a provider of monitoring and measurement technologies for mining.

In 2020, Orica acquired Essa, a manufacturer and distributor of industrial explosives in Peru.

In 2023, Orica acquired Terra Insights and Cyanco.

==Financial performance==
Orica&#x27;s revenue in 2016 was AUD$5.1 billion and statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) attributable to the shareholders of Orica for the full year ended 30 September 2016 was $343 million.

==Incidents==
===Corporate===
====Bullying scandal====
In March 2015 then CEO Ian Smith was ousted from the business due to bullying of a female employee. During Smith&#x27;s tenure as CEO, some of the senior leadership within the organisation left for other companies. Alberto Calderon replaced Ian Smith in 2015 until 2020. Orica&#x27;s earnings post Ian Smith&#x27;s departure experienced a significant decline as well as incurred multiple extraordinary charges. During this time there was also significant turnover within the executive leadership team.

===In Australia===
====Botany, New South Wales====
=====Organochlorines in the Botany aquifer=====
Remediation began in 2005 after production of chlorinated solvents by ICI over many years resulted in significant contamination of the aquifer, a high-quality sand aquifer located below the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. The main chemical contaminant found in groundwater around the old ICI site is EDC (1,2-dichloroethane), a persistent organic pollutant and byproduct of the manufacture of PVC. Orica has built an A$167 million Groundwater Treatment Plant (GTP) to achieve containment of this contamination and provide high quality industrial water to Botany Industrial Park. Water produced by Orica&#x27;s GTP saves Sydney&#x27;s potable water supply around per day (approx 0.5% of Sydney&#x27;s water demand). Residents in the area were banned from accessing the groundwater. Orica estimated in 2012 that the GTP had been in operation for seven years of its 30-year design life cycle.

=====Mercury leak, 2011=====
The Botany chemical plant released mercury vapour into the atmosphere on 27 September 2011, breaching environmental standards for nine hours. An air monitor located near residents at Banksmeadow detected the mercury vapour and the Office of Environment &amp; Heritage (OEH) was notified. Dr Mariann Lloyd-Smith, said the length of time the emissions lasted was extraordinary, &quot;Mercury is extremely toxic. It is recognised as one of the most important and most hazardous toxins that we deal with, and there is currently a UN negotiation for a global treaty on mercury to address this,&quot; she said. The mercury vapour was associated with mercury which had polluted the soil on the Orica site, due to leaking pipes. Robyn Parker, the New South Wales Minister for the Environment &amp; Heritage said &quot;I am incredibly angry and disappointed that yet again we have another incident with Orica.&quot; In January 2013, the NSW EPA announced that it would conduct a review of off-site emissions of mercury.

=====Mercury leak, 2012=====
On 17 January 2012 Orica reported a mercury leak at its Port Botany plant, the second mercury incident since August 2011. In a series of samples of environmental air, the EPA recorded a mercury level of ; more than double the regulatory limit of . The leak occurred in December 2011 and Orica failed to report the leak to authorities until the following month. The site of the breach was the thermal desorbtion stack at the company&#x27;s carpark waste remediation project, which was closed when the breach occurred. The New South Wales Environment Protection Authority said the incident was not linked to the mercury emissions breach in September at Orica&#x27;s other Botany site on Beauchamp Road.

====Gladstone, Queensland====
=====Cyanide leaks, 2012=====
On 8 June 2012 the Queensland Department of Environment &amp; Science launched a legal prosecution against Orica in the Gladstone Magistrates&#x27; Court. The company was charged with 279 counts of willfully contravening its approvals in relation to alleged cyanide leaks into Gladstone Harbour. The government claimed that in January and February 2012, Orica discharged effluent water containing heightened levels of cyanide into Gladstone Harbour. &quot;The charges are related to allegations that the company did not inform The Department of the Environment. The charges related to a breach of conditions rather than any environmental harm &quot;per se&quot;&quot;.

====Kooragang, New South Wales====
Throughout August and December 2011 Orica had six major chemicals incidents or leaks in Australia. The first one was a leak of hexavalent chromium from its ammonium nitrate plant near Stockton that affected 70 households; the second one was the release of arsenic into the Hunter River at Newcastle; the third was of mercury vapours from its Botany site; the fourth was a leak of ammonia from its site at Kooragang; the fifth was an ammonium nitrate leak of at its Kooragang Island plant, only a day after being allowed to reopen; and the sixth incident was a sulphuric acid leak of approximately at its Port Kembla site. The fourth leak triggered a public forum and NSW Government investigation into the leaks, and the temporary shut down of the Kooragang Island plant.

=====Hexavalent chromium leak, 2011=====
Orica&#x27;s Kooragang Island chemical plant released hexavalent chromium into the atmosphere on 8 August 2011. The known carcinogen was released between 6 and 6:30pm and the spill continued for approximately 20 minutes. An estimated of hexavalent chromium was discharged from the Orica plant, with another over the suburb of Stockton. Approximately 20 workers at the plant were exposed as well as 70 nearby homes in Stockton. Orica failed to notify government authorities until 16 hours after the incident and residents were not formally notified for three days. Under a Prevention Notice issued on 11 August 2011, the OEH closed the ammonia plant at Kooragang Island. The hexavalent chromium leak was the subject of a New South Wales Parliament Upper House inquiry that was concluded in February 2012.

=====Hunter River arsenic leak, 2011=====
Effluent containing high levels of arsenic leaked into the Hunter River from the Kooragang Island chemical plant on 19 August 2011 at 3pm. Arsenic had not been used on the site since 1993, however during a cleanup of a hexavalent chromium spill on the site the week prior, old deposits of arsenic leaked into a storage pond and drained into the Hunter River. It was estimated the arsenic concentration was 0.067 milligrams per litre, exceeding licence limits. Barry O&#x27;Farrell, the Premier of New South Wales, said &quot;two spills in a fortnight raise reasonable concerns about systemic failures in the way in which this company is operating its facilities.&quot; O&#x27;Farrell continued, &quot;I&#x27;ve had a gutful of families being distressed, by potential threats to their safety and threats to their local environment.&quot;

=====Ammonia leak, 2011=====
On 9 November 2011 more than of ammonia was initially suspected of venting to the atmosphere from the Kooragang Island plant during a 45-minute period. The venting was due to a relief valve operating to prevent overpressure of a liquid ammonia tank. Engineering studies subsequently revised the amount down to ~. The leak was identified by firefighters responding to an alarm raised by the hospitalisation of two railway workers at who were affected by the plume of escaping gas. Six fire units and a hazardous chemicals unit were called to the chemical plant to deal with the leak of the ammonia gas. Despite initial statements by Orica that the leak posed no public health risk, two rail workers in the nearby suburb of Mayfield East were overcome by ammonia fumes and were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. Less than an hour before the ammonia leak, the Environment Protection Authority announced it would take Orica to court over the hexavalent chromium leak which occurred on 8 August 2011 at the same plant.

=====Ammonium nitrate leak, 2011=====
On 7 December 2011, in excess of of weak ammonium nitrate (&lt;35%) solution/fertiliser leaked onto grassed areas at the Kooragang Island chemical plant. Emergency services were called to the site including a HAZMAT team. The spill occurred less than a day after the Environmental Protection Authority announced it would allow the reopening of part of the Kooragang Island plant. Local residents continued to criticise the company for failing to notify residents in a timely manner and called for the plant to remain closed.

=====Hydrogen stack fire, 2012=====
On 8 January 2012 lightning ignited hydrogen being released from the plant. Flames higher than leapt from the hydrogen stack and were reported by local residents to authorities.

====Port Kembla, New South Wales====
=====Sulphuric acid leak, 2011=====
A spill of approximately of concentrated sulphuric acid occurred at the chemical plant on 16 December 2011. The leak was suspected to be caused by a hole in the ship-to-shore pipeline. Acting chief environmental regulator Mark Gifford from the NSW EPA said he was concerned about the ongoing incidents with Orica.

===In Mexico===
====Coahuila====
=====Explosion, 2007=====

On 10 September 2007, 28 people were killed and over 250 injured in Coahuila, Mexico, as a result of an accident between a pick-up and a truck which resulted in an explosion. The truck was transporting about 25 metric tons of dynamite under contract for the company Orica near the cities of Monclova and Cuatro Ciénegas. Exact numbers of the dead and injured vary according to source. Orica&#x27;s website stated there were a total of 28 fatalities in 2007—one worker and 27 contractors/members of the public.

<doc id="1167983" wikidata="Q734394" url="?curid=1167983" title="The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud">
<text>The Moon Lay Hidden Beneath a Cloud was an Austrian musical duo composed of Albin Julius and Alzbeth. Their music reflected their deep fascination with myriad aspects of European medievalism including ritual, clerical chants and the daily experience of the peasantry.

==Overview==
Their music combined modern electronics, tape loops and samplers with medieval instruments such as hurdy-gurdy, shawm, and Hexenscheit. Alzbeth was the primary vocalist for the group and often sang traditional songs in numerous archaic languages including Middle High German, Latin and Old French. Julius provided distorted and backup vocals.

When performing live, the band often played in old churches, fortresses, medieval prisons and theatres that provided an appropriate atmosphere for their static, militaristic performances.

Early on, the band provided no official photographs or any more information outside of a Swiss mailing address found inside of the albums. The band rarely appeared live or granted interviews. No songs were ever given official titles. After their split, both of the duo were considerably more vocal and promotional images were released.

With each subsequent release the band presented themes traveling further into European history and becoming more martial, choral and bombastic in approach, culminating in their final album; the largely World War II-inspired &quot;The Smell of Blood but Victory&quot; (1997).

In 1998, the duo, also a couple, parted ways and recorded no new material. All of the group&#x27;s music was released on their own Arthur&#x27;s Round Table record label and distributed by World Serpent Distribution.

==Post-Split==
At the same time as the recording of &quot;The Smell Of Blood But Victory&quot;, Julius released material on a then-side project he called Der Blutharsch. This has subsequently become Julius&#x27; main project after the split. Julius has since played live and released some Der Blutharsch covers of TMLHBAC material that he has claimed was originally intended for Der Blutharsch.

Alzbeth did erect an official TMLHBAC website and has said that she will be releasing material by a musical project of her own.

In 2000, Alzbeth released a book after the duo parted ways. This hard-back and cloth-bound book included lyrics, photographs and references for the historical themes used by the band.

In 2004, likely spurred by the bankruptcy of World Serpent Distribution and the subsequent out of print status for the band&#x27;s entire catalogue, Alzbeth announced through her mailing list that Julius and she had decided to rerelease their back catalogue in some form in the future.

Albin Julius died on May 4, 2022.

<text>Sandridge is a village and civil parish between the city centre of St Albans ( to the south-west) and Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire, England, forming part of the contiguous built-up area of St Albans.

==History==

The original name was &quot;Saundruage&quot; meaning a place of sandy soil serviced by bond tenants.

The earliest recorded mention of Sandridge is in the year 796 the parish being part of the revenue of the Mercian Kings. It was given by Egfrith son of Offa in the first year of his reign to abbot Eadric second abbot of St Alban&#x27;s Monastery and to the monks of St Albans.

Part of the parish of Sandridge was added to the Municipal Borough of St Albans in 1887. The remainder of the parish was renamed Sandridge Rural in 1894 when Sandridge Rural Parish Council was formed. In 1913 a further 241 acres were transferred to St Albans. The parish name reverted to Sandridge in 1957.

==Second Battle of St Albans==
In February 1461 the final skirmishes of the Second Battle of St Albans took place in and around Sandridge as the Earl of Warwick, for the Yorkists, retreated towards Nomansland.

==Information==
The population of Sandridge parish at the time of the 2021 census was 11,919. This includes some people living in the Jersey Farm area of St Albans and partly the Marshalswick area.

The village has three pubs: the &quot;Green Man&quot;, the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; and the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Head&quot;.

The village church, St Leonard&#x27;s, is medieval. Its lychgate was built as a memorial to World War I.

It also supports Sandridge Rovers F.C., who play in the Hertfordshire Senior County League.

Sandridge was one of the earlier homes of the great English general, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and his infamous wife, Sarah, a favourite of Queen Anne. The title Baron Sandridge was given to Churchill by James II in 1685, and was his first English peerage title (his earlier title, Baron Eyemouth, had been created in 1682 by James&#x27;s predecessor, Charles II, in the Peerage of Scotland).

In 1939 the first Second World War secret Wireless Intercept Station was constructed by the GPO at the top of Woodcock Hill. It was the first of a group of stations dedicated to Diplomatic Interception with rows of radio operators listening to the wireless traffic between Germany, Italy, Tokyo and other enemy embassies around the world. Messages intercepted at Sandridge were sent to Bletchley Park for decryption. The results were vital to Winston Churchill who used the information to make important decisions about the course of the war. After the Second World War it became part of the Diplomatic Wireless Service under GCHQ and in 1973 the site was taken over by the Home Office for police research.

It is home to a small grass airfield to the north, named Coleman Green Airstrip which is used for general aviation.

In 2008 the Woodland Trust announced plans to create a new forest north of Sandridge. The of woodland are now called Heartwood Forest. The forest surrounds the north and northwest of the parish.

<doc id="1167995" wikidata="Q890529" url="?curid=1167995" title="Drona">
<text>Droṇa (, ), also referred to as Dronacharya (, ), is a major character of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. In the epic, he serves as the royal preceptor of the Kauravas and the Pandavas. He is one of the primary counsellors and warriors featured in the epic.

Drona is the son of the sage Bharadvaja, and a descendant of the sage Angirasa. Despite being master of advanced military arts and the divine weapons known as astras, Drona initially chooses a life of poverty until he is humiliated by his friend Drupada, the king of Panchala. With the help of his students, he captures Drupada and takes away half of the kingdom for his son, Ashwatthama. 

Drona serves as the second commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, from the 11th day to the 15th day. The acharya fails four times in capturing Yudhishthira (the 11th day, 12th day, 14th day, and the 14th night). He was beheaded by Dhrishtadyumna—his student and son of Drupada—when he meditates to release his soul on the battlefield.

==Etymology==
Drona&#x27;s name means vessel, bucket, or quiver. He had many other names, including:

*Dronacharya (द्रोणाचार्य) - teacher Drona
*Bharadwajputra (भार्दवाजपुत्र) - son of Bharadwaja
*Parshuramashishya (परशुरामशिष्य) - disciple of Parashurama

==Birth and early life==
On a river side, Sage Bharadwaja saw an apsara named Ghritachi. He was filled with desire and his seed fell into a pot or basket. Inside it, a child developed who was named Drona because he was born in a pot and was brought to the ashram.

In Sage Bharadwaja&#x27;s ashram, his son Drona and Prince Drupada were educated. Drona and Drupada became best friends, and Drupada promises to share his wealth and kingdom with Drona when he becomes king. Time passed, and Drupada became the king of Panchala, and Drona became a sage and teacher. Drona had a son named Ashwatthama. Drona was not interested in material wealth and became poor.

===Drupada&#x27;s insult===
Once, Drona&#x27;s son Ashwatthama was playing with his friends. His friends were drinking milk and he wanted to drink it too. But his friends mixed flour with water and gave it to him. Ashamed of being unable to provide for his son due to his poverty, Drona remembers Drupada&#x27;s promise. He went to Drupada&#x27;s palace in hopes that Drupada would remember his promise and share his wealth with him. But Drupada, having grown vain, refused. He also insulted Drona by asking how a beggar could be his friend. This outraged Drona and he wanted revenge.

===Acquisition of weapons===

There was a sage named Agnivesha who was the former disciple of Drona&#x27;s father, Bharadwaja. Agnivesha studied the use of weapons from the sage, Agastya, and passed his knowledge to Drona and Drupada. Many years later, Drona heard that the sage Parashurama was donating his wealth. However, by the time Drona reached Parashurama&#x27;s hermitage in the Mahendra Mountain, the latter had already given away all his wealth. He had only his body and his weapons to give away. Drona chose to have Parashurama&#x27;s weapons and acquired the knowledge of weapons from the sage. Thus, Drona was able to become a renowned warrior and an instructor of archery and other weapons.

==As the preceptor of the Kuru Kingdom==
Drona along with Kripa was brought by Bhishma for the education of the Kuru princes. After being insulted by Drupada, Drona and his family went to live with his brother-in-law, Kripa, in Hastinapura. There, Drona encountered the young Kuru princes and demonstrated his skill by pulling their ball from a well using only stalks of grass attached from end-to-end with the power of mantras. Upon learning this feat, Bhishma immediately recognised Drona and appointed him as the preceptor of the Kuru princes. But out of all of them, Arjuna stood was the most prominent. Once, Arjuna had saved Drona from a crocodile while the latter was bathing in a stream. As a reward, Drona gave Arjuna mantras to invoke the super-powerful divine weapon of Brahma known as Brahmashirshastra, but told Arjuna not to use this invincible weapon against any mortal.

Under Drona&#x27;s tutelage, Duryodhana and Bhima excelled in the art of maces, Ashwatthama excelled in the use of astras, Nakula and Sahadeva excelled in swordsmanship, Yudhishthira excelled in charioteering, and Arjuna excelled in archery. When Arjuna, inspired by his brother Bhima&#x27;s nocturnal eating, mastered archery in absolute darkness, Drona was moved. Drona was greatly impressed by Arjuna&#x27;s concentration, determination, and drive, and promised him that he would become the greatest archer on earth.
===Ekalavya===

Ekalavya, the son of a Nishadha chief, approached Drona seeking his instruction. But since Ekalavya belonged to the Nishada tribe, Drona refused to train him alongside the Kauravas and Pandavas. Undeterred, Ekalavya began study and practice by himself, having fashioned a clay idol of Drona&#x27;s to watch over his training. Solely by his determination, Ekalavya became an archer of exceptional skill.

One day, Ekalavya&#x27;s focus in training was disturbed by the barking of a dog belonging to the Kuru princes. Ekalavya fired arrows that filled up the dog&#x27;s mouth without spilling blood or causing injury to the dog. The Kuru princes were amazed by the trick and looked for the archer when they saw Ekalavya, who introduced himself as a pupil of Drona&#x27;s. This made Arjuna jealous and sad about Ekalavya&#x27;s archery skills as he said that he learnt indirectly from the same guru Drona that Arjuna was learning. Drona was in a tangle: on the one hand, he promised Arjuna that he would make him the greatest archer on earth; on the other hand, Ekalavya had indeed been training as his pupil without his consent, albeit being guided only by his idol. To resolve the matter, Drona accepted Ekalavya as his student, but demanded the thumb on his dominant hand as gurudakshina, or teacher&#x27;s payment, in order to limit his abilities and further growth in archery, thus pacifying Arjuna. Ekalavya, being an exemplary disciple, immediately cut off his thumb and presented it to Drona.

==== Demonstration by the pupils ====
Dhritarashtra approved the demonstration of weapon-game by the princes. An arena was prepared. Drona entered the arena. Drona worshiped the gods as a form of preparatory rites. Then he invited the Brahmins to bless his disciples. After that the students gave gold, precious stones, clothes and other valuables to the teacher. The teacher blessed him. With this the demonstration started. Bhima and Duryodhana showed their skills by fighting with each other. The mock fight turned into a serious fight. Drona sent Ashwatthama to stop the fight because seeing this the citizens may get triggered by their fight. Then, Arjuna entered the hall with much appreciation and praises from the citizen of Hastinapura. He showed various archery skills to the people. Drona impressed by his beloved student Arjuna&#x27;s skills then declared that Arjuna is the greatest archer in the world. Then, Karna gatecrashed and entered the arena and surpassed everyone&#x27;s expectations and performances with the permission of Drona. He then challenged Arjuna for a duel and Kripa demanded that Karna state his lineage. Karna could not answer as he does not know who are his real parents. Duryodhana then made Karna the king of Anga. Then sunset occurred and the duel of Karna and Arjuna was stopped.

===Drona&#x27;s revenge===

After Drona completed the formal training of the Kuru princes, he demanded that they invade Panchala and bring Draupada as their Gurudakshina. Arjuna succeeds in defeating Drupada and brings the captured king to Drona. Drona reminds Drupada about their days of friendship and his false promise before taking away half of the Panchala kingdom. Drona would make Ashwatthama the king of the annexed half of the Panchala kingdom. This action would lead Drupada to perform a sacrificial yagna in order to beget a son who would kill Drona. The sages Upayaja and Yaja helped him to beget such a son Dhrishtadyumna. The sacrificial fire also yielded a daughter, Draupadi.

==Role in the Kurukshetra War==

Drona had been the preceptor of most kings involved in the Kurukshetra War on both sides. Drona strongly condemned Duryodhana exiling the Pandavas, as well as the Kauravas&#x27; general abuse towards the Pandavas. But being a servant of Hastinapura, Drona was duty-bound to fight for the Kauravas, and thus against his favorite Pandavas. After the fall of Bhishma on the 10th day, he became the Chief Commander of the Kaurava army on the 11th day of war. Duryodhana manages to convince Drona to try to end the war by capturing Yudhishthira. Though he killed hundreds and thousands of Pandava troops, Drona failed to capture Yudhishthira on the 11th and 12th day of the war, as Arjuna was always there to repel his advances.

===Abhimanyu&#x27;s killing===
On the 13th day of the war, Drona formed the &quot;Chakravyuha&quot; strategy to capture Yudhishtira, knowing that only Arjuna and Krishna would know how to penetrate it. The Trigartas were distracting Arjuna and Krishna into another part of the battlefield, allowing the main Kaurava army to surge through the Pandava ranks.

Unknown to many, Arjuna&#x27;s young son Abhimanyu had the knowledge to penetrate the formation but did not know the way out. At the request of Yudhishthira, Abhimanyu agreed to lead the way for the Pandava army and was able to penetrate the formation. However, he was trapped when Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu, held the Pandava warriors who were following him, at bay. Abhimanyu did not know how to get out of the Chakravyuha, but embarked upon an all-out attack on the Kaurava army, killing tens of thousands of warriors single-handedly. Drona is impressed with Abhimanyu and praises him endlessly, earning the ire of Duryodhana. With his army facing decimation and spurred on by Duryodhana&#x27;s criticisms, Drona asked the Kaurava warriors to simultaneously attack Abhimanyu, to strike down his horses and his charioteer and to disable his chariot from different angles. Left without support, Abhimanyu began fighting from the ground. Exhausted after his long and prodigious feats, Abhimanyu was eventually killed.

After that, several who fought against Abhimanyu were criticized for their murder, such as Bhurishrava, Drona and Karna.

===Fourteenth day===
The devious murder of his son enraged Arjuna, who swore to kill Jayadratha the next day or immolate himself. Drona constructed three combined vyuhas to protect Jayadratha, first was the Shakata vyuha then was Padma Vyuha and last was the Srigantaka vyuha and at its rear was Jayadratha and stood at the head of the box formation or Shakata vyuha

In the early part of the day, Arjuna and he duel, and Arjuna is unable to bypass his preceptor. With Krishna&#x27;s prodding, Arjuna circumvents Drona. When Duryodhana rages at Drona, Drona replies and that he intends to capture Yudhishthira while Arjuna is away and would only hasten their victory. In a notable battle, Drona attempts to capture Yudhishthira but is stopped by Dhristadyumna. Drona severely wounds his friend&#x27;s son, disarming him and forcing him to retreat. When he attempts to chase after Dhristadyumna, he is checked by Satyaki, who insults his teacher&#x27;s teacher and issues a challenge. Their combat is described as fierce and despite being able to hold off Drona for several hours, Satyaki eventually tires and has to be rescued by the Upapandavas.
Later in the day, Yudhishthira sends Satyaki to aid Arjuna. When Satyaki comes upon Drona, he circumvents him, saying he must follow in his teacher&#x27;s footsteps. When Yudhishthira later sends Bhima, Drona recounts what happened with Arjuna and Satyaki, and hence makes sure he does not allow Bhima also to circumvent him. Angrily rebuking him, Bhima shatters Drona&#x27;s chariot with his mace. Drona takes up another chariot, only for Bhima to smash that one as well. In total, Bhima smashes eight of Drona&#x27;s chariots and is able to bypass his guru.

== Death ==
On the 14th night of the Mahabharata war, Drona is instigated by Duryodhana&#x27;s remarks of being a traitor as he was not able to protect Jayadratha. Sensing his end is near, he used the Brahmastra against the common Pandava soldiers. At that moment, all the Saptarshi appeared on the sky and requested Drona to retract this ultimate weapon used on ordinary soldiers. Drona obeyed, retracting the weapon. The rishis continue and berate Drona for violating the rules of war, criticizing him for using divine weapons so indiscriminately.

On the 15th day, Drona kills many Pandava soldiers, including Virata in arrow-play and Drupada in a sword fight. Lamenting the deterioration of their friendship, Drona pays his respect to Drupada&#x27;s corpse. Drona and his son Ashwatthama unleashed havoc upon the entire Pandava army that day.
Knowing it would be impossible to defeat an armed Drona that day since Arjuna refuses to kill his guru, Krishna suggests a plan to disarm Drona by some means of contrivance. Bhima would then proceed to kill an elephant named Ashwatthama, and then claim to Drona that he has killed his son. Disbelieving his claim, Drona approached Yudhishthira, knowing of Yudhishthira&#x27;s firm adherence to Dharma and honesty. When Drona asked for the truth, Yudhishthira responded with &quot;Ashwatthama is dead, the elephant.&quot; Adding the word elephant indistinctly so that Drona could not hear it.

Then Drona descended from his chariot, laid down his arms and sat on the ground in meditation to find his son&#x27;s soul. Pandavas wanted to use this opportunity to arrest him, but enraged by the death of his father and several Panchala warriors, Dhrishtadyumna took this opportunity and beheads him, in a gross violation of the rules of war. Arjuna would condemn Dhrishtadyumna for this act.

==Analysis and modern assessment==
Drona was somewhat parallel to Bhishma both in martial powers, and, compelled by the refuge King Dhritarashtra had given him, in his unwavering commitment to fighting for Hastinapura irrespective of who the ruler was and whether or not the cause was just. Drona is often accused of dragging the Kuru dynasty into his own personal conflicts when he demanded his pupils to capture Drupada. This action would ultimately lead the Kingdom of Panchala developing hostile relations with Hastinapura. Drona was also notably silent during Draupadi&#x27;s disrobing as he was afraid of antagonizing the Kauravas.

Drona was criticized for many of his actions during the war:
* First, as a Brahmin, and secondly, as the princes&#x27; teacher, he should have removed himself from the battlefield. 
* Drona used the Brahmastra, celestial powerful weapons against the Pandava&#x27;s common foot-soldiers. This was looked down upon as it improper to use such weapons against those who are unacquainted with its use.

Drona&#x27;s overarching actions during the war are portrayed differently. When he became commander-in-chief, the rules of war were averted. Divine weapons were used against ordinary soldiers, war continued throughout the night, warriors no longer engaged each other one-on-one, etc. Specifically, he was willing to try to end the war by capturing Yudhishthira, while Karna was not, as he considered it lacking honor. In other versions, Drona&#x27;s differences in strategy are shown as a difference in philosophy- Drona believed, that as the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, his goal was to ensure the protection of his soldiers through any means necessary.

== In popular culture ==
The acharya remains a revered figure in Hindu history, and a pillar of the Indian tradition of respecting one&#x27;s teacher as an equal not only of parents, but even of God. The Government of India annually awards the Dronacharya Award for excellence in sports tutelage to the best sports teachers and coaches in India.

It is believed that the city of Gurgaon () was founded as &quot;Guru Gram&quot; by Dronacharya on land given to him by Dhritarashtra, the king of Hastinapura in recognition of his teachings of martial arts to the princes, and the &#x27;Dronacharya Tank&#x27;, still exists within the Gurgaon city, along with a village called Gurgaon. Indian Government (Haryana), on 12 April 2016 decided to reinstate and change the name of Gurgaon to Gurugram.

<doc id="1167996" wikidata="Q383358" url="?curid=1167996" title="Albirex Niigata">
<text>is a professional football club based in Niigata, Japan. Formed in 1955 as Niigata Eleven SC, it was renamed Albireo Niigata FC in 1995, and Albirex Niigata in 1997. They currently play in J1 League after being promoted from J2 League as champions in 2022.

==History==

For many years it had been a local autonomous amateur club, &quot;Niigata 11&quot;, that could never hope to see the light of day in an old Japan Soccer League dominated almost entirely by company teams. The creation of the J. League spurred the club to rise, and in the 1990s it began climbing fast through the divisions.

In 1998, Albirex Niigata joined the Japan Football League, and was merged into the J2 League after its creation in 1999. The team gradually became competitive and in 2001 and 2002 it came close to getting promoted to J1 and in 2003, it became the champion of J2 and finally joined the top flight.

=== Name changed ===
The team name is made from combining the star &quot;Albireo&quot; of the constellation Cygnus (the Swan) and the Latin word &quot;Rex&quot; meaning &#x27;king&#x27;. In 1997, due to copyright issues, the team name was changed from Albireo Niigata to the current Albirex Niigata.

===Team name transition===
*Niigata Eleven SC &quot;(Soccer Club)&quot; (1955)
*Albireo Niigata FC (1995)
*Albirex Niigata (1997)

==Home stadium==
Joining the J. League in 1999, its hometowns are Niigata and Seiro. Until 2003, it used Niigata Perfectural Sport Ground as the home ground but since 2004, the team began using Niigata Stadium Big Swan as well and now plays most of its games there. In 2003, it set a record for highest attendance in the J. League with the cumulative total of around 660,000. Its practice grounds are Albirex&#x27;s training facilities in Seiro Albillage and the in Shibata.

The club plays its home games in the Niigata Stadium &quot;Big Swan&quot;, which is currently called Denka Big Swan Stadium through a sponsorship deal. The stadium was opened in 2001 and has a capacity of 42,300. Prior to this the club had played its matches in the Niigata City Athletic Stadium constructed in 1938 with a capacity of 18,000.

The stadium was the site of two first round matches and one Round of 16 match in the past 2002 FIFA World Cup. It was also the venue for the 2009 National Sports Festival.

<text>The Moroccan Grand Prix () was a Grand Prix first organised in 1925 in Casablanca, Morocco with the official denomination of &quot;Casablanca Grand Prix&quot;.

==History==
In 1930, the race was held at the new Anfa Circuit (official denomination &quot;Anfa Grand Prix&quot;). It claimed the life of French driver Count Bruno d&#x27;Harcourt during a practice run. All winners, in touring cars, were either French or Monegasque.

There was no race in 1933 nor between 1935 and 1953. When it returned in 1954, it was held on a circuit at the city of Agadir for sports cars, and French dominance was interrupted by an Italian driver, Giuseppe Farina.

A new layout at Ain-Diab near Casablanca was made ready for the 1957 Formula One race which, although not counting toward the World Championship, attracted a world-class field. The race was won by Jean Behra for Maserati. The 1958 edition of the race was the only one to be part of the Formula One World Championship, and would be the final round of that season. The Championship battle was still alive between Mike Hawthorn of Ferrari and Stirling Moss of Vanwall. Hawthorn would finish second place to clinch the crown, despite his rival Moss winning the race. Vanwall would also clinch the inaugural Constructors Championship, but it was overshadowed by a crash involving Stuart Lewis-Evans, who died from his injuries six days later.

<doc id="1168004" wikidata="Q2008581" url="?curid=1168004" title="Hex (TV series)">
<text>Hex is a British television programme developed by Shine TV and aired on Sky One. The story is set in a remote English boarding school with a mysterious past. Series one explores the supernatural relationship between a fallen angel named Azazeal and a student called Cassie who is also a witch. In the second series the story centres on 500-year-old anointed one Ella Dee, and Azazeal&#x27;s son Malachi. Both series of the show are available on Region 2 DVD, with the first series released on Region 1 DVD in June 2007.

The show was cancelled in April 2006 after the end of the second series.

==Synopsis==
From its outset, &quot;Hex&quot; appears to be the story of Cassie Hughes, a withdrawn young woman who enrolls at the school but cannot quite seem to fit into the social milieu. The second series shifts the focus from the departing Cassie Hughes (Christina Cole) to a new heroine, Ella Dee (Laura Pyper).

===Series 1===
&quot;Hex&quot; is set at a remote English school, Medenham Hall, which occupies the former manor house and grounds of the McBain estate. It was the site of an 18th-century witchcraft scandal in which the female members of the line, the Medenham Witches, were tried and executed. Cassie, who raised herself in a single-parent household caring for her mentally unstable mother, has latent telekinetic, pyrokinetic and clairvoyant abilities that are awakened when she touches an antique vase that had been used in Voodoo rituals by the Medenham Witches. Her roommate, Thelma (who harbors an ill-concealed crush on Cassie), discovers that Cassie is a descendant of the Medenham Witches. Cassie has startling visions and dreams that she strives to interpret, and also struggles with controlling her growing telekinetic and pyrokinetic powers, which she is only able to summon in times of stress.

Cassie is stalked by a &quot;dangerous looking&quot; stranger who calls himself Azazeal. Initially glimpsed fleetingly, he becomes increasingly bold, even entering into the student&#x27;s rooms later in the series without warning or permission. Azazeal is revealed to be the leader of the biblical Nephilim, fallen angels, and he claims to be in love with Cassie. He has had previous relationships with schoolmistress Jo Watkins and Cassie&#x27;s own mother, which may have contributed to her mental illness.

Frustrated by his inability to convince Cassie that his claims are sincere, Azazeal kills Thelma before Cassie&#x27;s eyes as a sacrifice to increase his power and prove that he is truly who he says he is. This act has two unintentional consequences: his power over Cassie is initially weakened by the shock, and Thelma thereafter continues to share Cassie&#x27;s room as a ghost that only Cassie, Azazeal and other ghosts can see. Thelma never forgives Azazeal for her own death, and is a strong voice against him to Cassie, who has grown to have feelings for him. Thelma is unable to touch the living, but she can touch other ghosts and presumably manipulate inanimate objects (including clothing, artifacts, books, doors, window sashes, and vending machines) and eat, which she does constantly (since ghosts cannot gain weight). Thelma works behind the scenes to spy on Azazeal and gather evidence from places where Cassie cannot enter. Cassie, while horrified by some of Azazeal&#x27;s behaviour, ultimately finds herself drawn into his power. Azazeal possesses Cassie, and while under his power, she gives herself to him and they conceive a child.

Thelma learns from Peggy, the ghost of a woman who died in the 1918 influenza pandemic, that the gestation of Azazeal&#x27;s child is weakening the veil between worlds, allowing more ghosts to appear to the living. If the child is born, the veil will be torn, allowing the rest of the Nephilim to enter our world. If the pregnancy is terminated, the veil will heal, preventing the Nephilim from returning and leaving Azazeal the only one of his kind in our world. But there is a side effect: ghosts will also vanish from this world.

Cassie, after much convincing from Thelma decides that her fetus must be aborted, although it is growing at an alarming rate. A week after conception, the doctors believe she is nearing the end of her second trimester. Thelma assists Cassie, without telling her that success means that she may never see Cassie again. Azazeal tries to interfere and save his son, but Cassie goes through with the abortion...or so she thinks. When Thelma realizes that Cassie can still see her, Thelma knows that something has not gone right. Cassie discovers weeks later that the doctor who performed her procedure has been influenced by Azazeal, and that the baby is alive and in Azazeal&#x27;s care.

===Series 2===
Thelma discovers that Azazeal is raising the child, who is walking already, in an abandoned nearby church. She and Cassie decide that they must somehow get the child, whom Azazeal has named &quot;Malachi&quot;, but are clueless as to how to accomplish this. Azazeal becomes aware that they are watching him and tries to convince Cassie that he only wants her to join them so that they can be a &quot;real family&quot;. Cassie, still partially under his spell, is obviously attracted by the prospect but retains enough of herself to know that this is something she should not want.

While Cassie and Thelma strategize, new characters are introduced at the school while old ones depart. Troy, convinced that Cassie&#x27;s child is his, left the school at the end of the first series. Jo Watkins, having &quot;really let herself go,&quot; is seldom seen at school as she has become Azazeal&#x27;s live-in nurse and nanny. The school gains a new chaplain, Jez Heriot, who doesn&#x27;t &quot;wear the uniform&quot; except when conducting services and also teaches Ethics. When Jo effectively disappears, David Tyrel asks Jez to take her classes as well. The students don&#x27;t initially realize that he is a priest, and Roxanne is quite taken with him, so much so that she can&#x27;t help but seduce him even after the truth is known. A new student arrives at Medenham: Ella Dee. Her wardrobe instantly wins her points with the boys, evokes jealousy in the girls, and makes the faculty uncomfortable. Thelma is mildly attracted until she realizes that Ella can see her. There are other anomalies: Ella&#x27;s tuition is paid by a corporation and her family background is unknown. She also seems to know entirely too much about Cassie... and Azazeal.

It is quickly revealed that Ella is definitely not what she seems. She is 445 years old and the daughter of John Dee. Ella is also a witch and has been hunting Azazeal for centuries. So far, she has been very successful in preventing Azazeal from begetting a son by a mortal witch. This time, however, Ella was too late. Her mission: kill Malachi.

Ella instantly takes charge of both Cassie and Thelma, and formulates a plan to kidnap Malachi and sacrifice him in the school chapel. They are successful in grabbing the child, but Azazeal follows them and a series of alternately foolish and selfish decisions leads the girls inexorably to tragedy. With Azazeal present, Cassie loses her resolve and throws her body between Ella and Malachi. She dies instantly when Ella can&#x27;t stop her killing blow, and Azazeal regains Malachi and retreats.

Ella tries to devise a new strategy while Thelma tries to deal with her deep sense of loss, but Ella loses her edge as she feels herself falling for Leon. Azazeal appeals to Thelma&#x27;s own selfish desires and convinces her to steal and give him the Stone of Belial, one of Ella&#x27;s objects of power, in exchange for a last meeting with Cassie. Jez is revealed to be Ramiel, another of the Nephilim and Azazeal&#x27;s &quot;right-hand entity&quot;. With the Stone in their possession, Azazeal and Ramiel conspire to drive Ella insane by forcing her to relive the 17th century witch trial in which she was found guilty and nearly executed. Azazeal uses the Stone of Belial on Thelma, who travels back to Ella&#x27;s witch trial and rescues her from execution in the past. Ramiel&#x27;s scheming and manipulation leads to Ella&#x27;s commitment in an insane asylum, where a triumphant Azazeal seemingly abandons her.

Ella rapidly ages as she is stripped of her powers, but after Leon is brought in on her secret and is granted the power to see Thelma, he helps to revive her using the Volta. A friend of Leon&#x27;s who helped him get Ella out of the hospital (where she was cared for by Azazeal&#x27;s lover Perie the Faerie) is tortured by Azazeal and the now teenaged Malachi, who kills him out of pity.

Azazeal is asked to leave by &quot;higher powers&quot; and enlists Malachi at Medenham Hall. He and Ella say their goodbyes; with Malachi born, Ella has no desire to kill him, and Azazeal leaves the Stone of Belial in Malachi&#x27;s possession. Ella kills Jez and makes it look like suicide, precipitated by the revelation that he was having an affair with a student, which deeply affects Roxanne, who felt responsible because she had seduced him.

Ella and Malachi romance one another magically and otherwise, and their respective mentors, the Archangel Raphael and the demon Mephistopheles, both use psychological tactics to get them to do as they wish. Ella and Malachi eventually have sex, as the evil side had wanted, and by fulfilling Ella&#x27;s true desire (to be normal), she is made a slave to Malachi – his succubus.

Malachi kills a lesbian girl named Maya so that her ghost can consort with Thelma and give him leverage. Ella&#x27;s enslavement to Malachi is ended by Thelma, who invaded her dreams and invoked her greatest fear: fire. Leon attempts to kill Malachi, but is betrayed by Thelma (in hopes of keeping her and Maya together in the living world) and saved by Ella after Malachi sends a fallen Archangel, Sariel, to attack him. Mephistopheles betrays the cause of evil by helping Ella save Leon, who he feels did not need to die, and is subsequently punished and has his eyes removed. Raphael falls from grace by trying to rape Ella, who announces at this point that she no longer works for Raphael&#x27;s master, God, and is a freelance agent at last.

Ella loses all her feelings for Malachi, who quickly moves on to romancing Alex and other girls in the school. He eventually seduces the entire student body, creating an army of succubi and incubi that makes him too powerful for Ella to kill. The only students who are not converted are Roxanne (who becomes a &quot;pure soul&quot; in her quest for forgiveness from God for seducing Jez and causing his apparent suicide), Tom (who is secretly gay, in love with Leon, and impossible to convert because Malachi cannot make Leon love him back), Thelma (because after Ella later kills Maya, he has no hold over her), and Ella herself, who had already been freed from Malachi&#x27;s spell.

Ella digs up Maya&#x27;s corpse and beheads it, which destroys Maya&#x27;s lingering presence on Earth. Leon tries to kill Alex but cannot go through with it, leaving him feeling inferior to Ella. Jo Watkins, Cassie&#x27;s former teacher and Azazeal&#x27;s former lover, returns as Malachi&#x27;s new emissary from the &quot;higher powers&quot; and restores her position as headmistress by framing David Tyrel for embezzlement of school funds. Malachi cannot convert Tom, so he fakes the &quot;mark of Malachi&quot; on his neck and ensures that Leon will see it. Fooled by the false mark, Leon kills Tom, but by doing so, he achieves his greatest desire (not being inferior to Ella) and becomes an incubus of Malachi&#x27;s.

Leon almost kills Ella with knowledge gained from the Book of Orokiah, but Thelma helps to save her. He is locked in a cage and sedated, at which point Thelma saves him from Malachi by invoking his greatest fear (having his penis amputated). Returned to normal, he still ends his relationship with Ella and leaves the school. Roxanne is given the ability to see ghosts, and Thelma pretends to be an angel to get her to steal the Stone of Belial back from Malachi. Ella uses the Stone to travel back in time and attempts to kill Malachi while he is still a baby (at the end of Series 1), but she is attacked by Perie the Faerie and receives a mortal wound to the chest. Ella returns to Medenham Hall where she confesses her love for Leon as she lies dying under the watchful eyes of Thelma.

Rejected by Hell, Mephistopheles convinces Leon to return, where he saves Ella by cauterizing her wound. Malachi sacrifices the pure-of-heart Roxanne to &quot;enrage God&quot; by killing one of &quot;His creatures.&quot; The school is set ablaze and Thelma, Ella, and Leon escape from it to a field somewhere. As Malachi has started the &quot;End of Days,&quot; described by Mephistopheles as the final battle between good and evil, the series ends with blood pouring from a rock bearing the mark of Azazeal, similar to Malachi&#x27;s.

<doc id="1168010" wikidata="Q3012407" url="?curid=1168010" title="Life of Jesus">
<text>The life of Jesus is primarily outlined in the four canonical gospels, which includes his genealogy and nativity, public ministry, passion, prophecy, resurrection and ascension. Other parts of the New Testament – such as the Pauline epistles which were likely written within 20 to 30 years of each other, and which include references to key episodes in the life of Jesus, such as the Last Supper, and the Acts of the Apostles (), which includes more references to the Ascension episode than the canonical gospels also expound upon the life of Jesus. In addition to these biblical texts, there are extra-biblical texts that make reference to certain events in the life of Jesus, such as Josephus on Jesus and Tacitus on Christ.

In the gospels, the ministry of Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist. Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John the Baptist, after which he fasted for forty days and nights in the Judaean Desert. This early period also includes the first miracle of Jesus in the Marriage at Cana.

The principal locations for the ministry of Jesus were Galilee and Judea, with some activities also taking place in nearby areas such as Perea and Samaria. Jesus&#x27; activities in Galilee include a number of miracles and teachings.

== Genealogy and Nativity ==
The genealogy and Nativity of Jesus are described in two of the four canonical gospels: the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. While Luke traces the genealogy upwards towards Adam and God, Matthew traces it downwards towards Jesus. Both gospels state that Jesus was begotten not by Joseph, but conceived miraculously in the womb of Mary, mother of Jesus by the Holy Spirit. Both accounts trace Joseph back to King David and from there to Abraham. These lists are identical between Abraham and David (except for one), but they differ almost completely between David and Joseph. Matthew gives Jacob as Joseph&#x27;s father and Luke says Joseph was the son of Heli. Attempts at explaining the differences between the genealogies have varied in nature. Much of modern scholarship interprets them as literary inventions.

The Luke and Matthew accounts of the birth of Jesus have a number of points in common; both have Jesus being born in Bethlehem, in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Luke account Joseph and Mary travel from their home in Nazareth for the census to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger. Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore him; the family then returns to Nazareth. In Matthew, The Magi follow a star to Bethlehem, where the family are living, to bring gifts to Jesus, born the &quot;King of the Jews&quot;. King Herod massacres all males under two years old in Bethlehem in order to kill Jesus, but Jesus&#x27;s family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth. Over the centuries, biblical scholars have attempted to reconcile these differences , while modern scholarship mostly views them as legendary. Generally, they consider the issue of historicity as secondary, given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines.

== Ministry ==


The five major milestones in the New Testament narrative of the life of Jesus are his Baptism, Transfiguration, Crucifixion, Resurrection and Ascension.

In the gospels, the ministry of Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist, when he is about thirty years old. Jesus then begins preaching in Galilee and gathers disciples. After the proclamation of Jesus as Christ, three of the disciples witness his Transfiguration. After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there. Jesus makes a triumphal entry into Jerusalem, and there friction with the Pharisees increases and one of his disciples agrees to betray him for thirty pieces of silver.

In the gospels, the ministry of Jesus begins with his baptism in the countryside of Roman Judea and Transjordan, near the river Jordan, and ends in Jerusalem, following the Last Supper with his disciples. The Gospel of Luke () states that Jesus was &quot;about 30 years of age&quot; at the start of his ministry. A chronology of Jesus typically has the date of the start of his ministry estimated at 27–29 and the end in the range 30–36.

Jesus&#x27;s early Galilean ministry begins when after his Baptism he goes back to Galilee from his time in the Judean desert. In this early period he preaches around Galilee and recruits his first disciples who begin to travel with him and eventually form the core of the early Church as it is believed that the Apostles dispersed from Jerusalem to found the Apostolic Sees. The &quot;Major Galilean ministry&quot; which begins in Matthew 8 includes the commissioning of the Twelve Apostles, and covers most of the ministry of Jesus in Galilee. The &quot;Final Galilean ministry&quot; begins after the death of John the Baptist as Jesus prepares to go to Jerusalem.

In his later Judean ministry Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem through Judea. As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the later Perean ministry, about one third the way down from the Sea of Galilee (actually a fresh water lake) along the River Jordan, he returns to the area where he was baptized. The final ministry in Jerusalem is sometimes called the Passion Week and begins with Jesus&#x27; triumphal entry into Jerusalem. The gospels provide more details about the final ministry than the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem. In the gospel accounts, towards the end of the final week in Jerusalem, Jesus has the Last Supper with his disciples, and the next day is betrayed, arrested and tried. The trial ends in his crucifixion and death. Three days after his burial, he is resurrected and appears to his disciples and a multitude of his followers (numbering around 500 in total) over a 40-day period 1 Corinthians 15 NIV after which he ascends to Heaven.
=== Locations of Ministry ===

In the New Testament accounts, the principal locations for the ministry of Jesus were Galilee and Judea, with activities also taking place in surrounding areas such as Perea and Samaria.

The gospel narrative of the ministry of Jesus is traditionally separated into sections that have a geographical nature.

:* &quot;Galilean ministry&quot;: The ministry of Jesus begins when after his baptism, he returns to Galilee, and preaches in the synagogue of Capernaum. The first disciples of Jesus encounter him near the Sea of Galilee and his later Galilean ministry includes key episodes such as the Sermon on the Mount (with the Beatitudes) which form the core of his moral teachings. Jesus&#x27;s ministry in the Galilee area draws to an end with the death of John the Baptist.

:* &quot;Journey to Jerusalem&quot;: After the death of the Baptist, about half way through the gospels (approximately Matthew 17 and Mark 9) two key events take place that change the nature of the narrative by beginning the gradual revelation of his identity to his disciples: his proclamation as Christ by Peter and his transfiguration. After these events, a good portion of the gospel narratives deal with Jesus&#x27;s final journey to Jerusalem through Perea and Judea. As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem through Perea he returns to the area where he was baptized.

:* &quot;Final week in Jerusalem&quot;: The final part of Jesus&#x27;s ministry begins (Matthew 21 and Mark 11) with his triumphal entry into Jerusalem after the raising of Lazarus episode which takes place in Bethany. The gospels provide more details about the final portion than the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem which ends in his crucifixion. The New Testament accounts of the resurrection appearances of Jesus and his ascension are also in Judea.

===Baptism and temptation===
The Baptism of Jesus marks the beginning of his public ministry. This event is recorded in the Canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. In , rather than a direct narrative, John the Baptist bears witness to the episode.

In the New Testament, John the Baptist preached a &quot;baptism with water&quot;, not of forgiveness but of penance or repentance for the remission of sins (), and declared himself a forerunner to one who would baptize &#x27;with the Holy Spirit and with fire&#x27; (). In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus. Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John. The baptismal scene includes the Heavens opening, a dove-like descent of the Holy Spirit, and a voice from Heaven saying, &quot;This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.&quot;

Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned. James Dunn states that the historicity of the Baptism and crucifixion of Jesus &quot;command almost universal assent&quot;. Along with the crucifixion of Jesus most scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus.

The temptation of Jesus is detailed in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In these narratives, after being baptized, Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the Judaean Desert. During this time, Satan appeared to Jesus and tempted him. Jesus having refused each temptation, Satan departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus.

===Calling the disciples and early Ministry===
The calling of the first disciples is a key episode in the gospels which begins the active ministry of Jesus, and builds the foundation for the group of people who follow him, and later form the early Church. It takes place in , and on the Sea of Galilee. reports the first encounter with two of the disciples a little earlier in the presence of John the Baptist. Particularly in the Gospel of Mark the beginning of the ministry of Jesus and the call of the first disciples are inseparable.

In the Gospel of Luke (), the event is part of the first miraculous catch of fish and results in Peter as well as James and John, the sons of Zebedee, joining Jesus vocationally as disciples. The gathering of the disciples in follows the many patterns of discipleship that continue in the New Testament, in that who have received someone else&#x27;s witness become witnesses to Jesus themselves. Andrew follows Jesus because of the testimony of John the Baptist, Philip brings Nathanael and the pattern continues in where the Samaritan Woman at the Well testifies to the town people about Jesus.

This early period also includes the first miracle of Jesus in the Marriage at Cana, in the Gospel of John where Jesus and his disciples are invited to a wedding and when the wine runs out Jesus turns water into wine by performing a miracle.

===Ministry and miracles in Galilee===
Jesus&#x27;s activities in Galillee include a number of miracles and teachings. The beginnings of this period include The Centurion&#x27;s Servant (8:5–13) and Calming the storm (Matthew 8:23–27) both dealing with the theme of faith overcoming fear. In this period, Jesus also gathers disciples, e.g. calls Matthew. The Commissioning the twelve Apostles relates the initial selection of the twelve Apostles among the disciples of Jesus.

In the Mission Discourse, Jesus instructs the twelve apostles who are named in to carry no belongings as they travel from city to city and preach. Separately in relates the Seventy Disciples, in which Jesus appoints a larger number of disciples and sent them out in pairs with the &quot;Missionary&#x27;s Mandate&quot; to go into villages before Jesus arrives there.
After hearing of John the Baptist&#x27;s death, Jesus withdraws by boat privately to a solitary place near Bethsaida, where he addresses the crowds who had followed him on foot from the towns, and feeds them all by &quot;five loaves and two fish&quot; supplied by a boy. Following this, the gospels present the &quot;Walking on water&quot; episode in , and
 as an important step in developing the relationship between Jesus and his disciples, at this stage of his ministry. The episode emphasizes the importance of faith by stating that when he attempted to walk on water, Peter began to sink when he lost faith and became afraid, and at the end of the episode, the disciples increase their faith in Jesus and in Matthew 14:33 they say: &quot;Of a truth thou art the Son of God&quot;.

Major teachings in this period include the Discourse on Defilement in Matthew 15:1–20 and Mark 7:1–23 where in response to a complaint from the Pharisees Jesus states: &quot;What goes into a man&#x27;s mouth does not make him &#x27;unclean,&#x27; but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him &#x27;unclean..

Following this episode Jesus withdraws into the &quot;parts of Tyre and Sidon&quot; near the Mediterranean Sea where the Canaanite woman&#x27;s daughter episode takes place in and . This episode is an example of how Jesus emphasizes the value of faith, telling the woman: &quot;Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.&quot; The importance of faith is also emphasized in the Cleansing ten lepers episode in .

In the Gospel of Mark, after passing through Sidon Jesus enters the region of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities south east of Galilee, where the Healing the deaf mute miracle is reported in , where after the healing, the disciples say: &quot;He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.&quot; The episode is the last in a series of narrated miracles which builds up to Peter&#x27;s proclamation of Jesus as Christ in Mark 8:29.

===Proclamation as Christ===
The Confession of Peter refers to an episode in the New Testament in which in Jesus asks a question to his disciples: &quot;Who do you say that I am?&quot; Apostle Peter proclaims Jesus to be Christ – the expected Messiah. The proclamation is described in the three Synoptic Gospels: , and .

Peter&#x27;s Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in which Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among &quot;the multitudes&quot;, asking: &quot;Who do the multitudes say that I am?&quot; The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time. Jesus then asks his disciples about their own opinion: &quot;But who do you say that I am?&quot; Only Simon Peter answers him: &quot;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&quot;.

In Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates him as the rock of the Church, and states that he will give Peter &quot;the keys of the kingdom of heaven&quot;.

In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to Christology and the Confession of Peter, and Jesus&#x27;s acceptance of the title is a definitive statement for it in the New Testament narrative. While some of this passage may well be authentic, the reference to Jesus as Christ and Son of God is likely to be an addition by Matthew.

===Transfiguration===
The &quot;Transfiguration of Jesus&quot; is an episode in the New Testament narrative in which Jesus is transfigured and becomes radiant upon a mountain. The Synoptic Gospels (, , ) describe it, and refers to it. In these accounts, Jesus and three of his apostles go to a mountain (the Mount of Transfiguration). On the mountain, Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of light. Then the prophets Moses and Elijah appear next to him and he speaks with them. Jesus is then called &quot;Son&quot; by a voice in the sky, assumed to be God the Father, as in the Baptism of Jesus.

The Transfiguration is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels. This miracle is unique among others that appear in the Canonical gospels, in that the miracle happens to Jesus himself. Thomas Aquinas considered the Transfiguration &quot;the greatest miracle&quot; in that it complemented baptism and showed the perfection of life in Heaven. The Transfiguration is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being Baptism, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension. In the New Testament, Transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place for the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus himself as the connecting point, acting as the bridge between heaven and earth.

===Final journey to Jerusalem===

After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there. The Gospel of John states that during the final journey Jesus returned to the area where he was baptized, and states that &quot;many people believed in him beyond the Jordan&quot;, saying &quot;all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true&quot;. The area where Jesus was baptised is inferred as the vicinity of the Perea area, given the activities of the Baptist in Bethabara and Ænon in John and . Scholars generally assume that the route Jesus followed from Galilee to Jerusalem passed through Perea.

This period of ministry includes the Discourse on the Church in which Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains the role of his apostles in leading it. It includes the parables of The Lost Sheep and The Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18 which also refer to the Kingdom of Heaven. The general theme of the discourse is the anticipation of a future community of followers, and the role of his apostles in leading it. Addressing his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: &quot;what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven&quot;. The discourse emphasizes the importance of humility and self-sacrifice as the high virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches that in the Kingdom of God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social prominence and prestige.

At the end of this period, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode in in which Jesus brings Lazarus of Bethany back to life four days after his burial. In the Gospel of John, the raising of Lazarus is the climax of the &quot;seven signs&quot; which gradually confirm the identity of Jesus as the Son of God and the expected Messiah. It is also a &quot;pivotal episode&quot; which starts the chain of events that leads to the crowds seeking Jesus on his triumphal entry into Jerusalem – leading to the decision of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin to plan to kill Jesus.

=== Final week in Jerusalem ===

The description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called the Passion week) occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels. The narrative for that week starts by a description of the final entry into Jerusalem, and ends with his crucifixion.

The last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through Perea and Judea. Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension.

The week begins with the triumphal entry into Jerusalem. During the week of his &quot;final ministry in Jerusalem&quot;, Jesus visits the Temple, and has a conflict with the money changers about their use of the Temple for commercial purposes. This is followed by a debate with the priests and the elder in which his authority is questioned. One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, decides to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver.

Towards the end of the week, Jesus has the Last Supper with his disciples, during which he institutes the Eucharist, and prepares them for his departure in the Farewell Discourse. After the supper, Jesus is betrayed with a kiss while he is in Agony in the Garden, and is arrested. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and Peter denies him three times, as Jesus had predicted during the Last Supper. The final week that begins with his entry into Jerusalem, concludes with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday.

==Passion==

===Betrayal and arrest===

In , , and , immediately after the Last Supper, Jesus takes a walk to pray, Matthew and Mark identifying this place of prayer as Garden of Gethsemane.

Jesus is accompanied by Peter, John and James the Greater, whom he asks to &quot;remain here and keep watch with me.&quot; He moves &quot;a stone&#x27;s throw away&quot; from them, where he feels overwhelming sadness and says &quot;My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it.&quot; Only the Gospel of Luke mentions the details of the sweat of blood of Jesus and the visitation of the angel who comforts Jesus as he accepts the will of the Father. Returning to the disciples after prayer, he finds them asleep and in Matthew 26:40 he asks Peter: &quot;So, could you men not keep watch with me for an hour?&quot;

While in the Garden, Judas appears, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons. Judas gives Jesus a kiss to identify him to the crowd who then arrests Jesus. One of Jesus&#x27; disciples tries to stop them and uses a sword to cut off the ear of one of the men in the crowd. Luke states that Jesus miraculously healed the wound and John and Matthew state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that his disciples should not resist his arrest. In Jesus makes the well known statement: &quot;all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword&quot;.

===Justice===

In the narrative of the four canonical gospels after the betrayal and arrest of Jesus, he is taken to the Sanhedrin, a Jewish judicial body. Jesus is tried by the Sanhedrin, mocked and beaten and is condemned for making claims of being the Son of God. He is then taken to Pontius Pilate and the Jewish elders ask Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus—accusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews.
After questioning, with few replies provided by Jesus, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus innocent, but the crowd insists on punishment. Pilate then orders Jesus&#x27; crucifixion. Although the Gospel accounts vary with respect to various details, they agree on the general character and overall structure of the trials of Jesus.

After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus is taken to &quot;Pilate&#x27;s court&quot; in the &quot;praetorium&quot;. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas&#x27; jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had previously ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, because he had been hoping to observe one of the miracles of Jesus. However, Jesus says nothing in response to Herod&#x27;s questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity. After questioning Jesus and receiving no replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.

After Jesus&#x27; return from Herod&#x27;s court, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus to be innocent of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governor and Pilate decided to publicly wash his hands as not being privy to Jesus&#x27; death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus&#x27; case rather than as a judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.

=== Crucifixion and burial ===

Jesus&#x27; crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels, and is attested to by other sources of that age (e.g. Josephus and Tacitus), and is regarded as a historical event.

After the trials, Jesus made his way to Calvary (the path is traditionally called Via Dolorosa) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by Simon of Cyrene, the Romans compelling him to do so. In Jesus tells the women in multitude of people following him not to cry for him but for themselves and their children. Once at Calvary (Golgotha), Jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink — usually offered as a form of painkiller. Matthew&#x27;s and Mark&#x27;s gospels state that he refused this.

The soldiers then crucified Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus&#x27; head on the cross was the inscription King of the Jews, and the soldiers and those passing by mocked him about the title. Jesus was crucified between two convicted thieves, one of whom rebuked Jesus, while the other defended him. Each gospel has its own account of Jesus&#x27; last words, comprising the seven last sayings on the cross. In Jesus entrusts his mother to the disciple he loved and in he states: &quot;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do&quot;, usually interpreted as his forgiveness of the Roman soldiers and the others involved.

In the three synoptic gospels, various supernatural events accompany the crucifixion, including darkness of the sky, an earthquake, and (in Matthew) the resurrection of saints. The tearing of the temple veil, upon the death of Jesus, is referenced in the synoptic. The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus&#x27; legs, as they did to the other two men crucified (breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process), as Jesus was dead already; this further fulfilled prophecy, as noted in John 19:36, &quot;For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.&quot; One of the soldiers pierced the side of Jesus with a lance and blood and water flowed out. In , impressed by the events, the Roman centurion calls Jesus the Son of God.

Following Jesus&#x27; death on Friday, Joseph of Arimathea asked the permission of Pilate to remove the body. The body was removed from the cross, was wrapped in a clean cloth and buried in a new rock-hewn tomb, with the assistance of Nicodemus. In the Jews go to Pilate the day after the crucifixion and ask for guards for the tomb and also seal the tomb with a stone as well as the guard, to be sure the body remains there.

==Resurrection and Ascension==

The gospels state that the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a Sunday), the followers of Jesus encounter him risen from the dead, after his tomb was discovered to be empty. The New Testament does not include an account of the &quot;moment of resurrection&quot; and in the Eastern Church icons do not depict that moment, but show the Myrrhbearers, and depict scenes of salvation.

The resurrected Jesus then appears to his followers that day and a number of times thereafter, delivers sermons and has supper with some of them, before ascending to Heaven. The gospels of Luke and Mark include brief mentions of the Ascension, but the main references to it are elsewhere in the New Testament.

The four gospels have variations in their account of the resurrection of Jesus and his appearances, but there are four points at which all gospels converge: the turning of the stone that had closed the tomb, the visit of the women on &quot;the first day of the week;&quot; that the risen Jesus chose first to appear to women (or a woman) and told them (her) to inform the other disciples; the prominence of Mary Magdalene in the accounts. Variants have to do with the precise time the women visited the tomb, the number and identity of the women; the purpose of their visit; the appearance of the messenger(s)—angelic or human; their message to the women; and the response of the women.

In , , and his resurrection is announced and explained to the followers who arrive there early in the morning by either one or two beings (either men or angels) dressed in bright robes who appear in or near the tomb. The gospel accounts vary as to who arrived at the tomb first, but they are women and are instructed by the risen Jesus to inform the other disciples. All four accounts include Mary Magdalene and three include Mary, mother of James. The accounts of , indicate that Jesus appeared to the Magdalene first, and states that she was among the Myrrhbearers who informed the disciples about the resurrection. In , to explain the empty tomb, the Jewish elders bribe the soldiers who had guarded the tomb to spread the rumor that Jesus&#x27; disciples took his body.

===Resurrection appearances===


In Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene soon after his resurrection. At first she does not recognize him and thinks that he is the gardener. When he says her name, she recognizes him yet he tells her Noli me Tangere, do not touch me, &quot;for I am not yet ascended to my Father.&quot;

Later that day, at evening, Jesus appears to the disciples and shows them the wounds in his hands and his side in . Thomas the Apostle is not present at that meeting and later expresses doubt about the resurrection of Jesus. As Thomas is expressing his doubts, in the well known Doubting Thomas episode in Jesus appears to him and invites him to put his finger into the holes made by the wounds in Jesus&#x27; hands and side. Thomas then professes his faith in Jesus. In , in the Great Commission Jesus appears to his followers on a mountain in Galilee and calls on them to baptize all nations in the name of the &quot;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit&quot;.

 describes the Road to Emmaus appearance in which while a disciple named Cleopas was walking towards Emmaus with another disciple, they met Jesus, who later has supper with them. has a similar account that describes the appearance of Jesus to two disciples while they were walking in the country, at about the same time in the Gospel narrative. In the Miraculous catch of 153 fish Jesus appears to his disciples on the Sea of Galilee, and thereafter Jesus encourages the Apostle Peter to serve his followers. In , the Apostle Paul references an appearance of Jesus to &quot;more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at the same time,&quot; along with an appearance to &quot;James&quot; separate from those to the other apostles.

===Ascension===

The &quot;Ascension of Jesus&quot; (anglicized from the Vulgate Latin section title: &quot;Ascensio Iesu&quot;) is the Christian teaching found in the New Testament that the resurrected Jesus was taken up to heaven in his resurrected body, in the presence of eleven of his apostles, occurring 40 days after the resurrection. In the biblical narrative, an angel tells the watching disciples that Jesus&#x27; second coming will take place in the same manner as his ascension.

The canonical gospels include two brief descriptions of the Ascension of Jesus in and , in which it takes place on Easter Sunday. A more detailed account of Jesus&#x27; bodily Ascension into the clouds is given in the Acts of the Apostles () where the narrative starts with the account of Jesus&#x27; appearances after his resurrection and describes the event as taking place forty days later.

Acts 1:9–12 specifies the location of the Ascension as the &quot;mount called Olivet&quot; near Jerusalem. states that Jesus: &quot;showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God&quot;. After giving a number of instructions to the apostles
 describes the Ascension as follows: &quot;And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.&quot; Following this two men clothed in white appear and tell the apostles that Jesus will return in the same manner as he was taken, and the apostles return to Jerusalem.

In , and (where Jesus as taken up in glory) the Ascension is spoken of as an accepted fact, while Hebrews 10:12 describes Jesus as seated in heaven.

<text>George Jackson Churchward (31 January 1857 – 19 December 1933) was an English railway engineer, and was chief mechanical engineer of the Great Western Railway (GWR) in the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1922.

==Early life==
Churchward was born at Rowes Farm, Stoke Gabriel, Devon, where his ancestors (the senior line residing at Hill House; his paternal grandfather, Matthew, was the younger son of the head of the family) had been squires since 1457. He was the first son in a family of three sons and two daughters, brothers John (b.1858) and James (b.1860) and sisters Mary (b.1863) and Adelina (b.1870). His father, George Churchward, a farmer, married his cousin, Adelina Mary, daughter of Thomas Churchward, of Paignton, Devon, a corn and cider merchant. He was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School, contained within the Mansion House on Fore Street, Totnes, Devon. His father&#x27;s cousin, Frederick Churchward, head of the family, arranged private tuition at Hill House during the school holidays.

==Early career==

He started his engineering training in 1871 with John Wright, the Locomotive Superintendent of the South Devon, Cornwall and West Cornwall railways, at the Newton Abbot works of the South Devon Railway. While there, he and his fellow pupil Robert Neville-Grenville developed a steam-powered car based on the boiler from a Merryweather fire-engine.

When the GWR took over the South Devon Railway in 1876, Churchward had to move to the Swindon Works. In 1877, at the end of his pupilage, he moved to the drawing office, where he worked with &quot;Young Joe&quot; Armstrong to develop a vacuum brake. He was appointed Inspecting Engineer in June 1882, and six months later became assistant to the Carriage Works Manager, James Holden, taking over as Manager on Holden&#x27;s departure in 1885. Ten years later he became Assistant Works Manager, and soon after Manager, of the locomotive works, and in 1897 became William Dean&#x27;s Chief Assistant and natural successor.

After 5 years as Chief Assistant, during most of which time Dean was ill and delegating much of his design work to Churchward, in 1902 he formally succeeded Dean as Locomotive Superintendent. In 1900 he became the first mayor of Swindon.

==Chief Mechanical Engineer==

In the 19th and early 20th century, railway companies were fiercely competitive. Speed meant revenue and speed was dependent on engineering. Churchward delivered to the GWR from Swindon a series of class-leading and innovative locomotives. Arguably, from the early 1900s to the 1920s the Great Western&#x27;s 2-cylinder and 4-cylinder 4-6-0 designs were substantially superior to any class of locomotive of the other British railway companies. On one occasion, the GWR&#x27;s directors confronted Churchward, and demanded to know why the London and North Western Railway were able to build three 4-6-0 locomotives for the price of two of Churchward&#x27;s &quot;Stars&quot;. Churchward allegedly gave a terse response: &quot;Because one of mine could pull two of their bloody things backwards!&quot;

The biggest engineering challenge of the GWR&#x27;s operations was travelling over the South Devon Banks, a series of steep inclines linking Exeter and Plymouth in Devon, on the GWR&#x27;s most important route. Although speed was a key competitive driver across the whole GWR route, the South Devon Banks rewarded sure-footed locomotive designs with good adhesion. The largest opportunity to any GWR CME was the resulting large loading gauge legacy of the GWR&#x27;s conversion from Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge track to standard gauge, allowing for wider and higher designs than any of the other later Big Four railway companies.

===Philosophy===
Churchward&#x27;s design philosophy followed a number of streams of development, for which he thoroughly researched both competitor UK designs, as well as European and North American locomotives.

Following principles based on Belgian inventor Alfred Belpaire, Churchward preferred free steaming boilers. This resulted in his use of a Belpaire-style rectangular firebox, which due to its greater surface area for evaporation was less prone to foaming and carry over of water to the cylinders. Churchward inherited from Dean a series of parallel cylindrical boilers, but by applying mathematical principles to the flow of boiler water, quickly improved the flow of steam by adopting tapered boilers, which give their largest area to the point of highest steam production. Churchward then dispensed with the need for a large dome to collect steam, using instead top-feed of water supply from injectors, which together with top-fitted clack boxes hidden within a brass &quot;bonnet&quot; minimised boiler stress.

Churchward experimented with compounding, a principle development for marine engines which was widely adopted in European locomotive design. Although through his experimentation Churchward found little difference in operation in terms of the total power developed in compounding locomotives, the use of European locomotives in his trial led to his adoption of higher pressure boilers, and drive power split between two axles on four cylinder designs.

His third stream of philosophy was based around piston valves. Churchward&#x27;s valves were 50% larger than anything seen in the UK to that time, travelled 50% further, and were designed to be concealed. The result gave the minimum loss of pressure as steam passed to the cylinders.

Churchward&#x27;s resulting locomotive designs excluded trailing wheels, which maximised adhesion on the South Devon Banks. He was an early adopter in UK locomotive design of superheating, made efficient through the GWR&#x27;s exclusive use of the high calorific-value steam coal from the South Wales Coalfield. He also adopted large bearing surfaces to reduce wear, something common in North America.

Churchward is credited with introducing to Britain several refinements from American and French steam locomotive practice. Among these were the tapered boiler and the casting of cylinders and saddles together, in halves. His choice of outside cylinders for express locomotives was also not standard in Britain for that time. Many elements of British practice were retained, of course. His locomotives for the most part used British plate frames, and the crew was accommodated in typical British fashion. The selection of a domeless boiler was more common to Britain than to the US.

===1901 outline scheme===
In 1901 Churchward produced a scheme of six different locomotive types based on a few standard parts. All would have cylinders with diameter and stroke, piston valves of diameter, and all leading or trailing wheels would be diameter. Locomotive classes corresponding to all these proposals were eventually built, with some differences in the dimensions.

===Notable locomotives===
====GWR 4-4-0 3700 Class====
In September 1902 Churchward had a member of the Atbara Class, no. 3405 &quot;Mauritius&quot;, reboilered with a Belpaire firebox and the first use of a tapered boiler on the GWR. The boiler became the prototype for Churchward&#x27;s GWR Standard No. 4 boiler. This experiment led to the design of the City class, with the first outshopped from Swindon in March 1903, No. 3433 &quot;City of Bath&quot;. It was fitted with the final form of the Standard No.4 boiler, with slightly curved sides and a tapered top to the firebox. The class soon became one of the most famous classes of locomotives in the world, when &quot;City of Truro&quot; became the first engine in the world to haul a train at 100 miles per hour in 1904 (although unauthenticated).

====Experimental 4-6-0 locomotives====

In 1901, whilst still assistant to Dean, the GWR board approved Churchward&#x27;s plan to build a series of two cylinder 4-6-0 locomotives.

No. 100 was out-shopped in February 1902, named &quot;Dean&quot; (later &quot;William Dean&quot;) in June 1902 to mark the latter&#x27;s retirement. It incorporated a domeless parallel boiler, raised Belpaire firebox, diameter outside cylinders with piston stroke, and boiler pressure of . The piston valves were driven by rocking levers actuated by the expansion link of Stephenson valve gear – this particular design was only used on no. 100.

No. 98 was out-shopped in March 1903, to a similar design but with a taper boiler, re-designed valve gear layout and cylinders, and a shorter wheelbase. Valve diameters were increased from to .

No. 171 was out-shopped in December 1903, incorporating the improvements to No. 98 but with a boiler and minor amendments to the heating surface and grate area. Built as a 4-6-0, in October 1904 it was converted to a 4-4-2 to enable better comparison with the performance of the French de Glehn compound; it was reconverted to 4-6-0 in July 1907. Named &quot;Albion&quot; in 1904, it received a superheated boiler in 1910.

====Experimental French locomotives====
On succeeding Dean, the GWR board authorised Churchward to purchase three French de Glehn-du Bousquet four-cylinder compound locomotives, in order to evaluate the benefits of compounding. Similar to the Paris-Orleans Railway&#x27;s 3001 class and built by Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques, the first locomotive no.102 &quot;La France&quot; was delivered in 1903, with Nos. 103 and 104 purchased in 1905. The locomotives had two high pressure cylinders fitted between the frames, and two low pressure cylinders outside.

Each was initially fitted with a standard-pattern GWR chimney, a GWR tender and had their numbers positioned in GWR fashion on the sides of the cab. They were then each placed into service to evaluate performance, and then following engine crew feedback were modified to test other aspects of Churchward&#x27;s design experimentation and philosophy. In 1926, the three locomotives were based at Oxford shed. In operational practice, compounding did not provide any significant improvement in either performance or economy compared to No 171 &quot;Albion&quot;, Churchward&#x27;s prototype 4-6-0, which was converted to a 4-4-2 specifically for direct comparison with them. A further 13 engines in the Saint class were also originally built as 4-4-2s.

====GWR 4-6-0 2900 Saint class====

Experimental 4-6-0 No. 171 formed the basis of the GWR 2900 &quot;Saint&quot; Class. It appeared in four production series built between 1905 and 1913, each of which differed in dimensions. There were also differences between members of each series in terms of the boilers used, wheel arrangement (Churchward was unsure of the choice between 4-4-2 and 4-6-0), and arrangements for superheating.

The locomotives performed well as passenger locomotives over all the long-distance routes of the GWR and on all but the fastest express trains until they gradually became displaced to secondary services by the Castle Class in the late 1920s and 1930s. However, the driving wheels limited their usefulness on freight trains. Churchward had recognized this limitation by the introduction of his GWR 4700 Class 2-8-0 design with driving wheels in 1919, intended for express goods trains. However, Churchward&#x27;s successor Charles Collett felt that a smaller-wheeled version of the &#x27;Saint&#x27; class could form the basis of a successful mixed-traffic class of locomotives. He therefore rebuilt No. 2925 &quot;Saint Martin&quot; with driving wheels to become the prototype of his successful Hall Class locomotives. Thus the 2900 class became a template for later GWR 2-cylinder 4-6-0 classes including the Modified Hall, Grange, Manor and County classes, all of which were of the same basic design.

The class incorporated many revolutionary advances which were influential in British locomotive design for the next fifty years. According to The Great Western Society, &#x27;Saint&#x27; class locomotives &quot;represented one of the most important steps forward in railway traction of the 20th century&quot;, and they &quot;are now acknowledged to have had a profound influence on almost every aspect of subsequent steam locomotive development&quot;.

====Standard locomotive classes====

The Saints and their derived classes were only part of Churchward&#x27;s scheme. Based on a limited number of standard parts—including boilers, cylinders, wheels and valve gear—he planned a range of locomotives for duties such as express passenger, mixed traffic, heavy freight and suburban trains, with both tender and tank versions. He began to construct some of his designs immediately; he also extended the range of designs as the demands of the business required, producing the 4300 Moguls and 4700 express freight engines. His mixed-traffic design did not appear until Collett built the Granges in 1936.

====GWR 4-6-0 4000 Class====

The Great Western Railway 4000 or Star class were 4-cylinder 4-6-0 passenger locomotives introduced from early 1907. The prototype was built in May 1906 as a 4-4-2 Atlantic (but later converted to 4-6-0). The design benefited from experience gained from the &#x27;Saint&#x27; class and the De Glehn engines. The locomotives proved to be very successful, handling the heaviest long-distance express trains, reaching top speeds of , and they established the design principles for GWR 4-cylinder classes over the next twenty-five years.

====The Great Bear Pacific====

GWR 111 &quot;The Great Bear&quot; was the first 4-6-2 (Pacific) locomotive used on a railway in Great Britain, the only one of that type ever built by the GWR, which is today seen as Churchward&#x27;s notable failure in locomotive design. No clear GWR commercial reason existed for the design, so it is concluded by many as a further Churchward experiment, considered to explore what came beyond the Star Class when train loads increased beyond their capability. Basically a developed Star class locomotive, the larger boiler over trailing wheels allowed a firebox surface of , a 17.5% increase in size compared to the Star Class. It was also built with a Swindon No. 1 superheater.

Due to its weight and axle load, the locomotive was restricted to the Paddington to Bristol main line, mainly under Paddington driver Thomas Blackall, originally from Aston Tirrold, Oxfordshire. Despite later experimental developments, in service the performance of &quot;The Great Bear&quot; proved to be disappointing, and not a significant improvement on existing classes. The excellent performance of the Star Class and advent of the First World War brought a stop to further experimentation without significant improvement.

Although not a technical success, &quot;The Great Bear&quot; was considered the company&#x27;s flagship locomotive from its introduction until Churchward&#x27;s retirement in 1922. With the introduction of 4073 &quot;Caerphilly Castle&quot; in 1923 with a higher tractive effort, the locomotive ceased to have any publicity value and became an embarrassment. Due for heavy repairs in January 1924, it was withdrawn from service by Churchward&#x27;s successor Charles Collett. It emerged from Swindon later that year as a 4-6-0 Castle Class, given the name &quot;Viscount Churchill&quot;.

===Legacy===
In 1922 Churchward retired, and C. B. Collett inherited his legacy of excellent, standardised designs. These designs influenced British locomotive practice to the end of steam. Major classes built by the LMS and even British Railways 50 years later are clearly developments of Churchward&#x27;s basic designs. The LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 and the BR standard class 5 are both derived from his Saint class early examples of which date to 1902.

BR Western Region class 47 locomotive no. D1664 (later 47079) was named &quot;George Jackson Churchward&quot; upon delivery in February 1965. It was renamed &quot;G. J. Churchward&quot; in March 1979, and the name was removed in October 1987.

==Death==

Although Churchward had retired in 1922, he continued to live in a GWR-owned house near to the line at Swindon, and he retained his interest in the company&#x27;s affairs. He never married. On 19 December 1933, now with poor eyesight and hard of hearing, he was inspecting a defectively-bedded sleeper on the down through line, when he was struck and killed by a Paddington to Fishguard express, pulled by No. 4085 &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot;. The locomotive was of the GWR Castle class, a successful design by Charles Collett derived from Churchward&#x27;s &quot;Star&quot; class.

In Churchward&#x27;s will of 4 October 1933 he bequeathed various sums of money to his staff, including his gardener, housekeeper, maidservant, parlour maid, assistant gardeners and two friends. He awarded his chauffeur £4,000 along with 2 lathes with various tools and accessories including guns, motor cars and accessories, fishing rods and tackle and wearing apparel. The majority of his £60,000 plus estate was divided equally between his two sisters, Mary and Adelina.
He is buried in the churchyard of Christ Church in Old Town, Swindon. His grave is marked by a polished black marble headstone with a kerb which was designated as a listed building in 1986.

The home ground of the football team in Churchward&#x27;s birthplace of Stoke Gabriel, Stoke Gabriel A.F.C., is named the G.J. Churchward Memorial Ground in honour of his legacy.

<text>The first Dolphin was a cutter in the Continental Navy.

&quot;Dolphin&quot; was purchased in February 1777 at Dover, England, and outfitted for use in the Continental Navy at Nantes, France. She was placed under the command of Lieutenant Samuel Nicholson and sailed from St. Auzeau, France on 28 May 1777 with and , in a squadron commanded by Captain Lambert Wickes in &quot;Reprisal&quot;.

During a cruise off Ireland this squadron captured and sent into port eight prizes, sank seven, and released three, throwing British shipping circles into an uproar. A 74-gun British warship gave chase to the squadron and &quot;Reprisal&quot; drew him off to enable the other ships to reach port safely. &quot;Dolphin&quot; arrived at Saint-Malo, France, 27 June 1777 where she was repaired and converted into a packet ship. On 19 September she put into the Loire for further repairs.

Owing to diplomatic protests by the British that American vessels should not be allowed to use neutral ports to prey upon British shipping, &quot;Dolphin&quot; was seized by the British.

<doc id="1168024" wikidata="Q5287211" url="?curid=1168024" title="Dockapps">
<text>Dockapps are computer programs that have a tiny graphical interface, the size of an icon. They typically reside in a part of the user interface known as the dock, alongside icons of applications that are inactive.

Their small size makes dockapps well-suited for monitoring applications that update the icon window with low-priority information. Some applications are:
*Displaying CPU usage
*Displaying computer temperatures
*Displaying network or disk-usage statistics
*Displaying clocks, calendars, moon phases, or weather reports

==Support==
Support for dockapps has been present in Window Maker since
1998.
In early 1999 a
Dock App Wharehouse hosts 54 open-source dockapps. Other window managers quickly followed. In AfterStep in the
wharf.
In Blackbox and derivatives in the slit.
As of 2024, dockapps.net hosts 211 open-source dockapps in 14 categories. Usually their names start with &#x27;wm&#x27; to distinguish them from non-dockapp applications.

Dedicated software libraries exist to support developing a dockapp:
*libdockapp parses the command line and does events, pixmaps and shapes.
*General Applet Interface is one API for Dockapp, Gnome 2 panel and Rox panel.
*Ruby-DockApp is a Ruby library for making DockApps. 

== Protocol ==

For an application window to be recognized as a dockapp, a protocol must be followed. The ICCCM specifies the WM_HINTS property, which applications must set. It communicates the desired initial state of a window to the window manager. Common values are Normal and Iconic. For a dockapp, that state must be set to Withdrawn. The WM_HINTS also specifies the icon window to be used. Commonly, it has a dimension of 64 by 64 pixels.

In 2010, a second method was 
added to Window Maker. When the Class part of the WM_CLASS property is set to &#x27;DockApp&#x27;, the window is also recognized as a dockapp. The motivation was that in GTK it is impossible to create windows in the Withdrawn state. This method was also adopted by other window managers, like AfterStep, Fluxbox, Ion, Openbox and IceWM.
