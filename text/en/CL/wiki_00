<text>Virginia Hey (born 19 June 1952) is an Australian actress, known for her role as Pa&#x27;u Zotoh Zhaan in the science fiction television series &quot;Farscape&quot;, playing the &quot;Warrior Woman&quot; in &quot;Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior&quot;, and various roles in television drama series, such as lawyer Jennifer St James in &quot;E Street&quot;.

==Career ==
Hey began her career as a fashion model after being discovered at a bus stop by &quot;POL&quot; magazine editor Wendy Adnam. Hey appeared on several magazine covers and started her acting career in television advertisements (57 in all), television dramas and films in Australia and the UK.

In 1979, Hey appeared in live TV performances with The Buggles for their song &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot;, including on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and on German television. However, she does not appear in the official music video. (The official video for the same song is remembered best for being the first music video broadcast on MTV in 1981.) Hey appeared in the Mama&#x27;s Boys rock video for their hit single &quot;Needle in the Groove&quot; in 1985.

Her film and television credits include the Warrior Woman in &quot;Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior&quot; and General Pushkin&#x27;s girlfriend in the Bond film &quot;The Living Daylights&quot;. She is well known for the role of the blue-skinned alien priestess Zotoh Zhaan in &quot;Farscape&quot;, for which she was nominated for Best Supporting Actress on Television by the Saturn Awards. She left the show early in the third season for health and personal reasons: the prosthetic makeup worn over her head and chest to achieve Zhaan&#x27;s appearance and the stress of the long filming days caused her kidneys to bleed, subsequently causing a decline in her health, and she grew tired of having to shave her head and eyebrows for the role.

Hey has also appeared in various Australian soap operas including &quot;Prisoner (Cell Block H)&quot; as Leigh Templar, &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Beth Travers, &quot;E Street&quot; as Jennifer St. James, and &quot;Pacific Drive&quot; as Margaux Hayes.

Since leaving &quot;Farscape&quot;, Hey has started her own company, White Flower Lei, which manufactures perfumes and soaps. She currently resides in the UK.

===Meditation===
Hey teaches meditation across the United States and UK, and is certified in natural therapy.

<text>Rama Records was a record label founded by George Goldner in 1953 in New York City. It recorded doo-wop groups such as The Crows and The Harptones.

Its third release was the one-hit wonder, the song &quot;Gee,&quot; by the doo-wop group, The Crows Goldner was able to improve production techniques without destroying the innocent sounds of the early groups. &quot;Gee&quot; has been called the first rock and roll record because it was an original recording, unlike &quot;Crying in the Chapel&quot; by the Orioles.

The label was eventually sold to Roulette Records.

<doc id="1150356" wikidata="Q4051478" url="?curid=1150356" title="Tico Records">
<text>Tico Records was a New York City record label that was founded in 1948, and was known for 30 years as the &quot;home of the recorded mambo&quot;. It was originally owned by George Goldner and later acquired by Morris Levy and incorporated into Roulette Records. It specialized in Latin music and was significant for introducing artists such as Ismael Rivera, Ray Barretto and Tito Puente. In 1974, it was sold to Fania Records and stopped issuing new releases in 1981; however, the label&#x27;s extensive catalog continues to be reissued under the Tico Records name.

Nightclub owner Goldner started Tico Records in the 1940s after realizing there was no record label dedicated to Latin ballroom dancing music. In 2023, a compilation album, &quot;Hit The Bongo! The Latin Soul Of Tico Records&quot;, was released to celebrate the label&#x27;s 75th anniversary.

<doc id="1150358" wikidata="Q1873857" url="?curid=1150358" title="Lymphoblast">
<text>A lymphoblast is a modified naive lymphocyte with altered cell morphology. It occurs when the lymphocyte is activated by an antigen and increased in volume by nucleus and cytoplasm growth as well as new mRNA and protein synthesis. The lymphoblast then starts dividing two to four times every 24 hours for three to five days, with a single lymphoblast making approximately 1000 clones of its original naive lymphocyte, with each clone sharing the originally unique antigen specificity. Finally the dividing cells differentiate into effector cells, known as plasma cells (for B cells), cytotoxic T cells, and helper T cells.

Lymphoblasts can also refer to immature cells which typically differentiate to form mature lymphocytes. Normally, lymphoblasts are found in the bone marrow, but in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblasts proliferate uncontrollably and are found in large numbers in the peripheral blood.

The size is between 10 and 20 μm.

Although commonly lymphoblast refers to a precursor cell in the maturation of leukocytes, the usage of this term is sometimes inconsistent. The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium defines a lymphoblast as &quot;A lymphocyte that has become larger after being stimulated by an antigen. Lymphoblasts look like immature lymphocytes, and were once thought to be precursor cells.&quot; Commonly, when speaking about leukemia, &quot;blast&quot; is used as an abbreviation for lymphoblasts.

Lymphoblasts can be distinguished microscopically from myeloblasts by having less distinct nucleoli, more condensed chromatin, and an absence of cytoplasmic granules. However these morphologic distinctions are not absolute and a definitive diagnosis relies on antibody immunostaining for the presence of unique cluster of differentiation receptors.

<doc id="1150363" wikidata="Q17032342" url="?curid=1150363" title="Wabash Valley College">
<text>Wabash Valley College (WVC) is a public community college in Mount Carmel, Illinois. It is part of the Illinois Eastern Community College (IECC) district.

== History ==
Wabash Valley College was founded independently in 1960 by the local community school district. In 1969, it joined with Olney Central College to create a two college district, a relationship that was expanded in May of that year with the addition of Lincoln Trail College. In October 1969, a $5.9 million bond issue was approved to finance the construction of permanent campuses for each of the three colleges. In 1978, IECC became a four college district with the addition of Frontier Community College.

== Academics ==
=== Radio/TV &amp; Digital Media Program ===
Students in the Radio/TV &amp; Digital Media Program operate a college radio station at 89.1  MHz, &quot;WVJC The Bash&quot; that reaches as far east as Perry County, Indiana and as far west as Clinton County, Illinois that plays alternative music, manned by student DJs. The station is also streamed online. In addition to alternative rock, the station is also home to Wabash Valley College Warrior sports play by play coverage. WVJC has RDS.

The program also operates a local cable TV channel - News Channel 15 which can be seen on the Sparklight cable TV system in 8 counties in southeastern Illinois including Edwards, Hamilton, Jasper, Lawrence, Richland, Wabash, Wayne, and White counties. Programming on News Channel 15 includes local high school and college sporting events, local events, and a local newscast which airs weeknights at 5:30, 6:00, 6:30, 10, and 10:30 p.m. The station also covers breaking news and severe weather. The channel is also available through the Cablecast Screenweave channel on Roku and Apple TV smart devices.

==Athletics==

Wabash Valley College&#x27;s athletic teams compete in the top division of the National Junior College Athletic Association in the Great Rivers Athletic Conference.

===Baseball===
The Warriors are perennially a national powerhouse, grabbing a reputation as one of the best junior college programs in the country. At &quot;The Bash&quot;, the players are greatly encouraged to give back to their community in more ways than winning baseball games. The baseball program has had players &quot;adopt-a-highway&quot;, &quot;walk for diabetes&quot;, read to elementary classrooms, rake leaves for the elderly and all-around help with the Wabash Valley College and its campus whenever labor is needed. Other community services the Wabash Valley College Baseball program has offered and continues to offer its support by volunteer help given to the local Wabash Valley YMCA. The baseball players referee children&#x27;s flag football games, soccer games, and basketball games. The idea behind this type of volunteer work is that the local YMCA will not need to spend a large amount of its funds on referee fees and can use that money for other more important or improvement projects that can help the YMCA be more effective and better equipped to give children the opportunities to be more active and build character. In 2022 the Warriors finished 4th at the JUCO World Series in Grand Junction, Co. The Warriors returned the following year in 2023 and finished 2nd in the JUCO World Series.

===Men&#x27;s Basketball===
The men&#x27;s basketball team at Wabash Valley College has known a number of success throughout the years. The team throughout its history has had a number of prolific coaches, including: Mark Coomes, Jay Harrington, Jay Spoonhour (under which the men won a national championship) and Dan Sparks, who was inducted into the National Junior College Athletic Association basketball hall of fame. They have won 12 Great Rivers Athletic Conference championships and 14 Region XXIV championships, and an NCJAA National Championship.

<doc id="1150364" wikidata="Q7107520" url="?curid=1150364" title="Ossington Street">
<text>Ossington Street is a quiet one-way street in London, W2, leading from Moscow Road at its north end to the Bayswater Road / Notting Hill Gate at its south end.

Ossington Street forms part of the border between the boroughs City of Westminster and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, with the east side of the street belonging to Westminster and the west side to Kensington. It is possible that the street was named after Viscount Ossington.

Despite its minor nature, Ossington Street is one of the more notable &#x27;runs&#x27; of The Knowledge in the area, as a route for taxi drivers to get from Westbourne Grove to Notting Hill Gate.

The nearest Tube station to Ossington Street is Notting Hill Gate, followed by Queensway and Bayswater.

== History ==

Ossington Street was originally laid out from the then Uxbridge Road to Moscow Road on part of Gravel Pit field in the 1830s. It was known at the time as Victoria Grove, and was renamed to Ossington Street in 1873 and transferred to Kensington. (The renaming of Victoria Grove as Ossington Street took place a year after John Evelyn Denison, a former Speaker of the House of Commons, was created 1st Viscount Ossington and retired.) The buildings to the west side were in the form of terraced cottages of two storeys and basement, with a mews behind. Victoria Grove Mews retains its name to this day.

Several of the terraced houses to the south were leased to William Ward, a Marylebone builder, who also filled a space along the Uxbridge Road between Victoria Grove and the then boundary of Paddington with an inn and five shops, nos. 1 to 6 Wellington Terrace, around 1840.

By 1865, almost all of Bayswater had been built up and the only sites for infilling were south of Moscow Road and in particular along the east side of Victoria Grove. This was built up as Palace Court, whose west side backs on Ossington Street and offers some of the most interesting late Victorian domestic architecture in the area.

<doc id="1150365" wikidata="Q1420806" url="?curid=1150365" title="Reel">
<text>A reel is a tool used to store elongated and flexible objects (e.g. yarns/cords, ribbons, cables, hoses, etc.) by wrapping the material around a cylindrical core known as a &quot;spool&quot;. Many reels also have flanges (known as the &quot;rims&quot;) around the ends of the spool to help retain the wrapped material and prevent unwanted slippage off the ends. In most cases, the reel spool is hollow in order to pass an axle and allow it to spin like a wheel, a winding process known as &quot;reeling&quot;, which can be done by manually turning the reel with handles or cranks, or by machine-powered rotating via (typically electric) motors.

==Construction==
The size of the core is dependent on several factors. A smaller core will obviously allow more material to be stored in a given space. However, there is a limit to how tightly the stored material can be wound without damaging it and this limits how small the core can be.

Other issues affecting the core size include:

* Mechanical strength of the core (especially with big reels)
* Acceptable turning speed (for a given rate of material moving on or off the reel a smaller core will mean that an almost empty reel has to turn faster)
* any functional requirements of the core e.g.
** For a reel that must be mechanically turned the size of the grips that mount it on the mechanical turning device.
** The size of the mountings needed to support the core during unwinding.
** Anything mounted on the cores (e.g. the sockets on an extension reel)

With material such as photographic film that is flat and long but is relatively wide, the material generally is stored in successive single layers. In cases where the material is more uniform in cross-section (for example, a cable), the material may be safely wound around a reel that is wider than its width. In this case, several windings are needed to create a layer on the reel.

==Uses==

Examples of reel usage include:
* Hose reels that store and prevent kinking of fire hoses or garden hoses
* Bobbins that hold yarns or threads for sewing machines and weavers
* Retractable tape measures
* Fishing reels that store and pull in fishing lines when angling
* Film reels that carry film stocks
* Many audio recordings of the late 20th century (and some today) use reel-to-reel magnetic tape
* Kite lines are frequently operated from reels
* Specialized reels for holding tow line for hang glider, glider, and sailplane launching
* Laying of communications cables use giant reels
* Winches that wind cables/chains for sails or anchors on ships
* Windlasses that are used to wind and pull rope or chains in order to lift weights on implements such as a crane, a well or a drawbridge 
* Webbing barriers that allow mobile post positions collect tensionally excess webbing
* Tow trucks hold steel cable on reels
* Rope, wire and electrical cable is often supplied on reels
* Badge reels are used to hold access badges, smart cards and other externally tethered small items such as keys and clippers
* A cave diving reel is a safety equipment used for running a distance line

==Motion picture terminology==

It is traditional to discuss the length of theatrical motion pictures in terms of &quot;reels&quot;. The standard length of a 35 mm film reel is , which runs approximately 11 minutes for sound film (24 frames per second) and about 15 minutes for silent film at the more or less standard speed of 18 frames per second. Most films have visible cues which mark the end of the reel. This allows projectionists running reel-to-reel to change over to the next reel on the other projector.

A so-called &quot;two-reeler&quot; would have run about 15–24 minutes since the actual short film shipped to a movie theater for exhibition may have had slightly less (but rarely more) than on it. Most modern projectionists use the term &quot;reel&quot; when referring to a &quot;two-reeler&quot;, as modern films are rarely shipped by single reels. A standard Hollywood movie averages about five 2,000-foot reels in length.

The &quot;reel&quot; was established as a standard measurement because of considerations in printing motion picture film at a film laboratory, for shipping (especially the film case sizes) and for the size of the physical film magazine attached to the motion picture projector. If it had not been standardized (at of 35 mm film), there would have been many difficulties in the manufacture of the related equipment. A 16 mm &quot;reel&quot; is . It runs, at sound speed, approximately the same amount of time (11–12 minutes) as a 35 mm reel.

A &quot;split reel&quot; is a motion picture film reel in two halves that, when assembled, hold a specific length of motion picture film that has been wound on a plastic core. Using a split reel allows film to be shipped or handled in a lighter and smaller form than film would on a &quot;fixed&quot; reel. In the silent era, the term was used to describe a single reel that accommodated two or more individual titles.

As digital cinema catches on, the physical reel is being replaced by a virtual format called Digital Cinema Package, which can be distributed using any storage medium (such as hard drives) or data transfer medium (such as the internet or satellite links) and projected using a digital projector instead of a conventional movie projector.

A newsreel is a short documentary film.

A showreel or demo reel is a short film showcasing a person&#x27;s or organization&#x27;s previous work.

<doc id="1150376" wikidata="Q1806380" url="?curid=1150376" title="Royal Niger Company">
<text>The Royal Niger Company was a mercantile company chartered by the British government in the nineteenth century. It was formed in 1879 as the &quot;United African Company &quot; and renamed to &quot;National African Company&quot; in 1881 and to &quot;Royal Niger Company&quot; in 1886. In 1929, the company became part of the United Africa Company, which came under the control of Unilever during the 1930s and continued to exist as a subsidiary of Unilever until 1987, when it was absorbed into the parent company. 

The company existed for a comparatively short time (1879–1900) but was instrumental in the formation of Colonial Nigeria, as it enabled the British Empire to establish control over the lower Niger against the German competition led by Bismarck during the 1890s. In 1900, the company-controlled territories became the Southern Nigeria Protectorate, which was in turn united with the Northern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria in 1914 (which eventually gained independence within the same borders as Nigeria in 1960). The Royal Niger Company was eventually integrated into Unilever.

==United African Company ==
Richard Lander first explored the area of Nigeria as the servant of Hugh Clapperton. In 1830, he returned to the river with his brother John; in 1832, he returned again (without his brother) to establish a trading post for the African Steamship Company&quot; at the confluence of the Niger and Benue rivers. The expedition failed, with 40 of the 49 members dying of fever or wounds from native attacks. One of the survivors, Macgregor Laird, subsequently remained in Britain but directed and funded expeditions to the country until his death in 1861. He opposed the failed Niger expedition of 1841 but the success of the &quot;Pleiad&quot;&#x27;s first mission in 1854 led to annual trips under Baikie and the 1857 foundation of Lokoja at the Niger–Benue confluence.

There were no voyages for the three years following Laird&#x27;s death, but the establishment of the was soon followed by several other firms. The competition reduced prices to the point that profits were minimal. Arriving in the region in 1877, George Goldie argued for the amalgamation of the surviving British firms into a single monopolistic chartered company, a method contemporaries supposed had been buried with the ultimate failure of the East India Company following the Sepoy Rebellion. By 1879, he had helped combine James Crowther&#x27;s WAC, David Macintosh&#x27;s , and the Williams Brothers&#x27; and James Pinnock&#x27;s firms into a single ; he then acted as the combined firm&#x27;s agent in the territory.

Almost immediately, the firm saw renewed competition as two French firms—the French Equatorial African Association and the Senegal Company—and another English one—the Liverpool and Manchester Trading Company—begin establishing posts on the river as well. A native attack on the UAC&#x27;s outpost at Onitsha in 1879 was repulsed with help from HMS &quot;Pioneer&quot;, but the Gladstone administration subsequently denied Goldie&#x27;s attempt to procure a government charter in 1881, on the grounds that the international rivalry might occasion unnecessary conflict and that the united firm was undercapitalized for the expense of genuine colonial administration.

==National African Company==
Goldie first began addressing the administration&#x27;s concerns by increasing the company&#x27;s capitalization to £100 000. He then managed to corral £1 000 000 in investments in a new concern—the —which bought up the UAC and its interests in 1882. The death of Léon Gambetta the same year deprived the French companies of their support within the French government and the strong subsidies it had been providing them. Goldie&#x27;s cash-flush NAC was then able to maintain 30 trading posts along the river, and ruin its competition in a two-year price war: by October 1884 all three had permitted him to buy out their interests in the region and the NAC&#x27;s annual report for 1885 was able to crow that it &quot;remained alone in undisputed commercial possession of the Niger–Binué region&quot;.

This monopoly permitted Britain to resist French and German calls to internationalize trade on the Niger River during the negotiations at the 1884–1885 Berlin Conference on African colonization. Goldie himself attended the meetings and successfully argued for including the region of the NAC&#x27;s operations within a British sphere of interest. Pledges from him and the British diplomats that free trade (or, in any case, non-discriminatory tariff rates) would be respected in their territory were dead letters: the NAC&#x27;s over 400 treaties with local leaders obliged the natives to trade solely with or through the company&#x27;s agents. Large tariffs and license fees eliminated competing firms from the area. The terms of these private contracts were made into general treaties by the British consuls, whose own treaties expressly incorporated them. Similarly, when King Jaja of Opobo organized his own trading network and even began running his own shipments of palm oil to Britain, he was lured onto a British warship and shipped into exile on Saint Vincent on charges of &quot;treaty breaking&quot; and &quot;obstructing commerce&quot;.

Despite treaties extending British control over the tribes of the Cameroons, however, Britain was willing to recognize the German colony that usurped the area in 1885 as a check on French activity in the upper Congo and Ubangi watersheds.

The scruples of the British government being overcome, a charter was at length granted (July 1886), the National African Company becoming The Royal Niger Company Chartered and Limited (normally shortened to the Royal Niger Company), with Lord Aberdare as governor and Goldie as vice-governor.

==Niger Company==
It was, however, evidently impossible for a chartered company to hold its own against the state-supported protectorates of France and Germany, and in consequence its charter was revoked in 1899 and, on 1 January 1900, the Royal Niger Company transferred its territories to the British Government for the sum of £865,000. The ceded territory together with the small Niger Coast Protectorate, already under imperial control, was formed into the two protectorates of Northern Nigeria and Southern Nigeria.

The company changed its name to The Niger Company Ltd and in 1929 became part of the United Africa Company.
The United Africa Company came under the control of Unilever in the 1930s and continued to exist as a subsidiary of Unilever until 1987, when it was absorbed into the parent company.

<text>A slurry is a mixture of denser solids suspended in liquid, usually water. The most common use of slurry is as a means of transporting solids or separating minerals, the liquid being a carrier that is pumped on a device such as a centrifugal pump. The size of solid particles may vary from 1 micrometre up to hundreds of millimetres.
The particles may settle below a certain transport velocity and the mixture can behave like a Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluid. Depending on the mixture, the slurry may be abrasive and/or corrosive.

==Examples==
Examples of slurries include:
*Cement slurry, a mixture of cement, water, and assorted dry and liquid additives used in the petroleum and other industries
*Soil/cement slurry, also called Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM), flowable fill, controlled density fill, flowable mortar, plastic soil-cement, K-Krete, and other names
*A mixture of thickening agent, oxidizers, and water used to form a gel explosive
*A mixture of pyroclastic material, rocky debris, and water produced in a volcanic eruption and known as a lahar
*A mixture of bentonite and water used to make slurry walls
*Coal slurry, a mixture of coal waste and water, or crushed coal and water
*Slip, a mixture of clay and water used for joining, glazing and decoration of ceramics and pottery.
*Slurry oil, the highest boiling fraction distilled from the effluent of an FCC unit in an oil refinery. It contains a large amount of catalyst, in form of sediments hence the denomination of slurry.
*A mixture of wood pulp and water used to make paper
*Manure slurry, a mixture of animal waste, organic matter, and sometimes water often known simply as &quot;slurry&quot; in agricultural use, used as fertilizer after aging in a slurry pit
*Meat slurry, a mixture of finely ground meat and water, centrifugally dewatered and used as a food ingredient.
*An abrasive substance used in chemical-mechanical polishing
*Slurry ice, a mixture of ice crystals, freezing point depressant, and water
*A mixture of raw materials and water involved in the rawmill manufacture of Portland cement
*A bolus of chewed food mixed with saliva
*A mixture of epoxy glue and glass microspheres used as a filler compound around core materials in sandwich-structured composite airframes.

==Calculations==

===Determining solids fraction===
To determine the percent solids (or solids fraction) of a slurry from the density of the slurry, solids and liquid
:formula_1
where
:formula_2 is the solids fraction of the slurry (state by mass)
:formula_3 is the solids density
:formula_4 is the slurry density
:formula_5 is the liquid density

In aqueous slurries, as is common in mineral processing, the specific gravity of the species is typically used, and since specific gravity of water is taken to be 1, this relation is typically written:
:formula_6
even though specific gravity with units tonnes/m3 (t/m3) is used instead of the SI density unit, kg/m3.

===Liquid mass from mass fraction of solids===
To determine the mass of liquid in a sample given the mass of solids and the mass fraction:
By definition
:formula_7
therefore
:formula_8
and
:formula_9
then
:formula_10
and therefore
:formula_11
where
:formula_2 is the solids fraction of the slurry
:formula_13 is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream
:formula_14 is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream
:formula_15 is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream

===Volumetric fraction from mass fraction===
:formula_16
Equivalently
:formula_17
and in a minerals processing context where the specific gravity of the liquid (water) is taken to be one:
:formula_18
So
:formula_19
and
:formula_20
Then combining with the first equation:
:formula_21
So
:formula_22
Then since
:formula_23
we conclude that
:formula_24
where
:formula_25 is the solids fraction of the slurry on a &quot;volumetric&quot; basis
:formula_26 is the solids fraction of the slurry on a &quot;mass&quot; basis
:formula_13 is the mass or mass flow of solids in the sample or stream
:formula_14 is the mass or mass flow of slurry in the sample or stream
:formula_15 is the mass or mass flow of liquid in the sample or stream
:formula_30 is the bulk specific gravity of the solids

<text>Adewale Ogunleye (; born August 9, 1977) is an American former professional football player who was a defensive end for 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Indiana Hoosiers. He was signed by the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2000 and also played for the Chicago Bears and Houston Texans.

==Early life and education==
Ogunleye is of a Nigerian and Yoruba background. His paternal grandfather, Emmanuel Taiwo Ogunleye, later Oba Ogunleye II Amugbayanwo (1922–1974) was the Oba (Elemure) of the city-state of Emure in Ekiti State, thus making him an Omoba of the Yoruba people. His last name means &quot;Ogun (the god of Iron) has honor.&quot; His father is a social worker employed by the City of New York.

Ogunleye played high school football at Tottenville High School in his hometown of Staten Island in New York City, He was a classmate of Major League Baseball All-Star starting pitcher Jason Marquis and a teammate of three-time Super Bowl-winning offensive guard Joe Andruzzi.

==College career==
Ogunleye played college football at Indiana from 1996 to 1999. During his college career, Ogunleye set school records for sacks (34.5) and tackles for loss (64). Additionally, he accumulated 167 tackles, eight forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries. Ogunleye earned All-Big Ten honors in each of his final three seasons. He graduated with a degree in English.

In November 2014, Ogunleye was inducted into the Indiana Athletic Hall of Fame.

In May 2014 after finishing his National Football League career, Ogunleye obtained a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

==Professional career==
Despite being projected as a first- or second-round NFL draft pick following his junior season in 1998, Ogunleye chose to return to Indiana for his senior season. During the 1999 season, he suffered a major knee injury, which ended his college career, and a staph infection, which caused him to lose 50 pounds. He was not selected in the 2000 NFL draft.

===Miami Dolphins===
Following the 2000 Draft, Ogunleye signed with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent. He spent the first year of his NFL career on injured reserve. In 2001, Ogunleye had recovered well enough to lead the team during the preseason in sacks and that earned him a spot on the Dolphins’ 53-man roster. By the end of his fourth season with the Miami Dolphins, Ogunleye had been voted starter in the 2004 NFL Pro Bowl. He led the AFC with 15 sacks in the 2003-2004 NFL season. He was given the Dan Marino Most Valuable Player of the year award, by the Miami Dolphins, that same season.

===Chicago Bears===
He was traded by the Dolphins to the Bears for wide receiver Marty Booker and a 3rd round pick in the 2005 NFL draft after holding out during the month of August before the 2004 NFL season. Ogunleye quickly signed a record-breaking 6-year contract with the Bears. During the next six seasons Ogunleye became a mainstay on the Bears top-ranked defense. During the 2005 NFL season, Ogunleye spearheaded the Bear&#x27;s defensive line by recording ten sacks. Ogunleye was named team captain and helped the Bears reach Super Bowl XLI in Miami during the 2006 season.

In 2008, Ogunleye was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Week for the week one after recording a safety and making a key fourth down stop against the Indianapolis Colts.

On December 20, 2009, in a game against the Baltimore Ravens, Ogunleye fractured his left fibula. He was placed on season-ending injured reserve on December 26.

===Houston Texans===

On September 14, 2010, Ogunleye signed a one-year tender with the Houston Texans after his contract with the Chicago Bears had expired. At the end of the 2011 season, Ogunleye would end his professional playing career. He finished with 11 NFL seasons under his belt. He finished with career totals of 389 Tackles, 67.5 Sacks, 17 forced fumbles, and 14 fumble recoveries, 2 safeties and 1 Interception.

<text>Jesse Alan Marsch ( ; born November 8, 1973) is an American professional soccer coach and former player who is the head coach of the Canada men&#x27;s national team. Marsch played 14 seasons as a midfielder in Major League Soccer (MLS) with D.C. United, Chicago Fire, and Chivas USA, winning three league titles and four U.S. Open Cup titles, as well as earning two caps for the United States national team.

In 2010, Marsch retired from his playing career and became a coach, first serving as an assistant with the U.S. national team under Bob Bradley that reached the last 16 of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He then became the inaugural head coach of the Montreal Impact upon its entry to MLS in 2012. In 2015, after a year-long stint as the assistant coach for his alma mater, the Princeton Tigers, Marsch was hired as head coach of the New York Red Bulls and stayed in the role through the first half of the 2018 MLS season. In his first year coaching the team, the Red Bulls won the Supporters&#x27; Shield and Marsch was named MLS Coach of the Year. He holds the record for most wins by a coach in franchise history.

In 2018, Marsch was appointed as an assistant coach at German Bundesliga club RB Leipzig under Ralf Rangnick; the team placed third in the league, was runner-up in the German Cup, and competed in the UEFA Europa League. The following season, Marsch was appointed the successor to Marco Rose as coach of Red Bull Salzburg in the Austrian Bundesliga; he led the club to a league and cup double in two consecutive seasons, as Salzburg made successive Champions League group stage appearances for the first time in club history. He returned to RB Leipzig as club coach for the 2021–22 season, leaving by mutual consent in December and joining Leeds United in February. He was sacked by Leeds in February 2023 and became coach of the Canadian national team in May 2024, where he subsequently led the team to finishing fourth place at the 2024 Copa América.

==Playing career==
===College===
Marsch played college soccer for Princeton University, where he was an All-American in 1995 after scoring 16 goals as a midfielder and forward.

===Professional===
Marsch was brought in by D.C. United (their assistant coach was his coach at Princeton, Bob Bradley) in the third round of the 1996 MLS College Draft.
Marsch spent the next two seasons with D.C. United, but played in only 15 games. D.C. assistant coach Bob Bradley, named to lead the expansion Chicago Fire, acquired Marsch soon after the Expansion Draft in exchange for A. J. Wood and a second-round pick in the 1998 College Draft. Marsch immediately became a regular in Chicago and remained a mainstay in their lineup through 2005. He helped the Fire to the 1998 MLS Cup, giving him three league championships in three seasons. While with Chicago, he also won the U.S. Open Cup in 1998, 2000 and 2003.

After the 2005 season, Marsch was transferred to Chivas USA, where Bradley was then coaching. At the time, he left the Fire as the club&#x27;s all-time leader in regular season games played with 200 (he now sits sixth behind C. J. Brown, Logan Pause, Gonzalo Segares, Zach Thornton and Chris Armas). Marsch is one of three players to have played in each of the first 14 seasons of Major League Soccer. On February 5, 2010, he announced his retirement after four seasons with Chivas to enter coaching.

===International===
Marsch received two caps with the United States national team. His first came as a substitute in a scoreless World Cup qualifier tie away to Trinidad and Tobago on November 11, 2001; the other came on June 2, 2007, in a 4–1 friendly win against China in San Jose, California.

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
Following his retirement, Marsch was hired as an assistant to his former college and club coach Bob Bradley with the United States men&#x27;s national team. Marsch remained with the U.S. program until Bradley&#x27;s firing in July 2011.

In August 2011, Marsch was unveiled as the first head coach of Major League Soccer expansion franchise Montreal Impact, starting play in 2012. In their first MLS game on March 10, the team lost 2–0 at fellow Canadians Vancouver Whitecaps. The club finished in 12th place with 42 points. After that one season, Marsch left the club in November 2012. Though team management had been emphatic about their satisfaction with Marsch&#x27;s work, the differences in coaching philosophies between Marsch and the management of the club led to an &quot;amicable&quot; split.

===New York Red Bulls===
In January 2015, Marsch was named head coach of New York Red Bulls, replacing Mike Petke. In his first season at the helm, Marsch led New York to the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield and a club record 18 league victories and 60 points and was named the MLS Coach of the Year. After a successful start to his career, the Red Bulls extended his contract in June 2016, offering Marsch a multi-year deal.

In January 2017, Marsch was linked to taking over for Óscar García as the manager of Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg. However, both New York Red Bulls and Red Bull Salzburg denied the reports. In July 2018, Marsch left the Red Bulls as the coach with the most wins in the club&#x27;s history, with a record of 75–32–44. Chris Armas followed as new head coach.

===Assistant at RB Leipzig===
Marsch became assistant to RB Leipzig head coach Ralf Rangnick for the 2018–19 season, signing a two-year contract in July 2018. During Marsch&#x27;s tenure as an assistant for Leipzig, he was tasked with organizing the team&#x27;s training sessions and preparing them for opponents. Marsch helped lead them to the group stage of the UEFA Europa League, where the team finished third in their group and bowed out of the competition. He further helped Rangnick lead the team to third place in the team&#x27;s Bundesliga campaign, and to the final of the DFB-Pokal before falling to Bayern Munich in the final. Marsch ultimately left the team after one season to replace Marco Rose as coach of Leipzig&#x27;s sister club Red Bull Salzburg.

===Red Bull Salzburg===
Marsch was officially presented as head coach of Red Bull Salzburg on June 6, 2019. In his first season in charge, Marsch led Salzburg to winning the double. The team won the Austrian Bundesliga by winning 68.75% of their games; 12 points ahead of second place Rapid Wien making Marsch the first American coach to win a top flight league title in Europe. The team also won the Austrian Cup 5–0 against Austria Lustenau.

During the 2020–21 season, Marsch led Salzburg to their third successive cup win, Marsch&#x27;s second as coach, in a 3–0 win against LASK. Salzburg also won the Bundesliga, making it two doubles in a row.

===RB Leipzig===
Marsch was announced as the new head coach of RB Leipzig starting from the 2021–22 season, replacing Julian Nagelsmann. Marsch won his first competitive match as Leipzig head coach 4–0 against SV Sandhausen in the DFB-Pokal. Leipzig then lost their season&#x27;s opening Bundesliga match 1–0 to Mainz 05. Marsch won his first Bundesliga match against VfB Stuttgart on matchday two. Under Marsch, Leipzig lost their opening 2021–22 UEFA Champions League fixture 6–3 to Manchester City. On December 5, 2021, Marsch and Leipzig announced that they had mutually agreed to part ways. He finished with a record of seven wins, four draws and six losses.

===Leeds United===
On February 28, 2022, Marsch was appointed as head coach of Premier League side Leeds United and signed a three-year deal following the departure of Marcelo Bielsa. He was the third American national to manage in the Premier League, after Bob Bradley and German-born David Wagner. The British press remarked that Marsch would have to combat prejudiced attitudes toward American soccer coaches.

In Marsch&#x27;s first game as Leeds coach, the team lost 1–0 at Leicester City on March 5; they won at the third attempt eight days later, 2–1 at home to Norwich City. On May 22, Marsch guided Leeds to a 2–1 win away at Brentford to help the club avoid relegation in 17th position; it was the first time since 2011 that a team survived despite being in the relegation zone at the start of the final day.

Despite being undefeated in their first three games of the 2022/23 season, including a 3-0 win at home against historic rivals Chelsea F.C., Leeds only managed to pick up six points in their first 11 games. On their 12th game, a match-up against struggling title contenders Liverpool F.C. Marsch guided Leeds to a 2-1 win away from home, with Rodrigo Moreno capitalizing on a mistake by Liverpool center-back Joe Gomez, and Crysencio Summerville scoring an 89th-minute winner earning Leeds United their first win at Anfield since 2001 and becoming the first team to beat Liverpool at Anfield since Fulham in 2020/21. Marsch was highly commended for both of these victories.

However, Leeds continued to struggle and only managed six points in their next eight games, which led to Marsch being sacked as Leeds coach on February 6, 2023, with the club sitting 17th in the table. Leeds were relegated to the Championship at the end of the 2022-23 season.

===Canada===

On May 13, 2024, Marsch was appointed as head coach of the Canada men&#x27;s national team, the first American to coach Canada. His wages are being partially subsidized by Canadian MLS clubs CF Montréal, Toronto FC and the Vancouver Whitecaps as well as donations from private parties due to the Canadian Soccer Association&#x27;s financial difficulties. His contract lasts through the 2026 FIFA World Cup, where Canada will be a co-host.

Marsch&#x27;s debut on June 6 was a 4–0 friendly loss to the Netherlands at De Kuip, after which he said that it was important to play the best national teams to improve for the 2026 World Cup. Three days later his team drew 0–0 against the number 2 team in the FIFA Men&#x27;s World Ranking, France, in Bordeaux.

At the 2024 Copa América in the United States – Canada&#x27;s first entry in the CONMEBOL competition – Marsch lost 2–0 to World and South American champions Argentina in Canada&#x27;s opening game, before a 1–0 win over Peru gave him the first victory of his spell. A goalless result against Chile in the final group game allowed the Canadians to advance as runners-up, before beating Venezuela on penalties in the quarterfinals. After a semifinal elimination by eventual champions Argentina, Canada contested the third place playoff against Uruguay, conceding an added-time equalizer by Luis Suárez and losing on penalties. Marsch said that despite the result, his team were ahead of where he thought they would be six weeks into his post.

After the Copa América, Marsch was linked with the national head coach job for the United States, who had fired Gregg Berhalter after a group stage elimination. Marsch said that he had no interest in the U.S. job and would never consider it unless there were changes in the United States Soccer Federation. He had previously been a candidate to replace Berhalter after the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but the latter was re-hired; Marsch criticized the USSF, saying &quot;I wasn&#x27;t treated very well&quot; in the application process.

Prior to the 2025 CONCACAF Nations League Finals, Marsch stated that he was ashamed of President Donald Trump&#x27;s calls for the United States to annex Canada and called the plan ridiculous.

==Personal life==
Marsch, son of Larry Marsch, was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, where he attended Jerome I. Case High School. He and his wife Kim have three children – one daughter and two sons. Apart from his native English, Marsch speaks fluent German, which he learned at age 44.

<text>James Plaintain (fl. 1720–1728, John or James, last name also Plantain) was a pirate active in the Indian Ocean. He is best known for using his pirate wealth to found a short-lived kingdom on Madagascar.

==History==

Plantain was English, born in Jamaica, and served as a sailor aboard Edward England’s pirate flotilla (having once served on Christopher Condent&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&quot;) which captured the East India Company ship &quot;Cassandra&quot; from Captain James Macrae in 1720. After looting the ship the collected pirates sailed to Madagascar, divided their plunder, and sailed their separate ways. Plantain and a number of others remained behind, some voluntarily and some not. With two others he moved to Ranter Bay (site of modern Rantabe), spending his plunder and befriending the Malagasay natives to build a settlement. He styled himself “King of Ranter Bay.”

He organized the locals to make war against their neighbors, using firearms to swing the battles his way. He kept himself and his allies supplied by trading with passing ships, offering food, water, supplies, and slaves taken as captives in wars against his neighbors in exchange for guns, gunpowder and shot, clothes, and other goods. The pirates, Plantain included, took multiple Malagasay wives and lavished them with treasures. He demanded the granddaughter of a neighboring king as his wife; the king refused, setting off a series of wars and counter-raids, from which Plantain eventually emerged victorious.

A Royal Navy squadron visited Madagascar in 1722 looking for Richard Taylor, Olivier Levasseur, and Edward England. Plantain advised them that the pirates had long since departed and invited the officers to visit his settlement. Reportedly England himself was present, haggard and near death; he had been deposed from command by Taylor on the grounds of being too kind to the &quot;Cassandra’s&quot; Captain.

Having made too many enemies on Madagascar Plantain took his favored wife and moved to India in 1728, serving in the Maratha navy under the Maratha Admiral Kanhoji Angre. Plantain died some time prior to April 1737, still serving the Marathas under Angria. When he left to fight various battles he generally buried his wealth on the island and dug it up when he returned, but rumors of Plantain’s buried treasure persisted.

<text>The 1961 [[American Football League draft]], was held in 1960 because another league was in competition for the class of 1961 college stars, the American Football League draft for 1961 graduates. A six-round telephone draft was held on November 21 and 22, 1960, that saw the Buffalo Bills select Auburn&#x27;s Ken Rice as the overall first draft pick. The draft was completed on December 5 and 6, with rounds seven through thirty. The San Diego Chargers were still the &quot;Los Angeles Chargers&quot; in this draft, as their relocation was not announced until late January 1961.

<doc id="1150417" wikidata="Q6817343" url="?curid=1150417" title="Menschen Vereeniging Wolbodo">
<text>The Mensenvereniging Wolbodo was founded in 1959 as the PSK (Parochiele Studenten Kring) by 17 students, who were Catholic, but did not want to join the Catholic student society Virgiel. In 1960 the name was changed to Sanctus Wolbodo or in Dutch &quot;Sint Wolbodo&quot;, referring both to the saint who supposedly is the patron saint of students and to its Catholic nature.

== History ==
The connection with the church was broken in 1967 after a happening with Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama in which the first body painting in the Netherlands took place. In the period 1964-1968 regular jazz performances were organized by Novum Jazz, which attracted an artistic and progressive crowd to Wolbodo. 

Whereas for most student societies the membership ends with the finishing of the study (whether the student has graduated or not) at a certain point in time Wolbodo decided that one should be able to be a member whenever one thought of Wolbodo as a place to feel at home.

Influenced by changing attitudes in the 1970s, Wolbodo started calling itself a people society (&quot;mensenvereniging&quot;) instead of student society and dropped the &quot;St&quot; in front of the name. Nowadays most people prefer to write it as Menschen Vereeniging, the same words, written in pre-WWII Dutch. 

Although Wolbodo isn&#x27;t a student only society, there is still a strong connection to the Delft University of Technology and Delft student life.

In 2010 Wolbodo had about 80 members.

==Structure==
In contrast to most student societies that are highly hierarchically structured, Wolbodo is horizontally structured. This is a preciously cultivated form of anarchy within the society. The only form of organisation within the society is the presence of a board.

==Residence==
Wolbodo&#x27;s residence is a building located at the &quot;Verwersdijk&quot; in Delft and is called Novum (&quot;new&quot;). The main area of this building is the parlor, which can hold up to 100 individuals in the bar. Novum is the property of a foundation, Intra Muros (&quot;between walls&quot;), better known as IM. The foundation also provides for the necessary maintenance of the building.
==Activities==
* Wolbodo has three subsocieties; Carrus Plicatus, for those who love folding campers, Ornatus Caput, for those who love silly hats and Wolga, the rowing subsociety which has its own subsociety Olga, for women.
* OWEE; &quot;Ontvangst WEEk&quot;, Dutch for Incoming Week, a week of festivities for new students at the beginning of the college year.
* Food; Wolbodo serves dinner on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for members and non-members.
* Wine tasting evenings every first Thursday of the month.
* Beer tasting evenings with special and novelty beers every last Thursday of the month.
* On Sunday it is movienight.
* Wolpop is an external organisation which aims to support upcoming artists by organizing a festival, called Wolpop, every year. While Wolpop is independent of Wolbodo, most boardmembers of Wolpop are also Wolbodo members.

<text>Ossian Bingley Hart (January 17, 1821 – March 18, 1874) was the 10th Governor of Florida from 1873 to 1874, and the first governor of Florida who was born in the state.

== Early life and career ==
Born in Jacksonville to Isaiah Hart, one of the city&#x27;s founders, he was raised on his father&#x27;s plantation along the St. Johns River. He was a lawyer in Jacksonville. He moved to a farm near Fort Pierce, Florida in 1843, and was a founding member of the St. Lucie County Board of Commissioners. In 1845, Hart became Florida State Representative for St. Lucie County. In 1846 he moved to Key West where he resumed his law practice. In 1856, he moved to Tampa, Florida. Among his clients was &quot;Adam&quot;, a black man who was lynched after the Florida Supreme Court declared his murder conviction a mistrial.

Despite his upbringing, Hart became a Republican and openly opposed secession from the United States, causing some difficult times for him during the American Civil War. Following the war, he helped reestablish the governments of the state and of the city of Jacksonville. In 1868, he was appointed a justice of the Florida Supreme Court. In 1870, he ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress, only to be elected governor two years later on November 5, 1872. He appointed Jonathan Clarkson Gibbs as Florida&#x27;s first African-American Superintendent of Public Instruction. During his tenure, &quot;limited civil rights legislation was passed, and some improvements were made in the state&#x27;s weakened finances.&quot; Weakened by the campaign, he fell ill with pneumonia and died in Jacksonville. He was succeeded by lieutenant governor Marcellus Stearns, Florida&#x27;s last Republican governor until 1967.

== Personal life ==
He married his wife Catherine Smith Campbell, a resident of Newark, New Jersey, on October 3, 1843.

<text>Mijikenda (&quot;the Nine Tribes&quot;) are a group of nine related Bantu ethnic groups inhabiting the coast of Kenya, between the Sabaki and the Umba rivers, in an area stretching from the border with Tanzania in the south to the border near Somalia in the north. Archaeologist Chapuruka Kusimba contends that the Mijikenda formerly resided in coastal cities, but later settled in Kenya&#x27;s hinterlands to avoid submission to dominant Portuguese forces that were then in control. Historically, these Mijikenda ethnic groups have been called the Nyika or Nika by outsiders. It is a derogatory term meaning &quot;bush people.&quot;

The nine Ethnic groups that make up the Mijikenda peoples are the Chonyi, Kambe, Duruma, Kauma, Ribe, Rabai, Jibana, Giriama, and Digo. The Digo are southern Mijikenda while the others are northern Mijikenda. The Digo are also found in Tanzania due to their proximity to the common border.

==Culture==

Each of the Mijikenda groups has a sacred forest, a &quot;kaya&quot;, which is a place of prayer. Eleven of the approximately 30 kaya forests have been inscribed together as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Sacred Mijikenda Kaya Forests. Mijikenda people are also known for creating wooden kigango funerary statues which have been displayed in museums around the world and sold in the international art market. These artifacts were at one time legally sold by reputable art galleries and curio shops during the early 1970s to the 1990s; however, other kigango statues were found to have been stolen from cultural sites and illegally sold.

Each Mijikenda ethnic group has its own unique customs and dialects of the Mijikenda language, although the dialects are similar to each other and to Swahili.

== History and ethnography of the Mijikenda peoples ==

=== Origins ===
The orthodox view of the Mijikenda&#x27;s origins is that the Mijikenda peoples originated in Shungwaya (Singwaya) and various other parts of the northern Somali coast, and where pushed south by the Galla (Oromo) and reached Kenya around the 16th century. This view of the origins of the Mijikenda people was argued by Thomas Spear in the book &quot;The Kaya Complex&quot;, and was also confirmed by many Mijikenda oral traditions. Furthermore, oral tradition states that the precise reason for the Galla pushing the Mijikenda from Singwaya was the murder of a Galla Tribesman by a Mijikenda youth, and the Mijikenda tribes subsequent refusal to pay compensation to the Galla. However it has also been theorized that the Mijikenda peoples may have originated in roughly the same places they currently reside. One possible explanation for this is that the Mijikenda peoples adopted the Singwaya narrative in order to create an ethnic identity that allowed them to create a relationship to the Swahili who also claimed Singwaya origins. Oral tradition also states that the Mijikenda peoples split into six separate peoples during this southern migration after they were driven out of Singwaya. These six groups would go on to settle the original six &quot;kaya&quot;.

At the turn of the 17th century the Mijikenda settled six fortified hilltop &quot;kaya&quot;, where they made their homesteads. These original six &quot;kaya&quot; were later expanded into nine &quot;kaya&quot;. The origin legend serves as a narrative of a real migration that happened at a specific point in time to a real place, but also serves as a narrative of a mythical migration that took place through a cultural time from a common origin. It promotes a higher unity among the group of the nine individual ethnic groups that makes up the Mijikenda peoples. Singwaya is considered by the Mijikenda to be their common origin point, and the birthplace of their language and traditions.

This origin legend also defines some of the relationships of the ethnic groups that make up the Mijikenda peoples, for example one version of the oral tradition states that the Digo were the first to leave Singwaya and thus are accepted as the other groups as senior, then the Ribe left, followed by the Giriama, the Chonyi, and the Jibana.
=== Kayas ===

The &quot;kayas&quot; were the first homesteads of the Mijikenda peoples after their exodus from Singwaya. Oral tradition states that it was the Digo who were the first to migrate southward and establish the first &quot;kaya&quot;. The period after the establishment of the &quot;kaya&quot; and was portrayed as a time of stability by these oral traditions, this period ended in the mid to late 19th century with the rise of colonialism. The &quot;kaya&quot; also represented an important political symbol to the Mijikenda peoples, as well as being an important cultural symbol to the Mijikenda peoples. The political symbolism of the &quot;kaya&quot; also played a part in the resistance to colonialism for the Mijikenda peoples. Sometime during the late 19th century the Mijikenda peoples began leaving their &quot;kaya&quot; homesteads and settling areas elsewhere.

The layout of the &quot;kaya&quot; settlements usually had centrally positioned areas devoted to leadership and worship, with other areas devoted to initiation ceremonies, areas for developing magic and medicine, and areas devoted to burials and entertainment placed around them. The forests of the &quot;kaya&quot; surrounding the settlement acted as a buffer between the settlement itself and the outside world. As the populations of these &quot;kaya&quot; grew, security grew which lead to a period of stability which allowed the Mijikenda people to spread outwards along the coasts and southwards along the border of Tanzania. Eventually all nine of the original &quot;kaya&quot; were abandoned as the Mijikenda settled elsewhere, however the importance of these &quot;kaya&quot; did not diminish, and they were still held as sacred sites.

=== Slavery ===
During the precolonial period the Mijikenda people were horticulturalists and pastoralists, And had well established trade with the coastal Swahili peoples. The Hinterland people (The Mijikenda, Pokomo, and Segeju peoples) grew food that the coastal Swahili people depended on. This trade relationship was based on economic, military, and political alliances. The Mijikenda peoples even participated in Mombasa politics.

However, during the colonial period under the British power was given to the Coastal Swahili peoples and the Arab peoples of the area. The Coastal strip of land near the Hinterlands was recognized as belonging to the Sultan of Oman, subsequently the Mijikenda people could only go there as squatters and were in danger of expulsion at any time. The colonial power over the coastal areas also extended to the Hinterland regions where the Mijikenda people resided.

One group of Mijikenda peoples, Known as the Giriama peoples were mistrustful of the British colonial government, as prior to Britain&#x27;s colonization of the coastal and hinterland areas this group had had its people captured by Arab and Swahili slave traders during the 19th century.

Differing accounts of this period exist, with some sources stating that these enslaved Giriama peoples participated in a complex patron-client relationship which was important for the establishment of large scale plantations on the East African coast. This account goes on to say that these enslaved Giriama peoples were integrated into Swahili and Arab land owning families and were sometimes referred to as dependents rather than slaves. Overall the treatment of these slaves was not very harsh, due to the ease of escape, the kin-based patron-client system, and Islam&#x27;s prohibition of harsh treatment of slaves. This is contrasted by the treatment of the slaves on the nearby islands such as Pemba or Zanzibar where slaves were treated more harshly. As slave ownership declined on the East African coast many of the Ex-slaves moved on to find employment as manual laborers on their former master&#x27;s plantations and were paid a portion of the crop as compensation in a similar patron-client relationship as before.

However some accounts state that the slavery that the Giriama people endured was harsher than was previously believed. Enslaved Giriama people were known to have fled by the hundreds to any sanctuary they could, in some cases seeking refuge in Christian Missionary stations, in other cases fleeing to runaway slave settlements. Additionally the idea that the transition from ex-slaves to manual laborers was made difficult due to fear among members of the colonial government that the fugitive and freed slaves would start a rebellion.

<text>Luke Ryan Jackson (born November 6, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Oregon Ducks, earning consensus second-team All-American honors as a senior in 2004. He was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round of the 2004 NBA draft with the 10th overall pick. After his playing career, Jackson was a head coach for the Northwest Christian University Beacons.

==High school and college career==
A four-year letterman in both basketball and baseball at Creswell High School, he was Oregon&#x27;s Class AAA Basketball Player of the Year in 1998 and 2000. He averaged 24.2 points, 8.1 assists and 5.0 steals per game as a senior to help Creswell win the 2000 Oregon State Basketball Championship (Class AAA). He finished his career ranked fourth all-time in Oregon high school history, with 2,095 points.

Jackson continued his on court success with a storied four-season career at the University of Oregon, leading the Ducks to an Elite Eight finish in 2002 NCAA tournament as a sophomore. Among his teammates at Oregon were future NBA players Luke Ridnour and Fred Jones.

Jackson is the only men&#x27;s basketball player in school history to place in the top ten in nine different statistical categories. He is second all-time in points scored, third in total steals, fourth in assists and seventh in rebounds and is first in free throws made. Jackson is one of two Pac-10 players to score over 1,900 points, grab over 700 rebounds and contribute over 400 assists over their career. In one of the greatest individual performances of all-time at Mac Court, Jackson scored 40 points — including 29 straight in the second half and overtime — as Oregon overcame an 18-point deficit to defeat Colorado 77–72 in the first round of the National Invitation Tournament on March 17, 2004. He also became only the second freshman in Pac-10 history to record a triple-double when on February 17, 2001, he added 14 points, 11 rebounds and ten assists in a contest versus Washington. In his junior year, Jackson&#x27;s second and final career triple-doubles against Florida A&amp;M made him only the third Pac-10 player in history to achieve multiple career triple-doubles (joining Jason Kidd and Loren Woods).

Named to the Pac-10 All-Freshman Team in 2000–01, Pac-10 honorable mention in 2001–02, and All-Pac-10 in 2002–03 and 2003–04, he also garnered All-American honors from The Sporting News, Basketball Times, ESPN.com and CBS SportsLine.com.

His senior campaign saw the lanky swingman lead Oregon in points (21.2), rebounds (7.2) and assists (4.5) while becoming a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year award. Jackson graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in political science.

==Professional career==
While he was selected by Cleveland with the tenth pick overall of the 2004 NBA Draft, his playing time with the Cavaliers was limited to only 46 games over his first two NBA seasons, missing 32 games in the second season with a broken left wrist. That Fall, Cleveland traded Jackson, along with an undisclosed amount of cash, to the Boston Celtics in return for center Dwayne Jones; Jackson was waived before the 2006–07 season started on October 27.

Recovered from his injuries, Jackson signed with the Idaho Stampede of the NBDL. Jackson averaged 12.5 points, 2.3 rebounds and 3.2 assists in 30.8 minutes in six games with Idaho, gaining the attention of the injury rattled Los Angeles Clippers. He signed to a 10-day contract in January 2007 with the Clippers, but his stay in Los Angeles was brief, appearing in only three games.

On March 25, 2007, Jackson was signed to a 10-day contract by the Toronto Raptors to provide bench depth. After performing well in limited minutes, he was signed to a second ten-day contract and then to a two-year pact with Toronto for the rest of the 2006–2007 NBA season, and the 2007–08 season as well. On April 18, 2007, in Toronto&#x27;s last game of the regular season, Jackson exploded for a career-high 30 points and 5 assists while logging a career maximum 39 minutes in a defeat to the Philadelphia 76ers.

On October 29, 2007, Jackson was waived by the Raptors. He was reacquired by the Idaho Stampede on December 4, 2007. In his first game with that club (the only one that season), he scored 30 points in 31 minutes with 7–14 shooting, including 11–11 at the free throw line and 5–6 from long range. He also had four rebounds, nine assists, one steal, one blocked shot, three turnovers, and no personal fouls. He then left the team for a workout with the Miami Heat.

On December 12, 2007, the Heat released Penny Hardaway to clear a roster spot for Jackson. During his stay in Miami, Jackson averaged 5.6 points, 2.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists. He was waived by the Miami Heat on February 6, 2008. This last stint in Miami ended up being Jackson&#x27;s last playing days in the NBA for the rest of his professional basketball career. His final game was played on February 1, 2008, in an 85–94 loss to the New Jersey Nets where he recorded 10 points, five rebounds and one steal.

Jackson was signed by the Portland Trail Blazers in August 2008, but was released so the Blazers could keep under the 15-player limit.

Jackson re-signed with the Idaho Stampede in December 2008. He was named to the 2009 NBDL All-Star Game on February 3, 2009.

Jackson played with the Dallas Mavericks summer league team in 2009. On August 12, 2009, he moved to Italy and signed a one-year contract with Carife Ferrara.

Jackson was invited to the Memphis Grizzlies preseason camp in September 2010, but was waived on October 10.

Jackson later rejoined the Idaho Stampede. In 2011, Jackson was signed by Hapoel Jerusalem B.C. from the Israeli Basketball Super League.

==Coaching==
On February 20, 2013, Jackson was introduced as the new head coach at Northwest Christian University, in Eugene, Oregon, replacing Corey Anderson. During his first season at the helm of the Beacons, Jackson led his team to their first ever appearance in the NAIA Division II National Championship Tournament. In four seasons as coach of the Beacons, Jackson led the team to an 88–38 record, two conference regular season titles, and three NAIA Division II tournament appearances.
In 2024 Jackson took the job at Pleasant Hill High School a 3a school located near Eugene in Oregon.

<text>This is a summary of 2003 in music in the United Kingdom.

==Events==
*6 January – The annual Park Lane Group Young Artists festival of contemporary music opens with two concerts in the Purcell Room at the Southbank Centre, London. The first concert, given by the Gallimaufry Ensemble, included the premiere of a new wind quintet by 23-year-old Benjamin Wallfisch; the second concert featured solo bass clarinettist Sarah Watts, who premiered Marc Yeats&#x27; &quot;Vox&quot; for solo bass clarinet and Michael Smetanin&#x27;s &quot;Ladder of Escape&quot; for bass clarinet with prerecorded ensemble of six bass and two contrabass clarinets.
*10 January – Following an investigation by The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and London detectives, police raids in the UK and the Netherlands recover 500 original Beatles studio tapes, recorded during the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions. Five people are arrested. The tapes have been used for bootleg releases for years.
*13 January – The Who guitarist Pete Townshend is arrested on suspicion of possessing and making indecent images of children and of incitement to distribute them. Townshend claims in a statement that he did not download any such images and accessed Web sites advertising child pornography because he was researching material for his autobiography, which will include passages about his abusive childhood.
*18 January – A two-day festival of the music of Mark-Anthony Turnage is given at the Barbican Centre, London, with three world premieres and chamber concerts by the Nash Ensemble and the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group.
*21 April – S Club announce live on stage at London&#x27;s Docklands Arena that they are to split after five years together. Their final single, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, enters the chart at #2 a month after the announcement. Rachel Stevens from the group launched her successful solo career shortly afterwards with the song &quot;Sweet Dreams My LA Ex&quot;.
*2 May – Mansun confirm that they have split up, after months of speculation and after the departure of Stove King. The remaining members had until that point worked on an unfinished 4th studio album, which was eventually released a year later as &quot;Kleptomania&quot; due to fan demand.
*7 May – Pete Townshend is cleared of the charges stemming from his arrest in January on suspicion of possessing child pornography, but is formally cautioned and placed on the sex offenders register for five years.
*24 May
**The Eurovision Song Contest is held in Riga, Latvia. &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, performed by Jemini, receives no points in the voting, the worst-ever result for the UK until after 2021. Some blame the United Kingdom&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War, whilst others attribute the result to a bad performance. 
**After a 40-year gap, former Beatle Paul McCartney performs in Russia, on the Red Square in Moscow.
*27–29 June – Glastonbury Festival, U.K., headline acts included David Gray, Primal Scream, Morcheeba, The Flaming Lips, Radiohead, Super Furry Animals, Lamb, Feeder, Manic Street Preachers, and Doves. 
*7 September – Pete Doherty receives a 6-month prison sentence for stealing items from bandmate Carl Barat&#x27;s flat. The sentence is reduced, and Doherty is released a month later.
*14 November – The legal incarnation of the band Pink Floyd reunites to perform at the funeral of their manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke.
*6 December – Elvis Costello and Diana Krall are married in a private ceremony at Elton John&#x27;s estate.
*8 December – Ozzy Osbourne is rushed into emergency surgery after having a serious accident riding an all-terrain vehicle on the grounds of his English estate. Osbourne broke his collarbone, eight ribs and a vertebra in his neck.
*12 December – Mick Jagger is knighted for services to music by the Prince of Wales (now Charles III) at Buckingham Palace.
*18 December – John Rutter tells US television programme &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he is not a particularly religious man yet still deeply spiritual and inspired by the spirituality of sacred verses and prayers.

<text>Wardha is a city and a municipal council in Wardha district in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The administrative headquarter of Wardha district is situated here. Wardha gets its name from the Wardha River which flows on the northern, western and southern boundaries of the district. Founded in 1866, the town is now an important centre for cotton trade. Wardha was an important part of the Gandhian era.

== History ==
Wardha was included in the empire of the Mauryas, Shungas, Satavahanas and Vakatakas. Pravarapura, modern Pavnar, was once the capital of the Vakataka dynasty. Vakatakas were contemporaries of the Imperial Guptas. Prabhavatigupta, the daughter of Chandragupta II (Vikramaditya), was married to the Vakataka ruler Rudrasena. The period of the Vakatakas was from the 2nd to the 5th century CE. The empire stretched from the Arabian Sea in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east, and from the Narmada River in the north to the Krishna-Godavari delta in the south.

Later on, Wardha was ruled by the Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, the Delhi Sultanate, the Bahamani Sultanate, the Muslim ruler of Berar, Gonds and Marathas. Raja Bakht Buland Shah of Gond Dynasty, Raghuji of Bhonsale were the prominent rulers in the Medieval period.

During the 1850s Wardha district, (then a part of Nagpur district) fell into the hands of the British who included Wardha in the Central Province. In 1862, it was separated for convenient administrative purposes, and Kawatha near Pulgaon became the district headquarters. In 1866, the district headquarters was moved to Palakwadi village. The huts in the village were destroyed and a new city was constructed by English town-planner Sir Bachelor and Sir Reginald Craddock. This new city was named Wardha after the river Wardha which flows through the district.

Wardha has an adjacent city, Sevagram, and both were major centers for the Indian Independence Movement, especially as the location for an annual meeting of the Indian National Congress in 1934, and Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s Ashram.

Wardha was one of the pre-planned cities of British India. The town-planners were Sir Reginald Craddock and Sir Bachelor. In Craddock&#x27;s memory, his name was given to the district&#x27;s biggest school and an important road was named after Sir Bachelor in the British period. The Craddock School was renamed Mahatma Gandhi School. The District Hospital was named King George Hospital, but was renamed later on. The stone in which the old name was carved was at the main gate for more than a century. It was hidden by a new name board reading District Hospital. There are many buildings from the British period in the city, including the Z.P. old building, the Central Jail, the Church at Bajajwadi, and the Christian cemetery.
The owners of Powale group and Dhandre group come from Wardha.

After spending two years in jail, he travelled around India and, at the invitation of the Gandhian industrialist Jamnalal Bajaj, stayed for some time in Wardha City at Jamnalal&#x27;s bungalow. In 1936, at the age of 67, Gandhiji moved to a village (which he subsequently called Sewagram - Hindi for village of service) at the outskirts of Wardha and started to live here in a group of huts with his wife Kasturba and other disciples. This slowly grew into an ashram, where Gandhi lived with his followers for the next twelve years, until his death. The premises are very calming. Many personal items used by Gandhi and his contemporaries are preserved here including his spectacles, telephone, notebook, tables, mats, etc...

<doc id="1150480" wikidata="Q537293" url="?curid=1150480" title="Jeannette Thurber">
<text>Jeannette Thurber (also known as Jeannette Meyers Thurber; January 29, 1850 in Delhi, New York – January 2, 1946 in Bronxville, New York) was amongst the first major patrons of classical music in the United States. Thurber established the National Conservatory of Music of America in 1885—the first of its kind and an endeavor that some say ushered in the first orchestral music with a distinctively American sound. But in a very radical stance for the day, Thurber championed the rights of women, people of color and the handicapped to attend her school, sometimes on full scholarship. This was 1885—two decades since the end of the American Civil War—and her school was racially integrated, promoted women, and had an inclusive stance toward the handicapped.

Thurber founded the school in part because of her belief that a nation should cultivate its own unique music—an unusual stance when the prevailing attitude was that all cultured art, especially orchestral music, came from Germany or Italy. While running the school, she sponsored competitions for American musicians to develop American music.

The National Conservatory of Music of America was the outstanding institution for professional musical preparation in the United States for some 25 years or more. At its height in the 1890s it boasted a faculty of international renown ... and initiated a course of studies whose features became a basis for the curriculum now taken for granted in the colleges and conservatories of this country. Its achievements resulted from the endeavors of a single visionary: Jeannette M Thurber, a wealthy, idealistic New Yorker who devoted most of her life to the school ... Although her innovative design for the Conservatory was influential in shaping the course of American music for the 20th century, Mrs. Thurber and her school have slipped into undeserved obscurity.&quot;

==Life==
Jeannette Meyers was the daughter of Henry Meyers, an immigrant violinist from Copenhagen, Denmark, and Annamarie Coffin Price. She was educated at the Paris Conservatory, which inspired her to advocate for government funding of her school, as was done in France. On September 15, 1869, at the age of 19, she married Francis Beatty Thurber (Delhi, November 13, 1842 – Manhattan, July 4, 1907), who would later become a millionaire grocery wholesaler. The couple had two daughters, Marianne and Jeannette. The family had a summer home at Onteora Park in the Catskill Mountains.

In 1884 Thurber sponsored New York City&#x27;s first Wagner festival. In 1885 she founded the National Conservatory of Music of America and its adjunct American Opera Company, both in New York. In 1888/89 she sponsored the New York debut of the Boston Symphony. But the Conservatory seemed to be her real love, and she grew it from 84 students when it opened to 3,000 students in 1900. Her success was due, in part, to her conviction that her school required an outstanding and publicly-celebrated faculty: its first director was Jacques Bouhy, a world-renowned baritone.

In 1892, she was responsible for bringing the Czech composer Antonín Dvořák to the United States to head her conservatory, where he remained until 1895. Dvořák, who refused her offer several times, was ultimately persuaded by his wife, Anna Dvorak, when she learned of the staggering annual salary of $15,000, which was 25 times his current income. He was to receive four months&#x27; summer leave in exchange for three hours of daily teaching and six annual concerts. It was there that he met 26-year-old African-American student Harry Burleigh. Burleigh, who mopped floors to pay for his tuition, sang spirituals as he worked and drew the interest of Dvorak. Burleigh&#x27;s rendering of African-American spirituals had a profound effect on Dvorak&#x27;s compositions and served as the basis for one of his best-known symphonies, (with a title suggested by Thurber, it is said), &quot;From the New World&quot;. Dvorak said, &quot;In the Negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.&quot; Burleigh went on to assist Dvorak in copying sections of his work as his amanuensis, and ultimately became a well-known baritone and composer in his own right, as well as a faculty member at the Conservatory.

In addition to race and gender issues, Thurber championed the idea of a federally-funded conservatory and was very pointed about the fact that the United States was the only industrialized nation that did not provide government monies for the arts. Thurber &quot;precipitated public debate over the appropriateness of a federally funded Conservatory of music in a capitalist society&quot;. In fact, the Institute of Musical Art of the City of New York, chartered in 1904 with the backing of Andrew Carnegie, was a privately funded institution and became her chief competition, and there is no indication in the public record that they accepted blacks, the handicapped or even women. The school ultimately morphed into the Juilliard School. (Carnegie also was a founding patron of Thurber&#x27;s Conservatory though some research suggests that other than a small amount from L. Horton and Andrew Carnegie, Thurber is the only one who contributed financial backing.)

Thurber&#x27;s continuing difficulties in securing funding for her school—either public or private—and her flagging energy as she grew older, contributed to the demise of the school, but her success did as well: music schools started springing up, competing for faculty and students. On the other hand, her school was written out of the record of musical history well before the doors had even closed. &quot;It is conspicuously absent from Elson&#x27;s &quot;National Music of America&quot;, written in 1899, nor is there any reference to it in Waldo Selden Pratt&#x27;s 1909 &quot;History of Music&quot;, yet the school was still advertising nationally and enrolling hundreds of students.&quot;

Scholars suggest it could be because the school had been pigeon-holed as being &quot;specifically successful in helping students of foreign birth and certain special classes, like the blind and those of Negro blood&quot;. Or because the orchestra had a &quot;a sprinkling of girls&quot;, as the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; reported in 1899.

Thurber lived to be almost 96, dying in 1946 as a woman who &quot;combined her love of music with an entrepreneurial imagination, the management skills of the labor negotiator, and a profound dedication to music education—qualities that mark her, even to this day, as one of the most intelligent, effective patrons ever to take a stand for American music&quot;.

<text>John Daniel Hicks (born June 2, 1962) is an American sportscaster for NBC Sports since 1992.

==Early years==
Born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, Hicks graduated from Sabino High School in 1980 and from the University of Arizona in 1984. After starting in radio, he was a weekend sports anchor on KVOA, the NBC affiliate in Tucson. Hicks moved east to work as a sports reporter for CNN in Atlanta in 1989 and went to NBC Sports in 1992.

==NBC Sports==
===College Football===
Hicks took over as play-by-play commentator for Notre Dame football in 2013, replacing Tom Hammond.

Hicks continued to call NBC&#x27;s Notre Dame package through the 2016 season. At the start of the 2017 season, Hicks was replaced by Mike Tirico.

After a seven-season hiatus, NBC announced Hicks will return to the Notre Dame package for the 2024 season.

===NFL===
Hicks was a play by play announcer for the &quot;NFL on NBC&quot; starting in 1992, continuing until the final season in 1998.

Additionally, he called the AFC Wildcard matchup in 2014, where the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the second-biggest comeback in NFL playoff history.

===NBA===
Starting with the 1992–93 season, Hicks was a sideline reporter for the &quot;NBA on NBC.&quot; He transitioned to a play-by-play role with the 1997–98 season calling a limited number of games through 2000.

===Other Sports===

Hicks was a tower announcer for NBC&#x27;s golf coverage until Dick Enberg left NBC for CBS in 2000, promoting Hicks to the top spot.

He formerly served as the primary anchor for NBC&#x27;s sports updates every weekend and also hosted NBC&#x27;s now-defunct annual winter sports special, &quot;Ice&quot;.

In 2019, he joined NBC&#x27;s coverage of the French Open tennis tournament.

===Olympics===
Hicks has been regularly involved in NBC&#x27;s Olympic Games coverage. During the Summer Olympics, he is the stroke-by-stroke announcer for swimming, a role he has held since 1996 with lead color commentator Rowdy Gaines, and was the play-by-play announcer for speed skating for the Winter Olympics in 2002, 2006 and 2010. He moved to alpine skiing for the 2014 and 2018 Games, taking over for the retired Tim Ryan, in addition to formerly serving as co-host of the Closing Ceremony. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, Hicks called diving, a role he returned to for a single day at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, subbing for Ted Robinson, who was assigned to call the gold medal match in men&#x27;s tennis on the same day. At the 2002 Winter Olympics and 2004 Summer Olympics, Hicks served as late-night anchor, although in 2004, Pat O&#x27;Brien served as late-night host for the first week of the games because of Hicks&#x27; swimming duties. Hicks also hosted the former CNBC show &quot;The Olympic Show&quot;.

One of Hicks&#x27; most memorable calls came during the men&#x27;s 4×100 freestyle relay at the 2008 Summer Olympics, as he announced the USA&#x27;s come-from-behind win over France:


==Personal life==
While at CNN, Hicks met his wife, Hannah Storm, currently an anchor on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;; they were married on January 8, 1994. The couple lives in Greenwich, Connecticut, with their three daughters: Hannah, Ellery, and Riley Hicks. Storm is an alumna of Notre Dame.

<doc id="1150486" wikidata="Q1865306" url="?curid=1150486" title="Tele Atlas">
<text>Tele Atlas is a Netherlands-based company founded in 1984 which delivers digital maps and other dynamic content for navigation and location-based services, including personal and in-car navigation systems, and provides data used in a wide range of mobile and Internet map applications. Since 30 July 2008, the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of automotive navigation system manufacturer TomTom.

==Operations==
The company provides maps, some sourced from other mapping companies, covering two hundred countries around the world, providing mapping data and &quot;Map Enhancement Products&quot; such as points of interest and address points. Clients of Tele Atlas include makers of automotive navigation systems as well as mobile and internet companies which provide mapping services. The firm also supplies data to clients in the public and private sectors who rely on geographic information.

==Mapping vans==

The company keeps its data up-to-date in part through a fleet of dozens of mapping vans equipped with &quot;six cameras, two side-sweeping lasers and a GPS navigation device.&quot; The vans capture about three photos per second while traveling at normal speeds, resulting in more than 100 million images per year from each van; the images are stored on one of two hard disk drives within a metal cabinet inside the van, drives that hold about two weeks of data. Meanwhile, the 3-D scanning lasers record the width, height and contours of the first reflective surface they encounter, producing data that when combined with the images create a three-dimension representation. Three-dimension representations are already available in Japan and Western Europe; employees at the company&#x27;s U.S. headquarters in Lebanon, New Hampshire, near Dartmouth College, expected in August 2009 that by the beginning of 2011, devices based on Tele Atlas data would be able to depict the surroundings in photo-realistic detail.

==Map error handling==
Map errors are handled using Tele Atlas Map Insight, described as &quot;our consumer map feedback and change reporting system&quot;. The idea is to let end users report errors directly to Tele Atlas, not via the technical support of the manufacturers of products using Tele Atlas maps, and thereby reducing support costs. Map errors are reported using the Tele Atlas Map Insight map feedback web page, to which there can be links from the supports pages of the products. Company is provided the 25% quality in their geospatial database.

==Acquisitions==

===Etak===
In May 2000, Tele Atlas acquired Etak, Inc., a United States–based vendor of automotive navigation system equipment, digital maps, and mapping software, from Sony Corporation, which became Tele Atlas North America. Etak, Inc. ceased to exist as a separate company soon after.

===GDT===
On 29 April, 2004, Tele Atlas acquired GDT (Geographic Data Technology, Inc.), a digital map supplier in New Hampshire.

===TomTom===
On 23 July 2007, a €2 billion offer for the company by navigation system maker TomTom was accepted by the Tele Atlas board. This was then trumped by a €2.3 billion offer from US-based rival Garmin on 31 October 2007 initiating a bidding war for Tele Atlas. TomTom responded by upping their bid to €2.9 billion, an offer which was again approved by the board of Tele Atlas. Garmin had been expected to counterbid once again: with Tele Atlas&#x27; main global rival Navteq subject to a takeover bid from Nokia, the company had stated that it did not wish both companies to fall into the hands of rivals. However, after striking a content agreement with Navteq through the year 2015, Garmin withdrew its takeover offer, clearing the way for TomTom. On 4 December 2007, TomTom shareholders approved the takeover. The European Commissioner for Competition cleared the takeover in May 2008, and it closed in June.

==Internet mapping agreements==
Historically, Internet mapping providers have utilized map data from a variety of vendors. Given the growth in usage of Internet mapping portals, the map suppliers have competed fiercely for that business.

On 30 June 2008, Tele Atlas announced a five-year agreement to continue to supply data to Google Maps. Under the deal, Tele Atlas was to have access to corrections and updates to the data made by the Google Maps community. Roughly a year later, in October 2009, Google discontinued using Tele Atlas maps in the United States and began collecting map feedback from consumers for their own use. Shortly thereafter, Google announced Google Maps Navigation for Android, which provides turn-by-turn navigation, similar to the functionality provided by TomTom devices, for free as part of Android.

In May 2008, Mapquest announced that it had expanded its agreement with Navteq to use Navteq map data in 73 countries. In January 2009, Microsoft announced that it had expanded its agreement with Navteq to utilize its map data for 74 countries, in addition to licensing a variety of additional content. As a result, consumers in the Internet segment are likely to be exposed to Tele Atlas data less frequently.

<doc id="1150497" wikidata="Q2652593" url="?curid=1150497" title="Caveira (parish)">
<text>Caveira is the smallest &quot;freguesia&quot; (&quot;civil parish&quot;) by area on the island of Flores, located within the municipality (&quot;concelho&quot;) of Santa Cruz das Flores, in the Azorean archipelago (Portugal). The population in 2021 was 76, in an area of 3.28 km2. It is located 5 kilometers south of Santa Cruz das Flores, the municipal seat, in an area primarily concentrating on agriculture.

==History==
The first colonists were a group of Flemish settlers captained by Willem van der Haegen, who selected the valley of Ribeira da Cruz for his settlement. They arrived at the end 15th century with the hope of finding precious metals (tin and silver, specifically), in the belief that Flores was part of the mythical Ihas Cassitérides (&quot;&quot;). They made their homes in the small grottoes along the river-valley, but when they realized that there were no deposits, they abandoned their settlement and moved to the area of Topo, on the island of São Jorge. The area remained uninhabited for many decades until the 16th century, as Father Gaspar Frutuoso noted is his historical tome Saudades da Terra and where he mentioned the community but omitted whether it was populated. The first reference to a populated settlement in Caveira appeared in the works of António Cordeiro, published in 1717, citing the existence of a small place along the coast.

From here Caveira evolved, becoming a primitive community dependent on the much larger administrative and religious village of Santa Cruz (whose parish included Caveira). Owing to the distance and difficulty in traveling from the valley of Ribeira da Cruz, in 1757, the parish vicar (Father Agostinho Pereira de Lacerda) requested that the bishop of Angra (at that time Brother Valério do Sacramento) annex Caveira to the neighboring parish of São Caetano da Lomba (even though it was part of the neighboring municipality). The situation did not improve communication or the betterment of the faith community connected to Lomba, and with the assistance of a local property-holder (José António de Sousa Bettencourt of Graciosa), a small chapel was constructed on the current site of the local cemetery. The chapel to the invocation of Benditas Almas (Blessed Souls), was 12 metres in length and 4.2 meters in width. Once completed, the parish priest José Joaquim de Almeida quickly petitioned that Caveira should be elevated to parish, going as far as a petition directly to King John VI of Portugal (dated December 19, 1823). The church remained the property of João António Bettencourt (a descendant) who maintained the building in a reasonable condition, but its condition degraded considerably. In a report by the Civil Governor of the District of Horta (in 1867), António José Vieira Santa Rita reported the lamentable condition of the sanctuary. The cornerstone of the new church was laid on June 13, 1870, but its completion was slow and difficult. Although supported by emigres to the United States and notable local residents, such as the Visconde da Silva Figueira, the main chapel wasn&#x27;t completed until September 11, 1880. From this time the new church was named for Nossa Senhora do Livramento, although the Church in Angra refused to accept the change.

In the beginning of the 20th century, rich in dairy resources, a local man (José Luís) began a local butter-producing business focused on the local Caveirense market. As the local population slowly shrank, the business was eventually integrated into the União das Cooperatives.

===Legend of Caveira===
During the 16th century, during the Age of Exploration, caravels frequently passed along Flores, on their voyages between Europe and the Americas. These ships were regularly buffeted by Atlantic storms and shipwrecked along the coast. It is said that a survivor of one of these storms, hungry, wet and cold, appeared along a windy and rugged part of the north-east coast, where he was given food, dry clothes and cared for by the local residents. The man, Demétrio, began to enjoy his life in the small village, married and remained there, where he became a popular with its residents. Although a good Christian man, he had many ideas that were considered heretical: for example, he exclaimed that prayers for the dead had no meaning and he negated the existence of Purgatory or Hell. Finally, although he believed in a soul, he believed that it resided in the blood, and that upon a human&#x27;s death it separated from the body and transformed into a bird, until the body was cremated or degenerated into the soil. He also believed that the bird was the incarnation of Morana, the god of death, and that it sang while the body died, facilitating the soul&#x27;s entrance into heaven.

While his neighbours did not accept his ideas, he continued to live, educating his sons, and living in harmony with the residents of the village. After a few years, Demétrio, now an old man, after many years in bed with illness, died. At that moment a wagtail flew onto a faia tree close by, but did not begin to sing as was expected. Demétrio was buried on top of a mountain, and his wife, influenced by her husband&#x27;s faith, was a little preoccupied with the fact that the bird did not sing. After some time afterword there started to appear a skull (Portuguese: &quot;caveira&quot;) with an inner light, and the local residents believed that it was Demétrio&#x27;s soul trying to obtain prayers in order to be delivered from Purgatory. Someone then decided to begin services and pray the rosary for God&#x27;s intercession on behalf of the good, but heretical, Demétrio. After a short time, the bird began to sing and the skull stopped appearing. At the top of the rugged rock the family constructed a niche, with a panel representing the skull, but the name of the village began to referred to as Caveira.

== Geography ==

===Physical geography===
The small parish is located along a promontory divided by a couple of river-valleys: Ribeira da Cruz, in the north, which bisects the hamlet, and Ribeira da Silva, in the south, which separates the civil parish from Lomba, in the municipality of Lajes das Flores. In addition, the Ribeira do Moirato bisects the southern portion of the parish and joins the Ribeira da Silva to empty into the ocean along Fajã Pedro Vieira. The Caveira promontory is encircled by basaltic fractures and dominated by Ponta da Caveira, an area formed from large polychromatic basalts formations where the community is situated. The northern Ribeira da Cruz is an open escarpment and valley that extends towards the center of the island. Near the mouth of the Ribeira da Cruz is the large cliffs of Rocha Fernão Jorge, a semi-triangular physical feature formed from basaltic prisms originating from lava flows. It is a unique feature, similarly found in Antsiranana Bay, northern Madagascar.

Along the coast is the Gruta dos Encharéus, a large cavern/fracture at the base of Ponta da Caveira (50 meters width, 25 meters long and 15 meters in depth) where boats may penetrate and dock. It was once used as a hideout for pirates, privateers and smugglers in the past, but is currently a tourist site.

===Climate===
The higher altitudes makes the parish susceptible to strong ocean winds. Heavy precipitation in this zone allows agriculture to thrive, and in particular the raising of dairy cattle.

===Human geography===
The catholic faith community is guided by Nossa Senhora do Livramento, although officially still holding onto the primitive &quot;Benditas Almas&quot; canonical titles. Its relative proximity to Santa Cruz has allowed the growth of secondary industries associated with activities in the municipal center. The parish also contains the locality Espigão.

==Economy==
The community is focused on agricultural production, and in particular dairy activities. As mentioned, João Luís, was the principal investor in the local butter industry in Caveira. In other communities on Flores, other businessmen concentrated on the single-market butter business; for example, Ponta Ruiva and Ponta Delgada had their own butter factories serving their own markets. These smaller communities did not participate in the Florense agricultural syndicate pioneered by José Furtado Mota at the time. This created tensions between consumers and producers, who remarked in a 1918 Açoreano Oriental article that residents of Santa Cruz were never supplied butter, even as 10,000 kilograms of butter were being exported. Local residents of this community were required to travel to any of the outlying communities in order to purchase butter, including Caveira. The gradual de-population of this community spelled the extinction of the private butter industry, as the União das Cooperatives swallowed-up smaller businesses.

<text>Richard Andrew Patten (May 13, 1942 – December 30, 2021) was a Canadian politician. Patten was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1987 to 1990 and again from 1995 to 2007. He represented the riding of Ottawa Centre. He served as a cabinet minister in the government of David Peterson.

==Personal life==
Patten was educated at Sir George Williams University in Montreal. He worked as a manager with the Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association (YMCA), and served as President of the &quot;Canadian Council for International Cooperation&quot;. Patten sat on an NGO advisory committee to the World Bank while with the CCIC. He died on December 30, 2021, at the age of 79.

==Politics==
In the 1987 provincial election, Patten ran as the Liberal candidate in the riding of Ottawa Centre. He defeated incumbent New Democrat Evelyn Gigantes by just over 2,000 votes. The Liberal party won the election and Patten was appointed Minister of Government Services. In August 1989 he was shuffled to Minister of Correctional Services.

In the 1990 provincial election Patten was defeated by his NDP rival Gigantes. For the next five years, Patten served as President and CEO of the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) Foundation, doing extensive fund-raising work for the organization.

In 1995 provincial election Patten campaigned against Gigantes once again this time defeating her by 1,700 votes. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Patten joined 29 other Liberals in the opposition. He attempted to mobilize a campaign for the party&#x27;s leadership in 1996, but failed in this effort and subsequently supported Dwight Duncan. When Duncan was eliminated after the third ballot, he endorsed Dalton McGuinty, the eventual winner.

In the 1999 provincial election, Patten was re-elected over Progressive Conservative Ray Kostuch and New Democrat Elisabeth Arnold. The Progressive Conservatives again won the election, and Patten remained in opposition. Patten was treated for non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma during this parliament.

The Liberals won the 2003 election and he was re-elected again by over 10,000 votes. During this session he served as parliamentary assistant to the Minister of Education, the Minister of Economic Development and Trade and to Premier Dalton McGuinty. Patten maintained a strong interest in the CHEO and devoted legislative efforts towards the centre&#x27;s operations.

On 14 March 2007, Patten announced he would not seek re-election in the upcoming election, preferring to focus on work with the CHEO Foundation.

<doc id="1150501" wikidata="Q1144268" url="?curid=1150501" title="Inside the Actors Studio">
<text>Inside the Actors Studio is an American talk show that airs on Ovation. The series premiered on June 12, 1994 on Bravo, airing for 22 seasons and was hosted by James Lipton from its premiere until 2018. It is taped at the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University&#x27;s New York City campus.

On April 2, 2019, it was announced that the show would move to Ovation with the 23rd and final season premiering on October 13, 2019. Ovation acquired the rights to all previous seasons. The show concluded its run on December 15, 2019.

==About the program==
The program began as a televised craft seminar for students of the Actors Studio Drama School, originally a joint venture of the Actors Studio and New School University in 1994, with Paul Newman, a former Actors Studio president, as its first guest, and soon became Bravo&#x27;s flagship program. At first taped at the New School&#x27;s Tishman Auditorium in Greenwich Village, New York City, it was shifted subsequently to its present location, Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University&#x27;s New York City campus. The program is presented as a seminar to students of the Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University.

The show deliberately uses a slower pace in the interviews as compared with a typical celebrity interview, thus cameras usually record a couple of hours of conversation, later edited to one or two hours. The result, as a &quot;New York Times&quot; article expressed it, &quot;In Mr. Lipton&#x27;s guest chair, actors cease being stars for a while and become artists and teachers.&quot; Though sometimes, some interviews go longer; Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1999 visit, for example, stretched to four hours, and was later shown as two episodes of one hour each. The interviews are guided by Lipton&#x27;s trademark index-card questions, which sometimes reveal his well-researched knowledge of guests&#x27; lives, often startling some. On one such occasion, Billy Crystal told Lipton, &quot;You know you&#x27;re scary, don&#x27;t you?&quot; On another occasion, Martin Sheen asked Lipton, &quot;How do you know all this? This is extraordinary.&quot; And Sir Anthony Hopkins, upon learning that Lipton knew the exact address where the former had been born and raised in Wales, turned to the audience and remarked, &quot;He&#x27;s a detective, you know.&quot;

In May 2005, the contract between the Actors Studio and New School University was not renewed. Beginning with the 12th season, in the fall of 2005, the program was taped at the Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts at Pace University&#x27;s New York City campus. The show featured a new set with a gritty backstage feel, designed by Will Rothfuss for Blair Broadcast Designs, and The Actors Studio Drama School at Pace University re-opened in new facilities.
Since its premiere, &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot; has had over 300 guests. The first episode&#x27;s guest was Paul Newman (Alec Baldwin was the first guest, but his interview was broadcast after Newman&#x27;s). The guests have included 74 Academy Award winners: eight directors; four screenwriters; 61 actors and actresses; and three composers. For its 200th show, Lipton became the guest subject of the show. He was questioned by Dave Chappelle, whom he picked personally. The show ended with the Pace University provost announcing that the college is sponsoring a scholarship in Chappelle&#x27;s name to his high school alma mater. Based on the show, James Lipton published a book titled &quot;Inside Inside&quot; in 2007. In September 2018, Lipton declared that he was stepping down from the program after 23 seasons. Starting in 2019, the show is hosted by different celebrities.

In his review of the program, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; critic A.A. Gill wrote: &quot;The format is simple and idiotically inspired. The Actors Studio is the New York drama school made famous by Stanislavsky and his method (although the series is now filmed elsewhere). These shows are thinly set-up masterclasses for students. The cleverness is in the vanity it allows the guests, who are the very greatest and most self-regarding performers and creators of theatre and film. People who are too grand to talk to anyone will talk to &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;. They believe they&#x27;re giving something back, offering precious pearls of insight to a new generation. And who doesn&#x27;t look good passing it on to adoring students? In truth, it&#x27;s just a chat show on satellite, but the veil of education and posterity is held decorously high, so everybody turns up and talks with a smile.&quot;

While most of the show is a one-on-one interview conducted by the host (Lipton in the first 22 seasons, rotating hosts since season 23), this is followed by the host submitting a questionnaire to the guest. The questionnaire concept was originated by French television personality Bernard Pivot on his show &quot;Apostrophes&quot;, after the Proust Questionnaire. The 10 questions Lipton asks are:

#What is your favorite word?
#What is your least favorite word?
#What turns you on?
#What turns you off?
#What sound or noise do you love?
#What sound or noise do you hate?
#What is your favorite curse word?
#What profession other than your own would you like to attempt?
#What profession would you not like to do?
#If heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the pearly gates?

The program usually concludes with a question-and-answer session with the students.

In France, the show has been broadcast since 1999 on Paris Première, with French subtitles.

==In popular culture==

The show has been good-naturedly lampooned for Lipton&#x27;s paused and somewhat clipped delivery on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in which Will Ferrell portrayed Lipton interviewing himself as an annoyed guest. He was also spoofed on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, where character Rainier Wolfcastle (a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger) shoots his interviewer and a dying Lipton croaks, &quot;It&#x27;s a pleasure to eat your lead, good sir.&quot; In another episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, in which Homer donates a kidney, he single-mindedly rushes his family home so he can watch the &quot;Inside The Actors Studio&quot; interview of F. Murray Abraham. Ferrell, with his &quot;Old School&quot; co-stars Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson and director Todd Phillips, again portrayed a satirical version of Lipton in a skit called &quot;Inside the Actors Studio Spoof&quot;, which can be seen as part of the DVD release special features for the film. Ferrell appears as himself and answers questions poking fun at some of his less successful films, such as &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;, in what is obviously a comedic take on Lipton&#x27;s reverential approach to his interviewees. Comedian Will Sasso portrayed Lipton on &quot;Mad TV&quot; and David Cross parodied him as Cyrus on &quot;Mr Show&quot;. Weird Al Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Couch Potato&quot; describes &quot;James Lipton discussing the oeuvre of Mr. Rob Schneider.&quot; among other things on TV. In the &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode &quot;Werewolf,&quot; Mike Nelson hits his head and thinks he is James Lipton.

* From the show&#x27;s beginnings, Lipton had tried to persuade Marlon Brando to come on the show. Although a charter member of the Actors Studio, Brando flatly refused; speaking in a 2012 interview, it was the only such categorical rejection Lipton could recall:
[B]y the time I started the show -- although he was a member of the Actor&#x27;s Studio and had been trained by Stella Adler as I was; we knew each other, and we used to talk on the phone for hours at a time -- but by that time he was already reclusive. I couldn&#x27;t get him out of the house and neither could anyone else.

==Home media==
Selected episodes of the show have been released by Shout! Factory. Three DVDs containing a single episode each feature Robin Williams, Johnny Depp, Dave Chappelle and Barbra Streisand. Two compilation sets were also released. &quot;Leading Men&quot; features Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Sean Penn, and Russell Crowe. &quot;Icons&quot; features Clint Eastwood, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and Barbra Streisand.

== Awards ==
The show has been nominated for 18 Emmy awards, winning once (in 2013).

<doc id="1150503" wikidata="Q942184" url="?curid=1150503" title="Greatest Hits (Shania Twain album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits album by Canadian singer-songwriter Shania Twain, released on November 8, 2004, by Mercury Nashville. The album contains seventeen of Twain&#x27;s top ten hits, including all of her seven number one hits on the Hot Country Songs. Excluded from the track list is Twain&#x27;s self-titled debut album, of which no songs were included. Some songs are included in their pop versions such as &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot;.

Three new songs were recorded specifically for the compilation and were all released as singles: &quot;Party for Two&quot; (featuring either Mark McGrath or Billy Currington), &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot;, and &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Quitter&quot;. &quot;Party for Two&quot; went on to peak at number seven on the Hot Country Songs chart and peaked within the top ten in six other countries. &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; was a moderate hit, peaking within the top twenty on the Adult Contemporary chart and the top 40 in the UK. &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Quitter&quot; was one of Twain&#x27;s least successful singles, becoming her first since &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; to miss the top 40 at US country.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was a commercial success; It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and at number one on the Top Country Albums chart with 530,000 copies sold, staying there for eleven consecutive weeks. The album was also the highest selling country album in the US for 2005, and was certified 4× platinum in the US and 3× platinum in the UK. Additionally, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was recognized by &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the fastest-selling greatest hits album by a female artist in the US. As of December 2019, the album has sold 4.4 million copies in the US.
&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; also debuted at number one in Canada with first-week sales of 92,600.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was released on vinyl for the first time on November 17, 2023. It is available in four versions: a standard black vinyl, and three limited editions vinyls: opaque blue, baby pink, and Coke bottle clear. The vinyl release contains two additional songs from Twain&#x27;s studio albums released after &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; initial release: &quot;Life&#x27;s About to Get Good&quot; from Twain&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Now&quot; (2017) and &quot;Giddy Up!&quot; from her sixth studio album &quot;Queen of Me&quot; (2023).

== Content ==
&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; includes 17 of Twain&#x27;s previous singles. Three selections from her then-most recent album &quot;Up!&quot; (2002) are included, which were &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Getcha Good!&quot;, &quot;Forever and for Always&quot;, and &quot;Up!&quot;. The first two are included in their &quot;red&quot; (pop) versions, while the title track, in North American and Australian versions, is included in its &quot;green&quot; (country) version. &quot;Ka-Ching!&quot; was included exclusively in the European edition as it was a huge success in that region. Eight singles from &quot;Come On Over&quot; (1997) were included. Some, like &quot;That Don&#x27;t Impress Me Much&quot;, are notably included in their pop version. Six of the eight singles from &quot;The Woman in Me&quot; (1995) are on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Notably absent from the track list is Twain&#x27;s 1993 self-titled debut album, of which no songs were included.

Three new songs were recorded for the compilation. The first of the new tracks is &quot;Party for Two&quot;. Twain recorded it as a duet with both Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath and country musician Billy Currington. The song is lyrically about Twain enticing a guy to come to a party, which he&#x27;s at first hesitant but when Twain shows it&#x27;s just for the two of them he decides to join. The pop mix featuring McGrath was released to pop, adult contemporary, and international markets; likewise, the country version featuring Currington was released to country radio. The country version was not included in the European version of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; but was included as a b-side on the CD single for &quot;Party for Two&quot;. The second song included on the compilation is the adult contemporary influenced country ballad &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; lyrically involves Twain wishing a partner for forgiveness. The third and final song included on &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is the pure-country &quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Quitter&quot;. The song lyrically speaks of Twain sticking with an overconfident and brassy man.

In the 2023 reissue of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, two songs from Twain&#x27;s later career were included. The first is &quot;Life&#x27;s About to Get Good&quot;, which was originally on her fifth studio album &quot;Now&quot; (2017). The second song that was included in the reissue is &quot;Giddy Up!&quot;, included on her sixth studio album &quot;Queen of Me&quot; (2023).

== Singles ==

&quot;Party for Two&quot; was released as the lead single from &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, released on September 7, 2004. Proving to become one of her last hits, it made its debut on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart the week of September 18, 2004, at number 39, becoming the &quot;Hot Shot Debut&quot; of the week. It would reach its peak position of number 7 on December 25, 2004, becoming Twain&#x27;s 16th and final top-ten country single to date. The track also became a decently sized A/C hit, hitting number 16 on the US Adult Contemporary chart. Internationally, the song reach the top ten in the United Kingdom, Austria, Denmark, and Canada. The track would be nominated at the 2005 CMA Awards for Musical Event of the Year, which it lost to George Strait and Lee Ann Womack&#x27;s &quot;Good News, Bad News&quot;.

&quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; was released as the second single from the album on January 18, 2005. Twain did not promote the single at the time of its release, as she was battling Lyme disease and was unable to perform. It peaked at number 24 on the US country airplay chart, her first single since &quot;Rock This Country!&quot; (2000) to miss the top-twenty. The track failed to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, although it still peaked at number 22 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. In Twain&#x27;s native Canada however, it was a success, hitting numbers four and nine on the &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot; Canada Country and AC charts. &quot;Don&#x27;t!&quot; became Twain&#x27;s worst-performing single in the United Kingdom, peaking at number 30.

&quot;I Ain&#x27;t No Quitter&quot; was serviced to country radio stations on May 2, 2005, as the third and final single. Despite being seen as a potential summer anthem, it became one of Twain&#x27;s least successful singles in part due to lack of promotion. Entering at number 55 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart on May 21, 2005, it reached a dismal peak of number 45 on the chart and spent only 8 weeks in total. It was Twain&#x27;s first single since &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; (1996) to miss the top-forty. It was still a success in Canada, hitting number 8 on the country chart.

== Commercial performance ==
&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 530,000 copies in its first week. The album was blocked from the number one spot by Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Encore&quot;, which sold 710,000 copies in its debut week. The Guinness World Records recognizes &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; as the fastest-selling greatest hits album of all time by a female artist in the US. On the Top Country Albums chart, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; immediately debuted at number one. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; spent eleven non-consecutive weeks at number one and was the best selling country album of 2005. It has spent 256 weeks on the chart to date. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart on November 27, 2004, and spent five weeks at number one. It has charted for 124 weeks in the country.

Internationally, the compilation was a success. &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; debuted at its peak position of number six on the UK Albums Chart on November 20, 2004; it spent two non-consecutive weeks at its peak and spent 31 weeks on the chart. The album debuted at number three in both Germany and Austria while debuting at number four in Switzerland. The album also cracked the top ten in Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, and Scotland.

<text>William Langewiesche () (born June 12, 1955) is an American author and journalist who was also a professional airplane pilot for many years. Since 2019, he has been a writer at large for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. Prior to that, he was a correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazines for twenty-nine years. He is the author of nine books and the winner of two National Magazine Awards.

==Career==

William Langewiesche is a writer at large for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. From 2006–2019 he was an international correspondent for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. Prior to that, he was the national correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; magazine where he was nominated for eight consecutive National Magazine Awards. He has written articles covering a wide range of topics from shipbreaking, wine critics, the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, modern ocean piracy, nuclear proliferation, and the World Trade Center cleanup.

Langewiesche grew up in Princeton, New Jersey where he attended Princeton Day School, and went on to attended college in California, where he received a degree in cultural anthropology from Stanford University. He spent much of his time on various jobs flying airplanes, a skill he had acquired because of his family background.
After college, Langewiesche moved to New York City and went to work as a writer for &quot;Flying&quot;, a large-circulation publication for general aviation pilots. While there he wrote technical reports on the flight characteristics of various airplanes and profiles of people. In his mid-twenties, he quit the job in order to write books—one non-fiction, and two novels—none of which were published.

He continued to travel and write, supporting himself by flying airplanes. The travels eventually took Langewiesche to the most remote parts of the Sahara desert and sub-Saharan West Africa. This became the subject of a cover story for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in 1991, and later of a book titled &quot;Sahara Unveiled&quot;. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; sent Langewiesche to many parts of the world and increasingly into conflict zones. In 2006, while living in Baghdad to cover the Iraq War, Langewiesche left &quot;The Atlantic&quot; and went to work for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

After the attacks of 9/11, Langewiesche was the only journalist given full unrestricted access to the World Trade Center site. He stayed there for nearly six months and produced &quot;American Ground&quot;, a serialized report in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. &quot;American Ground&quot; became a &quot;New York Times&quot; national bestselling book.

Langewiesche&#x27;s 2007 article &quot;Jungle Law&quot; involved him in the controversy surrounding Chevron Corporation and Steven R. Donziger.

==Personal life==
Langewiesche is the son of Wolfgang Langewiesche, author of &quot;Stick and Rudder&quot;. He lives in New York and France.

<text>Driel is a village in the municipality of Overbetuwe, approximately four kilometers southwest of Arnhem on the south bank of the Rhine, in the Netherlands.

==History==
On 21 September 1944, Driel was the drop zone of the Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade which participated in Operation Market Garden. The brigade was under the command of Major General Sosabowski. After World War II, in the 1960s, the Polish monument was placed at the &#x27;Polish Square&#x27; (, ). A nearby plaque commemorates the ninety-four Polish soldiers who fell nearby. There are several other plaques, including one in honour of the 1st Airborne Division, along the dike between Heteren, Driel and Arnhem.

On 19 September 2009 the Dutch premier Jan Peter Balkenende and the Polish premier Donald Tusk visited Driel to commemorate the 65th anniversary of Operation Market Garden.

<text>&quot;A Report to an Academy&quot; (German: &quot;Ein Bericht für eine Akademie&quot;) is a short story by Franz Kafka, written and published in 1917. In the story, an ape named Red Peter, who has learned to behave like a human, presents to an academy the story of how he effected his transformation. The story was first published by Martin Buber in the German monthly &quot;Der Jude&quot;, along with another of Kafka&#x27;s stories, &quot;Jackals and Arabs&quot; (&quot;Schakale und Araber&quot;). The story appeared again in a 1919 collection titled &quot;Ein Landarzt&quot; (&quot;A Country Doctor&quot;).

==Plot==
The narrator, speaking before a scientific conference, describes his former life as an ape. His story begins in a West African jungle, in which a hunting expedition shoots and captures him. Caged on a ship for his voyage to Europe, he finds himself for the first time without the freedom to move as he will. Needing to escape from this situation, he studies the habits of the crew, and imitates them with surprising ease; he reports encountering particular difficulty only in learning to drink alcohol. Throughout the story, the narrator reiterates that he learned his human behavior not out of any desire to be human, but only to provide himself with a means of escape from his cage.

Upon arriving in Europe, the ape realizes that he is faced with a choice between the &quot;Zoological Garden&quot; or the &quot;Music Hall&quot;, and devotes himself to becoming human enough to become an able performer. He accomplishes this, with the help of many teachers, and reports to the academy that his transformation is so complete that he can no longer properly describe his emotions and experiences as an ape. In concluding, the ape expresses a degree of satisfaction with his lot.

==Analysis==
Walter Herbert Sokel has suggested that the story speaks to a conflict &quot;between internal and external continuity in the ape&#x27;s existence&quot;. The preservation of the life of the protagonist is dependent upon his casting off memory and identity; only by achieving the end of that internal identity could actual biological life be maintained. Thus, for the ape, &quot;identity is performance&quot;; &quot;It is not a static essence, a given, but a constantly reenacted self-representation.&quot;

The motif of the changeability of identity may have ramifications in the context of Zionism and the Jewish diaspora, as &quot;A Report to an Academy&quot; first appeared in a Zionist magazine. Nicholas Murray briefly suggests in his 2004 biography of Kafka that the story is a satirization of Jews&#x27; assimilation into Western culture.

The story&#x27;s references to the protagonist&#x27;s &quot;apish past&quot; (&quot;äffisches Vorleben&quot;) have led some literary theorists to associate the story with evolutionary theory.

In J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s novel &quot;Elizabeth Costello&quot;, the title character gives a central place to &quot;A Report to an Academy&quot; in her speech about vegetarianism and animal rights. She also suggests that Kafka may have been influenced by German psychologist Wolfgang Köhler&#x27;s &quot;The Mentality of Apes&quot;, also published in 1917. However, historian Gregory Radick suggests that a more likely inspiration for Kafka was the work of the American psychologist Lightner Witmer. In 1909 Witmer staged a widely publicized test of the mental abilities of a vaudeville chimp named Peter. This test, conducted in front of a panel of scientists, included a demonstration of Peter&#x27;s ability to say several words, including &quot;momma.&quot; An alternative possibility given that Kafka explicitly states in explaining the origin of the name &quot;Red Peter&quot; that he is not &quot;the performing ape Peter&quot; is that Kafka had read one of the many newspaper reports about the vaudeville performing Peter, either when touring in France and Germany in 1908, or after a trip to the USA on his return to Europe which included a planned visit to Heidelberg.

==Adaptations==
Mexican actor Humberto Dupeyron has performed an adaptation of this story as a play, &quot;The Gorilla&quot;.

An adaptation was broadcast in the BBC radio series &quot;Thirty-Minute Theatre&quot; on 7 December 1969.

In 1987 South African actor Marius Weyers performed an adaptation to rave reviews in Los Angeles. Critics noted the parallels with apartheid race science.

In 1989 the monologuist and writer Andrew Tansey adapted and premiered &quot;The Greatest Ape&quot;, an adaptation of the story, at the Edinburgh International Festival, before touring Britain and the United States. The critically acclaimed production was directed by Paul Dodwell.

In 2009 a theatrical adaptation by Colin Teevan opened at the Young Vic in London. The hour-long solo piece was directed by Walter Meierjohann, and Kathryn Hunter&#x27;s performance as Red Peter the ape was widely acclaimed. In 2013 the play was set up at the Baryshnikov Arts Center.

The 2001 film &quot;Human Nature&quot;, written by Charlie Kaufman, is a loose adaptation of Kafka&#x27;s short story.

In 2013 another adaptation of the story was staged in Montreal under the title &quot;Kafka&#x27;s Ape&quot;, presented by independent theater company Infinitheatre. Guy Sprung directed Howard Rosenstein in the role of Red Peter.

In Ceridwen Dovey&#x27;s 2014 story collection &quot;Only the Animals&quot; the story &quot;Red Peter&#x27;s Little Lady (Soul of Chimpanzee)&quot; uses Kafka&#x27;s story as the jumping-off point for a tale of a dead chimpanzee who recounts his experiences as an animal trained to act human.

The story was adapted as a comic album by Mahi Grand and published by French company Dargaud in 2022.

<text>Sha&#x27;ar ha Gilgulim () or Gate of Reincarnations is a kabbalistic work on gilgul, the concept of reincarnation, assmebled by Hayyim Vital, who recorded the teachings of his master Isaac Luria in the 16th century.

==Authors==
Based primarily on the &quot;Zohar&quot;, specifically the section &quot;Mishpatim&quot;, where &quot;gilgulim&quot; are discussed, it also borrows heavily from the teachings of Isaac Luria (1534-1572). The book was composed by Luria&#x27;s disciple Hayyim Vital and amended by his son, Shmuel Vital, as a section or &quot;gate,&quot; of the primary Kabbalistic text &quot;Etz Hayim&quot;.

==Contents==
As well as outlining principles of personal rectification or tikkun and reincarnation, this work describes the spiritual roots of many of the great Torah scholars of the past. Furthermore, it often provides information about the future in terms of predicting challenges to be expected throughout Jewish history and particularly the End of Days.

<doc id="1150532" wikidata="Q1270246" url="?curid=1150532" title="Brent Crude">
<text>Brent Crude may refer to any or all of the components of the Brent Complex, a physically and financially traded oil market based around the North Sea of Northwest Europe; colloquially, Brent Crude usually refers to the price of the ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Brent Crude Oil futures contract or the contract itself. The original Brent Crude referred to a trading classification of sweet light crude oil first extracted from the Brent oilfield in the North Sea in 1976. As production from the Brent oilfield declined to zero in 2021, crude oil blends from other oil fields have been added to the trade classification. The current Brent blend consists of crude oil produced from the Forties (added 2002), Oseberg (added 2002), Ekofisk (added 2007), Troll (added 2018) oil fields (also known as the BFOET Quotation) and oil drilled from Midland, Texas in the Permian Basin (added 2023).

The Brent Crude oil marker is also known as Brent Blend, London Brent and Brent petroleum. This grade is described as light because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulphur content.

Brent is the leading global price benchmark for Atlantic basin crude oils. It is used to set the price of two-thirds of the world&#x27;s internationally traded crude oil supplies. It is one of the two main benchmark prices for purchases of oil worldwide, the other being West Texas Intermediate (WTI).

==Brent Complex==
Popular media references to &quot;Brent crude&quot; usually refers to the ICE Brent crude oil futures price. The ICE Brent crude oil futures price is part of the Brent Complex, a physical and financial market for crude oil based around the North Sea of Northwest Europe, which could include numerous elements that can be referred to as Brent crude:
* Brent crude oil monthly futures contracts
* Brent crude oil monthly forward contracts
* Brent crude oil weekly Contract-for-Difference (CFD)
* Dated Brent short-term assessed prices
* Brent-Forties-Oseberg-Ekofisk-Troll_WTI (BFOETI), Dated Brent, or Brent spot market
* Brent oilfield crude oil blend
* ICE Brent Index
The Brent Complex fosters commercial transactions of Brent crude oil, gathers price data those transactions (in forwards, CFDs, and Dated Brent), establishes reference prices for other global oil trade transactions (in Dated Brent assessed prices, Dated BFOET assessed prices, forward traded prices, and futures traded prices), and transfers risks of those transactions (through hedging in forward and futures markets).

==Brent crude oil futures contracts==
===ICE Brent crude oil futures===
The ICE Futures Europe symbol for Brent crude oil futures is B. It was originally traded on the open outcry International Petroleum Exchange in London starting in 1988, but since 2005 has been traded on the electronic Intercontinental Exchange, known as ICE. One contract equals and quoted in U.S. dollars. Up to 96 contracts, for 96 consecutive months, in the Brent crude oil futures contract series are available for trading. For example, before the last trading date for May 2020, 96 contracts, from contracts for May 2020, June 2020, July 2020 ... Mar 2028, April 2028, and May 2028 are available for trading. ICE Clear Europe acts as the central counterparty for Brent crude oil and related contracts. Brent contracts are deliverable contracts based on &#x27;Exchange of Futures for Physicals&#x27; (EFP) delivery with an option to cash settle against the ICE Brent Index price for the last trading day of the futures contract.

===CME Brent crude oil futures===
In addition to ICE, two types of Brent crude financial futures are also traded on the NYMEX (now part of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). They are ultimately priced in relation to the ICE Brent crude oil futures and the ICE Brent Index.

Brent Crude Oil Penultimate Financial Futures, also known as Brent Crude Oil Futures, are traded using the symbol BB, and are cash settled based on the ICE Brent Crude Oil Futures 1st nearby contract settlement price on the penultimate trading day for the delivery month.

Brent Last Day Financial Futures, also known as Brent Crude Oil Financial Futures, are traded using the symbol BZ, and are cash settled based on the ICE Brent Crude Oil Index price as published one day after the final trading day for the delivery month.
===Role in hedging===
Although price discovery for the Brent Complex is driven in the Brent forward market, many hedgers and traders prefer to use futures contracts like the ICE Brent futures contract to avoid the risk of large physical deliveries. If the market participant is using Brent futures to hedge physical oil transactions based on Dated Brent, they will still face basis risk between Dated Brent and EFP prices. Hedgers could use a Crude Diff or &#x27;Dated to Front Line&#x27; (DFL) contract, which is a spread contract between Dated Brent and Brent 1st Line Future (the front month future), to hedge the basis risk. So a complete hedge would be the relevant Brent futures contract, and a DFL contract when the futures contract becomes the front month future. This is equivalent to a Brent forward contract and a CFD contract in forward contract terms.

===Price difference with WTI===

Historically, price differences between Brent and other index crudes have been based on physical differences in crude oil specifications and short-term variations in supply and demand. Prior to September 2010, there existed a typical price difference per barrel of between ±3 USD/bbl compared to WTI and OPEC Basket; however, since the autumn of 2010 Brent has been priced much higher than WTI, reaching a difference of more than $11 a barrel by the end of February 2011 (WTI: US$104/bbl, LCO: US$116/bbl). In February 2011 the divergence reached $16 during a supply glut, record stockpiles, at Cushing, Oklahoma before peaking at above $23 in August 2012. It has since (September 2012) decreased significantly to around $18 after refinery maintenance settled down and supply issues eased slightly.

Many reasons have been given for this divergence ranging from regional demand variations, to the depletion of the North Sea oil fields.

The US Energy Information Administration attributes the price spread between WTI and Brent to an oversupply of crude oil in the interior of North America (WTI price is set at Cushing, Oklahoma) caused by rapidly increasing oil production from unconventional reservoirs such as Canadian oil sands and tight oil formations such as the Bakken Formation, Niobrara Formation, and Eagle Ford Formation. Oil production in the interior of North America has exceeded the capacity of pipelines to carry it to markets on the Gulf Coast and east coast of North America; as a result, the oil price on the US and Canadian east coast and parts of the US Gulf Coast since 2011 has been set by the price of Brent Crude, while markets in the interior still follow the WTI price. Much US and Canadian crude oil from the interior is now shipped to the coast by railroad, which is much more expensive than pipeline.

===April 2020 WTI negative pricing and Brent vulnerability===
On April 20, 2020, the CME WTI futures contract for May 2020 settled at −US$37.63 a barrel due to oil demand shocks from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to dwindling storage capacity at the futures contract delivery point at Cushing, Oklahoma. Brent settled for US$26.21 at the same time, for a difference of $63.84. While the oil demand shock and limited storage capacity affects both WTI and Brent futures contracts, Brent contracts have greater access to storage, and greater buffers to absorb demand shocks than the WTI contracts. Brent futures contracts could theoretically access the storage capacity of all the shore tanks in North West Europe and of available shipping storage, while CME WTI contracts are restricted to storage and pipeline capacity at Cushing only. Brent futures contracts are traded in relation with Dated Brent and other contracts in the Brent Complex, allowing other contracts in the system to absorb demand shocks. Up to April 20, most of the demand shock from the COVID-19 pandemic has been absorbed by Dated Brent contracts and Dated Brent quality differentials, which spared pricing pressure on Brent futures contracts. While Brent is more insulated to negative pricing by these factors than WTI, negative prices are still possible should oil demand and storage capacity fall further.

==Brent crude oil monthly forward contracts==
Brent crude oil monthly forward contracts started trading in 1983 as &quot;open&quot; contracts, or contracts that specify delivery month but not the delivery date. From 1983 to 1985, these contracts were for 500,000 barrels of Brent Blend crude, and were increased to 600,000 barrels after 1985. Deals were made bilaterally between two parties by telephone and confirmed by telex. Payment for deals were made 30 days after oil delivery. Since deals were bilateral and not centrally cleared like futures transactions, parties to the deal sought financial guarantees such as letters of credit to minimize counterparty credit risk. Contracts for one and two months forward were available in 1983, contracts for three months forward were available in 1984, contracts for four months forward were available in 1985, and contracts for at least four months are available for trading today. Sellers of Brent forward contracts initially had to give buyers a notice of at least 15 days of intention to deliver. More recently, the notice period has expanded to 10 days to one month ahead. This shifted the front month of the Brent forward contract. For example, on May 4, the Front Month forward contract (also known as M1) is the July contract, the Second Month (M2) contract is the August contract, and the Third Month (M3) contract is the September contract.

Producers and refiners buy and sell oil on the market for wholesale trade, hedging, and tax purposes. Producers without integrated refinery operations, and vice versa for refiners without oil production, had to sell oil and could hedge oil price risk with forward contracts. Integrated oil producers (those with refinery operations) had the same motives, but had an extra incentive to lower taxes. Integrated oil producers faced taxes when transferring oil internally from production to refining operations. These taxes are calculated based on a reference price originally set by BNOC and eventually calculated as a 30-day price average of spot prices before an oil transaction. Forward market prices tended to be lower than these reference prices a lot of the times, and integrated oil producers could profitably lower their tax obligations by selling oil on the forward market from their production operations, and buying back oil from unrelated parties for their refining operations on the same market. This practice became less prevalent with the introduction of tougher regulations in 1987.

Speculators became bilateral intermediaries between producers and refiners, and speculative deals came to dominate the forward market. Since there was no central clearing of those forward contracts, speculators who bought Brent forwards at the time and who do not want to take delivery of physical oil must find other parties to take the oil, and long chains of speculators formed between producers and refiners for every cargo of oil traded. Integrated oil producers also blurred the lines between commercial and speculative activity, as they could re-direct physical oil cargoes, and choose which forward contracts to deliver and which contracts to pass on to other speculators or producers.

Front Month Brent forward contracts prices came to be used as reference prices for spot transactions, but became vulnerable to speculative squeezes. The development of a Dated Brent and Forward Month Brent Contracts-for-Difference market increased this vulnerability, and market participants gradually switched to using Dated Brent as the spot transaction reference price by 1988.

==Brent crude oil contract-for-difference (CFD)==
Brent crude oil contract-for-difference (CFD) is a weekly spread or swap between the Dated Brent assessed price and the Second Month (or M2) Brent crude oil forward contract. They trade over a five-day work week in volumes of 100 or 100,000 lots and the most recent CFD rolls to the next-week CFD on Thursday. The CFD market developed in 1988 in response to basis risk between the Brent futures/forward contract prices and the spot/dated Brent prices.

==Dated Brent assessed prices and the Brent spot market==
In contrast to open forward contracts, Brent crude oil &quot;dated&quot; contracts – known as dated Brent contracts – specify the delivery date of crude in the current month in the spot market. Spot market transactions are generally not public, so market participants usually analyzed Dated Brent prices using assessments from Price Reporting Agencies (PRAs), who collect private transactions data and aggregate them. The important PRAs for the Brent Complex are Platts, Argus, and ICIS. Platts dominates the assessed Dated Brent price, Argus publishes a BFOET assessed crude price called Argus North Sea Dated crude price, and ICIS provides the final settlement data to the ICE Brent Index (which ultimately settles ICE Brent futures) since 2015.

However, in the early 1990s, Brent and BFOET crude spot markets started to price transactions using assessed Dated Brent prices as benchmark prices, which created a feedback loop that diluted fundamental supply and demand information contained in the assessed Dated Brent price, and created incentives for speculative squeezes.

Platts and other PRAs got around the problem by quoting both a dated Brent assessed on outright spot market transactions, and a &quot;North Sea Date Brent Strip&quot; assessed using a Front Month Brent forward price curve created out of adding the Brent Front Month contract price and relevant weekly Brent contracts-for-difference (CFD) prices. These dated Brent prices became less vulnerable to speculative squeezes, since market actors who try to corner the spot market will find that other market participants can sell on the front month forward market or on prices referenced to a front month forward market price, and market actors who try to monopolize the front month forward market will find that they would lose what they earned in the forward market in the spot market, as price effect they created in the front month contract will pass on to the dated Brent prices.

Platt&#x27;s compile their assessment prices during price assessment &#x27;windows&#x27;, or specific times of market trading, usually close to the end of trading for a particular day. Trading in these windows are dominated by group of major market participants, as listed in the table below.

==Brent oilfield crude oil blend==
Originally Brent Crude was produced from the Brent Oilfield. The name &quot;Brent&quot; comes from the naming policy of Shell UK Exploration and Production, operating on behalf of ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, which originally named all of its fields after birds (in this case the brent goose). But it is also a backronym or mnemonic for the formation layers of the oil field: Broom, Rannoch, Etive, Ness and Tarbert.

Petroleum production from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East flowing West tends to be priced relative to this oil, i.e. it forms a benchmark. The other well-known classifications (also called references or benchmarks) are the OPEC Reference Basket, Dubai Crude, Oman Crude, Shanghai Crude, Urals oil and West Texas Intermediate (WTI).

===Characteristics===

Brent blend is a light crude oil (LCO), though not as light as West Texas Intermediate (WTI). It contains approximately 0.37% of sulphur, classifying it as sweet crude, yet not as sweet as WTI. Brent is suitable for production of petrol and middle distillates. It is typically refined in Northwest Europe.

Brent Crude has a density of approximately , being equivalent to a specific gravity of 0.835 or an API gravity of 38.06.

==Brent Index==
The Brent Index is the cash settlement price for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Brent Future based on ICE Futures Brent index at expiry.

<text>Harry Burleigh (born Henry Thacker Burleigh, December 2, 1866 – September 12, 1949) was an American classical composer, arranger, and professional singer known for his baritone voice. The first black composer who was instrumental in developing characteristically American music, Burleigh made black music available to classically trained artists both by introducing them to spirituals and by arranging spirituals in a more classical form.
Burleigh also introduced Antonín Dvořák to Black American music, which influenced some of Dvořák&#x27;s most famous compositions and led him to say that Black music would be the basis of an American classical music.

== Early and family life ==

Henry &quot;Harry&quot; Thacker Burleigh was born in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1866 to Elizabeth Burleigh and Henry Thacker Burleigh Sr. Harry&#x27;s grandfather, Hamilton Waters, was granted manumission from slavery in Somerset County, Maryland, after paying $55 ($50 for him and $5 for his mother) in 1832 and receiving a certificate of freedom in 1835. They traveled to Ithaca, New York, where two of Waters&#x27;s half-brothers lived. After his mother died, Waters married Lucinda Duncanson. Their first child, Elizabeth Lovey Waters (who would be Burleigh&#x27;s mother) was born in Lansing, New York, in 1838. Later that year the family moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, where they lived until the 1920s. Elizabeth, who was graduated from Avery College in Pittsburgh in 1855, was denied a teaching position in the Erie Public Schools, but taught at the Colored School for many years.

Burleigh&#x27;s father, Henry Thacker Burleigh Sr., a naval veteran in the Civil War, was the first black juror in Erie County in 1871. After his death in 1873, Elizabeth remarried in 1875. Her second husband, John Elmendorf, was also a veteran of the Union Navy.

Burleigh&#x27;s grandfather, who was known for his &quot;exceptionally melodious voice&quot;, taught young Burleigh and his brother Reginald traditional spirituals and slave songs.

Burleigh helped support his family by various odd jobs: lighting gas streetlamps, selling newspapers and working as a printer&#x27;s devil, as a coachman, and as a steward on Lake Erie steamboats. He also studied to be an accountant at the Clark&#x27;s Business College while he was in high school. His mother occasionally worked as a maid for the daughter of Burleigh Sr.&#x27;s employer when she held musicales (musical gatherings) in her home. Burleigh served as a doorman when various famous musicians performed at those musicales, including Venezuelan pianist Teresa Carreño and Italian tenor Italo Campanini.

Burleigh studied voice with George F. Brierly. During and after his high school years Burleigh became known as one of Erie&#x27;s most accomplished classical singers. Several Erie churches and the Jewish synagogue hired him as a soloist, and he also sang as soloist at many community and civic events.

== Studies at the National Conservatory ==

Burleigh was accepted, with a scholarship, to the prestigious National Conservatory of Music in New York at the age of 26. He obtained the scholarship with the help of Frances MacDowell, the mother of composer Edward MacDowell, and he would eventually play double bass in the Conservatory&#x27;s orchestra. Although at first the Conservatory denied Burleigh the tuition scholarship he needed to be able to attend, citing him falling just below their audition standards, Mrs. MacDowell (the registrar) insisted that he be allowed to try his entrance exam again. Days later, he received a scholarship.

=== Relation with Dvořák ===
To help support himself during his studies, Burleigh worked for Mrs. MacDowell as a handyman, cleaning and working on anything she needed. Reputedly, Burleigh, who later became known worldwide for his excellent baritone voice, sang spirituals while cleaning the Conservatory&#x27;s halls, which drew the attention of the conservatory&#x27;s director, Czech composer Antonín Dvořák, who asked Burleigh to sing for him. Burleigh said: &quot;I sang our Negro songs for him very often, and before he wrote his own themes, he filled himself with the spirit of the old Spirituals.&quot; Dvořák said: &quot;In the negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.&quot;

From what he called &quot;Negro melodies&quot; and Native American music, Dvořák took up the Pentatonic scale, which appears in some places in his Symphony &quot;From the New World&quot; and at the beginning of each movement of the &quot;American&quot; String Quartet. In the Symphony, a flute theme resembles the spiritual &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot; that may well be among those Burleigh sang to Dvořák.





In 1922, another student of Dvořák, William Arms Fisher, wrote the spiritual-like song &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; based on an English horn melody from the second movement (Largo) of the Symphony. No evidence seems to exist that the song existed before 1922, or the melody before the Symphony (1893), although both are disputed. In 1893 Burleigh assisted Dvořák in copying out instrumental parts for the symphony.

The following year, Burleigh sang in Dvořák&#x27;s arrangement of Pennsylvania native Stephen C. Foster&#x27;s classic &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. He graduated in 1896, and later served on the conservatory&#x27;s faculty.

== Singing career ==
Burleigh began his singing career as the baritone in his family&#x27;s quartet. By the time Burleigh left Erie in January 1892, he was singing with the city&#x27;s best vocalists at civic events and church gatherings. At the end of the summer of 1892, Burleigh gave a performance in the Adirondacks, at North Hudson, New York, as the featured soloist in &quot;the summer school for Christian workers&quot;. Nine months after arriving in New York City, Burleigh appeared in two Grand Encampment Concerts at the Metropolitan Church in Washington, D.C., as &quot;the celebrated Western baritone.&quot;

In 1894, he became a soloist for St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church in New York City. Some parishioners opposed hiring Burleigh at the all-white church, because of his race, at a time when other white New York Episcopal churches were forbidding black people to worship. J. P. Morgan, a member of St. George&#x27;s at that time, cast the deciding vote to hire Burleigh. In spite of the initial problems obtaining the appointment, Burleigh became close to many members during his long tenure as a soloist at the church. In 1946, he retired from this position after 52 years. He was instrumental in starting its tradition of an annual Spirituals service every May (1924–55). His singing &quot;The Palms&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Faure was a Palm Sunday tradition for 50 years, and New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia arranged a radio broadcast from his office in 1944. In the late 1890s, Burleigh gained a reputation as a concert soloist, singing art songs and opera selections, as well as African-American folk songs. He sang before King Edward VII in London in 1908, among other prestigious European concerts. From 1900 to 1925, Burleigh was also a member of the synagogue choir at the Temple Emanu-El in New York, the only African-American to sing there. He also frequently worked with Walter F. Craig and his orchestra.

Burleigh disdained recording and it was long (mistakenly) believed that no recording existed of his voice. He recorded once in 1919, for a small label run by his friend George Broome, and again in 1944 for St. George&#x27;s Church. The 1919 recording exists, but the latter recordings have never been found.

== Arrangements and compositions ==
In the late 1890s, Burleigh also began to publish his own arrangements of art songs. About 1898, he began to compose his own songs, and by the late 1910s, Burleigh was one of America&#x27;s best-known composers of art songs. Beginning around 1910, Burleigh also worked editing music for G. Ricordi, an Italian music publisher with offices in New York.

Burleigh published several versions of the Negro spiritual &quot;Deep River&quot; in 1916 and 1917, and quickly became known for his arrangements of spirituals for voice and piano. One of his arrangements in Common Metre is the hymn tune &quot;McKee&quot;, used with John Oxenham&#x27;s hymn &quot;In Christ There Is No East or West&quot;. His arrangements helped to make spirituals a popular genre for concert singers, and within a few years, many notable singers performed Burleigh&#x27;s arrangements.

Burleigh&#x27;s art song arrangements of spirituals and sentimental songs were so popular during the late 1910s and 1920s, that almost no vocal recitalist gave a concert in a major city without occasionally singing them. John McCormack sang several of Burleigh&#x27;s songs in concert, including &quot;Little Mother of Mine&quot; (1917), &quot;Dear Old Pal of Mine&quot; (1918), &quot;Under a Blazing Star&quot; (1918), and &quot;In the Great Somewhere&quot; (1919). The popularity of Burleigh&#x27;s settings contributed to an explosion of popularity for the genre during the 1920s. He set some poems by Walt Whitman to music and also published music for piano and violin.

Estimates of Burleigh&#x27;s original musical output range from 200 to 300 songs. In 1914, he was a founding member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP), and received a seat on its board of directors in 1941.

== Death and legacy ==
Through the 1920s and 1930s, Burleigh continued to promote especially the spirituals through publications, lectures, and arrangements. His lifelong advocacy for the spiritual eclipsed his singing career, as well as his arrangements of art songs. He retired in 1946 because of ill health, and his son moved him from Long Island to a retirement home in Stamford, Connecticut, where he died, aged 82, from heart failure on September 12, 1949. More than 2,000 people attended his funeral at St. George&#x27;s Church. Pallbearers included Hall Johnson, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, William C. Handy, and Cameron White. His remains were returned for burial in Erie, Pennsylvania.

With the success of Roland Hayes, Marian Anderson, and Paul Robeson, among others, many of whom he had coached, Burleigh&#x27;s seminal role in establishing African-American soloists on America&#x27;s recital stages seemed eclipsed. His many popular art songs from the early twentieth century have often been out of print since the composer&#x27;s death. Nevertheless, he remains one of America&#x27;s most important composers from the early twentieth century.

In 1917, Burleigh received the Spingarn Medal, which the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) awards annually for outstanding achievement by an African American. He also received honorary degrees from Howard University and Atlanta University.

In 1928, the oldest HBCU in the US, Cheyney State Teachers College (now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania) built a men&#x27;s dormitory, Harry T. Burleigh Hall. It has been renovated and now contains offices.

&quot;Nobody Knows: Songs of Harry T. Burleigh&quot;, an album of his works by Karen Parks (co-produced by Parks and Grammy-winning producer David Macias), debuted at No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Traditional Classical Album Chart upon its 2008 release.

Works he edited or transcribed continue in the 1982 Hymnal of the Episcopal Church (United States), including No. 529 (&quot;In Christ there is no East or West&quot;).

Other arrangements are included in the alternative hymnals, including &quot;Lift Every Voice and Sing&quot;.

In 2019, a committee was formed by Michelle Deal Winfield, State Committeewoman, 74th Assembly District to petition Community Board Six Manhattan for a street co-naming: Harry T. Burleigh Place. The NYC Council Member Carlina Rivera submitted the application and it was approved. The ceremony was held at South East corner of East Sixteenth Street and Third Avenue in Manhattan on September 12, 2021. In October 2021, U.S. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney entered the celebration of Henry Thacker &quot;Harry&quot; Burleigh into the Congressional Record Extension Remarks: Volume 167, Number 179.

<doc id="1150534" wikidata="Q372096" url="?curid=1150534" title="The Statesman (India)">
<text>The Statesman is an Indian English-language broadsheet daily newspaper founded in 1818 and published simultaneously in Kolkata, New Delhi, Siliguri and Bhubaneswar. It incorporates and is directly descended from The Friend of India. It is owned by The Statesman Ltd and headquartered at Statesman House, Chowringhee Square, Kolkata, with its national editorial office at Statesman House, Connaught Place, New Delhi. It is a member of the Asia News Network.

&quot;The Statesman&quot; has an average weekday circulation of approximately 234,000, and the &quot;Sunday Statesman&quot; has a circulation of 250,000. This ranks it as one of the leading English newspapers in West Bengal, India.

==History==
&quot;The Statesman&quot; is a direct descendant of two newspapers, the Bombay (now Mumbai) based &quot;Indian Statesman&quot; and &quot;The Friend of India&quot; published in Calcutta (now Kolkata). &quot;Indian Statesman&quot; was started by Robert Knight, who was previously the principal founder and editor of &quot;The Times of India&quot;. Knight merged the two papers to &quot;Indian Statesman and New Friend of India&quot; on 15 January 1875. The paper later adopted the current name. It absorbed its erstwhile rival &quot;The Englishman&quot; in 1927. The &quot;Statesman&quot; was managed by a British corporate group until it transferred ownership to a consortium of companies with N A Palkhivala as Chairman in the mid-1960s. The first editor assigned under this new ownership was Pran Chopra.

In 1978, then editor S Nihal Singh was awarded the prestigious International Editor of the Year Award given by &quot;World Press Review&quot;, New York, for opposing the Emergency (1975-77). 

==Editorial style==

&quot;The Statesman&quot; is characterized by its terse reporting style. It holds a liberal position. It opposed the shifting of India&#x27;s capital from Calcutta to New Delhi in 1911, stating that &quot;[t]he British have gone to the city of graveyards to be buried there&quot;. It also strenuously opposed Indira Gandhi&#x27;s Emergency in 1975–77. Under the editor Ian Stephens (who was editor from 1942 to 1951), the newspaper published highly disturbing images, on 22 and 29 August 1943, of the effects of the Bengal famine of 1943, despite the British colonial government&#x27;s attempts at censorship. The images played a major role in changing world opinion on imperialism.

&quot;The Statesman Award for Rural Reporting&quot; is presented to outstanding journalists every year, irrespective of affiliation, to further the social uplifting of indigents from India. The awards are presented on 16 September every year, the death anniversary of Justice Sudhi Ranjan Das, former Chief Justice of India&#x27;s Supreme Court and chairman of The Statesman during the tumultuous Emergency years.

Once the most widely read English dailies in West Bengal, &quot;The Statesman&quot; has now lost some ground to The Telegraph and &quot;The Times of India&quot; in the state. But it is widely regarded as the paper to read for serious news reportage, incisive analytical articles and usage of standard English language.

&quot;The Statesman&quot; is a founding member of the Asia News Network, a grouping of 22 Asian newspapers that have joined hands for a daily news exchange. This allows &quot;The Statesman&quot; to offer exhaustive coverage of all Asian regions.

==Supplements==

&quot;The Statesman&quot; carries a Thursday feature supplement called &quot;Section 2&quot; which is published from New Delhi. The four-page supplement provides in-depth analysis on art, dance, literature, drama, fashion, lifestyle and entertainment. In Kolkata, the supplement &quot;Voices&quot; focuses on schools and schoolchildren. It started in 1995, providing the opportunity for school children to showcase their writing skills with research articles, poems and short news clips. Among other activities every year, &quot;Voices&quot; hosts a 2-day long festival called &quot;Vibes&quot; in Calcutta, which showcases inter-school competitions in different fields, as well as shows by musicians and bands.

The Sunday supplement, &quot;8th Day&quot;, is the major literary section of the paper, consisting of reader-contributed short stories and poems while the other Sunday supplement, &quot;Evolve&quot;, mainly deals with the cultural scene in India. &quot;Marquee&quot;, published every Saturday, covers the film and entertainment scene. Supplement of Dainik Statesman - every Saturday publishes Binodan where the news of art, culture, music, entertainment, food, fashion, lifestyle related articles are available. Every Sunday publishes Bichitra where the Sunday special articles, short stories, travel, children special issues are available.

==Key personnel==
R P Gupta is Chairman and Ravindra Kumar is Editor of The Statesman. Arya Rudra is Managing Editor and Vineet Gupta is Printer and Publisher of The Statesman.

Sister Edition
&quot;Dainik Statesman&quot;, a daily Bengali newspaper, was launched in June 2004 and is published simultaneously in Kolkata and Siliguri.

==Editorial incident==

In February 2009, &quot;The Statesman&quot; editor Ravindra Kumar was arrested on the charges of &quot;hurting the religious feelings&quot; of Muslims. BBC reported that Muslims were upset with &quot;The Statesman&quot; for reproducing Johann Hari&#x27;s article &quot;Why should I respect these oppressive religions?&quot; from the UK&#x27;s &quot;The Independent&quot; daily in its February edition.

==Rally sponsorship==

The Statesman Vintage &amp; Classic Car Rally has been held annually since 1964.

<doc id="1150541" wikidata="Q1622678" url="?curid=1150541" title="Testicular atrophy">
<text>Testicular atrophy is a medical condition in which one or both testicles (or &quot;testes&quot;) diminish in size and may be accompanied by reduced testicular function. Testicular atrophy is not related to the temporary shrinkage of the surrounding scrotum, which might occur in response to cold temperature.

As the testicles are involved in testosterone and sperm production, the signs and symptoms of testicular atrophy overlap with those related to infertility or low testosterone levels. In a prepubescent person with testicular atrophy, there may be underdevelopment of secondary sex characteristics (e.g. lack of penis growth). In sexually developed individuals, testicular atrophy may be accompanied with lower sex drive and increased breast tissue. Additional signs and symptoms vary and can depend on the specific cause of the testicle shrinkage. Some causes include age, alcohol use, anabolic steroid use, testosterone replacement therapy, direct damage to the testicles, and infection.

Diagnosis of testicular atrophy includes physical examination of the testicles as well as imaging to measure testicular volume. A testosterone blood level is also taken to assess function of the testicles. Additional tests may be ordered depending on the suspected cause(s) of the shrinkage. Treatment and potential reversibility of testicular atrophy are also dependent on the cause.

== Signs and symptoms ==
There are different signs and symptoms associated with testicular atrophy depending on the person&#x27;s age. Symptoms before puberty are centered more around the stunting of sexual characteristics associated with hormonal changes, while symptoms after puberty include a wider range of factors. Other signs and symptoms may stem from underlying conditions which cause testicular atrophy. The most perceptible sign of testicular atrophy is shrinkage of the testicle(s).

Signs and symptoms before puberty include:
* lack of development of pubic hair
* lack of development of facial hair
* lack of penis growth
* lower testosterone
Testosterone is a hormone that is found primarily in a portion of the male reproductive system called the testes and is normally measured in nanograms per deciliter. Testosterone is in charge of the growth and production of many sexual attributes in males, including facial hair, pubic hair, penis size, vocal and muscle mass changes, regulation of sex drive, and sperm production. Normal testosterone levels in males who have not yet hit puberty are less than 20 nanograms per deciliter. Low testosterone can be defined as hypogonadism in people with testes. Hypogonadism in people with testes is established as the hormonal inhibition of testosterone that can either be inherited or acquired at a later stage in life. Under the circumstances of pre-pubescent hypogonadism, many sexual developmental characteristics may be altered. Testosterone affects hair growth by regulating the follicle itself, which in turn affects the specific growth phases of the hair follicle. As a person with testes hits puberty, androgen, a steroid sex hormone, is produced at an increased rate, which creates terminal hair follicles. Terminal hair follicles create thicker and more pigmented hair which is also regulated by testosterone production. Testosterone also impacts pre-pubescent penis size by providing penile tissue with girth and density. The drop in testosterone values is mainly due to significant impairment of Leydig cells brought upon by hypogonadism. Leydig cells are located in the testes and serve to create testosterone and androgen. Once they are damaged, the production of testosterone is stunted.

Signs and symptoms after puberty include:
* reduced sex drive
* tender testicles
* trouble conceiving
* reduction of pubic or facial hair
* decreased muscle mass
* lower testosterone
Typical testosterone levels of people with testes after puberty range from 300 to 1,200 nanograms per deciliter. Low testosterone values in males post-puberty would be considered any value under 300 nanograms per deciliter. Decreased testosterone values caused by testicular atrophy can lead to and explain many of the signs and symptoms listed above, including a reduced sex drive, infertility, soft testicles, reduction of hair, and lower muscle mass throughout the body. Testosterone plays an important role in physiologically stimulating sex drive in people with testes. If testosterone levels drop below normal values, libido (sexual drive) is reduced, which can lead to the development of erectile dysfunction (a condition in which the penis is not able to get or stay erect). This can indirectly affect fertility as well. In addition, testosterone is important in muscle mass formation. It increases the amount of lean muscle mass in the body. Testosterone encourages metabolic activity in the body, which in turn stimulates protein synthesis. Protein synthesis is highly important for the development and enlargement of muscle. Therefore, a lack of testosterone would alter this metabolic process, leading to a decrease in muscle mass.

Signs and symptoms of testicular atrophy that are due to a secondary medical condition include:
* inflammation
* fever
* sensitivity or pain of the testicle(s)
* nausea
Secondary medical conditions that may cause the signs and symptoms listed above include testicular cancer, chronic alcohol use, sexually transmitted infections, COVID-19, orchitis, varicoceles, or torsion of the testes.

== Causes ==
=== Age ===
Shrinkage of the testicles is common with advanced age, as overall reproductive function declines.

=== Alcohol use ===
High alcohol usage lowers testosterone levels by direct damage to the Leydig cells (which produce testosterone) and by affecting hormones involved in signaling to the Leydig cells to produce testosterone. As a result, testicular atrophy is a common feature among individuals with high alcohol use. Testicular malformations and low testosterone levels is also commonly found in people with alcoholic cirrhosis as the negative effect of alcohol use is worsened by the liver damage itself. Excessive alcohol intake can cause inflammation and the degradation of cells in the liver, which can then cause testicular abnormalities (including testicular atrophy).

=== Anabolic steroid use and hormone therapy ===
Anabolic steroid use and testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) have been found to cause testicular atrophy through similar mechanisms. Anabolic steroids and TRT are both used (either by prescription or illicitly) to mimic the effects of testosterone produced by the body, such as building muscle and maintaining sex drive. However, they also inhibit the body&#x27;s own production of sperm and testosterone, which can lead to shrinkage of the testicles.

Testicular atrophy is also a side effect of estrogen therapy.

=== COVID-19 ===
COVID-19 can lead to reduced testosterone production and testicular abnormalities due to changes in the secretion of gonadotropins, which are hormones involved in regulating testosterone production. These hormonal effects may be due to inflammation and oxidative stress caused by COVID-19. This might inform whether healthcare providers decide to monitor those who have survived COVID-19 for hormonal changes and potential fertility issues.

=== Orchitis ===
Orchitis, or inflammation of the testicles due to a bacterial or viral infection, can lead to testicular atrophy. Mumps has historically been significantly associated with orchitis and testicular atrophy, but has become rare in countries that have high mumps vaccination rates.

=== Varicoceles and testicular torsion ===
Varicoceles and testicular torsion are conditions in which direct damage to the testicles can potentially lead to testicular atrophy. Varicoceles are pooling of blood in the veins that deliver blood away from the testicles and are relatively common, occurring in approximately 15% of adolescent and adults with testicles. Currently, it is not clearly established how often varicoceles actually become a direct cause of issues related to fertility. Testicular torsion is the twisting of the testicle within the scrotum and can rapidly result in damage due to interruption in blood flow to the affected testicle. Unlike varicoceles, testicular torsion is considered a medical emergency.

=== Other health conditions ===
There is a possible correlation of cystic fibrosis and its impact to bilateral testicular atrophy. Cystic fibrosis is a disease which causes mucus buildup in various organs. Evidence has shown that cystic fibrosis affects multiple systems in the human body, including the reproductive system. Around 97-98% of people with cystic fibrosis who have testicles are infertile due to a missing vas deferens, the tube in the male reproductive system that carries sperm out of the testes. Additionally, cystic fibrosis can result in the atrophy of male reproductive organs by causing dehydrated secretions. In recent times a connection to H63D syndrome was found.

== Diagnosis ==
=== Physical examination ===
A healthcare provider may initially assess size and shape as well as firmness and texture of the testicles.

=== Ultrasonography ===

Ultrasonography is used to detect testicular volume. Testicular volume measured to be less than 12 mL is a sign of testicular atrophy. In addition, testicular atrophy can be recognized as greater than 50% loss of testicular volume or a post-operative testicle with less than 25% of the volume of the opposite testicle. Online calculators have been developed to estimate testicular volume based on sonographic measurements.

=== Lab tests ===
Assessment of testicular function is also dependent on lab tests. Low testosterone is a potential cause of testicular atrophy, and laboratory values of blood samples can confirm low free or bioavailable testosterone.

Due to the high levels of oxidative stress in the semen, there may also be higher levels of sperm DNA fragmentation for people with varicoceles. In some cases, people with testicular damage who do not undergo repair of the varicoceles will have testicular atrophy.

== Treatment ==

=== Medication ===
Treatment with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) alone or in addition to self-administered injections of hCG aim to correct hormonal imbalances caused by anabolic steroid use and can help prevent or reverse testicular atrophy for some people.

=== Surgery ===
People who have testicular atrophy due to testicular torsion are immediately referred to surgery regardless of the ultrasound findings, since delays rapidly decrease the rate of recovery. The consequences of not treating will result in decreased fertility and may result in the need of an orchiectomy, a surgical procedure to remove one or both testicles. While immediate treatment can reduce the recovery time for the testes, there is still a chance of the testes to undergo atrophy a second time. Performance of an orchiectomy on individuals diagnosed with testicular atrophy has a possible negative impact on their testosterone levels in the long term. As a result, these individuals are typically monitored for the reoccurrence of testicular atrophy and low testosterone levels.

=== Lifestyle modifications ===
In addition to drug therapies and surgical interventions to treat testicular atrophy, lifestyle modifications might also be recommended by healthcare providers. Most lifestyle modifications target factors that contribute to infertility in men. Limiting or abstaining from alcohol intake, smoking, and drugs such as anabolic steroids, cannabis, or opioids can help with infertility. Additionally, diet modifications might be encouraged to reach a more balanced diet, such as a higher intake of fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and healthier oils, such as olive oil and canola oil. Reducing intake of processed meats, and trans fats can also lead to improved fertility outcomes. Poor diet can otherwise lead to oxidative stress, which causes sperm damage, leading to lower testicular volume and lower sperm quality. Ensuring enough vitamin and mineral intake might also be recommended, since omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidant vitamins, zinc, and selenium might help reduce the damage by oxidative stress and reduce inflammation. Zinc intake can be boosted with meats and nuts, and selenium intake can be boosted with whole grains.

<text>Cedros is a Portuguese civil parish in the municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores, on the island of Flores in the Azores. The population in 2021 was 112, in an area of approximately .

==History==
Due to the difficulties associated with the region, its cliffs and climate in particular, settlement of this area developed during the late 15th century. From a small circle of three to four families, Cedros grew to about thirty neighbors by about 1715, according to Father António Cordeiro. The same author referred to the existence of the hamlet of Ponta Ruiva with a few residents and a small port, which were integrated into the parish of São Pedro (in Ponta Delgada, Santa Cruz das Flores) at the time.

Although Cedros was considered a &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the region, it had an important place in the economy of the island for the abundance of the Azorean cedar (&quot;cedros-do-mato&quot;) because its lumber was used in the construction of ships for fishing, for the early homes and the implements used in agriculture. The fibers of the cedars were usually dried in the sun, and used to produce twine or ropes.

Ilhéu Furado and the anchorage of Alagoa was, for many decades, the natural access to the island of Flores when winds from the southeast were strong. Alagoa was the heart of Cedros, due to its access to the sea, and connection to the interior pasturelands and orchards.

The distance between Cedros and Ponta Ruivo from their respective parishes, the mountainous cliffs and valleys and climate, made the residents petition the Bishop of Angra, at the time Friar Clement Vieira, to de-annex their localities from their respective parishes. By doing so, the residents would constitute their own parish and construct a church, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Pilar, at their own cost. The Captain-major at the time, D. Martinho de Mascarenhas (sixth Count of Santa Cruz) also supported the claims of the citizens, and offered to build a chapel and to donate a statue of Senhora do Pilar. After bishop António Álvares Pereira de Sousa visited the community in 1690, and after having agreed to elevate the community to parish he died, and the decision was delayed. Finally, Cedros, Ponta Ruiva and possibly Alagoa, were elevated to parish on July 9, 1693, a community of 176 inhabitants in 50 homes. Father Domingos Furtado de Mendonça was its first parish priest, he had an annual pay of about 24$000 réis, two parts in wheat and one in cash, of which he paid a portion to the Count of Sant Cruz. Faithful to their promise the residents constructed a new church, completed in 1693, and which the Count complied in donating the new chapel, completed in 1719. Inscriptions on two rocks found during demolition on the church in September 1945 confirm these facts, as well as a shield of D. Martinho de Mascarenhas and cross etched with 1693 and 1719, respectively. The church was reconstructed in 1822, but by 1868 a report by the Civil Governor of the District of Horta, António José Vieira Santa Rita, considered the building to be in a bad state of conservation.

Until the 20th century it was common for many Cedrenses, much like most poor in the Azores, to travel shoeless, and brought their shoes, ties and some clothing in a satchel when traveling to the &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; community of Santa Cruz. Ironically, the community had a distinction for being the population with the lowest level of illiteracy on the island of Flores: a fact that was attributed to professor Fraga (their local school teacher), who died in 1929.

After the demolition of the insecure old church in September 1945, the cornerstone of the new church was planted on January 22, 1950, thanks to the efforts of its parish priest, Father José Maria Álvares, receiving its consecration on June 18, 1953.

Until 1966, when the French military base was constructed, there was no formal road connecting Cedros with Ponta Delgada. At that time, Cedros became the terminus of the road network from the south (ending at Ponta Ruiva), and Ponta Delgada was only accessible by trail or by sea (as the weather permitted).

==Geography==

===Physical geography===
The parish is delimited by the deep river-valley of Alagoa in the south, and Ribeira dos Cedros to the north (which separates Cedros from the parish of Ponta Delgada). Much like the parish of the same name on Faial, the settlement was given its name for the abundance of cedar trees (&quot;cedros-do-mato&quot;, &quot;Juniperus brevifolia&quot;), used by the colonists for building during settlement in the 16th century. In fact, the availability of this wood allowed the growth of the community, which was located in a relatively isolated promontory along the coast. Gaspar Frutuoso, noted: &quot;...there is a high cliff, projecting into the ocean, dressed in trees of cedar, laurel and white wood, it&#x27;s [an area] populated by many of the Captain&#x27;s wild goats [and whom]...living above are three or four neighbors...this is the area we call Cedros, for there are many there&quot;.

Two sheltered bays also guard the coast of Cedros: along the coast of the valley of Alagoa (where there are several islets), and in front of Ponta Ruiva, where a small port was located. The small rocky islets (of which Fragata, Garajau, Carneiros and the islet of Álvaro Rodrigues) are all rocky, shallow features; apart from the islet of Álvaro Rodrigues, which was cultivated until about the middle of the 20th century, the islets are uninhabitable and lack sources of water.

===Ecoregions/Protected areas===
* Park of Alagoa () - located near an uninhabited settlement, it is a natural extension of the Ribeira da Alagoa, the ravine and valley that divides the coast;
* Nature Reserve of Alagoa Bay Islets and Baixa do Moinho (), a site of communitarian interest, that includes an area of around the islets of Alagoa, for the protection of marine flora and fauna, and especially for population of roseate and common terns. It is part of the larger &quot;Sítio de Importância Comunitária (SIC) Costa Nordeste&quot; (&quot;Northern Coastal Site of Communitarian Interest&quot;) management plan, that includes an area with specific restrictions on what uses (including fishing and tourism) and environmental restrictions;
* There are several lookouts/belvederes within the limits of Cedros that add to scenic nature of the community: &quot;Miradouro dos Caimbros&quot;, &quot;Miradouro do Poço Comprido&quot;, &quot;Miradouro da Rocha da Gata&quot; and the &quot;Miradouro da Tapada Nova&quot;.

===Human geography===
The development of this area is unique in the Azores (owing to the higher altitudes and the prominence of strong winds) resulting in very isolated communities, that now have become linked by the roadways. Consequently, the parish has developed into three localities:

* Cedros, the center of the parish, location of the parochial church, its small school (now closed as children are bused to the vila of Ponta Delgada);
* Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet situated five kilometers northeast of Cedros on a high promontory by the sea;
* Alagoa, a site along the deep valley of &quot;Ribeira da Alagoa&quot;, about south of Cedros, with few permanent residents, that was once the location of a small fort used for the defense of the coast from attacks by pirates or privateers.

==Economy==
The parish maintains its traditional rural character; the majority of its inhabitants are involved in agriculture, principally the raising of cattle, although some carpentry and commercial activities occur in this zone. Milling was also important, resulting in the construction of several mills along the Ribeira das Barrosas and Ribeira da Alagoa.

Also, due to a micro-climate in the area of Alagoa, the parish enjoyed a period of fruit cultivation (something rare to the rest of the island), where oblong &quot;apples&quot; (similar to pears in shape) were grown. For many decades, the small port of Alagoa was the point of embarkation for orange exports from the valley; an example of success in a peripheral economy, orange exports were sent directly to England, by English and Portuguese ships.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Alagoa, the uninhabited community, but not in a state of ruins, notable for several architectural important buildings used during the early history of the community, including mills and a main bridge constructed in the 15th century;
* Decorated Stone &quot;Rua da Igreja&quot; ();
* Haylofts of Fajã dos Cedros ();
* Haylofts of &quot;Rua da Esperança&quot; ();
* Kiln of Cedros ();
* Kiln of Fajã dos Cedros ()
* Ponta Ruiva, a small hamlet, architecturally similar to homes built in Vila do Corvo;
* Residence &quot;Rua Manuel Maria de Freitas&quot; ()
* Watermills of Ribeira dos Moinhos ()

===Military===
* Artillery Battery of Alagoa (), located in a dominant position overlooking the Bay of Alagoa, it was constructed during a period of Cedros&#x27; history when raids by pirates were frequent.

===Religious===
* Church of Nossa Senhora do Pilar ()
* Império of the Divine Holy Spirit de Cima (), constructed in 1856, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts
* Império of the Divine Holy Spirit de Baixo (), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts
* * Império of the Divine Holy Spirit of Ponta Ruiva (), constructed in 1861, a building used in traditional Holy Spirit feasts

==Culture==

===Festivities===
The parish realizes its principal festival in honor of Nossa Senhora do Pilar and São Roque on the third Sunday of August. It also follows the tradition of the festivals of the Holy Spirit which are common on the islands of the Azores, here celebrated on the Sunday of Pentecosts.

===Tradition===
Faithful to tradition, there is still a handicraft industry reproducing in miniature implements used in the agriculture, for sale to tourists.

<text>The Port of Garston, also known as Garston Docks is an enclosed tidal dock system on the River Mersey at Garston, approximately from Liverpool City centre Liverpool, England. It is operated by Associated British Ports who are the Harbour Authority. Peel Ports as Competent Harbour Authority for the River Mersey provide Pilotage for any non exempt vessels calling at the Port. 

==History==
Garston Dock was originally set up by the St. Helens and Runcorn Gap Railway Company in June 1853. It contains Old Dock, North Dock and Stalbridge Dock.

By 1936 the 3 docks had of water, of sidings, of storage and dealt with about two million tons of goods a year.

==Present day==

The present site covers 65 acres. Approximately 330kt of imported freight is handled per annum. Decorative stone, minerals, agribulks are imported. Sea dredged aggregate (sand), around 65% of total throughput, is primary commodity handled. Cement is imported via a Terminal Operator. Cement Clinker is exported. Nordic fertliser, organic wheat, steel products, RDF, palletised/bulk chemicals lightweight aggregate and some de_icing salt imports along with scrap exports have been switched to other port facilities locally and elsewhere within UK in recent years. Between 2012 &amp; 2017, ABP invested several million pounds in essential investment, replacing lock gates, additional storage facilities and the purchase of new crane capacity. Owing to a steady decline in trade. The crane purchased was transferred to ABP Newport June 2022. Replacement reduced capacity cranage has been procured resulting in Garston no longer providing any inhouse heavy lift capacity for port users. Land ABP deemed non essential to port operations has been sold for a housing development which now borders a large section of the port estate.

<text>The Polygalaceae or the milkwort family are made up of flowering plants in the order Fabales. They have a near-cosmopolitan range, with about 27 genera and &quot;ca&quot;. 900 known species of herbs, shrubs and trees. Over half of the species are in one genus, &quot;Polygala&quot;, the milkworts.

The family was first described in 1809 by Johann Hoffmansegg and Johann Link. In 1896, Robert Chodat split it into 3 tribes. A fourth tribe was split off from the tribe Polygaleae in 1992. Under the Cronquist classification system, Polygalaceae were treated in a separate order of their own, Polygalales. Currently, according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, the family belongs in Fabales.

==Description==
&quot;Polygalaceae&quot; are annual or perennial herbs, shrubs, trees or lianas. Its zygomorphic, hermaphrodite, bisexual flowers have 3-5 petals and 5 sepals. Its leaves are usually alternate, but may be opposite, fascicled, or verticillate. Each flower usually contains 8 stamens, though this may range from 3 to 10. They are usually in 2 series. The fruits of each plant can be a capsule, samara, or drupe.

==Tribes and genera==
The Polygalaceae comprise the following genera, with tribes based on various sources.

*Carpolobieae 
**&quot;Atroxima&quot;

<text>&quot;Ponta Delgada&quot; is a rural civil parish in the Azorean municipality of Santa Cruz das Flores, on the Portuguese island of Flores. The population in 2021 was 280, in an area of 17.65 km2. It is situated along the northern coast from the regional capital. It is the third oldest religious parish on the island of Flores, only preceded by the communities of Lajes and Santa Cruz das Flores.

==History==
The religious parish of São Pedro da Ponta Delgada was one of the first three religious parishes on the island of Flores. The historical chronicler, Father Gaspar Frutuoso, stated that, at the end of the 16th century, Ponta Delgada was a small population of thirty neighbors and one chapel. A century later, Friar Agostinho de Montalverne referred to 650 inhabitants occupying 140 homes: essentially claiming it was the largest population on the island.

Diogo das Chagas first placed the colonization of this area at about 1571, attaining the position of parish immediately. It included the area from Ribeira Funda until Ribeira das Casas, as well as Ponta Ruiva (now in Cedros and Ponta da Fajã (now part of Fajã Grande in the neighbouring municipality). Father António Cordeiro referred to a community of 150 homes and several roads leading to the ocean. The fertility of the land and access to potable water greatly assisted this growth.

As Frutuoso noted, a primitive parish chapel was erected to the invocation of Santa Ana, but had long since &quot;disappeared&quot;. The church of São Pedro was erected in 1763 near a small chapel, with the same name, at the end of the 17th century. In addition to São Pedro, the chapel of Santo Amaro (which co-existed in the parish, since the end of the 17th century) was the centre of popular festivals and testified to the community&#x27;s dynamic nature: São Pedro, the protector of fishermen and Santo Amaro, protector of animals. The chapel of Santo Amaro was located near the old centre of the village near a grotto and spring. But, over time, the inhabitants decided to move the town centre away from the exposure to local northern wind currents. The principal promoter of a project to re-build the Church of São Pedro was Father Francisco de Fraga e Almeida, a man of immense wealth and former-Vicar of Flores and Corvo Islands. His final testament bequeathed 100 000 réis to the &quot;Confraria de São Pedro&quot; (English: Confraternity of Saint Peter) to celebrate a mass in his name on the day of the inauguration of the new temple. It is not clear when that finally occurred, but documents show that in 1774 the builders were still working on the altars of the Church. This church was restored twice more (in 1971 and 1975), both times maintaining the interior and original foundations.

On August 13, 1978 a new chapel was consecrated to the invocation of São João Baptista on Pico do Meio Dia near the site of a concrete cross that was consecrated on September 27, 1970. This new chapel gave rise to annual festivals celebrated every September.

==Geography==
The community is located on the northern coast of Flores Island, on a flat rock-bed that extends into the Atlantic Ocean, across from the island of Corvo (Flores&#x27; nearest neighbour). On either coast of the village are two islets, Maria Vaz (on the west coast) and João Martins, both named after important settlers during early colonization. Writing at the beginning of the 19th century, Father José António Camões described the villages place, as follows:

:&quot;...passing the Furnal point you travel northeast to the port of Ponta Delgada. There is there, at the foot of the ocean, a sweet water spring that serves a great many of the inhabitants of that parish. There is a port...without fortifications...but with a cliff that is protective. Continuing north-east begins the great bay of Ponta Delgada, falling to this ocean is the Ribeira da Fazenda...and within the parish a port, called Portinho, where only with good humour can you unload your boats. There is a guard house. Outside the small port are two islets, called the islets of Portinho...continuing along the same wind trajectory there is a point called Ponta do Ilhéu.&quot;

The area today is connected to Santa Cruz das Flores by a coastal road system that also crosses the interior of the island. The first automobile reached the parish in 1966: one of the last places on the island to be reached by road vehicles. Until then, transit to the north was made by horse-drawn carriage, by horse or mule, foot or by boat access from the south (when the weather permitted).

As a consequence of modern emigration to the United States and Canada, and recently to the larger centre in Santa Cruz das Flores, the population has been in steady decline; in 1814 forty births were registered in the parish, but by the 1980s between two and six births were recorded.

===Climate===
===Ecoregions/Protected areas===
There are a few lookouts that provide tourists with notable vistas of Ponta Delgada, including &quot;Miradouro do Pico do Meio-Dia&quot;, &quot;Miradouro do Alto do Portalinho&quot; and &quot;Miradouro do Porto&quot; and &quot;Miradouro do Facho&quot;. In addition Ponta Delgada is bisected by approximately seven pedestrian hiking trails, within the community and with other parishes.

===Natural Features===
* Ponta do Albernaz, natural rock cliffs located in the western portion of Ponta Delgada, location of the lighthouse
* Ilhéu da Maria Vaz, named for one of the original settlers of Flores, a small pyramidal islet in the bay of Ponta Delgada along its western coast.
* Ilhéus do João Martins, named for another settler, and located off the northern coast of Ponta Delgada.
* Pico do Meio Dia, location of the Chapel of São João Baptista, overlooking the southern part of Ponta Delgada
* Quebrada Nova dos Fenais, a fajã along the southwest limits of parish accessible by pedestrian trail.
* Ponta dos Ilhéus, an isthmus cliff on the southeast limit of the parish site of several mills constructed during settlement, now mostly in ruins.

== Economy ==
The parish&#x27;s principal activities are farming and animal husbandry (dairy and cattle ranching primarily), focusing on dairy production, as well as subsistence fishing and a small commercial nucleus. The port has had remodeling and modernization to permit both an increase in commercial traffic between Ponta Delgada, Vila do Corvo (Corvo Island) and the rest of the archipelago, as well as to capture lucrative trans-Atlantic maritime tourism.

==Architecture==

===Civic===
* Lighthouse of Ponta do Albernaz (), inaugurated on 28 January 1925 as part of the &quot;Plano Geral de Alumiamento e Balizagem&quot; (&quot;General Illumination and Nautical Signalling Plan&quot;) for the northern coast of Flores, with the intent of providing a beacon for shipping passing through the Flores-Corvo;

===Military===
* French Satellite Tracking Station of Flores (), referred to locally as the &quot;French Base of Flores&quot;; a ballistic missile tracking station established in 1964, and operational until 1994, when its duties were co-opted by the French tracking ship &quot;Monje&quot;.

===Religious===
* Church of São Pedro (), parochial church dedicated to St. Peter, constructed in 1763 and remodeled during the latter part of the 20th century;
* Casa do Espírito Santo de Terra Chã, religious buildings used in annual celebrations for the Divine Holy Spirit, erected in 1819
* Casa do Espírito Santo de Baixo, religious buildings used in annual celebrations for the Divine Holy Spirit, erected in 1847
* Casa do Espírito Santo da Cruz, religious buildings used in annual celebrations for the Divine Holy Spirit, erected in 1865
* Casa do Espírito Santo das Crianças, religious buildings used in annual celebrations for the Divine Holy Spirit, erected in 1926

==Culture==
The community is the centre of northern activities, and supports several cultural, social and sporting groups. In particular: it is the location of the regions Casa do Povo (literally the &quot;house of the people&quot;) and its ethnographic folklore group the &quot;Grupo Folclórico da Casa do Povo&quot;, a modern festival hall, the residence of the Grupo de Música Popular Vozes do Norte, and their football club Clube Desportivo de Ponta Delgada.

===Festivities===
The parish&#x27;s principal festival is the Festa de São Pedro (&quot;Festival of Saint Peter&quot;) celebrated annually on June 29, as well as the Festa do Santo Amaro (&quot;Festival of Saint Maurus&quot;), on the first Sunday of September. In addition, the Festa do São João (&quot;Festival of Saint John&quot;) on the second Sunday of July and the festival Nossa Senhora da Guia (&quot;Our Lady of the Guide&quot;) are also important religious events. Ultimately, the celebrations associated with the Holy Spirit, centered around the Sunday of Pentecost are the highlight of the religious calendar.

<text>The River Lathkill is a river in the Peak District National Park in Derbyshire, England.

First recorded in 1280, the name &quot;Lathkill&quot; possibly has Scandinavian roots, the old Norse &quot;hlada-kill&quot; translating as &quot;narrow valley with a barn&quot;.

==Course==

The Lathkill Dale starts just to the east of the small village of Monyash, to the west of Bakewell, and is dry initially. In times of high rainfall the source of the river is Lathkill Head Cave (), where water which has flowed underground from the Flagg area to the west of Monyash emerges, but in normal conditions the river rises from springs further down the valley. It flows generally eastward, and at Cales Dale it is joined on the right bank by a small tributary. Like the Lathkill, Cales Dale is dry at its upper end, with its stream rising near the bottom end. The river flows over five weirs and a waterfall. To the south of Haddon Grove Farm, an early 19th century farmhouse there are a series of weirs and sluices, at the start of a long section where the river and its banks are a scheduled monument. The Lathkill Dale and Mandale Mines and soughs have been protected beause they are rare examples of lead mining activity preserved in good condition, dating from the 16th to the 19th centuries.

As the river flows to the south of the village of Over Haddon, it is crossed by a grade II listed footbridge, made from limestone slabs supported by limestone rubble piers, one of several similar bridges in the area. It probably dates from the 18th century, and replaced a similar earlier bridge. Near the bridge is Sough Mill, a corn mill dating from the 18th century with a sluice gate nearby. Shortly afterwards, the river flows over eleven weirs, some with sluices, and there are two fish ponds on the right bank, connected to the river by sluices. There is another weir and sluice at Conksbury bridge () which carries the road from Bakewell to Youlgreave over the river. It dates from the 18th century, and was mentioned in the Turnpike Act (1758). It consists of a main gritstone arch over the river, with two smaller arches to either side, with a second large arch on the right bank of the river.

At this point, the river is heading to the south-east, and is crossed by Coal Pit Bridge, a mid-18th century footbridge which is just wide. It has a large arch in the centre, with smaller arches to either side. There are weirs, sluices and fish ponds on the upstream side, and three more weirs on the downstream side. There are several more weirs as the river approaches the village of Alport. The minor road from Rowsley to Youlgreave crosses the river just before it is joined by the River Bradford on it right bank. It turns to the east and is crossed by a footbridge and by Mill Bridge, which was built in the 18th century but raised in the early 19th. It is quite narrow, with a single arch over the river topped by ashlar parapets, where each of the ashlar blocks has a letter and a number inscribed in it. The river then turns to the north, and Alport Mill, a corn mill dating thom the 18th century which is now part of a trout farm is on the right bank. Nearby is another 18th century footbridge with three shallow arches.

There are more weirs before the river turns to the east, where there is a small brdige over the river. The land on the right bank is a scheduled monument, the site of Alport Smelt Mill, associated with the lead mining industry. At the eastern end of the site, weirs and a sluice form a large pond in the river, which then flows over several more weirs, before the Ivy Bar Brook joins on the right bank. Next comes Hawley Bridge, which has two arches and has a datestone showing the year 1775. A small bridge carries the access road to Bower Hall, a late 17th century house to the south of the river. The final bridge carries Stantonhall Lane over the river close to Lathkill Lodge. It has a single arch and dates from the early 19th century. Shortly afterwards, the river joins the River Wye on its right bank, close to Haddon Hall and to the west of Rowsley.

==History==
The dale has a history of lead mining, and among the trees on the north side of the valley are the remains of the 19th-century Mandale Mine, including an old aqueduct and the ruined pump house, used as one of the last attempts to keep the mines drained and workable.

The water in the river is often clear, and Charles Cotton wrote in &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; that it is:
Indeed, when the river is at its clearest the fish can be seen from one bank across to the other.

The river valley, known as Lathkill Dale, is popular with tourists who visit for its natural environment and wildlife.

Much of the river itself, and sections of the river valley, fall within the Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve and the Lathkill and Upper Lathkill SSSIs. Among the species that thrive there are brown trout, dipper, and the rare wild plant Jacob&#x27;s ladder.

Through the use of Bluetooth, it is now possible at particular locations in the nature reserve for visitors to download pictures of flowers and birds, and also examples of birdsong, onto their mobile phones.

The dale was used as a filming location for &quot;The Princess Bride&quot;.

==Access==
There is good access to most of the river. A public footpath runs down Lathkill Dale from where it meets the B5055 road near Monyash. From Lathkill Head Cave, it runs along the left bank to the small valley that runs up to Mill Farm. A permissive footpath continues along the left bank to Over Haddon footbridge, and then becomes a public footpath as far as Conksbury Bridge. Crossing the bridge, another footpath runs along the right bank, although it is set back from the river in places. It ends at Alport Lane Bridge, and below that, there are no footpaths along the banks, although the road from Alport to Haddon Hall, initially unclassified and later the B5056, runs quite close to the river.
There are car parks at Over Haddon, Moor Lane, Youlgrave and Conksbury Bridge, and bus services run from Over Haddon, Monyash and Youlgreave.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency assesses the water quality within the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Lathkill catchment was as follows in 2019/2022.

The chemical status is rated as fail, due to the levels of lead compounds in the upper river, and of lead and cadmium compounds in the lower river. These are the result of the historic quarrying industry in the valley. Like most rivers in the UK, in 2019 the chemical status was also affected by the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), which had not previously been included in the assessment.

<text>The Mayflower Steps are close to the site in the Barbican area of Plymouth, south-west England, from which the Pilgrim Fathers are believed to have finally left England aboard the &quot;Mayflower&quot; on 6 September 1620, before crossing the Atlantic Ocean to settle in North America. The traditional site of their disembarkation in North America is Plymouth Rock.

== Description ==
The steps today consist of a commemorative portico with Doric columns of Portland stone that was built in 1934, and a small platform over the water with a brushed steel rail and a shelf with nautical bronze artwork and historical information. It is on a small pier that is believed to have been built in the 18th or 19th century when some very old houses that were blocking construction of a road around the seaward side of the Royal Citadel leading to Plymouth Hoe were cleared together with the significant Watch House.

== History ==

The passengers who came predominantly from East Anglia had no links with Plymouth, but due to bad weather in the English Channel, they were forced to put in at Plymouth seeking shelter and essential repairs. Several surviving local buildings including what is now the Plymouth Gin Distillery in Southside Street and the Island House on the Quay are claimed to have accommodated some of them for one or more nights.

The best effort by local historians to place the actual site of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; finally casting off is roughly where a Victorian public house, the Admiral MacBride, now stands. Today, boat trips leave the Mayflower Steps for trips around the Plymouth Sound and up the River Tamar for sight of the &#x27;Dockyard and Warships&#x27;.

<text>The cywydd (; plural ) is one of the most important metrical forms in traditional Welsh poetry (cerdd dafod).

There are a variety of forms of the cywydd, but the word on its own is generally used to refer to the (&quot;long-lined couplet&quot;) as it is by far the most common type.

The first recorded examples of the cywydd date from the early 14th century, when it is believed to have been developed. This was the favourite metre of the Poets of the Nobility from the 14th to 17th centuries and is still used in the 21st.

The cywydd consists of a series of seven-syllable lines in rhyming couplets, with all lines written in cynghanedd. One of the lines must finish with a stressed syllable, while the other must finish with an unstressed syllable. The rhyme may vary from couplet to couplet, or may remain the same. There is no rule about how many couplets there must be in a cywydd.

The and the related , and the all occur in the list of the twenty four traditional Welsh poetic meters adopted in the later Middle Ages.

<text>Avenue of Flags is a park in the city of Hermitage in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, United States, erected during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979–1981 to honor the American diplomats held hostage in Tehran, Iran. The park is on the grounds of the Hillcrest Memorial Park cemetery and is open to the public.

The memorial began as a single American flag, surrounded by flags representing each of the 50 states, and was created by Tom Flynn, the owner of the adjacent Hillcrest Memorial Park cemetery. On February 11, 1980, the 100th day of captivity, Flynn decided to erect 100 flags and raise one flag every day afterward until the hostages were freed. The American hostages were held in Iran from November 4, 1979, to January 20, 1981. At the end, there were 444 flags, one for each day of captivity. One Canadian flag also flies on the avenue as a tribute to the Canadians from the Canadian Embassy in Tehran who risked their lives to save six hostages from captivity. There is also an eternal flame which burns in front of the monument dedicated to the eight American servicemen who died in the failed hostage rescue attempt on April 25, 1980.

The Avenue of the Flags is now run by the Non-profit Avenue of Flags Foundation.

<text>State Road 15 (SR 15) is part of the Florida State Road System. This route is part of a multi two-state route 15 that begins at Florida and ends at Georgia at the North Carolina state line.

==Route description==
SR 15 runs from SR 80/SR 880 at Belle Glade north along the east shore of Lake Okeechobee to Okeechobee. Then it runs north to SR 500 (US 192) at Holopaw, and northwest along SR 500 to Ashton (east of St. Cloud), where it ends.

County Road 15 in Osceola County and Orange County connects to the beginning of the next section, at SR 528 (the Bee Line Expressway) east of Orlando International Airport. From there, SR 15 travels north on Narcoossee Road, west on Hoffner Road, north on Conway Road through Conway, west on Lake Underhill Road, and west on South Street (northbound) and Anderson Street (southbound) on both sides of SR 408 to downtown Orlando. It then travels north on Mills Avenue and follows US 17 all the way to downtown Jacksonville. From there it follows Interstate 95 to the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway, and then northwest into Georgia, as Georgia State Route 15.

SR 15 is practically unsigned, except in three places:
* from the south end to US 98 / US 441 north of Belle Glade
* SR 528 to SR 50 in downtown Orlando
*from U.S. 17/92 &amp; FL 46 to I-4 &amp; U.S. 17/92 Interchange (Co-signed with SR 500) in Sanford
The rest is signed as various U.S. Highways:
* US 441 from north of Belle Glade to the end of the first section, east of St. Cloud
* US 17 from Orlando to Jacksonville (With the exception of Sanford between U.S. 17/92 &amp; FL 46 to I-4 &amp; U.S. 17/92 Interchange)
* US 1 / US 23 from Jacksonville to Georgia
* US 301 from Callahan to Georgia (co-signed with US 1 and US 23)

==History==
Prior to the 1945 renumbering, the route that became SR 15 had the following numbers:
* SR 143 from Belle Glade to Canal Point
* SR 194 from Canal Point to south of Okeechobee
* SR 29 from south of Okeechobee to Orlando
* SR 24 from Holopaw to Ashton
* SR 3A in downtown Orlando
* SR 3 from Orlando to south of Jacksonville, Florida
* SR 21 north of downtown DeLand
* SR 28 from San Mateo to Palatka
* SR 14 from East Palatka to Palatka
* SR 48 in Green Cove Springs
* SR 363 from south of Jacksonville to Jacksonville
* SR 3 in downtown Jacksonville
* SR 4 from Jacksonville, Florida to Georgia

SR 15 was defined in the 1945 renumbering as:
* Extending from SR 80 in Belle Glade in Palm Beach County in a general Northwesterly direction along Lake Okeechobee via Pahokee to Okeechobee then Northwesterly to a junction with SR 500 at Holopaw and along SR 500 to Ashton, then continuing Northwesterly to a junction with SR 600 in Orlando and along SR 600 to an intersection with SR 46 at 25th St. in Sanford, then along SR 600 and SR 46 to First St. then along SR 600 across St. Johns River to an intersection with SR 40 and SR 44 in DeLand, then along SR 600 and SR 40 to a point North of DeLand and along SR 40 to Barberville, then Northwesterly via Pierson, Crescent City and Satsuma to a junction with SR 20 and SR 100 at San Mateo, then along SR 20 and SR 100 via East Palatka to an intersection of SR 20 and SR 100 at Reid St. and 7th St. in Palatka, then along SR 100 to an intersection of SR 100 and SR 15 on Madison St. near the NW City Limits of Palatka, then Northwesterly to SR 16 in Green Cove Springs and along SR 16 to Orange Ave., then in a Northwesterly direction via Orange Park, Jacksonville, and Callahan to the St. Mary&#x27;s River at the Georgia State Line.
* Also proposed route running North and Northwest from junction with SR 500 at Holopaw to a point near the Orange County and Osceola County Line on SR 15.
* Also from a point on SR 15 and SR 600 North of Longwood in Seminole County in a Northerly direction to intersection with SR 15 and SR 600 just South of St. Johns River at the Volusia County and Seminole County Line.
* Also a proposed route from a point on SR 15 North of Satsuma, North to intersection with SR 15 and SR 100 in Palatka.

Neither proposed route was built. The alternate route in Seminole County was going to be a bypass of Sanford, but construction of SR 400 (Interstate 4) relegated it to a minor road, and it became CR 15 in the 1980s.

The main route has stayed mostly the same. Here are the places where the route now differs:
* The south end of SR 15 has stayed the same, but SR 80 has moved to the north, and thus the first three miles (5 km) of SR 15 is also SR 80.
* SR 15 is now CR 15 in Osceola County and Orange County from SR 500 in Ashton to SR 528 east of Orlando International Airport.
* SR 15 originally went from Conway to Orlando along Conway Road, but then turned west at Curry Ford Road and used Briercliff Drive, Delaney Avenue, and Gore Street to reach SR 527. The part of the old alignment on Curry Ford Road became part of SR 526A when SR 15 was moved.
* Until around 1975, when the Mills Avenue Extension was built, SR 15 continued west from Mills Avenue along what is now SR 5098, and then went north on SR 527 through downtown Orlando, returning to the current route via SR 50.
* When the 20th Street Expressway was built in Jacksonville, SR 15 was rerouted onto it; the old route is now SR 139 (and was first given the number SR 15A).

<text>Total Ministry, also sometimes called Local Shared Ministry, Ministering Communities in Mission, Mutual Ministry, or Circular Ministry, is a style of Christian ministry which empowers laity to take on roles traditionally given to parish priests, pastors, etc. The total ministry movement began within the Episcopal Church.

At the heart of the understanding of Total Ministry is the belief that through baptism all Christian people are gifted for mission and ministry within and for the Church.

Many people are introduced to Total Ministry through workshops offered in their diocese or region, through spiritual direction or via retreat.

The concept is widely credited with having originated after Jesus inviting his followers to keep going the ministry of baptism with the waters of the Holy Spirit and the water of reconciliation and with the apostle Paul, who said that everyone receives the Holy Spirit. This concept of the &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot; has led to the development of new patterns of ministry including Total Ministry. More recently the re-discovery of the writings of Father Roland Allen, an Anglican missionary in China, has acted as a catalyst for the development of the ecclesiology.

<text>Lajes das Flores () is a municipality in the western part of the Azores; it includes the southern part of the island of Flores. To the north, where it is bordered by Santa Cruz das Flores. The population in 2021 was 1,408, in an area of . Its municipal seat is in the parish of the same name.

==History==

Flores was discovered by Diogo de Teive and his son, João de Teive, in 1452. Within a year, 20 January 1453, the islands of &quot;Corvo Marini&quot; (&quot;Marine Crows&quot;), meaning the islands of Flores and Corvo, was donated to D. Afonso, Duke of Bragança and Count of Barcelso by King Afonso V. On 20 January 1475, João Teive ceded the captaincy to Fernão Teles de Meneses, but by 1 March 1504, the captaincy was donated to João da Fonseca by King Manuel I.

The first documented reference to Lajes was to the first religious parish on the island, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Our Lady of the Rosary). Lajes, the town, was the first area to be populated in the southern part of the island, around the 16th Century; in 1510, owing to its natural port and growing settlement it prospered, attaining the title of &quot;vila&quot; (town) by 1515 (becoming, some say, the oldest settlement in the Western Group of Azorean islands).

In 1587, the small community was destroyed by English privateers, then when the population was more numerous then in Santa Cruz.

Initially, Lajes das Flores extended from Ribeira da Silva (now part of the parish of Lomba) to Fajã Grande (which included the localities of Lajedo, Fajãzinha, Caldeira, Mosteiro, Fajã Grande and Fazenda). The western places, with the exception of Lajedo, were de-annexed to form the parish of Nossa Senhora dos Fajã, an independent parish in 1676 (and whose seat in Fajãzinha. Fazenda, was eventually de-annexed in 1919.

Around the 19th-Century, due to the rivalries on the small island, and owing to Santa Cruz das Flores&#x27; dominance economically and politically, it was undertaken to unify Lajes and Santa Cruz municipalities into one. The Civil Governor of the District of Horta (which included within it the islands of Horta, Flores and Corvo), António José Vieira Santa Rita, in a royal report dated 1869, rationalized that the island could not support two municipalities, and that on the island of Corvo &quot;one administrative parish is enough for the population&quot;. Continuing he affirmed that &quot;in actuality, instead of benefitting, the [municipal status] is a burden on the population who would have it alleviated...they find themselves annexed already for falling under...the Municipality of Santa Cruz, and also by the service of the industry and judiciary&quot;. On June 26, 1867, then national assembly deputy Martens Ferrão had suggested the same in that &quot;the two islands Flores and Corvo would be constituted as just one municipality, and that it naturally should be her future.&quot; In his analysis, José António Vieira Santa Rita also proposed the extinction of Lajes, finding that the residents of the Villa would unfavourably, but that the rest of the southern settlers would tolerate it. The fusion of the municipalities was forced by decrete on November 18, 1895, and published in the official journal the following day, and included the suppression of the municipalities of Lajes and Corvo. This was appreciated and supported by the Municipal government in Santa Cruz das Flores, during this time governed by the &quot;Partido Regenerador (Cartistas)&quot;, of which the former Martens Ferrão was a member. This change did not last too long; on January 13, 1898, the Cartistas fell out of favor, and the municipalities were restored: Lajes das Flores, Santa Cruz das Flores and Corvo. This change was welcome to the small bourgeois in Lajes; on March 17, 1898, the restored Municipal Council sent a formal letter of thanks to the Minister of the King, José Luciano de Castro, for &quot;...the autonomy which was disputed by the populous in general in all the municipality&quot;. From that session onwards the main square of Lajes was renamed from the plain &quot;Largo do Município&quot; to &quot;Largo do Exmo. Conselheiro José Luciano de Castro&quot;.

The establishment of the Telecommunications Station and French Base on the Flores (in 1960), although in Santa Cruz, was an economic benefit to most of the citizens in both municipalities. The first aspect station to arrive in Lajes municipality was the Radionaval Station, which was installed in the Lajes lighthouse (in the centre of town). The lands were expropriated for the station in 1945, although the final inauguration did not occur until 1951. In 1965 the LORAN Station of Flores was completed in the parish of Fazenda.

The completion of the commercial port in Lajes was significant in altering the roadways of the southern municipality, during the mandate of its President/Mayor Albino Cristiano Gomes.

== Geography ==
Situated on the southern maritime coast and extending to the southwest, the municipality of Lajes is one of two administrative divisions of the island of Flores. The southern municipality is more widely populated than its northern neighbour, although settlements within the interior are considered few and scattered on the rugged landscape.

Lajes is included in the &quot;Zona de Protecção Especial da Costa Sul e Sudoeste da ilha das Flores&quot; (&quot;South and Southwest Coast of Flores Special Protection Zone&quot;) as part of the Rede Natura 2000.

The municipality is composed of seven civil parishes () with their own administrative organs (), they include:

* Fajã Grande - located in the basin and fajã on the western coast, with a population of less than 250 inhabitants;
* Fajãzinha - less than 100 residents live in this community, located north of Fajã Grande; Fajãzinha is a diminutive of fajã, referring to it being a small agglomeration of homes in the corner of the fajã; 
* Fazenda - literally meaning &quot;commercial goods&quot; or &quot;location where [these] goods are available for sale&quot;, it was the last civil parish to be formed (de-annexed from its neighbour in 1919); there less than 300 people living in an area of ;
* Lajedo - an agricultural community located 9 km from Lajes, and close to one of the islands ex-libris, the Rocha dos Bordões, as well as other natural monuments;
* Lajes das Flores - the seat of the municipal government, located in the southeast coast; largest population center in the municipality;
* Lomba - location of the island&#x27;s first chapel, and neighbour of the parish of Lajes, Lomba literally represents an area border by river-valleys along the southern coast; 
* Mosteiro - the smallest parish in area and density, with less than 50 residents; it is the second smallest center on the island.

The main urban nucleus (Lajes) is implanted in a small area that includes the historical small port and arriba in the southeast, from where the first community of Lajes extending along former footpaths and rural roads. The area is marked by an accented relief of cliffs and mountainous, dominated by patches of forest, alternating with walled pasturelands. Agricultural areas are located between Lajes and Fazenda, situated in the northeast, while the southern coast comprises the Fajã Grande, Fajãzinha, Fazenda, Lajedo, Lajes, Lomba and Mosteiro.

== Economy ==
Lajes economy is driven by agriculture, including dairy production, and a reasonable fishery. In the past, whale-hunting was an aspect of the latter economy, during the 1960-70s, which has since been abandoned, although remnants of this aspect are visible in some of the communities.

<text>The [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] E-1, introduced in 2003, was the first DSLR system camera designed from the ground up for digital photography This contrasts with its contemporaries which offered systems based on reused parts from previous 135 film systems, modified to fit with a sensor size of APS-C.

==Features==
The E-1 uses the Four Thirds System lens mount and imaging system. This design choice means that because the CCD is smaller than a 35 mm negative, Four Thirds System lenses and camera bodies can be made smaller and lighter than those of preceding SLRs.

Characteristics:
*Lighter/more compact than contemporary DSLR bodies
*5 megapixel CCD
*Magnesium-alloy body
*Environmental sealing (splash proof)
*&quot;Supersonic Wave Filter&quot; dust reduction system cleans CCD at each camera start-up (dust is shaken off the CCD)
*USB 2.0 and FireWire connectivity
*Continuous shooting 3 frames per second up to 12 frames
*Hybrid white balance sensor (on external surface of camera and using CCD)
*User upgradeable firmware

Sometimes the user experiences bright spots in long (greater than a few seconds) exposures. This is called long exposure noise. By turning on the &quot;Noise Removal&quot; (not &quot;Noise Filter&quot;), the E-1 will do a “dark frame subtraction” to get rid of these erroneous bright spots.

The development of the E-1 involved the revitalization of Olympus&#x27; old Zuiko lens brand, through a new range named &quot;Zuiko Digital&quot; with the Four Thirds system lens mount. The E-1 was usually sold bundled with a splash proof Zuiko Digital 14–54 mm 1:2.8–3.5 zoom lens.

Olympus initially gave away free adapters to connect OM lenses to the new Four Thirds System mount. This adapter allowed a wide range of OM lenses to be used with the new Olympus DSLRs. The adapter is no longer given away for free, but is still available for purchase from authorised Olympus resellers.

<text>No. 84 Squadron of the Royal Air Force is at present a Search and Rescue Squadron based at RAF Akrotiri, using the Westland/Airbus Helicopters Puma HC Mk.2 helicopter. The squadron transitioned from the previously operated Bell Griffin HAR.2 to the Puma HC.2 in 2023.

Although originally formed at Beaulieu in 1917 as part of the RFC, it was already in France when the RAF came into being, and as of 2024, 84 Squadron is the only remaining RAF squadron that spent its entire service history abroad. It is currently one of the two operational parts of the RAF Search and Rescue Force left in service (the other being the RAF Mountain Rescue Service) after the stand-down of the UK effort on 5 October 2015.

==History==
===First World War===
No. 84 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was formed on 16 February 1917 at East Boldre (Beaulieu) under the command of Major Hazelton Nicholl. It was equipped with a variety of types for training purposes, including Avro 504Ks, a Curtiss JN, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.12s, Nieuport 12s and Sopwith 1½ Strutters. The squadron started to receive its intended operational equipment, the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a single-seat fighter, in July 1917, although at first its SE.5as suffered engine problems, delaying the squadron&#x27;s work up. On 8 August, Nicholl was replaced as commanding officer by the experienced major Sholto Douglas, who had already commanded 43 Squadron. 

The squadron moved to France for service over the Western front in September 1917, equipped with SE.5as. Initial operations were patrols and escort duties over Flanders, and when the Battle of Cambrai took place in November–December that year, the squadron flew top cover for aircraft carrying out ground attack and artillery spotting duties, while countering German attempts to attack British troops. From December 1917, the squadron joined the 5th Brigade of the Royal Flying Corps, operating in support of the British Fifth Army. In January 1918, it added ground-attack operations to its normal fighter duties, with the squadron heavily committed to ground-attack duties during the German spring offensive from March 1918. One speciality of the squadron was the destruction of German observation balloons, with one of the squadron&#x27;s pilots, Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor, claiming 16 destroyed as well as 22 enemy aeroplanes. Beauchamp-Proctor was awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts. In total the squadron had claimed 129 German aeroplanes and 50 balloons destroyed by the end of the war on 11 November 1918. The squadron deployed to Germany as part of the British occupation forces until August 1919 when discarded its SE.5as and returned to the United Kingdom as a Cadre in August 1919. It was disbanded on 30 January 1920.

The squadron&#x27;s aces during the First World War included Andrew Beauchamp-Proctor, Hugh Saunders and Walter A. Southey.

===Between the wars===

The squadron was reformed on 13 August 1920 at Baghdad in Iraq, moving to RAF Shaibah in September, where it remained for the next 20 years. Its initial equipment was DH.9As (until January 1929) and these were replaced by Wapitis (beginning July 1928), Vincents (December 1935) and Blenheims Mk.Is (February 1939).

One of the squadron&#x27;s artefacts is a pair of pink frilly knickers known as &#x27;Jane&#x27;s Panties&#x27;. These were presented to the squadron in 1936 by Jane Newman (a debutante from Australia) who was rescued by 84 squadron when her aircraft crashed in the Western Desert. This story may more accurately relate to the location and rescue by Vickers Vincent aircraft of 84 Squadron of Imperial Airways Handley Page H.P. 42E G-AAUC Horsa which forced landed on 29 August 1936, in the Arabian Desert south of Salwa Wells in Qatar, having overflown Bahrain airport. Miss Jane Wallace Smith, an American novelist is named as the presenter of the undergarments to the squadron.

===Second World War===
The squadron flew its first combat operation of the war on 15 August 1940, when six 84 Squadron Blenheims, which were being ferried from Iraq to Aden to reinforce the Blenheim squadrons based there, encountered an Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.81 near Kamaran Island and shot it down. It moved to RAF Heliopolis in Egypt in September 1940, operating from forward bases at Fuka and Qotaifiya for operations against the Germans from October 1940. The Italian invasion of Greece in October 1940 resulted in Britain diverting much of its aerial strength to support the Greeks, and 84 Squadron was moved to Greece in November 1940. The squadron operated from Menidi near Athens, initially bombing Italian forces on the Albanian front, but as the Italian offensive stalled in December 1940, switched to attacks against the port of Valona and the airfield at Berat, both in Italian-occupied Albania. In April 1941 German forces invaded Greece, quickly over-running the Greek and British defences, and the few surviving Blenheims were evacuated via Crete on 21 April.
The squadron moved to RAF Aqir in Palestine on 27 April as a result of tensions between Britain and Iraq. When hostilities broke out on 2 May, with Iraqi forces threatening the RAF base at Habbaniya, west of Baghdad, 84 Squadron supported the forces sent to relieve Habbaniya, and when Germany and Italy sent air reinforcements to Iraq via airfields in Vichy-French Syria, carried out attacks on these airfields. Operations against Iraqi forces continued until 31 May when the pro-German Iraqi Prime-Minister, Rashid Ali fled and an armistice was signed. The squadron then took part in the invasion of Syria and Lebanon, taking part in attacks on Vichy French airfields and reconnaissance missions. In 25–28 August 1941, the squadron took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. By November, it had returned to Egypt and operations over the Western Desert.

The Japanese invasion of Malaya resulted in 84 Squadron being one of a number of squadrons ordered to reinforce British and Commonwealth forces in the Far East, with the squadron arriving in Sumatra in late January 1942. The squadron evacuated to Java in February 1942 following the Japanese Invasion of Sumatra, but lost its remaining Blenheims and twenty of its personnel during the Battle of Kalijati when Japanese troops attacked and captured the base of the RAF&#x27;s bombers in Java. In March 1942, eleven members of 84 Squadron commandeered a lifeboat and sailed away from Java to escape the advancing Japanese forces. They made land 47 days later in north-western Australia. The lifeboat was named &#x27;Scorpion&#x27; in honour of the Squadron Badge.

The squadron reformed at Karachi on 17 March 1942, moving to Drigh Road airfield on 1 April, equipping with more Blenheims and moving to Quetta in June, where it discarded its Blenheims. In December 1942, the squadron, now based at Vizagapatam on the East coast of India (now known as Visakhapatnam), received its planned operational equipment, the Vultee Vengeance dive bomber. Training was delayed by slow deliveries of Vengeances, and while other squadrons began operations in March, 84 Squadron moved to Ceylon in April, to guard the island against potential Japanese attack. The squadron relieved 45 Squadron based at Kumbhirgram in Assam on 10 February and flew its first operational mission with the Vengeance on 16 February. It flew its Vengeances in support of the second Chindit operation behind Japanese lines and against the Japanese offensive against Imphal and Kohima. 

After the Japanese retreat from Imphal and Kohima, it was decided to withdraw the Vengeance from operational service in Burma, as more versatile fighter bombers were becoming available in increasing numbers and the Vengeance would not be able to carry out its normal dive-bombing attacks once the monsoon season was underway. 84 Squadron flew its last bombing raid with the Vengeance on 16 July. After withdrawal from the front line, the squadron discarded its Vengeances, and used Airspeed Oxfords to train its aircrews on twin-engined aircraft in preparation for operating De Havilland Mosquitos, but it did not receive Mosquitos until February 1945. It was still training when the Second World War ended in September 1945.

===Postwar===
The squadron moved to Singapore in September 1945, but in November a detachment was sent to Java in response to the Indonesian war of independence, flying reconnaissance and bombing missions against Indonesian republican forces. The rest of the squadron moved to Java in January 1946, remaining there until May, when it moved to Kuala Lumpur in Malaya. By this time the squadron&#x27;s Mosquitos were suffering structural problems caused by gluing failures, and in November 1946 the squadron re-equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter which it flew until March 1949, re-equipping with Bristol Brigands at RAF Habbaniya in Iraq, becoming the first squadron equipped with Brigands.

In February 1950, four Brigands were detached to Mogadishu, joining a detachment from 8 Squadron flying support for the British withdrawal from Somalia. In April 1950, the squadron was transferred to RAF Tengah on Singapore to take part in Operation Firedog, the RAFs response to the Malayan Emergency. The Brigands were employed on strikes against insurgent strongholds with guns, rockets and bombs. Operations were affected by a number of problems with the Brigand, including the loss of several aircraft due to cannon explosions, which resulted in the aircraft being prohibited from firing their guns for several months, problems with the aircraft&#x27;s propellers, which again caused the loss of several aircraft, and the development of skin cracks, which caused the Brigand&#x27;s bombload to be restricted. In January 1953, following the crash of a Brigand after one of its wings had failed during a dive, the squadron&#x27;s Brigands were permanently grounded. 

The squadron was disbanded on 20 February 1953, but on the same day, 204 Squadron, a transport squadron equipped with Vickers Valettas based at RAF Fayid in Egypt, was renumbered to No. 84 Squadron. The squadron was used mainly for routine transport flights around the Middle East, until British forces left Egypt in March 1956, with the squadron moving to RAF Nicosia in Cyprus. The squadron took part in Operation Musketeer, the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt during the Suez Crisis, in November 1956, its Valettas carrying out paratroop drops. The squadron moved to RAF Khormaksar, Aden in January 1956, carrying out transport operations around the Arabian peninsular, and in particular, supporting the British Army in the Aden Protectorate. In June 1958 it received a flight of four-engined Blackburn Beverley heavy transports to supplement its Valettas, and in August 1960 the squadron&#x27;s Valetta flight was detached to become No. 233 Squadron RAF. In late 1967, the Beverley was replaced by the Hawker Siddeley Andover, and when UK forces left Aden the squadron moved to RAF Sharjah, then in the Trucial States (now the United Arab Emirates). The squadron was disbanded at Muharraq on 31 October 1971.

=== Cyprus ===

The squadron was reformed on 17 January 1972 from 1563 Flight and a detachment from 230 Squadron with Westland Whirlwind HAR.10s assigned to British Forces Cyprus at RAF Akrotiri, with a detachment at Nicosia International Airport. Duties included support of United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) operations and search and rescue duties for the whole of southern Cyprus. To meet this dual role, the squadron was divided into two flights, with &quot;A&quot; flight, based at Akrotiri for search and rescue duties, with its helicopters painted in overall yellow, and &quot;B&quot; flight for UN support at Nicosia with camouflaged helicopters marked with pale blue bands matching the blue berets of UN peacekeepers, but with no RAF roundels or titles displayed on the B Flight helicopters. After the 1975 Defence Review resulted in the withdrawal of the RAF&#x27;s fixed-wing squadrons from the Mediterranean, 84 Squadron was the only RAF squadron permanently based on Cyprus, sharing Akrotiri with RAF fighter squadrons visiting the island to attend Armament Practice Camps. The squadron later (December 1981) replaced the Whirlwind with the Westland Wessex HC.2 and later still (June 1984) with the Westland Wessex HU.5C. It was the last squadron to use the Westland Wessex. The Wessex HU.5C was retired during February 1995. The two flights were combined when the squadron shrunk in size to five helicopters after re-equipment with the Wessex, but its helicopters retain aircraft the light blue band around their tail.

No. 84 Squadron was the first RAF contingent into Beirut in the Lebanese Crisis of 1983. This resulted in the evacuation of the peace-keeping element from the city. The responsibility for civil search and rescue duties was eventually transferred to the Cyprus Police Aviation Unit.
In January 2003 the squadron discarded its Wessexes, replacing them with four contractor owned but military flown Bell Griffin HAR.2 helicopters, with the main duties being search and rescue in support of British forces on Cyprus, also carrying out transport operations for British army units based on the island. On 31 March 2023, the squadron replaced its Griffins with Westland/Airbus Helicopters Puma HC.2s.

==Symbols==
The squadron&#x27;s badge, approved by George VI in December 1936 is the scorpion, and its motto is &quot;Scorpiones pungunt&quot;, Latin for &quot;Scorpions sting&quot;.

<text>A tophus (Latin: &quot;stone&quot;, : tophi) is a deposit of monosodium urate crystals, in people with longstanding high levels of uric acid (urate) in the blood, a condition known as hyperuricemia. Tophi are pathognomonic for the disease gout. Most people with tophi have had previous attacks of acute arthritis, eventually leading to the formation of tophi. Chronic tophaceous gout is known as Harrison Syndrome. 

Tophi form in the joints, cartilage, bones, and other places throughout the body. Sometimes, tophi break through the skin and appear as white or yellowish-white, chalky nodules. Without treatment, tophi may develop on average about ten years after the onset of gout, although their first appearance can range from three to forty-two years. The development of gouty tophi can also limit joint function and cause bone destruction, leading to noticeable disabilities, especially when gout cannot successfully be treated. When uric acid levels and gout symptoms cannot be controlled with standard gout medicines that decrease the production of uric acid (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) or increase uric acid elimination from the body through the kidneys (e.g., probenecid), this can be referred to as refractory chronic gout (RCG). They are more apt to appear early in the course of the disease in people who are older.

Although less common, tophi can also form in the kidneys and nasal cartilage.

==Pathophysiology==
It appears that monosodium urate crystals trigger a distinct physiological NETosis pathway that coats them in DNA. These coated crystals then persist in tissues as a foreign body granuloma constituting gouty tophus.

<text>Fajã Grande is a rural civil parish in the municipality of Lajes das Flores in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2021 was 220, in an area of 12.97 km2. Although it is a relatively small population, it is one of the largest centers in the municipality of Lajes das Flores, about from the municipal seat, and the westernmost settlement in Europe; the closest North American settlement is St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, being about away. It contains the localities Cuada, Ponta (da Fajã) and Fajã.

== Toponymy ==
Meaning &quot;big fajã&quot;, a special term roughly referring to a coastal scree influenced by lava, as the town resides down from a notable cliff-face.

== History ==
The western coast of Flores was slowly occupied in the middle of the 16th century, with the first population centers forming in the beginning of the 17th century. The first settlers were captained by João Soares, from the island of São Miguel, and who settled in Lajedo. The fertile land permitted the cultivation of woad, one of the most important commercial ventures in the Azores. As the Azorean chronicler Father Gaspar Frutuoso writing in the 16th century, indicated, that the colonists benefited from the abundance of water and easy access to the sea:
:&quot;&quot;There, about a quarter league is Fajã, called &quot;Big&quot; [referring to its name Great/Grande Fajã] which offers bread and woad on elevated land, with a few berths for Caravels, it produces at least 50 moios [Portuguese unit of solid measure] of bread and woad, and where, also, there is shellfish and fish of all kinds, and along its cape a beach, half a league in size, where there is always a strong ocean current; and from there, another half a league, the cliffs are covered with much urzela [a lichen], and large rocks, that spawn an infinity of seafood and large crabs, and from here, there is an explosion of rocks that fall to the sea, like a guns spray, where we find limpets and cowrie shells; and in front of this point, which forms a bay, where many type of ships anchor, including Carracks from India. In the middle of this anchorage a great river-valley falls from the cliffs to sea.&quot;

Although being populated for less than a century, Fajã Grande was already a center of commercial activity; caravels arriving from India were likely to stopover in Fajã Grande since it was one of the first ports to be discovered on their return. On the port of Fajã Grande, Father José António Camões, noted the following about its installations:
:&quot;...there is a small breakwater called Baixa d’Agoa. Continue down until you get to the port of Fajã Grande, which has in the middle a great mound of sand and rock called Calhau da Barra. Within this Calhau is a large &quot;puddle&quot; called the Poção, which gives refuge to ships that arrive from the sea.&quot;&quot;

The fertility of the land permitted the cultivation of the lichen &quot;Rocella tinctoria&quot; (Roccellaceae), a plant sought after by many of the commercial interests in the region eager to support the dye industries of Europe. The abundance of fresh water, and port, also made Fajã Grande an important stopover for pirates and privateers; while other communities in the archipelago lived in fear of pirates, Fajã Grande maintained a collaborative relationship and sold consumables to local crews.

It was likely one of the most prosperous communities in the western coast, resulting in its de-annexation from the neighbouring parish of Lajes das Flores, in July 1676. To create the new parish of &quot;Fajãs&quot;, the local community in Ponta da Fajã was de-annexed from the neighbouring parish of São Pedro de Ponta Delgada and integrated into the new administrative and ecclesiastical division. The formal delimitation of the parish was presided by Father Domingos Nunes Pereira, and the new Fajãs parish priest Father André Alves de Mendonça, on 12/13 July 1676.

Writing around 1720, Father António Cordeiro, affirmed that the Fajãs included about 80 homes. The creation of an autonomous parish in Fajã Grande dates back to 1855, when the administration of the District of Horta attempted to resolve the call by its residents to create a new civil parish. The debate was finally ended by the civil governor, Luís Teixeira de Sampaio, who reported on 3 April 1857, that a single parish of Fajã Grande was desirable, owing to its distance from the community of Fajãzinha (then parish seat), the size of its community, and the problem caused by annual floodings along the Riberia Grande river, which regularly cut links annually. Local narratives mention several instances when the Ribeira Grande impeded travel to Fajãzinha, resulting in the faithful having services at the &quot;Pedra da Missa&quot; (), an elevated point on the river bank where they gathered, prayed and then dispersed after celebrating the liturgy. Governor Sampaio also noted that American whaling and high-seas travel had brought a new importance to the village, also justifying a rethink of the existing administrative divisions. Finally, on 4 April 1861, King Pedro V of Portugal decreed the creation of a new ecclesiastical parish, to include Ponta, Fajã Grande and Cuada, centred on the Church of São José da Fajã Grande (the responsibility of the Bishop of Angra, friar Estêvão de Jesus Maria, dated 20 June 1861. The parochial church was constructed from the small chapel (which was built in 1755, and blessed on 24 May 1757); the new temple was blessed on 1 August 1850, after three years of construction (it was finally completed in 1849). Due to further support from American emigrant José Luís da Silveira, the church was remodelled in 1880. A new church was later constructed in the area of Ponta da Fajã (the Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo) and remained in use until 1922. Similarly, on 28 September 1969, a chapel in Ponta was completed, to the invocation of Nossa Senhora da Fátima.

Landslides around the area of Ponta da Fajã in 1987 resulted in the declaration of this zone as &quot;high risk&quot; resulting in the express prohibition of new buildings and future remodeling of existing homes. Further landslides around Covas, in 1991, resulted in new laws to restrict residents in the area, which was ignored by the 20 inhabitants, who have maintained existing buildings .

== Geography ==

=== Physical geography ===
The village is located in an extensive fajã (a small area of flat fertile land at the bottom of a seaside cliff composed of volcanic and geomorphological debris) on the western coast and delimited by the Rocha da Fajã escarpment (that extends from the northwest to southeast border) and the Ribeira Grande river along the south. The escarpment is an almost sheer cliff face, approximately 600 meters in some places. The rest of Fajã Grande is formed from erosional forces along the Rocha da Fajã, producing a rich soil, although rocky, that is nutrient-rich due to the abundance of water from river tributaries. The escarpment is also a protective feature, permitting the cultivation of orchards and small parcels, and yams in the well-irrigated parcels along the river. Above the Rocha, about , the parish extends onto an irregular plateau covered in natural vegetation and peat. The excessive precipitation in this region, which usually exceeds annually, means that the river-valleys are always flooded or inundated. The northwest border extends along the western coast of the parish on a strip of land adjacent to the escarpment.

Situated on the plateau are four large crater lakes, &quot;Lagoa da Caldeira Funda&quot; (&quot;Lake of the Deep Crater&quot;), &quot;Lagoa da Caldeira Comprida&quot; (&quot;Lake of the Long Crater&quot;) and &quot;Lagoa da Caldeira Branca&quot; (&quot;Lake of the White Crater&quot;) which are full throughout the year, and the peat-covered &quot;Lagoa da Caldeira Seca&quot; (&quot;Lake of the Dry Crater&quot;) which only occasionally becomes flooded. The &quot;Lagoa dos Patos&quot; (&quot;Lake of the Ducks&quot;) is located at the base of the plateau.

Off the western coast, the Monchique Islet, is the westernmost point of the Azores (and Europe).

===Climate===
===Human geography===

The escarpment surrounds the community composed of three nuclei: Fajã Grande (the largest population), Ponta da Fajã Grande (a narrow strip between the coast and Rocha da Fajã), and Cuada (a settlement located on a plateau bordering the parish of Fajãzinha to the south). Cuada, for many years, was a collection of uninhabited homes, but today it has been rejuvenated by rural tourism, and classified as an &quot;Area of Municipal Interest&quot;.

The port at Fajã Grande, once an important commercial port, has lost much of its importance and is now used recreationally and, only rarely, for disembarking commercial goods. The entire zone is valued for its coastal waters, attracting both swimmers and surfers from around the island.

Between 1960 and 1980, approximately 60% of the active population emigrated to the United States and Canada.

==Economy==
Fajã Grande had always been characterized by its land and connection to the sea, resulting in a considerable part of its population employed in the primary industries (about 50%), that included agriculture, livestock husbandry and fishing. Over time, secondary industries began to occupy a greater part of the local activities (but generally hovered around 20% of activities), and primarily tourism, commerce and complementary services.

==Architecture==


===Civic===
* Site of Cuada ()
* Whalewatching lookout (), a cabin overlooking the cliffs of Fajã Grande, with a panoramic view of the coast, used in the whaling industry to site pods of whales and direct whaling boats.

===Religious===
* Chapel of Santo António, on a path within the locality of Cuada;
* Church of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (), erected in 1898, in the locality of Ponta da Fajã, consisting of a single nave building with belltower;
* Church of São José (), constructed in 1868, it was based on a primitive chapel dedicated to Saint Joseph, which was originally built in 1755. The church is distinguished for two altars in the arch separating the chamber and chancel.
* Império of Cuada (), dated from 1841, a &quot;treatro&quot; involved in the festivals of Pentecost.

==Culture==
Generally, Fajã Grande is typical of rural associativism, an agricultural centre underpinned by the socio-cultural dynamism of sport and social celebration. Fajã Grande includes several collective groups involved in daily life:
* &quot;Tuna Sol Mar&quot;, created in early 1993, it comprises people with interest in the musical arts, including playing, chorus and folklore traditional of Flores;
* &quot;Filarmónica União Musical Nossa Senhora da Saúde&quot;, instituted in 1950, a philharmonic band comprising 15 elements, whom promote music at local and regional festivities;
* &quot;Casa do Povo de Fajã Grande&quot;, a physical space, the &quot;people&#x27;s house&quot; functions as a local social assistance and hall for meetings and events.

==Notable citizens==
Fajã Grande has, over time, been a cradle for a few personalities, who have become notable in Azorean history, including specifically:
* José António Camões (Fajãzinha; 10 December 1777 — Ponta Delgada, 18 January 1827), a Catholic priest, poet, instructor, historian, and author of various works of satire, including his heroic satire &quot;O Testamento de D. Burro, Pai dos Asnos&quot; (&quot;The Testament of D. Burro, Father of the Asses&quot;), where he skewered Florentine society. Betrayed by the slighted members of the nobility and Roman Catholic clerics, he died a pauper. But, in the 20th century, his prose and incites brought the priest new fame, for his contributions to the local poor and his support for education; 
* José Luís de Fraga, a Roman Catholic priest, noted for his oratory, writings and musical abilities;
* João Joaquim André de Freitas (Fajã Grande, 1860 — Lisbon, 22 June 1929), better known as Senator André de Freitas, he was a politician and benmerit, who began his career as a deputy within the Regenerator Party, and nominated to the post of Civil Governor of the district of Horta in 1908; 
* Pedro Laureano Mendonça da Silveira (Fajã Grande, 5 September 1922 — Lisbon, 2003)), literary critic, historian and poet, with several public works. He was part of the executive board of the magazine &quot;Seara Nova&quot; (until 1974) and author of various works of poetry and literature including the &quot;A Ilha e o Mundo&quot; (1953).

<text>Ghostzapper (foaled April 6, 2000) is a Thoroughbred racehorse who won the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic in 2004, outdistancing Roses in May by three lengths in a track record time of 1:59.02. His gate-to-wire Classic victory completed a 4-for-4 season, which earned him the 2004 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year. He was also ranked &quot;World&#x27;s Top Ranked Horse&quot; for 2004 as compiled by the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings.

Although he only raced eleven times in his career, his performances earned him the highest accolades from horse racing publications. Ghostzapper was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Background==
Ghostzapper was bred in Kentucky by Frank Stronach&#x27;s Adena Springs Farms and raced as a homebred for Stronach Stables. Ghostzapper was sired by Awesome Again, who had won the 1998 Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic for Stronach. Awesome Again became a successful sire, with 61 stakes winners to his credit as of the end of 2015, including Game On Dude, Ginger Punch, Oxbow and Paynter. Ghostzapper&#x27;s dam Baby Zip was a stakeswinner who had earlier produced City Zip, winner of the 2000 Hopeful Stakes.

Ghostzapper is a somewhat plain bay horse whose main distinguishing mark is a diamond shaped star on his forehead. Although a fierce competitor on the racetrack, he was quiet and well mannered at the stable and spent much of his spare time sleeping in his stall. He was trained by Hall of Fame inductee Bobby Frankel. He was widely considered to be one of the most brilliant horses of his era, but his career was plagued by ailments that restricted him to only eleven starts from age two to five.

==Racing career==

Ghostzapper raced only twice at age two, winning his debut at Hollywood Park on November 16, 2002 and then finishing fourth in an allowance race on December 26 at Santa Anita. He did not return to the track until June 20, 2003, when he won an allowance race at Belmont Park. On July 26, he won an allowance race at Saratoga before facing stakes company for the first time in the King&#x27;s Bishop Stakes on August 23. As was then his habit, he raced well behind the early pace before closing rapidly to finish third, just a half-length behind the winner, Valid Video.

Ghostzapper made his next start in the Grade I Vosburgh Stakes on September 27. Despite having no stakes wins to his name, he was the second choice in a field of older horses. After trailing the field early, he unleashed a &quot;devastating&quot; burst of speed and pulled away to win by lengths. &quot;I was really surprised how fast he caught these horses&quot;, said Frankel. &quot;He was 12 (lengths) out of it, and the next thing you know, that&#x27;s him on the outside. I said, `How did he get there so fast?&#x27;&quot; His time for the furlongs was 1:14, just th of a second off the track record.

After Ghostzapper&#x27;s victory in the 2003 Vosburgh, he took time off to recover from quarter cracks and a bruised hoof. His first 2004 start came on July 4 at Belmont Park in the Tom Fool Handicap. This time, he stayed close behind the early leaders and then moved to the lead on the far turn, drawing off to win by lengths. He won the 7-furlong race in 1:20.42, just ths of a second off the track record. &quot;Bobby wanted to give him a rest and have him start fresh&quot;, said regular jockey Javier Castellano. &quot;Bobby didn&#x27;t want me to kill the horse after the layoff. I had to keep him with the pace, but not go too early and overuse him. He ran a big race today.&quot; Ghostzapper earned a Beyer Speed Figure of 120.

Although Ghostzapper was primarily thought of as a sprinter, Frankel believed the horse might be able to handle longer distances. &quot;With the speed he showed, going long you might be able to sit there with him and turn him loose in the stretch&quot;, Frankel said. &quot;Everybody wants to pigeonhole him as a sprinter; we don&#x27;t know. He&#x27;s an easy horse to rate.&quot;

To test Ghostzapper&#x27;s stamina, Frankel entered him in the Philip H. Iselin Breeders&#x27; Cup Handicap at Monmouth Park Racetrack on August 21 over a distance of miles. Over a muddy track, Ghostzapper won the race by 10 lengths in 1:47.66. He earned an astonishing 128 Beyer Speed rating, the highest ever assigned by the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; since they started publishing the numbers in 1992. The &quot;Form&quot; stated categorically, &quot;There can be no argument that Ghostzapper is the fastest horse in the country.&quot; (Before the numbers were published by the DRF, a few higher numbers were assigned by handicapper Andrew Beyer. Groovy, 1987 American Champion Sprint Horse, was the last horse to break the 130 Beyer Speed Figure, earning 133 and 132 in back-to-back 6-furlong races in 1987.)

Ghostzapper&#x27;s next race was the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park on September 11, again at a distance of miles. Saint Liam, ridden by Edgar Prado, set the early pace then dug in during the stretch as Ghostzapper tried to close ground. The two ran stride for stride as Saint Liam drifted away from the rail and bumped several times with Ghostzapper. Ghostzapper persisted and finally got his head in front in the final few strides. &quot;I kept yelling, `Prado, keep your horse straight!&#x27; He bumped my horse a little bit, and my horse went on his wrong lead&quot;, said Castellano. &quot;I love this horse. He&#x27;s got a good, good heart. This is the first time he had to win like this (in a stretch battle) and he showed how good he really is.&quot;

His final race of 2004 was the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic at Lone Star Park, run over a distance of miles. The excellent field included 2002 Horse of the Year Azeri, defending Breeders&#x27; Cup winner Pleasantly Perfect, American Classic winners Funny Cide and Birdstone, and multiple stakes winners Roses in May and Perfect Drift. Pleasantly Perfect went off at almost identical odds to Ghostzapper, with Ghostzapper a slight favorite. There were several factors of concern to the bettors, starting with the fact that Ghostzapper had never run at the distance. Another issue was trainer Bobby Frankel&#x27;s poor record at the Breeders&#x27; Cup despite consistently training some of the best horses in the country. And then there was the fact that Ghostzapper drew post position one and risked getting trapped on the rail in heavy traffic. His exercise rider, Nuno Santos, was not concerned. &quot;Drawing the rail doesn&#x27;t matter, wire-to-wire&quot;, he said a few days before the race. &quot;Believe me, no worries. This horse is unreal, a freak, and everyone is going to see it on Saturday. You&#x27;re going to see a Secretariat type of race. I can feel him getting stronger every day, and I&#x27;ve never been as confident in a horse as I am with this guy, and that includes Azeri. It&#x27;s another world. They&#x27;re going to have to wait years and years to see another one like this.&quot; Frankel concurred. &quot;If I don&#x27;t screw him up and he goes into the Breeders&#x27; Cup as good as he is right now, he can&#x27;t lose&quot;, he said. &quot;It&#x27;ll be no contest; that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m telling you. That&#x27;s how good this horse is.&quot;

However, Frankel was worried that Ghostzapper might get caught in an early speed duel with Roses in May. Ghostzapper would have to break fast to keep from getting trapped on the rail, and Roses in May was the only other horse in the race with the speed to challenge him early. If Roses in May pushed too hard, both horses might burn each other out and set up the race for a late closer. Accordingly, Frankel talked to the owner of Roses in May, Ken Ramsey, and said &quot;If we lay first and second and the jockeys keep them slow and don&#x27;t kill each other trying for the lead, they&#x27;ll finish one-two. You know what I&#x27;m saying? If they&#x27;re not stupid and they stay cool, we&#x27;ll be one-two.&quot; Ramsey agreed with the logic. &quot;That&#x27;s the best shot we got, and if I outrun you or you outrun me, we&#x27;re still talking about $800,000 for second. That&#x27;s nothing to sneeze at&quot;, said Ramsey.

Ghostzapper justified the confidence of his connections and led the entire way, pulling away in the stretch to a three-length victory over Roses in May. The final time of 1:59.02 set a new track record and an unofficial Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic record (because the race is run at different tracks, there is no official record).

Going into the 2004 Breeders&#x27; Cup, Frankel had a lifetime record of only two wins in 57 starts. He had never won the Classic, though he did finish second with Bertrando in 1993 and with Medaglia d&#x27;Oro in 2002 and 2003. In the 2004 Breeders&#x27; Cup, Frankel finished out of the money with his first five starters. &quot;The way this day had been going, I thought I was going to be in for a disaster&quot;, said Frankel. &quot;This sure make things better. This is as big a win as I&#x27;ve had in my career. In fact, it could be the biggest win I&#x27;ve had in my career. This is a good horse, a really good horse.&quot;

Despite winning only four races in 2004, Ghostzapper earned high praise from many handicapping experts. For example, Len Friedman of the &quot;Ragozin Sheets&quot; called him &quot;the most consistently fast horse of all time.&quot; Jerry Brown from &quot;Thoro-Graph&quot; said, &quot;To run as fast as he did in three consecutive races in essentially unheard of.&quot; And Dick Jerardi wrote, &quot;Ghostzapper is officially the fastest horse since &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; began publishing Beyer Speed Figures in 1992.&quot;

Ghostzapper won the 2004 American Horse of the Year title, beating Smarty Jones in votes 174–95. He was also voted the American Champion Older Male Horse. Ghostzapper was also named as the world&#x27;s top ranked racehorse by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) with a rating of 130.

Although Ghostzapper could easily earn millions of dollars a season as a stud, Stronach said he wanted to give something back to the game by returning Ghostzapper to competition in 2005. &quot;I think he is a very exciting horse and I think I owe it to the racing public to run him next year&quot;, he said after the Breeders&#x27; Cup.

Ghostzapper was expected to start his 2005 campaign in the Oaklawn Handicap in April but had to be scratched. &quot;The horse got sick last weekend, and has been running a temperature&quot;, said Frankel. &quot;It&#x27;s a sinus thing. He&#x27;s already missed four days of training, and he&#x27;ll miss a few more. Of course I&#x27;m disappointed we won&#x27;t be coming, but we&#x27;re not about to take any chances with this horse. We will take a step back, and wait for the Met Mile.&quot;

He finally made his 2005 debut on May 30 in the Metropolitan Handicap (more commonly known as the Met Mile) at Belmont Park. After settling into third place in the early running, he moved to the lead on the far turn and pulled away to win by lengths. His time of 1:33.29 was just two-fifths of a second off the stakes record. &quot;I know you dream of winning the Kentucky Derby, but the best dream is to know you have the best horse&quot;, said Frankel. &quot;I&#x27;m very emotional right now. He&#x27;s a great horse, let&#x27;s just put it that way&quot;, Frankel said. &quot;He&#x27;s an amazing horse. He&#x27;s probably the best sprinter in the country, and I think he can win going a mile and a half on the turf – I really do. (Castellano) never moved on him. He just took a hold of him in the stretch.&quot;

==Retirement and stud career==

Ghostzapper was retired from racing on June 13, 2005, after the discovery of a hairline fracture of his left front sesamoid bone. Although he only had one win in 2005, his connections felt it helped solidify Ghostzapper&#x27;s status as one of the all-time greats. &quot;It was worth keeping him in training just for winning that one race&quot;, said Frankel. &quot;He impressed people in the Met more than he did in the Breeders&#x27; Cup, and he ended his career in style.&quot; He retired with career earnings of $3,446,120.

He originally stood at Stronach&#x27;s Adena Springs Farm in Kentucky, with an initial stud fee of $200,000 per live foal, the highest fee ever for a first-time stallion at the time. He did not get off to a fast start when his first foals reached racing age in 2009, and his stud fee started to decline, to $150,000 in 2007, to a low of $20,000 in 2012. In 2013 however, he was represented by sixteen stakes winners and interest in him reignited. In 2015, his fee rebounded to $60,000, thanks to a growing number of stakes winners. In October 2020, Ghostzapper was relocated to Hill &#x27;n&#x27; Dale Farms in Kentucky. In October 2024, John G. Sikura, owner of Hill &#x27;n&#x27; Dale announced that Ghostzapper will reunite with Frank Stronach&#x27;s Adena Springs and will cover a limited book in 2025.
===Notable stock===

&quot;c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding&quot;
In recent years, Ghostzapper has also found success as a broodmare sire. His daughters have produced several graded stakes winners, including 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify,
2016 American Champion Sprint Horse Drefong and multiple stakes winner American Gal. Internationally, Ghostzapper&#x27;s daughter Ghostly Darkness produced colt Levante Lion, winner of the Hakodate Nisai Stakes (JPN G3).

In 2012, Ghostzapper was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

<text>Ernie Parsons (born June 5, 1946) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, representing the riding of Prince Edward—Hastings for the Ontario Liberal Party from 1999 to 2007. In 2007 he was appointed as a Justice of the Peace.

==Background==
Parsons received a Civil Engineering degree from Carleton University in 1969, and was employed by the Ministry of Transportation from 1969 to 1974, and taught Technology courses at Loyalist College from 1974 to 1999. He also worked as a farmer, and was a board member of the &quot;Hastings County Children&#x27;s Aid Society&quot; for twenty-five years and its chair for three. Parsons was a founding member of the &quot;Hastings County Museum of Agricultural Heritage&quot;, and sat on advisory committees to the Kingston Hotel Dieu, the Kingston General Hospital and the Queen&#x27;s University Faculty of Medicine. Parsons served on the school board of the &quot;Hastings—Prince Edward&quot; district from 1982 to 1999.

==Politics==
In the 1999 provincial election he defeated Progressive Conservative incumbent Gary Fox by 56 votes in Prince Edward—Hastings. The Progressive Conservatives won the election, and Parsons spent the next four years in opposition.

The Liberals won the 2003 provincial election, and Parsons was re-elected in Prince Edward—Hastings by over 10,000 votes over Tory John Williams. He was named parliamentary assistant to Ontario Minister of Transportation Harinder Takhar on October 23, 2003, and parliamentary assistant to Sandra Pupatello, the Ontario Minister of Community and Social Services on September 27, 2004. He shared the latter position with Deb Matthews.

Following the death of his adopted son, Sandy, in 2004, Parsons introduced a Private Members Bill, that became known as Sandy&#x27;s Law. The law requires establishments to display a sign warning of the dangers of consuming alcohol while pregnant.

Although Private member&#x27;s bills rarely pass into law, Sandy&#x27;s law received unanimous support and was passed into law later in the year.

On June 30, 2007, Parsons was appointed a Justice of the Peace effective July 12. The appointment has garnered accusations of patronage from the opposition parties. As the appointment occurred within six months of the 2007 provincial election, scheduled for October, there was no by-election to fill the vacancy. Parsons had already announced in late 2006 that he would not run in the 2007 election.

<doc id="1150613" wikidata="Q680916" url="?curid=1150613" title="Gentbrugge">
<text>Gentbrugge (; ) is a sub-municipality of the city of Ghent located in the province of East Flanders, Flemish Region, Belgium. It was a separate municipality until 1977. On 1 January 1977, it was merged into Ghent.

== Neighborhoods ==
The sub-municipality of Gentbrugge itself has been divided in four neighborhoods: Dries, Sportplein, Coninxdonk and the rural area Zwarte Fles with a population of 3417, 3653, 268 and 6 respectively in 2008.

== Demographic facts ==
* Between 1999 and 2008, the population grew by 2,1% as compared to 7,1 for Ghent entirely
* The average age is 9 to 42 years
* The number of non-Belgian inhabitants is with 3,7% lower than the average of Ghent (10,01%)

== Gentbrugse Meersen ==
The Gentbrugse Meersen is a rural area of 270ha surrounded by urbanized Gentbrugge to the West, the Scheldt river in the East, and parted in the middle by the E17 freeway. It is being developed by the City of Ghent to an area for nature development/conservation and recreation.

It is home to the Gentbrugse Meersen Cricket club. In June 2022, it was announced that the venue would host the first two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches in June 2022, between Belgium and Malta.

== Places of interest ==
* Rattendaelepark. A historical park, now for recreational use. From the Castle Vilain named after its first owner Albijn Vilain (1619). Only a tower remains.
* The water tower, visible when entering Ghent by the E17 highway from Antwerp. Originally from 1937 and colorfully repainted in 1990 by the Ghent artist Chris Demangel.
* Gentbrugge used to host the stadium of the Belgian first league football club, KAA Gent, also known as La Gantoise. Now the football club resides over at the Ghelamco Arena in the city of Ghent.
* The St. Eligius Church near the Brusselsesteenweg. Originally neo-gothic from 1884, but expanded in art-deco style in 1937 by the architect W. Vandenbogaerde.
* The castle Coninxdonck, built in the 19th century to replace a medieval castle.
* The Administrative Center. An example of sixties functionalism designed by the Belgian architect Paul Felix in 1973.

== Sports ==
Gentbrugge used to have the stadium (Jules Ottenstadion) of the First Class-team KAA Gent, also known as La Gantoise.
The final tribune of the stadium got demolished in June 2014. Since then, La Gantoise resides at the Ghelamco arena near the U.Z. clinic in Ghent. There are some tennis courts in Gentbrugge of a team which is also called La Gantoise, besides the hockey team.

There&#x27;s also another football team in Ghent, which played its games in the Emanuel Hielstadium. This team was created on 1 April 1899 when the teams Athletic Club Gantois, Sport Pédestre Gantois, and Football Club Gantois merged and became a member of the UBSSA as Racing Club de Gand. In the period before 2010, this team has changed its name after some later developments into KRC-Gent-Zeehaven and it plays its matches in Oostakker. The fields in Gentbrugge have accommodated athletics from 2010 in order to give a suitable training field to the Racing Club Gent for Athletics.

<text>Lajedo is a civil parish in the municipality of Lajes das Flores on the Portuguese island of Flores, in the archipelago of the Azores. The population in 2021 was 75, in an area of approximately .

==History==
Nossa Senhora dos Milagres de Lajedo, was one of the first settlements on the island, camouflaged and protected from North Atlantic pirates by the ridges and rocky outcrops where the settlements began. In fact, its name (&quot;Lajedo&quot;) means &quot;pavement covered in slabs; place where there are many slabs; large slabs and smooth&quot;, indicating the type of geology discovered by first explorers. Its 637 hectares of fertile soils, were explained by Isatis Tinctoria as ideal conditions to shelter and support those who wanted to live in the zone.

This is how João Soares dos Mosteiros, a native of the island of São Miguel, who made shore on the site and decided to stay, colonize and develop the region. Gaspar Frutuoso later wrote:
:&quot;By his hands [he] made, caulked and constructed a boat, without knowing any of these trades, and went with his wife and children to hear mass in the village of Lajes. They said of him, that when he returned home, he asked of his oldest daughter to take the boat up, and she placed it on her head and placed it where she wanted, for it was small and badly made, but served him, for the road was laborious, and many times this João Soares, went to Lajes on this small boat and, at times, fished in it.&quot;
The chronicler also registered the existence of two islets in the seat, land for animal raising and little pastureland to the interior, but that sustained game birds. Along the coast Frutuoso indicated the availability of sheltered anchorages and a freshwater ravine that could support ships by providing potable water. This area, which he referred as &quot;Lajedos&quot;, because the &quot;land is flatten and cliffs little high, that provide bread and woad&quot;.

Father José António Camões writing in 1815 described the region in these terms: 
:&quot;...there is a fajã called Costa, that has many vineyards, many fruit orchards, much like the rest of the island...within the islet Cartario, there is another smaller, and within this a cove called Portinho do Lajedo, where there wades small boats, but only with a lot of calm...[the hermitage of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres]...to which many devotees concur, it is more probable, that their devotion consists without exception in carrying their violins, and playing and dancing with the girls, etc.&quot;

The parish of Lajedo was created by regal charter at the end of 1823, even though a parish had already existed since 1781, under the invocation of Nossa Senhora dos Milagres. This temple was reconstructed in 1868, under the supervision of the parish priest, Father Francisco Luís de Freitas Henriques. The new parish was delimited by the &quot;Ribeira da Lapa&quot;, Rebentão and Rocha Alta, and the Rector assigned a priest for &quot;four moios and 501 bushels of wheat and 8000 réis in money and a Treasurer for 1 moio of wheat and 3000 réis, that included hosts and wine, to be paid for by the island treasury&quot;.

Lajedo depended, administratively, on the municipality of Santa Cruz between 1895 and 1898, during the suppression of Lajes das Flores, when only one municipality existed on the island.

Electricity arrived to the region late, only on 4 February 1978, where until then work at night was done by whale oil lamps, kerosene or fire light. Pierluigi Bragaglia, an Italian who lived in Lajes, wrote of a curious episode associated with the agricultural cooperative &quot;Ilha das Flores&quot;, whose seat was in Lajedo, and ultimately powered the local economy and provided electricity.

:&quot;It was this last parish of Flores that abandoned the old lamps and whale oil, whose director of the Cooperative, José de Freitas Escobar Júnior, installed, with several years in advance, a turbine in a ravine below the village, and with a system of wires he could turn on the light of his office...to do his accounts, an early night...by means of a simple interruptor; almost a miracle for other parishes.&quot;

José de Freitas Escobar Júnior, was one of the more important figures in the Azores, owing to his management and directorship of the Cooperative Ilha das Flores, for 40 years. Native of Flores, he had emigrated to the United States and later to Brazil, before returning some years later when his brother was gravely ill. He decided to remain, because he felt he could contribute to Lajedo; the fact that he had engineered electrical light thirty years before the electrification of the parish, already made him a popular figure. The system was complex, but its functioning demonstrated the authors capacity: he was made president of the municipal council of Lajes between 1944 and 1946 and, once again in 1948. He died in 1986, at the age of 84, in the parish of Mosteiro.

==Geography==
Situated in the extreme southern portion of the island of Flores, Lajedo is located from the seat of the municipality (Lajes) and from the regional airport in Santa Cruz das Flores. The parish consists of several smaller communities and localities, including specifically the villages of Campanário and Costa, an area that is primarily marked by fertile pasturelands supported by the ravines of Campanário and Lapa, that cross the territory.

<text>Tinel&#x27;s sign (also Hoffmann-Tinel sign) is a way to detect irritated nerves. It is performed by lightly tapping (percussing) over the nerve to elicit a sensation of tingling or &quot;pins and needles&quot; in the distribution of the nerve. Percussion is usually performed moving distal to proximal. It is named after Jules Tinel.

It is a potential sign of carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome and symptomatic neuroma.

== History ==
Tinel&#x27;s sign takes its name from French neurologist Jules Tinel (1879–1952), who wrote about it in a journal article published in October 1915. German neurologist Paul Hoffmann independently also published an article on tinel sign six months earlier, in March 1915. Previously, in 1909, Trotter and Davies published their findings that sensations elicited distal to the point of nerve resection are referred to the area or point of nerve resection; however they &quot;failed to comment on the clinical relevance of their observation.&quot;

<doc id="1150634" wikidata="Q463927" url="?curid=1150634" title="Diner (1982 film)">
<text>Diner is a 1982 American comedy-drama film written and directed by Barry Levinson. It is Levinson&#x27;s screen-directing debut and the first of his &quot;Baltimore Films&quot; tetralogy, set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s; the other three films are &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990), and &quot;Liberty Heights&quot; (1999). It stars Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Paul Reiser, Kevin Bacon, Timothy Daly and Ellen Barkin and was released on March 5, 1982. The movie follows a close-knit circle of friends who reunite at a Baltimore diner when one of them prepares to get married.

==Plot==
In 1959 Baltimore, friends Modell, Eddie, Shrevie, Boogie, and Fenwick attend a Christmas dance before driving to their usual late-night haunt, Fell&#x27;s Point Diner. On the way, Fenwick stages a fake car accident, to his friends&#x27; annoyance. Boogie, a hairdresser and law student, has laid a $2,000 bet on a basketball game, and declines his family friend Bagel&#x27;s offer to call off the bet. Modell accepts a ride home from Eddie while the others pick up another friend, Billy, in town to serve as Eddie&#x27;s best man for his New Year&#x27;s Eve wedding.

The next morning, Billy reunites with Eddie at his mother&#x27;s house, and they visit their old pool hall. Shrevie, married to Beth and working as an appliance store salesman, learns from Fenwick that Boogie is taking a date to the movies. At a screening of &quot;A Summer Place&quot;, with his friends watching, Boogie tricks his date, Carol, into groping him through the popcorn carton on his lap. She runs from the theater in tears, but the smooth-talking Boogie convinces her it was an accident and their date continues; afterward, Billy punches an old high school enemy.

Billy visits Barbara, a friend working at the local TV station. At the diner, Shrevie discusses married life with Eddie, who is preparing a test of football knowledge for his fiancée Elyse, to determine if they will marry. Having lost his basketball bet, Boogie wagers with his friends that he can have sex with Carol. The group parts ways in the morning, and Boogie and Fenwick encounter an equestrienne named Jane. Meeting Barbara at church, Billy learns she is pregnant, the result of an unexpected night they spent together; she tries to dissuade him from feeling obligated to marry her.

Watching &quot;College Bowl&quot;, Fenwick is surprisingly knowledgeable and offers to help pay Boogie&#x27;s debt. Shrevie loses his temper at Beth for disturbing his record collection, and storms out. Boogie consoles her, and Fenwick goes to ask his brother for money, but he refuses. Shrevie pulls Eddie and Billy from a screening of &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; to corral Fenwick, who has drunkenly occupied the church&#x27;s Nativity scene in his underwear, leading to their arrest.

In the holding cells, Eddie reveals that Elyse is taking his test the following night, and Billy faces down a belligerent drunk. Eddie, Shrevie, and Billy are bailed out by their fathers, but Fenwick&#x27;s leaves him overnight. They meet Boogie at the diner, and he deduces Eddie is still a virgin, while Billy and Barbara discuss their predicament at the TV station. A lonely Beth visits Boogie at the hair salon, and he is threatened by his bookie, Tank. Learning Carol has the flu, which jeopardizes his bet, Boogie reminisces with Beth about their own past relationship, and they make plans for a tryst while everyone is busy with Elyse&#x27;s test.

Shrevie, Fenwick, Billy, and Modell, along with Eddie&#x27;s and Elyse&#x27;s parents, await the results of the football test: Elyse fails by two points, and Eddie calls off the wedding. Boogie brings Beth a wig, secretly planning to disguise her as Carol to win the bet, and drives her to Fenwick&#x27;s apartment. There, Fenwick and Shrevie hide in the closet to verify the encounter, but Boogie tells Beth the truth, urging her to work things out with Shrevie. Eddie and Billy visit a strip club, and Boogie arrives at the diner, where Shrevie and Fenwick warn him Tank is waiting. Boogie is ready to accept the consequences, but Tank reveals that Bagel has paid off the debt.

Billy commandeers a piano to lead the entire strip club in a rousing number, to Eddie&#x27;s delight. There, Eddie decides to marry Elyse after all, and Billy assures Barbara he genuinely loves her. The wedding proceeds, themed around Eddie&#x27;s beloved Baltimore Colts: Shrevie and Beth reconcile; Boogie, Billy, and Fenwick bring Jane, Barbara, and Diane; and Modell delivers a heartfelt speech. The movie ends as Elyse—whose face is never seen throughout the movie—tosses the bouquet, which lands on the friends&#x27; table.

==Cast==

==Production==
The film captures the changing relationships among a group of friends as they become adults largely through a series of vignettes, as opposed to a traditional narrative. Levinson encouraged improvisation among his cast to capture realistic camaraderie.

During post-production, MGM executive David Chasman wanted to cut the scene about an unfinished roast-beef sandwich because it did not advance the story, but Levinson explained that the scene told audiences all they needed to know about the young men&#x27;s friendship, their competitiveness, and their fears.

Test screening reactions of the film were poor, prompting uncertainty from MGM over whether to release the film. Attempting to get positive publicity for the film, executive producer Mark Johnson obtained a print without MGM&#x27;s knowledge and screened it privately for Pauline Kael, whom his mother knew personally, as well as fellow critic James Wolcott. Kael called MGM executives and made it clear she was going to write a rave review even if MGM did not release the film, and that other critics planned to do the same.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on reviews from 46 critics. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;&quot;Diner&quot; transports audiences back to the 1950s with a refreshing lack of sentimentality, evoking the thrill of everyday life with its ensemble&#x27;s potent chemistry and an authentic sense of spontaneity.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 82 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called it &quot;A wonderful movie…It isn&#x27;t remarkable visually, but features some of the best young actors in the country.&quot; Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, writing: &quot;&quot;Diner&quot; is often a very funny movie, although I laughed most freely not at the sexual pranks but at the movie&#x27;s accurate ear, as it reproduced dialogue with great comic accuracy.&quot;
&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Steve Guttenberg, Daniel Stern, Mickey Rourke, Kevin Bacon, Paul Reiser and Timothy Daly are terrific as the friends as are Ellen Barkin and Kathryn Dowling as the two females involved with different group members.&quot;
Author Nick Hornby called the film &quot;a work of great genius.&quot; John Wells, executive producer for the TV series &quot;E.R.&quot;, estimated he saw the film thirty times in 1982 alone, and he makes a point to watch the film every year.

===Accolades===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years…100 Laughs – #57

==Adaptations==
The film inspired a 1983 television pilot written and directed by Levinson. Mike Binder starred as Eddie, Paul Reiser returned as Modell, Michael Madsen took over as Boogie and James Spader was Fenwick.

===Stage adaptation===
A stage musical, with the book by Levinson and music by Sheryl Crow originally opened in Autumn 2013. Kathleen Marshall was the director and choreographer. A &quot;creative workshop&quot; reading was held in December 2011, directed by Kathleen Marshall. The musical opened at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia in December 2014 through January 2015, with direction and choreography by Kathleen Marshall. Crow said: &quot;And to think we are going to premiere it so close to Baltimore, where the story took place, at Signature Theatre, which has birthed so many new musicals, well, I couldn&#x27;t be happier.&quot; The cast for the Signature premiere included Matthew James Thomas as Fenwick and Derek Klena as Boogie. The musical was presented at the Delaware Theatre Company in Wilmington, Delaware from December 2, 2015 (previews) through December 27, with Matthew James Thomas as Fenwick, Derek Klena as Boogie, Noah Weisberg as Shrevie and Brynn O’Malley as Barbara.

<text>Baclofen, sold under the brand name Lioresal among others, is a medication used to treat muscle spasticity, such as from a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis. It may also be used for hiccups and muscle spasms near the end of life, and off-label to treat alcohol use disorder or opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is taken orally or by intrathecal pump (delivered into the spinal canal via an implantable pump device). It is sometimes used transdermally (applied topically to the skin) in combination with gabapentin and clonidine prepared at a compounding pharmacy. It is believed to work by decreasing levels of certain neurotransmitters.
Common side effects include sleepiness, weakness, and dizziness. Serious side effects, such as seizures and rhabdomyolysis, may occur if use of baclofen is stopped abruptly. Use during pregnancy is of unclear safety, whilst use during breastfeeding is likely safe, and even more so if oral administration is avoided. 

The adverse effects and safety profile associated with baclofen when it is combined with sedative drugs (for example alcohol or benzodiazepines) range depending on the dose and the individual. The interaction may increase the sedative effects of all ingested sedatives and as such is not generally recommended. In high doses the interaction can cause de novo seizures.
Baclofen was approved for medical use in the United States in 1977. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 104th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==

Baclofen is primarily used for the treatment of spastic movement disorders, especially in instances of spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis. Use in people with stroke, cerebral palsy, or Parkinson&#x27;s disease is not recommended. Intrathecal baclofen is used for severe spasticity of spinal cord origin, that is refractive to maximum doses of oral antispasmodic agents, or who experience intolerable side effects.

Baclofen may be used off-label as a treatment for alcohol use disorder to reduce the risk of relapse, and to increase the number of days that a person can go without drinking alcohol (abstinence days).

It is sometimes used for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and may be superior for this purpose to the more-commonly used clonidine.

Baclofen is also used in the treatment of sleep-related painful erections.

==Adverse effects==
Adverse effects include drowsiness, dizziness, weakness, fatigue, headache, trouble sleeping, nausea and vomiting, poor concentration and recall (resembling dementia), urinary retention, or constipation.

===Withdrawal syndrome===
Discontinuation of baclofen can be associated with a withdrawal syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine withdrawal and alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms are more likely if baclofen is administered intrathecally or for long periods of time (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen withdrawal depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise withdrawal symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt withdrawal is more likely to result in severe withdrawal symptoms. Acute withdrawal symptoms can be eased or completely reversed by re-initiating therapy with baclofen.

Withdrawal symptoms may include auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, tactile hallucinations, delusions, confusion, agitation, delirium, disorientation, fluctuation of consciousness, insomnia, dizziness, nausea, inattention, memory impairments, perceptual disturbances, itching, anxiety, depersonalization, hypertonia, hyperthermia (higher than normal temperature without infection), formal thought disorder, psychosis, mania, mood disturbances, restlessness, and behavioral disturbances, tachycardia, seizures, tremors, autonomic dysfunction, hyperpyrexia (fever), extreme muscle rigidity resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rebound spasticity.

===Abuse===
Baclofen, at standard dosing, does not appear to possess addictive properties, and has not been associated with any degree of drug craving. Euphoria is however listed as a common to very common side-effect of baclofen in the BNF 75. There are very few cases of abuse of baclofen for reasons other than attempted suicide. In contrast to baclofen, another GABAB receptor agonist, γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), has been associated with euphoria, abuse, and addiction. These effects are likely mediated not by activation of the GABAB receptor, but rather by activation of the GHB receptor. Baclofen possesses both sedative and anxiolytic properties.

==Overdose==
Reports of overdose indicate that baclofen may cause symptoms including vomiting, general weakness, sedation, respiratory insufficiency, seizures, dizziness, headaches, itching, hypothermia, bradycardia, cardiac conduction abnormalities, hypertension, hyporeflexia and coma sometimes mimicking brain death. Overdose may require intubation and length of mechanical ventilation required may correlate with serum baclofen levels shortly after ingestion. Symptoms may persist even after the point at which serum baclofen levels are undetectable.

==Pharmacology==
Chemically, baclofen is a derivative of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is believed to work by activating (or agonizing) GABA receptors, specifically the GABAB receptors.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Baclofen produces its effects by selectively activating the GABAB receptor. Baclofen is postulated to block mono-and-polysynaptic reflexes by acting as an inhibitory ligand, inhibiting the release of excitatory neurotransmitters. Baclofen does not have significant affinity for the GHB receptor, and has no known abuse potential. Agonism of GABAB receptors is thought to be responsible for baclofen&#x27;s range of therapeutic properties, as GABAB knockout mice are unresponsive to the neurobiological effects of baclofen.

Similarly to phenibut (β-phenyl-GABA), as well as pregabalin (β-isobutyl-GABA), which are close analogues of baclofen, baclofen (β-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA) has been found to block α2δ subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). However, it is weaker relative to phenibut in this action (Ki = 23 and 39 μM for &quot;R&quot;- and &quot;S&quot;-phenibut and 156 μM for baclofen). Moreover, baclofen is in the range of 100-fold more potent by weight as an agonist of the GABAB receptor in comparison to phenibut, and in accordance, is used at far lower relative dosages. As such, the actions of baclofen on α2δ subunit-containing VGCCs are likely not clinically relevant.

For drug-reward and addiction, baclofen&#x27;s mechanism of action is thought to be through its effect on the mesolimbic dopamine pathway, specifically leading to a decrease in dopamine release associated with alcohol. GABAB receptor activation (GABAB receptor agonist activity) may decrease or inhibit alcohol&#x27;s ability to activate or fire dopaminergic neurons following exposure to alcohol. Baclofen&#x27;s mechanism of action when used to treat alcohol use disorder is not thought to be mediated through its muscle-relaxing or sedative properties, however there is evidence to suggest that the GABAB receptor-activation in the limbus may also reduce feelings of anxiety in people with alcohol use disorder.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The drug is rapidly absorbed after oral administration and is widely distributed throughout the body. Biotransformation is low: the drug is predominantly excreted unchanged by the kidneys. The serum half-life of baclofen is roughly 2–4 hours; however, one source gives a half-life of 6.8 hr, using a more complex calculation combining urinary and serum data. It therefore needs to be administered frequently throughout the day to control spasticity appropriately.

==Chemistry==
Baclofen is a white (or off-white) mostly odorless crystalline powder, with a molecular weight of 213.66 g/mol. It is slightly soluble in water, very slightly soluble in methanol, and insoluble in chloroform.

==History==
Historically, baclofen was designed as a drug for treating epilepsy. It was first synthesized at Ciba-Geigy by the Swiss chemist Heinrich Keberle in 1962. Its effect on epilepsy was ineffective, but it was found that in certain people, spasticity decreased. In 1971, it was introduced as a treatment for certain form of spasticity. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1977.

Intrathecal baclofen was first introduced in 1984 to treat severe spinal spasticity. This administration route aimed to avoid supraspinal side effects.

In his 2008 book, &quot;Le Dernier Verre&quot; (translated literally as &quot;The Last Glass&quot; or &quot;The End of My Addiction&quot;), French-American cardiologist Olivier Ameisen described how he treated his alcoholism with baclofen. Inspired by this book, an anonymous donor gave $750,000 to the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands to initiate a clinical trial of high-dose baclofen, which Ameisen had called for since 2004. The researchers concluded, &quot;In summary, the current study did not find evidence of a positive effect of either low or high doses of baclofen in AD patients. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that baclofen is an effective medication for the treatment of severe, heavy drinking AD patients not responding to or not accepting routine psychosocial interventions.&quot;

==Society and culture==

===Routes of administration===
Baclofen can be administered, orally, intrathecally (directly into the cerebral spinal fluid) using a pump implanted under the skin, or transdermally as part of a pain-relieving and muscle-relaxing topical cream mix (also containing gabapentin and clonidine) prepared at a compounding pharmacy.

Intrathecal pumps offer much lower doses of baclofen because they are designed to deliver the medication directly to the spinal fluid rather than going through the digestive and blood system first. A drug concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid more than 10 times greater than when given orally is achieved with this route. At the same time the blood concentration levels are almost undetectable, thus minimizing side effects.

Besides those with spasticity, intrathecal administration is also used in patients with cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis who have severe painful spasms which are not controllable by oral baclofen. With pump administration, a test dose is first injected into the spinal fluid to assess the effect, and if successful in relieving spasticity, a chronic intrathecal catheter is inserted from the spine through the abdomen and attached to the pump which is implanted under the abdomen&#x27;s skin, usually by the ribcage. The pump is computer-controlled for automatic dosage and its reservoir can be replenished by percutaneous injection. The pump also has to be replaced every five to seven years or so.

===Other names===
Other names include: Fleqsuvy, Gablofen, Kemstro, Lioresal, Lyvispah, Ozobax.

==Research==
Baclofen is being studied for the treatment of alcoholism. Evidence as of 2019 is not conclusive enough to recommend its use for this purpose. In 2014, the French drug agency ANSM issued a three-year temporary recommendation allowing the use of baclofen in alcoholism. In 2018, baclofen received a Marketing Authorization for use in alcoholism treatment from the agency if all other treatments are not effective.

It is being studied along with naltrexone and sorbitol for Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT), a hereditary disease that causes peripheral neuropathy. It is also being studied for cocaine addiction. Baclofen and other muscle relaxants are being studied for potential use for persistent hiccups.

From 2014 to 2017 baclofen misuse, toxicity and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased.

<text>Sochaux () is a commune in the Doubs department in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in eastern France.

==Geography==
Sochaux lies east of Montbéliard, and southeast of Paris.

==Population==

Inhabitants are known as &quot;Sochaliens&quot;.
==Economy==
Sochaux is the site of a large industrial facility of the French auto manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroën. As of late 2005, about 16,000 people are employed there. The town also contains the Peugeot automobile museum. Peugeot&#x27;s badge, the lion rampant, is derived from the town&#x27;s coat-of-arms.

==Second World War==
After the fall of France, the Peugeot factory was converted to produce tanks for Germany, and later, parts for the V1 buzz bomb.

&quot;On 15/16 July 1943, the R.A.F. sent 165 Halifax bombers to attack the Peugeot motor factory; five were lost. 750 tons of high explosive were dropped. The outcome of this raid illustrated again the difficulties of hitting relatively small targets in the occupied countries and the danger to surrounding civilians. The night was clear, the target was only lightly defended and the attack altitude was 6,000 to 10,000 ft, but the centre of the group of markers dropped by the Pathfinder crews of 35 Squadron was 700 yards beyond the factory. The factory was classed as 5 per cent damaged; the production was normal immediately after the raid.&quot; 125 residents were killed and 260 were seriously injured. Over 100 houses were destroyed, and 400 more were badly damaged. When this news reached London, the R.A.F. prepared to send another raid.

However, a British S.O.E. agent, Harry Ree, telephoned the owner, Rodolphe Peugeot, and explained that sabotage would be far more effective, and would leave the structures undamaged.
The owner gave his whole-hearted support. On the night of 3 November, the chief electrician, Pierre Lucas, and the foreman, Andre van der Straaten, and three other workers, having hidden explosives in the factory, went to lay the charges. They were intercepted by some German guards who were kicking a football around, and were challenged to a France vs Germany football match, during which a limpet mine fell from the pocket of a saboteur. A German called out, &quot;You have dropped something&quot;, and the saboteur quickly picked it up. But the game went on too long, so the attack was postponed for two nights, and was carried out appropriately on Guy Fawkes&#x27; Night. The factory was out of commission for six months.

==Sport==
The FC Sochaux-Montbéliard football club is located in the town, and currently plays in Ligue 2. On 13 May 2007, FCSM defeated Olympique de Marseille to win the Coupe de France for the first time since 1937.

<text>Super Express is a Polish tabloid published in Warsaw with daily circulation of about 370,000.

==History and profile==
&quot;Super Express&quot; was established in 1991. The paper, owned and published by the Media Express, is best known for publications about political scandals. The former owners of the paper were Bonnier and ZPR Express, each held 50%.

Before the 1993 and 1995 elections in Poland &quot;Super Express&quot; published pre-election polls, although there&#x27;s a 24-hour time period without media information about politics. The paper published also photos of Polish Television (TVP) war-correspondent Waldemar Milewicz&#x27;s body after he was killed by the Iraqi insurgents.

For the first decade of its operation (until 2003) &quot;Super Express&quot; ranked as second in Poland in terms of the quality of information and sale results, behind the leading &quot;Gazeta Wyborcza&quot;. The editorial profile of SE changed for a few years to a more competitive format after the introduction of &quot;Fakt&quot; published by German conglomerate Axel Springer AG, which became the most popular Polish daily. Since 2007, with the new editor-in-chief formerly from &quot;Fact&quot;, &quot;Super Express&quot; adjusted its profile to become (similar to &quot;Fact&quot;) &quot;a noble version of the tabloid daily&quot; with a wide range of readership.

The newspaper came under criticism from the Bundestag, the German parliament after publishing a photo-montage picturing Poland national football team coach Leo Beenhakker carrying the severed heads of Germany national football team head coach Joachim Löw and captain Michael Ballack in the buildup of their UEFA Euro 2008 Group B opener against the Germans in Klagenfurt (Austria). Peter Danckert, head of the Bundestag&#x27;s sport committee, called upon the Sejm, the Polish parliament, to take appropriate action on &quot;Super Express&quot;, labelling the issue a scandal. Beenhakker has since distanced himself from the image, calling the people who put together the spread named &quot;bring us their heads&quot; &quot;sick&quot;.

&quot;Super Express&quot; had a circulation of 386,000 copies during the first three quarters of 1998. The circulation of the paper was 353,882 copies between January and February 2001.

==American editions==
Since 15 April 1996 an edition of &quot;Super Express&quot; has been published for Polish-Americans; the first time that any publication from Poland issued its own separate version overseas. Its main editor since 2008 has been Adam Michejda, who had earlier served as an associate editor in Poland. Its New York offices are located in Manhattan, on John Street in the vicinity of the World Trade Center. A Chicago version has also been issued since September 2010. The publisher of both publications is Super Express USA and its president is Beata Pierzchała.

<text>Cuckmere Valley is a civil parish in the Wealden District of East Sussex, England. As its name suggests, the parish consists of a number of small settlements in the lower reaches of the River Cuckmere.

==The settlements==
There are three villages in the Cuckmere Valley: Litlington, Lullington and Westdean. Archaeological remains nearer the coast at Exceat suggest a further settlement there in former times.

The civil parish of Cuckmere Valley was created in 1990 when Litlington, Lullington and Westdean parishes were abolished, with small areas transferred between Litlington and Alfriston, which remained a separate civil parish.

===Litlington===

The name is Saxon, and probably indicates Litl&#x27;s homestead. The twelfth- century church is dedicated to St Michael the Archangel.

Maria Fitzherbert (1756–1837), mistress of George IV, lived at Clapham House in the village.

In 1924 a chalk figure of a horse was cut into the downs to the west of the village, replacing one cut in the 19th century.
The village inn is the Plough and Harrow.

===Lullington===
Lullington is the most northerly of the three, about southeast of Lewes. It lies on a shoulder of the South Downs at the point where the River Cuckmere cuts through the downs, on the opposite bank of the river to Alfriston. A medieval village, Lullington Court, was abandoned after the Black Death in the 14th century; its site was to the east of the present Lullington. The church, dedicated to the Good Shepherd, is believed to be the smallest in England, having been rebuilt using only the original chancel after a fire had destroyed the remainder of the building. Services are held only in the summer months, as the building has no electricity.

===Exceat===
Exceat ( ) was an ancient village. The A259 goes by it just east of the River Cuckmere. The name may have come from &quot;æc-sceat&quot;, an oak grove, or from the Old English for &quot;the place of the Aese&quot;, early kings of Kent whilst another etymology is possible from Brittonic &quot;wysg&quot; meaning water or river (or possibly &quot;&quot;esgair&quot; meaning ridge) and &quot;ceat&quot; meaning woods, hence &quot;Wooded River&quot; or &quot;Wooded Ridge&quot;. After the Norman conquest, the village was given to Robert, Count of Mortain, half brother of William the Conqueror. Both Exceat and the land were given later to &quot;Grestein Priory&quot; in Wilmington.

Until the 14th century, Exceat was an important village with its own church. The village suffered French raids; it suffered many fatalities during the Black Death, as was effectively abandoned by the 15th century.

The main features are the Visitors Centre for the nearby Seven Sisters and the Cuckmere Inn Public House across Exceat Bridge over the Cuckmere.

===West Dean===

West Dean (or Westdean) is a hamlet located on the edge of Friston Forest. Its church is dedicated to All Saints and has Saxon origins (a Saxon era window is in the north wall). Next door to the church is &quot;The Old Parsonage&quot;, a medieval flint and stone home. It was built by Benedictine monks in 1280 and continuously occupied since that period although the clergy vacated in the 1970s and it is now a private home. Opposite the church is the remains of the Norman era manor, although a Norman era dovecote is well maintained. The South Downs Way walking trail passes through the hamlet.

==Landmarks==
The National Trust owns land on the western side of the river south of the A259.

In addition, there are three Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish; Seaford to Beachy Head, Wilmington Downs and Lullington Heath. Seaford to Beachy Head is a large site of biological and geological importance. The area contains a wide variety of habitats based on the chalk bedrock, which hosts a wide range of flora and fauna, including some nationally rare species. Wilmington Downs is another area of biological interest; its chalk grassland is habitat for several rare species. Lullington Heath is also of biological interest due to its chalk heath and grassland habitats.

<doc id="1150664" wikidata="Q205376" url="?curid=1150664" title="Zionites (Germany)">
<text>The Zionites were a religious sect in the eighteenth century at Ronsdorf (Duchy of Berg, Germany).

==History==

===Elberfeld===
The sect was created by members of the Philadelphian Society, who were a group of Christian dissenters and mystics based in England.

The Zionites were founded at Elberfeld in Wuppertal, Germany in 1726 by Elias Eller and the pastor Daniel Schleiermacher.

Eller was the foreman of a factory owned by his wife, a rich widow. He had read the writings of ancient and modern visionaries and then formed an apocalyptic, millenarian system of his own. Schleiermacher, grandfather of the celebrated theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher, was also influenced by Eller.

The group had a prophetess named Anna Catharina vom Büchel, who was a baker&#x27;s daughter. Vom Büchel had &quot;dreams and visions, and saw apparitions&quot;. After the death of Eller&#x27;s wife, vom Büchel and Eller became a married couple. The newlyweds were known as &quot;the mother and father of Zion&quot; and prophesied that Anna would bear the male saviour of the world. The couple&#x27;s first child was a daughter, but Eller was able to console the society with Scriptural texts. A son was conceived in 1733, but passed away two years later.

The theology became centralised around Eller, and the &quot;Christian morality&quot; which the Zionites were founded upon was replaced by the craving for coarse and sensual pleasures.

===Ronsdorf===
In 1737, the sect left Elberfeld and founded the settlement of Ronsdorf which soon prospered. Through Eller&#x27;s influence, Ronsdorf was raised by the State in 1745 to the rank of a city. Eller then received the office of burgomaster and lived in prosperity, reported as a &#x27;tyrannical ruler&#x27;.

When Anna passed away unexpectedly in 1744, doubts arose in the mind of Schleiermacher, who was pastor at Ronsdorf. He confessed his mistake and sought to change Eller&#x27;s mind, but Eller managed to maintain himself until death.

Schleiermacher left the group and moved to the Netherlands. The sect was carried on by the pastors who took Schleiermacher&#x27;s place, including Eller&#x27;s stepson, Blockhaus. A new pastor was chosen in 1768 and he and his successors brought the inhabitants of Ronsdorf back to Protestantism. The after-effects of the movement could be traced into the nineteenth century.

<doc id="1150680" wikidata="Q5552256" url="?curid=1150680" title="Germline mutation">
<text>A germline mutation, or germinal mutation, is any detectable variation within germ cells (cells that, when fully developed, become sperm and ova). Mutations in these cells are the only mutations that can be passed on to offspring, when either a mutated sperm or oocyte come together to form a zygote. After this fertilization event occurs, germ cells divide rapidly to produce all of the cells in the body, causing this mutation to be present in every somatic and germline cell in the offspring; this is also known as a constitutional mutation. Germline mutation is distinct from somatic mutation.

Germline mutations can be caused by a variety of endogenous (internal) and exogenous (external) factors, and can occur throughout zygote development. A mutation that arises only in germ cells can result in offspring with a genetic condition that is not present in either parent; this is because the mutation is not present in the rest of the parents&#x27; body, only the germline.

== When mutagenesis occurs ==
Germline mutations can occur before fertilization and during various stages of zygote development. When the mutation arises will determine the effect it has on offspring. If the mutation arises in either the sperm or the oocyte before development, then the mutation will be present in every cell in the individual&#x27;s body. A mutation that arises soon after fertilization, but before germline and somatic cells are determined, then the mutation will be present in a large proportion of the individual&#x27;s cell with no bias towards germline or somatic cells, this is also called a gonosomal mutation. A mutation that arises later in zygote development will be present in a small subset of either somatic or germline cells, but not both.

== Causes ==

=== Endogenous factors ===
A germline mutation often arises due to endogenous factors, like errors in cellular replication and oxidative damage. This damage is rarely repaired imperfectly, but due to the high rate of germ cell division, can occur frequently.

Endogenous mutations are more prominent in sperm than in ova. This is because spermatocytes go through a larger number of cell divisions throughout a male&#x27;s life, resulting in more replication cycles that could result in a DNA mutation. Errors in maternal ovum also occur, but at a lower rate than in paternal sperm. The types of mutations that occur also tend to vary between the sexes. A mother&#x27;s eggs, after production, remain in stasis until each is utilized in ovulation. This long stasis period has been shown to result in a higher number of chromosomal and large sequence deletions, duplications, insertions, and transversions. The father&#x27;s sperm, on the other hand, undergoes continuous replication throughout his lifetime, resulting in many small point mutations that result from errors in replication. These mutations commonly include single base pair substitutions, deletions, and insertions.

Oxidative damage is another endogenous factor that can cause germline mutations. This type of damage is caused by reactive oxygen species that build up in the cell as a by-product of cellular respiration. These reactive oxygen species are missing an electron, and because they are highly electronegative (have a strong electron pull) they will rip an electron away from another molecule. This can initiate DNA damage because it causes the nucleic acid guanine to shift to 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). This 8-oxoG molecule is then mistaken for a thymine by DNA polymerase during replication, causing a G&gt;T transversion on one DNA strand, and a C&gt;A transversion on the other.

===Male germline===

In mice and humans the spontaneous mutation rate in the male germ line is significantly lower than in somatic cells. Furthermore, although the spontaneous mutation rate in the male germ line increases with age, the rate of increase is lower than in somatic tissues. Within the testicular spermatogonial stem cell population the integrity of DNA appears to be maintained by highly effective DNA damage surveillance and protective DNA repair processes. The progressive increase in the mutation rate with age in the male germ line may be a result of a decline in the accuracy of the repair of DNA damages, or of an increase in DNA replication errors. Once spermatogenesis is complete, the differentiated spermatozoa that are formed no longer have the capability for DNA repair, and are thus vulnerable to attack by prevalent oxidative free radicals that cause oxidative DNA damage. Such damaged spermatozoa may undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis).

=== Exogenous factors ===
A germline mutation can also occur due to exogenous factors. Similar to somatic mutations, germline mutations can be caused by exposure to harmful substances, which damage the DNA of germ cells. This damage can then either be repaired perfectly, and no mutations will be present, or repaired imperfectly, resulting in a variety of mutations. Exogenous mutagens include harmful chemicals and ionizing radiation; the major difference between germline mutations and somatic mutations is that germ cells are not exposed to UV radiation, and thus not often directly mutated in this manner.

== Clinical implications ==
Different germline mutations can affect an individual differently depending on the rest of their genome. A dominant mutation only requires a single mutated gene to produce the disease phenotype, while a recessive mutation requires both alleles to be mutated to produce the disease phenotype. For example, if the embryo inherits an already mutated allele from the father, and the same allele from the mother underwent an endogenous mutation, then the child will display the disease related to that mutated gene, even though only one parent carries the mutant allele. This is only one example of how a child can display a recessive disease while a mutant gene is only carried by one parent. Detection of chromosomal abnormalities can be found in utero for certain diseases by means of blood samples or ultrasound, as well as invasive procedures such as an amniocentesis. Later detection can be found by genome screening.

=== Cancer ===
Mutations in tumour suppressor genes or proto-oncogenes can predispose an individual to developing tumors. It is estimated that inherited genetic mutations are involved in 5-10% of cancers. These mutations make a person susceptible to tumor development if the other copy of the oncogene is randomly mutated. These mutations can occur in germ cells, allowing them to be heritable. Individuals who inherit germline mutations in TP53 are predisposed to certain cancer variants because the protein produced by this gene suppresses tumors. Patients with this mutation are also at a risk for Li–Fraumeni syndrome. Other examples include mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes which predispose to breast and ovarian cancer, or mutations in MLH1 which predispose to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer.

=== Huntington&#x27;s disease ===
Huntington&#x27;s disease is an autosomal dominant mutation in the HTT gene. The disorder causes degradation in the brain, resulting in uncontrollable movements and behavior. The mutation involves an expansion of repeats in the Huntington protein, causing it to increase in size. Patients who have more than 40 repeats will most likely be affected. The onset of the disease is determined by the amount of repeats present in the mutation; the greater the number of repeats, the earlier symptoms of the disease will appear. Because of the dominant nature of the mutation, only one mutated allele is needed for the disease to be in effect. This means that if one parent is affected, the child will have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. This disease does not have carriers because if a patient has one mutation, they will (most likely) be affected. The disease typically has a late onset, so many parents have children before they know they have the mutation. The HTT mutation can be detected through genome screening.

=== Trisomy 21 ===
Trisomy 21 (also known as Down syndrome) results from a child having three copies of chromosome 21. This chromosome duplication occurs during germ cell formation, when both copies of chromosome 21 end up in the same daughter cell in either the mother or father, and this mutant germ cell participates in fertilization of the zygote. Another, more common way this can occur is during the first cell division event after the formation of the zygote. The risk of Trisomy 21 increases with maternal age with the risk being 1/2000 (0.05%) at age 20 increasing to 1/100 (1%) at age 40. This disease can be detected by non-invasive as well as invasive procedures prenatally. Non-invasive procedures include scanning for fetal DNA through maternal plasma via a blood sample.

=== Cystic fibrosis ===
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes a variety of symptoms and complications, the most common of which is a thick mucous lining in lung epithelial tissue due to improper salt exchange, but can also affect the pancreas, intestines, liver, and kidneys. Many bodily processes can be affected due to the hereditary nature of this disease; if the disease is present in the DNA of both the sperm and the egg, then it will be present in essentially every cell and organ in the body; these mutations can occur initially in the germline cells, or be present in all parental cells. The most common mutation seen in this disease is ΔF508, which means a deletion of the amino acid at the 508 position. If both parents have a mutated CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) protein, then their children have a 25% of inheriting the disease. If a child has one mutated copy of CFTR, they will not develop the disease, but will become a carrier of the disease. The mutation can be detected before birth through amniocentesis, or after birth via prenatal genetic screening.

== Current therapies ==
Many Mendelian disorders stem from dominant point mutations within genes, including cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle-cell anemia, and Tay–Sachs disease. By inducing a double stranded break in sequences surrounding the disease-causing point mutation, a dividing cell can use the non-mutated strand as a template to repair the newly broken DNA strand, getting rid of the disease-causing mutation. Many different genome editing techniques have been used for genome editing, and especially germline mutation editing in germ cells and developing zygotes; however, while these therapies have been extensively studied, their use in human germline editing is limited.

=== CRISPR/Cas9 editing ===

This editing system induces a double stranded break in the DNA, using a guide RNA and effector protein Cas9 to break the DNA backbones at specific target sequences. This system has shown a higher specificity than TALENs or ZFNs due to the Cas9 protein containing homologous (complementary) sequences to the sections of DNA surrounding the site to be cleaved. This broken strand can be repaired in 2 main ways: homologous directed repair (HDR) if a DNA strand is present to be used as a template (either homologous or donor), and if one is not, then the sequence will undergo non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ often results in insertions or deletions within the gene of interest, due to the processing of the blunt strand ends, and is a way to study gene knockouts in a lab setting. This method can be used to repair a point mutation by using the sister chromosome as a template, or by providing a double stranded DNA template with the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery to be used as the repair template.

This method has been used in both human and animal models (&quot;Drosophila&quot;, &quot;Mus musculus&quot;, &quot;and Arabidopsis&quot;), and current research is being focused on making this system more specific to minimize off-target cleavage sites.

=== TALEN editing ===
The TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) genome editing system is used to induce a double-stranded DNA break at a specific locus in the genome, which can then be used to mutate or repair the DNA sequence. It functions by using a specific repeated sequence of an amino acid that is 33-34 amino acids in length. The specificity of the DNA binding site is determined by the specific amino acids at positions 12 and 13 (also called the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD)) of this tandem repeat, with some RVDs showing a higher specificity for specific amino acids over others. Once the DNA break is initiated, the ends can either be joined with NHEJ that induces mutations, or by HDR that can fix mutations.

=== ZFN editing ===
Similar to TALENs, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) are used to create a double stranded break in the DNA at a specific locus in the genome. The ZFN editing complex consists of a zinc finger protein (ZFP) and a restriction enzyme cleavage domain. The ZNP domain can be altered to change the DNA sequence that the restriction enzyme cuts, and this cleavage event initiates cellular repair processes, similar to that of CRISPR/Cas9 DNA editing.

Compared to CRISPR/Cas9, the therapeutic applications of this technology are limited, due to the extensive engineering required to make each ZFN specific to the desired sequence.

<doc id="1150684" wikidata="Q2505100" url="?curid=1150684" title="The Beatles Ballads">
<text>The Beatles Ballads is a compilation album featuring a selection of ballad songs by the English rock band the Beatles. The album was not released in the United States, but was in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Italy, Spain, India, Japan, South Korea and Australia. In Australia, the album was a big success, spending seven weeks at number one. It reached number 17 in the UK.

The cover art by &quot;Patrick&quot; (John Byrne) is often incorrectly cited as being made as a potential album cover for &quot;The Beatles&quot; (&quot;The White Album&quot;); however, it was originally created for Alan Aldridge&#x27;s The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics.

The album was released in 1985 on LP and cassette under the EMI-ODEON label in Brazil using identical front and back cover art. It has never been officially released on compact disc.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Lennon–McCartney, except where indicated.

Despite a running time of almost one hour, the vinyl edition of this release has only ever been available as a single LP, rather than as a double set as sometimes presumed. &quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot; is the 1977 mix first used on the &quot;Love Songs&quot; compilation. The rest of the songs appear in their original stereo mixes, although four of these - &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot; and &quot;Here, There and Everywhere&quot; - had the left and right channels reversed, as on &quot;Love Songs&quot;. 
In South Korea, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was censored until 1993, so it was replaced with &quot;Girl&quot;.

<text>Hauke Harder (born 1963 in Heide (Holstein), Germany) is a German composer and experimental physicist.

== Life ==
Harder received a PhD in chemistry, and works at the Institute for Physical Chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Physics, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.

In 1989, he studied with Wolfgang von Schweinitz, a New Simplicity composer.

He is the founder, (with Rainer Grodnick) of the &quot;Gesellschaft für Akustische Lebenshilfe&quot;, (Society for Musical Living Assistance), Kiel, Germany. Since 1995, he has worked as an assistant to composer Alvin Lucier and is associated with the Material group of composers, along with Daniel James Wolf, and Markus Trunk. His compositional work is in an extreme minimal style, and is connected to the work of the composers Morton Feldman, Walter Zimmermann, and Alvin Lucier. His music has also been influenced by Monochrome Painting and the films of Robert Bresson.

His work in sound installation, exhibitions and concerts include: the International New Music Festival Rümlingen, Switzerland, Evenings of New Music Bratislava, Flanders Music Festival Antwerp, Nové Expozice hudby Brno.

== Awards ==
In 2001 he received a &quot;Kulturnetz-Preis&quot;, and 3,000 Mark, by Schleswig-Holstein&#x27;s culture minister Ute Erdsiek-Rave.

== Works ==
His works as a scientist in the field of molecular spectroscopy have been featured in:
* , 
* 

== Performances ==
Hildegard Kleeb has premiered his work. On 14 April 2009, his piece in honor of Walter Zimmermann was played in concert by Heather O&#x27;Donnell. He is in the Czech New Music Group MoEns&#x27; repertoire. Roland Dahinden has premiered his work. On 26 April 2008, Trio Nexus played his work at &quot;festival blurred edges&quot;, Hamburg.

== Criticism ==
Hauke Harder is both a composer and physicist, Blake and Newton in one person, if you will. This fact is something that Harder has always presented as essentially accidental. This fact has sometimes made composers and musicians a bit nervous, suspicious of the program behind his programs. A large part of this nervousness is surely just the anxiety most citizens feel about science: they do not understand it but believe it to be true. This is just a modern substitute of the fear of God felt by all of our ancestors. In truth, though, Harder’s vision should rather make physicists nervous: his is an assertion that the aesthetic, with qualities incomprehensible to the rational eye and ear, also has a part, indeed the vital part, in the life of the mind.

<text>The Wellington Arch, also known as the Constitution Arch or (originally) as the Green Park Arch, is a Grade I-listed triumphal arch by Decimus Burton that forms a centrepiece of Hyde Park Corner in central London, between the corner where Hyde Park meets Green Park. The Arch stands on a large green-space traffic island with crossings for pedestrian access. From its construction (1826–1830) the arch stood in a nearby location, slightly to the east, directly across from Burton&#x27;s Ionic screen entrance to Hyde Park; it was moved a short distance to its current site at the top of the Constitution Hill road in 1882–1883. The triumphal arch originally supported a colossal equestrian statue of the 1st Duke of Wellington by the sculptor Matthew Cotes Wyatt, acquiring its name as a result. &quot;Peace descending on the Quadriga of War&quot; by sculptor Adrian Jones, a bronze of the Goddess of Victory Nike riding a quadriga (an ancient four-horse chariot), has surmounted the arch since 1912.

==History==
=== Construct ===
Both the Wellington Arch and Marble Arch (originally sited in front of Buckingham Palace) were planned in 1825 by George IV to commemorate Britain&#x27;s victories in the Napoleonic Wars. During the second half of the 1820s, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests and the King resolved that Hyde Park, and the area around it, should be renovated to match the splendour of rival European capital cities, and that the essence of the new arrangement would be a triumphal approach to the recently completed Buckingham Palace. The committee of the project, led by the Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, and advised by Charles Arbuthnot, President of the Board of Commissioners of Woods and Forests, selected Decimus Burton as the project&#x27;s architect. In 1828, when giving evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee on the Government&#x27;s spending on public works, Arbuthnot explained that he had nominated Burton &quot;having seen in the Regent&#x27;s Park, and elsewhere, works which pleased my eye, from their architectural beauty and correctness&quot;. Burton intended to create an urban space dedicated to the celebration of the House of Hanover, national pride, and the nation&#x27;s heroes.

The renovation of Hyde Park, Green Park, and St James&#x27;s Park began in 1825, with the demarcation of new drives and pathways, subsequent to which Burton designed new lodges and gates, viz. Cumberland Gate, Stanhope Gate, Grosvenor Gate, the Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, and, later, the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Gate, Knightsbridge, in the classical style. There were no authoritative precedents for such buildings, which required windows and chimney stacks, in the classical style, and, in the opinion of architectural historian Guy Williams, &quot;Burton&#x27;s reticent treatment of the supernumerary features&quot; and of the cast iron gates and railings was &quot;greatly admired&quot;.

At Hyde Park Corner, the King required &quot;some great ceremonial outwork that would be worthy of the new palace that lay to its rear&quot;, and accepted Burton&#x27;s consequent proposal for a sequence comprising a gateway and a classical screen, and a triumphal arch, which would enable those approaching Buckingham Palace from the north to ride or drive first through the screen and then through the arch, before turning left to descend Constitution Hill and enter the forecourt of Buckingham Palace through John Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch. The screen became the neoclassical Hyde Park Gate/Screen at Hyde Park Corner, which delighted the King and his Committee, and which Guy Williams describes as &quot;one of the most pleasing architectural works that have survived from the neo-classical age&quot;. The triumphal arch became the Wellington Arch at Constitution Hill into Green Park, which has been described as &quot;one of London&#x27;s best loved landmarks&quot;. Burton&#x27;s original design for the triumphal arch, which was modelled on the Arch of Titus at Rome, on which the central and side blocks of the Screen had been modelled, was more technically perfect, and coherent with the Screen, than that of the arch that was subsequently built: this original design, however, was rejected by the Committee – who had envisaged a design based on the Arch of Constantine, on which Nash&#x27;s Marble Arch had been modelled – because it was not sufficiently ostentatious. Burton created a new design, &quot;to pander to the majestic ego&quot;, which was much larger and modelled on a fragment found in the Roman Forum, which was accepted on 14 January 1826, and subsequently built as the present Wellington Arch.

The arch has a single opening, and uses the Corinthian order. Much of the intended exterior ornamentation was omitted as a cost-saving exercise necessitated by the King&#x27;s overspending on the refurbishment of Buckingham Palace, which was underway at the same time. A contemporary account, written in anticipation of its completion to its original plan, describes what was intended:The entablature is lofty and elegant with a richly sculptured frieze, and a row of boldly projecting lions&#x27; heads on the cymatium, marking the centres of columns and other sub-divisions of the order. Above the entablature, on a lofty blocking course, is raised an attic, the body of which is embellished with a sculptural representation of an ancient triumph. On each of the columns is a statue of a warrior, and on the summit of the acroterium which surmounts the attic is a figure in a &quot;quadriga&quot; or ancient four horse chariot.

== Sculpture of the triumphal arch ==
The arch at Constitution Hill was left devoid of decorative sculpture as a result of the moratorium in 1828 on public building work, and, instead, despite the absolute objection of Burton, was mounted with a monumental equestrian statue of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, the son of the then recently deceased James Wyatt, who had been selected by statue&#x27;s commissioner, and one of its few subsequent advocates, Sir Frederick Trench. The bronze by Matthew Cotes Wyatt, which eventually crowned the arch, was, at 40 tons (40.62 tonne) and high, the largest equestrian figure ever made. Matthew Cotes Wyatt has been heavily criticised: Guy Williams claims that he was &quot;not noticeably talented&quot;, and F. M. O&#x27;Donoghue wrote in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; that &quot;thanks to royal and other influential patronage, Wyatt enjoyed a reputation and practice to which his mediocre abilities hardly entitled him&quot;.

Trench, and his patron John Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, had told the public subscribers that the statue would be placed on top of Burton&#x27;s triumphal arch at Hyde Park Corner; Burton expressed his opposition to this proposal &quot;as plainly and as vehemently as his nature allowed&quot; consistently over successive years, because the statue would &quot;disfigure&quot; his arch, for which it was much too large, and the surrounding neighbourhood, because it would have to be placed, contrary to all classical precedent, across, instead of parallel with, the roadway under the arch. Burton had envisaged that his arch would be topped with only a small quadriga whose horses would have been parallel with the road under the arch. Burton&#x27;s objections were extensively endorsed by most of the aristocratic residents of London. A writer in &quot;The Builder&quot; asked Lord Canning, the First Commissioner for Woods and Forests, to ban the project: We have learnt, and can state positively, that Mr. Burton has the strongest objection possible against placing the group in question on the archway... and that he is taking no part whatever in the alteration proposed to be made in the upper part of the structure to prepare it to receive the pedestal... Mr. Burton, through the mildness which characterizes him, has not expressed this opinion so loudly and so publicly as he ought to have done... an opinion prevails very generally, that he is a party to the proceedings, and this has induced many to be silent who would otherwise have spoken...

The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, contended that another site would be preferable, and proposed, on behalf of the Crown, to offer any other site, but the statue&#x27;s subscribers rejected all alternative proposals. Every single MP except Sir Frederick Trench wanted the statue to be placed elsewhere. Canning wrote that &quot;the remonstrances which reach Her Majesty&#x27;s Government against the proposed appropriation of the arch are so many and so strong, the representations of its architect, Mr. Burton, in the same sense, are so earnest, and the opinion of every other eminent architect, artist, or other competent authority who has been consulted on the subject is so decided [against the placing of the Wellington statue on the arch]&quot;.

Decimus Burton himself wrote, &quot;The arch would, I consider, suffer greatly in importance if the colossal statue in question be placed there, because it would become a mere pedestal. The want of proportion in the proposed surmount, compared with the columns and other details of the architecture, would show that they had been designed by different hands, and without reference for each other. ...I have desired to witness the completion of this building, as originally designed by me, and as approved by the Lords of the Treasury, yet I would prefer that the building should remain for the present in its forlorn and bare state, rather than a colossal equestrian statue should be placed upon it... I fear that if this appropriation of the building should be decided upon, a proposition would soon be made for removing altogether the facades of columns, the slender proportions of which would appear so incongruous and out of proportion compared with the prodigious dimensions of the statue&quot;. Burton had realized that the disciples of Augustus Pugin and advocates of Pugin&#x27;s anti-classicism would remove all classical elements from his arch if permitted the opportunity to do so.

The Government placed the Wellington statue on the arch in autumn 1846; Guy Williams contends that the product was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. &quot;The Builder&quot; contended, &quot;down, unquestionably, it must come. As the network of timber is removed, spar by spar, from before it, so do the folly of the experiment, the absurdity of the conjunction, and the greatness of the sacrifice become apparent. Its effect is even worse than we anticipated – the destruction of the arch by the statue, and of the statue by its elevation on the arch, more complete. Every post brings us letters urging renewed efforts to remove the figure to another site&quot;. The contestation about the prospective removal of the statue became national. However, the Government failed to remove the statue, despite that they had professed, when it had been placed, that they would do so if it provoked the aversion which it had provoked. Foreign intellectuals who visited London identified the incongruous fusion of the statue and the arch as &quot;spectacular confirmation&quot; of the &quot;artistic ignorance of the English&quot;. Guy Williams writes that &quot;[the] arch at Hyde Park Corner is a visible reminder of one of the fiercest attacks that have ever been launched in the worlds of art and architecture. The face of London might have been very different now – freer, perhaps, of the &#x27;monstrous carbuncles&#x27; so disliked by the present Prince of Wales – if the attacked party [Decimus Burton] had been a little more pugnacious, and so better equipped to stand his ground&quot;.
During 1882, traffic congestion at Hyde Park Corner motivated advocacy for Burton&#x27;s triumphal arch to be moved to the top of Constitution Hill to create space for traffic. In response to this advocacy, Burton&#x27;s great-nephew Francis Fearon compiled and published a pamphlet that advocated the removal of the Wellington statue from the arch in the event of the removal of the arch to another location: Fearon contended that the arch should be &quot;relieved once and for all of its unsightly load&quot;. The campaign led by Fearon was successful: Wyatt&#x27;s statue was removed to Aldershot, and its place on Burton&#x27;s arch, which was moved to Constitution Hill in 1883, was occupied by a Quadriga by Captain Adrian Jones. In Guy Williams&#x27; opinion Jones&#x27; statue is not nearly as elegant as Burton&#x27;s designed statue intended for the arch, but it is more coherent with the arch than Wyatt&#x27;s statue, and its figures, unlike those of Wyatt&#x27;s statue, are aligned with the roadway under the arch.

Jones&#x27;s statue is based on a smaller original which caught the eye of Edward VII at a Royal Academy exhibition. The sculpture depicts Nike, the winged goddess of victory, descending on the chariot of war, holding the classical symbol of victory and honour, a laurel wreath. The face of the charioteer leading the quadriga is that of a small boy (actually the son of Lord Michelham, who funded the sculpture). The angel of peace was modelled on Beatrice Stewart. The statue is the largest bronze sculpture in Europe. The boundary of Buckingham Palace Garden was moved south, and a new road named Duke of Wellington Place was created; this separated the space containing the Arch from the rest of the Green Park.

==Public access==

The arch is hollow inside and until 1992 housed the smallest police station in London. Transferred to the ownership of English Heritage in 1999, it is open to the paying public: three floors of exhibits detailing the history of the arch, Exhibition space, and high terraces on both sides of the arch with views of the surrounding area. One half of the arch functions as a ventilation shaft for the Hyde Park Corner road underpass, constructed in 1961–1962.

<text>Christopher Luverne Sieber (born February 18, 1969) is an American actor. He is best known for his roles Kevin Burke in &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; and Agatha Trunchbull in &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot;. He was twice nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical first at the 59th Tony Awards in 2005 for his portrayal of Sir Dennis Galahad in &quot;Spamalot&quot;, and then at the 63rd Tony Awards in 2009 for his portrayal of Lord Farquaad in &quot;Shrek the Musical&quot;. He has also played both male leads, Georges and Albin, in the musical &quot;La Cage aux Folles&quot;.

==Early life==
Christopher Sieber was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Fred and Caron Sieber. He is the middle child of three. Mike, his older brother, was a swimmer, and his younger brother, Marc, was in drama alongside him. He is a 1988 graduate of Forest Lake Area High School in Forest Lake, Minnesota, and was inducted into the Forest Lake Schools Hall of Fame in June 2011. After graduating, Sieber went to New York City to study at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy.

==Career==
=== Stage ===
Sieber made his Off-Broadway debut in a production of the musical &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; in 1994. Sieber has appeared in several Broadway musicals, including &quot;Into the Woods&quot;, &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Spamalot&quot;, &quot;Shrek The Musical&quot; and &quot;Company&quot;. For his roles in &quot;Spamalot&quot; and &quot;Shrek The Musical&quot;, Sieber was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical, first at the 59th Tony Awards in 2005 and then at the 63rd Tony Awards in 2009.

On June 1, 2007, Sieber sang tenor in the world premiere of Eric Idle&#x27;s &quot;Not the Messiah (He&#x27;s a Very Naughty Boy)&quot; in Toronto.

On January 31, 2014, it was announced that Sieber would be joining the company of &quot;Matilda the Musical&quot; on Broadway as Miss Agatha Trunchbull starting performances on March 18. However, due to a hand injury sustained in rehearsals, he did not start performances until April 18.

In 2016, Sieber joined the cast of &quot;The Prom&quot; as Trent Oliver in the out-of-town tryout at Atlanta’s Alliance Theatre, and continued in the role at Broadway’s Longacre Theatre from October 2018 to August 11, 2019.

On March 4, 2024, it was announced that Sieber would join the cast of &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; as Ernest Menville in its preview run at Chicago&#x27;s Cadillac Palace Theatre. Performances started on April 30, 2024 before the show transferred to Broadway later that year.

=== Television ===
In 1998, Sieber made his television debut playing Kevin Burke, father to Mary-Kate Burke (Mary-Kate Olsen) and Ashley Burke (Ashley Olsen) on the ABC sitcom &quot;Two of a Kind&quot;. The series lasted for one season before its cancellation. From 2003 to 2004, Sieber returned to ABC for &quot;It&#x27;s All Relative&quot;, in which he and John Benjamin Hickey played Simon Banks and Philip Stoddard, same-sex parents to Liz Stoddard-Banks (Maggie Lawson); other co-stars in the series included Reid Scott, Harriet Sansom Harris, and Lenny Clarke. In 2007, Sieber portrayed an eccentric zoologist for NBC comedy pilot &quot;Wildlife&quot;, which was not ordered by the network. In 2010, Sieber led the ABC comedy pilot &quot;It Takes a Village&quot; alongside Leah Remini and Cheyenne Jackson. In addition to these roles, Sieber has also had guest-starring roles in series such as &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;Pushing Daisies&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and several episodes of &quot;The Good Wife&quot;.

== Personal life ==

<doc id="1150698" wikidata="Q1096393" url="?curid=1150698" title="Ill Communication">
<text>Ill Communication is the fourth studio album by the American hip hop group Beastie Boys, released on May 31, 1994, by Grand Royal and Capitol Records. Co-produced by Beastie Boys and Mario Caldato, Jr., it is among the band&#x27;s most varied releases, drawing from hip hop, punk rock, jazz, and funk, and continues their trend away from sampling and towards live instruments, which began with their previous release, &quot;Check Your Head&quot; (1992). The album features musical contributions from Money Mark, Eric Bobo and Amery &quot;AWOL&quot; Smith, and vocal contributions from Q-Tip and Biz Markie. Beastie Boys were influenced by Miles Davis&#x27;s jazz rock albums &quot;On the Corner&quot; (1972) and &quot;Agharta&quot; (1975) while recording &quot;Ill Communication&quot;.

The album became the band&#x27;s second number-one album on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and their second album to be certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was supported by the single &quot;Sabotage&quot;, which was accompanied by a music video directed by Spike Jonze that parodied 1970s cop shows.

==Singles==

&quot;Sabotage&quot; was the first single taken from &quot;Ill Communication&quot;. It was released to radio on May 9, 1994. The backing track of the song was laid down by the band members, driven by MCA&#x27;s fuzzed and twangy bass, at Tin Pan Alley Studios in New York, and then sat unused for a year, with the working title of &quot;Chris Rock&quot;, before vocals were added. According to Ad-Rock in the 2020 documentary &quot;Beastie Boys Story&quot;, the lyrics are a fictitious rant about how their producer &quot;was the worst person ever and how he was always sabotaging us and holding us back.&quot;

&quot;Get It Together&quot;, which samples The Moog Machine&#x27;s cover of &quot;Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In&quot;, was released as a single on March 17, 1994.

&quot;Sure Shot&quot; features a sample taken from jazz flautist Jeremy Steig&#x27;s song &quot;Howlin&#x27; For Judy&quot; from the 1970 album &quot;Legwork&quot; as the main instrumental part of the song, and was released as a single on May 31, 1994. The album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Root Down&quot;, was released in 1995.

==Artwork==
Mike D and MCA collaborated with Gibran Evans, son of the artist and designer Jim Evans (who designed a hand-drawn typeface specifically for &quot;Ill Communication&quot; that was used throughout the promotion of the album), to create the album&#x27;s packaging. The photograph they chose for the front cover was taken by Bruce Davidson in 1964 at a Los Angeles drive-in diner called Tiny Naylor&#x27;s as part of an assignment for &quot;Esquire&quot;, but the magazine ultimately did not publish the photos. Although Davidson had not heard the Beastie Boys&#x27; music and did not understand it once he did—he later recalled thinking it sounded like a &quot;secret language&quot; when they sent him a demo tape—he agreed to let the band use his photo.

The booklet that came with the album features the artwork &quot;Gaia&quot; by Alex Grey on the middle pages.

==Critical reception==
The album received critical acclaim. &quot;Ill Communication&quot; placed at number 15 on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s 1994 Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, number 19 on &quot;Spin&quot;″s list of the &quot;20 Best Albums of &#x27;94&quot;, number three on &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 50 Albums of 1994&quot;, and number 13 on &quot;The Wire&quot;″s annual critics&#x27; poll. &quot;Guitar World&quot; included the album in its &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot; list. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included the album in its list of &quot;Essential Recordings of the 90s&quot;, and &quot;Q&quot; included the album in its list of the &quot;90 Best Albums of the 1990s&quot;. &quot;Mojo&quot; ranked the album number 54 on its list of &quot;100 Modern Classics&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

<doc id="1150699" wikidata="Q1789860" url="?curid=1150699" title="Mark 77 bomb">
<text>The Mark 77 bomb (MK-77) is a United States air-dropped incendiary bomb carrying of a fuel gel mix which is the direct successor to napalm.

The MK-77 is the primary incendiary weapon currently in use by the United States military. Instead of the gasoline, polystyrene, and benzene mixture used in napalm bombs, the MK-77 uses kerosene-based fuel with a lower concentration of benzene. The Pentagon has claimed that the MK-77 has less impact on the environment than napalm. The mixture reportedly also contains an oxidizing agent, making it more difficult to put out once ignited, as well as white phosphorus.

The effects of MK-77 bombs are similar to those of napalm. The official designation of World War II-era napalm bombs was the Mark 47.

Use of aerial incendiary bombs against civilian populations, including against military targets in civilian areas, was banned in the 1980 United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons Protocol III. However, the United States reserved the right to use incendiary weapons against military objectives located in concentrations of civilians where such use would be determined to cause fewer casualties and/or less collateral damage than alternative weapons.

==Use in Iraq and Afghanistan==
MK-77s were used by the United States Marine Corps during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Approximately 500 were dropped, reportedly mostly on Iraqi-constructed oil filled trenches. They were also used at the Battle of Tora Bora during the Afghan War.

At least thirty MK-77s were also used by Marine Corps aviators over a three-day period during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, according to a June 2005 letter from the UK Ministry of Defence to former Labour MP Alice Mahon. This letter stated:

The U.S. destroyed its remaining Vietnam era napalm in 2001 but, according to the reports for I Marine Expeditionary Force (I MEF) serving in Iraq in 2003, they used a total of 30 MK 77 weapons in Iraq between 31 March and 2 April 2003, against military targets away from civilian areas. The MK 77 firebomb does not have the same composition as napalm, although it has similar destructive characteristics. The Pentagon has told us that owing to the limited accuracy of the MK 77, it is not generally used in urban terrain or in areas where civilians are congregated.

This confirmed previous reports by U.S. Marine pilots and their commanders saying they had used Mark 77 firebombs on military targets:

According to the Italian public service broadcaster RAI&#x27;s documentary &quot;Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre&quot;, the MK 77 had been used in Baghdad in 2003 in civilian-populated areas. However, Marine pilots stated to the San Diego Union-Tribune that the targets of the bombings were Iraqi soldiers defending civilian infrastructure such as bridges, as opposed to targeting civilians directly.

In some cases where journalists reported that the U.S. military has used napalm, military spokesmen denied the use of &quot;napalm&quot; without making it clear that MK-77 bombs had actually been deployed instead.

U.S. officials incorrectly informed U.K. Ministry of Defence officials that MK-77s had not been used by the U.S. in Iraq, leading to Defence Minister Adam Ingram making inaccurate statements to the U.K. Parliament in January 2005. Later both Adam Ingram and Secretary of State for Defence John Reid apologized for these inaccurate statements being made to Members of Parliament.

==Variants==
Later variants of the bomb were modified to carry a reduced load of of fuel, which resulted in the total weight decreasing to around .

* Mk 77 Mod 0 - total weight with of petroleum oil.
* Mk 77 Mod 1 - total weight with of petroleum oil.
* Mk 77 Mod 2
* Mk 77 Mod 3
* Mk 77 Mod 4 - Approx total weight with of fuel (Used during the 1991 Gulf War)
* Mk 77 Mod 5 - Approx total weight with of JP-4/JP-5 or JP-8 fuel and thickener (Used during the 2003 invasion of Iraq)
* Mk 78 - total weight with of petroleum oil. No longer in service.
* Mk 79 - total weight with of napalm and petrol. No longer in service.

<text>Edward James Connery (July 13, 1933 in St. Vital, Manitoba – June 14, 2019) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1992, and a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1991.

Connery was educated at Glenlawn Collegiate in St. Vital, Manitoba, and later worked as a market gardener. He was chair of the &quot;Root Crop Marketing Board&quot; from 1972 to 1981, and vice-president of the &quot;Manitoba Producers Board&quot; from 1982 to 1984, as well as having been a director of the &quot;Vegetable Growers Association of Manitoba&quot;. He married Beverley Sager.

Connery was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, in the safe Tory seat of Portage la Prairie. The Tories were defeated by the New Democrats under Howard Pawley in this cycle, and Connery became a member of the official opposition.

Connery was re-elected in the 1988 election against a reasonably strong challenge from Liberal Darlene Hamm (he still won by over 1000 votes). The Tories under Gary Filmon formed a minority government after this election, and Connery was appointed Minister of Labour and Minister of the Environment and Workplace Safety and Health on May 9, 1988. He was also responsible for the Workers Compensation Act (except as regards Worker Advisers), the Civil Service Act, the Civil Service Superannuation Act, and the Public Servants Insurance Act. Following a cabinet shuffle on April 21, 1989, he was named Minister of Cooperative, Consumer and Corporate Affairs.

Connery was re-elected in the 1990 election. He was not re-appointed to cabinet in a shuffle on February 5, 1991, and resigned from the legislature on June 23, 1992. In leaving, he complained openly about Filmon&#x27;s government being controlled by backroom operators.

In 2003, Connery called for greater efforts to combat crime in the Portage la Prairie region.

He was an industry leader in mechanizing the harvesting of carrots, onions and rutabagas, as well as their bulk storage, utilizing air circulation and humidification. He is a strong supporter of agricultural research to solve industry production, storage and marketing problems. His assistance contributed to solving problems related to: surface browning of carrots, neck rot in onions, surface cracking of rutabagas and quality maintenance in broccoli. On July 19, 2007, Connery was inducted into the Manitoba Agricultural Hall of Fame.

<text>Christ Community Church in Zion, Illinois, formerly the Christian Catholic Church or Christian Catholic Apostolic Church, is an evangelical non-denominational church founded in 1896 by John Alexander Dowie. The city of Zion was founded by Dowie as a religious community to establish a society on the principles of the Kingdom of God. Members are sometimes called Zionites (not to be confused with the German Zionites).

Over the years there have been many changes to the church founded by John Alexander Dowie. He was a popular faith healer and started the church and the Zion community with utopian ideals. Under Wilbur Glenn Voliva, Dowie&#x27;s successor, the church was noted for its adherence to a flat earth cosmology. The succession of pastors after Voliva moved the church towards mainstream Protestant doctrine.

In the early 20th century, the Christian Catholic Church had worldwide appeal. The church&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Leaves of Healing&quot;, was distributed in the U.S., Australia, Europe, and southern Africa. At its height, Dowie&#x27;s movement had some 20,000 adherents. The Zionist Churches of southern Africa trace their spiritual heritage back to Dowie and the Christian Catholic Church. Because of Dowie&#x27;s emphasis on faith healing and restorationism the church is considered a forerunner of Pentecostalism.

The name Christian Catholic Church is still used for Christ Community Church&#x27;s worldwide fellowship of churches and mission work. As of 2008, it has about 3,000 members in the United States and Canada. Missionary work is conducted in Japan, Philippines, Guyana, Palestine, Indonesia, and the Navajo Nation. Missionary work continues among the African Zionists under the banner of Zion Evangelical Ministries of Africa (ZEMA). ZEMA&#x27;s goal is to convert the African Zionists from syncretism to mainstream Christian theology.

== John Alexander Dowie ==

John Alexander Dowie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, May 25, 1847, to an evangelical family. The family emigrated to Australia in 1860, with Dowie returning to attend the University of Edinburgh from 1867 to 1872, at which time he once more sailed for Australia. In 1876 Dowie married and he began his evangelistic ministry three years later in Melbourne.

Dowie emigrated to San Francisco in 1888 where he founded the Ministry of Divine Healing. After years of traveling across the country preaching and healing, he finally settled in Chicago and in 1893 set up a tabernacle at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. During the next seven years, Dowie founded the Christian Catholic Church that met in several city locations including the Chicago Auditorium (1896). In 1900 he purchased land along the shores of Lake Michigan, north of Chicago near the Illinois–Wisconsin border and founded a religious utopian community that he called Zion.

He also founded a commercial enterprise, which came to be called Zion Industries, to support the community. Initially its main product was Scottish lace and it enjoyed considerable success.

Dowie proselytized vigorously both in person and by means of several serial publications, chief among them being &quot;Leaves of Healing&quot;, and gained a lot of adherents. At its height in 1905, the church claimed some 30,000 members worldwide, of whom some 7500 settled in Zion. Two notable features of Dowie&#x27;s preaching were faith healing and what he called holy living—his followers were admonished to abstain from tobacco, alcohol, pork products, doctors and medicines, the &quot;apostate churches&quot;, etc.

Dowie had progressive views on race relations for his day and welcomed African-Americans into his church, of whom some 200 settled in Zion. He later sent some of them as missionaries to South Africa, where they established churches that became very influential.

As the community of Zion grew in size and prosperity, Dowie adopted an increasingly lavish lifestyle, building himself a 25-room mansion and dressing himself in ornate ecclesiastical robes modeled after those worn by Aaron, the high priest, described in Leviticus. Due to this and other financial mismanagement, the church was threatened with bankruptcy. In 1905 Dowie suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes. In 1906 his followers revolted, ousted him from leadership and elected Wilbur Glenn Voliva as the new leader of the church. A splinter group rejected the new leadership, left Zion, and some of them went on to become influential leaders of the budding Pentecostal movement. Dowie died of another stroke on March 9, 1907.

A bizarre sidelight on Dowie&#x27;s later years is that he became embroiled in an acrimonious public dispute with a controversial Indian Muslim religious figure, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. In 1903 they engaged in a widely publicized &quot;prayer duel&quot;, each calling upon God to punish the other to expose him as a false prophet. Ahmad and his followers proclaimed Dowie&#x27;s rapidly ensuing illness, disgrace, and death as a vindication of their religious beliefs. Ahmad died in 1908, a year later than Dowie, although he was several years older than Dowie.

== Wilbur Glenn Voliva ==

Wilbur Glenn Voliva succeeded Dowie as General Overseer of Zion in 1906 and renamed the church to &quot;Christian Catholic Apostolic Church&quot;. He kept tight control on his some 6000 followers, which made up the community, even up to the point of dictating their choice of marriage partners. All real estate in Zion, while sold at market rates, was conveyed under an 1100-year lease, subject to many restrictions and subject to termination at the whim of the General Overseer. Religions other than the Christian Catholic Apostolic Church were effectively banned - visiting preachers from rival sects were harassed and hounded out of town by the city police force.

He diversified Zion Industries to include a bakery which produced the popular Zion brand fig bar cookies and White Dove chocolates. Zion was a one company town and its workers were paid substandard wages.

A strict code of morality was imposed in the town on all persons who set foot inside city limits. It was unlawful for women to wear short dresses, high heels, bathing suits or lipstick. Ham, bacon, oysters, liquor and tobacco were banned, as were drugstores, medical buildings, movie theaters, and globes (as they challenged Voliva&#x27;s flat-earth cosmology). A ten o&#x27;clock curfew was rigidly enforced. You could be arrested for whistling on Sunday. These laws were enforced by Voliva&#x27;s police force, called the Praetorian Guard, whose helmets carried the word &#x27;PATIENCE&#x27; and whose sleeves bore images of doves. Policemen wore Bibles and clubs on their belts.

Voliva gained a lot of nationwide notoriety by his vigorous advocacy of flat earth doctrine. He offered a widely publicized $5000 challenge for anyone to disprove flat earth theory, but on terms of his own choosing. The church schools in Zion taught the flat earth doctrine. His 5,000 watt radio station, WCBD, broadcast his diatribes against round earth astronomy, and the evils of evolution.

Like his predecessor Dowie, Voliva increasingly developed an overtly lavish lifestyle, which began to alienate his followers, especially after the hardships brought on by the Great Depression, which forced the town&#x27;s sole employer, Zion Industries, into bankruptcy. In 1935 Voliva tried to revive the flagging fortunes of the church by instituting the annual Zion Passion Play, along the lines of the famous one in Oberammergau. However, in 1937 a disgruntled employee set the church&#x27;s huge Shiloh Tabernacle, where the play took place, ablaze. Shortly thereafter, Voliva was forced into personal bankruptcy. In 1942 after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Voliva made a tearful public confession to his followers that he had misappropriated church funds for his personal use and committed other misdeeds. Shortly thereafter on October 11, 1942, he died, and the church all but dissolved.

A small remnant was reorganized under the leadership of Michael Mintern but a second fire destroyed the Zion Auditorium on April 11, 1959. At this time the Robson family from England were living in an apartment in the building. They were out of the building at the time. Had they been at home they would have perished, as the fire appliances were not able to reach the fourth floor. This was felt to be God&#x27;s provision as He kept them out of the building that day. The church in Zion was later renamed to Christ Community Church.

<text>John Fitzalan, 1st Baron Arundel (c. 1348 – 1379), also known as Sir John Arundel, was an English soldier.

== Lineage ==

He was born in Etchingham, Sussex, England to Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel (c. 1313 – 1376), and his second wife Eleanor of Lancaster (1318–1372), daughter of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and widow of John Beaumont, 2nd Baron Beaumont. His brother was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was Joan Fitzalan, Countess of Hereford.

== High office ==

John was appointed Lord Marshal of England by Richard II in 1377, and summoned to the House of Lords on 4 August 1377, by writ directed &quot;Johanni de Arundell&quot;. He served as Lord Marshal until 1379.

On 26 July 1379 he was given licence to crenellate (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as Betchworth Castle.

== Naval victory ==

Being in command of a naval expedition in aid to the Duke of Brittany, he defeated the French fleet off the coast of Cornwall.

== Death at sea ==

Commanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the Duke of Brittany, Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men &quot;took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped&quot; those they found inside. Further to this Sir John &quot;allowed his men to ransack the countryside as they liked and to impoverish the people&quot;. When the force eventually set out to sea, carrying with them goods stolen from a nearby church and under a pronouncement of excommunication from the wronged priests, the expedition was caught in a storm. Thomas Walsingham reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned.

According to Thomas Walsingham&#x27;s story, FitzAlan&#x27;s men profaned a convent at or near Southampton, and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near Scarriff according to some authorities, but at Cape Clear Island according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews. Froissart&#x27;s account of the event differs essentially from Walsingham&#x27;s, in the omission of the story of the desecration of the convent.

== Burial ==

He was buried in Lewes, Sussex.

== Marriage and children ==

On 17 February 1358, FitzAlan married Eleanor Maltravers (Mautravers) (1345 – 10 January 1404 or 1406), daughter of John Maltravers, 1st Baron Maltravers and Gwenthin. They had at least five children (some references list more):

*Joan FitzAlan (D&#x27; Arundel) (c. 1360 – 1 September 1404. She married first William de Brien (one son) and secondly Sir William de Echingham.
*John FitzAlan, 2nd Baron Arundel (3 November 1364 – 14 August 1390), who married Elizabeth le Despenser.
*Richard FitzAlan (c. 1366 – 3 June 1419). His daughter Joan married Thomas Willoughby of Parham, a grandson of Alayne FitzAlan, daughter of Edmund Fitzalan, 2nd Earl of Arundel.
*Sir William Arundel (c. 1369 – 1400). He was a Knight of the Garter.
*Margaret (1372 – 7 July 1439) married William Ros, 6th Baron Ros of Hamlake and had descendants

<text>Reel Music is a compilation album featuring a selection of songs by the Beatles that were featured in their films, as the title suggests. The album was released on 22 March 1982 in the United States and the following day in the United Kingdom – almost simultaneously with the theatrical re-release of the film, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, which had been &quot;cleaned&quot; and re-edited with stereo Dolby sound. In the US, &quot;Reel Music&quot; peaked at number 19 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s albums chart.

The album was released by Capitol Records in the United States (catalogue number SV 12199) and Parlophone in the United Kingdom (PCS 7218). In the US and Canada, the album was issued simultaneously in limited edition gold vinyl pressings. In New Zealand, the LP was released on the Parlophone label (PCS 7218), and the inner sleeve and booklet were imported from the US. Aside from box-set collections, it was the first Beatles album released after John Lennon&#x27;s death. &quot;Reel Music&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The album cover illustrations are a painting by David McMacken.

==Unique mixes==
The album features stereo mixes that were rare to the US or previously unavailable at the time:
*The first US release of the British stereo mix of &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. Previous American releases of the song had the intro edited like the mono mix, although an edit of the British version appeared on &quot;Rarities&quot; two years before;
*The official American debut of the songs &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; in true stereo;
*A unique stereo edit of &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, with the harmonica error in the intro fixed. This version was issued only on the Capitol pressing and has never appeared on any other record.

==Single==
*The album was accompanied by the single &quot;The Beatles&#x27; Movie Medley&quot; b/w &quot;I&#x27;m Happy Just to Dance with You&quot;, which came with a picture sleeve featuring the same artwork as the album cover. The A-side of the single featured an artificial medley, in which excerpts from seven songs from &quot;Reel Music&quot; (&quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot;, &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot;, &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot;) were edited together to make a single track.
* Originally, the single&#x27;s B-side was to be an interview with the group dubbed &quot;Fab Four on Film&quot;, which was recorded during the filming of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; in 1964. Capitol/EMI Records, however, could not obtain the necessary permission to utilise the interview on the single, and &quot;I&#x27;m Happy Just to Dance with You&quot; (which appeared in the &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; film but which was not included on the &quot;Reel Music&quot; album) was substituted as the B-side shortly before the single was released, although promotional copies of the single featured the interview.

== Track listing ==

<doc id="1150735" wikidata="Q3282767" url="?curid=1150735" title="Bricks Are Heavy">
<text>Bricks Are Heavy is the third studio album by American rock band L7, released on April 14, 1992, by Slash Records. The album peaked at number 160 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Heatseekers Albums chart. As of June 2000, &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; has sold 327,000 copies in the United States, according to Nielsen Soundscan.

==Production==
Produced by the band and Butch Vig, musically the album is heavier and dirtier than the band&#x27;s previous recordings and described as &quot;catchy tunes and mean vocals on top of ugly guitars and a quick-but-thick bottom of cast-iron grunge&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Gina Arnold.

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;Playboy&quot;, Robert Christgau regarded &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; as an &quot;object lesson in how to advance your music by meeting the marketplace halfway&quot;, although he believed it would not sell as much as it deserved. He said Vig helped L7 produce grunge-metal featuring &quot;intense admixtures of ditty and power chord&quot; that &quot;never quite gathers Nirvana&#x27;s momentum, but it&#x27;s just as catchy and a touch nastier.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; critic Angela Lewis called &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; a &quot;polished, virile white heat rock&quot; record that &quot;verifies their hard rock credentials completely&quot; and demonstrates that L7 ought not to be pigeonholed as a grunge act in the vein of &quot;Hole–Babes–Jane&quot;. &quot;Kerrang!&quot;″s Steffan Chirazi was most impressed by the album&#x27;s &quot;relentlessness&quot; in &quot;driving the frustrations of everyday life home&quot;, and Gina Arnold said in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that L7 distinguish themselves from the musically similar Nirvana through the &quot;clarity&quot; of their lyrics. &quot;Although the band&#x27;s positive-plus stances on liberal issues may not instantly endear it to fuzzy-minded teen America,&quot; Arnold wrote, &quot;L7 does manage to be simultaneously fun and furious, an intensely appealing combination.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Jonathan Gold, while finding &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; &quot;a very good, sometimes brilliant hard-rock album&quot;, expressed reservations about Vig&#x27;s polished production, saying that although it suited &quot;a pop band at heart&quot; like Nirvana, &quot;L7 is a &quot;rock&quot; band, less like the Byrds than like the MC5, less about pop craft than about sheer aggression.&quot; Arion Berger of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that the production&#x27;s &quot;neatly modulated dynamics&quot; rendered the album &quot;merely raucous where it might have been apocalyptic.&quot; In the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Greg Kot opined that there were not many good songs such as &quot;Slide&quot; and &quot;the performances—while certainly ferocious—aren&#x27;t sufficiently varied enough to make up the difference.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; listed &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; as the 39th best album of 1992. It placed at number 32 in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, with the poll&#x27;s creator Robert Christgau ranking the album fourth on his ballot.

===Legacy===
Reviewing &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; for AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia said that Vig helped L7 &quot;obtain a tight, compact sound&quot; and sharpen their songwriting on what would be their &quot;crowning achievement&quot; and &quot;an impossible act to follow&quot;.

&quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; is now regarded as one of grunge music&#x27;s best albums. &quot;Treble&quot;″s Brian Roesler credited L7 with helping to define &quot;the very best of early grunge&quot; through the album&#x27;s fusion of pop and metal musical elements.

In 2015, &quot;Spin&quot; placed &quot;Bricks Are Heavy&quot; at number 249 on its list of the &quot;300 Best Albums of the Past 30 Years&quot;.

The government of Canada proposed the boundaries of the Tantramar Marshes in 1966 and was declared a National Wildlife Area in 1978.

The marshes are an important stopover for migrating waterfowl such as semipalmated sandpipers and Canada geese. Now a National Wildlife Area, the marshes are the site of two bird sanctuaries.

The name &quot;Tantramar&quot; is derived from the Acadian French &quot;tintamarre&quot;, meaning &#x27;din&#x27; or &#x27;racket&#x27;, a reference to the noisy flocks of birds which feed there.

The Mi&#x27;kmaq, an Indigenous nation, historically inhabited the surrounding areas of the Tantramar Marshes. Communities currently on or bordering the marshes include, in New Brunswick: Aulac and Sackville, and on the Nova Scotia side: Amherst, and Fort Lawrence.

The landscape of the Tantramar Marshes has provided subject matter for the poets Charles G.D. Roberts, Bliss Carman, Douglas Lochhead, Marilyn Lerch and Elizabeth Bishop, painter Alex Colville, and photographer Thaddeus Holownia.

== National wildlife area status ==

The boundaries of Tintamarre National Wildlife Area were proposed in 1966 for the National Habitat Protection Program, through the government of Canada. The land was acquired by the Canadian Government up until the mid 1970s and officially declared a National Wildlife Area in 1978. Tintamarre Marshes consists of 1960 hectares that consist primarily of wetlands and historic agricultural land. Two additional units to the area are being proposed but unofficial, surrounding Hog Lake and Towers Goose Lake.

National Wildlife areas like Tintamarre are created to manage and protect native wildlife. Tintamarre Marsh is a breeding area for several types of waterfowl, and home to numerous plants and animals. Environment and Climate Change Canada manages the well being of the various species in Tintamarre and their long time goal is “to maintain and enhance habitat for native wildlife, with a priority given to waterfowl, wetland birds and species at risk.” as outlined in a 2016 report. Seven management goals were outlined: wetland diversity, open fields, upland habitat, fish passage, invasive species, human activity, and exterior forces.

Many of the threats posed to the National Wildlife Area are of anthropogenic origin. Unauthorized activities such as camping - including fires, - off road vehicle use, and an overall increase in tourism have the potential to harm and destroy the vulnerable habitat. Other human-based concerns include nearby wind power farms disrupting migratory bird populations and fish pathways for diadromous species no longer functioning as intended. Other threats include invasive species outcompeting native wildlife and climate change.

== Natural environment ==
=== Wildlife ===

The Tantramar Marsh is a saltwater tidal marsh comprising many interconnecting waterways. Much of the area is below sea level, but instances of flooding are prevented by the soft ground and plant life which withhold water and filter out toxins. This mix of fresh and saltwater creates unique ecosystems for many species, mostly birds and fish. The word “Tantramar” comes from the French “tintamarre” which means “din”, a reference to the cacophony of noise made by the local waterfowl. The environment provides a good stop-over for birds migrating between northern Canada and warmer, southern climates. The marshes are home to species such as the Northern harrier (&quot;Circus hudsonius&quot;), American bittern (&quot;Botaurus lentiginosus&quot;), Sora (&quot;Porzana carolina&quot;), muskrat (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), and maritime shrew (&quot;Sorex maritimensis&quot;), all of which are vital to the marsh’s ecological systems.

==== Keystone species ====
The presence of these keystone species ensures the continued vitality of the marshes and the ecosystems that they support. The Northern harrier is a bird of prey, feeding on small rodents which eat grass seeds and the eggs and young of other birds. The American bittern and Sora are elusive waterfowl which are highly sensitive to changes in their environment, so they have been classified as indicator species. A decrease in their populations alerts conservationists to issues in the marshes such as degradation, loss of prey species, or human interference. The muskrat is a rat-sized rodent which has evolved to become semi-aquatic. They feed on cattails and yellow water lilies, creating open water areas that best suit waterfowl, fish, and frogs. The Maritime shrew is another rodent, slightly smaller than the muskrat, which responds to increasing numbers of insects and goes on a feasting spree. It keeps these numbers down and prevents insects from becoming too numerous.

==== Species at risk ====
The marshes are also home to numerous species at risk as designated under the Species at Risk Act (SARA). Bird species include the barn swallow (&quot;Hirundo rustica&quot;), chimney swift (&quot;Chaetura pelagica&quot;), Canada warbler (&quot;Cardellina canadensis&quot;), olive-sided flycatcher (&quot;Contopus cooperi&quot;), bobolink (&quot;Dolichonyx oryzivorus&quot;), common nighthawk (&quot;Chordeiles minor&quot;), red knot (&quot;Calidris canutus&quot;), least bittern (&quot;Ixobrychus exilis&quot;), eastern meadowlark (&quot;Sturnella magna&quot;), and short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;). The American eel (&quot;Anguilla rostrata&quot;) also makes its home here as it can breed in the Gulf’s salt water and migrate the short distance to fresh river water in the marshes. The Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) also enjoys the mix of salt and fresh water – the eggs are laid in the clean waters of rivers and streams where the young can feed and grow safely. Once large enough, they migrate to the salt waters of the gulf until they are ready to return to the marsh to breed. The monarch butterfly (&quot;Danaus plexippus&quot;) breeds in the marshes during the summer months, thanks to the presence of its Host plant Milkweed.

=== Plant life ===
With its ability to thrive in exposed environments with low-lying landscapes, Spartina dominates the plant life in the Tantramar marshes. The spartina is essential in stabilizing clay, sand, silt, and muck of the saltmarshes. Saltwater cordgrass (&quot;Spartina alternifolia&quot;) grows closest to water in the low marshlands along the boundaries of the tidal rivers and are flooded daily with salt water (about 12-15%). Salt-meadow cordgrass (&quot;Spartina patens&quot;) grow in the high marshlands and are only flooded 2% of the time allowing them to grow taller than saltwater cordgrass. Another type of grass plant is the freshwater cordgrass (&quot;Spartina pectinata&quot;) which can obtain freshwater runoff from uplands allowing them to grow the tallest of the three. Freshwater cordgrass gets flooded a few times throughout the year during high tides in spring.

Additionally to spartina, located in the middle marshlands, there are two plants that are a part of a low-growing succulent plant family. The samphire (&quot;Salicornia europaea&quot;) and seablite (&quot;Suaeda maritima&quot;) grow in bare mud that is located in the middle area that sits just above the high tides of the marshland. In the high marshlands, there is sea lavender (&quot;Limonium carolinianum&quot;), arrow-grass (&quot;Triglochin maritima&quot;), seaside plantain (&quot;Plantago juncoides&quot;), seamilkwort (&quot;Glaux maritima&quot;), and love-grass (&quot;Eragrostis&quot; sp.). In naturally forming lakes, there are several plant species belonging to the genus &quot;Nuphar&quot;. Due to better water and soil drainage, these plants are able to prosper. These species include water lilies, Bladderwort (&quot;Utricularia)&quot;, Buckbean (&quot;Menyanthes&quot;), mare’s tail (&quot;Hippuris vulgaris&quot;), and Pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton natans, P. spirrilus&quot;).

=== Climate change ===
As with most wildlife protection areas, climate change poses a serious threat to the ecology of the Tantramar marsh. Climate change introduces rising temperatures, increases in storm frequency and severity, and rising sea levels which will result in the flooding of low lying land and coastal areas. The rise in temperature is creating new environments in which invasive species and diseases can survive while native species struggle to adapt. Storms bring in unusual levels of precipitation and strong winds which can damage the fragile ecosystems of the marsh and the dykes in New Brunswick which help prevent flooding from the Gulf of Maine. Rising sea levels increase the threat of flooding too much for the marshes to be able to regulate. If Tintamarre National Wildlife Area were to flood with enough sea-water it would cause large scale die-offs and damage for the freshwater species that inhabit the freshwater wetlands. Water from flooding via dyke failure or from increased and more intense storms due to climate change will also lead to accelerated Erosion, draining the wetland of many important nutrients.

== Uses of the marsh ==
For a full account of human activity on the marshes, see the History of Sackville.

=== Historical uses ===
The Mi’kmaq are the Indigenous peoples of Tantramar marshes and surrounding areas, they have many traditional uses for the resources in this area. The marsh was used for harvesting of different kinds of plants, wildfowl, small mammals and fish as means of food. Before the arrival of Europeans, well-travelled portage routes connected the Bay of Fundy with the Northumberland Strait as the marsh was used seasonally. As years passed and different settlers came to the Tantramar marshes the use of these resources changed, going from the fish weirs of the Mi&#x27;kmaq to the creation of dry farming by the Acadians from the creation of sluice gates to keep out water where the rivers crossed the dykes in order for planting to take place.

Migrating from Port Royal in around 1671, Acadians established a village in the area (which they called Beaubassin). They founded a number of scattered settlements on higher ground, and created dry farmland using polderisation, by building the dykes and sluices which converted the salt marshes to fields and pastures. Following the Battle of Fort Beauséjour which marked the end of the battle for Acadia between the British and French, it was the site of the beginning of the expulsion of the Acadians in 1755. Six years later the British resettled the area, and continued to convert the marsh to arable land, drying the land in order to plant crops for agricultural practices.

During the 19th century the land use in and around the Tantramar region changed, land ownership became consolidated and a Commission of Sewers was established, which was crucial to the economy. By the mid-1800s, 10,000 hectares was producing grains, root crops, and marsh hay. Once turned into polders, the cost of producing hay was low. Inexpensive Tantramar hay was then sold to lumber camps, exploration, and mining in Atlantic Canada and stables as far away as Boston. In the 1930s there were more than 400 post-and-beam hay barns on the marshes, for hay storage. Today there are fewer than 30. The price of hay was $28 per ton in 1920, but as horses were replaced by cars and as manufacturing moved west, the hay price fell to $7 a ton in 1938. The marshes then became pasture, and as their agricultural profitability declined the Canadian Wildlife Service and Ducks Unlimited helped to return the marshes to a more natural state. After 2010 fears emerged that rising sea levels and deterioration of 18th-century hand-built dykes and sluices threatened to flood the Tantramar Marshes and make Nova Scotia into an island separate from the North American mainland.In 1945 Radio Canada International opened a radio transmitter and the site proved to be one of the best shortwave transmitting locations in the world. Shortwave broadcasting ended in 2012 and transmitting towers have since been removed. In 2017, the CBC announced that the site had been sold to a non-profit consortium of New Brunswick Mi&#x27;kmaq bands known as Mi&#x27;gmawe&#x27;l Tplu&#x27;taqnn. The intended use of the property was not disclosed.

=== Present uses ===
The declaration of the Tantramar Marshes as a protected area resulted in many restrictions being imposed with how the land and water surrounding it can be accessed and used. Visitors are given access to the protected area for things like leisure activities, which include swimming, having group events and meals, using the trails for hikes, boating, skiing/snowboarding and skating. Sport hunting of specific animals is allowed, as long as the required permits have been attained and regulations are followed. Fishing is also allowed but limits are imposed to avoid overfishing, a permit is also required for sport fishing. Any access to the Tintamarre National Wildlife Area, and with regards to all the above-mentioned uses of the park, are only permitted from sunrise to sunset. Use outside of those times is against the Law.

<doc id="1150748" wikidata="Q377808" url="?curid=1150748" title="Bhagat Singh">
<text>Bhagat Singh (27 September 1907 – 23 March 1931) was an Indian anti-colonial revolutionary who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928 in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist. He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India. Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism, the charismatic Bhagat Singh electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s and prompted urgent introspection within the Indian National Congress&#x27;s nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India&#x27;s independence.

In December 1928, Bhagat Singh and an associate, Shivaram Rajguru, both members of a small revolutionary group, the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (also Army, or HSRA), shot dead a 21-year-old British police officer, John Saunders, in Lahore, Punjab, in what is today Pakistan, mistaking Saunders, who was still on probation, for the British senior police superintendent, James Scott, whom they had intended to assassinate. They held Scott responsible for the death of a popular Indian nationalist leader Lala Lajpat Rai for having ordered a lathi (baton) charge in which Rai was injured and two weeks thereafter died of a heart attack. As Saunders exited a police station on a motorcycle, he was felled by a single bullet fired from across the street by Rajguru, a marksman. As he lay injured, he was shot at close range several times by Singh, the postmortem report showing eight bullet wounds. Another associate of Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, shot dead an Indian police head constable, Channan Singh, who attempted to give chase as Singh and Rajguru fled.

After having escaped, Bhagat Singh and his associates used pseudonyms to publicly announce avenging Lajpat Rai&#x27;s death, putting up prepared posters that they had altered to show John Saunders as their intended target instead of James Scott. Singh was thereafter on the run for many months, and no convictions resulted at the time. Surfacing again in April 1929, he and another associate, Batukeshwar Dutt, set off two low-intensity homemade bombs among some unoccupied benches of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi. They showered leaflets from the gallery on the legislators below, shouted slogans, and allowed the authorities to arrest them. The arrest, and the resulting publicity, brought to light Singh&#x27;s complicity in the John Saunders case. Awaiting trial, Singh gained public sympathy after he joined fellow defendant Jatin Das in a hunger strike, demanding better prison conditions for Indian prisoners, the strike ending in Das&#x27;s death from starvation in September 1929.

Bhagat Singh was convicted of the murder of John Saunders and Channan Singh, and hanged in March 1931, aged 23. He became a popular folk hero after his death. Jawaharlal Nehru wrote about him: &quot;Bhagat Singh did not become popular because of his act of terrorism but because he seemed to vindicate, for the moment, the honour of Lala Lajpat Rai, and through him of the nation. He became a symbol; the act was forgotten, the symbol remained, and within a few months each town and village of the Punjab, and to a lesser extent in the rest of northern India, resounded with his name.&quot; In still later years, Singh, an atheist and socialist in adulthood, won admirers in India from among a political spectrum that included both communists and right-wing Hindu nationalists. Although many of Singh&#x27;s associates, as well as many Indian anti-colonial revolutionaries, were also involved in daring acts and were either executed or died violent deaths, few came to be lionised in popular art and literature as did Singh, who is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Shaheed-e-Azam&quot; (&quot;Great martyr&quot; in Urdu and Punjabi).

== Early life ==
Bhagat Singh was born into a Punjabi Jat Sikh family on 27 September 1907 in the village of Banga in the Lyallpur district of the Punjab in what was then British India and is today Pakistan; he was the second of seven children—four sons, and three daughters—born to Vidyavati and her husband Kishan Singh Sandhu. Bhagat Singh&#x27;s father and his uncle Ajit Singh were active in progressive politics, taking part in the agitation around the Canal Colonization Bill in 1907, and later the Ghadar Movement of 1914–1915. 

After being sent to the village school in Banga for a few years, Bhagat Singh was enrolled in the Dayanand Anglo-Vedic School in Lahore. In 1923, he joined the National College in Lahore, founded two years earlier by Lala Lajpat Rai in response to Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s non-cooperation movement, which urged Indian students to shun schools and colleges subsidized by the British Indian government.

Police became concerned with Singh&#x27;s influence on the youth and arrested him in May 1927 on the pretext that he had been involved in a bombing that had taken place in Lahore in October 1926. He was released on a surety of Rs. 60,000 five weeks after his arrest. He wrote for, and edited, Urdu and Punjabi newspapers, published in Amritsar and also contributed to low-priced pamphlets published by the Naujawan Bharat Sabha that excoriated the British. He also wrote for &quot;Kirti&quot;, the journal of the Kirti Kisan Party (&quot;Workers and Peasants Party&quot;) and briefly for the &quot;Veer Arjun&quot; newspaper, published in Delhi. He often used pseudonyms, including names such as Balwant, Ranjit and Vidhrohi.

== Revolutionary activities ==
=== Killing of John Saunders ===
In 1928, the British government set up the Simon Commission to report on the political situation in India. Some Indian political parties boycotted the Commission because there were no Indians in its membership, and there were protests across the country. When the Commission visited Lahore on 30 October 1928, Lala Lajpat Rai led a march in protest against it. Police attempts to disperse the large crowd resulted in violence. The superintendent of police, James A. Scott, ordered the police to lathi charge (use batons against) the protesters and personally assaulted Rai, who was injured. Rai died of a heart attack on 17 November 1928. Doctors thought that his death might have been hastened by the injuries he had received. When the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the British Government denied any role in Rai&#x27;s death.

Singh was a prominent member of the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA) and was probably responsible, in large part, for its change of name to Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928. The HSRA vowed to avenge Rai&#x27;s death. Singh conspired with revolutionaries like Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and Chandrashekhar Azad to kill Scott. However, in a case of mistaken identity, the plotters shot John P. Saunders, an Assistant Superintendent of Police, as he was leaving the District Police Headquarters in Lahore on 17 December 1928.

Contemporary reaction to the killing differs substantially from the adulation that later surfaced. The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, which had organised the Lahore protest march along with the HSRA, found that attendance at its subsequent public meetings dropped sharply. Politicians, activists, and newspapers, including &quot;The People&quot;, which Rai had founded in 1925, stressed that non-cooperation was preferable to violence. The murder was condemned as a retrograde action by Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress leader, but Jawaharlal Nehru later expressed his opinion in these words: 

=== Killing of Channan Singh ===
After killing Saunders, the group escaped through the D.A.V. College entrance, across the road from the District Police Headquarters. Chanan Singh, a Head Constable who was chasing them, was shot dead by Chandrashekhar Azad. They then fled on bicycles to pre-arranged safe houses. The police launched a massive search operation to catch them, blocking all entrances and exits to and from the city; the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) kept a watch on all young men leaving Lahore. The fugitives hid for the next two days. On 19 December 1928, Sukhdev called on Durgawati Devi, sometimes known as Durga Bhabhi, wife of another HSRA member, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, for help, which she agreed to provide. They decided to catch the train departing from Lahore to Bathinda en route to Howrah (Calcutta) early the next morning.

=== Escape from Lahore ===
Bhagat Singh and Rajguru, both carrying loaded revolvers, left the house early the next day. Dressed in Western attire (Bhagat Singh cut his hair, shaved his beard and wore a hat over cropped hair), and carrying Devi&#x27;s sleeping child, Singh and Devi passed as a young couple, while Rajguru carried their luggage as their servant. At the station, Singh managed to conceal his identity while buying tickets, and the three boarded the train heading to Cawnpore (now Kanpur). There they boarded a train for Lucknow since the CID at Howrah railway station usually scrutinised passengers on the direct train from Lahore. At Lucknow, Rajguru left separately for Benares while Singh, Devi and the infant went to Howrah, with all except Singh returning to Lahore a few days later.

=== Delhi Assembly bombing and arrest ===
For some time, Bhagat Singh had been exploiting the power of drama as a means to inspire the revolt against the British, purchasing a magic lantern to show slides that enlivened his talks about revolutionaries such as Ram Prasad Bismil who had died as a result of the Kakori conspiracy. In 1929, he proposed a dramatic act to the HSRA intended to gain massive publicity for their aims. Influenced by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist who had bombed the Chamber of Deputies in Paris, Singh&#x27;s plan was to explode a bomb inside the Central Legislative Assembly. The nominal intention was to protest against the Public Safety Bill, and the Trade Dispute Act, which had been rejected by the Assembly but were being enacted by the Viceroy using his special powers; the actual intention was for the perpetrators to allow themselves to be arrested so that they could use court appearances as a stage to publicise their cause.

The HSRA leadership was initially opposed to Bhagat&#x27;s participation in the bombing because they were certain that his prior involvement in the Saunders shooting meant that his arrest would ultimately result in his execution. However, they eventually decided that he was their most suitable candidate. On 8 April 1929, Singh, accompanied by Batukeshwar Dutt, threw two bombs into the Assembly chamber from its public gallery while it was in session. The bombs had been designed not to kill, but some members, including George Ernest Schuster, the finance member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Executive Council, were injured. The smoke from the bombs filled the Assembly so that Singh and Dutt could probably have escaped in the confusion had they wished. Instead, they stayed shouting the slogan &quot;Inquilab Zindabad!&quot; (&quot;Long Live the Revolution&quot;) and threw leaflets. The two men were arrested and subsequently moved through a series of jails in Delhi.

=== Assembly case trial ===
According to Neeti Nair, &quot;public criticism of this terrorist action was unequivocal.&quot; Gandhi, once again, issued strong words of disapproval of their deed. Nonetheless, the jailed Bhagat was reported to be elated, and referred to the subsequent legal proceedings as a &quot;drama&quot;. Singh and Dutt eventually responded to the criticism by writing the Assembly Bomb Statement: 

The trial began in the first week of June, following a preliminary hearing in May. On 12 June, both men were sentenced to life imprisonment for: &quot;causing explosions of a nature likely to endanger life, unlawfully and maliciously.&quot; Dutt had been defended by Asaf Ali, while Singh defended himself. Doubts have been raised about the accuracy of testimony offered at the trial. One key discrepancy concerns the automatic pistol that Singh had been carrying when he was arrested. Some witnesses said that he had fired two or three shots while the police sergeant who arrested him testified that the gun was pointed downward when he took it from him and that Singh &quot;was playing with it.&quot; According to an article in the &quot;India Law Journal&quot;, the prosecution witnesses were coached, their accounts were incorrect, and Singh had turned over the pistol himself. Singh was given a life sentence.

==== Arrest of associates ====
In 1929, the HSRA had set up bomb factories in Lahore and Saharanpur. On 15 April 1929, the Lahore bomb factory was discovered by the police, leading to the arrest of other members of HSRA, including Sukhdev, Kishori Lal, and Jai Gopal. Not long after this, the Saharanpur factory was also raided and some of the conspirators became informants. With the new information available, the police were able to connect the three strands of the Saunders murder, Assembly bombing, and bomb manufacture. Singh, Sukhdev, Rajguru, and 21 others were charged with the Saunders murder.

==== Hunger strike and Lahore conspiracy case ====
Singh was re-arrested for murdering Saunders and Chanan Singh based on substantial evidence against him, including statements by his associates, Hans Raj Vohra and Jai Gopal. His life sentence in the Assembly Bomb case was deferred until the Saunders case was decided. He was sent to Central Jail Mianwali from the Delhi jail. There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, to be a political prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper. They argued that they should not be forced to do manual labour or any undignified work in the jail.

The hunger strike inspired a rise in public support for Singh and his colleagues from around June 1929. &quot;The Tribune&quot; newspaper was particularly prominent in this movement and reported on mass meetings in places such as Lahore and Amritsar. The government had to apply Section 144 of the criminal code in an attempt to limit gatherings.

Jawaharlal Nehru met Singh and the other strikers in Central Jail Mianwali. After the meeting, he stated:
Muhammad Ali Jinnah spoke in support of the strikers in the Assembly, saying: 

The government tried to break the strike by placing different food items in the prison cells to test the prisoners&#x27; resolve. Water pitchers were filled with milk so that either the prisoners remained thirsty or broke their strike; nobody faltered and the impasse continued. The authorities then attempted force-feeding the prisoners but this was resisted. With the matter still unresolved, the Indian Viceroy, Lord Irwin, cut short his vacation in Simla to discuss the situation with jail authorities. Since the activities of the hunger strikers had gained popularity and attention nationwide, the government decided to advance the start of the Saunders murder trial, which was henceforth called the Lahore Conspiracy Case. Singh was transported to Borstal Jail, Lahore, and the trial began there on 10 July 1929. In addition to charging them with the murder of Saunders, Singh and the 27 other prisoners were charged with plotting a conspiracy to murder Scott, and waging a war against the King. Singh, still on hunger strike, had to be carried to the court handcuffed on a stretcher; he had lost from his original weight of since beginning the strike.

The government was beginning to make concessions but refused to move on the core issue of recognising the classification of &quot;political prisoner&quot;. In the eyes of officials, if someone broke the law then that was a personal act, not a political one, and they were common criminals. By now, the condition of another hunger striker, Jatindra Nath Das, lodged in the same jail, had deteriorated considerably. The Jail committee recommended his unconditional release, but the government rejected the suggestion and offered to release him on bail. On 13 September 1929, Das died after a 63-day hunger strike. Almost all the nationalist leaders in the country paid tribute to Das&#x27; death. Mohammad Alam and Gopi Chand Bhargava resigned from the Punjab Legislative Council in protest, and Nehru moved a successful adjournment motion in the Central Assembly as a censure against the &quot;inhumane treatment&quot; of the Lahore prisoners. Singh finally heeded a resolution of the Congress party, and a request by his father, ending his hunger strike on 5 October 1929 after 116 days. During this period, Singh&#x27;s popularity among common Indians extended beyond Punjab.

Singh&#x27;s attention now turned to his trial, where he was to face a Crown prosecution team comprising C. H. Carden-Noad, Kalandar Ali Khan, Jai Gopal Lal, and the prosecuting inspector, Bakshi Dina Nath. The defence was composed of eight lawyers. Prem Dutt Verma, the youngest amongst the 27 accused, threw his slipper at Gopal when he turned and became a prosecution witness in court. As a result, the magistrate ordered that all the accused should be handcuffed. Singh and others refused to be handcuffed and were subjected to brutal beating. The revolutionaries refused to attend the court and Singh wrote a letter to the magistrate citing various reasons for their refusal. The magistrate ordered the trial to proceed without the accused or members of the HSRA. This was a setback for Singh as he could no longer use the trial as a forum to publicise his views.

==== Special Tribunal ====
To speed up the slow trial, the Viceroy, Lord Irwin, declared an emergency on 1 May 1930 and introduced an ordinance to set up a special tribunal composed of three high court judges for the case. This decision cut short the normal process of justice as the only appeal after the tribunal was to the Privy Council located in England.

On 2 July 1930, a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition was filed in the High Court challenging the ordinance on the grounds that it was &quot;ultra vires&quot; and, therefore, illegal; the Viceroy had no powers to shorten the customary process of determining justice. The petition argued that the Defence of India Act 1915 allowed the Viceroy to introduce an ordinance, and set up such a tribunal, only under conditions of a breakdown of law-and-order, which, it was claimed in this case, had not occurred. However, the petition was dismissed as being premature.

Carden-Noad presented the government&#x27;s charges of conducting robberies, and the illegal acquisition of arms and ammunition among others. The evidence of G. T. H. Hamilton Harding, the Lahore superintendent of police, shocked the court. He stated that he had filed the first information report against the accused under specific orders from the chief secretary to the governor of Punjab and that he was unaware of the details of the case. The prosecution depended mainly on the evidence of P. N. Ghosh, Hans Raj Vohra, and Jai Gopal who had been Singh&#x27;s associates in the HSRA. On 10 July 1930, the tribunal decided to press charges against only 15 of the 18 accused and allowed their petitions to be taken up for hearing the next day. The trial ended on 30 September 1930. The three accused, whose charges were withdrawn, included Dutt who had already been given a life sentence in the Assembly bomb case.

The ordinance (and the tribunal) would lapse on 31 October 1930 as it had not been passed by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament. On 7 October 1930, the tribunal delivered its 300-page judgement based on all the evidence and concluded that the participation of Singh, Sukhdev, and Shivaram Rajguru in Saunder&#x27;s murder was proven. They were sentenced to death by hanging. Of the other accused, three were acquitted (Ajoy Ghosh, Jatindra Nath Sanyal and Des Raj) Kundan Lal received seven years&#x27; rigorous imprisonment, Prem Dutt received five years of the same, and the remaining seven Kishori Lal, Mahavir Singh, Bijoy Kumar Sinha, Shiv Verma, Gaya Prasad, Jaidev Kapoor and Kamal Nath Tewari were all sentenced to transportation for life.

==== Appeal to the Privy Council ====
In Punjab province, a defence committee drew up a plan to appeal to the Privy Council. Singh was initially against the appeal but later agreed to it in the hope that the appeal would popularise the HSRA in Britain. The appellants claimed that the ordinance which created the tribunal was invalid while the government countered that the Viceroy was completely empowered to create such a tribunal. The appeal was dismissed by Judge Viscount Dunedin.

==== Reactions to the judgement ====
After the rejection of the appeal to the Privy Council, Congress party president Madan Mohan Malaviya filed a mercy appeal before Irwin on 14 February 1931. Some prisoners sent Mahatma Gandhi an appeal to intervene. In his notes dated 19 March 1931, the Viceroy recorded:

The Communist Party of Great Britain expressed its reaction to the case:
A plan to rescue Singh and fellow HSRA inmates from the jail failed. HSRA member Durga Devi&#x27;s husband, Bhagwati Charan Vohra, attempted to manufacture bombs for the purpose, but died when they exploded accidentally.

=== Execution ===

Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev were sentenced to death in the Lahore conspiracy case and ordered to be hanged on 24 March 1931. The schedule was moved forward by 11 hours and the three were hanged on 23 March 1931 at 7:30 pm in the Lahore jail. It is reported that no magistrate at the time was willing to supervise Singh&#x27;s hanging as was required by law. The execution was supervised instead by an honorary judge named Nawab Muhammad Ahmed Khan Kasuri, who also signed the three death warrants, as their original warrants had expired. The jail authorities then broke a hole in the rear wall of the jail, removed the bodies, and secretly cremated the three men under cover of darkness outside Ganda Singh Wala village, and then threw the ashes into the Sutlej river, about from Ferozepore.

==== Criticism of the tribunal trial ====
Singh&#x27;s trial has been described by the Supreme Court as &quot;contrary to the fundamental doctrine of criminal jurisprudence&quot; because there was no opportunity for the accused to defend themselves. The Special Tribunal was a departure from the normal procedure adopted for a trial and its decision could only be appealed to the Privy Council located in Britain. The accused were absent from the court and the judgement was passed &quot;ex-parte&quot;. The ordinance, which was introduced by the Viceroy to form the Special Tribunal, was never approved by the Central Assembly or the British Parliament, and it eventually lapsed without any legal or constitutional sanctity.

==== Reactions to the executions ====

The executions were reported widely by the press, especially as they took place on the eve of the annual convention of the Congress party at Karachi. Gandhi faced black flag demonstrations by angry youths who shouted &quot;Down with Gandhi&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported:
Hartals and strikes of mourning were called. The Congress party, during the Karachi session, declared:
In the issue of &quot;Young India&quot; of 29 March 1931, Gandhi wrote:
==== Gandhi&#x27;s role====
On 23 March, Mahatama Gandhi had written a letter to viceroy appealing for commutation for the death sentences against Bhagat Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru. While there have been unfounded claims that Gandhi had an opportunity to stop Singh&#x27;s execution, it is held that Gandhi did not have enough influence with the British to stop the execution, much less arrange it, but that he did his best to save Singh&#x27;s life. Gandhi supporters assert that Singh&#x27;s role in the independence movement was no threat to Gandhi&#x27;s role as its leader, so he would have no reason to want him dead. Gandhi always maintained that he was a great admirer of Singh&#x27;s patriotism. He also stated that he was opposed to Singh&#x27;s execution (and for that matter, capital punishment in general) and proclaimed that he had no power to stop it. Of Singh&#x27;s execution Gandhi said: &quot;The government certainly had the right to hang these men. However, there are some rights which do credit to those who possess them only if they are enjoyed in name only.&quot; Gandhi also once remarked about capital punishment: &quot;I cannot in all conscience agree to anyone being sent to the gallows. God alone can take life, because he alone gives it.&quot; Gandhi had managed to have 90,000 political prisoners, who were not members of his Satyagraha movement, released under the Gandhi–Irwin Pact. According to a report in the Indian magazine &quot;Frontline&quot;, he did plead several times for the commutation of the death sentences of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev, including a personal visit on 19 March 1931. In a letter to the Viceroy on the day of their execution, he pleaded fervently for commutation, not knowing that the letter would arrive too late. Lord Irwin, the Viceroy, later said:
== Ideals and opinions ==
=== Communism ===
Singh regarded Kartar Singh Sarabha, a founding-member of the Ghadar Party as his hero. Bhagat was also inspired by Bhai Parmanand, another founding-member of the Ghadar Party. Singh was attracted to anarchism and communism. He was an avid reader of the teachings of Mikhail Bakunin and also read Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. In his last testament, &quot;To Young Political Workers&quot;, he declares his ideal as the &quot;Social reconstruction on new, i.e., Marxist, basis&quot;. Singh did not believe in the Gandhian ideology – which advocated Satyagraha and other forms of non-violent resistance, and felt that such politics would replace one set of exploiters with another.

From May to September 1928, Singh published a series of articles on anarchism in &quot;Kirti&quot;. He was concerned that the public misunderstood the concept of anarchism, writing that: &quot;The people are scared of the word anarchism. The word anarchism has been abused so much that even in India revolutionaries have been called anarchist to make them unpopular.&quot; He clarified that anarchism refers to the absence of a ruler and abolition of the state, not the absence of order. He went on to say: &quot;I think in India the idea of universal brotherhood, the Sanskrit sentence &quot;Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam&quot; etc., has the same meaning.&quot; He believed that: 

On 21 January 1930, during the trial of the Lahore Conspiracy Case, Bhagat Singh and his HSRA comrades, appeared in the court wearing red scarves. When the magistrate took his chair, they raised slogans &quot;Long Live Socialist Revolution&quot;, &quot;Long Live Communist International&quot;, &quot;Long Live People&quot; &quot;Lenin&#x27;s Name Will Never Die&quot;, and &quot;Down with Imperialism&quot;. Bhagat Singh then read the text of a telegram in the court and asked the magistrate to send it to the Third International. The telegram stated: 

Historian K. N. Panikkar described Singh as one of the early Marxists in India. The political theorist Jason Adams notes that he was more enamoured with Lenin than with Marx. From 1926 onward, he studied the history of the revolutionary movements in India and abroad. In his prison notebooks, he quoted Lenin in reference to imperialism and capitalism and also the revolutionary thoughts of Trotsky.

On the day of his execution, Bhagat Singh was reading the book, &quot;Reminiscences of Lenin&quot;, authored by Clara Zetkin, a German Marxist. When asked what his last wish was, Singh replied that he was studying the life of Lenin and he wanted to finish it before his death.

=== Atheism ===
Singh began to question religious ideologies after witnessing the Hindu–Muslim riots that broke out after Gandhi disbanded the Non-Cooperation Movement. He did not understand how members of these two groups, initially united in fighting against the British, could be at each other&#x27;s throats because of their religious differences. At this point, Singh dropped his religious beliefs, since he believed religion hindered the revolutionaries&#x27; struggle for independence, and began studying the works of Bakunin, Lenin, Trotsky – all atheist revolutionaries. He also took an interest in Soham Swami&#x27;s book &quot;Common Sense&quot;.

While in prison in 1930–31, Bhagat Singh was approached by Randhir Singh, a fellow inmate, and a Sikh leader who would later found the Akhand Kirtani Jatha. According to Bhagat Singh&#x27;s close associate Shiva Verma, who later compiled and edited his writings, Randhir Singh tried to convince Bhagat Singh of the existence of God, and upon failing berated him: &quot;You are giddy with fame and have developed an ego that is standing like a black curtain between you and God&quot;. In response, Bhagat Singh wrote an essay entitled &quot;Why I Am an Atheist&quot; to address the question of whether his atheism was born out of vanity. In the essay, he defended his own beliefs and said that he used to be a firm believer in the Almighty, but could not bring himself to believe the myths and beliefs that others held close to their hearts. He acknowledged the fact that religion made death easier, but also said that unproven philosophy is a sign of human weakness. In this context, he noted:
Towards the end of the essay, Bhagat Singh wrote:
=== &quot;Killing the ideas&quot; ===
In the leaflet he threw in the Central Assembly on 8 April 1929, he stated: &quot;It is easy to kill individuals but you cannot kill the ideas. Great empires crumbled, while the ideas survived.&quot; While in prison, Singh and two others had written a letter to Lord Irwin, wherein they asked to be treated as prisoners of war and consequently to be executed by firing squad and not by hanging. Prannath Mehta, Singh&#x27;s friend, visited him in the jail on 20 March, three days before his execution, with a draft letter for clemency, but he declined to sign it.

== Influence ==

Subhas Chandra Bose said that: &quot;Bhagat Singh had become the symbol of the new awakening among the youths.&quot; Nehru acknowledged that Bhagat Singh&#x27;s popularity was leading to a new national awakening, saying: &quot;He was a clean fighter who faced his enemy in the open field ... he was like a spark that became a flame in a short time and spread from one end of the country to the other dispelling the prevailing darkness everywhere&quot;. Four years after Singh&#x27;s hanging, the Director of the Intelligence Bureau, Horace Williamson, wrote: &quot;His photograph was on sale in every city and township and for a time rivaled in popularity even that of Mr. Gandhi himself&quot;.

== Legacy and memorials ==

Bhagat Singh remains a significant figure in Indian iconography to the present day. His memory, however, defies categorisation and presents problems for various groups that might try to appropriate it. Pritam Singh, a professor who has specialised in the study of federalism, nationalism and development in India, notes that 
* On 15 August 2008, an 18-foot tall bronze statue of Singh was installed in the Parliament of India, next to the statues of Indira Gandhi and Subhas Chandra Bose. A portrait of Singh and Dutt also adorns the walls of the Parliament House.

* The place where Singh was cremated, at Hussainiwala on the banks of the Sutlej river, became Pakistani territory during the partition. On 17 January 1961, it was transferred to India in exchange for 12 villages near the Sulemanki Headworks. Batukeshwar Dutt was cremated there on 19 July 1965 in accordance with his last wishes, as was Singh&#x27;s mother, Vidyawati. The National Martyrs Memorial was built on the cremation spot in 1968 and has memorials of Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. During the 1971 India–Pakistan war, the memorial was damaged and the statues of the martyrs were removed by the Pakistani Army. They have not been returned but the memorial was rebuilt in 1973.
* The &quot;Shaheedi Mela&quot; (Punjabi: Martyrdom Fair) is an event held annually on 23 March when people pay homage at the National Martyrs Memorial. The day is also observed across the Indian state of Punjab.
* The Shaheed-e-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh Museum opened on the 50th anniversary of his death at his ancestral village, Khatkar Kalan. Exhibits include Singh&#x27;s ashes, the blood-soaked sand, and the blood-stained newspaper in which the ashes were wrapped. A page of the first Lahore Conspiracy Case&#x27;s judgement in which Kartar Singh Sarabha was sentenced to death and on which Singh put some notes is also displayed, as well as a copy of the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; with Bhagat Singh&#x27;s signature, which was given to him in the Lahore Jail, and other personal belongings.
* The Bhagat Singh Memorial was built in 2009 in Khatkar Kalan at a cost of .
* The Supreme Court of India established a museum to display landmarks in the history of India&#x27;s judicial system, displaying records of some historic trials. The first exhibition that was organised was the Trial of Bhagat Singh, which opened on 28 September 2007, on the centenary celebrations of Singh&#x27;s birth.

=== Modern days ===

The youth of India still draw tremendous amount of inspiration from Singh. He was voted the &quot;Greatest Indian&quot; in a poll by the Indian magazine &quot;India Today&quot; in 2008, ahead of Bose and Gandhi. During the centenary of his birth, a group of intellectuals set up an institution named Bhagat Singh Sansthan to commemorate him and his ideals. The Parliament of India paid tributes and observed silence as a mark of respect in memory of Singh on 23 March 2001 and 2005. In Pakistan, after a long-standing demand by activists from the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation of Pakistan, the Shadman Chowk square in Lahore, where he was hanged, was renamed as Bhagat Singh Chowk. This change was successfully challenged in a Pakistani court. On 6 September 2015, the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation filed a petition in the Lahore high court and again demanded the renaming of the Chowk to Bhagat Singh Chowk.

==== Films and television ====
Several films have been made portraying the life and times of Singh. The first film based on his life was &quot;Shaheed-e-Azad Bhagat Singh&quot; (1954) in which Prem Adeeb played the role of Singh followed by &quot;Shaheed Bhagat Singh&quot; (1963), starring Shammi Kapoor as Bhagat Singh, &quot;Shaheed&quot; (1965) in which Manoj Kumar portrayed Bhagat Singh and &quot;Amar Shaheed Bhagat Singh&quot; (1974) in which Som Dutt portrays Singh. Three films about Singh were released in 2002 &quot;Shaheed-E-Azam&quot;, &quot;23 March 1931: Shaheed&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot; in which Singh was portrayed by Sonu Sood, Bobby Deol and Ajay Devgn respectively. &quot;Bhagat Singh&quot; (2002), a drama film directed by Anand Sagar and written/produced Ramanand Sagar was aired on DD National. It featured Deepak Dutta in the titular role.

Siddharth played the role of Bhagat Singh in the 2006 film &quot;Rang De Basanti&quot;, a film drawing parallels between revolutionaries of Bhagat Singh&#x27;s era and modern Indian youth. A similar approach was taken in the independent film, among others, &quot;Shaheed-E-Aazam&quot; (2018) about freedom fighter Kamal Nath Tiwari where Rahul Pathak played Singh&#x27;s role. Gurdas Mann played the role of Singh in &quot;Shaheed Udham Singh&quot;, a film based on life of Udham Singh while Amol Parashar portrayed Singh in Sardar Udham, another film based on Udham Singh&#x27;s life. Karam Rajpal portrayed Bhagat Singh in Star Bharat&#x27;s television series &quot;Chandrashekhar&quot;, which is based on life of Chandra Shekhar Azad. &quot;Shaheed Chandra Shekhar Azaad&quot; (2020) and &quot;Hero of Nation Chandra Shekhar Azad&quot; (2022) are films about Azad which include portrayals of Singh, where he is portrayed by Rishabh Raj and Vivek Mishra respectively.

In 2008, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library (NMML) and Act Now for Harmony and Democracy (ANHAD), a non-profit organisation, co-produced a 40-minute documentary on Bhagat Singh entitled &quot;Inqilab&quot;, directed by Gauhar Raza.

==== Theatre ====
Singh, Sukhdev and Rajguru have been the inspiration for a number of plays in India and Pakistan, that continue to attract crowds.

==== Songs ====
Although not written by Singh, the patriotic Hindustani songs, &quot;Sarfaroshi Ki Tamanna&quot; (&quot;The desire to sacrifice&quot;) created by Bismil Azimabadi, and &quot;Mera Rang De Basanti Chola&quot; (&quot;O Mother! Dye my robe the colour of spring&quot;) created by Ram Prasad Bismil, are largely associated with him and have been used in a number of related films.

==== Other ====
In 1968, a postage stamp was issued in India commemorating the 61st birth anniversary of Singh. A ₹5 coin commemorating him was released for circulation in 2012.

<doc id="1150749" wikidata="Q7894189" url="?curid=1150749" title="Universalizability">
<text>The concept of universalizability was set out by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant as part of his work &quot;Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals&quot;. It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law.

The precise meaning of universalizability is contentious, but the most common interpretation is that the categorical imperative asks whether the maxim of your action could become one that everyone could act upon in similar circumstances. An action is socially acceptable if it can be universalized (i.e., everyone could do it).

For instance, one can determine whether a maxim of lying to secure a loan is moral by attempting to universalize it and applying reason to the results. If everyone lied to secure loans, the very practices of promising and lending would fall apart, and the maxim would then become impossible.

Kant calls such acts examples of a contradiction in conception, which is much like a performative contradiction, because they undermine the very basis for their existence.

Kant&#x27;s notion of universalizability has a clear antecedent in Rousseau&#x27;s idea of a general will. Both notions provide for a radical separation of will and nature, leading to the idea that true freedom lies substantially in self-legislation.

<doc id="1150755" wikidata="Q7755641" url="?curid=1150755" title="The Outcasts of Poker Flat">
<text>&quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flat&quot; (1869) is a short story written by author of the American West Bret Harte. An example of naturalism and local color of California during the first half of the nineteenth century, the story was first published in January 1869 in the magazine &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;. It was one of two short stories which brought the author national attention.

==Plot==
The story takes place in a Californian community known as Poker Flat, near the town of La Porte. Following the loss of several thousand dollars and two horses, and the death of a notable resident, the town has formed a secret committee to rid itself of any &quot;improper&quot; people, hanging two and banishing others. On November 23, 1850, four such individuals are exiled from Poker Flat and warned not to return on pain of death. The first of them is a professional poker player, John Oakhurst, who has won large amounts from those on the secret committee. On his way out of town, he is joined by two women, the Duchess and Mother Shipton, and Uncle Billy, the town drunk and a suspected robber. These four set out for the Sandy Bar mining camp, a day&#x27;s journey away over a mountain range. At noon, over Oakhurst&#x27;s protests, the group stops for a rest.

While on their rest, the group is met by a pair of runaway lovers on their way to Poker Flat to get married, Tom Simson (known also as &quot;The Innocent&quot;) and 15-year-old Piney Woods. Simson has met Oakhurst before and has great admiration for him, as Oakhurst won a great deal of money from Simson. Oakhurst had returned the money and urged Simson to quit gambling, as he was a terrible player. Nonetheless, Simson is thrilled to have come upon Oakhurst on this day and decides that he and Piney will stay with the group for a while. They are unaware of the group&#x27;s status as exiles, and Simson assumes that the Duchess is Oakhurst&#x27;s wife, to the amusement of Uncle Billy.

A decision is made for everyone to stay the night together, and the group takes shelter in a half-built cabin Simson has discovered. In the middle of the night, Oakhurst wakes up and sees a heavy snowstorm raging. Looking around, he realizes that Uncle Billy has fled with the group&#x27;s horses and mules. They are all now forced to wait out the storm with provisions that will likely only last for another 10 days. After a week in the cabin, Mother Shipton dies, having secretly and altruistically starved herself in order to give her rations to Piney. Oakhurst fashions some snowshoes for Simson to use in traveling to Poker Flat for help, telling the others he will accompany the young man part of the way. The &quot;law of Poker Flat&quot; finally arrives at the cabin, only to find the Duchess and Piney frozen to death and embracing in a peaceful repose. They look so peaceful and innocent that the onlookers cannot tell which of them had been exiled for her immoral behavior.

Oakhurst commits suicide under a tree by shooting himself through the heart with his derringer. A playing card, the two of clubs, is found pinned to the trunk with a note written on it:

BENEATH THIS TREE
LIES THE BODY 
OF 
JOHN OAKHURST, 
WHO STRUCK A STREAK OF BAD LUCK 
ON THE 23rd OF NOVEMBER, 1850, 
AND 
HANDED IN HIS CHECKS 
ON THE 7TH DECEMBER, 1850.
==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
Harte&#x27;s story has been brought to film at least five times, including in 1919 with Harry Carey, in 1937 with Preston Foster, and in 1952 with Dale Robertson. The Spaghetti Western &quot;Four of the Apocalypse&quot; is based on this story and another of Harte&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Luck of Roaring Camp&quot;.

Operas based on &quot;The Outcasts of Poker Flats&quot; include those by Samuel Adler, Jaromir Weinberger, Stanworth Beckler, and Andrew Earle Simpson.

<doc id="1150768" wikidata="Q1548386" url="?curid=1150768" title="Great Salt Lake Desert">
<text>The Great Salt Lake Desert (colloquially referred to as the West Desert) is a large dry lake in northern Utah, United States, between the Great Salt Lake and the Nevada border. It is a subregion of the larger Great Basin Desert, and noted for white evaporite Lake Bonneville salt deposits including the Bonneville Salt Flats.

==Description==

Several small mountain ranges occupy the edges of the desert, such as the Cedar Mountains, Lakeside Mountains, Silver Island Mountains, Hogup Mountains, Grassy Mountains, and Newfoundland Mountains. On the western edge of the desert, just across the border in Nevada, stands Pilot Peak in the Pilot Range.

The desert is cool during the winter and includes unusual plants adapted to the dry conditions. Most of the desert receives less than of annual precipitation. The salt crust covering the desert reforms yearly when the rain evaporates. The military&#x27;s Utah Test and Training Range is in the northern portion of the desert. The lowest part of Juab County is located just south of the Dugway Proving Grounds, about northwest of the northwest corner of the Fish Springs Range.

==History==
During Jedediah Smith&#x27;s 1826-27 expedition, Robert Evans nearly died while crossing the desert and in the 1840s, westward emigrants used the Hastings Cutoff through of Great Salt Lake desert to reduce the distance to California. The 1846 Donner Party&#x27;s difficulties in making the crossing contributed to their becoming snowbound in the Sierra Nevada. Howard Stansbury explored the desert in 1849. In 1956, I-80 replaced the Wendover Cut-off across the desert, including a straight east-west section for ~ between the Cedar Mountains to the east and Wendover on the Utah/Nevada border. Following a railway completed across the desert&#x27;s Bonneville Salt Flats in 1910, the flats were first used as a speedway in 1914. The world records for highest land speeds are regularly broken here.
== Recent discoveries ==
In July 2022, archaeologists discovered about 88 footprints had been left behind by humans at least 12,000 years ago using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). In the &quot;ghost tracks&quot;, as the archaeologists called them, the footprints absorb moisture and are only visible when it rains and disappear when dry.

==Climate==
The Great Salt Lake Desert experiences a desert climate with hot summers and cold winters. The desert is an excellent example of a cold desert climate. The desert&#x27;s elevation, 4,250 feet above sea level, makes temperatures cooler than lower elevation deserts, such as the Mojave. Due to the high elevation and aridity, temperatures drop sharply after sunset. Summer nights are comfortably cool. Winter highs are generally above freezing, and winter nights are bitterly cold, with temperatures often dropping below freezing.

<doc id="1150769" wikidata="Q1765236" url="?curid=1150769" title="20 Greatest Hits (Beatles album)">
<text>20 Greatest Hits is a compilation album featuring a selection of songs by The Beatles that were number one singles in the UK and US. It was released on 11 October 1982 in the United States and 18 October in the United Kingdom and marked the 20th anniversary of The Beatles&#x27; first record release, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, in the UK in October 1962. &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; was the last Beatles album to be released with variations between the U.S. and UK versions (some Beatles hits in the US were not released as singles in the UK, such as &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&quot;). There is an extremely rare 8 track tape version of this album, of which approximately 10 to 15 copies still exist today. Capitol Records decided not to release the album in the format, as 8 tracks were not selling well in late 1982. However, in early 1983, they made a few copies available through Capitol Special Markets.

The band&#x27;s 2000 compilation album &quot;1&quot; is a combination of both versions of &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot;.

==Releases==

===UK edition===
The UK version of the album comprised all 19 tracks from the 17 Beatles singles to top the UK Singles Chart (including both sides of the double A-sides &quot;Day Tripper&quot;/&quot;We Can Work It Out&quot; and &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;/&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;) plus the Beatles&#x27; first chart hit &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, which peaked at number 17 in the UK.

The songs were presented in their original stereo mixes except for &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;, which used the Duophonic versions – the last time a new Beatles release would use such mixes. Similarly to &quot;1962-1966&quot;, &quot;20 Greatest Hits&quot; uses the same &quot;whispering intro&quot; mix of &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;.

Although many documentaries state that the first number 1 of The Beatles in England was &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, the track does not appear in this collection, and also does not appear in the compilation &quot;1&quot;.

===US edition===
For the US LP, catalogue number SV 12245, a five-minute edited version of &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was used due to time constraints.

The American version of this LP was also released in other countries, although the track list does not reflect the local number ones. For instance, in Canada &quot;Can&#x27;t Buy Me Love&quot; only reached No. 3 on the CHUM singles charts, and the Canadian No. 1 hits &quot;All My Loving&quot; and &quot;This Boy&quot; are omitted.

The New Zealand version was the same as the American one although originally EMI (NZ) was going to issue the UK version. The covers were printed in New Zealand but the inner sleeve was imported from the U.S.

The original issues of this album accidentally indicates the running time of &quot;Yesterday&quot; as being 1:04 in length. Later issues have the correct 2:04 running time.

The album featured the first US appearance of &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;I Feel Fine&quot; in true stereo.

===Other versions===
In 1979 and 1980, a similar album called &quot;20 Golden Hits&quot; was issued in many countries outside Britain and the U.S.

In Australia, a 23-track alternate version of this album, with bonus EP, was issued titled &quot;The Number Ones&quot;, released in 1983.

This single-disc compilation was supplanted by the later single-CD album &quot;1&quot; with all 27 of the 28 Beatles songs that were number one on either side of the Atlantic including George Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Something&quot; that was absent from the original collection. Harrison&#x27;s &quot;For You Blue&quot;, the B-Side of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, which was also charted in the top spot by Billboard, was not included on that album.

== Track listing ==
All songs written by Lennon–McCartney

=== UK edition ===
=== US edition ===

Note: On the US Cassette (EMI-Capitol 4XV-12245) &quot;Penny Lane&quot; is track 13, but appears at the end of Side 1, rather than the beginning of Side 2. On the original United States LP and Canadian cassette versions of the album &quot;Hey Jude&quot; was edited 5:09 due to time constraints. The United States cassette edition contains the full version of the song.

<doc id="1150775" wikidata="Q241321" url="?curid=1150775" title="Stephen Warnock">
<text>Stephen Warnock (born 12 December 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a left-back.

Starting off his career at Liverpool, he went on to also represent Coventry City, Bradford City, Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers, Leeds United, Derby County, Wigan Athletic and Burton Albion during a career that spanned between 2002 and 2018. A full international between 2008 and 2010, he was capped twice by the England national team and was part of the nation&#x27;s squad at the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Club career==
===Liverpool===
Warnock was born in Ormskirk, Lancashire where, in his childhood, he played for Rufford Colts (based at St Bede&#x27;s RC High School) and also played for St Bede&#x27;s RC High School. Following his time spent in the Liverpool youth academy and England youth set up, with his first international cap in the under-16s, he had loan spells at Bradford City (where he scored his first career goal against Sheffield Wednesday) and Coventry City.

Warnock made his first-team debut for Liverpool against Grazer AK on 10 August 2004, in the first leg of a UEFA Champions League third qualifying round match.

In May 2005 he missed out on a place in the squad for the 2005 UEFA Champions League final, he was initially named in the squad but due to a mistake was removed by Rafa Benitez from the squad for the final.

In his second season, he was asked to play primarily at left back, in rotation with John Arne Riise. Warnock scored his only goal for Liverpool against Fulham in a 5–1 win on 15 March 2006.

===Blackburn Rovers===
In a media speculated swap deal, Blackburn&#x27;s captain Lucas Neill was reported to being changing clubs with Warnock in both summer 2006 and winter 2007. Eventually Neill joined West Ham United, while on 22 January 2007 Warnock joined Blackburn Rovers for an undisclosed fee believed to be £1.5 million. He made his debut in the FA Cup fourth round in a 4–0 away victory over Luton Town.

On 31 January 2007, he played his first Premier League match for Rovers against Chelsea. He was dismissed for the match after two cautions in the 2–1 victory over Sheffield United on 3 February 2007. Warnock scored his first goal for Blackburn in the 3–0 victory over Portsmouth on 25 February 2007.

On 11 April 2009, before Blackburn Rovers&#x27; match against Warnock&#x27;s former club Liverpool, Stephen presented a flower display displaying the numbers &#x27;96&#x27; in reference to the 96 Liverpool supporters who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989. Before the kick off Warnock presented the flowers in front of famous Spion Kop on behalf of Blackburn. This was greeted with chants of &#x27;Stephen Warnock&#x27; from the Kop.

===Aston Villa===
On 26 August 2009, it was confirmed that Aston Villa were in talks with Blackburn over a possible move for Warnock to the Villa Park club. The next day it was confirmed that Warnock had signed a four-year contract with Villa. He scored his first goal for Villa in the League Cup semi-final second leg victory over former club Blackburn Rovers on 20 January 2010, which ended 6–4 to Aston Villa.

From December 2010 onwards, Warnock was out of favour with Aston Villa manager Gérard Houllier and was forced to play with the reserve team. Warnock was widely expected to leave the club in the summer transfer window, with a number of teams reportedly interested in his signature. However, new manager Alex McLeish stated that he was impressed with Warnock&#x27;s &quot;phenomenal&quot; attitude, and stated he would be given a clean slate, as with other players excluded by Houllier, all but guaranteeing his place in the squad. On 15 October 2011, Warnock scored his first league goal away at Manchester City. Warnock made 34 appearances for Villa during the 2011–12 season, missing only three Premier League fixtures. During the 2012–13 season under new manager Paul Lambert, Warnock found his chances limited and was made to train with the development squad.

====Loan to Bolton Wanderers====
On 21 September 2012, Warnock joined Bolton Wanderers on a three-month loan deal. He was on the bench a day later in their 2–1 win against Sheffield Wednesday and made his debut in their next match, starting at left back in Bolton&#x27;s 1–0 defeat against Crystal Palace. In his second appearance, at home against Leeds United, Warnock gave away a penalty (which was subsequently scored) as the match finished 2–2. Warnock would play 15 times for Bolton before returning to Villa.

===Leeds United===
On transfer deadline day 31 January 2013, Warnock signed a two-and-a-half-year contract at Leeds United. He made his Leeds debut on 9 February 2013, playing the whole match in the club&#x27;s 2–2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Warnock scored his first goal from the penalty spot for Leeds on 2 March 2013 in a 1–0 win against Millwall. Warnock was named as captain in Brian McDermott&#x27;s first match in charge on 13 April against Sheffield Wednesday. Before joining Leeds, West Ham United manager Sam Allardyce revealed that Warnock had turned down signing for the Premier League club as Leeds had offered Warnock a longer contract.

In February 2014, in conditions such that, according to the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;, &quot;the ferocious wind was man-of-the-match and the rain would have stripped paint&quot;, Warnock&#x27;s free kick from distance was caught by the wind and dropped over the goalkeeper&#x27;s head to give Leeds a 2–1 win away to Yeovil Town.

Warnock scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against his former club Bolton on 30 August. During the course of the 2014–15 season, Warnock replaced Jason Pearce as the new Leeds captain. Warnock picked up an injury against Derby County on 30 December 2014, which kept Warnock out of the team and he was subsequently replaced at left back by Charlie Taylor, where Taylor came into the starting lineup for Leeds on 4 January 2015 in Leeds&#x27; FA Cup 1–0 defeat against Sunderland.

===Derby County===
On 15 January 2015, Warnock signed for Derby County for an undisclosed fee.

===Wigan Athletic===
Warnock joined Wigan Athletic on a one-year contract on 30 May 2016.

===Burton Albion===
On 26 June 2017, Warnock signed for Championship club Burton Albion on a free transfer on a one-year contract. He scored his first goal for Burton in a 2–1 win against Fulham on 16 September 2017.

=== Bradford City and retirement ===
On 26 January 2018, Warnock joined Bradford City on loan for the rest of the 2017–18 season. In April 2018, he announced that he would retire at the end of the season.

==International career==
Warnock was capped by the England schools team before making one appearance for the under-16s against Norway on 6 April 1998.

Despite having made relatively few first team appearances for Liverpool, Warnock was called into the senior England squad for the first time on 29 August 2005, due to lack of cover in the squad at left back. He was again called into the squad by England coach Fabio Capello in May 2008 for the friendlies against the United States and Trinidad and Tobago. He made his England debut against the latter on 1 June coming on as a substitute for Wayne Bridge in the 84th minute.

After impressing with Aston Villa in the early 2009–10 season Warnock received a call up to the international squad once more for a friendly against Egypt. On 11 May 2010, Warnock was named in the 30-man provisional squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. On 1 June 2010, he was named in the final 23-man selection by manager Fabio Capello, ahead of other left back Leighton Baines. Due to the widely accepted adeptness of Ashley Cole at left back, Warnock did not feature in any of England&#x27;s matches during their short-lived run in the World Cup which ended against Germany. On 7 June 2010, he played in a friendly match against Platinum Stars before the tournament. This does not count towards a full cap, as it was not played against a full international side. He made his second and final appearance for England against France in November 2010.

In May 2012, Scotland manager Craig Levein made an approach to Warnock to play for them. Warnock remained eligible for Scotland as his England caps all came in friendly matches.

==Media work==
Since his retirement, Warnock has become a regular football pundit on radio and television, covering the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League, Copa Libertadores, and EFL for the BBC, BT Sport, DAZN, Quest TV, and NBC Sports.

In 2024, Warnock took part in the Sky Sports News Real Talk series, where he opened up about his struggle with depression and suicidal thoughts following his retirement from football.

Recently, Warnock has been involved as a brand ambassador for Golfclubs4cash, Europe&#x27;s largest retailer of second hand golf equipment and accessories.

<text>The 4D was a prototype double deck electric multiple unit built for the Public Transport Corporation in Victoria, Australia, for operation on the Melbourne railway system. It remains the only double deck train to have ever operated in Melbourne. The train&#x27;s name stood for &quot;Double Deck Development and Demonstration.&quot;

Depending on sources, the intention was for this train to be the demonstration unit for a future order of either 20 or 50 extra sets, had the tests been successful.

==Design==

A tender for the design and construction of 19 double-deck trains was opened on 24 November 1989. The number of carriages to be built was at the discretion of the builder, however it had to comply with capacity and length requirements. By 11 April 1990, when the tender was closed, a number of tenders were received, including from Comeng and A Goninan &amp; Co. However, the project was stopped by the State Government, due to financial constraints. Instead, The Met was granted approval to acquire a single double-deck train for evaluation purposes. A contract was signed with Goninan in late 1990, for the delivery of a four carriage set.

Built in Broadmeadow, New South Wales, it was delivered by rail into Melbourne on 10 December 1991. After being bogie exchanged, it was transferred to Jolimont Workshops on 18 December of the same year, for an inspection and final fit out. Funding for the train was supplied from both the Victorian and Commonwealth governments.

The train&#x27;s design was based on the Tangara train being built by A Goninan &amp; Co for CityRail in Sydney, however it was similar only in terms of interior and exterior bodywork; the train&#x27;s electrical system was much closer to that of the Comeng sets. The design was further modified for use on Melbourne&#x27;s broad gauge track, and its control system was designed specifically to allow in-service coupling and operation with Comeng sets. In addition, the individual carriages were narrower and shorter in both length and width against their predecessors, to fit the Melbourne loading gauge. Altogether, it was 78 metres long; same length as a four-car Harris set, but seven metres shorter that a three-car Hitachi set.

It was manufactured from stainless steel and was fitted with air-conditioning, tinted windows, and inter-car doors, allowing passengers to access all carriages of the train. Much of the equipment matched Sydney&#x27;s Tangara fleet, from the traction motors (8x MB 3303B) down to small fittings like console buttons.

The four-car set had a total passenger capacity of 974 passengers (346 seated and 628 standing); considerably more than a three-car Comeng train of similar length, which would only hold 763 passengers in crush load conditions, including 263 seated. However, the set had about the same seating capacity as a Tait train - 10 seats per compartment, 34 compartments per four-carriage set, with no data available on crush loads.

As part of the trial, the Belgrave and Lilydale lines were selected as main testing grounds for the unit and necessary works were performed to accommodate the train&#x27;s somewhat unconventional dimensions. Preparations for the train occurred at Flinders Street and near the Princes Bridge in May 1991, when the tracks were lowered. The overhead wire to Belgrave and Lilydale was also altered, including the power feeds, and platforms were cut back where required. It was known that the train was physically too large for the Jolimont tunnel between Jolimont and West Richmond stations, on the Hurstbridge and Epping lines. Given that the train was a demonstrator, it was likely that production designs or future infrastructure plans would have dealt with this.

By early 1993, the Victorian Government had decided not to proceed with the acquisition of any further double deck trains, deciding infrastructure changes required to accommodate the larger trains were too expensive.

==Service==
The unit broke from Melbourne tradition by being configured as Driving Trailer-Motor-Motor-Driving Trailer (D-TM-TM-D); all other sets in service at the time were configured as Driving Motor-Trailer-Driving Motor (M-T-M). In a further break from tradition, the 4D did not use the &#x27;D&#x27; code for a driving trailer, instead it was coded simply as T-M-M-T. The car numbers were also placed far outside the usual range; the 4D was numbered as 6000T-5000M-5002M-6002T.

Most of the time the 4D was on the rails, it was parked in the stabling facilities at Bayswater, on the Belgrave line.

It first ran under its own power on 27 December 1991, when it conducted a test run to Lilydale and back. By January 1992, it was running tests coupled with a Comeng set, testing for performance, clearances and its effect on signalling. By 28 January of the same year, it was conducting tests between Bunyip and Longwarry, on the Gippsland line. Testing continued through February 1992.

On 5 March 1992, it was officially launched. It departed Flinders Street in the morning, running to Parliament station to collect the Minister for Transport and the awaiting media, before proceeding to Ringwood. On the return journey, it stopped at Box Hill and Camberwell. Throughout the remainder of the day, it conducted tours around the City Loop for Public Transport Corporation staff and their family members. Over the Labour Day weekend, this was repeated for the public.

It entered revenue service on 10 March 1992, after testing and a subsequent media launch. Eight trips were scheduled for its first day in service, the first being the 08:36 service from Flinders Street to Box Hill, followed by the 09:08 return, on which the train suffered door problems, the first of its many failures. This required the train to be removed from service at Camberwell, and the cancellation of the remaining trips.

Initially, the 4D was run coupled to a three-car Comeng set until 1996, when, after a troubled conversion to driver-only operation, it was permitted to operate on its own. Often as not, though, it was towed or pushed by a three or six-car Comeng set following a failure.

When the suburban system was split into two in 1998, in preparation for privatisation, it was allocated to Hillside Trains, which became Connex.

Throughout its 10 years in Melbourne, the 4D continued to be plagued by reliability issues that saw it constantly in and out of service. After its disappointing entry to service, the train saw little use and was in storage by 1999. It was revived in June 2000, but lasted only a year.

A final attempt was made on 22 February 2002 to return the set to service, but after three days, it again failed, and was placed back in storage, never to operate in revenue service again.

==Disposal==
Ownership of the 4D was transferred back to the Victorian Government&#x27;s Department of Infrastructure, and the set was moved under its own power to Newport Workshops in December 2002, for long-term storage.

By 2004, the set, which was once stored near the Australian Railway Historical Society&#x27;s railway museum, was transferred to the western side of the workshops, for a potential return to revenue service. However, this did not eventuate, and the 4D remained in storage.

In 2006, the 4D was purchased by RailCorp and stripped of parts compatible with the Tangaras. It was transferred by El Zorro to metal recyclers Sims Metal, Brooklyn for scrapping.

<doc id="1150787" wikidata="Q6838805" url="?curid=1150787" title="Mickey Thomas (singer)">
<text>John Michael Thomas (born December 3, 1949) is an American rock singer. He is best known as one of the lead vocalists of Jefferson Starship and Starship. Prior to joining Jefferson Starship, he was a member of Elvin Bishop&#x27;s band as a backing and occasional lead vocalist. He was the lead singer on Bishop&#x27;s best-known song, &quot;Fooled Around And Fell In Love.&quot;

==Early life==
John Michael Thomas was born in Cairo, Georgia, on December 3, 1949. He was inspired to pursue a career in music after traveling to Atlanta with longtime childhood friends Charles Connell and Tommy Verran to see a Beatles performance in 1965. Thomas, Connell, and Verran formed their first band together; Verran was the lead vocalist. They disbanded while attending different colleges, but later reformed in the early 1970s along with friend Bud Thomas as the Jets.

Thomas was the vocalist for the Lords of London, a garage band from Douglas, Georgia, for a brief time, along with guitarist Billy Folsom, bassist Bob Hutchinson, keyboardist Billy Corbi, and drummer Troy Blasingame.

==Career==

===Elvin Bishop Group===
While singing lead for the Jets in 1974, Thomas joined the Elvin Bishop Group as a backing vocalist and eventually made it to lead vocals. He sang lead vocals on the 1975 Elvin Bishop single &quot;Silent Night&quot; and the 1976 single &quot;Spend Some Time&quot;, but his best-known achievement was singing on Bishop&#x27;s chart hit &quot;Fooled Around and Fell in Love&quot;, a #3 single in 1976.

===Jefferson Starship &amp; Starship===
Thomas recorded the solo album &quot;As Long as You Love Me&quot; in 1976. After leaving the Elvin Bishop Group, he recorded three songs for the 1978 film &quot;Skateboard&quot;, which also featured a cameo by Jefferson Starship guitarist Craig Chaquico. In April 1979, Thomas was asked to join that group after the departure of Marty Balin and Grace Slick. In 1981 he recorded his second solo album, &quot;Alive Alone&quot;. Former Elvin Bishop Group drummer Donny Baldwin became drummer for Jefferson Starship two years later when Aynsley Dunbar left.

Thomas spent most of the early 1980s as the main vocalist of Jefferson Starship, performing several duets with Slick (who rejoined in 1981) and gaining greater influence in the band. After Paul Kantner left in 1984, Thomas was leader of the band. Kantner sued over the name of &quot;Jefferson Starship&quot;, and the settlement left the band with the name &quot;Starship&quot;. From 1985 until 1989 the band had three #1 hit songs. When Slick left again in 1988, Thomas sang all lead vocals. The 1989 &quot;Love Among the Cannibals&quot; tour was postponed after Baldwin attacked Thomas in a bar. The damage was such that it required facial reconstruction surgery. Baldwin resigned after the incident.

===Starship featuring Mickey Thomas===
Starship was let go by their record label RCA and became inactive in 1991. In early 1992, Mickey Thomas revived Starship as &quot;Starship featuring Mickey Thomas&quot; and touring has continued with this title. The band&#x27;s &quot;Loveless Fascination&quot; was released on September 17, 2013. The band performed at the Streamy Awards on September 8, 2014.

===Other work===

He was credited as performing a scat vocal on the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album &quot;The Dirt Band&quot;. The song on which Thomas is credited is &quot;For a Little While&quot;.

In 1985, Thomas appeared on &quot;The Heavenly Kid&quot; soundtrack performing the song &quot;Two Minute Love&quot;. In 1986, he recorded the song &quot;Stand in the Fire&quot; for the Rob Lowe hockey movie &quot;Youngblood&quot;. Thomas recorded the title song for the 1989 film &quot;Sing&quot;. He appeared in the 1989 film &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; and recorded the film&#x27;s title song and its duet version with Mel Tormé for the soundtrack. The duet version was also played during the end of the film.

In 1987, Thomas recorded &quot;Only the Fool Survives&quot; with Donna Summer for her album &quot;All Systems Go&quot;. Their duet was released as the album&#x27;s second single.

In 1996, Thomas performed the opening theme for the &quot;Mighty Ducks&quot; animated series. In 1997, he guested on Sammy Hagar&#x27;s album &quot;Marching to Mars&quot;.

in 1998, Thomas voiced the titular character in the children&#x27;s series, &quot;Adventures with Kanga Roddy&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Starship featuring Mickey Thomas&quot; re-recorded a selection of the Starship and Jefferson Starship hits on which he had appeared. The resulting album was released in 2003 as &quot;Forever Gold&quot;, part of a series of releases by St. Clair Entertainment Group. These recordings have been licensed to several labels, resulting in the release of &quot;Starship – Greatest Hits&quot; (Delta Records) and &quot;Starship – Greatest Hits&quot; (Brilliant Records). The original release of these recordings was as &quot;Starship – Greatest and Latest&quot;, available outside the U.S. only, and including both a CD and DVD.

In 2004, he released an album project, under the title of &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, produced by Fabrizio Grossi. In 2008, he recorded a new album with Aynsley Dunbar for Direct Music, featuring artists such as Jake E. Lee, former guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne. Thomas reunited with Elvin Bishop when Starship closed for them in late 2008.

In November 2010, Thomas announced on his website that a new Starship album, &quot;Loveless Fascination&quot;, would be released in late summer or early fall of 2011; the album was eventually released in September 2013. In July 2011, Thomas released &quot;Marauder&quot;, a solo project covering songs originally recorded by other artists.

<doc id="1150793" wikidata="Q284509" url="?curid=1150793" title="What Will the Neighbours Say?">
<text>What Will the Neighbours Say? is the second studio album by English-Irish all-female pop group Girls Aloud. It was released in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2004 by Polydor Records. Brian Higgins and his production team Xenomania were enlisted to produce the entire album, allowing for more inventive ideas. &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; explores various subgenres of pop music.

&quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; was released to mostly positive reviews from contemporary music critics. It yielded five top-ten singles and had high sales, going double platinum in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The album was followed by Girls Aloud&#x27;s first tour, the What Will the Neighbours Say...? Tour.

To celebrate the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, it was reissued in March 2024 in three formats, a sky-blue vinyl LP, a picture disc vinyl LP, and a 3CD Deluxe Edition, as well as a digital download and on streaming. The non-vinyl editions feature the original UK album along with remixes, alternative cuts, rarities, and three previously unreleased tracks: a cover of Chris Isaak&#x27;s &quot;Wicked Game&quot; originally slated for a shelved 2005 reissue of the album and two original songs, &quot;Disco Bunny&quot; and &quot;Baby When You Go.&quot;

==Conception==
Band member Cheryl revealed in an interview that although Girls Aloud&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and its singles had been successful, in 2004, Polydor Records were considering dropping them from the label after what they perceived as underperformance of the album&#x27;s sales, considering that the group was formed during &quot;&quot;, which drew 20 million viewers, which according to record executives was not &quot;turning into 20 million sales.&quot; However, Polydor&#x27;s then-marketing director, Peter Lorraine, appealed to the label and convinced them to allow the group to record a second album.

Polydor enlisted Brian Higgins and Xenomania to produce Girls Aloud&#x27;s second album in its entirety, following their production of six tracks from &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, including the album&#x27;s three singles, and three more tracks: &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, &quot;You Freak Me Out&quot; (for the film &quot;Freaky Friday&quot;) and &quot;Jump&quot; (for the film &quot;Love Actually&quot;), which all featured on the album&#x27;s late 2003 reissue. &quot;When the second album came round, the label said, &#x27;Listen, we&#x27;re not going to do this group any more if you don&#x27;t do it.&#x27;&quot; Higgins explained. &quot;I think my initial reaction was to do a few tracks and he said, &#x27;No, you have to do this because I think you&#x27;re the only person who understands exactly what it is&#x27;. So, that&#x27;s how we took it on.&quot;

Higgins said, &quot;The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio.&quot; The album was recorded from April to September 2004, although its lead single &quot;The Show&quot; was released in June 2004. The album title comes from a lyric in the song &quot;Love Machine&quot; which asks, &quot;what will the neighbours say this time?&quot;

==Music==

===Style and lyrics===
&quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; explores different subgenres of pop, especially incorporating electronic dance music into electropop. Synthesizers are more prominent on the album. The usage of guitar was also prominent in several songs. The backing track to &quot;Love Machine&quot;, composed by Xenomania musicians Tim Powell and Nick Coler, was inspired by the Smiths, while &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; includes a guitar riff inspired by garage rock. &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; also includes a number of ballads.

The lyrics focus on a number of more adult topics, often dealing with sexuality, as well as themes of teenage rebellion and heartbreak. The lyrics to &quot;The Show&quot; contain an anti-promiscuity message. &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; faced a slight controversy due to its &quot;boozy lyrics.&quot; The song references Bud and margaritas in the first verse. Unlike &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, Girls Aloud became involved in the writing process. &quot;We don&#x27;t let them out of the room till they&#x27;ve given every ounce of melodic instinct that they&#x27;ve got in them, [...] at the end, you find they&#x27;ve contributed really well,&quot; Higgins stated in an interview with &quot;The Observer&quot;. Nadine Coyle admitted, &quot;I needed to be pushed into songwriting, because I wasn&#x27;t really interested&quot;. The album&#x27;s lyrics were praised by critics, noting &quot;the girls are usually singing something interesting. Someone at Xenomania has a knack for writing witty couplets&quot;.

===Songs===
The album begins with its lead single, &quot;The Show&quot;, described as &quot;a feisty, thumping track with a positively rude bassline&quot; and a &quot;rush of thrilling synth stabs and natty vocal hooks&quot;. It was also compared to &quot;an early-1990s rave record.&quot; &quot;Love Machine&quot;, the second single, follows. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called the song a &quot;perfect example of Xenomania&#x27;s uniquely rousing approach to pop.&quot; It was called &quot;three and a half minutes of pure joy, taking in a guitar line that sounds like it&#x27;s been nicked from an old rockabilly tune, some mid-&#x27;80s synth pop and a rousing chorus.&quot; A cover of the Pretenders&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; was recorded especially for Children in Need. The first version of &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; that Xenomania created was described as a &quot;weird, modernist breakbeat version&quot;, which was scrapped upon deciding an updated version of the original song would be better suited for Children in Need. Critics felt it was &quot;arguable whether this cover adds much to the Pretenders&#x27; original.&quot; Girls Aloud&#x27;s version has also been compared to Shakespears Sister. &quot;Jump&quot;, a cover of a song by the Pointer Sisters, was originally taken from the re-release of &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and the soundtrack to &quot;Love Actually&quot;. Cheryl Cole noted in Girls Aloud&#x27;s 2008 autobiography &quot;Dreams That Glitter – Our Story&quot; that the single &quot;was the point when we realized everything we&#x27;d been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that&#x27;s not what people wanted.&quot; The album&#x27;s fifth track is its final single &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s review said that the song sounds like what would happen if &quot;you married an alarmingly fast techno thud to an implausibly dumb three-chord garage-rock riff.&quot;

&quot;Deadlines and Diets&quot;, originally released in 2000 by Moonbaby (a pseudonym of Xenomania songwriter Miranda Cooper), is a song about one night stands. The song received comparisons to All Saints, specifically their breakthrough single &quot;Never Ever&quot;. &quot;Big Brother&quot;, co-written by Cheryl Cole, was labelled &quot;crunchy electro.&quot; It was noted that the song &quot;could be about anything, up to and including the admittedly unlikely topic of sexual subservience to a totalitarian dictator.&quot; The &quot;voyeur-themed&quot; song was compared to ABBA, New Order and the Thompson Twins by one reviewer. &quot;Hear Me Out&quot; was co-written by Sarah Harding. The ballad received comparisons to those of the Spice Girls. One of the album&#x27;s most noteworthy songs, &quot;Graffiti My Soul&quot;, was intended for Britney Spears&#x27;s &quot;In the Zone&quot;. It was turned down for its lack of a chorus; Higgins said that they wanted &quot;essentially &quot;Sound of the Underground 2&quot;. The track was described as &quot;a full-scale collision between Madonna, Michael Jackson and the Prodigy&quot; and &quot;frighteningly sharp and sassy.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; said the song makes you question: &quot;What if the Prodigy hadn&#x27;t turned down the chance to write with Madonna?&quot; &quot;Real Life&quot;, the album&#x27;s tenth track, &quot;unexpectedly evokes Martina Topley-Bird&#x27;s Tricky tracks.&quot;

&quot;Here We Go&quot; was also originally recorded by Moonbaby. Aqua singer Lene Nystrøm Rasted, who co-wrote Girls Aloud&#x27;s &quot;No Good Advice&quot;, also recorded a version of the song for her 2003 album &quot;Play With Me&quot;. &quot;Here We Go&quot; is also the basis for the theme song to the television cartoon series, &quot;Totally Spies!.&quot; The track has been described as &quot;a relatively filthy &#x27;60s romp&quot;. &quot;Thank Me Daddy&quot;, co-written by Kimberley Walsh, is a &quot;saucy disco romp&quot;. &quot;I Say a Prayer for You&quot;, a bonus track co-written and entirely sung by Nicola Roberts, also received comparisons to Spice Girls&#x27; ballads. The album&#x27;s final track is &quot;100 Different Ways&quot;, which Nadine Coyle co-wrote and sings solo.

==Release==
&quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2004. The international versions of the album exclude the bonus tracks &quot;I Say a Prayer for You&quot; and &quot;100 Different Ways&quot;. &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; and other Girls Aloud releases appeared on the US iTunes Store on 26 June 2007.

===Singles===
The album&#x27;s first single was technically their cover of &quot;Jump&quot;, although the song initially appeared on the re-release of &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; and was the recorded for the &quot;Love Actually&quot; soundtrack. The music video for &quot;Jump&quot; was made to appear like it was intertwined with &quot;Love Actually&quot;. The song debuted at number two on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;The Show&quot; was the first single exclusive to &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot;. The song was critically acclaimed and peaked at number two. &quot;The Times&quot; noted that &quot;Brian Higgins&#x27;s Xenomania hit factory proved itself as good as the greatest song teams in pop history with this thrillingly off-the-wall chart-topper. The music video for &quot;The Show&quot; takes place in a salon called &quot;Curls Allowed.&quot; &quot;The Show&quot; was released in Australia in June 2006, as the second single from the Australian version of &quot;Chemistry&quot;. &quot;Love Machine&quot; was the second single from &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot;. Critics said the song was &quot;so unlike anything else in the charts right now...proving once again that they&#x27;re still one of the most exciting bands in pop right now.&quot; The music video takes place at the fictitious nightclub, the Eskimo Club. It was number two on the UK Singles Chart for two consecutive weeks. The song appeared in television advertisements for Homebase from 2006 to 2009. &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; served as the album&#x27;s third single, released for Children in Need. The track was announced as a single just ten days before its 15 November 2004 release. It became Girls Aloud&#x27;s second number one on the UK Singles Chart. The album&#x27;s final single was &quot;Wake Me Up&quot;. In 2005, &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; won the award for the Popjustice £20 Music Prize, an annual prize awarded to the best British pop single of the year. Girls Aloud had previously won the award in 2003 for &quot;No Good Advice&quot;. The music video for &quot;Wake Me Up&quot; was directed by Harvey &amp; Carolyn and starred Girls Aloud as &quot;biker chicks&quot;. It became their first single to miss the top three when it peaked at number four. &quot;Graffiti My Soul&quot; was going to be the sixth single released from the album, but was cancelled because the group wanted to start work on their third album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; received positive reviews from music critics. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; declared, &quot;There is no pop in the world like Girls Aloud today.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; hailed it as &quot;a great album: funny, clever, immediate, richly inventive.&quot; Girls Aloud were praised for simply making it past their debut. &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; was referred to as &quot;nothing less than the pop album of the year.&quot; RTÉ.ie called it a &quot;near perfect pop album&quot;, praised its &quot;vivacious and engulfing tunes&quot; and stated that there is &quot;pretty much nothing to dislike&quot; about it. A review by Entertainment.ie&#x27;s Andrew Lynch said, &quot;Girls Aloud really shouldn&#x27;t have made it as far as a second album. [...] There&#x27;s just one problem – the girls have a knack of coming up with utterly infectious pop songs&quot;.

&quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; did receive mild criticism for being &quot;top-heavy&quot;, with the singles comprising the first five songs which AllMusic said &quot;left the second half of the album rather thin on killer tracks.&quot; BBC Music agreed, stating that the album &quot;settles into a fairly predictable mix of well-produced tunes covering the various pop styles and themes.&quot; The reviewer, however, did say &quot;in the ultra-fickle world of TV-generated pop, Girls Aloud have real staying power.&quot; Yahoo! Music announced more cynically, despite giving the album 7/10, that &quot;this album isn&#x27;t an investment piece so much a cheap thrill to be savoured and worn out by next Christmas.&quot; Girls Aloud&#x27;s covers of &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot; (originally by the Pretenders) and &quot;Jump&quot; (originally by the Pointer Sisters) were also criticised. MusicOMH said, &quot;it&#x27;s when the girls stray from their regular songwriting team that they become unstuck. [...] The two covers are the only mis-step though here.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; became Girls Aloud&#x27;s second top ten album in the United Kingdom. It debuted at number six on the UK Albums Chart, spending two further weeks in the top ten and a total of 17 non-consecutive weeks on the chart, and was eventually ranked 44th on the tally&#x27;s 2004 year-end chart. On 10 December 2004, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It reached Platinum status on 14 May 2010, surpassing sales of over 300,000 units. In 2024, the album&#x27;s deluxe edition reissue, released on 8 March 2024, re-entered the UK Albums Chart at number 35. The same week, &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; debuted a number six on the UK Vinyl Albums chart. On 26 March 2024, the album was certified double Platinum by the BPI for shipments in excesss of 600,000 copies.

In Scotland, &quot;What Will the Neighbours Say?&quot; peaked at number four on the Scottish Albums Charts. In Ireland, the album debuted at number twelve, remaining in the top twenty for eight weeks. By 2005, it had been certified double Platinum by the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) for shipments of more than 30,000 units.

<doc id="1150812" wikidata="Q2404768" url="?curid=1150812" title="Winter Olympics (video game)">
<text>Winter Olympics, released in the United States as Winter Olympic Games, is the official video game of the XVII Olympic Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway. All versions were published by U.S. Gold. It was released in North America in 1993 for the Amiga, Sega Genesis, and IBM PC compatibles. Ports to the Game Gear, Sega Genesis, Master System, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System followed. The game includes 10 winter sporting events. Players can represent countries from all over the world.

==Gameplay==
The player can train freely and compete in either full or mini Olympics, the latter of which allows the player to choose events. Before the competition, the player can choose between the 16 teams, each representing one of the many participating nations at the 1994 Winter Olympics. Also during competition, there are both medals and points tables. While in &quot;Olympic Gold&quot; points were awarded according to the medals table, in Winter Olympics they were given according to the best results, as in decathlon. Doing so, it was perfectly possible for one to win the gold medal in short track and get few more points than other skaters (even non-finalists) that got better qualifying times. This scoring method also meant that one who won gold medals in six or seven events might fall outside the top 10 if disqualified on the remaining three.

===Events===
#Downhill
#Giant Slalom
#Super G
#Slalom
#Bobsled
#Luge
#Freestyle moguls (console versions only)
#Ski jumping
#Biathlon
#Short track

===Playable nations===
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#

==Development==
Major differences between versions stemmed from U.S. Gold&#x27;s choice to use two companies developing different versions of the game separately. Additionally, Tiertex wrote original code for each platform instead of porting. Amongst major differences, freestyle moguls are different on the 16-bit versions, and overall the Super NES version is much more unforgiving than the Genesis version, while the Master System version allows better control on alpine skiing events.
