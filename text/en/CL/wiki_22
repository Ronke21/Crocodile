<text>The East Fremantle Football Club, nicknamed the Sharks and colloquially referred to as East Freo, is an Australian rules football club playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW). The team&#x27;s home ground is East Fremantle Oval. East Fremantle is the most successful club in WAFL history, winning 30 premierships since their entry into the competition in 1898. East Fremantle&#x27;s last premiership was in 2023, when they defeated Peel Thunder.

==History==

The increasing professionalism of teams in the Goldfields Football League attracted players away from Perth, which saw the Imperials Football Club collapse in 1897. Tom Wilson and David &#x27;Dolly&#x27; Christy from the Imperials, along with businessman Sam Thomson, were instrumental in the foundation of the East Fremantle Football Club and its admission into the West Australian Football Association. The club adopted the Imperials&#x27; blue and white colours and many Imperials players would become part of the East Fremantle team in 1898. Other sources claim that the origin of the club&#x27;s colours were from the North Melbourne Football Club at the suggeston of the club&#x27;s first captain Tom Wilson had played for North in the Victorian Football Association. Wilson as captain and Christy as vice captain would play in East Fremantle&#x27;s first game at the WACA on 11 May 1898.

Tragedy would strike the club in just its sixth year, with the death of prominent player James Gullan from accidental poisoning the day after their game against South Fremantle. During Gullan&#x27;s time at East Fremantle he became regarded as one of the best players to ever play the game.

East Fremantle became known affectionately as &#x27;Old East&#x27; or &#x27;Old Easts&#x27; after the admission of East Perth to the competition in 1906. The nickname continued to be used until 1983, when the nickname of &#x27;the Sharks&#x27; was adopted.

East Fremantle has a fierce rivalry with its Port cousin, South Fremantle, and the Foundation Day Derby between the two sides is a much anticipated highlight of the local football calendar. East Fremantle&#x27;s success has thus far eclipsed that of South Fremantle, who () have won 14 WAFL premierships.

Up until 1987, Western Australia was immersed in WAFL culture and East Fremantle enjoyed a strong following. In 1987, a Perth-based club – the West Coast Eagles – joined an expanded Victorian Football League. West Coast&#x27;s initial squad of 32 players included six East Fremantle players and they were coached by former East Fremantle premiership player and coach, Ron Alexander. Interest in the semi-national competition saw attendances at WAFL games start to fall, with severe consequences for the club&#x27;s support base and finances. By the middle 2000s, East Fremantle was in severe trouble on and off the field, winning only nineteen of eighty matches between 2003 and 2006 and suffering severe financial difficulties, though since then the club substantially recovered. The club endured a 25-year premiership drought before winning a thirtieth premiership in 2023. The Sharks once pulled on average 10,000 people to a home game. Now 1,500 people to a home game is considered a strong attendance.

East Fremantle was a foundation member of the WAFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2019. They were the inaugural premiers of the competition, defeating Swan Districts in the grand final.

===Team of the Century===

In 1997 the East Fremantle Football Club named its Team of the Century, to coincide with the club centenary celebrations. The team includes many names that have become synonymous with East Fremantle.

===Fremantle Team of Legends===

In 2007 the East Fremantle and South Fremantle football clubs came together to select the Fremantle Team of Legends. The Team consisted of players from East Fremantle and South Fremantle that had played at least 100 WAFL games for either club.

===Club song===
The East Fremantle team song is sung to the tune of &quot;Notre Dame Victory March&quot;, which was adapted when the club changed its nickname from Old Easts to the Sharks in 1983.

:&quot;Cheer, Cheer the Blue and the White&quot;
:&quot;Honour the Sharks by day and by night&quot;
:&quot;Lift that loyal banner high&quot;
:&quot;Shake down the thunder from the sky&quot;
:&quot;Whether the odds be great or be small&quot;
:&quot;We will go in and win over all&quot;
:&quot;While our players keep on fighting&quot;
:&quot;Onwards to victory!&quot;

<text>A negotiable instrument is a document guaranteeing the payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand, or at a set time, whose payer is usually named on the document. More specifically, it is a document contemplated by or consisting of a contract, which promises the payment of money without condition, which may be paid either on demand or at a future date. The term has different meanings, depending on its use in the application of different laws and depending on countries and contexts. The word &quot;negotiable&quot; refers to transferability, and &quot;instrument&quot; refers to a document giving legal effect by the virtue of the law.

==Concept of negotiability==
William Searle Holdsworth defines the concept of negotiability as follows:
#Negotiable instruments are transferable under the following circumstances: they are transferable by delivery where they are made payable to the bearer, they are transferable by delivery and endorsement where they are made payable to order.
#Consideration is presumed.
#The transferee acquires a good title, even though the transferor had a defective or no title.

==Jurisdictions==
In the Commonwealth of Nations almost all jurisdictions have codified the law relating to negotiable instruments in a Bills of Exchange Act, e.g. Bills of Exchange Act 1882 in the UK, Bills of Exchange Act 1890 in Canada, Bills of Exchange Act 1908 in New Zealand, Bills of Exchange Act 1909 in Australia, the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 in India and the Bills of Exchange Act 1914 in Mauritius.

Additionally most Commonwealth jurisdictions have separate Cheques Acts providing for additional protections for bankers collecting unendorsed or irregularly endorsed cheques, providing that cheques that are crossed and marked &#x27;not negotiable&#x27; or similar are not transferable, and providing for electronic presentation of cheques in inter-bank cheque clearing systems.

== History ==
In India, during the Mauryan period in the 3rd century BC, an instrument called adesha was in use, which was an order on a banker desiring him to pay the money of the note to a third person, which corresponds to the definition of a bill of exchange as we understand it today.

The ancient Romans are believed to have used an early form of cheque known as &quot;praescriptiones&quot; in the 1st century BC and 2,000-year-old Roman promissory notes have been found.

Common prototypes of bills of exchanges and promissory notes originated in China, where special instruments called &quot;fey tsien&quot; which were used to safely transfer money over long distances during the reign of the Tang dynasty in the 8th century.

In about 1150 the Knights Templar issued an early form of bank notes to departing pilgrims in exchange for a deposit of valuables at a local Templar preceptory in a European country, which could be cashed by the pilgrim concerned on arrival in the Holy Land, by presenting the note to a Templar preceptory there.

In the mid-13th century, the Ilkhanid rulers of Persia printed the &quot;cha&quot; or &quot;chap&quot; which was used as paper money for limited use for transactions between the court and the merchants for about three years before it collapsed. The collapse was caused by the court accepting the &quot;cha&quot; only at progressive discount.

Later, such documents were used for money transfer by Middle Eastern merchants, who had used the prototypes of bills of exchange (&quot;suftadja&quot; or &quot;softa&quot;) from the 8th century to present. Such prototypes came to be used later by the Iberian and Italian merchants in the 12th century. In Italy in the 13–15th centuries, bills of exchange and promissory notes obtained their main features, while further phases of their development have been associated with France (16–18th centuries, where the endorsement had appeared) and Germany (19th century, formalization of Exchange Law). The first mention of the use of bills of exchange in English statutes dates from 1381, under Richard II; the statute mandates the use of such instruments in England, and prohibits the future export of gold and silver specie, in any form, to settle foreign commercial transactions. English exchange law was different than continental European law because of different legal systems; the English system was adopted later in the United States.

In England, two of the main reasons why the use of negotiable instruments became so popular was:

# Carrying large amounts of coins from one place to the other was deemed unsafe, so the usage of negotiable instruments was to prevent merchants from being robbed of their coins either on land or by sea.
# During the 1300s, there was an increase in the use of counterfeit English money, so the aim of the English Crown was to eradicate the exchange of genuine English coins for such forgeries as well as foreign goods. As such, statutes such as the Statute of Money of 1335 (9 Edw. 3 Stat. 2) and 1379 were implemented to prevent the importation of money that was deemed as counterfeit, and also to prevent the exportation of valuable items like gold and silver in the absence of any special licenses.

The modern emphasis on negotiability may also be traced to Lord Mansfield. Germanic Lombard documents may also have some elements of negotiability.

== Distinguished from other types of contracts ==

A negotiable instrument can serve to convey value constituting at least part of the performance of a contract, albeit perhaps not obvious in contract formation, in terms inherent in and arising from the requisite offer and acceptance and conveyance of consideration. The underlying contract contemplates the right to hold the instrument as, and to negotiate the instrument to, a &quot;holder in due course&quot;, the payment on which is at least part of the performance of the contract to which the negotiable instrument is linked. The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a &quot;bearer instrument&quot;, wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment. Certain exceptions exist, such as instances of loss or theft of the instrument, wherein the possessor of the note may be a holder, but not necessarily a holder in due course. Negotiation requires a valid &quot;endorsement&quot; of the negotiable instrument.

The consideration constituted by a negotiable instrument is cognizable as the value given up to acquire it (benefit) and the consequent loss of value (detriment) to the prior holder; thus, no separate consideration is required to support an accompanying contract assignment. The instrument itself is understood as memorializing the right for, and power to demand, payment, and an obligation for payment evidenced by the instrument itself with possession as a holder in due course being the touchstone for the right to, and power to demand, payment. In some instances, the negotiable instrument can serve as the writing memorializing a contract, thus satisfying any applicable statute of frauds as to that contract.

=== The holder in due course ===
The rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument are qualitatively, as matters of law, superior to those provided by ordinary species of contracts:
* The rights to payment are not subject to set-off, and do not rely on the validity of the underlying contract giving rise to the debt (for example if a cheque was drawn for payment for goods delivered but defective, the drawer is still liable on the cheque)
* No notice need be given to any party liable on the instrument for transfer of the rights under the instrument by negotiation. However, payment by the party liable to the person previously entitled to enforce the instrument &quot;counts&quot; as payment on the note until adequate notice has been received by the liable party that a different party is to receive payments from then on. [U.C.C. §3-602(b)]
* Transfer free of equities—the holder in due course can hold better title than the party he obtains it from (as in the instance of negotiation of the instrument from a mere holder to a holder in due course)

Negotiation often enables the transferee to become the party to the contract through a contract assignment (provided for explicitly or by operation of law) and to enforce the contract in the transferee-assignee&#x27;s own name. Negotiation can be effected by endorsement and delivery (order instruments), or by delivery alone (bearer instruments).

== Classes ==
Promissory notes and bills of exchange are two primary types of negotiable instruments. The following chart shows the main differences:
=== Promissory note ===
Although possibly non-negotiable, a promissory note may be a negotiable instrument if it is an unconditional promise in writing made by one person to another, signed by the maker, engaging to pay on demand to the &quot;payee&quot;, or at fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money, to order or to bearer. The law applicable to the specific instrument will determine whether it is a negotiable instrument or a non-negotiable instrument.

Bank notes are frequently referred to as promissory notes, a promissory note made by a bank and payable to bearer on demand. According to section 4 of India&#x27;s Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, &quot;a Promissory Note is a writing (not being a bank note or currency note), containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the maker to pay a certain sum of money only to or to the order of a certain person or the bearer of the instrument&quot;.

=== Bill of exchange ===
A bill of exchange or &quot;draft&quot; is a written order by the &quot;&quot; to the &quot;&quot; to pay money to the &quot;&quot;. A common type of bill of exchange is the cheque (&quot;check&quot; in American English), defined as a bill of exchange drawn on a banker and payable on demand. Bills of exchange are used primarily in international trade, and are written orders by one person to his bank to pay the bearer a specific sum on a specific date. Prior to the advent of paper currency, bills of exchange were a common means of exchange. They are not used as often today.

A bill of exchange is essentially an order made by one person to another to pay money to a third person. A bill of exchange requires in its inception three parties—the drawer, the drawee, and the payee. The person who draws the bill is called the drawer. He gives the order to pay money to the third party. The party upon whom the bill is drawn is called the drawee. He is the person to whom the bill is addressed and who is ordered to pay. He becomes an acceptor when he indicates his willingness to pay the bill. The party in whose favor the bill is drawn or is payable is called the payee. The parties need not all be distinct persons. Thus, the drawer may draw on himself payable to his own order.
A bill of exchange may be endorsed by the payee in favour of a third party, who may in turn endorse it to a fourth, and so on indefinitely. The &quot;holder in due course&quot; may claim the amount of the bill against the drawee and all previous endorsers, regardless of any counterclaims that may have disabled the previous payee or endorser from doing so. This is what is meant by saying that a bill is negotiable.
In some cases a bill is marked &quot;not negotiable&quot;—see crossing of cheques. In that case it can still be transferred to a third party, but the third party can have no better right than the transferor.

== In the United States ==
In the United States, Articles 3 and 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) govern the issuance and transfer of negotiable instruments, unless the instruments are governed by Article 8 of the UCC. The various state law enactments of UCC §§ 3–104(a) through (d) set forth the legal definition of what is and what is not a &quot;negotiable instrument&quot;:

Thus, for a writing to be a negotiable instrument under Article 3, the following requirements must be met:
# The promise or order to pay must be unconditional;
# The payment must be a specific sum of money, although interest may be added to the sum;
# The payment must be made on demand or at a definite time;
# The instrument must not require the person promising payment to perform any act other than paying the money specified;
# The instrument must be payable to bearer or to order.
The latter requirement is referred to as the &quot;words of negotiability&quot;: a writing which does not contain the words &quot;to the order of&quot; (within the four corners of the instrument or in endorsement on the note or in allonge) or indicate that it is payable to the individual holding the contract document (analogous to the holder in due course) is not a negotiable instrument and is not governed by Article 3, even if it appears to have all of the other features of negotiability. The only exception is that if an instrument meets the definition of a cheque (a bill of exchange payable on demand and drawn on a bank) and is not payable to order (i.e. if it just reads &quot;pay John Doe&quot;) then it is treated as a negotiable instrument.

UCC Article 3 does not apply to money, to payment orders governed by Article 4A, or to securities governed by Article 8.

===Negotiation and endorsement ===
Persons other than the original obligor and obligee can become parties to a negotiable instrument. The most common manner in which this is done is by &quot;endorsing&quot; (from Latin &quot;dorsum&quot;, the back + &quot;in&quot;), that is placing one&#x27;s signature on the back of the instrument—if the person who signs does so with the intention of obtaining payment of the instrument or acquiring or transferring rights to the instrument, the signature is called an &quot;endorsement&quot;. There are five types of endorsements contemplated by the Code, covered in UCC Article 3, Sections 204–206:

*An endorsement which purports to transfer the instrument to a specified person is a &quot;special endorsement&quot; – for example, &quot;Pay to the order of Amy&quot;;
*An endorsement by the payee or holder which does not contain any additional notation (thus purporting to make the instrument payable to bearer) is an &quot;endorsement in blank&quot; or &quot;blank endorsement;&quot;
*An endorsement which purports to require that the funds be applied in a certain manner (e.g. &quot;&quot;, &quot;for collection&quot;) is a &quot;restrictive endorsement&quot;; and,
*An endorsement purporting to disclaim retroactive liability is called a &quot;qualified endorsement&quot; (through the inscription of the words &quot;without recourse&quot; as part of the endorsement on the instrument or in allonge to the instrument).
*An endorsement purporting to add terms and conditions is called a &quot;conditional endorsement&quot; – for example, &quot;Pay to the order of Amy, if she rakes my lawn next Thursday November 15th, 2007&quot;. The UCC states that these conditions may be disregarded.
If a note or draft is negotiated to a person who acquires the instrument
#in good faith;
#for value;
#without notice of any defenses to payment,
the transferee is a &quot;holder in due course&quot; and can enforce the instrument &quot;without&quot; being subject to defenses which the maker of the instrument would be able to assert against the original payee, except for certain &quot;real defenses&quot;. These real defenses include (1) forgery of the instrument; (2) fraud as to the nature of the instrument being signed; (3) alteration of the instrument; (4) incapacity of the signer to contract; (5) infancy of the signer; (6) duress; (7) discharge in bankruptcy; and, (8) the running of a statute of limitations as to the validity of the instrument.
The &quot;holder-in-due-course rule&quot; is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot; that makes the free transfer of negotiable instruments feasible in the modern economy. A person or entity purchasing an instrument in the ordinary course of business can reasonably expect that it will be paid when presented to, and not subject to dishonor by, the maker, without involving itself in a dispute between the maker and the person to whom the instrument was first issued (this can be contrasted to the lesser rights and obligations accruing to mere holders). Article 3 of the Uniform Commercial Code as enacted in a particular State&#x27;s law contemplate &quot;real defenses&quot; available to purported holders in due course.
The foregoing is the theory and application presuming compliance with the relevant law. Practically, the obligor-payor on an instrument who feels he has been defrauded or otherwise unfairly dealt with by the payee may nonetheless refuse to pay even a holder in due course, requiring the latter to resort to litigation to recover on the instrument.

=== Usage ===
While bearer instruments are rarely created as such, a holder of commercial paper with the holder designated as payee can change the instrument to a bearer instrument by an endorsement. The proper holder simply signs the back of the instrument and the instrument becomes bearer paper, although in recent years, third party checks are not being honored by most banks unless the original payee has signed a notarized document stating such.

Alternatively, an individual or company may write a check payable to &quot;cash&quot; or &quot;bearer&quot; and create a bearer instrument. Great care should be taken with the security of the instrument, as it is legally almost as good as cash.

=== Exceptions ===
Under the Code, the following are not negotiable instruments, although the law governing obligations with respect to such items may be similar to or derived from the law applicable to negotiable instruments:
* Bills of lading and other documents of title, which are governed by Article 7 of the Code. However, under admiralty law, a bill of lading may either be a negotiable or &#x27;order&#x27; bill of lading, or a non-negotiable or &#x27;straight&#x27; bill of lading.
* Deeds and other documents conveying interests in real estate, although a mortgage may secure a promissory note which is governed by Article 3
* IOUs
* Letters of credit, which are governed by Article 5 of the Code

== Modern relevance ==
Although often considered foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned. Negotiability can be traced back to the 1700s and Lord Mansfield, when money and liquidity was relatively scarce. The holder in due course rule has been limited by various statutes. Concerns have also been raised that the holder in due course rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.

<text>The Grimsby Chums was a British First World War Pals battalion of Kitchener&#x27;s Army raised in and around the town of Grimsby in Lincolnshire in 1914. When the battalion was taken over by the British Army it was officially named the 10th (Service) Battalion, The Lincolnshire Regiment. It was the only &#x27;pals battalion&#x27; to be called &#x27;chums&#x27;.

When the call came from Lord Kitchener for volunteers, the headmaster of Wintringham Grammar School in Grimsby decided to raise a 250-strong company of former pupils which would be based at the armoury of the school&#x27;s Officer Training Corps. The company was offered to the local Territorial Force unit, the 5th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, but by then the battalion was full. When other Grimsby men expressed a wish to join, the process was handed over to the town council which set about recruiting sufficient men to form an entire battalion for &#x27;Kitchener&#x27;s Army&#x27;. Men were accepted from neighbouring towns such as Boston, Louth and Scunthorpe. In order to complete the battalion, a group was sent from Wakefield in Yorkshire.

The Grimsby Chums joined the 101st Brigade of the 34th Division where they were joined by the two battalions of the Edinburgh City Pals. The division moved to France in January 1916 and first saw action in the Battle of the Somme. On 1 July 1916, the first day on the Somme, the Grimsby Chums were in the first wave attacking the fortified village of La Boisselle, just south of the Albert–Bapaume road. To aid their attack, a massive mine, known as the Lochnagar mine, was detonated beneath the German trenches at 7.28 am, two minutes before Zero hour. At 7.30 am, the Grimsby Chums rushed forward to occupy the crater. Here many were trapped for the rest of the day, harassed by both German and British artillery.

A few of the Grimsby Chums made it into the German trenches. The only officer to make it was 2nd Lieutenant Harold P. Hendin who led five men to the German reserve trench (the third trench in the front-line system) and, gathering stragglers as the day progressed, he held off a series of German counter-attacks before having to retire. In total the Grimsby Chums suffered 502 casualties on 1 July; 15 officers and 487 other ranks. Only two of the officers came back unwounded, and only about 100 men.

In February 1918 the battalion moved to the 103rd Brigade, 34th Division. The 10th Battalion was disbanded on 3 June 1919.

A memorial in St James&#x27; Church, Grimsby, was erected to the memory of the 810 members of the 10th (Service) Battalion who were killed in action or died on service.

<text>The East Perth Football Club, nicknamed the Royals, is an Australian rules football club based in Leederville, Western Australia, current playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW). Formed in 1902 as the Union Football Club, the club entered the WAFL in 1906, changing its name to East Perth. It won its first premiership in 1919, part of a streak of five consecutive premierships. Overall, the club has won 17 premierships, most recently in 2002. The club is currently based at Leederville Oval, which it shares with the Subiaco Football Club, having previously played home games at Wellington Square (from 1901 to 1909) and Perth Oval (formerly known as Loton Park) from 1910 to 1999.

From 2014 until 2018, East Perth served as the host club for the West Coast Eagles of the Australian Football League, the arrangement saw West Coast&#x27;s reserves players playing in the WAFL for East Perth.

==History==
The club was actually founded in 1902 as Union Football Club (not to be confused with the defunct Unions club from Fremantle) and competed in the Perth Third Rate Association Competition (however an earlier &#x27;East Perth&#x27; had formed in 1891). The club was successful and was promoted to the First Rate Association. After continuing to succeed at this level they applied to join the WAFL and hence became a member in April 1906. The club became known as East Perth in accordance with the WAFL&#x27;s policy of having each club represent a district in Perth.

After a relatively slow start – despite being competitive form its first season – East Perth after World War I went on to become one of the most powerful clubs in the West Australian league with the appointment of former Subiaco player Phil Matson as captain-coach. The club won five consecutive WAFL premierships between 1919 and 1923, and after a brief lapse due to Matson&#x27;s death in a truck crash recovered to contest the finals every year from 1931 to 1940, but won only one premiership – a frustrating record to be repeated in the 1970s.

Although the club garnered an undefeated premiership in the under-age WAFL competition in 1944, East Perth became very much a middle-of-the-road side after open-age WANFL football resumed until the emergence of champion ruckman Graham &quot;Polly&quot; Farmer in 1956. That year, despite being held to the lowest WAFL score between 1946 and 2002 by Perth in torrential rain and genuine darkness at the WACA, the Royals won fourteen of their nineteen games and beat South Fremantle twice in the finals. Under the coaching of Jack Sheedy, and aided by becoming the first WAFL club to play players formally, the club contested the following five grand finals for further premierships in 1958 and 1959 and a huge upset loss to Swan Districts in 1961.

The loss of Farmer, however, saw a decline in fortunes: in 1964 the club won only one of its first eighteen games and finished with its first wooden spoon since 1929, but with the recruitment of Kevin Murray the club returned to the top quickly. It returned to the finals in 1966 and played therein during every one of the next seventeen seasons except 1974. During these years East Perth won 246 and drew one of 388 games for a success rate of 63.5 percent: clearly the highest in a competition that – at least during the first half of this period – was extremely even and characterised by very rapid fluctuations in teams&#x27; fortunes. By 1980, the club had made a submission to enter the VFL/AFL, however this was withdrawn, and from 1983 their fortunes declined abruptly: between 1985 and 1995 East Perth won only eighty and draw one of 235 games for a success rate of 34.26%. Indeed, between 1985 and 1989, the Royals actually won just 24 of 105 games for a success rate of 22.8% and did not finish above sixth, with a lowlight being the sacking of coach Greg Brehaut on 13 May 1986 that was followed by a walk-out of three managers from a reserves team that had won five matches out of seven.

In 1996 the Royals returned to prominence and took the minor premiership before losing narrowly to Claremont in its first grand final since 1978. However, the club returned to the lower reaches of the ladder in 1999, winning only five of twenty games. East Perth later acted as the host club for West Coast Eagles players recruited from interstate from 2000 to 2001 until the host club arrangement was abolished. This made them favoured for high honours in 2000 – which was achieved with five Eagles in the grand final side, though the Royals&#x27; &quot;old guard&quot; made a much larger contribution than expected to the club&#x27;s first flag for twenty-two years. It repeated the dose emphatically in 2001, holding South Fremantle to 0.3 (3) after half time, and yet again in 2002, but fell off steadily in the following four seasons to win only six games in 2005. A partial recovery in 2007 saw the Royals finish fourth, but it returned to last in 2008 before again rebounding in 2009 to finish fifth.

Its first home ground was Wellington Square. It then moved to Perth Oval between 1910 and 2002, although it played games at the WACA from 1988 to 1989. East Perth began playing its games at Leederville Oval from 2000, formerly the home of bitter rivals West Perth), but the club only officially moved there in 2003. They have since been joined at the ground by the Subiaco Football Club.

===2010 season===
The 2010 season of home and away matches ended on a high for the Royals, as they defeated minor premiers Clarement in a tense and physical round 23 encounter. The win enabled them to hold their fourth place in the top four, earning a first semi-final appearance against East Fremantle.

After a slow start where East Fremantle lead 7.2-3.2 at quarter time East Perth eventually overran the much more fancied Sharks by 14 points 15.12 (102) to East Fremantle 13.10 (88). West Coast Eagles listed player Ben McKinley lead the charge up forward with 6 goals while Zac Beeck and Zac Clarke dominated the ruck.

A week later East Perth met Swan Districts at Bassendean Oval for the chance to meet the top of the table Claremont in the Grand Final. This time it was East Perth who flew out of the blocks to lead at the first change 5.2 to 3.2 but after that they would manage only 4 goals for the rest of the match as Swans steamrolled their way past a valiant East Perth 15.11 (101) to 9.9 (63). Swan Districts then went on to win the 2010 WAFL Premiership defeating Claremont in one of the great Grand Finals by 1 point at Subiaco Oval 8 days later.

The Reserve grade team went one step further than the Seniors in 2010 going down to Claremont by 12 points 13.6 (84) to 10.12 (72) in the Grand Final.

Craig Wulff was finally rewarded with his first FD Book Medal as the Best &amp; Fairest for season 2010.

==Rivalries==
East Perth&#x27;s traditional and most bitter rivals are West Perth Football Club. Known as the Perth Derby, they have competed in many historic matches including Grand Finals in 1922, 1932, 1960, 1969, 1971, 2002, when East Perth defeated the Falcons by 60 points to complete a hat-trick of premierships, and 2013.

The East Perth vs Perth fixtures were a significant rivalry in the 1960s and 1970s, including the famous 1978 Grand Final. However its significance is somewhat muted compared to the former mentioned fixture, possibly due to Perth&#x27;s lacklustre performances since the late 1970s.

Another newer rivalry is that with co-tenants Subiaco Football Club. East Perth had not beaten Subiaco since they began sharing the ground in 2004, until the 2007 season when East Perth came from over forty points behind at half time to win the game by three points. Recent games have become even more bitter with the transfer of players Travis Knights, Caine Hayes and Paul Ridley to Subiaco under controversial circumstances. Off the field the two clubs do have a good working relationship in regard to their ground sharing situation.

==Club song==
East Perth Forever Boys is the theme song of the East Perth Football Club, played as the league team comes to the field at either a home game or final, and after a victory at a home game or final. It is sung to the tune of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot; The lyrics were written by John K. Watts, an ex-player of the club. He was also responsible for the club songs of Swan Districts Football Club and Geelong Football Club. The recording of the song used by the club was performed by Clem Grogan and the Blue Brass. Hobart also has a song sung to the tune of &quot;Anchors Aweigh&quot;. Its lyrics are very similar to &quot;East Perth Forever Boys&quot;.
:East Perth...East Perth

:East Perth forever boys
:East Perth are we
:East Perth a great tradition
:With the premiership our mission
:East Perth forever boys
:And to the cause
:For we are the mighty Royals
:East Perth is the greatest team of all

:We&#x27;ll beat the Cardies
:Whether it be wet or fine
:We&#x27;ll beat the others
:At the bell they&#x27;ll be behind
:No doubt about it
:The reason for it

:East Perth forever boys
:East Perth are we
:East Perth a great tradition
:With the premiership our mission
:East Perth forever boys
:And to the cause
:For we are the mighty Royals
:East Perth is the greatest team of all

==League Championship Cup==
In 2010 the Australian Football League (AFL) announced plans to start a knockout competition featuring the best teams from the state leagues around Australia. 16 Teams would qualify based on their finishing position in their corresponding state leagues the previous years. Originally games were played primarily as curtain raisers for AFL games on a Saturday night and broadcast live on Fox Footy. In 2013 the games shifted to Tuesday night and the tournament comprised only 10 teams. The competition is sponsored by Foxtel and is known as Foxtel Cup.

East Perth have qualified for the tournament twice. In the competitions first year, 2011, the Royals defeated North Ballarat and NT Thunder to reach the semi-final losing to eventual premiers Williamstown.

<text>The Gartell Light Railway is a privately run narrow gauge railway located at Yenston in the Blackmore Vale, south of Templecombe, in Somerset, England. It operates a narrow gauge railway running for , partly along the track of the old Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway. The railway has 4 stations – Common Lane, Pinesway Junction, Park Lane and Tower View.

The railway is controlled using a comprehensive signalling system operated from two signalboxes – Common lane and Pinesway Junction. Both signalboxes control a mix of semaphore and colour light signals with mechanically operated points.

The railway is open to the public on selected dates through the year when it normally operates an intensive 3 train operation with departures from Common Lane station every 20 minutes through the day between 10:30 and 16:30.

<text>Kittlitz&#x27;s plover (Anarhynchus pecuarius) is a small shorebird (35–40 g) in the family Charadriidae that breeds near coastal and inland saltmarshes, sandy or muddy riverbanks or alkaline grasslands with short vegetation. It is native to much of Sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile Delta and Madagascar. It is thought to be mainly polygamous and has monomorphic plumage.

==Description==

Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is a small shorebird weighing between 35 and 40 grams. Both males and females share similar physical characteristics, with a black bill, dark brown eyes framed by black eyelids, and black legs, although at times, the legs can appear greenish or grey. During the breeding season, During the breeding season, the male displays distinct features, including a white forehead, a blackish bar followed by a narrow white bar on the forecrown, while the remainder of the crown appears brown with sandy tips on the feathers. A black stripe, separated from the crown by a white superciliary stripe, runs from the bill through the eye and extends to the side of the neck, forming a collar across the upper mantle. The mantle is dark grey-brown, and the other upperparts are sooty brown with feathers featuring sandy rufous margins. The face, chin and upper throat are white, while the rest of the underparts take on a yellowish hue, with a pale belly. Kittlitz&#x27;s plover possesses blackish central tail feathers that progressively become lighter towards the tail&#x27;s sides, and the outer one or two pairs are completely white. Notably, Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is not sexually size dimorphic, meaning that males and females share similar size characteristics. The female plumage closely resembles that of the male, although the black band across the forecrown is narrower. The non-breeding plumage does not differ significantly from the breeding plumage. In this stage, the eye stripe takes on a browner shade, and the frontal bar is absent, while the underparts become considerably paler. Generally, adult Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers exhibit a wing length ranging from 100 to 110 mm, an adult bill length between 15 and 23 mm, and an adult tarsus length between 26 and 33 mm. Juvenile Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers closely resemble adults; however, they lack the black face marks, their upperparts appear brown, the hindneck collar is buff in color, and their underparts are white.

==Distribution, movement and habitat==

===Distribution===
Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is distributed throughout most of sub-Saharan Africa, but is also native to Madagascar and the Nile River Delta. A genetic study reported genetic differentiation between Madagascar and the mainland population. It is common in South Africa, however rarer in arid regions of Botswana and Namibia. In Namibia, it mostly inhabits coastal regions, highlands and Ovamboland. It is more scarce in the southern lowveld of South Africa and patchy in the interior of KwaZulu-Natal and the eastern Cape. Usually it avoids mountains or densely wooded areas. The Malagasy population might result from a relatively recent immigration from mainland Africa, whereas the Madagascar plover (&quot;Charadrius thoracius&quot;) might have evolved from an earlier Kittlitz&#x27;s plover population. The two species are clearly distinct and can not interbreed. 
Birds from Madagascar are in general smaller than birds from continental Africa. Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers are heavier and have longer wings in South Africa compared to Madagascar, whereas Egyptian specimens have longer wings and shorter tarsi than in Madagascar. However, they are still regarded as the same species in the absence of apparent plumage difference.
In Madagascar, Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is both a breeding resident and intra-island migrant and has been recorded mostly below 950 m, although it has been recorded at up to 1,400 m too.

===Movements===

The African populations are partially sedentary in coastal areas, but mostly nomadic or migratory with their movements varying between years in response to rainfall. There is limited evidence for comparable variation in Madagascar. In the lower Mangoky basin for instance, they are thought to be resident, whereas at the Lake Tsimanampetsotsa, ringed adults have been recorded to have moved 113 km to Ifaty.

===Habitat===
Kittlitz&#x27;s plover can be both found in inland and coastal regions. It favours open habitats at low elevation, often dry ground (open dry mud) with very short grass, mostly in close proximity to water. It breeds at lakes, alkaline grasslands, lagoons, rivers, tidal mudflats or inland saltmarshes and artificial water bodies including commercial salt pans, but generally avoids sandy or rocky beaches. In the eastern and western Cape, some populations move to estuarine mudflats during the winter, probably because of reduced competition from Palearctic migrants but also to avoid food shortage due to harsh interior winters. 
They are strictly terrestrial, feeding, nesting, preening and roosting solely on the ground.

==Voice==
The Kittlitz&#x27;s plover&#x27;s calls include . They give alarm calls when in danger or when flushed, which include , hard or plaintive . 
During fights, the males give a buzzy call in aggressive or courtship chases, 
When male or female are feigning injury, they give a &#x27;cheep-cheep&#x27; and when a parent is inviting the young to brood, it gives a &#x27;chip-chip&#x27; and the young are being warned with a &#x27;trr-trr&#x27;. The call of a young is a thin &#x27;peep&#x27;.

==Feeding==
Kittlitz&#x27;s plover forages in a typical run-stop-search fashion, meaning it runs around, stops suddenly to peck at an item and then continues running. Sometimes, an individual stands erect with one foot vibrating on the surface (foot-trembling), then lunges forward to catch any prey that has been attracted to the surface. This behaviour has not been reported in Madagascar.
They feed day and night (on moonlit nights until 11PM) often in groups of 2–5 individuals or in small mixed flocks together with other small waders like the &quot;Calidris&quot; species. When foraging, they can show an aggressive behaviour, especially towards conspecifics and species with similar diets, e.g. curlew sandpiper (&quot;Calidris ferruginea&quot;) or common ringed plover (&quot;Charadrius hiaticula&quot;). The aggression increases with density and is particularly high in the winter months before breeding. 
They mainly feed on insects, especially beetles, insect larvae, spiders, small crustaceans and molluscs. Most of their food is small, but they were recorded to have taken a cricket that was about 40 mm long.

==Behaviour==

The species is social in the non-breeding season and stays in small flocks of about 20 individuals, however it has also been reported in larger flocks of 100–300 individuals during migratory movements.

===Breeding and territories===
Kittlitz&#x27;s plover has a flexible breeding system and shorter duration of pair bond than other plover species. It is thought to be mainly polygamous and the pairing usually occurs around 2–4 weeks before the couple occupies their territory. Copulation and feeding both take place in the territories, which can occupy 3600–4200m². The parents are highly defensive of their territories until the chicks hatch. When intruders invade their territory representing a threat, the parents run after them, stopping shortly in front of them, taking on an upright posture with their legs almost straight and their head up.

===Courtship===
The initial courtship takes place on &#x27;neutral&#x27; ground. and consists of a scrape-ceremony, where one bird is placing its breast on the sand, then rotating around on the breast, whilst having its tail raised and kicking out sand with back- and forward movements of its legs. 
Usually, the male takes the initiative of making several scrapes (although sometimes both parents take turns in making them) and then the female probably chooses the final nest site. Both parents pick up pebbles or break off bits of dead vegetation as nest material to line the nest with.

===Nesting and incubation===
The Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is a ground-nesting shorebird, that breeds throughout the whole year, although there are varying peak seasons in different geographic locations. Copulation usually occurs 6–11 days before egg-laying on or near the nest scrape. The simple nest scrape is usually made 50–100 m away from water on open, dry ground at low elevation, from where it is easy to spot intruders. It is about 10–15 cm in diameter and is lined with shells, pebbles, animal dung and fragments of vegetation. The Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers usually nest solitary or in loose flocks with their nests being mostly more than 40 m apart; however, they can be sometimes as close as 8 m. Sometimes the old scrape may be reused, probably by the same pair.

Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers lay 1–3 eggs (usually 2) at 1–2 day intervals. They eggs are oval, dark grey-maroon with black speckles giving and overall sand-coloured or light brown background.

Incubation starts once the clutch is completed and is carried out by both parents – usually by the male at night and by the female during the day – for a period of 21–27 days. When a parent leaves the nest during the day or when the nest is approached by a predator, the parent usually covers the eggs up to two thirds or completely with sand within 3–90 s by moving several times around the nest kicking its feet alternately. Newly or partly hatched chicks also get covered. Sometimes the eggs might be left unattended up to 5–7 hours. When the parent returns to the nest, it uncovers the nest before pursuing incubation.

===Parental care===
Once the young have hatched, both parents remove eggshells from nest site. Newly hatched young are downy, their upper parts are grey to white, their back is mottled with a dark median stripe and their underparts are white. The chicks leave the nest within a few hours of hatching or may be brooded on the nest for up to 24 hours. The chicks are precocial and can feed for themselves from 24 hours after hatching; one parent usually leads them to foraging areas up to 1 km away from the nest. Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers exhibit uniparental care, where only one parent (either male or female) stays with the young and broods them in frequent intervals until they can fly at 26–32 days. The parent calls the chicks when inviting them to brood or when danger is present. The parents actively defend their young against conspecifics or intruders by a) feigning injury to attract more attention on themselves by lying flat on the ground, flapping their wings in a helpless manner, fanning their tail or running away or towards intruder, b) false brooding or c) running with head held low, tail drooped and spread wings. 
Chicks and juveniles obtain adult plumage after one year, and some may start breeding at that age.

==Conservation==

===Status and trends===
The IUCN classifies Kittlitz&#x27;s plover as Least Concern. The species is abundant in Africa and locally common in Madagascar, and it has a very wide range. Although not much is known about population trends due to difficulties in assessing the impact of habitat modifications, any declines appear to be below the threshold that would be identified as threatening.

Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is locally very abundant in East, South and Central Africa, with a population size estimated at 100,000–400,000 individuals. West Africa is estimated to sustain 20,000–50,000 individuals. In Madagascar, the population is estimated at 10,000–20,000 individuals, making the species locally common.

===Demography===
Kittlitz&#x27;s plovers are long-lived birds with life-expectancies of almost 10 years, although there is evidence that individuals can live much longer than this.

===Threats===
Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is mainly threatened by habitat loss due to wetland degradation. For example, one of the key wetland sites in southern Africa, Walvis Bay in Namibia, has been subject to degradation and destruction due to the building of roads, disturbance from tourists and wetland reclamation for the development of suburbs and ports. In Ghana, wetlands are threatened by coastal erosion and developments that include drainage and wetland reclamation 

The fraction of the population migrating via the east Atlantic is vulnerable to avian malaria and would be greatly threatened in case of an outbreak of this disease. The same applies to avian botulism, which the Kittlitz&#x27;s plover is susceptible to.

<text>Gerbera ( or ) L. is a genus of plants in the Asteraceae (Compositae) family. The first scientific description of a &quot;Gerbera&quot; was made by J. D. Hooker in Curtis&#x27;s Botanical Magazine in 1889 when he described &quot;Gerbera jamesonii&quot;, a South African species also known as &quot;Transvaal daisy&quot; or &quot;Barberton daisy&quot;. Gerbera is also commonly known as the &quot;African daisy&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The genus was named in honour of German botanist and medical doctor (1710–1743), who travelled extensively in Russia and was a friend of Carl Linnaeus.

== Description ==

&quot;Gerbera&quot; species are tufted, caulescent, perennial herbs, often with woolly crown, up to 80 cm high. Leaves are all in rosette, elliptical with entire or toothed margin or lobed, petiolate or with a petaloid base, pinnately veined, often leathery and felted beneath. Single to several flowering stems from each rosette bear bracteate or ebracteate, simple, one-headed inflorescence-capitulum. Capitula are radiate, with several rows of bracts. Ray florets are female, 2-lipped, the outer lip is large and strap-shaped, inner lip consists of two small, thread-like lobes of white, pink or red, rarely yellow colour. Disc florets are fertile, five-lobed and irregularly 2-lipped with curled petals.

=== Species ===
Formerly included numerous species once considered members of &quot;Gerbera&quot; are now placed in other genera: &quot;Chaptalia&quot;, &quot;Leibnitzia&quot;, &quot;Mairia&quot;, &quot;Perdicium&quot;, &quot;Trichocline&quot;, and &quot;Oreoseris&quot;.

In accordance with International Plant Names Index genus &quot;Gerbera&quot; includes 22 accepted species:

== Distribution ==
&quot;Gerbera&quot; is native to tropical regions of Africa. It was introduced into countries of Latin America and Southeast Asia.

== Uses ==
&quot;Gerbera&quot; is very popular and widely used as a decorative garden plant or as cut flowers. The domesticated cultivars are mostly a result of a cross between &quot;Gerbera jamesonii&quot; and another South African species &quot;Gerbera viridifolia&quot;. The cross is known as Gerbera × hybrida. Thousands of cultivars exist. They vary greatly in shape and size. Colours include white, yellow, orange, red, and pink. The centre of the flower is sometimes black. Often the same flower can have petals of several different colours. The flower-heads (capitula) can be as small as 7 cm (Gerbera &#x27;mini Harley&#x27;) in diameter or up to 12 cm (Gerbera ‘Golden Serena’).

&quot;Gerbera&quot; is also important commercially. It is the fifth most used cut flower in the world (after rose, carnation, chrysanthemum, and tulip). It is also used as a model organism in studying flower formation.

&quot;Gerbera&quot; contains naturally occurring coumarin derivatives. It is attractive to bees, butterflies, and birds, but resistant to deer. Small ones are called gerbrinis.

<text>The Lavender Line is a heritage railway based at Isfield Station, near Uckfield in East Sussex, England.

== History==

The Lavender Line was originally part of the Lewes to Uckfield Railway opened to the public on 18 October 1858. This independent company became part of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) in 1864 to safeguard that company&#x27;s interests east of its London to Brighton main line. Ten years from its opening, Isfield saw through workings from Brighton to Tunbridge Wells and later Tonbridge, via a new Uckfield–Groombridge link. The Uckfield to Lewes section was doubled at this time, though the extension north of Uckfield was single track until 1894.

Prior to 1868 trains from Uckfield travelling south to Lewes joined the Keymer Junction to Lewes line north of Lewes at Hamsey, latterly called the &quot;Hamsey Loop&quot;. In order to avoid reversal of trains to Brighton at Lewes the 1868 works included abandoning the Hamsey Loop with the heavily engineered new line entering Lewes from the east. In Lewes the new line traversed a bridge over the River Ouse then a bridge over Cliffe High Street and some sidings to Lewes Station via a number of embankments and there were two other substantial new bridges further north. The mileage of the line also changed following this route alteration, with the zero milepost now at Brighton, Isfield&#x27;s location was now .

The East Grinstead line, opened in 1882 and closed in 1958, part of which now forms the Bluebell Railway, branched off the line at Culver Junction, near Culver Farm between Lewes and Barcombe Mills (the next station south of Isfield).

== Closure ==

As early as 1964 BR was aware of planned road works in and around the Lewes area, in which a bypass around Lewes was planned. As part of this the building of the Phoenix Causeway (Phase 1 of 3) meant a section of the Lewes to Uckfield railway line was in the way – requiring either a level crossing or a road bridge. BR applied for an Act of Parliament to reinstate the Hamsey loop as there were also concerns about the condition of some of the bridges on the 1878 route. Despite this, in 1966, the local Transport Users&#x27; Consultative Committee received notification from BR that the line from Lewes to Hurst Green Junction was to close in its entirety. This was because the line was one of those proposed for closure as unremunerative in the first Beeching report published in 1963.

Opposition from the many railway travellers resulted. Their case used a motorway costing formula to show that the users would waste some in excess travel compared to BR&#x27;s calculated loss of only . In the end the TUCC upheld the users&#x27; complaints and the line did not close. In early 1968 BR made another attempt to close the line. This time the Transport Minister, Barbara Castle, requested more information from BR, which was furnished to her successor, Richard Marsh, who took over as Transport Minister in April 1968.

From the information requested by his predecessor, and of all the scenarios that were examined by the Minister, he agreed in August 1968 to the closure of the Lewes to Uckfield section of line. Considerable opposition from the users centred, in the first instance, around the inadequate replacement bus service – which had Ministerial approval. The issue was resolved by the Transport Commissioners who, on examination of all the complaints from the users and undertaking the journey themselves, upheld the users&#x27; complaints. Structural problems with the bridge over Cliffe High Street in Lewes were identified, which necessitated single-line working and from January 1969 a revised timetable with trains connecting at Barcombe Mills in place. However concerns over the state of the bridge over Cliffe High Street remained and finally the BR Chief Civil Engineer declared the bridge unsafe. The last train at Isfield was on 24 February 1969 but a rail replacement bus service operated until 6 May, with the station closing on that date, the tickets latterly being sold from the signal box.

The remaining section of the line, from Uckfield to Hurst Green Junction had been refused closure by the Minister as there was a social need for the line and, in accordance with Section 39 of the Transport Act 1968, a subsidy could be paid with Treasury approval for a three-year period.

The route between Lewes and Uckfield has been protected from development in various local and structure plans since the mid-1970s. This attempts to ensure that nothing further is built which could prevent the line from re-opening. This planning policy protection still remained in force in 2008. Sale of the track bed and stations was postponed for some 15 years by a number of unsuccessful attempts to re-open the closed section of line. A short length of track used as a headshunt remained south of Uckfield. This extended to a bridge over the river Uck (approximately north of the present Worth Halt) until the Uckfield bypass (opened 1985) severed the trackbed. Further truncation occurred when Uckfield station was moved north of the high street in 1991.

== Private ownership and initial restoration ==

On 16 June 1983 Isfield railway station was purchased at auction by Dave and Gwen Milham both as a depot for their landscaping business and with restoration of the station in mind. The booking hall and signal box were renovated, the station awning refurbished, and all the platform signs were replaced. The original down platform waiting room had been purchased by the Bluebell Railway in 1978, and resituated at Sheffield Park station. Two months were spent constructing a replica on the original foundations, completed in January 1984. In cooperation with the Bluebell Railway Dave Milham purchased track material from British Rail, made available from work being done at Croydon. Initially track was laid as part of a cosmetic restoration with a static locomotive but this later became a working railway.

Restoration of the station was completed by the spring of 1987 with the reinstatement of of permanent way on the original track bed. A new engine shed was constructed at Isfield as an extension to the owner&#x27;s groundworks machinery shed. The total cost of restoration exceeded according to the Milhams.

The station was named &#x27;The Lavender Line&#x27; since A.E. Lavender and Sons were the local coal merchants who had operated from the station yard. Two engines were purchased for use at the station: &#x27;Annie&#x27;, a Barclay 0-4-0 saddle tank previously in service at Bury Transport Museum, and &#x27;Ugly&#x27;, RSH 0-6-0 saddle tank number 64, purchased while on loan at the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. A third engine, a 2-10-0 built in WWII by the North British Locomotive Company was shipped from Greece to the United Kingdom. The engine was christened &#x27;Dame Vera Lynn&#x27; by Dame Vera Lynn herself at the station on 6 August 1986. This engine proved too large for the then railway, however, and was sold to Clifford Brown, a British-born American businessman living in Virginia, USA. Mr Brown sent the engine to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it now resides.

==Preservation Society==

Mr Milham&#x27;s business failed in 1991 and the Lavender Line was put up for sale, initially for £1.3 million. This sale and a later auction seeking around £500,000 were not successful. Eventually, in November 1992, the railway (without the station house) was bought from Mr Milham&#x27;s bankers by Lavender Line Ltd. The Lavender Line Ltd is in turn controlled by the Lavender Line Preservation Society, a registered charity formed initially by volunteers who had helped Mr Milham. The first public trains under the new owners operated on Sunday 30 May 1993 after significant track alterations required by the Railway Inspectorate. The initial has subsequently been extended to just under with the line terminating at the first of two bridges over the river Uck.

==Stations==
===Isfield===

Isfield station remains the headquarters, operating base, and engineering base of the Lavender Line. Since its restoration in the 1980s the station has been a popular attraction for the local area, and remains a well-celebrated example of a restored period railway station. The station has won awards for its restoration, and proved popular as a location for film and television shoots requiring a period railway station. The original buildings all survive except for the down side platform shelter replaced by a replica used as a shop, though considerable changes have been made to the up side buildings to convert the original booking office, waiting room and lady&#x27;s toilet to a cafe. The station house has been sympathetically extended but is not part of the Lavender Line and remains occupied as a private dwelling. The signal box is now grade 2 listed and does not operate the station.

===Worth Halt===
Work started in December 2011 on building a halt style platform at the Uck river bridge, together with a picnic area. It was opened on the Saturday of the first Diesel Gala in July 2012, and named Worth Halt after the parish in which it lies. The construction of the halt allows passengers to travel between two permanent stations, whilst the line remains limited to its current length.

==Future expansion==
Despite attempts by the &quot;Wealden Line Campaign&quot; to have the line from through Isfield to reopened to passenger traffic, a July 2008 study concluded that although technically feasible, the line would be &quot;economically unviable&quot;. Any reopening might affect the operations of the Lavender Line or entail a move to a new location, but this depends on the details of any final scheme adopted. In any event, the campaign has not succeeded, an application to the &quot;restoring your railway&quot; fund in 2021 having failed.

The Preservation Society has expressed an interest in restoring and reopening the line between Uckfield and Lewes in the long-term future. In December 2008, following the rejection of the reopening proposal, a petition was presented to East Sussex County Council asking it to acquire the trackbed from the Lavender Line&#x27;s northern boundary to the former site of Uckfield station (which had been relocated further north in the meantime), to lease back the section and to allow heritage services to be run over it. In April 2009, the council&#x27;s Director of Transport and Environment recommended that the petition be refused on the basis that a heritage operation would prejudice the reopening of the line and the costs entailed would divert funding away from core Council services. The majority of the old station site in Uckfield has since been converted into a carpark though one of the platforms remains.

Extension to the south is difficult due to the need to reopen the level crossing on Station Road (against ORR policy) while extension to the north would require the two bridges over the river Uck to be refurbished and would only be able to reach Uckfield bypass which blocks access to the station site in Uckfield. Any reinstatement as part of Network Rail would require a new, elevated, station in Uckfield to allow the bypass to be bridged.

<text>E-Plus was a mobile telecommunications operator in Germany. With more than 25 million subscribers, E-Plus was the third largest mobile operator in Germany, until the takeover from Telefónica Germany in October, 2014.

== Ownership ==
E-Plus was owned by Dutch telecommunications operator KPN since 2002. In July 2013, Telefónica Germany announced a planned takeover. The deal was approved by KPN shareholders in October 2013. The merger was delayed because of concerns by the European Commission on reduced competition in the German mobile market. In July 2014, the European Commission approved the merger, conditional on E-Plus giving up some frequencies and network capacity.

== Network ==
=== First GSM license ===
The company was awarded Germany&#x27;s first DCS-1800 (later renamed GSM-1800, also known as E-Netz (de; &quot;lit. E-Network&quot;) in Germany) license in 1993. One term of the licence was that no further Mobile network operator could be started within 3 years of the start of the network.

The network started operation as a &quot;metropolitan&quot; network, with coverage only in the biggest cities, in 1994. The coverage area was expanded rapidly, but for years the network&#x27;s image was hampered by the view that its coverage was lacking. As a countermeasure, voicemail retrieval was free of charge for the first of years of operation, and calls were billed in six-second increments (in contrast to the one-minute increments of the other networks); after text messaging was introduced, it too was free for some time.

E-Plus was the second network in Germany to offer prepaid tariffs to its customers (after T-Mobile&#x27;s XtraCard) and later introduced HSCSD, which boosts data rates on GSM networks to analogue modem speed levels. Shortly after that, E-Plus upgraded its network to support GPRS. They now also operate a 3G UMTS network.

=== Developments since 2006 ===
In February 2006, after the EGSM900-band, which was in military use before, had become available in late 2005, the German regulation authority &quot;Federal Network Agency&quot; assigned two 2 x 5 MHz channels to E-Plus and O2 Germany. In return, E-Plus and O2 Germany had to give up some GSM1800 frequencies to two competitive operators T-Mobile and Vodafone. The first EGSM900-base stations (cell sites) started operation in April 2006. In March 2007 E-Plus outsourced deployment, management and maintenance of its network to Alcatel-Lucent and thereby transferred 750 employees to the latter company.

E-Plus provides network access to numerous virtual operators, such as Base, Blau Mobilfunk, ALDI Talk, Simyo, VIVA, JambaSIM. It also owns and operates AY YILDIZ, a mobile brand aimed at the Turks in Germany, offering affordable calls to Turkey and roaming in Turkish networks.

E-Plus was the first company to introduce i-mode in Germany.

At the end of February 2014, E-Plus and ZTE announced that ZTE would take over Managed Services of E-Plus.

On March 5. 2014, E-Plus started commercial LTE service in Berlin, Leipzig and Nuremberg by using 10 MHz out possible of 20 MHz bandwidth of the 1800 MHz frequency.

On March 12. 2014, E-Plus announced the launch of HD Voice.

On July 1. 2016, LTE was shut down by its new owner Telefónica Germany.

<text>The Mamaku Ranges are a mountain range in the North Island of New Zealand. Located to the west of Lake Rotorua and north of Lake Taupō, they lie to the immediate south of the Kaimai Range and can be thought of as an extension of it, in much the same way that the Kaimai Range can be considered an extension of the Coromandel Range. The hills terminate in the south with the valley of the Waikato River. There were at one time numerous bush railways that ran over and through the Ranges. One disused line has been developed for tourism.

At their highest, the Mamaku Ranges rise to over , and much of the high ground within the hills forms a plateau. The range is extensively forested, with the Kaimai-Mamaku State Forest and Kinleith Forest both covering a considerable part of them. The forest includes kauri trees growing at the far southern limit of their natural range. Some Kauri can be accessed via the Rapurapu Kauri Track.

<text>The Dwarves Must Die is the 2004 release by the American punk band Dwarves. It is the band&#x27;s first release on the &quot;Sympathy for the Record Industry&quot; label. There are several cameos, including Dexter Holland from The Offspring, Jula Bell from Bulimia Banquet, Nash Kato from Urge Overkill, desert rock icon Nick Oliveri, Josh Freese from The Vandals, Spike Slawson from Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, gangster rapper San Quinn, DJ Marz, and even the original Space Ghost himself, Gary Owens. The rather freeform departure from the standard thrash/punk/noise sound is obvious in this release, slightly more so than in previous Dwarves productions, perhaps because they have been producing music for almost 20 years; however the original sound of the Dwarves shows clearly in several tracks.

The title track appears on the soundtrack for the 2009 comedy film &quot;Observe and Report&quot;.

<text>Stichodactylidae is a family of sea anemones that contains the genera &quot;Stichodactyla&quot; (carpet anemones) and &quot;Radianthus&quot;. These species reside exclusively within the shallow waters of the tropical Indo-Pacific area and are in the main family of sea anemones that hosts several varieties of clownfishes. Most species of sea anemones are harmless to humans, but at least some species of the genus &quot;Stichodactyla&quot; are highly venomous and their sting may cause anaphylactic shock and organ failure (notably acute liver failure). In contrast, the venom of &quot;Radianthus&quot; spp. has shown potential in the treatment of lung cancer.

==Discovery==
C. Collingwood first reported species of the genus &quot;Stichodactylidae&quot; in 1868 after taking note of the existence of gigantic sea-anemones in the China Sea, containing quasi-parasitic fish.

==Genera and species==
The following species are recognized within the family Stichodactylidae:

*Genus &quot;Radianthus&quot; 
**&quot;Radianthus crispa&quot; 
**&quot;Radianthus doreensis&quot; 
**&quot;Radianthus magnifica&quot; 
**&quot;Radianthus malu&quot; 

*Genus &quot;Stichodactyla&quot; (carpet anemones)
**&quot;Stichodactyla gigantea&quot; 
**&quot;Stichodactyla haddoni&quot; 
**&quot;Stichodactyla helianthus&quot;

<doc id="1160787" wikidata="Q63821" url="?curid=1160787" title="Chokutō">
<text>The is a straight, single-edged Japanese sword that was mainly produced prior to the 9th century. Its basic style is likely derived from similar swords of ancient China. Chokutō were used on foot for stabbing or slashing and were worn hung from the waist. Until the Heian period such swords were called , distinct from &quot;tachi&quot; written as , as the latter refers to curved swords.

== History ==
The production of swords in Japan is divided into specific time periods:
* Jōkotō (ancient swords, until around 900 CE)
* Kotō (old swords from around 900–1596)
* Shintō (new swords 1596–1780)
* Shinshintō (new new swords 1781–1876)
* Gendaitō (modern or contemporary swords 1876–present)

The &quot;tsurugi&quot; was the earliest type of sword made in Japan. The &quot;chokutō&quot;, on the other hand, was among the earliest types of sword to be forged in Japan, its basic style and forging techniques probably originated in ancient China and Korea. The &quot;chokutō&quot; was brought to Japan by way of Korean Peninsula and China in the Han dynasty times.

There are various types of &quot;chokutō&quot; in the Kofun period (300－538), and there are styles originated in China and styles unique to Japan. The is a Chinese style, characterized by a ring-shaped ornament shaped like a dragon or a phoenix on the tip of the handle. The is a unique Japanese style with a fist-like decoration on the tip of the handle. The is also unique to Japan and is decorated with deer antlers. As the name suggests, this style is also applied to &quot;tsurugi&quot;.

The &quot;chokutō&quot; in various styles including these styles declined around the end of the Asuka period (593－710), and only the style called the &quot;hōtō-tachi&quot; (方頭大刀), in which the decoration on the tip of the handle was rectangular parallelepiped, survived from the Nara period (710－794).

&quot;Chokutō&quot; typically come in &quot;hira-zukuri&quot; and &quot;kiriha-zukuri tsukurikomi&quot; (blade styles) which make them very distinct from later &quot;tachi&quot; and &quot;katana&quot; which rarely use these forms. Swords of this period are classified as &quot;jōkotō&quot; and are often referred to in distinction from Japanese swords.

&quot;Chokutō&quot; as a weapon died out by the middle of the Heian period, in the 10th century. And as a weapon, it was completely replaced by the Japanese sword, which is known today for its deep and graceful curves. The first sword with this curve was called &quot;Kenukigata-tachi&quot; (:ja:毛抜形太刀), which was made by improving &quot;Warabitetō&quot; (:ja:蕨手刀) used by Emishi in Tohoku region. And &quot;Kenukigata-tachi&quot; evolved into &quot;tachi&quot;, which became the mainstream of Japanese swords for a long time.

== &quot;Sugari no Ontachi&quot; ==
In today&#x27;s Japan, straight swords made with the techniques after &quot;chokutō&quot;, are also called &quot;chokutō&quot;, and these are sometimes used in traditional ceremonies. The &quot;Sugari no Ontachi&quot; () is one of the &quot;chokutō&quot; made as an offering to Amaterasu, the main enshrined &quot;kami&quot; of Ise Grand Shrine, and one of the most gorgeous sword mountings among the &quot;chokutō&quot;. According to tradition, the building of Ise Grand Shrine and its sacred treasures have been recreated to the same specifications every 20 years since the seventh century. The &quot;Sugari no Ontachi&quot; was first described in the compiled in 804, and it is believed that new decorations were added to the scabbard and sword fittings at each subsequent &quot;Shikinen Sengu&quot; (Rebuild every 20 years, 式年遷宮) to complete the design as we know it today. The &quot;Sugari no Ontachi&quot; currently offered to Ise Grand Shrine was remade in 2013 and is thought to have accurately inherited the style of sword mountings from the Heian period (794－1185) and the forging method from the Sinto period (1596－1781).

<text>Too Dark Park is the sixth studio album by the industrial music group Skinny Puppy. The album cover features the debut appearance of the band&#x27;s &quot;SP&quot; logo. The cover art was created by Vancouver based artist Jim Cummins.
The artwork for this album and its associated singles was inspired by cosmic horror stories such as the Cthulhu Mythos. Lyrical themes include collapse of society due to destruction of nature, drug addiction, and psychological issues.

The album was recorded &quot;spontaneously&quot; at Mushroom Studios and mixed at Little Mountain Sound Studios in Vancouver, British Columbia. Though guitar is used throughout, the album takes a step back from the Ministry-inspired direction of the band&#x27;s previous release, favoring instead a more chaotic, electronic sound. Two of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Tormentor&quot; and &quot;Spasmolytic&quot;, were released as singles, the latter of which was accompanied by a music video. Guest performers on the album include Canadian music producer Greg Reely and Skinny Puppy&#x27;s longtime producer Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie playing guitar on the songs &quot;Nature&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;T.F.W.O.&quot;.

Since its release, &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; has received generally positive reviews from critics. The album has been commended for its haunting electronic riffs and use of sampling, though some have noted that the music&#x27;s disturbing nature could be off-putting to some listeners. The group promoted the album with the &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; tour, which encompassed much of the United States and Canada. Though a live album has never been released, some live recordings from the tour have been featured on other Skinny Puppy releases, namely &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Spasmolytic&quot; single.

==Background==
Following its production, the members of the band maintained that they were satisfied with their fifth full-length studio effort, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Rabies&quot;. In 1990, keyboardist Dwayne Goettel stated the following regarding the band&#x27;s attitude towards the album: &quot;we all like it, and I can see the worry in people&#x27;s eyes, but it doesn&#x27;t worry us. We did it, and we like it, and I&#x27;m not worried about doing another just like it, you know?&quot; He proclaimed &quot;Rabies&quot; to be his favorite out of all other Skinny Puppy albums and went on to say that he would not mind &quot;doing another just like it&quot;. Goettel told Karen Woods of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; that he didn&#x27;t feel &quot;trapped&quot; by the direction taken on &quot;Rabies&quot; and went on to say that &quot;it [the album] may have been hanging around in the same territory as Ministry, but we were just crossing paths&quot;.

These kinds of sentiments would, however, not last for long. Goettel revealed in 1991 that he had changed his position concerning &quot;Rabies&quot;, stating that while some of the material present on the album was &quot;great&quot;, the completed product was &quot;less within the Skinny Puppy vision&quot;. Goettel even went on to criticize the album&#x27;s cover art and made mention of how the group had begun to receive fan mail inquiring as to whether Skinny Puppy was becoming a &quot;hardcore&quot; group. cEvin Key (drums/keyboards) claimed that he had been dubious about the album&#x27;s production from the start. Key claimed that he had been &quot;pissed off&quot; with regards to singer/songwriter Nivek Ogre&#x27;s apparent partiality for Ministry over Skinny Puppy, but stated that he acknowledged why Ogre had made this choice (it being a change of pace for Ogre).

Of all the troubles with &quot;Rabies&quot;, Key was most displeased with Al Jourgensen&#x27;s role in the recording process, claiming that he believed Jourgensen&#x27;s intention during production was to try and break up the band. Ogre himself was unhappy with &quot;Rabies&quot;, declaring that he felt he had &quot;flopped&quot; during its production. Ogre went on to proclaim the following concerning his experience: &quot;I was really unsure of myself and unsure of what I wanted to say and do. The work and artistic environment really weren&#x27;t there at all either. It was completely negative&quot;.

Following the completion of &quot;Rabies&quot;, the three band members began to explore various side projects. Ogre went on tour with Ministry, having been credited as a songwriter on two songs from &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; and having introduced Jourgensen to Angela Lukacin, who was sampled on &quot;Dream Song&quot;. On the tour, he was playing keyboard and providing vocals (Ogre can be seen and heard on the &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot; video and CD). Ogre also provided vocals for the Revolting Cocks (a Ministry side project) album &quot;Beers, Steers, and Queers&quot;. Key and Goettel pursued a number of different projects during this time. The first of which was Hilt, a collaboration with Don Harrison of the Sons of Freedom and vocalist Al Nelson. Dave &quot;Rave&quot; Ogilvie was also a part of the project. Doubting Thomas was the second Key and Goettel project, featuring primarily instrumental compositions. The third and final project was titled Cyberaktif. Cyberaktif was a collaboration between Key and Bill Leeb from the band Front Line Assembly, with Goettel acting predominantly as a support musician. The focus on these projects led to speculation that Skinny Puppy had disbanded. Steven Gilmore, Skinny Puppy&#x27;s long time art director, had claimed during an interview with Key and Ogre that Sire Records had relayed to MTV that the group was no more; Ogre asserted that &quot;it&#x27;s a lot of talk and talk can only be justified when it&#x27;s actually seen&quot;. The energy and enthusiasm generated from this diverse array of side projects would ultimately culminate into what would become the &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; record, which Key described as &quot;the follow up to the last pure Puppy album&quot;, &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;.

==Production and music==
Nivek Ogre had been invited to join the Revolting Cocks on tour in 1990, having previously provided vocals on their 1988 tour. Ogre declined the offer, explaining his reason why to &quot;Alternative Press&quot; in 1991:
With Ogre no longer committed to the Revolting Cocks tour and all side projects taken on by Key and Goettel completed, Skinny Puppy reassembled in studio to begin production on a new album. Goettel stated that the intention in making &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; was, in a way, an effort to reassess &quot;everything&quot; about Skinny Puppy. Key indicated that by fixing the mistakes that had been made on the previous record, there would then be the opportunity to return to the band&#x27;s original aspirations. The group aimed for their first album of the 1990s to have a new sound and achieved this by taking what had worked well for them in the previous decade and incorporated it with fresh ideas. This also meant hiring a new art director, Jim Cummins, as Goettel had explained that the band&#x27;s album artwork had been &quot;stagnating&quot;.

On the origins of the album&#x27;s title, Key has stated that it was meant to be a rhyme on words. He mentions that during the writing process, the band took notice to the fact that the material they were coming up with was becoming &quot;really dark&quot; and thus crafted the title &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;. The album explores a number of concepts, especially those pertaining to environmental degradation and the self-destruction of humanity. Ogre described the basis for the album&#x27;s underlying message as the following: &quot;that feeling of going down a road with the knowledge that you&#x27;re breaking down. Yet you continue to travel down that road.&quot; The album also explores more personal territory, particularly Ogre&#x27;s dealings with heroin. Ogre revealed to &quot;Alternative Press&quot; how he had nearly been arrested for possession while working in Chicago and how that incident had nearly brought his career to an end.

As is typical for the band, the music contains an array of samples from horror films, television shows, and documentaries. The song &quot;Convulsion&quot; contains samples from the 1967 documentary &quot;LSD-25&quot; as well as from the Japanese erotic horror anime &quot;Legend of the Overfiend&quot; (the sound effects heard at the beginning of the song). &quot;Tormentor&quot; contains a line from the Bob Clark&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;From the Hip&quot;. &quot;Natures Revenge&quot; samples the 1989 film &quot;Communion&quot; while &quot;Shore Lined Poison&quot; samples the 1967 film &quot;The Trip&quot;. The song &quot;Morpheus Laughing&quot; contains a sample of actor Bruce Willis saying the line &quot;they appeared to me as if in a dream&quot; from a &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; skit on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The song &quot;T.F.W.O.&quot; features the line &quot;you have to fuck life&quot; from the 1973 horror film &quot;Flesh for Frankenstein&quot; and &quot;Reclamation&quot; contains samples from the 1988 horror film &quot;&quot; and the 1978 animated adaptation of &quot;Watership Down&quot;.

The album was produced by cEvin Key and Dave Ogilvie, and recorded at Mushroom Studios with the additional aid of Ken Marshall. The album was mixed at Little Mountain Sound Studios by Ken Marshall, Dave Ogilvie, and Greg Reely.

==Release==
&quot;Too Dark Park&quot; was released worldwide on October 30, 1990. For its initial release, the CD featured a full color fold out booklet on which the liner notes were printed. Later pressings featured a stapled booklet with only the front cover being colored in. The 1998 and 2004 reissue once again contain the full color fold out booklet, with somewhat reworked artwork and disc design. The initial pressing released in the UK had the same catalogue number as pressings released in the US; &quot;printed in the U.S.A.&quot; was digitally edited to read &quot;printed in the U.K.&quot;. In the US, Capitol Records promoted the album&#x27;s release by distributing cardboard masks based on the monsters featured in Jim Cummins&#x27; cover artwork.

The song &quot;Tormentor&quot; was released as a single and featured an alternative version of the song &quot;Nature&#x27;s Revenge&quot; as well as the B-side &quot;Bark&quot;. &quot;Spasmolytic&quot; was released as a single in 1991; a music video was produced for commercial airplay. A VHS version of the video was distributed for use in dance clubs and video shows.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Too Dark Park&quot; was well received upon its release in 1990, 
with critics like &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s Staci Bonner declaring the record to be the band&#x27;s &quot;return to the bloodbath&quot;. Bonner gave the most praise to the album&#x27;s sampling, calling the technique&#x27;s use &quot;artful&quot;, and concluded that &quot;you can be a &#x27;spun web deluded of life&#x27; or a &#x27;crushed velvet corpse&#x27; because with Skinny Puppy, everyday is Halloween.&quot; Jean Carey of the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; praised the album, describing it as the band&#x27;s &quot;watershed moment&quot;, and calling attention to the &quot;vaguely central theme&quot; of environmental destruction. Steven Perez of the &quot;Tampa Tribune&quot; also took note of the album&#x27;s &quot;environmental kick&quot;, saying &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;&#x27;s &quot;impressiveness lies beyond the mirage of its droning industrial instrumentation&quot;. Sandra A. Garcia of &quot;B-Side&quot; magazine also spoke highly of the record, calling it &quot;superb&quot; and a &quot;step regained&quot; following &quot;Rabies&quot;. Garcia described the album as &quot;dark and dense&quot;, and declared that the band was once again in full control of their music.

Alex Henderson of AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars, describing it a &quot;forceful and consistently abrasive&quot;, but at the same time danceable. Henderson approved of the album&#x27;s &quot;twisted&quot; sampling, distorted synth work, and use of guitar, and concluded that while the album was a must have for fans of industrial music, newcomers may be put off by its chaotic sound and would find it best to start off with the genre&#x27;s more accessible offerings. Daniel Lukes of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described the album as &quot;controlled chaos at its most unsettling&quot; and that it reflected Skinny Puppy at the height of their creativity. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; magazine described &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; as &quot;environmentally minded&quot; and likened the gloomy musical style employed on the songs &quot;Nature&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Morpheus Laughing&quot; to those of new wave acts such as Joy Division and Gary Numan. Martin Aston in Q Magazine noted that the album &quot;quakes with the usual quotient of fury and frustration (...) matched only by the relentlessly crushing beats of their electronic hardcore throb&quot;.

In a mixed review for &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, Diana Valois said the album was &quot;harsher in parts&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous releases, and approved of the songs &quot;Nature&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Rash Reflection&quot; for &quot;rising above the muddled, angry morass&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; also gave the album a mixed review, stating that while fans of alternative music would enjoy it, there was not much to offer that couldn&#x27;t be found in other, more accessible groups such as Ministry.

Not all critics were as receptive to &quot;Too Dark Park&quot;. In a negative review for the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, Mark Tremblay likened the band to an &quot;environmental punk version of Hawkwind&quot;. Mitchell May of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the album two out of four stars, saying that &quot;not only do they apparently care very little about actually selling records, but they openly defy the listener to like them.&quot; Gigen Mammoser of &quot;Vice&quot; noted that &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; was &quot;the rejection of a genre headed increasingly towards mainstream acceptance.&quot; Mammoser described the album as &quot;frightening&quot; and likened it to a mental disorder. Though he had mixed feelings towards the album, Mammoser admitted to &quot;dusting it off&quot; for a listen on certain occasions.

In 2013, Francois Marchand of the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; named &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; one of the best albums to come out of Mushroom Studios, describing it as a &quot;nightmarish vortex of hard-hitting electronic rock&quot;. &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; placed &quot;Too Dark Park&quot; on their list of the best 10 industrial metal albums as well as the 10 best industrial music albums, describing its &quot;dance-floor beats&quot; and &quot;raw screaming noise&quot; as the antithesis of the techno scene.

<text>This is a list of the abunas of Ethiopia, the spiritual heads of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The Abuna of Ethiopia is known officially as &quot;His Holiness Patriarch and Catholicos of Ethiopia, Archbishop of Axum and Ichege of the See of St. Tekle Haymanot&quot;. The current Abuna, Mathias, acceded to this position on 28 February 2013.

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is part of the Oriental Orthodox communion, and it was granted autocephaly by Cyril VI, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church, in 1959.

==Bishops of Axum==
==Metropolitan Archbishops of Axum and of All Ethiopia==
On 13 July 1948, the Coptic Orthodox and Ethiopian churches reached an agreement that led to the elevation of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church to the rank of an Autonomous Church; allowing the Archbishop of All Ethiopia to consecrate on his own bishops and metropolitans for the Ethiopian Church and to form a local Holy Synod. The Archbishop, however, is consecrated by the Pope of Alexandria along with the members of the Holy Synod of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

==Patriarchs and Catholicoi of All Ethiopia==
In 1959, the Coptic Orthodox Church granted autocephaly to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and elevated the Archbishop to the Patriarchal dignity and was enthroned with the title of: Patriarch and Re&#x27;ese Liqane Papasat Echege (Catholicos) of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. The title of Ichege (Supreme Abbot) of the See of St. Tekle Haymanot of Debre Libanos was subsumed into the Patriarchate. The title of Ichege was revived and the title of Archbishop of Axum was added to the Patriarchal titles in 2005, as Axum was the seat of Ethiopia&#x27;s first Bishop, St. Frumentius, and thus the oldest see in the church.

<doc id="1160801" wikidata="Q158496" url="?curid=1160801" title="Althaea officinalis">
<text>Althaea officinalis, the marsh mallow or marshmallow, is a species of flowering plant indigenous to Europe, Western Asia and North Africa, which is used in herbalism and as an ornamental plant. A confection made from the root since ancient Egyptian times evolved into today&#x27;s marshmallow treat, but most modern marshmallow treats no longer contain marsh-mallow root.

==Description==
This herbaceous perennial grows to tall and puts out only a few lateral branches. The whole plant is softly stellate-hairy, especially the leaves, which are broadly triangular to oval, often with 3-5 shallow lobes, irregularly toothed, with cordate to cuneate bases. Leaf size varies considerably, up to long, and wide. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, with no stipules, on petioles up to .

The inflorescences occur in the leaf axils and at the top of the stem and consist of panicles of 1-many flowers. The flowers are actinomorphic with 5 lilac/pink petals up to 2 cm long and 5 green sepals which are much shorter than the petals, and fused at the base. Below the petals is a cup-shaped epicalyx with 6-9 narrow, triangular lobes, half the length of the sepals. The purple stamens are united into a tube, the anthers kidney-shaped and one-celled. There is one style which protrudes above the stamen tube.

The flowers are in bloom during August and September, and are followed, as in other species of this order, by the flat, round fruit which are popularly called &quot;cheeses&quot;. The whole fruit is a schizocarp, about 1 cm in diameter, which splits into about 20 kidney-shaped mericarps (seeds) about 2 mm long.

The common mallow is frequently called &quot;marsh mallow&quot; in colloquial terms, but the true marsh mallow is distinguished from all the other mallows growing in Great Britain by the numerous divisions of the outer calyx (six to nine cleft), by the hoary down which thickly clothes the stems and foliage, and by the numerous panicles of blush-coloured flowers, paler than the common mallow. The roots are perennial, thick, long and tapering, very tough and pliant, whitish yellow outside, white and fibrous within.

===Phytochemicals===
Chemical constituents include altheahexacosanyl lactone (&quot;n&quot;-hexacos-2-enyl-1,5-olide), 2β-hydroxycalamene (altheacalamene) and altheacoumarin glucoside (5,6-dihydroxycoumarin-5-dodecanoate-6β--glucopyranoside), along with the known phytoconstituents lauric acid, β-sitosterol and lanosterol.

==Uses==
===Ornamental===
Marshmallows are used in gardening as ornamental plants.

===Herbal medicine===

The leaves, flowers and the root of &quot;A. officinalis&quot; (marshmallow) have been used in traditional herbal medicine. This use is reflected in the name of the genus, which comes from the Greek (&quot;&quot;), meaning &quot;to heal&quot;. The Latin specific epithet &quot;officinalis&quot; indicates plants with some culinary or medicinal value.

Marshmallow is traditionally used as relief for irritation of mucous membranes, including use as a gargle for mouth and throat ulcers and gastric ulcers.

===Culinary===
Most of the mallows have been used as food, and are mentioned by early classic writers with this connection. Mallow was an edible vegetable among the Romans; a dish of marsh mallow was one of their delicacies. Prospero Alpini stated in 1592 that a plant of the mallow kind was eaten by the Egyptians. Many of the poorer inhabitants of Syria subsisted for weeks on herbs, of which marshmallow is one of the most common. When boiled first and fried with onions and butter, the roots are said to form a palatable dish. In times of scarcity consequent upon the failure of the crops, this plant, which grows in Syria in great abundance, is collected heavily as a foodstuff.

The young leaves can be cooked. The flower buds can be pickled. The roots can be peeled, sliced, boiled and sweetened to make candy. Water used to boil any part of the plant can be used as an egg white substitute.

<doc id="1160803" wikidata="Q1074225" url="?curid=1160803" title="Mokoia Island">
<text>Mokoia Island is located in Lake Rotorua in New Zealand. It has an area of 1.35 square kilometres. The uninhabited island is a rhyolite lava dome, rising to 180 metres above the lake surface. It was formed after the Rotorua caldera collapsed and rhyolitic magma was pushed through the cracks. One of the cracks was below where Mokoia island is today. The foreshores of the island have geothermal springs with hot spring water forming the Hinemoa pool, known to locals as Waikimihia. It also has very rich volcanic soil, which was why the local Māori grew kūmara on it. The stone statue of Matuatonga on the island protected the island&#x27;s kūmara crop, and tohunga would bring seed kūmara to touch the statue. It was also a very good strategic location, which was why it was often fought over.

Mokoia Island is privately owned by local Māori iwi, who run it in conjunction with the New Zealand Department of Conservation. It is a bird sanctuary and access is limited to tour parties only. It is home to several rare species, including the North Island kōkako, the North Island brown kiwi, and a breeding population of the endangered North Island saddleback.

The island is also the location of regular Mau rākau training camps in the Māori martial art of taiaha.

==Hinemoa and Tūtānekai==
The island is sacred to Māori of the Te Arawa iwi, and is the location of one of the most famous legends of New Zealand, that of Hinemoa and Tūtānekai, which has parallels with the classical Greek tale of Hero and Leander.

According to legend, the two lovers were forbidden to marry, and Hinemoa&#x27;s father Umukaria, a chief from the shores of the lake, ordered that she not be allowed to travel by canoe to Tūtānekai&#x27;s tribal village on the island. Hinemoa decided to swim 3.2 kilometres across the lake to the island, guided by the sound of Tūtānekai&#x27;s flute-playing. For flotation she wrapped rushes (a type of reed) around her and swam her way to the island. According to another version, she made a flotation device from gourds.

The island is the setting of the Te Arawa version of the widely known traditional Māori love song &quot;Pōkarekare Ana&quot;, which references the story of Hinemoa and Tūtānekai. The lyrics imply Hinemoa&#x27;s crossing the lake to reach Tūtānekai.

<doc id="1160811" wikidata="Q7170851" url="?curid=1160811" title="Perth Football Club">
<text>The Perth Football Club, nicknamed the Demons, is an Australian rules football club based in Lathlain, Western Australia, currently playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL).

Representing the south-east area of the Perth metropolitan region, the club currently trains and plays its home games at Lathlain Park (currently known, for sponsorship reasons, as Mineral Resources Park), having previously played at the WACA Ground between 1899 and 1958 and later in 1987 and 1988.

The club was founded in 1899 and began play in the First Rate Junior Association, but was promoted to the WAFL after eight games to replace the Rovers Football Club after they dropped out of the league and folded, with Perth drawing much of its inaugural WAFL squad from Rovers. Perth won its first premiership in 1907, but did not win their second until 1955. Overall, the club has won seven premierships, including a hat-trick between 1966 and 1968, with the last coming in 1977. Perth is statistically one of the least successful teams in the competition, and has not played in a grand final since 1978. The club have also endured lengthy finals droughts from 1986 to 1997, and again between from 1997 to 2020.

The current coach of the club is Mark Stone, who took over from Peter German prior to the 2024 WAFL season.

==History==
Formed in 1899, Perth is the fourth-oldest of the nine WAFL clubs. The club played its early football in the Perth First Rate Junior Competition before replacing Rovers mid-way during the 1899 WAFA season after was unable to continue. The club enjoyed success in the latter part of the 1900s, winning its first premiership in controversial circumstances in 1907: the club originally lost the grand final against by five points, but this was amended to a one-point victory after Perth successfully protested that the free kick from which one of East Fremantle&#x27;s goals was scored was awarded after the half time bell. The two clubs faced each other again in the 1908 and 1909 grand finals, East Fremantle victorious on both occasions.
Perth remained competitive for the following decade despite a brief lapse that saw them fall to last in 1912. In the 1915 Grand Final they dominated against Subiaco but could not convert, losing a low-scoring game 2.7 (19) to 3.3 (21). During the war years Perth continued to be prominent, finishing third in each of 1916, 1917 and 1918, but following the end of the war Perth (or Victoria Park as they were known in 1934 and 1935) was to have a long period in the doldrums. In the twenty-five open-age seasons from 1919 to 1946 Perth played in the finals only three times for just one win over East Perth in 1934. This record is made much worse by the fact that up to 1925 before were admitted four of six teams played off and to 1933 four of seven did so. From 1921 to 1923 the club suffered the ignominy of a hat-trick of wooden spoons, and though it became more competitive in the ensuing decade only in 1927, 1934 and 1939 did the Redlegs win more games than they lost. Despite the team&#x27;s lack of collective success, Perth in the inter-war years was home to a number of outstanding players, including ruckman/forward Doug Oliphant, pacy centreman Cyril Hoft and full-forwards Alan Evans (who against East Fremantle in 1921 kicked thirteen of fourteen goals) and Albert Gook.

Like most clubs, Perth lost a number of players due to the First and Second World Wars, with many players enlisted in the Australian Defence Force. In total, nineteen Perth players were killed on active duty in the two wars. Anthony Alexander Forrest, who played two games for the club in 1900, was killed in the Second Boer War in 1901.

===Postwar power and relocation===
Despite its failures at senior level up to 1946, Perth reached the preliminary final of the 1944 underage competition, and aided by inequitable metropolitan zoning, this group of young players allowed the club to become finals regulars along with , and from 1947 to 1951. Perth eventually settled as third in the WANFL pecking order during this period, and surprisingly even took a first-ever minor premiership in 1949 before making its first grand final for thirty-four years, only to lose to a more hardened West Perth. In 1950 they reversed the 1949 Grand Final result against the Cardinals but lost narrowly to an inaccurate South Fremantle in the premiership decider.

The next four years saw Perth decline somewhat, winning only six games in 1952 and being unconvincing against the might of South Fremantle and West Perth in the other three seasons. However, with champion ruckman Merv McIntosh desperate to see his team with a premiership, Perth under experienced former Carlton centreman Ern Henfry and captain Keith Harper, improved in 1955 to win fourteen of twenty minor round games and defeat the Cardinals in the first semi-final. They then upset South by twelve points and came back on a windy day to defeat East Fremantle by two points in the 1955 WANFL Grand Final for their first premiership in forty-eight years. McIntosh crowned his last game winning the Simpson Medal for best on field.

In the following four years Perth remained a force – most notably in nearly keeping East Perth goalless on a rain-drenched WACA in early 1956 – but could never overcome the Royals or East Fremantle in the finals. In order to draw closer to their metropolitan recruiting zone on the southern side of the Swan River, the club moved in 1959 to a new home at Lathlain Park. Their first game there was on Anzac Day and they beat Swan Districts, but that year ended ingloriously against Subiaco – for years the WANFL&#x27;s &quot;chopping block&quot; – who in their first final since Perth&#x27;s rise to power in 1947 kicked an amazing 16.8 (104) in the third quarter.

===1960s and 1970s dynasties===
Perth took a while to recover from this caning and finished seventh, sixth and sixth in the following three seasons, but aided by a vigorous junior football council and strong support from local businesses, the Demons soon returned as a force despite twice failing in the finals in 1963 and 1964 and dropping to fifth in 1965 with ten wins from twenty-one games.

The appointment of Malcolm Atwell as captain-coach in 1966 was at first controversial, but with such young players as Barry Cable, Perth more than fulfilled the most sanguine expectations. The Demons thrashed South Fremantle by 143 points in the opening game and from then on were always the team to beat, scoring a 16-point win over East Perth in the 1966 Grand Final. The next year, in 1967, the same clubs played off with a similar result – with the margin stretched to 18 points. Then in 1968 it was Perth, again over East Perth, by 24 points. In each case Perth was led by Atwell, with Cable collecting three Simpson Medals for brilliant best-on-ground roving performances. In 1970 the Demons were favoured to win a fourth flag in five years, but were convincingly upset by South Fremantle despite having more scoring shots.

1971, despite the return of Barry Cable from North Melbourne where he had transferred in 1970, saw Perth decline abruptly to seventh or eight with only eight wins and a draw, and after a return to third in 1972, Cable&#x27;s last year with the club in 1973 saw them win only six games (their worst year since 1941 when they won only four matches). Perth, however, rebounded under the coaching of former captain and 1955 premiership player Ken Armstrong. He took their 1974 team, skippered by the versatile Bob Shields, into the Grand Final. Though wingman David Pretty won the Simpson Medal, Perth failed against East Fremantle, and missed the finals in 1975. However, despite not being perfectly consistent during the home-and-away round, the Demons under new captain Colin Lofts clicked when it counted, taking out the 1976 Grand Final by 23 points, again at the expense of East Perth. Courageous defender, Mal Day, won the Simpson Medal for an outstanding game. Except when affected by a major injury to star rover Robert Wiley, the Demons dominated in 1977, capping the season off with a record 26.13 (169) Grand Final winning score against East Fremantle. Ruckman Wim Rosbender marked his best season, winning the Simpson Medal.

Armstrong and new captain Ken Inman had high hopes of another premiership hat-trick with big wins during the 1978 season. Their goal was denied by just two points in a grand final marred by very wet conditions.

===Long-term decline===
After three decades among the WANFL elite, Perth declined abruptly in 1979, winning only eight games of twenty-one and finishing a distant sixth. The departure of Armstrong to Subiaco in 1980 only made things worse: despite the presence of a fine coach in Alan Joyce for two seasons, Perth never improved upon 1979&#x27;s sixth place between 1980 and 1985 and won only 28 of its 126 games. The recruitment of proven coach Mal Brown that year was hoped to make the Demons a WAFL power, but after finishing third in 1986 the club was devastated by the loss of players to new VFL club West Coast and fell back down the ladder, ultimately taking wooden spoons in 1993 and 1994 and not being able to stay far from the bottom.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the club also had severe financial problems, so bad that in 1990 after losing revenue from gate pooling and the WAFC being forced to pay the West Coast Eagles&#x27; licence fee as its holder, the Demons had to raise $100,000 to avoid folding at the close of the season. There were unsuccessful plans by the WAFL to relocate the Demons to the Perth Hills to capture expanding outer suburbs as West Perth did by moving to Joondalup, but in spite of the trouble many players had travelling to Lathlain, the Perth board voted by 115 to 83 to remain there on 11 July 1995. Continuing financial losses reached a peak in 1997.

Despite an inglorious start with its lowest score since 1952 against Swan Districts, 1997 saw the Demons play consistently enough to record their best home-and-away performance for nineteen years, missing out on the double chance by only five percent from East Fremantle. The manner in which the Demons reversed a last round loss to East Perth by eleven goals in the first semi final might have made people think at the very least a grand final berth was forthcoming, but South Fremantle put paid to that with a six-goal win in the preliminary final.

Suffering from internal dissent as presidents Barry McGrath and Nick Catalano were opposed by the board over not only relocation, which most other members opposed in favour of a better deal from the West Australian Football Commission, but also the admission of , Perth immediately returned to the basement. In 1998 with the loss of key players Brett Spinks, Winston Abraham, Shane Cable, Matthew McMurray, Dean Bertram and Darren Rigby, the Demons won a mere four games and in 2000 were very lucky not to have their first winless season, beating Swan Districts in the final round. Despite the recruitment of a proven coach in Stan Magro, Perth were not able to sustain improvements to a 50/50 win–loss ratio in 2002 and 2004.

In 2005 the Demons won only three games, and then recruitment of another high-profile coach in former North Adelaide, Norwood and Adelaide Crows champion Andrew Jarman collapsed completely after a promising 2009 season: the Demons won only two games in 2010 for their fourteenth wooden spoon. The cycle was repeated even more dramatically in 2014: the Demons had looked like a first league finals berth since 1997 before fading and had had both lower grades make the top four in 2013, but in 2014 after winning their opening two matches an injury crisis and off-field dissent wrecked Perth to such an extent that it won only one more match for its fifteenth wooden spoon and ninth since 1981. The club under coach Earl Spalding led the Demons to being more competitive after his appointment in 2015, the club&#x27;s 120 year in 2019 saw them narrowly missed the finals by percentage despite winning their first five games but had to win the last game against Peel Thunder but lost by three points to miss out, the next season Perth made their first finals series in 23 years in Spalding&#x27;s final season as coach in a shortened season due to COVID winning their final regular season game by 5 points versus the eventual premier South Fremantle before losing to West Perth in a semi final by 11 points.

==Club song==

The club song of the Perth Football Club is sung to the tune of the Anthem of the United States Marine Corps, the same tune is used by the Adelaide Crows and the Werribee Tigers.

: From the playing fields of rival clubs
: To our home in Lathlain Park,
: On the West Australian Football fields
: We have carved a magic mark.
: We are called the mighty Demons
: And we&#x27;re feared by one and all,
: And the more they try to conquer us,
: The harder still they fall.

: We are rough and ruthless Demons,
: We&#x27;re the toughest in the West,
: And through thick and thin the Demons
: Will always stand the test.
: We are called the mighty Demons,
: And we&#x27;re feared by one and all,
: And the more they try to conquer us
: The harder still they fall.

<text>The 1901 VFL season was the fifth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 4 May to 7 September, comprising a 17-round home-and-away season followed by a two-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by 27 points in the 1901 VFL grand final; it was Essendon&#x27;s second VFL premiership. won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 14–3 win–loss record, but was eliminated by Collingwood in the semi-finals. Essendon&#x27;s Fred Hiskins won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1901, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 17 rounds of the home-and-away season had finished, the 1901 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the original &quot;Argus&quot; system.

==Season notes==
* Fitzroy lodged an official protest against the result of the second semi-final, which it lost against Essendon by one point, alleging that the goal umpire had erred in awarding Essendon&#x27;s first goal because the ball had hit the post. Later in the week, Fitzroy withdrew its protest against the result, and the scheduling of the grand final was not affected; an inquiry later in September found that the goal umpire had made a mistake, but no change was made to the score after the finding.
* Against South Melbourne in Round 6, Essendon kicked 17 behinds between its first and second goals. Only Geelong against St Kilda in 1919 and St Kilda against Fitzroy in 1921 have beaten this unwanted record. Fred Hiskins kicked ten behinds.
* In the Round 13 match between Collingwood and Fitzroy, neither team scored in the final quarter. As of 2024, this remains the only quarter in VFL/AFL history in which no score was registered at all.
* In the last home-and-away match between South Melbourne and Geelong, field umpire Henry &quot;Ivo&quot; Crapp experimented with clearly calling out his decisions. 
* In Essendon&#x27;s grand final victory against Collingwood, Albert Thurgood kicked three of Essendon&#x27;s six goals. One of his goals was scored with an 86-yard (79 m.) drop-kick, and another (measured immediately after the match) was scored with a 93-yard (85 m.) place-kick into a strong head wind.
* VFL instituted the original &quot;Argus&quot; system to determine the season&#x27;s premiers.

==Awards==
* The 1901 VFL Premiership team was Essendon.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Fred Hiskins of Essendon with 34 goals.
* St Kilda took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1901.

<text>The 1902 VFL season was the sixth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 3 May to 20 September, comprising a 17-round home-and-away season followed by a three-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by 33 points in the 1902 VFL grand final; it was Collingwood&#x27;s first VFL premiership. Collingwood also won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 15–2 win–loss record. &#x27;s Charlie Baker won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1902, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 17 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1902 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;Argus&quot; system.

==Win–loss table==
The following table can be sorted from biggest winning margin to biggest losing margin for each round. If two or more matches in a round are decided by the same margin, these margins are sorted by percentage (i.e. the lowest-scoring winning team is ranked highest and the lowest-scoring losing team is ranked lowest). Opponents are listed above the margins and home matches are in bold.

By having the best overall record for the season following the second week of finals, Collingwood won the right to challenge the preliminary final winner for the premiership.

==Season notes==
* The VFL instituted the amended &quot;Argus&quot; system to determine the season&#x27;s premiers.
* St Kilda finished last without a win, their sixth consecutive wooden spoon, and seven games behind second-last Geelong, both VFL/AFL records.
* In each of Rounds 8 and 10, while champion Albert Thurgood was serving a three-match suspension for striking, one of his team-mates took the field each week under the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; &quot;Goodthur&quot;; the name was used (in quote marks) in all news reports of the matches. Football historians Michael Maplestone and Stephen Rogers, through a process of elimination, determined that Goodthur was most likely Fred Mann, and official statistics reflect this. 
* Collingwood&#x27;s Charlie Pannam becomes the first VFL player to play 100 VFL games (at the end of the 1902 season, he had played in 104 of the 106 VFL games that Collingwood had played since the VFL&#x27;s first round of games in 1897).

==Awards==
* The 1902 VFL Premiership team was Collingwood.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker in the home-and-away season was Charlie Baker of St Kilda with 30 goals; St Kilda kicked only 64 goals for the year, of which Baker kicked 46.9%, and Baker&#x27;s proportion of his team&#x27;s goals is a VFL/AFL record. Including finals, Ted Rowell of Collingwood scored the most goals with 33.

<text>Port O&#x27;Connor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Calhoun County, Texas, United States, near the Gulf coastline between Galveston and Corpus Christi. The CDP had a population of 954 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Victoria, Texas metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Port O&#x27;Connor was laid out in the late 19th century as a fishing settlement called &quot;Alligator Head&quot;. As it grew in popularity with both permanent residents and tourists, the community took on more municipal characteristics, earning the formal designation finally in 1909 as the town site of Port O&#x27;Connor. It was named after its main landowner at the time, Thomas M. O&#x27;Connor, son of Thomas O&#x27;Connor, who owned . Aside from local cattle raising and fishing, the town was also a producer of figs and citrus fruit.

Its initial population growth spanned the years 1909 to 1919. Excursion trains ran on weekends to Port O&#x27;Connor, and an estimated 10,000 tourists came every summer.

Port O&#x27;Connor has been struck by four hurricanes since it was initially settled. The 1919 Florida Keys hurricane brought the &quot;good old days&quot; to a halt, destroying the town. It rebuilt slowly, but the 1942 and 1945 hurricanes so close in time were hard to overcome. In 1961, Port O&#x27;Connor was in the midst of another growth boom due to the increase of military personnel on nearby Matagorda Island Air Force Base. That same year, Hurricane Carla destroyed the town again, but times reflect its will to survive, fueled by tourism, commercial fisheries, and the petrochemical industry. Hurricane Harvey struck the town again in 2017.

==Demographics==
Port O&#x27;Connor first appeared as a census designated place in the 1980 U.S. Census. It was deleted prior to the 1990 U.S. Census; and relisted as a CDP in the 2010 U.S. Census. 

===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 954 people, 433 households, and 331 families residing in the CDP.

==Education==

Port O&#x27;Connor is served by the Calhoun County Independent School District.

Due to its small population, the town has only one school, Port O&#x27;Connor Elementary School, which has the dolphin as its mascot. Port O&#x27;Connor Elementary School covers prekindergarten through grade five. Children are then bused to the nearby town of Seadrift or to Port Lavaca to finish their sixth- through 12th-grade educations. The secondary schools that serve Port O&#x27;Connor are Seadrift Middle School, Travis Middle School, and Calhoun High School.

<text>The Swan Districts Football Club, nicknamed the Swans, is an Australian rules football club playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and WAFL Women&#x27;s (WAFLW). The club is based at Bassendean Oval, in Bassendean, an eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. The club was formed in 1933, and joined the then-Western Australian National Football League (WANFL) in 1934, acting as a successor to Midland Junction Football Club, which had disbanded during World War I, in the Perth Hills region.

==History==

Swan Districts finished seventh on the WANFL ladder winning seven out of 21 games in their debut season in 1934. The presence of established WANFL players like inaugural captain-coach &quot;Judda&quot; Bee from East Fremantle and Fred Sweetapple from West Perth was critical to the fledgling club&#x27;s competitiveness. In 1935, Swans finished sixth on the WANFL Ladder with six wins and twelve losses and George Krepp won the Sandover Medal. The 1936 season saw the Swans pick up nine wins and eleven losses but still finish seventh on the League Ladder.

The 1937 season saw Swan Districts, under new coach Jim Ditchburn, finish in third place on the League Ladder with 14 wins and 7 losses, and play in their first finals series. Ted Holdsworth kicked 109 goals in the first 14 games before injury ended his season and East Perth beat them in the first semi-final 13.9 (87) to 11.7 (73). Swan Districts had another good season in 1938, finishing third with 11 wins and nine losses but were again beaten in the first semi-final by East Perth 8.18 (66) – 9.11 (65).

In 1939, with the loss of champion spearhead Holdsworth to Kalgoorlie, Swans slid to sixth on the ladder with seven wins from twenty games. In the following two seasons, despite Holdsworth&#x27;s return, the club slid still further to finish last with only two wins in 1940 and three in 1941. Due to the Second World War the WANFL suspended its senior competition and implemented an under age competition to replace it. In 1942 Swans were unable to raise a side to play and did not compete at all. By 1943 Swan Districts assembled a side to compete in the under-age competition and performed exceedingly well, finishing fourth on the ladder with nine wins and eight losses, then winning the first semi-final against West Perth and the preliminary Final against Subiaco. Swans thus played in their first Grand Final only to be defeated by East Fremantle, the final score being East Fremantle 17.15 (117) to Swan Districts 11.11 (77). Jim Davies became the second Swan Districts player to win a Sandover Medal in 1944 with 33 votes in what was otherwise a forgettable season with Swans finishing sixth on the ladder, but in the restored open-age competition of 1945 their fortunes improved as they finished fourth on the league ladder only to be defeated in the first semi-final by South Fremantle.
However, Swan Districts fell off dramatically for the next fifteen seasons. During this period they never finished higher than sixth of eight teams, and overall won only sixty-one and drew one of their 301 matches, suffering from the fact that much of the area around Bassendean was &quot;un-allotted&quot; so that players such as Keith and Roy Harper, and Frank Coulson moved to more successful clubs. They were nonetheless instrumental in having the WANFL introduce its &quot;Provident Fund&quot; to allow league revenue to be shared amongst the clubs. In 1957 Swan Districts won their first Colts Premiership, repeating the dose in 1958, and these teams provided the nucleus of their successes in the early to middle 1960s.
After finishing last in 1960, Swan Districts appointed Haydn Bunton junior as senior captain-coach in early 1961, and improvement was immediate. Swan Districts won twelve and drew two of their twenty-one regular season matches to be a clear second and an ingenious tactic by Bunton against champion East Perth ruckman &quot;Polly&quot; Farmer won them a huge upset in the Grand Final, and two more premierships followed in 1962 and 1963. Swans&#x27; fall afterwards was however just as rapid as their rise from 1960 to 1961. In 1964 Swans won seven of their first nine matches, but then state representative calls and form lapses affected the team so badly that they won only two of their final twelve encounters. After achieving their most successful home-and-away season under new captain coach Fred Castledine before being overwhelmed by a mediocre East Fremantle team in the 1965 Grand Final, they fell off completely in the following eight seasons. Swans in this era were hindered by the lack of a full-time coach or secretary that made it harder for them to recruit than other WANFL clubs. In 1968, Swan Districts came nearer to a winless season than any team in senior WA(N)FL competition between 1918 and 1998: winning only one game after the siren by a point against East Fremantle, and scored their all-time lowest score against East Perth. Swan Districts were also last in 1970 and 1971, and not until 1974 did they again make the finals, under the coaching of Jack Ensor, who most unusually never played senior League Football. Again, however, they declined abruptly, falling to wooden spooners in 1977 and 1978.

John Todd, who took the coaching reins at Bassendean in 1977 and began with a big clean-out of players, brought with him a new winning culture, one which would emulate that of the Haydn Bunton era. By the 1980s, Swans became the dominant side in the WAFL, winning three straight flags in 1982, 1983 and 1984. Swan Districts fell drastically to be last in 1986 and 1988, but rose equally rapidly and after a stint coaching the West Coast Eagles in 1988 and 1989, Todd returned to the club and after being fifth with ten wins in 1989 they won a seventh premiership, beating Claremont 16.7 (103) to 10.17 (77) in 1990. However, after several unsuccessful finals campaigns between 1991 and 1994 Todd returned to South Fremantle, where he began his football career, and Swan Districts fell rapidly downhill on and off the field under coaches Graham Melrose (1995 and 1996), Phil Cronan (1997 and 1998), Peter Wilson (1999) and Todd again from 2000 to 2002. Between 1995 and 2002 they did not play in the finals and overall won only 51 of 158 games.
At the end of 2002, a season where Swans ran last in all three grades and were as lucky as in 1968 to escape a winless season in the seniors, the club&#x27;s desperate financial trouble came to the public&#x27;s attention and a concerted financial drive saw them rise to ten wins and a draw under new coach Steve Turner, and back into the finals in 2004 and 2005. They could not challenge Subiaco or South Fremantle for the flag, and in 2006 fell to only seven wins before Turner gave way to former Eagles star Chris Lewis early in 2007. Brian Dawson took over as coach of the seniors in 2008 and the club rebounded from disappointing results in the previous two years to play in the 2008 Grand Final which they lost to Subiaco. Dawson then steered the team to a preliminary final in 2009. Dawson announced his retirement at the end of the 2010 season. then took the team to the Grand Final which they won over Claremont by a single point. Andrew Krakouer won the Simpson Medal on top of winning the Sandover Medal for 2010, he accumulated 42 possessions during the grand final and kicked the last goal of the game ensuring Swan won the flag. Josh Roberts will be remembered as the premiership skipper in his first year as captain.

Greg Harding was appointed as senior coach for the 2011 season. The club had a poor season finishing the season with only six wins from twenty games and finishing second from bottom of the league ladder, but rebounded in 2012 to finish second to a powerful Claremont combination only to lose both finals.

In 2013 Swans finished 3rd on the ladder with Tim Geappen kicking 49 goals for the season and Tony Notte being awarded the fairest and best.

Swan Districts were a foundation member of the WAFL Women&#x27;s competition in 2019.

==Club song==
The Swan Districts club song is to the tune of the 1926 song Baby Face written by Harry Akst and Benny Davis.
The club song lyrics were written by John Watts and performed to the 1975 version of Baby Face.

==Hall of Fame==
The Swan Districts Football Club Hall of Fame was established in 2016 to &quot;recognise and enshrine players, coaches, administrators, volunteers and iconic moments that have made a most significant contribution to the Swan Districts Football Club ... since its inception in 1934.&quot;
In the initial terms of reference document, there were to be four main categories for entries into the Hall of Fame: 
# Hall of Fame inductees (open to all players, coaches, administrators and volunteers); 
# Champion inductees (open to those SDFC players who have been recruited from SDFC into the AFL); 
# Legends – open to all Hall of Fame members; and 
# Iconic Moments, which were defined as &quot;events which have been game changers for the Club. These could include football games, football events, infrastructure changes and innovations&quot;.

However, subsequent coverage of the club&#x27;s Hall of Fame barely references these categories, and the reference to the Legends category was modified to &quot;Immortals&quot;. The inaugural in take of the Swan Districts Hall of Fame included 26 individuals and one iconic moment. There were further induction ceremonies held in 2019 and 2021.

<doc id="1160837" wikidata="Q3488489" url="?curid=1160837" title="The Enterprise Incident">
<text>&quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot; is the second episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by D. C. Fontana and directed by John Meredyth Lucas, it was first broadcast September 27, 1968.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; are on a secret mission to steal a Romulan cloaking device.

==Plot==
Captain Kirk orders the Federation starship USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; into Romulan space without any authorization from Starfleet of which the bridge crew are aware. Romulan vessels intercept the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and Kirk negotiates an hour&#x27;s time to consider surrendering his ship. Kirk, along with the Vulcan First Officer Spock, are then invited aboard the Romulan flagship.

Once aboard the Romulan ship, Kirk and Spock are taken before a commander who demands an explanation for their intrusion into Romulan space. Kirk claims that instrument failure caused the ship to stray off course, but Spock divulges that the captain ordered entry into Romulan space and asserts that he is insane. Romulan guards lead Kirk to their brig.

Alone with Spock in her quarters, the commander questions Spock about his career. She argues that humans may have shown their disregard for his talents and capabilities by not giving him command of a ship, but the Romulans, if he were willing, would not make that mistake.

In the Romulan brig, Kirk injures himself by lunging against the force field door. Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy is summoned from the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to attend to him. The commander asks McCoy to confirm Spock&#x27;s characterization of the captain as mentally incompetent and McCoy does so, whereupon the commander calls on Spock to assume command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Kirk, calling Spock a traitor, attacks him, and Spock defends himself using what he calls the &quot;Vulcan death grip&quot;. Kirk slumps to the floor, and McCoy declares him dead.

Back on the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Kirk awakens from the state of suspension brought on by the so-called death grip. His apparent insanity, the unauthorized venture into Romulan space, and Spock&#x27;s betrayal have all been part of a secret Federation plan to steal a Romulan cloaking device. Kirk orders McCoy to perform surgery to give him Romulan features and then transports back to the Romulan vessel disguised as one of their officers.

Meanwhile, Spock and the commander dine in her quarters, and their conversation grows intimate. When the commander goes to change her attire, Spock directs Kirk, via communicator, to the location of the cloaking device. His signal is discovered and tracked, and Spock surrenders himself to the Romulan officers, but they are too late to prevent Kirk from stealing the cloaking device and returning with it to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

Chief Engineer Scott attempts to adapt the Romulan cloaking device to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; while Ensign Chekov succeeds in distinguishing Spock&#x27;s life signs from those of the Romulans. Both Spock and the Romulan commander are beamed to the &quot;Enterprise&quot; where Kirk gives the order to return to Federation space. The pursuing Romulans are ready to fire upon them as Scott successfully activates the cloak and the &quot;Enterprise&quot; vanishes before their eyes. The now-captured Romulan commander points out to Spock that any advantage the Federation gains from studying the new cloaking device model will be temporary, as before long the Romulans will learn to circumvent it. Spock notes that military secrets are the most fleeting of all.

==Production==

===Writing===
D. C. Fontana based this story very loosely upon the &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident, in which a United States Navy ship and its crew were seized, and the crew held on charges of espionage for almost a year, after the ship allegedly strayed into North Korean waters.

The first draft of the script had Spock &quot;raining kisses on every square inch above the shoulder&quot; of the Romulan commander but this was changed, at Leonard Nimoy&#x27;s insistence, to the more demure finger caresses. Fontana has pointed out that the &quot;raining kisses&quot; scene was actually an embellishment by Gene Roddenberry—one of the few he applied to third season scripts—and that the original script submitted had only an embrace and kiss, with most of the passion being delivered by the Romulan commander.

Originally, both Kirk and McCoy were disguised as Romulans and went aboard the Romulan ship to steal the cloaking device. This was dropped not only due to cost concerns, but because Robert H. Justman pointed out that having McCoy doing plastic surgery on his own ears would have stretched believability, and including a character to perform the surgery on both Kirk and McCoy would have required casting an additional role, further increasing the cost.

===Models===

In the remastered edition two of the three Romulan warships are actually Klingon D7 battlecruisers, with the third being the Romulan Bird-of-Prey seen in the episode &quot;Balance of Terror&quot;. Although in production order the model was first used (as a Klingon ship) in &quot;Elaan of Troyius&quot;, in broadcast order it is first seen in this episode. Spock says at the start of the episode that &quot;intelligence reports Romulans now using Klingon design.&quot; In the original broadcast episode all three ships were the D7 design.

==Non-canonical media==
* The name of the Romulan commander and her fate are not revealed in the episode. At least two different explanations are given in &quot;Trek&quot; novels—&quot;The Price of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Heart&quot;. (In the early days of &quot;Trek&quot; writing, many novels contradicted each other, so the commander has had a number of names and fates.) The latest explanation is given in the novel &quot;Vulcan&#x27;s Heart&quot;, by Josepha Sherman and Susan Shwartz, which gives her name as Liviana Charvanek. Apparently, sometime after the events of this episode, Charvanek was returned to Romulus and resumed her military career.
* D. C. Fontana co-wrote a sequel: &quot;Star Trek: Year Four—The Enterprise Experiment&quot;, a graphic novel published by IDW Publishing in 2008.
* This episode is referenced in the video game &quot;Star Trek: Tactical Assault&quot;. During a Federation mission the player&#x27;s ship is equipped with the Romulan cloaking device stolen by Kirk and ordered to launch a sneak attack on a Klingon starbase.
* The Romulan commander and Subcommander Tal are central characters in the two-part series conclusion to &quot;Star Trek Continues&quot;. The part of the Romulan commander was played by Amy Rydell, daughter of Joanne Linville, who played the role in the original episode.
* The Romulan commander appears in the independently produced science fiction audio drama &quot;Starship Excelsior&quot; season 4 episode &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Excelsior&quot;, In the episode it is revealed that the commander has received a promotion to Legate. The character was voiced by Joanne Linville who played the role in the original &quot;TOS&quot; episode.

==Reception==
In 2014, Gizmodo ranked &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot; as the 48th best episode of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, out of the over 700 made by that time (including the spin-off series).

In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; rated &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot; the 33rd best television episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, including live-action and the animated series but not counting the movies. They note that this episode is the favorite of the director of the 2016 film &quot;Star Trek: Beyond&quot;, Justin Lin.

In 2016, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked &quot;The &quot;Enterprise&quot; Incident&quot; as one of the best episodes of the original series. They note Spock&#x27;s interaction with the Romulan commander, and the Federation&#x27;s desire for a science fiction technology, &quot;Star Trek&quot;″s &quot;cloaking device&quot;.

In 2017, Comic Book Resources ranked Spock and the Romulan commander the 11th best romantic relationship of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise up to that time. In 2017, CBR ranked the Romulan commander the 7th &quot;fiercest&quot; female character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2020, SyFy recommended watching this episode for background on Romulans for &quot;Star Trek: Picard&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;ScreenRant&quot; ranked it as the 4th best episode of &quot;TOS&quot; to re-watch. They note the similarity in the plot between this episode and season one of &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;, although instead of the Romulans, the Klingons are shown.

== Releases ==
This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993 as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;. A trailer for this and the other episodes was also included, and the episode had English and Japanese audio tracks. The cover script was スター・トレック TVサードシーズン 

The episode was released on VHS in the United Kingdom, paired with &quot;And the Children Shall Lead&quot;.

This episode was included in the &quot;TOS&quot; Season 3 remastered DVD box set, with the remastered version of this episode.

<text>The Nakajima C6N Saiun (彩雲, &quot;Iridescent Cloud&quot;) is a carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service in World War II. Advanced for its time, it was the fastest carrier-based aircraft put into service by Japan during the war. The Allied reporting name was Myrt.

==Development and design==
The C6N originated from a 1942 Imperial Japanese Navy specification for a carrier-based reconnaissance plane with a top speed of 350 knots (650 km/h) at 6,000 m and range of 2,500 nautical miles (4,960 km). Nakajima&#x27;s initial proposal, designated N-50, was for a craft with two engines housed in tandem in the fuselage, driving two propellers mounted on the wings. With the development of the class Nakajima Homare engine, the dual powerplant configuration was abandoned and Nakajima decided on a more conventional single-engine layout. Unfortunately the new Homare&#x27;s power output was less than expected, and the design had to be optimized in other areas. The resulting aircraft was designed around a long and extremely narrow cylindrical fuselage just large enough in diameter to accommodate the engine. The crew of three sat in tandem under a single canopy, while equipment was similarly arranged in a line along the fuselage. The C6N&#x27;s low-mounted laminar flow wing housed fuel tanks and was fitted with both Fowler and slit flaps and leading-edge slats which lowered the aircraft&#x27;s landing speed to ease use aboard aircraft carriers. Like Nakajima&#x27;s earlier B6N &quot;Tenzan&quot; torpedo bomber, the vertical stabilizer was angled slightly forward to enable tighter packing on aircraft carrier decks.

The C6N&#x27;s first flight was on 15 May 1943, with the prototype demonstrating a speed of . Performance of the Homare engine was disappointing, especially its power at altitude, and a series of 18 further prototypes and pre-production aircraft were built before the &quot;Saiun&quot; was finally ordered into production in February 1944.

==Operational history==
Although designed for carrier use, by the time it entered service in September 1944, there were few Japanese carriers left for it to operate from, so most C6Ns were flown from land bases. Its speed was exemplified by a telegraph sent after a successful mission: &quot;No Grummans can catch us.&quot; (&quot;我に追いつくグラマンなし&quot;). The top speed of the Hellcat was indeed of the same level, so overtaking a &quot;Saiun&quot; was out of the question.

A total of 463 aircraft were produced. A single prototype of a turbocharged development, mounting a 4-blade propeller, was built; this was called the C6N2 &quot;Saiun-kai&quot;. Several examples of a night fighter version C6N1-S with oblique-firing (&quot;Schräge Musik&quot; configuration) single 30 mm (or dual 20 mm) cannon were converted from existing C6N1s. As Allied bombers came within reach of the Japanese home islands, a first class night fighter was required. This led Nakajima to develop the C6N1-S by removing the observer and replacing him with two 20 mm cannons. The C6N1-S&#x27;s effectiveness was hampered by the lack of air-to-air radar, although it was fast enough to enjoy almost complete immunity from interception by Allied fighters. A torpedo carrying C6N1-B was also proposed but was not needed after most of Japan&#x27;s aircraft carriers were destroyed.

Despite its speed and performance, on 15 August 1945, a C6N1 happened to be the last aircraft to be shot down in World War II. Just five minutes later, the war was over, and all Japanese aircraft were grounded.

==Variants==
&quot;Source:&quot;Famous Airplanes of the World
;C6N1 &quot;Experimental Type 17 carrier reconnaissance plane&quot; (17試艦上偵察機, &quot;17-Shi Kanjō Teisatsuki&quot;)
:Three prototypes and sixteen supplementary prototypes produced, four-blade propeller; latter batch were equipped three-blade propeller, mounted Nakajima NK9K-L Homare 22 engine, No. 6 was mounted Nakajima NK9H Homare 21 engine. Renamed &quot;Test production Saiun&quot; (試製彩雲, &quot;Shisei Saiun&quot;) in July 1943.
;C6N1 &quot;Saiun Model 11&quot; (彩雲11型, &quot;Saiun 11-gata&quot;)
:General production model. Three-blade propeller, mounted Nakajima NK9H Homare 21 engine.
:;C6N1-B &quot;Saiun Model 21&quot; (彩雲21型, &quot;Saiun 21-gata&quot;)
::Proposed torpedo bomber version. Only a project.
:;C6N1 &quot;Saiun Model 11 night fighter variant&quot; (彩雲11型改造夜戦, &quot;Saiun 11-gata Kaizō yasen&quot;)
::Temporary rebuilt two-seat night fighter version; this was not a regulation naval aircraft. Development code &quot;C6N1-S&quot; was not discovered in the IJN official documents. One model with a single 30 mm Type 2 cannon was built in June 1945, and at least five models with ×2 20 mm Type 99-1 cannon were converted from standard C6N1 models. One surviving example of the ×2 20mm cannon variant is stored in the &quot;Paul E. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility&quot;. The 30 mm version was only used to attack B-29s once, on August 1, 1945. The destructive power of the Type 2 cannon extended to twisting the skin of the &quot;Saiun&quot;&#x27;s lightweight fuselage.
;C6N2 &quot;Test production Saiun Kai/Saiun Model 12&quot; (試製彩雲改/彩雲12型, &quot;Shisei Saiun Kai/Saiun 12-gata&quot;)
:Fitted with four-blade propeller, Nakajima NK9L-L Homare 24-Ru turbocharged engine. The Hitachi 92 turbocharger was fitted with the aim of improving high altitude performance; target speed was at . One prototype (コ–C6T1) was converted from a regular C6N1 in February 1945 and first flew in July of that year. The installation of an oil cooler and an intercooler necessitated a sizable cowling to be installed beneath the engine.
;C6N3 &quot;Test production Saiun Kai 1&quot; (試製彩雲改1, &quot;Shisei Saiun Kai 1&quot;)
:Proposed high-altitude night fighter version of the C6N2. Dual 20 mm cannons were installed. Only a project.
;C6N4 &quot;Test production Saiun Kai 2&quot; (試製彩雲改2, &quot;Shisei Saiun Kai 2&quot;)
:Fitted 2,200-hp Mitsubishi MK9A Ha 43-11 Ru turbocharged engine, one prototype was converted from C6N1, incomplete.
;C6N5 &quot;Test production Saiun Kai 3&quot; (試製彩雲改3, &quot;Shisei Saiun Kai 3&quot;)
:Proposed torpedo bomber version. Only a project.
;C6N6 &quot;Test production Saiun Kai 4&quot; (試製彩雲改4, &quot;Shisei Saiun Kai 4&quot;)
:Wooden aircraft model. Only a project.

<text>Ramiro L. Colón (1904–1983), was the general manager of the Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico. He reorganized the company during its time of crisis and is credited with having saved the coffee industry in Puerto Rico.

==Early years==
Colón (birth name: Ramiro L. Colón Colón), was born in and raised in the countryside of Ponce, Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. Being raised in the country, he developed an intense love for the island&#x27;s agriculture. He went to work for the &quot;Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico&quot; (Cooperative of Coffee Growers of Puerto Rico) in 1925, the same year it was founded, at the age of 21.

==&quot;Cooperativa de Cafeteros de Puerto Rico&quot;==
The cooperative was the first one of its kind in Puerto Rico. It was founded to protect the coffee industry, which was one of the island&#x27;s most important export products, from outside imitators. The situation was the following: many merchants were importing coffee from other countries, of poor quality and freshness, and passing them off as locally produced. When tourists and local consumers tasted the coffee, they complained about how bad it was, and as a result sales declined drastically and the coffee industry suffered greatly. In 1928, hurricane San Felipe destroyed most of the coffee plantations on the island, and the Great Depression also affected the economy.

==Colón becomes general manager==
In 1932, Colón was named general manager of the cooperative and undertook the reorganization of the company during its time of crisis. The cooperative was almost bankrupt, and the first thing Colón did was to obtain a loan from the Department of Agriculture and Commerce. With the money, he bought new equipment to replace the old and outdated equipment in the company. Colón was able to convince the Puerto Rican legislature to pass a law against the then-rampant adulteration and contraband of coffee.

==&quot;Cafe Rico&quot;==
Colón was credited with convincing the government to impose import tariffs on coffee, thereby ensuring the island would not be invaded by cheap coffee of poor quality, which often was advertised as locally produced. The cooperative purchased and installed a new torrefaction plant in which the local coffee was processed. Colon set out to gain access to the United States coffee market, helped the local coffee growers obtain lines of credit from local bankers, and got financial help from the federal and local government for the export of the cooperative&#x27;s coffee. This coffee was named &quot;Cafe Rico&quot; and was well received locally and internationally, soon reestablishing the good fame of Puerto Rico&#x27;s coffee worldwide. The cooperative became the first coffee manufacturer to sell its coffee in sealed cans. The quality of Cafe Rico has received numerous medals and recognition in contests celebrated all over the world.

==Cooperative expansion==
Under Colon&#x27;s leadership, the cooperative was able to expand and diversify. The company sells food and agricultural equipment with sales of over $5 million. It also owns and operates an egg processing company which calls its product &quot;Huevos Rico&quot; (Rico Eggs). The cooperative owns an insurance company, its own credit corporation that grants loans to farmers, and its own printing plant that prints and distributes an agricultural magazine worldwide. Recently, the cooperative has started to operate gasoline stations in San Juan, Mayaguez and Ponce.

When Colón took over the company in 1932 as a general manager the cooperative had only $284,000 in annual sales. By 1963 the cooperative had over $35,000,000 in sales. The cooperative has offices and warehouses in Ponce (main offices), San Juan, Mayagüez, Arecibo, Yauco, San Sebastian, Utuado, Adjuntas, Jayuya and Ciales.

==Legacy==
Colón served as a senator, representing the district of Ponce in the Puerto Rican Senate and was named Administrator of the cooperative, a position he held until his retirement in 1965. In 1952 the Constitution of Puerto Rico was adopted, creating the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and Colón was a member of the Constitutional Convention of Puerto Rico. He was a delegate to Republican National Convention from Puerto Rico in the years 1948, 1952 and 1956. Ramiro L. Colón was candidate for governor in 1968 for the Republican Statehood Party.

Ramiro L. Colón died in the city of Ponce, he was buried at Cementerio La Piedad in Ponce. His memory was honored by naming an elementary school after him. He is remembered as the man who saved the Puerto Rican coffee industry.

<doc id="1160840" wikidata="Q3437867" url="?curid=1160840" title="Rock music in New Zealand">
<text>Rock music in New Zealand, also known as Kiwi rock music and New Zealand rock music, rose to prominence first in 1955 with Johnny Cooper&#x27;s cover version of Bill Haley&#x27;s hit song &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. This was followed by Johnny Devlin, sometimes nicknamed New Zealand&#x27;s Elvis Presley, and his cover of &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;. The 1960s saw Max Merritt and the Meteors and Ray Columbus &amp; the Invaders achieve success. In the 1970s and early 1980s the innovative Split Enz had success internationally as well as nationally, with member Neil Finn later continuing with Crowded House. Other influential bands in the 1970s were Th&#x27; Dudes, Dragon and Hello Sailor. The early 1980s saw the development of the indie rock &quot;Dunedin sound&quot;, typified by Dunedin bands such as The Clean, Straitjacket Fits, and The Chills, recorded by the Flying Nun record label of Christchurch. Other leading New Zealand artists include the hard rock band Shihad and the Māori metal band Alien Weaponry.

==1950s==
Rock music began in New Zealand in 1955 when Wellington-based country singer Johnny Cooper (popularly known as the &quot;Maori cowboy&quot;) recorded a cover version of American Bill Haley’s hit song &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; for HMV, the first rock and roll record recorded outside the United States. In 1956, Cooper wrote and recorded an original song called &quot;Pie Cart Rock and Roll&quot;. The song referred to a pie cart that he visited while managing talent shows in Whanganui. The song is believed to be New Zealand&#x27;s first indigenous rock and roll recording, although &quot;Resuscitation rock&quot;, written by Wellington teenager Sandy Tansley in March 1957, may have been released a few weeks earlier than Cooper&#x27;s song. Singer Johnny Devlin was touted as New Zealand&#x27;s Elvis Presley and his cover of &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot; remains one of New Zealand&#x27;s biggest-selling singles, having sold 100,000 copies in 1959–60. In 1959, Mabel Howard, Minister of Social Welfare, went to see Johnny Devlin perform at the Christchurch Town Hall, declaring at half-time, &quot;There’s nothing much wrong with rock and roll&quot;. New Zealand&#x27;s studios lagged behind their counterparts in the Northern Hemisphere and 1950s recording stars The Tumbleweeds recorded six of their hit albums in the living room of one of their band members.

==1960s==
New Zealand radio&#x27;s conservative programming approach was increasingly challenged by young people in the 1960s. Radio Hauraki initially began life as a pirate radio station, broadcasting in international waters offshore from Auckland in the Hauraki Gulf, a deliberate move that allowed them to circumnavigate restrictive broadcasting legislation and broadcast their own playlist. This in part spearheaded the way for the gradual deregulation of the radio industry. Towards the end of the 1960s radio stations like Radio Hauraki, and later Radio I, were playing exclusively rock and pop music to a teenage and young adult audience.

The 1960s also witnessed a dramatic rise in locally written and recorded popular music. However, many pop bands and performers of the time also released their own versions or &quot;covers&quot; of hits by overseas artists. It was an era when vinyl reigned supreme and teenagers queued outside local music and record shops to buy the latest hit singles. The Fourmyula&#x27;s &quot;Nature&quot;, written by Wayne Mason in 1969, still retains considerable popularity and was voted the top New Zealand song of the last 75 years in 2001.

In Christchurch, Max Merritt and the Meteors played regularly at The Teenage Club, and achieved iconic status in New Zealand with their songs &quot;Get a Haircut&quot; and &quot;C’mon Let’s Go&quot;. Ray Columbus &amp; the Invaders were influenced by the early 1960s work of Cliff Richard and the Beatles. Columbus styled his band on the mod look and they were noted for their Fender equipment and vivid blue suits. After the Beatles toured New Zealand in 1964 Ray Columbus &amp; the Invaders had a number one hit in Australia and New Zealand in 1964 with their cover version of &quot;She&#x27;s a Mod&quot;, a song by The Senators.

==1970s==
In contrast to the 1960s, relatively few New Zealand groups released records. In 1976, six million records were sold, with only seven singles and four albums from local performers reaching the Top 50. The following year eight singles and three albums charted, but overall record sales dropped to five and a half million.
Some of the more influential rock bands in the 1970s were Th&#x27; Dudes (whose guitarist Dave Dobbyn formed DD Smash in the 1980s), Dragon, Hello Sailor and Split Enz, fronted by Tim Finn, and later, his brother Neil Finn who went on to form Crowded House.

The first punk rock bands – including the Suburban Reptiles and the Scavengers – formed in Auckland in the late 1970s and were soon followed by groups in Christchurch, Wellington and Dunedin. With guitarist Alec Bathgate, Knox formed the Tall Dwarfs and, with a rudimentary four-track TEAC tape deck, he began recording various post-punk bands that had cropped up in Dunedin, starting with the Clean.

The Redwood 70 music festival, held six months after Woodstock in 1970, was cautiously sub-titled New Zealand&#x27;s first national music convention. Held at Redwood Park in Swanson in Auckland&#x27;s far west, the festival was organised by Auckland promoter Phil Warren. Redwood 70&#x27;s headline act was a newly solo Robin Gibb, backed by a string quartet. The New Zealand groups who made up the bulk of the two-day festival&#x27;s entertainment were less mainstream than Gibb and played rock music. Though over 9000 fans attended, the festival lost money, a pattern that has continued in New Zealand in regard to multi-day outdoor festivals in this country. There were smaller festivals in 1971 – the Englefield Rock Festival at Belfast near Christchurch, another at Waikanae over Easter weekend, and the University Arts Council&#x27;s Jam Factory in July.

The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival of early January 1973, was organised by music promoters Paul Raymond and Barry Coburn. They followed the Woodstock template closely, including plans for a live album and film, which is how the New York state festival turned a profit. They chose a rural site with good access to large population centres, arranged trains from Auckland and Wellington, and selected international headline rock acts including Black Sabbath and Sandy Denny. They drew heavily on the still vibrant counter-culture for New Zealand performers like Blerta, Mammal and Billy TK and Powerhouse. Only 18,000 fans paid the $8 to attend; 25,000 were needed to make a profit. Problems with inadequate space and toilets added further costs. Neither a film nor live album eventuated (although some live recordings were made). Even so, music historian John Dix considered the event a success: it was a key event in New Zealand rock history, which introduced the acts that would dominate the local music scene in the mid-1970s.

The 1979 Nambassa Festival, held on a 400-acre farm on Landlyst Rd in Golden Valley, just north of Waihi, drew over 65,000 fans and was a key event for New Zealand&#x27;s hippie generation. Nambassa was named after the Big Nambas tribal group from northwest Malekula, Vanuatu. Organiser Peter Terry was inspired by the groups&#x27;s traditional lifestyle, self-sufficiency, and lack of exposure to western commercialism. The headline act was Little River Band. Media reaction to Nambassa was mostly positive. The &quot;Auckland Star&quot; ran extensive coverage and the &quot;Dominion&quot; devoted its front page to the event. Peter Terry used the Woodstock model to successfully spin off a feature film and a book from the event, for which a profit of $200,000 was eventually declared.

==1980s==
The 1980s saw the emergence the independent labels like Propeller Records in Auckland and Flying Nun record label in Christchurch who were highly influential in the development of modern indie rock. Early 1980s Dunedin groups like The Clean, Straitjacket Fits, and The Chills, recorded by Flying Nun, typified what became known as the ‘Dunedin sound’ – droning vocals, jangly guitars, simple drumbeats and keyboards, and saw some success internationally particularly on American and European college radio. The Chills were an inspiration for Californian bands like Jay Reatard, Ty Segall, and Wavves.

Split Enz, Th’ Dudes, Dragon, and Hello Sailor continued to gain chart success in New Zealand and other parts of the world. Ex-members of Split Enz then went on to form Crowded House, one of New Zealand&#x27;s most successful bands. Phil Judd, another ex-Split Enz member, formed The Swingers who released &quot;Counting the Beat&quot; in 1981.

By the late nineteen-eighties, the New Zealand punk generation was ageing, anti-socialist reaction had curbed the generosity of the dole, which in turn reduced the free time New Zealand musicians had directed towards writing and performing.

==1990s==
Formed in 1988, hard rock band Shihad released several albums in the 1990s with great success in New Zealand. Also successful locally in the 1990s were bands The Feelers, Zed, Head Like A Hole and Evermore. Auckland singer/songwriter Darcy Clay was critically lauded in 1997 for his Number 5 hit &quot;Jesus I Was Evil&quot;.

==2000s==
In the 2000s, New Zealand indie bands continued to be successful, with bands like The Naked and Famous, Die! Die! Die! and The Mint Chicks releasing successful recordings. The members of The Mint Chicks went on to form Unknown Mortal Orchestra and Opossum. Indie band The Phoenix Foundation and artist Liam Finn, the son of Neil Finn, found success in New Zealand. 

The rock band Elemeno P also had success between 2002 and 2008 with three well-received albums. Elemeno P has been referred to as New Zealand&#x27;s biggest selling rock band.

Singer-songwriter Gin Wigmore (folk/blues rock) won the US-based International Songwriting Competition in 2004, launching a successful national and international career. Each of her albums have reached number 1 in New Zealand, and her songs have regularly been synched for advertising.

City of Souls was formed in August 2015 by guitarists Trajan Schwencke and Steve Boag, soon joined by vocalist Richie Simpson. City of Souls went on to win the Aotearoa Music awards for best rock album &quot;Synaesthesia&quot; in 2020.

Formed in 2010, Alien Weaponry rose to be New Zealand&#x27;s most successful rock act following the release of their debut album &quot;Tū&quot; in 2018. This led to European and American tours with shows at some of the world&#x27;s biggest heavy metal festivals.

<text>Samuel Oppenheimer (21 June 1630 – 3 May 1703) was an Ashkenazi Jewish banker, imperial court diplomat, factor, and military supplier for the Holy Roman Emperor. He enjoyed the special favor of Emperor Leopold I, to whom he advanced considerable sums of money for the Great Turkish War. Prince Eugene of Savoy brought him a large number of valuable Hebrew manuscripts from Turkey, which became the nucleus of the famous David Oppenheim Library, now part of the Bodleian Library at Oxford.

Although the Jews had been recently expelled from Vienna in 1670, the emperor permitted Oppenheimer to settle there, together with his &quot;&quot;, his followers, who included a number of Jewish families. He even received the privilege of building a mansion in the heart of Vienna. He was appointed &quot;Oberfaktor&quot; and court Jew at the recommendation of Margrave Ludwig of Baden, the imperial general in Hungary, to whom he had advanced 100,000 gulden for war expenses. He also enabled Prince Eugene to provide medical attendance for the army during the Turkish war. About the year 1700, a riot broke out, possibly sanctioned by the royal court, to persuade Oppenheimer to relieve the court&#x27;s debt. During the riot, houses were sacked and property looted, including Oppenheimer&#x27;s. As a result, one man was hanged for sacking Oppenheimer&#x27;s house and others were imprisoned for participating in the disturbance. 

Oppenheimer took steps to suppress the anti-Semitic &quot;Entdecktes Judenthum&quot; (&quot;Judaism Unmasked&quot;) treatise by spending large sums of money to win the court and the Jesuits to the side of the Jews. As a result, an imperial edict was issued forbidding circulation of the author, Eisenmenger&#x27;s, work. Oppenheimer was employed also by the emperor in political missions which were often of a delicate nature.

When Oppenheimer died, the state refused to honor its debts to his heir Emanuel and had his firm declared bankrupt. His death brought deep financial crisis to the state; it experienced great difficulty in securing the credit necessary to meet its needs. Emanuel appealed to European rulers to whom the state owed money and who intervened on his behalf. After deliberate procrastination, the state refused Emanuel&#x27;s demand for 6 million florins and instead demanded 4 million florins from him. This amount was based on a sum which (with compound interest), according to the state, Oppenheimer had allegedly obtained by fraud at the beginning of his career. Emanuel died in 1721 and the Oppenheimer estate was auctioned in 1763. Although Oppenheimer was not himself learned, he was a benefactor on a scale hitherto unknown, building many synagogues and yeshivot and supporting their scholars. He also paid ransom for the return of Jews captured during the Turkish wars and supported as well R. Judah he-Hasid&#x27;s voyage to Erez Israel in 1700. Known as Judenkaiser by his contemporaries, he was a man whose complex personality, a mixture of pride and reserve, defied historical analysis. Twenty years after his death it was estimated that more than 100 persons held residence in Vienna by virtue of their being included in Oppenheimer&#x27;s privileges.

Oppenheimer was buried in the Rossauer Cemetery, the oldest Jewish cemetery in Vienna (Seegasse 9). Stones in the cemetery were buried during WWII for protection. Many were recovered and the cemetery was restored in the 1980s. One half of Samuel Oppenheimer&#x27;s tombstone as well as the lower part of the second half were recovered during excavations in the cemetery in 2008 and was restored to its original location, as were the tombstones of several of his descendants. A photograph taken before the war reveals the elaborate inscriptions on his tombstone.

One of Oppenheimer&#x27;s sons, Simon Wolf Oppenheimer, established a banking house in Hanover. Simon Wolff&#x27;s son, Jakob Wolf Oppenheimer continued the family banking house. It was there, from 1757 to 1763, that Mayer Amschel Rothschild apprenticed and learned the banking business that would become synonymous with that family name. Oppenheimer&#x27;s descendants include the composer Felix Mendelssohn.

<text>Samy Vellu s/o Sangalimuthu (; 8 March 1936 – 15 September 2022) was a Malaysian politician who served as Minister of Works from June 1983 to June 1989 and again from May 1995 to March 2008, Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts from June 1989 to May 1995, Minister of Works and Public Amenities from September 1979 to June 1983 and Member of Parliament (MP) for Sungai Siput from September 1974 to March 2008. He was a member and served as 7th President of the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), a component party of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, from October 1979 to December 2010. He is the longest-serving MIC president having held the position for 31 years and one of the longest-serving Cabinet ministers at 29 years. In December 2010, he announced his retirement from politics, paving the way for then MIC Deputy President Palanivel Govindasamy to succeed him as the new party president. 

Former MCA president Ling Liong Sik described Samy Vellu as a man of many talents and with a great sense of humour.

==Political career==
Samy Vellu&#x27;s political career began at the age of 23, in 1959, when he and Govindaraj joined the Batu Caves MIC branch. After five years, he was elected Selangor MIC committee member and the head of the party. He made headline news by climbing up the Indonesian embassy&#x27;s flag pole, pulling down the flag and burning it. He was charged in court and fined RM2. He was called Hero Malaysia on the front pages.

He was a Member of Parliament for Sungai Siput constituency for eight terms from September 1974 to March 2008. During this time, from 1978 to 1979 he was Deputy Minister of Local Government and Housing. Then from 1979 to 1989 he was Minister of Works. He then served as Minister of Energy, Telecommunications and Posts from 1989 to 1995. From 1995 to March 2008 he was the Minister of Works until he lost his parliamentary seat to Michael Jeyakumar Devaraj of the Socialist Party of Malaysia (PSM) who contested on the ticket of the People&#x27;s Justice Party (PKR) in the March 2008 general election.

He was the second longest serving minister in the country during his time, after Rafidah Aziz.

Samy Vellu was appointed Malaysia&#x27;s Special Envoy of Infrastructure to India and Southern Asia, with ministerial rank, since 1 January 2011. The appointment was terminated by the new Pakatan Harapan (PH) government in 2018.

==Personal life==
Vellu was born in Kluang, Johor, and was of Indian descent. He was married to Indrani Samy Vellu and had one son, Vell Paari. He was a chartered architect and a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) and of the Malaysian Institute of Architects.

==Biography==
&quot;A Life. A Legend. A Legacy&quot; written by Bernice Narayanan reveals Samy Vellu&#x27;s achievements and setbacks as well as &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; events in his almost 50 years of active politics.

<doc id="1160872" wikidata="Q2023688" url="?curid=1160872" title="Luna Park">
<text>Luna Park is a name shared by dozens of currently operating and defunct amusement parks. They are named after, and partly based on, the first Luna Park, which opened in 1903 during the heyday of large Coney Island parks. Luna parks are small-scale attraction parks, easily accessed, potentially addressed to the permanent or temporary residential market, and located in the suburbs or even near the town center. Luna parks mainly offer classic funfair attractions (great wheel), newer features (electronic displays) and catering services.

==History==
The original Luna Park on Coney Island, a massive spectacle of rides, ornate towers and cupolas covered in 250,000 electric lights, was opened in 1903 by the showmen and entrepreneurs Frederic Thompson and Elmer &quot;Skip&quot; Dundy. The park was either named after the fanciful airship Luna, part of the new park&#x27;s central attraction A Trip to the Moon, or after Dundy&#x27;s sister. Luna Park was a vastly expanded attraction built partly on the grounds of Sea Lion Park, the first enclosed amusement park on Coney Island which closed down due to competition from nearby Steeplechase Park.

In 1905, Frederick Ingersoll, who was already making a reputation for his pioneering work in roller coaster construction and design (he also designed scenic railroad rides) borrowed the name when he opened Luna Park in Pittsburgh and Luna Park in Cleveland. These first two amusement parks, like their namesake, were covered with electric lighting (the former was adorned with 67,000 light bulbs; the latter, 50,000). Later, in 1907, Charles Looff opened another Luna Park in Seattle, Washington. Ultimately, Ingersoll opened 44 Luna Parks around the world, the first chain of amusement parks. For a short time, Ingersoll renamed his parks Ingersoll&#x27;s Luna Park to distinguish them from the Luna Parks to which he had no connection. Ingersoll&#x27;s death in 1927 and the closing of most of his Luna Parks did not stop new parks from taking the name.

Today, the term &quot;luna park&quot; or &quot;lunapark&quot; is a noun meaning &quot;amusement park&quot; in several languages, including Indo-European languages such as
Polish, French, Italian, Russian, Croatian, Serbian,Bosnian, Slovenian, and Greek (, ), as well as Turkish, Hungarian and Hebrew (לוּנָה פַּארְק, but the term גן שעשועים lit. &#x27;park of amusements&#x27; is also widely used).

<doc id="1160892" wikidata="Q1769479" url="?curid=1160892" title="North Ryde, New South Wales">
<text>North Ryde is a suburb located in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. North Ryde is located 15 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Ryde.

One of Australia&#x27;s major business districts, North Ryde is home to many multi-national corporations such as Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Honeywell. The suburb is the site of Macquarie University and its residents include those from the university academe and the research sector. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) also has a major site on Delhi Road in the Riverside Corporate Park.

North Ryde shares the postcode of 2113 with adjacent suburbs Macquarie Park and East Ryde. These suburbs were once part of North Ryde and many businesses and residences in these suburbs still advertise their address as being in North Ryde. Adjacent Macquarie University was issued with its own postcode, 2109, by Australia Post in the late 1980s.

== History ==
The earliest reference to the area being known as North Ryde appears to be after the district&#x27;s first public school (which opened on 25 January 1878) changed its name from City View Public School to North Ryde Public School in 1879. North Ryde was mainly farming area, until in 1897, it was sold to a Catholic parish. North Ryde is an extension of the adjacent suburb of Ryde which was named after the &#x27;Ryde Store&#x27;, a business run by G.M. Pope. He adopted the name from his birthplace of Ryde on the Isle of Wight, in the UK. Ryde was the name used from the 1840s and adopted as the name of the municipality in 1870.

== Aboriginal culture ==

The whole area between the Parramatta and Lane Cove Rivers was originally populated by Indigenous Australians and known by its Aboriginal name Wallumatta. Contact with the first white settlement&#x27;s bridgehead into Australia quickly devastated much of the population through epidemics of smallpox and other diseases. The Aboriginal name survives in a local reserve, the Wallumatta Nature Reserve, located at the corner of Twin and Cressy roads, North Ryde. Very few remnants of Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest still exist. The most substantial undisturbed area is the Wallumatta Nature Reserve in North Ryde, which is owned and managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. This small and critically endangered reserve, also known as the Macquarie Hospital Bushland, is one of the last remnants of the remaining 0.5% (as at 2007) of original and endangered turpentine-ironbark forests on Wianamatta shale soil in Sydney. See Sydney Turpentine-Ironbark Forest.

== European settlement ==
Ryde is the third oldest settlement in Australia, after Sydney and Parramatta. The name &#x27;Eastern Farms&#x27; was given to the district with the 10 initial land grants in 1792. This name remained in use for a few years before &#x27;Kissing Point&#x27; became the common name. North Ryde was established in the mid 19th century as a farming district, in what was a heavily vegetated area, next to the already established district of Ryde. The Field of Mars Common was considered dangerous, as escaped convicts and bushrangers were known to frequent the area.

=== Early European settlers ===
The earliest settler to receive a land grant in the area bordered by the Field of Mars Common and Bridge/Twin and Badajoz Roads that is now North Ryde was Jane Wood in 1800. Following land grants were to David Brown in 1802, William Kent Jnr in 1803, &quot;Tudor Farm&quot; being the largest land grant in the district, which included all the land between Lane Cove, Herring, Bridge and Waterloo roads, James Weavers and Michael Connor in 1804, and Thomas Granger in 1809. 

Amongst the earliest settlers was James Weavers, a farm labourer born in 1752, who was sentenced to death at 28 March 1787 Bury St Edmunds (Suffolk) Assizes. His sentence was reduced to transportation for life and he arrived in the colony aboard the ship &quot;Surprize&quot; on 26 June 1790. He was granted 30 acres of land in what is now Putney. He married Mary Hutchinson (1765-1850) in 1792 and they had four children. James Weavers and his descendants were part of a remarkable pioneering family whose members variously survived the hardships of harsh conditions, disease, infant mortality and the tragic loss of many of its members in an isolated settlement. James Weavers did well as a farmer and in 1803 he purchased a 60-acre farm (originally granted to Jane Wood, now the site of the North Ryde Golf Course) and received a 100-acre grant of adjoining land in 1804. James Weavers is thought to have been killed by Aborigines on 3 April 1805 and although his burial was registered at St Philips Church, his descendants believe that he was buried on his own land. The earliest settlers to farm in the Putney district were often related by marriages and this included the Weavers, Wicks, Benson, Cox, Hicks and Heard families of North Ryde.

Henry Heard came to Sydney from Devonshire and acquired four acres of land on Twin Road and planted an orchard. He and his wife Mary Jane had nine children, four sons and five daughters born between 1859 and 1876. Apart from the first child, William, who was born and died in 1859 and registered in St Leonards, all the other children were registered in Ryde. Therefore, the growing Heard family must have come to the district just before 1860. He continued to acquire more acreage and expand his orchards and vineyards. After his death one of his sons obtained a further 24 acres, bounded on the north and north-east by Joseph Cox&#x27;s property, on the south and south-east by Wicks Road, on the south-west by Twin Road. In addition to this orchard he also obtained 12 acres of bush land which was further cleared to expand the farm. The Heard&#x27;s orchard was named the Model Farm. Two of Heard&#x27;s cottages survive to this day, the main house at 505 Twin Road and semi-detached Orchard House (1890) and Heards Cottage (1895) on the corner of Cox&#x27;s and Wicks Roads, North Ryde and is listed on Ryde Council&#x27;s Heritage List (No. 97).

Around 1868 Joseph Cox and his brother William, originally from Kent in England, purchased 21 acres of land in North Ryde for £1425. William left to pursue farming on the other side of the Parramatta River. Joseph, along with his wife persevered and named their homestead &quot;Pomona&quot;. They had six children. With extensive orchards and vineyards, Joseph was also a skilled winemaker. Around 1880 Joseph built a three storey manor from locally quarried stone, and a private carriageway with entrance and exit to Cox&#x27;s Road via ornate iron gates hinged on skillfully dressed stone pillars. From the upstairs verandah they had an excellent view of Sydney. &quot;Pomona&quot; was located near the North Ryde Public School on the opposite side of Cox&#x27;s Road.

George Wicks was the Mayor of Ryde in 1876 and he and his wife Sarah Goulding had a total of 12 children. Henry William Watts (Sarah Weavers’ son from her second marriage to William Watts) served as an alderman on Ryde Council and was Mayor from 1886 to 1887. These descendants of James Weavers were orchardists with properties bordering the Field of Mars Common in North Ryde. They were among a few men and women who represented the sizeable proportion of Ryde&#x27;s population who were small landholders based on family farms and who actively campaigned for a local school in what is now North Ryde.

=== Motorcycling ===
In 1928 the Chatswood Motorcycle Club built a course in the area now known as the Commandment Rock Picnic Area of Lane Cove National Park. The North Ryde circuit was an early version of off-road speedway. The first North Ryde meetings were held in May and October 1928. It was reported that the October meeting attracted 7000 spectators. The Commandment Rock course was closed and another circuit known as the North Ryde Speedway was developed on what is now part of North Ryde Golf Course (then known as Cox&#x27;s Paddock), opposite from the present day School of Arts in Cox&#x27;s Road. The track was located in a natural amphitheatre giving spectators an excellent view of the events. A typical meeting comprised 30 events of ten laps each. It closed in about 1935 when the golf course development began and the Chatswood Club merged with Willoughby Motor Cycle Club. One upcoming rider was Ray &quot;Broadside&quot; Taylor, who went on to become Australian Speedway Champion and an international speedway star of the 1930s and 1940s. His motorcycle was named &quot;Daisy&quot; after his wife. As a boy he moved with his family from Dubbo, NSW, to the Sydney suburb of West Ryde where he finished his education. His first dirt track race meeting was at North Ryde run by the Chatswood Motorcycle Club where he won five of the six races entered.

=== World War II ===

During World War II, a substantial army base, the 3rd Australian Ordnance Army Vehicle Park was located in North Ryde, bounded by Epping, Wicks, Cox&#x27;s and Blenheim Roads. Substantial numbers of Jeeps, tanks, transports, emergency motorcycles, generator sets and searchlights, and various military vehicles and equipment were located there, along with heavy transport workshops, personnel and barracks.

=== Post-World War II ===
North Ryde remained rural until after World War II, with a small population whose main activity up until that time was farming. Orchards, market gardens, vineyards and poultry predominated the landscape. In the 1950s and 1960s, the State Government purchased and subdivided much of the land for war service homes and public housing. During the postwar years the character of the district underwent a major change, from rural to suburban residential. The rapid development of North Ryde saw many of the older dwellings and buildings demolished.

After the war, the huts previously used by the army on the southern side of Blenheim Road were utilised as a migrant hostel and for Australian families in urgent need of accommodation due to the acute housing shortage.

A large pig farm was located at the northern end of Wicks Road and was operational until the late 1960s.

An outdoor theatre had operated in Khartoum Road for many years showing silent and then &quot;talkie&quot; movies and was known locally as &quot;the Shack&quot;.

In 1956, the North Ryde Skyline Drive-In Theatre was opened on the southern corner of Waterloo and Lane Cove Roads, on land that was previously an orange orchard. It had capacity for 639 cars, a fully equipped restaurant with facilities which also housed the projection booths, and a large children&#x27;s playground was located under the huge screen. It showed its final movies, Rocky IV and Conan The Destroyer, on 5 February 1986.

== Cox&#x27;s Road ==
North Ryde&#x27;s main street is Cox&#x27;s Road (the lower part of which was previously Coomassie Street). and was originally sandstone-lined to make it easier to haul goods up and down from the wharf on the Lane Cove River to the top of the hill. Cox&#x27;s Road was named after Joseph Cox who owned land and lived in the area. Coxs Road was spelled with an apostrophe (Cox&#x27;s) until recent times, though local street signs and Ryde Council still call it Cox&#x27;s Road. The original North Ryde Post Office on Lane Cove Road was opened in 1885 and in 1908 was moved to Cox&#x27;s Road, and has since relocated premises within the Cox&#x27;s Road Shopping precinct at least six times. The North Ryde School of Arts and Literary Institute, built in 1901 on land donated by William Cox of Pomona, became the venue for the annual ball, community meetings, fetes, art exhibitions, dances and culture. Extensions were built in 1907 with the North Ryde Library Branch located here. Cox’s Road has 2 schools a Public and Catholic school, they are both primary schools.The original building was demolished in 1980 and a new Community Centre, School of Arts and Library complex was built.

J. Thompson&#x27;s Shop (1904) in Cox&#x27;s Road was the general store and post office for many years, and apart from the schoolhouse and a couple of heritage listed cottages nearby are the only remaining original buildings still standing from those early years. Three gas street lamps were installed in Cox&#x27;s Road in the 1920s. One has been restored and is in front of the schoolhouse. The Cox&#x27;s Road Shopping Centre was destroyed by a suspicious fire around 1990 and a new shopping mall was built with improved amenities.

== S.M.C Electric Lighting Substation No. 79 ==
With the electrification of the district the S.M.C (Sydney Municipal Council) Electric Lighting Substation No. 79 located at 293 Pittwater Road, North Ryde, directly opposite North Ryde Park, was completed in 1916. However, it was never used for its intended purpose to supply the Ryde area with electricity and was simply used as a storehouse for many years. It has come to be known as &quot;the electricity substation that never was&quot;. Now a heritage listed building, approval was given to redevelop the site into residential townhouses. The substation sits at the front of the site, with its full original S.M.C Electric Lighting Sub-Station signage still intact, with the newer developments towards the rear of the site.

== Population ==
In the , there were people in North Ryde. 49.7% of people were born in Australia; the next most common countries of birth included China (excluding Special Administrative Regions (SARs) and Taiwan) 9.6%, India 4.2%, South Korea 3.0%, Hong Kong (SAR of China) 2.6% and the Philippines 2.3%. 49.1% of people only spoke English at home; other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 11.4%, Cantonese 5.9%, Korean 3.6%, Armenian 3.0%, and Hindi 1.7%. The most common responses for religion included No Religion 35.1%, Catholic 22.2%, Anglican 7.2%, and Hinduism 4.2%; a further 7.1% of respondents for this area elected not to disclose their religious status.

== Commercial areas ==
North Ryde features many commercial and industrial developments. The Cox&#x27;s Road Shopping Centre is a small shopping mall that features a supermarket, the post office, and specialty shops. The Public School, Community Centre, Library and School of Arts are all located nearby. Another commercial development is located opposite featuring a number of cafes, and eateries. Another row of shops is located in Blenheim Road, including the Adwill Place Arcade. There is also another row of shops in Avon road which feature hairdressing salons, a cafe and specialist health providers.

In 1961 the CSIRO Division of Food Preservation moved from Homebush to its new buildings at North Ryde. Although it has undergone several name changes since then, the Division now located at 11 Julius Avenue in the Riverside Corporate Park. The mid-1960s saw the combined establishment of the North Ryde Industrial Area and Macquarie University to emulate the industrial areas surrounding and associated with Stanford University near San Francisco, California. Industries were originally limited to being &quot;light&quot;, science related, and include research activities. The area has seen massive growth since the 1960s with the precincts in Macquarie Park and the Riverside Corporate Park now having the reputation as the leading high-tech industrial areas in Australia, attracting major information technology, communication, electronic, computing, scientific, medical, and pharmaceutical companies.

In 1994, Datacom opened its first office in Australia to expand its NZ-based services to Microsoft Australia. Datacom is a 50 year old IT company that designs, builds and runs IT systems and processes for business.

The neighbouring suburb of Macquarie Park, still considered a part of North Ryde, includes the regional shopping centre Macquarie Centre, Macquarie University, ARN (WSFM and The Edge 96.1 studios), Sony, Foxtel, Optus, CA, Rexel Group Australia and many corporate headquarters.

Network Ten had its original headquarters and Sydney television production studios in North Ryde from 1965 until 1991, after which Global Television was located on the site until 2007. The site is now occupied by North Ryde railway station and apartment towers.

== North Ryde Station Precinct Concept Plan ==
The North Ryde Station Precinct Concept Plan is a concept plan currently underway to determine the future of the areas in the vicinity of North Ryde railway station. On 4 December 2013 approval was given for the Development Control Plan (DCP) setting out vision, objectives and controls for future development of the North Ryde Station Precinct.

Construction began in 2015 and the Ryde Gardens apartment tower blocks on the old Channel 10 site, with access to North Ryde Railway Station, are occupied. The next stage of apartment towers, Lachlan&#x27;s Line is also underway, with a pedestrian and cycleway bridge to be constructed over Delhi Road to give direct access to the North Ryde Railway Station.

== Schools ==
The district&#x27;s first public school, City View Public School, opened on 25 January 1878 with 45 pupils but changed its name to North Ryde Public School in 1879, which is the earliest reference to the name North Ryde. It was originally called City View as the city of Sydney was visible from the roof. The original building in Cox&#x27;s Road is a brick and sandstone building built in 1877 on one acre of land donated by Richard Wicks which now houses the New South Wales Schoolhouse Museum of Public Education. It is one of the oldest school buildings in New South Wales.

A second primary school, Truscott Street Public School, opened on 21 May 1958 to cater for the children of WWII veterans. In 1988 the Truscott Street school incorporated a &quot;Special Unit&quot; for children with special needs.

A large and modern senior school, North Ryde High School, was built on land between Epping, Wicks and Waterloo Roads and opened in January 1962. It was later renamed Peter Board High School, which many residents felt took away its local identity. The school was subsequently phased out and closed in December 1998, demographics being used as justification for the decision. This move left North Ryde without a high school, with Ryde Secondary College being the nearest alternative.

A Catholic school, Holy Spirit Primary School, is located in Coxs Road, slightly further down from North Ryde Public School, on the opposite side of the road. Ryde East Primary School is located on Twin Road, with 350 students.

Arndell School is located in Badajoz Road on the Macquarie Hospital campus.

== Hospitals ==

=== Macquarie Hospital ===

The Macquarie Hospital is bounded by Cox&#x27;s, Wicks, Twin and Badajoz Roads. The Hospital commenced functioning in 1959. It was originally known as the North Ryde Mental Asylum but has undergone several other name changes from North Ryde Psychiatric Centre to Gladesville-Macquarie Hospital, following an amalgamation of services with Gladesville Mental Hospital. Due to confusion caused by the inclusion of Gladesville in the Hospital&#x27;s name, on 22 October 1999 notification was published that the Hospital was to be known as Macquarie Hospital. Macquarie Hospital is an important 195 bed specialist mental health facility offering acute admission, non-acute recovery and extended care programs for adults with a mental illness/disorder who reside within the Northern Sydney Central Coast Health catchment area. The hospital works collaboratively with a range of community mental health and specialist non-government organisations and has a catchment population of approximately 1,110,000 residents. The hospital is gazetted under the New South Wales Mental Health Act 1990. Macquarie Hospital is involved in a major planning project to develop an evidence-based service model for the future delivery of mental health services involving Northern Sydney and Central Coast catchment areas for the next ten years. This includes the development of a Procurement Feasibility Plan for a proposed Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit which may be developed on the Macquarie campus. New Horizons Enterprises, part of the Macquarie Hospital North Ryde Auxiliary, operates an acute aged care facility in Badajoz Road, on the site of the former New Horizons Service Station, with sheltered workshops and Head Office in Twin Road. Arndell Special School (Disturbed Children&#x27;s Ward) is located in the Macquarie Hospital campus, along with other specialist providers and an Education Centre for training and evaluation.

There are no emergency services at Macquarie Hospital. The nearest emergency departments are at Ryde Hospital, Concord Hospital, or Royal North Shore Hospital.

=== Macquarie University Hospital ===

The Macquarie University Hospital is a specialist private hospital that opened on 15 June 2010 located on the Campus of Macquarie University in Macquarie Park, North Ryde. It is now the primary teaching hospital affiliated with the University&#x27;s Australian School of Advanced Medicine. The Hospital features some of the most advanced medical facilities in Australia, including the first gamma knife in Australia.

There are no emergency services at Macquarie University Hospital. The nearest emergency departments are at Ryde Hospital, Concord Hospital, or Royal North Shore Hospital.

== Cemeteries and crematoria ==
=== Field of Mars Cemetery ===
One of the oldest cemeteries in Sydney, the Field of Mars Cemetery in Quarry Road, Ryde, then part of the Field of Mars, was proclaimed on 3 December 1887, and opened in 1890. There are currently approximately 66000 people buried there.

=== Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium ===
The Macquarie Park Cemetery and Crematorium (formerly known as the Northern Suburbs General Cemetery) North Ryde opened in 1922 . The cemetery is situated on 59 hectares of Crown land on Delhi Road directly opposite the entrance to the underground metro North Ryde railway station. It was also originally part of the Field of Mars Common.
=== Northern Suburbs Crematorium ===
Nowadays officially named the Northern Suburbs Memorial Gardens and Crematorium, the New South Wales state government made the Delhi Road site at North Ryde available for development into a crematorium in December 1931. The crematorium was opened on 28 October 1933, and the first cremation took place two days later. Located at 199 Delhi Road, North Ryde, it is the second oldest crematorium in Sydney, after Rookwood.

== Transport ==

The M2 Hills Motorway passes through North Ryde en route to the Lane Cove Tunnel motorway, and then the Gore Hill/Warringah Freeway, Sydney Harbour Bridge, and Sydney CBD. Lane Cove Road (A3), traverses North Ryde from north to south, linking Sydney&#x27;s North Shore to Homebush Bay and Sydney Olympic Park. Epping Road runs west to east and crosses the Lane Cove River Bridge to link the City of Ryde to the Municipality of Lane Cove.

North Ryde is serviced by public buses, primarily the Routes 285-297, 506, and 533-535 which criss-cross the district. Private shuttle buses provide local and Airport services.

North Ryde railway station is an underground railway station on the Sydney Metro M1 line that opened on 29 February 2009. It is located close to the intersection of Epping Road and Delhi Road, near the M2 Motorway. North Ryde station closed in September 2018 for seven months for conversion to a Sydney Metro station on the Sydney Metro Northwest line, which included the installation of platform screen doors. It reopened 26 May 2019. It is serviced by automated Metro driverless trains terminating at Sydenham.

The area once known as North Ryde now has three underground railway stations, North Ryde, Macquarie Park, and Macquarie University.

A major transport interchange is planned at Macquarie.

== Parks and reserves ==

North Ryde has many beautiful parks and reserves, including North Ryde Common, and the adjacent Lane Cove National Park, the Field of Mars Reserve, and access to the Great North Walk and the Lane Cove River, once home to the famous Fairyland picnic grounds, when boatloads of people would come up the river from Sydney for the regular Saturday Dances. Today very little remains of Fairyland and it is almost completely overgrown.

North Ryde Park received a major upgrade in 2009 with fully refurbished amenities block and a new children&#x27;s play area.

Blenheim Park is a multi-functional family park and features an off-leash area for dogs.

The Lane Cove River Tourist Park is a (paid/for a fee) caravan park nestled in a bush setting in the Lane Cove National Park, just a few minutes walk from the North Ryde underground railway station.

It was founded by people who were also board members of the &quot;Schweiz&quot; transport insurance company.

The business activity began on 1 May 1873. In 1875, accident insurance was added. The company was renamed &quot;Transport- und Unfall-Versicherungs-Actiengesellschaft &quot;Zurich&quot;&quot;. In 1880 Zurich abandoned the marine business following a significant loss.

Through 1894, it acquired licenses to conduct business in Austria, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the rest of Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, Russia, Italy, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein. Due to the change in 1894 from transport insurance to accident and liability insurance, it was renamed &quot;Zurich&quot; &quot;Allgemeine Unfall- und Haftpflicht-Versicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot;. Due to legal settlements in the area of workers&#x27; compensation, it took a risk and entered the North American market in 1912, starting in the states of New York, Illinois, New Jersey, and Massachusetts in the US.

In 1915, Zurich acquired its first whole company, &quot;Hispania Compañia General de Seguros&quot; of Barcelona in Spain. Ten years later, in 1922, Zurich founded &quot;Vita Lebensversicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot; as an independent subsidiary, which soon expanded into neighboring countries. In addition, a branch was established in the United Kingdom (the first foreign insurance company to do so). One year later, another branch was established in Canada.

In 1925, Zurich became the official insurer of all new Ford vehicles in Great Britain. The &quot;Zurich Fire Insurance Company of New York&quot; was founded in 1929, the reinsurance company Turegum in 1938 and the &quot;American Guarantee and Liability Company in New York&quot; in 1939.

In 1950, it bought a share in &quot;Companhia de Seguros Metrópole S.A.&quot; of Lisbon. Five years later, in 1955, &quot;«Zürich» Allgemeine Unfall- und Haftpflicht-Versicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot; was renamed &quot;«Zürich» Versicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot;, a name it still holds today.

Between 1955 and 1976 several companies were acquired, including the &quot;Commonwealth General Assurance Corporation&quot; of Sydney, &quot;Iguazù Compañia de Seguros S.A.&quot; from Buenos Aires, &quot;Empire Fire and Marine Insurance Company&quot; from Nebraska, &quot;Fidelity and Deposit Company&quot; from Maryland, &quot;Universal Underwriters&quot; from Kansas City, &quot;Anglo Americana de Seguros Gerais&quot; from São Paulo, &quot;Minerva Group&quot; from Italy, &quot;Centre Reinsurance Holding&quot; from Bermuda, &quot;La Chilena Consolidada&quot;, and &quot;Seguros de Vida&quot; from Chile and &quot;Seguros Chapultepec&quot; from Mexico.

On the initiative of &quot;Vita Lebensversicherungs-Gesellschaft&quot;, the first Vita Parcours (fitness trails) in Switzerland were created in 1968 and ZIM (Zurich Investment Management) was founded in 1990 as an investment management partner for redemption funds and institutional investors in Switzerland. As part of a new brand strategy, &quot;Vita&quot; became &quot;Zurich&quot; Life Insurance Company in 1993, operating in the market under the name &quot;Zürich Leben&quot;. While the name &quot;Vita&quot; thus disappeared from the market, it lives on in the &quot;Stiftung Vita Parcours&quot;, which was outsourced in 1994. In 1994, &quot;Zürich&quot; took over the Zurich private bank &quot;Rüd, Blass &amp; Cie.&quot; Due to refocusing on the insurance business, the private bank was sold again in 2003.

In 1996, Zurich acquired 80 percent of &quot;Kemper Corporation&quot; and 97 percent of &quot;Kemper Financial Service&quot; and in 1997 acquired a majority interest in New York-based &quot;Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark&quot;. Subsequently, Kemper was merged with Scudder to form &quot;Scudder Kemper Investments&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;Zurich Scudder Investments&quot;. Following the September 11 attacks, on 24 September 2001, Zurich Financial announced it would sell Zurich Scudder, which then had US$370 billion in assets under management, to Deutsche Bank for US$2.5 billion (US$1.2 billion in cash and the rest in assets). The transaction was closed on 5 April 2002.

=== Zurich Financial Services (1998–2012) ===
In September 1998, Zurich and the financial division of British American Tobacco merged to form &quot;Zurich Financial Services&quot;. This comprised the Swiss company &quot;Zurich Allied AG&quot;, listed on the Swiss Market Index, and the British company &quot;Allied Zurich plc&quot;, listed on the FTSE 100 (Dual-listed Company). In 2000, the structure was reorganized under a single holding company under Swiss company law. All old shares were replaced by new shares in the newly formed &quot;Zurich Financial Services&quot; (ZFS) with a first listing on the SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich and a second listing in London. 

In 2002, ZFS focused on insurance-related financial products and services. ZFS returned to profitability in 2003, announcing that it had met its targets and posted a profit of US$2.1 billion, compared to a loss of US$3.4 billion a year earlier. Operating income increased 93 percent to $2.3 billion, marking the turnaround. Zurich remained on track in 2004 with net income of US$2.5 billion and operating income of US$3.1 billion, an increase of 36 percent over the previous year. Zurich&#x27;s net income increased by 30 percent to US$3.2 billion in 2005, and operating income rose by 32 percent to US$3.9 billion. In 2008, &quot;Zurich Financial Services&quot; recorded net income of US$3 billion, compared to a record US$5.7 billion in the previous year.

In July 2011, Zurich announced that it had signed definitive agreements for a long-term alliance with &quot;Banco Santander SA&quot; (Santander) over 25 years in Latin America.

=== Zurich Insurance Group (since 2012) ===
In April 2012, Zurich Financial Services Ltd changed back to its original name, Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. In a statement, the Group explained the rationale behind the name change. &quot;In recognition of this strategic focus, the reference to financial services in the company name has been replaced by indicating the insurance activity of the Group instead and to specify the purpose accordingly.&quot;

In December 2015, the CEO Martin Senn (who died by suicide in May 2016) announced his resignation. Despite years of highly profitable business operations, the focus was put on recent events which forced Senn to step down. Interim chairman took over as acting CEO.

In January 2016, it was announced that Zurich had hired Mario Greco, CEO of Generali as its next chief executive, and that he would start in May.

Zurich Spain launched Klinc in 2018, a Spanish digital company that offers online insurance plans for cars, life, home, devices, and micromobility led by Stefano de Liguoro, Head of Digital at Zurich Seguros. The company sprung from the multinational insurance company Zurich Seguros. In 2021, the company merged with doppo, a digital auto insurance start up. Zurich Klinc is dedicated to promoting a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. As a result, it focuses on promoting and sponsoring sporting events such as the Orbea Monegros, and the Orbea Klasika in Bilbao.

In November 2021, Zurich signed an acquisition agreement with Texas-based Special Insurance Services.

On 3 January 2022, Zurich Insurance Group announced that its Italian subsidiary, Zurich Investments Life S.p.A. had agreed to sell its life and pension back book to the Portuguese insurer and wealth management platform GamaLife – Companhia de Seguros de Vida, S.A. (GamaLife), for an undisclosed sum. Zurich said the transaction was expected to release approximately $1.2bn (£907m, €1bn) of capital.

In March 2022, Zurich Insurance Group retired the short logo (a white Z in a blue circle) due to the symbol&#x27;s association with the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

ZIP writes non-life insurance business across the European Union through its Irish head office and network of branches.

In July 2023, it was announced that ZIP would undergo a &quot;cross-border conversion&quot; from a public limited company in Ireland to a (stock corporation) in Germany. 

== Zurich North America==
Zurich expanded into US and Canadian market in 1912 to become one of the leading commercial P&amp;C insurance provider. It serves a diverse set of industries including automotive, agriculture, construction, manufacturing, technology and numerous others.

== Corporate social responsibility ==
In 2009, Zurich was awarded Charity Times &quot;Best Insurance Services&quot; and was shortlisted again in 2010. In 2012 the Zurich Community Trust (UK) won the Cross-Sector Partnership of the Year Award for its partnership with the treatment charity Addaction.

According to its website, Zurich Community Trust has donated over £60 million since 1972, with the goal of addressing key social issues. It has supported over 600 charities a year, making a measurable impact on the lives of over 80,000 people. Zurich was one of the first recipients of the Community Mark from Business in the Community which it has successfully retained for three years.

On 24 October 2002, Zurich North America hosted a ceremony at the 9/11 Tribute Center honoring the winners of its 2012 K.A.M.P. awards, a program created as a living legacy to the four employees killed on 9/11: John Keohane, Peggy Alario, Kathy Moran and Ludwig Picarro.

Zurich began a relationship with SBP, a disaster relief organization based in New Orleans, at its Zurich Classic golf tournament in New Orleans. Over the next five years, more than 1,000 Zurich employees, customers, brokers, and distributors volunteered with SBP to rebuild homes in New Orleans, Staten Island and Joplin, until in April 2014, the company announced that its Z Zurich Foundation would give SBP a $3 million grant over three years. The grant would go towards creating a Disaster Resilience and Recovery Lab—a disaster relief model that propagates best practices learned in New Orleans after Katrina to communities affected by future disasters.

In 2011, Zurich launched a free online resource – My Community Starter – designed to make getting involved in community activities more simple.

In March 2012, Zurich reinforced its commitment to the Z Zurich foundation by making a substantial investment of $100 million.

In March 2013, Zurich announced its global flood resilience program, which aims to enhance community flood resilience by finding innovative ways to increase the impact of disaster risk reduction efforts at community, national and global levels. The first country program is taking place in Mexico and Indonesia. To maximize the community impact of the program, Zurich has formed a strategic alliance with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

== Financial performance and information ==

Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (&quot;Zurich&quot;) is listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange under the ticker ZURN. As of 1 December 2012 there were 148,300,123 fully paid registered shares and 124,847 shareholders. 24.7% of the holding of the registered shares were private individuals (15.3% of all outstanding shares), 7.2% were foundations and pension funds (4.5% of all outstanding shares) and 68.1% were other legal entities (42.3% of all outstanding shares).

== Controversies ==
In 2006, Zurich Financial Services settled a $171 million case relating to bid rigging and price fixing in the United States. &quot;Businesses shopping for commercial insurance were deceived into believing they were getting the best deals available,&quot; said Abbott. &quot;The whole anti-competitive scheme was an intentional smoke screen by several insurance players to artificially inflate premiums and pay improper commissions to those who brokered the deals.&quot; The states included in the settlement were Texas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Zurich is also required to pay about $122 million in refunds to commercial policyholders in a New Jersey class action lawsuit settlement. Zurich Financial Services settled a bid-rigging and improper &quot;finite reinsurance&quot; transactions probe. 

Zurich Financial agreed to pay $153 million in restitution and penalties and agreed to a series of reforms. Zurich apologized and acknowledged that &quot;certain of its employees violated both acceptable business practices and Zurich&#x27;s own standards of conduct by engaging in improper bidding practices and the &#x27;finite reinsurance&#x27; transactions described in the Assurance of Discontinuance&quot;. The states included in the settlement were New York, Connecticut and Illinois.

In May 2007, Zurich Capital Markets, a subsidiary of Zurich Financial Services, paid $16.8 million to settle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for helping four hedge funds disguise their identities to avoid detection when making frequent trades in mutual fund shares. An SEC director stated, &quot;By knowingly financing their hedge funds clients&#x27; deceptive market timing, ZCM reaped substantial fees at the expense of long-term mutual-fund shareholders&quot;.

In 2015, small business owners and property developers in Britain complained that Zurich&#x27;s British subsidiary, Dunbar Bank, had treated them unfairly by calling in loans quickly in order to wind down its loan book after the parent company pulled out of the specialist UK property market in 2010. They claimed that 71 Dunbar borrowers had been made bankrupt in the following five-year period, many more than by any of Britain&#x27;s very much larger high street banks. One Dunbar customer wrote: &quot;Dunbar&#x27;s latest set of accounts show that over 95% of its loan book is now classified as impaired or overdue [...] the equivalent figure for UK Asset Resolution, the country&#x27;s bad bank, is just 37%&quot;.

In 2019, the local branch of Zurich Insurance Group was one of four insurance companies fined by Portugal&#x27;s competition authority AdC for &quot;cartel practices&quot; regarding workplace accident, health and auto insurance.

In March 2022, Zurich Insurance suspended the use of its logo containing an encircled &quot;Z&quot; on social media due to the widespread international association of an enclosed &quot;Z&quot; as a support of Russian violence against Ukrainians. The company said in a statement that it wished to avoid how its communications &quot;could be misinterpreted&quot;.

<doc id="1160897" wikidata="Q4978113" url="?curid=1160897" title="Bruce Parker">
<text>Bruce Rodney Wingate Parker, is a British journalist and television presenter whose career spanned the mid-1960s to 2003, when he retired. 

==Career==
Strongly committed to regional broadcasting, he was responsible in the mid-1960s for a pilot local radio station in the Channel Islands, which partly led to the setting up of a string of BBC local radio stations across the UK. In 1967 he joined BBC South in Southampton, where he remained for most of his career, making a name as the main presenter and reporter for &quot;South Today&quot; for 37 years, a record stint for any regional presenter in the UK. He was also a respected political interviewer and later BBC South&#x27;s political editor, hosting &quot;South of Westminster&quot; and &quot;South on Sunday&quot;.

In the 1970s he became a familiar face to viewers in the rest of Britain, first as a network news reporter and later as the first host of &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; (which he helped set up with Robin Drake) and a regular contributor to and presenter of &quot;Nationwide&quot;. He also presented the BBC1 arts magazine &quot;Mainstream&quot; in 1979 and a number of &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; editions in the 1970s and 1980s. He was also the BBC commentator for the raising of the &quot;Mary Rose&quot; in October 1982, clips of which regularly appear on nostalgia and retrospective programmes. He also presented a number of programmes on Radio 4 including &quot;The Week&#x27;s Antiques&quot;, which he devised, and the regional &quot;Today&quot; from the South and West.

He has won several Royal Television Society awards and is the author of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Soapbox&quot; (with Nigel Farrell), &quot;The History of Elizabeth College&quot; and &quot;A History of Guernsey Full-Bore Rifle Shooting.&quot;

A keen rifle-shot since his schooldays when he became Public Schools&#x27; small-bore champion and UK cadet forces champion, he achieved further successes at Bisley&#x27;s Imperial Meeting, winning &#x27;The Century&#x27; in 1963 and appearing in the Queen&#x27;s Prize Final a number of times. He was a member of Guernsey and Channel Island teams until 2003 and took part in the Commonwealth championships in 1988, held in Sydney, Australia. 

Brought up in Guernsey, Parker was educated at Elizabeth College Guernsey followed by the University of Wales and a postgraduate degree at the University of Reading.

<text>George Alexander Eugene Douglas Haig, 2nd Earl Haig, (15 March 1918 – 9 July 2009) was a Scottish artist and peer who succeeded to the earldom of Haig on 29 January 1928, at the age of nine upon the death of his father, Field Marshal the 1st Earl Haig. Until then he was styled Viscount Dawick. Throughout his life, he was usually known to his family and friends as Dawyck Haig.

==Early life==
Haig spent his early years at Bemersyde in the Borders of Scotland. In 1937 he was a Page of Honour to George VI at his coronation. He was educated at Stowe School and at Christ Church, Oxford, receiving a BA in 1939 and a MA in 1950.

During World War II Haig served as a commissioned officer with the British Army&#x27;s Royal Scots Greys Regiment in Palestine, and in North Africa during the Western Desert Campaign, where he was captured during an attack on the Afrika Corps&#x27; lines in 1941. He was subsequently held as a prisoner of war in Italy and Germany, including a spell at Oflag IV-C P.O.W. Camp (known to the British inmates as &quot;Colditz&quot;), where he was held as a member of the &quot;Prominente&quot; – a prisoner with family connections to powerful political/military figures in the Allied nations that were kept under special confinement conditions via the orders of Heinrich Himmler, for purposes undisclosed. It was at Colditz that Haig developed his talents as a painter and draughtsman.

==Later life==
Haig was involved with charities that provided for ex-servicemen founded by his father. He was chairman of the British Legion in Scotland from 1962 to 1965 and president of the Earl Haig Fund from 1980 to 1986. In 1966 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to the British Legion.

In 1977 he was dubbed a Knight of the Order of St John. In 2000 he published an autobiography entitled &quot;My Father&#x27;s Son&quot;. Haig was also a distinguished artist and an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy.

In September 2006, Earl Haig criticised the Ministry of Defence&#x27;s decision to posthumously pardon all 306 British soldiers executed during World War I for cowardice, desertion or other offences. In reference to the soldiers pardoned, he stated that &quot;It was a terribly sad situation and some of these soldiers were genuinely shell-shocked. But many were rogues, persistent deserters and criminals, or they were guilty of cowardice. They had to be made an example of.&quot; This remark drew criticism from Andrew MacKinlay MP, who had campaigned for the pardon and was reported as &quot;astonished&quot; by Earl Haig&#x27;s remarks, claiming that they had not received due process.

==Death==

He died on 9 July 2009 at Borders General Hospital, aged 91. His body was buried in the Haig family plot at Dryburgh Abbey in the Borders. The simple grave lies in front of his father&#x27;s grave.

==Family==
Earl Haig married, on 19 July 1956, Adrienne Thérèse Morley (4 May 1929 – 3 January 2010), daughter of Derrick Morley, formerly of Islanmore and Rockstown Castle, co. Limerick (great-great-nephew of the 1st Baron Fermoy), by Lesley, eldest daughter of Sir Nigel Leslie Campbell, of Woodrow High House, Amersham, Buckinghamshire (grandson of Lord Charles Pelham-Clinton), and had three children:

*Lady Adrienne Raina Haig,
*Lady Elizabeth Vivienne Thérèse Haig,
*Alexander Douglas Derrick Haig, 3rd Earl Haig.

The Earl and Countess Haig were divorced in 1981 and, on 24 March 1981, he married Donna Gerolama Lopez y Royo di Taurisano (of the Neapolitan Dukes di Taurisano e Monteroni). She died on 15 April 2023, at the age of 85.

<text>ProBoards is a free, remotely hosted message board service that facilitates online discussions by allowing people to create their own online communities. ProBoards was founded by California-based technology entrepreneur Patrick Clinger, who developed the ProBoards software to empower online community creation

==Ownership and service statistics==
ProBoards was founded by Patrick Clinger, who wrote the ProBoards software. Prior to launching ProBoards, Clinger had run HostedScripts, a company aimed at creating free web widgets.

The service hosts over 3,000,000 internet forums, which in turn have approximately 22,800,000 users worldwide. Currently, all ProBoards forums combined receive a total of over 600 million pageviews per month, making ProBoards one of the largest websites on the Internet. As of 2013, ProBoards forums collectively received over 600 million pageviews per month, making it one of the largest websites on the Internet at that time. However, pageviews have decreased in recent years, reflecting broader trends in forum usage

However, according to &quot;TechCrunch&quot; writer Anthony Ha, those numbers have seemingly dropped as of 2014. In an interview, founder/owner Patrick Clinger stated &quot;ProBoards has been used to create 3.5 million forums&quot;, but about 1.2 million of them are still active (i.e. resulting in the occasional page view). 

In October 2021, ProBoards was purchased by internet company VerticalScope Holdings a company specializing in online communities and digital media. Following the acquisition, Patrick Clinger and the ProBoards team joined VerticalScope to continue developing the platform.

==Software history==
Proboards is coded in Perl, a popular programming language with web developers. Previously, due to the remotely hosted nature of the service, users could not modify the software directly as with some forum systems, but some customisation was possible through the use of CSS or JavaScript codes. With the release of v.5, however, ProBoards gives Administrators and certain other members access to the HTML and CSS of the webpage, for easier coding purposes.

The first day of business for ProBoards was January 1, 2000. At first, ProBoards originally used software created by the owner, Patrick Clinger. In late 2001, though, ProBoards switched to the YaBB system. At the same time, other changes to the service made it the first remotely hosted service to offer a subdomain with each forum (e.g. username.proboards[servernumber].com)

On June 11, 2002, ProBoards Version 2 was launched. This was coded by Clinger and was a rewrite of the entire software rather than improvements to the existing YaBB based setup. The main goals of this rewrite were to improve the overall speed of the software and add new features to keep the product competitive.

In February 2003, version 3 of the ProBoards software was released, again making improvements on the overall speed of the software and including over 30 new features.

ProBoards upgraded to version 4 of its software on April 30, 2005. This time, the upgrade added over 100 new features and enhancements to the service. Despite this, bugs of varying levels of severity still existed.

ProBoards underwent significant upgrades, with Version 2 (launched in June 2002) featuring a complete software rewrite to improve speed and add new features. Version 3 (February 2003) introduced over 30 enhancements, while Version 4 (April 30, 2005) added over 100 new features. The most recent major release, Version 5 (April 2013), brought mobile optimization, live search, and advanced customization tools.

The current version of the software is v5.
ProBoards&#x27; servers - physical machines running the ProBoards software - are hosted by SoftLayer. Previous to November 2010, ProBoards was hosted by ThePlanet.com, and previous to 2006, EV1 Servers. The servers are hosted in multiple SoftLayer datacenters in Texas.

In 2005, Patrick Clinger was invited by EV1 Servers to take part in a commercial for their business. The commercial opened with a voiceover introducing Clinger as the owner of ProBoards.com, and he then gave a testimonial about how EV1&#x27;s hosting benefited ProBoards. The commercial was shown at the 2005 Houston Bowl. Since 2007, EV1 no longer exists as a webhost, having merged with The Planet.

As of March 2009, the server numbers (boardname.proboards##.com) no longer need to be used due to a recent change that allows every ProBoards forum to be accessed without a server number in the URL. (For example, boardname.proboards.com)

Due to the advent of Facebook, ProBoards transitioned into a social network and forum service hybrid with the introduction of version 5 in 2013. In 2014, ProBoards launched Forums.net, a monthly subscription-based service for hosting private message boards for businesses.

==Hosting==
Although a number of subscription style features are optionally available, there is no obligation for any user to purchase anything from ProBoards. Forums are hosted for free, with no bandwidth or webspace cap, provided users allow advertisements to be displayed on their forum. ProBoards continues to offer forums with no bandwidth or webspace limitations, supported by advertisements. Users can purchase subscription-based features to unlock advanced functionalities, such as ad removal and forum branding options.

Until September 2003, ProBoards was supported by popunders, but these were discontinued in favor of less intrusive methods of advertising. Currently a typical forum will contain a Google AdSense banner ad and some small text links on every page. ProBoards also sells advertising directly to users through a selfserve system.

ProBoards also has an agreement with a third party chatroom provider, addonInteractive, to provide Java-based chatrooms to users. Each forum admin can activate a free version of the chat on their forum, with paid upgrades available for busy forums. The chats integrate fully with forum accounts.

==Policies==
ProBoards users are bound by a number of Terms of Service, restricting the type of content which may appear on a ProBoards forum. ProBoards prohibits illegal or adult content. Formerly, only English forums were allowed, but in May 2010 this policy was changed, allowing boards to be created in any language. In addition to content policies, Proboards terms also seemingly prohibit the use of &quot;ad-blocking&quot; technology when accessing its services. In November 2020, ProBoards took the decision to remove a forum used by members of the New York Police Department after an officer who was a regular poster on the board was outed as having used it to share &quot;racist, misogynistic, anti-Semitic, and homophobic sentiments&quot;.

User privacy is protected by a Privacy Policy outlining the use of logged information, as well as cookie policy, forum monitoring, and publicly available information.

The US COPPA law is enforced by requiring all users to enter their date of birth on registration. Users aged under 13 are not permitted to register at any ProBoards forum. According to the Terms of Service, any user under the age of 18 also requires parental permission to register, but this is taken as implied when they accept the registration agreement and not verified.

ProBoards allows users to apply affiliate marketing practices to monetize their communities via a partnership with VigLink announced January 2014. This partnership allows any ProBoards forum managers or creators to generate revenue from traffic with VigLink Insert.

<text>A mesogen is a compound that displays liquid crystal properties. Mesogens can be described as disordered solids or ordered liquids because they arise from a unique state of matter that exhibits both solid- and liquid-like properties called the liquid crystalline state. This liquid crystalline state (LC) is called the mesophase and occurs between the crystalline solid (Cr) state and the isotropic liquid (Iso) state at distinct temperature ranges.

The liquid crystal properties arise because mesogenic compounds are composed of rigid and flexible parts, which help characterize the order and mobility of its structure. The rigid components align mesogen moieties in one direction and have distinctive shapes that are typically found in the form of rod or disk shapes. The flexible segments provide mesogens with mobility because they are usually made up of alkyl chains, which hinder crystallization to a certain degree. The combination of rigid and flexible chains induce structural alignment and fluidity between liquid crystal moieties.

In doing so, varying degrees of order and mobility within mesogens results in different types of liquid crystal phases, Figure 1. The nematic phase (N) is the least ordered and most fluid liquid crystalline state or mesophase that is based on the rigid core of mesogen moieties. The nematic phase leads to long range orientational order and short range positional order of mesogens. The smectic (Sm) and columnar (Col) phases are more ordered and less fluid than their nematic phases and demonstrate long range orientational order of rod-shaped and disk-shaped rigid cores, respectively.

==Examples==
Figure 1 – Organization of rod-like and disk-like rigid cores in liquid crystal phases of mesogens, where Iso is the isotropic liquid state; N is the nematic phase of the liquid crystal state; SmA is the smectic A phase; SmC is the smectic C phase; and Col is the columnar phase.

Thermotropic mesogens are liquid crystals that are induced by temperature and there are two classical types, which include discotic mesogens and calamitic mesogens.

Discotic mesogens contain a disk-shaped rigid core and tend to organize in columns, forming columnar liquid crystal phases (Col) of long range positional order.

An example of a discotic mesogen type rigid core is a triphenylene based disk molecule, where the hexagonal columnar liquid crystal phase exists between 66 °C (crystal) and 122 °C (isotropic liquid phase).

Calamitic mesogens contain a rod-shaped rigid core and tend to organize in distinctive layers, forming lamellar or smectic liquid crystal phases (Sm) of long range positional order. Low-order smectic phases include smectic A (SmA) and smectic C (SmC) phases, while higher ordered smectic phases include smectic B, I, F, G and H (SmB/I/F/G/H) phases.

An example of a calamitic mesogen type rigid core is a benzyl cyanide based rod molecule, where the smectic A liquid crystal phase exists between the 60 °C (crystal) and 62 °C (isotropic liquid phase) temperature range.

Bent-rod mesogens are special calamitic mesogens that contain a nonlinear rod-shaped or bent- rod shaped rigid core and organize to form &quot;banana-phases&quot;. The rigid units of these phases pack in a way so that the highest density and polar order are achieved, typically with the apex of the bent rod pointing in one direction. When a layer of bent-rods points in the same polar direction as its adjacent layers the lamellar organization is known as the smectic PF (SmPF) phase, where the F subscript indicates ferroelectric switching. Smectic PA (SmPA) is the term given to a layer of bent-rods that points in the opposite polar direction as its neighbouring layers, where A stands for antiferroelectic switching.

Other variations of bent-rod liquid crystal phases include: antiferroelectric/ferroelectric smectic C (SmCPA/SmCPF) phases and antiferroelectric/ferroelectric smectic A (SmAPA/SmAPF) phases, which have distinctive tilt and orthogonal modes of lamellar organization.

NIST SP 800-101 Rev. 1 and NIST Computer Security Resource Center Glossary state that, &quot;A UICC may be referred to as a SIM, USIM, RUIM or CSIM, and is used interchangeably with those terms&quot;, though this is an over-simplification. The primary component of a UICC is a SIM card.

== Design ==
A UICC consists of a CPU, ROM, RAM, EEPROM and I/O circuits. Early versions consisted of the whole full-size (85 × 54 mm, ISO/IEC 7810 ID-1) smart card. Soon the race for smaller telephones called for a smaller version of the card. The card was cropped down to 25 × 15 mm (ISO/IEC 7810 ID-000), as illustrated.

== 2G versus 3G ==

In 2G networks, the SIM card and SIM application were bound together, so that &quot;SIM card&quot; could mean the physical card, or any physical card with the SIM application.

In a GSM network, the UICC contains a SIM application and in a UMTS network, it contains a USIM application. A UICC may contain several applications, making it possible for the same smart card to give access to both GSM and UMTS networks, and also provide storage of a phone book and other applications. It is also possible to access a GSM network using a USIM application and it is possible to access UMTS networks using a SIM application with mobile terminals prepared for this. With the UMTS release 5 a new application, the IP multimedia Services Identity Module (ISIM) is required for services in the IMS. The telephone book is a separate application and not part of either subscriber identity module.

In a cdmaOne/CDMA2000 (&quot;CDMA&quot;) network, the UICC contains a CSIM application, in addition to 3GPP USIM and SIM applications. A card with all 3 features is called a removable user identity card, or R-UIM. Thus, the R-UIM card can be inserted into CDMA, GSM, or UMTS handsets, and will work in all three cases.

In 3G networks, it is a mistake to speak of a USIM, CSIM, or SIM card, as all three are applications running on a UICC card.

== Usage ==

Since the card slot is standardized, a subscriber can easily move their wireless account and phone number from one handset to another. This will also transfer their phone book and text messages. Similarly, usually a subscriber can change carriers by inserting a new carrier&#x27;s UICC card into their existing handset. However, it is not always possible because some carriers (e.g., in U.S.) &quot;SIM-lock&quot; the phones that they sell, preventing rival carriers&#x27; cards from being used.

The use and content of the card can be protected by use of PIN codes. One code, PIN1, can be defined to control normal use of the phone. Another code, PIN2, can be set, to allow the use of special functions (like limiting outbound telephone calls to a list of numbers). PUK1 and PUK2 is used to reset PIN1 and PIN2 respectively.

The integration of the ETSI framework and the Application management framework of GlobalPlatform is standardized in the UICC configuration.

<text>The Marconi scandal was a British political scandal that broke in mid-1912. Allegations were made that highly placed members of the Liberal government under the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith had profited by improper use of information about the government&#x27;s intentions with respect to the Marconi Company. They had known that the government was about to issue a lucrative contract to the British Marconi company for the Imperial Wireless Chain and had bought shares in an American subsidiary.

==Insider trading allegations==

Allegations and rumours about insider trading in Marconi shares involved a number of government ministers, including Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer; Sir Rufus Isaacs, the Attorney General; Herbert Samuel, the Postmaster General; and Alexander Murray, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury. The allegations were based on the fact that Isaacs&#x27; brother, Godfrey Isaacs, was managing director of Marconi.

Historians have explored the role of antisemitism in motivating the allegations. The allegations, whether true or not, were well-founded and serious enough to be brought to public attention. Particularly active in the attack was the &quot;New Witness&quot;, edited by Cecil Chesterton. This was a distributist publication founded in 1911 by Hilaire Belloc as &quot;Eye-Witness&quot;, with Cecil&#x27;s brother G. K. Chesterton on the editorial staff. It had a Catholic perspective and was accused of antisemitism.

In February 1913, the French newspaper &quot;Le Matin&quot; alleged that Sir Rufus Isaacs and Herbert Samuel had abused their position to buy shares in the &quot;English&quot; Marconi company. Both men sued for libel and &quot;Le Matin&quot; withdrew and apologised. During the case, Isaacs testified that he had bought shares in &quot;American&quot; Marconi and sold some on to Lloyd George and Lord Murray. It was not made public during the trial that these shares had been made available through Isaacs&#x27;s brother at a favourable price. The factual matters were at least partly resolved by a parliamentary select committee investigation, which issued three reports: all found that ministers had purchased shares in the American Marconi company, but while the Liberal members of the committee cleared the ministers of all blame, the other members reported that they had acted with &quot;grave impropriety&quot;. The truth of the matter has been described as &quot;obscure&quot;.

==Court case==
Cecil Chesterton expected to be sued by the government ministers under the libel laws, which put the burden of proof on the defendant. Instead, Godfrey Isaacs, Marconi&#x27;s director, brought a criminal libel action against him. &quot;The New Age&quot; (12 June 1913) described the trial

The court ruled against Chesterton and fined him a token £100 plus costs, which was paid by his supporters. Some of them claimed the decision would have gone differently had Chesterton&#x27;s lawyer aggressively gone after the accused ministers who were at the heart of the scandal. In the next issue of the &quot;New Witness&quot;, Chesterton repeated his allegations against the ministers, who still did not sue.

==Aftermath==
The events were satirised by George Bernard Shaw as the &quot;macaroni shares&quot; scandal in his play &quot;The Music Cure&quot;, which was written to accompany G. K. Chesterton&#x27;s play &quot;Magic&quot;, an attack on deceptive mediums which also referred to the scandal. In 1919, Cecil Chesterton&#x27;s &quot;A History of the United States&quot; was published, posthumously. In the introduction, his brother G. K. Chesterton wrote this about him

In her biography of G. K. Chesterton, Maisie Ward devotes a chapter to the scandal and notes, &quot;Four days after the verdict against Cecil Chesterton, the Parliamentary Committee produced its report&quot;. She goes on to describe that report: &quot;By the usual party vote of 8 to 6, it adopted a report prepared by Mr. Falconer (one of the two whom Rufus Isaacs had approached privately) which simply took the line that the Ministers had acted in good faith and refrained from criticizing them&quot;. She concludes the chapter with these words, which suggest that, at the very best, the ministers involved lacked judgment,

==Views==
The historian Ian Christopher Fletcher wrote:

In 1936, G. K. Chesterton credited the Marconi scandal with initiating a subtle but important shift in the attitude of the British public:

Bryan Cheyette argues that the negative &#x27;Jewish financier&#x27; stereotype was present first and indeed was established in British culture quite some time before the scandal broke.

==Portrayal in media==
Season 2 of the television show &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; included the Marconi scandal as a plot point. Lavinia revealed that she gave information about illegal share dealing to Sir Richard Carlisle.

<text>Gampopa Sönam Rinchen (, 1079–1153) was the main student of Milarepa, and a Tibetan Buddhist master who codified his own master&#x27;s ascetic teachings, which form the foundation of the Kagyu educational tradition. Gampopa was also a doctor and tantric master. He authored the first Lamrim text, &quot;Jewel Ornament of Liberation,&quot; and founded the Dagpo Kagyu school. He is also known as Dvagpopa, and by the titles &quot;Dakpo Lharjé&quot; &quot;the physician from Dakpo&quot; () and &quot;Daö Zhönnu&quot;, &quot;Candraprabhakumara&quot; ().

==Biography==
Gampopa was born in the Nyal (or Nyel) district, Central Tibet and from an early age was a student of medicine in the Indian, Chinese and Tibetan medical traditions. Later in his life he moved to the region of Dakpo (&quot;dwags po&quot;) in southern Tibet and hence was also called Dakpopa (&quot;dwags po pa&quot;), the man from Dakpo. The region is also near Gampo Hills, hence his other name, Gampopa. In his youth Gampopa studied under the Nyingma lama Barey as well as under the Kadampa teacher Geshe Yontan Drag. He married a daughter of a man named Chim Jose Darma Wo (&quot;mchims jo sras dar ma &#x27;od&quot;) and had a child, but they both died, causing him to renounce the householder&#x27;s life. In 1104, at the age of twenty-five he took ordination, either in Dakpo or in Penyul, at Gyachak Ri monastery (&quot;&#x27;phan yul rgya lcags ri&quot;), receiving the name Sönam Rinchen (&quot;bsod nams rin chen&quot;).&quot; After becoming a monk in the Kadampa lineage under Geshe Lodan Sherab and focused on studying the Kadampa teachings. In his 30s he sought out and became the foremost student of the yogi Milarepa. Milarepa instructed him in the practice of Vajravārahī, &quot;tummo&quot; (&quot;gtum mo&quot;) and Mahāmudrā. 

Gampopa&#x27;s position in the transmission lineage of the Mahamudra teaching is as follows:
# Tilopa (988-1069), the Indian yogi who experienced the original transmission of the Mahamudra
# Naropa (1016–1100), who perfected the methods of accelerated enlightenment described in his Six Yogas of Naropa.
# Marpa (1012–1097), the first Tibetan in the lineage, who translated the Vajrayana and Mahamudra texts into Old Tibetan
# Milarepa (1040–1123), poet and master who overcame Marpa&#x27;s reluctance to teach but nonetheless attained enlightenment in a single lifetime
# Gampopa, Milarepa&#x27;s most important student, who integrated Atiśa&#x27;s Kadam teachings and Tilopa&#x27;s Mahamudra teaching to establish the Kagyü lineage

This lineage sequence, taken together, is called the &quot;Five Founding Masters&quot; by the Kagyu school.

After his studies with Milarepa, Gampopa founded Daklha Gampo Monastery (&quot;Dwags lha sgam po&quot;) in 1121 CE. He had many great students who were accomplished tantric practitioners, both monks and laymen. Gampopa&#x27;s teaching joined the Lamrim teachings of the Kadampa school with the Mahamudra and tantric teachings of the Kagyu school. According to Tony Duff, he taught Mahamudra in two approaches, &quot;one is a gradual approach called the Four Yogas of Mahamudra, the other is a sudden approach called Essence Mahamudra.&quot;

==Dagpo Kagyu Lineages==
Gampopa taught extensively, and attracted many students. He is the source of the major surviving Kagyu sub-schools, all known as the &quot;Dagpo Kagyu&quot;. Following Gampopa, there evolved the so-called &quot;Four Major and Eight Minor&quot; lineages of the Dagpo (sometimes rendered &quot;Tagpo&quot; or &quot;Dakpo&quot;) Kagyu School. This phrase is descriptive of the generation or order in which the schools were founded, not of their importance. The four &quot;major&quot; Kagyu schools were those of:

* Barom Kagyu founded by Barompa Darma Wangchug (1127-1194?)
* Phagdru Kagyu founded by Phagmo Drupa Dorje Gyalpo (1110-1170)
* Karma Kagyu, founded by Düsum Khyenpa, 1st Karmapa Lama (1110-1193)
* Tsalpa Kagyu founded by Zhang Yudragpa Tsondru Drag (1123-1193)

The succession of Gampopa&#x27;s own monastery passed to his nephew, Dakgom Tsültrim Nyingpo (, 1116-1169).

==Teachings==
Gampopa&#x27;s most famous teaching is known as &quot;The Four Dharmas of Gampopa&quot;, this is outlined, for example, in a key text of Gampopa called &quot;The Four Dharmas in Brief&quot;:&quot;It is necessary for: dharma to turn to dharma; dharma to turn into the path; the path to dispel confusion; and confusion to turn into wisdom&quot;&quot;The Four Dharmas in Brief&quot; further states about each of the four Dharmas:

(1) Dharma to turn to dharma means to meditate on impermanence, the fact that all things will be left behind at death and that only Dharma is of use, all must be renounced except Dharma.

(2) Dharma turns into the path is explained as:if there is the rational mind of loving kindness and compassion that cherishes other more than oneself-the fictional enlightenment mind-and then on top of that the understanding that all phenomena, outer and inner, appearing as the coming together of interdependency are illusory, then the primal dharma turns into the path.(3) The Path is to be used to dispel confusion means that &quot;confusion has to be dispelled from top to bottom&quot;, Gampopa explains this as follows:First, meditation on impermanence dispels the confusion of clinging to this life, then meditation on karma and effect dispels the confusion of bad views, then meditation on the disadvantages of cyclic existence dispels the confusion of attachment to cyclic existence, then meditation on loving kindness and compassion dispels the confusion of the Lesser Vehicle, then meditation on appearances being dream-like, illusory, dispels the confusion of grasping at conceived-of things...(4) Confusion turns into wisdom:If, the force of meditation done on all phenomena being free from birth and cessation in superfact (paramartha satya) causes whatever appears, whatever is known, to be resolved as its own entity, then confusion has dawned as wisdom.The doctrine is the subject of several further short texts found in Gampopa&#x27;s collected works and numerous commentaries by later authors. It also has a close connection to Sachen Kunga Nyingpo&#x27;s &quot;Parting from the Four Attachments&quot;.

==Works==
Gampopa&#x27;s collected works (known as the &quot;Dags po&#x27;i Bka&#x27; &#x27;bum&quot;) were published in Dvag Lha Gampo monastery, but that edition has been lost. There are three main editions extant today:

* An edition made in Hemis Monastery, Ladhak, in the nineteenth century; 
* A copy of the above, published in February 1982, in India; 
* The Derge wood block edition.

Gampopa&#x27;s &quot;The Jewel Ornament of Liberation&quot; () is one of his most important works, it has been translated into English, first by Herbert Guenther in 1959 and again by Khenpo Konchok Gyeltsen in 1998.

<text>The Marconi Company was a British telecommunications and engineering company founded by Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi in 1897 which was a pioneer of wireless long distance communication and mass media broadcasting, eventually becoming one of the UK&#x27;s most successful manufacturing companies.

Its roots were in the Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company, which underwent several changes in name after mergers and acquisitions. In 1999, its defence equipment manufacturing division, Marconi Electronic Systems, merged with British Aerospace (BAe) to form BAE Systems. In 2006, financial difficulties led to the collapse of the remaining company, with the bulk of the business acquired by the Swedish telecommunications company, Ericsson.

==History==

===Naming history===
*1897–1900: The Wireless Telegraph &amp; Signal Company
*1900–1963: Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company
*1963–1987: Marconi Company Ltd
*1987–1998: GEC-Marconi Ltd
*1998–1999: Marconi Electronic Systems Ltd
*1999–2003: Marconi plc, with Marconi Communications as principal subsidiary
*2003–2006: Marconi Corporation plc

===Early history===

Marconi&#x27;s &quot;Wireless Telegraph and Signal Company&quot; was formed on 20 July 1897 after a British patent for wireless technology was granted on 2 July that year. The company opened the world&#x27;s first radio factory on Hall Street in Chelmsford northeast of London in 1898 and was responsible for some of the most important advances in radio and television. These include:

* The diode vacuum tube in 1904 (Fleming)
* Transatlantic radio broadcasting between Clifden, Ireland and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, October 17, 1907.
* High frequency tuned broadcasting
* Formation of the British Broadcasting Company (later to become the independent BBC)
* Formation of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America (assets acquired by RCA in 1920)
* Marconi International Marine Communication Co. (M.I.M.C.Co.), founded 1900 in London 
* Compagnie de Télégraphie sans Fil (C.T.S.F.), founded 1900 in the City of Brussels 
* Short wave beam broadcasting
* Radar
* Television
* Avionics

The subsidiary Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America, also called &quot;American Marconi&quot;, was founded in 1899. It was the dominant radio communications provider in the US until the formation of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1919.

In 1900 the company&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company&quot; and Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Training College was established in 1901. The company and factory was moved to New Street Works in 1912 to allow for production expansion in light of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. Along with private entrepreneurs, Marconi company formed in 1924 the &quot;Unione Radiofonica Italiana&quot; (URI), which was granted by Mussolini&#x27;s regime a monopoly of radio broadcasts in 1924. After the war, URI became the RAI, which lives on to this day.

Isaac Shoenberg joined the company in 1914 and became joint general manager in 1924. After leaving Marconi in 1928 he went on to lead research at EMI where he was influential in the development of television broadcasting. 

In 1939, the Marconi Research Laboratories were founded at Great Baddow, Essex. In 1941 there was a buyout of Marconi-Ekco Instruments to form Marconi Instruments.

===Operations as English Electric subsidiary===

English Electric acquired the Marconi Company in 1946 to complement its other operations: heavy electrical engineering, aircraft manufacture and its railway traction business. In 1948 the company was reorganised into four divisions: Communications, Broadcasting, Aeronautics and Radar. These had expanded to 13 manufacturing divisions by 1965 when a further reorganisation took place. The divisions were placed into three groups: Telecommunications, Components and Electronics.

At this time the Marconi Company had facilities at New Street Chelmsford, Baddow, Basildon, Billericay, and Writtle as well as in Wembley, Gateshead and Hackbridge. It also owned Marconi Instruments, Sanders Electronics, Eddystone Radio and Marconi Italiana (based in Genoa, Italy). In 1967 Marconi took over Stratton and Company to form Eddystone Radio.

===Expansion in Canada===
In 1903, Marconi founded the Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada which was renamed as the Canadian Marconi Company in 1925. The radio business of the Canadian Marconi Company is known as Ultra Electronics TCS since 2002 and its avionic activities as CMC Electronics, owned by Esterline since 2007.

===Expansion as GEC subsidiary===
In 1967 or 1968, English Electric was subject to a takeover bid by the Plessey Company but chose instead to accept an offer from the General Electric Company (GEC). Under UK government pressure, the computer section of GEC, English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM), merged with International Computers and Tabulators (ICT) to form International Computers Limited (ICL). The computer interests of Elliott Automation which specialised in real-time computing were amalgamated with those of Marconi&#x27;s Automation Division to form Marconi-Elliott Computers, later renamed as GEC Computers. In 1968 Marconi Space and Defence Systems and Marconi Underwater Systems were formed.

The Marconi Company continued as the primary defence subsidiary of GEC, GEC-Marconi. Marconi was renamed GEC-Marconi in 1987. During the period 1968–1999 GEC-Marconi/MES underwent significant expansion.

Acquisitions which were folded into the company and partnerships established included:
*Defence operations of Associated Electrical Industries in 1968, AEI had been acquired in 1967.
*Yarrow Shipbuilders in 1985
*Ferranti defence businesses in 1990
*Ferranti Dynamics in 1992
*Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering in 1995
*Alenia Marconi Systems in 1998, a defence electronics company and an equal shares joint venture between GEC-Marconi and Finmeccanica&#x27;s Alenia Difesa.
*Tracor in 1998.
Other acquisitions included:
*Divisions of Plessey in 1989 (others acquired by its partner in the deal, Siemens AG, to meet with regulatory approval).
**Plessey Avionics
**Plessey Naval Systems
**Plessey Cryptography
**Plessey Electronic Systems (75%)
**Sippican
**Leigh Instruments

In a major reorganisation of the company, GEC-Marconi was renamed Marconi Electronic Systems in 1996 and was separated from other non-defence assets.

==Since 1999==
In 1999, GEC was broken up and parts sold off. Marconi Electronic Systems, which included its wireless assets, was demerged and sold to British Aerospace which then formed BAE Systems. 

GEC, realigning itself as a primarily telecommunications company following the MES sale, retained the Marconi brand and renamed itself Marconi plc. BAE were granted limited rights to continue use of the Marconi name in existing partnerships, which had ceased by 2005. Major spending and the dot-com collapse led to a major restructuring of the Marconi group in 2003: in a debt-for-equity swap, shareholders retained 0.5% of the new company, Marconi Corporation plc.

In October 2005 the Swedish firm Ericsson offered to buy the Marconi name and most of the assets. The transaction was completed on 23 January 2006, effective as of 1 January 2006. The remainder of the Marconi company, with some 2,000 staff working on telecommunications infrastructure in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, was renamed Telent.

<text>Buddy the Gob is a 1934 Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon, the first directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on January 5, 1934, and stars Buddy, the second star of the series.

The theme music played at the beginning is &quot;Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean.&quot;

==Summary==
A great Navy gunboat sails toward the audience and fires her weapons; several other ships go on behind it. Buddy is a &quot;gob&quot;, a sailor onboard one of the ships, and is excited to see that they have made port in China. Jumping from the side of his ship and into a rowboat, Our Hero makes his way to land.

In the Chinese city, now, we see that a large woman carries her four children, attached by their hair to a pole straddled across her shoulders; Buddy turns a corner and sees an older gentleman expand and compress himself vertically in order to read a poster on the side of a building; when the man has left, Buddy goes to read the message, which converts, for our benefit, into English: &quot;Grand Celebration To-day: the 150th Birthday Anniversary of the Sacred Dragon: a beautiful girl will be sacrificed to the Dragon. Come one! Come all!&quot; Leaping from straw hat-to-straw hat of five men arranged from back-to-front in ascending order of height, Buddy manages to see the grand celebration: a baton wielder bounces his belly; a drum, held by two marchers, is host to six tiny people who jump upon it; in addition to trumpeters and tiny men whose hats double as cymbals, the procession happens to include a pianist! One of the masked dancers in the parade is a caricature of Jimmy Durante (a favorite target of Warner Bros. cartoons of the time.)

Then we see the young girl to be sacrificed, in her cage, carried by two marchers; she begs for help and weeps. Buddy is not about to let the ritual occur. But when he attempts to enter the temple into which the girl has been taken, he is ejected from the very steps by spear, and thus caught on a wall by the seat of his pants. Once free, Our Hero hears the girl&#x27;s screams from a window several stories above him. When his attempt at propelling himself to the window by means of the spear fails, Buddy simply picks up a piece of a gate and fires the spear-like points of it, as though they were arrows, at the wall of the prison-temple, thereby forming a series of steps up which he can easily walk to reach the girl&#x27;s holding cell.

The girl&#x27;s keeper locks her cuffs, swallows the key, and steps out of the room, leaving the girl to be terrified by the imprisoned, fire-breathing dragon across the room from her. Buddy enters, but can not seem to break the lock; so he knocks on the door, and stands aside, picking up a nearby barrel: the keeper steps inside, and Buddy slams the barrel over the villain&#x27;s head and body, dazing him. A swift kick in the pants, and the jailer coughs up the key. The brave little sailor frees the girl, but no sooner does he that than the bars entrapping the dragon rise and free the beast. At Buddy&#x27;s direction, the girl leaps from the window to a waiting rickshaw beneath: Buddy, after enduring the dragon&#x27;s flame on his behind, follows.

As the vehicle speedily makes away, a throng of angry, spear-wielding people notice that their sacrifice is escaping! When their rickshaw breaks upon hitting a rock, the driver himself becomes the escape vehicle, off of which Buddy and the girl get, preferring to run. They come to a bridge of wooden planks, suspended by ropes tied to stakes. Once on the bridge, Buddy, the rescued girl at his side, severs the ropes with a saw; the two run across as the bridge just as surely as it falls, plank-by-plank, behind them. From one side of the valley, the angry people helplessly protest the escape as Buddy and the girl tease their pursuers. One such pursuer hurls his spear all the way across; dodging this, the two continue to tease, but the spear, imbued with malevolent life, turns about and pricks Buddy&#x27;s rear end before falling, lifeless, to the ground. A victorious but dazed Buddy stares into the camera as the cartoon ends.

==Footage reused==
The opening scene, in which the ship sails towards the camera and fires her guns, is recycled for a cinematic sequence in 1935&#x27;s &quot;Buddy&#x27;s Theatre&quot;.
Also the Mice play Yankee Doodle of the Drums was reused from &quot;It&#x27;s Got Me Again!&quot;.

<text>Those Were Wonderful Days is a Merrie Melodies cartoon released in theaters on April 26, 1934 by Warner Bros. Studios. The film was supervised by Bernard B. Brown. The sound was recorded by him in the uncredited. The characters were animated by Paul Smith and Don Williams. The musical score was by Norman Spencer.

==Plot==
Set in 1898, the cartoon offers a nostalgic look at the United States at the turn of the century. It starts with a barbershop quartet, composed of four men with handlebar moustaches who play old-fashioned music on found objects, leading up to the annual Fourth of July celebration at the local fairground, where a hero and villain fight for the heart of a woman.

The original “So Long Folks” sequence was thought to have been missing due to a splice between an airing of &quot;Honeymoon Hotel&quot; which features that short&#x27;s closing sequence. The original short, except for the titles, was found on a Nickelodeon &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; airing from 1990. However, a restored print with the correct closing sequence was featured in a 2021 episode of MeTV&#x27;s classic animation series &quot;Toon In with Me&quot;.

<text>Buddy and Towser is a 1934 American Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The cartoon was released on February 24, 1934, and features Buddy, the second star of the series.

==Summary==
Buddy enlists his dog, Towser, to guard his award-winning chickens. A fox penetrates Buddy&#x27;s property as Towser and Buddy sleep, but the chickens, initially, are able to repel the fox by throwing their eggs at it. In its escape, the fox awakens Towser, who proceeds to bark, awakening his owner, and chase the fox.

Towser is joined in the chase by Buddy, who now wields a shotgun (that he is humorously unable to handle.) Eventually, Buddy and Towser run up a snowy hill after the fox, which then crashes into a tree, tumbles backwards, and finds itself trapped in an increasingly large snowball, which soon envelops Towser and Buddy. At the foot of the hill, the snowball breaks apart on impact with a shed, leaving Buddy, Towser, and the fox momentarily dazed.

Coming to their senses, Buddy and Towser each take a plank of wood and aim to hit the fox, which sits between them; but the fox comes to and scurries away, leaving Buddy to accidentally whack Towser, and vice versa, as the cartoon ends.

<doc id="1160956" wikidata="Q1006184" url="?curid=1160956" title="List of Wazamono">
<text>is a Japanese term that, in a literal sense, refers to an instrument that plays as it should; in the context of Japanese swords and sword collecting, &quot;wazamono&quot; denotes any sword with a sharp edge that has been tested to cut well, usually by professional sword appraisers via the art of &quot;tameshigiri&quot; (test cutting).

The term &quot;wazamono&quot; has been popularized by two books published during the late Edo period. The first is called , a single-volume authoritative index classifying historic Japanese swordsmiths based on the quality (cutting performance) of their blades; the book&#x27;s first edition was compiled and published in 1797, with re-publishings made in 1805 and 1815 due to the book&#x27;s popularity. The contents, written and edited by , a samurai of the Karatsu Domain in Hizen Province, were based on the recorded cutting tests done by , an executioner of the Tokugawa Shogunate and fifth head of the famous line of sword testers; single cuts were performed on the corpses of executed criminals aged 30 to 50, cutting their torsos roughly above nipple height.

The &quot;Kaihō Kenjaku&quot; identified, in total, 163 (228 if counting the &quot;mixed&quot; category) &quot;wazamono&quot; swordsmiths, grouped into four based on the cutting performance of their blades:
* — the highest grade, which counted 12 swordsmiths whose swords could cut through torsos 8–9 out of 10 times;
* — the second-highest grade, counting 21 swordsmiths whose swords could cut through torsos 7–8 out of 10 times;
* — the third-highest grade, counting 50 swordsmiths whose swords could cut through torsos 5–7 out of 10 times;
* — the fourth and lowest grade, counting 80 swordsmiths whose swords could cut through torsos 3–4 out of 10 times.
The category included 65 additional swordsmiths noted for having swords of mixed quality/sharpness level (&quot;Ōwazamono&quot;, &quot;Yoki-/Ryōwazamono&quot;, &quot;Wazamono&quot;).

The 1805 and 1815 re-publishings of &quot;Kaihō Kenjaku&quot; saw adjustments be made to the rankings. In 1830, a second book, called , was published as a major revised list of the &quot;wazamono&quot; ratings. This new list yet again made amends to the original, and new sword makers were added, such that there were now 15 sword makers in the &quot;Saijō Ōwazamono&quot; (Supreme) category, 21 in the &quot;Ōwazamono&quot; (Excellent) category, 58 in the &quot;Yokiwazamono&quot; (Very Good) category, 93 in the &quot;Wazamono&quot; (Good) category, and 68 in the mixed category, for a total of 255 swords. This time, the cutting tests had been conducted by the 7th head of the Yamada family lineage, .

The &quot;katana&quot; forged by Nagasone Kotetsu, one of the top-rated swordsmiths, became very popular at the time when the books were published, and many counterfeits were made. Furthermore, the swordsmiths treated specially in the &quot;Kyōhō Meibutsu-chō&quot; (a catalogue of excellent swords in the collections of &quot;daimyō&quot; from the Kyōhō era) and Muramasa (famous at that time for forging swords of high cutting ability) were omitted from the listings. The reasons are thought to be that Yamada was afraid of challenging the authority of the &quot;shōgun&quot;, that he could not use precious swords possessed by the &quot;daimyō&quot; in the examination, and that he was considerate of the legend of Muramasa&#x27;s curse.

A misconception about the &quot;wazamono&quot; classification is that it is a sword ranking, since the term &quot;wazamono&quot; itself refers to swords; however, the grades pertain to swordsmiths, graded according to the cutting ability of their blades. See the below list of the swordsmiths listed in the &quot;Kaihō Kenjaku&quot;.

==Twelve (12) &quot;Saijō Ōwazamono&quot;==
The original list of 12 swordsmiths who, based on the cutting ability of their blades, hold the highest rank of Saijō Ōwazamono (Supreme Grade):

* = , AKA 
* =

==In popular culture==
In the hit manga &quot;One Piece&quot;, so-called are prominently featured: bladed weapons (usually but not strictly swords) forged by master craftsmen and wielded by powerful pirates and marines alike. The finest of these fall into a &quot;Wazamono&quot; grading system, classifying them into four grades that are directly inspired by those defined in the Japanese &quot;Kaihō Kenjaku&quot; (although notably ranking the swords themselves, rather than their smiths). Namely, there are 12 &quot;Saijō Ōwazamono&quot; blades, 21 &quot;Ōwazamono&quot; blades, 50 &quot;Ryōwazamono&quot; blades, and an unknown number of low-ranking &quot;Wazamono&quot; blades. One of the main characters, Roronoa Zoro, is notable for wielding three &quot;Wazamono&quot; swords at all times.

<text>Mrityudaata (: Angel of Death) is a 1997 Indian Hindi-language action drama film directed by Mehul Kumar with music by Anand Milind. The film is considered to be a comeback role for Amitabh Bachchan, who temporarily left the industry in 1992. This film was produced by his own production company called Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Limited (ABCL). It marked Bachchan&#x27;s comeback after five years but was a box-office bomb. One of the songs in the film picturized on Amitabh and Daler Mehndi was very popular when released.

== Plot ==
Dr. Ram Prasad Ghayal is a renowned doctor who has been successful in all operations in his career and has skillfully operated many delicate surgeries. He lives with his wife Janki and brother Bharat (Arbaaz Ali Khan). Bharat is in love with Renu, the daughter of Umeshchan Jain. At the same time, Raja Tunga, the brother of Rana Tunga has a longing for Renu. The miscreant Raja with his mob severely assaults Bharat when Bharat resists Raja&#x27;s advances toward Renu.

A corrupt minister Mohanlal wants to execute a disastrous scheme called the &quot;Pawanghat Power Project&quot; at the expense of the lives and property of the tribes living at the project site. He coaxes and later threatens Bharat, the concerned engineer to sign his approval for the project, whereas Bharat refuses to endorse such a scheme. On the other hand, Rana devises an evil plot against Bharat to wipe the latter out eventually leading to his brother Raja winning Renu. Bharat is framed for murdering a woman and Inspector Danapani, a subordinate of Rana, arrests him and puts him behind bars. Woefully, Bharat dies in jail presumably by committing suicide. The agony of Bharat&#x27;s death claims the life of Janki as well. With the death of his beloved wife and brother, Dr. Ram becomes desolate and alcoholic. Renu marries Raja, without any regret for the death of her former lover.

Now that Bharat is dead, Mohanlal conspires with Rana for the implementation of the power project. However, they end up becoming enemies of each other. Mohanlal plans to kill Raja. His henchmen attack Raja who is critically injured. Raja is admitted to the hospital where Dr. Ram is to conduct his operation. Renu fears that Dr. Ram may kill Raja to take vengeance for the death of his brother. She refuses to sign the operation papers, but Dr. Ram, who considers it his moral duty to save the life of a patient regardless of them being his friend or foe, conducts the operation. His expertise pays off as Raja is saved. He goes out to convey the news to Renu but returns to find Raja dead, beyond all his expectations. Renu files an F.I.R. against Dr. Ram, who is arrested and imprisoned.

In jail, Dr. Ram meets an inmate bearing the number 92, Prof Nizamuddin Azad, a scientist of &quot;Bharat Atomic Energy&quot;. He has been jailed after a false allegation of revealing confidential nuclear formulae to foreign nations. He tells Dr. Ram that his brother Bharat did not commit suicide, but was tortured to death by Insp. Danapani, which he witnessed. Dr. Ram now realizes that his past misfortune was a result of the evil motives of some antagonists of the nation. He becomes the Angel of Death (Mrityudaata), who will put all those malefactors to death.

Dr. Ram breaks away from jail and nabs Insp. Danapani says that Mohanlal planned the murder of Bharat using his influence over the police. He also says that Raja was killed by Dr. Siddiqui (Avtar Gill) by cutting off the oxygen supply after Mohanlal bribed him to kill Raja. Dr. Ram kicks Danapani off the building to his death.

Meanwhile, Mohanlal has allied with another influential politician, Trilochan Tripathi, a.k.a. TT or Terror of Terrors, who keeps up an honest appearance among the masses, but works for his interests at the cost of the welfare of the public. Dr. Ram corners Dr. Siddiqui on the roof of Umeshchan Jain&#x27;s house, who confesses to killing Raja and accepting a bribe from Mohanlal. Dr. Ram captures a video of Dr. Siddiqui&#x27;s revelation before putting him to death. Soon, Dr. Ram kills Mohanlal.

One day, Trilochan Tripathi addresses a gathering when Dr. Ram publicly puts a video on view in which Tripathi signs an agreement with a foreign syndicate related to the &quot;Pawanghat Power Project&quot;. Later, Tripathi would fool the public with false promises of power distribution. The enraged crowd chases Tripathi through the streets when Rana arrives for his rescue. Rana fires at Dr. Ram who burns Rana and Tripathi to death.

The film ends with Dr. Ram succumbing to his injuries.

<text>Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC) is an information security certification entity that specializes in technical and practical certification as well as new research in the form of its GIAC Gold program. SANS Institute founded the certification entity in 1999 and the term GIAC is trademarked by The Escal Institute of Advanced Technologies.

GIAC provides a set of vendor-neutral computer security certifications linked to the training courses provided by the SANS. GIAC is specific to the leading edge technological advancement of IT security in order to keep ahead of &quot;black hat&quot; techniques. Papers written by individuals pursuing GIAC certifications are presented at the SANS Reading Room on GIAC&#x27;s website.

Initially all SANS GIAC certifications required a written paper or &quot;practical&quot; on a specific area of the certification in order to achieve the certification. In April 2005, the SANS organization changed the format of the certification by breaking it into two separate levels. The &quot;silver&quot; level certification is achieved upon completion of a multiple choice exam. The &quot;gold&quot; level certification can be obtained by completing a research paper and has the silver level as a prerequisite.

As of August 27, 2022, GIAC has granted 173,822 certifications worldwide.

<text>William Forwood (born 21 October 1946) was an Australian politician. He was the Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1992 to 2006, representing Templestowe Province.

Forwood is now Strategic Counsel for CPR Communications and Public Relations.

== Origins ==

Forwood was born in Adelaide, and began his high school education there, but graduated from the prestigious Geelong Grammar School in Victoria. He studied at the University of Melbourne, and briefly became a journalist with the Herald and Weekly Times. He quickly changed careers however, becoming a manager at a grocery company for several years.

In 1975, Forwood moved to Canberra to work as a public servant. The following year, however, he again changed careers, moving to South Australia to work as a farmer. He returned to a business career in 1980, taking on a position as a merchant banker, and over the next twelve years, worked in a variety of management positions, including being Finance Director of the Victorian Liberal Party.

During the 1980s, Forwood also spent a two-year stint as one of two vice-presidents of the Northern Territory&#x27;s Country Liberal Party. His stint in this role, shared with future Chief Minister Shane Stone, coincided with the ousting of Chief Minister Ian Tuxworth and the creation of the rival Northern Territory Nationals party, leaving them among those tasked with reuniting a fractured party organisation in its aftermath in 1986–87.

== Legislative Council ==

Forwood won pre-selection for the Legislative Council seat of Templestowe Province at the 1992 election, by defeating a low-profile sitting Liberal MLC, John Miles, and went on to win the seat. In his early years in office, he served stints on the Law Reform and Legislative Council Privileges Committees. In 1996, he was appointed as Chair of the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee, before receiving his first ministerial appointment in 1998, when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier. This was to be relatively short-lived, however, as Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett was defeated in a surprise result the following year.

After the election loss, Forwood was promoted to Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, Shadow Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, and Shadow Minister for Tourism. He also continued in his work with the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee - albeit as Deputy Chairman. In 2000, he gained the portfolio of Rural and Regional Development at the expense of Aboriginal Affairs. In 2001, Forwood found himself promoted again, as he succeeded Mark Birrell as Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, and was also made Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations.

The Liberal Party had not been tipped to win the 2002 election, but it became one of the worst results in the party&#x27;s history, losing an array of seats, including several Shadow Ministers. Forwood was not up for re-election, but he was nevertheless a casualty of the election - in the aftermath of the devastating result, he was dumped as Leader in the Legislative Council in favor of Philip Davis, and also lost the Industrial Relations portfolio. After a brief spell as Shadow Minister for Conservation and Environment, he gained the portfolios of Energy Industries (since renamed to Resources and Energy) and WorkCover in 2002.

In addition to his shadow ministerial portfolios, Forwood was the Deputy Chair of the Public Accounts and Estimates Committee, and sat on the Legislative Council Privileges Committee.

Forwood retired at the 2006 state election.

<text>Michael Anthony Dorris (January 30, 1945 – April 10, 1997) was an American novelist and scholar who was the first Chair of the Native American Studies program at Dartmouth College. His works include the novel &quot;A Yellow Raft in Blue Water&quot; (1987) and the memoir &quot;The Broken Cord&quot; (1989).

&quot;The Broken Cord&quot;, which won the 1989 National Book Critics Circle Award for General Nonfiction, was about dealing with his adopted son, who had fetal alcohol syndrome, and the widespread damage among children born with this problem. The work helped provoke Congress to approve legislation to warn of the dangers of drinking alcohol during pregnancy.

He was married to author Louise Erdrich, and the two had a family of six children. They collaborated in some of their writing. They separated in 1995, and then divorced in 1996. He killed himself in 1997 while police were investigating allegations that he had sexually abused his daughters.

==Biography==

Michael Dorris was born in Louisville, Kentucky to Mary Besy (née Burkhardt) and Jim Dorris. (The senior Dorris was later reported as mixed race, with a Native American father.) His father died before Dorris was born (reportedly by suicide during WWII). Dorris was raised as an only child by his mother, who became a secretary for the Democratic Party. Two maternal relatives reportedly also helped raise him, either two aunts, or an aunt and his maternal grandmother. In his youth, he spent summers with his father&#x27;s relatives on reservations in Montana and Washington state. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that he was raised in part by a stepfather.

In an article published in &quot;New York Magazine&quot; two months after Dorris&#x27; death, a reporter quoted the Modoc tribal historian as saying, &quot;Dorris was probably the descendant of a white man named Dorris whom records show befriended the Modocs on the West Coast just before and after the Modoc War of 1873. Even so, there is no record of a Dorris having been enrolled as an Indian citizen on the Klamath rolls.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported: &quot;Dorris&#x27; father&#x27;s mother, who was white, became pregnant by her Indian boyfriend, but, the times being what they were, she could not marry him. She later married a white man named Dorris.&quot;

Dorris received his BA (cum laude) in English and Classics from Georgetown University in 1967 and a Master&#x27;s degree from Yale University in anthropology in 1971, after beginning studies for a theater degree. He did his field work in Alaska, studying the effects of offshore drilling on the Native Alaskan communities. At a time of rising Native American activism, in 1972, Dorris helped form Dartmouth College&#x27;s Native American Studies department, and served as its first chair.

In 1971, he became one of the first unmarried men in the United States to adopt a child. His adopted son, a 3-year-old Lakota boy named Reynold Abel, was eventually diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome. Dorris&#x27; struggle to understand and care for his son became the subject of his 1987 memoir &quot;The Broken Cord&quot; (in which he uses the pseudonym &quot;Adam&quot; for his son). Dorris adopted two more Native American children, Jeffrey Sava in 1974 and Madeline Hannah in 1976, both of whom also likely suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome.

He wrote the text to accompany the photographs of Joseph C. Farber in the book &quot;Native Americans: Five Hundred Years After&quot; (1975). He was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1977 for his work in Anthropology &amp; Cultural Studies. In 1980, he took his three adopted children with him from Cornish, New Hampshire to New Zealand, where he had arranged a year&#x27;s sabbatical.

After returning to the United States in 1981, he married Louise Erdrich, a writer of Anishinaabe, German-American, and Métis descent. They had met 10 years earlier while he was teaching at Dartmouth and she was a student. During his sabbatical in New Zealand, Dorris and Erdrich had begun corresponding regularly by mail. After their marriage, she adopted his three children. They had three daughters together: Persia Andromeda, Pallas Antigone, and Aza Marion.

Dorris and Erdrich contributed to each other&#x27;s writing and together wrote romance fiction under the pseudonym Milou North to supplement their income. Many of the latter pieces were published in the British magazine &quot;Woman&quot;.

Erdrich dedicated her novels &quot;The Beet Queen&quot; (1986),&quot;Tracks&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Bingo Palace&quot; to Dorris. The family lived in Cornish, New Hampshire.

While teaching at Dartmouth, Dorris frequently mentored other students. He was part of the successful effort to eliminate the college&#x27;s Indian mascot. In 1985, after the couple had received major grants, the family moved for a year to Northfield, Minnesota.

Beginning in 1986, Dorris&#x27; son Sava was sent to boarding school and military school. Madeline began attending boarding school when she was 12. After the success of &quot;The Broken Cord&quot; in 1989, and an advance of $1.5 million for the outline of &quot;Crown of Columbus&quot;, Dorris quit teaching at Dartmouth to become a full-time writer. In 1991, his oldest son Reynold Abel was hit by a driver and killed. Dorris, Erdrich, and their three daughters moved to Kalispell, Montana, allegedly because of death threats Sava had made towards them. They later returned to New Hampshire in 1993. They finally moved to the Piper Mansion in Minneapolis.

Sava sent a letter to the couple in 1994 threatening to &quot;destroy their lives&quot; and demanding money. Dorris and Erdrich took Sava to court for attempted felony theft. The first jury deadlocked, and the next year Sava was acquitted of the charges.

The couple separated in 1995. Dorris went for treatment of alcohol abuse at Hazelden. Dorris and Erdrich divorced in 1996. Dorris considered himself &quot;addicted to&quot; Erdrich and fell into a depression.

==Sex abuse allegations and suicide==

Madeline and two of Dorris&#x27; biological daughters made allegations of abuse against him. In March 1997, Dorris made a suicide attempt. On April 10, 1997, he used a combination of suffocation, drugs, and alcohol to end his life in the Brick Tower Motor Inn in Concord, New Hampshire. It was later disclosed that during a therapy session, one of his daughters alleged that he had sexually abused her. In conversations with friends, Dorris maintained his innocence and his lack of faith that the legal system would exonerate him without his &quot;demolishing&quot; his wife and children in a &quot;vicious&quot; court trial. With his death, the criminal investigations into the sexual abuse allegations were closed.

==Reception==
Dorris was the author, co-author, or editor of a dozen books in the genres of fiction, memoirs and essays, and non-fiction.

His &quot;Yellow Raft in Blue Water&quot; (1987) has been named among the &quot;finest literary debuts of the late 20th century.&quot; It tells the story of three generations of women, in a non-linear fashion, from multiple perspectives, a technique that Dorris would frequently use in his later writings as well.

His memoir &quot;The Broken Cord&quot; is credited with bringing &quot;international attention to the problem of fetal alcohol syndrome&quot; (&quot;FAS&quot;). The book won a number of awards, including the Christopher Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award for general non-fiction. It is credited with inspiring Congressional legislation on FAS. It was adapted as a made-for TV film, with Jimmy Smits playing Dorris. In an essay originally published in the &quot;WicaSa Review&quot;, Elizabeth Cook-Lynn criticizes Dorris and Erdrich (who had written the foreword), claiming that they were calling for the jailing of alcoholic Native mothers during their pregnancies to forestall fetal alcohol syndrome.

When he and Erdrich co-wrote &quot;The Crown of Columbus&quot; (the only fiction they officially share credit for, although they frequently stated that they collaborated on other works), each individually wrote a preliminary draft of each section. Within the novel, various characters are writing collaborators. The work has been characterized as an autobiographical representation of the creative &quot;pleasure and problems&quot; that Dorris and Erdrich shared.

In &quot;Cloud Chamber&quot; (1997), Dorris continued the story of the families introduced in &quot;Yellow Raft in Blue Water&quot;, telling &quot;the hard story of hard people living difficult lives with much courage&quot;. It was described as written in &quot;evocative prose&quot;.

Dorris published three works for young adults during his lifetime; &quot;The Window&quot; was published posthumously. These novels also explore his themes of identity and sibling rivalry.

<text>Seven minutes in heaven (or seven minutes in the closet) is a kissing party game mostly played at teenage parties. The game may also be played with a different duration.

==Game==
Two people are selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space and do whatever they like for seven minutes. It is common for the participants to kiss or make out, but they may instead choose to talk, engage in sexual activity, or simply do nothing at all and wait for the time to expire. 

The participants can be selected by various methods, such as spinning a bottle, drawing lots, or votes.

The game has been recorded as early as 1953.

<doc id="1161012" wikidata="Q26213921" url="?curid=1161012" title="Slum clearance">
<text>Slum clearance, slum eviction or slum removal is an urban renewal strategy used to transform low-income settlements with poor reputation into another type of development or housing. This has long been a strategy for redeveloping urban communities; for example, slum clearance plans were required in the United Kingdom in the Housing Act 1930, while the Housing Acts of 1937 and 1949 encouraged similar clearance strategies in the United States. Frequently, but not always, these programs are paired with public housing or other assistance programs for the displaced communities.

==Reasons==
The concept of urban renewal and slum clearance as a method for social reform emerged in England as a reaction to the increasingly cramped and unsanitary conditions of the urban poor in the rapidly industrializing cities of the 19th century. The agenda that emerged was a progressive doctrine that assumed better housing conditions would reform residents morally and economically. Another style of reform, imposed by the state for reasons of aesthetics and efficiency, could be said to have begun in 1853, with the recruitment of Baron Haussmann by Napoleon III for the redevelopment of Paris.

Slum clearance is still practiced today in a number of different situations. During major international events like conferences and sporting competitions, governments have been known to forcefully clear low-income housing areas as a strategy to impress international visitors and reduce the visibility of the host cities&#x27; apparent poverty. Other attempts at slum clearance have occurred due to other motivations, such as repressing political opposition or attempting to keep certain communities in check.

==Consequences==
Critics argue that slum removal by force tends to ignore the social problems that cause slums. Poor families who may fall below the income threshold to afford low-income housing replacements, often families including children and working adults, need a place to live when adequate low-income housing is too expensive for them. Moreover, slums are frequently sites of informal economies that provide jobs, services, and livelihoods not otherwise available in the community. Urbanologists Matias Echanove and Rahul Srivastava argue that many aspects of slums, namely the decentralized, mixed-use, tight-knit urban environment, are assets worth nurturing. Arguing that Slum upgrading (economic integration, infrastructure assistance) is partially responsible for the rapid economic success of Tokyo. Slum clearance removes the slum, but neglecting the needs of the community or its people, does not remove the causes that create and maintain the slum. 

Similarly, plans to remove slums in several non-Western contexts have proven ineffective without sufficient housing and other support for the displaced communities. Academics describe such strategies as detrimental in Nigeria, where the slum destruction puts further stress on already short housing stock, in some cases creating new slums in other parts of the community. Zimbabwe&#x27;s Operation Murambatsvina was widely criticized by the international community, including a scathing report from the UN which noted human rights abuses alongside poor design of the program, which was estimated to displace at least 700,000 slum dwellers.

==Alternatives==
Some communities have opted for slum upgrading as an alternative solution: improving the quality of services and infrastructure to match the community developed in the slum.

<text>Sarathi (, also anglicised as Sarathy) is an epithet of the Hindu deity Krishna used in the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. It is also a common personal name in South India.

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Krishna initially counselled peace to the Pandavas and Kauravas, two closely related families that chose to fight over the Kuru kingdom in northern India. Eventually siding with the Pandavas, he offered his services as a charioteer to Arjuna, the Pandavas&#x27; greatest archer. Krishna is thus accorded the title , which translates to &quot;charioteer of Partha&quot; (another name for Arjuna), or &quot;eternal charioteer&quot;. The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, considered by many traditions to be Hinduism&#x27;s most important religious text, consists of a dialogue between Krishna, the charioteer, and Arjuna just before the actual battle begins, where Krishna instructs Arjuna in the principle of dharma in response to his hesitation to fighting against his own relatives.

== Symbolism ==
In Hinduism, as aligned with Plato&#x27;s philosophy, the dynamic interaction of persons, horses, and parts are &quot;yoked,&quot; &quot;reined,&quot; and &quot;bound&quot; together, serving as an allegory for the atman or &quot;self&quot;, and its relationship to the senses and the body.

In the Stri Parva of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Vidura explains the concept of samsara to his grieving brother Dhritarashtra by offering the metaphor of a chariot and a charioteer.

<text>Poverty Bay (Māori: &quot;Tūranganui-a-Kiwa&quot;), officially named Tūranganui-a-Kiwa / Poverty Bay, is the largest of several small bays on the east coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island to the north of Hawke Bay. It stretches for from Young Nick&#x27;s Head in the southwest to Tuaheni Point in the northeast. The city of Gisborne is located on the northern shore of the bay and the small settlement of Muriwai is located at the bay&#x27;s southern end. The name is often used by extension to refer to the entire area surrounding the city of Gisborne.

Poverty Bay is the home of the Māori iwi (tribes) Te Aitanga-a-Māhaki, Rongowhakaata and Ngāi Tāmanuhiri.

==History==
The first European known to have set foot in New Zealand, Captain James Cook of , did so here on 7 October 1769, at which time the bay was known as Teoneroa (&quot;the long beach&quot;). This first landing led to the death of local Māori man Te Maro during a skirmish with Cook&#x27;s crew. Although Cook was able to obtain some herbs to ward off scurvy, he was unable to gain many of the provisions he and his crew needed at the bay, and for this reason gave it the name &quot;Poverty Bay&quot;. Cook&#x27;s first choice of name for the inlet, before the conflict, had been &quot;Endeavour Bay&quot;, as a memorial of the ship&#x27;s first landing place in New Zealand.

Bay whaling stations operated in the bay during the 19th century.

In 1868, Te Kooti, a Māori rebel leader, and Hauhau followers were incarcerated without trial in the Chatham Islands. Te Kooti and 300 mostly Hauhau warriors overcome the crew of the schooner &quot;Rifleman&quot; and escaped, with their women and children, from the Chatham Islands to Poverty Bay. They landed at Whareongaonga Bay, near Young Nick&#x27;s Head. From there, he ventured inland to wage guerilla war on the armed constabulary and sympathetic Maori for several years, as well as several raids on settlers and antipathetic Maori villages. On 10 November 1868, Te Kooti and his followers attacked the township of Matawhero on the outskirts of Gisborne. Some 54 people were slaughtered, including women and children. The dead included 22 local Māori as well as European settlers.

In February 2019, the name of the bay was officially gazetted as &quot;Tūranganui-a-Kiwa / Poverty Bay&quot; by the New Zealand Geographic Board.

== Geography ==

The bay is fed by the Waipaoa River, whose catchment is – large enough for individual storms and events to have a small impact on the sedimentary outflow. The river&#x27;s alluvial buffering is also minimal, and 95% of sediments are trapped by subduction-related anticlines on the bay&#x27;s seaward flank. This has led to Poverty Bay becoming a case area for sedimentary studies. The sediments of the bay provide records of changes brought about by the onset of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation about 4,000 years ago, colonisation of New Zealand by Polynesians (and associated deforestation), subsequent deforestation by Westerners, and the Taupo eruption.

Poverty Bay is one of the more fertile areas of New Zealand and famous for its Chardonnay, fruit, vegetables and avocados, with abundant sunshine and fertile alluvial soil.

<text>Expect is an extension to the Tcl scripting language written by Don Libes. The program automates interactions with programs that expose a text terminal interface. Expect, originally written in 1990 for the Unix platform, has since become available for Microsoft Windows and other systems.

== Basics ==
Expect is used to automate control of interactive applications such as Telnet, FTP, passwd, fsck, rlogin, tip, SSH, and others. Expect uses pseudo terminals (Unix) or emulates a console (Windows), starts the target program, and then communicates with it, just as a human would, via the terminal or console interface. Tk, another Tcl extension, can be used to provide a GUI.

== Usage ==

Expect serves as a &quot;glue&quot; to link existing utilities together. The general idea is to figure out how to make Expect use the system&#x27;s existing tools rather than figure out how to solve a problem inside of Expect.

A key usage of Expect involves commercial software products. Many of these products provide some type of command-line interface, but these usually lack the power needed to write scripts. They were built to service the users administering the product, but the company often does not spend the resources to fully implement a robust scripting language. An Expect script can spawn a shell, look up environmental variables, perform some Unix commands to retrieve more information, and then enter into the product&#x27;s command-line interface armed with the necessary information to achieve the user&#x27;s goal. After retrieving information by interacting with the product via its command-line interface, the script can make intelligent decisions about what action to take, if any.

Every time an Expect operation is completed, the results are stored in a local variable called $expect_out. This allows the script to harvest information to feedback to the user, and it also allows conditional behavior of what to send next based on the circumstances.

A common use of Expect is to set up a testing suite for programs, utilities or embedded systems. DejaGnu is a testing suite written using Expect for use in testing. It has been used for testing GCC and remote targets such as embedded development.

Expect script can be automated using a tool called &#x27;autoexpect&#x27;. This tool observes your actions and generates an Expect script using heuristics. Though generated code may be large and somewhat cryptic, one can always tweak the generated script to get the exact code.
# Assume $remote_server, $my_user_id, $my_password, and 
# $my_command were read earlier in the script.

# Open a Telnet session to a remote server, and wait 
# for a username prompt.
spawn telnet $remote_server
expect &quot;username:&quot;

# Send the username, and then wait for a password prompt.
send &quot;$my_user_id\r&quot;
expect &quot;password:&quot;

# Send the password, and then wait for a shell prompt.
send &quot;$my_password\r&quot;
expect &quot;%&quot;

# Send the prebuilt command, and then wait 
# for another shell prompt.
send &quot;$my_command\r&quot;
expect &quot;%&quot;

# Capture the results of the command into a variable. This 
# can be displayed, or written to disk.
set results $expect_out(buffer)

# Exit the Telnet session, and wait for a special 
# end-of-file character.
send &quot;exit\r&quot;
expect eof
Another example is a script that automates FTP:
# Set timeout parameter to a proper value.
# For example, the file size is indeed big and the network 
# speed is really one problem, you&#x27;d better set this 
# parameter a value.
set timeout -1

# Open an FTP session to a remote server, and 
# wait for a username prompt.
spawn ftp $remote_server
expect &quot;username:&quot;

# Send the username, and then wait for a password prompt.
send &quot;$my_user_id\r&quot;
expect &quot;password:&quot;

# Send the password, and then wait for an &#x27;ftp&#x27; prompt.
send &quot;$my_password\r&quot;
expect &quot;ftp&gt;&quot;

# Switch to binary mode, and then wait for an &#x27;ftp&#x27; prompt.
send &quot;bin\r&quot;
expect &quot;ftp&gt;&quot;

# Turn off prompting.
send &quot;prompt\r&quot;
expect &quot;ftp&gt;&quot;

# Get all the files
send &quot;mget *\r&quot;
expect &quot;ftp&gt;&quot;

# Exit the FTP session, and wait for a special 
# end-of-file character.
send &quot;bye\r&quot;
expect eof
Below is an example that automates SFTP (with a password):
#!/usr/bin/env expect -f

# Procedure to attempt connecting; result 0 if OK, 1 otherwise
proc connect {passw} {
 expect {
 &quot;Password:&quot; {
 send &quot;$passw\r&quot;
 expect {
 &quot;sftp*&quot; {
 return 0
 }
 }
 # Timed out
 return 1

# Read the input parameters
set user [lindex $argv 0]
set passw [lindex $argv 1]
set host [lindex $argv 2]
set location [lindex $argv 3]
set file1 [lindex $argv 4]
set file2 [lindex $argv 5]

#puts &quot;Argument data:\n&quot;;
#puts &quot;user: $user&quot;;
#puts &quot;passw: $passw&quot;;
#puts &quot;host: $host&quot;;
#puts &quot;location: $location&quot;;
#puts &quot;file1: $file1&quot;;
#puts &quot;file2: $file2&quot;;

# Check if all were provided
if { $user == &quot;&quot; || $passw == &quot;&quot; || $host == &quot;&quot; || $location == &quot;&quot; || $file1 == &quot;&quot; || $file2 == &quot;&quot; } {
 puts &quot;Usage: &lt;user&gt; &lt;passw&gt; &lt;host&gt; &lt;location&gt; &lt;file1 to send&gt; &lt;file2 to send&gt;\n&quot;
 exit 1

# Sftp to specified host and send the files
spawn sftp $user@$host

set rez [connect $passw]
if { $rez == 0 } {
 send &quot;cd $location\r&quot;
 set timeout -1
 send &quot;put $file2\r&quot;
 send &quot;put $file1\r&quot;
 send &quot;ls -l\r&quot;
 send &quot;quit\r&quot;
 expect eof
 exit 0
puts &quot;\nError connecting to server: $host, user: $user and password: $passw!\n&quot;
exit 1
Using passwords as command-line arguments, like in this example, is a huge security hole, as any other user on the machine can read this password by running &quot;ps&quot;. You can, however, add code that will prompt you for your password rather than giving your password as an argument. This should be more secure. See the example below.
stty -echo
send_user -- &quot;Enter Password: &quot;
expect_user -re &quot;(.*)\n&quot;
send_user &quot;\n&quot;
stty echo
set PASS $expect_out(1,string)
Another example of automated SSH login to a user machine:
# Timeout is a predefined variable in Expect which by 
# default is set to 10 seconds.
# spawn_id is another predefined variable in Expect.
# It is a good practice to close spawn_id handle 
# created by spawn command.
set timeout 60
spawn ssh $user@machine
while {1} {
 expect {

 eof {break}
 &quot;The authenticity of host&quot; {send &quot;yes\r&quot;}
 &quot;password:&quot; {send &quot;$password\r&quot;}
 &quot;*\]&quot; {send &quot;exit\r&quot;}
}
wait
close $spawn_id

<text>The Lakatos Award is given annually for an outstanding contribution to the philosophy of science, widely interpreted. The contribution must be in the form of a monograph, co-authored or single-authored, and published in English during the previous six years. The award is in memory of the influential Hungarian philosopher of science and mathematics Imre Lakatos, whose tenure as Professor of Logic at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) was cut short by his early and unexpected death. While administered by an international management committee organised from the LSE, it is independent of the LSE Department of Philosophy, Logic, and Scientific Method, with many of the committee&#x27;s members being academics from other institutions. The value of the award, which has been endowed by the Latsis Foundation, is £10,000, and to take it up a successful candidate must visit the LSE and deliver a public lecture.

==Selection== 

The award is administered by the following committee:
*Professor Roman Frigg (Convenor, LSE)
*Professor Richard Bradley (LSE)
*Professor Hasok Chang (University of Cambridge)
*Professor Nancy Cartwright (University of Durham)
*Professor Kostas Gavroglu (University of Athens)
*Professor Helen Longino (Stanford University)
*Professor Samir Okasha (University of Bristol)
*Professor Sabina Leonelli (University of Exeter)
The Committee makes the Award on the advice of an independent and anonymous panel of selectors.

<text>A community of purpose is a community of people who are going through the same process or journey to achieve a similar, often emergent, objective. 

From user-generated reviews or collaborative filtering on a site such as Amazon.com which help people decide what to buy to the reputation system at eBay which gives users a sense of who they are dealing with before they transact, the community fuels collective accomplishment. The impact of a given community of purpose is directly proportional to the potential of its participants to get something done. To achieve impact, communities need the right scale (number of participants), the right level of engagement (participation and involvement) and the right collective capability in relation to the declared &quot;purpose&quot; of the community.

Effective communities of practice achieve a balancing act between offering the right capabilities and ensuring sufficient capacity to deliver efficiently. Communities of purpose can address a collective need, rather than a self-interest or defined goal typical of communities of practice and other forms of community, and can often generate unexpected results. Consequently, true communities of purpose are often an example of a complex adaptive system, unpredictable and among the least explored digital or physical community vehicles.

<doc id="1161056" wikidata="Q940332" url="?curid=1161056" title="Trollstigen">
<text>Trollstigen (or trollstigvegen; ) is a serpentine mountain road and pass in Rauma Municipality, Møre og Romsdal county, Norway.

It is part of Norwegian County Road 63 that connects the town of Åndalsnes in Rauma and the village of Valldal in Norddal Municipality. It is a popular tourist attraction due to its steep incline of 10% and eleven hairpin bends up a steep mountainside. During the top tourist season, about 2,500 vehicles pass daily. During the 2012 season, 161,421 vehicles traversed the route, compared to 155,230 vehicles during 2009.

The road is narrow with many sharp bends, and although several bends were widened during 2005 to 2012, vehicles over long are prohibited from driving the road. During the 2011 and 2012 seasons, buses up to were temporarily allowed as a trial. At the plateau there is a car park and several viewing balconies overlooking the bends and the Stigfossen waterfall. Stigfossen falls down the mountainside. The pass has an elevation of approximately .

&quot;Trollstigen&quot; is closed during late autumn and winter. A normal operating season stretches from mid-May to October, but may sometimes be shorter or longer due to weather conditions.

== Etymology ==
Trollstigen means &quot;the troll path&quot; or &quot;troll trail&quot;, from the Norwegian &quot;stig&quot; (also spelled &quot;sti&quot;), from Old Norse &quot;stigr&quot;.

==History==

Trollstigen was opened on 31 July 1936, by King Haakon VII after eight years of construction.

A major tourist facility including a restaurant was completed in 2012. Several viewing platforms have been constructed and older constructions improved upon. &quot;Trollstigen&quot; (along with County Road 63) was officially opened as a national tourist route by the Minister of Transport and Communications on 16 June 2012. &quot;Trollstigen&quot; itself (and the alpine summits to the west) lies within the &quot;Trollstigen landscape protection area&quot;, while the alpine area east of Trollstigen, including the Trolltindene range, is part of Reinheimen National Park.

In the summer of 2005, the road was repaired and about was spent on protection against rockfall, making the road safer to drive on.

In June 2021, Telia Norge commissioned an eco-friendly mobile base station powered entirely by solar, wind and hydrogen, therefore providing mobile phone coverage at Trollstigen for the first time ever.

==Awards==
* The Brownlow Medal was awarded to Jason Akermanis of the Brisbane Lions.
* The AFL Players Association MVP Award went to Andrew McLeod of Adelaide.
** This was the last year for the award under this name; starting with the 2002 season, it would be renamed the &quot;Leigh Matthews Trophy&quot;.
* The Coleman Medal was awarded to Matthew Lloyd of Essendon.
* The Norm Smith Medal was awarded to Shaun Hart of the Brisbane Lions.
* The AFL Rising Star award was awarded to Justin Koschitzke of St Kilda.

==Notable events==
* In their Round 16 match, Essendon trailed by 69 points 12 minutes into the second quarter against the Kangaroos, but recovered to record a high-scoring 12-point win. This presently stands as the largest ever comeback in a VFL/AFL game.
* and began its annual tradition of playing each other at the M.C.G. in a Melbourne home game on Queen&#x27;s Birthday Holiday, as the only AFL match of the day. The teams had met on the King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Birthday Holiday sporadically in the past (1950, 1958, 1961, 1964, 1975, 1977, 1983, 1993, 1996 and 1999) as one of several games played on the day, with the 1958 game&#x27;s attendance of 99,256 still enduring as the highest crowd for a non-final, but this was the first season that the fixture became annual, and the second time (after 1996) that the game was the only one played on the day.
* lost their first 17 matches of the season in succession; having lost in the final round of the 2000 season, this took the Dockers&#x27; losing streak to 18, the longest drought since Sydney&#x27;s 26 consecutive losses in 1992 and 1993.
* During the season, it came to the attention of the AFL that in 2000 and 2001, the had been using a controversial but then-legal practice of rehydrating its players by use of intravenous saline drip during half-time and between matches. The half-time drips were administered through stents which were inserted into the players&#x27; elbows prior to the game and covered with tape during the game. The AFL was concerned about negative perceptions of the practice, and the Lions agreed in early September to immediately cease intravenous rehydration. The league banned the practice in the 2002 pre-season, and the World Anti Doping Agency later banned the practice in 2007.

<text>A community of interest, or interest-based community, is a community of people who share a common interest or passion. These people exchange ideas and thoughts about the given passion, but may know (or care) little about each other outside this area. Participation in a community of interest can be compelling, entertaining and create a community where people return frequently and remain for extended periods. Frequently, they cannot be easily defined by a particular geographical area.

In other words, &quot;a community of interest is a gathering of people assembled around a topic of common interest. Its members take part in the community to exchange information, to obtain answers to personal questions or problems, to improve their understanding of a subject, to share common passions or to play.&quot; In contrast to a spatial community, &quot;a community of interest is defined not by space, but by some common bond (e.g. feeling of attachment) or entity (e.g. farming, church group)&quot;.

Online communities connect to communities of interest in that often, they develop out of interests in a particular topic. A benefit of online communities over place-based communities is that of non-physical access to group involvement.

<text>Alberto Tomba (born 19 December 1966) is a former World Cup alpine ski racer from Italy. He was the dominant technical skier (slalom and giant slalom) in the late 1980s and 1990s. At 182 cm and 90 kg, his powerful build was a contrast to the lighter, more traditional technical skiers who prioritised agility over muscle. Tomba was able to take advantage of the introduction of spring-loaded ski gates which replaced the older, solid gates in the early 1980s by using his power to maintain a faster, more direct line through courses. Tomba won three Olympic gold medals, two World Championships, and nine World Cup season titles: four in slalom, four in giant slalom, and one overall title. He was popularly called &quot;Tomba la Bomba&quot; (&quot;Tomba the Bomb&quot;).

==Early years==
Alberto Tomba was born in Bologna and raised in Castel de Britti, a village in the municipality of San Lazzaro di Savena – an area without strong alpine traditions, but not far from the appenninic piste of Monte Cimone and Corno alle Scale. His father Franco, a businessman in the textile industry, had been a keen skier since attending college in Switzerland and passed his love of the sport to his sons, driving Alberto and his older brother Marco from their home to Sestola so they could ski. Alberto learned to ski at the age of three and started racing at the age of seven. As a child, he participated in sports like tennis, football, and dirt biking, but he found that his greatest passion was for skiing. Later in life, in 1988, his father Franco promised him a Ferrari if he won a gold medal that year and, as he celebrated his first gold at the bottom of the slope, Alberto told his father and everyone else who was watching on TV that he wanted the car to be red.

In 1984 he took part in the Junior World Championships, where a fourth-place finish won him a position on the national B team. That year, in an exhibition parallel slalom competition in San Siro, Milan, he surprised everyone by beating every member of the A team. After three wins on the Europa Cup circuit, Tomba made his World Cup debut in December 1985 at Madonna di Campiglio, Italy, three days before his nineteenth birthday. Two months later, in Åre, Sweden, he surprised the skiing world by finishing sixth from a bib number of 62. His first podium came the following season in Alta Badia, Italy in December 1986, and later that winter he won bronze in the giant slalom at the 1987 World Championships in Crans-Montana, Switzerland - the only medal won by the Italian team at that World Championships.

==Rise to fame==
On 27 November 1987, Tomba scored his first World Cup victory, in a slalom at Sestriere, Italy (with starting bib number 25). Two days later he won the giant slalom, beating his idol, Ingemar Stenmark. It was now clear that Tomba was a force to be reckoned with within the alpine skiing world.

He went on to win nine races that 1988 season, including a slalom win at Madonna di Campiglio where he beat the second-placed finisher by 1.34 seconds, shouting &quot;I am the new messiah of skiing!&quot; as he crossed the finish line. He won that year&#x27;s World Cup titles in both slalom and giant slalom, but was runner-up in the overall standings to Pirmin Zurbriggen of Switzerland. During this early part of his career, Tomba also competed in super-G, an event he would continue to contest until 1989, despite never finishing better than fourth.

At the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Tomba won gold medals in slalom and giant slalom. In the first run of the GS, he finished an impressive 1.14 seconds ahead of his nearest competitor. &quot;Tomba la Bomba&quot; (&quot;Tomba the Bomb&quot;), as he was known, also earned some notoriety by asking out East German figure skater Katarina Witt, whom he met again later on.

Tomba was not as successful in the following two seasons, winning a total of four World Cup races. At the 1989 World Championships in Vail, Colorado, he could do no better than sixth place in the super G and seventh in the giant slalom. From 1989 to the end of his career, Tomba was surrounded by his own technical staff managed by former Olympic champion Gustav Thöni and strength and conditioning coach Giorgio d&#x27;Urbano, who worked with him for ten seasons.

Tomba was temporarily put out of action in 1990 when he crashed in a World Cup race in Val-d&#x27;Isère, breaking his collarbone. However, in the 1991 season, Tomba returned to his winning ways, winning the giant slalom World Cup title for a second time while finishing fourth in the slalom standings. He ended 4th in slalom at the 1991 World Championships at Saalbach-Hinterglemm (Austria) and crashed in the second giant slalom run after having clocked the fastest time in the first leg, handing the victory to Austria&#x27;s Rudolf Nierlich, the two-time winner at Vail, Colorado, two years earlier. In September 1991, he also met former Miss Italy, Martina Colombari, whom he dated for several years.

Tomba&#x27;s career reached its second peak during the 1992 season with nine victories and fifteen podiums, and he once again captured the season-long discipline titles in both his technical specialties. His duel with Paul Accola for the overall World Cup crown extended until the very end of the season and the Finals at Crans-Montana, but the Swiss skier scoring points in all disciplines including downhill and combined ultimately prevailed. At the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France, Tomba won what was to be his last gold medal at Val d&#x27;Isère, in the giant slalom, and picked up a silver in the slalom. In Val d&#x27;Isère, he became the first alpine champion to successfully defend an Olympic title when he won the giant slalom ahead of Marc Girardelli.

The 1993 World Championships, held in Morioka, Japan, again proved to be his nemesis. Tomba was suffering from a fever during the giant slalom and made a critical mistake in the slalom, failing to reach the podium in either race. To make matters worse, he only managed to win a single World Cup race in the entire 1993 season.

==Overall World Cup champion==
Tomba was back to his usual ways at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. After his slalom run, he was seemingly out of medal contention, (placed 12th) 1.84 seconds behind leader Thomas Stangassinger (and 1.00 behind place 3, Peter Roth), but in the second run he recovered to second place and won the silver medal.

It soon became apparent that the 1995 World Cup season would be his best yet. From December 1994 to March 1995, he amassed an impressive 11 victories in the technical events including seven in a row in slalom to finally capture the overall World Cup title that had eluded him in years past and bringing the Crystal Globe back to Italy, twenty years after Gustav Thöni&#x27;s last title in 1975.

At the 1996 World Championships, Tomba finally added the final missing pieces to his trophy case, winning two gold medals at Sierra Nevada, Spain. His GS victory came thanks to a second-run rally from 0.81 seconds behind.

After the 1996 World Championships, Tomba began contemplating retirement. He decided to come back for one more World Championship, held in 1997 on his home snow in Sestriere. He was disqualified in the giant slalom and had a disappointing first run in the slalom, but an excellent second run was good enough for his last major medal, a bronze. He decided to continue competing for one more year.

Tomba&#x27;s performance at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano was a sign that his career was winding to a close: for the first time in his Olympic career, he failed to medal after crashing in giant slalom. He suffered a painful injury and was not able to start in the second slalom run after losing much time in the first leg.

Alberto Tomba retired at the end of the 1998 season, but not before winning a last World Cup race at the Finals at Crans-Montana where he grabbed the slalom, becoming the only alpine male skier to have won at least one World Cup race per year for 11 consecutive seasons.

==Later in life==
After retiring from competitions, Tomba made numerous appearances on Italian television broadcasts, and in 2000 he made his acting debut in the crime film &quot;Alex l&#x27;ariete&quot;, directed by Damiano Damiani; the movie, however, was met with little success and was unanimously panned by movie critics.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony in Turin, Tomba brought the Olympic Flame into the stadium where he handed it off to the men&#x27;s 4 × 10 km gold medalists from the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer (De Zolt, Albarello, Vanzetta, Fauner). During the 2010 edition of &quot;Sport Movies &amp; TV - Milano International FICTS Fest&quot; he was awarded with &quot;Excellence Guirlande D&#x27;Honneur&quot; and entered in the FICTS &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;.

<text>The Royal Netherlands Army Artillery provides artillery support for the [[Royal Netherlands Army]]. It is divided into three corps, undertaking two roles: Korps Veldartillerie - Field Artillery and Korps Rijdende Artillerie - Horse Artillery. These two corps undertake the field artillery role. They are equipped primarily with the PzH2000 and were equipped with the M109 howitzer. Until 2013, one regiment retained the traditions of the Veldartillerie and one of the Rijdende Artillerie, with one assigned to each of the army&#x27;s mechanised brigades.

In 2013, following a series of defence cuts, the two artillery regiments were amalgamated into a single unit called the [[Fire Support Command]] &quot;(VuursteunCommando)&quot;, with four fire support batteries and an HQ battery, of which two of the fire support batteries are Veldartillerie and another two, together with the HQ battery, is Rijdende Artillerie. In 2025, the FSC will be split again with one FA and one Horse Artillery battalion each carrying the traditions of the two branches of artillery.

== Korps Luchtdoelartillerie ==
The third corps is Korps Luchtdoelartillerie - Air Defence Artillery. It undertakes the air defence role. Three individual batteries were equipped with Stinger man-portable air defence missiles and the Cheetah armoured air defence vehicle (a variation of the Leopard 1) and are assigned to the three mechanised brigades. The rest of the unit is assigned to provide air defence for other vital areas.

Korps Luchtdoelartillerie consists of the Air Defence Command (Commando Luchtdoelartillerie). 11 Air Defense Company (Air Assault) Samarinda (part of 11 Luchtmobiele Brigade) is considered part of the Air Defense Artillery Regiment, but is an independent Air Defense Company and part of the infantry Regiment Van Heutsz. It is composed mostly of infantry. To avoid confusion, it was named a company rather than a battery.

As of 2007 the Air Defence Command (Colua) is located at [De Peel Air Base] and equipped with the NASAMS 2 Army Ground Based Air Defense Systems (Army GBADS). The regiment consists of a Joint Air Defense Center, a Staff battery, 11th Air Defense battery, 13th Air Defense battery, an instruction and training battery and the Joint Air Defense School.

Each of the two Air Defense batteries consists of a staff platoon, three Stinger Weapon Platform platoons and a NASAMS 2 Fire Unit (FU). The SWP are available in two variants: The SWP [Fennek] is a four-wheeled armored vehicle with the [Aselsan] ready to fire a Stinger surface-to-air missile launcher. The Mercedes Benz G290GD four-wheel drive light transport vehicle, with a Dual Mounted Stinger (DMS) on a tripod, offers two Stingers ready to fire.

By integrating the Low Level Air Picture (LLAP) with both VSHORAD-missiles systems into the wireless GBADS-network, which is JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) capable, they can bring the Recognized Air Picture (RAP) to the SWPs. This is a unique capacity and a powerful attribute to NATINEADS (NATO INtegrated and Extended Air Defense System).

Besides the SWPs the Air Defense batteries have a NASAMS II (Norwegian Advanced Surface to Air Missile System II) Fire Unit (FU). Each FU consist of an FDC (Fire Distribution Centre), a MPQ-64 Sentinel radar and 3 Launchers with 6 AIM-120B (SL)AMRAAM&#x27;s ((Surface Launched) Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile) each.

The sensor capacity of the GBADS-network consists, besides the MPQ-64 and LLAPI (LLAP Interface), of five TRML (Telefunken Radar Mobil Luftraumuberwachung) radars. These Medium range, modular, highly reliable, countermeasures-resistant, 3D, C-band, self-contained, mobile radar systems are capable of detecting a real target with a small RCS ([Radar Cross Section]) like Cruise Missiles and U(C)AV&#x27;s (Unmanned Aerial (Combat) Vehicle&#x27;s), even at low attitudes.

== Joint Air Defense command ==

On September 23, 2009, it was announced by the Commander Royal Netherlands Army Commander, Commander Peter van Uhm, that all ground based air defense units, including the Air Force&#x27;s Guided Weapons Group (GGW), would be merged into a single Joint Air Defense Command at De Peel Air Base.

<doc id="1161104" wikidata="Q184611" url="?curid=1161104" title="Power of 10">
<text>In mathematics, a power of 10 is any of the integer powers of the number ten; in other words, ten multiplied by itself a certain number of times (when the power is a positive integer). By definition, the number one is a power (the zeroth power) of ten. The first few non-negative powers of ten are:

:1, 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, 10,000,000... 

==Positive powers==
In decimal notation the &quot;n&quot;th power of ten is written as &#x27;1&#x27; followed by &quot;n&quot; zeroes. It can also be written as 10&quot;n&quot; or as 1E&quot;n&quot; in E notation. See order of magnitude and orders of magnitude (numbers) for named powers of ten. There are two conventions for naming positive powers of ten, beginning with 109, called the long and short scales. Where a power of ten has different names in the two conventions, the long scale name is shown in parentheses. 

The positive 10 power related to a short scale name can be determined based on its Latin name-prefix using the following formula:
10[(prefix-number + 1) × 3]

Examples:
* billion = 10[(2 + 1) × 3] = 109
* octillion = 10[(8 + 1) × 3] = 1027


For further examples, see Names of large numbers. Numbers larger than about a trillion are rarely referred to by name or written out as digits, but instead are typically described with exponent notation.

==Negative powers==
The sequence of powers of ten can also be extended to negative powers.

Similar to the positive powers, the negative power of 10 related to a short scale name can be determined based on its Latin name-prefix using the following formula:
10−[(prefix-number + 1) × 3]

Examples:
* billionth = 10−[(2 + 1) × 3] = 10−9
* quintillionth = 10−[(5 + 1) × 3] = 10−18


== Googol and googolplex ==
The number googol is 10100. The term was coined by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner. It was popularized in Kasner&#x27;s 1940 book &quot;Mathematics and the Imagination&quot;, where it was used to compare and illustrate very large numbers. Googolplex, a much larger power of ten (10 to the googol power, or 1010100), was also introduced in that book.

==Scientific notation==
Scientific notation is a way of writing numbers of very large and very small sizes compactly.

A number written in scientific notation has a significand (sometime called a mantissa) multiplied by a power of ten.

Sometimes written in the form:

: &quot;m&quot; × 10&quot;n&quot;

Or more compactly as:

: 10&quot;n&quot;

This is generally used to denote powers of 10. Where &quot;n&quot; is positive, this indicates the number of zeros after the number, and where the &quot;n&quot; is negative, this indicates the number of decimal places before the number.

As an example:

: 105 = 100,000
: 10−5 = 0.00001

The notation of &quot;m&quot;E&quot;n&quot;, known as &quot;E notation&quot;, is used in computer programming, spreadsheets and databases, but is not used in scientific papers.

<doc id="1161111" wikidata="Q5489243" url="?curid=1161111" title="Frank Robinson (Xylophone Man)">
<text>Frank Robinson (1932 – 4 July 2004) was an eccentric street entertainer in Nottingham, England. He was by far Nottingham&#x27;s best known busker and was regularly seen around Nottingham City Centre for over fifteen years. His favourite busking place was outside of the C&amp;A store in the Lister Gate area of the city.

Little is known about Robinson&#x27;s personal life or background. Robinson lived in Cotgrave, south of Nottingham, travelling to the city each day. His real name only became widely known following his death; to the people of Nottingham and beyond, he was simply and affectionately known as the &#x27;Xylophone Man&#x27;. 

Robinson played a small child&#x27;s metallophone (despite his nickname) with a limited repertoire. His seemingly random hitting of bars was a familiar noise in the city centre and, despite his lack of musical ability, his excitable and enthusiastic approach to his instrument endeared him to the Nottingham public and also earned him something of a cult following.

The only interview he granted in his lifetime was with Nottingham media organisation LeftLion. His death in July 2004 sparked genuine mourning from many of the city&#x27;s people. BBC Radio Nottingham placed a tributes page on its website which within hours had hundreds of messages from city&#x27;s residents as well as people much further afield. 

On 10 November 2005, a simple memorial was unveiled outside of the store where he had been seen regularly for the past fifteen years. Paying tribute to the Xylophone Man, the plaque reads &quot;He played his Xylophone here for fifteen years, bringing a smile to the faces of the people of Nottingham&quot;.

<doc id="1161112" wikidata="Q364793" url="?curid=1161112" title="Arthur Capper">
<text>Arthur Capper (July 14, 1865 – December 19, 1951) was an American politician from Kansas. He was the 20th governor of Kansas (the first to have been born in the state) from 1915 to 1919 and a United States senator from 1919 to 1949. He also owned a radio station (WIBW in Topeka), and was the publisher of a newspaper, the &quot;Topeka Daily Capital&quot;.

==Life and career==
Capper was born in Garnett, Kansas. He attended the public schools and learned the art of printing. He became a newspaper publisher, eventually owning several newspapers and two radio stations. The best-known of his publications, &quot;Capper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, had an enormous readership among farm families and served as the base of his political support in Kansas. &quot;Capper&#x27;s&quot; continues today as a bimonthly glossy magazine that focuses on rural living.

Capper first entered politics in 1912 when he became the Republican candidate for governor of Kansas. In addition to a reputation built from his newspapers, he was also the son-in-law of former governor Samuel J. Crawford. He was defeated by Democrat George H. Hodges. However, Capper was elected governor in the next election in 1914 and served as governor of Kansas from 1915 until 1919, winning re-election in 1916. He was the first native Kansan to serve as the state&#x27;s governor.

Having served two full terms as governor, Capper was not permitted to run for a third term by the Kansas State Constitution. Instead, in 1918 he ran for election to the United States Senate and won. Capper became a long-serving senator, representing Kansas for five 6-year terms. He was in the Senate from 1919 to 1949 and was prominent among Republicans who supported the relief efforts and other policies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s administration. He did not seek reelection in 1948.

Capper was particularly interested in issues relating to agriculture. Before his time as governor, he served as president of the Board of Regents of Kansas State Agricultural College (now known as Kansas State University) from 1910 to 1913. While in the United States Senate, he at times served as chairman of the Committee of Expenditures of the Department of Agriculture and the Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. He also at times served as chairman of the Committee on Claims and the Committee on the District of Columbia. In the latter role he played a crucial part in starting the D.C. Alley Dwelling Authority in 1934, the first housing authority in the country. He co-sponsored the Capper–Volstead Act. In 1923 Senator Capper brought forward a constitutional amendment with an anti-miscegenation provision outlawing mixed-race marriages, but struck out the passage after protest from African-American organizations and stated it was an unnecessary troublemaker. The withdrawal of this section by the Senator was made easier because he himself did not write the bill. It was drawn by the attorney of the American Federation of Women&#x27;s Clubs.

In April 1943 a confidential analysis by British scholar Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office described Capper as:
Capper became chairman of the Senate&#x27;s Agriculture Committee in 1946; by that point, at the age of 81, he was nearly deaf and his speech was difficult to understand. He joined the Congressional Flying Club in 1947 at the age of 82 and took up flying lessons, as the oldest member of Congress, from Pearle Robinson, part owner of the Hybla Valley Airport just outside of Washington, D.C.

After retiring from the Senate, Capper returned to his home in Topeka, Kansas, where he continued in the newspaper publishing business until his death. He was buried in Topeka Cemetery in a plot adjacent to Governor Crawford.

==Capper publications==
Arthur Capper was the owner of the Capper Building in Topeka, Kansas, and the Capper publications, which over time included the &quot;Daily Capital&quot; (Topeka, Kansas), the &quot;North Topeka Mail&quot;, the &quot;Kansas Breeze&quot; (which later merged with the &quot;Mail&quot; to form &quot;Farmers Mail and Breeze&quot;), &quot;Missouri Valley Farmer&quot;, &quot;Capper’s Weekly&quot;, &quot;Nebraska Farm Journal&quot;, &quot;Missouri Ruralist&quot;, &quot;Oklahoma Farmer&quot;, and &quot;The Household Magazine&quot;.

A collection of his correspondences includes two letters of complaint from inmates at Parsons State Hospital.

<doc id="1161122" wikidata="Q4971303" url="?curid=1161122" title="British carriage and wagon numbering and classification">
<text>A number of different numbering and classification schemes have been used for carriages and wagons on Britain&#x27;s railways, and this page explains the principal systems. Carriages and wagons (either not self-propelled, or part of a multiple unit which has power units distributed throughout a semi-permanent formation of carriages) have frequently had similar arrangements for classification and numbering, so are considered together. There are also links to other pages that deal in greater depth with the particulars of individual types.

==Note on classification==
Carriage and wagon classification has never been quite the same as locomotive and multiple unit classification. For most railways, specific types were identified by their Diagram Number. This could simply be arranged by consecutive number, or there could be some greater organisation of numbers so that similar types were grouped together.

However, carriages and wagons have rarely been referred to in general terms by their Diagram Number. Instead there have been a variety of other codes and designations, referring to generic designs rather than specific types. For instance, there were the BR (adapted from the LNER system) and LMS carriage codes, which indicated interior layout or usage. The Great Western Railway (GWR) identified some of their non-passenger carriages and wagons through a series of animal designations, including sea life for departmental (non-revenue earning) stock, followed by a letter for detail differences, e.g. Beetle A.

The majority of the sections below deal solely with carriage and wagon numbering series, though where a particular classification system was used this is also described.

==Pre-nationalisation arrangements==
Before nationalisation in 1948, each railway company had its own numbering arrangements.

* The Great Western Railway and London, Midland and Scottish Railway (from 1933) adopted a system which allocated number ranges within a series for different types.
* The Southern Railway followed a similar approach, but used two series; for passenger carriages and for non-passenger carriages.
* The London and North Eastern Railway numbered its carriages with the first digit indicating the area it was allocated to.
* The Great Western Railway Diagram Numbers included a letter to indicate the general layout or usage, followed by a serial number issued consecutively.

==British Railways==
British Railways inherited the stock of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; and a substantial number of &#x27;Private Owner&#x27; wagons. It also inherited the stock of the Pullman Car Company when it was nationalised in the late 1950s.

===Numbering system===

====Arrangements at Nationalisation====
The numbers of carriages and wagons inherited from the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; companies were left unchanged, but with a prefix letter to show where they had originated from, as follows:

A &quot;D&quot; prefix in front of the regional prefix indicated departmental (non-revenue earning) stock. Departmental stock (including locomotives) inherited from the Southern Railway carried numbers with an &quot;S&quot; suffix (indicating Service stock, an alternative term for departmental) which was deleted and replaced with the &quot;DS&quot; prefix.

Former &#x27;Private Owner&#x27; wagons, owned by industrial concerns rather than the railway companies, had a prefix letter &quot;P&quot; but were renumbered into a new series commencing at 3000.

Some carriages and wagons built by British Railways to the designs of the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; companies were numbered in their series and carried the appropriate letter prefix. BR then introduced its own number series, for wagons beginning with B. Initially most designs were based on, or similar to, those of the pre-Nationalisation companies.

====Arrangements from 1951====
In 1951, the first production carriages built to British Railways&#x27; designs appeared, known as the Mark I. Numbers had a prefix letter (or letters) to indicate the region to which the carriage was allocated, and responsible for the maintenance. The inherited carriages then had a suffix letter indicating the company of origin.

New carriages had no suffix: when Pullman Company carriages were added, their numbers carried both prefix and a suffix (indicating regional allocation), as did the 2 tier car carriers built for the East Coast services.

The regional allocation letters used were:
Wagons retained the existing prefixes indicating their origin, and new stock built to British Railways designs was given a &quot;B&quot; prefix.

British Railways adopted the following numbering system for carriages and wagons built to its own designs (a small number of types built to pre-Nationalisation designs were later allocated numbers in this series, but only following rebuilding to new types). Note that in this table, reference is made to first, second and third class; from June 1956, second class was abolished and third class was renamed second class (and again to standard class in 1987). The few BR-design second class carriages (intended for use in Boat Trains since ships had three classes of accommodation) were designated as first class or unclassified.

Numbers 100000 to 999999 were used for non-passenger rated stock (including wagons, vans and departmental (non-revenue earning) carriages), while internal user vehicles (stock used for internal purposes (e.g. stores) at specific locations and unlikely to move) took numbers in the 0xxxxx series. For more details see below.

The same series was used for Mark 2 coaches built in the 1960s, but when Mark 3 carriage was introduced in the early 1970s new number ranges were carved out of the old series. These new ranges were perpetuated for Mark 4 carriages in the 1980s, and were as follows:

Diesel multiple unit builds in the 1980s utilised the 52xxx, 55xxx, 57xxx and 58xxx series for carriages, all of which were motored. The 55xxx and 58xxx contained a mix of driving and non-driving motors, but the 52xxx and 57xxx cars were all driving motors. Some series have been used for conversions of carriages, e.g. 63xx has been used for a variety of miscellaneous carriages, including generator vans and observation saloons.

A major change came in May 1983 when prefix and suffix letters was abandoned, and any carriage that had the same number as another carriage or a locomotive was renumbered. The programme worked as follows:
Further renumberings have taken place as new locomotives were introduced. Most have involved only a handful of carriages, but a major one saw carriages in the 920xx series renumbered 929xx when Class 92 locomotives were introduced.

This series has been perpetuated, though the series have been adapted for new generation multiple unit stock. For instance, the latest diesel multiple units have reused the 50xxx and 79xxx series for driving motors and the 56xxx series for non-driving motors. In the electric multiple unit series, Class 390 Pendolinos have reused the 68xxx and 69xxx series.

When BR began to build air braked wagons they had B prefixes, but this was dropped and six-figure numbers were used without prefix. Prefixes were added, however, if and when carriages and wagons transferred to the departmental/engineers&#x27; fleets.

Privately owned wagons and carriages were allocated numbers with an integral prefix to differentiate them from the BR number series, with carriages taking numbers in the 954xx and 99xxx series. From 1986, those carriages in the 99xxx series which otherwise duplicated BR bullion and exhibition van numbers were renumbered, and from then on the prefix was not essential for identification. Post-privatisation, with all carriages being privately owned, this list was discontinued and many carriages reverted to carrying their original BR number.

====Departmental and Internal User Stock====
Most departmental and internal user vehicles are converted from revenue-earning stock; only a small number are built for non-revenue earning use. Initially stock inherited from the &#x27;Big Four&#x27; companies was given regional prefixes (e.g. DE, DM, DS and DW) indicating their origin, and adapting existing number series.

From about 1951, British Railways started to use new numbering series for additions to departmental and internal user stock on a regional basis, as follows:

No prefix letters were used for internal user stock. Departmental wagons (and some passenger-rated non-passenger carrying coaching stock) often kept their original revenue earning stock number, but with the addition of the &quot;D&quot; prefix. On some occasions, passenger coaches that had been converted for use as wagons then entered departmental stock retaining their wagon number (most notably brake vans in the 963xxx series that were formerly passenger brake vehicles).

By the end of the 1960s, British Rail-built carriages were entering departmental stock and being allocated one of the regional prefixes according to their location, but from 1967 the &quot;DB&quot; prefix was introduced for all additions to departmental stock regardless of origin. This prefix was prefixed with a letter to indicate the use of the vehicle, as follows:

The principal numbering series for carriages with the &quot;DB&quot; prefix have been 975xxx, then 977xxx. The latest series to be used is 971xxx. Carriages built new into departmental stock have usually been numbered in the 999xxx (and sometimes 998xxx) series (though this series also contains some conversions too).

Also in the early days of the &quot;DB&quot; prefix, some departmental locomotives were numbered in the 966xxx and 968xxx series, though in recent years those locomotives that remain self-propelled have been allocated locomotive Class 97.

===TOPS &quot;CARKND&quot; classification system===
When the Total Operations Processing System was introduced by British Railways, classifications were applied to all carriages and wagons and recorded in a field called &quot;CARKND&quot;, which is now also used to refer to the classification system as a whole. The classification typically comprises three letters, the first of which indicates the broad type, as follows:

The second letter gave more detailed information, different for each series. The tables below list the variations for carriages:



Apart from hauled passenger carriages (&#x27;A&#x27; series), the final letter indicated the braking arrangements. Nowadays almost all stock is air-braked, but when TOPS was introduced there was much greater variety, which made marshalling trains more complicated and this information essential. The letters were:
For hauled passenger carriages (&#x27;A&#x27; series), the suffix denoting the braking arrangements was replaced by two characters as follows:

*An additional digit denoted the class of passenger accommodation:

*The final suffix indicated the build of the coach:
This resulted in a 4 character alphanumeric TOPS classification, such as AB21 representing a Mark 1 Brake Corridor Second (BSK).

<doc id="1161139" wikidata="Q5549182" url="?curid=1161139" title="Raúl Castells">
<text>Raúl Castells (born 1950 in Rosario) is a controversial Argentine political activist. He is the leader of an organization called &quot;Independent Movement for the Retired and Unemployed&quot; (in Spanish, &quot;Movimiento Independiente de Jubilados y Desocupados&quot;, MIJD), a piquetero group.

Castells moved in 1984 to Santa Fe, where he would spend the next twenty years. He has been detained a number of times under the administration of President Néstor Kirchner; he and his supporters have protested that he is being subject to political persecution. Though Castells has sympathizers in Argentina, many other people disagree with his views.

Castells had a documentary made about him and his movement, called &quot;Raúl The Terrible&quot;. It was made by Australian political filmmaker David Bradbury and writer/producer, Carlos Alperin. A &#x27;warts-and-all portrait of a man driven to change the world and a frightening insight into the politics of poverty.&#x27;In the beginning of March 2006, Castells was given permission to open a community kitchen for poor people at Puerto Madero, the most expensive and wealthy neighbourhood in the city. The site was donated by a business owner in the area who got his permit revoked. The building, offering free food to the poor, is situated opposite the Hilton Hotel and is topped with the words &quot;We are fighting for an Argentina in which the dogs of the rich don&#x27;t eat better than the children of the poor&quot;.

The project has proven controversial, with concerns about the influx of large numbers of impoverished people expressed by some local businessowners.

<doc id="1161144" wikidata="Q667220" url="?curid=1161144" title="Regiment Infanterie Johan Willem Friso">
<text>The Regiment Infantry Prins Johan Willem Friso is a line infantry regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army. Named after Johan Willem Friso of Orange-Nassau, it is the oldest and most senior regiment in the current order of battle. The regiment currently serves in the mechanized infantry role as 44 Armoured Infantry Battalion (44 Painfbat) as part of 43 Gemechaniseerde (Mechanized) Brigade.

== Naming ==
The regiment was formed during the 1950s, in a major reorganisation of the Royal Netherlands Army (Koninklijke Landmacht) after the end of WW II.

Before 1950 the army consisted of numbered regiment; in 1950 these regiments were changed into named regiments.

The Regiment Infantry Johan Willem Friso was created on 1 juli 1950 as a continuation of the former 1st Regiment Infantry (1 RI) and 9th Regiment Infantry (9 RI). Both 1 RI and 9 RI had always been stationed in the North of the Netherlands: 1 RI in Assen (province of Drenthe) and 9 RI in Leeuwarden (province of Friesland). Therefore, it was decided to name the new regiment after the former Stadhouder of Friesland, Groningen and Drenthe: Johan Willem Friso, Prince of Orange (born 14 August 1687 – died 14 July 1711).

In November 2020, the title of &quot;Prince&quot; was added to the name of the regiment, thereby becoming the Regiment Infanterie Prins Johan Willem Friso.

==Battle honours displayed on the colours==
* Tiendaagse Veldtocht 1831
* Citadel van Antwerpen 1832
* Java en Sumatra 1946-1949
* Noord-Kandahar en Uruzgan 2006

Each member of the 44th armoured infantry battalion (which is part of the regiment) carries a blue lanyard on their uniform in commemoration of their involvement in the UNIFIL peacekeeping operation in Lebanon from 1979 to 1985.

<text>Giancarlo Minardi (born 18 September 1947) is the founder and managing director of the now-defunct Minardi Formula One team.

==Early life==
Minardi was born in Faenza (Ravenna), Italy and has spent his life with cars. As a young boy, his family managed a Fiat dealership and an Agip fuel station, and currently manages Iveco and Selenia dealerships. His father, Giovanni Minardi, who died when Giancarlo was young, was also heavily involved in motor racing.

Giancarlo Minardi began his career as a business man, running a successful truck dealership in Italy. 

==Introduction to racing==
He began his racing career in 1968, buying a Faccioli tuned Fiat 500, achieving good results in the various hillclimbs he competed in. Subsequently he began rallying a Fiat 124, after which he turned his attention to leading the Scuderia del Passatore racing team. Between 1972 and 1974 he led the team to good results in Formula Italia, being runner-up in the 1972 championship and then in 1973 going on to win the title with Giancarlo Martini as driver. After a name change to Scuderia Everest in 1975, his team raced a BMW-March in the European Formula Two Championship for two years.

In 1980 he formed the Minardi racing team with financial backing from well known Italian motor racing patron Piero Mancini. Giancarlo led the Minardi team to four successful Formula Two seasons, the most notable success being a 1981 win at the Misano round with Michele Alboreto.

==Formula One==
Formula One was the next logical step for Minardi in 1985. In 1991, Ferrari provided Minardi with V12 engines.

===Merge with Scuderia Italia===
Money woes hit and in 1994 Minardi joined his team with Scuderia Italia in an effort to survive. In 1996 money ran short again and by year&#x27;s end Minardi was forced to sell 70% of his team to a new investor consortium. Giancarlo retained 14.5% with the remaining 15.5% distributed between the Scuderia Italia investors (Emilio Gnutti, Giuseppe Lucchini and Vittorio Palazzani) and Defendente Marniga. In an attempt to help saving the team Flavio Briatore became the main shareholder after a deal brokered by Bernie Ecclestone. In 1997 Gabriele Rumi from Fondmetal entered as a major partner. Minardi and Rumi shared the General Director role from 1997 to 2000.

===Red Bull takeover===
2001 saw another change in the ownership of the Minardi team with Australian Paul Stoddart buying the company, although Giancarlo retained the role of Managing Director, with particular emphasis on the development of young drivers. He left Minardi after the takeover and renaming to Scuderia Toro Rosso by the Red Bull energy drink concern in 2006. Subsequently he offered support to both Minardi Team by GP Racing in Euro F3000 and Minardi Piquet Sports in GP2 resulting in significant success for both teams, most notably with Nelson Piquet Jr. himself in GP2 who finished runner up to Lewis Hamilton in the 2006 championship.

===Driver development===
Driver development is an area in which Giancarlo is considered to have significant aptitude. He has identified and given breaks to many drivers who subsequently went on to achieve successes with other teams and in other formulas. Drivers such as Giancarlo Fisichella, Fernando Alonso, Mark Webber and Jarno Trulli all had their Formula One debut with Minardi.

==Later life==
Giancarlo currently resides in Faenza, Italy. He is married to Mara and has one son named after his father Giovanni. His son runs the driver management firm Minardi Management, who represents most notably F2 driver Andrea Kimi Antonelli. He has two brothers: Giuseppe, who has taken over the Fiat dealership (bankrupt in 2010) and Nando who now runs the truck concession. Giancarlo was the chairman of the football club Faenza Calcio.

In 2010, he ran for Mayor of Faenza.

In 2021, he became the president of the Imola Circuit.

In 2022, he became the President of the FIA&#x27;s Single Seater Commission.

<text>&quot;And the Children Shall Lead&quot; is the fourth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Edward J. Lakso and directed by Marvin Chomsky, it was first broadcast on October 11, 1968.

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; find children with great and sinister powers at their disposal.

==Plot==
The Federation starship &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrives at the planet Triacus. Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy, and First Officer Spock beam down in time to witness the death of Professor Starnes, the leader of a scientific expedition team. The other members of the expedition, apart from their five seemingly unconcerned children who play and chant, seem to have died at their own hands, dominated by a mysterious fear.

The crew bring the children back to the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, where McCoy evaluates them and determines that they are suffering from lacunar amnesia, unaware of what happened to their parents and unable to grieve. However, when left unattended in one of the ship&#x27;s rooms, the children chant an evocation and summon a glowing humanoid named Gorgan. He advises them to take control of the crew in order to get to Marcus XII, his preferred destination, where he will dominate millions more followers and conquer the galaxy. The eldest child, Tommy, uses mental powers Gorgan has bestowed on the children to trick the crew into steering the ship while presenting illusions that make them think they are still in orbit above Triacus.

Upon reviewing a troubling expedition film recorded by Starnes, Spock, McCoy, and Kirk return to the bridge to find the children and Gorgan fully in control of the crew through illusion and fear. Unable to break their hold on the crew, Spock observes that the children are merely possessed by Gorgan, who must be the evil embodiment of an ancient group of space-warring marauders released by Starnes&#x27;s archaeological survey.

Believing they can break the hold Gorgan has on the children, Spock plays back footage showing the children happy with their parents, who are then shown to be dead. As the children realize what has happened, they break down emotionally and Gorgan&#x27;s appearance begins to deteriorate as he shouts at the children but fails to retain their loyalty. With the children&#x27;s powers gone, the crew regains control and Kirk orders a course for Starbase 4 while they take care to comfort the children.

==Production==
The episode was filmed in July 1968.

Child actor Craig Hundley, who played Tommy, became a composer and inventor under the name Craig Huxley. His Blaster Beam, an 18-foot (5.5 m) long aluminum bar strung with piano wire and played using artillery shells, would appear on Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s soundtrack for the first &quot;Star Trek&quot; film, as well as James Horner&#x27;s &quot;Star Trek II&quot; and &quot;Star Trek III&quot; soundtracks. Huxley also composed the piece &quot;Genesis Project&quot; for the &quot;Project Genesis&quot; briefing video in &quot;Star Trek II&quot;.

Ferdin (who played Mary) and Tochi (who played Ray) would later reunite on &quot;Space Academy&quot;, a short-lived series that aired from 1977 to 1979 on CBS.

The somewhat bizarre casting choice for Gorgan was Melvin Belli, a personal injury attorney known as &quot;The King of Torts.&quot; His son Caesar played one of the children.

During a climactic scene on the bridge, the oldest child, Tommy Starnes (played by Craig Hundley), casts a spell to make Captain Kirk&#x27;s voice unintelligible, so as to render him unable to give orders to his crew. To accomplish this effect in the production of the show, some of William Shatner&#x27;s dialogue was recorded and then played back in reverse. When the audio is reversed in this segment of the finished soundtrack, Shatner can be heard clearly for the majority of the segment to state:

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Remove Lt. Uhura and Mr. Spock from the bridge. Confine them to quarters.
Did you hear me?
Take Mr. Sulu to his quarters. He is relieved of duty.
Remove Lt. Uhura and Mr. Spock from the bridge. Confine [unintelligible]
Take Mr. Sulu to his quarters
[unintelligible] Mr. Spock from the bridge. Confine them to quarters
Mr. Leslie, take Mr. Sulu to his quarters&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

Dave Tilotta performs a script analysis on this episode, comparing the original script to what was filmed and aired. He observed a deleted scene with Sulu and words to the children&#x27;s incantations among other things.

== Reception ==
This episode was reportedly considered the worst episode in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; canon by Spock actor Leonard Nimoy, as of 1986.

A 1995 newspaper fan vote for worst episode of the series nominated this episode and &quot;A Piece of the Action&quot;.

While the general fan consensus was that this was one of the poorer third-season episodes, and that Captain Kirk&#x27;s &quot;brusque, exaggeratedly authoritarian and at times unmistakably hostile attitude&quot; towards the titular children undermined both the moral and the plot, Richard Keller of TV Squad listed Gorgan as the tenth scariest television character.

In 2016, &quot;CNET&quot; ranked this episode as the 7th worst episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot;, based on rankings between an audience and discussion hosts at a 50th anniversary Star Trek convention in Las Vegas.

In 2017, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked this episode as the 3rd worst &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode of the original series.

In 2019 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation found, when charting the average IMDb ratings for all episodes of all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, that &quot;And the Children Shall Lead ...&quot; had the lowest of all Original Series episodes.

In 2020, &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked this episode as the 11th most scary episode of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise television episodes.

In the 2007 film, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, during the scene in which the killer is invited to call in to a television program and speak with Melvin Belli (Brian Cox), the newsman asks about Belli&#x27;s role in &quot;And The Children Shall Lead&quot;.

== Releases ==
This was released on LaserDisc in 1987 in the United States, paired with &quot;Is There in Truth No Beauty?&quot; on one double-sided 12&quot; disc.

This episode was released in Japan on December 21, 1993, as part of the complete season 3 LaserDisc set, &quot;Star Trek: Original Series log.3&quot;.

<text>Karen &quot;Duff&quot; Duffy (born May 23, 1962) is an American writer, model, television personality, and actress. She is a certified hospital chaplain, a former Coney Island Mermaid Queen, and one of &quot;People&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful Women&quot; in 1993. In 1995, Duffy was diagnosed with a rare form of the disease sarcoidosis called neurosarcoidosis. Since then, she&#x27;s written two books about her experience living with chronic pain and is a member of the Alliance for the Ethical Treatment of Pain Patients.

==Early life==
Duffy was raised Catholic, and is of Irish ancestry. She attended Park Ridge High School in Park Ridge, New Jersey, graduating in 1979. She received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in recreational therapy from the University of Colorado Boulder.

==Film and television career==
By 1989, Duffy was modeling and appearing in television commercials. She was a VJ for MTV in the early 1990s, under the name &quot;Duff.&quot; She had small roles in a handful of films including &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; and &quot;Blank Check&quot;, and by 1995 was working as a correspondent for documentary filmmaker Michael Moore on his television shows &quot;TV Nation&quot; and &quot;The Awful Truth&quot;. She also was a Revlon &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; as well as the face of Almay Cosmetics, and co-hosted the pay-per-view television event, &quot;Elvis: The Tribute&quot; from the Memphis Pyramid in 1994 with Kris Kristofferson.

In 2006, Duffy hosted &quot;House of Tiny Terrors&quot; on TLC. On July 7, 2007, she appeared on the Live Earth telecast on the Bravo Channel as a co-host at Giants Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey.

In 2008, Duffy began working with New York City&#x27;s NYC Media on a series of emergency preparedness videos. The videos, which mimic the style of the network TV show &quot;Secrets of New York&quot;, help raise awareness of the perils of natural disasters and preventative actions families should take to prepare for them.

== Writing and speaking on sarcoidosis ==
In 1995, Duffy was diagnosed with a rare form of the disease sarcoidosis called neurosarcoidosis. Her brain and spinal cord were affected, leaving her partially paralyzed.

Duffy is the author of the New York Times bestselling memoir &quot;Model Patient: My Life as an Incurable Wise-Ass&quot;. In her latest book, &quot;Backbone: Living With Chronic Pain Without Turning Into One&quot;, she describes her ongoing incurable disease and constant pain, using humor and acceptance of her condition to cope. She was inspired to write the second book by Lord Byron, who wrote &quot;Always laugh when you can, it is cheap medicine.&quot;

Her articles, on a range of subjects, have appeared in media outlets, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Oprah Magazine&quot;. She spoke at the 2018 US Pain Foundation annual gala.

==Personal life==
She married John Lambros in 1997. They have one son, who was born via surrogate in 2003. On Boston comedian Ken Reid&#x27;s podcast, Duffy stated she&#x27;s a devout Catholic.

<doc id="1161166" wikidata="Q7494567" url="?curid=1161166" title="Sheppey Light Railway">
<text>The Sheppey Light Railway was a railway on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, England, which ran from Leysdown to Queenborough, where it connected with the South Eastern and Chatham Railway&#x27;s Sheerness Line. It was engineered by Holman Fred Stephens and opened in August 1901 and closed on 4 December 1950. Originally there were stations at Sheerness East, East Minster on Sea, Minster on Sea, Eastchurch and Leysdown. Two halts were opened in 1905 at Brambledown and Harty Road.

== History ==

The completed line was inspected by the Board of Trade in mid-June 1901, who recommended some changes to the signalling. The railway was opened on 1 August 1901, with a formal opening ceremony a few weeks later. Freight on the line was shunted into sidings at Brambledown, Grove, Holford and Harty Road. Brambledown and Harty Road were upgraded to halts in 1905 by the addition to each of a simple platform and waiting hut. Passenger trains were run morning and afternoon, with a single freight train scheduled at lunchtime.

During WW1 a siding into the Royal Navy Aviation School (later RAF Eastchurch) was built running south of Eastchurch station from the Queenborough end. It was inspected by the Board of Trade (Colonel Pringle) in December 1916, but the inspector was unhappy that the loop points in the station were now controlled by two separate ground frames. These were replaced with a single ground frame which took another nine months. The RAF base continued in use until 1946.

The line had a relaxed atmosphere according to recollections of Don Pilcher, the fireman on the last train before the railway closed for all traffic on 4 December 1950. He said &quot;It was a bit like a bus service really. We would stop for anyone who waved a hanky or an arm indicating they wanted to get on&quot;. The last train carried a mock coffin with a large wreath of vegetables to signify the death of the line, and large crowds were present at every station. The driver of the last train, Tom Birchnell, shook hands with the driver of the first train to run on the railway (in 1901), Jack Buddle.

== Locomotives and rolling stock ==

For the first few years after opening the SE&amp;CR operated the line using standard locomotives and stock. However the light traffic on the line required a rethink.

===Petrol railcars===

In 1904 trials were carried out of two petrol engined railcars. One only had seats for four passengers, insufficient even for this byway, but the larger 16 seat railcar proved satisfactory. Unfortunately it proved impossible to find a motor mechanic on Sheppey to maintain it in those early days of internal combustion so the SE&amp;CR had to stay with steam power.

===Steam railmotors===

The solution was a steam railmotor – a small steam engine permanently coupled to a carriage portion. Two were bought in 1905, one for the Sheppey Light and one for the equally remote Hundred of Hoo branch on the other side of the Medway estuary. A further six were acquired in 1906 for use on other lightly used services. The railmotors remained in use until the outbreak of World War I. The steam engine components were scrapped but the carriage portions were united in pairs, coupled over a shared bogie, and in this format they remained in use on Sheppey, hauled by normal steam engines, until the line&#x27;s closure.

===Goods traffic===

As the steam railmotors did not have enough power to pull goods wagons, the SE&amp;CR sought out a small engine for the daily goods service. One, No. 54 &quot;Waddon&quot;, was obtained secondhand from their neighbour and rival, the London Brighton and South Coast Railway. This was one of that railway&#x27;s famous Terrier class tank engines. This particular example survived into British Railways days and is still preserved, albeit as a static exhibit, in Canada&#x27;s National Railway Museum.

===LCDR 653 and 20===
Two carriages that were used on the Sheppey Light Railway are preserved. These two being London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway No. 20 6w Saloon and No. 653 BTZ, later Saloon are preserved on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. No. 20&#x27;s centre wheel was removed for use on the IoWR when absorbed into Southern Railway ownership in 1924. No. 20 and 653 join over 15 more SR-used on-IOW carriages. Restoration of 20 was completed in 1993 and 653 was officially restored in 1979.

== Incidents ==

In August 1934 the body of a retired chargeman of boilermakers, Henry Bourne, was found alongside the line. He was suffering from cancer and the verdict at the inquest was &quot;Suicide while of unsound mind&quot;.

In April 1935 a car collided with a train on an ungated level crossing in Station Road, MInster, killing one man (James Mongi), and seriously injuring three others.

On 4 August 1935 a body was found next to the line near Leysdown, identified at the inquest as Frank Towndrow (62) of London. He wasn&#x27;t well and his widow didn&#x27;t know he had left London. The verdict was accidental death, though the railway was encouraged to take steps to prevent people wandering on the line.

The North coast of Kent can receive large amounts of snow when the wind blows from the North-East, and in 1940 a large snowfall stranded a train crew on the Sheppey Light Railway for three days and nights. The driver and fireman were accommodated at the RAF Station at Eastchurch. The rescue engine that was sent was stranded at Sheerness East. The locomotive had eventually to be towed back to its depot.

<text>The 1903 VFL season was the seventh season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 2 May to 12 September, comprising a 17-round home-and-away season followed by a two-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by two points in the 1903 VFL grand final; it was Collingwood&#x27;s second (consecutive and overall) VFL premiership. Collingwood also won its second consecutive minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 15–2 win–loss record. Collingwood&#x27;s Teddy Lockwood won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1903, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 17 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1903 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;&quot;Argus&quot; system&quot;.

==Season notes==
* Boundary umpires were added to some VFL matches, relieving the field umpire of the task of returning the ball to play from the boundary, and would be made permanent from 1904.
* Following their Round 1 loss to Geelong, St Kilda had played 100 VFL games for a record of two wins and 98 losses.
* The Round 2 match between Geelong and Carlton on 9 May was postponed after a railway strike on the afternoon of 8 May prevented the Carlton team from getting to Geelong. The league decided to use the opportunity to promote the game in Sydney, and arranged to play the match on Saturday, 1 August at the Sydney Cricket Ground, but due to heavy rain, the match was postponed to Monday, 3 August before a crowd of 5,000; Geelong won 8.7 (55) to 6.9 (45). In Round 3, Melbourne had to travel to Geelong by boat as the strike still had not been resolved.
* On 23 May, a crowd of 18,000 attended the round 4 match between Fitzroy and Collingwood at the Sydney Cricket Ground; Fitzroy won 7.20 (62) to 6.9 (45). Players wore large numbers on the back of their guernseys to assist the crowd.
* St Kilda&#x27;s win over South Melbourne in Round 7 was its first away win in 54 VFL matches; the 53 consecutive away losses is an AFL/VFL record. It was also St Kilda&#x27;s first senior away win since defeating Port Melbourne in 1894, after 77 consecutive winless away matches (including three draws) and 62 consecutive away losses.
* 1903 was the first time that the VFL Premiership was decided on the last kick of the day. The usually accurate Fitzroy captain Gerald Brosnan missed the goal from 30 metres out, and Fitzroy lost to Collingwood by two points.

==Awards==
* The 1903 VFL Premiership team was Collingwood.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Teddy Lockwood of Collingwood with 35 goals.
* South Melbourne took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1903.

<text>The Bitard is a fabulous animal. It is the symbol of the &#x27; or Order of the Venerated Bitard (May He be Blessed!), a [[student association]] of [[University of Poitiers]] (France) created in the 1920s. The members themselves are also calledBitardsand in some occasions they wear a cape colored according to their rank in the Order, along with a [[faluche]], the traditional French [[Student cap]]. The Bitards&#x27; faluche has the particularity of being decorated with a [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]] and having its own code for the signification of insignias. The folklore of the Order refers to [[François Rabelais]] as the word&#x27; appears twice in hunting outcomes in &quot;Pantagruel&quot;.

Each year, the Order organizes a one-week festival, called the &quot;&quot; (69th Students&#x27; Week). Various festive activities happen during this week, including a procession, drinking events and a Bitard hunting. There is also a fresco depicting the hunting of the Bitard on an interior wall of the Roche-d&#x27;Argent university restaurant (located in downtown Poitiers, near the Saint-Jean baptistery). A concrete statue of a phallus, called &quot;quéquette&quot; or &quot;blanche verge et les sept mains&quot;, erected by the Order of the Bitard in 1976 on the Poitiers campus, is a folk symbol for Poitiers students. The sculpture accidentally destroyed, during construction, in October 2015, was rebuilt, in April 2016.

<text>Georgian Bay Islands National Park (established 1929) consists of 63 small islands or parts of islands in Georgian Bay, near Port Severn, Ontario. The total park area is approximately . Prior to the creation of Fathom Five National Marine Park, Flowerpot Island was also a part of the park.

The islands blend the exposed rocks and pines of the Canadian Shield with the hardwood forests found further south. The park can only be reached by boat and all of the islands are open to the public. Limited camping and docking facilities, trails and cabins are only available on the largest island, Beausoleil Island.

It is part of the Georgian Bay Littoral Biosphere Reserve.

==Wildlife==
It is home to mammalian species such as white-tailed deer, moose, black bear, coyote, timber wolf, lynx, bobcat, porcupine, raccoon, beaver, red and grey fox species, chipmunk, and red squirrel. This park also provides habitat for 33 species of reptiles and amphibians, including the five lined skink, eastern hognose snake, the eastern fox snake, and the threatened eastern Massasauga rattlesnake. Some of the more isolated islands provide nesting areas for colonies of gulls and terns.

==Beausoleil Island==

Beausoleil Island is the largest island in the park and it offers island tent camping, overnight and day docking, heritage education programs, and hiking trails. Wheelchair accessible sites and reserved campsites are also available at the Cedar Spring campground on Beausoleil Island.

<doc id="1161192" wikidata="Q1037153" url="?curid=1161192" title="Mendoza Line">
<text>The Mendoza Line is baseball jargon for a .200 batting average, the supposed threshold for offensive futility at the Major League level. It derives from light-hitting shortstop Mario Mendoza, who failed to reach .200 five times in his nine big league seasons. When a position player&#x27;s batting average falls below .200, the player is said to be &quot;below the Mendoza Line&quot;.

==Origin==
Mendoza was a lightly used shortstop from Chihuahua, Mexico, who played for three franchises during a nine-season Major League career. While his fielding was highly regarded, his hitting was not. His batting average was between .180 and .199 in five seasons out of nine.

When he had trouble staying above .200 in 1979, teammates began to chide him. &quot;...Tom Paciorek and Bruce Bochte used it to make fun of me,&quot; Mendoza said in 2010. &quot;Then they were giving George Brett a hard time because he had a slow start that year, so they told him, &#x27;Hey, man, you&#x27;re going to sink down below the Mendoza Line if you&#x27;re not careful.&#x27; And then Brett mentioned it to Chris Berman from ESPN, and eventually it spread and became a part of the game.&quot;

Berman deflects credit back to Brett in popularizing the term. &quot;Mario Mendoza — it&#x27;s all George Brett,&quot; Berman said. &quot;We used it all the time in those 1980s &quot;SportsCenters&quot;. It was just a humorous way to describe how someone was hitting.&quot;

Mendoza ended up finishing 1979 below his own &quot;line&quot;, at .198. His hitting improved modestly in 1980 and 1981; he improved enough that, even with another sub-.200 in his final season of 1982, he raised his career batting average to .215.

However, Mendoza hit &quot;exactly&quot; .200 in the post-season, going 1-for-5 in 3 games with Pittsburgh in the 1974 NLCS.

Mendoza returned to his native land in 1983 and played seven seasons in the Mexican League, and achieved a more than respectable .291 career batting average in that league.

==Use outside of baseball==
The term is also used outside of baseball to convey a similar connotation of unacceptably subpar performance:
* &quot;The U.S. 10-year note yield declined below 2%... before moving back above the Mendoza Line... to 2.09% by early afternoon.&quot;
* &quot;A sub-$2,000 per theater average... is the Mendoza Line of box office numbers...&quot;
* &quot;Republican pollster Neil Newhouse... argues that these numbers have crossed below the political &#x27;Mendoza line&#x27;...&quot;
* On an episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother,&quot; Barney explains the &quot;Vicky Mendoza Diagonal&quot; line, which determines how attractive a girl must be in order for him to date her depending on how &quot;crazy&quot; she is.
* In an episode of &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, Brandon and Steve&#x27;s professor says &quot;And look, if you&#x27;ve done the reading you don&#x27;t have to worry, you will not fall below the Mendoza Line for a grade of a C.&quot; to which a student asks &quot;Umm, the Mendoza Line? Was that in the chapters?&quot;
*Then-Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton&#x27;s play was described as defining the &quot;Dalton Line&quot;, the minimum level of performance expected of a starting quarterback in the National Football League.

<doc id="1161193" wikidata="Q216894" url="?curid=1161193" title="Mount Arafat">
<text>Mount Arafat (, or ) is a granodiorite hill about southeast of Mecca, in the province of the same name in Saudi Arabia. It is approximately in height, with its highest point sitting at an elevation of .

The Prophet Muhammad, before becoming a Prophet, would break his tribe Quraysh’s tradition by standing at Arafat with the other Arabs, much to the shock of his fellow Qurayshite Jubair bin Mut`im who highlighted that he was a part of the Hums and questioning what business he had there.

According to Islamic traditions, the hill is the place where the Islamic prophet Muhammad stood and delivered the Farewell Sermon () to his companions () who had accompanied him for the Hajj towards the end of his life. Some Muslims also believe that Mount Arafat is the place where Adam and Eve reunited on Earth after falling from Heaven, believing the mountain to be the place where they were forgiven, hence giving it the name , meaning &#x27;Mountain of Mercy&#x27;. A pillar is erected on top of the mountain to show where this event is believed to have taken place.

The mountain is especially important during the Hajj, with the 9th day of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah, also known as the Day of &#x27;Arafah after the mountain itself, being the day when Hajj pilgrims leave Mina for Arafat; this day is considered to be the most important day of the Hajj. The (sermon) is delivered and and prayers are prayed together in the valley. The pilgrims spend the whole day on the mountain invoking Allah to forgive their sins.

== Geology and radiology ==
A 2012 study classified Mount Arafat as a granodiorite rock which mainly consists of feldspar, quartz and muscovite, among other minerals, using petrographic, fission track dating and γ-spectrometric (HPGe) techniques in order to study the geology, thermal history and the radiological hazards due to the presence of primordial radionuclides.

The study yielded fission track age of 9.13 ± 1.05 Ma of the Mount Arafat granodiorite. In addition, the study reported that rifting, magmatism, volcanism and seafloor spreading that resulted in the formation of Red Sea seems to have altered the original age of the Arafat granodiorite under study to 9.13 ± 1.05 Ma. Measured radioactivity concentrations due to Ra, Th and K were found to not pose any radiological health hazard to the general public.

== Hajj ==
Arafat rituals end at sunset and pilgrims then move to Muzdalifah for Maghrib prayer and a shortened Isha prayer and for a short rest.

The level area surrounding the hill is called the Plain of Arafat. The term Mount Arafat is sometimes applied to this entire area. It is an important place in Islam because, during the Hajj, pilgrims spend the afternoon there on the ninth day of Dhu al-Hijjah. Failure to be present in the plain of Arafat on the required day invalidates the pilgrimage.

Since late 2010, this place is served by Mecca Metro. On a normal Hajj, it would be around to walk.

== In literature ==
The hill is referenced in James Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;.

<doc id="1161196" wikidata="Q2943680" url="?curid=1161196" title="Cecil Chesterton">
<text>Cecil Edward Chesterton (12 November 1879 – 6 December 1918) was an English journalist and political commentator, known particularly for his role as editor of &quot;The New Witness&quot; from 1912 to 1916, and in relation to its coverage of the Marconi scandal.

==Life==
He was the younger brother of G. K. Chesterton, a first cousin once removed of A. K. Chesterton, and a close associate of Hilaire Belloc. While the ideas of distributism came from all three, and Arthur Penty, he was the most ideological and combative by temperament. His death, according to his widow, removed the theorist of the movement.

He was born in Kensington, London, and educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, then worked for a small publisher for a time. He then qualified as surveyor and estate agent, with a view to entering his father&#x27;s business, which is still flourishing today. In 1901 he joined the Fabian Society, with which he was closely involved for about six years. From 1907 he wrote for A. R. Orage&#x27;s &quot;The New Age&quot;. In 1908 he published an anonymous biography of his better-known brother, &quot;G. K. Chesterton, a Criticism&quot;, but his authorship was quickly discovered.

Chesterton had been one of the &#x27;Anti-Puritan League&#x27; of the 1890s, with Stewart Headlam (who stood bail for Oscar Wilde), Edgar Jepson and his brother; and then a member of Henry Holland&#x27;s Christian Social Union. While Chesterton was writing from a socialist point of view for Orage, he was also moving to an Anglo-Catholic religious stance. In 1911 he started editorial work for Belloc, with whom he wrote in &quot;The Party System&quot;, a criticism of party politics. In 1912 he formally became a Roman Catholic.

That same year he bought Belloc&#x27;s failing weekly &quot;Eye-Witness&quot;; Charles Granville who published it had been made bankrupt. He renamed it &quot;The New Witness&quot;, editing it for four years before enlisting in the army, and turning it into a scandal sheet. His persistent attacks on prominent political figures involved in the Marconi scandal (such as Lloyd George), and his public defence of his position in terms of a &#x27;Jewish problem&#x27;, have left him with a reputation as an anti-Semite. He was successfully brought to court by Godfrey Isaacs, one of those attacked, although the damages awarded were nominal. A government investigation revealed that high government officials had engaged in insider trading in the stock of Marconi&#x27;s American subsidiary, but the quantity of stocks they were known to have purchased was relatively small.

On 7 January 1914 Chesterton acted for the defence in the mock-trial of John Jasper for the murder of Edwin Drood in Covent Garden. G.K. Chesterton was Judge and Cecil&#x27;s future wife played Princess Puffer. George Bernard Shaw was foreman of the jury.

In 1916 he married journalist Ada Elizabeth Jones, later known as a writer, after a long courtship. He joined the Highland Light Infantry as a private soldier. His brother Gilbert took over the paper, with Ada as Secretary and Business Manager. Eventually in 1925 Gilbert, with great reluctance, allowed it to be renamed &quot;G. K.&#x27;s Weekly&quot; because his name was very well-known and likely to attract interest.

He was three times wounded fighting in France, and died there in a hospital of nephritis on 6 December 1918. His wife Ada had rushed to his bedside and she arrived just before he died. She was his only relative at his funeral, when he was buried at the Terlincthun British Cemetery, Wimille. Although sick, he had refused to leave his post until the Armistice. On 13 December, G. K. Chesterton would report his death in the &quot;New Witness&quot;, noting that &quot;He lived long enough to march to the victory which was for him a supreme vision of liberty and the light.&quot;

<doc id="1161199" wikidata="Q1018715" url="?curid=1161199" title="Byte addressing">
<text>Byte addressing in hardware architectures supports accessing individual bytes. Computers with byte addressing are sometimes called byte machines, in contrast to &quot;word-addressable&quot; architectures, &quot;word machines&quot;, that access data by word.

==Background==
The basic unit of digital storage is a bit, storing a single 0 or 1. Many common instruction set architectures can address more than 8 bits of data at a time. For example, 32-bit x86 processors have 32-bit general-purpose registers and can handle 32-bit (4-byte) data in single instructions. However, data in memory may be of various lengths. Instruction sets that support byte addressing supports accessing data in units that are narrower than the word length. An eight-bit processor like the Intel 8008 addresses eight bits, but as this is the full width of the accumulator and other registers, this could be considered either byte-addressable or word-addressable. 32-bit x86 processors, which address memory in 8-bit units but have 32-bit general-purpose registers and can operate on 32-bit items with a single instruction, are byte-addressable.

The advantage of word addressing is that more memory can be addressed in the same number of bits. The IBM 7094 has 15-bit addresses, so could address 32,768 words of 36 bits. The machines were often built with a full complement of addressable memory. Addressing 32,768 bytes of 6 bits would have been much less useful for scientific and engineering users. Or consider 32-bit x86 processors. Their 32-bit linear addresses can address 4 billion different items. Using word addressing, a 32-bit processor could address 4 Gigawords; or 16 Gigabytes using the modern 8-bit byte. If the 386 and its successors had used word addressing, scientists, engineers, and gamers could all have run programs that were 4x larger on 32-bit machines. However, word processing, rendering HTML, and all other text applications would have run more slowly.

When computers were so costly that they were only or mainly used for science and engineering, word addressing was the obvious mode. As it became cost-effective to use computers for handling text, hardware designers moved to byte addressing.

To illustrate why byte addressing is useful, consider the IBM 7094, which is word-addressable and has no concept of a byte. It has 36-bit words and stores its six-bit character codes six to a word. To change the 16th character in a string, the program has to determine that this is the fourth character of the third word in the string, fetch the third word, mask out the old value of the fourth character from the value held in the register, bitwise or in the new one, and then store back the amended word. At least six machine instructions. Usually, these are relegated to a subroutine, so every store or fetch of a single character involves the overhead of calling a subroutine and returning. With byte addressing, that can be achieved in one instruction: store this character code at that byte address. Text programs are easier to write, they are smaller, and run faster.

==Hybrid systems==
Some systems with word addressing, such as the PDP-6/10 and the GE-600/Honeywell 6000 series, have special mechanisms for accessing bytes efficiently.

On the PDP-6/10, special instructions operated on a &quot;byte pointer&quot; which included a word address, a bit offset, and a bit width. The / instructions loaded or stored one byte, the instruction incremented the byte pointer, and the / instructions incremented the byte pointer and then loaded or stored the next byte. These instructions could operate on arbitrary-width bit fields. Programs took advantage of this flexibility: those not needing lowercase letters used the limited character set of 6-bit bytes for efficiency; most used 7-bit ASCII, packed 5 to a word with one unused bit; and the C implementation used 9-bit bytes because C requires all memory to be byte-addressable.

On the GE/Honeywell machines, special indirect addressing modes could be used on most instruction types, and operated on a byte pointer which could operate on either 6-bit or 9-bit bytes.

Neither of these machines originally had direct machine support for random access to bytes; adjusting a byte pointer to point &quot;N&quot; bytes before or after the byte to which it currently pointed required a sequence of multiple instructions. The KL10 PDP-10 model extended the instruction to become the &quot;adjust byte pointer&quot; instruction, , that could adjust a byte pointer by an arbitrary number of bytes.

<text>The 1904 VFL season was the eighth season of the Victorian Football League (VFL), the highest-level senior Australian rules football competition in Victoria. The season featured eight clubs and ran from 7 May to 17 September, comprising a 17-round home-and-away season followed by a two-week finals series featuring the top four clubs.

 won the premiership, defeating by 24 points in the 1904 VFL grand final; it was Fitzroy&#x27;s third VFL premiership. Fitzroy also won the minor premiership by finishing atop the home-and-away ladder with a 12–5 win–loss record. &#x27;s Vin Coutie won the leading goalkicker medal as the league&#x27;s leading goalkicker.

==Background==
In 1904, the VFL competition consisted of eight teams of 18 on-the-field players each, with no &quot;reserves&quot;, although any of the 18 players who had left the playing field for any reason could later resume their place on the field at any time during the match.

Each team played each other twice in a home-and-away season of 14 rounds. Then, based on ladder positions after those 14 rounds, three further &#x27;sectional rounds&#x27; were played, with the teams ranked 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th playing in one section and the teams ranked 2nd, 4th, 6th and 8th playing in the other. 

Once the 17 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1904 VFL &quot;Premiers&quot; were determined by the specific format and conventions of the amended &quot;&quot;Argus&quot; system&quot;.

===Grand final===

==Season notes==
* The final home-and-away match between South Melbourne and Fitzroy at the Lake Oval was a torrid affair. Billy McGee of South Melbourne and Harry Clarke of Fitzroy were each suspended for three matches, while South Melbourne&#x27;s Billy Gent ran amok during the match, charging at players and was reported on three striking charges; Gent was suspended for the remainder of 1904 and all of 1905 (20 matches).
* After the drawn match between Geelong and Carlton at Corio Oval on 9 July 1904, a spectator was arrested for attacking the field umpire, Henry &quot;Ivo&quot; Crapp.
* The VFL introduced boundary umpires.
* In round four, Essendon played Melbourne in Sydney in front of only 6,000 spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground, lost to Melbourne, took five days to return to Melbourne by sea, then lost again to Fitzroy in their Saturday&#x27;s round five match.
* In the Final Premiership match Carlton was surging ahead of Fitzroy, and one of the Carlton forwards (Ross, 1996, does not name him, but it was most likely Mick Grace) took a powerful high overhead mark with his knees in his opponent&#x27;s back. The field umpire, Henry &quot;Ivo&quot; Crapp, obeying the VFL rules of the day, paid a free kick to the Fitzroy player for &quot;interference&quot;. Fitzroy steadied and went on to win the game. There was such an outcry after the match that the VFL immediately amended its rules to allow for what it now termed &quot;unintentional interference&quot;.

==Awards==
* The 1904 VFL Premiership team was Fitzroy.
* The VFL&#x27;s leading goalkicker was Vince Coutie of Melbourne with 39 goals.
* St Kilda took the &quot;wooden spoon&quot; in 1904.

<text>Khushbu Sundar (born Nakhat Khan; 29 September 1970) is an Indian politician, actress, film producer and television personality. She is known for her work predominantly in Tamil language films and in a few Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada and Hindi films. She has appeared in over 185 films, and has won three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, two Cinema Express Awards, a Kalaimamani Award and a Kerala State Film Award.

== Early life ==
Khushbu was born as Nakhat Khan on 29 September 1970 into a Muslim family in Bombay, Maharashtra, India. Her parents gave her the stage name Khushbu when she started her career as a child actress. She has been living in Chennai for nearly 40 years now.

== Film career ==
Khushbu started her career as a child artist in the Hindi film &quot;The Burning Train&quot; (1980) in the song &quot;Teri Hai Zameen Tera Aasman&quot;. Between 1980 and 1985, she performed as a child actor in various Hindi films like &quot;Naseeb&quot;, &quot;Laawaris&quot;, &quot;Kaalia&quot;, &quot;Dard Ka Rishta&quot;, and &quot;Bemisal&quot;.

Her sensitive performance in the emotional 1982 Hindi movie, &quot;Dard Ka Rishta&quot; was appreciated by audiences. The fairy song &quot;Kaun Hu Main Kya Naam Hai Mera&quot; from the movie is still a very popular song at Annual Day School performances, children&#x27;s parties and fairy themed parties in India.

She made her adult acting debut in the much-acclaimed 1985 Hindi film &quot;Meri Jung&quot; in a supporting role as Anil Kapoor&#x27;s younger sister. In the same year, she got her first lead role in the film &quot;Jaanoo&quot; opposite veteran actor Jackie Shroff. This was followed by &quot;Tan-Badan&quot; (1986) paired with Govinda. Khushbu played a significant supporting role in &quot;Deewana Mujh Sa Nahin&quot; (1990), alongside Aamir Khan and Madhuri Dixit.

Khushbu was introduced to South Indian screens by D. Ramanaidu and K. Raghavendra Rao through the Telugu film &quot;Kaliyuga Pandavulu&quot; (1986). Khushbu moved her base to Chennai and started focussing on Tamil and other South Indian film industries.

Khushbu had done close to 12 movies in Telugu and Kannada, and had bagged her first role in Tamil in the movie &quot;Dharmathin Thalaivan&quot; (1988). Then she did films like &quot;Kizhakku Vaasal&quot; (1990) and &quot;Nadigan&quot; (1990), but the movie which catapulted her to the top was the runaway hit &quot;Chinna Thambi&quot; (1991).

Prabhu and Khushbu appeared in several films together including &quot;Dharmathin Thalaivan&quot; (1988), &quot;Vettri Vizhaa&quot; (1989), &quot;My Dear Marthandan&quot; (1990), &quot;Chinna Thambi&quot; (1991), &quot;Kizhakku Karai&quot; (1991), &quot;Pandithurai&quot; (1992), &quot;Naalaya Seidhi&quot; (1992), &quot;Uthama Raasa&quot; (1993), &quot;Maravan&quot; (1993) and &quot;Chinna Vathiyar&quot; (1995). 

She met her future husband on the set of Sundar C&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Murai Maman&quot; (1995). 

She later appeared in successful films such as &quot;Nattupura Pattu&quot; (1996), &quot;Irattai Roja&quot; (1996), &quot;Ettupatti Rasa&quot; (1997), &quot;Paththini&quot; (1997), &quot;Thulli Thirintha Kaalam&quot; (1998), &quot;Simmarasi&quot; (1998), &quot;Viralukketha Veekkam&quot; (1999), &quot;Power of Women&quot; (2005), &quot;Periyar&quot; (2007) and &quot;Pazhani&quot; (2008).

Khushbu then forayed into television, plunged into politics and also devoted time as a homemaker.

In 2021, she made a comeback with Rajinikanth in &quot;Annaatthe&quot;.

She also makes appearances in songs directed by her husband Sundar C such as &quot;Theeya Velai Seiyyanum Kumaru&quot; (2013), &quot;Aambala&quot; (2015), &quot;Aranmanai 2&quot; (2016) and &quot;Aranmanai 4&quot; (2024).

==Filmography==
==Overseas engagements==
=== Involvement with the Australian Football (AFL) ===
Khushbu and sprinter Usain Bolt are honorary members of Richmond Football Club, based in Melbourne, Australia. Khushbu was made the number-one ticket holder of Richmond Football Club in March 2017. She became the first Indian, and is the only Indian female, to be bestowed with such an honour in the AFL.

Khushbu was introduced to Australian Rules Football, and nominated for the role of honorary member of Richmond Tigers by former Ministerial Adviser Mr. Nitin Gupta.

=== Session at the RMIT University, Melbourne ===
On 14 August 2017, Khushbu was invited by RMIT University to speak with their Media and Communication students about the &#x27;Representation of Women in Indian Cinema&#x27; at a session moderated by Dr. Vikrant Kishore. She also engaged in a lengthy Q&amp;A with students and guests, sharing her own experiences of working in Indian cinema for over 37 years and appearing in around 200 films.

Around 200-plus students and guests turned up to listen and interact with Khushbu. She was given a standing ovation by the audiences both at the beginning and at the end of the session.

Deakin University’s Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Global Engagement, Professor Gary Smith, was guest of honor at the celebrations, which were hosted at the University’s Burwood Campus.

== Political career ==

===DMK===
Khushbu joined the DMK on 14 May 2010. She was welcomed by DMK Leader Karunanidhi at the party headquarters in Chennai. Khushbu quit DMK on 16 June 2014.

===Congress===
Khushbu joined the Indian National Congress on 26 November 2014 after meeting with then Congress President Mrs. Sonia Gandhi and then Vice-president Mr. Rahul Gandhi. She served as the National Spokesperson of the INC. Khushbu has been very critical of Narendra Modi&#x27;s policies and has often taken to Twitter to criticise the ruling dispensation.

Khushbu resigned from Congress on 12 October 2020 ahead of the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections in 2021. The Congress Secretary of Media said that Khushbu was being pressured by her husband, Sundar C, to join the BJP. Khushbu claimed that her previous party &quot;does not want an intelligent woman&quot; and there is no freedom to speak the truth within the party. She referred to the Congress as &quot;mentally retarded&quot;. The National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled (NPRD) filed 30 complaints at different police stations in the state over her statements, alleging that she made derogatory remarks against people with disabilities.

=== BJP ===
On 12 October 2020, Khushbu joined the Bharatiya Janata Party. She is currently a National Executive Committee Member of the Bharatiya Janata Party. 

Khushbu said during a meeting with journalists in November 2023 that she wouldn&#x27;t apologize for using the term &quot;cheri language&quot;. She used the term to highlight the use of foul language against women in a post on social media platform X while responding to a supporter of the DMK who accused her of staying silent during the Manipur ethnic violence on social media. In Tamil, the term refers to Dalit colonies that are separated from the rest of a village or town, and it is frequently used in a derogatory manner in reference to anything crude or crass. Her use of the term &#x27;cheri&#x27; was condemned by activists for its caste-based connotations. The Neelam Foundation, an organization fighting for Dalit rights, demanded an unconditional apology. The Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi lodged a police complaint about her remarks. The Chennai city police increased security for Khushbu&#x27;s house after the SC/ST wing of the Congress party announced a protest in front of her house. In her defence, she claimed that she had utilized the French term &#x27;chéri&#x27;, which translates to &#x27;beloved&#x27;, and not the Tamil word &#x27;cheri&#x27;.

=== 2021 Tamil Nadu assembly election ===
The Bharatiya Janata Party fielded Khushbu for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election from Thousand Lights constituency in Chennai. She lost the election by a margin of 32,200 votes to Ezhilan Naganathan of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.
== Popularity ==
=== Temple built for Khushbu ===
During her prime, Khushbu was a prominent actress in Tamil cinema. She became the first Indian actress for whom her fans built a dedicated temple.

=== Food dishes, products named after Khushbu ===
During her prominence in Tamil cinema, several dishes in Tamil Nadu were named after Khushbu. Kushboo Idli, a rice cake, stood out as the most popular food item named after the actress. Other items such as Kushboo Jhumki, Kushboo Sarees, Kushboo Sharbet, Kushboo Coffee, Kushboo Cocktails, and various other food items were also named after her, with many still retaining those names.

== Social issues ==

=== Support for Jallikattu ===
Khushbu has been a very vocal supporter of the bull-taming sport, jallikattu, and has voiced her opinion at various national and international platforms. In Aug 2017, she even visited a cattle station in Warrnambool, Australia, to get a better understanding of how cattle are treated and raised on farms outside India. 

=== Fighting for more recognition of South Indian Cinema on global platforms ===
Khushbu has been very vocal about obtaining more recognition for South Indian cinema and non-Hindi cinema from India on global platforms, and film festivals. She has always maintained that Indian cinema is not just about Bollywood movies. 

In Aug 2017, Khushbu had visited the Victorian Parliament, and had meetings with former Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu, and Ministerial Adviser Mr. Nitin Gupta to request for more recognition for South Indian cinema in the Victorian government created and funded Indian Film Festival of Melbourne.

Although she married a Hindu, she has stated that she has not converted to Hinduism, nor has she been asked to do so by her husband. Though born into a Muslim family, Khushbu stated in 2006 that she was an atheist.

== Controversies ==
=== Accusations against IFFM===
Khushbu has been very vocal about getting more recognition for South Indian cinema, and the non-Hindi cinema from India on global platforms and film festivals. She has always maintained that Indian cinema is not just about Bollywood movies.

=== Opposition by Hindutva groups ===
Kushbu stirred controversy in December 2012 when she wore a saree that had images of the Hindu gods Rama, Krishna and Hanuman. The Hindu Makkal Katchi demanded an apology from her and threatened to start agitations. She responded by saying, &quot;I am not going to answer every Tom, Dick and Harry. Why should I? There is no need at all. Why are they worried about what a woman sports. Don&#x27;t they have any other worthwhile work?&quot;.

The Hindu Munnani and the Hindu Makkal Katchi filed several cases against Khushbu, accusing the actress of disrespecting Hindu gods by sitting cross-legged with her slippers in front of the idols of the goddesses Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Parvati during a puja for the muhurta in Chennai on 22 November 2007.

=== &quot;Maxim&quot; morphed photo case ===
In January 2006, in its first Indian edition, &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine featured a full-page composite photograph with her head pasted onto the body of a model wearing a bikini. Khushbu filed two complaints: defamation and the indecent representation of women against the editor and four others involved with the magazine. The proceedings were later stayed by the Madras High Court in December 2007 based on a plea filed by one of those charged.

=== Comments on pre-marital sex ===
In 2005, she said in an interview it was fine for girls to indulge in pre-marital sex if they safeguard themselves and took precautions to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Later, she justified her statement by saying no educated man could expect his partner to be a virgin. The Dalit Panthers of India stormed the office of the South India Film Artistes&#x27; Association in Chennai demanding an apology from her. The Pattali Makkal Katchi said it will protest outside her house. 22 complaints alleging that she was &quot;defaming Tamil womanhood and chastity&quot; were brought against her, but in 2010, the Supreme Court dismissed all cases.

<text>Air Commodore Sir John Adrian Chamier, (26 December 1883 – 3 May 1974) was a British officer of the Royal Air Force. Chamier is known as &quot;The Founding Father of the ATC&quot; for his role in the foundation of the Air Training Corps.

==Military career==

===Indian Army and Royal Air Force===
Chamier was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. After passing out on 27 August 1902, his name was added to the Unattached List of the Indian Army, and he was in October posted to the Punjab command. He was commissioned into the Indian Army as a second lieutenant on 11 January 1904, but with seniority from 27 August 1902, and on 5 February 1904 was attached to the 33rd Punjabis, an Indian Army regiment. He was promoted captain on 27 August 1911. Chamier was commissioned as a flying officer into the Royal Flying Corps on 26 August 1915 and served as a pilot in the First World War.

After the war, he transferred to the newly formed Royal Air Force, in which he served the rest of his career, eventually retiring in 1929. From November 1921 to February 1922, as Deputy Director, Directorate of Operations and Intelligence, Air Ministry, he was a delegate to the Washington Conference on the Limitation of Armaments.

===Air Training Corps===
After retirement from the RAF, Chamier became secretary of the Air League of the British Empire. During his tenure as secretary Chamier became involved with the founding, in 1938 of the Air Defence Cadet Corps, which on 5 February 1941 evolved into the Air Training Corps because the ADCC was seen as too forceful and decided to change it to a more subtle name of ATC. He set up the ATC to promote recruitment in the RAF and to get young people who are interested in aviation to be able to go to their local squadron at their own free will, making it more enjoyable.

After it was founded, Chamier became the Air Training Corps&#x27; first Commandant, until his retirement in 1944. He was succeeded by Air Marshal Sir Leslie Gossage.

==Civilian career==
Between 1928 and 1931 Chamier was a director on the board of Vickers (Aviation) Limited.

In the 1930s, Chamier and his company, Chamier, Gilbert-Lodge and Co acted as consultants for airport design and construction including those at Belfast Harbour and Luton.

Chamier was, at one time, the aviation correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

==Aircraft==
Chamier had a Mignet HM.14 &quot;Flying Flea&quot; light aircraft registered &quot;G-ADME&quot; in his name between 1935 and 1938.

==Decorations==

Chamier received several decorations for his service to the British Empire. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath, the Order of St. Michael and St. George and the Distinguished Service Order, and an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. In 1944 he was knighted as a Knight Bachelor.

==Politics==
Chamier was a member of and speaker at meetings of the January Club of the British Union of Fascists.

<text>The West Pier is a ruined pier in Brighton, England. It was designed by Eugenius Birch and opened in 1866. It was the first pier to be Grade I listed in England but has become increasingly derelict since its closure to the public in 1975. only a partial metal framework remains.

The pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s, and was designed to attract tourists to Brighton. It was the town&#x27;s second pier, joining the Royal Suspension Chain Pier that opened in 1823. The West Pier was extended in 1893, and a concert hall was added in 1916. The pier reached its peak attendance at this time, with 2 million visitors between 1918 and 1919. Its popularity began to decline after World War II, and concerts were replaced by a funfair and tearoom. A local company took over ownership of the pier in 1965, but could not meet the increasing costs of maintenance and filed for bankruptcy.

The pier closed to the public in 1975 and fell into disrepair and gradually collapsed. Major sections fell into the sea during storms in late 2002, and two separate fires, both thought to be arson, in March and May 2003 destroyed most of the remaining structure, leading to English Heritage declaring it beyond repair. Some structured demolition took place in 2010 to make way for the i360 observation tower; further structural damage from storms has occurred since.

The West Pier Trust owns the remains and has proposed various renovation plans. Some schemes have been opposed by local residents and the owners of the nearby Palace Pier, claiming unfair competition.

==History==
===19th century===
The West Pier was constructed during a boom in pleasure pier building in the 1860s, during which 22 new piers were erected across Britain. It was designed by architect Eugenius Birch as a place for seaside visitors to enjoy fresh sea air. Some wealthy residents in the nearby Regency Square objected to construction, complaining that the planned toll houses at the entrance would spoil the view of the sea from their homes. It was felt that the pier would have a positive effect on property values in the town, so the pier was approved. Construction began in 1863 and the pier opened to the public on 6 October 1866.
The pier&#x27;s length was with a width of at the pierhead. It was built with cast iron threaded columns screwed into the seabed. The superstructure&#x27;s ironwork was manufactured by Robert Laidlaw, featuring an &quot;oriental&quot; style. By the opening, the pier was fitted with gas lamps with ornamental serpent designs, which had been directly influenced by similar examples inside the nearby Royal Pavilion. The pier had ornamental houses, two toll houses and glass screens at the pierhead to protect visitors from the weather. A &quot;New Scientist&quot; report covering Britain&#x27;s piers called the pier Birch&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;.

In 1893, the pierhead was extended under the supervision of Birch&#x27;s nephew, Peregrine, who added a pavilion with a capacity for 1,400 people. After the Royal Suspension Chain Pier was demolished following a storm in 1896, the West Pier became the only one on Brighton&#x27;s seafront until the construction of the Palace Pier.

===20th century===

In April 1900, seven sailors from HMS &quot;Desperate&quot; drowned in bad weather as they approached the pier.

By the early 20th century, the earlier priority of good sea air on the pier had been replaced with a desire for public entertainment. The pier reached record levels of attendance in the early 20th century, attracting around 1.5 million visitors between 1910 and 1911. Attendance fell due to the onset of World War I, but increased afterwards, with around 2 million people visiting between 1918 and 1919.

Competition with the Palace Pier led to a new concert hall, designed by local architects Clayton &amp; Black. The 19th-century bandstand was demolished between 1914 and 1916. It was replaced by an eight-sided grand concert hall, constructed from cast-iron arches. It opened on 20 April 1916 with a concert by the King&#x27;s Royal Rifles silver band, made up of war veterans.
The concert hall had an in-house orchestra by November, and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43% of the pier&#x27;s revenue by 1920. The West Pier was favoured by locals, while the Palace Pier was used more by day trippers. A top-deck entrance was added to the hall in 1932. The pier&#x27;s central decking was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings, and its popularity began to decline. On 26 November 1944, a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier, crashing onto the beach. The pilot sustained head injuries. The fighter was one of four aircraft escorting a VIP flight.

The concert hall was converted into a tea room and the theatre redesigned as a restaurant in the early 1950s. A funfair was added around the same time. By the 1960s, the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties. In 1965, it was bought by a company owning some seafront hotels and entertainment venues. They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs. Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell on the beach, and the pierhead was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns. The pier was Grade II listed in 1969 and the council served compulsory repair notices, but the company was unable to afford them and opted for voluntary liquidation. The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it, passing control to the Crown Estate Commissioners.

==Restoration attempts==

After 1975, attempts were made to restore the pier. Supporters complained that the council was more interested in developing Brighton Marina. In 1982, the pier became the only one in Britain to be awarded Grade I listed status. The West Pier Trust was formed to save the pier, and bought it from the council in 1983 for a peppercorn fee of £100, although the council also demanded £800,000 required for immediate repairs before it could be opened to the public. A proposal to restore the pier with a ferris wheel failed after the backer went bankrupt.

===Decline and damage===
The pier suffered structural damage due to the Great Storm of 1987, and access from the shore was removed for safety reasons in 1991. The West Pier Trust continued to offer regular tours of the pier throughout the 1990s. In 1998, the National Lottery pledged £14 million to restore the pier, but the West Pier Trust was unable to find a suitable partner to help with restoration. The owners of the Palace Pier, who had become financially self-sufficient under their own means, claimed unfair competition. In 2001, English Heritage identified the pier as the most at-risk Grade I listed structure in the United Kingdom.

In December 2002, the pier partially collapsed during a storm, when a walkway connecting the concert hall and pavilion fell into the sea. The following month, the concert hall in the middle of the pier fell over, leaving the entire structure close to total collapse.
On 28 March 2003, the pavilion at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews were unable to save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. As fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, the cause of the fire remains unknown, although it is thought to have been arson. A more severe fire, also thought to have been intentional, burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of what was left of the concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle of the pier to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier beyond repair.

The West Pier Trust remained adamant that they would soon begin full restoration work. Retired boxer and local resident Chris Eubank criticised the delays, saying he could raise the money himself in six months. In December 2004, the Trust confirmed the restoration would not be going ahead after their plans were rejected by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The pier was partially demolished in February 2010, partly to make way for the planned i360 observation tower. In February 2014, due to stormy weather, the pier split in half and a large part of the centre fell into the sea. Waves swept away the eastern side of the damaged metal skeleton, which remained after the 2003 fire. A selection of artefacts rescued from the pier is exhibited in the Brighton Fishing Museum. A further section of the pier collapsed in February 2016. Part of the southwest corner of the pier collapsed overnight during Storm Claudio in November 2022.

The construction of the i360 revived interest in building a new West Pier on the site of the original. The West Pier Trust was hopeful that it could be in place by 2026 in time for the pier&#x27;s 160th anniversary. By October 2016, the trust had concluded that restoration of the original West Pier was beyond any practical means. The i360 entered administration and closed on 20 December 2024.

In 2019, the Trust sought to restore a Victorian-era octagonal kiosk that was salvaged from the pier in 1996 and planned to raise the estimated cost of about £750,000 using a crowdfunding campaign among other avenues. It also started periodic auctioning of various remains and fragments of the pier to fund a new seaside learning centre at the site of the original kiosk. Another Brighton-based organisation, City Partnerships, proposed construction of a new pier in the original location, which would be free to enter like the original and complement the nearby Brighton Palace Pier but this was opposed by the West Pier Trust as unrealistic.

==Art==

In 2010, the West Pier was illuminated with 3D mapping lasers as part of a series of artworks by Josef O&#x27;Connor to celebrate the Chinese New Year of the Tiger. The pier was illuminated by computer-controlled laser drawings to make it appear and disappear on the horizon, giving the appearance of reconnecting it to the shore.

==Media appearances==

The pier can be seen in several films, including &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1968), &quot;Villain&quot; (1971) and &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973) which was filmed on the pier and in locations nearby in Brighton. It was also prominently featured in the French comedy &quot;La Course à l&#x27;échalote&quot; (1975), starring Pierre Richard and Jane Birkin.

In Nick Cave&#x27;s novel &quot;The Death of Bunny Munro&quot;, Bunny&#x27;s son speculates on a reason for the 2003 fires. The band James filmed the video for &quot;Just Like Fred Astaire&quot; on and around the West Pier.

Mark Haddon&#x27;s title story in the 2016 collection &quot;The Pier Falls&quot; concerns the fictional collapse of the pier in 1970.

In the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022), a photo of the West Pier appears for less than a second amongst a montage of random pictures.

<doc id="1161227" wikidata="Q2636999" url="?curid=1161227" title="Regiment Huzaren van Boreel">
<text>The Regiment Huzaren van Boreel is an armoured regiment of the Royal Netherlands Army, named for . It currently serves in the armoured Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition, Reconnaissance (ISTAR) role; the regiment provides armoured reconnaissance squadrons assigned to the 43 Mechanised Brigade, 13 Light Brigade and 11 Airmobile Brigade. An STA artillery unit, an electronic warfare unit, Human Intelligence (HUMINT) unit and imagery intelligence unit are all formed into a single battalion attached to the Combat Support Brigade.

==Armoured reconnaissance==
The most important role of the regiment Huzaren van Boreel is armoured reconnaissance. To perform this task, the regiment has two brigade reconnaissance squadrons, one per mechanized brigade: 42 BVE (Brigade Verkennings Eskadron) for the 13th Mechanized Brigade, 43 BVE for the 43rd Mechanized Brigade.

The current motto of these units is &quot;See without being seen&quot;, as opposed to the cold-war-era &quot;Find, Bind and Strike&quot;, where the units would find the enemy, engage them, deliver an artillery strike, and speed off (the goal was to delay the Soviets long enough for NATO troops to arrive). With the new philosophy, the combat task of these units has faded away. Where the units were previously armed with tanks, AIFVs and even their own artillery, nowadays they are equipped with the state-of-the-art Fennek reconnaissance vehicle.

A BVE typically consists of three reconnaissance platoons with eight vehicles each, 24 people total, an anti-tank platoon equipped with four Fennek MRAT (with the Spike medium-range anti-tank missile), a logistics platoon and a staff platoon. The two armoured reconnaissance squadrons of 103 ISTAR battalion, 103 and 104 GGVE (ground-based reconnaissance squadrons), are similarly equipped, but instead of an anti-tank section, they have three Fenneks to support a Tactical Air Control Party in the forward air-control role.

The traditions of the Huzaren van Boreel are upheld by the following reconnaissance units:

42 Brigade reconnaissance squadron; this unit belongs to the 13th Light Brigade and is stationed at the De Ruyter van Steveninck barracks in Oirschot. They have the light reconnaissance and surveillance vehicle (LVB) Fennek and perform their tasks both mounted and on foot.

43 Brigade reconnaissance squadron; belonging to the 43rd Mechanized Brigade and stationed at the Johannes Post barracks in Havelte. This unit also has the LVB Fennek and performs both mounted and on foot.

11 Brigade reconnaissance squadron; belonging to the 11th Airmobile Brigade stationed at the Oranje barracks in Schaarsbergen. This unit, which originated from 103 Reconnaissance Squadron and the Pathfinder Platoon &#x27;Madju&#x27; 11AMB (Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers), has been part of 11 Air Manoeuvre Brigade (Air Assault) since 2015 and can be deployed by helicopter and parachute. They operate both on foot and mounted.

104 JISTARC Reconnaissance Squadron; belonging to the Joint ISTAR Commando stationed at the Tonnetkazerne in &#x27;t Harde.

<doc id="1161253" wikidata="Q4961884" url="?curid=1161253" title="Bressingham Steam and Gardens">
<text>Bressingham Steam &amp; Gardens is a steam museum and gardens located at Bressingham (adjacent to a garden centre), west of Diss in Norfolk, England. The site has several narrow gauge rail lines and a number of types of steam engines and vehicles in its collection and is also the home of a &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; exhibition.

==The gardens==

The gardens were established by Alan Bloom MBE at Bressingham Hall. He moved to Bressingham in 1946, after selling his previous site at Oakington in Cambridgeshire to raise the capital for the in Norfolk, where he hoped to be both a farmer and a nurseryman. He was a plant expert of international renown, particularly in the field of hardy perennials. He laid out the Dell Garden at Bressingham, with its well-known island beds. His son, Adrian Bloom, laid out five additional gardens for year-round interest, starting with Foggy Bottom in 1963. He is still largely in charge of the Bressingham Gardens, which are not part of the charity but are privately owned by the Bloom family business. The Dell Garden is curated by Alan Bloom&#x27;s son-in-law, Jaime Blake.

Much of the site is given over to commercial horticulture. The nurseries are not open to the public, but there is a garden centre on the site, which is independent from the Steam Museum and the Bloom Nurseries and Gardens. Bressingham Steam Museum is an independent charitable trust. Alan Bloom had wanted to create his own trust in 1967, to ensure that the collection would not be dispersed to pay for death duties, but the laws of the time made this difficult and after five years of negotiation, the museum was close to being handed over to the Transport Trust. However, the legislation governing private museums was relaxed just before the proposed handover in 1971. Consequently, Bloom was able to create his own trust and thus retain control of it, because the collection was of historical and educational importance.

== The Gallopers ==

The three-abreast Gallopers, purchased by Alan Bloom in 1967, are the centrepiece of the site. They were built by Frederick Savage in Kings Lynn in 1897 and were owned and operated by the Thurston family of Norfolk until 1934. The Gallopers later operated at Whitley Bay and later in Scotland before finding a home at Bressingham. They are currently powered by electricity, but were previously steam-powered. The engine used, &quot;Victoria&quot;, was originally built by Tidmans of Norwich. The organ – a Bruder-built, 48 keyless Chiappa – which was built from two organs in 1954, accompanies the Gallopers.
==Miniature gauge railways==
There exists a short loop of dual gauge, 5&quot; and 7.25&quot;, track complete with turntable and locomotive shed. This along with a 7.25&quot; Stafford steam locomotive, built by Station Road Steam, which was funded by the Young Steamers club at the Museum. The Young Steamers and this track has lain unused for a number of years.
===The Garden Railway===
This gauge miniature railway runs through the Dell Garden, giving passengers clear views of the flower beds. The journey begins in a terminus station within the museum grounds before heading into the Dell Garden. At the far end of the garden, the train is turned in a balloon loop, before returning to the station. A turntable is located at the end of the platform road to facilitate the turning of the locomotive with minimal movements required. The points located at the balloon loop and the entrance to the platform road are spring operated so there is no requirement for a signalman. The coloured light aspect signal protecting the platform is interlocked with the lie of the points being set for the platform road and the turntable also being set to the platform road. 

====Locomotives====
==Narrow gauge railways==
There are two railway lines which take visitors around the gardens:

===The Fen Railway===
The Fen Railway (formerly the Nursery Railway) is a narrow gauge railway. It was the second railway to be completed at Bressingham, first opening in 1966. The railway is long and crosses the Waveney Valley Railway, running parallel to it for a short distance. It also runs through meadows and passes the now-defunct plant nurseries. The Railway was extended twice following initial completion to become the length it is today.

== Gallery ==
==&quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; Collection==
The museum is the home of the national &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; collection of vintage vehicles. These are located on a reconstruction of the High Street in the fictional Walmington-on-Sea, beside the butcher&#x27;s shop of Lance Corporal Jones, Private Frazer&#x27;s undertaker&#x27;s shop, and Captain Mainwaring&#x27;s bank office.

The vehicles include Jones&#x27;s van and the dust cart from the 1971 &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; film, Mainwaring&#x27;s Austin 8 staff car used in the episode &quot;The Making of Private Pike&quot;, the vintage fire engine used in &quot;Brain Versus Brawn&quot; and the steamroller &quot;Boxer&quot; and traction engine &quot;Bertha&quot;, which appeared in other episodes.

<doc id="1161255" wikidata="Q1292139" url="?curid=1161255" title="Edward Ernest Bowen">
<text>Edward Ernest Bowen (30 March 1836 – 8 April 1901) was a first-class cricketer, footballer, and an influential schoolmaster at Harrow School from 1859 until his death, and the author of the Harrow school song, &quot;Forty Years On&quot;. He was notable in football for winning the first two FA Cup finals with the Wanderers. 

==Biography==
The son of Christopher Bowen, he was born at Glenmore in Ireland; his elder brother was Charles Bowen, a well-known judge. He was educated in England at Blackheath Proprietary School and King&#x27;s College, London before entering Trinity College, Cambridge. While studying at Cambridge, Bowen served as president of the Cambridge Union in 1856. After graduating from Cambridge, he was appointed an assistant master at Marlborough College in 1858, and moved to Harrow School in 1859. He was appointed a fellow of Trinity College in the same year as his move to Harrow. As a schoolmaster, Bowen believed that boys must be interested in his lessons and at ease with him. This was in contrast with the grave formality typical of the Victorian era. He was the founder of the &quot;modern side&quot; at Harrow, which gave prominence to subjects other than Latin and Greek. Bowen was the author of the Harrow school song, &quot;Forty Years On&quot;, which is still sung today, and to which an extra verse was later added in honour of Winston Churchill. He also wrote many other Harrow School songs along with the then Master in Charge of Music, many of which are sung by the school to this day at occasions known as &quot;songs&quot; every term. While at Harrow, he was housemaster of The Grove boarding house.

Bowen was considered a pioneer of association football at Harrow, and was an accomplished footballer himself. He played with the Wanderers in the inaugural FA Cup, helping the side reach the final of the competition against the Royal Engineers at The Oval, which the Wanderers won 1–0; they repeated their success in the 1872–73 FA Cup, defeating Oxford University in the final 2–0. Bowen played for England in the first pseudo-international in 1870, against Scotland at The Oval; this match preceded the first official international in 1872. Bowen played cricket at first-class level for Hampshire against Sussex at Hove. He failed to score in the match, twice being dismissed by James Lillywhite. His other sporting endeavours expanded to cycling, mountaineering, skating, and walking. Whilst an undergraduate at Cambridge, he walked the 90 miles from Cambridge to Oxford in 26 hours. He was politically active and was a member of the Liberal Party. He was their candidate for Hertford in the 1880 General election, but lost to future Prime Minister Arthur Balfour.

It was whilst on a cycling tour of France in 1901 that Bowen died suddenly at the village of Moux. Despite seemingly having been in perfect health, it was noted that his sudden death occurred while he was trying to mount his bicycle. Cyril Norwood said of him that he had &quot;kept the eternal boy alive within his own breast to the very end&quot;. His elder brother was also a first-class cricketer. His grandson, I. M. B. Stuart, was an Irish rugby union international and broadcaster.
