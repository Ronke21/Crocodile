<text>The Heritage Range is a major mountain range, long and wide, situated southward of Minnesota Glacier and forming the southern half of the Ellsworth Mountains in Antarctica. The range is complex, consisting of scattered ridges and peaks of moderate height, escarpments, hills and nunataks, with the various units of relief set off by numerous intervening glaciers.

The northern portion of the range was probably first sighted by Lincoln Ellsworth in the course of his trans-Antarctic flight of 23 November 1935. On 14 December 1959, the southern range was seen for the first time in a reconnaissance flight from Byrd Station, made by Edward C. Thiel, J. C. Craddock and E. S. Robinson. The team landed at a glacier on Pipe Peak, in the northwestern part of the range, on 26 December.

During the 1962–63 and 1963–64 seasons, the University of Minnesota expeditions made geologic and cartographic surveys of the range. The entire range was mapped by USGS from aerial photographs taken by the U.S. Navy, 1961–66.

The Heritage range was so named by US-ACAN because topographic units within the range have received names relating to the theme of American heritage.

<doc id="1158123" wikidata="Q1188851" url="?curid=1158123" title="The Dreaming (album)">
<text>The Dreaming is the fourth studio album by the English singer-songwriter Kate Bush, released on 13 September 1982 by EMI Records. Recorded over two years, the album was produced entirely by Bush and is often characterised as her most uncommercial and experimental release. 

&quot;The Dreaming&quot; peaked at on the UK album chart and has been certified Silver by the BPI. It initially sold less than its predecessors and was met with mixed critical reception. Five singles from the album were released, including the UK &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; and the title track, The Dreaming.

The critical standing of the album has improved significantly in recent decades. A public poll conducted by NPR ranked &quot;The Dreaming&quot; as the 24th greatest album ever made by a female artist. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. It is also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, the &quot;Mojo&quot; &quot;Top 50 Eccentric Albums of All Time&quot; list, and &quot;The Word&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Great Underrated Albums of Our Time&quot; list. Musicians such as Björk, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, and Big Boi of Outkast have cited &quot;The Dreaming&quot; as one of their favourite albums.

==Recording and composition==

Bush&#x27;s third album &quot;Never for Ever&quot; had been a co-production between her and Jon Kelly. For her fourth album, she elected to produce the work entirely herself. With her newfound freedom, Bush experimented with production techniques, employing a diverse blend of musical styles. She made extensive use of the Fairlight CMI digital sampling synthesizer, which she had first used on &quot;Never for Ever&quot;. She also collaborated with a variety of engineers, including Nick Launay, who had previously worked with artists such as Public Image Ltd and Phil Collins. Recording began around the release of &quot;Never for Ever&quot;, with the first demo for &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; being laid down in September 1980, inspired after Bush attended a Stevie Wonder concert.

Originally, Bush wanted Hugh Padgham to work with her as an engineer on the album, having been impressed with his work on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s eponymous third album. Due to Padgham&#x27;s busy schedule at the time — he was doing final work on Genesis&#x27; &quot;Abacab&quot; and was yet to co-produce with the Police on &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; — he was only able to work with her for a few weeks, engineering just the backing tracks for &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot;, &quot;Leave It Open&quot; and &quot;Get Out of My House&quot;. Launay therefore took over for the Townhouse sessions.

According to critic Simon Reynolds, &quot;armed with the Fairlight and other state-of-the-art machines, Bush pushed her existing maximalist tendencies to the brink of overload.&quot; In June 1981, the first single was released, &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot;, which peaked at No.11 in the UK, but the rest of the album was slow to develop, with Bush saying she suffered from writer&#x27;s block. Over the summer of 1981, Bush worked on the album at Abbey Road Studios and Odyssey Studios as well as working with Irish folk bands Planxty and the Chieftains in Dublin. After long days in the studio, Bush decided to take a break from the album in the latter part of 1981 and resumed work in the early months of 1982 – laying overdubs and other final touches throughout the period January to May 1982 at Advision Studios.
&quot;The Dreaming&quot; has been characterised as an experimental release. The album employs folk instruments such as mandolins, uilleann pipes, and didgeridoos, shifting time signatures and textures, polyrhythmic percussion, samples and vocal loops. Its songs draw inspiration from a variety of sources, including old crime films (&quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;), a documentary about the war in Vietnam (&quot;Pull Out the Pin&quot;), the plight of Indigenous Australians (&quot;The Dreaming&quot;), the life of Harry Houdini (&quot;Houdini&quot;) and Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Shining&quot; (&quot;Get Out of My House&quot;). Other tracks explore more personal issues; &quot;Sat in Your Lap&quot; examines feelings of existential frustration and the search for knowledge, while &quot;Leave It Open&quot; speaks of the need to acknowledge and express the darker sides of one&#x27;s personality. &quot;The Quietus&quot; suggested that &quot;&quot;The Dreaming&quot;″s disparate narratives frequently seem to be tropes for Bush&#x27;s quest for artistic autonomy and the anxieties that accompany it.&quot; Barry Walters of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described its sound as more similar to experimental post-punk bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees and Public Image Ltd in comparison to her previous works.

==Release and commercial performance==

The album was released on 13 September 1982. The album peaked at No. 3 in the UK. It however remained on the chart for only 10 weeks, making this Bush&#x27;s lowest-selling album, being certified just silver.

In November the next (and final UK release) single, &quot;There Goes a Tenner&quot;, was released in the UK. It is Bush&#x27;s only single not to enter the UK top 75. In Europe, &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; was released instead, which performed better chartwise. Belatedly, another single, &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; was released in Ireland in November 1983.

Despite the album&#x27;s relatively lacklustre sales elsewhere, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; was Bush&#x27;s first album to dent the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200, largely due to the growing influence of college radio and MTV. Following this, an EP was released in 1983, which also charted. In 1984, her second and third albums (&quot;Lionheart&quot;, and &quot;Never for Ever&quot;, respectively) were belatedly released in the US.

With the lengthy and expensive studio time used to complete the album, EMI Records were concerned at the relatively low yield of the album. Following this, Bush decided to build her own studio where she could be free to spend as much time as she liked. Although her next album, &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; (1985), was another long-gestating project, it returned Bush to the top of the charts.

The album cover depicts a scene described in the lyrics to the song &quot;Houdini&quot;. In the picture shown, Bush (wearing a houndstooth jacket/coat) is acting as Harry Houdini&#x27;s wife Bess, holding a key in her mouth, which she is about to pass on to him. The photograph is rendered in sepia, with just the gold key and Bush&#x27;s eye make-up showing any colour. The man with her on the cover photograph was her bass player, engineer and then-partner Del Palmer. In 2023, Joe Lynch of &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it the 96th best album cover of all time.

In November 2018, Bush released box sets of remasters of her studio albums, including &quot;The Dreaming&quot;.

==Critical reception==
===Initial response===
Upon its release, &quot;The Dreaming&quot; met with a mixed critical reception. Many were baffled by the unconventional techniques and dense soundscapes Bush had employed. Writing for &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Neil Tennant described the album as &quot;very weird. She&#x27;s obviously trying to become less commercial.&quot; Colin Irwin of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote that &quot;initially it is bewildering and not a little preposterous, but try to hang on through the twisted overkill and the histrionic fits and there&#x27;s much reward.&quot; He labelled &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; the only &quot;vaguely conventional track&quot; and predicted the album failing in the charts. American critic Robert Christgau wrote that &quot;the revelation is the dense, demanding music&quot;, calling it &quot;the most impressive Fripp/Gabriel-style art-rock album of the postpunk refulgence.&quot; Jon Young of &quot;Trouser Press&quot; called it &quot;a triumph of inventive songwriting and unpredictable performances&quot; but warned that &quot;its sensory overload will drive away the less than dedicated.&quot;

===Legacy===
In a later review, AllMusic called it &quot;a theatrical and abstract piece of work&quot;, as well as &quot;a brilliant predecessor to the charming beauty of 1985&#x27;s &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;.&quot; &quot;The Quietus&quot; called it &quot;a brave volte face from a mainstream artist&quot; and &quot;a startlingly modern record too&quot;, noting its &quot;organic hybridization, the use of digital and analogue techniques, its use of modern wizardry to access atavistic states.&quot; In 2014, Simon Reynolds called &quot;The Dreaming&quot; a &quot;wholly unfettered mistress-piece&quot; and &quot;a delirious, head-spinning experience&quot;. Bush herself called &quot;The Dreaming&quot; her &quot;she&#x27;s gone mad album&quot; and said it was not particularly commercial. On later revisiting the album she said she was surprised by the sound, saying that it was quite an angry record. &quot;Uncut&quot; said that it was a &quot;multi-layered, polyrhythmic and wildly experimental album [and] remains a landmark work&quot;. In 2018 &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s chief critic Alexis Petridis wrote, &quot;&quot;The Dreaming&quot; isn&#x27;t Kate Bush&#x27;s best album, but it remains my favourite; there&#x27;s something very beguiling about the sound of an artist finally letting their imagination fully run riot. Not that Kate Bush&#x27;s imagination was ever terribly constrained, but &quot;The Dreaming&quot; is marked by the sense that sampling technology had now enabled her to fully recreate the sounds in her head, and that she was now successful enough to please no-one other than herself.&quot;

In the 2010s, Björk and Big Boi cited &quot;The Dreaming&quot; as one of their favourite albums. Steven Wilson also stated that the album is one of his favourites and that his 2015 album, &quot;Hand. Cannot. Erase.&quot;, was musically influenced by it.

<text>DNA sequencing is the process of determining the nucleic acid sequence – the order of nucleotides in DNA. It includes any method or technology that is used to determine the order of the four bases: adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. The advent of rapid DNA sequencing methods has greatly accelerated biological and medical research and discovery.

Knowledge of DNA sequences has become indispensable for basic biological research, DNA Genographic Projects and in numerous applied fields such as medical diagnosis, biotechnology, forensic biology, virology and biological systematics. Comparing healthy and mutated DNA sequences can diagnose different diseases including various cancers, characterize antibody repertoire, and can be used to guide patient treatment. Having a quick way to sequence DNA allows for faster and more individualized medical care to be administered, and for more organisms to be identified and cataloged.

The rapid advancements in DNA sequencing technology have played a crucial role in sequencing complete genomes of various life forms, including humans, as well as numerous animal, plant, and microbial species.

The first DNA sequences were obtained in the early 1970s by academic researchers using laborious methods based on two-dimensional chromatography. Following the development of fluorescence-based sequencing methods with a DNA sequencer, DNA sequencing has become easier and orders of magnitude faster.

== Applications ==
DNA sequencing may be used to determine the sequence of individual genes, larger genetic regions (i.e. clusters of genes or operons), full chromosomes, or entire genomes of any organism. DNA sequencing is also the most efficient way to indirectly sequence RNA or proteins (via their open reading frames). In fact, DNA sequencing has become a key technology in many areas of biology and other sciences such as medicine, forensics, and anthropology.

=== Molecular biology ===
Sequencing is used in molecular biology to study genomes and the proteins they encode. Information obtained using sequencing allows researchers to identify changes in genes and noncoding DNA (including regulatory sequences), associations with diseases and phenotypes, and identify potential drug targets.

=== Evolutionary biology ===
Since DNA is an informative macromolecule in terms of transmission from one generation to another, DNA sequencing is used in evolutionary biology to study how different organisms are related and how they evolved. In February 2021, scientists reported, for the first time, the sequencing of DNA from animal remains, a mammoth in this instance, over a million years old, the oldest DNA sequenced to date.

=== Metagenomics ===

The field of metagenomics involves identification of organisms present in a body of water, sewage, dirt, debris filtered from the air, or swab samples from organisms. Knowing which organisms are present in a particular environment is critical to research in ecology, epidemiology, microbiology, and other fields. Sequencing enables researchers to determine which types of microbes may be present in a microbiome, for example.

=== Virology ===

As most viruses are too small to be seen by a light microscope, sequencing is one of the main tools in virology to identify and study the virus. Viral genomes can be based in DNA or RNA. RNA viruses are more time-sensitive for genome sequencing, as they degrade faster in clinical samples. Traditional Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing are used to sequence viruses in basic and clinical research, as well as for the diagnosis of emerging viral infections, molecular epidemiology of viral pathogens, and drug-resistance testing. There are more than 2.3 million unique viral sequences in GenBank. Recently, NGS has surpassed traditional Sanger as the most popular approach for generating viral genomes.

During the 1997 avian influenza outbreak, viral sequencing determined that the influenza sub-type originated through reassortment between quail and poultry. This led to legislation in Hong Kong that prohibited selling live quail and poultry together at market. Viral sequencing can also be used to estimate when a viral outbreak began by using a molecular clock technique.

=== Medicine ===
Medical technicians may sequence genes (or, theoretically, full genomes) from patients to determine if there is risk of genetic diseases. This is a form of genetic testing, though some genetic tests may not involve DNA sequencing.

As of 2013 DNA sequencing was increasingly used to diagnose and treat rare diseases. As more and more genes are identified that cause rare genetic diseases, molecular diagnoses for patients become more mainstream. DNA sequencing allows clinicians to identify genetic diseases, improve disease management, provide reproductive counseling, and more effective therapies. Gene sequencing panels are used to identify multiple potential genetic causes of a suspected disorder.

Also, DNA sequencing may be useful for determining a specific bacteria, to allow for more precise antibiotics treatments, hereby reducing the risk of creating antimicrobial resistance in bacteria populations.

=== Forensic investigation ===

DNA sequencing may be used along with DNA profiling methods for forensic identification and paternity testing. DNA testing has evolved tremendously in the last few decades to ultimately link a DNA print to what is under investigation. The DNA patterns in fingerprint, saliva, hair follicles, etc. uniquely separate each living organism from another. Testing DNA is a technique which can detect specific genomes in a DNA strand to produce a unique and individualized pattern.

DNA sequencing may be used along with DNA profiling methods for forensic identification and paternity testing, as it has evolved significantly over the past few decades to ultimately link a DNA print to what is under investigation. The DNA patterns in fingerprint, saliva, hair follicles, and other bodily fluids uniquely separate each living organism from another, making it an invaluable tool in the field of forensic science. The process of DNA testing involves detecting specific genomes in a DNA strand to produce a unique and individualized pattern, which can be used to identify individuals or determine their relationships.

The advancements in DNA sequencing technology have made it possible to analyze and compare large amounts of genetic data quickly and accurately, allowing investigators to gather evidence and solve crimes more efficiently. This technology has been used in various applications, including forensic identification, paternity testing, and human identification in cases where traditional identification methods are unavailable or unreliable. The use of DNA sequencing has also led to the development of new forensic techniques, such as DNA phenotyping, which allows investigators to predict an individual&#x27;s physical characteristics based on their genetic data.

In addition to its applications in forensic science, DNA sequencing has also been used in medical research and diagnosis. It has enabled scientists to identify genetic mutations and variations that are associated with certain diseases and disorders, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and targeted treatments. Moreover, DNA sequencing has also been used in conservation biology to study the genetic diversity of endangered species and develop strategies for their conservation.

Furthermore, the use of DNA sequencing has also raised important ethical and legal considerations. For example, there are concerns about the privacy and security of genetic data, as well as the potential for misuse or discrimination based on genetic information. As a result, there are ongoing debates about the need for regulations and guidelines to ensure the responsible use of DNA sequencing technology.

Overall, the development of DNA sequencing technology has revolutionized the field of forensic science and has far-reaching implications for our understanding of genetics, medicine, and conservation biology.

== The four canonical bases ==

The canonical structure of DNA has four bases: thymine (T), adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). DNA sequencing is the determination of the physical order of these bases in a molecule of DNA. However, there are many other bases that may be present in a molecule. In some viruses (specifically, bacteriophage), cytosine may be replaced by hydroxy methyl or hydroxy methyl glucose cytosine. In mammalian DNA, variant bases with methyl groups or phosphosulfate may be found. Depending on the sequencing technique, a particular modification, e.g., the 5mC (5-Methylcytosine) common in humans, may or may not be detected.

In almost all organisms, DNA is synthesized in vivo using only the 4 canonical bases; modification that occurs post replication creates other bases like 5 methyl C. However, some bacteriophage can incorporate a non standard base directly.

In addition to modifications, DNA is under constant assault by environmental agents such as UV and Oxygen radicals. At the present time, the presence of such damaged bases is not detected by most DNA sequencing methods, although PacBio has published on this.

==History==
=== Discovery of DNA structure and function ===
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was first discovered and isolated by Friedrich Miescher in 1869, but it remained under-studied for many decades because proteins, rather than DNA, were thought to hold the genetic blueprint to life. This situation changed after 1944 as a result of some experiments by Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty demonstrating that purified DNA could change one strain of bacteria into another. This was the first time that DNA was shown capable of transforming the properties of cells.

In 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick put forward their double-helix model of DNA, based on crystallized X-ray structures being studied by Rosalind Franklin. According to the model, DNA is composed of two strands of nucleotides coiled around each other, linked together by hydrogen bonds and running in opposite directions. Each strand is composed of four complementary nucleotides – adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) – with an A on one strand always paired with T on the other, and C always paired with G. They proposed that such a structure allowed each strand to be used to reconstruct the other, an idea central to the passing on of hereditary information between generations.

The foundation for sequencing proteins was first laid by the work of Frederick Sanger who by 1955 had completed the sequence of all the amino acids in insulin, a small protein secreted by the pancreas. This provided the first conclusive evidence that proteins were chemical entities with a specific molecular pattern rather than a random mixture of material suspended in fluid. Sanger&#x27;s success in sequencing insulin spurred on x-ray crystallographers, including Watson and Crick, who by now were trying to understand how DNA directed the formation of proteins within a cell. Soon after attending a series of lectures given by Frederick Sanger in October 1954, Crick began developing a theory which argued that the arrangement of nucleotides in DNA determined the sequence of amino acids in proteins, which in turn helped determine the function of a protein. He published this theory in 1958.

===RNA sequencing===
RNA sequencing was one of the earliest forms of nucleotide sequencing. The major landmark of RNA sequencing is the sequence of the first complete gene and the complete genome of Bacteriophage MS2, identified and published by Walter Fiers and his coworkers at the University of Ghent (Ghent, Belgium), in 1972 and 1976. Traditional RNA sequencing methods require the creation of a cDNA molecule which must be sequenced.

==== Traditional RNA Sequencing Methods ====

Traditional RNA sequencing methods involve several steps:

1) Reverse Transcription: The first step is to convert the RNA molecule into a complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule using an enzyme called reverse transcriptase.

2) cDNA Synthesis: The cDNA molecule is then synthesized through a process called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which amplifies the cDNA to produce multiple copies.

3)Sequencing: The amplified cDNA is then sequenced using a technique such as Sanger sequencing or Maxam-Gilbert sequencing.

==== Challenges and Limitations ====

Traditional RNA sequencing methods have several limitations. For example:

They require the creation of a cDNA molecule, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.
They are prone to errors and biases, which can affect the accuracy of the sequencing results.
They are limited in their ability to detect rare or low-abundance transcripts.

==== Advances in RNA Sequencing Technology ====

In recent years, advances in RNA sequencing technology have addressed some of these limitations. New methods such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing have enabled faster, more accurate, and more cost-effective sequencing of RNA molecules. These advances have opened up new possibilities for studying gene expression, identifying new genes, and understanding the regulation of gene expression.

===Early DNA sequencing methods===
The first method for determining DNA sequences involved a location-specific primer extension strategy established by Ray Wu, a geneticist, at Cornell University in 1970. DNA polymerase catalysis and specific nucleotide labeling, both of which figure prominently in current sequencing schemes, were used to sequence the cohesive ends of lambda phage DNA. Between 1970 and 1973, Wu, scientist Radha Padmanabhan and colleagues demonstrated that this method can be employed to determine any DNA sequence using synthetic location-specific primers. 

Walter Gilbert, a biochemist, and Allan Maxam, a molecular geneticist, at Harvard also developed sequencing methods, including one for &quot;DNA sequencing by chemical degradation&quot;. In 1973, Gilbert and Maxam reported the sequence of 24 basepairs using a method known as wandering-spot analysis. Advancements in sequencing were aided by the concurrent development of recombinant DNA technology, allowing DNA samples to be isolated from sources other than viruses.

Two years later in 1975, Frederick Sanger, a biochemist, and Alan Coulson, a genome scientist, developed a method to sequence DNA. The technique known as the “Plus and Minus” method, involved supplying all the components of the DNA but excluding the reaction of one of the four bases needed to complete the DNA.

In 1976, Gilbert and Maxam, invented a method for rapidly sequencing DNA while at Harvard, known as the Maxam–Gilbert sequencing. The technique involved treating radiolabelled DNA with a chemical and using a polyacrylamide gel to determine the sequence.

In 1977, Sanger then adopted a primer-extension strategy to develop more rapid DNA sequencing methods at the MRC Centre, Cambridge, UK. This technique was similar to his “Plus and Minus” strategy, however, it was based upon the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) by DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA replication. Sanger published this method in the same year. 

=== Sequencing of full genomes ===

The first full DNA genome to be sequenced was that of bacteriophage φX174 in 1977. Medical Research Council scientists deciphered the complete DNA sequence of the Epstein-Barr virus in 1984, finding it contained 172,282 nucleotides. Completion of the sequence marked a significant turning point in DNA sequencing because it was achieved with no prior genetic profile knowledge of the virus.

A non-radioactive method for transferring the DNA molecules of sequencing reaction mixtures onto an immobilizing matrix during electrophoresis was developed by Herbert Pohl and co-workers in the early 1980s. Followed by the commercialization of the DNA sequencer &quot;Direct-Blotting-Electrophoresis-System GATC 1500&quot; by GATC Biotech, which was intensively used in the framework of the EU genome-sequencing programme, the complete DNA sequence of the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; chromosome II. Leroy E. Hood&#x27;s laboratory at the California Institute of Technology announced the first semi-automated DNA sequencing machine in 1986. This was followed by Applied Biosystems&#x27; marketing of the first fully automated sequencing machine, the ABI 370, in 1987 and by Dupont&#x27;s Genesis 2000 which used a novel fluorescent labeling technique enabling all four dideoxynucleotides to be identified in a single lane. By 1990, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) had begun large-scale sequencing trials on &quot;Mycoplasma capricolum&quot;, &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;, and &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; at a cost of US$0.75 per base. Meanwhile, sequencing of human cDNA sequences called expressed sequence tags began in Craig Venter&#x27;s lab, an attempt to capture the coding fraction of the human genome. In 1995, Venter, Hamilton Smith, and colleagues at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) published the first complete genome of a free-living organism, the bacterium &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;. The circular chromosome contains 1,830,137 bases and its publication in the journal Science marked the first published use of whole-genome shotgun sequencing, eliminating the need for initial mapping efforts.

By 2003, the Human Genome Project&#x27;s shotgun sequencing methods had been used to produce a draft sequence of the human genome; it had a 92% accuracy. In 2022, scientists successfully sequenced the last 8% of the human genome. The fully sequenced standard reference gene is called GRCh38.p14, and it contains 3.1 billion base pairs.

=== High-throughput sequencing (HTS) methods ===
Several new methods for DNA sequencing were developed in the mid to late 1990s and were implemented in commercial DNA sequencers by 2000. Together these were called the &quot;next-generation&quot; or &quot;second-generation&quot; sequencing (NGS) methods, in order to distinguish them from the earlier methods, including Sanger sequencing. In contrast to the first generation of sequencing, NGS technology is typically characterized by being highly scalable, allowing the entire genome to be sequenced at once. Usually, this is accomplished by fragmenting the genome into small pieces, randomly sampling for a fragment, and sequencing it using one of a variety of technologies, such as those described below. An entire genome is possible because multiple fragments are sequenced at once (giving it the name &quot;massively parallel&quot; sequencing) in an automated process.

NGS technology has tremendously empowered researchers to look for insights into health, anthropologists to investigate human origins, and is catalyzing the &quot;Personalized Medicine&quot; movement. However, it has also opened the door to more room for error. There are many software tools to carry out the computational analysis of NGS data, often compiled at online platforms such as CSI NGS Portal, each with its own algorithm. Even the parameters within one software package can change the outcome of the analysis. In addition, the large quantities of data produced by DNA sequencing have also required development of new methods and programs for sequence analysis. Several efforts to develop standards in the NGS field have been attempted to address these challenges, most of which have been small-scale efforts arising from individual labs. Most recently, a large, organized, FDA-funded effort has culminated in the BioCompute standard.

On 26 October 1990, Roger Tsien, Pepi Ross, Margaret Fahnestock and Allan J Johnston filed a patent describing stepwise (&quot;base-by-base&quot;) sequencing with removable 3&#x27; blockers on DNA arrays (blots and single DNA molecules).
In 1996, Pål Nyrén and his student Mostafa Ronaghi at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm published their method of pyrosequencing.

On 1 April 1997, Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli submitted patents to the World Intellectual Property Organization describing DNA colony sequencing. The DNA sample preparation and random surface-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arraying methods described in this patent, coupled to Roger Tsien et al.&#x27;s &quot;base-by-base&quot; sequencing method, is now implemented in Illumina&#x27;s Hi-Seq genome sequencers.

In 1998, Phil Green and Brent Ewing of the University of Washington described their phred quality score for sequencer data analysis, a landmark analysis technique that gained widespread adoption, and which is still the most common metric for assessing the accuracy of a sequencing platform.

Lynx Therapeutics published and marketed massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), in 2000. This method incorporated a parallelized, adapter/ligation-mediated, bead-based sequencing technology and served as the first commercially available &quot;next-generation&quot; sequencing method, though no DNA sequencers were sold to independent laboratories.

== Basic methods ==

=== Maxam-Gilbert sequencing ===

Allan Maxam and Walter Gilbert published a DNA sequencing method in 1977 based on chemical modification of DNA and subsequent cleavage at specific bases. Also known as chemical sequencing, this method allowed purified samples of double-stranded DNA to be used without further cloning. This method&#x27;s use of radioactive labeling and its technical complexity discouraged extensive use after refinements in the Sanger methods had been made.

Maxam-Gilbert sequencing requires radioactive labeling at one 5&#x27; end of the DNA and purification of the DNA fragment to be sequenced. Chemical treatment then generates breaks at a small proportion of one or two of the four nucleotide bases in each of four reactions (G, A+G, C, C+T). The concentration of the modifying chemicals is controlled to introduce on average one modification per DNA molecule. Thus a series of labeled fragments is generated, from the radiolabeled end to the first &quot;cut&quot; site in each molecule. The fragments in the four reactions are electrophoresed side by side in denaturing acrylamide gels for size separation. To visualize the fragments, the gel is exposed to X-ray film for autoradiography, yielding a series of dark bands each corresponding to a radiolabeled DNA fragment, from which the sequence may be inferred.

This method is mostly obsolete as of 2023.

=== Chain-termination methods ===

The chain-termination method developed by Frederick Sanger and coworkers in 1977 soon became the method of choice, owing to its relative ease and reliability. When invented, the chain-terminator method used fewer toxic chemicals and lower amounts of radioactivity than the Maxam and Gilbert method. Because of its comparative ease, the Sanger method was soon automated and was the method used in the first generation of DNA sequencers.

Sanger sequencing is the method which prevailed from the 1980s until the mid-2000s. Over that period, great advances were made in the technique, such as fluorescent labelling, capillary electrophoresis, and general automation. These developments allowed much more efficient sequencing, leading to lower costs. The Sanger method, in mass production form, is the technology which produced the first human genome in 2001, ushering in the age of genomics. However, later in the decade, radically different approaches reached the market, bringing the cost per genome down from $100 million in 2001 to $10,000 in 2011.

=== Sequencing by synthesis ===
The objective for sequential sequencing by synthesis (SBS) is to determine the sequencing of a DNA sample by detecting the incorporation of a nucleotide by a DNA polymerase. An engineered polymerase is used to synthesize a copy of a single strand of DNA and the incorporation of each nucleotide is monitored. The principle of real-time sequencing by synthesis was first described in 1993 with improvements published some years later. The key parts are highly similar for all embodiments of SBS and includes (1) amplification of DNA (to enhance the subsequent signal) and attach the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support, (2) generation of single stranded DNA on the solid support, (3) incorporation of nucleotides using an engineered polymerase and (4) real-time detection of the incorporation of nucleotide The steps 3-4 are repeated and the sequence is assembled from the signals obtained in step 4. This principle of real-time sequencing-by-synthesis has been used for almost all massive parallel sequencing instruments, including 454, PacBio, IonTorrent, Illumina and MGI.

== Large-scale sequencing and &quot;de novo&quot; sequencing ==

Large-scale sequencing often aims at sequencing very long DNA pieces, such as whole chromosomes, although large-scale sequencing can also be used to generate very large numbers of short sequences, such as found in phage display. For longer targets such as chromosomes, common approaches consist of cutting (with restriction enzymes) or shearing (with mechanical forces) large DNA fragments into shorter DNA fragments. The fragmented DNA may then be cloned into a DNA vector and amplified in a bacterial host such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;. Short DNA fragments purified from individual bacterial colonies are individually sequenced and assembled electronically into one long, contiguous sequence. Studies have shown that adding a size selection step to collect DNA fragments of uniform size can improve sequencing efficiency and accuracy of the genome assembly. In these studies, automated sizing has proven to be more reproducible and precise than manual gel sizing.

The term &quot;&quot;de novo&quot; sequencing&quot; specifically refers to methods used to determine the sequence of DNA with no previously known sequence. &quot;De novo&quot; translates from Latin as &quot;from the beginning&quot;. Gaps in the assembled sequence may be filled by primer walking. The different strategies have different tradeoffs in speed and accuracy; shotgun methods are often used for sequencing large genomes, but its assembly is complex and difficult, particularly with sequence repeats often causing gaps in genome assembly.

Most sequencing approaches use an &quot;in vitro&quot; cloning step to amplify individual DNA molecules, because their molecular detection methods are not sensitive enough for single molecule sequencing. Emulsion PCR isolates individual DNA molecules along with primer-coated beads in aqueous droplets within an oil phase. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) then coats each bead with clonal copies of the DNA molecule followed by immobilization for later sequencing. Emulsion PCR is used in the methods developed by Marguilis et al. (commercialized by 454 Life Sciences), Shendure and Porreca et al. (also known as &quot;polony sequencing&quot;) and SOLiD sequencing, (developed by Agencourt, later Applied Biosystems, now Life Technologies). Emulsion PCR is also used in the GemCode and Chromium platforms developed by 10x Genomics.

=== Shotgun sequencing ===

Shotgun sequencing is a sequencing method designed for analysis of DNA sequences longer than 1000 base pairs, up to and including entire chromosomes. This method requires the target DNA to be broken into random fragments. After sequencing individual fragments using the chain termination method, the sequences can be reassembled on the basis of their overlapping regions.

== High-throughput methods ==

High-throughput sequencing, which includes next-generation &quot;short-read&quot; and third-generation &quot;long-read&quot; sequencing methods, applies to exome sequencing, genome sequencing, genome resequencing, transcriptome profiling (RNA-Seq), DNA-protein interactions (ChIP-sequencing), and epigenome characterization.

The high demand for low-cost sequencing has driven the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies that parallelize the sequencing process, producing thousands or millions of sequences concurrently. High-throughput sequencing technologies are intended to lower the cost of DNA sequencing beyond what is possible with standard dye-terminator methods. In ultra-high-throughput sequencing as many as 500,000 sequencing-by-synthesis operations may be run in parallel. Such technologies led to the ability to sequence an entire human genome in as little as one day. , corporate leaders in the development of high-throughput sequencing products included Illumina, Qiagen and ThermoFisher Scientific.

=== Long-read sequencing methods ===
==== Single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing ====

SMRT sequencing is based on the sequencing by synthesis approach. The DNA is synthesized in zero-mode wave-guides (ZMWs) – small well-like containers with the capturing tools located at the bottom of the well. The sequencing is performed with use of unmodified polymerase (attached to the ZMW bottom) and fluorescently labelled nucleotides flowing freely in the solution. The wells are constructed in a way that only the fluorescence occurring by the bottom of the well is detected. The fluorescent label is detached from the nucleotide upon its incorporation into the DNA strand, leaving an unmodified DNA strand. According to Pacific Biosciences (PacBio), the SMRT technology developer, this methodology allows detection of nucleotide modifications (such as cytosine methylation). This happens through the observation of polymerase kinetics. This approach allows reads of 20,000 nucleotides or more, with average read lengths of 5 kilobases. In 2015, Pacific Biosciences announced the launch of a new sequencing instrument called the Sequel System, with 1 million ZMWs compared to 150,000 ZMWs in the PacBio RS II instrument. SMRT sequencing is referred to as &quot;third-generation&quot; or &quot;long-read&quot; sequencing.

==== Nanopore DNA sequencing ====

The DNA passing through the nanopore changes its ion current. This change is dependent on the shape, size and length of the DNA sequence. Each type of the nucleotide blocks the ion flow through the pore for a different period of time. The method does not require modified nucleotides and is performed in real time. Nanopore sequencing is referred to as &quot;third-generation&quot; or &quot;long-read&quot; sequencing, along with SMRT sequencing.

Early industrial research into this method was based on a technique called &#x27;exonuclease sequencing&#x27;, where the readout of electrical signals occurred as nucleotides passed by alpha(α)-hemolysin pores covalently bound with cyclodextrin. However the subsequent commercial method, &#x27;strand sequencing&#x27;, sequenced DNA bases in an intact strand.

Two main areas of nanopore sequencing in development are solid state nanopore sequencing, and protein based nanopore sequencing. Protein nanopore sequencing utilizes membrane protein complexes such as α-hemolysin, MspA (&quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot; Porin A) or CssG, which show great promise given their ability to distinguish between individual and groups of nucleotides. In contrast, solid-state nanopore sequencing utilizes synthetic materials such as silicon nitride and aluminum oxide and it is preferred for its superior mechanical ability and thermal and chemical stability. The fabrication method is essential for this type of sequencing given that the nanopore array can contain hundreds of pores with diameters smaller than eight nanometers.

The concept originated from the idea that single stranded DNA or RNA molecules can be electrophoretically driven in a strict linear sequence through a biological pore that can be less than eight nanometers, and can be detected given that the molecules release an ionic current while moving through the pore. The pore contains a detection region capable of recognizing different bases, with each base generating various time specific signals corresponding to the sequence of bases as they cross the pore which are then evaluated. Precise control over the DNA transport through the pore is crucial for success. Various enzymes such as exonucleases and polymerases have been used to moderate this process by positioning them near the pore&#x27;s entrance.

=== Short-read sequencing methods ===

==== Massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS) ====
The first of the high-throughput sequencing technologies, massively parallel signature sequencing (or MPSS, also called next generation sequencing), was developed in the 1990s at Lynx Therapeutics, a company founded in 1992 by Sydney Brenner and Sam Eletr. MPSS was a bead-based method that used a complex approach of adapter ligation followed by adapter decoding, reading the sequence in increments of four nucleotides. This method made it susceptible to sequence-specific bias or loss of specific sequences. Because the technology was so complex, MPSS was only performed &#x27;in-house&#x27; by Lynx Therapeutics and no DNA sequencing machines were sold to independent laboratories. Lynx Therapeutics merged with Solexa (later acquired by Illumina) in 2004, leading to the development of sequencing-by-synthesis, a simpler approach acquired from Manteia Predictive Medicine, which rendered MPSS obsolete. However, the essential properties of the MPSS output were typical of later high-throughput data types, including hundreds of thousands of short DNA sequences. In the case of MPSS, these were typically used for sequencing cDNA for measurements of gene expression levels.

==== Polony sequencing ====

The polony sequencing method, developed in the laboratory of George M. Church at Harvard, was among the first high-throughput sequencing systems and was used to sequence a full &quot;E. coli&quot; genome in 2005. It combined an in vitro paired-tag library with emulsion PCR, an automated microscope, and ligation-based sequencing chemistry to sequence an &quot;E. coli&quot; genome at an accuracy of &gt;99.9999% and a cost approximately 1/9 that of Sanger sequencing. The technology was licensed to Agencourt Biosciences, subsequently spun out into Agencourt Personal Genomics, and eventually incorporated into the Applied Biosystems SOLiD platform. Applied Biosystems was later acquired by Life Technologies, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific.

==== 454 pyrosequencing ====

A parallelized version of pyrosequencing was developed by 454 Life Sciences, which has since been acquired by Roche Diagnostics. The method amplifies DNA inside water droplets in an oil solution (emulsion PCR), with each droplet containing a single DNA template attached to a single primer-coated bead that then forms a clonal colony. The sequencing machine contains many picoliter-volume wells each containing a single bead and sequencing enzymes. Pyrosequencing uses luciferase to generate light for detection of the individual nucleotides added to the nascent DNA, and the combined data are used to generate sequence reads. This technology provides intermediate read length and price per base compared to Sanger sequencing on one end and Solexa and SOLiD on the other.

==== Illumina (Solexa) sequencing ====

Solexa, now part of Illumina, was founded by Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman in 1998, and developed a sequencing method based on reversible dye-terminators technology, and engineered polymerases. The reversible terminated chemistry concept was invented by Bruno Canard and Simon Sarfati at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. It was developed internally at Solexa by those named on the relevant patents. In 2004, Solexa acquired the company Manteia Predictive Medicine in order to gain a massively parallel sequencing technology invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli. It is based on &quot;DNA clusters&quot; or &quot;DNA colonies&quot;, which involves the clonal amplification of DNA on a surface. The cluster technology was co-acquired with Lynx Therapeutics of California. Solexa Ltd. later merged with Lynx to form Solexa Inc.


In this method, DNA molecules and primers are first attached on a slide or flow cell and amplified with polymerase so that local clonal DNA colonies, later coined &quot;DNA clusters&quot;, are formed. To determine the sequence, four types of reversible terminator bases (RT-bases) are added and non-incorporated nucleotides are washed away. A camera takes images of the fluorescently labeled nucleotides. Then the dye, along with the terminal 3&#x27; blocker, is chemically removed from the DNA, allowing for the next cycle to begin. Unlike pyrosequencing, the DNA chains are extended one nucleotide at a time and image acquisition can be performed at a delayed moment, allowing for very large arrays of DNA colonies to be captured by sequential images taken from a single camera.

Decoupling the enzymatic reaction and the image capture allows for optimal throughput and theoretically unlimited sequencing capacity. With an optimal configuration, the ultimately reachable instrument throughput is thus dictated solely by the analog-to-digital conversion rate of the camera, multiplied by the number of cameras and divided by the number of pixels per DNA colony required for visualizing them optimally (approximately 10 pixels/colony). In 2012, with cameras operating at more than 10 MHz A/D conversion rates and available optics, fluidics and enzymatics, throughput can be multiples of 1 million nucleotides/second, corresponding roughly to 1 human genome equivalent at 1x coverage per hour per instrument, and 1 human genome re-sequenced (at approx. 30x) per day per instrument (equipped with a single camera).

====Combinatorial probe anchor synthesis (cPAS)====

This method is an upgraded modification to combinatorial probe anchor ligation technology (cPAL) described by Complete Genomics which has since become part of Chinese genomics company BGI in 2013. The two companies have refined the technology to allow for longer read lengths, reaction time reductions and faster time to results. In addition, data are now generated as contiguous full-length reads in the standard FASTQ file format and can be used as-is in most short-read-based bioinformatics analysis pipelines.

The two technologies that form the basis for this high-throughput sequencing technology are DNA nanoballs (DNB) and patterned arrays for nanoball attachment to a solid surface. DNA nanoballs are simply formed by denaturing double stranded, adapter ligated libraries and ligating the forward strand only to a splint oligonucleotide to form a ssDNA circle. Faithful copies of the circles containing the DNA insert are produced utilizing Rolling Circle Amplification that generates approximately 300–500 copies. The long strand of ssDNA folds upon itself to produce a three-dimensional nanoball structure that is approximately 220 nm in diameter. Making DNBs replaces the need to generate PCR copies of the library on the flow cell and as such can remove large proportions of duplicate reads, adapter-adapter ligations and PCR induced errors.

The patterned array of positively charged spots is fabricated through photolithography and etching techniques followed by chemical modification to generate a sequencing flow cell. Each spot on the flow cell is approximately 250 nm in diameter, are separated by 700 nm (centre to centre) and allows easy attachment of a single negatively charged DNB to the flow cell and thus reducing under or over-clustering on the flow cell.

Sequencing is then performed by addition of an oligonucleotide probe that attaches in combination to specific sites within the DNB. The probe acts as an anchor that then allows one of four single reversibly inactivated, labelled nucleotides to bind after flowing across the flow cell. Unbound nucleotides are washed away before laser excitation of the attached labels then emit fluorescence and signal is captured by cameras that is converted to a digital output for base calling. The attached base has its terminator and label chemically cleaved at completion of the cycle. The cycle is repeated with another flow of free, labelled nucleotides across the flow cell to allow the next nucleotide to bind and have its signal captured. This process is completed a number of times (usually 50 to 300 times) to determine the sequence of the inserted piece of DNA at a rate of approximately 40 million nucleotides per second as of 2018.

==== SOLiD sequencing ====


Applied Biosystems&#x27; (now a Life Technologies brand) SOLiD technology employs sequencing by ligation. Here, a pool of all possible oligonucleotides of a fixed length are labeled according to the sequenced position. Oligonucleotides are annealed and ligated; the preferential ligation by DNA ligase for matching sequences results in a signal informative of the nucleotide at that position. Each base in the template is sequenced twice, and the resulting data are decoded according to the 2 base encoding scheme used in this method. Before sequencing, the DNA is amplified by emulsion PCR. The resulting beads, each containing single copies of the same DNA molecule, are deposited on a glass slide. The result is sequences of quantities and lengths comparable to Illumina sequencing. This sequencing by ligation method has been reported to have some issue sequencing palindromic sequences.

==== Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing ====

Ion Torrent Systems Inc. (now owned by Life Technologies) developed a system based on using standard sequencing chemistry, but with a novel, semiconductor-based detection system. This method of sequencing is based on the detection of hydrogen ions that are released during the polymerisation of DNA, as opposed to the optical methods used in other sequencing systems. A microwell containing a template DNA strand to be sequenced is flooded with a single type of nucleotide. If the introduced nucleotide is complementary to the leading template nucleotide it is incorporated into the growing complementary strand. This causes the release of a hydrogen ion that triggers a hypersensitive ion sensor, which indicates that a reaction has occurred. If homopolymer repeats are present in the template sequence, multiple nucleotides will be incorporated in a single cycle. This leads to a corresponding number of released hydrogens and a proportionally higher electronic signal.

==== DNA nanoball sequencing ====

DNA nanoball sequencing is a type of high throughput sequencing technology used to determine the entire genomic sequence of an organism. The company Complete Genomics uses this technology to sequence samples submitted by independent researchers. The method uses rolling circle replication to amplify small fragments of genomic DNA into DNA nanoballs. Unchained sequencing by ligation is then used to determine the nucleotide sequence. This method of DNA sequencing allows large numbers of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced per run and at low reagent costs compared to other high-throughput sequencing platforms. However, only short sequences of DNA are determined from each DNA nanoball which makes mapping the short reads to a reference genome difficult.

==== Heliscope single molecule sequencing ====
Heliscope sequencing is a method of single-molecule sequencing developed by Helicos Biosciences. It uses DNA fragments with added poly-A tail adapters which are attached to the flow cell surface. The next steps involve extension-based sequencing with cyclic washes of the flow cell with fluorescently labeled nucleotides (one nucleotide type at a time, as with the Sanger method). The reads are performed by the Heliscope sequencer. The reads are short, averaging 35 bp. What made this technology especially novel was that it was the first of its class to sequence non-amplified DNA, thus preventing any read errors associated with amplification steps. In 2009 a human genome was sequenced using the Heliscope, however in 2012 the company went bankrupt.

==== Microfluidic Systems ====
There are two main microfluidic systems that are used to sequence DNA; droplet based microfluidics and digital microfluidics. Microfluidic devices solve many of the current limitations of current sequencing arrays.

Abate et al. studied the use of droplet-based microfluidic devices for DNA sequencing. These devices have the ability to form and process picoliter sized droplets at the rate of thousands per second. The devices were created from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and used Forster resonance energy transfer, FRET assays to read the sequences of DNA encompassed in the droplets. Each position on the array tested for a specific 15 base sequence.

Fair et al. used digital microfluidic devices to study DNA pyrosequencing. Significant advantages include the portability of the device, reagent volume, speed of analysis, mass manufacturing abilities, and high throughput. This study provided a proof of concept showing that digital devices can be used for pyrosequencing; the study included using synthesis, which involves the extension of the enzymes and addition of labeled nucleotides.

Boles et al. also studied pyrosequencing on digital microfluidic devices. They used an electro-wetting device to create, mix, and split droplets. The sequencing uses a three-enzyme protocol and DNA templates anchored with magnetic beads. The device was tested using two protocols and resulted in 100% accuracy based on raw pyrogram levels. The advantages of these digital microfluidic devices include size, cost, and achievable levels of functional integration.

DNA sequencing research, using microfluidics, also has the ability to be applied to the sequencing of RNA, using similar droplet microfluidic techniques, such as the method, inDrops. This shows that many of these DNA sequencing techniques will be able to be applied further and be used to understand more about genomes and transcriptomes.

== Methods in development ==
DNA sequencing methods currently under development include reading the sequence as a DNA strand transits through nanopores (a method that is now commercial but subsequent generations such as solid-state nanopores are still in development), and microscopy-based techniques, such as atomic force microscopy or transmission electron microscopy that are used to identify the positions of individual nucleotides within long DNA fragments (&gt;5,000 bp) by nucleotide labeling with heavier elements (e.g., halogens) for visual detection and recording.
Third generation technologies aim to increase throughput and decrease the time to result and cost by eliminating the need for excessive reagents and harnessing the processivity of DNA polymerase.

=== Tunnelling currents DNA sequencing ===
Another approach uses measurements of the electrical tunnelling currents across single-strand DNA as it moves through a channel. Depending on its electronic structure, each base affects the tunnelling current differently, allowing differentiation between different bases.

The use of tunnelling currents has the potential to sequence orders of magnitude faster than ionic current methods and the sequencing of several DNA oligomers and micro-RNA has already been achieved.

=== Sequencing by hybridization ===
&quot;Sequencing by hybridization&quot; is a non-enzymatic method that uses a DNA microarray. A single pool of DNA whose sequence is to be determined is fluorescently labeled and hybridized to an array containing known sequences. Strong hybridization signals from a given spot on the array identifies its sequence in the DNA being sequenced.

This method of sequencing utilizes binding characteristics of a library of short single stranded DNA molecules (oligonucleotides), also called DNA probes, to reconstruct a target DNA sequence. Non-specific hybrids are removed by washing and the target DNA is eluted. Hybrids are re-arranged such that the DNA sequence can be reconstructed. The benefit of this sequencing type is its ability to capture a large number of targets with a homogenous coverage. A large number of chemicals and starting DNA is usually required. However, with the advent of solution-based hybridization, much less equipment and chemicals are necessary.

=== Sequencing with mass spectrometry ===
Mass spectrometry may be used to determine DNA sequences. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, or MALDI-TOF MS, has specifically been investigated as an alternative method to gel electrophoresis for visualizing DNA fragments. With this method, DNA fragments generated by chain-termination sequencing reactions are compared by mass rather than by size. The mass of each nucleotide is different from the others and this difference is detectable by mass spectrometry. Single-nucleotide mutations in a fragment can be more easily detected with MS than by gel electrophoresis alone. MALDI-TOF MS can more easily detect differences between RNA fragments, so researchers may indirectly sequence DNA with MS-based methods by converting it to RNA first.

The higher resolution of DNA fragments permitted by MS-based methods is of special interest to researchers in forensic science, as they may wish to find single-nucleotide polymorphisms in human DNA samples to identify individuals. These samples may be highly degraded so forensic researchers often prefer mitochondrial DNA for its higher stability and applications for lineage studies. MS-based sequencing methods have been used to compare the sequences of human mitochondrial DNA from samples in a Federal Bureau of Investigation database and from bones found in mass graves of World War I soldiers.

Early chain-termination and TOF MS methods demonstrated read lengths of up to 100 base pairs. Researchers have been unable to exceed this average read size; like chain-termination sequencing alone, MS-based DNA sequencing may not be suitable for large &quot;de novo&quot; sequencing projects. Even so, a recent study did use the short sequence reads and mass spectroscopy to compare single-nucleotide polymorphisms in pathogenic &quot;Streptococcus&quot; strains.

=== Microfluidic Sanger sequencing ===

In microfluidic Sanger sequencing the entire thermocycling amplification of DNA fragments as well as their separation by electrophoresis is done on a single glass wafer (approximately 10 cm in diameter) thus reducing the reagent usage as well as cost. In some instances researchers have shown that they can increase the throughput of conventional sequencing through the use of microchips. Research will still need to be done in order to make this use of technology effective.

=== Microscopy-based techniques ===

This approach directly visualizes the sequence of DNA molecules using electron microscopy. The first identification of DNA base pairs within intact DNA molecules by enzymatically incorporating modified bases, which contain atoms of increased atomic number, direct visualization and identification of individually labeled bases within a synthetic 3,272 base-pair DNA molecule and a 7,249 base-pair viral genome has been demonstrated.

=== RNAP sequencing ===
This method is based on use of RNA polymerase (RNAP), which is attached to a polystyrene bead. One end of DNA to be sequenced is attached to another bead, with both beads being placed in optical traps. RNAP motion during transcription brings the beads in closer and their relative distance changes, which can then be recorded at a single nucleotide resolution. The sequence is deduced based on the four readouts with lowered concentrations of each of the four nucleotide types, similarly to the Sanger method. A comparison is made between regions and sequence information is deduced by comparing the known sequence regions to the unknown sequence regions.

=== &quot;In vitro&quot; virus high-throughput sequencing ===
A method has been developed to analyze full sets of protein interactions using a combination of 454 pyrosequencing and an &quot;in vitro&quot; virus mRNA display method. Specifically, this method covalently links proteins of interest to the mRNAs encoding them, then detects the mRNA pieces using reverse transcription PCRs. The mRNA may then be amplified and sequenced. The combined method was titled IVV-HiTSeq and can be performed under cell-free conditions, though its results may not be representative of &quot;in vivo&quot; conditions.

== Market share ==
While there are many different ways to sequence DNA, only a few dominate the market. In 2022, Illumina had about 80% of the market; the rest of the market is taken by only a few players (PacBio, Oxford, 454, MGI)

== Sample preparation ==
The success of any DNA sequencing protocol relies upon the DNA or RNA sample extraction and preparation from the biological material of interest.
* A successful DNA extraction will yield a DNA sample with long, non-degraded strands. 
* A successful RNA extraction will yield a RNA sample that should be converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) using reverse transcriptase—a DNA polymerase that synthesizes a complementary DNA based on existing strands of RNA in a PCR-like manner. Complementary DNA can then be processed the same way as genomic DNA.

After DNA or RNA extraction, samples may require further preparation depending on the sequencing method. For Sanger sequencing, either cloning procedures or PCR are required prior to sequencing. In the case of next-generation sequencing methods, library preparation is required before processing. Assessing the quality and quantity of nucleic acids both after extraction and after library preparation identifies degraded, fragmented, and low-purity samples and yields high-quality sequencing data.

== Development initiatives ==

In October 2006, the X Prize Foundation established an initiative to promote the development of full genome sequencing technologies, called the Archon X Prize, intending to award $10 million to &quot;the first Team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $10,000 (US) per genome.&quot;

Each year the National Human Genome Research Institute, or NHGRI, promotes grants for new research and developments in genomics. 2010 grants and 2011 candidates include continuing work in microfluidic, polony and base-heavy sequencing methodologies.

== Computational challenges ==
The sequencing technologies described here produce raw data that needs to be assembled into longer sequences such as complete genomes (sequence assembly). There are many computational challenges to achieve this, such as the evaluation of the raw sequence data which is done by programs and algorithms such as Phred and Phrap. Other challenges have to deal with repetitive sequences that often prevent complete genome assemblies because they occur in many places of the genome. As a consequence, many sequences may not be assigned to particular chromosomes. The production of raw sequence data is only the beginning of its detailed bioinformatical analysis. Yet new methods for sequencing and correcting sequencing errors were developed.

=== Read trimming ===
Sometimes, the raw reads produced by the sequencer are correct and precise only in a fraction of their length. Using the entire read may introduce artifacts in the downstream analyses like genome assembly, SNP calling, or gene expression estimation. Two classes of trimming programs have been introduced, based on the window-based or the running-sum classes of algorithms. This is a partial list of the trimming algorithms currently available, specifying the algorithm class they belong to:

== Ethical issues ==
Human genetics have been included within the field of bioethics since the early 1970s and the growth in the use of DNA sequencing (particularly high-throughput sequencing) has introduced a number of ethical issues. One key issue is the ownership of an individual&#x27;s DNA and the data produced when that DNA is sequenced. Regarding the DNA molecule itself, the leading legal case on this topic, &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot; (1990) ruled that individuals have no property rights to discarded cells or any profits made using these cells (for instance, as a patented cell line). However, individuals have a right to informed consent regarding removal and use of cells. Regarding the data produced through DNA sequencing, &quot;Moore&quot; gives the individual no rights to the information derived from their DNA.

As DNA sequencing becomes more widespread, the storage, security and sharing of genomic data has also become more important. For instance, one concern is that insurers may use an individual&#x27;s genomic data to modify their quote, depending on the perceived future health of the individual based on their DNA. In May 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was signed in the United States, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to health insurance and employment. In 2012, the US Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues reported that existing privacy legislation for DNA sequencing data such as GINA and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act were insufficient, noting that whole-genome sequencing data was particularly sensitive, as it could be used to identify not only the individual from which the data was created, but also their relatives.

In most of the United States, DNA that is &quot;abandoned&quot;, such as that found on a licked stamp or envelope, coffee cup, cigarette, chewing gum, household trash, or hair that has fallen on a public sidewalk, may legally be collected and sequenced by anyone, including the police, private investigators, political opponents, or people involved in paternity disputes. As of 2013, eleven states have laws that can be interpreted to prohibit &quot;DNA theft&quot;.

Ethical issues have also been raised by the increasing use of genetic variation screening, both in newborns, and in adults by companies such as 23andMe. It has been asserted that screening for genetic variations can be harmful, increasing anxiety in individuals who have been found to have an increased risk of disease. For example, in one case noted in &quot;Time&quot;, doctors screening an ill baby for genetic variants chose not to inform the parents of an unrelated variant linked to dementia due to the harm it would cause to the parents. However, a 2011 study in &quot;The New England Journal of Medicine&quot; has shown that individuals undergoing disease risk profiling did not show increased levels of anxiety. Also, the development of Next Generation sequencing technologies such as Nanopore based sequencing has also raised further ethical concerns.

<text>Freely redistributable software (FRS) is software that anyone is free to redistribute. The term has been used to mean two types of free to redistribute software, distinguished by the legal modifiability and limitations on purpose of use of the software. FRS which can be legally modified and used for any purpose is the same as free software. Non-legally modifiable FRS is freeware, shareware or similar.

The non-modifiable FRS generally comes in the form of executable binaries and is often used by proprietary software companies and authors to showcase their work or to encourage the user to buy full products from them (in the case of shareware, demo or trial versions). Freeware that is not restricted to be obtained from a specific distributor is also FRS.

==Firmware and microcode==
In cases of firmware or microcode, it is acceptable for major open-source projects like OpenBSD to include a binary firmware of a device within the distribution, as long as said firmware runs only on the external device in question, and not on the main CPU where the operating system itself is running.
However, for such an inclusion to be in place, the binary firmware must be distributed under an adequate licence, like ISC or BSD, and must not require a discriminatory contract to be in place.
A lack of such licence is why wireless devices from Intel Corporation do not work out of the box in almost all open-source distributions, whereas Ralink wireless cards work just fine.

== History of Zimbabwe as a Nation==

The Legacy of a Nation: Delving into the Rich History of Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe, a name that conjours images of sprawling savannahs, majestic wildlife, and the enigmatic ruins of an ancient city, is a country with a deeply layered past. From its precolonial prosperity and complexity to the trials of colonialism and the eventual tumult of independence and beyond, Zimbabwe&#x27;s history is a profound story of resilience, endurance, and transformation. In this article, we shall traverse the historical landscape of Zimbabwe, exploring its storied past and the indelible imprint it has left on the present.

The roots of Zimbabwean civilisation stretch far back in time, weaving a tapestry of cultural and political innovation. The tale begins with the Bantu-speaking farmers, who, during the Iron Age, traversed the Limpopo River, infusing the region with new agricultural techniques and ironworking skills (Beach, 1994). These migrants forged the foundation of early Zimbabwe, a cultural legacy evidenced today by the imposing stone walls of Great Zimbabwe, an architectural marvel that stood as the nerve centre of an influential precolonial state, flourishing between the 11th and 15th centuries (Fontein, 2006).

Great Zimbabwe, which gave the modern nation its name, was a political and economic powerhouse, its influence rippling throughout Southern Africa. The city was part of an extensive trading network, exchanging gold, ivory, copper, and iron for luxury goods from as far afield as China and the Persian Gulf, a testament to the globalised world of medieval commerce (Chirikure, 2018). Its ruins, which remain amongst the largest stone structures in Southern Africa, embody the zenith of precolonial Zimbabwean cultural and architectural sophistication.

The arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century marked the beginning of foreign intervention in Zimbabwe. Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries penetrated the hinterland, seeking gold and converts, respectively, but it was not until the late 19th century that European incursions had a seismic impact on the region. The advent of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes and his British South Africa Company heralded a new era, as his charter with Queen Victoria granted the company comprehensive administrative and economic control over the region - a stark departure from the sovereignty known by the likes of Great Zimbabwe (Palmer, 1977).

Rhodes&#x27; legacy is fraught with controversy, emblematic of the era&#x27;s imperialism and the grievous repercussions for indigenous populations. Land was appropriated, local governance structures undermined, and the native Shona and Ndebele peoples consigned to an existence of subjugation and exploitation (Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2009). The forced labour and taxation policies imposed by the British South Africa Company fomented discontent, culminating in the Chimurenga, or First War of Liberation, a vehement but ultimately vanquished resistance against colonial rule (Ranger, 1985).

Fast forward to the 20th century, and Zimbabwe&#x27;s quest for independence intensified. The 1960s and 70s were decades of convulsion, as African nationalist movements challeneged colonial rule throughout the continent. In Rhodesia, as Zimbabwe was then known, two main liberation movements, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU), orchestrated a protracted guerrilla warfare against the minority white government led by Ian Smith, who had unilaterally declared independence from Britain in 1965 in a bid to prevent black majority rule (Meredith, 2002).

The Liberation War, or Second Chimurenga, was bitter and prolonged, with neighbouring countries providing sanctuary and support for Zimbabwean nationalists. The conflict wore on until the Lancaster House Agreement was signed in 1979, a negotiated settlement that finally paved the way for free elections and the establishment of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980, with ZANU leader Robert Mugabe assuming the mantle of Prime Minister (Sibanda, 2005).

The independent era of Zimbabwe has been one of both hope and hardship. Initially, Mugabe implemented policies of reconciliation, infrastructure development, and education, culminating in significant advancements and a burgeoning economy. However, in the subsequent years, political repression grew, economic mismanagement took its toll, and the controversial land reform program at the turn of the millennium led to international sanctions, hyperinflation, and a dramatic decline in living standards (Raftopoulos &amp; Mlambo, 2009). Despite these challenges, Zimbabweans have demonstrated remarkable fortitude, contributing to the arts, sport, and academia with steadfast vigour.

In conclusion, the history of Zimbabwe is one of great achievements and equally profound challenges. Its early societies set the stage for a state that would withstand the test of time. The colonial experience, while devastating, did not obliterate the enduring spirit of the Zimbabwean people. Independence, hard-fought and dearly won, has meant navigating the complexities of self-governance, grappling with legacies of inequality, and contending with the pressures of global politics. As Zimbabwe continues to evolve, its history remains a mirror through which its future is both reflected and shaped.

== Language ==

Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, Chewa, Chibarwe, English, Kalanga, &quot;Koisan&quot; (presumably Tsoa), Nambya, Ndau, Ndebele, Shangani, Shona, &quot;sign language&quot; (Zimbabwean sign languages), Sotho, Tonga, Tswana, Venda, and Xhosa. Much of the population speaks Bantu languages, such as Shona (chishona) (76%) and Ndebele (18%). Shona has a rich oral tradition, which was incorporated into the first Shona novel, &quot;Feso&quot; by Solomon Mutswairo, published in 1957. English is spoken primarily in the cities, but less so in rural areas. Education in Zimbabwe is taught in English, Shona and Ndebele. Many rural primary schools teach in the native language until grade three; then, school is taught in English.

== Food ==

Like in many African countries, a majority of Zimbabweans depend on staple foods. &quot;Mealie meal&quot;, or cornmeal as it is known in other parts of the world, is used to prepare &quot;bota&quot;, a porridge made by mixing cornmeal with water, to make a thick paste. This is usually flavored with butter or peanut butter. Bota is usually eaten for breakfast. Cornmeal is also used to make &quot;sadza&quot;, which is usually eaten for dinner, and by many for lunch too. The process of making sadza is similar to bota, however after the paste has been cooking for several minutes, more cornmeal is added to thicken the paste until it is firm. This meal is usually served with vegetables (spinach, chou moellier, or spring greens/collard greens), beans, and meat (stewed, grilled, roasted, or sundried). Sadza is also commonly eaten with &quot;boerewors&quot; (a sausage made from beef or pork), chicken, or curdled milk (sour milk), commonly known as &quot;lacto&quot; (&quot;mukaka wakakora or &quot;amasi&quot;&quot;). Rice and chicken with coleslaw salad is often served as the main meal. Graduations, weddings, and any other family gatherings will usually be celebrated with the killing of a goat, sheep, or cow, which will be &quot;braaied&quot; (or barbecued) for the gathered family.

Since Zimbabwe was a British colony, they have adopted some English habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, however they will still have 10 o&#x27;clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, which can be leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked &quot;sadza&quot;, or sandwiches (which is more common in the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o&#x27;clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.

== Art ==
Traditional arts in Zimbabwe include pottery, basketry, textiles, jewelry and carving. Among the distinctive qualities are symmetrically patterned woven baskets and stools carved out of a single piece of wood. Shona sculpture in modern times has become a fusion of African folklore with European influences. It is widely respected across the globe and it itself has had an impact on the global sculpture scene since at least the 1980s. A recurring theme in Zimbabwean art is the metamorphosis of man into beast. Cartwark, M. is of the view that, &quot;A number of finely carved soapstone figures have been found which include eight representations of birds perched on monoliths over one metre (39 inches) in height. The bird is known as the Zimbabwe Bird and does not resemble any bird in nature; it appears on the flag of the country today. Such artefacts as the soapstone figures hint at the ritual nature of the Great Zimbabwe site. Other sculptures include cattle and nude highly-stylised female figures. Simple unglazed pottery of very good quality was produced - very often given a graphite covering and then polished. Forms include gourd-shaped vessels with distinctive hatched triangular decorations, small disks of uncertain purpose, and models of huts.&quot;

Among members of the white minority community, theatre has a large following, with numerous theatrical companies performing in Zimbabwe&#x27;s urban areas.

The country&#x27;s art is admired by those that know of its existence, and several Zimbabwean artists have managed to gain a world audience. To name some world-famous Zimbabwean sculptors, we have Nicholas, Nesbert and Anderson Mukomberanwa, Tapfuma Gutsa, Henry Munyaradzi, and Locardia Ndandarika. Internationally, Zimbabwean sculptors have managed to influence a new generation of artists, particularly African Americans, through lengthy apprenticeships with master sculptors in Zimbabwe. Contemporary artists, including New York sculptor M. Scott Johnson and California sculptor Russel Albans have learned to fuse both African and Afro-diasporic aesthetics in a way that travels beyond the simplistic mimicry of African Art by some Black artists of past generations in the United States.

Zimbabwe&#x27;s cultural wall is the durawall.

<doc id="1158140" wikidata="Q138602" url="?curid=1158140" title="Phacopida">
<text>Phacopida (&quot;lens-face&quot;) is an order of trilobites that lived from the Late Cambrian to the Late Devonian. It is made up of a morphologically diverse assemblage of taxa in three related suborders.

== Characteristics ==
Phacopida had 8 to 19 thoracic segments and are distinguishable by the expanded glabella, short or absent preglabellar area, and schizochroal (Phacopina) or holochroal (Cheirurina and Calymenina) eyes. Schizochroal eyes are compound eyes with up to around 700 separate lenses. Each lens has an individual cornea which extended into a rather large sclera.

The development of schizochroal eyes in phacopid trilobites is an example of post-displacement paedomorphosis. The eyes of immature holochroal Cambrian trilobites were basically miniature schizochroal eyes. In Phacopida, these were retained, via delayed growth of these immature structures (post-displacement), into the adult form.

&quot;Eldredgeops rana&quot; (Phacopidae) and &quot;Dalmanites limulurus&quot; (Dalmanitidae) are two of the best-known members of this order. Other known phacopids include &quot;Cheirurus&quot; (Cheiruridae), &quot;Deiphon&quot; (Cheiruridae), &quot;Calymene&quot; (Calymenidae), &quot;Flexicalymene&quot; (Calymenidae) and &quot;Ceraurinella&quot; (Cheiruridae).

== Evolution ==
The origin of the order Phacopida is uncertain. It comprises three suborders (Phacopina, Calymenina, and Cheirurina) which share a distinctive protaspis (unsegmented larva ) with three pairs of spines on its body. The Cheirurina and Calymenina retain a rostral plate (an apomorphy) but in virtually all Phacopina the free cheeks are yoked as a single piece. This sort of similarity in development suggests phylogenetic unity. The suborder Calymenina is the most primitive of the Phacopida order and shares some characteristics with the order Ptychopariida, though it is not included in the subclass Librostoma.

Phacopida was one of only two trilobite orders (along with the Proetida) to survive the Kellwasser event (Late Devonian extinction) at the Frasnian-Famennian boundary. However, they would die out soon afterwards at the Hangenberg event (end-Devonian extinction) at the end of the Famennian.

<doc id="1158145" wikidata="Q1601331" url="?curid=1158145" title="Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format">
<text>Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format or TNEF is a proprietary email attachment format used by Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server. An attached file with TNEF encoding is most often named &quot;winmail.dat&quot; or &quot;win.dat&quot;, and has a MIME type of &quot;Application/MS-TNEF&quot;.
The official (IANA) media type, however, is &quot;application/vnd.ms-tnef&quot;.

== Overview ==
Some TNEF files contain information used only by Outlook to generate a richly formatted view of the message, such as embedded (OLE) documents or Outlook-specific features such as forms, voting buttons, and meeting requests. Other TNEF files may contain files which have been attached to an e-mail message.

Within the Outlook e-mail client, TNEF encoding cannot be explicitly enabled or disabled (except via a registry setting). Selecting RTF as the format for sending an e-mail implicitly enables TNEF encoding, using it instead of the more common and widely compatible MIME standard. When sending plain text or HTML format messages, some versions of Outlook (apparently including Outlook 2000) prefer MIME, but may still use TNEF under some circumstances (for example, if an Outlook feature requires it).

TNEF attachments can contain security-sensitive information such as user login name and file paths, from which access controls could possibly be inferred.

== Exchange Server ==

Native-mode Microsoft Exchange 2000 organizations will, in some circumstances, send entire messages as TNEF-encoded raw binary independent of what is advertised by the receiving SMTP server. As documented in Microsoft KBA #323483, this technique is not RFC-compliant because these messages have the following characteristics:
* They may include non-ASCII characters outside the 0–127 US-ASCII range.
* The lines in these messages are often too long for transport via SMTP.
* They do not follow the CRLF.CRLF message termination semantics as specified in RFC 821.

Internal communications between Exchange Servers (2000 and later) over SMTP encode the message in S/TNEF (Summary TNEF) format. The conversion between the format needed by the end client on the Internet is performed on the last Hub Transport server before final delivery, and when the Hub Transport role of an Exchange Server is about to deliver the message to a mailbox role server, the message is converted to MAPI format for storage.

S/TNEF differs from TNEF in that it is 8-bit (not 7-bit for TNEF) and does not contain a plain-text portion.

==Decoding==
Programs to decode and extract files from TNEF-encoded attachments are available on many platforms.

===Multiplatform===
* Geary (email client) supports TNEF since version 3.33.1
* TNEF Parse – Claws Mail plugin
* LookOut or its successor LookOut (fix version) – Mozilla Thunderbird extension. See also:

** Bug 77811 – Inline viewer for Microsoft proprietary mail formats, a 21-plus-year-old bug report at the Mozilla Bugzilla
* Wireshark – Version 1.2 and later can open and dissect winmail.dat files, although it is not useful as a mail reader
* KTNEF – LGPL TNEF extractor by KDE

===Unix-like or POSIX command-line===
* yTNEF – GPL TNEF extractor from the POSIX command-line, designed specifically for reading winmail.dat
* TNEF – GPL TNEF extractor from the POSIX command-line

===Mac===
* Klammer – Shareware for Mac OS X, available on App store; also supports MSG files

<text>Canadian syllabic writing, or simply syllabics, is a family of writing systems used in a number of indigenous Canadian languages of the Algonquian, Inuit, and (formerly) Athabaskan language families. These languages had no formal writing system previously. They are valued for their distinctiveness from the Latin script and for the ease with which literacy can be achieved. For instance, by the late 19th century the Cree had achieved what may have been one of the highest rates of literacy in the world. Syllabics are an abugida, where glyphs represent consonant–vowel pairs, determined by the rotation of the glyphs. They derive from the work of linguist and missionary James Evans.

Canadian syllabics are currently used to write all of the Cree languages from including Eastern Cree, Plains Cree, Swampy Cree, Woods Cree, and Naskapi. They are also used to write Inuktitut in the Canadian Arctic; there they are co-official with the Latin script in the territory of Nunavut. They are used regionally for the other large Canadian Algonquian language, Ojibwe, as well as for Blackfoot. Among the Athabaskan languages further to the west, syllabics have been used at one point or another to write Dakelh (Carrier), Chipewyan, Slavey, Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib), and Dane-zaa (Beaver). Syllabics have occasionally been used in the United States by communities that straddle the border.

==History==

Cree syllabics were created in a process that culminated in 1840 by James Evans, a missionary, probably in collaboration with Indigenous language experts. Evans formalized them for Swampy Cree and Ojibwe. Evans had been inspired by the success of Sequoyah&#x27;s Cherokee syllabary after encountering problems with Latin-based alphabets, and drew on his knowledge of Devanagari and Pitman shorthand. Canadian syllabics would in turn influence the Pollard script, which is used to write various Hmong-Mien and Lolo-Burmese languages. Other missionaries were reluctant to use it, but it was rapidly indigenized and spread to new communities before missionaries arrived.

A conflicting account is recorded in Cree oral traditions, asserting that the script originated from Cree culture before 1840. Per these traditions, syllabics were the invention of Calling Badger (, ), a Cree man. Legend states that Badger had died and returned from the spirit world to share the knowledge of writing with his people. Some scholars write that these legends were created after 1840. Cree scholar Winona Stevenson explores the possibility that the inspiration for Cree syllabics may have originated from a near-death experience of Calling Badger. Stevenson references Fine Day cited in David G. Mandelbaum&#x27;s &quot;The Plains Cree&quot; who states that he learned the syllabary from Strikes-him-on-the-back who learned it directly from Calling Badger.

===James Evans===

In 1827, Evans, a missionary from Kingston upon Hull, England, was placed in charge of the Wesleyan mission at Rice Lake, Ontario. Here, he began to learn the eastern Ojibwe language spoken in the area and was part of a committee to devise a Latin alphabet for it. By 1837, he had prepared the &quot;Speller and Interpreter in English and Indian,&quot; but was unable to get its printing sanctioned by the British and Foreign Bible Society. At the time, many missionary societies were opposed to the development of native literacy in their own languages, believing that their situation would be bettered by linguistic assimilation into colonial society.

Evans continued to use his Ojibwe orthography in his work in Ontario. As was common at the time, the orthography called for hyphens between the syllables of words, giving written Ojibwe a partially syllabic structure. However, his students appear to have had conceptual difficulties using the same alphabet for two different languages with very different sounds, and Evans himself found this approach awkward. Furthermore, the Ojibwe language was polysynthetic but had few distinct syllables, meaning that most words had a large number of syllables; this made them quite long when written with the Latin script. He began to experiment with creating a more syllabic script that he thought might be less awkward for his students to use.

In 1840, Evans was relocated to Norway House in northern Manitoba. Here he began learning the local Swampy Cree dialect. Like the closely related Ojibwe, it was full of long polysyllabic words.

As an amateur linguist, Evans was acquainted with the Devanagari script used in British India; in Devanagari, each letter stands for a syllable, and is modified to represent the vowel of that syllable. Such a system, now called an abugida, would have readily lent itself to writing a language such as Swampy Cree, which had a simple syllable structure of only eight consonants and four long or short vowels. Evans was also familiar with British shorthand, presumably Samuel Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Universal Stenography,&quot; from his days as a merchant in England; and now he acquired familiarity with the newly published Pitman shorthand of 1837.

===Adoption and use===
The local Cree community quickly took to this new writing system. Cree people began to use it to write messages on tree bark using burnt sticks, leaving messages out on hunting trails far from the mission. Evans believed that it was well adapted to Native Canadian languages, particularly the Algonquian languages with which he was familiar. He claimed that &quot;with some slight alterations&quot; it could be used to write &quot;every language from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains.&quot;

Evans attempted to secure a printing press and new type to publish materials in this writing system. Here, he began to face resistance from colonial and European authorities. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, which had a monopoly on foreign commerce in western Canada, refused to import a press for him, believing that native literacy was something to be discouraged. Evans, with immense difficulty, constructed his own press and type and began publishing in syllabics.
Evans left Canada in 1846 and died shortly thereafter. However, the ease and utility of syllabic writing ensured its continued survival, despite European resistance to supporting it. In 1849, David Anderson, the Anglican bishop of Rupert&#x27;s Land, reported that &quot;a few of the Indians can read by means of these syllabic characters; but if they had only been taught to read their own language in our letters, it would have been one step towards the acquisition of the English tongue.&quot; But syllabics had taken root among the Cree (indeed, their rate of literacy was greater than that of English and French Canadians), and in 1861, fifteen years after Evans had died, the British and Foreign Bible Society published a Bible in Cree syllabics. By then, both Protestant and Catholic missionaries were using and actively propagating syllabic writing.

Missionary work in the 1850s and 1860s spread syllabics to western Canadian Ojibwe dialects (Plains Ojibwe and Saulteaux), but it was not often used over the border by Ojibwe in the United States. Missionaries who had learned Evans&#x27; system spread it east across Ontario and into Quebec, reaching all Cree language areas as far east as the Naskapi. Attikamekw, Montagnais and Innu people in eastern Quebec and Labrador use Latin alphabets.

In 1856, John Horden, an Anglican missionary at Moose Factory, Ontario, who adapted syllabics to the local James Bay Cree dialect, met a group of Inuit from the region of Grande Rivière de la Baleine in northern Quebec. They were very interested in adapting Cree syllabics to their language. He prepared a few based on their pronunciation of Inuktitut, but it quickly became obvious that the number of basic sounds and the simple model of the syllable in the Evans system was inadequate to the language. With the assistance of Edwin Arthur Watkins, he dramatically modified syllabics to reflect these needs.

In 1876, the Anglican church hired Edmund Peck to work full-time in their mission at Great Whale River, teaching syllabics to the Inuit and translating materials into syllabics. His work across the Arctic is usually credited with the establishment of syllabics among the Inuit. With the support of both Anglican and Catholic missionary societies, by the beginning of the 20th century the Inuit were propagating syllabics themselves.

In the 1880s, John William Tims, an Anglican missionary from Great Britain, invented a number of new forms to write the Blackfoot language.

French Roman Catholic missionaries were the primary force for expanding syllabics to Athabaskan languages in the late 19th century. The Oblate missionary order was particularly active in using syllabics in missionary work. Oblate father Adrien-Gabriel Morice adapted syllabics to Dakelh, inventing a large number of new basic characters to support the radically more complicated phonetics of Athabaskan languages. Father Émile Petitot developed syllabic scripts for many of the Athabaskan languages of the Northwest Territories, including Slavey and Chipewyan.

Cree influenced the design of the Pollard script in China.

=== Cree oral traditions ===
Cree oral traditions state that the script was gifted to the Cree through the spirit world, rather than being invented by a missionary.

In the 1930s, Chief Fine Day of the Sweetgrass First Nation told Mandelbaum the following account:
A Wood Cree named Badger-call died and then became alive again. While he was dead he was given the characters of the syllabary and told that with them he could write Cree. Strike-him-on-the-back learned this writing from Badger-call. He made a feast and announced that he would teach it to anyone who wanted to learn. That is how I learned it. Badger-call also taught the writing to the missionaries. When the writing was given to Badger-call he was told &#x27;They [the missionaries] will change the script and will say that the writing belongs to them. But only those who know Cree will be able to read it.&#x27; That is how we know that the writing does not belong to the whites, for it can be read only by those who know the Cree language.

Fine Day&#x27;s grandson Wes Fineday gave the following account on CBC radio Morningside in two interviews in 1994 and 1998:
Fineday the younger explained that Calling Badger came from the Stanley Mission area and lived ten to fifteen years before his grandfather&#x27;s birth in 1846. On his way to a sacred society meeting one evening Calling Badger and two singers came upon a bright light and all three fell to the ground. Out of the light came a voice speaking Calling Badger&#x27;s name. Soon after, Calling Badger fell ill and the people heard he had passed away. During his wake three days later, while preparing to roll him in buffalo robes for the funeral, the people discovered that his body was not stiff like a dead person&#x27;s body should be. Against all customs and tradition the people agreed to the widow&#x27;s request to let the body sit one more night. The next day Calling Badger&#x27;s body was still not stiff so the old people began rubbing his back and chest. Soon his eyes opened and he told the people he had gone to the Fourth World, the spirit world, and there the spirits taught him many things. Calling Badger told the people of the things he was shown that prophesized events in the future, then he pulled out some pieces of birch bark with symbols on them. These symbols, he told the people, were to be used to write down the spirit languages, and for the Cree people to communicate among themselves. (Stevenson 20)

When asked whether the story was meant to be understood literally, Wes Fineday commented: &quot;The sacred stories ... are not designed necessarily to provide answers but merely to begin to point out directions that can be taken. ... Understand that it is not the work of storytellers to bring answers to you. ... What we can do is we can tell you stories and if you listen to those stories in the sacred manner with an open heart, an open mind, open eyes and open ears, those stories will speak to you.&quot;

In December 1959, anthropologist Verne Dusenberry, while among the Plains Cree on the Rocky Boy reservation in Montana, was told a similar narrative by Raining Bird:

According to Raining Bird &quot;the spirits came to one good man and gave him some songs. When he mastered them, they taught him how to make a type of ink and then showed him how to write on white birch bark.&quot; He also received many teachings about the spirits which he recorded in a birch bark book. When the one good man returned to his people he taught them how to read and write. &quot;The Cree were very pleased with their new accomplishment, for by now the white men were in this country. The Cree knew that the white traders could read and write, so now they felt that they too were able to communicate among themselves just as well as did their white neighbors.&quot; (Stevenson 21)

Stevenson (aka Wheeler) comments that the legend is commonly known among the Cree. However, there is no known surviving physical evidence of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics before Norway House.

Linguist Chris Harvey believes that the syllabics were a collaboration between English missionaries and Indigenous Cree- and Ojibwe-language experts, Such as the Ojibwe Henry Bird Steinhauer (Sowengisik) and Cree translator Sophie Mason, who worked alongside Evans at his time in Norway House.

==Basic principles==
Canadian &quot;syllabic&quot; scripts are not syllabaries, in which every consonant–vowel sequence has a separate glyph, but abugidas, in which consonants are modified in order to indicate an associated vowel—in this case through a change in orientation (which is unique to Canadian syllabics). In Cree, for example, the consonant &quot;p&quot; has the shape of a chevron; in an upward orientation, ᐱ, it transcribes the syllable &quot;pi&quot;; inverted, so that it points downwards, ᐯ, it transcribes &quot;pe&quot;; pointing to the left, ᐸ, it is &quot;pa,&quot; and to the right, ᐳ, &quot;po&quot;. The consonant forms and the vowels so represented vary from language to language, but generally approximate their Cree origins.
:

Because the script is presented in syllabic charts and learned as a syllabary, it is often considered to be such. Indeed, computer fonts have separate coding points for each syllable (each orientation of each consonant), and the Unicode Consortium considers syllabics to be a &quot;featural syllabary&quot; along with such scripts as hangul, where each block represents a syllable, but consonants and vowels are indicated independently (in Cree syllabics, the consonant by the shape of a glyph, and the vowel by its orientation). This is unlike a true syllabary, where each combination of consonant and vowel has an independent form that is unrelated to other syllables with the same consonant or vowel.

===Syllabic and final consonant forms===
The original script, which was designed for Western Swampy Cree, had ten such letterforms: eight for syllables based on the consonants &quot;p-&quot;, &quot;t-&quot;, &quot;c-&quot;, &quot;k-&quot;, &quot;m-&quot;, &quot;n-&quot;, &quot;s-&quot;, &quot;y-&quot; (pronounced /p, t, ts, k, m, n, s, j/), another for vowel-initial syllables, and finally a blended form, now obsolete, for the consonant cluster &quot;sp-&quot;. In the 1840 version, all were written with a light line to show the vowel was short and a heavier line to show the vowel was long: ᑲ &quot;ka&quot;, ᑲ &quot;kâ&quot;; however, in the 1841 version, a light line indicated minuscules (&quot;lowercase&quot;) and a heavier line indicated majuscules (&quot;uppercase&quot;): ᑲ &quot;ka&quot;, ᑲ &quot;KA&quot; or &quot;Ka&quot;; additionally in the 1841 version, an unbroken letterform indicated a short vowel, but for a long vowel, Evans notched the face of the type sorts, such that in print the letterform was broken. A handwritten variant using an overdot to indicate a long vowel is now used in printing as well: ᑕ &quot;ta&quot;, ᑖ &quot;tâ&quot;. One consonant, &quot;w&quot;, had no letterform of its own but was indicated by a diacritic on another syllable; this is because it could combine with any of the consonants, as in ᑿ &quot;kwa&quot;, as well as existing on its own, as in ᐘ &quot;wa&quot;.

There were distinct letters for the nine consonants &quot;-p&quot;, &quot;-t&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;-k&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-s&quot;, &quot;-y&quot;, and &quot;w&quot; when they occurred at the end of a syllable. In addition, four &quot;final&quot; consonants had no syllabic forms: &quot;-h&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;, and the sequence &quot;-hk&quot;. These were originally written midline, but are now superscripted. (The glyph for &quot;-hk&quot; represents the most common final sequence of the language, being a common grammatical ending in Cree, and was used for common &quot;-nk&quot; in Ojibwe.) The consonants &quot;-l&quot; and &quot;-r&quot; were marginal, only found in borrowings, baby talk, and the like. These, and &quot;-h&quot;, could occur before vowels, but were written with the final shape regardless. (&quot;-l&quot; and &quot;-r&quot; are now written the size of full letters when they occur before vowels, as the finals were originally, or in some syllabics scripts have been replaced with full rotating syllabic forms; &quot;-h&quot; only occurs before a vowel in joined morphemes, in couple grammatical words, or in pedagogical materials to indicate the consonant value following it is fortis.)

===Vowel transformations===

The vowels fall into two sets, the back vowels &quot;-a&quot; and &quot;-u,&quot; and the front vowels &quot;-e&quot; and &quot;-i.&quot; Each set consists of a lower vowel, &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-e,&quot; and a higher vowel, &quot;-u&quot; or &quot;-i.&quot; In all cases, back-vowel syllables are related through left-right reflection: that is, they are mirror images of each other. How they relate to front-vowel syllables depends on the graphic form of the consonants. These follow two patterns. Symmetrical, &quot;vowel, p-, t-, sp-,&quot; are rotated 90 degrees (a quarter turn) counter-clockwise, while those that are asymmetrical top-to-bottom, &quot;c-, k-, m-, n-, s-, y-,&quot; are rotated 180 degrees (a half turn). The lower front-vowel (&quot;-e&quot;) syllables are derived this way from the low back-vowel (&quot;a&quot;) syllables, and the high front-vowel (&quot;-i&quot;) syllables are derived this way from the higher back-vowel (&quot;-u&quot;) syllables.

The symmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a diamond:

And the asymmetrical letter forms can be illustrated by arranging them into a square:

These forms are present in most syllabics scripts with sounds values that approach their Swampy Cree origins. For example, all scripts except the one for Blackfoot use the triangle for vowel-initial syllables.

By 1841, when Evans cast the first movable type for syllabics, he found that he could not satisfactorily maintain the distinction between light and heavy typeface for short and long vowels. He instead filed across the raised lines of the type, leaving gaps in the printed letter for long vowels. This can be seen in early printings. Later still a dot diacritic, originally used for vowel length only in handwriting, was extended to print: Thus today ᐊ &quot;a&quot; contrasts with ᐋ &quot;â,&quot; and ᒥ &quot;mi&quot; contrasts with ᒦ &quot;mî&quot;. Although Cree &quot;ê&quot; only occurs long, the script made length distinctions for all four vowels. Not all writers then or now indicate length, or do not do so consistently; since there is no contrast, no one today writes &quot;ê&quot; as a long vowel.

===Pointing===
Reflecting the shorthand principles on which it was based, syllabics may be written &quot;plain&quot;, indicating only the basic consonant–vowel outline of speech, or &quot;pointed&quot;, with diacritics for vowel length and the consonants and . Full phonemic pointing is rare. Syllabics may also be written without word division, as Devanagari once was, or with spaces or dots between words or prefixes.

===Punctuation===
The only punctuation found in many texts is spacing between words and ᙮ for a full stop. Punctuation from the Latin script, including the period (.), may also be used. Due to the final &quot;c&quot; resembling a hyphen, a double hyphen is used as the Canadian Aboriginal syllabics hyphen.

==Glossary==
Some common terms as used in the context of syllabics

===&quot;Syllables&quot;, or full-size letters===

The full-sized characters, whether standing for consonant-vowel combinations or vowels alone, are usually called &quot;syllables&quot;. They may be phonemic rather than morphophonemic syllables. That is, when one morpheme (word element) ends in a consonant and the next begins with a vowel, the intermediate consonant is written as a syllable with the following vowel. For example, the Plains Cree word &quot;indoors&quot; has as its first morpheme, and &quot;āyi&quot; as its second, but is written ᐲᐦᒑᔨᕽ 

In other cases, a &quot;syllable&quot; may in fact represent only a consonant, again due to the underlying structure of the language. In Plains Cree, ᑖᓂᓯ &quot;hello&quot; or &quot;how are you?&quot; is written as if it had three syllables. Because the first syllable has the stress and the syllable that follows has a short , the vowel is dropped. As a result, the word is pronounced &quot;tānsi&quot; with only two syllables.

Syllabication is important to determining stress in Algonquian languages, and vice versa, so this ambiguity in syllabics is relatively important in Algonquian languages.

====Series====

The word &quot;series&quot; is used for either a set of syllables with the same vowel, or a set with the same initial consonant. Thus the n-series is the set of syllables that begin with &quot;n,&quot; and the o-series is the set of syllables that have &quot;o&quot; as their vowel regardless of their initial consonant.

===&quot;Finals&quot;, or reduced letters===

A series of small raised letters are called &quot;finals&quot;. They are usually placed after a syllable to indicate a final consonant, as the ᕽ &quot;-hk&quot; in ᔨᕽ above. However, the Cree consonant &quot;h,&quot; which only has a final form, begins a small number of function words such as ᐦᐋᐤ &quot;hāw.&quot; In such cases the &quot;final&quot; ᐦ represents an &quot;initial&quot; consonant and therefore precedes the syllable.

The use of diacritics to write consonants is unusual in abugidas. However, it also occurs (independently) in the Lepcha script.

Finals are commonly employed in the extension of syllabics to languages it was not initially designed for. In some of the Athabaskan alphabets, finals have been extended to appear at mid height after a syllable, lowered after a syllable, and at mid height before a syllable. For example, Chipewyan and Slavey use the final ᐟ in the latter position to indicate the initial consonant &quot;dl&quot; ().

In Naskapi, a small raised letter based on &quot;sa&quot; is used for consonant clusters that begin with /s/: ᔌ ᔍ ᔎ and ᔏ The Cree languages the script was initially designed for had no such clusters.

In Inuktitut, something similar is used not to indicate sequences, but to represent additional consonants, rather as the digraphs &quot;ch, sh, th&quot; were used to extend the Latin letters &quot;c, s, t&quot; to represent additional consonants in English. In Inuktitut, a raised &quot;na-ga&quot; is placed before the &quot;g-&quot; series, ᖏ ᖑ ᖓ, to form an &quot;ng-&quot; () series, and a raised &quot;ra&quot; (uvular ) is placed before syllables of the &quot;k-&quot; series, ᕿ ᖁ ᖃ, to form a uvular &quot;q-&quot; series.

Although the forms of these series have two parts, each is encoded into the Unicode standard as a single character.

===Diacritics===

Other marks placed above or beside the syllable are called &quot;diacritics&quot;. These include the dot placed above a syllable to mark a long vowel, as in ᒦ &quot;mî,&quot; and the dot placed at mid height after the syllable (in western Cree dialects) or before the syllable (in eastern Cree dialects) to indicate a medial &quot;w,&quot; as in ᑿ &quot;kwa.&quot; These are all encoded as single characters in Unicode.

Diacritics used by other languages include a ring above on Moose Cree ᑬ &quot;kay&quot; (encoded as &quot;kaai&quot;), head ring on Ojibwe ᕓ &quot;fe&quot;, head barb on Inuktitut ᖤ &quot;lha&quot;, tail barb on West Cree ᖌ &quot;ro&quot;, centred stroke (a small vertical bar) in Carrier ᗇ &quot;ghee&quot;, centred dot in Carrier ᗈ &quot;ghi&quot;, centred bar (a bar perpendicular to the body) in Cree ᖨ &quot;thi&quot;, and a variety of other marks. Such diacritics may or may not be separately encoded into Unicode. There is no systematic way to distinguish elements that are parts of syllables from diacritics, or diacritics from finals, and academic discussions of syllabics are often inconsistent in their terminology.

====Points and pointing====

The diacritic mark used to indicate vowel length is often referred to as a &quot;point&quot;. Syllabics users do not always consistently mark vowel length, &quot;w,&quot; or &quot;h.&quot; A text with these marked is called a &quot;pointed&quot; text; one without such marks is said to be &quot;unpointed&quot;.

===Syllabaries and syllabics===
The word &quot;syllabary&quot; has two meanings: a writing system with a separate character for each syllable, but also a table of syllables, including any script arranged in a syllabic chart. Evans&#x27; Latin Ojibwe alphabet, for example, was presented as a syllabary. Canadian Aboriginal &quot;syllabics&quot;, the script itself, is thus distinct from a syllabary (syllabic chart) that displays them.

===Round and Square===
While Greek, Latin, and Cyrillic have serif and sans-serif forms, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics generally do not. Instead, like proportional and monospaced fonts, Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics have a round form and a square form. Round form, known in Cree as , is akin to a proportional font, characterised by their smooth bowls, differing letter heights, and occupying a rectangular space. Round form syllabics are more commonly found east of Lake Winnipeg. Square form, known in Cree as , is akin to a monospace font, characterised by their cornered bowls, same letter heights, and occupying a square space. Square form syllabics are more commonly found west of Lake Winnipeg.

==Syllabic alphabets==

The inventory, form, and orthography of the script vary among all the Cree communities which use it. However, it was further modified to create specific alphabets for other Algonquian languages, as well as for Inuktitut, which have significant phonological differences from Cree. There are two major variants of the script, Central Algonquian and Inuktitut. In addition, derivative scripts for Blackfoot and Athabaskan inherit at least some principals and letter forms from the Central Algonquian alphabet, though in Blackfoot most of the letters have been replaced with modified Latin. Each reflects a historical expansion of the writing system.

===Central Algonquian===

Cree and Ojibwe were the languages for which syllabics were designed, and they are the closest to the original pattern described by James Evans. The dialects differ slightly in their consonants, but where they share a sound, they generally use the same letter for it. Where they do not, a new letter was created, often by modifying another. In several Cree dialects &quot;ê&quot; has merged with the &quot;î&quot;, and these use only three of the four vowel orientations.

====Eastern and western syllabics====
When syllabics spread to Ojibwe and to those Cree dialects east of the Manitoba–Ontario border, a few changes occurred. For one, the diacritic used to mark non-final &quot;w&quot; moved from its position after the syllable to before it; thus western Cree is equivalent to the eastern Cree – both are pronounced &quot;mwa.&quot; Secondly, the special final forms of the consonants were replaced with superscript variants of the corresponding &quot;a&quot; series in Moose Cree and Moose Cree influenced areas, so that is &quot;ak&quot; and &quot;sap&quot; (graphically &quot;aka&quot; and &quot;sapa&quot;), rather than and ; among some of the Ojibwe communities superscript variants of the corresponding &quot;i&quot; series are found, especially in handwritten documents. Cree dialects of the western provinces preserve the Pitman-derived finals of the original script, though final &quot;y&quot; has become the more salient , to avoid confusion with the various dot diacritics. Additional consonant series are more pervasive in the east.

====Additional consonant series====
A few western charts show full &quot;l-&quot; and &quot;r-&quot; series, used principally for loan words. In a Roman Catholic variant, &quot;r-&quot; is a normal asymmetric form, derived by adding a stroke to &quot;c-,&quot; but &quot;l-&quot; shows an irregular pattern: Despite being asymmetrical, the forms are rotated only 90°, and &quot;li&quot; is a mirror image of what would be expected; it is neither an inversion nor a reflection of &quot;le,&quot; as in the other series, but rather a 180° rotation.
:&quot;Some western additions&quot;


Series were added for &quot;l-, r-, sh- (š-)&quot; and &quot;f-&quot; in most eastern Cree dialects. &quot;R-&quot; is an inversion of the form of western &quot;l-,&quot; but now it is &quot;re&quot; that has the unexpected orientation. &quot;L-&quot; and &quot;f-&quot; are regular asymmetric and symmetric forms; although &quot;f-&quot; is actually asymmetric in form, it is derived from &quot;p-&quot; and therefore rotates 90° as &quot;p-&quot; does. Here is where the two algorithms to derive vowel orientations, which are equivalent for the symmetrical forms of the original script, come to differ: For the ᕙ &quot;f-&quot; series, as well as a rare ᕦ &quot;th-&quot; series derived from ᑕ &quot;t-,&quot; vowels of like height are derived via counter-clockwise rotation; however, an eastern &quot;sh-&quot; series, which perhaps not coincidentally resembles a Latin &quot;s,&quot; is rotated &quot;clockwise&quot; with the opposite vowel derivations: high &quot;-i&quot; from low &quot;-a&quot; and lower (mid) &quot;-e&quot; from higher (mid) &quot;-o.&quot; The obsolete &quot;sp-&quot; series shows this to be the original design of the script, but Inuktitut, perhaps generalizing from the ᕙ series, which originated as ᐸ plus a circle at the start of the stroke used to write the letters, but as an independent form must be rotated in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction, is consistently counter-clockwise. (The eastern Cree &quot;r-&quot; series can be seen as both of these algorithms applied to &quot;ro&quot; (bold), whereas western Cree &quot;l-&quot; can be seen as both applied to &quot;la&quot; (bold).)

:&quot;Some eastern additions&quot;


There are minor variants within both eastern and western Cree. Woods Cree, for example, uses western Cree conventions, but has lost the &quot;e&quot; series, and has an additional consonant series, &quot;th- (ð-),&quot; which is a barred form of the &quot;y-&quot; series.

Moose Cree, which uses eastern Cree conventions, has an &quot;-sk&quot; final that is composed of &quot;-s&quot; and &quot;-k,&quot; as in ᐊᒥᔉ &quot;beaver&quot;, and final &quot;-y&quot; is written with a superscript ring, , rather than a superscript &quot;ya,&quot; which preserves, in a more salient form, the distinct final form otherwise found only in the west: ᐋᣁ&quot;āshay&quot; &quot;now&quot;.

The Eastern Cree dialect has distinct labialized finals, &quot;-kw&quot; and &quot;-mw&quot;; these are written with raised versions of the o-series rather than the usual a-series, as in ᒥᔅᑎᒄ &quot;tree&quot;. This is motivated by the fact that the vowel &quot;o&quot; labializes the preceding consonant.

Although in most respects Naskapi follows eastern Cree conventions, it does not mark vowel length at all and uses two dots, either placed above or before a syllable, to indicate a &quot;w&quot;: &quot;wa,&quot; &quot;wo,&quot; &quot;twa,&quot; &quot;kwa,&quot; &quot;cwa&quot; (), &quot;mwa,&quot; &quot;nwa,&quot; &quot;swa,&quot; &quot;ywa.&quot; Since Naskapi &quot;s-&quot; consonant clusters are all labialized, &quot;sCw-,&quot; these also have the two dots: &quot;spwa, etc.&quot; There is also a labialized final sequence, &quot;-skw,&quot; which is a raised &quot;so-ko.&quot;

===Inuktitut===

The eastern form of Cree syllabics was adapted to write the Inuktitut dialects of Nunavut (except for the extreme west, including Kugluktuk and Cambridge Bay) and Nunavik in northern Quebec. Unicode 14.0 added support for the Natsilingmiutut language of Western Nunavut. In other Inuit areas, various Latin alphabets are used.

Inuktitut has only three vowels, and thus only needs the &quot;a-, i-,&quot; and &quot;o&quot;-series of Cree, the latter used for . The &quot;e&quot;-series was originally used for the common diphthong , but this was officially dropped in the 1960s so that Inuktitut would not have more characters than could be moulded onto an IBM Selectric typewriter ball, with &quot;-ai&quot; written as an &quot;a&quot;-series syllable followed by &quot;i.&quot; Recently the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami decided to restore the ai-series, and the Makivik Corporation has adopted this use in Nunavik; it has not been restored in Nunavut.

Inuktitut has more consonants than Cree, fifteen in its standardised form. As Inuktitut has no , the &quot;c&quot; series has been reassigned to the value &quot;g&quot; (). The &quot;y&quot; series is used for either &quot;y-&quot; or &quot;j-,&quot; since the difference is one of dialect; similarly with the &quot;s&quot; series, which stands for either &quot;s-&quot; or &quot;h-&quot;, depending on the dialect. The eastern Cree &quot;l&quot; series is used: &quot;la,&quot; &quot;lu,&quot; &quot;li,&quot; &quot;lai;&quot; a stroke is added to these to derive the voiceless &quot;lh&quot; () series: &quot;lha, etc.&quot; The eastern Cree &quot;f&quot; series is used for Inuktitut &quot;v-&quot;: &quot;va, etc.&quot; The eastern Cree &quot;r&quot; series is used for the very different Inuktitut sound, , which is also spelled &quot;r&quot;. However, this has been regularized in form, with vowels of like height consistently derived through counter-clockwise rotation, and therefore &quot;rai&quot; the inversion of &quot;ri&quot;:

The remaining sounds are written with digraphs. A raised &quot;ra&quot; is prefixed to the k-series to create a digraph for &quot;q&quot;: &quot;qa, etc.&quot;; the final is &quot;-q.&quot; A raised &quot;na-ga&quot; is prefixed to the g-series to create an &quot;ng&quot; () series: &quot;nga, etc.,&quot; and the &quot;na&quot; is doubled for geminate &quot;nng&quot; (): &quot;nnga.&quot; The finals are and .

In Nunavut, the &quot;h&quot; final has been replaced with Roman , which does not rotate, but in Nunavik a new series is derived by adding a stroke to the k-series: &quot;ha, etc.&quot;

In the early years, Roman Catholic and Anglican missionaries used slightly different forms of syllabics for Inuktitut. In modern times, however, these differences have disappeared. Dialectal variation across the syllabics-using part of the Inuit world has promoted an implicit diversity in spelling, but for the most part this has not had any impact on syllabics itself.

==Derived scripts==
At least two scripts derive from Cree syllabics, and share its principles, but have fundamentally different letter shapes or sound values.

===Blackfoot===
Blackfoot, another Algonquian language, uses a syllabary developed in the 1880s that is quite different from the Cree and Inuktitut versions. Although borrowing from Cree the ideas of rotated and mirrored glyphs with final variants, most of the letter forms derive from the Latin script, with only some resembling Cree letters. Blackfoot has eight initial consonants, only two of which are identical in form to their Cree equivalents, &quot;se&quot; and &quot;ye&quot; (here only the vowels have changed). The other consonants were created by modifying letters of the Latin script to make the &quot;e&quot; series, or in three cases by taking Cree letters but reassigning them with new sound values according to which Latin letters they resembled. These are &quot;pe&quot; (from ), &quot;te&quot; (from ), &quot;ke&quot; (from ), &quot;me&quot; (from ), &quot;ne&quot; (from ), &quot;we&quot; (from ). There are also a number of distinct final forms. The four vowel positions are used for the three vowels and one of the diphthongs of Blackfoot. The script is largely obsolete.

===Carrier and other Athabaskan===

Athabaskan syllabic scripts were developed in the late 19th century by French Roman Catholic missionaries, who adapted this originally Protestant writing system to languages radically different from the Algonquian languages. Most Athabaskan languages have more than four distinct vowels, and all have many more distinct consonants than Cree. This has meant the invention of a number of new consonant forms. Whereas most Athabaskan scripts, such as those for Slavey and Chipewyan, bear a reasonably close resemblance to Cree syllabics, the Carrier (Dakelh) variant is highly divergent, and only one series – the series for vowels alone – resembles the original Cree form.

To accommodate six distinctive vowels, Dakelh supplements the four vowel orientations with a dot and a horizontal line in the rightward pointing forms: ᐊ &quot;a&quot;, ᐅ &quot;ʌ&quot;, ᐈ &quot;e&quot;, ᐉ &quot;i&quot;, ᐃ &quot;o&quot;, and ᐁ &quot;u&quot;.

One of the Chipewyan scripts is more faithful to western Cree. (Sayisi Chipewyan is substantially more divergent.) It has the nine forms plus the western &quot;l&quot; and &quot;r&quot; series, though the rotation of the &quot;l-&quot; series has been made consistently counter-clockwise. The &quot;k-&quot; and &quot;n-&quot; series are more angular than in Cree: &quot;ki&quot; resembles Latin &quot;P&quot;. The &quot;c&quot; series has been reassigned to &quot;dh&quot;. There are additional series: a regular &quot;ch&quot; series (ᗴ &quot;cha&quot;, ᗯ &quot;che&quot;, ᗰ &quot;chi&quot;, ᗱ &quot;cho&quot;), graphically a doubled &quot;t&quot;; and an irregular &quot;z&quot; series, where &quot;ze&quot; is derived by counter-clockwise rotation of &quot;za&quot;, but &quot;zi&quot; by clockwise rotation of &quot;zo&quot;:

Other series are formed from &quot;dh&quot; or &quot;t&quot;. A mid-line final Cree &quot;t&quot; preceding &quot;dh&quot; forms &quot;th,&quot; a raised Cree final &quot;p&quot; following &quot;t&quot; forms &quot;tt,&quot; a stroke inside &quot;t&quot; forms &quot;tth&quot; (ᕮ &quot;ttha&quot;), and a small &quot;t&quot; inside &quot;t&quot; forms &quot;ty&quot; (ᕳ &quot;tya&quot;). Nasal vowels are indicated by a following Cree final &quot;k.&quot;

===Pollard script===

The Pollard script, also known as Pollard Miao is an abugida invented by Methodist missionary Samuel Pollard. Pollard credited the basic idea of the script to the Cree syllabics, saying, &quot;While working out the problem, we remembered the case of the syllabics used by a Methodist missionary among the Indians of North America, and resolved to do as he had done&quot;.

==Current usage==

At present, Canadian syllabics seems reasonably secure within the Cree, Oji-Cree, and Inuit communities. They appear somewhat more at risk among the Ojibwe, and seriously endangered for Athabaskan languages and Blackfoot.

In Nunavut and Nunavik, Inuktitut syllabics have official status. In Nunavut, laws, legislative debates and many other government documents must be published in Inuktitut in both syllabics and the Latin script. The rapid growth in the scope and quantity of material published in syllabics has, by all appearances, ended any immediate prospect of marginalisation for this writing system.

Within the Cree and Ojibwe language communities, the situation is less confident.

Cree syllabics use is vigorous in most communities where it has taken root. In many dialect areas, there are now standardised syllabics spellings. Nonetheless, there are now linguistically adequate standardised Roman writing systems for most if not all dialects.

Ojibwe speakers in the U.S. have never been heavy users of either Canadian Aboriginal syllabics or the Great Lakes Aboriginal syllabics and have now essentially ceased to use either of them at all. The &quot;double vowel&quot; Roman orthography developed by Charles Fiero and further developed by John Nichols is increasingly the standard in the U.S. and is beginning to penetrate into Canada, in part to prevent further atomisation of what is already a minority language. Nonetheless, Ojibwe syllabics are still in vigorous use in some parts of Canada.

Use in other communities is moribund.

Blackfoot syllabics have, for all intents and purposes, disappeared. Present day Blackfoot speakers use a Latin alphabet, and very few Blackfoot can still read—much less write—the syllabic system.

Among the Athabaskan languages, syllabics are still in use among the Yellowknives Dene in Yellowknife, Dettah, and Ndılǫ, Northwest Territories. Recently, two major reference works on the Tetsǫ́t&#x27;ıné language were published by the Alaska Native Language Center, using syllabics: a verb grammar and a dictionary. Syllabics are also still in use at Saint Kateri Tekakwitha Church in Dettah, where they use a revised version of the 1904 hymnbook. Young people learn syllabics both in school as well as through culture camps organized by the Language, Culture, and History Department.

No other Athabaskan version of the syllabics is known to be in vigorous use. In some cases, the languages themselves are on the brink of extinction. In other cases, syllabics has been replaced by a Latin alphabet. Many people—linguists and speakers of Athabaskan languages alike—feel that syllabics is ill-suited to these languages. The government of the Northwest Territories does not use syllabic writing for any of the Athabaskan languages on its territory, and native churches have generally stopped using them as well. Among Dakelh users, a well-developed Latin alphabet has effectively replaced syllabics. Very few people can read syllabics and none use them for routine writing. Syllabics are however popular in symbolic and artistic uses.

In the past, government policy towards syllabics has varied from indifference to open hostility. Until the late 20th century, government policy in Canada openly undermined native languages, and church organisations were often the only organised bodies using syllabics. Later, as governments became more accommodating of native languages, and in some cases even encouraged their use, it was widely believed that moving to a Latin alphabet was better, both for linguistic reasons and to reduce the cost of supporting multiple scripts.

At present, at least for Inuktitut and Algonquian languages, Canadian government tolerates, and in some cases encourages, the use of syllabics. The growth of Aboriginal nationalism in Canada and the devolution of many government activities to native communities has changed attitudes towards syllabics. In many places there are now standardisation bodies for syllabic spelling, and the Unicode standard supports a fairly complete set of Canadian syllabic characters for digital exchange. Syllabics are now taught in schools in Inuktitut-speaking areas, and are often taught in traditionally syllabics-using Cree and Ojibwe communities as well.

Although syllabic writing is not always practical (for example, with computer hardware or software limitations), and in many cases a Latin alphabet would be less costly to use, many native communities are strongly attached to syllabics. Even though it was originally the invention of European missionaries, many people consider syllabics a writing system that belongs to them, and associate Latin letters with linguistic assimilation.

==Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics in Unicode==
The bulk of the characters, including all that are found in official documents, are encoded into three blocks in the Unicode standard:
* Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics (U+1400–U+167F)
* Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended (U+18B0–U+18FF)
* Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics Extended-A (U+11AB0–U+11ABF)
These characters can be rendered with any appropriate font, including the freely available fonts listed below. In Microsoft Windows, built-in support was added through the Euphemia font introduced in Windows Vista, though this has incorrect forms for &quot;sha&quot; and &quot;shu&quot;.

<text>Jud Süß is an early 19th century novella by Wilhelm Hauff based on the early 18th century German Jewish banker and financial adviser Joseph Süß Oppenheimer. In Hauff&#x27;s novella, Joseph Süß Oppenheimer is the flamboyant Jewish finance minister of Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg; his policies based on corruption and intimidations made him hated by the Christian community. At the Duke&#x27;s sudden death, he is arrested and sentenced to be hanged in an iron cage and die a horrible death. His daughter who is left penniless drowns herself in the Neckar. Lion Feuchtwanger characterized Hauff&#x27;s novella as &#x27;naïvely anti-Semitic.&#x27;

<text>Rodney Scott Harrison (born December 15, 1972) is an American former professional football safety who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 15 seasons with the San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots. He was selected in the fifth round of the 1994 NFL draft by the Chargers, where he spent his first nine seasons, and was a member of the Patriots in his following six. Since leaving the NFL in 2009, he has served as a commentator for NBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Night in America&quot;.

During his career, Harrison was selected to two Pro Bowls and received first-team All-Pro honors twice. He holds the defensive back record for sacks and was the first NFL player to obtain 30 sacks and 30 interceptions. Harrison participated in four Super Bowls, winning two with the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII and Super Bowl XXXIX. In recognition of his accomplishments in San Diego and New England, he was named to the 50th Anniversary Teams of both the Chargers and Patriots. He was also inducted to the Patriots Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Early life==
Harrison went to high school at Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights, Illinois. In March 2006, Marian Catholic retired Harrison&#x27;s No. 37 jersey, although Harrison never actually wore No. 37 while in high school. His varsity numbers were No. 26 as a sophomore, No. 11 as a junior and No. 3 as a senior. He graduated from high school in 1991.

==College career==
Harrison played college football at Western Illinois University from 1991 to 1993. He is the school&#x27;s record-holder for tackles in a career (345) and tackles in a game (28). As a freshman, Harrison was a second-team All-Gateway Football Conference before being named a first-team All-Gateway pick as a sophomore and junior. The Associated Press also named him a second-team All-American as a sophomore and a first-team All-American as a junior. Harrison was suspended from the team and elected to enter the NFL draft.

==Professional career==

===San Diego Chargers===
Harrison was drafted in the fifth round of the 1994 draft, (145th overall) by the San Diego Chargers, the same year they made their only Super Bowl (XXIX) to date, which they lost to the San Francisco 49ers. Harrison became a starting member of the Chargers&#x27; 1996 defense, going to two Pro Bowls with the Chargers in 1998 and 2001. He set then-career highs with the Chargers in 2000 with 127 tackles and six interceptions; in 2002 he started 13 games and recorded 88 tackles in his final season with the Chargers.

===New England Patriots===

====2003====
Following the 2002 season, on February 27, 2003, Harrison was released by the Chargers. Two weeks later, on March 13, Harrison landed with the Patriots, signing a six-year deal. At the time, the Patriots had both Harrison and fellow Pro Bowl safety Lawyer Milloy under contract. Throughout the offseason, though, the Patriots and Milloy were involved in contract negotiations, with the Patriots requesting Milloy take a pay cut or be released. Milloy did not comply, and on September 2, he was released.

Prior to the 2003 season, Harrison was named a defensive captain in his first year with the Patriots by the coaching staff after Lawyer Milloy was released.

On January 10, 2004, in the divisional playoff game against the Tennessee Titans, he intercepted Steve McNair, which set up Antowain Smith&#x27;s touchdown, as New England would hold on for a 17–14 win. In the AFC Championship Game the next week against the Indianapolis Colts, Harrison intercepted Peyton Manning in the end zone and forced a Marvin Harrison fumble, recovered by teammate Tyrone Poole. Harrison then went on to help the New England Patriots win their second title in three years, against the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl XXXVIII, 32–29. He fractured his right arm late in the game, but a Tom Brady-led drive and Adam Vinatieri field goal secured the Patriots&#x27; victory. In his 10th year in the league, Harrison earned his first Super Bowl ring.

Harrison was also named to the Associated Press&#x27; All-Pro team following a 140-tackle (a 2003 NFL best for a defensive back) and three-sack season in which he started all 16 regular season games.

====2004====
The 2004 season produced a similar performance. Harrison helped New England&#x27;s defense finish second in the NFL in scoring for 2004. For the second straight season, Harrison&#x27;s 138 tackles led all defensive backs in the NFL. Harrison also started all sixteen regular season games for the sixth time in his career, holding together a Patriots secondary that was without Ty Law and Tyrone Poole for the majority of the season.

In the Patriots&#x27; divisional playoff game against the Colts, Harrison intercepted Peyton Manning late in the game to end the Colts&#x27; last chance. The next week in the AFC Championship, Harrison jumped a Ben Roethlisberger pass and took it 87 yards for a touchdown, helping the Patriots defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers, 41–27. During the week leading up to the Super Bowl, Harrison got into a verbal feud with Philadelphia Eagles receiver Freddie Mitchell after Mitchell claimed he &quot;had something for Harrison&quot; and did not know the names of the New England secondary. Harrison, in Super Bowl XXXIX, would record seven tackles, a sack, and two interceptions of quarterback Donovan McNabb, despite missing almost an entire quarter due to an injury sustained during the game. The second interception, with ten seconds remaining in the game, preserved a 24–21 Patriot win, ensuring a third championship in four years.

====2005–2008====
The 2005 season began a string of multiple injuries for the 12th-year safety, with Harrison&#x27;s season coming to an end on September 25 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, when he was hit in the knee by a falling Cedrick Wilson and tore the anterior cruciate, medial collateral, and posterior cruciate ligaments in his left knee. Harrison was subsequently placed on the injured reserve list, ending his season.

Slightly over 10 months after his season-ending injury, Harrison returned to Patriots&#x27; practice for the first time on August 7, 2006. After sporadic playing time in the preseason, Harrison started the first seven of the Patriots&#x27; games in 2006, totaling 23 tackles and one sack. However, while making a tackle on Marvin Harrison against the Colts on November 5, Rodney Harrison injured his right shoulder and missed the next six weeks of the season. He returned to the Patriots in week 16, but his season was ended the following week in Tennessee after a low block from Bobby Wade injured his right knee.

Harrison was suspended for the first four games of the 2007 regular season for admitting to federal investigators that he knowingly obtained and used human growth hormone (HGH). Harrison stated to the media that he used &quot;a banned substance&quot; for &quot;accelerating the healing process from injuries [he] sustained playing football,&quot; and &quot;never to gain a competitive edge.&quot; In addition, according to federal agents and Harrison himself, Harrison received a shipment of HGH, with his name on it, just days before Super Bowl XXXVIII in February 2004. Later, he expressed regret over his decision to use the substance calling it &quot;a black cloud over my career.&quot; &quot;I played 15 years and that doesn&#x27;t feel good. That&#x27;s embarrassing...It wasn&#x27;t smart. I put a foreign substance in my body and don&#x27;t know the long-term effects,&quot; he said on &quot;Football Night in America&quot;.

In Super Bowl XLII, which concluded the 2007 season, Rodney Harrison was the player over whom David Tyree made his famous Helmet Catch, leading the New York Giants to victory 17–14 and handing the Patriots their first loss of the year, preventing a perfect season. In the play, a long forward third down pass by Eli Manning over midfield, Harrison was both attempting to block reception and tackle at the same time. Interestingly, Harrison was able to disengage one of Tyree&#x27;s hands from the ball, but not both.

Harrison&#x27;s 2008 season ended early when, in an October 20 game against the Denver Broncos, Harrison tore his right quadriceps femoris muscle on a play, was carted off the field, and placed on injured reserve.

===Retirement===

On June 3, 2009, Harrison announced his retirement from football to become an analyst for NBC Sports&#x27; &quot;Football Night in America&quot;. Patriots head coach Bill Belichick soon after called Harrison one of the best players he had ever coached.

===Reputation===
Harrison was voted the &quot;dirtiest player&quot; in the NFL by his peers according to a 2004 poll conducted by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. In 2006, Harrison once again topped the &quot;dirtiest player&quot; voting by 361 other NFL players. In 2008, NFL coaches awarded the title to Harrison in an anonymous poll conducted by ESPN. He has also been fined and suspended multiple times, and as of 2002, had racked up over $200,000 in fines by the NFL. A notable suspension occurred in 2002 after a helmet-to-helmet hit on the Oakland Raiders&#x27; Jerry Rice. Harrison was the player during a preseason game against the then St. Louis Rams who hit Rams QB Trent Green low, resulting in a season-ending knee injury for Green, thrusting back-up and then relatively unknown QB Kurt Warner into the starting position. The Rams went on to win the Super Bowl that year and Warner was named NFL MVP and has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

<text>The Ashover Light Railway was a narrow gauge railway in Derbyshire, England that connected Clay Cross and Ashover. It was built by the Clay Cross Company to transport minerals such as limestone, fluorite, barytes and gritstone to its works at Clay Cross and for transport around the country by the LMS.

==History==
George Stephenson surveyed the route for the North Midland Railway between Derby and Leeds in the 1830s. The route passed close to Ashover where Stephenson saw the potential for the development of a colliery. He formed George Stephenson &amp; Company in 1837 and built a colliery and coke ovens at Clay Cross which opened in 1840. The company passed to his son Robert Stephenson on George&#x27;s death in 1848, and in 1852 he sold his shares, the business becoming the Clay Cross Company, which was at one time the largest independent employer in the UK.

The company continued to develop its mining interests and in 1918 it purchased the Overton Estate at Fallgate with the aim of extracting minerals. An order under the Light Railways Act was obtained in 1918 to build a standard gauge railway between the Midland Railway station at Stretton and Ashover, with a gauge rope-worked mineral railway serving Alton colliery. This railway was not built because the cost estimates were too high. Instead in 1920 H. F. Stephens, the consulting engineer for the line, proposed building the entire railway to gauge. This considerably reduced the costs of construction and the plan was approved.

Construction started in 1922 and the railway opened to goods traffic in 1924. The formal opening to passenger traffic took place in March 1925. The line was built using surplus equipment from the War Department Light Railways. Although the line was built principally to carry mineral traffic, its passenger service proved successful during the mid-1920s, but competition from buses saw numbers decline and Winter services ceased in 1934.

All passenger services were withdrawn in 1936, but the four large bogie carriages built by Gloucester RC&amp;W survived through WW2, and all ended up as stands on the Works bowling green. Nos 1 and 2 were moved to the Lincolnshire Coast Light Railway, No 4 was moved to the Golden Valley Light Railway, and the last (presumably No 3) was scrapped in 1960.

The mineral traffic continued but the railway declined through the 1940s. In 1949 the railway&#x27;s last remaining contract with Butts quarry was terminated and the quarry closed in 1950. The railway closed on 31 March 1950. Most of the rail remained in place through October of that year when a last inspection trip was made. After that the majority of the railway was lifted. However a short length was left in place around the Fallgate works. This remnant track continued to be used until 1968.

Part of the route was flooded in 1958 when Ogston Reservoir was formed.

==Preservation society==

In 1996, the Ashover Light Railway Society was formed with the aim of saving the surviving features of the railway. They carried out a track-bed survey and found that most of the track-bed between Ashover and Ogston Reservoir was largely intact. This changed the direction of the society from preserving the line&#x27;s remaining artefacts, to reopening at least a short section of the line.

So far, the society has had much support from the local population and the council for the area. In 2007, they bought &#x27;Where the Rainbow Ends&#x27; cafe, and have since dismantled it and put it into storage for future use.

They have also taken over the land that was the Derbyshire Dales Narrow Gauge Railway (based at Peak Rail in Rowsley, Derbyshire) and are developing a new layout.

== Locomotives ==

== The route ==

The line started at Clay Cross Works, just above the northern portal of the Clay Cross Tunnel. From here, the line swung northwards out of the town, then curved westwards through 180-degree to avoid going through Clay Cross town centre. The problem with this route was the Chesterfield Road, now the A61, and crossing it required a steel girder bridge spanning 45 feet. The height had to be 16 feet above road level, which required a half-mile long approach embankment to be built. The bridge and embankment were the only major pieces of engineering on the entire route between Clay Cross and Ashover. The bridge support on the west side of the road can still be seen today. Shortly after the opening of the railway, the Pirelli Tyre Company at Burton-upon-Trent had a large advertisement painted on the bridge therefore it became known as &#x27;The Pirelli Bridge&#x27;. Several stations were provided along the line, with the main terminus and headquarters being Clay Cross &amp; Egstow within the Clay Cross Works. Four further stations named Chesterfield Road, Holmgate, Springfield and Clay Lane were erected within the town boundaries of Clay Cross, with the next station being at Stretton. At this point the line was still continuing southwards, but soon swung north-westwards again to follow the picturesque course of the River Amber as far as Ashover. Stations along this section were Hurst Lane, Woolley, Dalebank, Milltown, Fallgate, Salter Lane (for Ashover), and Ashover Butts.

==Stations and halts==
Clay Cross and Egstow An open-fronted wooden shelter with the manager&#x27;s office on one side, and a room which was intended a parcels office, but was actually used as a general storeroom on the other. The station was the only one on the line that had electric lighting. It had had an unusually large nameboard (10 ft by 3 ft) which stood on the single low platform.

Chesterfield Road was situated just before the large bridge over the Chesterfield to Derby road. It had a small wooden shelter, and was accessed by a flight of steps down to the road. It was one of the busier stations on the line because buses passed at half-hourly intervals. In 1940, the wooden shelter was destroyed in a gale, and the pieces were used to construct a small store-shed at the back of the Clay Cross locomotive shed.

Holmgate Halt had a siding capable of holding around six wagons. It was provided with a small wooden shelter and a telephone box.

Springfield Halt consisted of nothing more than a nameboard at a point where the line was crossed by a footpath.

Clay Lane Halt had a wooden shelter and a telephone box. It was located about a quarter of a mile from the main street in Clay Cross, near the Royal Oak public house. The points were laid for a siding, but this was never built, due to meagre goods traffic. Despite this, passenger traffic was initially good.

Stretton provided the interchange with the London Midland and Scottish Railway. It had a wooden shelter, with a goods office and a telephone box. The loop-line at Stretton was used as accommodation for connecting trains. The timetables with the main line did not always coincide, and ALR trains sometimes had to wait for nearly half an hour. The loop line was removed in the 1940s.

Hurst Lane Halt had a wooden shelter and telephone box, together with a water tank on wooden trestles. There were points for a siding near the shelter, but this was never laid. The water tank was gone by the late 1940s.

Woolley served the village of Woolley Moor. The station had a wooden platform and a telephone box, a platelayers&#x27; cabin and a coal office. There was a siding which could hold around five wagons. The coal office was closed in the mid 1930s. Some time before its closure, the telephone was moved from the box into the office, as coal sales were initially good, but soon deteriorated. The section of track where the station once stood has now been flooded by the Ogston Reservoir.

Dale Bank Halt consisted of a small wooden shelter. The halt was always very underused, despite being just half a mile from Stubben Edge Hall.

Milltown Halt served the village of Milltown. It had a wooden shelter, and was reached by a short roadway from Oakstedge Lane. There were points installed for a siding, but this was never laid.

Fallgate served the hamlet of Fallgate. It had a wooden shelter, a telephone box and a water tank. The station stood at the north end of a 100-yard loop adjacent to a level crossing. There was also a coal sales depot, and in 1927, a limestone dust grinding plant was built. However, due to repeated complaints by local residents, the plant was dismantled and moved to the Clay Cross Works. A tarmacadam plant was also built, operating from 1936 to 1948.

Salter Lane for Ashover was just half a mile from Overton Hall. It consisted of a low platform with a wooden shelter and a nameboard. The shelter is no longer present, but the edge of the platform is still visible.

<doc id="1158197" wikidata="Q141681" url="?curid=1158197" title="Hope Bay, Antarctica">
<text>Hope Bay (Spanish: &quot;Bahía Esperanza&quot;) () is a bay long and wide, indenting the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and opening on Antarctic Sound.

==Location==

Hope Bay is in Graham Land on the north coast of the Trinity Peninsula, which forms the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
Hope bay is south of Mount Bransfield and southwest of the Mott Snowfield.
It opens onto the Antarctic Sound to the west, and faces Joinville Island.
It defines the northeast end of the Tabarin Peninsula.
Features and nearby features include, clockwise from the east, Mount Flora, Mount Carroll, Depot Glacier, Mount Cardinal, Mount Taylor, Whitten Peak, Twin Peaks, Arena Glacier and Andersson Nunatak.

==Sailing directions==
The US Defense Mapping Agency&#x27;s &quot;Sailing Directions for Antarctica&quot; (1976) describes Hope Bay as follows:
==History==

Hope Bay was discovered on January 15, 1902 by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition (SwedAE) under Otto Nordenskiöld, who named it in commemoration of the winter spent there by J. Gunnar Andersson, S.A. Duse, and Toralf Grunden of his expedition, after his ship (the &quot;Antarctic&quot;) was crushed by the ice and lost.
They were eventually rescued by Argentine corvette &quot;Uruguay&quot;.

The ruins of a stone hut built in January 1903 by members of the Swedish expedition can still be seen; it has been designated a Historic Site or Monument (HSM 39), following a proposal by Argentina and the United Kingdom to the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting.

Hope Bay was also the scene of the Hope Bay incident when the only shots ever in Antarctica took place, in 1952. 
An Argentine shore party fired a machine gun over the heads of a British Antarctic Survey team unloading supplies from the &quot;John Biscoe&quot;. 
The Argentines later extended a diplomatic apology, saying that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Argentine military commander on the ground had exceeded his authority. However, the Argentine party was given a hero&#x27;s welcome upon its return to Argentina.

==Research Stations==

=== Elichiribehety Station ===

Elichiribehety Station better known in English by its Spanish acronym &quot;ECARE&quot; is an Uruguay summer research station, established by the Uruguayan Antarctic Institute on December 22, 1997 on the Antarctic Peninsula.

=== Esperanza Base ===

Esperanza Base is a permanent, all year-round Argentine research station which was established in 1952. 
It is operated by the Instituto Antartico Argentino and has an average of 55 inhabitants in winter. 
The base installations have displaced part of a penguin rookery.

=== Station D ===
The old British Station D was established here in 1945 which was occupied by 13 people in the austral winter. It partially burned on November 8, 1948, with the loss of two lives.

A new hut was built on February 4, 1952 in a new place and took the name of Trinity House, it was closed in 1964. 
On December 8, 1997 the British Antarctic Survey transferred the base to Uruguay, who renamed it Teniente Ruperto Elichiribehety Uruguayan Antarctic Scientific Station (ECARE).

==Important Bird Area==
The bay has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports one of the largest Adélie penguin colonies in Antarctica with around 125,000 pairs. Other birds nesting at the site include gentoo penguins, brown skuas, Antarctic terns, Wilson&#x27;s storm-petrels, kelp gulls and snowy sheathbills.

==Northern features==

Features around the north entrance to the bay include, from west to east,

===Andersson Nunatak===
A nunatak west of Sheppard Point, standing above the coastal ice cliffs on the north shore of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by Johan Gunnar Andersson&#x27;s party of the SwedAE which wintered at Hope Bay in 1903. 
Named for Andersson by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) following their survey of the area in 1945.

===Sheppard Nunatak===
A conical nunatak high which stands close north of Sheppard Point, the north side of the entrance to Hope Bay. 
This area was first explored by a party of the SwedAE 1901-04. 
The nunatak was charted in 1945 by the FIDS, and named by them for its association with Sheppard Point.

===Sheppard Point===
A point marking the north side of the entrance to Hope Bay, at the northeast end of Antarctic Peninsula. 
Discovered by a party under J. Gunnar Andersson of the SwedAE, 1901–04, who wintered at Hope Bay in 1903. 
Named by the FIDS for R. Sheppard, Master of the Eagle who, in February 1945, landed the party which established a FIDS scientific station at Hope Bay.

===Contact Point===
A small rock point close west of Sheppard Point on the north side of Hope Bay. 
The feature was first charted as an island by the SwedAE, 1901–04, but was surveyed by the FIDS in 1955 and proved to be a point. 
So named by FIDS because greywacke, tuff and diorite were found to be exposed on or very close to this point. 
Such contacts had not previously been recorded and they were important for the interpretation of the geology of Tabarin Peninsula.

==Western features==
Nearby features to the west of the head of the bay include, from west to east,

===Mount Taylor===
A large, flat-topped mountain, high, having steep cliffs on the northeast side, standing west-southwest of the head of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by the SwedAE, 1901–04, under Nordenskjold. 
The mountain was charted by the FIDS in 1946 and named in 1948 by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) for Captain A. Taylor, commander of the FIDS and leader of its base at Hope Bay in 1945.

===Eddy Col===
A steep-sided rocky col between Mount Taylor and Blade Ridge, southwest of the head of Hope Bay.
Surveyed in 1955 by the FIDS, who applied the descriptive name; the wind direction varies continually in this col.

===Blade Ridge===
A sharp rock ridge marked by three peaks, the highest , forming the northwest wall of Depot Glacier near the head of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by the SwedAE, 1901–04, under Nordenskjold. 
The descriptive name was given by the FIDS following their survey of the area in 1945.

===Whitten Peak===
A pyramidal peak, high, forming the northeast end of Blade Ridge at the west side of the head of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by the SwedAE, 1901–04, under Nordenskjold. 
Named by the FIDS for R. Whitten, first mate of the ship Eagle, which participated in FIDS operations in 1944-45.

===Twin Peaks===
Two sharply defined peaks, high, standing together north of Mount Taylor and west of the head of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by the SwedAE, 1901–04, under Nordenskjold. 
Named by the FIDS following their survey of the area in 1946.

===Arena Glacier===
A glacier long, flowing northeast from Mount Taylor into Hope Bay southwest of Sheppard Point.
Mapped in 1948 and 1955 by the FIDS and so named by them because the flat ice floor of the glacier&#x27;s upper half, surrounded by the steep slopes of Twin Peaks, Mount Taylor and Blade Ridge, resembles an arena.

==Southern features==
Features along or near the south shore of the bay include, from west to east,

===Scar Hills===
A small ridge of hills, with numerous glacial striae, extending from the head of Hope Bay northeast along the southeast shore. 
Discovered and named &quot;Schrammenhiigel&quot; by a party under J. Gunnar Andersson of the SwedAE, 1901-04.
An English translation of the name has been approved.

===Lake Hope===
A small lake lying north of Mount Flora, close east of the head of Hope Bay. 
Named after nearby Hope Bay by Argentine parties working in the area.

===Mount Flora===
A mountain, high, containing a well-defined cirque which faces NE, standing southeast of the head of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by the SwedAE under Nordenskjold, 1901–04, and named by J. Gunnar Andersson, second-incommand of the expedition who discovered flora fossils of the Jurassic period in certain strata of this mountain.

===Nobby Nunatak===
A nunatak, high, standing south of Lake Boeckella and east of Mount Flora. 
Nobby Nunatak was first charted and named by the FIDS in 1945. 
The name is descriptive.

===The Crest===
The summit, high, of a moraine just east of Lake Boeckella and south of Hut Cove. 
Mapped in 1945 and 1948 by the FIDS. 
The feature marks the summit of the initial steep slope up from the FIDS station at Hope Bay. 
The name originated locally in about 1945.

===Lake Boeckella===
A small lake which lies south of Hope Bay and drains by a small stream into Eagle Cove, at the northeast end of Antarctic Peninsula.
Discovered and named by the SwedAE, 1901–04, under Nordenskjold. Boeckella is a species of crustacean found in this area.

===Eagle Cove===
A small cove immediately west of Seal Point along the south side of Hope Bay. 
Discovered by J. Gunnar Andersson&#x27;s party of the SwedAE, 1901–04, who wintered at Hope Bay in 1903. 
Named by the FIDS after the ship &quot;Eagle&quot;, which participated in the establishment of the FIDS base at Hope Bay in 1945.

===Seal Point===
A point which extends north from the southeast shore of Hope Bay between Eagle Cove and Hut Cove, at the northeast end of Antarctic Peninsula.
Discovered by a party under J. Gunnar Andersson of the SwedAE, 1901–04, and so named because the party relieved their shortage of food and fuel by killing a seal on this point.

===Hut Cove===
A small cove in the east part of Hope Bay between Seal Point and Grunden Rock. 
Discovered by a party under J. Gunnar Andersson of the SwedAE, 1901–04, who wintered at Hope Bay in 1903. 
So named in 1945 by the FIDS because they, like the SwedAE, established a base hut on the south shore of this cove.

===Jagged Rocks===
A group of jagged rocks lying near the center of Hut Cove in the east part of Hope Bay. 
First charted in 1903 by a party under J. Gunner Andersson of the SwedAE. Named by the FIDS in 1945.

===Grunden Rock===
A rock high high, surrounded by a group of smaller rocks, lying close east of Hut Cove along the south side of the entrance to Hope Bay. 
Discovered by the SwedAE under Nordenskjold, 1901-04. 
The FIDS in 1945 named the entire group of rocks for Toralf Grunden, member of the SwedAE who wintered at Hope Bay in 1903, but in 1952 the name was restricted to the largest rock in this group for easier reference to the light beacon established on the main rock by the Argentine government during the previous season.

===Stone Point===
A point with a small islet lying off it, marking the south side of the entrance to Hope Bay.
Named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) for H.W. Stone, First Mate on the &quot;Trepassey&quot;, 1946–47, following a survey by Lieutenant Commander F.W. Hunt, RN, in 1952.

<text>The Antarctic Sound is a body of water about long and from wide, separating the Joinville Island group from the northeast end of the Antarctic Peninsula. The sound was named by the Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskjöld for the expedition ship &quot;Antarctic&quot; which in 1902, under the command of Carl Anton Larsen, was the first vessel to navigate it. Since 1998 cruise ships have been visiting the area.

==Geography==
The Antarctic Sound is the stretch of water that separates Trinity Peninsula, the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, from the Joinville Island group which consists of D&#x27;Urville Island, Joinville Island, Dundee Island and the smaller Bransfield Island. The northern limit of the sound, where it joins the Bransfield Strait, is the line connecting Cape Dubouzet (63°16&#x27;S, 57°03&#x27;W) on Trinity Peninsula with Turnbull Point (63°02&#x27;S, 56°36&#x27;W) on D&#x27;Urville Island. The southern limit is the line connecting Cape Scrymgeour on Andersson Island (63°35&#x27;S, 56°26&#x27;W) with Cape Purvis on Dundee Island (63°35&#x27;S, 55°58&#x27;W). Close to the north of Andersson Island lies the smaller Jonassen Island, the two being separated by the Yalour Strait which joins the Antarctic Sound to the Erebus and Terror Gulf part of the Weddell Sea. The sound is long and from wide. The Tabarin Peninsula forms the southwestern coast of the Antarctic Sound and contains several bays, the main ones being Hope Bay and Trepassey Bay. Cube Rock lies in the southern entrance southeast of Cape Scrymgeour.

==History==

The Antarctic Sound was first navigated by the vessel &quot;Antarctic&quot; belonging to the Swedish Antarctic Expedition of 1902, captained by Otto Nordenskjöld. Frequently clogged by pack ice, particularly tabular icebergs broken from the Larsen Ice Shelf, it is deceptive and difficult to traverse, and in the year after its first navigation, the same vessel was trapped and crushed by the ice, the ship&#x27;s crew spending the winter at Hope Bay. Another vessel trying to navigate the sound en route for Snow Hill Island in 1920, failed to get through and could not even reach Hope Bay, and &quot;Operation Tabarin&quot; in 1944 was beset by similar problems. Hope Bay was at one time the site of a British base, and there is now a permanently staffed Argentinian research station there called Esperanza Base.

==Fauna==
Hope Bay has been recognised as an Important Bird Area. Birds that breed here include the gentoo penguin, brown skua, Antarctic tern, Wilson&#x27;s storm petrel, kelp gull and snowy sheathbill. It also houses one of the largest breeding colonies of Adélie penguin in Antarctica. At Trepassey Bay, gentoo and Adélie penguins also breed, as well as Cape petrels, snow petrels, skuas and kelp gulls. Weddell seals often haul out on the beach and leopard seals hunt offshore.

<doc id="1158225" wikidata="Q14864606" url="?curid=1158225" title="Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase">
<text>Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) is an enzyme encoded in humans by the &quot;HPRT1&quot; gene.

HGPRT is a transferase that catalyzes conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate and guanine to guanosine monophosphate. This reaction transfers the 5-phosphoribosyl group from 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to the purine. HGPRT plays a central role in the generation of purine nucleotides through the purine salvage pathway.

== Function ==

HGPRT catalyzes the following reactions:

HGPRTase functions primarily to salvage purines from degraded DNA to reintroduce into purine synthetic pathways. In this role, it catalyzes the reaction between guanine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form GMP, or between hypoxanthine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form inosine monophosphate.
== Substrates and inhibitors ==

Comparative homology modelling of this enzyme in &quot;L. donovani&quot; suggest that among all of the computationally screened compounds, pentamidine, 1,3-dinitroadamantane, acyclovir and analogs of acyclovir had higher binding affinities than the real substrate (guanosine monophosphate).
The in silico and in-vitro correlation of these compounds were test in Leishmania HGPRT and validates the result.

== Role in disease ==
Mutations in the gene lead to hyperuricemia. At least 67 disease-causing mutations in this gene have been discovered:
* Some men have partial (up to 20% less activity of the enzyme) HGPRT deficiency that causes high levels of uric acid in the blood, which leads to the development of gouty arthritis and the formation of uric acid stones in the urinary tract. This condition has been named the Kelley–Seegmiller syndrome.
* Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is due to deficiency of HGPRT caused by HPRT1 mutation.
* Some mutations have been linked to gout, the risk of which is increased in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency.
* HPRT expression on the mRNA and protein level is induced by hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF1A). HIF-1 is a transcription factor that directs an array of cellular responses that are used for adaptation during oxygen deprivation. This finding implies that HPRT is a critical pathway that helps preserve the cell&#x27;s purine nucleotide resources under hypoxic conditions as found in pathology such as myocardial ischemia.

== Creation of hybridomas ==

Hybridomas are immortal (immune to cellular senescence), HGPRT+ cells that result from fusion of mortal, HGPRT+ plasma cells and immortal, HGPRT− myeloma cells. They are created to produce monoclonal antibodies in biotechnology. HAT medium inhibits de novo synthesis of nucleic acids, killing myeloma cells that cannot switch over to the salvage pathway, due to lack of HPRT1. The plasma cells in the culture eventually die from senescence, leaving pure hybridoma cells.

<text>In microeconomics, in a standard trade model with two products, an isovalue line is the vector of combinations for which the market value of total production is constant. The formula for isovalue line V is:

formula_1

in which:

Q is quantity

P is price

x and y are products.

For example: Assume an economy that only produces bread and wine and in which relative prices are fixed, say one bottle of wine equals the price of three breads. The isovalue line V (in a graph with bread as &quot;x&quot; and wine as &quot;y&quot;) slopes less than 45° downward. The exact slope is derived from the wine/bread price relation, in this case -1/3.

<text>The Cook Mountains () is a group of mountains bounded by the Mulock and Darwin glaciers in Antarctica.
They are south of the Worcester Range and north of the Darwin Mountains and the Britannia Range.

==Early exploration and naming==

Parts of the group were first viewed from the Ross Ice Shelf by the British National Antarctic Expedition (BrNAE) of 1901–04. Additional portions of these mountains were mapped by a New Zealand party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE) of 1956–58, and they were completely mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from tellurometer surveys and US Navy air photos, 1959–63.
Named by the NZ-APC for Captain James Cook.

==Location==

The Cook Mountains are bounded by the Darwin Glacier to the south, which separates the range from the Darwin Mountains.
The Ross Ice Shelf lies to the east and the Mulock Glacier to the north, which separates it from the Worcester Range.
To the west is the Darwin Névé and the Antarctic ice sheet.

==Glaciers==

Glaciers leaving the mountains, clockwise from the north, are:

===Heap Glacier===
Glacier long flowing northeastward to Mulock Glacier, to the east of Henry Mesa.
Mapped by the USGS from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1959-63.

===Carlyon Glacier=== 
A large glacier which flows east-south-east from the névé east of Mill Mountain to the Ross Ice Shelf at Cape Murray.
Mapped in 1958 by the Darwin Glacier party of the CTAE (1956-58).
Named by the NZ-APC for R.A. Carlyon, who with H.H. Ayres, made up the party.

===Diamond Glacier===
A small distributary glacier of the Darwin Glacier, flowing east-north-east into the narrow valley on the north side of Diamond Hill.

===Touchdown Glacier===
A tributary of Darwin Glacier, flowing south between Roadend Nunatak and the Brown Hills.
Mapped by the VUWAE (1962-63)
and so named because the glacier was used as a landing site for aircraft supporting the expedition.

===McCleary Glacier===
A broad glacier about long, draining southward into Darwin Glacier just west of Tentacle Ridge.
Mapped by the USGS from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1959-63.

===Dot Peak=== 
A small eminence, , marking the highest point of Cooper Nunatak, at the east side of the Brown Hills.
Mapped by the VUWAE (1962-63) and so named because of its small size.

===Schoonmaker Ridge===
A jagged ridge, 4.5 nautical miles (8 km) long, that runs east from the south part of Reeves Plateau, Cook Mountains. Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after remote sensing scientist James W. (Bill) Schoonmaker, Jr., topographic engineer, United States Geological Survey (USGS). He spent three austral summers in Antarctica, 1972–76, with geodetic work at South Pole, Byrd Station, Antarctic Peninsula, Ellsworth Mountains and Ross Ice Shelf, where he determined the precise location of geophysical sites established during the Ross Ice Shelf Project, 1973-74 field season.

===Soyuz-13 Rock===
A nunatak, high, located 2 nautical miles (3.7 km) southeast of Schoonmaker Ridge in the Cook Mountains.

A line of east-facing rock bluffs, long, situated west of Cape Murray in the Cook Mountains.
Discovered by the BrNAE (1901-04) under Capt. Robert F. Scott, who gave the name &quot;Mount Reeves,&quot; after Edward A. Reeves, Map Curator to the Royal Geographical Society, to a summit along this bluff. The bluff was mapped in detail by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy aerial photography (1959-63). Since a prominent mountain does not rise from the bluffs, and because the name Mount Reeves is in use elsewhere in Antarctica, the US-ACAN (1965) recommended that the original name be amended and that the entire line of bluffs be designated as Reeves Bluffs. Not: Mount Reeves.

===Cheney Bluff===

===Fontaine Bluff===
Bluff west of Cape Murray on the south side of Carlyon Glacier.
Mapped by the USGS from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1959-63.

A large flat-topped mountain (2,730 m) forming the eastern end of Festive Plateau.
This mountain was probably sighted by the BrNAE (1901-04) under Capt. Robert F. Scott, who gave the name &quot;Mount Mill,&quot; after British Antarctic historian Hugh Robert Mill, to a summit in nearby Reeves Bluffs.
This area was mapped by USGS from surveys and U.S. Navy photography (1959-63).
A prominent mountain does not rise from the bluffs, and since the name Mount Mill is in use elsewhere in Antarctica, the US-ACAN (1965) altered the original name to Mill Mountain and applied it to the prominent mountain described.

<doc id="1158235" wikidata="Q898268" url="?curid=1158235" title="Debye length">
<text>In plasmas and electrolytes, the Debye length formula_1 (Debye radius or Debye–Hückel screening length), is a measure of a charge carrier&#x27;s net electrostatic effect in a solution and how far its electrostatic effect persists. With each Debye length the charges are increasingly electrically screened and the electric potential decreases in magnitude by e. A Debye sphere is a volume whose radius is the Debye length. Debye length is an important parameter in plasma physics, electrolytes, and colloids (DLVO theory).

The Debye length for a plasma consisting of particles with density formula_2, charge formula_3, and temperature formula_4 is given by formula_5. The corresponding Debye screening wavenumber is given by formula_6. The analogous quantities at very low temperatures (formula_7) are known as the Thomas–Fermi length and the Thomas–Fermi wavenumber, respectively. They are of interest in describing the behaviour of electrons in metals at room temperature and warm dense matter.

The Debye length is named after the Dutch-American physicist and chemist Peter Debye (1884–1966), a Nobel laureate in Chemistry.

== Physical origin ==
The Debye length arises naturally in the description of a substance with mobile charges, such as a plasma, electrolyte solution, or semiconductor. In such a substance, charges naturally screen out electric fields induced in the substance, with a certain characteristic length. That characteristic length is the Debye length.

Its value can be mathematically derived for a system of formula_8 different species of charged particles, where the formula_9-th species carries charge formula_10 and has concentration formula_11 at position formula_12.
The distribution of charged particles within this medium gives rise to an electric potential formula_13 that satisfies Poisson&#x27;s equation:
formula_14
where formula_15 is the medium&#x27;s permitivity, and formula_16 is any static charge density that is not part of the medium.

The mobile charges don&#x27;t only affect formula_13, but are also affected by formula_13 due to the corresponding Coulomb force, formula_19.
If we further assume the system to be at temperature formula_4, then the charge concentration formula_11 may be considered, under the assumptions of mean field theory, to tend toward the Boltzmann distribution,
formula_22
where formula_23 is the Boltzmann constant and where formula_24 is the mean
concentration of charges of species formula_9.

Identifying the instantaneous concentrations and potential in the Poisson equation with their mean-field counterparts in the Boltzmann distribution yields the Poisson–Boltzmann equation:
formula_26

Solutions to this nonlinear equation are known for some simple systems. Solutions for more general systems may be obtained in the high-temperature (weak coupling) limit, formula_27, by Taylor expanding the exponential:
formula_28

This approximation yields the linearized Poisson–Boltzmann equation
formula_29
which also is known as the Debye–Hückel equation:
The second term on the right-hand side vanishes for systems that are electrically neutral. The term in parentheses divided by formula_15 has the units of an inverse length squared, and by
dimensional analysis leads to the definition of the characteristic length scale:

Substituting this length scale into the Debye–Hückel equation and neglecting the second and third terms on the right side yields the much simplified form formula_31. As the only characteristic length scale in the Debye–Hückel equation, formula_1 sets the scale for variations in the potential and in the concentrations of charged species. All charged species contribute to the Debye length in the same way, regardless of the sign of their charges.

To illustrate Debye screening, one can consider the example of a point charge placed in a plasma. The external charge density is then formula_33, and the resulting potential is
formula_34
The bare Coulomb potential is exponentially screened by the medium, over a distance of the Debye length: this is called Debye screening or shielding.

The Debye length may be expressed in terms of the Bjerrum length formula_35 as
formula_36
where formula_37 is the integer charge number that relates the charge on the formula_9-th ionic
species to the elementary charge formula_39.

== In a plasma ==
For a weakly collisional plasma, Debye shielding can be introduced in a very intuitive way by taking into account the granular character of such a plasma. Let us imagine a sphere about one of its electrons, and compare the number of electrons crossing this sphere with and without Coulomb repulsion. With repulsion, this number is smaller. Therefore, according to Gauss theorem, the apparent charge of the first electron is smaller than in the absence of repulsion. The larger the sphere radius, the larger is the number of deflected electrons, and the smaller the apparent charge: this is Debye shielding. Since the global deflection of particles includes the contributions of many other ones, the density of the electrons does not change, at variance with the shielding at work next to a Langmuir probe (Debye sheath). Ions bring a similar contribution to shielding, because of the attractive Coulombian deflection of charges with opposite signs.

This intuitive picture leads to an effective calculation of Debye shielding (see section II.A.2 of ). The assumption of a Boltzmann distribution is not necessary in this calculation: it works for whatever particle distribution function. The calculation also avoids approximating weakly collisional plasmas as continuous media. An N-body calculation reveals that the bare Coulomb acceleration of a particle by another one is modified by a contribution mediated by all other particles, a signature of Debye shielding (see section 8 of ). When starting from random particle positions, the typical time-scale for shielding to set in is the time for a thermal particle to cross a Debye length, i.e. the inverse of the plasma frequency. Therefore in a weakly collisional plasma, collisions play an essential role by bringing a cooperative self-organization process: Debye shielding. This shielding is important to get a finite diffusion coefficient in the calculation of Coulomb scattering (Coulomb collision).

In a non-isothermic plasma, the temperatures for electrons and heavy species may differ while the background medium may be treated as the vacuum and the Debye length is
formula_40
where

* is the Debye length,
* is the permittivity of free space,
* is the Boltzmann constant,
* is the charge of an electron,
* and are the temperatures of the electrons and ions, respectively,
* is the density of electrons,
* is the density of atomic species &quot;j&quot;, with positive ionic charge &quot;zjqe&quot;

Even in quasineutral cold plasma, where ion contribution virtually seems to be larger due to lower ion temperature, the ion term is actually often dropped, giving
formula_41
although this is only valid when the mobility of ions is negligible compared to the process&#x27;s timescale. A useful form of this equation is 
formula_42
where formula_1 is in cm, formula_44 in eV, and formula_45 in 1/cm3.

=== Typical values ===
In space plasmas where the electron density is relatively low, the Debye length may reach macroscopic values, such as in the magnetosphere, solar wind, interstellar medium and intergalactic medium. See the table here below:

== In an electrolyte solution ==
In an electrolyte or a colloidal suspension, the Debye length for a monovalent electrolyte is usually denoted with symbol 
formula_46

where
* is the ionic strength of the electrolyte in number/m3 units,
* is the permittivity of free space,
* is the dielectric constant,
* is the Boltzmann constant,
* is the absolute temperature in kelvins,
* is the elementary charge,

or, for a symmetric monovalent electrolyte,
formula_47
where
* is the gas constant,
* is the Faraday constant,
* is the electrolyte concentration in molar units (M or mol/L).

Alternatively,
formula_48
where formula_35 is the Bjerrum length of the medium in nm,
and the factor formula_50 derives from transforming unit volume from cubic dm to cubic nm.

For deionized water at room temperature, at pH=7, &quot;λ&quot;B ≈ 1μm.

At room temperature (), one can consider in water the relation:
formula_51
where
* is expressed in nanometres (nm)
* is the ionic strength expressed in molar (M or mol/L)
There is a method of estimating an approximate value of the Debye length in liquids using conductivity, which is described in ISO Standard, and the book.

== In semiconductors ==

The Debye length has become increasingly significant in the modeling of solid state devices as improvements in lithographic technologies have enabled smaller geometries.

The Debye length of semiconductors is given:
formula_52
where
* is the dielectric constant,
* is the Boltzmann constant,
* is the absolute temperature in kelvins,
* is the elementary charge, and
* is the net density of dopants (either donors or acceptors).

When doping profiles exceed the Debye length, majority carriers no longer behave according to the distribution of the dopants. Instead, a measure of the profile of the doping gradients provides an &quot;effective&quot; profile that better matches the profile of the majority carrier density.

In the context of solids, Thomas–Fermi screening length may be required instead of Debye length.

<text>King of the Hill is a 1993 American coming-of-age drama film written and directed by Steven Soderbergh. Adapted from A.E. Hotchner&#x27;s Depression-era memoir, the film follows a young boy navigating life alone in a hotel after his mother is hospitalized and his father is oftentimes absent. It stars Jesse Bradford as Aaron, alongside Jeroen Krabbé and Lisa Eichhorn as his parents. The cast also includes Spalding Gray, Adrien Brody, Karen Allen and Lauryn Hill in supporting roles.

The film received universal critical acclaim for its storytelling and rich character development. It marked the second time Soderbergh directed from his own screenplay, following his 1989 Academy Award-nominated film &quot;Sex, Lies, and Videotape.&quot; In 1993, the film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. it was named one of the top ten films of 1993 by &quot;Time&quot; and Entertainment Weekly. In 2024, &quot;British GQ&quot; ranked it as the best film of Soderbergh&#x27;s career. It was released on Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection. 

==Plot==
Based on the Depression-era bildungsroman memoir of writer A. E. Hotchner, the film follows the story of a boy struggling to survive on his own in a hotel in St. Louis after his mother enters a sanatorium with tuberculosis and his younger brother is sent to live with an uncle. His father, a German immigrant and traveling salesman working for the Hamilton Watch Company, is off on long trips from which the boy cannot be certain he will return.

<doc id="1158240" wikidata="Q5225978" url="?curid=1158240" title="Darwin Glacier (Antarctica)">
<text>The Darwin Glacier () is a large glacier in Antarctica. It flows from the polar plateau eastward between the Darwin Mountains and the Cook Mountains to the Ross Ice Shelf. The Darwin and its major tributary the Hatherton are often treated as one system, the Darwin–Hatherton.
==Early exploration and naming==

The lower part of the glacier was mapped by the British National Antarctic Expedition, 1901–04 (BrNAE), and the whole area traversed by New Zealand parties of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1956–58). 
The glacier was named in association with the Darwin Mountains.

==Glaciology==

The Darwin Glacier flows relatively slowly compared to other glaciers in the Transantarctic Mountains, at less than per year.
There are small scale fluctuations due to daily tidal cycles downstream from its grounding line.
During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the Antarctic ice sheet expanded, forming grounded ice in the Ross Sea. 
This would cause the ice streams flowing into the Ross Sea to be buttressed and thickened, and there is some evidence to support this. 
However, there is contradictory evidence from the upper Hatherton Glacier that suggests the ice extent there was lower in the LGM than it is today.

Darwin and Hatherton glaciers both thinned steadily by about during the last deglaciation between 9,000 and 3,000 years ago.
It seems that they lost about half their catchment area to the Byrd Glacier and/or Mulock Glacier, and also that convergent ice flowing from the Byrd and Mulock glaciers strongly buttresses the Darwin and Hatherton glaciers.

==Course==
The Darwin Glacier originates in the Darwin Névé, on the west rim of the polar plateau.
It flows east past the Meteorite Hills of the Darwin Mountains to the south.
It turns to flow southeast past the Darwin Mountains to the southwest and the Brown Hills of the Cook Mountains to the north.
McCleary Glacier drains southward into Darwin Glacier east of Walker Cirque and just west of Tentacle Ridge.
It is joined from the north by the Touchdown Glacier between Roadend Nunatak and the Brown Hills.
The Diamond Glacier is a reentrant from the Darwin Glacier north into the Brown Hills.

The Hatherton Glacier forms south of the head of the Darwin Glacier, below Turnstile Ridge, and flows southeast.
The Lieske Glacier and Hinton Glacier enter the Hatherton Glacier from the south on either side of Dusky Ridge.
The Ragotzkie Glacier enters the Hatherton Glacier to the southwest of Junction Spur.
The Hatherton Glacier, which has turned to flow northeast, joins the Darwin Glacier east of Junction Spur.
The Darwin Glacier flows east through The Nozzle between Diamond Hill to the north and the Gawn Ice Piedmont to the south to enter the Ross Ice Shelf north of MacDonald Point.

==Head==

===Darwin Névé===
A large névé on the west side of the Cook and Darwin Mountains which feeds the Darwin and Hatherton Glaciers. 
Named for its association with Darwin Glacier by the N.Z. Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE, 1956-58.

===Circle Icefall===
An almost impenetrable icefall near Tentacle Ridge, high and long, extending in an arc for almost the whole width across the Darwin Glacier. 
Named by the Darwin Glacier Party of the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition (CTAE) (1956–58) for its similarity to the circle of an opera house.

==Tributaries==

===Green Glacier===
Glacier on the west side of Haskell Ridge, flowing north from the Darwin Mountains into Darwin Glacier. 
Mapped by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE, 1956–58, who named it because of the green color of its surface.

===McCleary Glacier===
A broad glacier about long, draining southward into Darwin Glacier just west of Tentacle Ridge. 
Mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1959-63. 
Named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) for George McCleary, public information officer on the staff of the U.S. Antarctic Projects Officer (1959–61), whose labors helped to start the Bulletin of the USAPO.

===Touchdown Glacier===
A tributary of Darwin Glacier, flowing south between Roadend Nunatak and the Brown Hills. 
Mapped by the VUWAE (1962–63) and so named because the glacier was used as a landing site for aircraft supporting the expedition.

===Diamond Glacier===

A small distributary glacier of the Darwin Glacier, flowing east-northeast into the narrow valley on the north side of Diamond Hill. 
Mapped by the VUWAE (1962–63) and named after Diamond Hill.

===Hatherton Glacier===
A large glacier flowing from the polar plateau generally eastward along the south side of the Darwin Mountains and entering Darwin Glacier at Junction Spur. 
Mapped by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956–58). 
Named for Trevor Hatherton, Scientific Officer in Charge of Antarctic Activities, Dept. of Scientific and Industrial Research, Wellington, New Zealand.

===Overturn Glacier===
A short tributary glacier of the Hatherton Glacier west of Junction Spur in the Darwin Mountains. 
The glacier is steep without crevasses. 
Named by the members of a New Zealand Antarctic Research Program (NZARP) field group who had a dramatic overturn with their toboggan while driving down the glacier.

===McCraw Glacier===
Glacier in the Britannia Range, draining the northwest slopes of Mount Olympus and flowing north, westward of Johnstone Ridge, to enter Hatherton Glacier. 
Named by a University of Waikato geological party, 1978–79, led by M.J. Selby. 
Named for John D. McCraw, Dean of Science, University of Waikato, Hamilton, N.Z., a member on a 1959-60 field party to the McMurdo Dry Valleys.

===Lieske Glacier===
A tributary glacier draining the north slopes of Mount Olympus in Britannia Range and flowing north between Johnstone and Dusky Ridges into Hatherton Glacier. 
Named by the US-ACAN for Bruce J. Lieske, meteorologist who wintered at Little America V in 1957.

===Hinton Glacier===
A tributary glacier in the Britannia Range, flowing north between Forbes Ridge and Dusky Ridge into Hatherton Glacier. 
Named by US-ACAN for Chief Construction Mechanic Clarence C. Hinton, Jr., USN. Hinton wintered at McMurdo Station, 1963, and headed a team charged with the maintenance of mechanical equipment at the outlying U.S. stations.

===Ragotzkie Glacier===
A glacier in the Britannia Range, about long, flowing northward along the west side of Mount Aldrich and coalescing with other north-flowing glaciers which enter the Hatherton Glacier to the southwest of Junction Spur. 
Named by US-ACAN for Robert A. Ragotzkie, project director for United States Antarctic Program (USARP) studies of lakes in the ice-free valleys. 
He made personal studies in Victoria Land in the 1962-63 season.

===Ragotzkie Icefall===

An icefall wide in the east-central part of Ragotzkie Glacier. 
The icefall is a significant distributary of Ragotzkie ice to Alley Glacier, which occupies the valley to the east. 
Named by US-ACAN in association with Ragotzkie Glacier.

===Alley Glacier===

A glacier that drains the north slopes of Britannia Range in the vicinity of Ward Tower and flows north to Darwin Glacier. 
Named by Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names (US-ACAN) after Richard B. Alley, Department of Geosciences, Pennsylvania State University, U.S. Antarctic Project (USAP) glaciologist who has specialized in the study of ice streams of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

==Other features==
===Walker Cirque===

Description: A prominent glacier-filled cirque at the west side of the terminus of McCleary Glacier in Cook Mountains. 
The cirque opens to Darwin Glacier near the head. 
Named after Carlton Walker, Facilities, Maintenance, and Construction Supervisor at South Pole Station during U.S. Antarctic Project (USAP) South Pole Station Modernization.

===Roadend Nunatak===
A conspicuous nunatak west-northwest of Bastion Hill along the north side of Darwin Glacier. 
So named by the Victoria University of Wellington Antarctic Expedition (VUWAE) (1962–63) because of its use as a landmark for manhauling sledge journeys and aircraft flights which supported the expedition and landed there.

===Island Arena===
A broad valley occupied by a lateral lobe of the Darwin Glacier, indenting the north side of the Darwin Mountains between Colosseum Ridge and Kenneth Ridge. 
An islandlike nunatak, Richardson Hill, rises above the ice of the valley. 
The descriptive name was given by the VUWAE (1962–63).

===Turnstile Ridge===
A ridge about long, lying north of Westhaven Nunatak at the northwest extremity of Britannia Range. 
So named by the Darwin Glacier Party (1957) of the CTAE because snow passages resembling turnstiles occur throughout its length.

===Junction Spur===
A rocky spur marking the eastern extremity of the Darwin Mountains and the junction of the Hatherton and Darwin Glaciers.
Mapped and named by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956–58).

===The Nozzle===
A comparatively narrow constriction through which the lower Darwin Glacier flows, causing the ice to bank up somewhat in the vicinity of Diamond Hill. 
The descriptive name was given by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956–58).

===Cranfield Icefalls===
A series of about eight spectacular icefalls, in an east-west line, falling steeply from Bucknell Ridge into the narrowest portion of Darwin Glacier near its mouth. 
Named by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956–58) for W.J. Cranfield, a member of the party.

===Gawn Ice Piedmont===
An ice piedmont and snow slope occupying the coastal platform between Darwin Glacier and Byrd Glacier. 
Named by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956–58) for J.E. Gawn, radio operator at Scott Base who worked closely with the field parties.

===MacDonald Point===
A coastal point with some rocky exposures at the south side of the mouth of Darwin Glacier, where the latter flows into Ross Ice Shelf. 
Mapped by the USGS from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1959-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for James H. (Scot) MacDonald, journalist who as a member of U.S. Navy Squadron VX-6 worked several seasons at McMurdo Station between 1958 and 1961.

<doc id="1158247" wikidata="Q157555" url="?curid=1158247" title="Digitalis purpurea">
<text>Digitalis purpurea, the foxglove or common foxglove, is a toxic species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae, native to and widespread throughout most of temperate Europe. It has also naturalized in parts of North America, as well as some other temperate regions. The plant is a popular garden subject, with many cultivars available. It is the original source of the heart medicine digoxin (also called digitalis or digitalin). This biennial plant grows as a rosette of leaves in the first year after sowing, before flowering and then dying in the second year (i.e., it is monocarpic). It generally produces enough seeds so that new plants will continue to grow in a garden setting.

==Description==
&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; is an herbaceous biennial or short-lived perennial plant. The leaves are spirally arranged, simple, long and broad, and are covered with gray-white pubescent and glandular hairs, imparting a woolly texture. The foliage forms a tight rosette at ground level in the first year.

The flowering stem develops in the second year, typically tall, sometimes longer. The flowers are arranged in a showy, terminal, elongated cluster, and each flower is tubular and pendent. The flowers are typically purple, but some plants, especially those under cultivation, may be pink, rose, yellow, or white. The inside surface of the flower tube is heavily spotted. The flowering period is early summer, sometimes with additional flower stems developing later in the season. The plant is frequented by bees, which climb right inside the flower tube to gain the nectar within.

The fruit is a capsule which splits open at maturity to release the numerous tiny 0.1-0.2 mm seeds.
== Distribution ==

=== Native range ===
Digitalis purpurea has a native range that spans across several countries in Western Europe and North Africa. In Western Europe, it is native to Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In North Africa the species can be found in Morocco. Additionally, it occurs naturally on the islands of Corsica and Sardinia.

=== Introduced range ===
&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; has been introduced throughout the world into countries and continents outside of its natural range. Due to introductions, the species has expanded its range further into Europe and Africa, as well as colonizing continents outside of the natural range, including Asia, North America, South America, and Oceania.

&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; has been introduced extensively throughout Europe, including Austria, the Baltic States, Belarus, Denmark, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Réunion, and Ukraine. It has also found its way to the Azores, the Canary Islands, Central European Russia, Madeira, and the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands.

In North America, it has been introduced into more than twenty states of the United States: Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In Canada, it has colonized multiple provinces, including British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Québec.

In South America, &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; has been introduced into Argentina, specifically in the regions of Northeast, Northwest, and South. It also can be found in Bolivia, Brazil (specifically the South and Southeast regions), Chile (Central region), Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico (Central, Gulf, Northeast, Southeast, and Southwest regions), Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; has made its way to various regions of Asia, including China (specifically the South-Central and Southeast regions), Korea, and Vietnam. In Africa, it can be found in Malawi and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, it has been introduced to the island nations of New Zealand, both the North and South Islands. It is also an established weed across multiple locations in Tasmania, Australia.

==Subspecies and hybrids==
*&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;purpurea&quot; – most of Europe and Macaronesia and widely introduced to other parts of the world.
*&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;amandiana &quot; – northern Portugal (specifically around the Douro Basin).
*&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;mauretanica &quot; – Morocco.
*&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;toletana&quot; – central Spain.
* &quot;Digitalis&quot; × &quot;fulva&quot; 1821 (hybrid formula: &quot;D. grandiflora&quot; × &quot;purpurea&quot;).
&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;mariana&quot; is a synonym for &quot;D. mariana&quot; subsp. &quot;mariana&quot;, and &quot;D. purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;heywoodii&quot; is a synonym for &quot;D. mariana&quot; subsp. &quot;heywoodii&quot;.

&quot;D. dubia&quot;, a name used for populations of foxglove growing among calciferous rocks on shady cliff faces on the island of Majorca, is now considered a synonym of &quot;D. minor&quot;, but until recently it had been either considered to be a valid species (i.e. in the &quot;Flora Europaea&quot; (1976), and the &quot;Euro+Med Plantbase&quot; (2011)), as well as classified as &quot;D. purpurea&quot; subsp. &quot;dubia&quot; in 1922, or &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; f. &quot;dubia&quot; by Spanish taxonomists in 1983.

==Ecology==
&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; grows in acidic soils, in partial sunlight to deep shade, in a range of habitats, including open woods, woodland clearings, moorland and heath margins, sea-cliffs, rocky mountain slopes and hedge banks. It is commonly found and readily colonises sites where the ground has been disturbed, such as recently cleared woodland, or where the vegetation has been burnt. It also colonises areas of land that have been disturbed by clear-felling and by construction projects, being among the first wildflowers to reappear, often in large quantities. Foxgloves are eurytopic plants, as their seeds germinate when exposed to light; for this reason, they are generally absent from shaded areas, such as within woodlands.

&quot;D. purpurea&quot; is most successful in humus-rich soil, but it can succeed in any soil that isn&#x27;t too wet nor too dry; either way, the common foxglove only needs a small amount of soil for survival.

Larvae of the foxglove pug (&quot;Eupithecia pulchellata&quot;), a moth, consume the flowers of the common foxglove for food. The caterpillars of this moth crawl into the newly opening flowers, one caterpillar to a flower. It then spins a silken web over the mouth of the flower, sealing it, and then proceeds to feed on the stamens and developing seeds. When the other uninfected flowers fall off, the corolla of the infected flowers remain on the plant, and the caterpillar then pupates in the flower. The species is uncommon, it has been recorded in Britain, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. Other species of Lepidoptera have been recorded eating the leaves, including &quot;Mellicta athalia&quot; and &quot;Xestia ashworthii&quot; in Britain, &quot;Eurodryas aurinia&quot; in Romania, and &quot;Mellicta deione&quot; in Portugal.

==Genetics==

The colours of the petals of the &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; are known to be determined by at least three genes that interact with each other.

The M gene determines the production of a purple pigment, a type of anthocyanin. The m gene does not produce this pigment. The D gene is an enhancer of the M gene, and leads it to produce a large amount of the pigment. The d gene does not enhance the M gene, and only a small amount of pigment is produced. Lastly, the W gene causes the pigment be deposited only in some spots, while the w gene allows the pigment to be spread all over the flower.

This combination leads to four phenotypes:

*M/_; W/_; _/_ = a white flower with purple spots;
*m/m; _/_; _/_ = an albino flower with yellow spots;
*M/_; w/w; d/d = a light purple flower;
*M/_; w/w; D/_ = a dark purple flower.

==Cultivation ==
The plant is a popular ornamental, providing height and colour in late spring and early summer. Cultivated forms often show flowers completely surrounding the central spike, in contrast to the wild form, where the flowers only appear on one side. Numerous cultivars have been developed with a range of colours. Seeds are frequently sold as a mixture (e.g. Excelsior hybrids, in shades of white, pink and purple). Some strains are easily grown by the novice gardener, while others are more challenging. They may also be purchased as potted plants in the spring.

&quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; is hardy down to (USDA zones 4–9).

&quot;Digitalis&quot; × &quot;mertonensis&quot; (the strawberry foxglove)
== Toxicity ==
Due to the presence of the cardiac glycoside digitoxin, the leaves, flowers and seeds of this plant are all poisonous to humans and some animals and can be fatal if ingested.

The main toxins in &quot;Digitalis&quot; spp. are the two chemically similar cardiac glycosides: digitoxin and digoxin. Like other cardiac glycosides, these toxins exert their effects by inhibiting the ATPase activity of a complex of transmembrane proteins that form the sodium potassium ATPase pump, (Na+/K+-ATPase). Inhibition of the Na+/K+-ATPase in turn causes a rise not only in intracellular Na+, but also in calcium, which in turn results in increased force of myocardial muscle contractions. In other words, at precisely the right dosage, &quot;Digitalis&quot; toxin can cause the heart to beat more strongly. However, digitoxin, digoxin and several other cardiac glycosides, such as ouabain, have narrow therapeutic windows (i.e., because of their steep dose-response curves, minute increases in the dosage of these drugs can make the difference between an ineffective dose and a fatal one). There are now better options with a wider therapeutic window.

Symptoms of &quot;Digitalis&quot; poisoning include a low pulse rate, nausea, vomiting, and uncoordinated contractions of different parts of the heart, leading to cardiac arrest and finally death.

=== Medicinal use ===
Extracted from the leaves, this same cardiac glycoside digitoxin is used as a medication for heart failure. Its clinical use was pioneered by William Withering, who recognized it &quot;reduced dropsy&quot;, increased urine flow, and had a powerful effect on the heart by making it beat slower but more efficiently waiting for the heart to fill with blood before pumping. During World War II, County Herb Committees were established to collect medicinal herbs when German blockades created shortages; this included &quot;Digitalis purpurea&quot; which was used to regulate heartbeat.

<text>The Darwin Mountains () are a group of mountains between the Darwin Glacier and Hatherton Glacier in Antarctica. They were discovered by the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901–04) and named for Major Leonard Darwin, at that time Honorary Secretary of the Royal Geographical Society.
They are south of the Cook Mountains and north of the Britannia Range

==Location==

The Darwin Mountains are bounded by the Hatherton Glacier which flows southeast past its west side, then turns and flows northeast past Junction Spur at the eastern tip of the mountains to join Darwin Glacier.
Darwin Glacier defines the northeast and north boundary of the mountains.
Darwin Névé lies to the west.
The Meteorite Hills are the western end of the mountains.
Further east the Haskell Ridge and Colosseum Ridge extend into Darwin Glacier.
Mount Ellis rises about the Midnight Plateau. Mount Ash overlooks the lower Hatherton Glacier.
In the northeast Kennett Ridge rises above the Island Arena and Richardson Hill.

==Southern features==

===Scheuermann Spur===
A broad ice-covered limb of the Darwin Mountains between the head of the Hatherton Glacier and the west end of Prebble Icefalls. 
The feature has a relatively flat summit area about high that tapers southward to a narrow snout. 
A rock cliff marks the west side facing Hatherton Glacier. 
Named after Mike Scheuermann, Air Projects Specialist, Office of Polar Programs, NSF, 1995-2001; former Navy liaison to OPP from United States Navy.

===Harvey Cirque===
A cirque containing a small glacier between Scheuermann Spur and Corell Cirque in the south part of the Darwin Mountains. 
The cirque occurs along the extensive Prebble Icefalls which contributes some ice to the head of the cirque; there is limited flow from the cirque to Hatherton Glacier. 
Named after geologist Ralph P. Harvey of Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, engaged in the United States Antarctic Project (United States ArmyP) Antarctic Search for Meteorites in the Transantarctic Mountains for many austral summers, 1992-2001, ultimately as ANSMET principal investigator.

===Corell Cirque===
A large cirque containing a glacier between Harvey Cirque and Duncan Bluff in the south part of the Darwin Mountains. 
Located at the east end of the extensive Prebble Icefalls, the cirque channels some of the ice from the Midnight Plateau icecap into the Hatherton Glacier. 
Named after Robert Corell, who headed the Geosciences Directorate at the NSF, 1987-99, which for many years included the Foundation&#x27;s Polar Research, and chaired national and international groups evaluating global change.

===Duncan Bluff===
A steep rock bluff along the north side of Hatherton Glacier. 
It rises to high between Corell Cirque and Conant Valley in the Darwin Mountains. 
In association with the names of communication workers grouped in this area, named after Patrick Duncan Smith of the Office of Polar Programs, NSF, 1995-2001, information technology specialist for the United States Antarctic Project (United States ArmyP) with responsibility for projects that access communication satellites as well as Antarctic communication with the outside world.

===Conant Valley===
A valley between Duncan Bluff and Communication Heights in the south part of Darwin Mountains. 
The valley mouth opens to Hatherton Glacier. 
Named after Neil Conant, communications operator in support of the United States Antarctic Project (United States ArmyP) in 15 austral summers, 1984-2001; three summers were at Siple Station in the 1980s, the remainder at South Pole Station.

===Grant Valley===
A valley between Communication Heights and Mount Ash in the Darwin Mountains. 
A lobe of ice from Hatherton Glacier occupies the mouth of the valley. 
Named after Bettie Kathryn (B.K.) Grant, Information Systems Supervisor at South Pole Station. 
She made 11 deployments to Antarctica, 1990-2001, the last 10 to South Pole Station where she wintered, 1993.

===Mount Ash===
Mountain, high, overlooking the north side of Hatherton Glacier west-southwest of Junction Spur. 
Mapped by the USGS from tellurometer surveys and Navy air photos, 1959-63. 
Named by US-ACAN for Ralph E. Ash, mechanic, a member of the United States McMurdo-Pole traverse party, 1960-61.

==Northern features==
Northern features, from west to east, include:

===Haskell Ridge===
A rocky ridge west of Colosseum Ridge. 
Mapped by the VUWAE (1962-63) and named after T.R. Haskell, a member of the expedition.

===Misthound Cirque===
A cirque forming a large embayment in the east side of Haskell Ridge. 
It is the type locality for the Misthound Coal measures, a formation of the Beacon Sequence. 
So named by VUWAE, 1962-63, because of the eerie bleakness and often mist-filled floor of the cirque, which contains many peculiarly shaped boulders resembling large dogs.

===Muchmore Valley===

A valley long between Haskell Ridge and Colosseum Ridge. 
The valley is filled by ice except at the head, where flow from the Midnight Plateau icecap is insufficient to enter the valley. 
Named after Doctor Harold G. Muchmore of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK, field leader for a long term project on biomedical aspects of human adaptation at the South Pole, 1970-83.

===Colosseum Ridge===
A ridge between Haskell Ridge and Richardson Hill. 
The ridge contains pyramidal peaks and five large cirques, the appearance of the latter bearing a resemblance to the Colosseum in Rome. 
Mapped and named by the VUWAE (1962-63).

===Richardson Hill===
An ice-free hill which rises above the ice of Island Arena on the north side of the Darwin Mountains. 
Mapped and named by the VUWAE (1962-63), for Professor L.R. Richardson of the Victoria University of Wellington, N.Z., an active supporter of the University&#x27;s Antarctic expeditions.

===Smith Heights===
The highest part of the jumble of peaks between Kennett Ridge and Junction Spur in the eastern part of the Darvin Mountains.
Mapped by the VUWAE, 1962-63, and named for G.J. Smith, a member of the expedition.

===Junction Spur===
A rocky spur marking the eastern extremity of the Darwin Mountains and the junction of the Hatherton and Darwin Glaciers.
Mapped and named by the Darwin Glacier Party of the CTAE (1956-58).

<doc id="1158270" wikidata="Q7044887" url="?curid=1158270" title="No Religious Test Clause">
<text>The No Religious Test Clause of the United States Constitution is a clause within Article VI, Clause 3: &quot;Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.&quot; It immediately follows a clause requiring all federal and state office holders to take an oath or affirmation to support the Constitution. This clause contains the only explicit reference to religion in the original seven articles of the U.S. Constitution.

The ban on religious tests contained in this clause protects federal officeholders and employees as well as the officeholders of &quot;State Legislatures, and [...] the several states&quot;. This clause is cited by advocates of separation of church and state as an example of the &quot;original intent&quot; of the Framers of the Constitution to avoid any entanglement between church and state, or involving the government in any way as a determiner of religious beliefs or practices. This is significant because this clause represents the words of the original Framers, even prior to the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

==Text==

==Background==
A variety of Test Acts were instituted in England in the 17th and 18th centuries. Their main purpose was to exclude anyone not a member of the Church of England—the official state religion—from holding government office, notably Catholics and &quot;nonconforming&quot; Protestants. Government officials were required to swear oaths, such as the Oath of Supremacy, that the monarch of England was the head of the Church and that they possessed no other foreign loyalties, such as to the pope. Later acts required officials to disavow transubstantiation and the veneration of saints. Such laws were common throughout Europe, where numerous countries had a state religion.

Many colonists of the Thirteen Colonies had left England in part in search of a place where they could practice their own religion. In many cases the colonial governments established an official religion, requiring residents to adhere to the beliefs of the founding sect. With the royal government&#x27;s religious favoritism fresh in their memory, the Founders sought to prevent the return of the Test Acts by adding this clause to the Constitution. Specifically, Charles Pinckney, delegate from South Carolina—where a Protestant denomination was the established state religion—introduced the clause to Article VI, and it passed with little opposition.

==Forced oaths==
The Supreme Court has interpreted this provision broadly, saying that &quot;any&quot; required oath to serve anything other than the Constitution is invalid. In the case of &quot;Ex parte Garland&quot;, the Court overturned a loyalty oath that the government had tried to apply to pardoned Confederate officials. As the officials had already received full presidential pardons (negating an argument based on their potential status as criminals), the Court ruled that forcing officials and judges to swear loyalty oaths was unconstitutional.

==State law==

Earlier in U.S. history, the doctrine of states&#x27; rights allowed individual states complete discretion regarding the inclusion of a religious test in their state constitutions. In 1961 such religious tests by the states were deemed to be unconstitutional by the extension of the First Amendment provisions to the states (via the incorporation of the 14th Amendment). In the 1961 case &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that such language in state constitutions was in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Citing the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretation of the Establishment Clause in &quot;Everson v. Board of Education&quot; and linking it to &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins,&quot; Justice Hugo Black stated for the Court:

We repeat and again reaffirm that neither a State nor the Federal Government can constitutionally force a person &quot;to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.&quot; Neither can constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.

The Supreme Court did not rule on the applicability of Article VI, stating that &quot;Because we are reversing the judgment on other grounds, we find it unnecessary to consider appellant&#x27;s contention that this provision applies to state as well as federal offices.&quot; 

Eight states include language in their constitutions either requiring state officeholders to have particular religious beliefs or specifically protecting those who do. However, the requirements are unenforceable because of the 1961 Supreme Court decision. The states are:
#Arkansas (Article 19 Section 1)
#Maryland (Declaration of Rights, Article 37)
#Mississippi (Article 14, Section 265)
#North Carolina (Article 6 Section 8)
#Pennsylvania (Article 1 Section 4)&lt;br&gt;Specifically protects officeholders with religious belief but is silent on whether those without such beliefs are also protected. The required beliefs include belief in a Supreme Being, and belief in a future state of rewards and punishments.
#South Carolina (Article 17 Section 4)
#Tennessee (Article 9 Section 2)
#Texas (Article 1 Section 4)

Some of these same states also specify that the oath of office include the words &quot;so help me God&quot;. In some cases, these beliefs (or oaths) were historically required also of jurors, witnesses in court, notaries public, and state employees. In the 1997 case of &quot;Silverman v. Campbell&quot;, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution requiring an oath to God for employment in the public sector violated Article VI of the federal constitution, as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments and therefore could not be enforced.

<text>A crucifer or cross-bearer is, in some Christian churches (particularly the Roman Catholic Church, Lutheran Churches, Anglican Communion, and Methodist Churches), a person appointed to carry the church&#x27;s processional cross, a cross or crucifix with a long staff, during processions at the beginning and end of the service. In these Christian denominations, the crucifer is a role assigned to a certain acolyte or altar server.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;crucifer&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;crux&quot; (cross) and &quot;ferre&quot; (to bear, carry). It thus literally means &quot;cross-bearer&quot;. Use of the term &quot;crucifer&quot; is most common in the Lutheran and Anglican churches, as well as in certain Catholic congregations. In the Catholic Church, the usual term is &quot;cross-bearer&quot;, which is employed in certain Lutheran congregations as well.

==Role by Christian denomination==
===Roman Catholic Church===
In the Latin Catholic Church the function of the crucifer/cross-bearer was generally carried out by a subdeacon until Pope Paul VI decreed in his &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Ministeria quaedam&quot; of 15 August 1972 that &quot;the major order of subdiaconate no longer exists in the Latin Church&quot;. In line with that document, the functions previously assigned to the subdeacon are now entrusted to the acolyte and the reader.

A seventeenth-century Council of Milan stated that a crucifer should, when possible, be a cleric and that, if a lay person be selected, that &quot;the most worthy of the laity should be selected for the office.&quot; For more solemn processions, the cleric should be vested in amice, alb, and tunic. On less solemn occasions he may just be vested in surplice. During the procession the staff is held with both hands such that the cross is well above the head. The cross-bearer leads the procession except when there is a thurifer and is accompanied by two servers on the more solemn occasions.
===Lutheran Churches===
In the Lutheran Churches, the crucifer is an acolyte who carries the processional cross. Torchbearers stand to the side of the crucifer. During the procession and the recession, the crucifer &quot;holds the cross in an elevated and dignified manner&quot;.

===Anglican Communion===
In the Anglican Communion, the crucifer is an acolyte who carries the processional cross.

<text>Tore Ingvar Uppström (8 December 1937 in Stockholm – 8 June 2006) was a Swedish pianist, composer and author.

Uppström studied at Royal College of Music, Stockholm, from 1959 to 1963 and at the Vienna Academy of Music from 1963 to 1964. He toured in Sweden and abroad, performed about 300 concerts and participated in radio broadcasts around a hundred times. He worked as a music teacher, was chairman of &quot;Svenska tonkonstnärsförbundet&quot; (&quot;Swedish association of musical artists&quot;), a union for Swedish freelance musicians, and consultant for &quot;Föreningen Musikcentrum&quot; (which presents itself in English as &quot;The Music Centre – independent organisation for the promotion of music&quot;), another organisation for freelance musicians.

In 1973, he published the book &quot;Pianister i Sverige&quot; (&quot;Pianists in Sweden&quot;, with a summary in English), an overview based on a series of lectures in Swedish radio on the history of piano music in Sweden from the end of the 18th to the middle of the 20th century. Another book, &quot;Spelrummet Sverige. En ordbok on 1900-talets artister, trender och motbilder. Om Svenska tonkonstnärsförbundet i tiden&quot; (&quot;Playground Sweden. A Dictionary of 20th century artists, trends and anti-images. About Svenska tonkonstnärsförbundet in its time&quot;) was published in 1997. Uppström also published a number of articles for musical periodicals.

His contributions as a composer are limited to a handful of piano pieces and some smaller works for different instrumental ensembles. He also made a critical edition of Dag Wirén&#x27;s 2nd symphony (2000), published by The Swedish Art Music Society.

<text>Urziceni () is a city in Ialomița County, Muntenia, Romania, located around north-east of Bucharest.

==Geography==
The city is situated at the western edge of the Bărăgan Plain, on the banks of the Ialomița River and its tributary, the river Cotorca. It is located in the northwestern part of Ialomița County, from the county seat, Slobozia.

Urziceni is an important transportation hub in Romania. It is crossed by national road DN2 (part of European route E85), which runs from Bucharest towards Buzău and on towards Suceava and the border with Ukraine at Siret. Road connects Urziceni to Ploiești, 63 km to the northwest, while road runs eastward towards Slobozia and continues all the way to Constanța, on the Black Sea coast.

The Urziceni train station serves the CFR Main Line 700, which connects Bucharest to Brăila, Galați and the border with Moldova at Giurgiulești, as well as Line 701, which connects it to Ploiești.

==History==
Founded by Romanian shepherds, the name of the city is derived from the word &quot;urzică&quot; (nettle). It was mentioned for the first time in a written document on 23 April 1596, during the reign of Michael the Brave. It gained in 1831 the status of market town and in 1895 the city status. For 117 years (between 1716 and 1833), it was the capital of Ialomița County.

==Demographics==
As the census of 2011 results showed, Urziceni was ranked in 3rd place in Ialomița County, after Slobozia and Fetești. It had a population of 14,053, of which 93.1% were ethnic Romanians, 4.6% Roma, and 1.6% Hungarians. Moreover, there were 6,765 males and 7,288 females. At the 2021 census, the city had 13,380 inhabitants; of those, 82.35% were Romanians and 4.4% Roma.

<doc id="1158308" wikidata="Q2658067" url="?curid=1158308" title="MATADOR">
<text>The MATADOR (man-portable, anti-tank, anti-door) is a man-portable, disposable anti-armour and anti-brickwall weapon system developed by Germany, Israel and Singapore. It is an updated version of the German Armbrust design, and operates on the same principles. The development of this weapon began in 2000 and the MATADOR will eventually replace the German Armbrust Light Anti-tank Weapon, which has been in service since the 1980s.

The MATADOR was developed jointly by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), in collaboration with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Dynamit Nobel Defence (DND) joint team.

==Capabilities==
The MATADOR is among the lightest in its class. The warhead is effective against both vehicle armour and brick walls. The weapon has little back-blast, making it safe for operation in confined spaces.

The MATADOR is supposed to be capable of defeating the armour of most known armoured personnel carriers and light tanks in the world. The dual-capability warhead, when acting in the delay mode, creates an opening greater than in diameter in a double brick wall, and acts as an anti-personnel weapon against those behind the wall, offering an unconventional means of entry when fighting in built-up areas.

The MATADOR&#x27;s projectile is claimed to be insensitive to wind due to its propulsion system, which results in a highly accurate weapon system.

==Warhead==
The warhead can be used in both high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) and high explosive squash head (HESH) modes against armour, walls, or other fortifications respectively. Modes are selected by adjusting a &quot;probe&quot; (most likely a fuse extender): extending it for HEAT mode and leaving it retracted for HESH mode.

==Counter-mass system==
Similar to the Armbrust, the counter-mass counteracts the recoil of the weapon upon firing. The counter-mass consists of shredded plastic, which is launched out of the rear of the weapon when it is fired. This plastic is rapidly slowed by air resistance, allowing the weapon to be fired safely within an enclosed space. In addition, the positioning of the counter-mass takes into consideration the centre of gravity of the weapon to ensure good balance for better accuracy.

==Variants==
Variants of the original HEAT/HESH (HH) weapon have been developed by Rafael and Dynamit Nobel Defence, designed primarily for anti-structure use by soldiers operating in dense urban environments.

;MATADOR-MP
:Multi-purpose weapon with a warhead effective against a wide variety of ground targets, from light armoured vehicles to fortified positions and urban walls. As with the initial MATADOR, this is achieved with a dual-mode fuse, which has been improved on the MATADOR-MP such that it now automatically discriminates between hard and soft targets rather than requiring the operator to manually make the selection. A dedicated targeting device, mounted on its Picatinny rail, incorporates a reflex sight and laser rangefinder to provide a high hit probability.

;MATADOR-WB
:Specialised wall-breaching weapon, featuring an explosively-formed ring (EFR) warhead that breaches a man-sized hole, between to across, in typical urban walls.

;MATADOR-AS
:Anti-structure weapon with an advanced tandem warhead that can also be set between two modes. The anti-emplacement mode uses an enhanced blast effect to defeat structures and fortifications, while the penetrating/mouse-holing mode defeats light armoured vehicles and creates mouseholes in urban walls. MATADOR-AS has been ordered by the British Army, and was slated for service entry in 2009.

;RGW
:RGW 90 is a German designation for the MATADOR, with &quot;RGW&quot; standing for &quot;recoilless grenade weapon&quot;. The RGW 60 is a variant that is smaller and fires a 60 mm warhead, instead of the usual 90 mm.

==Combat history==

* The MATADOR saw its first combat deployment in January 2009, by Israel Defence Forces soldiers during Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip. MATADOR-AS was used to breach walls in structures, allowing IDF troops to pass through and attack opponents inside.
* In 2022, Ukrainian forces used MATADORs supplied by Germany against Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.
* According to reports from Ukraine, the RGW-90 is capable of penetrating lightly armoured APCs and IFVs, but not guaranteed to easily defeat tank reactive armour. &quot;“This summer, the soldiers of the 93rd Brigade fired RGW90 into the forehead of a Russian tank with reactive armor. The tank was not destroyed, but it was stopped, and soldiers who were on the top of the tank got minced,”&quot; the military stated.
* The MATADOR is seeing extensive usage in the Israel–Hamas war with numerous filmed clips of it being fired according to its Israeli main designation as a means to burst concrete obstacles. During the initial Hamas offensive several MATADORs were captured by militants in Israeli bases and taken back to Gaza.

<text>The Modus Tenendi Parliamentum (Method of Holding Parliaments) is a 14th-century document that outlined an idealised version of English parliamentary procedure. Part of its significance lies in its very title: parliament was now &quot;seen as both institutionally well defined and a proper subject for description and conscious reflection&quot;. However, it also includes elements of fantasy, both in relation to the way it sets out the history of parliaments, and its aspirations for the roles of different groups in parliament.

==Provenance==
An ancient document which has exercised much debate over its antiquity and authorship, the &quot;Modus&quot; is no longer seen as a later forgery, despite the doubts of earlier antiquaries, such as John Selden (1584–1654) and William Prynne (1600–1669). Thomas Duffus Hardy (1804–78) was a prominent historian and archivist, whose final position was senior assistant keeper of the Public Record Office. He edited the most complete version of the volume in 1846, and believed it was probably written &quot;some time between the years 1294 and 1327&quot;, at or shortly after Edward I&#x27;s Model Parliament of 1295. Writing in 1934, William A Morris reviewed the conflicting views on the date of the &quot;Modus&quot; that were first offered in the seventeenth century and concluded that it must have been written during the reign of Edward II (1307-27), probably 1321. M. V. Clarke says the book &quot;was written in 1322 in order to expound and define the parliamentary theory and practice upheld by moderate men of that time&quot;. That view on the date is also supported by W. C. Weber. References within the &quot;Modus&quot; suggest that the writer had experience of parliament, as well as an understanding of the royal administration. V. H. Galbraith believed that someone who had such experience was the Yorkshireman, William Ayermin (also Airmyn, or Ayreminne) (died 1336). Ayermin held a number of offices in the church and royal administration, including being Keeper of the Rolls of Chancery from 1316–24 and almost certainly also clerk of the parliament.

==Significance==
The significance of the &quot;Modus&quot; lies in its descriptions of the procedures and organisation of Parliament and the growing importance of the Commons. Parliament had developed by the early 14th century to the point where it could promote the transmission of the crown&#x27;s policies and intentions in a positive manner outwards from the centre, and representation was the best method of doing this; notably, the Commons were more representative than magnates or prelates, who only represented themselves. Increasingly, the agreement of the Commons was necessary for the levy of all taxes: peers could give such consent personally, whereas the Commons were proxies for the bulk of the population. During the reign of Richard II, prominent members of the House of Lancaster wished to play up the importance of the Commons, compared to that of the Lords, prelates and magnates, and to legitimate processes in the Commons to depose a king who had lost the support of the people. The &quot;Modus&quot; was helpful to them in its emphasis on the representative power of the Commons: &quot;We must understand that two Knights which come to the Parliament for the Shires and County out of which they come have a greater voice in Parliament to grant, than the greatest Earl in England&quot;. Maddicott offers a concise summary of the document&#x27;s significance: &quot;About the precise functions and powers of the commons the author of the &quot;Modus&quot; was, so far as we can see, often wrong. But about their general weight and position he was not so far out ... It is not hard to envisage the sort of body which it had in mind playing its part in the deposition of a king&quot;.

In a major political crisis in Ireland in 1418–19, the veteran statesman Christopher Preston, 2nd Baron Gormanston, was accused of treason, largely on account of his ownership of a copy of the document. He was quickly released and restored to favour, apparently after explaining that he had simply found it among his father&#x27;s papers and thought it worth keeping. This copy was itself copied onto the patent roll of the Irish Chancery.

<text>Miriam Winter (maiden surname Winter, married surname &quot;Orlowska&quot;; 2 June 1933 – 19 July 2014) was a Polish Holocaust survivor and writer. She is known for her authorship of &quot;Trains: A Memoir of a Hidden Childhood during and after World War II&quot;, which explores not only her survival of the Holocaust as a &#x27;hidden child&#x27; but also the psychological toll of keeping her identity hidden, even to herself, in post-World War II Poland.

She studied theater at the Leon Schiller Advanced State School for Theatre in Łódź before its division into separate theater and film schools. She has directed productions of &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Ondine&quot;, and &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

Her parents, maternal grandparents Szymon and Shajna Kohn, younger brother Józio (Josef), and other members of her extended family were murdered at the Treblinka extermination camp.

==Life during World War II==
Miriam Winter was born in Łódź, Poland to Tobiasz (Tuvyeh) Winter and Majta Laja (Leah) Winter (maiden surname Kohn). World War II began when Miriam was six. Her family was expelled from Łódź by the Nazis and confined first in the Warsaw Ghetto and then in the Ożarów Ghetto, but Miriam&#x27;s parents were able to sneak her out. She was first taken into custody by a family friend, Czesia. That was until on the train from Ożarów, Czesia found Maryla Dudek, a Catholic Pole, who assumed custody of Miriam but wasn&#x27;t aware that Miriam was Jewish at the time.

In Lwów (Lemberg), Winter lived in hiding with Maryla until she was detected as Jewish by the other children. This caused them to have to move to Czudek and then to Wola Rzedzińska, which is where Winter lived with a Catholic family. There she was raised Catholic and wanted to be baptized and receive communion, but her priest had apparently suspected her true background and wouldn&#x27;t baptize her. Instead, her priest devised a scam procedure to make it seem like she met the requirements to not expose her. Despite this, she was still exposed by some of the village people and had to flee to Hucisko, a village where Maryla&#x27;s sister, Zosia Rumak, lived. After that, she was placed with a couple in the nearby village of Styków but when it was revealed in church that she hadn&#x27;t been baptized, she expected repercussions and fled back to Hucisko and lived with Zosia. Later she was moved from Hucisko to Raniżów, and it was there that the area was liberated by the Red Army in the summer of 1944.

== Life after World War II ==
After liberation, Miriam lived in Lwów with Maryla, at which point her last name was changed to Dudek, and her birth date from June 1933 to September 1937. This made it easier for Miriam to pass as Maryla&#x27;s daughter.

When the war was completely over, Miriam lived with Maryla and her husband Rysiu, working in Rysiu&#x27;s bakery and selling his products. She was also able to attend school once again. However, she fled at the age of 15 after months of being mistreated physically and emotionally, and began living in an orphanage in Szczecin. Miriam enrolled in school once again, graduating high school in 1951.

In 1963, she married Romek Orłowski and gave birth to their first child, Daniel, in 1964. Miriam and her husband applied for emigration and, in 1969, were able to move to the United States, where they had their second Child, David.

She died of cancer.

==Legacy==
Winter could be found at various signings. One was at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., on 8 June 2012.

<text>ISFiC, or &quot;Illinois Science Fiction in Chicago&quot;, is a non-profit organization best known for running the Windycon science fiction convention.

ISFiC was formed in 1973 as a coalition of the various science fiction clubs in Chicago, Illinois, United States. In addition to being the parent organization for an annual convention, it would also serve as a clearing house for fan activities in Illinois. The founders of the organization included Larry Propp, Mark and Lynne Aronson, Ann Cass, Jon and Joni Stopa and Mike and Carol Resnick.

Each summer, ISFiC holds a small picnic, named Picnicon after the generally accepted science fiction naming conventions.

==ISFiC Press==

In 2004, ISFiC started up a small press, ISFiC Press. Their first book was Robert J. Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;Relativity&quot;. It was released on November 12, 2004, and included an introduction by Mike Resnick, an afterword by Valerie Broege and a cover by Jael. They have published additional books annually, with works winning the Aurora Award and being nominated for the Hugo Award.

==ISFiC Writers Contest==

<text>84–86 is a double compilation album released by the industrial music band KMFDM in 2004. The album&#x27;s 27 tracks on two compact discs were recorded from 1984 to 1986 but previously unreleased on CD. Certain noted selections have never been released at all prior to this album. Personnel featured on this recording include Sascha Konietzko, En Esch, Jr. Blackmail, Nico Blank, &quot;Tamsi&quot; Tamsjadi, and several others.

==Release==

A cassette release of these tracks was assembled by En Esch and made available through the KMFDM Enterprises mailorder catalog in 1992. It included the first 19 tracks appearing on the CD release, but several tracks were dubbed at an incorrect tape speed (later fixed on the CD as &quot;official&quot; versions). These tracks were available for download at the KMFDM Store prior to the actual release of &quot;84–86&quot;, limited to 1000 numbered copies. The CD was 
also sold on the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary tour in October and November 2004, limited to an additional 1000 copies un-numbered.

<text>ISFiC Press is the small press publishing arm of ISFiC. It often produces books by the Author Guest of Honor at Windycon, an annual Chicago science fiction convention, launching the appropriate title at the convention.

Although the press officially released its first book, Robert J. Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;Relativity&quot;, on November 12, 2004, the people responsible for the press issued a filk CD two years earlier, entitled &quot;A Walk on the Windy Side&quot;. That CD is considered to be the press&#x27;s first project.

&quot;A Walk on the Windy Side&quot; includes songs by Charles de Lint and Juanita Coulson as well as readings by Frederik Pohl and Kristine Smith.

In addition to stories and essays by Sawyer, &quot;Relativity&quot; includes an introduction by Mike Resnick, an afterword by Valerie Broege and a cover by Jael. &quot;Relativity&quot; won the Prix Aurora Award for best English Work (Other) for 2004.

ISFiC Press released its first two novels, &quot;Every Inch a King&quot;, by Harry Turtledove with a cover by Bob Eggleton, and &quot;The Cunning Blood&quot;, by Jeff Duntemann with a cover by Todd Cameron Hamilton on November 11, 2005.

In 2006, ISFiC Press published its first non-fiction book, &quot;Worldcon Guest of Honor Speeches&quot;, edited by Mike Resnick and Joe Siclari, which was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Related Book. In November of that year they published &quot;Outbound&quot;, a collection of short stories by Jack McDevitt.

In August 2012 ISFiC Press issued its first electronic book, &quot;Win Some, Lose Some: The Hugo Award Winning (and Nominated) Short Science Fiction and Fantasy of Mike Resnick&quot; (by Mike Resnick; Cover by Vincent Di Fate) as well as the hardcover edition of the same title. The e-book is offered in EPUB and MOBI format. The publication of this book is coincident with Chicon 7, the 70th World Science Fiction Convention, which was held in ISFiC Press&#x27;s hometown of Chicago.
The publisher and editor of ISFiC Press from its inception until 2012 was Steven H Silver and the business manager is Bill Roper.

<doc id="1158351" wikidata="Q1397257" url="?curid=1158351" title="FasTracks">
<text>FasTracks is a multibillion-dollar public transportation expansion plan under construction in metropolitan Denver, Colorado, United States. Developed by the Regional Transportation District (RTD), the plan consists of new commuter rail, light rail, and express bus services. Six new light rail, electric commuter rail and diesel commuter rail lines with a combined length of will be constructed under the plan. It expands on previous transportation projects, notably T-REX, and includes 57 new transit stations and stops, 21,000 new parking spaces, of a bus service between Denver and Boulder and the renovation of Denver Union Station as a multi-modal transportation hub.

Originally envisioned to cost $4.7 billion and to be completed in 2017, voters in the eight counties that comprise the RTD approved a 0.4 percent sales tax increase in 2004. By 2010, the budget grew to $6.5 billion while projected revenues dropped to $4.1 billion.

The project is not expected to be finished until after 2050. Alternative funding sources, such as public-private partnerships, have been sought.

The first of the six new lines envisioned in the plan, the West Corridor light rail line to Golden, Colorado, opened for revenue service on April 26, 2013. By mid-2014, construction was underway on the five other rail lines. Two commuter rail lines opened on their long-anticipated dates in 2016: the East Rail Line to Denver International Airport and the portion of the Northwest Rail Line to south Westminster. The I-225 Rail Line through Aurora opened on February 24, 2017, and the Gold Line to Wheat Ridge opened on April 26, 2019. In addition, the North Metro Rail Line to Thornton opened in 2020.

Denver Union Station underwent $200 million worth of facility improvements to turn it into the hub for new commuter and light rail lines as well as bus service in downtown Denver. The underground 22-bay bus concourse at Union Station opened on May 11, 2014, while the restaurants, bars, and hotel officially opened July 26, 2014.

==Progress==
FasTracks is being funded with federal appropriations, private contributions, and a region-wide sales tax increase. The project was allowed to begin when the sales tax portion of its funding was approved by Denver metro area voters in November 2004. The tax went into effect in January 2005.

In 2006, engineering design of the initial segment, the West Rail Line, was begun.

By spring of 2006, the environmental impact statements of all other proposed lines were underway. The municipal governments of Denver, Boulder, and Lakewood had launched detailed studies of community redevelopment possibilities around station locations. The cities of Westminster, Thornton, Aurora, Greenwood Village, Englewood, Sheridan, and Arvada are also planning transit oriented development areas around some of their proposed rail stations.

Central to the regional nature of the service package is Union Station. Special studies of its redevelopment and adaptation for multiple transport modes were conducted and engineering design work and property development work was underway in 2006.

In May 2007, a $1.5 billion budget overrun was reported. Despite service and construction reductions, by January 2010 the budget had grown to $6.5 billion (a $1.8 billion overrun). At the same time, sales tax revenue forecasts for 2017 were projected to come in much less than originally anticipated leaving the project $2.45 billion short.

On April 13, 2010, the RTD board of directors decided to postpone asking voters to further increase the current sales tax. If the tax increase fails to be implemented, the full build-out of the FasTracks plan may not take place until 2042.

On August 31, 2011, US Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced that the US Department of Transportation had approved a $1 billion grant to the Eagle P3 project, which consists of the East and Gold commuter rail lines, covering half of the $2 billion cost of the construction of the two lines.

In March 2012, RTD received an unsolicited proposal to build the I-225 Corridor line from Kiewit Infrastructure Co. After determining the proposal had merit and seeking other bids, RTD selected Kiewit to build the line. In 2013, RTD received a second unsolicited proposal this time to build the North Metro Line. RTD sought bids to build the line out in multiple phases. After receiving four bids, RTD selected the partnership of Graham Contracting Ltd., Balfour Beatty Rail Inc. and Harmon Contractors Inc. (GBBH), the same group that had submitted the unsolicited proposal.

On April 26, 2013, the first completed segment of the FasTracks regional transit-expansion plan was opened to the public, the W Line.

In November 2014, the first commuter rail cars arrived in Denver from the Hyundai–Rotem USA plant in Philadelphia, PA.

==Project details==
===Eagle public-private partnership===

The Eagle public–private partnership (P3) combines two commuter rail lines, the East Line to DIA and the Gold Line to Wheat Ridge, plus a section of the Northwest Line up to Westminster, and a maintenance facility into a single contract. Denver Transit Partners, the consortium of companies RTD selected to lead the Eagle P3 project, is responsible for the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of the rail lines in the contract.

Construction broke ground on the Gold Line on August 26, 2010. In August 2011, Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood committed $1 billion in federal money to the Eagle P3 project. In December LaHood approved a $280 million loan to advance construction. As of June 2013, the project is on track to open the rail lines under contract in 2016.

====East Rail Line (commuter rail)====

Being constructed as part of the Eagle P3, the East Rail Line is a commuter rail line between downtown Denver, Aurora, and Denver International Airport using electric multiple unit (EMU) commuter trains. To expedite travel time between downtown Denver and Denver International Airport, only six stations will be located on the line. Construction started in August 2010, and the line opened to the public on April 22, 2016.
====Gold Line (commuter rail)====

The second full line funded under the Eagle P3, the Gold Line is an commuter rail corridor that will run from Denver Union Station to Wheat Ridge, passing through Adams County and Arvada. As with the East Corridor, the RTD Board of Directors chose EMU commuter trains to run on the Gold Line. Seven new stations—with an already existing station at Union— were built for the line. It opened on April 26, 2019.

===I-225 Corridor (light rail)===

The I-225 Corridor is light rail line running through Aurora and facilitate a circumferential link between the Southeast Corridor and the East Line. The project will include seven new stations and provide 1,800 new parking spaces. Construction began in the spring of 2012 on a short section of the line as part of a joint contract with CDOT. Following an unsolicited proposal from Kiewit Infrastructure Co. funding was secured for the full line which opened on February 24, 2017.

===North Metro Corridor (commuter rail)===

The North Metro Corridor is a commuter rail line that runs along an existing railroad right-of-way from Denver to 160th Avenue in Thornton. The line has eight stations on its route. In 2009, RTD paid $117 million to purchase the right-of-way from Union Pacific in preparation for the buildout of the North Metro line. However, with the global recession of 2009, the North Metro Corridor became a victim of financial setbacks and it was feared that the line would not be built until 2044. RTD was able to avoid delaying the construction of the line when it accepted an unsolicited offer in 2013 to build out the full line in two stages. The first phase was completed in 2020.

===Northwest Rail Corridor (commuter rail)===

The Northwest Rail Corridor is a commuter rail project between Denver, Boulder, and Longmont. The completion of the proposed line, would consist of seven stations. The route would follow an existing railroad right-of-way from BNSF. The only segment of the line that has been completed to date has been up to Westminster Station. The station sits just south west of Federal and 72nd in Westminster. The line runs from Denver&#x27;s Union Station to south Westminster, with plans for future segments in the distant future. The project was and still is a construction project part of the Eagle P3 project. Future segments are in an unknown phase at the moment and no construction has started on any other segments on the line. The remaining segments are currently predicted for completion by the year 2044. The announcement angered many voters in the cities and suburbs north of Denver who had approved a sales tax increase in 2004 to fund the FasTracks project.

The downturn in the economy and significant cost increases and delays associated with building and operating the Northwest Corridor led to the initiation of the year-long &quot;Northwest Area Mobility Study&quot;. This was an effort between northwest area governments and transportation partners that set out to recommend alternatives to the voter approved commuter rail line that could have possibly brought near-term mobility improvements to the northwest area. The study concluded in 2014 and made a number of recommendations that were adopted by the RTD Board of Directors in June 2014. One of the recommendations adopted was an interim express bus service called &quot;Flatiron Flyer&quot;. In summer 2018, the U.S. 36 Mayors and Commissioners Coalition was gathering support from other members to ask RTD to provide an estimate for at least weekday rush hour commuter rail service along the original corridor to Longmont. The &quot;Peak Service Plan&quot; would carry 1,400 passengers per weekday.

===West Corridor (light rail)===

Preliminary work on the West Corridor light rail line began on May 16, 2007. During early stages of development, it was decided that the line from the Federal Center to the Jefferson County Government Center would be reduced to a single track to help cut costs. According to RTD, this change would reduce train headways from 15 minutes to 5 and make it easier for the line to run along the side of U.S. 6. Upon the completion of construction the line was designated the &quot;W Line&quot;. The 12.1 mile light rail line was opened to the public on April 26, 2013, and is the first completed segment of the FasTracks regional transit-expansion plan.

===US 36 Corridor===

This is an long express bus line, branded &quot;Flatiron Flyer&quot;, running along US 36 between Denver and Boulder, Colorado with six stops planned along the route. A joint project between CDOT and RTD, the road was widened by 40 feet in each direction to allow the addition of a high-occupancy vehicle lane instead of the trains voters approved. The project was completed in two phases, with the first phase completed in May 2010. The second phase began construction in July 2012 and opened to the public in 2016. Sections of the road subsequently collapsed in summer 2019.

===Extensions (light rail)===
There are plans for extensions to a few existing light rail lines; they include a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) extension to the Southwest Corridor, extending the line to the southwest corner of Lucent Boulevard and C-470. A 2.3-mile (3.7 km) extension to the Southeast Corridor into Lone Tree which opened to the public in May 2019; and a 0.8-mile (1.3 km) extension to the Central Corridor to connect the 30th &amp; Downing station with the East Corridor commuter rail line at the intersection of 38th and Blake.

==Economic growth/development==

According to RTD (2012), when new development occurs near stations, it increases the likelihood that residents and workers will choose transit as their transportation mode. This reduces the growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and auto trips on a constrained roadway system while, at the same time, accommodating new growth.

RTD has conducted a Quality of Life (QoL) study for the neighborhoods&#x27; impacted by FasTracks with baseline data collection starting in 2006 and continuing bi-annually to the present. The QoL study tracks a number of economic and community development indicators.

==Rolling stock==

As of 2015, FasTracks has on order 66 Hyundai Rotem Silverliner V electric multiple unit rail cars operated in a married pair configuration. These cars were initially developed by Rotem for Philadelphia&#x27;s SEPTA Regional Rail in 2009, with RTD&#x27;s order coming a year later in 2010. RTD&#x27;s numbered 4001 through 4066, possess a number of differences from the ones operated by SEPTA, most notably the lack of low platform steps and full-width cabs.

All trains operating on the commuter rail lines will be equipped with positive train control.

==Criticism==

=== Denver Union Station Design === 
The Regional Transportation District (RTD) and Denver Union Station Project Authority (DUSPA) has received significant criticism for the redevelopment of the Denver Union Station. Many public transportation advocates and planning experts maintain that the project precludes impending access of high-speed rail technology and north–south passenger rail routes such as Front Range Rail, is designed to present logistical complications for both rail and bus commuters, lacks integration of bicycle facilities and an intercity bus station, and is being modeled to perform as a stub-end terminal for current and future intercity rail routes. Many citizens and public transportation advocates have also expressed frustration with the high cost associated with the project&#x27;s design and its direct impact on the agency&#x27;s ability to complete all rail lines that were a part of the original voter-approved FasTracks project proposal. In 2009, the Colorado Rail Passenger Association, a local rail transportation advocacy group, filed a lawsuit against the Federal Transportation Administration for its acceptance of DUSPA&#x27;s Environmental Impact Statement, which suspiciously omitted several impactful statements and comments that were contributed by the members of the community.

===Eminent domain===
The Regional Transportation District have used eminent domain to condemn properties in the path of transportation projects. Several property owners have protested the taking of their properties for FasTracks lines.

=== Federal Station relocation ===
The Regional Transportation District proposed relocating the Gold Line Federal Station from the previously approved east side site to the west side of Federal Boulevard. Some residents opposed the move on the grounds that was only to benefit a developer who owned property near the west side site, and revitalization of the community would be better served by the east side location. RTD supported the move because the east side location was a former waste dump, and that the west side location would be more accessible for the community.

On December 15, 2010, RTD announced that the Federal Station would remain on the east side of Federal and not be moved to the west side. The Adams County Commissioners, who had originally requested the change, withdrew their support under pressure from residents of a subdivision near the west site, who opposed the private developer&#x27;s plan to build higher-density housing and commercial buildings around the new station site.

=== Indefinite Northwest Rail Line delay ===
Originally, the voter-approved plan called for a high-capacity commuter rail line running from Denver Union Station to Longmont, passing through North Denver, Adams County, Westminster, Broomfield, Louisville and Boulder. Back in early 2008, the diesel-powered heavy rail service was expected to start running in late 2014 or early 2015 - roughly ten years after the FasTracks vote - initially with 58 trains a day, ramping up over a decade to 84 trains by 2025. The completion of this original plan has been delayed until 2044 due to lower tax revenues and higher costs than expected.

In January 2016, RTD introduced a new express bus system in the US 36 Corridor, parallel to the Northwest Rail corridor. Branded &quot;Flatiron Flyer&quot;, it travels in high-occupancy toll lanes along US 36 between Denver and Boulder. The consolidation of current express service between Denver and Boulder into this one system attracted criticism from Boulder residents, since increased frequencies were balanced with some service cuts - particularly to service patterns making the least number of stops between Boulder and Denver. Additionally, the ITDP classified the system as &quot;not bus rapid transit&quot;, due to the use of lanes shared with private cars along US 36, the lack of street level boarding/alighting and the lack of an off-board fare system. A plan to allow Flatiron Flyer US 36 buses on shoulders during high-traffic periods required the 2016 state legislature to pass such authorization (passed on January 13, signed by the governor on March 9), effective May 1.

<doc id="1158358" wikidata="Q119322" url="?curid=1158358" title="Botswana national football team">
<text>The Botswana national football team () was founded in 1970 to represent Botswana in association football and is governed by the Botswana Football Association (BFA). The team has qualified for two Africa Cup of Nations tournaments, the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.

==History==
It took part in its first preliminary competition for the 1994 World Cup in the United States, where it faced Niger and Ivory Coast. It managed a 0–0 draw with the latter in Gaborone, and lost its other 3 matches, finishing last in its group.

The next competition it entered was for the 2002 World Cup, where it faced Zambia in a 2-legged tie to decide which team would advance to the group stages. Zambia won both legs of the tie to qualify and knock Botswana out. 

After this, Botswana lost 3–0 to Zambia and to second-string sides from South Africa and Zimbabwe at home in Gaborone. A draw with Madagascar which was ranked at 146th in the world at the time, led Botswana FA to sack manager Colwyn Rowe, who had guided Botswana to its then-highest ever FIFA ranking of 95th. BFA claimed this move was taken because it feared for his safety from angry fans. Stanley Tshosane was named as his replacement and in his first game in charge, Botswana achieved a 2–1 win away to Mozambique. While achieving a draw with Ivory Coast, Botswana finished bottom of its qualifying group for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

Botswana defied its ranking to become the first team to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, beating Tunisia both at home and away. This coincided with a rise to its highest ever FIFA ranking of 53rd. It did not manage to build upon this upturn in form at the tournament, losing more narrowly to Ghana and Mali and more heavily to Guinea to finish bottom of its group with 0 points.

The truncated qualification format for the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations saw Botswana face Mali in a two-legged tie, which Botswana lost 7–1 on aggregate. Botswana failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, finishing third in its group with 7 points behind South Africa and Ethiopia.

In October 2013, BFA sacked Tshosane, citing his &quot;failing to meet the targets set for him&quot;. It subsequently appointed Englishman Peter Butler in February 2014.

Beating Burundi and Guinea-Bissau in the knockout rounds, it finished last in its qualifying group for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations with a single point. In its qualifying group for the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations, it finished third - 7 points behind qualifiers Burkina Faso and Uganda. In the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup, it beat Eritrea in the first round and won 2–1 at home against Mali in the first leg of the second round. A 2–0 win for Mali in Bamako meant that Botswana lost on aggregate and failed to make the group stages.

In July 2017, David Bright became manager of the Zebras for the 4th time after BFA chose not to renew Butler&#x27;s contract. He led the team during qualifiers for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, in which Botswana scored only 1 goal in its 6 Group I matches.

Botswana made a poor start to their 2025 Africa Cup of Nations qualification campaign, with two losses leading many to believe they had little chance of making it to Morocco. Despite this, they then picked up eight points from a possible twelve on offer, a 1-1 draw away at Egypt in their last match of the campaign sealing qualification for only their second ever Africa Cup of Nations. This was despite manager Didier Gomes Da Rosa resigning to take charge of Al Ahli, meaning Morena Ramoreboli took interim charge for the team&#x27;s last two matches.

<text>The Rice Thresher is the weekly student newspaper of Rice University in Houston, Texas. It was first published in 1916. It has an estimated circulation of 3,000 and is distributed throughout the university and its surrounding areas.

The &quot;Thresher&quot; has won numerous awards from journalism organizations like the Society of Professional Journalists, Texas Intercollegiate Press Association, the College Media Association (CMA), and the Associated Collegiate Press (ACP), including Best Newspaper for a 4-year University under 5,000 from CMA (2016, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2022), two All-American ratings from ACP (2009–2010, 1995–1996), and four Newspaper Pacemaker Finalist Awards (2018, 2017, 2003, 2000). In 2019, the &quot;Thresher&quot; was named the 2nd best college newspaper in the United States by the Princeton Review, up from 3rd best in 2018 and 12th best in 2017.

The &quot;Thresher&quot; runs on a six-figure annual budget, employs over 100 staffers, and is distributed each Wednesday of the school year with the exception of examinations periods and holidays. The paper is separated into six sections: News, Opinion, Features, Arts and Entertainment, Sports, and the satirical Backpage.

== History ==
&quot;The Rice Thresher&quot; was the first student publication to be formed at the Rice Institute despite it appearing in the fourth academic year (1915–1916). In the fall of 1915, three literary societies - the Elizabeth Baldwin (female), the Owl (male), and the Riceonian (male) - elected three members each to serve on a committee to organize the paper. The committee then selected the founding editorial board, composed entirely of committee members plus two additional students. On Saturday, January 15, 1916, the first issue of the then-bi-weekly &quot;Thresher&quot; was published under the guidance of editor-in-chief William M. Standish.

In 1918, two seminal events occurred to transform the &quot;Thresher&quot; into its modern iteration. First, a voluntary blanket tax was established for publications and sports events. The voluntary tax provided the &quot;Thresher&quot; $1.50 from each student who paid, and the now mandatory blanket tax remains the backbone of &quot;Thresher&quot; finances to this day. Second, in May 1918, the &quot;Thresher&quot; and all other student organizations were transferred under the purview of the newly-formed Student Association, inaugurating a system whereby the leadership of the paper would be elected by the student body along with the &quot;Campanile&quot; leadership and other student officers. During a divisive May 1918 election, students who had paid their blanket tax elected John T. Rather editor in chief and T. J. Burnett managing editor. However, no issues were published during Rather&#x27;s stewardship, owing to a suspension of student activities until the end of World War I. Post-war, a second Student Association election was held in January 1919 and installed Joe R. Shannon as editor in chief, Paul Frederick Bobb as managing editor, and Graham Peck as business manager, resulting in the first issue of the new era on February 6, 1919. From this issue forward, the &quot;Thresher&quot; has published weekly with a few deviations. Over the years, the sections, masthead, offices elected, page dimensions, and number of pages have fluctuated, but the modern &quot;Thresher&quot; was born in 1918.

The &quot;Thresher&quot; has stopped printing twice before: once during World War I, and once during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which most students were asked to leave campus for fear of infection.

<text>Windycon is a science fiction and fantasy literature convention held in Oak Brook, Illinois, on the weekend closest to Veterans Day.

ISFiC, the parent corporation that runs Windycon, was founded in 1973 in Chicago. The first Windycon was held the following year and has been held annually ever since either in Chicago or a Chicago suburb. It is a general interest convention.

ISFiC and Windycon were founded to raise the profile of fandom in Chicago in preparation for a Worldcon bid. In 1982, Chicon IV was the result. From its small beginnings, Windycon has grown to have an annual membership hovering around 1300. It is the largest of the two fan-run Chicago conventions.

Annually since 1986, ISFiC has hosted a writers contest, open to unpublished authors. The contest is judged by professional authors and editors. Separately, Windycon has hosted a writers&#x27; workshop under the coordination of Richard Chwedyk since 2000. From 2004 to 2015, ISFiC Press, the publishing arm of Windycon&#x27;s parent organization, published a Guest of Honor book to be released at the convention.

In addition to traditional con activities, Windycon has also run a series of on-line chats during the con, hosting by Cybling.

<doc id="1158372" wikidata="Q3423331" url="?curid=1158372" title="Regal Trophy">
<text>The Regal Trophy was an annual knock-out competition for British rugby league football clubs. Organised by the Rugby Football League (RFL), the competition was open to all professional clubs in the British rugby league system, but amateur teams and French clubs also took part at various points during its existence.

First held in 1971–72, the tournament was initially played over five rounds. A preliminary round was added in 1981–82 to accommodate the increasing number of professional teams in the sport. The fixtures were normally played during the early part of the season, with the final usually taking place at a neutral venue in January. The tournament was regarded as less prestigious than the RFL&#x27;s primary cup competition, the Challenge Cup, and was discontinued when rugby league became a summer sport in 1996.

During its existence, the competition was always referred to by its sponsorship name. The initial sponsors were the tobacco manufacturer John Player &amp; Sons with Regal taking over in 1989 until the competition&#x27;s end. Over the years, the competition was known as the Player&#x27;s No.6 Trophy (1971–77), the John Player Trophy (1977–83) and the John Player Special Trophy (1983–89), before finally becoming the Regal Trophy in 1989.

==History==
The competition was introduced in 1971 as the Player&#x27;s No.6 Trophy, with sponsors John Player &amp; Sons announcing an £11,000 prize fund for the inaugural season. The competition was open to all professional Rugby Football League clubs, with a small number of amateur clubs taking part in most seasons. 

In 1977–78, Hull-based Cawoods defeated Halifax 9–8 in the first round of the competition, the first time an amateur team had defeated professional opposition in any competition since 1909.

In 1989, a new sponsorship deal was agreed with Imperial Tobacco, and the competition was rebranded as the Regal Trophy.

In 1992, several French clubs entered the competition. This marked the first time that French teams had participated in a British rugby league competition, and clubs would later also be accepted into the Challenge Cup and domestic leagues.

Following the introduction of the Super League in 1996, the Regal Trophy faced an uncertain future, and was ultimately abandoned. The BBC could no longer fit the competition into its TV schedule due to the switch to playing rugby league in the summer, and Regal were unwilling to continue sponsoring the tournament without television coverage.

==List of finals==
===Wins by club===
==Media coverage==
The BBC was the exclusive broadcaster of the competition throughout its history. Matches were broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Grandstand&quot; programme, showing one live match per round. Depending on the TV schedule, only the second-half was shown for some matches in the earlier rounds, but from the semi-final onwards, the entire match was usually covered.

<doc id="1158380" wikidata="Q88828" url="?curid=1158380" title="Captain Blood (1988 video game)">
<text>Captain Blood (&quot;L&#x27;Arche du Captain Blood&quot; in France) is a French video game made by ERE Informatique (soon relabeled with their short-lived &quot;Exxos&quot; label) and released by Infogrames in 1988. It was later re-released in the UK by Players Premier Software.

The game was first released on the Atari ST, and was later for the Commodore 64, Macintosh, Amiga, Apple II, IBM PC, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Thomson TO8 / MO6. The ST version is the only version that includes the full set of alien language sounds.

The title tune is a stripped down version of &quot;Ethnicolor&quot; by Jean-Michel Jarre.

==Plot==
The titular character of the game is a 1980s video game designer, Bob Morlock, who picked &quot;Captain Blood&quot; as a nickname in tribute to the film starring Errol Flynn of the same name. Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing his new project for the first time, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood has successfully disintegrated 25 clones, but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down, or he will lose his last connection with the human species.

==Gameplay==
The objective of the game is to track down and disintegrate five clones of Captain Blood (referred to as Duplicates or Numbers depending on the version of the game). To find them, the player must speak to various aliens and gain their trust. Communication with aliens occurs via an icon-based interface known as UPCOM. This consists of around 150 icons, each representing a different concept. As each alien race discovered speaks its own language and reacts differently, the player must learn to negotiate using these UPCOM concepts in a style that suits each race.

Other unique facets of the gameplay included changes in the player interface as the game progressed; as time wore on, the character&#x27;s health deteriorated. This was represented in-game via an increasing amount of shaking of the mouse cursor, making the game more and more difficult to control. Disintegrating a clone would temporarily relieve the symptoms.

The player starts the game at the bridge of a biological ship, the &quot;Ark&quot;. The ship begins in the vicinity of one of four predetermined planets, each inhabited by a single alien. To make contact with an alien, the player launches an OORXXa biological probeto the planet&#x27;s surface. The player must successfully navigate the probe over a fractal landscape, eventually reaching the alien at the end of a valley. The UPCOM interface then appears so that the player may talk to the alien and find out more information—most importantly, the coordinates of other inhabited planets.

The &quot;Ark&quot; also has the capability to hyperspace to other planets, scan planets for defences, destroy planets and teleport aliens to an area known as the Fridgitorium, for disintegration or transportation to another planet. An alien can only be teleported to the &quot;Ark&quot; after it has consented to do so.

==Development==
&quot;Captain Blood&quot; was developed jointly by Didier Bouchon and Philippe Ulrich, both contributing design and scenario, and Bouchon graphics and programming for the Atari ST version. Bouchon originally designed covers for ERE informatique&#x27;s &quot;Gazoline Software&quot; label, but he learned to program in assembly language for the Atari ST after Ulrich provided him with an assembler. Bouchon then created fractal-generated realtime graphics that inspired both to do a sci-fi inspired video game.

After ERE&#x27;s absorption by Infogrames in the summer of 1987 (partly justified by preliminary versions of &quot;Captain Blood&quot;), Ulrich and Bouchon isolated themselves in the Landes in order to have the game ready for Christmas. Many adaptations for both 16-bit and 8-bit machines were developed in successive months, although they were straight ports of the original Atari ST version in graphics, sound effects or music.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the game a positive review for its unusual concept, execution, and graphics. Orson Scott Card praised &quot;Captain Blood&quot;″s EGA graphics and science-fiction story, but wrote in &quot;Compute!&quot; that &quot;as a game, this one sucks pond scum&quot;, citing a poor interface and obscure game play. Info magazine—January/February 1989—gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, remarking: &quot;Captain Blood is a marvelously alien experience. The graphics &amp; sound are first rate. The more we played, the more we wanted to continue playing, if only to meet more aliens. There is a fully realized universe here that&#x27;s easy to become completely immersed in.&quot;

&quot;Captain Blood&quot; sold more than 100,000 copies worldwide.

==Reviews==
* &quot;Casus Belli&quot; #46 (Aug 1988)
*&quot;Jeux &amp; Stratégie&quot; #50 (as &quot;L&#x27;Arche du Capitaine Blood&quot;)

==Legacy==
&quot;Captain Blood&quot; was followed by the sequel &quot;Commander Blood&quot; in 1994 and later by &quot;Big Bug Bang&quot; in 1997, a French-only release.

<doc id="1158388" wikidata="Q7673288" url="?curid=1158388" title="Table stakes">
<text>In poker and other gambling games, table stakes is a rule that a player may bet no more money than they had on the table at the beginning of that hand; they cannot go back to their pocket for more money once a hand is dealt. This limits the amount that a player can lose, while also limiting the amount other players may have to bet. In between hands, a player is free to re-buy or add on so long as their entire stack after the re-buy or add-on does not exceed the maximum buy-in. 

This rule generally applies to cash or ring games of poker rather than tournament games and is intended to level the stakes by creating a maximum and minimum buy-in as well as rules for adding and removing chips from play when playing with cash. A player also may not take a portion of their money off the table, unless they leave the game and take their entire stack out of play.

Table stakes is the rule in most cash poker games because it allows players with vastly different bankrolls a reasonable amount of protection when playing with one another. Contrary to classic Hollywood poker movie scenes, money taken from the wallet during a hand (called &quot;open stakes&quot;) does not play under table stakes.

&quot;Table stake&quot; (singular form) is related, and is the minimum amount of money a player must put on the table, and thus be able to bet under the table stakes rule, to play a hand.

==Other uses==

In business, &quot;table stakes&quot; are the minimum entry requirement for a market or business arrangement. They can be price, cost model, technology, or other capability that represents a minimum requirement to have a credible competitive starting position in a market or other business arrangement. For example, to be a wireless service provider, the table stakes are the basic features you need to have in order to be in that business to achieve foundation capability—network, handsets, a data service, a mail server, etc. Beyond that, real competitive advantage comes from additional nimbleness and cost or product differentiation.

<text>Lough Gur () is a lake in County Limerick, Ireland between the towns of Herbertstown and Bruff. The lake forms a horseshoe shape at the base of Knockadoon Hill and some rugged elevated countryside. It is one of Ireland&#x27;s most important archaeological sites. Humans have lived near Lough Gur since about 3000 BC and there are numerous megalithic remains there.

Grange stone circle (the largest stone circle in Ireland) and a dolmen are located near the lake. The remains of at least three crannogs are present, and remains of Stone Age houses have been unearthed (the house outlines are known as &quot;The Spectacles&quot;). A number of ring forts are found in the area, with one hill fort overlooking the lake. Some are Irish national monuments.

It is here that the 14th-century lord of Munster and poet Gearóid Iarla, votary of the Goddess Áine, is said to sleep in a cave and emerge at the time of Ireland&#x27;s need to gallop around the lake on his great silver-shod white horse.

A visitors&#x27; centre is open beside Lough Gur, along with a car park and picnic area. A gradual shoreline is present at the visitor area, with a shallow section of lake reaching up to the maintained lawn. As a result, the area is often used for water sports, though motorised craft are banned on the lake.

There is a castle, or tower house (closed to visitors) near the entrance to the carpark. Named Bourchier&#x27;s Castle after Sir George Bourchier, the son of the second Earl of Bath, it lies at the neck of the peninsula around which the lake washes. There is some other architecture dating from more recent times, with the ruins of an early Christian church by the road leading down to the lake. At the far end of the lake are the ruins of a Norman castle, Black Castle, which is reached by a hillside walk along the east side of the lake. This is one of the keeps used during the Desmond Rebellions and is probably the place where the Earl of Desmond secured his authority in 1573 after casting off his English apparel and donning Irish garments on his return to Munster from London.

Lough Gur is a famous location for finding Irish Elk skeletons. The National Museum of Ireland - Natural History has specimens from Lough Gur as does Leeds Museums and Galleries in the UK.

<doc id="1158399" wikidata="Q33227" url="?curid=1158399" title="Hadauti language">
<text>Hadauti or Harauti (Hadoti) is an Indo-Aryan language of Rajasthani languages group spoken by approximately four million people in the Hadoti region of southeastern Rajasthan, India. Its speakers are concentrated in the districts of Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jhalawar in Rajasthan, as well as in neighbouring areas of Madhya Pradesh.

It has a nominative marker /nɛ/, which is absent in other Rajasthani languages.

Its word order is the typical subject–object–verb. Its characteristic feature, unlike Hindi, is the presence or absence of agentive marker in the perfect depending on the nature of the accusative marker.

== Some sample translations ==
== Writing system ==
In India, Hadauti is written in the Devanagari script, an abugida which is written from left to right. Earlier, the Mahajani script, or Modiya, was used to write Rajasthani. The script is also called as Maru Gurjari in a few records.

== Background of Hadauti ==
The Hadauti language is a regional variety of the Rajasthani language spoken by a community in and near the Kota region in Rajasthan, India, and some parts of neighboring Madhya Pradesh. It belongs to the Central-Eastern Rajasthani subgroup of the Indo-Aryan family, as classified by Grierson and Doshi &amp; Purohit. It was included in the Indian Census until 1961, and was classified as one of the mother tongues grouped under Hindi along with Rajasthani language. According to Grierson&#x27;s Linguistic Survey of India, Hadauti is spoken in the districts of Kota, Baran, Bundi and Jhalawar in Rajasthan, as well as in neighbouring areas of Madhya Pradesh.

<doc id="1158403" wikidata="Q4797290" url="?curid=1158403" title="Art Ó Laoghaire">
<text>Art Ó Laoghaire (IPA:ˈaɾˠt̪ˠoːˈl̪ˠiːəɾʲə, also Airt Ó Laoghaire or Art O&#x27;Leary; 1746 – 4 May 1773), a Roman Catholic member of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland, was a captain in the Hungarian Hussars Regiment of the army of Holy Roman Empress Maria Theresa of Austria.

==Life==
He married Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill (aunt of Daniel O&#x27;Connell) in 1767; she had been a widow from the age of 15 and was now 23. They had three children, Cornelius, Fiach and a third who apparently did not survive infancy.

Having returned home to Rathleigh House near Macroom, Cork, Ireland, the hot-tempered Art became involved in a feud with a Protestant landowner and magistrate, Abraham Morris of Hanover Hall, Macroom. When Morris was High Sheriff of County Cork in 1771, he laid charges against Art following Art&#x27;s alleged attack on Morris and the wounding of his servant on 13 July 1771 at Hanover Hall. In that October, Art was indicted his absence, and Morris offered a 20 guinea reward for his capture.

The feud between the two men continued and in 1773, Morris demanded that Art sell him the fine horse that Ó Laoghaire had brought back from his service in the Austro-Hungarian army for £5. The Penal Laws stated that no Catholic might own a horse worth more than £5 and could be forced to sell a more valuable one on demand to any Protestant at this price. Art refused to sell and challenged Morris to a duel, which Morris declined. Morris used, or misused, his position as magistrate to persuade his fellow magistrates to proclaim Art an outlaw, who could then legally be shot on sight. Morris led a contingent of soldiers that tracked Ó Laoghaire down to Carrignanimma on 4 May 1773, and he gave the order to fire on Art. The first shot, which killed Art, was fired by a soldier called Green.

Morris and the soldiers were held to be guilty of Art&#x27;s murder by a coroner&#x27;s inquest on 17 May, but Morris was acquitted of the murder by Cork magistrates on 6 September 1773. (Under the Penal Laws, no Catholic could be a magistrate, or a lawyer.) Morris was shot in Cork on 7 July by Art&#x27;s brother Cornelius, who saw Morris at a window of a house in Hammond&#x27;s Lane where he was lodging and fired three shots, wounding Morris. The shots were not immediately fatal, but Morris died in September 1775: this was believed to have been as the result of the shooting. The soldier Green was decorated for his &quot;gallantry&quot;.

His wife Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill composed the long poem &quot;Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire&quot; (Lament for Art O&#x27;Leary), mourning his death and calling for revenge.

Ó Laoghaire&#x27;s tomb at Kilcrea Friary has the epitaph (probably composed by his widow): &quot;Lo Arthur Leary, generous, handsome, brave, / Slain in his bloom lies in this humble grave.&quot;

<text>Joseph Clark Grew (May 27, 1880 – May 25, 1965) was an American career diplomat and Foreign Service officer. He is best known as the ambassador to Japan from 1932 to 1941 and as a high official in the State Department in Washington from 1944 to 1945. He opposed American hardliners, sought to avoid war, and helped to ensure the soft Japanese surrender in 1945 that enabled a peaceful American occupation of Japan after the war.

After numerous minor diplomatic appointments, Grew was the Ambassador to Denmark (1920–1921) and Ambassador to Switzerland (1921–1924). In 1924, Grew became the Under Secretary of State and oversaw the establishment of the US Foreign Service. Grew then became Ambassador to Turkey (1927–1932). As Ambassador to Japan (1932–1941), he opposed American hardliners and recommended negotiation with Tokyo to avoid war until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941). He was interned until American and Japanese diplomats were formally exchanged in 1942.

On return to Washington, DC, he became the second official in the State Department as Under Secretary and sometimes served as acting Secretary of State. He successfully promoted a soft peace with Japan that would allow Emperor Hirohito to maintain his status, which facilitated the Emperor&#x27;s decision to surrender in 1945.

==Early life==
Grew was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in May 1880 to a wealthy Yankee family. He was groomed for public service. At the age of 12 he was sent to Groton School, an elite preparatory school whose purpose was to &quot;cultivate manly Christian character&quot;. Grew was two grades ahead of Franklin D. Roosevelt.

During his youth, Grew enjoyed the outdoors, sailing, camping, and hunting during his summers away from school. Grew attended Harvard College and graduated in 1902.

==Career==
After his graduation, Grew made a tour of the Far East and nearly died after he had been stricken with malaria. While recovering in India, he became friends with an American consul there. That inspired him to abandon his plan of following in his father&#x27;s career as a banker, and he decided to go into diplomatic service. In 1904, he was a clerk at the consulate in Cairo, Egypt, and he then rotated through diplomatic missions in Mexico City (1906), St. Petersburg (1907), Berlin (1908), Vienna (1911), and again in Berlin (1912–1917). He became acting chief of the State Department&#x27;s Division of Western European Affairs during the war (1917–1919) and was the secretary of the American peace commission in Paris (1919–1920). 

===Ambassador to Denmark and Switzerland ===
From April 7, 1920 to October 14, 1921, Grew served as the U.S. Ambassador to Denmark after his appointment by President Woodrow Wilson. He was preceded by Norman Hapgood and succeeded by John Dyneley Prince. He replaced Hampson Gary as the United States Ambassador to Switzerland after his appointment by President Warren Harding. In 1922, he and Richard Child acted as the American observers at the Conference of Lausanne. Grew served as Ambassador until March 22, 1924, when Hugh S. Gibson replaced him.

===Under Secretary of State (1924–1927)===
From April 16, 1924 to June 30, 1927, Grew served as the Under Secretary of State in Washington under President Calvin Coolidge and succeeded William Phillips.

====Discrimination against Black applicants to the Foreign Service====
During this period, Grew also served as chairman of the Foreign Service Personnel Board. In 1924, the Rogers Act created a merit-based hiring process that enabled Clifton Reginald Wharton Sr. to later that year become the first Black member of the Foreign Service. Grew used his position to manipulate the oral part of the exam specifically to prevent further hiring of Black candidates. After Wharton, no other Black person was hired to join the Foreign Service for more than 20 years.

===Ambassador to Turkey===
In 1927, Grew was appointed as the American ambassador to Turkey. He served in Ankara until 1932, when he was offered the opportunity to return to the Far East.

===Ambassador to Japan===
In 1932, Grew was appointed by President Herbert Hoover to succeed William Cameron Forbes as the Ambassador to Japan, where he took up his posting on June 6. Ambassador and Mrs. Grew had been happy in Turkey, and were hesitant about the move, but decided that Grew would have a unique opportunity to make the difference between peace and war between the United States and Japan. The Grews soon became popular in Japanese society, joining clubs and societies there, and adapting to the culture, even as relations between the two countries deteriorated. During his long tenure in Japan he became well known to the American public, making regular appearances in newspapers, newsreels and magazines, including an appearance on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s cover in 1934, and a long 1940 feature story in &quot;Life&quot; in which writer John Hersey, later famous for &quot;Hiroshima&quot;, called Grew “unquestionably the most important U.S. ambassador” and Tokyo the “most important embassy ever given a U.S. career diplomat.” 

One major episode came on 12 December 1937. During the USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident, the Japanese military bombed and sank the American gunboat &quot;Panay&quot; while it was anchored in the Yangtze River outside Nanking in China. Three American sailors were killed. Japan and the United States were at peace. The Japanese claimed that they had not seen the American flags painted on the deck of the gunboat and then apologized and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack outraged Americans and caused US opinion to turn against the Japanese. 

One of Grew&#x27;s closest and most influential Japanese friends and allies was Prince Tokugawa Iesato (1863–1940), the president of Japan&#x27;s upper house, the House of Peers. During most of the 1930s, both men worked together in various creative diplomatic ways to promote goodwill between their nations. The adjoining photograph showed them having tea together in 1937 after attending a goodwill event to commemorate the 25th anniversary Japanese gift of cherry blossom trees to the US in 1912. The Garden Club of America reciprocated by giving flowering trees to Japan. 

The historian Jonathan Utley argues in &quot;Before Pearl Harbor&quot; that Grew took the position that Japan had legitimate economic and security interests in Greater East Asia and that he hoped that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull would accommodate them by high-level negotiations. However, Roosevelt, Hull, and other top American officials strongly opposed the massive Japanese intervention in China, and they negotiated with China to send American warplanes and with Britain and the Netherlands to cut off sales of steel and oil, which Japan needed for aggressive warfare. Other historians argue that Grew put far too much trust in the power of his moderate friends in the Japanese government.

The question of the Soviet POWs&#x27; conduct was difficult to determine but not their fate if repatriated. Most Soviet POWs stated that they had been given a choice by the Germans: volunteer for labor duty with the German army or be turned over to the Gestapo for execution or service in an &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; (a camp used to work prisoners until they died of starvation or illness). In any case, in Stalin&#x27;s eyes, they were dead men, as they had been captured alive, &quot;contaminated&quot; by contact with those in bourgeois Western nations, and found in service with the German Army.

Notified of their impending transfer to Soviet authorities, a riot at their POW camp erupted. No one was killed by the guards, but some POWS were wounded, and others hanged themselves. Truman granted the men a temporary reprieve, but Grew, as Acting Secretary of State, signed an order on July 11, 1945 forcing the repatriation of the Soviet POWs to the Soviet Union. Soviet co-operation, it was believed, would prove necessary to remake the face of postwar Europe. On August 31, 1945, the 153 survivors were officially returned to the Soviet Union; their ultimate fate is unknown.

===Other work===
Grew&#x27;s book &quot;Sport and Travel in the Far East&quot; was a favorite one of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s. The introduction to the 1910 Houghton Mifflin printing of the book features the following introduction written by Roosevelt:

In 1945, after Grew left the State Department, he wrote two volumes of professional memoirs, published in 1952.

==Personal life==

Grew married Alice de Vermandois Perry (1883-1959), the daughter of premier American impressionist painter Lilla Cabot Perry (1848–1933), daughter of Dr. Samuel Cabot (of the New England Cabots). Alice&#x27;s father was noted American scholar Thomas Sergeant Perry (1845–1928). Through her paternal grandfather, Alice was a great-granddaughter of famed American naval hero Oliver Hazard Perry. Together, Joseph and Alice were the parents of:

* Lilla Cabot Grew (1907–1994), who married Jay Pierrepont Moffat (1896–1943), the American Ambassador to Canada, in 1927, and later married former judge Albert Levitt, in 1956.
*Elizabeth Sturgis Grew (1912–1998), who married Cecil B. Lyon.

He died two days before his 85th birthday on May 25, 1965.

===Descendants===
Grew&#x27;s grandson, Jay Pierrepont Moffat, Jr. (1932-2020), was the United States Ambassador to Chad from 1983 to 1985.

==In popular culture==
In the 1970 film &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, a historical drama about the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the part of US Ambassador Joseph Grew was played by Meredith Weatherby.

<doc id="1158422" wikidata="Q1093332" url="?curid=1158422" title="Illinois Central Railroad">
<text>The Illinois Central Railroad , sometimes called the Main Line of Mid-America, was a railroad in the Central United States. Its primary routes connected Chicago, Illinois, with New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama, and thus, the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Another line connected Chicago west to Sioux City, Iowa (1870), while smaller branches reached Omaha, Nebraska (1899) from Fort Dodge, Iowa, and Sioux Falls, South Dakota (1877), from Cherokee, Iowa. The IC also ran service to Miami, Florida, on trackage owned by other railroads.

The IC, founded in 1851, pioneered the financing later used by several long distance U.S. railroads whose construction was partially financed through a federal land grant. In 1988, the Canadian National Railway, via Grand Trunk Corporation, acquired control of the IC in 1998, and absorbed its operations the following year. The Illinois Central Railroad maintains its corporate existence as a non-operating subsidiary. In 1971, Steve Goodman released a folk anthem, &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; about riding on Illinois Central&#x27;s &quot;Monday-morning rail&quot; train and the passing of the &quot;magic carpet&quot; ride of passenger rail service in the United States, which once dominated travel.

==History==
The IC was one of the oldest Class I railroads in the United States. The company was incorporated by the Illinois General Assembly on January 16, 1836. Within a few months Rep. Zadok Casey (D-Illinois) introduced a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives authorizing a land grant to the company to construct a line from the mouth of the Ohio River to Chicago and on to Galena. Federal support, however, was not approved until 1850, when U.S. President Millard Fillmore signed a land grant for the construction of the railroad. The Illinois Central was the first land-grant railroad in the United States.


The Illinois Central was chartered by the Illinois General Assembly on February 10, 1851. Senator Stephen A. Douglas and later President Abraham Lincoln were both Illinois Central men who lobbied for it. Douglas owned land near the terminal in Chicago. Lincoln was a lawyer for the railroad. Illinois legislators appointed Samuel D. Lockwood, recently retired from the Illinois Supreme Court (who may have given both lawyers the oral examination before admitting them to the Illinois bar), as a trustee on the new railroad&#x27;s board to guard the public&#x27;s interest. Lockwood, who would serve more than two decades until his death, had overseen federal land monies shortly after Illinois&#x27; statehood, then helped oversee early construction of the recently completed Illinois and Michigan Canal.

Upon its completion in 1856, the IC was the longest railroad in the world. Its main line went from Cairo, Illinois, at the southern tip of the state, to Galena, in the northwest corner. A branch line went from Centralia (named for the railroad), to the rapidly growing city of Chicago. In Chicago, its tracks were laid along the shore of Lake Michigan and on an offshore causeway downtown, but land-filling and natural deposition have moved the present-day shore to the east. Track from Centralia north to Freeport would be abandoned in the 1980s, as traffic to Galena was routed via Chicago.

In 1867, the Illinois Central extended its track into Iowa. During the 1870s and 1880s, the IC acquired and expanded railroads in the southern United States. IC lines crisscrossed the state of Mississippi and went as far south as New Orleans, Louisiana, and east to Louisville, Kentucky. In the 1880s, northern lines were built to Dodgeville, Wisconsin; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Omaha, Nebraska. Further expansion continued into the early twentieth century.

The Illinois Central, and the other &quot;Harriman lines&quot; owned by E.H. Harriman by the twentieth century, became the target of the Illinois Central shopmen&#x27;s strike of 1911. Although marked by violence and sabotage in the southern, midwestern, and western states, the strike was effectively over in a few months. The railroads simply hired replacements, among them African-American strikebreakers, and withstood diminishing union pressure. The strike was eventually called off in 1915.

The totals above do not include the Waterloo RR, Batesville Southwestern, Peabody Short Line or CofG and its subsidiaries. On December 31, 1925, IC/Y&amp;MV/G&amp;SI operated 6,562 route-miles on 11,030 miles of track; A&amp;V and VS&amp;P added 330 route-miles and 491 track-miles. At the end of 1970, IC operated 6,761 miles of road and 11,159 of track.

In 1960, the railroad retired its last steam locomotive, 2-8-2 Mikado #1518. On August 31, 1962, the railroad was incorporated as Illinois Central Industries, Inc. ICI acquired Abex Corporation (formerly American Brake Shoe and Foundry Co.) in 1968.

===Illinois Central Gulf Railroad (1972–1988)===

On August 10, 1972, the Illinois Central Railroad merged with the Gulf, Mobile and Ohio Railroad to form the Illinois Central Gulf Railroad . October 30 of that year saw the Illinois Central Gulf commuter rail crash, the company&#x27;s deadliest.

At the end of 1980, ICG operated 8,366 miles of railroad on 13,532 miles of track; that year it reported 33,276 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 323 million passenger-miles. Later in that decade, the railroad spun off most of its east–west lines and many of its redundant north–south lines, including much of the former GM&amp;O. Most of these lines were bought by other railroads, including entirely new railroads such as the Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway; Paducah and Louisville Railway; Chicago Central and Pacific Railroad; and MidSouth Rail Corporation.

In 1988, the railroad&#x27;s parent company, IC Industries, spun off its remaining rail assets and changed its name to Whitman Corporation. On February 29, 1988, the newly separated ICG dropped the &quot;Gulf&quot; from its name and again became the Illinois Central Railroad.

===Canadian National Railway (1998–present)===
On February 11, 1998, the IC was purchased for about $2.4 billion in cash and shares by Canadian National Railway (CN). Integration of operations began July 1, 1999.

In November 2020, as part of the 25th anniversary celebrations of CN&#x27;s privatization, the company presented as one of its units repainted in the schemes of the company&#x27;s predecessor and/or subsidiary railroads, GE ET44AC #3008, which was repainted in the black livery of IC, along with the logos of that company.

==Locomotives==
==Passenger train service==
Illinois Central was the major carrier of passengers on its Chicago-to-New Orleans mainline and between Chicago and St. Louis. IC also ran passengers on its Chicago-to-Omaha line, though it was never among the top performers on this route. Illinois Central&#x27;s largest passenger terminal, Central Station, stood at 12th Street east of Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Due to the railroad&#x27;s north–south route from the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes, Illinois Central passenger trains were one means of transport during the African American Great Migration of the 1920s.

Illinois Central&#x27;s most famous train was the &quot;Panama Limited&quot;, a premier all-Pullman car service between Chicago and New Orleans, with a section breaking off at Carbondale to serve St. Louis. In 1949, it added a daytime all-coach companion, the &quot;City of New Orleans,&quot; which operated with a St. Louis section breaking off at Carbondale and a Louisville section breaking off at Fulton, Kentucky. In 1967, due to losses incurred by the operation of the train, the Illinois Central combined the Panama Limited with a coach-only train called the &quot;Magnolia Star&quot;.

On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over intercity rail service. It retained service over the IC mainline, but dropped the &quot;Panama Limited&quot; in favor of the &quot;City of New Orleans.&quot; However, since it did not connect with any other trains in either New Orleans or Chicago, Amtrak moved the route to an overnight schedule and brought back the &quot;Panama Limited&quot; name. However, it restored the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; name in 1981, while retaining the overnight schedule. This was to capitalize on the popularity of a song about the train, called City of New Orleans (song) written by Steve Goodman and performed by Arlo Guthrie. Willie Nelson&#x27;s recording of the song was #1 on the Hot Country Charts in 1984.

Illinois Central ran several other trains along the main route including &quot;The Creole&quot; and &quot;The Louisiane&quot;.

The &quot;Green Diamond&quot; was the Illinois Central&#x27;s premier train between Chicago, Springfield and St. Louis. Other important trains included the &quot;Hawkeye&quot; which ran daily between Chicago and Sioux City and the &quot;City of Miami&quot; eventually running every other day between Chicago and Miami via the Atlantic Coast Line, the Central of Georgia Railroad and Florida East Coast Railway.

The Illinois Central was also a major operator of commuter trains in the Chicago area, operating what eventually became the &quot;IC Electric&quot; line from Randolph Street Terminal in downtown Chicago to the southeast suburbs. In 1987, IC sold this line to Metra, who operates it as the Metra Electric District. It still operates out of what is now Millennium Station, which is still called &quot;Randolph Street Terminal&quot; by many longtime Chicago-area residents. In honor of the &quot;Panama Limited,&quot; the Electric District appears as &quot;Panama Orange&quot; on Metra system maps and timetables. Additionally, the IC operated a second commuter line out of Chicago (the West Line) which served Chicago&#x27;s western suburbs. Unlike the electrified commuter service, the West Line did not generate much traffic and was eliminated in 1931.

Amtrak presently runs three trains daily over this route, the &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; and the &quot;Illini&quot; and &quot;Saluki&quot; between Chicago and Carbondale. Another Illinois corridor service is planned for the former &quot;Black Hawk&quot; route between Chicago, Rockford and Dubuque. Amtrak, at the state of Illinois&#x27; request, did a feasibility study to reinstate the &quot;Black Hawk&quot; route to Rockford and Dubuque. Initial capital costs range from $32 million to $55 million, depending on the route. Once in operation, the service would require roughly $5 million a year in subsidies from the state.

On December 10, 2010, IDOT announced the route choice for the resumption of service to begin in 2014 going over mostly CN railway.

==Mississippi Central (1852–1878)==
The original Mississippi Central line was chartered in 1852. Construction of the gauge line began in 1853 and was completed in 1860, just prior to the Civil War, from Canton, Mississippi to Jackson, Tennessee. The southern terminus of the line connected to the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad at Canton. It also connected to the Memphis and Charleston Railroad at Grand Junction, Tennessee and the Mobile and Ohio Railroad at Jackson, Tennessee. The Mississippi Central was the scene of several military actions from 1862 to 1863 and was severely damaged during the fighting. Company president, Absolom M. West succeeded in repairing the damage and returning it to operating condition soon after the end of the War.

By 1874, interchange traffic with the Illinois Central Railroad was important enough that the IC installed a Nutter hoist at Cairo, Illinois to interchange between its standard gauge equipment broad gauge used by the Mississippi Central. This allowed the trucks to be exchanged on 16-18 freight cars per hour; a Pullman car could be changed in 15 minutes. The original Mississippi Central line was merged into the Illinois Central Railroad subsidiary Chicago, St. Louis and New Orleans Railroad in several transactions finally completed in 1878.

==Mississippi Central (1897–1967)==

A line started in 1897 as the &quot;Pearl and Leaf Rivers Railroad&quot; was built by the J.J. Newman Lumber Company from Hattiesburg, to Sumrall. In 1904 the name was changed to the Mississippi Central Railroad . In 1906 the Natchez and Eastern Railway was formed to build a rail line from Natchez to Brookhaven. In 1909 this line was absorbed by the Mississippi Central.

For a short time during the 1920s, the line operated a service named &quot;The Natchez Route&quot;, running trains from Natchez to Mobile, Alabama through trackage agreements with the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad. At Natchez, freight cars were ferried across the Mississippi River to connect with the Louisiana and Arkansas Railway to institute through traffic into Shreveport, Louisiana. In 1967 the property of the Mississippi Central was sold to the Illinois Central Railroad.

<text>The John Day River is a tributary of the Columbia River, approximately long, in northwestern Oregon in the United States. The river rises in the Northern Oregon Coast Range in Clatsop County at .

Flowing generally north, the river enters the Columbia at John Day Point, east of Tongue Point and about east of Astoria. It passes under U.S. Route 30 near the unincorporated community of John Day (not to be confused with the city of the same name in Grant County). The mouth of the river is about upstream from the mouth of the Columbia on the Pacific. The John Day River has only one named tributary, Jack Creek, which enters from the left.

The river is named for John Day, a hunter and fur trapper who took part in William Price Hunt&#x27;s overland expedition for John Jacob Astor in 1811–12. There&#x27;s a John Day River in eastern Oregon, a John Day Dam, a city John Day, and John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, which were all named after John Day. John Day Point, a cape located at the mouth of the river and protruding into Cathlamet Bay, takes its name from the river, as did a former railway station in the vicinity. Lewis and Clark, who camped near here in 1805, referred to the river as &quot;Kekemarke&quot;, their version of a Native American name. Lewis and Clark write about the river in their journals. The river was known as Swan Creek by Charles Wilkes, of the U.S. Exploring Expedition and was documented as such on his illustrated map.

There&#x27;s a railroad swing bridge crossing the mouth of the river. The tracks were used by Lewis and Clark Explorer Train which is no longer operating. The railroad bridge has a clearance of 8 feet.

Tidal currents control the river throughout most of its length. Moored houseboats cover some of the shorelines on both sides of the river.

== Recreational activities ==
The John Day River is open to boats, kayaks, and fishing. John Day County Park is 54 acres and the only public park along the John Day River. The boat launch is accessed off Oregon Highway 30. The boat launch puts users into the John Day River just before it enters the Columbia River, giving users access to both. The river can be accessed for about 3.5 miles upstream once you leave the boat ramp.
== Marsh ==
An uncommon tidal marsh exists along the John Day River. The Marsh is a little over 24 acres owned by North Coast Land Conservancy. The John Day River Marsh is part of the Columbia Quiet Waters initiative which covers the lower Columbia River swamp. The initiative includes a conservation plan to protect the Sitka spruce wetlands that are regarded as rare worldwide.

<doc id="1158464" wikidata="Q4497835" url="?curid=1158464" title="Jeremy Hinzman">
<text>Jeremy Dean Hinzman (born 1979) is an Iraq War resister who was the first American deserter to seek refugee status in Canada.

Born in Rapid City, South Dakota, Hinzman enlisted in the U.S. Army as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division and deserted in 2004 to avoid participating in the Iraq War. &quot;He fled to Canada with his wife and preschool-age son. Now living in Toronto and working as a bike courier, Hinzman faces a court-martial and a possible five-year prison sentence if he returns to the United States. Hinzman said he sought refugee status because he opposed the war in Iraq on moral grounds and argued the U.S. invasion violated international human rights standards.&quot;

He was one of the first to have his application for refugee status rejected—a decision he unsuccessfully appealed to the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. His request to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court was rejected in November 2007. At that time, he filed for a pre-removal risk assessment with Citizenship and Immigration Canada, which determines if a denied refugee applicant would be subject to torture, death or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to their country of origin.

Distinct from his application for refugee status, he also filed for permanent residency on &quot;humanitarian and compassionate grounds.&quot; 

==Military service==
Jeremy Hinzman voluntarily joined the U.S. Army early in 2001, completing basic combat training and airborne school in Fort Benning, Georgia.

Along with his wife, Nga Nguyen, he began attending meetings of the Religious Society of Friends in January 2002. His newfound pacifist beliefs and the birth of his son, Liam, in May 2002, were among the reasons he cited for applying for conscientious objector status in August 2002. Amnesty International notes that Hinzman &quot;took reasonable steps to register his conscientious objection through seeking non-combatant status in [August] 2002, an application which was rejected [April 2003].&quot; This means that he tried for eight months, unsuccessfully, to be officially and &quot;legally&quot; referred to as a &quot;conscientious objector&quot;.

His unit was deployed to take part in the war in Afghanistan later in 2002. Hinzman fulfilled a non-combat role there while his conscientious objector application was being processed. It was ultimately denied, and he then returned to his regular unit, serving as its armorer. When his unit received orders to join in the Iraq War, Hinzman deserted, crossing the border into Canada with his wife and son.

==Life in Canada==
He filed a refugee claim upon his arrival in Canada, in January 2004. He was one of at least 28 soldiers actively seeking refugee status in Canada after deserting the United States military out of opposition to the Iraq conflict. While waiting for various legal decisions to be made on his case, Hinzman and his family continued to live in Toronto, Ontario. Hinzman, along with fellow deserter Brandon Hughey, has become a popular figure in the anti-war movement. He occasionally travels to other Canadian cities to speak on campuses and at peace rallies. Hinzman has also drawn criticism, and during his hearing stated that he has received death threats from American citizens.

If and when his legal options are exhausted, Hinzman will then face the prospect of deportation from Canada and extradition to U.S. military custody. If he is ultimately deported, he faces court-martial in the U.S. Army. If the Army pursues a general court-martial, he could be sentenced to the punishment of up to five years in prison and a dishonorable discharge for the crime of &quot;desertion with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service.&quot;

In a 12 May 2005 media briefing, Amnesty International stated:

Amnesty International considers Mr Jeremy Hinzman to have a genuine conscientious objection to serving as a combatant in the U.S. forces in Iraq. Amnesty International further considers that he took reasonable steps to register his conscientious objection through seeking non-combatant status in 2002, an application which was rejected. Accordingly, should he be imprisoned upon his return to the United States, Amnesty International would consider him to be a prisoner of conscience.

==Experience with the Canadian legal and political systems==

===Hearing at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada===
Hinzman&#x27;s first hearing was held from December 6 to December 8, 2004, at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), presided over by Coram Brian P. Goodman. It was the first of similar refugee applications.

His lawyer, Jeffry House, pointed out a precedent set by federal court Judge Arthur Stone in 1995 who approved refugee status for a deserter from Iraq&#x27;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Stone wrote, &quot;There is a range of military activity which is simply never permissible in that it violates basic international standards. This includes ... non-defensive incursions into foreign territory.&quot;

The case of Iraq War resisters became more than a legal issue when Canadian government lawyers entered the situation and presented arguments to the IRB adjudicator just before this precedent-setting hearing. &quot;Government lawyers argued at Hinzman&#x27;s immigration hearing that the entire question of the war&#x27;s legality was &#x27;irrelevant.&#x27;... The federal immigration officer adjudicating the case [Brian P. Goodman] agreed. He ruled [November 12, 2004] that Hinzman may not use the legal basis of the Iraq War to justify his...claim.&quot;
The claim for refugee status was ultimately rejected. The government at the time was the Liberal Party of Canada led by Prime Minister Paul Martin; and the lawyer representing that government&#x27;s Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Judy Sgro, was Janet Chisholm.

Reporting on Goodman&#x27;s decision, the BBC stated that the ruling &quot;did not come as a surprise...[Canadian] officials are aware that accusing Washington of persecuting its citizens would cause an international diplomatic incident.&quot;

===Federal Court Appeal===
Justice Anne L. Mactavish presided over the Federal Court case of Hinzman v. Canada, 2006 FC 420, and released her ruling on 31 March 2006, upholding the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board.

In her decision, Mactavish addressed the issue of personal responsibility as follows:An individual must be involved at the policy-making level to be culpable for a crime against peace...the ordinary foot soldier is not expected to make his or her personal assessment as to the legality of a conflict. Similarly, such an individual cannot be held criminally responsible for fighting in support of an illegal war, assuming that his or her war-time conduct is otherwise proper.Alex Neve, who taught international human rights and refugee law at Osgoode Hall Law School, expressed concern that Mactavish&#x27;s decision sets a precedent whereby &quot;those at senior levels who have an objection to war may [seek refugee status], and those who deploy who have an objection may not. This runs contrary to other international law rulings.&quot; One of those rulings is Nuremberg Principle IV, which reads, &quot;The fact that a person acted under order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was, in fact, possible to him.&quot;

&quot;The main arguments advanced by Hinzman&#x27;s lawyer, Jeffry House, [were] that the war in Iraq is against international law and that Hinzman ... would have been forced to participate in unlawful acts had he gone.&quot;

===Supreme Court of Canada===
On 15 November 2007, a quorum of the Supreme Court of Canada made of Justices Michel Bastarache, Rosalie Abella, and Louise Charron refused an application to have the Court hear the case on appeal, without giving reasons.

In an editorial for the Ottawa Citizen, Lawrence Hill accused the courts of a double standard concerning the 1995 decision where the Federal Court of Appeal granted refugee status to a deserter from Iraq.

===Political aftermath in 2007 and 2008===
Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, NDP immigration critic Olivia Chow asked the parliamentary Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration to vote in favour of allowing conscientious objectors who refused or left U.S. military service in Iraq to be allowed to stay in Canada.

On 6 December 2007, after some amendments to Chow&#x27;s original motion, the Standing Committee adopted a motion recommending that:the government immediately implement a program to allow conscientious objectors and their immediate family members (partners and dependents), who have refused or left military service related to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations and do not have a criminal record, to apply for permanent resident status and remain in Canada; and that the government should immediately cease any removal or deportation actions that may have already commenced against such individuals.On 3 June 2008, the Parliament of Canada passed a motion (137 to 110) that recommended the government immediately implement a program which would &quot;allow conscientious objectors...to a war not sanctioned by the United Nations...to...remain in Canada.&quot; The motion gained international attention from the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Britain&#x27;s BBC, and the New Zealand press.

On July 22 that year, Officer S. Parr issued a negative decision on the Hinzman application to stay in Canada on &quot;humanitarian and compassionate grounds.&quot; On July 25, she also issued a &quot;distinctly separate&quot; negative decision on the Hinzman application to stay in Canada as refugees (in their &quot;Pre-Removal Risk Assessment&quot;).

That following August 13, the Canada Border Services Agency ordered Hinzman, along with his wife, son, and baby daughter, to leave the country by 23 September 2008. In response to that order, at a press conference on September 18, Bob Rae, the Liberal Foreign Affairs Critic, joined Hinzman to make an urgent appeal to the Conservative government to stop the imminent deportation of Hinzman and his family. He also urged the government to support a motion passed earlier that year by all parties, except the Conservatives, to let all eligible conscientious objectors take up permanent residence.

===Stay of deportation===
On 22 September 2008, Hinzman and his family were granted a stay of deportation at the last minute by a Federal Court judge while the court decided whether to hear their appeal. The judge&#x27;s decision would allow the family to remain in Toronto while the court decided whether to review a decision by Citizenship and Immigration officials not to let the Hinzmans remain in Canada on &quot;humanitarian and compassionate grounds.&quot; (This was a distinctly separate legal effort from the refugee application and its accompanying Pre-Removal Risk Assessment.)

At the hearing on that day, Hinzman&#x27;s lawyer Alyssa Manning told Justice Richard Mosley that new evidence demonstrated that outspoken critics of the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 faced harsher treatment than other deserters. For example, she said, deserter Robin Long was sentenced to 15 months in prison the previous month after prosecutors made mention of a media interview he had given in Canada before he was deported in July.

The issue of &quot;differential&quot; treatment for those who had spoken out against the U.S.-led invasion appeared to trouble Justice Mosley, who said: &quot;I don&#x27;t know how it is an aggravating feature or element to be introduced in sentencing.&quot; In his 3-page endorsement, Mosley said: &quot;Based on the evidence and submissions before me, I am satisfied that the applicants would suffer irreparable harm if a stay were not granted pending determination of their leave application.&quot;

In order to win the stay of deportation, Manning had to show that her client would suffer &quot;irreparable harm,&quot; if returned to the United States as noted in Justice Mosley&#x27;s quote above. Manning also argued that this legal criterion of &quot;irreparable harm&quot; were met in another way: the permanent loss of voting privileges in the country of one&#x27;s residence (which accompanies the felony of desertion in the US) also constitutes &quot;irreparable harm,&quot; Manning argued.

====Humanitarian and compassionate grounds====
On 10 February 2009, Federal Court Justice James Russell heard the appeal of the decision in the Hinzman family&#x27;s &quot;humanitarian and compassionate grounds&quot; (H&amp;C) application (not an appeal of their refugee claim). On April 24 that year, the judge upheld the negative decision in the Hinzmans&#x27; application. (His judgment was officially issued June 2.)

However, this was appealed to the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal on 25 May 2010.

On 6 July 2010, the Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that a Canadian immigration official (S. Parr) decision (22 July 2008), and also the lower court&#x27;s upholding of that decision (2 June 2009), both failed to consider the &quot;hardships&quot; of Hinzman. The court said the rejection of Hinzman&#x27;s permanent residence application was &quot;significantly flawed&quot; because the officer did not take into consideration Hinzman&#x27;s &quot;strong moral and religious beliefs&quot; against participation in the war. That means officials must take another look at Hinzman&#x27;s application to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.

Hinzman&#x27;s lawyer, Alyssa Manning, said, that his &quot;officer missed the point and only considered refugee-type questions.&quot; Refugee cases typically only consider risk to life or risk of persecution. &quot;An H&amp;C [officer] is supposed to consider humanitarian and compassionate values — the questions inherent with an H&amp;C application,&quot; Manning said. &quot;Hinzman&#x27;s beliefs, his whole reasons for being in Canada in the first place, weren&#x27;t considered by the H&amp;C officer, and that&#x27;s what was significantly flawed about [the officer&#x27;s] decision.&quot;

Hinzman&#x27;s case will now go back for another hearing before a different immigration officer. Michelle Robidoux, a spokeswoman with the War Resisters Support Campaign, said the appellate ruling is important for other war resisters in Canada as well.

==Arguments==

It has been widely argued that Hinzman is not a prisoner of conscience because he has not been persecuted for his claimed new-found beliefs. In the United States military, desertion is a crime, specifically a federal offense under Article 85 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, despite his claimed motivation. Hinzman&#x27;s application for conscientious objector status was denied due to the fact that he was known to have made statements to the effect that he would consider participating in certain types of defensive actions. Conscientious objector status is only granted to those in the U.S. military who object to all warfare, not to military personnel who object to a specific war or conflict.

Hinzman enlisted voluntarily in the Army, volunteered for infantry duty, and further volunteered for airborne training, a series of deliberate and conscious decisions on Hinzman&#x27;s part which would practically guarantee combat duty. These circumstances cause critics to be skeptical as to the sincerity of Hinzman&#x27;s claims to being a conscientious objector. Such critics have suggested that, if Hinzman were sincere in his beliefs, he would return to the United States voluntarily and accept whatever consequences his actions and beliefs might bring about.

Key to this discussion are three questions: (1) whether soldiers are legally allowed to change their minds if they encounter new information; (2) whether Hinzman encountered new information; and (3) at what point in his service did Hinzman acquire new information. The answer to the last two questions have been answered in Hinzman&#x27;s sworn testimony.

In regard to whether soldiers are legally allowed to change their minds if they encounter new information, the answer is &quot;yes&quot; according to the following international statutes. On 8 March 1995, the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) resolution 1995/83 stated that &quot;persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service.&quot; That position was re-affirmed in 1998, when the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights document called &quot;Conscientious objection to military service, United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77&quot; officially recognized that &quot;persons [&quot;already&quot;] performing military service may &quot;develop&quot; conscientious objections.&quot; In 1998, the UNCHR reiterated previous statements and added &quot;states should...refrain from subjecting conscientious objectors...to repeated punishment for failure to perform military service.&quot; It also encouraged states &quot;to consider granting asylum to those conscientious objectors compelled to leave their country of origin because they fear persecution owing to their refusal to perform military service.&quot;

==In popular culture==
A live theater production entitled, &quot;The Hearing of Jeremy Hinzman&quot; was staged in August 2012, in Toronto, as part of the annual Summerworks Theatre Festival. It was written by Josh Bloch and Oonagh Duncan, produced by Foundry Theatre Company, and directed by Richard Greenblatt. According to Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Now Magazine&quot;, the drama was based &quot;on the real-life case of an Iraq War deserter who was put on trial in 2004 to determine his status as a refugee in Canada, this example of verbatim theatre debates the legality of the 2003 U.S. invasion, and the rights of individual soldiers to think for themselves.&quot;

&quot;Peace Has No Borders&quot; is a 2016 feature-length documentary about Iraq and Afghan War resisters from the U.S. seeking refuge in Canada, directed by Deb Ellis and Denis Mueller.

During the 1990&#x27; - after several pitches to galleries in São Paulo and in Rio de Janeiro - Lia was taken on by the Thomas Cohn Arte Contemporânea gallery in Rio, the same gallery credited with launching the careers of Leda Catunda and Leonilson. The Thomas Cohn gallery featured her first exhibit outside of Porto Alegre.

Following her national recognition, between 1993 and 1994 Lia lived as fellow in Stanford University with a grant awarded by the International Fellowship in the Visual Arts. In 1997 she exhibited her work at the 6ª Bienal de Havana, at the Biennial of Los Angeles and at the 1ª Bienal de Artes Visuais do Mercosul, consolidating her international career.

Several galleries have featured solo exhibitions of Lia Menna Barreto&#x27;s work. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the Galeria Fortes Vilaça has hosted her &quot;[ Projeto 2001 ]&quot;, &quot;Origem do Afeto&quot; and assorted other works in the last decade. In Porto Alegre, her work has appeared in the Diário de uma Boneca, the Exercícios Afetivos (MARGS), the Galeria Iberê Camargo and the Galeria Arte e Fato. In Rio de Janeiro, the Thomas Cohn Arte Contemporânea show featured her works in 1990, 1992, and 1995.

== Critical reception ==
Lia is most famous (or infamous, rather) for her deconstruction of childhood through the transmogrification of dolls and plastic toys, which she began to explore during the 1990s.

Katia Kanton, writing in Poliester Magazine, describes her work this way:

&quot;In her strange formal operations, Lia Menna Barreto defies the sweetened way of looking at the world of children. Her radical vision engenders a relevant social commentary that is involved with and questions the oppression of the everyday experience, full of mutilations and losses and feelings of safety and danger.&quot;

Also on the subject of Barreto&#x27;s work with dolls, Paulo Herkenhoff says:

&quot;In Menna Barreto&#x27;s work, the experience is that of the unlearning and of the transgression. The crisis, more precisely, is that of the subject itself.&quot;

<text>The Ribble Steam Railway is a standard gauge preserved railway in Lancashire, in the United Kingdom. It was opened to the public on 17 September 2005, running along Preston Docks. The railway began by housing much of the collection from the previously closed Southport Railway Museum (Steamport), which was based in the old Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway engine shed at Southport (BR shed code 27C).

The railway lines around Preston Dock largely fell into disuse after the closure of the docks. A preservation group that was operating in Southport relocated to Preston in 1999 and started operations as the Ribble Steam Railway in 2005. Its operations base is at but they run trains as far as Strand Road although there is no facility for locomotives to run round their train here.

The Riverside station is quite a way from Preston city centre, but proposals have been made for a platform to be constructed at Strand Road. This would be close to the Portway terminus of the Preston park and ride service, Guild Wheel walking trail and the River Ribble.

==History==
The project was first started in 1973, a preservation centre opened in Southport, on the former Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway steam shed at Derby Road. However, the shed was becoming a costly burden to handle for the museum, so a relocation scheme was started. Preston Docks was chosen as the new location for the museum. Preston Docks has a large railway network, that used to serve the vast docks and quays. But when the docks closed, the railway was not used. The project finally closed the Southport Railway Museum in 1999.

The project&#x27;s new site now could be re-developed with new large workshops, platforms and a museum. The first building to open was the workshop, in 2001. Locomotives could now go into the building, and more space could now be utilised. Next to the workshop, is the machine shop, built in 1978. At the other end of the workshop is the visitor centre, which contains the museum, cafe, shop and railway platform. The museum was finally completed in 2004. The collection of locomotives (61, one on loan from the National Railway Museum, one from the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Trust. 55 are currently on site.), is one of the largest collection of locomotives in the United Kingdom.

==Operations==
The museum also operates passenger services to Strand Road Crossing and back, from its own station – Preston Riverside. The frequency of its trains is hourly, and are usually made up of two or more Mark 1 coaches and a small steam engine or diesel engine.

==Future==
There have also been plans to extend the railway to the Ribble Link canal. The route would offer 1.5 miles extra to the line, although plans for this have not been finalised as major funding streams need to be found, in order to raise the huge amount of funds required for such a significant project.

==Strand Road Crossing==

Strand Road Crossing () is a level crossing in Preston, Lancashire. It is situated on a freight-only branch line from Preston railway station which is used by trains serving Preston Docks. The Ribble Steam Railway terminates adjacent to the level crossing and it is proposed that a station should be built on the site.


===Freight traffic===

The only regular freight traffic on the line was to deliver bitumen, transported using a consist of 15 tank wagons from Lindsey Oil Refinery, Lincolnshire to the Preston Total facility, three times weekly. After crossing the road it was taken a short distance to a group of three railway tracks. The main line locomotive switches to a train of empty wagons while a small diesel locomotive takes the full train on to the Lanfina Siding which is adjacent to Lockside Road near station. The Lanfina sidings are located across the road (Chain Caul Way) from Total&#x27;s Bitumen works at Lanfina house, where product was pumped from the tankers to the facility via an overhead gantry. This practice came to an end in January 2025, when deliveries switched to road transport.

<doc id="1158489" wikidata="Q649057" url="?curid=1158489" title="Portobello, Dublin">
<text>Portobello (, meaning &#x27;beautiful harbour&#x27;) is an area of Dublin in Ireland, within the southern city centre and bounded to the south by the Grand Canal. It came into existence as a small suburb south of the city in the 18th century, centred on Richmond Street.

As a fast-expanding suburb during the 19th century, Portobello attracted many upwardly mobile families whose members went on to play important roles in politics, the arts and science. Towards the end of the century, many Ashkenazi Jews, fleeing pogroms in Russia and Eastern Europe, settled in the area; this led to Portobello being known as Dublin&#x27;s &quot;Little Jerusalem&quot;.

Portobello is in the Dublin 8 postal district, which is currently rendered as D08 under the Eircode system, as well as in the local electoral area of Dublin South East Inner City and the Dáil constituency of Dublin Bay South.
==History==
The name Portobello also describes the stretch of the Grand Canal leading from Robert Emmet Bridge (Clanbrassil Street) to the bridge from South Richmond Street to Rathmines. Although usually referred to as Portobello Bridge, the correct name is La Touche Bridge (named after William Digges La Touche (1747–1803), scion of a prominent Dublin business family and a director of the Grand Canal Company). Like the Portobello Road of London and Portobello, Edinburgh, Dublin&#x27;s Portobello was named for the capture by Admiral Edward Vernon in 1739 of Portobelo, Colón on Panama&#x27;s Caribbean Coast, during the conflict between the United Kingdom and Spain known as the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

===17th century===
A century before the naming of the suburb, an eventful battle took place in the neighbourhood – the Battle of Rathmines. In the early years of the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1649) incursions were made into the area as far as St. Kevin&#x27;s church by bands of Confederate soldiers stationed in Wicklow. They made off with cattle, horses and the occasional wealthy merchant. After the Irish united with the Royalists against the Parliamentarians, an attempt was made to take Dublin. In the summer of 1649 the Duke of Ormonde, head of the forces of Royalists and Irish soldiers, approached Dublin, where the Parliamentarian army was holed up. For some unaccountable reason, he took his army over to Finglas, where he spent a month, which allowed the Roundheads to reinforce and plan their attack. By the time Ormonde&#x27;s main force moved around to the south of the city, the Roundheads were ready and fighting broke out. Ormonde&#x27;s army was defeated, many of them killed, and the place where they fell (mainly between Rathmines and Ranelagh) was known for a long time as the Bloody Fields. The name of the Bleeding Horse pub in Camden Street reputedly originated at this time from a horse wandering from the scene of the battle to St. Kevin&#x27;s Port (now Camden Street).

The Bleeding Horse pub is reputed to be the second oldest pub in Dublin, allegedly licensed in 1649. Writers such as James Joyce, Oliver St. John Gogarty and John Elwood were familiar with this tavern.

===18th century===
Portobello was part of the Manor of St. Sepulchre, one of the liberties of Dublin. The courthouse (still standing) and gaol for the use of the manor were located at the corner of Long Lane and New Bride Street.

===19th and 20th centuries===
====The Barracks====

The nearby Portobello Barracks (now Cathal Brugha Barracks) was constructed between 1810 and 1815, and has been in continual use since then.

In 1817, William Windham Sadlier successfully flew in a hot air balloon from Portobello Barracks to Holyhead in North Wales.

The 1837 Ordnance Survey map showed one building on the western side of Richmond St. (excluding property belonging to the Portobello Hotel), which corresponds to no. 34, which was later the Caroline Records shop (closed in 2003).

In 1867, at the time of the Fenian Uprising, security was stepped up, and an innocent young resident of Bloomfield Avenue, walking his dog in the vicinity, was accused of breaking and entry, among other things. Admittedly, he had a hard time explaining away the gun and eighteen bullets he had in his pocket, but he was acquitted of any wrongdoing.

The barracks was the scene of a sensational murder on 27 December 1873, when the body of Gunner Colin Donaldson was found slumped across the bed of Anne Wyndford Marshall, in the apartment she shared with her husband. He had been poisoned with Hydrogen cyanide, which Mrs. Marshall had purchased in Rathmines a few days previously. The inquest on 8 January 1874 heard that Donaldson and Marshall had had disagreements on several occasions but ended up on good terms. Although the evidence was stacked against her, at her trial on 10 February the jury found Mrs. Marshall not guilty.

Portobello Barracks was, up until the 1916 Rising, the home of the 4th Battalion Royal Irish Fusiliers, which was under the command of John Henry Patterson.

The barracks was adopted as General Michael Collins&#x27; Military Headquarters after the Irish War of Independence. The barracks hospital became Collins&#x27; home when he set up his headquarters, it was from here that he set off to Cork, the day he was killed 22 August 1922.

The Dublin section of the Grand Canal was opened on 23 April 1796, while Portobello Harbour came into use in 1801. In 1812 Richmond Basin, Portobello, (later called the &quot;City Basin&quot;), located between Lennox Street and the canal, was opened as a water reservoir for the south side of the city. From 1860 investigations of the water quality coming from the Basin showed that it was not up to standard – in particular, levels of sulphuric acid were relatively high. Public representatives from Rathmines were unwilling to supply the necessary money for new water-works, but the will of the majority prevailed, and the new Vartry Reservoir was completed in 1863.

====Hotel====

The hotel at the harbour, the &quot;Grand Canal Hotel&quot;, was opened in 1807 (the architect was James Colbourne). In 1858, it was taken over by a Catholic order of nuns, who used it as an asylum (St. Mary&#x27;s) for blind girls. A few years later they successfully appealed to the Guardians of the South Dublin Union for some finance (it cost £10 to keep a girl for a year), though &quot;The Irish Times&quot; in an editorial frowned upon this proselytising by &quot;Romanists&quot;, while they lauded the efforts of the Protestant-run &quot;Home for Orphans&quot; at 7 South Richmond Street (which advertised frequently for &quot;fresh souls to save&quot; in the same newspaper).
Ten years later the asylum was sold to a Mr. Isaac Cole, who renovated it and returned it to its original function as a hotel, to accommodate 100 persons. It was popular among officers visiting the nearby Portobello Barracks (who would occasionally pop across South Richmond Street to the Grand Canal Tavern for a drink) and claimed it was the nearest hotel to the Royal Dublin Society grounds. However, it was slow in providing catering facilities – in 1871 a Rathmines businessman, in a letter to the &quot;Irish Times&quot;, lamented the absence of restaurants in the neighbourhood, and enjoined upon Mr. Cole to provide same, preferably a two-course meal for two shillings (the price to include beer and punch). In the 20th century the building became a nursing home.

====Observatory====
Thomas Grubb (1800–1878), a notable optician, developed his first telescope in a small house between Portobello Bridge and Charlemont Bridge and erected a public observatory at No. 1 Upper Charlemont Street. He founded the Grubb Telescope Company. One of his earliest instruments – the telescope for Markree Observatory in County Sligo – was, for several years, the largest telescope in the world. They provided the telescopes for many observatories worldwide, including Melbourne, Vienna and Aldershot Observatory in 1891. The company was acquired in 1925 by Charles Algernon Parsons and renamed Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co. Ltd.

====Development====
Most of the area was developed in the latter half of the 19th century, the houses along the South Circular Road being built between 1850 and 1870, although the smaller houses off Lennox Street were built by the Dublin Artisans&#x27; Dwellings Company sometime later, from 1885 (just in time, in fact, for the increasing number of Jews looking for houses in the area). This company also built houses on that part of Portobello Basin that was filled in 1883.

In 1868, a new street was opened to connect Harold&#x27;s Cross with Lower Clanbrassil Street The Lord Mayor, the Aldermen and Frederick Stokes, who had purchased the land and led the project, attended the opening. The street was to be called Kingsland Street, but in fact, that name was never used, and it became Upper Clanbrassil Street.
===Transport===
From the 1850s, horse-drawn omnibuses provided transport along South Richmond Street from Rathmines to the city centre. On 6 October 1871 work was commenced on the Dublin tram system on Rathmines Road, a few yards from Portobello Bridge. They came into operation the following year, linking Rathgar, via Richmond Street, with College Green. There was just one standard fare within the city limits, which was much cheaper than the old horse-drawn omnibuses. That year also the long-awaited improvements to Portobello Bridge (after the fatal accident of 1861) were carried out, the Tramway Company paying one-third of the total cost of £300.

At the time the trams were introduced an impediment to efficient transport along Richmond Street was the curve in the street at Moyer&#x27;s building works (west corner of Lennox Street, was part of the Portobello College complex until its demolition in 2006). The constant traffic in and out of Moyer&#x27;s blocked the traffic at this narrow spot. Despite complaints, the curve was never removed and is there to this day.
====Portobello Gardens====
Part of Lennox Street, Victoria Street and Florence Street stretching from the canal to the South Circular Road were part of the Kingsland estate, which contained a park with a large pond and fountains, which opened as the Royal Portobello Gardens in 1839. The name survives in Kingsland Park Avenue. From 1858, Mssrs. Kirby and Webb leased the Portobello Gardens. Kirby was a pyrotechnician who lived in Sackville Street. During the summer months, gas and Chinese lamps illuminated the gardens, a band played outdoors, and the public were entertained by acrobats, dancers and &quot;a highly trained troupe of performing dogs&quot;. And of course, fireworks.

In June 1850, the celebrated circus owner and performer, Pablo Fanque (a black man, later immortalised in The Beatles song &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!&quot; written entirely from his circus advertisement) announced that the sponsor of the events at the gardens &quot;has the honor to inform the Nobility, Gentry, and the Public that he has entered into an arrangement with Mr. Pablo Fanque for three Grand Equestrian Day fetes, which will take place on the 10th, 12th, and 14th of June in an immense Pavilion which will be erected for the purpose.&quot; The same advertisements announced performances by R. W. Pelham, the American minstrel.

A huge crowd attraction at the gardens was the well-known tightrope walker Charles Blondin, who first performed at the gardens in August 1860. The previous year he had caused a sensation by crossing the Niagara Falls on a tightrope. In May, at the Crystal Palace, he had carried across a stove on the rope, then, still suspended on the wire, proceeded to cook omelettes, which he distributed to the audience below. On the evening of 23 August 1860, however, as the crowd packed the gardens, the tightrope broke, which led to the supporting scaffolding collapsing. Blondin was not injured, but two workers who were on the scaffolding fell to their deaths. Although they appeared as witnesses at an initial investigation, Blondin and his manager failed to appear at a further one (they were in the USA) and a warrant was issued for their arrest. However, things must have been ironed out, because August of the following year found the &quot;far-famed unambulist performing his arduous and daring exploits&quot; at the gardens, followed by &quot;Madame Veroni&#x27;s magic exploits&quot;.

Meanwhile, the proprietor of the gardens, Kirby, the pyrotechnician, was having problems with a pyromaniac, several attempts having been made on his property. In 1862 Kirby was the victim of arson, both the music hall in the gardens and his house in Sackville Street were burned down, resulting in high claims for compensation. Plans for developing the land at the gardens for housing started around this time. Frederick Stokes, J.P., an Englishman, the main developer of Rathmines and Portobello at the time, and Chairman of the Rathmines Township Commissioners, who drained it and let it out in building lots, purchased the land.

====Kingsland Park====
The original name of Victoria Street was Kingsland Park, which was developed from 1865 by Frederick Stokes. Some of the houses in this street remained empty for some time after they were built and were frequented by &quot;ladies of the night&quot;, who catered to the nearby Portobello Barracks. As a result, the street acquired a bad reputation and respectable families moved out. Even after the ladies moved on, the bad reputation of the street remained, and thus the name was changed to Victoria Street. For a similar reason, Liverpool Road became Portobello Road and Bloomfield Place/Rosanna Place became Windsor Terrace.
====Emorville====
Across the road from Portobello Gardens was the Emorville Estate, which was sold and developed from around the mid-1860s by Joseph Kelly, proprietor of the City Saw Mills in Thomas Street. Today Emorville Avenue marks the spot. Before it was broken up Leinster Cricket Club (founded 1852) used it as their grounds, until they moved to their present grounds in Observatory Lane in 1865. Portobello had a cricket team of its own, but the location of its grounds has yet to be discovered. Included in this development was a small DMP police station at the corner of Emor Street and South Circular Road, which closed after the Free State came into being.

====Street names====
Several older streets in the neighbourhood (i.e., Richmond, Harrington, Lennox, Heytesbury and Camden) were named after British Viceroys. Newer streets were often named after the estates they were built on. Stamer Street, developed around 1880, was named after Sir William Stamer, Lord Mayor in 1809 and 1819 (a relative of his, Standish O&#x27;Grady, was killed in a duel in 1830 by Captain Smith from Portobello Barracks, who received twelve months for manslaughter). Foundlings left at Harrington Street church were usually named after one of the surrounding streets.

Between 1916 and 1921, Portobello and its eponymously named barracks were the scene of several incidents (see Of historical interest).

The main employer locally in the inter-war period and afterwards was Ever-Ready Batteries at Portobello Harbour. The factory is now closed and small businesses and attractive apartments occupy the space. The remainder of Portobello Harbour, located next to the Ever-Ready factory, was drained in 1948 and largely filled in.

In the 1960s, the Garda Club opened in Harrington Street (it is still used for social occasions) and Synge Street School obtained a new building fronting onto Heytesbury Street. The Bleeding Horse pub came under new management, introduced plastic fittings and changed its name to The Falcon.

Starting in the 1980s Kelly&#x27;s Corner was re-developed. Camden Street Old and Charlotte Street disappeared and the ruined buildings there made way for the Camden Court Hotel. The north side of Harcourt Road was developed, Stein&#x27;s Opticians being the last to go in the first phase, and Gleeson&#x27;s pub in the second.

In the 1990s, the east side of Charlemont Street and Grand Parade made way for offices, apartments and the Hilton Hotel. The Falcon was renovated and became again The Bleeding Horse. A few years later the Luas made its appearance on the old Harcourt Street-Bray railway line.

Nowadays community groups meet in St. Kevin&#x27;s Hall, Bloomfield Avenue and Heytesbury Street. A monthly market is held behind the Bernard Shaw pub on Richmond Street.

The reclaimed land at Portobello Harbour is now a leisure area and is often used for skateboarding. Next to it is the private Lamrin Business School, and just around the corner are various shops, pubs and restaurants, giving the locality a lively and vibrant air. South Richmond Street is part of the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; of music venues and bars leading into the city centre.

The Grand Canal received a much-needed restoration in the mid-1980s and again more recently. The canal is still thriving in a leisurely way and now serves as a picturesque amenity much frequented by the local population, not to mention the Corporation swans.
==Little Jerusalem==
The area was also known as Little Jerusalem because in the first half of the twentieth century it was at the heart of the Jewish community in Dublin. The first Jews fleeing conditions in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire) arrived in the early 1870s and eventually settled off Lower Clanbrassil Street.

Over the next few decades as they became more prosperous many moved to the South Circular Road, Longwood Avenue, Bloomfield Avenue (where a Jewish school was opened) and other parts of Portobello. The shopping area of Little Jerusalem stretched along Lower Clanbrassil Street where there were many Jewish shops and businesses, mixed with local Irish, for example Eastman butchers, who carried out the ritual slaughtering until a Jewish slaughterhouse was established in Vincent Street. For a long time local (non-Jewish) children earned their pocket money by lighting fires and doing odd jobs (the Shabbat goy) for the Jews on their Sabbath.

Founder of the well-known family firm, Myer Wigoder was born in Lithuania but had to flee after a pogrom. He started a Hebrew class near Kelly&#x27;s Corner and a synagogue in Camden Street. His son Harry lived at 32 Charlemont Street and was a well-known soccer player. Another son, a doctor, married into the family of dentist Harry/Henry Bradlaw (son of Robert Brudno of Smorgon naturalised as Robert Bradlaw), of 4 Harrington St. Robert Bradlaw became a leader of the community and founded a synagogue in St. Kevin&#x27;s Parade and the cemetery in Dolphin&#x27;s Barn, where he is buried. Also from Lithuania, Ada Shillman came to Dublin in 1892 and became a midwife. She started a dispensary for Jewish women in Bloomfield Avenue and helped found Saint Ultan&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital in Charlemont Street. Her son Bernard became a distinguished Senior Counsel.

In the local elections for Dublin Corporation in 1902, the Socialist candidate James Connolly, standing for Wood Quay ward, was the only candidate to distribute his election leaflets in the area in Yiddish.

The International Tailors, Machinists and Pressers&#x27; Trade Union was founded in November 1908 (and registered in April 1909) by Jewish clothing workers hailing from the South Circular Road area. Its HQ was at 52 Camden Street (located next to the headquarters for Concern Worldwide). Aaron Klein of 14 Warren Street was its first treasurer. A later Secretary was Isaac Baker from Emorville Avenue.

The Jewish presence in the area declined following the end of World War II, with a number of Jews emigrating to Israel, and the majority leaving for New York. Though the main Jewish population that remained in Dublin have moved out to Terenure, just five kilometres (three miles) away, a small number still live in the area, but their own shops, schools, and small businesses no longer exist.

The Irish Jewish Museum is located on Walworth Road. One of the items in the museum includes a Guinness bottle sold in the area with a customised label printed in Hebrew. The long-standing Kosher bakery, the Bretzel, is still in Lennox Street, under new management. In early 2011 the museum launched an appeal for a £9 million expansion of its Walworth Road premises, which was supported by the Office of Public Works.

In 2022, six Stolpersteine commemorating the six Irish Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust were installed as a memorial at St. Catherine&#x27;s National School in memory of Ettie Steinberg, her husband Wojtech Gluck and their son Leon Gluck, murdered in Auschwitz and Isaac Shishi, killed at Viekšniai, Lithuania in 1941; and Ephraim and Jeanne (Lena) Saks (siblings), killed at Auschwitz in 1944. They had moved to continental Europe before the outbreak of World War II.

During the 1916 Easter Rising, several Jewish women from the community smuggled ammunition from Portobello, Dublin&#x27;s Jewish quarter, to the then-named Sackville Street, where the rebels occupied the General Post Office and other strategic buildings. Most notable of these women was the artist Estella Solomons, who used to hide ammunition under a vegetable patch at the back of her family home. The Cumann na mBan women worked as agents transferring ammunition, able to avoid detection at that time precisely because they were women.

==Institutions==
The main school in the area is Synge Street CBS, which was the setting for the award-winning 2016 film, &quot;Sing Street&quot;. The movie, directed by John Carney (director), was mostly made in Dublin, including in areas around Portobello like the Catholic Church in Harrington Street (St. Kevin&#x27;s), named after the nearby St. Kevin&#x27;s medieval church. The school was built next to the Christian Brothers monastery in 1871. On the other side of Synge Street is St. Kevin&#x27;s Hall, which used to be the meeting place for the Catholic Boy Scouts and Girl Guides.

There used to be a Jewish school in Bloomfield Avenue (now Bloomfield House) and synagogues in Walworth Road (established 1917, now the Jewish Museum) and in Adelaide Road, but these are all closed now (new facilities have been set up elsewhere). On Adelaide Road a Presbyterian Church (still functioning) was built in 1841 for a congregation of 800, and in 1863 a smaller chapel for the Irvingites, which later became St. Finian&#x27;s Lutheran church (also still functioning). 
The many Muslims now living in the area attend the Dublin Mosque (formerly the Donore Presbyterian Church, built 1884) further along the South Circular Road, and there is also a centre in Harrington Street. The local Church of Ireland church, St. Kevin&#x27;s (whose construction, in 1883, was financed by a bequest from a Miss Jane Shannon, of Rathgar, architect, Thomas Drew), was closed in the 1970s and tastefully converted to apartments, while the adjacent church buildings became a community centre. The little church at the top of Victoria Street formerly belonged to the Methodist Congregation, called Kingsland Methodist Church, and after closing in the 1950s was used as a women&#x27;s Employment Exchange. The Methodists also ran the Female Orphanage School in Harrington St., which was founded in 1804 and closed in the mid-20th century.

Portobello College was a private institution established in 1989 and located mainly in Portobello House. It was firstly taken over by the Institute of Education (under owner Raymond Kearns) and then in 2009 by the Dublin Business School (owned by Kaplan, Inc., a subsidiary of The Washington Post Company). The students were relocated to the DBS facility in George&#x27;s St. In 2011, one of India&#x27;s largest educational institutions, the Rayat Bahra Group, moved into nearby Harbour House, once a part of Portobello College, and set up the Lamrin Business School.

In 2009, a new national and cultural centre was opened in the Christian Brothers monastery on Synge St. called The Lantern, which aims to be a place of hospitality to promote intercultural and interfaith dialogue. The name &quot;lantern&quot; was chosen to celebrate the life of Nano Nagle, who searched the back lanes of Cork each evening with her lantern seeking those who lacked food and shelter. She inspired Edmund Ignatius Rice to found the Congregation of Christian Brothers and the Presentation Brothers with her work for the poor and disadvantaged.

In May 2011, the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, Alan Shatter opened a Cathal Brugha Barracks Visitors centre to the public commemorating those that fought for the Irish War of Independence.

==Notable residents==
The earliest written accounts we have of residents in the area date from the 18th century—as the city spread southwards houses on the main roads or in select by-roads such as Charlemont Mall were occupied by the better-off citizens. This trend continued in the first half of the 19th century, but with the development of the smaller streets from around 1860 and finally the artisans&#x27; dwellings, a mix of classes ended up in the area. By the beginning of the 20th century, the grand houses that had been erected along the Grand Canal had been turned into poverty-stricken tenements, while more exclusive suburbs such as Terenure and Rathgar became the havens of the rich. The following list shows the range of people that have been associated with the area over the past 200 years.

===1861: A terrible tragedy at Portobello Bridge===
At 9 o&#x27;clock on the evening of Saturday, 6 April 1861 near Portobello Bridge, a horse-drawn bus, driven by Patrick Hardy, had just dropped off a passenger and started up the steep incline of the bridge when one of the horses started to rear. The driver tried to turn the horses but both horses became uncontrollable with fear and backed the bus through the wooden rails of the bridge. The bus, horses and six passengers inside the bus, plunged into the dark cold waters of the canal lock, which was about 6 metres (20 feet) deep, with 3 metres (10 feet) of water at the bottom. The conductor was able to jump clear and a passing policeman pulled the driver from the water. Despite the frantic efforts of passers-by, in particular, a constable and a soldier from Portobello Barracks who broke their way into the submerged bus, all inside were drowned. One of those killed was the father of the Gunne brothers, who opened the Gaiety Theatre. Two were mothers, each with a little girl, one of them a niece of Daniel O&#x27;Connell.

The repercussions of this tragedy were felt for a long time in the area. Passengers on horse-drawn vehicles had to alight at Portobello Bridge and walk across the bridge before continuing their journey. According to some accounts, on the night of the accident a brilliant light was seen to rise from the canal water and turn into a human shape. They say the ghost of a lock-keeper, who drowned himself after being sacked for drunkenness, was to blame for the tragedy.

===1914: Pork butchers attack===
During the evening of 15 August 1914, a series of anti-German attacks took place in the city by pro-Allied or British sympathizers – also known commonly as &quot;Redmonites&quot; during World War I. One of the most shocking was George Reitz Pork butchers at Leonard&#x27;s Corner on the South Circular Road, Portobello. The mob was reportedly led by a newly enlisted soldier. The fullest account of the attack on George Reitz&#x27;s premises appeared in the &quot;Irish Worker&quot; on 22 August 1914. Under the heading of &quot;German Baiting: The Police Cowardice&quot; the correspondent described the scene. Having first arrested Reitz himself, the Dublin Metropolitan Police then left his premises unprotected and allowed the mob to proceed unhindered in destroying that shop and robbing its contents. Meanwhile, the DMP themselves stood &quot;idly by&quot; and laughed away the night as they observed the &quot;sport&quot;. The Irish Citizen Army feared that the Jewish shops adjacent to Reitz&#x27;s would be the next targets for the mob.

===1916: A terse reply===
During the Easter Rising in 1916, the Irish Citizen Army sent a group of men to seize a delaying position at Portobello Bridge, to allow fortifications to be constructed in the city centre. They were led by a James Joyce (not the author) who worked in Davy&#x27;s Bar near the bridge – the bar was to be used as a military outpost. When his unit burst in, Davy, the bar owner, sacked Joyce, giving him one week&#x27;s notice. Joyce then told Davy he had five minutes to get out.

===1916: Murder of Sheehy-Skeffington===
Also during the Easter Rising, members of the British 11th East Surrey Regiment at Portobello Bridge arrested the pacifist Francis Sheehy-Skeffington on 25 April because his name was &#x27;on a list&#x27;, as he returned to his home in Rathmines from touring the city pasting up leaflets calling people to a meeting to form groups to stop looting of property by slum-dwellers. He was taken to Portobello Barracks, where he was held as an enemy sympathiser. Later that evening, he was taken out as a hostage with a raiding party led by Captain J.C. Bowen-Colthurst of the Royal Irish Rifles, to the home and shop of Alderman James Kelly, at the corner of Camden Street and Harcourt Road (from which the name &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Corner&quot; derives). Mistaking the Alderman (a conservative) for a different Alderman Kelly, the soldiers arrested two men who were there, gutter journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick McIntyre, then destroyed the shop with hand grenades. On the way back to Rathmines, Bowen-Colthurst and his party murdered two unarmed civilians, one of them a 17-year-old boy from Mount Pleasant Avenue returning from Rathmines church.

The following morning Bowen-Colthurst – an Anglo-Irish ultra-loyalist who was a scion of Dripsey Castle in Cork, and a cousin of the writer Elizabeth Bowen, ordered his sergeant to organise a firing squad to shoot dead Sheehy-Skeffington and the two pro-British journalists Dickson (a disabled Scotsman) and McIntyre. The three were shot in the back as they walked towards a wall in the barracks yard, then buried in shallow graves in the same yard. The British authorities tried to hush up the killings, and offered Bowen-Colthurst command of a regiment in Newry.

Sir Francis Fletcher-Vane, an officer in Portobello Barracks, tried to have Bowen-Colthurst arrested for murder, and was himself then dishonourably discharged from the army (as the Public Records Office nicely put it: &quot;this officer was relegated to unemployment owing to his action in the Skeffington murder case in the Sinn Féin rebellion&quot;).

Bowen-Colthurst pleaded insanity at a later investigation and was sent to the mental health facility at Holloway (HM Prison), from where he was quietly released 18 months later. He then emigrated to Canada, where he lived for the rest of his life.

===1920: Dead and wounded after riot in Richmond Street===
On 22 March 1920, an incident, typical of the time, occurred in the area. A large group of British soldiers of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, were returning, singing, to Portobello Barracks after a night out on the town. They started jostling pedestrians in Grafton Street and hissed the Sinn Féin bank in Harcourt Street. At Kelly&#x27;s Corner, a crowd gathered and attacked them with stones. By the time they reached Lennox Street gunfire had broken out, one soldier being shot in the chest. A running fight along the street developed until armed reinforcements arrived from the barracks. Gunfire broke out between the two sides, and the soldiers forced the crowd back towards Camden Street, firing at them when they did not obey the command to disperse. A van driver and a female domestic were killed, and many were injured.

===1920: Shooting of Harry Kells===
On 15 April 1920 parts of Portobello, including the &quot;Jewish quarters&quot;, were subject to the largest raid ever carried out by British troops in Dublin. This was due to the shooting on the previous day of Detective Constable Harry Kells, of the DMP G Division, in Camden St. He was rushed to the Meath Hospital where he died. Harry Kells lived at 7 Pleasants St. and had been carrying out identity parades among the many republican inmates in Mountjoy Prison. Two of those sought were Sinn Féin members Michael and William Kavanagh who lived at 5 Pleasants St., who had previously been &quot;fingered&quot; by Kells, and it was thought they would seek refuge among friends in the neighbourhood. Over 100 people were arrested that day.

===1922: Trial of Erskine Childers, Portobello Barracks===
In November 1922 Erskine Childers was arrested by Irish Free State troops, and he was transferred from a Wicklow Jail to Portobello Barracks in Dublin where he was brutally tortured. On 17 November, he was Court Martialled on a charge of possession of a revolver given to him by Michael Collins, he had since they were both on the same side, prior to the Irish Civil War. He was consequently sentenced to death at Beggars Bush. His execution brought widespread condemnation at home and abroad, it was the result of a draconian emergency act introduced by the Irish Free State government, the death sentence for anyone caught armed without authorization.

===1923: Stamer Street Shooting===
On the night of 14 November 1923, two Jewish men were shot, one of whom Emmanuel Kahn, 24, of Lennox Street died, at the corner of Stamer St./Lennox St. They were returning home from the Jewish Social Club, which was located at 3 Harrington St. The shooting followed an altercation on Stamer St. with officers of the Irish National Army, who had been on their way by taxi from Griffith Barracks to Beggar&#x27;s Bush Barracks. Ralph Laffan, the taxi driver that night, was charged with the murder, but fled to Mexico to join his brother Fred, who had also been involved that night. He claimed he was mistaken for his brother and was later found not guilty. The apparently motiveless murders remained a mystery until files released in 2007 pointed to Commandant James Patrick Conroy, who harboured a personal vendetta against Jews, as the main instigator. He resigned from the army shortly after the shooting and emigrated.

===1966: Nelson&#x27;s head goes missing from a Clanbrassil Street shed===
In 1966 a group of students from National College of Art and Design stole the head of lord Nelson&#x27;s Pillar, which had been blown up by Irish nationalists in March 1966. The head had been stored in a shed off Clanbrassil Street by Dublin City Corporation. The students broke into the shed, put the head in the back of a hatchback and made off with it. The head later appeared in numerous locations most notably the set of a Dubliners concert and also in a London antique shop close to Trafalgar Square where the other pillar is located.

==Literary references==
&quot;I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker.&quot; &quot;Ulysses&quot;, Chapter 16, &quot;Eumaeus&quot; episode, James Joyce.

A story by Brian J. Showers called &quot;Favourite No. 7 Omnibus&quot;, which can be found in the collection &quot;The Bleeding Horse and Other Ghost Stories&quot;, is a fictionalisation of an accident on the bridge between Portobello and Rathmines where a number of passengers on a Number 7 omnibus drowned in the Grand Canal. According to another story in the book, the Bleeding Horse pub is haunted by a spectral horse that died in the Battle of Rathmines. The story &quot;Quis Separabit&quot; is about the former Blackberry Fair in Rathmines, which is said to be haunted by the notorious Blackberry Man. The stories in Showers&#x27; collection, while drawing on facts from the histories of both Portobello and Rathmines, are largely works of fiction.

<text>Armageddon 2419 A.D. is a science fiction novella by Philip Francis Nowlan that first appeared in the August 1928 issue of the pulp magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. A sequel called &quot;The Airlords of Han&quot; was published in the March 1929 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Both stories are now in the public domain in the U.S. In the 1960s, Nowlan&#x27;s two novellas were combined by editor Donald A. Wollheim into one paperback novel, titled &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; 

==Overview==
Nowlan&#x27;s novella tells about the United States in the 25th century, conquered by Hans in 2109 AD and only now beginning to rebel. Sometime after World War I, nearly all the European powers joined forces against the United States. Although the U.S. won the war, both sides were devastated by the conflict. Taking advantage of the chaos that followed, the &quot;Russian Soviets&quot; (Soviet Union) joined forces with the &quot;Mongolians&quot; to take over Europe. The U.S. collapsed economically and stagnated while the Hans turned against the Russians and defeated them as part of their campaign of world conquest.

American efforts to avoid war with the Hans failed, and in 2109 AD, the latter attacked the US using fleets of airships armed with disintegrator rays. They attacked from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and down from Canada. After conquering the U.S. and Canada, these &quot;Airlords of Han&quot; ruled North America as a province of the world empire, from 15 great cities they established across the continent. They ignored the Americans, who were left to fend for themselves in the forests and mountains as the Hans&#x27; advanced technology prevented the need for slave labor. From time to time, they raid American land &quot;to keep the &#x27;wild&#x27; Americans on the run within the shelter of their forests, and prevent their becoming a menace to the Han civilization.&quot;

Living in cooperative gangs and hiding in the forests from the Hans, Americans secretly rebuild their civilization and develop the new technologies &quot;inertron&quot; and &quot;ultron&quot;. Inertron is a substance with &quot;reverse weight&quot; (anti-gravitational properties), so that a person carrying an amount of inertron equal to most of his weight (in the form of a &quot;jumper&quot; – &quot;rocket motors encased in inertron blocks and strapped to the back&quot;) can travel rapidly across country in long leaps. Ultron, in turn, is an &quot;absolutely invisible and non-reflective solid of great molecular density and moderate elasticity, which has the property of being 100 percent conductive to those pulsations known as light, electricity and heat.&quot; The Americans use these technologies, as well as explosive rockets and radio frequencies the enemy cannot detect, in their struggle with the Hans.

==Plot summary==
The main character and the narrator in &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; is Anthony Rogers. Rogers recounts the events of the &quot;Second War of Independence&quot; that precedes the first victory of Americans over Hans, in which he plays an important role. Born in 1898, he was a veteran of the Great War (World War I) and was by 1927 working for the American Radioactive Gas Corporation. He was investigating reports of unusual phenomena in abandoned coal mines near Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania. On December 15, while investigating one of the lower levels of a mine, there was a cave-in. Exposed to radioactive gas, Rogers fell into &quot;a state of suspended animation, free from the ravages of katabolic processes, and without any apparent effect on physical or mental faculties.&quot; Rogers remained in &quot;sleep&quot; for 492 years.

He awakens in 2419 and, thinking he has been asleep for just several hours, wanders for a few days in unfamiliar forests (what had been Pennsylvania almost five centuries before). He finally notices a wounded boy-like figure, clad in strange clothes and moving in giant leaps, who appears to be under attack by others. He defends the person, killing one of the attackers and scaring off the rest. It turns out that he is helping a woman, Wilma Deering, who, on &quot;air patrol&quot;, was attacked by an enemy gang, the &quot;Bad Bloods&quot;, which is presumed to have allied themselves with the Hans.

Wilma takes Rogers to her camp, where he is to meet the bosses of her gang. He is invited to either stay with their gang or leave and visit other gangs. They hope Rogers&#x27; experience and the knowledge he gained fighting in the First World War may be useful in their struggle with the Hans.

Rogers stays with the gang for several days, learns about the community life of Americans in the 25th century, and makes friends with the people, especially with Wilma, with whom he spends a lot of time. He also experiences a Han air raid, during which he manages to destroy one of the enemy ships. Rogers and his friends hurry to the bosses to report the incident and explain the method he has used when shooting the aircraft. As the raid has caused much destruction, there is suspicion that the location of the gang&#x27;s industrial plants may have been revealed to the Hans by rival gangs. They await a fight with the Hans who will likely wish to take revenge for the destruction of their airship.

The bosses direct Wilma and Rogers to investigate the wreck. While there, a Han party arrives to investigate as well. Thanks to Rogers&#x27; quick and wise instructions, he and Wilma manage to escape and shoot down some more of the Hans&#x27; ships. The day after, Wilma and Anthony get married, and Rogers becomes a member of the gang. In the meantime, knowing Rogers&#x27; technique, the other gangs start the hunt for Han ships. The Hans respond by improving the security of their ships, forcing the Americans to develop new tactics to press their sudden advantage and identify the traitors working with the Han.

Anthony develops a plan to get the records of the traitorous transaction, which are kept somewhere in the Han city of Nu-Yok. With the help of other gangs, he creates a team that will go with him. They learn that the traitors are the Sinsings, the gang located not far from Nu-Yok.

The Americans appreciate Rogers&#x27; courage and brave deeds and, grateful to him, make him the new boss. He instantly reorganizes the governing structures of the gang by creating new offices and makes plans for the battle with the Sinsings, again using the knowledge he gained in the First World War. The raid on the Sinsings turns out to be a great success and gives the Americans confidence in their ability to overcome the Hans.

==Allusions/references from other works/sequels==

The history leading to the situation which Rogers finds upon waking—the US weakened by a war with Europe and then conquered by overwhelming Han fleets of airships—has some similarities with H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War in the Air&quot; (written in four months in 1907 and serialised and published in 1908, in &quot;The Pall Mall Magazine&quot;), already a classic at the time when &quot;Armageddon&quot; was written. In Wells&#x27; novel, the United States is attacked by Imperial Germany, New York is destroyed by the Germans, and though the Americans manage to fight off the German attack, they are then overwhelmed by enormous Sino-Japanese air fleets.

After &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; was published, John F. Dille, the head of the National Newspaper Service, which syndicated comics and features, read Nowlan&#x27;s novella, sought out Nowlan to produce a syndicated column in strip form, &quot;A story in strip form of conditions in America some five hundred years hence.&quot; The comic strip character was named Buck Rogers, and artist Dick Calkins was hired to do the illustrations.

The story of the comic strip diverges from the novel after the first few strips and never returns to it. While &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; heavily emphasizes war, military tactics and technology, the Buck Rogers comic strip is based on adventures and romantic problems. The book features lethal violence and gore, while the comic strip does not. The entire &quot;occupied America&quot; theme of the original book was tacitly dropped, and the United States in which the comic strip Buck Rogers lives seems a direct continuation of the present-day one, which had not undergone centuries of Han occupation.

While it sometimes claimed that they introduced the idea of &quot;personal flight&quot; with the use of devices attached to the body, this idea is based on the fact that a flying man is depicted on the cover of the August 1928 issue of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, which included the first part of &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; In fact the cover illustrates E. E. Smith&#x27;s serial &quot;The Skylark of Space&quot;, which began in the same issue. &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; features anti-gravity belts that allow the wearer to leap for remarkable distances, but do not permit indefinite flight.

Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;The Moon Maid&quot; saga has some similarities to &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot;, in which American &quot;tribes&quot; rebel against Moon people who have previously conquered the world.

In the 1980s the original &quot;Armageddon 2419 A.D.&quot; was taken up again and authorized sequels to it were written by other authors working from an outline co-written by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle and loosely tied-in with their bestseller &quot;Lucifer&#x27;s Hammer&quot; (1977). The first sequel begins c. 2476 A.D., when a widowed and cantankerous 86-year-old Anthony Rogers is mysteriously rejuvenated during a resurgence of the presumed-extinct Han, now called the Pr&#x27;lan. The novels include:

* &quot;Mordred&quot; by John Eric Holmes (Ace, January 1981, )
* &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Blood&quot; by Richard S. McEnroe (Ace, January 1981, )
* &quot;Warrior&#x27;s World&quot; by Richard S. McEnroe (Ace, October 1981, )
* &quot;Rogers&#x27; Rangers&quot; by John Silbersack (Ace, August 1983, )

<text>The [[North Ossetia–Alania|Republic of North Ossetia – Alania]] is a federal subject of Russia (a republic), located in the Caucasus region.

==Early history==

The territory of North Ossetia has been inhabited for thousands of years, being both a very fertile agricultural region and a key trade route through the Caucasus Mountains. The ancestors of the present inhabitants were a people called the Alans, a warlike nomadic people who spoke an Iranian language. The First Iranian-speaking tribes appeared in the Caucasus in the 7th century BC. By about the 9th century, the kingdom of Alania had arisen and had been converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries. An archbishopric was established in western Alania under the authority of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and many large churches were constructed (Zelenchuk churches, Shoana Church, Senty Church). Alania became a powerful state in the Caucasus, profiting greatly from the legendary Silk Road to China, which passed through its territory.

From the Middle Ages onwards, Alania was beset by external enemies and suffered repeated invasions. The invasions of the Mongols and Tatars in the 13th century decimated the population, who were now known as Ossetians. Islam was introduced in the 17th century through the Kabardians, a Muslim Caucasian people. Incursions by the Khanate of Crimea and the Ottoman Empire eventually pushed Alania/Ossetia into an alliance with Russia in the 18th century. North Ossetia was among the first areas of the northern Caucasus to come under Russian domination, starting in 1774, and the capital, Vladikavkaz, was the first Russian military outpost in the region. Ossetians in the South Caucasus often committed robberies in Kartli, until 1830, when Ossetia came under Russian control.

==Imperial Russia==
The arrival of Imperial Russia led to the rapid development of the region, with industries founded and road and rail connections built to overcome Ossetia&#x27;s isolation. The Georgian Military Road, which is still a crucial transport link across the mountains, was built in 1799 and a railway line was built from Vladikavkaz to Rostov-on-Don in Russia proper. The Ossetians&#x27; traditional culture inevitably underwent some Russification, but their new connections with Russia and the West helped to boost local culture; the first books in the Ossetian language were printed in the late 18th century. In 1830, a military campaign led by General Ivan Abkhazov brought North Ossetia under tighter control of the Russian Empire. The area became part of the Terskaya Region of Russia in the mid-19th century.

==Russian Revolution and USSR==
After the Russian Revolution, North Ossetia became part of the short-lived Soviet Mountain Republic in 1921. It became the North Ossetian Autonomous Oblast on July 7, 1924 and was then made the North Ossetian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (ASSR), within the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic, on December 5, 1936. In World War II, North Ossetia saw the high-water mark of the invasion of Russia by Nazi Germany; the Germans attempted to seize Vladikavkaz in November 1942 but were repulsed.

During and after the war Stalin undertook massive deportations of whole ethnicities explaining this by anti-Sovietism, separatism and collaboration with Nazi Germany. In particular, this affected Balkars, Chechens, and Ingushs. As of 1944, the part of the Prigorodny District on the right bank of the Terek River had been part of Chechen-Ingush ASSR, but it was granted to North Ossetia in following Joseph Stalin&#x27;s deportation of the Chechens and Ingush to Central Asia. Although they were eventually allowed to return from the exile, they were generally not allowed to settle in the original territories. Instead, in 1957, three districts of Stavropol Krai were granted to Chechen-Ingush ASSR. A local law passed in 1982 actually prohibited ethnic Ingush from obtaining residency permits in North Ossetia.

==After the USSR==

North Ossetian SSR finally became the first autonomous republic of the RSFSR to declare national sovereignty, on June 20, 1990 (although it still remains firmly part of Russia). In 1991, North Ossetian SSR was renamed the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union posed particular problems for the Ossetian people, which were divided between North Ossetia, which was part of the Russian SFSR, and South Ossetia, part of the Georgian SSR. In December 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Georgia abolished the autonomous Ossetian enclave amid the rising ethnic tensions in the region, and much of the population fled across the border to North Ossetia or Georgia proper. Some 70,000 South Ossetian refugees were resettled in North Ossetia, sparking clashes with the predominantly Ingush population in the Prigorodny District. That led to Ossetian-Ingush conflict.

As well as dealing with the effects of the conflict in South Ossetia, North Ossetia has had to deal with refugees and the occasional spillover of fighting from the war in neighboring Chechnya. The bloodiest incident by far was the September 2004 Beslan hostage crisis, in which Muslim separatists of Shamil Basayev seized control of a school. In the firefight between the terrorists and Russian forces that ended the crisis, 335 civilians, the majority of them children, died.

<text>The import scene, also known as the import racing scene or tuner scene, is a subculture of modifying mostly Japanese-import cars, particularly in the United States and Europe.

==History==
Car modifying has been popular among youths in the US, especially in Southern California, since the days of hot rods in the 1950s and 1960s and muscle cars in the 1970s. There is significant evidence indicating that import drag racing first started in Southern California in the mid-1960s, with modified Volkswagen Beetles, Ford Populars and Austin A40 Devons: Documentation of quarter-mile passes were published in &quot;Hot Rod Magazine&quot; as early as August 1965.

Puerto Rico also has a history of pioneering import drag racing in the mid-&#x27;70s and -&#x27;80s, and it is still a popular hobby on the island.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Japanese vehicles, mostly early smaller Hondas (Civic, Prelude), Toyotas (Celica, Corolla, Supra), Nissans (Datsun 510) and Mazdas (RX-2, RX-3) gained popularity in Southern California. To be more precise, within the city of &quot;Gardena&quot; at a parking lot (location) for then what was called &quot;Meiji (Japanese) Market or Meiji Market Plaza&quot; along with a line of other authentic Japanese retailers serving the largely Japanese communities of Gardena, Torrance, and Palos Verdes was to become the &quot; 1st known and established Weekend late-night meet-up location.&quot; 

The Young Asian-Americans and first generation &quot;Issei&quot; Japanese street racers from Japan and Okinawa played a particularly important role in the development of the early street racing scene. Many enthusiasts in southern California centered around the City of Gardena also began to modify their compact Japanese cars, following similar trends that originated in Japan, such as the paint schemes, modified exhausts, and engine carburation. As the import racers and car aesthetics grew in popularity and numbers, so did the competition. Meiji Market&#x27;s parking lot became very well known outside the original Japanese car crews and this attracted more outsiders to visit, as well as American Car race Crews to appear. Non-Japanese automobile racers &amp; car clubs started to appear from far outside the Gardena, Torrance, &amp; South Bay communities and in approx. by around 1983 to 1986.In 1973, the Japanese issei began to bring the style of Japanese styled cars over to the U.S.
Cars such as the Datsun 510, Toyota Corolla, and the Honda Civic along with other modified vehicles.The import scene grew exponentially in the 1990s and 2000s with more Japanese imports internationally, better performance, and media and cultural influences such as the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; film series and &quot;Need for Speed&quot; video games. 
Street Import racing venues and street meet-up locations in nearby cities such as Carson, Ca. and Long Beach, Ca. eventually arose from the original Meiji Market Location, and then came huge drag racing events at Palmdale, California often packed in over 10,000 spectators per day. Racers like Stephan Papadakis, Ed Bergenholtz, Myles Bautista, Lisa Kubo, and Eric Sebastian on the West Coast dominated the first import drag racing circuit IDRC (Battle of the Imports) in the mid 1990s. Show car clubs became a huge factor within the import scene: Southern California had Team Macross 7, Team Outkast, Team Kosoku, Northern California had SVP, Sinister Racing, Team Flipspeed, Team Light*Speed Racing. in the East Coast (New Jersey, Toronto). In the South, Team Himitsujigen and Team Dangerous (Texas) and Team Hawaii had Midnight Racing and Alpha Project which won numerous car shows all over the island of Oahu. Special thanks to the crews at Distinctive, GX Auto, Progressive Auto Sounds, P.A.T.S, Sonic Motorsports, Midnight Tinting, Kaizo Speed Gear, Architechs, Hypersports Racing, Speedline, HDS, Hawaii Raceway Park and AugustKinetics. Guam had teams like Lowered 2 Perfection and Toys R Us, while the East Coast had the still-active Jade Crew.

The Japanese racing scene can be seen in the anime series &quot;Initial D&quot;, which focuses mainly on mountain pass-racing and &quot;Wangan Midnight&quot; which deals with high-speed expressway racing.

<text>Lawrence Henry Gowan (born 22 November 1956) is a Scottish born Canadian singer and keyboardist. Gowan is a solo artist and has also been vocalist and keyboardist of the band Styx since May 1999. His musical style is usually classified in the categories of pop and progressive rock.

==Early life==
Born in Glasgow, Scotland, he and his family emigrated to Canada where he was raised in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough, Ontario.

==Career==
At the age of 19, he earned an ARCT in classical piano performance from The Royal Conservatory of Music, in Toronto, Ontario. Upon graduation, he enjoyed modest local success with the band Rheingold in 1976.

After the band broke up five years later, Gowan began a solo career under the stage name Gowan, releasing his first album under that name in 1982, which was produced by Rob Freeman and featured Kim Mitchell of Max Webster on guitar. This album contained the singles &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Give In&quot; and &quot;Keep Up the Fight&quot;.

After his 1982 debut album &quot;Gowan&quot; did not fare well, Gowan &quot;found himself naturally gravitating&quot; to the Queen Street West music scene that was developing in Toronto in the mid-1980s. Still signed to Columbia Records, the label agreed to fund his next album. Gowan spent a year writing songs, and also travelled to Scotland and Ireland to trace his heritage. While there, he received a telephone call from English record producer David Tickle, who said he would produce the album and arranged a recording session. Tickle secured the services of several session musicians from the backing band of Peter Gabriel for the recording session, including bassist Tony Levin, drummer Jerry Marotta, and guitarist David Rhodes. The album &quot;Strange Animal&quot; was recorded at Startling Studios owned by Ringo Starr and was his commercial breakthrough in Canada. The album spawned the hit singles &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot;, &quot;(You&#x27;re a) Strange Animal&quot;, &quot;Guerilla Soldier&quot; and &quot;Cosmetics&quot;. That year he won a CASBY Award for most promising male artist.

His 1987 follow up &quot;Great Dirty World&quot; gave him another hit single with &quot;Moonlight Desires&quot;, featuring Jon Anderson (from Yes) on backing vocals, as well as &quot;Dedication&quot;.
Although he was very successful in Canada, all three of Gowan&#x27;s albums had been issued in the US to virtually no attention, and he was dropped by Columbia Records. 1990&#x27;s &quot;Lost Brotherhood&quot;, recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario, had a harder rock sound, and featured such players as Red Rider member Ken Greer, former Coney Hatch guitarist Steve Shelski and Rush&#x27;s Alex Lifeson. It produced the singles &quot;Lost Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;All the Lovers in the World&quot;, and &quot;Out of a Deeper Hunger&quot;. This was Gowan&#x27;s first album for Anthem Records.

A few bars from &quot;The Dragon&quot; can be heard playing on a car radio in the 1990 movie &quot;Navy Seals&quot; and appears on the original motion picture soundtrack.

He released the more acoustic &quot;...But You Can Call Me Larry&quot; in 1993 under his full name, returning to the Canadian pop charts with &quot;When There&#x27;s Time for Love&quot;, &quot;Soul&#x27;s Road&quot; and &quot;Dancing on My Own Ground&quot;. International success was not forthcoming, though, and Anthem dropped Gowan from their roster. He subsequently released &quot;The Good Catches Up&quot; independently in 1995, which featured the single &quot;Guns and God&quot;, which received moderate airplay in Canada. Also that same year, Gowan was part of an all-star lineup at Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall to celebrate Ronnie Hawkins&#x27; 60th birthday, as documented on the album &quot;Let It Rock&quot;, sharing the stage with veteran rockers Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins and The Band. In 1997, Gowan released two live CDs: &quot;Sololive – No Kilt Tonight&quot; containing a rendition of Ragtime&#x27;s classic &quot;King Chanticleer Rag&quot;, and &quot;Au Québec&quot; with a cover of Harmonium&#x27;s &quot;Pour un instant&quot; as well as his first composition in French, &quot;Stéphanie&quot;, for his fan base in Quebec.

In 1997, Gowan released &quot;Healing Waters&quot; as a tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales after her death. &quot;Healing Waters&quot; was initially an unreleased song from Gowan, though it was used in its original form in the 1996 Jeff Wincott movie, &quot;When the Bullet Hits the Bone&quot;.

In 1998, Gowan was the recipient of the National Achievement Award at the annual SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

His song &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot; was covered in 2005 by Canadian hip-hop artist Maestro; Gowan appears in the video and his vocals are sampled on the track. The song was also covered by Canadian gypsy jazz music group The Lost Fingers. The song was sampled in a song performed by Akon and Freck Billionaire.
He also guest-starred on the Canadian animated comedy series &quot;Chilly Beach&quot;.

In February 2006, Gowan did four orchestra-accompanied concerts in London, Ontario and Kitchener, Ontario. Also in 2006, his home was featured on MTV&#x27;s Cribs.

In March 2010, Gowan released &quot;Return of the Strange Animal&quot;, a remastered version of 1985&#x27;s &quot;Strange Animal&quot; plus a making-of documentary and music videos on DVD. In May 2010, Gowan performed two solo shows in support of the 25th anniversary of the &quot;Strange Animal&quot; album.

In May 2012, Gowan re-issued a remastered version of 1987&#x27;s &quot;Great Dirty World&quot;.

As of 2012, Gowan was recording a new solo album which he hoped to have completed sometime in 2013, but has yet to be released.

Gowan acquired the master tapes to his catalogue from CBS Records International in the 2010s, and assigned them to Linus Entertainment under the True North Records label.

On 11 October 2012, Gowan appeared on episode 29 of &quot;John Wants Answers&quot;.

On 13 October 2013, Gowan played a solo concert, titled &#x27;In Kilt Tonight&#x27; at the Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. All proceeds were donated to McDermott House Canada, a charitable organization.

==Styx==

In 1997, during Styx&#x27;s tour, Gowan performed as a supporting act for Styx at Montreal&#x27;s Molson Centre and Quebec City&#x27;s Colisée.

Tommy Shaw admired his talent and vibrant stage charisma, and called him in May 1999 asking him to tour with them for 53 dates, temporarily replacing their lead singer Dennis DeYoung who had fallen ill. Gowan permanently replaced the lead singer after the tour. Since then, Gowan&#x27;s classic hit, &quot;A Criminal Mind&quot;, is often played by Styx.

Styx had long been plagued by differences in artistic inclination. DeYoung&#x27;s absence created an opportunity for a more permanent restructuring of Styx. Gowan subsequently became the band&#x27;s permanent vocalist.

Styx&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Cyclorama&quot; was Gowan&#x27;s first studio album with the band. Gowan sings two songs on &quot;Cyclorama&quot;, &quot;Fields of the Brave&quot; and &quot;More Love for the Money&quot;, both of which have an easily recognizable Gowan signature. He then continued recording with Styx for their 2005 album, &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot;. Although praised by fans, the album sold few copies.

Gowan continues with Styx to the present and is featured on many live releases from the band. The band released studio recordings of older Styx songs with the new line-up, titled &quot;Regeneration&quot; (released in two volumes in 2010 and 2011), and Gowan sings lead vocals on several tracks that were originally recorded by Dennis DeYoung.

In May 2017, Styx announced their new album &quot;The Mission&quot; and revealed the first single &quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot; featuring Gowan on lead vocals. Unfortunately, it received little airplay in the U.S. and did not chart. On the album, Gowan also does lead vocals for &quot;The Greater Good&quot;, &quot;Time May Bend&quot;, and &quot;The Outpost&quot;. He also composed an instrumental piece called &quot;Khedive&quot;.. Both albums were critically praised, but sold few copies and did not chart any singles.

<text>Robert George Schimmel (January 16, 1950 – September 3, 2010) was an American stand-up comedian who was known for his blue comedy. While the extremely profane nature of his act limited his commercial appeal, he had a reputation as a &quot;comic&#x27;s comic&quot; due to his relentless touring, comedy albums and frequent appearances on HBO and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. Schimmel is number 76 on the 2004 program &quot;Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time&quot;.

== Early life and career ==
Schimmel was born in the Bronx, New York City, the son of Betty and Otto Schimmel, Jewish survivors of the Holocaust. He was voted class clown during high school and was in the United States Air Force for one year during the Vietnam War era. In 1980 he was living in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he was working as a stereo salesman. His career began when, at the urging of his sister, he performed at a comedy club&#x27;s open-mic night. A club owner in Los Angeles offered to make him a regular, but when Schimmel moved there he found that the club had burned down.

Undaunted, and with some help from Rodney Dangerfield, who invited him to perform on his &quot;HBO Young Comedians Special&quot;, Schimmel began making a name for himself. He wrote material for &quot;In Living Color&quot; and for comedians such as Yakov Smirnoff and Jimmie Walker.

In 2000 Schimmel had developed and completed a TV pilot for a show that would bear his name for the FOX network, with Brie Larson and Vicki Davis as his two daughters. The show was put on hiatus when Schimmel became ill from cancer and eventually cancelled. The opening scene is available on YouTube.

== Comedic style ==
Schimmel cited Lenny Bruce as his all-time comedy hero. Schimmel incorporated many aspects of his personal life into his act, such as sex with his wife and masturbation, and even his cancer and the death of his son. In one signature bit, Schimmel joked about making obscene suggestions to a lady from the Make-a-Wish Foundation. His act was described as raunchy and sexually explicit, which he claimed as the reason he never appeared on network television. He said his inappropriate comments on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Squares&quot; caused him to be removed, though he later returned to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s show. However, his edgy style made him a hit on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Schimmel married his first wife, Vicki, in 1977, and they had four children together. Their son Derek died from cancer at the age of 11. Schimmel later divorced and remarried, having two sons with his second wife, Melissa.

As an adult, Schimmel suffered from cancer and had one of his testicles removed.

Schimmel had a complicated relationship with his first wife, Vicki. &quot;We got married, then got the marriage annulled, then got remarried, got divorced then remarried,&quot; and then their son Derek became ill from cancer and died. They eventually divorced permanently in 2000 when Schimmel became romantically involved with his second wife Melissa.

In 1998, Schimmel suffered a heart attack. In June 2000, he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma. His treatments included chemotherapy and required long stays in the hospital. Schimmel detailed this experience, in a humorous light, in his book &quot;Cancer on Five Dollars a Day* (*chemo not included): How Humor Got Me Through the Toughest Journey of My Life.&quot;

Schimmel was arrested in Calabasas, California on May 2, 2009, as a result of an alleged confrontation between himself and his wife Melissa. The district attorney eventually declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence. On May 8, 2009, Melissa Schimmel filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. Schimmel claimed, during an interview with Howard Stern, that his wife had cheated on him with their neighbor, although he admitted he had no solid proof. Schimmel also stated that he was bankrupt due to some of the actions that Melissa had taken with his money.

During an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; on January 28, 2010, Schimmel announced that he developed cirrhosis as a result of a hepatitis C infection from a blood transfusion that he received while in the Air Force. His cirrhosis had progressed to the point that he was working to be added to the waiting list for a donated liver.

== Death ==
On August 26, 2010, in Scottsdale, Arizona, Schimmel was a passenger in a car driven by his 19-year-old daughter Aliyah. After veering off the road to avoid hitting another vehicle, the car flipped onto its side and came to a stop in the shoulder of the Loop 101 freeway. Schimmel was hospitalized at John C. Lincoln Hospital (North Phoenix) in serious condition, while Aliyah was hospitalized in stable condition. Schimmel&#x27;s son Jacob, who was also in the vehicle at the time of accident, was uninjured. On September 3, 2010, Schimmel died of his injuries.

He is interred at the Paradise Memorial Gardens in Scottsdale, Arizona.

<text>Broadvoice is a privately owned company headquartered in Northridge, California. They provide Voice over IP (VOIP) cloud-based telecommunications services to small, medium, and enterprise businesses in the United States. Broadvoice offers telephone services, unified communications as a service (UCaaS), SIP Trunking, telecommunications network and security, along with virtual call centers, so business customers can use voice and video communications via a broadband Internet connection or cellular phone.

==History==

Broadvoice started as a pager company, Rampage Cellular, in the San Fernando Valley in the early 1990s. After the Northridge Earthquake in 1994, its founders Jim Murphy and Ari Ramenzani lost all their inventory stored in their apartment due to flooding of an aquarium, and used the funds from FEMA to lease their first office. This led to the founding of DSL Extreme, a residential broadband internet provider, in 1999.

After the sale of DSL Extreme in 2005 Jim and Ari founded Phone Power in 2005, a residential VOIP Telecommunications service offering telephone services throughout the United States and Canada.

In 2012, Phone Power acquired Broadvoice; that same year, Phone Power rebranded itself as Broadvoice.

Before the acquisition by Phone Power, Broadvoice was a subsidiary of Convergent Networks, which was founded in December 2003 by David Epstein and Nathan Stratton and was based in the Billerica, Massachusetts area as of 2008. Convergent was purchased by Eastern Photonics, a subsidiary of Global NAPs, a competitive local exchange carrier.

Jim Murphy serves as the CEO of Broadvoice. 
Sam Ghahremanpour serves as President and is responsible for corporate strategy, business development, and brand development. 
George Mitsopoulos serves as the chief operating officer (COO). He joined Broadvoice with the re-acquisition of IKANO&#x27;s Broadband internet provider DSL Extreme in 2015.

<text>Willis W. Harman (August 16, 1918 – January 30, 1997) was an American engineer, futurist, and author associated with the human potential movement. He was convinced that late industrial civilization faced a period of major cultural crisis which called for a profound transformation of human consciousness. Over a career lasting some four decades, he worked to raise public awareness on the subject through his writings and to foster relevant research through the nonprofit research institute SRI International, the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS), and the World Business Academy (WBA). He served as president of IONS for two decades, and he was a cofounder of the WBA. His many books include volumes coauthored with the futurist Howard Rheingold, who put forward similar views, and the mythologist Joseph Campbell.

==Early life and education==
Willis W. Harman was born in Seattle, Washington on August 16, 1918. His father was a hydroelectric engineer and his mother was a music teacher. He attended the Western Washington College of Education before moving on to graduate from the University of Washington in 1939 with a B.S. in electrical engineering.

After graduation, he worked for General Electric and then joined the Navy as an electrical officer. He was stationed on the USS Maryland (BB-46) but was ashore at his home near Pearl Harbor during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. After the end of World War II, Harman received his M.S. in physics and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1948.

==Academic career==
Harman taught for several years at the University of Florida before joining the Stanford faculty in 1952 to teach electrical engineering and physics. In 1966, his faculty line was transferred from the Department of Electrical Engineering to the Department of Engineering-Economic Systems (since absorbed by the Department of Management Science and Engineering) at the behest of founding chair Bill Linvill.
In 1954, he attended a summer seminar on ethics, meditation, and the spiritual life that had a transformative effect on both his thinking and his career. He later said of this experience that it &quot;opened up vast areas I didn&#x27;t even know were there. It completely changed my concept of what is important in education, and in time led to various activities in the field of humanistic psychology.&quot;

Harman became convinced that Western culture was facing a spiritual and moral crisis stemming from the ravages of industrialism and its economic logic, which he came to call the &quot;World Macroproblem&quot;. As Harman saw it, &quot;If you look at the assumptions underlying our economic system – especially the ones regarding the prerogatives of ownership – and then you look at the goals we humans have about how we want to live our lives, there is no compatibility. The assumptions can never lead to the goals.&quot; In his view, this crisis that called for development of both an &quot;ecological ethic&quot; and a &quot;self-realization ethic&quot;. In short, society needed to transform its institutions to support the personal development of individual human beings within an environment of limited resources. Because Harman considered humans an integral part of the natural world, he saw individual self-realization and environmental sustainability as synergistic rather than contradictory paths forward. Harman also recognized the large (and often problematic) role that unconscious processes play in human culture and foresaw that work was needed to better understand how such processes might be harnessed in positive ways.

Harman incorporated his new perspective in a popular Stanford graduate seminar called &quot;The Human Potential&quot; that covered topics ranging from meditation to psychedelic drugs to parapsychology.

In 1980, he was appointed a regent of the University of California by Governor Jerry Brown. He served as a regent for ten years.

==SRI International==
From 1967 to 1984, Harman held joint appointments as a senior social scientist at SRI International and director of SRI&#x27;s Educational Policy Research Center. There he initiated a research program focused on solving the problems posed by uncontrolled industrial development. This work led to his 1976 book &quot;An Incomplete Guide to the Future&quot;, with its vision of a transindustrial society. Unlike many futurists, Harman did not believe that the future was predictable simply by projecting current trends; consequently, a hallmark of his work is his ability to conceive ideas about the future that don&#x27;t clearly stem from present tendencies.

At SRI, Harman recruited Alfred Matthew Hubbard to the Alternative Futures Project, one of the goals of which was to introduce business and thought leaders to LSD.

==Institute of Noetic Sciences==
Harman was invited by astronaut Edgar Mitchell and writer/speaker Christopher Hegarty (&quot;How to Manage Your Boss&quot;) to join the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) in Sausalito in 1973, the year it was founded. He went on to serve as its president from 1978 until his death in 1997. He described IONS&#x27; mission as bringing science and religion back together, though in ways that would require fundamental changes in both.

Harman was in charge of &quot;Global Mind Change&quot;, then one of four major IONS programs, and was a prophet of Social Media and the Internet. Besides supporting Harman&#x27;s 1988 book of the same title, it sponsored citizen tours of the USSR and other activities.

==World Business Academy==
In 1987, Harman cofounded the World Business Academy with Rinaldo Brutoco and other businesspeople. The WBA grew out of his conviction that business would play a critical role in the period of profound social transformation that Harman foresaw. Its goal was to foster smoother change by helping business leaders assume new roles of social responsibility.

==Family and death==
In 1941, Harman married Charlene Reamer, who survived him. They had three daughters (Billie, Mary, and Susan) and a son, Dean.

Harman died of brain cancer.

==Quotes==
:&quot;A noetic science—a science of consciousness and the world of inner experience—is the most promising contemporary framework within which to carry on that fundamental moral inquiry which stable human societies have always had to place at the center of their concerns.&quot;

:&quot;Business has become, in this last half-century, the most powerful institution on the planet; it is critical that the dominant institution in any society take responsibility for the whole, as the church did in the days of the Holy Roman Empire. But business has not had such a tradition.&quot;

:&quot;The assumptions about economic progress seemed to work rather well during the time when you could equate material progress with general benefit. But that equation doesn’t work anymore. We now have a system that works to the benefit of the few and penalizes masses of people today and in the future.&quot;

:&quot;All the things that I had been taught all of my life were of value clearly were of no value at all. In a few instants they would be gone. But one thing is of value—and only one. Alan Watts called it &#x27;the Supreme Identity&#x27;—the identification with the Divine.&quot;

<text>Michael Richard Lewis (born 17 August 1977) is a Welsh musician. He is best known as the former rhythm guitarist for the Welsh alternative rock band Lostprophets, Welsh/American alternative rock band No Devotion and hardcore punk band Public Disturbance.

==Early life==
Lewis studied civil engineering for a year before turning to music. His mother was a shop assistant, and his father worked in management for a chemical company. Lewis attended Hawthorn High School in Pontypridd. His favourite subjects were Science and History. His first concert, as a concertgoer, came when he saw Tesla at St David&#x27;s Hall.

==Career==
Before Lostprophets formed, Lewis was in a band called Public Disturbance. He was initially the original bassist for Lostprophets, but soon became the rhythm guitarist, with Stuart Richardson replacing him on the bass guitar. After the split of Lostprophets in 2013, Lewis became the manager to a few smaller bands.

On 1 May 2014, it was announced that the former members of Lostprophets (including Lewis) have formed a new band and are writing new music. On 1 July 2014, the new band No Devotion released their first single, &quot;Stay&quot; and have since released their debut album, &quot;Permanence&quot;.

Lee Gaze confirmed that keyboardist Jamie Oliver had departed from the band while also stating that Lewis had not left the band, but he had not worked with the other band members on the following album &quot;No Oblivion&quot;.

==Personal life==
In September 2006, Lewis married his girlfriend, Amber (née Payne). They have a daughter, Gwyneth, and now reside in Malibu, a few streets away from bandmates Jamie Oliver and Stuart Richardson. Amber runs Shoppe Amber Interiors.

Lewis is an avid Star Trek fan and owns a Star Trek uniform. He is a lifelong Everton fan. He surfs Santa Monica beach almost every day when he is at home. Lewis has stated on his Facebook page he is vegan. He follows the straight edge lifestyle.

<text>Virahanka (Devanagari: विरहाङ्क) was an Indian prosodist who is also known for his work on mathematics. He may have lived in the 6th century, but it is also possible that he worked as late as the 8th century.

His work on prosody builds on the &quot;Chhanda-sutras&quot; of Pingala (4th century BCE), and was the basis for a 12th-century commentary by Gopala.
He was the first to propose the so-called Fibonacci Sequence.

<text>Broughshane ( , formerly spelt Brughshane, ) is a large village in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. It is northeast of Ballymena and north of Antrim, on the A42 road. It is part of Mid and East Antrim District Council and had a population of 2,879 people in the 2011 Census.

Its name comes from the Irish for &quot;Shane&#x27;s dwelling&quot;, and seemingly refers to a castle of Shane mac Brian O&#x27;Neill, ruler of the Gaelic territory of Lower Clannaboy from 1595 to 1617, which formerly stood on the north side of the village street. The quaint pub, &quot;The Thatch Inn&quot;, has a thatched roof and is a Grade B+ listed building.

Broughshane is known as the &#x27;Garden Village of Ulster&#x27; with the motto &#x27;People, Plants and Pride growing Together&#x27;. In 2018 the village won Channel Four&#x27;s &#x27;UK Village of the Year&#x27;. It has won Ulster in Bloom, Britain in Bloom and &quot;Entente Florale&quot; (Europe in Bloom). In 2007 and again in 2012, the village won &#x27;Champion of Champions&#x27; award in the Britain in Bloom competition. It has also won the All Ireland Tidy Town Award.

Volunteers have established in the area around the village pond, a wildlife area which has some of every species of swan and many rare types of geese etc.

== Notable people ==
*Broughshane was the ancestral home of Sir George White VC, the most decorated soldier in the British Army and the hero of the Siege of Ladysmith. There is a memorial in the Presbyterian Church graveyard.

<text>Acharya Virasena (792-853 CE), also known as Veerasena, was a Digambara monk and belonged to the lineage of Acharya Kundakunda. He was an Indian mathematician and Jain philosopher and scholar. He was also known as a famous orator and an accomplished poet. His most reputed work is the Jain treatise &quot;Dhavala&quot;. The late Dr. Hiralal Jain places the completion of this treatise in 816 AD.

Virasena was a noted mathematician. He gave the derivation of the volume of a frustum by a sort of infinite procedure. He worked with the concept of &quot;ardhachheda&quot;: the number of times a number can be divided by 2. This coincides with the binary logarithm when applied to powers of two, but gives the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm for other integers. 

Virasena gave the approximate formula &quot;C&quot; = 3&quot;d&quot; + (16&quot;d&quot;+16)/113 to relate the circumference of a circle, &quot;C&quot;, to its diameter, &quot;d&quot;. For large values of &quot;d&quot;, this gives the approximation π ≈ 355/113 = 3.14159292..., which is more accurate than the approximation π ≈ 3.1416 given by Aryabhata in the &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;.

==Life==
Virasena was proficient in astrology, grammar, logic, mathematics and prosody. He wrote &quot;Dhavala&quot;, a commentary on Jain canon &quot;Shatakhandagama&quot;. He also started the work on &quot;Jayadhavalaa&quot; which was completed by his disciples. He was among the jewels of Rashtrakuta Emperor Amoghavarsha.

His lineage started with Chandrasena who initiated Aryanandi. Aryanandi initiated Virasena and Jayasena. Virasena initiated six disciples who were Dasharayguru, Jinasena, Vinayasena, Shripal, Padmasena and Devasena. Dasharayguru and Jinasena initiated Gunabhadra who later initiated Lokasena. Vinayasena initiated Kumarasena who started the Kashtha Sangha.

<text>Andrew Oliver (March 28, 1706 – March 3, 1774) was an American-born merchant and colonial administrator in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Born into a wealthy and politically powerful merchant family, he is best known as the official responsible for implementing the provisions of the Stamp Act, for which he was hanged in effigy. He never actually carried out those duties and was later commissioned as the province&#x27;s lieutenant governor.

==Early life==
Andrew Oliver was born in Boston, capital of the British Province of Massachusetts Bay, on March 28, 1706. His father, Daniel Oliver, was a wealthy and politically active merchant, and his mother, Elizabeth Belcher Oliver, was the sister of Jonathan Belcher, son of another wealthy merchant and governor of the province in the 1730s. Andrew had two brothers: Daniel Oliver (1704–1727) and Peter Oliver (1713–1791). Characterized as &quot;sober and pious&quot;, Andrew was sent to Harvard College, where he graduated in 1724.

Oliver then entered the family business, setting up a merchant business with his brother Peter that concentrated on wine and textiles. The business was successful, and the brothers eventually controlled Boston&#x27;s Long Wharf. On March 20, 1728, Oliver married Mary Fitch, the daughter of Colonel Thomas Fitch. The couple had three children before Mary died in 1732; only one, a son named Andrew, survived to adulthood. After Mary&#x27;s death Oliver traveled to England, returning to Massachusetts in 1734. On December 19, 1734, he married Mary Sanford of Newport, Rhode Island, the sister-in-law of Thomas Hutchinson. The couple had fourteen children.

==Politics and the Stamp Act==
In 1737, Oliver entered politics and won election as Boston&#x27;s town auditor. He held many other local offices, and became a leader of the Hutchinson-Oliver faction, which dominated politics in colonial Massachusetts. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1742 and in 1755 was appointed provincial secretary by Acting Governor Spencer Phips.

In 1765, Oliver was commissioned to administer the unpopular Stamp Act in Massachusetts. He was privately against the act but told people that he was in favor of it, which led colonists to rise against him. On August 14, he was hanged in effigy from Boston&#x27;s Liberty Tree in a protest organized by the Loyal Nine, a precursor to the Sons of Liberty. That night, his house and offices were ransacked by an angry crowd. On August 17, he was compelled to publicly resign his commission. On December 17, the Sons of Liberty again forced him to swear publicly that he would never act as stamp distributor.

==Later career==
He was commissioned lieutenant governor of the colony when his brother-in-law Thomas Hutchinson became governor in 1771. Letters that he and Hutchinson had written in the late 1760s during the protests surrounding the Townshend Acts were published in 1773 and ignited a storm of protest against both men. The business took a serious toll on Oliver&#x27;s health, which suffered further after his wife had died.

Oliver died on March 3, 1774, after he had suffered from an &quot;apoplectick fit.&quot; His death was greeted with glee by the Sons of Liberty, and his burial was marred by acts of protest and violence. Because of the charged political climate, few friends and relatives attended.

Most of Oliver&#x27;s family joined the Loyalists during the American Revolution and its success caused them to resettle to other parts of the British Empire.

<text>Mahāvīra (or Mahaviracharya, &quot;Mahavira the Teacher&quot;) was a 9th-century Indian Jain mathematician possibly born in Mysore, in India. He authored &quot;Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha&quot; (&quot;Ganita Sara Sangraha&quot;) or the Compendium on the gist of Mathematics in 850 CE. He was patronised by the Rashtrakuta emperor Amoghavarsha. He separated astrology from mathematics. It is the earliest Indian text entirely devoted to mathematics. He expounded on the same subjects on which Aryabhata and Brahmagupta contended, but he expressed them more clearly. His work is a highly syncopated approach to algebra and the emphasis in much of his text is on developing the techniques necessary to solve algebraic problems. He is highly respected among Indian mathematicians, because of his establishment of terminology for concepts such as equilateral, and isosceles triangle; rhombus; circle and semicircle. Mahāvīra&#x27;s eminence spread throughout southern India and his books proved inspirational to other mathematicians in Southern India. It was translated into the Telugu language by Pavuluri Mallana as &quot;Saara Sangraha Ganitamu&quot;.

He discovered algebraic identities like &quot;a&quot;3 = &quot;a&quot; (&quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot;) (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot;) + &quot;b&quot;2 (&quot;a&quot; − &quot;b&quot;) + &quot;b&quot;3. He also found out the formula for &quot;n&quot;C&quot;r&quot; as [&quot;n&quot; (&quot;n&quot; − 1) (&quot;n&quot; − 2) ... (&quot;n&quot; − &quot;r&quot; + 1)] / [&quot;r&quot; (&quot;r&quot; − 1) (&quot;r&quot; − 2) ... 2 * 1]. He devised a formula which approximated the area and perimeters of ellipses and found methods to calculate the square of a number and cube roots of a number. He asserted that the square root of a negative number does not exist. Arithmetic operations utilized in his works like Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha(Ganita Sara Sangraha) uses decimal place-value system and include the use of zero. However, he erroneously states that a number divided by zero remains unchanged.

==Rules for decomposing fractions==
Mahāvīra&#x27;s &quot;Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha&quot; gave systematic rules for expressing a fraction as the sum of unit fractions. This follows the use of unit fractions in Indian mathematics in the Vedic period, and the Śulba Sūtras&#x27; giving an approximation of equivalent to formula_1.

In the &quot;Gaṇita-sāra-saṅgraha&quot; (GSS), the second section of the chapter on arithmetic is named &quot;kalā-savarṇa-vyavahāra&quot; (lit. &quot;the operation of the reduction of fractions&quot;). In this, the &quot;bhāgajāti&quot; section (verses 55–98) gives rules for the following:

* To express 1 as the sum of &quot;n&quot; unit fractions (GSS &quot;kalāsavarṇa&quot; 75, examples in 76):
:: formula_2

* To express 1 as the sum of an odd number of unit fractions (GSS &quot;kalāsavarṇa&quot; 77):
:: formula_3

* To express a unit fraction formula_4 as the sum of &quot;n&quot; other fractions with given numerators formula_5 (GSS &quot;kalāsavarṇa&quot; 78, examples in 79):
:: formula_6

* To express any fraction formula_7 as a sum of unit fractions (GSS &quot;kalāsavarṇa&quot; 80, examples in 81):
: Choose an integer &quot;i&quot; such that formula_8 is an integer &quot;r&quot;, then write

<text>The small extension node (SEN) is part of a US military communication system known as Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE). A SEN is composed of two shelters, a switching shelter and a Line of sight radio terminal shelter(LOS).

==History==
Prior to the advent of the satellite based Joint Network Node (JNN), the United States Army used a system known as Mobile Subscriber Equipment (MSE) in order to provide tactical battlefield communications. MSE is a Line-Of-Sight (LOS) terrestrial based communications system limited by terrain and distance. MSE is still in use in limited quantities. Developed as a direct replacement of the Multichannel communications telephone switching system used from the 1960 to early 2000s.

The MSE SEN primary role is to provide tactical telephone and data network communications to the battlefield. Capabilities include integration into existing and backwards compatible interfaces for older branch exchange, as well a field radio integration. This integration allows for the SEN capabilities to provide communications in battlefield as well as civilian communication disaster support.

==Description==
A SEN switching shelter contains switching, multiplexing, and communications security (COMSEC) equipment for secure digital voice and data communications. A single switching shelter is mounted on the back of a HMMWV, powered is provided by a 10 kW diesel generator, and the SEN is operated by up to a six soldier team. To provide communications for a Corps area the Signal Battalion would deploy forty SEN&#x27;s, amongst Node Centers, Large Extension Nodes, and Radio Access Units.

The current switch is designated AN/TTC-48, with a suffix to identify each of the ten versions in operation - (V)1, V(2), A(V)1, A(V)2, B(V)1, B(V)2, C(V)1, C(V)2, C(V)3, and C(V)4. The (V)1 provides 26 digital lines and 10-digital trunks and the (V)2 provides 41 digital lines and 13-digital trunks. Both versions interface at various levels with the MSE Area Communication Systems through cable, via line of sight or via tactical satellite terminal.

<text>Jayadeva (c. 1000 CE) was an Indian mathematician, who further developed the cyclic method (Chakravala method) that was called by Hermann Hankel &quot;the finest thing achieved in the theory of numbers before Lagrange (18th century)&quot;. He also made significant contributions to combinatorics.

Jayadeva&#x27;s works are lost, and he is known only from a 20-verse quotation in Udaya-divakara &quot;Sundari&quot; (c. 1073), a commentary on Bhaskara I&#x27;s &quot;Laghu-bhaskariya&quot;. This means that Jayadeva must have lived sometime before 1073, possibly around 1000 CE.

<text>Apple were a British psychedelic rock band. The band was founded in Cardiff in 1968 by Rob Ingram on guitar and Jeff Harrad on bass. They released a single LP in 1969, titled &quot;An Apple a Day&quot;. The album was a commercial failure, and the band ceased to exist shortly after its release. However, during the subsequent years several tracks from the LP, most notably &quot;The Otherside&quot; by Harrad, were dubbed classics of British psychedelic rock by critics, making &quot;An Apple a Day&quot; one of the most sought-after British psychedelic rarities.

The original vinyl version (released by Page One Records) is now extremely hard to find. A reissue by Repertoire Records was released in 1994, which included several bonus songs (those being early mono versions of some of the album&#x27;s tracks).

<text>Emigrant Springs State Heritage Area is a state park located in central Umatilla County, Oregon, United States, approximately 15 mi (24 km) southeast of Pendleton. Located in old growth forest near the summit of the Blue Mountains along Interstate 84, the park was the location of a well-used campsite by emigrants along the Oregon Trail in the middle 19th century.

The park is open year-round and provides a modern campground with hook-ups. The park also has cabins available for rent. During the summer months the park features historical recreations of trail life in the 1850s. The park also contains an Oregon Trail interpretative center. The center is next to a marker commemorating the visit by President Warren G. Harding in 1923, who had come to Eastern Oregon to commemorate the Oregon Trail.

<doc id="1158589" wikidata="Q293736" url="?curid=1158589" title="AIM-47 Falcon">
<text>The Hughes AIM-47 Falcon, originally GAR-9, was a very long-range high-performance air-to-air missile that shared the basic design of the earlier AIM-4 Falcon. It was developed in 1958 along with the new Hughes AN/ASG-18 radar fire-control system intended to arm the Mach 3 XF-108 Rapier interceptor aircraft and, after that jet&#x27;s cancellation, the YF-12A (whose production was itself cancelled after only 3 vehicles). It was never used operationally, but was a direct predecessor of the AIM-54 Phoenix used on the Grumman F-14 Tomcat.

==Development==

===Development for XF-108===
In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force developed requirements for a high speed, high performance interceptor aircraft, originally called the LRI-X. In 1957, Hughes won the contract to supply the weapons system for this aircraft. This system consisted of the GAR-X missile and the YX-1 radar and fire control system. The original missile design had a range of 15 to 25 miles (25 to 40 km), and could be equipped with a conventional warhead or a 0.25 kiloton version of the W42 nuclear warhead. When the North American XF-108 Rapier was announced as the winner of the LRI-X contest in April 1958, the Hughes entries were redesignated GAR-9 and AN/ASG-18 on the same day. The F-108 was canceled in September 1959, but the Air Force decided to continue development of the missile system with both warheads.

During its development, the capabilities of the new missile grew tremendously. Growing much larger, the missile&#x27;s range was extended to 100 miles (160 km), using the Aerojet-General XM59 solid-fuel motor. The SARH seeker was a powerful system of its own, with the resolution to be able to lock onto a target at 63 nm (116 km). Some consideration was given to the addition of a passive infrared homing seeker to improve terminal performance but that would have required the missile to grow by and two inches in diameter, making it too large for the F-108&#x27;s weapon bay. The W42 nuclear version was dropped in 1958 in favor of a high-explosive design.

Problems with the motor during development led to the brief consideration of using a storable liquid-fuel rocket design, but was replaced instead by the Lockheed XSR13-LP-1 solid rocket. This lowered the top speed from Mach 6 to Mach 4. In this form, the GAR-9 started ground firings in August 1961. For air-launch testing at supersonic speeds the Republic XF-103 had originally been proposed as a test platform, but this aircraft was canceled before reaching the prototype stage. Instead, B-58 Hustler s/n 55-665 was modified to house the AN/ASG-18 radar in a large protruding radome that gave it the nickname &quot;Snoopy&quot;, and in-flight launches started in May 1962.

===Development for YF-12===
In 1960 Lockheed started development of the Lockheed YF-12 interceptor, as a lower-cost replacement for the F-108. The GAR-9/ASG-18 were moved to this project. The F-12 would have featured four flip-open internal weapons bays on the chines behind the cockpit, one of these filled with electronics. The F-12B bays were too small for the GAR-9, so the GAR-9B was developed with flip-out fins to reduce its diameter. It weighed .

Test firings of the GAR-9A from the prototype F-12As resulted in six kills from seven launches, the lone miss due to a missile power failure (there were several non-guiding test launches as well). The missile was renamed AIM-47 in late 1962 as part of the transition to common naming for aerospace vehicles across the U.S. Department of Defense in 1962. The last launch was from a YF-12 flying at Mach 3.2 and an altitude of at a QB-47 target drone off the ground.

In 1966, the F-12 project was canceled just as the F-108 had been. Another project which expressed an interest in the design was the XB-70 Valkyrie, a bomber which could have carried the AIM-47 for self-defense. This aircraft was also canceled after Soviet deployment of effective high-altitude surface-to-air missiles made high-altitude attacks on the Soviet Union impractical.

Hughes had built 80 pre-production AIM-47 missiles.

== Legacy ==
The AIM-47 was used as a base for the AIM-54 Phoenix (originally the AAM-N-11), intended for the General Dynamics F-111B. This project was also canceled in 1968, but the weapon system finally found a home on the F-14 Tomcat, entering service in the early 1970s.

In 1966, the basic airframe was adapted with the seeker from the AGM-45 Shrike and the warhead from the Mk 81 bomb to create the high-speed AGM-76 Falcon anti-radar missile, although this did not see service.

<text>Windows Installer (codice_1, previously known as Microsoft Installer, codename Darwin) is a software component and application programming interface (API) of Microsoft Windows used for the installation, maintenance, and removal of software. The installation information, and optionally the files themselves, are packaged in &quot;installation packages&quot;, loosely relational databases structured as COM Structured Storages and commonly known as &quot;MSI files&quot;, from their default filename extensions. The packages with the file extensions codice_2 contain Windows Installer &quot;Transformation Scripts&quot;, those with the codice_3 extensions contain &quot;Merge Modules&quot; and the file extension codice_4 is used for &quot;Patch Creation Properties&quot;. Windows Installer contains significant changes from its predecessor, Setup API. New features include a GUI framework and automatic generation of the uninstallation sequence. Windows Installer is positioned as an alternative to stand-alone executable installer frameworks such as older versions of InstallShield and NSIS.

Before the introduction of Microsoft Store (then named Windows Store), Microsoft encouraged third parties to use Windows Installer as the basis for installation frameworks, so that they synchronize correctly with other installers and keep the internal database of installed products consistent. Important features such as rollback and versioning depend on a consistent internal database for reliable operation. Furthermore, Windows Installer facilitates the principle of least privilege by performing software installations by proxy for unprivileged users.

==Logical structure of packages==
A package describes the installation of one or more full &quot;products&quot; and is universally identified by a GUID. A product is made up of &quot;components&quot;, grouped into &quot;features&quot;. Windows Installer does not handle dependencies between products.

===Products===
A single, installed, working program (or set of programs) is a &quot;product&quot;. A product is identified by a unique GUID (the ProductCode property) providing an authoritative identity throughout the world. The GUID, in combination with the version number (ProductVersion property), allows for release management of the product&#x27;s files and registry keys.

A &quot;package&quot; includes the package logic and other metadata that relates to how the package executes when running. For example, changing an EXE file in the product may require the ProductCode or ProductVersion to be changed for the release management. However, merely changing or adding a launch condition (with the product remaining exactly the same as the previous version) would still require the PackageCode to change for release management of the MSI file itself.

===Features===
A &quot;feature&quot; is a hierarchical group of components. A feature may contain any number of components and other sub-features. Smaller packages can consist of a single feature. More complex installers may display a &quot;custom setup&quot; dialog box, from which the user can select which features to install or remove.

The package author defines the product features. A word processor, for example, might place the program&#x27;s core file into one feature, and the program&#x27;s help files, optional spelling checker and stationery modules into additional features.

===Components===
A &quot;component&quot; is the basic unit of a product. Each component is treated by Windows Installer as a unit. The installer cannot install just part of a component. Components can contain program files, folders, COM components, registry keys, and shortcuts. The user does not directly interact with components.

Components are identified globally by GUIDs; thus the same component can be shared among several features of the same package or multiple packages, ideally through the use of Merge Modules.

===Key paths===
A &quot;key path&quot; is a specific file, registry key, or ODBC data source that the package author specifies as critical for a given component. Because a file is the most common type of key path, the term &quot;key file&quot; is commonly used. A component can contain at most one key path; if a component has no explicit key path, the component&#x27;s destination folder is taken to be the key path. When an MSI-based program is launched, Windows Installer checks the existence of key paths. If there is a mismatch between the current system state and the value specified in the MSI package (e.g., a key file is missing), the related feature is re-installed. This process is known as &quot;self-healing&quot; or &quot;self-repair&quot;. No two components should use the same key path.

==Developing installer packages==
Creating an installer package for a new application is not trivial. It is necessary to specify which files must be installed, to where and with what registry keys. Any non-standard operations can be done using Custom Actions, which are typically developed in DLLs. There are a number of commercial and freeware products to assist in creating MSI packages, including Visual Studio (natively up to VS 2010, with an extension on newer VS versions), InstallShield, WiX and Advanced Installer. To varying degrees, the user interface and behavior may be configured for use in less common situations such as unattended installation. Once prepared, an installer package is &quot;compiled&quot; by reading the instructions and files from the developer&#x27;s local machine, and creating the .msi file.

Windows Installer may be slower than native code installation technologies, such as InstallAware, due to the overhead of component registration and rollback support, which often involves generating tens of thousands of registry keys and temporary files.

The user interface (dialog boxes) presented at the start of installation can be changed or configured by the setup engineer developing a new installer. There is a limited language of buttons, text fields and labels which can be arranged in a sequence of dialogue boxes. An installer package should be capable of running without any UI, for what is called &quot;unattended installation&quot;.

===ICE validation===
Microsoft provides a set of Internal Consistency Evaluators (ICE) that can be used to detect potential problems with an MSI database. The ICE rules are combined into CUB files, which are stripped-down MSI files containing custom actions that test the target MSI database&#x27;s contents for validation warnings and errors. ICE validation can be performed with the Platform SDK tools Orca and msival2, or with validation tools that ship with the various authoring environments.

For example, some of the ICE rules are:

* ICE09: Validates that any component destined for the System folder is marked as being permanent.
* ICE24: Validates that the product code, product version, and product language have appropriate formats.
* ICE33: Validates that the Registry table is not used for data better suited for another table (Class, Extension, Verb, and so on).

Addressing ICE validation warnings and errors is an important step in the release process.

<text>Hot Shots II is the second studio album by the Scottish musical group The Beta Band, released on 16 July 2001. Colin &quot;C-Swing&quot; Emmanuel and the band co-produced the album. The band&#x27;s previous work had used dense experimentation but &quot;Hot Shots II&quot; had a minimal style influenced by R&amp;B, hip hop and electronica.

Mason later said the album was &quot;us doing what we promised to do and making something completely incredible, that didn&#x27;t sound like anything else. Nothing else that&#x27;s ever come after it has ever sounded like it. It&#x27;s got good, fleshed out and complete songs on it.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Hot Shots II&quot; at number 118 on its list of top 200 albums of the 2000s. The album is also included in the 2010 edition of &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Kludge&quot; ranked it at number 1 on its list of top 10 albums of 2001.

<text>The Critérium du Dauphiné, before 2010 known as the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, is an annual cycling road race in the Dauphiné region in the southeast of France. The race is run over eight days during the first half of June. It is part of the UCI World Tour calendar and counts as one of the foremost races in the lead-up to the Tour de France in July, along with the Tour de Suisse in the latter half of June.

The race was inaugurated in 1947 by a local newspaper, the &quot;Dauphiné Libéré&quot;, which served as the event&#x27;s title sponsor until 2009. Since 2010 the race has been organized by ASO, which also organizes most other prominent French cycling races, notably the Tour de France, Paris–Nice and Paris–Roubaix.

As the Dauphiné is set in the Rhône-Alpes region, part of the French Alps, the race&#x27;s protagonists are often climbing specialists. Many well-known climbs from the Tour de France – like the Mont Ventoux, the Col du Galibier or Col de la Chartreuse – are regularly addressed in the Dauphiné. Five riders, Nello Lauredi, Luis Ocaña, Charly Mottet, Bernard Hinault and Chris Froome, share the record of most wins, with three each.

==History==

===Creation===
The race was created in 1947 by newspaper &quot;Le Dauphiné libéré&quot; to promote its circulation. After World War II, as cycling recovered from a universal five- or six-year hiatus, the Grenoble-based newspaper decided to create and organize a cycling stage race covering the Dauphiné region. The race was named after the newspaper and set in June, prior to the Tour de France. Polish rider Edward Klabiński won the inaugural edition.

Because of its mountainous route and date on the calendar, the race served as preparation for the Tour de France by French cyclists. French cycling icons Jean Robic and Louison Bobet used the &quot;Dauphiné Libéré&quot; as the ultimate stage race in their build-up towards the Tour de France.

The event was discontinued for two years in 1967 and 1968. The current form of the Critérium du Dauphiné is the consequence of a merger with the &quot;Circuit des Six-Provinces-Dauphiné&quot; in 1969. For many years, the organization of the &quot;Dauphiné&quot; was shared between the newspaper publishers and ASO. In 2010, the newspaper ceded all organizational responsibility to ASO, and the race&#x27;s name was abbreviated to &quot;Critérium du Dauphiné&quot;.

For many decades, the race has also served as a test for both bike manufacturers to test advanced equipment, and for TV broadcasters preparing the Tour de France, as TV coverage is difficult in the mountainous region.

In the 1990s the race was categorized as a UCI 2.HC event, cycling&#x27;s highest-rated stage races behind the Grand Tours. In 2005 it was included in the inaugural UCI Pro Tour and in 2011 in its successor, the UCI World Tour.

The Critérium du Dauphiné is the only race that was won by all the quintuple winners of the Tour de France, namely Jacques Anquetil, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Miguel Induráin. Eleven racers have also won the race and the Tour de France in the same year: Louison Bobet in 1955; Anquetil in 1963; Merckx in 1971; Luis Ocaña in 1973; Bernard Thévenet in 1975; Hinault in 1979 and 1981; Induráin in 1995; Bradley Wiggins in 2012; Chris Froome in 2013, 2015, and 2016; Geraint Thomas in 2018 and Jonas Vingegaard in 2023. Lance Armstrong won the race in 2002 and 2003, but was retroactively stripped of his titles in 2013, in the wake of the protracted doping scandal.

==Route==

The Dauphiné is raced over 8 days in the Rhône-Alpes region in the southeast of France, traditionally covering portions of the French Alps. The race has often, but not always, started with an opening prologue on Sunday. The Monday and Tuesday stages are usually held in the lower hilly regions of Rhône-Alpes, before addressing the high mountains in the second half of the Dauphiné. Often there is one long individual or team time trial included.

Benefiting from its location and place on the calendar, race organizers often feature a mountain stage with a route that is nearly identical to what the Tour will trace one month later.

Grenoble, the capital of the Dauphiné region, has hosted the start or finish of a stage most often. Other cities regularly hosting a stage are Avignon, Saint-Étienne, Annecy, Chambéry, Gap, Lyon, Aix-les-Bains, Valence, Briançon and Vals-les-Bains.

==Jerseys==

The leader of the general classification wears a yellow jersey with a blue band, distinct from the other racers. In 1948, a mountains classification was added, which as of 2017 gives a polka-dot jersey to the leader. In 1955, a points classification was added, which gives a green jersey to the leader.

<doc id="1158626" wikidata="Q470902" url="?curid=1158626" title="Bhāskara I">
<text>Bhāskara () (commonly called Bhāskara I to avoid confusion with the 12th-century mathematician Bhāskara II) was a 7th-century Indian mathematician and astronomer who was the first to write numbers in the Hindu–Arabic decimal system with a circle for the zero, and who gave a unique and remarkable rational approximation of the sine function in his commentary on Aryabhata&#x27;s work. This commentary, &quot;Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣya&quot;, written in 629, is among the oldest known prose works in Sanskrit on mathematics and astronomy. He also wrote two astronomical works in the line of Aryabhata&#x27;s school: the &quot;Mahābhāskarīya&quot; (&quot;Great Book of Bhāskara&quot;) and the &quot;Laghubhāskarīya&quot; (&quot;Small Book of Bhāskara&quot;).

On 7 June 1979, the Indian Space Research Organisation launched the Bhāskara I satellite, named in honour of the mathematician.

== Biography ==
Little is known about Bhāskara&#x27;s life, except for what can be deduced from his writings. He was born in India in the 7th century, and was probably an astronomer. Bhāskara I received his astronomical education from his father.

There are references to places in India in Bhāskara&#x27;s writings, such as Vallabhi (the capital of the Maitraka dynasty in the 7th century) and Sivarajapura, both of which are in the Saurastra region of the present-day state of Gujarat in India. Also mentioned are Bharuch in southern Gujarat, and Thanesar in the eastern Punjab, which was ruled by Harsha. Therefore, a reasonable guess would be that Bhāskara was born in Saurastra and later moved to Aśmaka.

Bhāskara I is considered the most important scholar of Aryabhata&#x27;s astronomical school. He and Brahmagupta are two of the most renowned Indian mathematicians; both made considerable contributions to the study of fractions.

== Representation of numbers ==
The most important mathematical contribution of Bhāskara I concerns the representation of numbers in a positional numeral system. The first positional representations had been known to Indian astronomers approximately 500 years before Bhāskara&#x27;s work. However, these numbers were written not in figures, but in words or allegories and were organized in verses. For instance, the number 1 was given as &quot;moon&quot;, since it exists only once; the number 2 was represented by &quot;wings&quot;, &quot;twins&quot;, or &quot;eyes&quot; since they always occur in pairs; the number 5 was given by the (5) &quot;senses&quot;. Similar to our current decimal system, these words were aligned such that each number assigns the factor of the power of ten corresponding to its position, only in reverse order: the higher powers were to the right of the lower ones.

Bhāskara&#x27;s numeral system was truly positional, in contrast to word representations, where the same word could represent multiple values (such as 40 or 400). He often explained a number given in his numeral system by stating &quot;ankair api&quot; (&quot;in figures this reads&quot;), and then repeating it written with the first nine Brahmi numerals, using a small circle for the zero. Contrary to the word system, however, his numerals were written in descending values from left to right, exactly as we do it today. Therefore, since at least 629, the decimal system was definitely known to Indian scholars. Presumably, Bhāskara did not invent it, but he was the first to openly use the Brahmi numerals in a scientific contribution in Sanskrit.

== Further contributions ==

=== Mathematics ===
Bhāskara I wrote three astronomical contributions. In 629, he annotated the &quot;Āryabhaṭīya&quot;, an astronomical treatise by Aryabhata written in verses. Bhāskara&#x27;s comments referred exactly to the 33 verses dealing with mathematics, in which he considered variable equations and trigonometric formulae. In general, he emphasized proving mathematical rules instead of simply relying on tradition or expediency.

His work &quot;Mahābhāskarīya&quot; is divided into eight chapters about mathematical astronomy. In chapter 7, he gives a remarkable approximation formula for sin x:
: formula_1
which he assigns to Aryabhata. It reveals a relative error of less than 1.9% (the greatest deviation formula_2 at formula_3). Additionally, he gives relations between sine and cosine, as well as relations between the sine of an angle less than 90° and the sines of angles 90°–180°, 180°–270°, and greater than 270°.

Moreover, Bhāskara stated theorems about the solutions to equations now known as Pell&#x27;s equations. For instance, he posed the problem: &quot;Tell me, O mathematician, what is that square which multiplied by 8 becomes – together with unity – a square?&quot; In modern notation, he asked for the solutions of the Pell equation formula_4 (or formula_5 relative to pell&#x27;s equation). This equation has the simple solution x = 1, y = 3, or shortly (x,y) = (1,3), from which further solutions can be constructed, such as (x,y) = (6,17).

Bhāskara clearly believed that &quot;&quot; was irrational. In support of Aryabhata&#x27;s approximation of , he criticized its approximation to formula_6, a practice common among Jain mathematicians. 

He was the first mathematician to openly discuss quadrilaterals with four unequal, nonparallel sides.

=== Astronomy ===
The &quot;Mahābhāskarīya&quot; consists of eight chapters dealing with mathematical astronomy. The book deals with topics such as the longitudes of the planets, the conjunctions among the planets and stars, the phases of the moon, solar and lunar eclipses, and the rising and setting of the planets.

Parts of &quot;Mahābhāskarīya&quot; were later translated into Arabic.

<doc id="1158634" wikidata="Q4928992" url="?curid=1158634" title="Blue Collar TV">
<text>Blue Collar TV is an American sketch comedy television series that aired on The WB from July 29, 2004 to July 26, 2006 starring Jeff Foxworthy, Bill Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy. The show&#x27;s humor dealt principally with contemporary American society, and especially hillbilly, redneck, and Southern stereotypes. The show was greenlighted on the heels of the success of the Blue Collar Comedy Tour, which the series&#x27; three lead actors toured with in the 2001s. It was created by Fax Bahr and Adam Small, in addition to J.P. Williams and Jeff Foxworthy. &quot;Blue collar&quot; is an American phrase used to describe manual laborers, as opposed to white collar for office or professional workers.

==Overview==
Unlike most sketch comedy programs, each episode of &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; was generally centered on a theme, which Foxworthy revealed at the start of each episode. Themes included &quot;Food&quot;, &quot;Kids&quot;, and &quot;Stupidity&quot;, among others, with Foxworthy generally performing a short comedic monologue based on the theme. Most sketches in each episode featured at least one of the three Blue Collar Comedy Tour veterans in an acting role (including almost all from the first season), but the second season saw more sketches featuring the six other cast members exclusively.

===Recurring sketches===
* &quot;Bad Jobs for Take Your Daughter to Work Day&quot;: This sketch features Foxworthy, Engvall, or Larry the Cable Guy at a job with their &quot;daughter&quot; tagging along. Their job is always something that would make Take Your Daughter-To Work Day awkward, such as a NASCAR driver or a newscaster.
* &quot;Big Kids&quot;: Foxworthy, Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy play Ronnie, Blake, and Dooley, three toddlers who constantly misbehave and annoy their parents, usually from the back seat of their car.
* &quot;Bill the Bad Storyteller&quot;: Bill Engvall tries to tell a story to his friends, but he is unable to tell it very well. In most cases, the story starts off interesting or creepy, but the conclusion is very plain and boring.
* &quot;Dan Grogan&quot;: Grogan (Foxworthy) is the spokesman and owner of Dan Grogan&#x27;s House of Gravy and Gravy Spa. Grogan&#x27;s company also makes and sells Pre-Chewed Food and Ranch Cleanser. Grogan&#x27;s restaurants and spas are well known for their &quot;Gravy Bombs&quot; (balloons filled with brown gravy) and appearances by &quot;Sergeant Gravy (Engvall) and Davey the Gravy Dog&quot;.
* &quot;Dinner with...&quot;: After a short skit featuring a character saying who he would not want to be invited over for dinner, the scenario is shown featuring a typical family, with that very person over for dinner. The dinner guests have included Hank Williams Jr., Joe Rogan, and Jeff Jarrett.
* &quot;Fat Family&quot;: Engvall, Brooke Dillman, and Ayda Field play a family of morbidly obese people, though they are proud of their physical state and do not like skinny people or the thought of losing weight. Their appearances usually revolve around normal sitcom happenings, though modified to suit their happiness of their weight.
* &quot;Martha Stewart&#x27;s Tips from the Inside&quot;: Martha Stewart (Dillman) gives household hints from jail, each hint inspired by her prison experiences.
* &quot;The Martin Bros.&quot;: Casey, Jack, and Dale Martin (Foxworthy, Engvall, and Larry the Cable Guy), are three unruly brothers who drink all the time, play jokes on people, and never take anything seriously. They were first seen hosting the show &quot;Hick Eye for the Queer Guy&quot;, and later opened a party planning company.
* &quot;On the Red Carpet with Dee and Engle Barry&quot;: Dee and Engle (Foxworthy and Larry the Cable Guy) interview big names in country music at the Country Music Awards red carpet pre-show.
* &quot;Politically Correct Fairy Tales&quot;: Larry the Cable Guy reads fairy tales that are now politically correct from his niece&#x27;s (or nephew&#x27;s) fairy tale book (&quot;Snow Caucasian and the Seven Handy Capable Little Persons&quot;, for example) to the children. He is not impressed with the stories in their new state, and usually stops before the story is finished (except for &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare in the Non-Competitive Fun Run&quot;) to explain &quot;how it really ends&quot;, which usually involves him going into the story, and abruptly ending it (for example, in &quot;Vertically-Challenged Native American Riding Hood and the Endangered Wolf&quot;, he ends the story by saying &quot;I go in there, I shoot the wolf, send Grandma to an old folks home, get Little Red Riding Hood out of that hood, and shack up and eat wolf steaks.&quot;). Other &quot;Politically Correct Fairy Tales&quot; that have been told by Larry the Cable Guy include:
** &quot;Jack and the Organic Beanstalk&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;).
** &quot;&#x27;Twas The Night Before A Non-Denominational Winter Holiday&quot; (formerly known as &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;).
** &quot;A Child&#x27;s Guide to Health and Wellness&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;).
* &quot;The Redneck Dictionary&quot;: On each episode, an entry in &quot;The Redneck Dictionary&quot; is shown, where cast members take common words and morph them into perceived redneck speech. An example would be &quot;artichoke&quot; (I &quot;artichoke&quot; the feller who told me to order this). The only recurring sketch used in every episode, it is based on an element of Jeff Foxworthy&#x27;s stand-up act. &quot;The Redneck Dictionary&quot; itself is jokingly published by Hatfield-McCoy, a parody of Merriam-Webster.
* &quot;Redneck Yard of the Week&quot;: Each week, Foxworthy and Ayda Field present a Redneck Yard of the Week, as submitted by home viewers to http://www.redneckyard.com. The presentation is done like an awards ceremony, with Foxworthy providing commentary on the winning yard after the yard is shown.
* &quot;Rescue 911!&quot;: A parody of the television show of the same name, hosted by Jim Farnsworth (Foxworthy). Each episode inexplicably revolves around the Parker family, after Tom (Oldring) gets devastating injuries caused inadvertently by his Grandma, followed by Dad (Larry) calling 911, and the EMTs arriving, where Jim Mayweather (Williams) suffers similar injuries, and Don Clinton (Engvall) saves the day.
* &quot;Tell Me That Don&#x27;t Stink&quot;: Here, Foxworthy has the female cast members (Heath and an audience member also played once each) smell a substance that does not smell very pleasant at all. Smelled items include doe-in-heat urine and valerian root.
* &quot;The Deck&quot;: Four friends sit on a deck and tell deck stories, with the humor coming from double entendres involving the similarities between the words &quot;deck&quot; and &quot;dick&quot;. The first sketch featured guest star Drew Carey.
* &quot;The Tacketts&quot;: A dysfunctional redneck family in a sitcom-like environment. Each episode involves a conflict, usually involving the bickering father and mother (Jeff and Brooke), though each episode ends happily. Also features Larry, Bill, and Ashley as the other members of the family.
* &quot;CSI&quot;: based on the television show &quot;&quot;, it talks about crimes that take place, for example, in the Greensboro Tri-County Area, finds evidence of the crime and finds the criminal.
* &quot;The What Burns Me Booth&quot;: A testimonial booth where various people say what burns them up.
* &quot;White Trash Days of Our Lives&quot;: A spoof of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, which Ayda Field co-stars in. Follows the formula of a soap opera, except with redneck characters.
* &quot;Who&#x27;s the Fool&quot;: A game show featuring two contestants listening to humorous stories from Engvall, Foxworthy, and Larry the Cable Guy, then deciding whether or not the story is true.
* Though not technically a recurring sketch, many episodes feature a parody of a television show or film, only featuring Larry the Cable Guy as the star. Such examples have included &quot;The Real Bachelor&quot; (a parody of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;), &quot;Larry the Spider Guy&quot; (a parody of &quot;Spider-Man&quot;), and &quot;Handicops&quot; (a parody of &quot;COPS&quot;).
* &quot;Totes TV&quot;: A skit featuring Brooke, Ashley, Ayda and Bill playing women hosting a talk show television show with a sorority background. The girls act out of excitement and talk incoherently whenever they have a celebrity guest on.

==Production==
Fellow Blue Collar Comedy Tour costar Ron White declined to star on &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; due to a fear of being typecast as &quot;blue collar&quot;. However, he guest-starred on many episodes of the show. On his 2006 comedy album, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Fix Stupid&quot;, White jokingly cited his own lack of work ethic as a reason for not participating more on the show.

The show originated from the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta. Later episodes of season 1 and all episodes of season 2 were taped at the Classic Center in Athens, Georgia, although the show taped at the House of Blues in New Orleans during a two-episode road trip in 2004. Later episodes were recorded during their Blue Collar tour.

The show halted production a few weeks into the 2005 fall season. It was also removed from the WB&#x27;s lineup. No official statement was given by the WB, though Engvall and Larry the Cable Guy both confirmed the end of &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; on their websites.

&quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; returned on May 31, 2006, to finish airing its second season throughout the summer as filler for the final weeks of the WB, which would shut down later that year. The show did not move to The CW. In summer 2006, Foxworthy started his own show, &quot;Foxworthy&#x27;s Big Night Out&quot;, which aired on Country Music Television and retained some aspects of the &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; format. It was canceled after one season. The show aired in reruns on Comedy Central&#x27;s sister network CMT for a time in the early 2010s. In Canada the series aired on The Comedy Network (Now CTV Comedy Channel), CTV, BiteTV (Now Makeful), and CMT.

In 2022, reruns began airing on Circle, a country music and lifestyle-focused digital multicast channel partially owned by Opry Entertainment Group.

<text>The scoop stretcher (or clamshell, Roberson orthopedic stretcher, or just scoop) is a device used specifically for moving injured people. It is ideal for carrying casualties with possible spinal injuries.

A scoop stretcher has a structure that can be split vertically into two parts, with shaped &#x27;blades&#x27; towards the centre which can be brought together underneath a patient. The two halves are placed separately either side of the patient, and then brought together until securing clips at the top and bottom both engage.

Scoop stretchers reduce the chance of undesirable movement of injured areas during transfer of a trauma patient, as they maintain the patient in a supine alignment during transfer to a stretcher, vacuum mattress or long spine board). They are more comfortable than a long spine board for transport.

The scoop stretcher can be used for patient transport, provided the patient is strapped. However, the ninth edition of the ATLS Student Course Manual advises against using scoop stretchers for patient transport. For comfort and safety reasons, it is recommended to transfer the patient to a vacuum mattress instead, in which case the scoop stretcher is put on the transport device and then opened.

<text>Vaṭeśvara ( ) (born c. 880), was a tenth-century Indian mathematician from Kashmir who presented several trigonometric identities. He was the author (at the age of 24) of the &quot;Vaṭeśvara-siddhānta,&quot; written in 904 AD, a treatise focusing on astronomy and applied mathematics.The work criticized Brahmagupta and defended Aryabhatta I. An edition of the first three chapters was published in 1962 by R. S. Sharma and Mukund Mishra. Al Biruni referred to the works by Vateswara, particularly the Karaṇasāra, noting that the author was the son of Mihdatta who belonged to Nagarapura (also referred to as Anandapura, now named Vadnagar). The Karaṇasāra uses 821 Saka era (899 AD) as a reference year.

<text>Patient transport is a service that transfers patients to and from medical facilities in non-emergency situations.

In emergency situations, patients are transported by the emergency medical services. Non-emergency patient transport is sometimes run by the same agency. It is typically provided to a patient who needs to be transferred to a facility that can provide a higher or more specialised level of care, though emergency services may be summoned if this is urgent. It may also be used to transfer patients from a specialised facility to a local hospital or nursing home when they no longer require this specialised care, such as following successful cardiac catheterisation due to a heart attack. Some countries also offer the service to patients who cannot make their own way to or from the hospital.

== United States ==
Patient transport services are provided in the United States to convey patients to hospitals. The vehicles used are not usually (although there are exceptions) equipped with life-support equipment and are usually crewed by staff with fewer qualifications than the crew of emergency ambulances. Their purpose is simply to transport patients to, from, or between places of treatment. The vehicle is called an ambulette. These services are often provided by ambulance services using non-emergency vehicles but may be subject to tendering processes.

== United Kingdom ==
Patient transport services in the United Kingdom were generally provided by ambulance services after the establishment of the NHS, and originally all emergency ambulance crews began as patient transport drivers. Since the establishment of the NHS internal market in 1990, these services have often been contracted to private providers.

Patient transport service is a separate provision from the Hospital Travel Costs scheme, which is means tested, to fund low-income patients&#x27; journeys to hospital. Clinical commissioning groups (CCG) often arranged for one CCG to manage the tendering and contracting process for a wide area.

Cornwall CCG proposed to restrict this provision for dialysis patients for those who did not have specific medical or financial reasons in 2018 but changed their minds after a campaign led by Kidney Care UK and decided to fund transport for patients requiring dialysis three times a week for a minimum of six weeks, or six times a month for a minimum of three months.

After a string of market failures, NHS England announced a review into the cost of patient transport services and the way they are commissioned in October 2019.

The Care Quality Commission issued a warning to NHS trusts in August 2022 about risks to mental health patients being transported by non-emergency providers after inspections raised issues about the use of restraints, sexual safety, physical health needs, vehicle and equipment safety standards, and unsafe recruitment practices.

<text>James Mugford (May 19, 1749 – May 19, 1776) was a captain in the Continental Navy.

==Life and naval career==
Mugford commanded the schooner &quot;Franklin&quot; in the Continental Navy, serving through 1775 in John Manley&#x27;s squadron off Boston. He captured British ship &quot;Hope&quot; with a large cargo of military stores and powder, and took his prize into Boston, running under the noses of the British fleet lying in the outer harbor.

&quot;Franklin&quot; was attacked during the night of May 19, 1776 in the company of Lady Washington (a small privateer schooner with a crew of 7 commanded by Joseph Cunningham) by British boarders claiming to be friends from Boston; Captain Mugford was killed in action.

The report of General Ward, the overall American commander in Boston, stated:

Captain Mugford was very fiercely attacked by twelve or thirteen boats full of men, but he and his men exerted themselves with remarkable bravery, beat off the enemy, sunk several of their boats, and killed a number of their men; it is supposed they lost sixty or seventy. The intrepid Captain Mugford fell a little before the enemy left his schooner; he was run through with a lance while he was cutting off the hands of the pirates as they attempted to board him, and it was said that with his own hands he cut off five pairs of theirs. ... The Lady Washington. ... was attacked by five boats, which were supposed to contain near or quite a hundred men; but after repeated efforts to board her they were beaten off by the intrepidity and exertions of the little company, who gloriously defended the Lady against the brutal ravishers of liberty.

Mugford had captured a British ship and, having delivered her and her cargo to Boston, he enlisted the Lady Washington to ferry him back to his own ship, the Franklin. A dozen or more British boats attempted to intercept him but arrived too late. Instead they tried to board by pretending to be friendly. Mugford warned them to keep their distance and fired his cannons loaded with musket balls when they ignored him. The attackers split into two groups, with the larger attacking the Franklin and the smaller attacking the Lady Washington. According to a report in &quot;The Pennsylvania Evening Post&quot;, Mugford was killed by a musket ball rather than a lance. After being shot he said to his lieutenant, &quot;I am a dead man, do not give up the vessel; you will be able to beat them. If not, cut the cable and run ashore.&quot; Mugford was the only American life lost in the fight and he was buried in Marblehead, Massachusetts.

==Namesake==
Two United States Navy ships, USS &quot;Mugford&quot;, have been named for him.
