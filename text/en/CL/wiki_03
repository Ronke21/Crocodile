<text>The Domain is a heritage-listed area of open space on the eastern fringe of the Sydney central business district, Australia. Separating the central business district from Woolloomooloo, The Domain adjoins the Royal Botanic Garden and is managed by The Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust, a division of the Office of Environment &amp; Heritage. The Domain is used as a venue for outdoor concerts, open-air events, large political gatherings and rallies, as well as being used daily by the people of Sydney for exercise and relaxation. Along with the Royal Botanic Garden, The Domain was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===

By July 1788, six months after the First Fleet had landed in Sydney Cove, Governor Arthur Phillip had established &quot;a farm of of corn&quot; by a stream which still flows through the present palm grove into appropriately named Farm Cove. Phillip set the land aside for the Crown but did not determine what its purpose would be. He said it should be free of leaseholds but then allowed people to use it anyway, as did subsequent Acting Government and Governors. The site received the first plants and seeds brought by Phillip from Rio de Janeiro and the Cape of Good Hope. Further up the valley of the stream that flowed into Farm Cove, Governor Phillip set aside an open area for the Governor&#x27;s exclusive use known as the &#x27;Phillip Domain&#x27;. It covered the area east of the Tank Stream to the head of Woolloomooloo (Walla Mulla) Bay. By September 1788 were cleared for crops. By 1789 agricultural activity had been mainly relocated to Rose Hill (Parramatta) due to much greater crop success there, and poor soil/results at Farm Cove. The Farm Cove (Woccanmagully) area was then leased out for private farming for the next twenty years. Between 1800 and 1807 grants of land were made under Governors Paterson and others to private farmers in Farm Cove&#x27;s east (Anson&#x27;s Point). The main botanic garden function was transferred to Rose Hill (Parramatta) between 1800 and 1810 under Governor King.

Despite a ditch being dug to define its boundary in 1792, the Domain was gradually encroached upon by others in subsequent years. Governor Bligh determined it should be the Governor&#x27;s Domain in 1807 and the boundaries, especially the southern boundary, were changed. From 1807 Bligh resumed as The Domain, cancelled and converted former private farm grants on the eastern side of Farm Cove to public land incorporated back into the Governor&#x27;s Domain. Farming activity decreased, buildings were demolished near (present) Government House and carriage roads around Bennelong Point and Farm Cove were constructed, along with the planting of a shrubbery and laying out of walks. Bligh&#x27;s attempts to reclaim The Domain was among the many causes of the &#x27;Rum Rebellion&#x27; of 26 January 1808.

The southern part of The Domain was not set aside as a public park until 1810. As soon as he arrived in 1810, Bligh&#x27;s successor Governor Macquarie built stone walls around the Government House garden and the Government Domain, separating them from Hyde Park. The traditional foundation date of the Botanic Garden is taken as the date of completion of Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Road, on 13 June 1816. By 1817 the Domain was completely enclosed and the road system completed including several gates to regulate horse-drawn traffic. The Domain itself was cleared of trees and opened as a public area in the 1830s. Eventually, the Inner Domain, the area closest to Government House, was entirely consumed by the Government Gardens while the area now known as the Domain was then the Outer Domain. Macquarie improved the garden, building a protecting wall on the harbour side and constructing and landscaping a road running around The Domain, north of the Government gardens/nursery at some distance from the shore, and bridging over Farm Cove Creek to Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Chair on Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Point in the east. Swamp mahogany (&quot;Eucalyptus robusta&quot;) trees were planted to line this road, perhaps the earliest &quot;Street trees&quot; planted in the colony. Another 1813–1816 planting was of the black booyong (&quot;Heritiera actinophylla&quot;) west of the palm grove, which remains. On the completion of these works the area was officially inaugurated as a Botanic Garden in 1816. In 1821 the Government House stables (now the Conservatorium of Music), designed by Government Architect Francis Greenway, was completed in The Domain&#x27;s north near Macquarie and Bridge streets.
Despite the Domain being whittled away in subsequent years it remained an important buffer to the Botanic Garden. The native vegetation was cleared and the gullies of Phillip Precinct filled. During the 1830s the expansive green space of the Domain was now opened to the public, who strolled and picnicked there. The Domain west of Macquarie Street was then sold to pay for the construction of new Government House and Circular Quay. Throughout the 19th century, the south-western part of The Domain was gradually taken up by government and public buildings, including the Hyde Park Barracks, the Sydney Mint, Sydney Hospital, Parliament House, the State Library of New South Wales and the Land Registry Office. The Art Gallery of New South Wales was built on the eastern side of The Domain.

In 1831 the public use of The Domain was formally invited by Governor Darling, and became accepted policy (very controlled before that). In the 1830s the Lower Garden area at the head of Farm cove was developed and the shoreline laid out in an ornamental fashion with serpentine paths. Between 1837 and 1845 Government House built in The Domain&#x27;s north (north of the current extent of the gardens).
=== The Domain Cricket Ground ===
Cricket matches, which had been played in Hyde Park since the early 19th century, moved to the Domain in the 1850s. New South Wales had beaten Victoria by three wickets in their first inter-colonial match held in Melbourne in 1856. The return match was played in the Domain from 14 to 16 January 1857 and New South Wales won again, this time by 65 runs.

Although used for cricket for the next 14 years, the Domain was not a high quality ground even by the standards of the day. It was a rough, uneven, open paddock and cricketers clashed with the public who insisted it was public parkland. It was also still used to graze cattle and cow pats often had to be removed before a game could begin. Despite the fact that a game of cricket was a major occasion, often attended by the Governor, and the leading players promenaded with their ladies, the ground was not enclosed and spectators could not be charged an entrance fee.

These continuing problems were well known to those who attended a public meeting in the Domain on 13 December 1859 when the New South Wales Cricket Association was formed. The search began for a more suitable ground and was still going on when the first England side toured Australia in 1862. In the absence of another venue they played a NSW XXII at the Domain.

A solution of sorts to the venue problem was found when the Albert Ground opened in Redfern on 29 October 1864. Although it featured good facilities for players and crowd alike, the cost to the NSWCA of staging matches there was so high that it continued to use the Domain until the early 1870s. In all, six first-class matches were played in the Domain between the 1856–57 and 1868–69 seasons.

===Developments in the twentieth century===


The Domain was subsequently used for military and ceremonial events and evolved as a venue for soap box oratory and political meetings. From 1860 the Domain was opened up at night to pedestrians, allowing people to use this valuable recreational space on summer evenings. It became known as &quot;the Park where the Gates Never Close&quot;. Carriage traffic however remained restricted after dusk for many years. In The Domain gate lodge and gates were built at the junction of Hospital Road and Prince Albert Road, and the Victoria Lodge gate house and gates were built east of the Botanic Garden near Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Point.

The growing city of Sydney put great pressure on the Domain. A major encroachment was the construction of the Garden Palace for the Sydney International Exhibition (1879). Only its gates and some statues remain after a fire in 1882. The site of the Garden Palace was later absorbed into the Royal Botanic Garden. In 1883 of Outer Domain was incorporated into the Lower Garden, completing the ring of waterfront along Farm Cove. In the 1880s the Tarpeian Rock is a prominent, dramatic and significant sandstone cliff landscape feature on the north west boundary of The Domain facing Bennelong Point and the Sydney Opera House, cut for the extension of Macquarie Street. It derives its name from the famous rock on the Capitoline Hill in Rome from where prisoners were hurled to their deaths in ancient times. A stairway gives access from close to the Sydney Opera House to the top of the rock and the gardens. An early carving in the sandstone cliff is located about above the fifth step from the base of the cliff. The carving reads &quot;The Tarpeian Way&quot;. It possibly dates from the time of construction in the 1880s.

Between 1908 and 1916 the Conservatorium of Music was created in adapted former Governor&#x27;s Stables in the Western Domain. By 1916 there were of gardens/Domain. During the 1920s, cut and cover tunnelling impacted the Western Domain to create City Circle underground rail line. Between 1956 and 1959 Outer Domain land was taken by Sydney City Council to construct a car park (now the Domain Car Parking station), with the resultant loss of 47 relatively rare trees, and land. The parking station can be accessed via a moving footway from College Street, near St Mary&#x27;s and other surrounding roads.

A number of significant political rallies and meetings have occurred in the Domain, including Palm Sunday rallies, May Day demonstrations, and anti-war and anti-conscription protests. On 17 February 1935, the Czech journalist Egon Kisch addressed a crowd of 18,000 in the Domain warning of the dangers of Hitler&#x27;s Nazi regime. His visit was organised by the Movement Against War and Fascism and vehemently opposed by the Lyons Government. Kisch polarized Australian politics in 1935 when he denounced Hitler&#x27;s Nazi government and warned of war and concentration camps. During the bitter election campaign following the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 the Australian Labor Party and its leader Gough Whitlam (who had recently been dismissed as Prime Minister by the Governor-General) held their policy launch in &#x27;the Domain&#x27; on 24 November 1975 before a huge crowd. 30,000 attended the gathering, overspilling the Domain.

In more recent years, major transport projects have affected the Domain. The most significant of these was the building of the Cahill Expressway in 1952. As part of this project to build an eastern tributary to the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the small roads to the north and east of the Domain were widened into expressways. After the completion of the project, traffic moving south from the Bridge could pass through a tunnel built into the western part of the Royal Botanic Tunnels, after which it became a sunken road built into the northern edge of The Domain. The road crosses the eastern part of The Domain in a tunnel, exiting through the slope on the east side of The Domain, after which it continues south along the eastern edge of the Domain as the Eastern Distributor. The Cahill Expressway emphatically separated The Domain from the Royal Botanic Garden, and destroyed the close spatial relationship between the garden and The Domain. Between 1958 and the 1960s, the Cahill Expressway resumption and construction work began, dissecting The Domain and Botanic Garden, partly destroying Fig Tree Avenue (first entrance, planted 1847) and loss of 24 palm trees and 12 other trees lost. The Domain and the Botanic Gardens were severed for the first time since 1792. Then in the 1970s, the rail tunnel for the Eastern Suburbs Line was built under the southern part of the Domain: the railway exits the tunnel on the eastern slopes of The Domain, after which (owing to the large change in ground elevation) it becomes a viaduct. Concrete ventilation shafts for Martin Place station are located on Hospital Road. In 1992, the Sydney Harbour Tunnel was built, with its southern section under the northwestern part of The Domain.

===Developments in the twenty-first century===
In 2000 the toilet block in the Palm Grove was adapted and extended to become the Garden Shop, renamed the Palm Grove Centre. In 2000–01 a new police memorial wall was erected in outer Domain to the south of the Art Gallery of NSW. The Conservatorium of Music was redeveloped with new underground extensions, demolition of trial grass beds and incorporation of new roof garden areas to gardens over the new conservatorium. A new land bridge was built (completed in 2005) over the Cahill Expressway/Eastern Distributor redevelopment, linking the Art Gallery of NSW, Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Road, Domain and Gardens, small additional land area and new native plantings to the Domain. In 2002 the Andrew &quot;Boy&quot; Charlton Pool was redeveloped by the Sydney City Council in the outer Domain on Woolloomooloo Bay.

In 2004 new sound walls were built (and their inside face planted) facing the Cahill Expressway to mitigate increased noise from the Cross City Tunnel and expressway into the Phillip Precinct of The Domain. Also that year in that precinct of the Domain, the tree plantation in the Phillip Precinct of the Domain facing Hospital Road was replaced in some public controversy, removing ten previously existing trees and planting 30 replacements (hoop pines, white figs and Washingtonia robusta fan palms) in a triple avenue arrangement.

In its present configuration, The Domain covers and is still a popular venue for Sydney residents and visitors to relax and enjoy views of the City and Sydney Harbour. On any weekday lunchtime, its roads are filled with joggers and its grass used for corporate soccer and touch football competitions.
== Description and features ==
The Domain today begins in the south on St Mary&#x27;s Road, to the north of St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and the northeast of Hyde Park, and ends in the north at Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Point, a headland on Sydney Harbour. It is roughly divided into three sections by a road running north–south (Art Gallery Road in the south, Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Road in the north), and the east-west Cahill Expressway: the Domain occupies roughly the south-west, south-east and north-east quadrants formed by these roads, while the Royal Botanic Garden is to the north-west. From the north-west corner of the south-west quadrant, a small band of parkland extends north along the western edge of the Royal Botanic Garden, leading to an elevated open area overlooking the Sydney Opera House, which is also part of The Domain.

=== South-west: Phillip Precinct ===
The part of the Domain to the west of Art Gallery Road and to the south of Cahill Expressway consists of a large open grassed area surrounded by groups of mature trees to the east and south. It is named &quot;Phillip Precinct&quot; after Arthur Phillip. This area is crossed by several walkways, and has a restaurant called &quot;Pavilion on the Park&quot; in the north-east corner. The public institutions of Macquarie Street, such as Sydney Hospital, Parliament House and the State Library, back onto the park. Being easily accessible from Sydney&#x27;s financial district via walkways through these public buildings, this part of the park is a popular area for city workers to relax, exercise and play sports. This open area frequently hosts meetings and events. During the summer months, a temporary stage is erected in the south of this area, and concerts and other events are held, with the remainder of the open grass area used for seating. The north side of this area is marked by an open-air section of the Cahill Expressway, sunken below the ground level of the park.

Speakers Corner (an area for public speaking) is located in the northeastern part of this part of the Domain, close to the Art Gallery of New South Wales. Officially established in 1878, this area was historically an important gathering place where any person may turn up unannounced and talk on any subject they wish, although they were likely to be heckled by people holding opposing views. This has historically been the focal point of free speech in Sydney. Although now largely disused, the corner&#x27;s role is enshrined in legislation, and a steel platform with engravings commemorating notable speakers still occasionally attracts speakers on Sunday afternoons.

=== South-east: Crescent Precinct ===
The part of the Domain to the east of Art Gallery Road and to the south and west of Cahill Expressway falls in the east via a sharp slope towards the much lower-lying Woolloomooloo. It is named the &quot;Crescent Precinct&quot; after the Sir John Young Crescent that marks its eastern boundary. This part of the Domain is dominated by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, with a neo-classical façade facing Art Gallery Road and a modern extension built onto the eastern slope. near the southern end of Art Gallery Road is the main entrance to the Domain from the junction of Prince Albert Road, College Street and St Mary&#x27;s Road, which features a historical gatehouse. Playing fields occupy the south-east of this area, built above the Domain Parking Station.

The Domain Parking Station is a 1,130 space car park that caters predominantly for The Art Gallery of NSW patrons, The Domain event attendees, and inner city workers, now known as &quot;Domain Car Park&quot;. The Domain Car Park also houses a moving walkway which takes parkers from the car park to the top of Hyde Park. The walkway, or travelator, is 207 metres in length. The Express Walkway features a painted mural, &quot;Tunnel Vision – Sydney&quot; created by internationally known Sydney born artist Tim Guider in 1996. The mural includes one of the world&#x27;s earliest light sculpture installations at the Hyde Park entrance. The mural is painted along both walls for the entire length of the walkway and features Aboriginal and local scenes. The walkway has been the longest continuous moving walkway in the world since its construction in 1961.
=== North-east: Yurong Precinct and Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Point ===
North of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Art Gallery Road passes over the Cahill Expressway, with a narrow section of parkland built over the expressway connecting the Crescent Precinct with the &quot;Yurong Precinct&quot; at Mrs Macquaries Point. In this section, the Domain is a narrow section of greenery bounded by the Royal Botanic Gardens to the west of the roadway and the waters of Woolloomooloo Bay to the east. To the north, the Domain occupies the entirety of the peninsula of Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Point, with Farm Cove to the west and Woolloomooloo Bay to the east. Offering the iconic view of the Sydney Opera House alongside the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Point is a popular destination for tourists and photographers.

Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Chair was carved out of the rock for Governor Lachlan Macquarie&#x27;s wife, so she could sit and observe the passing ships. Above the chair is an inscription recording the completion of Mrs Macquaries Road on 13 June 1816.

The Fleet Steps link Farm Cove to Mrs Macquarie Road. It is named after the Great White Fleet of the US Navy, and was built for the visit of that fleet to Sydney in 1908. It is the point where Queen Elizabeth II first set foot on Australian soil, and a commemorative wall plaque marks the event. The site is often used for large marquee functions, with views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge.

The Andrew &quot;Boy&quot; Charlton Pool is an outdoor swimming facility beside Wolloomooloo Bay. &quot;Veil of Trees&quot; is a sculpture of glass panels installed between the pool and the &quot;Lion Gate Lodge&quot; of the Royal Botanic Gardens in 1999.

=== North-west: Tarpeian Precinct ===

Cut off from the rest of the Domain by the Cahill Expressway, a narrow strip of open parkland runs alongside the eastern side of Macquarie Street and the western boundary of the Royal Botanic Gardens, rising towards the north to encompass the elevated area near Bennelong Point, which overlooks the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House via a rocky escarpment. This area is named the &quot;Tarpeian Precinct&quot;, after the resemblance of the escarpment to the Tarpeian Rock. This relatively small elevated green space dotted with large trees has views from above to parts of Circular Quay, the Harbour Bridge and the Opera House. Government House is immediately to the south-east of this area. The historical sightlines from the Tarpeian Precinct to Circular Quay and beyond were significantly disrupted by the construction of the Bennelong Apartments.

== Events ==
A number of major events are hosted every year in the Domain, mostly during the Summer holiday months of December and January and many as part of the Sydney Festival. These large events occur in the Phillip precinct where a temporary covered stage is erected every November for the summer festival season.

Some of the more popular and long-running annual events that have become Sydney &#x27;traditions&#x27; include the nationally televised Carols in the Domain (held on the evening of the last Saturday before Christmas) and the Sydney Festival trio of Symphony in The Domain (featuring the Sydney Symphony Orchestra), Jazz in the Domain and Opera in The Domain (featuring Opera Australia), held on consecutive Saturday evenings in January. The Tropfest short film festival was held in the Domain each February from 1999 until 2013, when it outgrew the Domain and moved four kilometres south-east to the much larger Centennial Park.

An &#x27;Open Air Cinema&#x27; operates in the summer months near the Fleet Steps. The movie screen sits on pylons in the water at Farm Cove with the audience seated along the foreshore, facing directly towards the Opera House and Harbour Bridge. The screen lies horizontally above the water of Farm Cove to allow patrons to enjoy the views before the movie begins and then lifts to the vertical position for the movie screening.

The Fleet Steps are used since 2012 for annual outdoor opera stagings at the Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, during the months of March and April.

== Heritage listing ==
The Royal Botanic Gardens and The Domain were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. As at 22 September 1998, The Royal Botanic Gardens and The Domain collectively are of exceptional national, state and local significance as:

=== General values ===
* It is one of the earliest surviving colonial botanic gardens in the world and one of the oldest, richest and most extensive early public cultural landscapes in Australia with a substantially intact area and major precincts that are nationally rare from a historic, scientific, aesthetic and social perspective, and which continue to fulfil diverse use expectations by remaining freely accessible and in high demand from a broad community spectrum;
* As it contains three of the most important collections for botanical science in Australia notable for their rarity, diversity, size and scientific value – its living collection which is distinguished by many rare and unusual cultivated plants, the extensive preserved collections of the Herbarium and comprehensive botanical library (scientific/technical and research values);
*Additionally The Domain is of historical and aesthetic value on a national level for its ability to demonstrate its dual role as the prime example of a pleasure ground attached to Government House and as a leading example of a public park developed from the mid 19th century as an early designated landscape for public use (1831) the site was at the forefront of international concerns for the integration of public parks within city planning and development.

=== Primary values ===
* As an important and integral part of the boundaries – from 1792 – of the first permanent European settlement in Australia. It is also an integral part of a large group of early Australian colonial sites located along, and linked by, Macquarie Street, including the largest surviving group of Governor Macquarie-era places in Australia. Individually and collectively these sites have considerable potential to reveal much about the formative town planning, settlement and development pattern of the City of Sydney (historic and technical/research values);
* It contains one of the earliest established botanic gardens in the southern hemisphere (1816); the whole site comprises a broad and idiosyncratic collection of native and exotic plants (8000 taxa and 45,000 accessions) acquired over a period of 190 years for the purpose of scientific study including research for agriculture, ornamental horticulture and industry (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* It contains three of the most valuable assets to botanical science in Australia – its living collection which is distinguished by many rare and unusual cultivated plants, the preserved collections of the herbarium and the RBG library archives (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* It continues, uninterrupted, a close and direct link with the study, classification and cultivation of the indigenous vegetation of NSW from the time of Charles Fraser (1817) and remaining a core function of the institution and landscape (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* The place has strong and direct associations with many notable early botanical explorers and collectors such as William Paterson, John Carne Bidwill, Ludwig Leichhardt and John Richardson; and with their important plant acquisitions still extant in the living and preserved collections (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* It has strong and direct associations with various prominent early directors such as Charles Fraser, Richard and Allan Cunningham, Charles Moore and Joseph Maiden – who were largely responsible for the present overall form of the landscape as well as the content and organisation of the plant collections (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* It has strong and direct associations with many distinguished 20th century scientists – such as Dr Darnell-Smith, Knowles Mair, Robert Anderson and Dr Lawrence Johnson – whose research, using the living and preserved collections of the place and building on the work of the 19th century RBG botanists, forms the basis of contemporary knowledge and understanding of Australian plants. The collections remain an important basis for contemporary research in systematic and horticultural botany and plant ecology by various Australian and international scientists (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* It is closely associated with the history and development of the principal government residences – as well as the Governors – of New South Wales; and it remains an integral part of the historical and visual landscape of Government House and of the archaeological remains of the First Government House (scientific/technical/research and historic values);
* It is a nationally important representative example of a largely intact high-Victorian/Edwardian subtropical Gardenesque landscape design – retaining elements of the earlier Macquarie-era &quot;estate park&quot; – with the capacity to indicate evolving landscape design styles in Australia over the past 200 years (historic &amp; aesthetic values);
* It retains many important components of the various phases of its layout – including paths, fences, bedding areas, plantations, views, monuments, statuary, fountains, walling, steps, other landscape furnishings and gate houses – that give the landscape its distinctive visual and botanical character (historic, aesthetic &amp; technical/research values);
* Both the overall place as well as particular areas within it are highly valued by the community – for strong personal associations and memories, and for providing a sense of identity and continuity of use. The place has been, and continues to be, the focus of important historic events in the cultural and political life of New South Wales (social &amp; historic values); 
* It fulfils an important role as a part of the quintessential setting for nearby architectural landmarks such as the Sydney Opera House, St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and Aurora Place – all having, individually, exceptional aesthetic value. The Tarpeian Rock is a prominent, dramatic and significant sandstone cliff landscape feature of the Domain facing Bennelong Point and the Sydney Opera House, cut for the extension of Macquarie Street and an example of 19th century romanticism (aesthetic value);
* It is an integral part of Sydney&#x27;s scenic harbour landscape (aesthetic value);
* It remains a potent source of inspiration for artists and writers since the inception of the colony; and as a setting for public art (historic, aesthetic &amp; social values);
* Despite various interventions over the last 200 years it is still possible to appreciate the basic form of the pre-European landscape – the two ridged promontories enclosing the central gully (aesthetic value); 
* The place demonstrates changing fashions in horticulture, garden design and ornament, and the practice of botany through its landscape and architectural design and art as it has continued to be developed, reshaped and embellished by successive directors and overseers (historic &amp; aesthetic values);
* The trialling of various plant species – for example Canary Island date palms (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;), brush box (&quot;Lophostemon confertus&quot;) and Hill&#x27;s fig (&quot;Ficus microcarpa var. Hillii&quot;) – within the place has subsequently influenced their popularity and use throughout Sydney and beyond (scientific/technical/research and aesthetic values); 
* As a landscape it has also been the setting for earlier important structures such as the Exhibition Palace, Fort Macquarie, the Crimean War period fortifications, the temporary Federation pavilion and for which some archaeological evidence may remain (scientific/technical/research values); and
* From an early date the place developed, and continues to develop, a didactic role of increasing knowledge and understanding about plants through displays, public lectures, tours and social events based on the living collections and the landscape setting (social value).

=== The Domain ===

The Domain is individually of exceptional value to Australia, NSW and Sydney:
* As an important and integral part of the boundaries, from 1792, of the first permanent European settlement in Australia. It is also an integral part of a large group of early Australian colonial sites located along, and linked by, Macquarie Street including the largest surviving group of Governor Macquarie-era places in Australia. Individually and collectively these sites have considerable potential to reveal much about the formative town planning, settlement and development pattern of the City of Sydney (historic value);
* For its close association with the development of the Royal Botanic Garden and of botanical study in Australia, as the location of early (1788) agricultural, botanical and horticultural enterprise and, since 1848, through the joint management of the Domain and Gardens under one directorship (historic value);
* As a notable venue in the landscape of public protest, both collective and individual, as a place of assembly for the demonstration of concern, opposition and disquiet and in particular, to challenge Government policy and authority (historic and social value);
* As the home, from the 1870s, of the Domain orators – synonymous with free speech, a platform for a vibrant tradition of public speaking of all creeds, beliefs, life styles and political persuasions in the tradition of London&#x27;s Hyde Park corner (historic &amp; social value);
* As evidence of the erosion and alienation of public space under pressure of urban development and of dominance of transport issues in the history of planning in Sydney and a focus for debate concerning the value of public space and the rights of citizens; and
* For its association with sporting history in Australia, as a venue for a wide range of sporting activities including the provision of sports facilities for city workers and firms&#x27; teams, the home of first class cricket in NSW from 1857 to 1871, the first public playground (gymnasium) and, in 1846, as the venue for the first swimming championship known to have been held in Australia. It is also the site of the first formalised swimming in Sydney – an activity that continues there (historic &amp; social value).

=== Historical significance ===
The Royal Botanic Gardens and The Domain also have exceptional historical significance as:
* The second oldest Botanic gardens in the southern hemisphere (officially established in 1816), Rio de Janeiro being the oldest;
* The site of the first attempts at agriculture in the colony in 1788 and a rare example on a world scale where a modern nation&#x27;s first attempts at feeding itself can be traced and seen;
* The site of Governor Phillip&#x27;s farm within the middle garden, still evident in the way the axes of the current beds and paths follow the original furrows;
* A core remnant of Governor Phillip&#x27;s original Government/Governor&#x27;s Domain (1792);
* An important part of Governor Macquarie&#x27;s plan for Sydney;
* The first extensive open space designated in Sydney, and representative of a small group of early 19th century public spaces in Sydney;
* A site of early public recreation since 1831, in continuous public use since;
* Evidence of remnant native vegetation remaining from the time of white settlement of the Sydney area.
* Retention of many important structures and memorials from early Colonial times when the gardens formed part of the original Governor&#x27;s Domain (such as the c.1812 Macquarie wall and gateway, Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s Road, fountains, statues, gates, a varied collection of buildings both public (e.g.: herbarium) and private (e.g.; Victoria Lodge gate house, Superintendent&#x27;s residence/Cunningham Building, Old Herbarium/Anderson Building));
* A beautiful and varied collection of plants, statuary, fountains, monuments, and structures representative of Victorian cultural attainments and garden embellishments;
* Demonstrating a very early example of providing public access to open space or parkland (1831 cf 1850s in England);
* Their being the site of the first zoo in Australia;
* Their being the site of the 1878 International Exhibition, and Garden Palace, a major event for Sydney and the first such exhibition in Australia, featuring works of art and industry.

=== Associations ===
The Gardens and The Domain demonstrate strong or special associations with the life and works of persons, groups of persons of importance in NSW&#x27;s cultural and natural history, including:
* Their association with the work and influence of key figures in the European scientific world such as Sir Joseph Banks, Sir William Hooker and Joseph Dalton Hooker at Kew Gardens, London;
* Their association with the life and works of past Domain overseers, including David Wilson, August Kloster and James Jones, many of whom made significant contributions to the development of the Domain and other public areas in Sydney designed by the Directors of the Botanic Gardens and their staff;
* For their rich heritage of memorials as elements of urban design, including The Domain&#x27;s Henry Kendall memorial seat, the Palace Garden Gates and wall, the Cunningham memorial island and obelisk, the monument to the forces of the Desert Mounted Corps wall, the Captain Arthur Phillip fountain monument and the sunken garden memorial to the Pioneers.

=== Aesthetic significance ===
The Gardens and The Domain have aesthetic significance for the following reasons:
* As a palimpsest of one hundred and fifty years of Colonial and Victorian garden design with some very fine late 19th century landscaping;
* For demonstrating a mixture of early 19th century garden design styles with Colonial style geometric beds in the middle garden and picturesque romantic style features such as serpentine paths and island beds in the other areas;
* Their design as a public pleasure garden, containing many enclosed scenes enhanced with decorative foliage and water forms and providing many enframed views across the harbour;
* For the public role key Directors such as Moore and Maiden played in propagating and promoting rainforest tree and palm species and good design in garden making in the planting of public streets, parks and institutional grounds around NSW;
* Their continuing educational role in demonstrating high standards of ornamental horticulture to the public;
* As an important major defining landscape and recreational asset of Sydney;
* For The Domain&#x27;s role as a contributing and defining element providing continuity in the series of public parklands extending from Hyde Park to the Royal Botanic Gardens, important in the open space network of the City of Sydney;
* Because of the reciprocal visual relationship between the Gardens and Domain and the historic buildings group along Macquarie Street, Hospital Road and St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral. These buildings are part of the setting of the Gardens and Domain, and the Gardens and Domain in turn form a parkland backdrop setting for these buildings, which is appreciated by their users and the public;
* For including a number of individually significant structures of high aesthetic value such as the Art Gallery of NSW, the Domain Lodge and a group of statues and memorials including the Robert Burns statue;
* For their rich tradition of gently curving walls, including the two Macquarie walls, the Farm Cove sea wall, the Woolloomooloo gates and wall, the Government House western terrace walls and the walls that originally contained The Domain.

=== Scientific significance ===
The Gardens and The Domain have scientific significance as:
* Australia&#x27;s oldest scientific institution (1816);
* Continuing centre for scientific research, particularly in systematic taxonomic botany;
* Historic centre for economic botany and experimental horticulture, being a key place for exportation of Australian native plants (most active period of exporting to Europe was up until 1820), and for the importation, acclimatisation, propagation and dispersal of plants establishing many of Australia&#x27;s horticultural and agricultural industries, such as the wine and olive industries and experimenting with many others (opium poppies, eucalypt oil distillation);
* Their demonstration of the extensive international colonial exchange network of botanic gardens in promoting plant exploration, discovery, taxonomy, propagation, dispersal and cultivation;
* Their association with the work and influence of key figures in the European scientific world such as Sir Joseph Banks, Sir William Hooker and Joseph Dalton Hooker at Kew Gardens, London;
* Their association with the work and influence of key figures in Australian botany such as Alan Cunningham, Charles Fraser, John Carne Bidwill, Charles Moore, Joseph Maiden;
* Their rich (c110 species) and early (1860s) collection of temperate and subtropical climate palms, considered one of the finest in the world;
* Their fine collection of trees from the South Pacific and other Pacific regions, including of the family Araucariaceae (e.g.: the genera &quot;Araucaria&quot; and &quot;Agathis&quot;) and figs (the genus &quot;Ficus&quot;).

=== Social significance ===
The Gardens and The Domain have social significance for the following reasons:
* They demonstrate a very early example of providing public access to open space or parkland (1831 cf 1850s in England);
* Their long and continuing role in providing pleasure, edification and interest to the public while at the same time representing key social values such as law, order and social status;
* Their recreational use by the community over a long period and the domain which has traditionally been the centre for political and religious discussion and meetings and continues to provide venues for large public gatherings and entertainment;
* Their being the site of the first zoo in Australia (1860 aviary);
* Their being the site of the 1878 International Exhibition, and Garden Palace, a major event for Sydney and the first such exhibition in Australia, featuring works of art and industry;
* Their continuing role in public education through lectures, demonstration plantings etc. on the value and diversity of plants, their beauty, range, uses and cultivation, and more recently on nature conservation and biodiversity issues;
* Their continuing educational role in demonstrating high standards of ornamental horticulture to the public;
* As a significant site for political and religious discussion and meetings, democratic debate and the expression of dissent, in the Domain;
* As demonstration of the importance placed upon accessible and inalienable public space in Sydney, which dates back to the 1830s;
* As a habitat to a threatened fauna species, the grey headed flying fox (bat).

=== Archaeological significance ===
The Gardens and The Domain are identified in the Archaeological Zoning Plan for Central Sydney as an Area of Archaeological Potential, with the potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW&#x27;s cultural or natural history. It is an area potentially rich in archaeological remains, dating from Aboriginal occupation and the earliest years of the establishment of the colony.

;The Domain Oil Tanks
The Domain oil tanks are:
# a relic of the various construction activities associated with the war effort and with the operation of Garden Island as the headquarters of the Australian Navy (criterion (a) historic);
# associated with the Department of Defence and its operations during World War 2 (criterion (b) association);
# demonstrative of mass and reinforced concrete construction methods developed by the Metropolitan Water &amp; Sewerage &amp; Drainage Board (MWS &amp; DB) for water (and other liquid) storage purposes in the early 20th century (criterion (e) technical/research);
# the only example in Sydney of underground wartime fuel storage tanks (criterion (f) rarity); and
# representative of tanks constructed by the MWS &amp; DB for the storage of fluids in the early 20th century and reflect the then latest development of a construction design dating from the mid 19th century (criterion (g) representative).

;The Tarpeian Way
The Tarpeian Way is of State significance for its prominence as a quarried, weathered sandstone cliff face, with stone steps and iron railing, which defines the northern boundary of the Royal Botanic Gardens and the southern boundary of the Sydney Opera House. The drama, scale and simplicity of the quarried sandstone face of theTarpeian Wall plays a crucial role in supporting the entry point and setting of the Sydney Opera House, where it provides an enclosing &quot;backstage wall&quot; to the open forecourt space. It is considered a &quot;crucial element in [the World Heritage] Buffer Zone . . . including its steps and upper perimeter fence. Although not legally on the Sydney Opera House site, it immediately borders and defines its southern edge and the open space of the forecourt. Because of its scale, location and configuration, it plays a crucial role in the approach and entry experience, setting, and definition, of the Sydney Opera House site.&quot; A substantial rock cutting of the Bennelong Headland, undertaken in 1880 at a cost of , it enabled the extension of Macquarie Street. &#x27;Its vertical quarried sandstone face, with its steps and fence, is an historic artefact in its own right and retains the only visible evidence of activities on the Sydney Opera House site predating the Opera House itself.&#x27; Its traces of anti-Vietnam War graffiti dating from the 1970s are of State significance as a remnant of an important Australian social movement in a major public space. The Tarpeian Way is of local significance for its associations with politicians and bureaucrats who authorised and undertook the cutting in 1880 including Sydney Alderman C. Moore, J. S. Farnell, then Minister for Lands, E. Bradridge, City Surveyor and Mr. Moriarty, the Engineer for Harbours and Rivers. The Tarpeian Way has an unusually dramatic, classical association through its name with the famous rock in Rome from which prisoners were hurled to their deaths in ancient times. The Tarpeian Way is of State social significance for the high regard in which it is held as a dramatic backdrop to the forecourt space of the Sydney Opera House, and as an access point between the Sydney Opera House and the royal Botanic Gardens. It is often used by members of the public enjoying its marvellous views of the Sydney Opera House and harbour setting.

<text>Newsfield Publications Ltd (also known as Newsfield) was a British magazine publisher during the 1980s and early 1990s.

Newsfield Publications Ltd was founded by Roger Kean, Franco Frey and Oliver Frey in 1983. Based in Ludlow, Shropshire, Newsfield published a number of popular computer game magazines from the mid-1980s to early 1990s. This line-up was later supplemented by a number of less successful magazines covering role-playing games, film, horror and youth culture. Faced with financial difficulties, the company went bankrupt towards the end of 1991. This didn&#x27;t spell the immediate end for some of their magazines though. Another magazine publisher, Europress, continued to publish Newsfield&#x27;s flagship publications, Zzap!64 and Crash, for a further six months before the former was relaunched as Commodore Force and the latter sold to rival publisher EMAP and merged with Sinclair User.

Thalamus Ltd, Newsfield&#x27;s sister company, was set up in 1985 to publish a number of computer games on various 8-bit and 16-bit platforms, with a slant towards the Commodore 64. Thalamus initially survived the demise of Newsfield before it too finally went bankrupt in 1993.

Roger Kean, Franco Frey and Oliver Frey operated Thalamus Publishing, an independent book publisher, until it closed in 2009.

With both Roger Kean and Oliver Frey working with Fusion Retro Books in the 2010s, the publisher negotiated with Future Publishing (who acquired the assets in the takeover of Imagine Publishing) to acquire all the trademarks and names of Newsfield. Since 2020, Fusion Retro Books has revived key titles including ZZAP!, Crash and Sega Mega Force.

==Magazines==

===Crash===

&quot;Crash&quot; began life in 1983 as a software catalogue, offering reviews of games and a mail order service. The first issue of the dedicated monthly magazine was published in February 1984. Focusing exclusively on the ZX Spectrum, it was a lively, colourful magazine that soon attracted a considerable cult following. It remained in print, as a Newsfield publication, until October 1991. When Europress Impact took over publication of the magazine, it lasted for a further six months before finally being sold in 1992 to rival publisher EMAP and merged with &quot;Sinclair User&quot;. The May 1992 issue was the only merged issue published. &quot;Sinclair User&quot; ceased publication in 1993. In December 2020, Crash was relaunched as a bi-monthly publication by Fusion Retro Books. Consisting of reproductions of original covers from Oliver Frey, retrospective articles, new reviews and contributions from many of the original team.

===Zzap!64===

&quot;Zzap!64&quot; was launched in May, 1985 as the sister magazine to &quot;Crash&quot;. It focused on the C64, but later incorporated Amiga game news and reviews. Like &quot;Crash&quot;, it had a dedicated cult following amongst C64 owners, but extensive changes prompted a relaunch of the magazine, this time published by Europress Impact. Issue 91 of Zzap!64 would become issue 1 of &quot;Commodore Force&quot;, a magazine that itself lasted until March 1994.

Special issues in digital format were later made in March 2002 and July 2005, the latter celebrating the 20th anniversary of its creation and included with issue 18 of Retro Gamer. The title was revived for a series of annuals, and now continues in an A5 format, available bi-monthly via Patreon.

===Amtix!===

&quot;Amtix!&quot; was Newsfield&#x27;s short-lived gaming magazine dedicated to the Amstrad CPC platform. Launched in November 1985 (although a special &quot;issue zero&quot; was given away with &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Zzap!64&quot;), it offered as much in-depth coverage of the Amstrad gaming scene as its sister magazines did for the Spectrum and C64. &quot;Amtix!&quot; was unable to compete with Amstrad Action, the leading publication for Amstrad CPC users; only 18 issues of &quot;Amtix!&quot; were published before Newsfield sold the magazine to Database Publications, who merged &quot;Amtix!&quot; features into their own publication, Computing With The Amstrad. CWTA was a general Amstrad CPC/PCW/PC magazine, which used Amtix as the brand for its games review section. CWTA later split into three single-format magazines including &quot;Computing with the Amstrad CPC&quot;, and it was CWTACPC which continued using the Amtix name for its games section.

===LM===

&quot;LM&quot; (variously said to be short for &quot;Leisure Magazine&quot;, &quot;Leisure Monthly&quot;, or &quot;Lloyd Mangram&quot; - a pseudonym used by editors in Newsfield&#x27;s computer magazines) was launched in December 1986. It was a bold move for Newsfield, attempting to capture a youth market within the 18-30 demographic with a wide range of pop-culture coverage. The magazine failed to attract sufficient advertising revenue and was discontinued after four issues.

===The Games Machine===

&quot;The Games Machine&quot; launched in the autumn of 1987. It was Newsfield&#x27;s first multi-format games magazine, intended to be a much more informative, serious rival to the popular &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; publication. The first batch of issues attempted to broaden its appeal by featuring articles on non-gaming products, such as remote-controlled cars and high-tech gadgets, but it soon narrowed its focus to concentrate exclusively on games. The magazine continued for thirty-four issues before finally folding in 1990, having been consigned to the margins by Future Publishing&#x27;s more robust &quot;ACE&quot; publication.

An Italian version of the magazine was launched around the same time, which initially translated much of the English version&#x27;s content. It still continues to thrive today as one of Italy&#x27;s best selling multi-format games magazines.

===Fear===
&quot;Fear&quot; ran between 1988 and 1991. It began life as a full-colour newsstand magazine edited by former deputy editor of &quot;Sinclair User&quot; John Gilbert. Newsfield, keen to find publishing ventures outside the volatile computer game market, agreed to publish &quot;Fear&quot; with Gilbert as managing editor. The first issue of the magazine, which would be dedicated to horror book/film reviews and original horror, fantasy and science fiction, was published in June 1988. Despite relatively low sales it managed to survive for the duration of Newsfield&#x27;s business operations, seeing off rivals such as &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot; and &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;, which entered the market midway through its run. Mark Kermode wrote several film reviews for the magazine. &quot;Fear&quot; reviews have been quoted on the back cover of books by authors including Peter F. Hamilton.

===Movie===
Newsfield&#x27;s next venture was &quot;Movie - The Video Magazine&quot;. The market for commercial/sell-through pre-recorded VHS tapes was beginning to bloom and Newsfield decided it would be wise to try to capture a slice of this market. Launched in October 1988, &quot;Movie&quot; managed to attract the interest of advertisers within the video industry, but circulation of the magazine remained low and it failed to make a profit. It lasted for seven issues before Newsfield reluctantly discontinued publication.

===Prepress===
&quot;Prepress with the Macintosh&quot; was launched in September 1989, a trade magazine aimed at the publishing industry. It was well regarded within the industry but struggled to find sufficient advertising revenue until it later expanded to cover non-Macintosh platforms and was renamed simply &quot;Prepress&quot;. After Newsfield&#x27;s closure it was sold to Hertford-based publisher Macro and survived until that firm in turn collapsed in 1993.

===Complete Computer Entertainment Guide===
With their financial resources running low, Newsfield attempted to launch a new computer magazine that would be produced by staff working for their existing titles. Launched in November 1989, it was intended to be a quarterly production, but the second issue wasn&#x27;t published until November 1990. The magazine nevertheless continued to be published until Newsfield&#x27;s demise in 1991.

===Games Master International===
In July 1990 Newsfield took over publication of Croftward Publishing&#x27;s &quot;GM&quot; magazine. Aimed at fantasy role-playing gamers, &quot;GM&quot; had been a successful production with high circulation and strong advertising revenue. Unfortunately, as Newsfield relaunched it as &quot;Games Master International&quot;, the role-playing market was hit by a recession strong enough to force even Games Workshop&#x27;s &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine to dip in sales.

===Raze===
With Newsfield&#x27;s multi-format games magazine &quot;The Games Machine&quot; floundering, the publisher decided to rebrand it as &quot;Raze&quot; in October 1990 and move the editorial within the direction of the new Japanese games consoles, the Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System, which were growing in popularity. Once again, poor advertising revenue and an expensive out-of-house editorial team meant that the magazine failed to reap the profits Newsfield were hoping to see.

The editorial work for &quot;Raze&quot; was contracted out to Words Works Limited, which was headed by Richard Monteiro. The magazine itself was planned to be replaced after its initial 12-month run with two separate titles that would concentrate on the Sega and Nintendo consoles (&quot;Sega Force&quot; and &quot;Nintendo Force&quot;), however, those plans were put on hold when Newsfield entered liquidation in 1991. Content of &quot;Raze&quot; covered the 16-bit computer and console machines, with news on US and Japanese videogaming.

Roger Kean, co-owner of Newsfield Publications, granted the magazine preservation project, Out-of-Print Archive, permission to scan, edit and release the back issues of &quot;Raze&quot;.

===Frighteners===
In an attempt to gain some much needed revenue, Newsfield decided to publish a spin-off of &quot;Fear&quot; magazine. Launched in June 1991, &quot;Frighteners&quot; was intended to be a monthly fiction magazine, showcasing up and coming new talent within the horror genre. The first issue had to be pulled from the shelves after receiving consumer complaints about the blood-dripping cover painted by Oliver Frey, which featured a story by novelist Graham Masterton. Only two more issues were printed.

===Sega Force and N-Force===
With their flagship titles, &quot;Crash&quot; and &quot;Zzap!64&quot;, no longer attracting sufficient advertising revenue or circulation, due to the fading 8-bit gaming market, Newsfield were in severe financial difficulty. As a last-ditch attempt to capitalise on the rising popularity of the new generation of video game consoles, Newsfield planned to split &quot;Raze&quot; into two separate publications, &quot;Sega Force&quot; and &quot;N-Force&quot; (the N standing for Nintendo). However, following an audit during the autumn of 1991, it became clear that Newsfield would no longer remain solvent beyond March 1992. The company&#x27;s directors signed for voluntary liquidation in September 1991.

<doc id="1151624" wikidata="Q158434" url="?curid=1151624" title="Albert II, Duke of Austria">
<text>Albert II (; 12 December 1298 – 16 August 1358), known as &quot;the Wise&quot; () or &quot;the Lame&quot; (), a member of the House of Habsburg, was duke of Austria and Styria from 1330, as well as duke of Carinthia and margrave of Carniola from 1335 until his death.

==Biography==
Albert II was born at Habsburg Castle in Swabia, a younger son of King Albert I of Germany and his wife Elizabeth of Carinthia, a member of the House of Gorizia (&quot;Meinhardiner&quot;). He initially prepared for an ecclesiastical career and, though still a minor, was elected Bishop of Passau in 1313. However, he had to rival with an opposing candidate and finally renounced the office in 1317.

After the death of their elder brother Frederick the Fair in 1330, the surviving sons Albert II and Otto the Merry became joint rulers of all Habsburg dominions in Austria and Styria. Albert was able to further increase his possessions by the inheritance of his wife Joanna of Pfirt, which was made up of the Alsatian county of Pfirt and several cities. Furthermore, upon the death of his maternal uncle Duke Henry of Carinthia in 1335, Albert succeeded in establishing his claims on the Duchy of Carinthia and the March of Carniola, when he reached his enfeoffment by Emperor Louis IV against the claims raised by his mighty Luxembourg rival King John of Bohemia.

Reflecting his high reputation among the secular and church leaders of Europe, in 1335 Pope Benedict XII asked him to mediate in the church&#x27;s conflict with Emperor Louis. Two years later, King Philip VI of France 1337 asked him for help against the Wittelsbach emperor and King Edward III of England. Nevertheless, Albert remained faithful to the emperor until Louis&#x27; death in 1347; he also was a close ally of his son Duke Louis V of Bavaria. After the demolition of Rapperswil Castle by the forces of Rudolf Brun in 1350, the Austrian duke marched against the Swiss Confederacy and laid siege to the city of Zürich, though to no avail.

In Austria, Duke Albert had the construction of the Gothic Choir begun in St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral in Vienna, known as the &quot;Albertinian Choir&quot;. He established the &quot;Albertinian House Rule&quot; (&quot;Albertinische Hausordnung&quot;) to predetermine the rules of succession in the Habsburg lands according to the principle of primogeniture. Although the rule was disregarded after his death, it was re-assumed under Emperor Maximilian. Adopted as part of the Pragmatic Sanction in 1713, the Albertinian House Rule effectively remained one of the basic laws of Austria until 1918. Styria owes him its (former) constitution, the so-called &quot;Mountain Book&quot; (&quot;Bergbüchel&quot;); the same is true for Carinthia.

It has been speculated that Albert had experienced temporal paralysis (explaining his nickname &quot;Albert the Lame&quot;) caused by polyarthritis. If so, however, it did not prevent him from fathering numerous children, of whom six survived childhood.

Albert died at Vienna in 1358 and was buried in a monastery of his own foundation, Gaming Charterhouse in present-day Lower Austria. In 1782 the Gaming Charterhouse was secularized by Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor; at that time Albert&#x27;s remains were transferred to the local parish church. In April 1985 they were returned to the Gaming Charterhouse in a ceremony attended by Regina von Habsburg, wife of the Head of the House of Habsburg, Otto von Habsburg, as well as her son Karl von Habsburg.

According to his House Rule, Albert was succeeded by his eldest son Rudolf IV whose younger brothers acted as regents. However, after Rudolf&#x27;s death in 1365, the Habsburg lands were divided among Albert&#x27;s younger sons Albert III and Leopold III by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg.

==Family and children==
On 15 February 1324, Albert married Countess Johanna of Pfirt, daughter of Count Ulrich III of Pfirt, in Vienna. The couple had the following children:
# Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria (1 November 1339, Vienna – 27 July 1365, Milan), who succeeded his father as Duke of Austria, Styria and Carinthia. His marriage with Catherine of Luxembourg remained childless; upon his death, he was succeeded by his younger brothers Albert III and Leopold III.
# Catherine (1342, Vienna – 10 January 1381, Vienna), Abbess of St. Klara in Vienna.
# Margaret (1346, Vienna – 14 January 1366, Brno), married:
## in Passau 4 September 1359 Count Meinhard III of Gorizia-Tyrol;
## in Vienna 1364 Margrave John Henry of Moravia.
# Frederick III of Austria (1347, Vienna – 1362, Vienna). Died unmarried.
# Albert III, Duke of Austria (9 September 1349, Vienna – 29 August 1395, Castle Laxenburg). His first marriage with Elisabeth of Bohemia, a daughter of the Luxembourg emperor Charles IV remained childless; secondly, he married Beatrix of Nuremberg, a daughter of the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick V. Progenitor of the Habsburg Albertinian line.
# Leopold III, Duke of Austria (1 November 1351, Vienna – 9 July 1386, Sempach). Married to Viridis Visconti, second daughter of Barnabò Visconti, Lord of Milan; progenitor of the Habsburg Leopoldian line.

<text>David Sholtz (October 6, 1891 – March 21, 1953) was the 26th Governor of Florida. Prior to serving as Governor he would be a state attorney serving Florida&#x27;s 7th Judicial Circuit Court and previously as a member of the Florida House of Representatives.

==Early life and education==

Sholtz was born on October 6, 1891, in Brooklyn, New York, to Michael and Annie (Bloom) Sholtz who were both described as being Russian Jewish David was one of three siblings in his family. His father, Michael immigrated to the United States when he was 15.

Sholtz attended Public School #41 in Brooklyn and graduated from Boys High School in 1910. When David was in high school he was the editor of the school&#x27;s publication and the manager of its baseball team. He was a member of the Arista honor society and was the founder of a fraternity there.

After graduating from high school he attended Yale University. After graduating from Yale, where he was a member of the Acacia fraternity, he earned a law degree from Stetson University Law School in 1914. This enabled him to become a Florida lawyer without having to take the bar examination, as Florida then adhered to the diploma privilege.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
With his law degree, he started a law practice in Daytona Beach, Florida. Sholtz entered politics when he became a one-term member of the Florida House of Representatives in 1917, however Sholtz ended up resigning as he enlisted to serve in the U.S. Navy when the United States entered World War I. During the war he had the rank of ensign and served under the Censorship Board being stationed in Key West and Havana, Cuba.

After that, he was a State Attorney from 1919 to 1921 serving for the 7th Judicial Circuit, becoming the city judge of Daytona Beach in 1921. After serving as Daytona Beach&#x27;s city judge he was the president of the Florida Chamber of Commerce from 1928 to 1929. His experiences meeting Floridians from a variety of different backgrounds as the president of the Florida Chamber of Commerce convinced him that he could be elected as governor.

=== 1932 gubernatorial campaign ===
When Sholtz ran for Governor, his platform included increasing government services, free school textbooks, 9-month school terms, back pay for teachers, workers compensation, increasing banking regulations, and more funding for the public welfare. Sholtz had no money for campaign advertisements apart from mailing a few campaign letter, which required him to go door-to-door for donations. He mainly used a flatbed truck with 2 loudspeakers mounted on it while driving across the state. A dynamic public speaker, he rarely used notes for speeches and was his speaking abilities were comparable to Huey Long and while speaking he often gave an impression of authenticity.

His primary election opponent John W. Martin played up the fact that Sholtz was of Jewish ancestry in an anti-Semitic attack on him. It eventually became one of the most significant aspects of the campaign season. Martin even wrote to Germany in an attempt to get sworn depositions proving he was Jewish. Sholtz ended up ignoring the attacks that Martin made on him . In reality, Sholtz was an active member of an Episcopal Church in Daytona Beach. Sholtz&#x27;s victory in the primary was unexpected at the time as most political analysts were expecting either Cary A. Hardee or John W. Martin, both former governors of Florida, to win the primary. The Florida Democratic primary was held on June 7, 1932. In the primary, Sholtz ended up in 2nd place out of 7 candidates.

Sholtz advanced to the runoff election for the primary that was held on June 28. In the runoff he faced off against former Governor Martin and Sholtz ended up winning the election.

During the general election in November he ran against Republican candidate William J. Howey, the mayor of Howey-in-the-Hills. David Sholtz ended up receiving 286,270 votes or 66.62% of the vote. Sholtz also ended up winning a majority of the vote in every county. While William J. Howey received 93,323 or 33.38% of the vote.

=== Governorship ===

==== Overview ====
Taking the oath on January 4, 1933, he became governor during the Great Depression. During his tenure as governor, he established the Florida Park Service and Florida Citrus Commission, passed a workers&#x27; compensation law, mandated free textbooks in public schools, and funded salaries for public school teachers. While in office, he was a strong advocate of governmental restructuring.

Sholtz is considered to be a New Deal Democrat.

==== Lynching of Claude Neal ====
During Sholtz&#x27;s tenure as governor, the lynching of Claude Neal occurred and there was national attention surrounding the incident. Walter Francis White, the NAACP Secretary sent a telegram to Schultz on October 26, 1934, telling him that the mob who had abducted him was planning on burning him at a stake and that he rescue him and put him in a safe location. Sholtz responded saying that he couldn&#x27;t send Florida National Guard troops to Greenwood without the Jackson County Sheriff, Flake Chambliss asking for the National Guard first; which Chambliss hadn&#x27;t asked up until that point. After Neal&#x27;s body was removed from where it was located, most of the mob surrounding him had left but a smaller mob had formed at close to noon during that day. The mob tried targeting local African-Americans that day and the police did not intervene because the mob threatened to beat anyone in the police force it came into contact with. The mayor of Marianna called Sholtz asking for assistance which he granted sending in the Florida National Guard to restore order and the mob dispersed.

==== Other events ====
During his first message to the state legislature he commended President Franklin D. Roosevelt, saying:

Also during his first state legislature message, Sholtz recommended reducing the cost of license tags to what he saw as a reasonable price of $5 along with a &quot;conservation department for the state&quot; to be established. He also wanted to have a balanced and well made budget for the state. Sholtz proposed that income received from car license taxes and a one mill school tax from construction along with the state&#x27;s share of pari-mutuel betting could be used as a way to pay for the school fund allowing for teachers to be paid in regular money instead of scrip. He thought that the money generated from these 3 sources be enough to pay for teacher salaries and textbooks.

Sholtz managed to overcome the strong opposition publishers had to providing free public school textbooks. Publishers thought his plan was &quot;socialistic&quot; and tried to persuade members of the legislature to their side. Despite the publisher&#x27;s resistance he managed to get it. Sholtz countered it successfully and managed to get it passed.

The relief programs he created did end up being popular. Towards the end of his administration, accusations of bribery along with in corruption in the gaming and racing commissions circulated, which hampered his reputation with Floridians.

=== Later life ===
After leaving the Governor&#x27;s Mansion on January 5, 1937, Sholtz unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1938, losing the Democratic primary to Claude Pepper. He spent most of his time in New York after his term as governor, but he retained his residency in Florida. He died while visiting Key West, Florida in 1953 and is buried at the Cedar Hill Memory Gardens in Daytona Beach, Florida.

== Personal life ==
Sholtz was involved in freemasonry being a York and Scottish Rite Mason. Along with freemasonry, he was a Shriner and a member of the Elks. He was involved with the American Legion as well.

David Sholtz married Alice May Agee in 1926 and had three children with her. Sholtz was a personal friend of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was described by those who knew him as having a kind, warm hearted and projecting personality. Sholtz was known to have had a summer home in Henderson County, North Carolina. During visits to his North Carolina summer house, Sholtz and his wife liked to keep a low profile.

<doc id="1151650" wikidata="Q232425" url="?curid=1151650" title="Adelaide of Aquitaine">
<text>Adbelahide, Adele, Adela or Adelaide of Aquitaine (also known as Adelaide of Poitiers; 945 or 952 – 1004), was the queen of France by marriage to King Hugh Capet ( 939 – 14 October 996). Adelaide and Hugh were the founders of the Capetian dynasty of France, which ruled France until the 18th and 19th centuries. As queen, Adelaide had some extent of influence over her husband&#x27;s governance of France. Adelaide is typically only briefly mentioned in connection to her husband, Hugh, and her son Robert II.

==Life==
Adelaide was the daughter of Duke William III of Aquitaine and Gerloc (Adele), daughter of Rollo of Normandy.

On 29 May 987, after the death of Louis V, the last Carolingian king of France, Hugh was elected the new king by an assembly of Frankish magnates at Senlis. The couple were proclaimed king and queen at Senlis and blessed at Noyon on 1 June 987. They became the founders of the Capetian dynasty of France. Apparently, Hugh trusted in Adelaide&#x27;s judgement and allowed her to take part in government. Hugh&#x27;s recognition of Adelaide as &quot;socia et particeps nostril regni&quot;, roughly translated to &quot;associate and participator in our kingdom&quot;, demonstrates his apparent acclaim for Adelaide.

Adelaide&#x27;s son Robert&#x27;s tutor Gerbert of Aurillac came into conflict in the late 990&#x27;s with Arnulf, the archbishop of Reims. Gerbert took refuge with Otto III, the new Holy Roman emperor, and Adelaide attempted to recall the former to Reims, but Gerbert reluctantly resisted this command in a letter dated to the spring of 997, citing concerns for his personal safety and the stability of the French kingdom had he returned to challenge Arnulf for the archbishopric.

== Children ==
Adelaide and Hugh had at least three children that lived to adulthood:

* Hedwig, Countess of Mons (or Hadevide, or Avoise) (c. 969–after 1013), wife of Reginar IV, Count of Mons
* Robert II (972–1031), the future king of France. Crowned co-king in 987, in order to consolidate the new dynasty.
* Gisèle, Countess of Ponthieu (c. 970–1002), wife of Hugh I, Count of Ponthieu.

<doc id="1151653" wikidata="Q5079484" url="?curid=1151653" title="Charles Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin">
<text>Charles Jean Baptiste Collin-Mezin (1841–1923) was a French maker of violins, violas, cellos, basses and bows. He was an Officier de l&#x27;Académie des Beaux-Arts and won gold and silver medals at the Paris Exhibitions in 1878, 1889, and 1900.

He was the son of luthier C. L. Collin, and father of Charles Collin-Mezin, Jr., also a luthier.

The &quot;Henley Dictionary of Violin Makers&quot; gives him a long and glowing report.

== Collin-Mezin’s career ==

Born in Mirecourt, Collin-Mezin apprenticed with his father. Some sources say he worked for a period in the Brussels workshop of Nicolas-François Vuillaume. In 1868 he moved to Paris where he established himself as one of the premier French luthiers of his day. His instruments were considered superior over other new violins.

Collin-Mezin was friends with influential people who helped popularize his instruments. He was also connected to musical luminaries of his day, whose opinions he sought out.

A number of famous violinists played on his instruments, and praised their quality and playability, including Joseph Joachim, Sivori, Scott Tixier, Léonard, Marie Tayau, and Jules Armingaud, who considered a Collin-Mezin equal to a Stradivari for flexibility of sound. The famous cellists Franchomme and Jacquard played on Collin-Mezins.

== Characteristics of his instruments and craftsmanship ==
Like the best French luthiers, his designs followed in the tradition of the famous Italian schools Stradivarius, Guarnerius, and Amati, although he developed his own unique varnish.

* varnish tends to be thick and dull, ranging in colour from yellow to brownish yellow
* they typically have a black outline along the edges of the body and scroll
* no artificial process of heating or chemically treating the wood
* constructed of old wood that was dried naturally
* the bass barring (as well as other aspects) adjusted according to the age and type of wood he used
* his best work is approximately from 1875–1910

His instruments are also characterized by a powerful and unusually brilliant tone, but also possessed a harshness when new. Musical historian William Henley, in his &quot;Universal Dictionary of Violin and Bow Makers&quot; (1959), suggests that this harshness could be eliminated with &quot;many years of strenuous playing,&quot; which would then certainly enable the instrument to be played by an active soloist.

Henley records that “Benjamin Godard&#x27;s &quot;Concerto Romantique&quot; was first performed at a Pasedeloup Concert, Paris, 1876, by Marie Tayau on a Collin-Mézin violin with (what was then an innovation) E and A steel strings suggested by the maker, which rather points to the fact that he is attempting to get brilliance and clearness at the expense of purity.&quot; Steel strings are more popular today, though they tend to be used more by students. (More advanced players and professionals prefer synthetic or gut core strings wound with metal, and an all-metal E string.)

== How to recognize an authentic Collin-Mezin ==
* Many but not all authentic Collin-Mezins have a hand-written signature in addition to a label (according to Henley). 
* Violins with later dates have a &quot;Grand Prix&quot; label in addition to the hand written signature.
* On the side of his original sound posts there is a stamp of &quot;Collin-Mézin,&quot; a copyright facsimile of his signature.
* His labels are not to be confused with the violins of his son and collaborator Charles Collin-Mezin, Jr., whose instruments are also of high quality but priced more moderately. The labels of Collin-Mezin, Jr&#x27;s instruments still contain labels with his father’s name, and indicate that they are “par Ch J. B. Collin-Mézin.” These mention &quot;Paris&quot; (even though many were made in Mirecourt after 1924), and also mention &quot;Grand Prix Exposition.&quot;

== His labels ==

<text>Novye Izvestia () is a daily newspaper published in Moscow, Russia.

==History==
It was founded in 1997 by a group of journalists who left &quot;Izvestia&quot; newspaper with the financial backing of Boris Berezovsky. After Vladimir Putin&#x27;s election as President of Russia in 2000, &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot; became a frequent critic of the new government, especially over the Kremlin&#x27;s influence on democratic freedoms for Russian citizens and the war in Chechnya.

As Boris Berezovsky had fled to London, Oleg Mitvol obtained a 76% share in the newspaper from him, but Berezovsky effectively continued to support the newspaper financially. However, on 20 February 2003, Oleg Mitvol, being the chairman of the Board of Directors (1997–2003) and citing a decision of a meeting of the board kept secret from the journalists despite their 24% share, accused Director General of &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot; Igor Golembiovsky of misappropriation of funds and fired him. The publication was suspended. Boris Berezovsky claimed that Mitvol&#x27;s move was politically motivated, as the newspaper was opposed to President Vladimir Putin and on that very day had published an article by Vladimir Pribylovsky about the allegedly emerging cult of Putin&#x27;s personality.

Several leading journalists of &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot;, including Golembiovsky, in two months formed a new and smaller daily magazine, &quot;Russkiy Kurier&quot;. &quot;Novye Izvestia&quot; was resumed under Director General Valery Yakov, former Deputy Director General, who had been opposed to the dismissal of Golembiovsky as well, but had decided not to leave. However, its criticism of the government became much more subdued.

<text>Fernando Fernández (c.1850–1940) was the founder of the oldest rum producing company in Puerto Rico.

==Start of a dynasty==
Fernández, was born in Bayamon, Puerto Rico. He was the owner of the Santa Ana plantation located in the city of his birth. The Santa Ana plantation is located on land which was granted to his grandfather (whose name was also Fernando Fernández) by the Spanish Royal Crown in 1797. Fernández&#x27;s grandfather was a naval captain who fought against pirates and English merchant ships. The Spanish Royal Crown granted him this land in recognition of his service to Spain, here he planted sugarcane and raised cattle.

In 1804, the elder Fernández used a mixture of sugar and honey to process and distill rum. He aged his product in special barrels which were imported from Europe. The rum he produced was only for his own personal use and that of his family.

In 1821, various slaves from his plantation were involved in a conspiracy. A slave from another plantation by the name of Marcos Xiorro planned and organized a revolt against the slave masters. The plans of the revolt were discovered by the Spanish authorities and never took place.

In 1827, he ordered his 127 slaves to build an enormous windmill shaped like a tower. The windmill helped to extract the juice from the sugarcane. He would still resort to the use of manpower whenever the wind wasn&#x27;t strong enough to operate the windmill.

In 1846, Fernández&#x27;s father, Manuel Fernández (birth name: Manuel Fernández y Martínez), inherited the plantation; Manuel Fernández developed the land which consisted of over . Manuel Fernández eventually purchased much of the property adjoining his land and soon became the richest man in Bayamon.

==Pedro Fernando Fernández takes charge==
In 1880, Pedro F. Fernández, became the owner of the plantation. Fernández imported a still from Europe and started to produce rum using the sugar and honey from his land. He developed two different formulas for his rums and he used the same barrels which his grandfather had used before, believing that the rum&#x27;s unique flavor would be contained in these barrels.

Soon the word spread about Fernandez&#x27;s rum and many friends and nearby families would visit the Santa Ana Hacienda to &quot;sample&quot; the rum. His son went to France to continue his university education; while there he discovered cognac. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, he developed a rum recipe that rivaled the best French cognacs. People started calling Fernando&#x27;s rum &quot;Ron del Barrilito&quot; (Rum from the little Barrel). In Puerto Rico, families began switching from &quot;brandy&quot; and &quot;cognac&quot;, to &quot;Ron del Barrilito&quot;. Fernández also produced &quot;Alcoholado Santa Ana&quot; which is a product derived from alcohol and eucaliptic leaves and is greenish in color. Unlike pure alcohol, Alcoholado Santa Ana does not sting. It is principally used for rub-downs and to refresh the body.

==Edmundo B. Fernández, Inc.==
Fernando Fernández died in 1940 in Bayamon. His great-grandson, who is also named Fernando Fernández, organized the company (which is now called &quot;Edmundo B. Fernández, Inc.&quot;) and continues to distribute two brands of &quot;Ron del Barrilito&quot; and &quot;Alcholado Santa Ana&quot; worldwide. The company&#x27;s main offices are still located in the Hacienda Santa Ana with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico and in the Dominican Republic. Edmundo Fernández&#x27;s office is located in the windmill tower built by his ancestor.

== Freedom barrel ==
In 1942, a single barrel, which is stored in the &quot;cellar&quot;, was put aside with orders that it should only be opened when Puerto Rico becomes a free and independent nation. When and if that ever happens, the cask (barrel) will be taken to the town square in the center of Bayamon and its contents will be offered free to all those who wish to drink from it.

<text>Frederick Preston Cone (September 28, 1871 – July 28, 1948) was an American politician who served as the 27th Governor of Florida.

==Early life==
Frederick Preston Cone was born in the Benton community of northern Columbia County, Florida to William Henry Cone and Sarah Emily Branch on September 28, 1871. His father was a state senator prior to the American Civil War. He received his education at the Florida Agricultural College (precursor of the University of Florida) and Jasper Normal College. Although he never received a law degree, in 1892 he passed the Florida bar exam and began a successful law practice in Lake City, Florida. In 1911 Cone and eight other prominent Lake Citians decided to open a bank. With $50,000 in capital, the Columbia County Bank opened in February 1912 and grew with the community. Cone retained his leadership role on the board of directors until shortly before his death. The bank celebrated its centennial in 2012.

===Personal===
Cone married his first wife, Ruby Scarborough, and the union bore one child in 1902, a daughter named Jessie. Ruby died in 1923. He wed again in 1930 to Mildred Victoria Thompson. He held membership in Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, Freemasonry, Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine and Rotary International.

==Politics==
Cone began his political career as Mayor of Lake City, and served three terms there. He was elected to and served in the Florida Senate from 1907 to 1913, serving as the senate president in 1911. Cone was active in national politics, attending the 1924 and 1928 Democratic National Conventions as a delegate before chairing the Florida delegation in 1932.

===Governor===
Cone was elected as Florida governor in November 1936 and was inaugurated on January 5, 1937. He had just turned 65, and he had problems with his health. Subsequent Governor Spessard Holland thought he was too old for the job. It was the height of the Great Depression in the United States, and Florida was suffering like every other state.

During Cone&#x27;s tenure, Florida A&amp;M University President J. R. E. Lee was able to secure higher salaries for teachers and administrators at the university despite the statement by Gov. Cone, a Democrat and a strict segregationist, that &quot;no Negro was worth $4000 a year.&quot;

At that time, Florida governors held little real power; they were primarily figureheads for the state. The 1885 state constitution severely limited the governor&#x27;s power – a reaction to the bitter memories of the reconstruction era following the Civil War. The governor was just one of seven elected cabinet members; only the governor was limited to a single 4-year term. Political scientist V. O. Key, Jr. described politics in Florida as &quot;every man for himself&quot;.

Many state boards, commissions and departments answered to a specific cabinet member or to the legislature directly. The cabinet as a whole also decided many issues. The governor&#x27;s power was vested in three tools:
*Patronage: Under the spoils system, the governor spent more than half his time appointing commissioners, officers, directors and bureaucrats throughout government, which provided leverage with other elected officials. 
*Veto: The use and threat of legislative veto was used to influence the contents of many bills, or to gain favors, which would be called in for important matters.
*Persuasion: Citizens and the press listened to the governor, who helped shape public opinion and citizens were encouraged to contact other elected officials and convey their opinions. 
Cone was a fiscal conservative and a &quot;hands-off&quot; governor. He generally believed that the governor should not interfere in operation of state agencies or deliberations of the legislature. However, Cone did not hesitate to reject legislation he disliked, using the veto more than any prior governor. The state badly needed new revenue streams, but business opposed a sales tax and a 1924 amendment to the state constitution prohibited a state income tax. Property taxes were the primary revenue of cities and counties, and the gas tax funded most of the state&#x27;s activities. As a result, little was accomplished.

===Accomplishments===
During his term, the Florida Highway Patrol was created, and although Cone opposed new taxes, he funded the agency by fees assessed on driver&#x27;s licenses. To encourage tourism, the state sponsored a 110,000-square-foot exhibition at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair, the largest of any state.
Florida&#x27;s presentation recreated a tropical paradise and included 45 exhibits depicting natural resources, points of interest and the latest discoveries in science and industry.

===Decision===
In 1940 Cone made an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Park Trammell, who had died in office several years earlier. Cone was defeated in the Democratic primary by incumbent Charles O. Andrews, who easily won the general election.

==Death==
After leaving the governor&#x27;s office on January 7, 1941, Cone returned to Lake City. He died there in 1948 and was buried at the Prospect Primitive Baptist Cemetery near White Springs, Florida in Hamilton County.

<doc id="1151672" wikidata="Q310003" url="?curid=1151672" title="Killer7">
<text>is a 2005 action-adventure game developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and Capcom and published by Capcom for the GameCube and PlayStation 2. The game was written and directed by Goichi Suda and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi.

The game follows an elite group of assassins called the &quot;killer7&quot;. The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform hits on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in U.S. politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. &quot;Killer7&quot; features first-person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Snatcher&quot;.

&quot;Killer7&quot; was Suda&#x27;s first game released outside Japan. It initially received mixed reviews due to its unconventional control scheme, linear gameplay, and complex noir plot. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others criticised it as confusing and restricting. However, the game&#x27;s soundtrack, presentation, visual style and thought-provoking story received generally positive responses from critics, were considered as the best aspects of the game and led to several accolades and nominations. Retrospectively, &quot;Killer7&quot; has a cult following, which led to re-releases of Suda&#x27;s older works and the successful launch of &quot;No More Heroes&quot;. A Windows port of the game licensed by Capcom was released by NIS America in 2018.

==Gameplay==

The player controls the on-screen character, a member of the killer7 group, from a third-person view using the gamepad. The gameplay consists of elements of first-person shooter and action-adventure game with restricted movement (i.e. &quot;on rails&quot;)—rather than allow free motion, the game limits the on-screen character to predetermined paths through the environment. The on-screen character moves forward by holding a button and reverses direction with another button press. At intersections, the player may choose which path to take. Progress is made by navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Some puzzles require the talents of a specific killer7 member. The player may switch between available members via a menu in the pause screen at any time; not all personalities may be awake at a start of a mission, and requires defeating a number of enemies before they can be awakened. Other puzzles require magical rings or other items collected throughout the game.

Combat in &quot;Killer7&quot; occurs when the player encounters enemies called &quot;Heaven Smiles&quot;. Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles. While in first-person view, movement is disabled and the analog stick aims the character&#x27;s gun. Targeting specific body parts will disable them; for example, shooting off a leg will cause a Smile to fall to the ground and crawl toward the player. The player may aim for a &quot;critical point&quot; that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character&#x27;s head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends.

Defeated Smiles yield &quot;thick blood&quot; and &quot;thin blood&quot;. Thin blood is used to recover the characters&#x27; stamina and fuel special abilities. Thick blood functions similarly to experience points, and players gain more by shooting Smiles&#x27; critical points. The player may redeem thick blood for &quot;serum&quot; while in &quot;Harman&#x27;s Room&quot;, checkpoints that appear throughout the game. Serum is used to improve the attributes of the characters such as &quot;power&quot; and &quot;speed&quot;. This also unlocks special abilities for the characters. Players may save their game in designated Harman&#x27;s Rooms.

Completing the game unlocks a new difficulty called Killer8 where the character Young Harman (a young version of Harman Smith) can be played along with the original seven personalities. Killer8 is more difficult than the original mode with most enemies able to kill the player with one attack. Completing Killer8 unlocks a comical Hopper7 mode where the first level can be replayed with weaker enemies that wear grasshopper masks, mirroring the logo for the game&#x27;s developer Grasshopper Manufacture.

==Story==
===Setting===
&quot;Killer7&quot; takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the early 21st century. After a treaty ends all international conflict, the world powers destroy all nuclear weapons by firing them into the upper atmosphere and intercepting them with other missiles. This event becomes known as &quot;Fireworks&quot; and symbolizes world peace to the general populace. In an effort to combat terrorism, pandemic disease, and cyberterrorism, the International Ethics Committee (IEC) shuts down all air travel and public use of the Internet. Air transportation is replaced by a system of intercontinent expressways. However, a new terrorist group called &quot;Heaven Smile&quot; appears, targeting the United Nations (UN) and IEC. The members of Heaven Smile are humans who have been infected with a virus that evokes a desire to kill. Factory-produced Smiles are given a &quot;bomb-organ&quot; that allows them to explode at will, their principal means of attack.

In this Earth, Japanese politics are dominated by two parties: the UN Party and the Liberal Party. The UN Party is more powerful and moves to end the Asian Security Treaty and sever ties with the United States. The UN Party seized control of the Japanese government through the wisdom of the &quot;Yakumo Cabinet Policy&quot;, a secret document which details how to run the &quot;ideal nation&quot;. It was written by the Union 7, young members of the Liberal Party who went on to found the UN Party. The US government is also eager to sever relations with Japan, seeing the country as a hindrance and of little economic value. The interaction between Japan and the US is a central source of conflict in &quot;Killer7&quot;.

===Characters===
The player controls the members of a group of assassins called the &quot;killer7.&quot; The group is led by an elderly man in a wheelchair named Harman Smith (Dwight Schultz), who exhibits &quot;Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon&quot;. This condition allows him to physically transform into one of his seven assassin personae:

* African-American Garcian Smith (Greg Eagles).
* Aggressive Irish-American Dan Smith (Michael Gough).
* Japanese-American female Kaede Smith (Tara Strong).
* White British mute Kevin Smith.
* Mestizo Puerto Rican Coyote Smith (Benito Martinez).
* Young Chinese-American Con Smith (Jun Hee Lee).
* Mexican-American luchador Mask de Smith (Miguel Caballero).

These people were gifted killers in life and Harman absorbed their souls through his condition after their deaths. The killer7 were temporarily incapacitated in an incident 50 years ago, in which the members of the group were systematically tracked and killed while performing a job at the Union Hotel in Pennsylvania. Garcian, whose power is to revive fallen personae, became the dominant personality as a result. In this capacity, he receives orders from the frail Harman when his consciousness is &quot;awake&quot; and accepts jobs from Christopher Mills (Bart Flynn), who hires the killer7 on behalf of the US government. Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon also causes Harman and his personae to see &quot;remnant psyches&quot; — ghosts of their past victims. Iwazaru, a man in a bondage suit, and Travis Bell, the killer7&#x27;s first target, are the main remnant psyches who aid them throughout the game. The primary antagonist is an old friend of Harman&#x27;s named Kun Lan (Joe Lala). He has the &quot;Hand of God&quot;, a supernatural power that produces the Heaven Smile virus.

===Plot===
The game opens with a conversation between Garcian Smith and Christopher Mills about a new job for the killer7. The assassins battle their way to the top of a building which has become infested with Heaven Smiles. Harman confronts the source of the Smiles, an angel-like figure, but she is merely Kun Lan&#x27;s puppet. Harman and Kun Lan discuss the current state of the world before the mission ends. In the subsequent missions, the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons. They kill Andrei Ulmeyda (Cam Clarke), a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo, when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus. Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn (Alastair Duncan), his former mentor and murderer, when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an organ smuggling business that targets young girls. Their penultimate mission pits them against the &quot;Handsome Men&quot;, a group of sentai rangers who assassinate a US politician.

The central plot arc concerns the true nature of US–Japan relations. After a volley of 200 intercontinental ballistic missiles are fired at Japan, the US government contracts the killer7 to eliminate Toru Fukushima (Jim Ward), the head of the UN Party. However, an assassin posing as Fukushima&#x27;s secretary kills him first in an attempt to reclaim the Yakumo document for the Liberal Party, believing its wisdom would help the party to regain political power. Shortly thereafter, Kenjiro &quot;Matsuken&quot; Matsuoka (Steve Blum) kills two senior members of the UN Party to become its new leader, under the influence of Kun Lan. In the end, the killer7 defeat the two UN Party members who had been reanimated by Kun Lan as Japan is destroyed by the missiles.

In their final mission, the killer7 seek Matsuken, who leads the 10 million UN Party members who live in the US. The government fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir&#x27;s memories were lost.

Three years later, Garcian, now living as Emir, arrives at Battleship Island in Japan to destroy the last Heaven Smile. He meets with Matsuken, who presents Garcian with a choice: let him live, which allows Japan to mount an assault on the US; or kill him, which lets the US discover Japan&#x27;s role in rigging American elections—US forces destroy Japan&#x27;s last stronghold, Battleship Island, in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map. Regardless of the player&#x27;s choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is Iwazaru, whose real identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle.

==Development==

Development for &quot;Killer7&quot; began in mid-2002 as part of the Capcom Five, a set of games overseen by Shinji Mikami and intended to be exclusive to the GameCube. Capcom produced the games to bring new intellectual property to the video game industry, which the company viewed as stagnant. &quot;Killer7&quot;″s gameplay mechanics were finalized late in development because most resources went to story and visual work. Director Suda51 wrote the scenario based on a plot he conceived together with Mikami, and later decided on the unconventional control scheme as a deconstruction of how gamers play and to &quot;create new expression&quot;. Complex controls and combos were omitted to present a system that fosters easy progression for the player. Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi described the controls as &quot;intuitive&quot; and stated that the team wanted players to &quot;think when they are playing&quot; so they can enjoy the mystery in the story. The long development process culminated in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7). The game was finally released on July 5, two days earlier than previously stated.

A lot of the content in Killer7 was cut due to feedback from both Mikami and internal testing. About 2/3 of the map size and plot were drastically reduced and according to Suda, the cinematics in total was three hours long as opposed to the now one-hour duration. Of all the Smiths in the game, Coyote is Suda&#x27;s favorite because of his backstory, but like with other elements, it had to be cut halfway in development.

Suda51 drew influence from film noir, particularly the theme of multiple personality disorder, and called &quot;Killer7&quot; a &quot;hardboiled action-adventure&quot;. , Peter Saville, and American comic book artists, such as Adrian Tomine, inspired the artistic design and aesthetic. Suda51 noted the inclusion of cel animation in Western and Japanese anime styles was meant to legitimize video games as an art form by competing with traditional art forms in their stage. The game&#x27;s anime sequences were created by Xebec, while the CGI sequences were handled by Digital Frontier. Kobayashi commented that &quot;Killer7&quot; is &quot;styled more as an interactive story than a traditional game.&quot; Suda also drew from yakuza film &quot;Battles Without Honor and Humanity: Hiroshima Deathmatch&quot;. His experience as an undertaker had a powerful effect on the portrayal of death in his games. The game reflects his interest in professional wrestling; Suda51 included a luchador character, Mask de Smith, and conducted interviews and attended promotional events while wearing a lucha libre mask. He named the Smith Syndicate after his favorite band the Smiths. Reflecting on his work, Suda51 considers &quot;Killer7&quot; his proudest achievement.
==Reception and legacy==

&quot;Killer7&quot; received divided reviews and sparked debates about depictions of sex and violence in video games and the status of video games as art. James Mielke of &quot;1UP.com&quot; likened the game&#x27;s high-contrast art style to noir and neo-noir film such as &quot;Se7en&quot;. He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the &quot;quirky scripting and edgy plot&quot; were strong draws, and called &quot;Killer7&quot; one of the &quot;most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history&quot;. &quot;Edge&quot; magazine&#x27;s reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would &quot;[pave the way] for future creative leeway&quot;, crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game&#x27;s limited appeal, calling it &quot;a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman&#x27;s game&quot;. 

Virtually all aspects of the game had their proponents and detractors. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the unity of &quot;great-looking camera work with simple controls&quot; and compared its &quot;thought-provoking&quot; storyline to &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, while a &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer criticized those features, calling the controls limited, the cel-shading dull, and the story incoherent. Kasavin complimented the game&#x27;s eclectic soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and distinctive sound effects, while the &quot;GamePro&quot; reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to &quot;old-school adventure games like &quot;Myst&quot; and &quot;Snatcher&quot;&quot; and commended Suda51 for making a &quot;cult hit&quot;, &quot;erupting with style, mood and undiluted craziness&quot;. Casamassina was also impressed by the quality of the anime-style cutscenes featured in the latter half of the game.

The &quot;IGN&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and &quot;GameSpy&quot; reviews noted the GameCube version features superior graphics, substantially faster loading times, and more responsive controls than the PlayStation 2 version, resulting in lower scores for the latter. Nevertheless, &quot;IGN&quot; called it the 94th best PlayStation 2 game. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; claimed that &quot;Killer7&quot; is a &quot;highly rewarding&quot; experience for dedicated gamers. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; writer Karl Castaneda also remarked that, despite repetitive gameplay, it was &quot;&quot;still&quot; fun&quot;. Charles Herold of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was less forgiving and commented that the lack of new features beyond the first hour made the remaining experience boring and annoying.

Despite its mixed reception, a number of video game publications recognized &quot;Killer7&quot;″s unconventional gameplay and innovative style. At &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Best and Worst of 2005&quot; awards, the game was nominated for Best Story, Best GameCube Game, Most Outrageous Game, Most Gratuitous Use of F------ Swearing, and won Best New Character (Harman Smith) and Most Innovative Game. &quot;IGN&quot; similarly nominated it for Game of the Year, Most Innovative Design, and Best Artistic Design and awarded it Best Adventure Game, Best Story, and Best Game No One Played. &quot;IGN&quot; later named &quot;Killer7&quot; the 20th best GameCube game of all time. The game had a large presence at the 2005 &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Awards, winning Best New Character (Harman Smith).

In August 2005, Jack Thompson, an activist who campaigns against video games, demanded that the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) change its rating for &quot;Killer7&quot; from &quot;M&quot; (for Mature, ages 17 and up) to &quot;AO&quot; (for Adults Only, ages 18 and up). He cited Casamassina&#x27;s review of the game at &quot;IGN&quot;, claiming that &quot;full-blown sex sequences&quot; present in the game would be harmful to minors. Casamassina rebutted that the scene in question involved two fully clothed adults and that a similar scene in a film would garner &quot;only a PG-13 or, worst, R-rating&quot;.

Reviewers quickly identified &quot;Killer7&quot; as a cult game with limited appeal. &quot;IGN&quot; lamented that its experimental style was not conducive to high sales, naming it GameCube&#x27;s Best Game No One Played in their 2005 awards. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Casamassina later placed it fourth in his &quot;Top 10 Tuesday: Underrated and Underappreciated Games&quot; feature. Despite modest sales, &quot;Killer7&quot;″s cult success prompted the development of remakes of Suda51&#x27;s older Japan-only games, &quot;The Silver Case&quot; and &quot;Flower, Sun, and Rain&quot;. In 2007, Grasshopper Manufacture released Suda51&#x27;s &quot;No More Heroes&quot; to critical and commercial success. In addition to an original soundtrack and comic book adaptation, Capcom published &quot;Hand in killer7&quot;, a companion book that explains the plot in more depth. Kinetic Underground, the company that handled the comic book, also released a number of figurines depicting characters from the game. Dan Smith later made a guest appearance in Suda51&#x27;s 2019 game &quot;Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes&quot;. The 2021 Nintendo 3DS game &quot;Gal Galaxy Pain&quot; features a laugh in homage to Heaven Smiles that can be heard during the game over screen and when hovering over the game&#x27;s icon on the 3DS home menu.

===Music===
&quot;Killer7 Original Sound Track&quot; was released on June 20, 2005 by Scitron Digital Contents. It features 55 compositions by Masafumi Takada and 6 by Jun Fukuda across two discs. Takada put a large emphasis on ambient music due to the genre&#x27;s ability to draw in the player. He called his soundtrack a &quot;translation of the text&quot; of the game and sought to retell the story through music. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar praised the soundtrack&#x27;s varied style, a &quot;moody, atmosphereric base punctuated with spikes of manic energy&quot;. She singled out &quot;Rave On&quot;, a track heard before mini-boss battles, as an excellent example of the latter. GameSpy&#x27;s Phil Theobald had similar compliments for &quot;Rave On&quot; and other more subdued pieces that slowly &quot;work [their] way into your mind&quot;.

Takada said in a 2008 interview that &quot;Killer7&quot; is his favourite own soundtrack.

===Comic book===
In 2006, Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing released a comic book adaptation of &quot;Killer7&quot;, written and drawn by Kinetic Underground staff. The planned 12-issue limited series was cancelled after four issues. Players who preordered &quot;Killer7&quot; through EB Games received a special &quot;Issue #0&quot; as a bonus, and &quot;Issue #½&quot; was available at the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con. Writer Arvid Nelson described the story as a &quot;mutant cross-breeding of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino&quot;, and Devil&#x27;s Due President Josh Blaylock commented that &quot;Killer7&quot;″s style was perfect for the comic book medium. In adapting the game, Nelson admitted that the plot was streamlined to maintain a comprehensible story, but noted that the &quot;video game doesn&#x27;t spoon-feed you information ... That&#x27;s how the comic&#x27;s going to be, too&quot;.

==Possible sequel==
Since its inception, fans have been anticipating a &quot;Killer7&quot; sequel. Suda made it clear that it will &quot;probably never happen&quot; as Capcom holds the rights to the IP. In a 2010 interview, he exclaimed that &quot;Killer7&quot; is &quot;part of his soul&quot; and is certainly interested in making a sequel.

In 2012, Suda revealed a new game titled &quot;Killer Is Dead&quot;; word quickly spread that it was a follow-up to &quot;Killer7&quot; since the game shares similar concept with an assassin protagonist, complex plot and cel-shaded graphics. Suda later clarified that &quot;Killer Is Dead&quot; is an original game and has no relation to &quot;Killer7&quot;.

During a panel at 2016&#x27;s PAX East, Suda expressed his interest to remaster &quot;Killer7&quot; and has begun talks with the game&#x27;s publisher, Capcom. On March 17, 2018, during &quot;HOPPER&#x27;S Vol. 5&quot; an event celebrating Grasshopper Manufacture&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Suda verbally announced to attendees that there are plans to remaster both &quot;Killer7&quot; and &quot;Flower, Sun, and Rain.&quot; However no platform or release date was mentioned. Suda later posted on his Twitter account stating that the &quot;Killer7&quot; remaster will be out within 10 years. At the 2018 MomoCon, Suda announced a remastered version of &quot;Killer7&quot; for Windows which was released on November 15, 2018.

<text> (, , &quot;The Businessman&quot; or Commerce Man, often shortened to [[Ъ]]) is a nationally distributed daily newspaper published in Russia mostly devoted to politics and business. The TNS Media and NRS Russia certified July 2013 circulation of the daily was 120,000–130,000. 

It is widely considered to be one of Russia&#x27;s three main business dailies (together with &quot;Vedomosti&quot; and &quot;RBK Daily&quot;). 

== History ==
The original &quot;Kommersant&quot; newspaper was established in Moscow in 1909, but was shut down by the Bolsheviks following the October Revolution in 1917.

In 1989, with the onset of press freedom in Russia, was relaunched under the ownership of businessman and publicist Vladimir Yakovlev. The first issue was released in January 1990. It was modeled after Western business journalism. 

The newspaper&#x27;s title is spelled in Russian with a terminal hard sign (ъ) – a letter that is silent at the end of a word in modern Russian, and was thus largely abolished by the post-revolution Russian spelling reform, in reference to the original &quot;Kommersant&quot;. This is played up in the logo, which features a script hard sign at the end of somewhat more formal font. The newspaper also refers to itself or its redaction as &quot;Ъ&quot;.

Founded as a weekly newspaper, it became popular among business and political elites. It then became a daily newspaper in 1992. It was owned by the businessman Boris Berezovsky from 1999 until 2006, when he sold it to Badri Patarkatsishvili. In September 2006, it was sold to Alisher Usmanov.

In January 2005, published a protest at a court ruling ordering it to publish a denial of a story about a crisis at Alfa-Bank. In 2008, &quot;BBC News&quot; named one of Russia&#x27;s leading liberal business broadsheets.

It has been argued that &quot;Kommersant&quot; strategically uses an ironic tone in its reporting, expressed in &quot;creative neologisms, wordplay, metaphors, and legally imposed euphemisms,&quot; allowing it to maintain a degree of independence in periods of severe state censorship.

<doc id="1151676" wikidata="Q6516845" url="?curid=1151676" title="Pompel og Pilt">
<text>Pompel og Pilt are two characters from a Norwegian children&#x27;s TV show called &quot;Reparatørene kommer&quot; (&quot;The repairmen are coming&quot;), which was created in 1969 by Arne and Bjørg Mykle. It stars Pompel and Pilt, two rather incompetent repairmen, the &quot;moffedille&quot; (which vaguely resembles a mop, eats keys, and communicates through howling sounds and cartoon-style balloons), and Gorgon Vaktmester, a janitor who responds to Pompel and Pilt&#x27;s requests for things to repair with long streams of words rhyming with &quot;repair&quot; and chases after them when they try to escape.

The TV show first aired in 1969, and again in 1973, 1976, 1979, 1985, and 1994. It is a surreal puppet show, and has met a lot of criticism from child psychologists, teachers and others, mainly because of its total lack of logic and pedagogical intent. The reason for the almost ten year intermission, from 1985 to 1994, was that NRK (The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) found the TV show to be unsuitable for children.

The series consists of five episodes, of which the moffedille appears briefly in episode 1, and has major appearances in episodes 2 and 3. It is introduced as the protagonists, the repairmen Pompel and Pilt, sit down on it in the belief that it is a tuft of grass, a misconception that is gradually cleared up as the moffedille starts moving. The moffedille then asks for a key (by uttering a talking-bubble containing a drawing of a key). Pilt, who has earlier found a key, shows it to the moffedille, which immediately grabs it and eats it. It then leaves. This concludes the appearance of the moffedille in episode 2.

In episode 3, Pompel and Pilt meet up with the moffedille again. This time, it utters a big SOS inside a talking bubble. By uttering different semi-mysterious speech bubbles, along with rudimentary body language, the moffedille manages to communicate that it has a key inside of it, that it wants Pompel and Pilt to remove. Pompel, intending to do surgery on the moffedille, produces a saw. Pilt, however, does not approve of this, and suggests an alternative approach, where they feed the moffedille a length of rope, and make it dance. After the dance, they pull the rope out of the moffedille. It turns out that a large number of keys are now threaded onto the rope. One of them resembles the key that was swallowed by the moffedille in episode 2. Pilt takes this key, and the moffedille swallows all the others again. The moffedille then leads the way to a locked door. Pilt uses the key to unlock the door. The door opens, and a migrant (another type of fantasy creature) comes out. The moffedille eats the key again, and leaves.

<text>The Republican Governors Association (RGA) is a Washington, D.C.–based 527 organization founded in 1961, consisting of U.S. state and territorial Republican governors. Its primary objective is to help elect and support Republican governors.

The RGA&#x27;s Executive Committee for 2024 includes Governors Eric Holcomb of Indiana, Greg Abbott of Texas, Greg Gianforte of Montana, Sarah Huckabee Sanders of Arkansas, Tate Reeves of Mississippi, Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Kristi Noem of South Dakota, Kim Reynolds of Iowa, and Glenn Youngkin of Virginia. In November of that year, Governor Brian Kemp of Georgia was elected Chairman, Governor Greg Gianforte of Montana was elected Vice Chairman, and Governor Henry McMaster of South Carolina was elected Policy Chairman.

Its Democratic counterpart is the Democratic Governors Association. The RGA is not directly affiliated with the non-partisan National Governors Association.

==List of current Republican governors==
All of the following states are members of the Republican Governors Association:

In addition to governors of U.S. states, the RGA also offers membership to Republican governors of U.S. territories.
==List of RGA chairs==

==Election cycles==

=== 2018 ===
36 gubernatorial races occurred during the 2018 election cycle. The elections were held on November 6, 2018, with Republicans losing a net of 7 governorships.

In 2017, it sponsored a website &quot;The Free Telegraph&quot; to promote issues from the perspective of Republicans.

=== 2020 ===
In the 2020 election cycle, 11 states and two territories held elections for governors. The elections were held on November 3, 2020, with Republicans gaining a net of one governorship, Montana, for state elections. This marked the first time Montana elected a Republican governor in 16 years. Former Governor Wanda Vázquez Garced, who was a member of the Republican Governors Association, lost reelection in Puerto Rico, meaning a net loss of one Republican governor for territorial elections.

=== 2022 ===
36 gubernatorial races occurred during the 2022 election cycle. The elections were held on November 8, 2022, with Republicans losing a net of 2 governor ships and lost all territorial governorships.

=== 2023 ===
3 gubernatorial races occurred during the 2023 election cycle including Louisiana where Republican Jeff Landry was elected to succeed term-limited Democrat John Bel Edwards and is scheduled to take office in January 2024.

==Fundraising==
In the 18 months ending June 30, 2010, the RGA raised $58 million, while its counterpart DGA raised $40 million. &quot;Unlike the national political parties and federal candidates, the governors&#x27; associations can take in unlimited amounts from corporations,&quot; according to Bloomberg, which notes that the RGA recently received $1 million from Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, the parent corporation of Fox News, and $500,000 from WellPoint (now Anthem).

In 2018, the Republican Governors Association announced that $63.2 million was raised in all of 2017, including $27.2 million raised in the final six months of the year, setting a new fundraising record that significantly eclipses the $52.5 million raised in 2013, the last comparable year.

<text>Salviniaceae (), is a family of heterosporous ferns in the order Salviniales. The Salviniaceae contain the two genera &quot;Azolla&quot; and &quot;Salvinia&quot;, with about 20 known species in total. The oldest records of the family date to the Late Cretaceous. &quot;Azolla&quot; was previously placed in its own family, Azollaceae, but research has shown &quot;Azolla&quot; and &quot;Salvinia&quot; to be sister genera with the likely phylogenic relationship shown in the following diagram.

<text>Brave New World is the thirteenth studio album by Styx, released in 1999. It is the band’s first studio album to feature drummer Todd Sucherman, replacing John Panozzo, who died in 1996 and the last album to feature keyboardist/vocalist Dennis DeYoung. This is the last album that bassist Chuck Panozzo is credited as a full-time member, he would continue with the band as a part-time member. The album peaked at #175 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and reached the top 10 on the Top Internet Albums chart. However, its position on the Billboard charts was the lowest from a Styx album of new material since 1973&#x27;s &quot;The Serpent Is Rising&quot;.

Jerry Goodman who is featured on violin as a special guest, used to play with bands like The Flock and Mahavishnu Orchestra. The album has a strong science fiction theme, as indicated by the album&#x27;s title and song references to the well known eponymous book.

<doc id="1151705" wikidata="Q236459" url="?curid=1151705" title="Julia the Younger">
<text>Vipsania Julia Agrippina (19 BC – c. AD 28) nicknamed Julia Minor (Classical Latin: ) and called Julia the Younger by modern historians, was a Roman noblewoman of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. She was emperor Augustus&#x27; first granddaughter, being the first daughter and second child of Julia the Elder and her husband Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. Along with her siblings, Julia was raised and educated by her maternal grandfather Augustus and her maternal step-grandmother Livia Drusilla. Just like her siblings, she played an important role in the dynastic plans of Augustus, but much like her mother, she was disgraced due to infidelity later on in her life.

==Life==
About 5 BC or 6 BC, Augustus arranged for her to marry Lucius Aemilius Paullus. Paullus had a family relation to her as her half first-cousin, as both had Scribonia as grandmother: Julia&#x27;s mother was a daughter of Scribonia by Augustus; Paullus&#x27; mother, Cornelia, was a daughter of Scribonia resulting from her earlier marriage to Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus.

Paullus and Julia had a daughter, Aemilia Lepida, and possibly a son, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (although he may instead have been the son to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus). Julia may have had the rights of &quot;Jus trium liberorum&quot;, the rights held by Roman women who had three children who survived birth, but some women of the imperial family were sometimes granted these rights without having given birth to three children.

According to Suetonius, she built a large, pretentious country house. Augustus disliked large, overdone houses and had it demolished.

In 8 AD, according to ancient historians, Julia was exiled for having an affair with Decimus Junius Silanus, a Roman Senator. She was sent to Tremirus, a small Italian island, where she gave birth to a child. Augustus rejected the infant and ordered it to be exposed, or left on a mountainside to die. Silanus went into voluntary exile, but returned under Tiberius&#x27; reign.
Sometime between 1 AD and 14 AD, her husband Paullus was executed as a conspirator in a revolt. Modern historians theorize that Julia&#x27;s exile was not actually for adultery but for involvement in Paullus&#x27; revolt. Livia plotted against her stepdaughter&#x27;s family and ruined them, according to some. This led to open compassion for the fallen family. In 28 AD, Julia died on the same island where she had been sent in exile twenty years earlier. Due to the adultery that Julia committed, Augustus stated in his will that she would never be buried in Rome.

==Unusual naming==
Julia the Younger was not a member of the Julian gens by birth: being the daughter of Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa made her a &quot;Vipsania Agrippina&quot; by birth, although there are no contemporary sources that show that that name was ever used for her. She came to belong to the household of the Julio-Claudian dynasty as she was raised and instructed by her maternal grandfather Augustus. Further, Augustus adopted Tiberius as his son (and heir), while Tiberius was remarried to Julia the Elder. Augustus became something of a &quot;paternal&quot; grandfather to Julia the Elder&#x27;s children, too, including Julia the Younger. A &quot;formal&quot; adoption &quot;in the family of the Caesars&quot; among the offspring of Agrippa and Julia the Elder is however only recorded regarding Vipsania Julia&#x27;s brothers Gaius Vipsanius Agrippa—hence Gaius Julius Caesar—and Lucius Vipsanius Agrippa—hence Lucius Julius Caesar. Her younger sister Agrippina the Elder and youngest full brother, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa Postumus, were named after their natural father only until Agrippa Postumus was adopted by Augustus as &quot;Agrippa Julius Caesar&quot;. Likewise, her eldest half-sisters, Vipsania Agrippina, Vipsania Attica, Vipsania Marcella and Vipsania Marcellina, were named after their father. Her younger half-brother, unnamed in contemporary sources, was later sometimes dubbed &quot;Tiberillus,&quot; after his father Tiberius, and died young.

== Literature ==

* Julia the Younger is the primary character in Tana Rebellis&#x27;s &quot;The Longest Exile&quot; (2024), exploring Julia&#x27;s life and exile from 8 to 14 CE. It also includes chapters from the points of view of her mother, Julia the Elder, as well as her brother Agrippa Postumus and the poet Ovid.

<doc id="1151715" wikidata="Q229407" url="?curid=1151715" title="Adela of Champagne">
<text>Adela of Champagne (; – 4 June 1206), also known as Adelaide, Alix and Adela of Blois, was Queen of France as the third wife of Louis VII. She was regent of France from 1190 to 1191 while her son Philip II participated in the Third Crusade.

==Early life==

Adela was the third child and first daughter of Theobald II, Count of Champagne and Matilda of Carinthia, and had nine brothers and sisters. She was named after her paternal grandmother Adela of Normandy. When Louis VII&#x27;s second wife, Constance of Castile, died in childbirth in 1160, he was devastated and became convinced that he would die young as well, fearing that the country would fall into chaos as he had no male heir. As he was desperate for a son, King Louis married 20-year-old Adela of Champagne five weeks later, on 13 November 1160. Adela&#x27;s coronation was held the same day. She went on to give birth to Louis VII&#x27;s only son, Philip II, and to the future Byzantine empress Agnes.

==Queenship==
The marriage between Adela and Louis VII served as a peace treaty between King Louis and one of his most rebellious vassals, Theobald II of Champagne, a powerful feudal lord. At the time of the marriage, the king was still mourning the death of his Spanish wife. This grief was very public on the part of the king, but Adela was praised greatly for conquering his heart &quot;bit by bit&quot;. It took five years for Adela to give birth to Louis VII&#x27;s only son, the future Philip Augustus, also called Philip &quot;Dieu-Donne&quot; or &quot;God-given&quot; because his birth was long-awaited by a kingdom that had enjoyed a long unbroken lineage of undisputed male heirs to the throne. Philip&#x27;s birth meant the continuing rule of Capetian monarchs in France.

Adela was active in the political life of the kingdom, along with her brothers Henry I, Theobald V, and William of the White Hands. Henry and Theobald were married to daughters of Louis VII and his first wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Adela and her brothers kept their political power base after the succession of her son to the throne in September 1180. She initially attempted to assume regency in a potential minor regency, as her son the king was only fifteen years old, but as he was deemed to be old enough to rule on his own, she did not succeed.

==Widowhood==
Adela and her brothers, Henry I of Champagne, Theobald V of Blois, Stephen I of Sancerre, and William White Hands, felt their position threatened when the heiress of Artois, Isabella of Hainault, married Adela&#x27;s son Philip in April 1180. Adela formed an alliance with Hugh III of Burgundy and Philip I of Flanders, and even tried to interest Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. War broke out in 1181, and relations became so bad that Philip attempted to divorce Isabella in 1184. He called a council at Sens for the purpose of repudiating her. According to Gislebert of Mons, Isabella then appeared barefooted and dressed as a penitent in the town&#x27;s churches to gain public support, which convinced Philip to change his mind. He gradually developed genuine respect and love for Isabella and was devastated by her early death in March 1190.

Philip appointed Adela as regent of France several months later before he left the country on the Third Crusade. She acted as regent for her son together with the arch bishop of Reims from the departure of her son in 1190 until his return in 1191. She participated in the founding of many abbeys.

Queen Adela died on 4 June 1206 in Paris and was buried in the church of Pontigny Abbey near Auxerre. Upon learning of her death, Philip reportedly refused to speak to anyone for two days afterwards.

FourPlay&#x27;s members include brothers Tim Hollo (violin and viola) and Peter Hollo (cello), Lara Goodridge (violin and vocals) and Shenzo Gregorio (viola); former members include: Veren Grigorov (viola) &amp; Chris Emerson (viola). Although all members of FourPlay had formal classical training, the band play an eccentric form of rock music, with subtle influences from three of the four band members&#x27; Jewish heritage (although FourPlay regard themselves as an Australian band above all else) as well as gypsy, pop, folk, hip-hop, electronica, post-rock, folktronica and many other forms.

==History==
FourPlay&#x27;s first album, &quot;Catgut Ya&#x27; Tongue?&quot; was released in 1998, and featured mostly covers (of bands including Metallica and Depeche Mode, and the theme from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;), along with a few original compositions. In late 1999, Emerson left to get married in England and was replaced by Veren Grigorov. FourPlay released their second album, &quot;The Joy Of...&quot; in 2000, which included, among other things, a two-part dub/klezmer composition, a distortion-heavy cover of Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s &quot;Ich Bin Ein Auslander&quot;, and a gypsy-style instrumental ending with a mass scream. This was followed, a year later (2001), by a 2-disc remix compilation, &quot;Digital Manipulation&quot;, featuring work by many Australian musicians, including Machine Translations, B(if)tek and Darrin Verhagen. FourPlay have also toured abroad extensively, and supported artists including george and The Whitlams.

In 2004, Grigorov was replaced by Shenton Gregory aka Shenzo Gregorio, renowned stunt violinist from Brisbane. Shenzo&#x27;s personality and style meshed perfectly into FourPlay, and he took to the viola instantly. A highly fertile period of new composition resulted in many new originals, as well as covers of Radiohead, The Strokes, and various jazz/blues numbers. These were recorded in the latter half of 2005 and appear on &quot;Now To The Future&quot;, released in June 2006.

In July 2009, &quot;Fourthcoming,&quot; their fourth album, was released. Most of the tracks were written 3 years prior. Recorded live at the Street Theatre in Canberra over three small gigs. Like the previous three albums, Fourthcoming contains a number of covers. Rage Against the Machine, Leonard Cohen and Sufjan Stevens. A number of the original songs contain politically charged lyrics. The track &quot;A Grain of Truth&quot; was inspired by the AWB (Australian Wheat Board) scandal. The track &quot;Where The Sun Don&#x27;t Shine&quot; was written in response to the former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard&#x27;s sustainable energy policy for the 2007 election. The track &quot;Rudd-a-dub Dub&quot; refers to the then-current Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd.

In August 2010, the band collaborated with author Neil Gaiman and comics author/artist Eddie Campbell at the inaugural Graphic festival at the Sydney Opera House, composing a 70-minute accompaniment to Gaiman&#x27;s novella &quot;The Truth is a Cave in the Black Mountains&quot;. The twelve year long collaboration between Mr. Gaiman and the Fourplay String Quartet culminated in the 2023 record &quot;Signs of Life&quot;.

Bapu&#x27;s 2011 film, &quot;Sri Rama Rajyam&quot;, had a special screening at International Film Festival of India on 28 November 2011.

In 1996, he appeared in the Doordarshan Documentary &quot;Eminent Cartoonists of India&quot;, and was awarded Lifetime Achievement from Indian Institute of Cartoonists in 2001. He gained international recognition through his art works viz., &quot;Bapu Bomma&quot;, &quot;The Navarasas&quot;, and the &quot;Indian Dances&quot; etc., which were held at the National Film Theatre, London, in 1978 and at the innumerable Telugu Conferences in the United States. He has worked as a graphic artist for &quot;J Walter Thomson&quot;, &quot;Efficient Publicities&quot; and &quot;F. D. Stewarts&quot;, Chennai.

In 1964, he was a delegate at the UNESCO sponsored seminar in Bangalore on &quot;Children&#x27;s Books&quot;. The same year, he gave demonstrations for the training course programme on book illustrations and cover designs sponsored by UNESCO in Chennai. In the 1960s he has served as art Consultant for Ford Foundation sponsored &quot;The Southern Language Book Trust&quot;. He has designed and illustrated several books for leading publishers in South India out of which, five received Government Awards. He has also done the same for innumerable works drawn from Puranas and folklore.

==Early life and background==
Bapu was born on 15 December 1933, in Narsapuram, in present-day West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh, India to Sattiraju Venugopala Rao and Suryakantam. He has worked as a political cartoonist for the newspaper &quot;Andhra Patrika&quot; in 1945. He holds B.Com (1953) and BL (1955) from University of Madras.

==Painting==

Bapu&#x27;s paintings focus on Hindu mythological characters, and he has painted the Hindu epic Ramayana as a pictorial story. His character portrayals, such as Shiva, Bhima, Duryodhana, look distinctly male with wide chests, large jaws and large biceps; while Krishna and Rama are more feminine in build.

His paintings have decorated the cover pages of many magazines in India and Abroad. Telugu Naadi Magazine published from US for Telugu audience have published Bapu&#x27;s great paintings. Bapu also later served on their advisory board to guide and have an outstanding content for the magazine that catered to Telugu people.

==Association with Ramana==
Bapu&#x27;s family was staying in Madras and in 1942, when the Japanese bombed Madras, there was a panic exodus and Bapu&#x27;s family moved to Narasapuram and stayed there till 1945, when the Second World War ended. Bapu studied in Taylor High School, Narasapuram during these years.

Mullapudi Venkataramana&#x27;s father, who was working as a Sub-Registrar was posted at Narasapuram during the years 1942-45 and so, Venkataramana also studied in Taylor high School, Narasapram, during those years. They were classmates during those three years and that is how their association started. They continued schooling at Kesari High School, Madras. Ramana&#x27;s first short story &#x27;Amma Maata Vinakapote&#x27; was published in 1945 in &#x27;Bala&#x27;, a children&#x27;s magazine published by Radio Annayya (Nyayapathi Raghava Rao), he was 14 then. Bapu illustrated the story. That was the beginning of their career as a writer-producer -illustrator- filmmaker duo&quot;.

Started as an illustrator-story writer team and then turning into a film-director-writer duo, they have contributed immensely to the enrichment of Telugu cultural ethos through literature and cinema. When one mentions Bapu, then one is bound to mention Ramana&#x27;s name too and vice versa. The most notable achievement in his movie making is his success in capturing the nativity of Telugu people and translating it great on-screen visuals.

Ventures like &quot;Sampoorna Ramayanam&quot;, &quot;Ramanjaneya Yuddham&quot; and &quot;Seeta Kalyanam&quot; have been the milestones of Telugu cinema, while historical films like &quot;Thyagayya&quot;, &quot;Bhakta Kannappa&quot; and &quot;Shreenatha kavisarvabhouma&quot; have been hugely successful. Bapu-Ramana combination has created movie magic on the large screen with some of the path breaking films in Telugu cinema and are ever remembered for films like &quot;Radha kalyanam&quot;, &quot;Velugu needalu&quot;, &quot;Bharyabhartalu&quot;, &quot;Bhogimanta&quot;, &quot;Mutyala Muggu&quot;, &#x27;Sakshi&quot;, &quot;Mr. Pellam&#x27;, &quot;Pelli Pustakam&quot;. The duo directed Mana Voori Pandavulu (1978) which won the Filmfare Award for Best Film - Telugu.

<text>King Biryu (died 344, r. 304–344) was the eleventh king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea.

==Background==
He was the second son of the 6th king King Gusu and the younger brother of the 7th king Saban. However, since this would make him rule until at least the age of 110, modern historians commonly assume that Biryu was in fact the son or grandson of Saban&#x27;s younger brother. After the preceding king Bunseo was assassinated in the 7th year of his reign in 304 by Chinese agents, Biryu ascended to the throne because Bunseo&#x27;s sons were deemed too young to rule. This appears to have been part of a power struggle between the two branches of the Baekje royal family, the descendants of the 5th king Chogo (Biryu&#x27;s ancestor) and that of the 8th king Goi.

The &quot;Samguk sagi&quot; records that &quot;his character was generous and benevolent, and he was powerful and skilled with a bow. For a long time, he resided among the people, and he was praised far and wide. After the death of Bunseo, all his children were too young to succeed. Therefore, at the recommendation of the ministers and people, he took the throne&quot;.

==Reign==
In 312, he appointed Hae Gu to head the military. In 327, he stopped a rebellion by his half-brother Buyeo Ubok. In 337, he received a mission from the neighboring Silla.

Samguk sagi:
* 308 AD, spring, first month, first day of the year. There was a solar eclipse.
* 312 AD, spring, second month. The king sent ministers to make a tour and listen to the grievances of the people. The widowed and alone could not provide for themselves, and they were given three sok of grain. Summer, fourth month. The king visited Dongmyeong shrine. Bae Hae Gu was made Minister of the Military.
* 313 AD, spring, first month. Sacrifices were made to heaven and earth in south of the city. The king himself slew the animals.
* 316 AD, spring. There was a drought. A great star shot in the west. Summer, fourth month. The wells of the capital overflowed. A black dragon was seen inside of it.
* 320 AD, autumn, eighth month. A tower for shooting was made in the west of the palace. Every month on the first day of the month, he practiced shooting.
* 321 AD, spring, first month. The king&#x27;s half-brother, Buyeo Ubok, was made Minister of the Interior. Autumn, seventh month. Venus was seen during the day. In the south of the country, locusts damaged the grain.
* 325 AD, winter, tenth month. There was a sound in heaven like the wind and the waves were smashing against each other. 11th month. The king went hunting north of Guwon and shot a deer.
* 327 AD, autumn, seventh month. There was a cloud like a red crow that came toward the sun. Ninth month. The Minister of the Interior, Buyeo Ubok, took control of the fortresses north of the Han River and rebelled. The king dispatched soldiers to attack him.
* 331 AD, In the spring and summer, there was a great drought. The grass and trees withered, and the rivers ran dry until autumn, when it rained in the seventh month. That year there was a famine, and there were incidents of cannibalism.
* 333 AD, summer, fifth month. A star fell. There was a fire in the king&#x27;s palace. It spread to the houses of the people. Autumn, seventh month. They repaired the palace. Bae Jin Yi was made Minister of the Interior. Winter, 12th month. There was thunder.
* 335 AD, winter, first day of the month. There was a solar eclipse.
* 336 AD, spring, first month. On &quot;辛巳&quot;, a comet was seen in Kui, one of the 28 lunar mansions.
* 337 AD, spring, second month. Silla dispatched messengers with gifts for the court.
* 344 AD, winter, tenth month. The king died.

==Legacy==
He was father of the 13th king King Geunchogo who would become the most famous of all of the kingdom&#x27;s monarchs bringing Baekje to its pinnacle of power.

Japanese historians suspect Biryu, like Saban, as the progenitor of certain aristocratic clans of Yamato period Japan. Any genealogical records either did not exist or have been lost/destroyed for over a millennium.

==Popular culture==
* Portrayed by Yoon Seung-won in the 2010–2011 KBS1 TV series &quot;The King of Legend&quot;.

==Family==
* Father: Gusu of Baekje, because of date discrepancies most scholars believe he is not a son but a descendant.
*Consorts and their respective issue(s):
#Queen, of the Hae clan (解氏)
## Buyeo Chan
## Buyeo Hwi
## Buyeo San
#Queen, of the Jin clan (眞氏)
## Buyeo Gu (扶餘句, 324–375) – 13th King of Baekje, Geunchogo of Baekje.
## Buyeo Mong
*Others: 
** Buyeo Sai (扶餘沙伊, ?–234) – first son, 7th King of Baekje, Saban of Baekje
** Buyeo Ubok (扶餘優福, ?–?) – in 321 he was appointed Minister of the Interior (&quot;Naesin-jwa&#x27;pyeong&quot;, 內臣佐平) and in 327 he rebelled against his half-brother, the king.

<doc id="1151726" wikidata="Q965085" url="?curid=1151726" title="Being Human (1994 film)">
<text>Being Human is a 1994 comedy-drama film written and directed by Bill Forsyth and starring Robin Williams, John Turturro, Bill Nighy, Vincent D&#x27;Onofrio, Robert Carlyle, Theresa Russell and Ewan McGregor in his feature-film debut. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and Japan, the film portrays the experience of a single human soul, portrayed by Williams, through various incarnations. Williams is the only common actor throughout the stories that span man&#x27;s history on Earth.

An attempt on director-screenwriter Bill Forsyth&#x27;s part to depict by visual means the ordinariness of life throughout the ages, &quot;Being Human&quot; is deliberately slow in its pace to emphasize how slow life often is. The structure is one of vignette-like character studies of one man (actually five distinct men, all with the same soul) who keeps making the same relationships and mistakes throughout his lifetimes.

== Plot ==
In the first incarnation, a caveman&#x27;s family is taken from him by raiders, due to his cowardice and hesitation. Before his wife is taken away, she shouts, &quot;Don&#x27;t lose the children!&quot;.

The next incarnation is in ancient Rome, where he, Hector, is a slave to a &quot;foolish master&quot; who loses his fortune and is compelled by his creditors to kill himself, and he orders Hector to join him. Hector longs to be free to find the children and wife he had before he became a slave, but he has fallen in love with another slave and forgets his waiting family.

In the third incarnation, Hector is a Scottish crusader on his way home to his children. The soul of his master from his life in Rome is now a crusader trying to decide whether to become a priest. They travel together until Hector finds his soul mate from the life in Rome. She is a widow and wishes for Hector to join her family, but his duties to his children in Scotland pull at him.

In the fourth incarnation, Hector is finally forced to confront his capacity for cowardly indecision. He is a Portuguese man in the Renaissance shipwrecked on the coast of Africa. He is the master in this life, his wife from the first incarnation shipwrecked with him as his spurned lover, and the raider who spirited her away is her steadfast friend.

In the fifth incarnation, Hector is a modern man in New York, paying the consequences of cowardly indecision, and gaining the strength to address the children who he lost lifetimes ago. He is joined in this life by his master/slave/friend/soul mate, and ex-wife, Janet, and her husband/raider from lifetimes past. They support him, but they are people who are trying to find their own way, as in the past lives.

== Cast ==
==Production==
The film had a very problematic production, mainly due to financial issues and the ambition of Forsyth&#x27;s screenplay. After poor test screenings, Warner Bros. instructed Bill Forsyth to trim 40 minutes from the film, as well as add narration and a happy ending. Forsyth subsequently disowned the film.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
Despite the changes, the film was still not well received on release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 54% rating, based on 13 reviews.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film an &quot;F&quot;, and said that the film &quot;demonstrates what can happen when a director with a gossamer comic touch tries to become commercial—the movie is so flat and banal it&#x27;s like a Mel Brooks parody in which someone forgot to put in the jokes&quot;.

Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was more positive, declaring, &quot;Aiming high and falling short of his own mark, Mr. Forsyth remains a film maker of vivid, unpredictable imagination.&quot;

<doc id="1151728" wikidata="Q5648110" url="?curid=1151728" title="Sucia Island">
<text>Sucia Island () is located north of Orcas Island in the San Juan Islands, San Juan County, Washington, United States. It is the largest of an archipelago of ten islands including Sucia Island, Little Sucia, Ewing, Justice, Herndon, the Cluster Islands islets, and several smaller, unnamed islands. The group of islands is about in length and just short of a half mile wide. Sucia island is roughly the shape of a hand. The total land area of all islands is . The main island of Sucia Island by itself is . There was a permanent population of four persons as of the 2000 census, all on Sucia Island. Sucia Island State Park is a Washington State Marine Park.

==History==
Sucia Island&#x27;s name originated with the Spanish Captain Francisco de Eliza, on his map of 1791. He named it &quot;Isla Sucia&quot;. Sucia in Spanish means &quot;dirty&quot; or in a nautical sense &quot;foul&quot;. This word was chosen because the shore was deemed dangerous due to reefs and hidden rocks.

These reefs and broken shorelines are from a geologic folding of the Earth&#x27;s crust, which brought many interesting marine fossils to the surface. Some good examples can be found on the southeast arm of Sucia Island.

The isolated coves and bays of Sucia Island once served the Lummi Indians in their seal hunting days. They later provided excellent hideouts in the 19th century for smugglers of illegal Chinese laborers, as well as for hiding illegally imported wool and opium. Still later, the islands played a large role in rum-running during liquor Prohibition of the 1920s and 1930s, and in recent years they have figured in drug trafficking.

The first known Euro-American settler on the island was Charles Henry Wiggins, who moved to the island in the 1880s with his wife, Mary Luzier, a Cowlitz Indian. The Wiggins family had lived previously on nearby Waldron Island, but left for Sucia after government agents seized eight of their children and took them to Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Oregon. The couple had five more children on Sucia and established a farm with fruit trees, cows and sheep. Wiggins Head at the southeast end of the island is named for the family.

The cluster of Sucia Islands was purchased in 1960 by the Puget Sound Interclub Association and later donated to the State of Washington for protection as a Marine State Park.

In 2012, paleontologists Christian Sidor and Brandon Peecock discovered a fossilized femur bone from a theropod dinosaur on the island&#x27;s shore. This was the first dinosaur fossil discovered in Washington state. Given the lack of other fossils from the dinosaur, it&#x27;s unclear exactly which species of theropod the bone came from.

==Activities==

*Camping
*Birdwatching
*Hiking
*Rock Climbing
*Kayaking
*Fishing
*Scuba diving
*Crabbing
These activities can be accessed from Sucia Island State Park and the Echo Bay Campground.

==Anchorages==

===Shallow Bay===

Shallow Bay on the island&#x27;s west side is protected from all but westerly winds and waves. There are seven mooring buoys and room for 40-50 small pleasure craft in this anchorage. There are beaches on three sides including a sandy beach to the north. Pebble Beach in the center is the access point to the camping and moorage pay box, as well as a large group camping site with a covered eating area and environmentally friendly composting out-houses. True to its name, Shallow Bay averages deep. The anchor holding is good in sand but may be more rocky towards the center and mouth of the bay.

===Echo Bay===

Echo Bay is directly opposite the island&#x27;s narrow isthmus from Shallow Bay and the largest of the anchorages, and the most exposed, particularly to southeast winds. There are a number of mooring buoys close to a pebble beach.

===Fossil Bay===

Fossil Bay is one of the most popular anchorages, particularly for small boats that prefer to tie up to one of two docks rather than anchor or pick up a mooring ring. Fossil Bay is an inlet that opens to the southeast.

===Fox Cove===
Fox Cove lies just west of and can be seen from Fossil Bay. Fox Cove is bordered by Ev Henry Finger point and Little Sucia island.

===Ewing Cove===
Ewing Cove is between the northeast end of Sucia island and Ewing Island. There is room for several boats at anchor or at a mooring buoy. The pebble beach at Ewing Cove is at the end of a trail to the center of the island.

<doc id="1151730" wikidata="Q784092" url="?curid=1151730" title="Autobiography of a Yogi">
<text>Autobiography of a Yogi by Paramahansa Yogananda is a spiritual classic published in 1946. It recounts Yogananda&#x27;s life, his search for his guru, and his teachings on Kriya Yoga. The book has introduced many to meditation and yoga and has been influential in both Eastern and Western spiritual circles. It has been translated into over fifty languages and continues to be widely read. Notable admirers include Steve Jobs, George Harrison, and Elvis Presley. 

Paramahansa Yogananda was born as Mukunda Lal Ghosh in Gorakhpur, India, into a Bengali Hindu family. &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; recounts his life and his encounters with spiritual figures of the Eastern and the Western world. The book begins with his childhood and family life, then finding his guru, becoming a monk and establishing his teachings of Kriya Yoga meditation. The book continues in 1920 when Yogananda accepted an invitation to speak at a religious congress in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. He then travelled across the USA lecturing and establishing his teachings in Los Angeles, California. In 1935, he returned to India for a yearlong visit. When he returned to the USA he continued to establish his teachings, including writing this book.

The book is an introduction to the methods of attaining God-realization and the spiritual wisdom of the East, which had only been available to a few before 1946. The author claims that the writing of the book was prophesied by the nineteenth-century master Lahiri Mahasaya (Paramguru of Yogananda).

The book has been in print for seventy-five years and translated into over fifty languages by the Self-Realization Fellowship, a spiritual society established by Yogananda. It has been acclaimed as a spiritual classic, being designated by Philip Zaleski, while he was under the auspices of HarperCollins Publishers, as one of the &quot;100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century.&quot; It is included in the book &quot;50 Spiritual Classics: Timeless Wisdom from 50 Great Books of Inner Discovery, Enlightenment and Purpose&quot; by Tom Butler-Bowdon. According to Project Gutenberg, the first edition is in the public domain, at least five publishers are reprinting it and four post it free for online reading.

== Overview ==

&quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; examines the life and spiritual development of Paramahansa Yogananda. The book describes Yogananda&#x27;s childhood family life, his search for his guru, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, the establishment of his first school, Yogoda Satsanga Brahmacharya Vidyalaya, and his journey to America where he lectured to thousands, established Self-Realization Fellowship and visited Luther Burbank, a renowned botanist to whom the book is dedicated. The book then describes Yogananda&#x27;s return visit to India in 1935, where he encountered leading spiritual figures such as Therese Neumann in Bavaria, the Hindu saint Ananda Moyi Ma, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Sir C. V. Raman, and Giri Bala, &quot;the woman yogi who never eats.&quot; Finally, Yogananda describes his return to the West, where he continued to establish his teachings in America, including the writing of the &quot;Autobiography&quot;.

The preface was written by anthropologist Walter Evans-Wentz, a writer who was a pioneer in the study of Tibetan Buddhism in the west, most notably through his translations of &quot;The Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Tibet&#x27;s Great Yogi Milarepa.&quot; In the preface he wrote, &quot;His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West.&quot;

Yukteswar Giri, Yogananda&#x27;s guru, told him about a significant prediction made by Lahiri Mahasaya, Yukteswar&#x27;s guru. Yukteswar heard him say, &quot;About fifty years after my passing,&quot; he said, &quot;my life will be written because of a deep interest in yoga which the West will manifest. The yogic message will encircle the globe, and aid in establishing that brotherhood of man which results from direct perception of the One Father.&quot; In 1945, fifty years after Lahiri Mahasaya&#x27;s passing in 1895, the Autobiography was complete and ready for publication.

==Influence==

In 1999, &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; was designated one of the &quot;100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century&quot; by a panel of theologians and luminaries convened by HarperCollins publishers. According to Philip Goldberg, who wrote &quot;American Veda&quot;, &quot;... the Self-Realization Fellowship, which represents Yogananda&#x27;s Legacy, is justified in using the slogan, &#x27;The Book that Changed the Lives of Millions.&#x27; It has sold more than four million copies and counting ...&quot; &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; is the most popular of Yogananda&#x27;s books and SRF has published the book in over fifty languages.

&quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; has introduced meditation and yoga to many Westerners since its publication. Its success has also made Yogananda a distinguished figure in India, where commemorative stamps were issued in 2017 to honor him.

The book has many famous advocates, particularly in the business and entertainment communities. One of the most famous advocates of the book was Steve Jobs, the co-founder, and formerly Chairman and CEO of Apple Inc. Jobs &quot;first read &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; as a teenager, then re-read [the book] ... once a year ever since.&quot; Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce.com, told his story of attending Steve Jobs&#x27; memorial service, where the attendees were handed a small brown box on their way out. &quot;This is going to be good,&quot; he thought. &quot;I knew that this was a decision he made, and whatever it was, it was the last thing he wanted us all to think about.&quot; The box contained a copy of the book.

George Harrison, lead guitarist of the Beatles, received his first copy of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; from Ravi Shankar in 1966 and, according to Shankar, &quot;that was where his (George Harrison&#x27;s) interest in Vedic culture and Indian-ness began.&quot; Gary Wright, who wrote the song &quot;Dream Weaver&quot;, wrote: &quot;In 1972, my friend George Harrison invited me to accompany him on a trip to India. A few days before we left, he gave me a copy of the book &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; by Paramahansa Yogananda. Needless to say the book inspired me deeply, and I became totally fascinated with Indian culture and philosophy. My trip was an experience I will never forget.&quot;

Elvis Presley was introduced to &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; in 1965 by his hair dresser-turned-guru, Larry Geller. Elvis continued to study the book throughout the 1970s. He left a copy of the book behind in a Nashville hotel room on 21 January 1977. Later on this book was auctioned off with a letter of authenticity

The actress Mariel Hemingway says that she was introduced to the &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; by Peter Evans, a direct disciple of Yogananda. She was &quot;mesmerized by the &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; and loved the whole great Hindu tradition of spiritual seeking ...&quot;

The actor Dennis Weaver gave a copy of the book to Linda Evans, saying that it had changed his life. Evans says that, &quot;Because of Dennis, I took the first step in what would become a life long spiritual journey.&quot;

Andrew Weil, director of the program in integrative medicine at University of Arizona, wrote the book &quot;Eating Well for Optimum Health&quot;. He mentioned reading the &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, which he said, &quot;awakened in me an interest in yoga and Indian religious philosophies.&quot; He continued, &quot;It is filled with wondrous tales from an exotic land, none more amazing than that of Giri Bala, &#x27;a woman yogi who never eats.&#x27;&quot;

The work has also attracted less favourable comments. Srinivas Aravamudan has described its contents as &quot;miracle-infested territory&quot; whose &quot;single most memorable feature ... is a repetitive insistence on collocating the miraculous and the quotidian. ... The autobiography is an eclectic directory of sorts that might be dubbed a hitchhiker&#x27;s guide to the paranormal galaxy.&quot; Aravamudan notes the &quot;aggressive marketing&quot; of the Yogoda Satsang and Self-Realization Fellowship, that Yogananda himself &quot;worked the mass media&quot; and used a technique described as &quot;Guru English&quot;. He notes that Yogananda was the collator of the testimonials that purport to validate the miracles described, which appear at a rate of around one per page.

According to Chris Welch and the liner notes on the album, &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot;, a concept album recorded by Yes, the progressive rock group, was inspired by &quot;a lengthy footnote on page 83&quot; of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;. The footnote describes four Shastric scriptures that cover religion, art, social life, medicine, music and architecture. On 3 March 1973, Jon Anderson was given a copy of &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; by Jamie Muir at Bill Bruford&#x27;s wedding. Anderson became particularly fascinated by the footnote on page 83, which inspired him to write much of the material for &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot;.

Cholo-goth icon Rafael Reyes credits the book with saving his life and opening him to spiritual self-awareness.

James Dudley, in his book &quot;Library Journal: Autobiography of a Yogi&quot;, wrote: &quot;Yogananda&#x27;s masterly storytelling epitomizes the Indian oral tradition with its wit, charm, and compassionate wisdom.&quot;

Phil Goldberg, in his book &quot;The Life of Yogananda&quot;, states that &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; is &quot;the book that changed the lives of millions&quot;.

Today, reading &quot;Autobiography of a Yogi&quot; has become an unofficial prerequisite for prospective students of the Self-Realization Fellowship&#x27;s &quot;Lessons for Home Study&quot;, a set of lessons, reflections, and assignments that one may read and apply before being initiated into Kriya Yoga.

<text>Gorakhpur is a city in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, along the banks of the Rapti river in the Purvanchal region. It is situated 272 kilometres east of the state capital, Lucknow. It is the administrative headquarters of Gorakhpur district, North Eastern Railway Zone and Gorakhpur division. The city is home to the Gorakhnath Math, a Gorakhnath temple. The city also has had an Indian Air Force station since 1963. Gita Press, the world&#x27;s largest publisher of Hindu religious texts like Ramayana and Mahabharata, has been established here since 1926.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Gorakhpur&quot; comes from the Sanskrit &quot;Gorakshapuram&quot;, which means abode of Gorakshanatha, a renowned ascetic who was a prominent saint of the &quot;Nath Sampradaya&quot;.

==History==
The earliest forerunners of the settlement at Gorakhpur were probably &quot;considerably to the north of the present town&quot; because the course of the Rapti was then more to the north and east than it is today; it would have flowed through the present-day city and gone through what is now the Ramgarh Tal. Farmers digging wells in the 1800s/early 1900s would sometimes encounter pieces of old boats, which is indicative of the river&#x27;s shift in course. The site of Gorakhpur would have been desirable for a human settlement because of its secure location — it is protected on the south and west by the Rapti and Rohin rivers, and in the past there were dense forests on the north and east, offering protection on those sides as well.

The earliest event described in local tradition is the legendary construction of the Mansarowar and Kauladah tanks, in the area now called Purana Gorakhpur, in the 10th century. They are said to have been built by a married couple — Mansarowar is attributed to the husband, the prince Man Sen, while Kauladah is attributed to the wife, Kaulavati. Sometime after that, the area is said to have been ruled by a group known as the Domkatars Bhumihars, who built the Domingarh fort at the confluence of the Rapti and Rohin rivers. Still later, Gorakhpur is said to have been ruled by the Shrinet Rajputss of Satasi. Sometime around 1400, a family dispute is said to have prompted one branch of the Satasi dynasty to leave the old stronghold, on the shore of Ramgarh Tal, and move to a new location in what is now Purana Gorakhpur, near the shrine of the renowned ascetic Gorakhnath.

===Mughal period===
In any case, Gorakhpur had become a large town by the time of Akbar, in the late 1500s. The earliest contemporary reference to a Mughal garrison at Gorakhpur is in 1572, when it was governed by Payanda Khan on behalf of Munim Khan, then &quot;subahdar&quot; of Jaunpur. Gorakhpur was for a long time the main Muslim garrison north of the Ghaghra, which may explain why it has such a prominent Muslim presence compared to other parts of the district.

In the &quot;Ain-i-Akbari&quot; ( 1595), Gorakhpur is listed as the capital of a &quot;sarkar&quot; in the &quot;subah&quot; of Awadh. &quot;Sarkar&quot; Gorakhpur was divided into 24 &quot;mahal&quot;s, and Gorakhpur itself was one of them. The &quot;mahal&quot; of Gorakhpur was listed with an assessed revenue of 567,385 &quot;dam&quot;s and was expected to supply 200 infantry and 40 cavalry to the Mughal army. It was described as having a brick fort on the Rapti.

Gorakhpur also had a mint under Akbar, issuing copper coins only. By the time of Aurangzeb, the Gorakhpur mint was also issuing silver coins. During the 1600s, based on Jean-Baptiste Tavernier&#x27;s account of his travels in India, Gorakhpur played an important role as a centre for trade with the northern mountain regions.

In the late 1600s, Gorakhpur was officially renamed &quot;Mu&#x27;azzamabad&quot; in honour of Prince Mu&#x27;azzam (the later Bahadur Shah I), and this name was used in official documents until the British takeover in 1801.

<text>The Waimakariri Gorge is located on the Waimakariri River in inland Canterbury in the South Island of New Zealand.

The height of the Waimakariri gorge bridge is 30m.

Like its neighbour, the Rakaia River, the Waimakariri runs through wide shingle beds for much of its length, but is forced through a narrow canyon as it approaches the Canterbury Plains.

Much of the gorge is followed by the Midland line. The Waimakariri Gorge Bridge was built in 1876 by William Stocks. Until the early 1930s, it carried the Oxford Branch railway line connecting Oxford and Sheffield.

<text>The Rakaia Gorge is located on the Rakaia River in inland Canterbury in New Zealand&#x27;s South Island.

Like its neighbour, the Waimakariri River, the Rakaia runs through wide shingle beds for much of its length, but is forced through a narrow canyon as it approaches the Canterbury Plains.

In the 1870s, there were proposals to extend the Whitecliffs Branch railway into the Rakaia Gorge, and an 1880 Royal Commission on New Zealand&#x27;s railway network was in favour of this proposal, but it never came to fruition.

The Rakaia Gorge bridge was completed in 1882 and provides an inland alternative to the more frequently used Rakaia River bridge just north of the town of Rakaia. The bridge carries State Highway 77 and the Inland Scenic Route and connects the settlements of Glentunnel and Methven

Swimming at the top bridges of the gorge is a favoured pastime for locals and tourists alike. Swimming in the main river can be done but only by strong swimmers. There is a perfect swimming hole under the concrete bridge that suits all levels, this area has no current as it is completely protected from the river.

<text>Fuller Warren (October 3, 1905September 23, 1973) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 30th governor of Florida.

==Early life and education==

Born in Blountstown, Florida, he attended the University of Florida in Gainesville. While at the university he was one of the early members of Florida Blue Key, as well as the Tau chapter of Theta Chi fraternity. While still attending the university, he was elected in 1927 at the age of 21 to the Florida House of Representatives.

==Legal career and early politics==
Following graduation, he moved to Jacksonville, where he began practicing law. He served on the city council from 1931 until 1937; he was elected and returned to the Florida House in 1939. During World War II, he was a gunnery officer in the U.S. Navy.

==Term as governor==

Warren was nominated for governor by the Democratic Party in 1948; his platform included promises to fight racism in Florida. In addition to having to deal with racial segregation, most blacks were still disenfranchised and cut out of the official political system. Warren won the election and assumed the office of governor on January 4, 1949.

After his election, he spoke out against the Ku Klux Klan, stating after a rally in January 1949 that 
In March 1949, reports were published that Warren had been a member of the Klan. He issued a statement saying that he had been a member before World War II, but during it he had &quot;helped to fight a war to destroy the Nazis — first cousins to Klansmen.&quot;

During his term, Warren set the foundations for the state&#x27;s turnpike system, began the Florida reforestation program, instituted quality control programs on Florida&#x27;s citrus crops, and signed a law that forbade cattle from wandering freely (as they damaged crops). In 1951 Warren signed an anti-Klan law which, although not mentioning the Klan specifically, forbade the wearing of masks in public or on the private property of another person without the written permission of the owner.

The hearings of the United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce, chaired by Senator Estes Kefauver, brought to light the involvement of Florida public officials in gambling-related corruption involving numbers games and bolita. There were accusations that Warren&#x27;s 1948 campaign had been funded by organized criminals. Warren refused to cooperate with the committee, claiming that to do so would contradict the principle of States&#x27; rights. In a letter to Senator Herbert O&#x27;Conor, in which Warren informed the committee that he would not appear before them, he stated: &quot;I think state sovereignty as conceived by the founders of our Government is something more than a fading memory to rest in the nation&#x27;s archives.&quot;

In 1951, legislator George S Okell, in the Florida House of Representatives introduced a resolution to impeach Warren for &quot;wilfully ignoring&quot; his duty to eliminate illegal gambling in Florida and for falsifying papers related to his 1948 campaign. The House voted on May 28, 1951, to reject the articles of impeachment.

==Later years ==

After Warren left office on January 6, 1953, he moved to Miami, where he practiced law. Early in 1954, Warren joined WITV (channel 17), Miami&#x27;s second television station and the city&#x27;s first UHF station, as a political analyst and news commentator. A review of his weekly program in the &quot;Miami News&quot; began with, &quot;those melisonant [&quot;sic&quot;] vibrations dripping from WITV&#x27;s transmitter each Sunday should send fear into the hearts of every news commentator across the nations.&quot; He ran for governor again in 1956, promising &quot;to maintain segregation in Florida&quot; but lost the election to opponent LeRoy Collins.

Warren died in Miami in 1973.

<doc id="1151742" wikidata="Q37913738" url="?curid=1151742" title="Wye Oak">
<text>The Wye Oak was the largest white oak tree in the United States and the State Tree of Maryland from 1941 until its demise in 2002. Wye Oak State Park preserves the site where the revered tree stood for more than 400 years in the town of Wye Mills, Talbot County, Maryland.

The Wye Oak was believed to be over 460 years old at the time of its destruction during a severe thunderstorm on June 6, 2002. It measured in circumference of the trunk at breast height, high, with a crown spread of . It is believed that the acorn that became the oak germinated around 1540. Its largest limb, estimated to weigh 35 short tons (31.5 tonnes) and six feet (1.8 meters) thick, fell earlier, on June 10, 1984. The Wye Oak was still bearing a maturing crop of acorns when it was toppled.

The Wye Oak drew public attention in 1909, when Maryland State Forester Fred W. Besley made the first official measurement of the tree. Ten years later, in 1919, it was featured in &quot;American Forestry&quot; magazine as the first tree in the American Forestry Association&#x27;s &quot;Tree Hall of Fame.&quot; The Wye Oak inspired Besley to found the Big Tree Champion Program in 1925; as a result, in 1940 the American Forestry Association named the Wye Oak one of its first National Champion Trees. By the time of its destruction 62 years later, only one other tree named that year remained standing. The tree faced a loss of a large limb in 1956 that sparked concerns, and another limb fell in 1984 that weighed .

The tree fell during a heavy thunderstorm with high winds on the night of June 6, 2002. The tree&#x27;s exceptionally long life has been attributed to the efforts of park managers, who applied preventive measures such as fertilizer and insecticide as well as extensive pruning, cabling, and bracing of the branches.

==State park==
The Maryland General Assembly purchased the tree and established Wye Oak State Park in 1939. At its creation, the park was a little over an acre in size, according to &quot;Wye Oak: The History of a Great Tree&quot; by Dickson J. Preston:

The park&#x27;s current protect the nearby stream valley from development. The site of the Wye Oak remains largely untouched, and the descriptive plaque placed there in 1921 remains at the site. The park also includes a one-room brick schoolhouse dating from colonial times; it is the second-oldest schoolhouse in Talbot County.

==Cloning==
Dr. Frank Gouin, Professor Emeritus of Horticulture at the University of Maryland, College Park, impressed both by the age and size of the tree, as well as its unusual resistance to oak wilt fungus and the gypsy moth, led a successful effort to clone the Wye Oak. The first two cloned saplings were planted at Mount Vernon on April 26, 2002. Another clone was planted in the remains of the trunk of the original tree during a June 6, 2006, ceremony; a marker commemorates the event.

==Artworks==
Upon its falling, immediate efforts were made to salvage and preserve the tree&#x27;s remains. Pieces of the tree that had fallen in previous years had been used to sculpt works such as the statue of two children planting a tree located in the Tawes State Office Building in Annapolis. A very large section of the lost tree became a new desk for the Maryland governor&#x27;s office. Wood distributed to artists and craftspersons was used to create carvings, sculptures, oil paintings, a three-dimensional collage, furnishings, and serving pieces; a gallery of the creations was made available online by the Department of Natural Resources. Another artist took hundreds of small leaves from the tree, preserved them and made them into jewelry issued with a certificate of authenticity as being from The Wye Oak.

<text>Manilal Mohandas Gandhi (28 October 1892 – 5 April 1956) was the second son of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi.

==Biography==
Manilal was born in Rajkot, British India, the second of four sons of Mohandas Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. He had an older brother, Harilal, and two younger brothers, Ramdas and Devdas. 

Manilal&#x27;s early years were spent in Rajkot, and it was in 1897 he traveled to South Africa for the first time (his father having moved there several years previously). The family lived for a time in Durban and Johannesburg. Between 1906 and 1914, he lived at the Phoenix Settlement (in KwaZulu-Natal) and Tolstoy Farm (in Gauteng), both settlements established by his father.

After a brief visit to India (accompanying his parents), Manilal returned to South Africa in 1917 to assist in printing the &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, a Gujarati-English weekly publication, at Phoenix, Durban. By 1918, Manilal was doing most of the work for the press, and in 1920, he took over as editor. He remained editor of &quot;Indian Opinion&quot; until 1956, the year of his death. Manilal died from a cerebral thrombosis following a stroke.

Like his father, Manilal was also sent to prison several times by the British colonial government after protesting against what he perceived as unjust laws. He was one of the initial 78 marchers to accompany Gandhi on the 1930 Salt March, for which he was imprisoned.

==Personal life==
In 1926, Manilal informed his father Mahatma Gandhi about Fatima Gool, with whom he had fallen in love in South Africa. Fatima was a Muslim of Gujrati descent. But Gandhi conveyed his disagreement and wrote:&quot;If you stick to Hinduism and Fatima follows Islam it will be like putting two swords in one sheath; or you both may lose your faith. And then what should be your children&#x27;s faith? ... It is not dharma, only adharma if Fatima agrees to conversion just for marrying you. Faith is not a thing like a garment which can be changed to suit our convenience.&quot;In 1927, Manilal married Sushila (24 August 1907 – 1988), a woman from his own community and similar background, in a match arranged by their families in the usual Indian way. Sushila was the daughter of Nanabhai Mashruwala of Akola, Bombay State, and the niece of Kishorlal Mashruwala, a close associate of Gandhiji and a resident of Sevagram ashram. It was Mahatma Gandhi who sought her hand for his second son; the match was arranged, and after the wedding, Sushila duly joined her husband in South Africa. They had three children:
*Sita Dhupelia (b. 1928), elder daughter
*Arun Manilal Gandhi (1934–2023), son
*Ela Gandhi Ramgobin (b. 1940), younger daughter

==Legacy==
Manilal&#x27;s children Arun and Ela were also social-political activists. Uma D. Mesthrie, Sita&#x27;s daughter, recently published a biography on Manilal.

<text>Ramdas Mohandas Gandhi (4 May 1897 – 14 April 1969) was the third son of Mahatma Gandhi. He was a freedom activist in his own right.

==Biography==
Ramdas was born in the Colony of Natal, the third son of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba Gandhi. He had two older brothers, Harilal and Manilal, and one younger brother, Devdas Gandhi.

He was married to Nirmala Gandhi, and they had three children, including Kanu Gandhi and Sumitra Kulkarni.

Raised in South Africa on one of his father&#x27;s ashram-farms, Ramdas would, as an adult, tend to deprecate the idealistic poverty imposed by his father on all his associates. He had no taste for asceticism and considered that his father&#x27;s lifestyle was nothing more than a personal fetish which caused inconvenience to others, including the Gandhi family. 

Nevertheless, he was a passionate nationalist and freedom fighter, and an active participant in the grueling civil protests of the 1930s which his father led. He was imprisoned numerous times by the British, and these prolonged stints in jail had serious effects on his health. 

At his father&#x27;s funeral, Ramdas Gandhi was the one who lit the funeral pyre, as he had desired. He was joined by his younger brother Devdas Gandhi at the funeral.

He died in 1969, aged 72.

<text>Devdas Mohandas Gandhi (22 May 1900 – 3 August 1957) was the fourth and youngest son of Mahatma Gandhi. He was born in the Colony of Natal and came to India with his parents as a grown man. He became active in his father&#x27;s movement, spending many terms in jail. He also became a prominent journalist, serving as editor of Hindustan Times. He was also the first &quot;pracharak&quot; of the Dakshina Bharat Hindi Prachar Sabha (DBHPS), established by Mohandas Gandhi in Tamil Nadu in 1918. The purpose of the Sabha was to propagate Hindi in southern India&quot;.&quot;

== Family ==
Devdas fell in love with Lakshmi, the daughter of C. Rajagopalachari, Devdas&#x27;s father&#x27;s associate in the Indian independence struggle. Due to Lakshmi&#x27;s age at that time – she was only 15 and Devdas was 28 – both Devdas&#x27;s father and Rajaji asked the couple to wait for five years without seeing each other. After five years had passed, they were married with their fathers&#x27; permissions in 1933.

Devdas and Lakshmi had four children including Rajmohan Gandhi, Gopalkrishna Gandhi and Ramchandra Gandhi.

== Legacy ==
When Mahatma Gandhi started seeking help for establishment of Jamia Millia Islamia, Devdas also came forward on the call of Gandhi. He started teaching Hindi there and also cotton spinning.

<text>The Linksys WRT54G Wi-Fi series is a series of Wi-Fi–capable residential gateways marketed by Linksys, a subsidiary of Cisco, from 2003 until acquired by Belkin in 2013. A &quot;residential gateway&quot; connects a local area network (such as a home network) to a wide area network (such as the Internet).

Models in this series use one of various 32-bit MIPS processors. All WRT54G models support Fast Ethernet for wired data links, and 802.11b/g for wireless data links.

== Hardware and revisions ==

=== WRT54G ===
The original WRT54G was first released in December 2002. It has a 4+1 port network switch (the Internet/WAN port is part of the same internal network switch, but on a different VLAN). The devices have two removable antennas connected through Reverse Polarity TNC connectors. The WRT54GC router is an exception and has an internal antenna with optional external antenna.

As a cost-cutting measure, as well as to satisfy FCC rules that prohibit fitting external antennas with higher gain, the design of the latest version of the WRT54G no longer has detachable antennas or TNC connectors. Instead, version 8 routers simply route thin wires into antenna &#x27;shells&#x27; eliminating the connector. As a result, Linksys HGA7T and similar external antennas are no longer compatible with this model.

Until version 5, WRT54G shipped with Linux-based firmware.

=== WRT54GS ===
The WRT54GS is nearly identical to the WRT54G except for additional RAM, flash memory, and SpeedBooster software. Versions 1 to 3 of this router have 8 MB of flash memory. Since most third parties&#x27; firmware only use up to 4 MB flash, a JFFS2-based read/write filesystem can be created and used on the remaining 4 MB free flash. This allows for greater flexibility of configurations and scripting, enabling this small router to both load-balance multiple ADSL lines (multi-homed) or to be run as a hardware layer-2 load balancer (with appropriate third party firmware).

=== WRT54GL ===
Linksys released the WRT54GL (the best-selling router of all time) in 2005 to support third-party firmware based on Linux, after the original WRT54G line was switched from Linux to VxWorks, starting with version 5. The WRT54GL is technically a reissue of the version 4 WRT54G. Cisco was sued by the FSF for copyright infringement, but the case was settled.

=== WRTSL54GS ===
WRTSL54GS is similar to the WRT54GS while adding additional firmware features and a USB 2.0 port (referred to as StorageLink) which can be used for a USB hard disk or flash drive.

Unlike other models, the WRTSL54GS has only a single 1.5 dBi antenna, and it is not removable.

=== WRT54GX ===
WRT54GX comes with SRX (Speed and Range eXpansion), which uses &quot;True MIMO&quot; technology. It has three antennas and was once marketed as a &quot;Pre-N&quot; router, with eight times the speed and three times the range over standard 802.11g routers.

=== WRT54GP2 and WRTP54G ===
WRT54GP2 has 1 or 2 antennas, and a built-in analog telephony adapter (ATA) with 2 phone lines, but only 3 network ports.
&quot;Vonage&quot; WRTP54G has 1 antenna, 2 phone lines, 4 network ports — Same S/N Prefix

=== WRT54GX2 ===
WRT54GX2 has 2 antennas, and was advertised to have up to 6 times the speed and 2 times the range over standard 802.11g routers. Chipset Realtek. It is not compatible with DD-WRT.

=== WRT54GX4 ===
WRT54GX4 has 3 moveable antennas, and is advertised to have 10 times the speed and 3 times the range of standard 802.11g routers.
WRT54GX4-EU: chipset Realtek RTL8651B, radio chipset Airgo AGN303BB, flash S29GL064M90TFIR4. It does not appear to be compatible with DD-WRT.

=== WRT51AB ===
WRT series with 802.11a support. (First Generation)

=== WRT55AG ===
WRT54G series with 802.11a support.

=== WTR54GS ===
The Linksys WTR54GS is a confusingly named derivative of the WRT54G. It is a compact wireless travel router with SpeedBooster support that has only one LAN and one WAN Fast Ethernet interfaces, but has two wireless interfaces. The WTR54GS has the ability to make an unencrypted wireless connection on one interface, and make open shared connections on the other wireless interface, or the LAN port.

=== WRT54G2 ===
The WRT54G2 is an iteration of the WRT54G in a smaller, curved black case with internal antenna(s). This unit includes a four port 10/100 switch and one WAN port.
* Note: 1.5 of the WRT54G2 is NOT supported by dd-wrt. This is because it uses Atheros components (i.e. the Atheros SoC) which require more than the 2 MB of Flash Memory built-in for a dd-wrt solution.

=== WRT54GS2 ===
The WRT54GS2 is the WRT54G2 hardware with the VxWorks 5.5 Firmware including SpeedBooster. It has a sleek black design with 2 internal antennas. It includes a 4-port 10/100 switch and one 10/100 WAN port on the rear.
=== WRT54GC ===

WRT54GC series with 802.11b/g support. This unit has a four port 10/100 switch and one WAN port. The &quot;C&quot; in the router number stands for compact, as the unit measures 4&quot; by 4&quot; by 1&quot; with an internal antenna. The unit can be expanded with addition of HGA7S external antenna to boost range. Hardware Version 1.0 is the only option available in the United States since introduction in 2005.

Version 2.0 is shipping in, amongst other countries, the United Kingdom. This unit has 1 MB flash, 4 MB RAM and a non-detachable external antenna.

The internal hardware is based on a Marvell ARM914 (&quot;Libertas&quot;) reference design which is probably identical to the SerComm IP806SM, Xterasys XR-2407G, Abocom ARM914, Hawking HWGR54 Revision M, and the Airlink 101 AR315W. By appropriately changing the value of the firmware byte 0x26, the WRT54GC can be cross-flashed with firmware based on the same reference platform.

There were reports in 2006 that a sister platform of the WRT54GC (the AR315W) was hacked to run Linux.

=== WRT54G3G/WRT54G3GV2 Mobile Broadband router ===
The WRT54G3G/WRT54G3GV2 Mobile Broadband routers are variants that have four Fast Ethernet ports, one Internet wired port (For DSL/Cable connections), plus a PCMCIA slot for use with a Cellular Based PC Card &quot;aircard&quot;. The V2 model has two additional USB ports for 3G modem use and one other USB port, which has yet to be put to use.

;Other cellular providers
To use this router with other cellular providers, one must use an alternative firmware. The stock firmware does not support cellular providers, even though one does have the exact supported aircard. For example, Telus Mobility (CANADA) uses the Sierra Wireless Aircard 595, which is supported by this router, but because it is from Telus Mobility and not from Sprint (USA), it will never load the card into the router to make it operational. This is only true for the Sprint and AT&amp;T-branded models.

=== WRT54G-TM, WRTU54G-TM, and WRTU54GV2-TM ===
The WRT54G-TM (TM stands for T-Mobile) is also called the T-Mobile &quot;Hotspot@Home&quot; service. It allows calls to be made via T-Mobile&#x27;s GSM network or via Wi-Fi Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA), using the same telephone and phone number (a special dual-mode phone designed for the service is required e.g. BlackBerry Pearl 8120). Additionally, once a call is in progress, one may transition from Wi-Fi to GSM (and vice versa) seamlessly, as Wi-Fi signal comes and goes, such as when entering or exiting a home or business. A special router is not needed to use the service, but the T-Mobile branded routers are supposed to enhance the telephone&#x27;s battery life. This is the only known tweak to the TM version of the firmware. The hardware appears similar to that of the WRT54GL, except it has 32 MB RAM and 8 MB flash memory.

The WRT54G-TM having a serial number that starts with C061 has these specifications:
* Broadcom BCM5352EKPBG CPU
*32 MB RAM (Hynix HY5DU561622ETP-D43)
*8 MB Flash (JS28f640)
*Uses the same BINs that the WRT54GS v3.0 does

=== WRT54G-RG ===
The WRT54G-RG (RG stands for Rogers) is also called the Rogers TalkSpot Voice-Optimized Router. It works with Rogers&#x27; Talkspot UMA service, which allows calls to be made via Rogers&#x27; cellular network or via Wi-Fi Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA), using the same telephone and phone number. A UMA-compatible phone is required. The WRT54G-RG and the WRT54G-TM are identical in terms of hardware.

=== WRT54GH ===
The WRT54GH comes with an internal antenna, a four-port network switch, and support for Wi-Fi 802.11b/g.

== Third-party firmware projects ==
After Linksys was obliged to release source code of the WRT54G&#x27;s firmware under terms of the GNU General Public License, there have been many third party projects enhancing that code as well as some entirely new projects using the hardware in these devices. Three of the most widely used are DD-WRT, Tomato and OpenWrt.

== Hardware versions and firmware compatibility ==
As of January 2006, most third-party firmware are no longer compatible with version 5 of both the WRT54G and the WRT54GS. The amount of flash memory in the version 5 devices has been reduced to 2 MB, too small for current Linux-based third-party firmware. (See table above for information on identifying the version based on the serial number printed on the bottom of the unit, and on the outside of the shrink-wrapped retail box.)

Some users have succeeded in flashing and running a stripped down but fully functional version of DD-WRT called &#x27;micro&#x27; on a version 5 WRT54G. An easier method not requiring any disassembly of the device has since been devised for flashing v5-v8 to DD-WRT.

To support third-party firmware, Linksys has re-released the WRT54G v4, under the new model name WRT54GL (the &#x27;L&#x27; in this name allegedly stands for &#x27;Linux&#x27;). It is also possible to replace the 2 MB flash chip in the WRT54G with a 4 MB flash chip. The Macronix International 29LV320BTC-90 is a suitable part although others may work as well. The user must first install a JTAG header and use a JTAG cable to back up the firmware, then replace the chip and restore the firmware with the JTAG cable. After testing for proper functionality of the modified unit, third-party firmware can be flashed using the JTAG cable and a suitable image file.

With the Attitude Adjustment (12.09) release of OpenWrt, all WRT54G hardware versions with 16 MB of RAM are no longer supported, and older Backfire (10.03) is recommended instead. Issues came from dropping support for the legacy Broadcom target codice_1, making lower end devices run out of memory easily. Support for Attitude Adjustment is limited to WRT54G hardware versions with 32 MB of RAM, which includes WRT54GS and (apart from performing RAM upgrades through hardware modifications) some of the WRT54G and WRT54GL versions having the capability for unlocking their additional 16 MB of RAM.

<doc id="1151770" wikidata="Q5508270" url="?curid=1151770" title="Fuller Warren Bridge">
<text>The Fuller Warren Bridge is the prestressed-concrete girder bridge that carries Interstate 95 (I-95) across the St. Johns River in Jacksonville, Florida. The current structure was finished in October 2002, replacing the original bascule-bridge span, finished in 1954.

The current bridge was designed by HNTB Corporation in 1990 and built by Balfour Beatty Construction. It is over long, with a main span of , and a vertical clearance of . When completed in 2000, it carried eight lanes across the span.

In the spring of 2018, a construction project began to add two more lanes and a shared-use path to the bridge which was completed in spring 2023.

The eastern end of the transcontinental Interstate 10 (I-10) meets I-95 just west of the bridge.

==Naming==
The bridge is named after former Florida governor Fuller Warren, former member and eventual denouncer of the KKK, who held the office from 1949 to 1953. He was a member of the Jacksonville City Council from 1931 to 1937.

==Original bridge==
The original bascule bridge was tolled until 1988, when the city of Jacksonville abolished toll collections. Increasing wear from heavy traffic, including a 1993 incident in which a fragment of concrete broke loose, forced officials to ban large trucks from the bridge in 1998. It was permanently closed June 13, 2001, when all traffic was moved to the new Fuller Warren Bridge. After delays in removal because of legal and environmental concerns, the Florida Department of Transportation used explosives to complete demolition of the old bridge on February 17, 2007.

==Switch to new bridge==
Conversion from the old Fuller Warren Bridge to the new one began with one lane of southbound I-95 traffic on April 16, 2000. The new bridge, built at a cost of approximately $100 million, was opened to all eight lanes in late 2002 and formally dedicated on January 13, 2003.
== Fuller Warren Expansion Project (2017)==
About 2013, The Florida State Department of Transportation (FDOT) began the Your10&amp;95 project to add operational improvements and enhancements to the I-10, I-95 highway interchange in metro Jacksonville. A planning department held several public meetings to discuss the proposed project and the cost of its construction with residents, community partners and businesses. They also asked for input from the public attendees. The meetings were held on February 10, 2014, on August 28, 2014, and on February 26, 2015. During those meetings, it was suggested that as part of the widening project to add two additional traffic lanes to the Fuller Warren bridge, a pedestrian shared use path should be added as well. The proposed path over the St. Johns River would connect the Riverside and Avondale historic neighborhood with the San Marco historic neighborhood. As the current bridge provides for no pedestrian or bicycle access, the FDOT agreed to implement the shared use path suggestion, as well as a number of other requests, such as adding traffic noise barriers for residents. The project also includes improvements to the I-10 ramps at Stockton and Irene streets. Construction began May 5, 2017 and was expected to be completed in the summer of 2020. See Shared Use Path (SUP) renderings . On the morning of October 4, 2018, a fatal accident involving one of the construction workers caused a temporary suspension of the work. By March, 2019 the project was near half way construction. On April 6, 2023, the shared use path across the St Johns river finally opened.

<doc id="1151773" wikidata="Q757719" url="?curid=1151773" title="Atra-Hasis">
<text>Atra-Hasis () is an 18th-century BC Akkadian epic, recorded in various versions on clay tablets and named for one of its protagonists, the priest Atra-Hasis (&#x27;exceedingly wise&#x27;). The narrative has four focal points: An organisation of allied gods shaping Mesopotamia agriculturally; a political conflict between the gods, pacified by creating the first human couples; the mass reproduction of these humans; and a great deluge, as has been handed down many times in the different flood myths of mankind. Probably the relic of a natural catastrophe (such as catastrophic flooding), the epic links this flood with the gods&#x27; intention to eliminate their artificial creatures.

The name &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; also appears, as a king of Shuruppak on the Euphrates in the times before that flood, on one of the &quot;Sumerian King Lists&quot;. The oldest known copy of the epic tradition concerning Atrahasis can be dated by colophon (scribal identification) to the reign of Hammurabi’s great-grandson, Ammi-Saduqa (1646–1626 BC). However, various Old Babylonian dialect fragments exist, and the epic continued to be copied into the first millennium BC.

The story of Atrahasis also exists in a later Assyrian dialect version, first rediscovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal, though its translations have been uncertain due to the artifact being in fragmentary condition and containing ambiguous words. Nonetheless, its fragments were first assembled and translated by George Smith as &quot;The Chaldean Account of Genesis&quot;, the hero of which had his name corrected to &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; by Heinrich Zimmern in 1899.

In 1965, Wilfred G. Lambert and Alan Millard published many additional texts belonging to the epic, including an Old Babylonian copy (written c. 1650 BC) which is the most complete recension of the tale to have survived. These new texts greatly increased knowledge of the epic and were the basis for Lambert and Millard’s first English translation of the Atrahasis epic in something approaching entirety. A further fragment was recovered in Ugarit.

==Myths and facts==
 The epic of Atra-Hasis contains the myth of the creation of mankind by Enlil, Anu and Enki. The gods Enlil, Anu and Enki are also known as Anunnaki and Igigi, the superior and the inferior gods. They seem to have been united in an organization similar to that which existed in Greece between Zeus – as ‘pure spirit or air’ the leading party – and the groups round Poseidon (ocean) and Hades (earth). (Compare also the triple alliance of the party around Zeus and the two from Atlantis to Greece defected groups around Epi- and Prometheus.)

It is not unlikely that the story refers to the era of the Neolithic Revolution, when Homo sapiens, similar to chimpanzees evolving in small autarkic hordes, began to establish political inter-group organisations. Instead of fighting each other as before (and as our closest relatives in the animal kingdom seem to have no choice in doing in an overpopulation crisis), these groups of hunter-gatherers came together – according to K. Schmidt&#x27;s thesis – to share their coveted territory in peace, to defend it and to erect impressive monuments like those at Göbekli Tepe. More or less from this date, they also developed agriculture, became sedentary and transformed Mesopotamia&#x27;s steppe into the blooming landscape that went down in the myths of mankind as the Garden of Eden.

===Overview===

In the main, the epic reports on a conflict between some of the first Sumerian gods and draws on the earlier myth of the separation of air and earth (‘above’ and ‘below’) in the midst of the cosmic freshwater primordial ocean to clarify their hierarchical relationship. Enlil represents the leading party in the council of gods; the party of Anunnaki around Anu belongs more to the upper heaven, and that of Igigi around Enki more to that below the earth (half) sphere.

All three parties are bound by the Tablet of Destinies, which Enlil is the only one to possess. In the Sumerian myths, its bestowed on him by the earth mother goddess Ninḫursag herself (cf. Anzu myth). His aptitude as the greatest warrior and chief strategist of the divine tribal alliance gives him power over the other parties of gods; only he has the ability to transform present circumstances back into their original state – redefining the course of fate.

As a permanent legal document the tablet was provided with a seal, a sign mechanically applied by means of a special technique, which in ancient Mesopotamia was regarded as a symbol of a contract. Contracts have been directly related to tribute payments to be made: often to shares of the food produced (see the cattle to be divided equitably between Prometheus and Zeus), but generally to assistance in battle or labour, such as the construction of mighty irrigation channels as described in the epic discussed here. As far as the male groups of gods were concerned, the separate task of reproduction fell to the seven divine wombs, the shassuratu presided over by Ninḫursag (&quot;Mami&quot;).

The plot of the epic follows a simple pattern:

*The creation of earth and all creatures that inhabit it is already complete.
*An organisation of at least three male parties of gods exist; they seem to specialise in ‘thinkers and workers’.
*The gods doing the hardest farm labour are dissatisfied and rise up against Enlil (master of the universe).
*With help of divine women* the victorious party arranges the production of a first pair of humans who, with all their descendants, are to serve all the gods as labour slaves for eternity /* cf. Athena&#x27;s contribution to Pandora.
*As result of the unrestrained multiplication of the humans, an overpopulation crisis breaks out, which the upper gods try to get under control, among others by triggering a global flooding to wash humanity as a whole off the face of mother earth.
As is well known, this genocidal project failed. In the tale of Atra-Hasis the reason for this divine misadventure was not so much the human&#x27;s shipbuilding skills (&quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;), but the quarrelling between the gods. Finally, they seal their fate as well as that of mankind by agreeing on a utopian method to regulate the reproduction of their creatures to a bearable level.

Two aspects of Atra-Hasis were adopted in the Epic of Gilgamesh around 1200 BC: the primal scene of the 7-day mating period of a man with a woman and the devastating deluge. Probably the Old Testament also referred to this two themes of Atra-Hasis, so the former dives up as Adam and Eve&#x27;s creation and the latter as the biblical flood narrative. The God-fearing priest Atraḫasis – the only one who was therefore allowed to survive the attempted delation with his wife, ensuring continued existence of artificially constructed humanity – appears there as Noah.

==Synopsis==
=== Tablet I ===

The epos taking place according to its incipit, &quot;When the gods had to work like humans (&quot;inuma ilu awilum&quot; = when the gods were humans)&quot;, there was a quarrel between the upper Anunnaki and the Igigu, the lower gods. While the latter had the task of ensuring the supply of the land through construction of irrigation canals by digging out the beds of big rivers, the Anunnaki ruled from above, presumably watching over the implementation of their plans and dividing the fruits of this great civilising project as they saw fit. After 40 years, however, the lesser gods rebelled and refused to do strenuous labor. At night, they surrounded the dwelling place of Enlil, who was considered the main god of Sumerian civilisation, the seperator of air and earth in the midst of the cosmic ocean.

Enlil was surprised and called for Anu and Enki. Nusku, one of the sons and Enlil&#x27;s ambassador here, tried to negotiate with the rebellious party, but had no success. Enlil, who also was the benevolent, wise leader of all the gods, didn&#x27;t want a battle with the risk of serious injuries and deaths, and to avoid this he devised the plan to create easily controllable (obedient) humans to do the hard labour in place of the rebellious gods. He asked Mami – leader of the 7 goddess wombs – if she could help. Mami declared that she could only fulfil this request with Enki&#x27;s assistance. Enki, agreeing, advised the assembly of all gods that they should first cleanse themselves for everything else. They do. On the fifteenth day of this project, he cut up Geshtu-E – &#x27;ear&#x27;, a god or partie who listened for wisdom – into pieces (cf. Plato&#x27;s dissection of the rebellious spherical people into weak single individuals) and began to create the first human being to the sound of drums. He took clay from the soil of the steppe (Mami was regarded as primordial mother &quot;earth&quot;, so with the clay from her body female fertility came into play here), mixed it with the spilt blood and added a touch of cosmic water, bringing it to its living form. When the creature awoke, Mami approached, handed it a carrying basket and taught it to work for the gods from then on.

(&quot;Here is a gap in the tablet in which it could have been described how the artificial man&quot; &quot;suffered from the loneliness of his working day and nothing the gods advised him to do was able to restore his zest for life. So the gods may have decided to give him a wife to cheer him up. Where she came from remains open due to the missing passage&quot; – &quot;there may have been a similarly conceived act of creation. However, this assumption would conflict with Moses&#x27; version of the events in the Garden of Eden, according to which the woman was made from a surgically amputated body part of Adam who had been put into deep narcotic sleep for this purpose, with the argument&quot; &quot;It is not good that the man should be alone; therefore let Us make a woman (Eve) who fit to him and do help.&quot; &quot;Gen. 2.18&quot;)

To complete the construction of humans in the optimal way, Mami encouraged the young couple to celebrate a seven day feast in honour of Isthar, the goddess of war and sexuality.* Both obeyed. After 9 months, the land of the gods gave birth to its first human child, whose purpose in life was to be the same as that of his parents.

(* &quot;Cf. Gilgamesh epic: there, too, the gods arranged a seven-day sexual act to pacify a kind of cold war. Protagonists are Enkidu: an almost invincible, rebellious animal-man or son of the &quot;Gazelle&quot; clan, and the female temple servant Shamkat, endowed with all advantages necessary for that purpose. Enkidu, who had previously destroyed so many animal traps with his fierce group of relatives, fell into this new type of trap. After having sex for 7 days, he was ‘weakened’: the herd of alleged animals he had lead fled into the steppe in horror. He was shocked of his lonely separation, but Shamkat, unaware that she was only following the gods&#x27; plan to domesticate Enkidu according to his further destiny, tried to comfort him: &quot;Don&#x27;t grieve; you have knowledge now, just like the gods!&quot; See also Adam&#x27;s and Eve&#x27;s enjoyment of the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge in Eden.&quot;)

1200 years later, humans had multiplied to such an extent that they disturbed the gods with their noise. Enlil was annoyed and decided that Namtar, his god of the dead&#x27;s realm, should carry off most of humans with frost fever, so a great extinction began. Enki, probably worried that he would end up having to work again himself, approached his faithful priest Atraḫasis and advised him to do following: The other gods should no longer be worshipped, but only Namtar. This flattered the god of deadly diseases so much that as soon as he had begun his pandemic work, he ceased to eliminate people.
=== Tablet II ===
 Tablet II is about the unstoppable increase in overpopulation.

After another 1200 years there were many more humans, they roamed around like roaring herds of cattle. Because the gods in upper part of heaven could no longer even sleep, Enlil sent Adad and, again 1200 years later, the fertility goddess Nisaba to devastate the land with storms and dry up the harvests. Enki – dwelling in the lower part of sky – told his priest Atraḫasis what to do about it each time: Only Adad and Nisaba should sacrificed, the other gods should left to starve. The pious priest acted according to this divine advice; Adad and Nisaba were so ashamed of this undeserved favour that they abandoned their endeavour. Enlil now completely enraged against Enki and decreed that a mighty flood should consume all of humanity. In addition, he made Enki swear before the Anunnaki that he would not speak another word to humans; he then began to consult with the assembled gods about the exact date and duration of the deluge to be unleashed.

&quot;(Enki in his relation to Enlil can be seen to have parallels to Prometheus rebelling against Zeus. Zeus was also originally the wise leader of a political organisation (primeval Athens), in which the double party of Titans &quot;Prometheus and Epimetheus&quot; embodied the inferior gods. According to the story, Zeus&#x27; character changed after a period of flourishing civilisation: he became stingy and unjust. In any case, these are the arguments Prometheus used to justify his uprising against &#x27;heaven&#x27;: he stole the god&#x27;s fire, cheated Zeus out of the best part of a cow and even had an affair with Athena, who let him enter olymp through a back door.&quot;&quot; Zeus solved this revolt by producing Pandora as Epimentheus&#x27; fatal wedding gift, dividing and ruling the titanic brothers. Similarly to Prometheus, Enki defies the orders of the upper gods, who now harbour genocidal intentions against the humans, and proves to be the benefactor of these creatures, who were of course only created as labour slaves to pacify the rebellion of the sub-gods around Enki.)&quot;

=== Tablet III ===
Tablet III contains the flood myth.
Well informed with all details, Enki went to his priest&#x27;s reed hut, but waited until Atraḫasis began to lie down to sleep. Then, speaking cunningly to the hut&#x27;s wall so as not to breach the contract, Enki told &#x27;it&#x27; what to do: ‘&quot;Separate yourself from your house, build a ship, spurn your possessions, save your life&quot;.’ The ship should be cube-shaped and also be watertight from above with a roof &quot;like Abzu&quot; itself. Atraḫasis should not tell anyone about the coming flood, take a large supply of food with him (including live birds and even fish, as the poet added with humorous irony) and keep an eye on the hourglass for seven days from start of the catastrophe. So the priest &quot;&#x27;Extremely Wise&quot;&#x27; hurriedly left his belongings under a pretence and began building the ship. He invited his neighbours to help and had no scruples about promising them that the reward would soon come richly from heaven. The deadline was pressing, so he organised a big party to attract more workers. He himself was unable to eat during the lavish feast, so nauseous was he with fear of the impending punishment of the gods.

When Adad gathered the clouds and the winds began to roar from all ends of the world, Atraḫasis and at least one fertile woman (the &quot;masters sons&quot; too) climbed into the ship and sealed its entrance hatch from inside with earth pitch. The ark swirled like a pot on the waves of the mighty flood thundering down from the open floodgates of the cosmic primordial ocean. And how furious Enlil was at his foiled plan to destroy mankind! - The other gods, however, suffered from hunger, as they were unable to find any more humans to feed them in the midst of the raging chaos. They cry at the immense destruction, and Mami (Belet-ili) raised serious accusations against Enli: &quot;Why you, the &quot;greatest&quot; warrior of all gods, didn&#x27;t fight the rebels&quot; (instead of constructing humans)?!

&quot;A few lines are missing here again, but these can be added according to the Epic of Gilgamesh: After the ark is stranded high up on Mount Nisir, Uta-napišti (the name of Atraḫasis in the Epic of Gilgamesh) sends out three birds - presumably at daily intervals: a dove, a swallow and a raven. The raven, the least able to fly, didn&#x27;t return, so Utanpištim knew that the land – probably still hidden from his view under thick clouds – was accessible again.&quot;

Atraḫasis descended from his ark and began to offer a food sacrifice to all the gods indiscriminately with a zeal eager to serve. How happy the gods were who had been starving for so long! As if they were flies lured by the scent, they swarmed in from all sides to the altar&#x27;s fire and began to feast to their hearts&#x27; – for which they later endowed Anthrahais-Noah with their immortality in gratitude and settled him with his wife on the island of Dilmun on the distant edge of the world (see Gilgamesh flood myth).

Enlil, however, who as a wise ruler was responsible for the welfare of this great civilisation, was still furious with Enki, the culprit whose treachery had once again enabled some humans to survive the genocide what was planned this time. Enki, however, as always never at a loss for creative ideas, devised a way that he hoped would finally solve the problem caused by the quarrelling gods themselves. He decreed that from now on the humans would be familiarised with suffering and death from birth, that there would be barren and untouchable women and that their lifespan would be severely limited from the outset (in biblical terms to 120 years), in the hope that their reproduction would be regulated in future. With this promise that the gods would have sufficient living space of their own on earth for all time, Enlil could be content and make peace with Enki.

==Alterations and adaptations==
===Lineage of Atra-Hasis===
In later versions of the flood story, contained in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; and the Eridu Genesis, the hero is not named Atra-Hasis.

In &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, the name of the flood hero is Utnapishtim, who is said to be the son of Ubara-Tutu, king of Shuruppak: &quot;Gilgamesh spoke to Utnapishtim, the Faraway... O man of Shuruppak, son of Ubara-Tutu.&quot; Many available tablets comprising the &quot;Sumerian King Lists&quot; support the lineage of the flood hero given in &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; by omitting a king named Shuruppak as a historical ruler of Shuruppak, implying a belief that the flood story took place after or during the rule of Ubara-Tutu.

In the Epic of Gilgamesh, first recorded in the 17th century BC (i.e., the Old Babylonian Empire), the hero is named Ziusudra, who also appears in the &quot;Instructions of Shuruppak&quot; as the son of the eponymous Shuruppak, who himself is called the son of Ubara-Tutu.

The &quot;Sumerian King Lists&quot; also make no mention of Atra-Hasis, Utnapishtim, or Ziusudra. Tablet &quot;WB 62&quot;, however, provides a different chronology: Atra-Hasis is listed as a ruler of Shuruppak and a &quot;gudug&quot; priest, preceded by his father Shuruppak, who is, in turn, preceded by his father Ubara-Tutu, as in &quot;The Instructions of Shuruppak&quot;. This tablet is unique in that it mentions both Shuruppak and Atra-Hasis.

=== Gilgamesh and the flood myth ===
Subsequent versions of the flood myth in the Ancient Near East evidently alter (omit and/or editorially change) information about the flood and the flood hero found in the original &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; story. In particular, a lost, intermediate version of the &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; flood myth seems to have been paraphrased or copied in a late edition of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; (Tablet XI). This modern addition of &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, known as the &#x27;standard version&#x27;, is traditionally associated with the Babylonian scribe Sîn-lēqi-unninni (&quot;circa &quot;1300–1000 BC), though some minor changes may have been made since his time.

Regarding the editorial changes to the &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; text in &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, Jeffrey H. Tigay comments: &quot;The dropping of individual lines between others which are preserved, but are not synonymous with them, appears to be a more deliberate editorial act. These lines share a common theme, the hunger and thirst of the gods during the flood.&quot;

==== Alterations ====
Examples of alterations to the &quot;Atra-Hasis&quot; story in &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; include:

* Omitting information, for example:
** The hero being at a banquet when the storm and flood begins: &quot;He invited his people...to a banquet... He sent his family on board. They ate and they drank. But he [Atrahasis] was in and out. He could not sit, could not crouch, for his heart was broken and he was vomiting gall.&quot;
** &quot;She was surfeited with grief and thirsted for beer.&quot;
** &quot;From hunger they were suffering cramps.&quot;
* Editorial changes, for example:
** &quot;Like dragonflies they have filled the river&quot; was changed to &quot;Like the spawn of fishes, they fill the sea.&quot; 
* Weakening of anthropomorphic descriptions of the gods, for example:
** &quot;The Anunnaki (the senior gods) [were sitt]ing in thirst and hunger&quot; changed to &quot;The gods feared the deluge.&quot;

<text>Seven Places was a Christian rock band founded in 2000. Seth Gilbert was the main songwriter and vocalist for Seven Places which was signed to BEC Recordings. The group amiably disbanded in 2005 to pursue other projects.

The band members were all originally from Medford, Oregon. &quot;Our name is about the seven places Jesus Christ bled from to save us from our sins,&quot; vocalist Seth explains. &quot;His hands cover the sinful things we&#x27;ve done with our hands. His feet cover the places of sin we&#x27;ve walked. His back covers all the times we&#x27;ve turned our back on Him, and His side, which is really from His heart, allows our hardened hearts to be softened. It is all about His blood and the fact that we&#x27;re being covered by it at all points.&quot; Seth Gilbert currently works in the Music Ministry of Applegate Christian Fellowship in southern Oregon. Tony Pallotta became a music pastor at Mountain Christian Fellowship. Tyler Jones is married and lives in Portland, Oregon. Dave Luetkenhoelter and Jeffrey Gilbert joined Kutless, filling in the positions of bassist and drummer, respectively.

Seven Places disbanded shortly after the release of &quot;Hear Us Say Jesus&quot; in 2004, but a new 11-track album entitled &quot;Glowing&quot; was released on June 26, 2007, by BEC Recordings.

<text>Skillet is an American Christian rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1996. The band currently consists of husband and wife duo John Cooper (lead vocals, bass) and Korey Cooper (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals) along with Jen Ledger (drums, co-lead vocals) and Seth Morrison (lead guitar). The band has released twelve studio albums, two of which, &quot;Collide&quot; and &quot;Comatose&quot;, received Grammy nominations. Two of their albums, &quot;Comatose&quot; and &quot;Awake&quot;, are certified Platinum and Double Platinum respectively by the RIAA, while &quot;Rise&quot; and &quot;Unleashed&quot; are certified Gold . Four of their songs, &quot;Monster&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, &quot;Awake and Alive&quot;, and &quot;Feel Invincible&quot;, are certified Multi-Platinum (5× Platinum, 3× Platinum, and 2× Platinum, respectively), while another three, &quot;Whispers in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Comatose&quot;, and &quot;The Resistance&quot; are certified Platinum, and another five, &quot;Rebirthing&quot;, &quot;Not Gonna Die&quot;, &quot;The Last Night&quot;, &quot;Legendary&quot;, and &quot;Stars&quot; are certified Gold.

Skillet went through several lineup changes early in their career, leaving founder John Cooper as the only original member remaining in the band. They are known for a relentless touring schedule, which garnered them a top five ranking in the Hardest Working Bands of 2010 by Songkick.com.

== Band history ==
=== Early years (1996–2001) ===
Skillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but they disbanded soon after, so John and Ken&#x27;s pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side project. They decided to name the experiment &quot;Skillet&quot;. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996, they released their demo album &quot;Right Upside Your Head&quot;. On October 29 of the same year, they released a self-titled debut &quot;Skillet&quot;. It was well received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States.

Cooper has said the band&#x27;s name was meant to be humorous, as the other founding members had already been in other bands, each with a different sound and style. The pastor of Covenant Community Church in Memphis—where the band was formed as a worship band side project—gave them their name as he felt they were like &quot;southern cooking, where you just toss a bunch of different things into a big ol&#x27; skillet and see what it turns out like.&quot;

Skillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled &quot;Hey You, I Love Your Soul&quot;, which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band&#x27;s first release. With this release, Skillet abandoned their grunge approach for a lighter industrial alternative rock and style. Cooper&#x27;s wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate his performance duties.

Shortly before the band began recording for their third album, &quot;Invincible&quot;, Steorts left to be with his family and launch Visible Music College, and Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist. Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of &quot;Invincible&quot;. Because of this change, the musical style on &quot;Invincible&quot; changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of &quot;Invincible&quot; in early 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer&#x27;s position.

The band released their first worship album and fourth album overall, &quot;Ardent Worship&quot;, in late 2000. The band kept much of their sound from &quot;Invincible&quot; on their next album &quot;Alien Youth&quot;. With little time between touring and recording, Skillet released &quot;Alien Youth&quot; on August 28, 2001, which was the first album that John Cooper took on production duties. Before the release of &quot;Alien Youth&quot;, Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar.

=== Ardent and breakthrough (2003–2011) ===

In 2003, &quot;Collide&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released by Ardent Records and contained the singles &quot;Savior&quot; and &quot;Collide&quot;. In 2004, the rights to &quot;Collide&quot; were bought by Lava Records, an imprint of Atlantic Records. On May 25, 2004, &quot;Collide&quot; was re-released by Lava Records, with &quot;Open Wounds&quot; as an added track. The album was nominated for &quot;Best Rock Gospel Album&quot; in 2005.

Citing P.O.D. as inspiration for the musical shift on &quot;Collide&quot;, Cooper said, &quot;Well I&#x27;m one of these song writers, everything I hear goes through my John Cooper filter of what I like and what I don&#x27;t like. [...] All these things [...] have been an influence on me.&quot;

Skillet&#x27;s album &quot;Comatose&quot; was released on October 3, 2006. It features the singles &quot;Rebirthing&quot;, &quot;Whispers in the Dark&quot;, &quot;Comatose&quot;, &quot;The Older I Get&quot;, &quot;Those Nights&quot;, &quot;The Last Night&quot; and &quot;Better Than Drugs&quot;. The album debuted at No. 55 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 4 on the US Top Christian Albums chart.

In January 2008, Skillet announced that their drummer, Lori Peters, was retiring from the band, feeling that &quot;it&#x27;s time for her to come off of the road and start a new chapter in her life.&quot; Peters&#x27; last concert with Skillet was on December 31, 2007. However, during the 2007 Christmas season, she took the time to train Skillet&#x27;s next drummer, Jen Ledger.

On October 21, 2008, &quot;Comatose Comes Alive&quot; was released; a CD/DVD combo featuring live recordings of the band&#x27;s May 9, 2008, concert in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was shown on the Gospel Music Channel on December 5, 2008. Skillet&#x27;s Comatose Comes Alive CD also had a B-side with &quot;Live Free or Let Me Die&quot; as a single, also with five acoustic tracks which purchasers could download by inserting the CD in their computer.

The Comatose album was certified Gold and Platinum in sales by the RIAA on November 3, 2009, and May 20, 2016, respectively.

Skillet&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Awake&quot;, contains twelve songs and was released on August 25, 2009. It charted at No. 2 on the Billboard top 200 selling around 68,000 units in its first week. &quot;Monster&quot; was released as a single on July 14, 2009. Contrary to popular belief, John Cooper stated that &quot;Hero&quot; was not the album&#x27;s lead single. It was, however, released as a single in March 2010. They also released a deluxe version with the extra songs &quot;Dead Inside&quot; and &quot;Would It Matter&quot;, along with the original, radio edit of &quot;Monster&quot; that does not have the distorted growl as in the single and in the CD. A remix on &quot;Monster&quot; was featured on one of their popular podcasts. The song &quot;Hero&quot; was used in the publicizing of the first football game of the 2009 NFL season between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Tennessee Titans, and the song &quot;Monster&quot; was used in the episode &quot;Jason: The Pretty-Boy Bully&quot; on MTV&#x27;s Bully Beatdown.

&quot;Monster&quot; was the theme song for the WWE event WWE Hell in a Cell, while the song &quot;Hero&quot; was the theme song for WWE Tribute to the Troops and Royal Rumble 2010. Both songs were included on the official soundtrack for the WWE video game &quot;WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010&quot;. &quot;Monster&quot; also became the theme song for the AHL team the Cleveland Monsters, being played in the player intros and after a Cleveland goal, and it serves as the opening theme of the Fresno Monsters of Fresno, California. The song was aired at the beginning of several ACC football games on Raycom Sports during the 2009 season. In the first week of April 2010, &quot;Monster&quot; was released for the Rock band music store in &quot;Rock Band 2&quot;. It also tied the record for highest-charting Christian album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with Underoath&#x27;s 2006 release &quot;Define the Great Line&quot; and Casting Crowns&#x27;s 2007 release &quot;The Altar and the Door;&quot; all three albums debuted at No. 2.

Skillet was nominated for six Dove Awards for the 41st Annual GMA Dove Awards. &quot;Awake&quot; was certified gold July 2, 2010. Also in 2010, Ardent released &quot;The Early Years&quot;, a collection of their songs from 1996 to 2001. On November 12, Skillet released an iTunes sessions EP consisting of songs from &quot;Comatose&quot; and &quot;Awake&quot;. &quot;Monster&quot; was certified gold a day later.

On February 14, 2011, Skillet officially announced that longtime lead guitarist Ben Kasica would be leaving the band. Kasica was with the band for 10 years, contributing to the albums &quot;Alien Youth&quot;, &quot;Collide&quot;, &quot;Comatose&quot;, and &quot;Awake&quot; as well as the live album &quot;Comatose Comes Alive&quot;. He played what was planned to be his last concert with the band on March 20, but returned and continued touring until a new guitarist was trained. On April 16, Seth Morrison replaced Kasica as the lead guitarist, and now tours full-time with Skillet.

Skillet announced the release of &quot;Awake and Remixed EP&quot; in early March 2011. The remixes were mainly done by Korey Cooper and Ben Kasica. On March 2, 2011, Skillet unveiled the album artwork for the album. John Cooper says the idea was conceived when Korey Cooper and Ben Kasica remixed the song Monster for their popular podcast. The four-song EP was released on March 22.

&quot;Awake&quot; was nominated for and won the &quot;Top Christian Album&quot; Award at the Billboard Music Awards 2011, and the song &quot;Awake and Alive&quot; was announced to be on the &quot;&quot; Soundtrack in May 2011.

=== Continued success (2011–present)===
On June 21, 2011, John posted to his Twitter account that the band rehearsed new music for the first time and that they are getting ready for a new album. At a question and answer session before a concert, John Cooper said that they would be recording a new record in January/February 2012. However, the band was then scheduled to headline the Winter Jam Tour. They planned to enter the studio at the conclusion of the Winter Jam eastern tour, approximately in May, for a release in late 2012.

In an interview with &quot;CCM Magazine&quot;, John Cooper described the new album as &quot;a roller coaster ride&quot;. He states: &quot;We have aggressive tracks, artsy and musical tracks, which is new territory for Skillet. A couple songs are classic American heartland anthems, and a couple songs are signature symphonic-classical rock Skillet. Guitars are dirty and edgier, with absolute shredding solos by Seth.&quot; One of the songs mentioned in the interview was titled &quot;Salvation&quot;.

In an interview on January 26, 2013, in Beaumont, Texas, John Cooper announced that the new album, &quot;Rise&quot;, would be coming out in May 2013, but was later scheduled for a June 25, 2013, release. In an interview with NoiseCreep, John Cooper stated the first single and music video is scheduled to be released by late April. The first single from the album, &quot;Sick of It&quot;, will be released to US Rock radio on April 23, 2013.

<text>The Hundalee Hills are located close to the borders of Hurunui District and Kaikōura District in Canterbury in the South Island of New Zealand.

Located 40 kilometres (24.85 mi) to the south of Kaikōura, Hundalee Hills are known largely for a notorious stretch of State Highway 1 between Kaikōura and Christchurch. The road winds sharply around the edge of several hills, as does the Conway River, which reaches the Pacific Ocean close to the Hundalees.

Within the Hundalee Hills is the rural locality of Hundalee. This was briefly a terminus of the Main North Line railway that winds its way through the Hundalee Hills, and it was also the home of World War II hero Charles Upham after he returned from combat.

<text>In logic, a rule of inference is admissible in a formal system if the set of theorems of the system does not change when that rule is added to the existing rules of the system. In other words, every formula that can be derived using that rule is already derivable without that rule, so, in a sense, it is redundant. The concept of an admissible rule was introduced by Paul Lorenzen (1955).

==Definitions==

Admissibility has been systematically studied only in the case of structural (i.e. substitution-closed) rules in propositional non-classical logics, which we will describe next.

Let a set of basic propositional connectives be fixed (for instance, formula_1 in the case of superintuitionistic logics, or formula_2 in the case of monomodal logics). Well-formed formulas are built freely using these connectives from a countably infinite set of propositional variables &quot;p&quot;0, &quot;p&quot;1, ... A substitution &quot;σ&quot; is a function from formulas to formulas that commutes with applications of the connectives, i.e.,
:formula_3
for every connective &quot;f&quot;, and formulas &quot;A&quot;1, ... , &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;. (We may also apply substitutions to sets Γ of formulas, making ) A Tarski-style consequence relation is a relation formula_4 between sets of formulas, and formulas, such that
for all formulas &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and sets of formulas Γ, Δ. A consequence relation such that

for all substitutions &quot;σ&quot; is called structural. (Note that the term &quot;structural&quot; as used here and below is unrelated to the notion of structural rules in sequent calculi.) A structural consequence relation is called a propositional logic. A formula &quot;A&quot; is a theorem of a logic formula_4 if formula_6.

For example, we identify a superintuitionistic logic &quot;L&quot; with its standard consequence relation formula_7 generated by modus ponens and axioms, and we identify a normal modal logic with its global consequence relation formula_7 generated by modus ponens, necessitation, and (as axioms) the theorems of the logic.

A structural inference rule (or just rule for short) is given by a pair (Γ, &quot;B&quot;), usually written as
:formula_9
where Γ = {&quot;A&quot;1, ... , &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;} is a finite set of formulas, and &quot;B&quot; is a formula. An instance of the rule is
:formula_10
for a substitution &quot;σ&quot;. The rule Γ/&quot;B&quot; is derivable in formula_4, if formula_12. It is admissible if for every instance of the rule, &quot;σB&quot; is a theorem whenever all formulas from &quot;σ&quot;Γ are theorems. In other words, a rule is admissible if it, when added to the logic, does not lead to new theorems. We also write formula_13 if Γ/&quot;B&quot; is admissible. (Note that formula_14 is a structural consequence relation on its own.)

Every derivable rule is admissible, but not vice versa in general. A logic is structurally complete if every admissible rule is derivable, i.e., formula_15.

In logics with a well-behaved conjunction connective (such as superintuitionistic or modal logics), a rule formula_16 is equivalent to formula_17 with respect to admissibility and derivability. It is therefore customary to only deal with unary rules &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot;.

==Examples==

*Classical propositional calculus (&quot;CPC&quot;) is structurally complete. Indeed, assume that &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; is a non-derivable rule, and fix an assignment &quot;v&quot; such that &quot;v&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = 1, and &quot;v&quot;(&quot;B&quot;) = 0. Define a substitution &quot;σ&quot; such that for every variable &quot;p&quot;, &quot;σp&quot; = formula_18 if &quot;v&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = 1, and &quot;σp&quot; = formula_19 if &quot;v&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) = 0. Then &quot;σA&quot; is a theorem, but &quot;σB&quot; is not (in fact, ¬&quot;σB&quot; is a theorem). Thus the rule &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; is not admissible either. (The same argument applies to any multi-valued logic &quot;L&quot; complete with respect to a logical matrix all of whose elements have a name in the language of &quot;L&quot;.)
*The Kreisel–Putnam rule (also known as Harrop&#x27;s rule, or independence of premise rule)
::formula_20
:is admissible in the intuitionistic propositional calculus (&quot;IPC&quot;). In fact, it is admissible in every superintuitionistic logic. On the other hand, the formula
::formula_21
:is not an intuitionistic theorem; hence &quot;KPR&quot; is not derivable in &quot;IPC&quot;. In particular, &quot;IPC&quot; is not structurally complete.
*The rule
::formula_22
:is admissible in many modal logics, such as &quot;K&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;GL&quot; (see this table for names of modal logics). It is derivable in &quot;S&quot;4, but it is not derivable in &quot;K&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, or &quot;GL&quot;.
*The rule
::formula_23
:is admissible in normal logic formula_24. It is derivable in &quot;GL&quot; and &quot;S&quot;4.1, but it is not derivable in &quot;K&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;4, or &quot;S&quot;5.
*Löb&#x27;s rule
::formula_25
:is admissible (but not derivable) in the basic modal logic &quot;K&quot;, and it is derivable in &quot;GL&quot;. However, &quot;LR&quot; is not admissible in &quot;K&quot;4. In particular, it is &quot;not&quot; true in general that a rule admissible in a logic &quot;L&quot; must be admissible in its extensions.
*The Gödel–Dummett logic (&quot;LC&quot;), and the modal logic &quot;Grz&quot;.3 are structurally complete. The product fuzzy logic is also structurally complete.

==Decidability and reduced rules==

The basic question about admissible rules of a given logic is whether the set of all admissible rules is decidable. Note that the problem is nontrivial even if the logic itself (i.e., its set of theorems) is decidable: the definition of admissibility of a rule &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; involves an unbounded universal quantifier over all propositional substitutions. Hence &quot;a priori&quot; we only know that admissibility of rule in a decidable logic is formula_26 (i.e., its complement is recursively enumerable). For instance, it is known that admissibility in the bimodal logics &quot;K&quot;&quot;u&quot; and &quot;K&quot;4&quot;u&quot; (the extensions of &quot;K&quot; or &quot;K&quot;4 with the universal modality) is undecidable. Remarkably, decidability of admissibility in the basic modal logic &quot;K&quot; is a major open problem.

Nevertheless, admissibility of rules is known to be decidable in many modal and superintuitionistic logics. The first decision procedures for admissible rules in basic transitive modal logics were constructed by Rybakov, using the reduced form of rules. A modal rule in variables &quot;p&quot;0, ... , &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; is called reduced if it has the form
:formula_27
where each formula_28 is either blank, or negation formula_29. For each rule &quot;r&quot;, we can effectively construct a reduced rule &quot;s&quot; (called the reduced form of &quot;r&quot;) such that any logic admits (or derives) &quot;r&quot; if and only if it admits (or derives) &quot;s&quot;, by introducing extension variables for all subformulas in &quot;A&quot;, and expressing the result in the full disjunctive normal form. It is thus sufficient to construct a decision algorithm for admissibility of reduced rules.

Let formula_30 be a reduced rule as above. We identify every conjunction formula_31 with the set formula_32 of its conjuncts. For any subset &quot;W&quot; of the set formula_33 of all conjunctions, let us define a Kripke model formula_34 by
:formula_35
:formula_36
Then the following provides an algorithmic criterion for admissibility in &quot;K&quot;4:

Theorem. The rule formula_30 is &quot;not&quot; admissible in &quot;K&quot;4 if and only if there exists a set formula_38 such that
#formula_39 for some formula_40
#formula_41 for every formula_40
#for every subset &quot;D&quot; of &quot;W&quot; there exist elements formula_43 such that the equivalences
::formula_44 if and only if formula_45 for every formula_46
::formula_44 if and only if formula_48 and formula_45 for every formula_46
:hold for all &quot;j&quot;.

Similar criteria can be found for the logics &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;GL&quot;, and &quot;Grz&quot;. Furthermore, admissibility in intuitionistic logic can be reduced to admissibility in &quot;Grz&quot; using the Gödel–McKinsey–Tarski translation:
:formula_51 if and only if formula_52

Rybakov (1997) developed much more sophisticated techniques for showing decidability of admissibility, which apply to a robust (infinite) class of transitive (i.e., extending &quot;K&quot;4 or &quot;IPC&quot;) modal and superintuitionistic logics, including e.g. &quot;S&quot;4.1, &quot;S&quot;4.2, &quot;S&quot;4.3, &quot;KC&quot;, &quot;T&quot;&quot;k&quot; (as well as the above-mentioned logics &quot;IPC&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;Grz&quot;).

Despite being decidable, the admissibility problem has relatively high computational complexity, even in simple logics: admissibility of rules in the basic transitive logics &quot;IPC&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;Grz&quot; is coNEXP-complete. This should be contrasted with the derivability problem (for rules or formulas) in these logics, which is PSPACE-complete.

==Projectivity and unification==

Admissibility in propositional logics is closely related to unification in the equational theory of modal or Heyting algebras. The connection was developed by Ghilardi (1999, 2000). In the logical setup, a unifier of a formula &quot;A&quot; in the language of a logic &quot;L&quot; (an &quot;L&quot;-unifier for short) is a substitution &quot;σ&quot; such that &quot;σA&quot; is a theorem of &quot;L&quot;. (Using this notion, we can rephrase admissibility of a rule &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; in &quot;L&quot; as &quot;every &quot;L&quot;-unifier of &quot;A&quot; is an &quot;L&quot;-unifier of &quot;B&quot;&quot;.) An &quot;L&quot;-unifier &quot;σ&quot; is less general than an &quot;L&quot;-unifier &quot;τ&quot;, written as &quot;σ&quot; ≤ &quot;τ&quot;, if there exists a substitution &quot;υ&quot; such that
:formula_53
for every variable &quot;p&quot;. A complete set of unifiers of a formula &quot;A&quot; is a set &quot;S&quot; of &quot;L&quot;-unifiers of &quot;A&quot; such that every &quot;L&quot;-unifier of &quot;A&quot; is less general than some unifier from &quot;S&quot;. A most general unifier (MGU) of &quot;A&quot; is a unifier &quot;σ&quot; such that {&quot;σ&quot;} is a complete set of unifiers of &quot;A&quot;. It follows that if &quot;S&quot; is a complete set of unifiers of &quot;A&quot;, then a rule &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; is &quot;L&quot;-admissible if and only if every &quot;σ&quot; in &quot;S&quot; is an &quot;L&quot;-unifier of &quot;B&quot;. Thus we can characterize admissible rules if we can find well-behaved complete sets of unifiers.

An important class of formulas that have a most general unifier are the projective formulas: these are formulas &quot;A&quot; such that there exists a unifier &quot;σ&quot; of &quot;A&quot; such that
:formula_54
for every formula &quot;B&quot;. Note that &quot;σ&quot; is an MGU of &quot;A&quot;. In transitive modal and superintuitionistic logics with the finite model property, one can characterize projective formulas semantically as those whose set of finite &quot;L&quot;-models has the extension property: if &quot;M&quot; is a finite Kripke &quot;L&quot;-model with a root &quot;r&quot; whose cluster is a singleton, and the formula &quot;A&quot; holds at all points of &quot;M&quot; except for &quot;r&quot;, then we can change the valuation of variables in &quot;r&quot; so as to make &quot;A&quot; true at &quot;r&quot; as well. Moreover, the proof provides an explicit construction of an MGU for a given projective formula &quot;A&quot;.

In the basic transitive logics &quot;IPC&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;Grz&quot; (and more generally in any transitive logic with the finite model property whose set of finite frame satisfies another kind of extension property), we can effectively construct for any formula &quot;A&quot; its projective approximation Π(&quot;A&quot;): a finite set of projective formulas such that
#formula_55 for every formula_56
#every unifier of &quot;A&quot; is a unifier of a formula from Π(&quot;A&quot;).
It follows that the set of MGUs of elements of Π(&quot;A&quot;) is a complete set of unifiers of &quot;A&quot;. Furthermore, if &quot;P&quot; is a projective formula, then
:formula_57 if and only if formula_58
for any formula &quot;B&quot;. Thus we obtain the following effective characterization of admissible rules:
:formula_59 if and only if formula_60

==Bases of admissible rules==

Let &quot;L&quot; be a logic. A set &quot;R&quot; of &quot;L&quot;-admissible rules is called a basis of admissible rules, if every admissible rule Γ/&quot;B&quot; can be derived from &quot;R&quot; and the derivable rules of &quot;L&quot;, using substitution, composition, and weakening. In other words, &quot;R&quot; is a basis if and only if formula_61 is the smallest structural consequence relation that includes formula_7 and &quot;R&quot;.

Notice that decidability of admissible rules of a decidable logic is equivalent to the existence of recursive (or recursively enumerable) bases: on the one hand, the set of &quot;all&quot; admissible rules is a recursive basis if admissibility is decidable. On the other hand, the set of admissible rules is always co-recursively enumerable, and if we further have a recursively enumerable basis, set of admissible rules is also recursively enumerable; hence it is decidable. (In other words, we can decide admissibility of &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; by the following algorithm: we start in parallel two exhaustive searches, one for a substitution &quot;σ&quot; that unifies &quot;A&quot; but not &quot;B&quot;, and one for a derivation of &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; from &quot;R&quot; and formula_7. One of the searches has to eventually come up with an answer.) Apart from decidability, explicit bases of admissible rules are useful for some applications, e.g. in proof complexity.

For a given logic, we can ask whether it has a recursive or finite basis of admissible rules, and to provide an explicit basis. If a logic has no finite basis, it can nevertheless have an independent basis: a basis &quot;R&quot; such that no proper subset of &quot;R&quot; is a basis.

In general, very little can be said about existence of bases with desirable properties. For example, while tabular logics are generally well-behaved, and always finitely axiomatizable, there exist tabular modal logics without a finite or independent basis of rules. Finite bases are relatively rare: even the basic transitive logics &quot;IPC&quot;, &quot;K&quot;4, &quot;S&quot;4, &quot;GL&quot;, &quot;Grz&quot; do not have a finite basis of admissible rules, though they have independent bases.

===Examples of bases===
*The empty set is a basis of &quot;L&quot;-admissible rules if and only if &quot;L&quot; is structurally complete.
*Every extension of the modal logic &quot;S&quot;4.3 (including, notably, &quot;S&quot;5) has a finite basis consisting of the single rule
::formula_64
*&#x27;s rules
::formula_65
:are a basis of admissible rules in &quot;IPC&quot; or &quot;KC&quot;.
*The rules
::formula_66
:are a basis of admissible rules of &quot;GL&quot;. (Note that the empty disjunction is defined as formula_19.)
*The rules
::formula_68
:are a basis of admissible rules of &quot;S&quot;4 or &quot;Grz&quot;.

==Semantics for admissible rules==

A rule Γ/&quot;B&quot; is valid in a modal or intuitionistic Kripke frame formula_69, if the following is true for every valuation formula_70 in &quot;F&quot;:
:if for all formula_71 formula_72, then formula_73.
(The definition readily generalizes to general frames, if needed.)

Let &quot;X&quot; be a subset of &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;t&quot; a point in &quot;W&quot;. We say that &quot;t&quot; is
*a reflexive tight predecessor of &quot;X&quot;, if for every &quot;y&quot; in &quot;W&quot;: &quot;t R y&quot; if and only if &quot;t&quot; = &quot;y&quot; or for some &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;: &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; or &quot;x R y&quot; ,
*an irreflexive tight predecessor of &quot;X&quot;, if for every &quot;y&quot; in &quot;W&quot;: &quot;t R y&quot; if and only if for some &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;: &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; or &quot;x R y&quot; .
We say that a frame &quot;F&quot; has reflexive (irreflexive) tight predecessors, if for every &quot;finite&quot; subset &quot;X&quot; of &quot;W&quot;, there exists a reflexive (irreflexive) tight predecessor of &quot;X&quot; in &quot;W&quot;.

We have:
*a rule is admissible in &quot;IPC&quot; if and only if it is valid in all intuitionistic frames that have reflexive tight predecessors,
*a rule is admissible in &quot;K&quot;4 if and only if it is valid in all transitive frames that have reflexive and irreflexive tight predecessors,
*a rule is admissible in &quot;S&quot;4 if and only if it is valid in all transitive reflexive frames that have reflexive tight predecessors,
*a rule is admissible in &quot;GL&quot; if and only if it is valid in all transitive converse well-founded frames that have irreflexive tight predecessors.

Note that apart from a few trivial cases, frames with tight predecessors must be infinite. Hence admissible rules in basic transitive logics do not enjoy the finite model property.

==Structural completeness==

While a general classification of structurally complete logics is not an easy task, we have a good understanding of some special cases.

Intuitionistic logic itself is not structurally complete, but its &quot;fragments&quot; may behave differently. Namely, any disjunction-free rule or implication-free rule admissible in a superintuitionistic logic is derivable. On the other hand, the Mints rule
:formula_74
is admissible in intuitionistic logic but not derivable, and contains only implications and disjunctions.

We know the &quot;maximal&quot; structurally incomplete transitive logics. A logic is called hereditarily structurally complete, if any extension is structurally complete. For example, classical logic, as well as the logics &quot;LC&quot; and &quot;Grz&quot;.3 mentioned above, are hereditarily structurally complete. A complete description of hereditarily structurally complete superintuitionistic and transitive modal logics was given respectively by Citkin and Rybakov. Namely, a superintuitionistic logic is hereditarily structurally complete if and only if it is not valid in any of the five Kripke frames
Similarly, an extension of &quot;K&quot;4 is hereditarily structurally complete if and only if it is not valid in any of certain twenty Kripke frames (including the five intuitionistic frames above).

There exist structurally complete logics that are not hereditarily structurally complete: for example, Medvedev&#x27;s logic is structurally complete, but it is included in the structurally incomplete logic &quot;KC&quot;.

==Variants==

A rule with parameters is a rule of the form
:formula_75
whose variables are divided into the &quot;regular&quot; variables &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;, and the parameters &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;. The rule is &quot;L&quot;-admissible if every &quot;L&quot;-unifier &quot;σ&quot; of &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;σs&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; is also a unifier of &quot;B&quot;. The basic decidability results for admissible rules also carry to rules with parameters.

A multiple-conclusion rule is a pair (Γ,Δ) of two finite sets of formulas, written as
:formula_76
Such a rule is admissible if every unifier of Γ is also a unifier of some formula from Δ. For example, a logic &quot;L&quot; is consistent iff it admits the rule
:formula_77
and a superintuitionistic logic has the disjunction property iff it admits the rule
:formula_78
Again, basic results on admissible rules generalize smoothly to multiple-conclusion rules. In logics with a variant of the disjunction property, the multiple-conclusion rules have the same expressive power as single-conclusion rules: for example, in &quot;S&quot;4 the rule above is equivalent to
:formula_79
Nevertheless, multiple-conclusion rules can often be employed to simplify arguments.

In proof theory, admissibility is often considered in the context of sequent calculi, where the basic objects are sequents rather than formulas. For example, one can rephrase the cut-elimination theorem as saying that the cut-free sequent calculus admits the cut rule
:formula_80
(By abuse of language, it is also sometimes said that the (full) sequent calculus admits cut, meaning its cut-free version does.) However, admissibility in sequent calculi is usually only a notational variant for admissibility in the corresponding logic: any complete calculus for (say) intuitionistic logic admits a sequent rule if and only if &quot;IPC&quot; admits the formula rule that we obtain by translating each sequent formula_81 to its characteristic formula formula_82.

<text>A paper cut occurs when a piece of paper or other thin, sharp material slices a person&#x27;s skin, most often on the upper part of the index finger. Notably, &quot;paper&quot; cuts can also be caused by thin, stiff, and abrasive materials other than paper. Paper cuts can be highly painful, even though they may bleed very little, if at all.

Although a loose sheet of paper is usually too soft to cut the skin, it can be very thin (sometimes as thin as a razor&#x27;s edge), and can thus exert enough pressure to cause a cut. Paper cuts are most often caused by paper sheets that are strongly fastened together (such as a brand new sheet of paper out of a ream), because a single sheet might be dislocated from the rest. In this case, all the other sheets are holding this dislocated sheet in position, making it stiff enough to act as a razor.

Paper cuts can be very painful, as they can stimulate a large number of skin surface nociceptors (pain receptors) in a very small area of the skin. Because the cut typically does not bleed much, the pain receptors are left open to the air, causing continued pain. This can be exacerbated by irritation caused by the fibers in the paper itself, which may be coated in chemicals such as bleach. Additionally, most paper cuts occur in the fingers, which have a greater concentration of sensory receptors than the rest of the body.

<text>Daniel Thomas McCarty (January 18, 1912 – September 28, 1953) was an American politician who served in the Florida House of Representatives and served as its speaker. He briefly served as the 31st Governor of Florida from January 6, 1953, until his death on September 28, 1953.

==Early life==
Dan McCarty was born on January 18, 1912, in Fort Pierce, Florida, and was the son of Daniel Thomas McCarty and Frances Lardner Moore. His grandfather, Charles &quot;C.T.&quot; Tobin McCarty would begin an operation growing pineapples during the 1880s in St. Lucie County. C.T. was killed during a real estate dispute when he was leaving a barber shop in Fort Pierce on January 30, 1907.

His family was described as being prominent and he grew up in a large house on Indian River Drive just south of the present courthouse in downtown Fort Pierce. He attended the local public school in the area, Delaware Avenue School. While attending high school he would be the captain of the school&#x27;s football team, editor-in-chief of the school yearbook and serve as vice president of his class. After high school he would go to the University of Florida. While at the University of Florida he was extremely active within Florida Blue Key, Student Government, the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity, and ROTC.

After finishing his education in 1934, McCarty became a cattleman and citrus grower in Fort Pierce. He married Olie Brown with whom he had three children.

During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army, was promoted to the rank of colonel, and was decorated with the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, the Legion of Merit, and the French Croix de Guerre. During World War II, he distinguished himself by being among those who landed on D-Day with the Seventh Army in the South of France.

==Political career==
He began his political career when in 1937, he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives where he served until 1941. During the 1941 session, he served as speaker of the house.

In 1948 he was the runner up for the Democratic nomination for governor. Four years later in 1952, he ran for governor again, and this time was successful in winning the office. During his tenure, he reformed purchasing and hiring practices by the state government, boosted teachers&#x27; salaries and created scholarships for teacher training, opposed oil exploration in the Everglades, and instituted aid programs for the disabled. A chain smoker, McCarty&#x27;s health was already weakened by the end of the 1952 gubernatorial contest.

On February 25, 1953, shortly after assuming the governorship, he suffered a debilitating heart attack. For months McCarty struggled to regain his strength, spending most of his days working in the Governor&#x27;s mansion. Finally in early September he contracted a severe case of pneumonia and died on September 28, 1953, in Tallahassee. After a large funeral at his lifelong parish church, the old Carpenter Gothic St. Andrew&#x27;s Episcopal Church across the street from his boyhood home in Fort Pierce, he was buried in the Palms Cemetery in Ankona.

== Honors ==
Dan McCarty Middle School, in St. Lucie County, was named in his honor.

A sabal palm tree was planted on the grounds of the Florida State Capitol in honor of him. He signed a bill as governor making the sabal palm the official state tree.

The mention of &quot;Radomir&#x27;s village&quot; (as part of a review of boyar property in the area) in a 1392 document (&quot;uric&quot;) is generally believed to be the town&#x27;s first mention, and indication of the origin of the name &quot;Rădăuți&quot; (other theories state that the settlement had its origins in earlier periods, and that the name is a Slavic-influenced derivative of the Latin word &quot;Rottacenum&quot;, as allegedly used by soldiers in the Roman garrison in Siret). The oldest mention of Rădăuți as such dates from 1413, in a document issued by Moldavian Prince Alexandru cel Bun.

By the middle of the 14th century, Rădăuți was already a flourishing settlement, the seat of a prominent Eastern Orthodox church during the times of Bogdan I (1359–1365), and subsequently a bishopric. Around the St. Nicholas church (Bogdana Monastery), archaeologists have uncovered a habitation layer preceding Bogdan&#x27;s period of rule, one which could point to the existence of a local center prior to the foundation of Moldavia.

Awarded the privilege of organizing fairs, Rădăuți evolved due to its favorable location midway between the Carpathian Mountains and the tableland area (with traders from both regions establishing contact in the local market). The fairs at Rădăuți have been dated to the time of Stephen the Great (a document from 1481; however, since the mention includes details of Stephen&#x27;s intervention in solving a commercial dispute, it is possible that the fairs were well established by then).

Rădăuți has a cathedral, built in 1402, with the tombs of several Moldavian princes. Rădăuți was also the seat of a Greek bishopric, moved to Chernivtsi in 1786.

Rădăuți was one of the largest cities of the Duchy of Bukovina during the period of Habsburg administration (1775–1918). During that time it saw a high level of German (especially Swabian) immigration, which would later form the basis for the Bukovina Germans in the whole region.

==Jewish history of Rădăuți==
A Jewish community was present before the Habsburg takeover, and is attested to have been overseen by a &quot;starost&quot;.

Many Jews fleeing the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria (as well as other Habsburg areas) from intense persecution and anti-Semitism during the Middle Ages settled in Rădăuți. The community was allowed a degree of self-administration, and witnessed a period of prosperity and cultural effervescence during the 19th century.

The majority of Rădăuți&#x27;s Jewish population was exterminated during the Holocaust. Persecutions became widespread around 1938, when Jews were harassed and attacked by authorities under the Octavian Goga government; they were confirmed by anti-Semitic legislation passed by the Ion Gigurtu cabinet, and, in late 1940, exceptionally violent following the establishment of the National Legionary State. In October 1941, all Jews present in Rădăuți (more than 10,000) were deported to concentration camps in Transnistria Governorate.

==Bogdana Monastery==
The Princely Church at Rădăuți contained the graves of Bogdan I and his son Lațcu, both Voivodes/Princes of Moldavia, as well as a later ruler, Roman I of Moldavia. Is the oldest monastery from Moldova and Bucovina (1365). Inside the monastery there are 14 tombs (like Bogdan I (1359–1365), Lațcu Voievod (1365–1373), Roman I (1391–1394), Ștefan I (1394–1399), Bogdan, the brother Alexandru cel Bun, Bogdan, son of Alexandru cel Bun and others.

<text>Children of the Sun is a dieselpunk tabletop role-playing game created by the now defunct Misguided Games, Inc. in 2002. Set on Krace, an island of giant, supernaturally tough trees, it was part of a generation of dieselpunk settings that appeared beginning in the late 1990s. Most notable about the game was its original Token System, which allowed the player to use a token to determine initiative and to interrupt other character&#x27;s turns.

<text>Hoshang Shah (1406–1435) was the first formally appointed Sultan of the Malwa Sultanate of Central India. Also called Hoshang Shah Ghori, he was known as Alp Khan before he took on the title Hoshang Shah after being crowned the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate. Alp Khan&#x27;s father Dilawar Khan Ghori had belonged to the court of Firuz Shah Tughlaq, the Sultan of Delhi. Dilawar Khan Gori was appointed governor of Malwa probably by Firuz of the house of Tughlaq, but made himself independent of the Delhi Sultanate for all practical purposes in 1401. Thus he had practically come to Mandu in 1401 as the first King of Malwa, although he did not declare himself a king.

<text>Kid Dynamite was an American hardcore punk band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They formed in 1997 and broke up in 2000, while reuniting sporadically since then until 2013. They were signed to Jade Tree Records.

==History==
===20th century===
Kid Dynamite was formed in 1997 by drummer Dave Wagenschutz and guitarist Dan Yemin, who had both played in the influential New Jersey band Lifetime. After their dissolution, Yemin expressed interest in forming a new band. He called friend Steve Ferrell to fill the role as the bassist and Wagenschutz on drums, rounding out the rhythm section. They then went into the studio to record the music for what would become their first demo. After trying out multiple singers, they settled on Jason Shevchuk, who previously sang for straight edge band Bound. With this lineup intact, Jason added vocals over the music the band previously recorded, naming the demo &#x27;Six Songs With Jay Singing&#x27;. They played their first show on April 22, 1998, in Philadelphia, opening for Better Than a Thousand. From there, the band played shows up and down the East Coast of the United States throughout the summer of that year. 

In the fall of 1998, they entered the studio to record their first full length album with Steve Evetts, who had previously worked with Lifetime on their albums Hello Bastards and Jersey&#x27;s Best Dancers. Kid Dynamite released their self-titled debut on October 27, 1998, through Jade Tree to immediate popularity. After the album&#x27;s release, the band continued to gig throughout the winter of 1998. In 1999, bassist Steve Ferrell departed the band on good terms and was temporarily replaced by Ernie Parada of GreyArea. The bassist position was then permanently filled by Michael &#x27;Spider&#x27; Cotterman. In the summer of 1999, the band embarked on their first cross-country tour opening for Good Riddance, alongside Boston&#x27;s In My Eyes. From there, they spent the rest of the year on the road with other bands including Kill Your Idols, Snapcase, and Buried Alive. In between that, they went back into the studio to record what would be their last album &quot;Shorter, Faster, Louder&quot;. After the album&#x27;s completion, Shevchuk left in December 1999 to finish film school. Though it was rumoured that Jesse Standhard of Right Brigade had taken over as the lead singer, it was ultimately proven false. 

===21st century===
&quot;Shorter, Faster, Louder&quot; was released on February 15, 2000. Kid Dynamite did two final shows on February 18 and 19, 2000 at the First Unitarian Church in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

In April 2003, the band played three reunion shows as benefits for the Syrentha J. Savio Endowment, to help early breast cancer detection. The three shows raised over $20,000 total towards the endowment. In 2003, the band&#x27;s label Jade Tree put out a compilation of rare and live material titled &quot;Cheap Shots, Youth Anthems&quot;, in September 2003, which featured a teaser DVD for a forthcoming live DVD that will include footage from the band&#x27;s 2003 reunion shows for the Syrentha Savio Endowment charity.

In 2005, the band played a reunion show as a benefit for New York City&#x27;s historic CBGB venue on August 22, 2005. The opening bands were Take My Chances (ex-The Backup Plan), Voice in the Wire, and GreyArea. Ernie Parada joined the band onstage for their cover of &#x27;Birthdays&#x27; by Token Entry, who he played drums for in the 1980&#x27;s. The band jokingly came up with a new &quot;song&quot; during the soundcheck called &quot;Whoa Dave Can You Hear Me&quot;; in which they tested out their equipment to see if everything was set up properly while Jason Shevchuk screamed &quot;Whoa Dave can you hear me&quot; over and over.

On February 21, 2006, Jade Tree released the DVD &quot;Four Years In One Gulp&quot;, a DVD documentary on the band. It features commentary about Kid Dynamite from members of the band and several friends regarding the bands history, with narration by Jason Shevchuk. It also included 25 live performances throughout the band&#x27;s lifetime. &quot;Carry the Torch: A Tribute to Kid Dynamite&quot; was released by Get Outta Town Records in 2009. The album contains covers of every song the band recorded interpreted by other punk and hardcore adjacent bands.

The band has performed other reunion shows at &quot;This Is Hardcore&quot; fest in 2010, and &quot;Fuck Yeah Fest&quot; in Los Angeles, on September 3, 2011, The Fest 10 in Gainesville, Florida, and FunFunFunFest 2011 in Austin, Texas.

In 2013, the band officially announced they were breaking up. They played their last shows at This Is Hardcore Fest in Philadelphia and in New York with Swearin’ and Joyce Manor.

<text>The B Sixth Avenue Express is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or &quot;bullet&quot;, is colored , since it uses the IND Sixth Avenue Line in Manhattan.

The B operates weekdays during daytime hours only. Weekday rush hour and midday service operates between Bedford Park Boulevard in the Bronx and Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, making all stops in the Bronx and express stops in Manhattan (between 34th and West Fourth Streets) and in Brooklyn. Limited midday and all evening service short turns at 145th Street and does not operate to and from Bedford Park Boulevard.

From the opening of the IND Sixth Avenue Line in 1940 until November 25, 1967, the B ran exclusively in Manhattan, as the BB, from 168th Street in Washington Heights during rush hours to 34th Street–Herald Square in Midtown Manhattan. Upon the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection on November 26, 1967, the B started running via the BMT West End Line (local) and BMT Fourth Avenue Line (express) in Brooklyn and ran over the Manhattan Bridge directly from Sixth Avenue. A short-lived B service marked with a bullet ran via the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan and the BMT West End Line in Brooklyn from 1986 to 1988 due to Manhattan Bridge renovation, while a B service traveled the BB route between 168th and 34th Streets. After 1989, the B north of 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center used the IND Eighth Avenue Line to 168th Street on weekdays, and the IND 63rd Street Line on evenings and weekends. Late night service ran as a shuttle on the West End Line. Weekday service was rerouted to the Concourse Line in 1998, while off-peak service along 63rd Street ceased in 2000. The B started using the Brighton Line in 2004 after work on the north side of the Manhattan Bridge was completed.

== History ==

The designation B was originally intended for express trains originating from the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan and operating in Midtown Manhattan on the IND Sixth Avenue Line. However, the express &quot;B&quot; designation was not used. Instead, beginning with the opening of the Sixth Avenue Line on December 15, 1940, local trains ran as rush-hour only local services between 168th Street–Washington Heights and 34th Street–Herald Square. These services were designated BB, conforming with the Independent Subway System (IND) convention using double letters to indicate local services.

=== Chrystie Street Connection ===

The Chrystie Street Connection and the express tracks of the Sixth Avenue Line opened on November 26, 1967, changing service. BB trains were combined with the former service, which ran on the BMT West End Line in Brooklyn and the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan. This created a through service from 168th Street to Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue via the Sixth Avenue Line express tracks, the Manhattan Bridge, 4th Avenue, and West End. During mid-days and Saturdays, service to and from Brooklyn terminated at West 4th Street. During late night hours and Sundays when B service did not operate, TT shuttles continued to operate on the West End Line. On July 1, 1968, the B was rerouted to terminate at the new 57th Street–Sixth Avenue station in Midtown Manhattan during middays and evenings, extending to 168th Street only during rush hours. The West End Line TT shuttles were also made part of the B route.

On June 1, 1976, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced changes in subway service that were expected to save $12.6 million annually and were the third phase of the agency&#x27;s plan to realign subway service to better reflect ridership patterns and reduced ridership. As part of the changes, which took effect on August 30, 1976, B service began running between 57th Street and Coney Island during all times, replacing K service, which had formerly run along 6th Avenue from the BMT Jamaica Line. Alternate B trains commenced operating between 168th Street and Coney Island during rush hours. On December 14, 1976, the NYCTA announced severe cuts in bus and subway service in order to cut its budget by $30 million over the following 18 months in order to achieve a balanced budget, at the request of the Emergency Financial Control Board. As part of the cuts, late night B service was cut back to running as a shuttle between 36th Street and Coney Island via the West End Line. This change took effect on August 27, 1977. Initially, the 57th Street station was to be closed during late nights. However, a B shuttle also operated during late nights, running between 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center and 57th Street.

The NYCTA approved four changes in subway service on April 27, 1981, including an increase in B service. The changes were made as part of the $1 million, two-year Rapid Transit Sufficiency Study, and were expected to take place as early as 1982, following public hearings and approval by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) board. As part of the changes, midday B service was going to be increased, replacing AA service. B service on the West End Line and Fourth Avenue Line express was to be supplemented by a new rush hour T train, running between Bay Parkway and Chambers Street on the Nassau Street Line.

On June 1, 1983, the NYCTA proposed changes to increase service along Sixth Avenue and better connecting the line to the Bronx and Queens. As part of the changes, B train service would run to 168th Street at all times, with service to 57th Street during non-rush hours replaced by a new H train running between 57th Street and World Trade Center. With the extension of B service to 168th Street, AA service would be eliminated. The changes would have gone into effect in spring or summer 1984, pending approval by the MTA board.


=== Manhattan Bridge reconstruction (1986 to 2004) ===
==== 1980s ====
The reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge between 1986 and 2004 affected B service as the bridge&#x27;s north side tracks, which led to the Sixth Avenue Line, were closed multiple times. These closures severed the connection between the northern and southern portions of the route. B service was split into two different services starting on April 26, 1986, with an expected completion date of October 26, 1986. The closure of the bridge&#x27;s north side tracks caused the return of pre-November 1967 service patterns, before the opening of the Chrystie Street Connection: The orange B duplicated the former BB service, and the yellow B imitated the old service, except for the fact that it used the Manhattan Bridge rather than the Montague Street Tunnel, as the T had. The northern B service ran via Sixth Avenue, using an orange diamond bullet, between 34th Street-Herald Square and 168th Street during rush hours only. The southern B service ran via the Manhattan Bridge and BMT Broadway Line, using a yellow bullet. It ran from Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue and terminated at Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard during rush hours; Queensboro Plaza middays, evenings, and weekends; and 36th Street late nights as a shuttle. The service running up to Astoria during rush-hours was marked with a yellow diamond bullet, to signify rush-hour service. Service to 57th Street and Grand Street on the IND Sixth Avenue Line was replaced by an S shuttle running between these two points via the Sixth Avenue local. The point of this shuttle was to provide service to the Grand Street Station on the Chrystie Street Connection directly from 6th Avenue, as the rush-hour 6th Avenue B only ran as far south as 34th Street Herald Square. From April 28, 1986, to May 23, 1987, one PM rush hour yellow B train originated from Forest Hills – 71st Avenue instead of Ditmars Boulevard. On May 24, 1987, evening and weekend Broadway Line B service was cut back from Queensboro Plaza to 57th Street–Seventh Avenue.

Through B service on the Sixth Avenue Line to Coney Island via 4th Avenue and West End resumed December 11, 1988, when the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s north side tracks reopened. Due to increased demand for Sixth Avenue service along Central Park West, B trains were extended local to 168th Street on middays and evenings, partially replacing the discontinued K service. During late nights, the B continued to operate as the West End Shuttle from 36th Street to Coney Island. B service operated to 57th Street during weekends and N service was increased to replace the discontinued yellow B service to Ditmars Boulevard. In May 1989, Sunday afternoon service was increased to run every 10 minutes instead of every 12 minutes.

With the opening of the IND 63rd Street Line on October 29, 1989, B service was extended from 57th Street to 21st Street–Queensbridge on weekends. In addition, the span of through service on weekends between Brooklyn and Manhattan was increased from 17 to 19 hours. The last Brooklyn-bound through train was the train leaving 57th Street at 1:12 a.m. as opposed to the one leaving at 12:11 a.m., and the first Manhattan-bound through trains were leaving Coney Island at 5:01 a.m. Saturdays and 5:21 a.m. Sundays, compared to 5:42 a.m. Saturday and 6:21 a.m. Sunday trains. Weekday service was also slightly modified, with Stillwell Avenue-bound trains running local along Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn until 8 a.m. instead of 7 a.m.

==== 1990s ====
On September 30, 1990, evening B service was rerouted to 21st Street–Queensbridge to replace evening orange Q service with A service running local between 145th and 168th Streets in its place. B trains stopped operating between 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center and 168th Street between 8:15 p.m. and 6:45 a.m., saving the NYCTA $1.35 million annually. Also on this date, because N service resumed running via the Manhattan Bridge, B trains began skipping DeKalb Avenue.

In January 1991, a reduction of service along the Central Park West corridor to remove excess capacity was proposed. B service would be rerouted to 21st Street–Queensbridge daily except late nights. Local service via Central Park West would be replaced by A trains; the service change was later amended for Central Park West Local service to be served by C trains instead. Late night service would remain unchanged as a West End Shuttle between 36th Street and Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue. This service change would have been implemented in October 1991, pending approval from the MTA board.

The north side of the Manhattan Bridge closed on mid-days and weekends from April 30, 1995, until November 12, 1995, during which B trains ran only between Pacific Street and Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue, running local on the BMT West End Line and express on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line.

From February 22, 1998, to May 22, 1999, B service was cut to 57th Street on evenings and weekends due to track and tunnel reconstruction of the IND 63rd Street Line. Service on that line was replaced by a shuttle to the BMT Broadway Line which ran every 20 minutes and was marked with a yellow S bullet. The 57th Street station was closed from 12:30 to 6 a.m. daily during the project. The project had initially been slated to be completed in fall 1999, but normal service resumed in May 1999, ahead of schedule.

The B and the switched northern terminals on March 1, 1998, ending the connection between the B and Washington Heights. The B was routed onto the IND Concourse Line to Bedford Park Boulevard during rush hours. Midday service terminated at 145th Street. The change was made to reduce crowding on the C and to reduce passenger confusion about the C&#x27;s route.

==== 2000s ====
On November 5, 2000, B service was taken off of the IND 63rd Street Line for signal and track work. It ran along the Eighth Avenue Line to 145th Street (terminating at Bedford Park Boulevard during rush hours) at all times except late nights. A separate B Queensbridge Shuttle continued to operate via 63rd Street during the hours the was not running; service operated between 21st Street and 34th Street–Herald Square via the Broadway Line. This shuttle service operated until January 2001, when the 63rd Street Connector east of 21st Street opened for night and weekend service diversions.

On July 22, 2001, the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s north side tracks closed and B service over the Manhattan Bridge was split into two services, similar to the 1986 changes. This time, the southern half of the route that ran via the Broadway Line was named the . The W ran from Astoria to Coney Island via Broadway Express, the Manhattan Bridge, and 4th Avenue Express before running local on West End to Coney Island. B service ran on weekdays only, from 34th Street to Bedford Park Boulevard during rush hours and from 34th Street to 145th Street during middays and evenings.

=== 2004 to present ===
The Manhattan Bridge was fully reopened to subway service on February 22, 2004. B and D trains were once again extended through Grand Street station and over the Manhattan Bridge&#x27;s north tracks into Brooklyn. However, rather than returning to the West End Line which it had served from 1967 to 2001, the B now ran express on the BMT Brighton Line to Brighton Beach (replacing the diamond express &lt;Q&gt;) that had run from July 2001 until February 2004, in order to combine two weekday-only services, while the D replaced the B on the West End Line, running express on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn. B service now operated between Brighton Beach and Bedford Park Boulevard during rush hours and Brighton Beach and 145th Street on weekday middays and evenings.

From September 14, 2009, to October 3, 2011, B trains ran local in Brooklyn due to station renovations on the Brighton Line.

In July 2019, the MTA introduced a proposal to end late evening service. Instead, B service would end around 9:30 PM, which it previously did prior to July 2008. In their proposal, the MTA noted that service often ended early on weeknights to accommodate planned work.

From March 2020 to June 8, 2020, the B was temporarily suspended due to lack of ridership and train crew availability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. From December 30, 2021, to January 19, 2022, B service was again suspended due to a shortage of crew members exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

On July 1, 2024, midday service was increased to run every eight minutes instead of every ten minutes and alternate B trains were extended to Bedford Park Boulevard. From August 5, 2024, until February 24, 2025, B trains operated local between Prospect Park and Kings Highway in both directions for facilitating accessibility upgrades at the Church Avenue station.

<text>Interstate 664 (I-664) is an auxiliary Interstate Highway in the US state of Virginia. The Interstate runs from I-64 and I-264 in Chesapeake north to I-64 in Hampton. I-664 forms the west side of the Hampton Roads Beltway, a circumferential highway serving the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. The Interstate crosses Hampton Roads via the Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel (MMMBT) between Suffolk and Newport News. I-664 is connected to the other major cities of the metropolitan area—Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Virginia Beach—by I-264. The Interstate also has a connection to Portsmouth through State Route 164 (SR 164) and to Suffolk via U.S. Route 13 (US 13), US 58, and US 460.

==Route description==

I-664 begins at a full Y interchange with I-64 and I-264 that serves as the terminus of all three Interstates in the Bower&#x27;s Hill section of the city of Chesapeake. I-64 heads southeast as a continuation of the Hampton Roads Beltway through Chesapeake while I-264 heads east toward Portsmouth and Norfolk. I-664 heads west as an eight-lane freeway that has a southbound-only exit ramp to US 13 and US 460 (Military Highway) and crosses over Military Highway and a Norfolk Southern Railway rail line. The Interstate has a cloverleaf interchange with Military Highway, which here carries US 58 in addition to US 13 and US 460. The interchange also provides access to U.S. Route 460 Alternate (US 460 Alt.), which follows US 58 east into Portsmouth. I-664 curves north as a four-lane freeway that crosses Goose Creek and has a diamond interchange with SR 663 (Dock Landing Road) and a cloverleaf interchange with SR 337 (Portsmouth Boulevard).

Just south of its partial cloverleaf interchange with SR 659 (Pughsville Road), I-664 crosses a rail line; a spur from that rail line heads north in the median of the freeway as the highway enters the city of Suffolk. The rail spur leaves the median and heads northeast toward Portsmouth just south of its interchange with SR 164 (Western Freeway) and US 17 (Bridge Road). SR 164 heads east toward downtown Portsmouth while US 17 heads northwest to the James River Bridge. There is no access from southbound I-664 to southbound US 17; that movement is made via the next interchange, a cloverleaf interchange with SR 135 (College Drive) that serves the satellite campus of Old Dominion University and the community of Churchland.

North of SR 135, northbound I-664 has a vehicle inspection station and crossovers before the highway enters the MMMBT. The bridge–tunnel passes to the west of Craney Island, an artificial island in the city of Portsmouth that lies to the west of the mouth of the Elizabeth River. West of the highway is the confluence of the James River and Nansemond River to form Hampton Roads, as well as the James River Bridge a short distance to the north on the namesake river. I-664 heads north-northeast along a causeway for to a point west of the Newport News Middle Ground Light, where the pair of bridges curve to the north-northwest onto an artificial island where the highway descends into a pair of tunnels under the estuary&#x27;s main shipping channel. The Interstate resurfaces on another artificial island at Newport News Point east of the coal piers in the city of Newport News.

I-664 has a southbound vehicle inspection station adjacent to its first interchange in Newport News with Terminal Avenue. The Interstate parallels the southern end of CSX&#x27;s Peninsula Subdivision as it passes through interchanges with several streets to the east of downtown Newport News. The southern interchange has ramps to and from 25th, 26th, and 27th streets; the first two streets carry eastbound and westbound US 60, which is unmarked from I-664. The northern interchange has ramps to and from 35th Street and Jefferson Avenue; Jefferson Avenue is SR 143, which is also unmarked from the Interstate. I-664 curves east as a six-lane freeway away from the railroad and has an oblique crossing of SR 351 (39th Street) prior to half diamond interchanges with Roanoke Avenue and Chestnut Avenue. The Interstate enters the city of Hampton and has diamond interchanges with Aberdeen Road and Powhatan Parkway before reaching its northern terminus at I-64. I-664 meets its parent highway at a directional Y interchange above Newmarket Creek just south of Hampton Coliseum. The Hampton Roads Beltway continues east along I-64 through Hampton before crossing Hampton Roads on the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel (HRBT) into the city of Norfolk.

==History==

I-664 was completed in sections, beginning in 1971 with the construction of the &quot;Tunnel Road&quot; section, which led from Aberdeen Road to I-64. The road was built to lead northbound traffic from I-64 and the HRBT to downtown Newport News.

The interchange at I-64 was rebuilt as a partial stack interchange in 1980.

I-664 was completed in sections by 1989, between Aberdeen Road and the 26th/27th street exit ramps in downtown Newport News.

I-664 was completed in Suffolk and Chesapeake in 1990 between US 17 and Pughsville Road.

With the opening of the MMMBT on April 30, 1992, I-664 was almost complete. 

I-664 between Pughsville Road and the Bower&#x27;s Hill interchange was completed in 1993, thus completing I-664 as a whole.

==Exit list==
The exit numbering sequence on I-664 breaks two conventions for Interstate highways. First, I-664 uses a sequential numbering pattern while most Interstates utilize a mileage-based pattern. Second, exit 1 is at I-664&#x27;s northern end, in contrast with the convention of beginning exits for north–south highways at the highway&#x27;s southern end.

<doc id="1151836" wikidata="Q1353526" url="?curid=1151836" title="John Lowe (darts player)">
<text>John Lowe (born 21 July 1945) is an English former professional darts player. Along with Eric Bristow and Jocky Wilson, he was known for dominating darts during the 1980s. Lowe was world champion on three occasions, in 1979, 1987 and 1993. He was also a two-time winner of the Winmau World Masters and a two-time World Cup singles champion. In total, Lowe won 15 BDO and WDF majors. He held the World No. 1 ranking on four occasions. In October 1984, he became the first player to hit a televised nine-dart finish.

Lowe is one of only six players to have won the World Championship three or more times, and was the first person to win it in three separate decades; along with Phil Taylor, he remains one of only two players to achieve this. Amidst growing dissatisfaction with the British Darts Organisation, Lowe was also one of 16 players who in 1993 broke away to form their own governing body, the World Darts Council (now known as the Professional Darts Corporation).

==Career==
Lowe won the World Championship title in three different decades – 1979, 1987 and 1993. He met Eric Bristow six times in the World Championship in various semi-finals and finals, and it was not until his fourth attempt (in the 1987 final) that he managed to overcome his rival. His record against Bristow in majors was three wins and six defeats.

Lowe achieved the first-ever televised nine-dart finish on 13 October 1984, during the World Matchplay tournament against Keith Deller, although it was not live and instead shown on a highlights programme on ITV. It was achieved via a rare third-visit combination of treble 17, treble 18 and double 18. For the nine-dart finish, Lowe received £102,000, he went on to win the tournament, for which he received £12,000, and earned an additional £1,000 for the tournament&#x27;s highest outshot (161). This remained the highest amount of money earned by a darts player at a single tournament for almost two decades.

In addition to his three world titles, Lowe has also won two World Masters titles, two British Open titles, two British Matchplay championships, two World Cup Singles, and three European Cup Singles Titles, as well as other titles around the world in his career. He played for England over 100 times and was WDF England Captain between 1986 and 1993, during which time England remained unbeaten.
A composed performer, his demeanor was captured in his nickname &quot;Old Stoneface&quot;, which was also the title of Lowe&#x27;s autobiography published in 2005.

Lowe enjoyed an impressive longevity at the sport. He played in the televised stages of the World Championship for a then-record 28 consecutive years, from the inaugural championship in 1978 to his last appearance in 2005, where he was defeated by the Canadian John Verwey in a final-leg tiebreak.

Lowe played at the Alexandra Palace in 1980 in front of 7,000 people in the News of the World Championship.

Lowe also dominated the British Pentathlon event, winning it ten times, including six in a row from 1982 to 1987. He stopped entering the event because the prizemoney had not changed in 12 years and cost players £100 to enter, plus expenses.

Lowe was secretary of the World Professional Dart Players Association (later to become the Professional Dart Players Association (PDPA)), and, in 2005, he enjoyed a testimonial year in the sport to commemorate his 30th year as a professional. He attempted to qualify for the World Championship each year until 2008, but he fell short in the early qualifying rounds. After this, he joined a short-lived venture, the Setanta Sports–televised BetFred League of Legends in 2008.

===Post-darts career===
In May 2009, Lowe released a book, &quot;The Art of Darts&quot;, in which he offered his personal insights into the game to both amateur and aspiring professional dart players. In 2013, &quot;The Art of Darts&quot; was produced in app-form for the iPhone and iPad.

In 2014, Lowe was one of several celebrities to take part in ITV&#x27;s new game show &quot;Amazing Greys&quot;, in which members of the public take on icons of British sport and entertainment.

==Personal life==
Lowe was born in New Tupton, Derbyshire. He is married to Karen and lives in Chesterfield. They both support Sunderland football club.

<doc id="1151868" wikidata="Q44169" url="?curid=1151868" title="Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket">
<text>The Mk 4 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket (FFAR), also known as &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot;, is an unguided rocket used by United States military aircraft. It was 2.75 inches (70 mm) in diameter. Designed as an air-to-air weapon for interceptor aircraft to shoot down enemy bombers, it primarily saw service as an air-to-surface weapon. The FFAR has been developed into the modern Hydra 70 series, which is still in service.

==History==
The advent of jet engines for fighters and bombers posed new problems for interceptors. With closing speeds of 1,500 ft/s (457 m/s) or more for head-on interceptions, the time available for a fighter pilot to successfully target an enemy aircraft and inflict sufficient damage to bring it down was increasingly small. Wartime experience had shown that .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns were not powerful enough to reliably down a bomber, certainly not in a single volley, and heavy autocannons did not have the range or rate of fire to ensure a hit. Unguided rockets had been proven effective in ground-attack work during the war, and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had shown that volleys of their &quot;Werfer-Granate 21&quot; rockets, first used by elements of the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; JG 1 and JG 11 fighter wings on July 29, 1943, against USAAF bombers attacking Kiel and Warnemünde, could be a potent air-to-air weapon. The summer and autumn of 1944 saw the adoption of the folding-fin R4M unguided rocket for use underneath the wings of the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter for bomber destroyer duties against the USAAF&#x27;s Eighth Air Force heavy bombers.

The FFAR was developed in the late 1940s by the US Navy&#x27;s Naval Ordnance Test Center and North American Aviation. Mass production was established at the facilities of the Norris-Thermador Corp., Los Angeles, and the Hunter Douglas Division of the Bridgeport Brass Co., Riverside, California Fuzes were manufactured by the Bulova Watch Co., Jackson Heights, Queens, N.Y., with rocket propellant supplied by Hercules Inc., Wilmington, Delaware, metal parts supplied by Aerojet General, Downey, California, and miscellaneous spare parts were made by North American Aviation.

The original Mk 4 FFAR was about 4 ft (1.2 m) long and weighed 18.5 lb (8.4 kg), with a high-explosive warhead of about 6 lb (2.7 kg). Like the &quot;Luftwaffe&#x27;s&quot; R4M projectile of World War II, it had folding fins that flipped out on launch to spin-stabilize the rocket, with the FFAR using half the number (four) of fins in comparison to the R4M&#x27;s set of eight. Its maximum effective range was about 3,700 yards (3,400 m). Because of its low intrinsic accuracy, it was generally fired in large volleys, with some aircraft carrying as many as 104 rockets.

FFARs were the primary armament of many NATO interceptor aircraft in the early 1950s, including the F-86D, F-89, F-94C, and the CF-100. They were also carried by the F-102 Delta Dagger to supplement its guided missile armament.

The Mk 4 was dubbed &quot;Mighty Mouse&quot; in service, after the popular cartoon character.

The Mighty Mouse was to prove a poor aerial weapon. Although it was powerful enough to destroy a bomber with a single hit, its accuracy was abysmal. The rockets dispersed widely on launch: a volley of 24 rockets would cover an area the size of a football field. A particularly clear demonstration of this poor accuracy occurred on August 16, 1956, when a pair of U.S. Air Force F-89s were unable to shoot down a runaway U.S. Navy drone aircraft despite expending 208 rockets in the attempt.

As a result, by the late 1950s it had been largely abandoned as an aircraft weapon in favor of the guided air-to-air missiles then becoming available. The Mk 4 found other uses, however, as an air-to-ground weapon, particularly for the new breed of armed helicopter. A volley of FFARs was as devastating as a heavy cannon with far less weight and recoil, and in the ground-attack role its marginal long-range accuracy was less important. It was fitted with a more powerful motor to become the &quot;Mk 40&quot;. The Mk 40 was a universal motor developed from the Mk 4 2.75 FFAR, and could be fitted with different warheads depending on the mission. Pods (typically carrying seven or 19 rockets) were created for various applications, and a wide variety of specialized warheads were developed for antipersonnel, antitank, and target-marking use.

==US Mk 40 FFAR launchers== 
The United States was the primary user of this type of weapon and developed a number of different launching pods for it. LAU-3 pods were constructed of aluminum-reinforced cardboard and were intended to be disposed of either on the ground after a mission or by dropping them in-flight. With the advent of the armed helicopter, and the increased usage during the Vietnam War, the need for launching pods that were reusable became apparent, so that later models were of all-metal construction. Though the rocket was initially developed by the US Navy, the US Air Force and later US Army were most responsible for the development of rocket pods for all services. These pods are described as follows:

*Launchers designated under the US Army system:


Early UH-1B/UH-1C gunships had the XM-3 subsystem using paired 24 round rectangular launchers mounted near the back edge of the sliding side doors. These pods were ground reloadable and were semi-permanent aircraft parts. The mounting point had been used to mount booms for three SS-11 launchers on each side for anti-tank missions. The co-pilot had a roof mounted sight and control box to fire these. Later UH-1C and D aircraft had a mount on each side to carry a seven-round pod coupled with paired M-60D machine guns. Some carried M-134 miniguns with 3,000 rounds per gun instead, though these aircraft were normally used by air cavalry units, not the aerial rocket artillery (ARA) units.

Also various ground launchers using discarded aircraft pods were used for fire base defence. A towed configuration consisting of six 19-round pods called a Slammer was tested for airborne infantry support. The range was approximately 7,000 meters using Hydra 70 family rockets.

==Warheads for the Mk 40 motor==
With the development of the Mk 40 Mod 0 universal motor came the development of a considerable number of different warheads, as well as a number of different fuzing options. A list of those warheads believed to be developed before the replacement of the Mk 40 motor with the Mk 66 motor is as follows:

<doc id="1151871" wikidata="Q463236" url="?curid=1151871" title="Nine-dart finish">
<text>A nine-dart finish, also known as a nine-darter, is a perfect leg or single game in the sport of darts. The object of the game is to score a set number of points, most commonly 501; in order to win, a player must reach the target total exactly and hit a double scoring area with their last dart. 

When the target is 501, the minimum number of darts needed to reach it is nine. For example, one way to achieve a nine-dart finish is to score 60 (treble 20) on each of the first seven throws, then a 57 (treble 19) on the eighth, and lastly a 24 (double 12) on the ninth. It is regarded as an extremely difficult feat to achieve—even for the sport&#x27;s top players—and is considered the highest single-game achievement in the sport, similar to a maximum 147 break in snooker or a 300-point game in bowling.

The feat was first achieved on television by John Lowe in 1984, and it has since been accomplished in televised matches a total of 96 times. Paul Lim was the first to hit a nine-darter in the World Championship, making history during the 1990 BDO World Darts Championship in a second-round victory over Jack McKenna. Phil Taylor has achieved the most on television, with 11, his first coming in 2002 and his last in 2015. Taylor is the only player to achieve two nine-darters in the same match, doing so in the final of the 2010 Premier League against James Wade. The following year, Brendan Dolan became the first to accomplish a nine-darter by starting and finishing with a double, as per the format of the World Grand Prix event of that year.

Adrian Lewis was the first player to hit a nine-darter in a World Championship final, doing so during the 2011 PDC World Darts Championship final against Gary Anderson. Twelve years later, Michael Smith repeated the feat in the 2023 PDC World Darts Championship final against Michael van Gerwen. In 2013, Terry Jenkins and Kyle Anderson were the first players to hit a nine-darter on the same day, doing so on the second day of the 2014 PDC World Darts Championship. Wade and Robert Thornton were the first players to both achieve a perfect leg in the same match, doing so during the 2014 World Grand Prix. In 2023, Fallon Sherrock became the first woman to achieve the feat on television. At the 2024 Bahrain Darts Masters, Luke Littler became the youngest player to hit a televised nine-darter, accomplishing the feat two days before his 17th birthday.

==Methods of achievement==


A single game of darts (known as a leg) requires a player to score exactly 501 points, ending with either the bullseye or a double. Each shot consists of exactly three darts, and 60 is the maximum that can be scored with any one dart. Thus 180 is the maximum score from a shot, and nine throws are the minimum necessary to win.

Although many other combinations are possible, the traditional nine-dart finish requires a score of 60 (treble 20) with each of the first six throws: that is, with the first two shots of three. That leaves 141 to score on the final shot (of three darts), known as the outshot.

This outshot of 141 is traditionally performed in one of three ways:

* treble 20 (60), treble 19 (57) and double 12 (24)
* treble 20 (60), treble 15 (45) and double 18 (36)
* treble 17 (51), treble 18 (54) and double 18 (36)

Another way is to score 167 with each set of three darts, scoring 501 in total, in the following way:

* treble 20 (60), treble 19 (57) and bullseye (50)

By throwing each dart of a shot to a different place on the board, this eliminates the chance of any dart being deflected by an already thrown dart into the wrong scoring area but it is usually seen only in exhibition matches, as in tournaments, players are inclined to aim for the treble 20, only switching to the treble 19 for a cover shot.

Arguably the most difficult nine-dart finish would be 180 (3×T20), 171 (3×T19), and 150 (3×bullseye) – owing to the difficulty of getting all three darts in the bullseye: it is the smallest double on the board.

A nine-dart finish is also attainable in games which require a double to start scoring (a &quot;double-in&quot;; such games are thus termed &quot;double-in double-out&quot; with the existing double-out requirement). In such games, throwing for double 20 first can lead to a maximum score of 160 with the first shot, leaving the thrower commonly requiring 180 then 161 (T20, T17, bullseye) with their remaining six darts, though other outshots are possible. It is worth noting that in these games, only throwing for double 20, double 17, or bullseye to start the leg can result in a nine-dart finish, and if the bullseye is not the &quot;double-in&quot;, it must be the &quot;double-out&quot; (it can be both, although this would require a highly unorthodox finish using two bullseyes, such as T17-Bull-Bull for a 151).

The total number of different ways of achieving 501 with nine darts is 3,944, of which 2,296 finish with the bullseye, 672 end on D20, 792 on D18, 56 end on D17, 120 end on D15, and 8 end on D12. 574 of the possible ways can be used in a &quot;double-in double-out&quot; game.

==Nine-dart finishes in televised matches==

As of 28 December 2024, 96 nine-darters have been thrown in televised matches by 47 different players. 74 of those 96 hit two 180s and finished with a 141 check-out. English players have achieved a total of 46 nine-darters, 16 have been achieved by Dutch players, eight by Welsh players, six by Scottish players, four by Australians, three by Belgian and Irish players, two by Northern Irish, Portuguese and American players and one nine-darter has been achieved by players from Canada, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. 

The first televised nine-dart finish was achieved at the MFI World Matchplay on 13 October 1984 by John Lowe, who checked out 141 with T17, T18, D18 after scoring two maximum 180s. For this he received a prize of £102,000, going on to win the whole event. This nine-dart finish was not broadcast live, nor was Paul Lim&#x27;s at the 1990 BDO World Darts Championship. The first ever live broadcast nine-dart finish was performed by Shaun Greatbatch against Steve Coote in the final of the Dutch Open on 3 February 2002, while Phil Taylor achieved the first live nine-darter broadcast on British television during the 2002 World Matchplay.

Taylor has achieved the feat more than any other darts player on television, having done so 11 times. His first came on 1 August 2002 during a quarter-final tie against Chris Mason at the 2002 World Matchplay in Blackpool, for which Taylor received £100,000. Despite having achieved the feat a record 11 times, Taylor never hit a nine-darter in the World Championship, missing a chance on the outside wire of double 12 in his last match in the 2018 Final.

The youngest player to throw a televised nine-darter is Luke Littler, who hit the perfect leg in the quarter-finals of the 2024 Bahrain Darts Masters. The match was broadcast live on ITV4 in the UK. Littler was old at the time.

The 2007 International Darts League became the first televised tournament to witness two nine-darters when Phil Taylor&#x27;s nine-dart finish against Raymond van Barneveld was matched the following day by another one from Tony O&#x27;Shea against Adrian Lewis. In the second round of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton, James Wade hit his first televised nine-dart-finish against Gary Anderson. The event was shown live on ITV4, making it the first time a nine-darter had been seen live on free-to-air television in the United Kingdom. Mervyn King hit his first televised nine-dart finish in the 2009 South African Masters in September 2009 against Wade, becoming the first player do so outside of Europe.

On 24 May 2010, in the Premier League final against Wade, Taylor made history by being the first player to ever hit two nine-dart finishes in a single match. These were his seventh and eighth nine-dart finishes. On 10 February 2017, Michael van Gerwen became the second player to hit two nine-dart finishes in a match, in a 2017 UK Open qualification event against Ryan Murray.

Brendan Dolan was the first player ever to hit a nine-darter in a &quot;double-in double-out&quot; game, doing so in the semi-final of the 2011 World Grand Prix against James Wade on 8 October. He opened with double 20, before hitting successive treble 20s (160, 180) and then finished on 161 with T20, T17 and a bullseye. He later changed his nickname to &quot;The History Maker&quot; to reflect his feat. In October 2014 at the World Grand Prix, Wade and his opponent Robert Thornton became the first players to both hit a nine-darter in the same match. Wade is the only player to have hit a &#x27;standard&#x27; nine-darter and a &quot;double-in double-out&quot; nine-darter in televised matches.

William Borland hit a nine-darter at the 2022 PDC World Darts Championship in his first-round matchup in the last leg of the match to become the first person to win a match on TV in the PDC by hitting a nine-darter. On 17 February 2022, Gerwyn Price achieved two nine-dart finishes on the same day, doing so in two separate matches during night 3 of the 2022 Premier League Darts during a win against Michael van Gerwen in the semi-final, and then against James Wade in the final. In total, Price achieved four nine-dart finishes in 2022; no player had previously managed more than two.

===World Championship nine-darters===
The first player to manage the outshot in the World Championship was Paul Lim on 9 January 1990 against Jack McKenna. Lim won a £52,000 bonus for the feat, more than the £24,000 Phil Taylor received for winning the event. In the 2018 PDC World Darts Championship, Lim missed double 12 in his second round match against Gary Anderson, which would have made him the first player to do a nine-dart finish in both versions of the World Darts Championship. 

Even with two versions of the World Championship in operation, Lim&#x27;s achievement was not repeated for nearly 19 years until 2 January 2009, when Raymond van Barneveld became the second person to achieve the feat and the first since the split in darts. The finish came against Jelle Klaasen in the quarter-final of the 2009 World Championship at Alexandra Palace, and he claimed a £20,000 bonus prize. On 28 December 2009 he repeated the feat at the 2010 World Championship during his second round clash with Brendan Dolan.

Adrian Lewis achieved a nine-dart finish in the third leg of the 2011 World Championship final against Gary Anderson. On 23 December 2012 at the 2013 World Championship, Dean Winstanley hit a nine-dart finish in the third leg of the third set in his second round defeat to Vincent van der Voort. Another nine-dart finish at this Championship was achieved by Michael van Gerwen in his semi-final victory over James Wade in the third leg of the fifth set. The leg after the nine-darter (the fourth leg of the fifth set) van Gerwen hit another eight perfect darts but missed the last dart at the double to achieve consecutive nine-dart finishes.

On 14 December 2013 at the 2014 World Championship, Terry Jenkins and Kyle Anderson both hit nine-darters in their first round losses against Per Laursen and Ian White, respectively. On 30 December 2014 in the third round of the 2015 World Championship, Adrian Lewis hit his second World Championship nine-dart finish and his third overall, though he lost the match 3–4 to Van Barneveld. On 2 January 2016 in the semi-finals of the 2016 World Championship, Gary Anderson hit a nine-dart finish to defeat Klaasen 6–0 to reach his third World Championship final.

On 17 December 2021, during the first round of the 2022 World Championship, William Borland hit a nine-dart finish to defeat Bradley Brooks 3–2 in a last leg decider to reach the second round, becoming the first player in PDC history to win a televised match with a nine-dart finish. He described it as &quot;the best night of my life&quot;. The following day, Darius Labanauskas achieved the feat during a 3–1 loss to Mike De Decker. In the quarter-final, defending champion Gerwyn Price hit the third of the tournament in a loss to Michael Smith.

On 3 January 2023, in the 2023 PDC World Darts Championship Final, Michael Smith and Michael van Gerwen both had three darts left to achieve a nine-dart finish in the same leg, later dubbed &quot;the greatest leg in the history of darts&quot;. After van Gerwen missed on his ninth dart, Smith checked out 141, becoming the first player to register a nine-dart finish in the same leg that an opponent had missed-out by one dart.
He thus became the second player to hit a &#x27;nine-darter&#x27; in the final of the event. After Smith successfully completed his finish, popular commentator Wayne Mardle famously said &#x27;I can&#x27;t speak! I can&#x27;t speak&#x27;.

On 18 December 2024, during the first round of the 2025 PDC World Darts Championship, Christian Kist hit a nine-dart finish to win the opening set of his match with Madars Razma, the first nine-darter at the World Championship since Michael Smith&#x27;s famous leg. Kist went on to lose 3–1 to Razma. Kist earned a £60,000 bonus from tournament sponsor Paddy Power for achieving the feat. Damon Heta achieved the second nine-dart finish of the tournament in his third round loss to Luke Woodhouse.

==List of televised nine-dart finishes==

==Statistics==
===Multiple nine-darters in televised matches===
The following table lists the number of perfect legs recorded by players who have scored multiple nine-darters in televised matches.

&quot;As of 1 February 2025&quot;
===Nine-darter in televised matches by tournament===
==Nine-dart-finish prize money==
In 1984, John Lowe pocketed £102,000 for the first TV perfect leg. With nine-dart finishes now thrown on a regular basis the reward for throwing one has decreased. Until 2013 the PDC had a rolling £400 prize-pool for a nine-dart leg. As long as it wasn&#x27;t won, it increased by £400 for the next event. In 2013 the bonus stopped being awarded. For all PDC Premier events, the PDC formerly had a rolling £5,000 prize-pool for a nine-dart leg. As long as it isn&#x27;t won, the prize for hitting a nine-dart leg is increased by £5,000. If multiple players hit a nine-dart finish in one premier event, the money is split evenly across all players who achieved a nine-dart finish in that event. So the prize for a nine-darter varies for every PDC premier event. In the 2015 tournament, achieving the perfect leg in the PDC World Championships would win £10,000, (in the 2014 tournament the prize was £30,000). The reward for a nine-darter during the most recent BDO World Darts Championship was £52,000.

In 2019, a special prize of £100,000 was available to any player who hit two nine-dart finishes at the PDC World Championship, a feat which has as of December 2024 never been achieved at any World Championship. From 2019 to 2024 prize money for nine-dart finishes were withdrawn, owing to the ever increasing prize fund for tournaments.

Prior to the 2025 PDC World Darts Championship, title sponsors Paddy Power announced that they would be giving out a total of £180,000 for every nine-dart finish hit in the tournament, with the player, a spectator in the crowd and Prostate Cancer UK receiving £60,000 each.

== Women&#x27;s nine-darters ==
Mandy Solomons was the first woman to ever record a nine-dart finish in competition. It came in a match against Robert Hughes during the qualifying rounds for the 1996 BDO World Championship on 30 November 1995 at Earls Court, London. It was the first time female players were allowed to enter the qualifying rounds for the BDO World Championship. Hughes did end up winning the match 2–0, however. Solomons was also one of the first women to record a nine-dart finish in a regional Super League match.

Claire Stainsby and Glen Durrant made history when they recorded the first ever nine-dart finish in mixed pairs competition at the 2013 BDO International Open in Brean, Somerset. Durrant opened up with a 177, and then Stainsby followed that up with a 180 to leave Durrant on 144, which he ended up taking out for the first nine-dart finish in mixed pairs competition. As a result, Claire Stainsby was inducted into the BDO 9 Dart Club, thus becoming the first and so far only female to be inducted.

Ten-time World Champion Trina Gulliver revealed she has twice missed her last dart to record a nine-dart finish. One was a double 18 for $100,000 at an event in Canada and another missed double was for a car at an event in Ireland.

15-year-old Beau Greaves hit a nine-darter in a competition at Balby Bridge on 17 April 2019.

In 2023, during her 5–3 victory over Marco Verhofstad, Fallon Sherrock became the first woman to hit a nine-darter at a PDC event.

On 25 August 2023, Sherrock made history once again, as she became the first woman ever, to hit a televised 9 darter, during the Modus Super Series: Online Darts Live League.

<text>B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology is a private deemed university located in Tamil Nadu, India. Founded in 1984, Crescent was one of the first self-financing engineering institutions in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu. After being affiliated to University of Madras and Anna University for 25 years, Crescent was Deemed to be University by Indian Government and was known as B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent University. Since 2017, Crescent is known as B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology.

Crescent is organized into twelve constituent schools, which together comprise a total of eighteen departments. While Crescent is governed by the Institute&#x27;s Board of Management, the Institute&#x27;s Academic Council is the principal academic body that supervises Crescent&#x27;s academic policy. Additionally, each department constitutes a Board of Studies composed of experts from academia and industry, deliberates and finalizes the curriculum for the respective programmes.

==History==
B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology was founded by philanthropist and entrepreneur B.S. Abdur Rahman in 1984 as B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Engineering College, one of the first self-financing engineering institutions in the Indian State of Tamil Nadu. The Tamil Nadu State Government granted permission to establish Crescent as a private engineering college affiliated with the University of Madras in September 1984. Subsequently, the All India Council for Technical Education granted approval for Crescent College in December 1990.

In December 2001, the Tamil Nadu State Government decided to bring all the engineering colleges in the State of Tamil Nadu under Anna University to standardize the curriculum. Consequently, affiliation of Crescent College was changed from the University of Madras to Anna University. This affiliation status continued until 2008, when Crescent was deemed to be University.

On 16 December 2008, the Indian Government, on the advice of the University Grant Commission, granted the status of Institution Deemed to be University to the Crescent.

<text>Profit margin is a financial ratio that measures the percentage of profit earned by a company in relation to its revenue. Expressed as a percentage, it indicates how much profit the company makes for every dollar of revenue generated. Profit margin is important because this percentage provides a comprehensive picture of the operating efficiency of a business or an industry. All margin changes provide useful indicators for assessing growth potential, investment viability and the financial stability of a company relative to its competitors. Maintaining a healthy profit margin will help to ensure the financial success of a business, which will improve its ability to obtain loans.

It is calculated by finding the profit as a percentage of the revenue.

formula_1For example, if a company reports that it achieved a 35% profit margin during the last quarter, it means that it netted $0.35 from each dollar of sales generated.

Profit margins are generally distinct from rate of return. Profit margins can include risk premiums.

== Overview ==
Profit margin is calculated with selling price (or revenue) taken as base times 100. It is the percentage of selling price that is turned into profit, whereas &quot;profit percentage&quot; or &quot;markup&quot; is the percentage of cost price that one gets as profit on top of cost price. While selling something one should know what percentage of profit one will get on a particular investment, so companies calculate profit percentage to find the ratio of profit to cost.

The profit margin is used mostly for internal comparison. It is difficult to accurately compare the net profit ratio for different entities. Individual businesses&#x27; operating and financing arrangements vary so much that different entities are bound to have different levels of expenditure, so that comparison of one with another can have little meaning. A low profit margin indicates a low margin of safety: higher risk that a decline in sales will erase profits and result in a net loss, or a negative margin.

Profit margin is an indicator of a company&#x27;s pricing strategies and how well it controls costs. Differences in competitive strategy and product mix cause the profit margin to vary among different companies.
* If an investor makes revenue and it cost them to earn it, when they take their cost away they are left with 90% margin. They made 900% profit on their investment.
* If an investor makes revenue and it cost them to earn it, when they take their cost away they are left with 50% margin. They made 100% profit on their investment.
* If an investor makes revenue and it cost them to earn it, when they take their cost away they are left with 10% margin. They made 11.11% profit on their investment.

== Profit percentage ==
On the other hand, profit percentage is calculated with cost taken as base:
formula_2

Suppose that something is bought for $40 and sold for $100.
:
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5
:formula_6 (profit divided by cost).

If the revenue is the same as the cost, profit percentage is 0%. The result above or below 100% can be calculated as the percentage of return on investment. In this example, the return on investment is a multiple of 1.5 of the investment, corresponding to a 150% gain.

== Type of profit margin ==
There are three types of profit margins: gross profit margin, operating profit margin and net profit margin.

=== Gross profit margin ===
Gross profit margin is calculated as gross profit divided by net sales (percentage). Gross profit is calculated by deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS)—that is, all the direct costs—from the revenue. This margin compares revenue to variable cost.
Service companies, such as law firms, can use the cost of revenue (the total cost to achieve a sale) instead of the cost of goods sold (COGS). It is calculated as:formula_7
formula_8
formula_9

Example. If a company takes in a revenue of $1,000,000 and $600,000 in COGS. Gross profit is $400,000, and gross profit margin is (400,000 /. 1,000,000) x 100 = 40%.

=== Operating profit margin ===
Operating profit margin includes the cost of goods sold and is the earning before interest and taxes (EBIT) known as operating income divided by revenue. The COGS formula is the same across most industries, but what is included in each of the elements can vary for each. It should be calculated as: formula_10

Example. If a company has $1,000,000 in revenue, $600,000 in COGS, and $200,000 in operating expenses. Operating profit is $200,000, and operating profit margin is (200,000 / 1,000,000) x 100 = 20%.

=== Net profit margin ===
Net profit margin is net profit divided by revenue. Net profit is calculated as revenue minus all expenses from total sales. formula_11

Example. A company has $1,000,000 in revenue, $600,000 in COGS, $200,000 in operating expenses, and $50,000 in taxes. Net profit is $150,000, and net profit margin is (150,000 / 1,000,000) x 100 = 15%.

== Importance of profit margin ==
Profit margin in an economy reflects the profitability of any business and enables relative comparisons between small and large businesses. It is a standard measure to evaluate the potential and capacity of a business in generating profits. These margins help business determine their pricing strategies for goods and services. The pricing is influenced by the cost of their products and the expected profit margin. pricing errors which create cash flow challenges can be detected using profit margin concept and prevent potential challenges and losses in an entity. 

Profit margin is also used by businesses and companies to study the seasonal patterns and changes in the performance and further detect operational challenges. For example, a negative or zero profit margin indicates that the sales of a business does not suffice or it is failing to manage its expenses. This encourages business owners to identify the areas which inhibit growth such as inventory accumulation, under-utilized resources or high cost of production.

Profit margins are important whilst seeking credit and is often used as collateral. They are important to investors who base their predictions on many factors, one of which is the profit margin. It is used to compare between companies and influences the decision of investment in a particular venture. To attract investors, a high profit margin is preferred while comparing with similar businesses.

==Uses of profit margin in business==

Profit margins can be used to assess a company&#x27;s financial performance over time. By comparing profit margins over time, investors and analysts can assess whether a company&#x27;s profitability is improving or deteriorating. This information can be used to make informed investment decisions.

Profit margins are a useful tool for comparing the profitability of different companies in the same industry. By comparing the profitability of similar companies, investors can determine which companies are more profitable and therefore potentially more attractive investment opportunities. Low profit margins can act as a warning to a company&#x27;s owners and directors that the company might be in distress or the goods are being sold too cheap: &quot;whatever the reason, low margins could signal trouble in the long run&quot;.

Profit margins can also be used to assess a company&#x27;s pricing strategy. By analysing the profitability of different products and services, companies can determine which products or services are most profitable and adjust their pricing accordingly. This can help companies maximise profitability and remain competitive in the marketplace.

Margins can also be used to identify areas of a company&#x27;s operations that may be inefficient or not cost effective. By analysing the profitability of different product lines, companies can identify areas where costs are too high in relation to the profits generated. This information can then be used to optimise operations and reduce costs.

In some cases, companies may agree to cover profit margin shortfalls as part of a business-to-business supply contract, such as an agreement between a retailer and a supplier. However, in the UK, a Groceries Code Adjudicator report published in 2015 found that requirements to cover margin shortfalls imposed on suppliers by supermarket chains, where they had not been contractual agreed, were seen as a &quot;relatively common&quot; problem among suppliers.

<text>State Road 548 (SR 548), also known as the Lakeland In-Town Bypass, is a short six-lane arterial in Lakeland, Florida, United States, opened in early 2004. It connects George Jenkins Boulevard (west of downtown) to U.S. Highway 98 (US 98) and SR 600 (Bartow Road and Main Street) east of downtown, allowing traffic to bypass downtown.

==History==

SR 548 began construction in 2002 and opened in 2004. In 2005 it was stalled by budget cuts only for construction to resume in 2006, with a scaled back design that excluded the originally proposed bridge over SR 539 (Kathleen Road) east of the bridge over Lakeland Junction.

===Second phase===
SR 548 was extended west across SR 563 (Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue) and SR 539 (Kathleen Road) terminating at George Jenkins Boulevard west of downtown. This provides a full east–west bypass to supplement US 92 (Memorial Boulevard) and SR 400 (Interstate 4).

<text>The Indian cuckoo or short-winged cuckoo (Cuculus micropterus) is a member of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes, that is found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It ranges from India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and north to China and Russia. It is a solitary and shy bird, found in forests and open woodland at up to .

==Description==
This is a medium-sized cuckoo with both sexes alike. It has grey upperparts while the underside has broad black barring. The tail is barred with a broad subterminal dark band and a white tip. Young birds have white markings on the crown and white chin and throat contrasting with a dark face. Juveniles are browner and have broad white tips to the head and wing feathers. The eye-ring is gray to yellow (a feature shared with the common hawk-cuckoo). The iris is light brown to reddish. The female differs from the male in being slightly paler grey on the throat and in having more brown on the breast and tail. The barring on the belly is narrower than in the male. Nestlings have an orange-red mouth and yellow flanges to the gape.
The call is loud with four notes. They have been transcribed as &quot;orange-pekoe&quot;, &quot;bo-ko-ta-ko&quot;, &quot;crossword puzzle&quot; or &quot;one more bottle&quot;. In northern India, they can be locally common during the breeding season with densities estimated at a calling bird for every .

They feed on hairy caterpillars and other insects but sometimes take fruits. They usually feed on the upper canopy, gleaning insects, sometimes making aerial sallies for flying termites or rarely even by hovering lower near the ground.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Two subspecies are generally recognized. The nominate form is found in much of continental Asia, while &quot;concretus&quot; S. Müller, 1845 which is smaller and darker is known from the Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and Borneo. The birds in the Amur region are larger and Swinhoe described a form from northern China as &quot;Cuculus michieanus&quot; while Walter Norman Koelz described a form &quot;fatidicus&quot; from northeastern India.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is found widely distributed across Asia, from the Indian subcontinent eastwards to Southeast Asia. The preferred habitat is deciduous and evergreen forests but also occur in garden lands and thick scrub.

Some populations in India migrate south in winter, although there are breeding populations in the southern areas as well, with specimens netted at night or recorded at lighthouses. The population in the Amurland of the Russia is migratory.
==Behaviour and ecology==
The Indian cuckoo is a brood parasite. In Russia, females were found to pair with specific males during the breeding season. The male diverts the attention of hosts from their nest giving time for the female to lay her egg. It lays its single egg mostly in the nests of drongos and crows. Brown shrikes have been recorded as hosts in Russia. The female removes and eats an egg from the host nest before laying her own. The breeding season varies from May to July in northern China, March to August in India, January to June in Burma and January to August in the Malay Peninsula.

The host species include &quot;Lanius cristatus&quot; in the Amur region, black drongo and &quot;Pica cyanea&quot; in China. In India, they have been found to be fed by black drongos and ashy drongo. Other hosts that have been recorded include black-headed oriole, streaked spiderhunter, &quot;Eurylaimus ochromalus&quot; and &quot;Dicrurus paradiseus&quot;.

The eggs of the cuckoo hatch in 12 days while those of the brown shrike in the Amur region take 15 days. During the third or fourth day, the young bird bends its back when touched and heaves out other eggs or nestlings. This instinct is lost soon after.

== In culture ==
The loud calls have led to numerous cultural interpretations. In Bengali, it is interpreted as &quot;বউ কথা কও (bou-kotha-kao)&quot;, &quot;Bride, please speak&quot;. In Uttarakhand and Nepal, it is rendered as &quot;kafal pako&quot;, or &quot;the kafal fruit (&quot;Myrica esculenta&quot;) is ripe&quot;, as is the case in May–June when calling increases. It is known as &quot;Vishupakshi&quot; in Malayalam and its call is interpreted as &quot;Kallan chakkayittu&quot;, meaning &quot;thief stole jackfruit&quot;. Very little variation is noted between regions. In the Kangra Valley of India, the call is interpreted as the soul of the dead shepherd uttering &quot;where is my sheep&quot;. In China, the call is variously interpreted as &quot;why not go home&quot; (不如歸去), &quot;single lonely&quot; (光棍好苦), &quot;single happy&quot; (光棍好過), &quot;mother-in-law beats me&quot; (家婆打我), &quot;catfish congee&quot; (滑哥煲粥), &quot;myna of pea&quot; (豌豆八哥), &quot;pea and maize corn&quot; (豌豆包谷), &quot;go to cut wheat&quot; (快快割麥), &quot;Grandpa, Grandma, cut wheat, transplant rice&quot; (阿公阿婆，割麦插禾). The Soliga people use the interpretation &quot;ke:ta satto, makka ketto &quot; which translate to &quot;Ketha (a person&#x27;s name) died, his sons cried&quot;. In Vietnamese, the call is interpreted as &quot;bắt cô trói cột&quot; (literally meaning: &quot;take a woman and tie her to a post&quot;) stemming from a legend possibly originating from the Mảng ethnic group.

<text>Durga Puja (ISO: , ), also known as Durgotsava or Shaaradotsava, is an annual festival originating in the Indian subcontinent which reveres and pays homage to the Hindu goddess Durga, and is also celebrated because of Durga&#x27;s victory over Mahishasura. It is the biggest festival of Bengali Hindus and the Indian state of West Bengal. A 2019 study by the British Council estimated the economic value of creative industries associated with Durga Puja in West Bengal at ₹32,377 crores (2.6% of the state&#x27;s GDP in that financial year). West Bengal&#x27;s capital city Kolkata&#x27;s Durga Puja has been inscribed on the intangible cultural heritage list of UNESCO in December 2021. 

In addition to West Bengal, Hindu Bengalis are native to Bangladesh and Indian state of Tripura, Assam (Barak Valley), Jharkhand and Bihar (Kosi-Seemanchal); Therefore, Durga Puja is performed with great devotion in these places as well.

The festival is observed in the Indian calendar in the month of Ashvin, which corresponds to September–October in the Gregorian calendar. Durga Puja is a ten-day festival, of which the last five are of the most significance. Even though Durga Puja and Navaratri are observed simultaneously dedicated to the Hindu goddess Durga, but they are not the same festival. 

The puja is performed in homes and public, the latter featuring a temporary stage and structural decorations (known as &quot;pandals&quot;). The festival is also marked by scripture recitations, performance arts, revelry, gift-giving, family visits, feasting, and public processions called a melā. Durga Puja is an important festival in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism. Durga Puja which is celebrated as Gosani Yatra in Puri. In this festival of Puri, several big clay idols of Mahisamardini Durga are worshipped every year in the month of Asvina (October).

As per Hindu scriptures, the festival marks the victory of goddess Durga in her battle against the shape-shifting Demon, Mahishasura. Thus, the festival epitomizes the victory of good over evil, though it is also in part a harvest festival celebrating the goddess as the motherly power behind all of life and creation. Durga Puja coincides with Navaratri and Dussehra celebrations observed by other traditions of Hinduism.

The primary goddess revered during Durga Puja is Durga, but celebrations also include other major deities of Hinduism such as Lakshmi (the goddess of wealth and prosperity), Saraswati (the goddess of knowledge and music), Ganesha (the god of good beginnings), and Kartikeya (the god of war). In Bengali traditions, these deities are considered to be Durga&#x27;s children, and Durga Puja is believed to commemorate Durga&#x27;s visit to her natal home with her beloved children. The festival is preceded by Mahalaya, which is believed to mark the start of Durga&#x27;s journey to her natal home. Primary celebrations begin on the sixth day (Shasthi), on which the goddess is welcomed with rituals. The festival ends on the tenth day (Vijaya Dashami), when devotees embark on a procession carrying the worshipped clay sculpture-idols to a river, or other water bodies, and immerse them, symbolic of her return to the divine cosmos and her marital home with Shiva in Kailash. Regional and community variations in celebration of the festival and rituals observed exist.

Durga Puja is an old tradition of Hinduism, though its exact origins are unclear. Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest that royalty and wealthy families were sponsoring major Durga Puja festivities since at least the 16th-century. The prominence of Durga Puja increased during the British Raj in the provinces of Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh and Assam. However, in modern times, the importance of Durga Puja is more as a social and cultural festival than a religious one, wherever it is observed. 

Over the years, Durga Puja has morphed into an inseparable part of Indian culture with a diverse group of people celebrating this festival in their unique way while on tradition.

==Names==
In West Bengal, Odisha, Assam, Jharkhand and Tripura, Durga Puja is also called &quot;Akalbodhan&quot; (literally, &quot;untimely awakening of Durga&quot;), &quot;Sharadiya pujo or puja&quot; (&quot;autumnal worship&quot;), &quot;Sharodotsab&quot; (&quot;festival of autumn&quot;), &quot;Maha pujo&quot; (&quot;grand puja&quot;), &quot;Maayer pujo&quot; (&quot;worship of the Mother&quot;), &quot;Durga pujo&quot;, or merely &quot;Puja(In Odisha, Bihar)&quot; or &quot;Pujo&quot;. In Bangladesh, Durga Puja has historically been celebrated as &quot;Bhagabati puja&quot;. Maa Durga is known as the Goddess of Power (feminine) which represents triumph of Goodness over evil.

Durga Puja is also referred to by the names of related Shakta Hindu festivals such as Navaratri, celebrated on the same days elsewhere in India; such as in Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Kerala, and Maharashtra, Kullu Dussehra, celebrated in Kullu Valley, Himachal Pradesh; Mysore Dussehra celebrated in Mysore, Karnataka; Bommai Golu, celebrated in Tamil Nadu; Bommala Koluvu, celebrated in Andhra Pradesh; and Bathukamma, celebrated in Telangana.

==History and origins==
Durga is an ancient goddess of Hinduism according to available archeological and textual evidence. However, the origins of Durga Puja are unclear and undocumented.

The name Durga, and related terms, appear in Vedic literature, such as in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; hymns 4.28, 5.34, 8.27, 8.47, 8.93 and 10.127, and in sections 10.1 and 12.4 of the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; A deity named &quot;Durgi&quot; appears in section 10.1.7 of the &quot;Taittiriya Aranyaka&quot;. While the Vedic literature uses the word &quot;Durga&quot;, the description therein lacks legendary details about her or about Durga Puja that is found in later Hindu literature.

A key text associated with Durga Puja is &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;, which is recited during the festival. Durga was likely well established by the time this Hindu text was composed, the date of which scholars estimate as between 400 and 600 CE. The &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot; scripture describes the nature of evil forces symbolised by Mahishasura as shape-shifting, deceptive, and adapting in nature, in form and in strategy to create difficulties and thus achieve their evil ends. Durga calmly understands and counters the evil in order to achieve her solemn goals.Durga, in her various forms, appears as an independent deity in the Indian texts.

In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, both Yudhisthira and Arjuna invoke hymns to &quot;Durga&quot;. She appears in &quot;Harivamsa&quot; in the form of Vishnu&#x27;s eulogy and in Pradyumna&#x27;s prayer. The prominent mention of Durga in such epics may have led to her worship.

Some versions of the &quot;Puranas&quot; mention Durga Puja to be a spring festival, while the &quot;Devi-Bhagavata Purana&quot; and two other Shakta &quot;Puranas&quot; mentions it to be an autumn festival. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; manuscripts are also inconsistent. Versions of &quot;Ramayana&quot; found in the north, west, and south of the Indian subcontinent describe Rama to be remembering Surya (the Hindu sun god) before his battle against Ravana, but the Bengali manuscripts of &quot;Ramayana&quot;, such as the &quot;Krittivasi Ramayana,&quot; a 15th-century manuscript by Krttivasa, mention Rama to be worshipping Durga. As per the legend, Rama worshipped Durga in the autumn to have her blessings before defeating Ravana. While he was preparing for the worship of the goddess, Durga hid one of the 108 flowers of lotus, very essential for her worship. Having found only 107 of 108 lotuses at the time of the worship, Rama decided to offer one of his eyes in place of that lotus. When he was about to offer his eye, Durga appeared and told him that she had only hidden the flower in order to test his devotion and she was satisfied with it. She blessed Rama and he continued with her worship. Since the gods are believed to be sleeping during autumn, the awakening rite of the Durga puja is also known as &quot;akāla bodhana&quot;.

Surviving manuscripts from the 14th-century provide guidelines for Durga Puja, while historical records suggest the royalty and wealthy families to be sponsoring major Durga Puja public festivities, since at least the 16th-century. The 11th or 12th-century Jain text &quot;Yasatilaka&quot; by Somadeva mentions an annual festival dedicated to a warrior goddess, celebrated by the king and his armed forces, and the description mirrors attributes of Durga Puja.

According to some scholars, the worship of the fierce warrior goddess Durga, and her darker and more violent manifestation Kali, became popular in the Bengal region during and after the medieval era, marked by Muslim invasions and conquests.

The significance of Durga and other goddesses in Hindu culture is stated to have increased after Islamic armies conquered regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to yet other scholars, the marginalization of Bengali Hindus during the medieval era led to a reassertion of Hindu identity and an emphasis on Durga Puja as a social festival, publicly celebrating the warrior goddess.From the medieval era up to present-day, Durga Puja has been celebrated as a socio-cultural event, while maintaining the roots of religious worship.

==Rituals and practices==
=== Texts ===
The puja rituals involve &quot;mantras&quot; (words manifesting spiritual transformation), &quot;shlokas&quot; (holy verses), chants and &quot;arati&quot;, and offerings. The worship begins with a reading of the Sanskrit &quot;Devī Mahātmya&quot; from the sixth-century Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The &quot;shlokas&quot; and &quot;mantras&quot; praise the divinity of the goddess; according to the &quot;shlokas&quot;, Durga is omnipresent as the embodiment of power, nourishment, memory, forbearance, faith, forgiveness, intellect, wealth, emotions, desires, beauty, satisfaction, righteousness, fulfillment and peace.

=== Relation to harvest ===
Durga Puja is, in part, a post-monsoon harvest festival observed on the same days in the Shaktism tradition of Hinduism as those in its other traditions. The practice of including a bundle of nine different plants, called &quot;navapatrika&quot;, as a symbolism of Durga, is a testament practice to its agricultural importance. The typically selected plants include not only representative important crops, but also non-crops. This probably signifies the Hindu belief that the goddess is &quot;not merely the power inherent in the growth of crops but the power inherent in all vegetation&quot;.

The festival is a social and public event in the eastern and northeastern states of India, where it dominates religious and socio-cultural life, with temporary &quot;pandal&quot;s built at community squares, roadside shrines, and temples. The festival is also observed by some Shakta Hindus as a private home-based festival.

Before Durga puja there is &quot;Paata Puja,&quot; the ritual of making an idol on the day of the Rath Yatra, usually around July. &#x27;Paata&#x27; is the wooden frame that forms the base for the idols.

=== Day One ===
Durga Puja is a ten-day event. The festival begins with Mahalaya, a day on which Hindus perform &quot;tarpaṇa&quot; by offering water and food to their dead ancestors. The day also marks the arrival of Durga from her marital home in Kailash.

The festival starts at twilight with prayers to Saraswati. She is believed to be another aspect of goddess Durga. This is also the day when the eyes are painted of the deities on the representative clay sculpture-idols, bringing them to a lifelike appearance. The day also marks prayers to Ganesha and visit to &quot;pandal&quot;s and temples.

=== Day Two to Five ===
Day two to five mark the remembrance of the goddess and her manifestations, such as &quot;Kumari&quot; (goddess of fertility), &quot;Mai&quot; (mother), &quot;Ajima&quot; (grandmother), &quot;Lakshmi&quot; (goddess of wealth) and in some regions as the &quot;Saptamatrikas&quot; (seven mothers) or &quot;Navadurga&quot; (nine aspects of Durga). On the sixth day major festivities and social celebrations start. The first nine days overlap with Navaratri festivities in other traditions of Hinduism.The specific practices vary by region.

=== Day Six to Nine ===
The next significant day of the festival is the sixth day (&quot;Shashthi&quot;), on which devotees welcomes the goddess and festive celebrations are inaugurated. Rituals typically performed on the sixth day include:

&quot;Bodhana&quot;: Involves rites to awaken and welcome the goddess to be a guest. The amorphous sight of the goddess is consecrated into a &quot;ghata&quot; or noggin while the visible sight is consecrated into the &quot;murti&quot; or idol. These rituals are known as &quot;ghatasthapana&quot; and &quot;pranapratistha&quot; respectively.

&quot;Adhivasa&quot;: Anointing ritual wherein symbolic offerings are made to Durga, with each item representing a remembrance of subtle forms of her.

On the seventh day (&quot;Saptami&quot;), eighth (&quot;Ashtami&quot;) and ninth (&quot;Navami&quot;) days, the goddess along with Lakshmi, Saraswati, Ganesha, and Kartikeya are revered and these days mark the main days of worship with recitation of scriptures, puja, legends of Durga in &quot;Devi Mahatmya&quot;, social visits to elaborately decorated and illuminated &quot;pandals&quot; (temporary structures meant for hosting the puja), among others.
* &quot;Navapatrika snan&quot;: Bathing of the &quot;navapatrika&quot; with holy water done on the seventh day of the festival.
* &quot;Sandhi puja&quot; and &quot;Ashtami pushpanjali&quot;: The eighth day begins with elaborate &quot;pushpanjali&quot; rituals. The cusp of the ending of the eighth day and beginning of the ninth day is considered to be the moment when per scriptures Durga engaged in a fierce battle against Mahishasura and was attacked by the demons Chanda and Munda. Goddess Chamunda emerged from the third eye of Durga and killed Chanda and Munda at the cusp of &quot;Ashtami&quot; and &quot;Navami&quot;, the eighth and ninth days respectively. This moment is marked by the &quot;sandhi puja&quot;, involving the offering of 108 lotuses and lighting of 108 lamps. It is a forty-eight minutes long ritual commemorating the climax of battle. The rituals are performed in the last 24 minutes of &quot;Ashtami&quot; and the first 24 minutes of &quot;Navami&quot;. In some regions, devotees sacrifice an animal such as a buffalo or goat, but in many regions, there is not an actual animal sacrifice and a symbolic sacrifice substitutes it. The surrogate effigy is smeared in red vermilion to symbolize the blood spilled. The goddess is then offered food (&quot;bhog&quot;). Some places also engage in devotional service.

* and : The ninth day of festival is marked with the (fire oblation) rituals and . Some places also perform on this day.

=== Day Ten ===
* and immersion: The tenth and last day, called Vijaya Dashami is marked by , where women smear or vermillion on the sculpture-idols and also smear each other with it. This ritual signifies the wishing of a blissful marital life for married women. Historically the ritual has been restricted to married women. The tenth day is the day when Durga emerged victorious against Mahishasura and it ends with a procession where the clay sculpture-idols are ceremoniously taken to a river or coast for immersion rites. Following the immersion, Durga is believed to return to her mythological marital home of Kailasa to Shiva and the cosmos in general. People distribute sweets and gifts, visit their friends and family members on the tenth day. Some communities such as those near Varanasi mark the day after Vijaya Dashami, called Ekadashi, by visiting a Durga temple.

* and : Dhunuchi naach involves a dance ritual performed with (incense burner). Drummers called , carrying large leather-strung , &quot;Dhols&quot; and other traditional drums depending on the region, to create music, to which people dance either during or not during . Some places, especially home pujas, also observe dhuno pora, a ritual involving married women carrying burning with incense and dried coconuts, on a cloth on their head and hands,

===Decorations, sculptures, and stages===

The process of the creation of clay sculpture-idols (&quot;pratima&quot; or &quot;murti&quot;) for the puja, from the collection of clay to the ornamentation is a ceremonial process. Though the festival is observed post-monsoon harvest, the artisans begin making the sculpture-idols months before, during summer. The process begins with prayers to Ganesha and to the perceived divinity in materials such as bamboo frames in which the sculpture-idols are cast.

Clay, or alluvial soil, collected from different regions form the base. This choice is a tradition wherein Durga, perceived as the creative energy and material, is believed to be present everywhere and in everything in the universe. In certain traditions in Kolkata, a custom is to include soil samples in the clay mixture for Durga from areas believed to be &quot;nishiddho pallis&quot; (forbidden territories; territories inhabited by the &quot;social outcasts&quot; such as brothels).

The clay base is combined with straw, kneaded, and then molded into a cast made from hay and bamboo. This is layered to a fine final shape, cleaned, painted, and polished. A layer of a fiber called jute, mixed in with clay, is also attached to the top to prevent the statue from cracking in the months ahead. The heads of the statues are more complex and are usually made separately. The limbs of the statues are mostly shaped from bundles of straws. Then, starting about August, the local artisans hand-paint the sculpture-idols which are later dressed in clothing, are decorated and bejewelled, and displayed at the puja altars.

The procedure for and proportions of the sculpture-idols are described in arts-related Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, such as the &quot;Vishvakarma Sashtra&quot;.

====Environmental impact====

The sculpture-idols for the puja are traditionally made of biodegradable materials such as straw, clay, soil, and wood. In today&#x27;s times, brighter colored statues have increased in popularity and have diversified the use of non-biodegradable, cheaper or more colorful substitute synthetic raw materials. Environmental activists have raised concerns about the paint used to produce the statue, stating that the heavy metals in these paints pollute rivers when the statues are immersed at the end of the Durga festival.

Brighter colors that are also biodegradable and eco-friendly, as well as the traditional natural colors, are typically more expensive compared to the non biodegradable paints. The Indian state of West Bengal has banned the use of hazardous paints, and various state government have started distributing lead-free paints to artisans at no cost to prevent pollution.

===Animal sacrifice, symbolic sacrifice===
Shakta Hindu communities mark the slaying of Mahishasura and the victory of Durga with a symbolic or actual sacrifice. Most communities prefer symbolic sacrifice, where a statue of the &quot;asura&quot; is made of flour or equivalent, is immolated and smeared with vermilion, symbolic of the blood that had spilled during the battle. Other substitutes include a vegetable or a sweet dish considered equivalent to the animal. In certain instances, devotees consider animal sacrifice distasteful, and practice alternate means of expressing devotion while respecting the views of others in their tradition.

In communities performing actual sacrifice, an animal is sacrificed, mainly at temples. In Nepal, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam, animal sacrifices are performed at Shakta temples to commemorate the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura. This involves slaying of a fowl, pig, goat, or male water-buffalo. Large scale animal sacrifices are rare among Hindus outside the regions of Bengal, Odisha, Assam, and Nepal. In these regions, festivals are primarily when significant animal sacrifices are observed.

The Rajputs of Rajasthan worship their weapons and horses in the related festival of Navaratri, and some historically observed the sacrifice of a goat, a practice that continues in some places. The sacrifice ritual, supervised he the priest, requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage into manhood and readiness as a warrior. The &quot;Kuldevi&quot; (clan deity) among these Rajput communities is a warrior goddess, with local legends tracing reverence for her during Rajput-Muslim wars.

===Pandals and theme-based pujas===

Months before the start of Durga Puja, youth members of the community collect funds and donations, engage priests and artisans, buy votive materials and help build &quot;pandal&quot;s centered around a theme, which has rose to prominence in recent years. Such themes have included sex work, celebration of humanity, marginalization of queer persons and transgender persons, folk culture, celebration of cinema, womanhood, pro-environment themes, while others have chosen metaphorical themes such as celebration of &quot;maati&quot; (literally, soil or ash) and &quot;finding one&#x27;s own light&quot;. Pandals have also been replicated on existing temples, structures, and monuments and yet others have been made of elements such as metal scraps, nails, and turmeric among others. Durga Puja pandals have also been centered around themes to acknowledge political events such as the 2019 Balakot airstrike and to protest against the National Register of Citizens of India.

The budget required for such theme-based pujas is significantly higher than traditional pujas. For such theme-based pujas, the preparations and the building of &quot;pandals&quot; are a significant arts-related economic activity, often attracting major sponsors. Such commercialized pujas attract crowds of visitors. The growth of competitiveness in theme-based &quot;pandals&quot; has escalated costs and scale of Durga Puja in eastern states of India. Some segments of the society criticize the billboards, the economic competition, and seek return to basics. The competition takes many forms, such as the height of statue. In 2015, an 88-foot statue of Durga in Kolkata&#x27;s Deshapriya Park attracted numerous devotees, with some estimates placing visitors at one million.

==Regional celebrations and observances==
There exists variation in Durga Puja worship practices and rituals, as is the case with other Hindu festivals, in the Indian subcontinent. Hinduism accepts flexibility and leaves the set of practices to the choice of the individuals concerned. Different localized rituals may be observed regionally, with these variations accepted across temples, &quot;pandals&quot;, and within families.

The festival is most commonly associated with Bengali Hindus, and with the community having variability and differences in practices. There may exist differences of practice between the puja of theme-based &quot;Pandals&quot;, family pujas (with puja of erstwhile aristocrat families known as &quot;bonedi&quot; puja), and community pujas (known as &quot;barowari&quot; pujas) of neighbourhoods or apartments.

The rituals of the puja also varies from being Vedic, Puranic, or Tantric, or a combination of these. The Bengali Durga Puja rituals typically combine all three. The non-Bengali Durga Puja rituals tend to be essentially Vedic (&quot;srauta&quot;) in nature but they too incorporate esoteric elements making the puja an example of a culmination of Vedic-Tantric practices.

Historical evidence suggests that the Durga Puja has evolved over time, becoming more elaborate, social, and creative. The festival had earlier been a domestic puja, a form of practice that still remains popular. But it had also come to be celebrated in the &quot;sarvajanin&quot; (public) form, where communities get together, pool their resources and efforts to set up &quot;pandals&quot; and illuminations, and celebrate the event as a &quot;mega-show to share&quot;. The origins of this variation are unclear, with some sources suggesting a family in Kolkata reviving such celebration in 1411 CE. While other set of sources suggest that a Bengali landlord, named Kamsanarayan, held a mega-show puja in late 16th-century Bengal. Yet, this festival of Bengal is likely much older with the discovery of 11th and 12th-century Durga Puja manual manuscripts such as &quot;Durgotsavaviveka&quot;, &quot;Durgotsava Prayoga&quot;, &quot;Vasantaviveka&quot; and &quot;Kalaviveka&quot;. The rituals associated with the Durga Puja migrated to other regions from Bengal, such as in Varanasi, a city that has historically attracted sponsorship from Hindus from various parts of the Indian subcontinent including Bengal. In contemporary India, Durga Puja is celebrated in various styles and forms.

In Bishnupur, West Bengal, Durga Puja holds a unique and significant place. The district boasts the &quot;Rajbari Durga Puja&quot;, also known as the &quot;Mrinmoyee Maa er pujo&quot;, which dates back to 994 AD. This makes it the oldest Durga Puja in the entire Bengal region, encompassing present-day Bangladesh, Odisha, and Tripura.
Durga Puja is a widely celebrated festival in the Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh (eastern parts), Assam, and Odisha. It is celebrated over a five-day period. Streets are decked up with festive lights, loudspeakers play festive songs as well as recitation of hymns and chants by priests, and &quot;pandal&quot;s are erected by communities. The roads become overcrowded with revellers, devotees, and &quot;pandal&quot;-hoppers visiting the pandals on puja days. It often creates chaotic traffic conditions. Shops, eateries, and restaurants stay open all night; fairs are also set up and cultural programmes are held. People form organizing committees, which plan and oversee the &quot;pandal&quot; during the festivities. Today, Durga Puja has turned into a consumerist social carnival, a major public spectacle and a major arts event riding on the wave of commercialisation, corporate sponsorship, and craze for award-winning. For private domestic pujas, families dedicate an area of their homes, known as &quot;thakur dalan&quot;, for Durga Puja where the sculpture-idols for worship is placed and decorated with home-dyed fabric, &quot;sola&quot; ornamentations, and gold and silver foil decorations. Elaborate rituals like &quot;arati&quot; are performed and &quot;prasad&quot; is distributed after being offered to the deities. As a tradition, married daughters visit their parents and celebrate the Durga Puja with them, a symbolism alluding to Durga who is popularly believed to return to her natal home during the puja.
Durga Puja is also a gift-giving and shopping season for communities celebrating it, with people buying gifts for not only family members but also for close relatives and friends. New clothes are the traditional gift, and people wear them to go out together during Durga Puja. During puja holidays, people may also go to places of tourist attractions while others return home to spend Durga Puja with their family. It&#x27;s a common trend amongst youngsters and even those who are older to go &quot;pandal&quot;-hopping and enjoy the celebrations.

The organising committees of each puja &quot;pandal&quot; hires a &quot;purohita&quot; (priest) who performs the puja rituals on behalf of the community. For the priests, Durga Puja is a time of activity wherein he pursues the timely completion of Vedic-Puranic-Tantric ritual sequences to make various offerings and perform fire oblations, in full public view, while the socio-cultural festivities occur in parallel. The complex puja rituals include periods of accurate and melodic scripture recitation. The puja involves crowds of people visiting the &quot;pandals&quot;, with smaller groups visiting family pujas, to witness the celebrations. On the last day, the sculpture-idols are carried out in immersion processions across Bengal, following which they are ritually immersed into rivers or other waterbodies. The immersion ceremony continues till a couple of days after the last day of puja.
According to some scholars, the ritual of immersing the Durga sculpture-idol into the river attracted the attention of colonial era travelers to the Bengal region from Europe, such as Garcin de Tassy and Emma Roberts. In 1831, Tassy reported that similar rituals were annually observed by the Muslim community in Bengal. Shia Bengali Muslims observed Muharram over ten days, taking out processions in memory of the martyrdom of Imam Husayn ibn Ali, and then cast a memorial Imam&#x27;s cenotaph into a river on the tenth day. Tassy further stated that the Bengali rituals of Muharram included the same offerings at the annual observation of Muharram that the Hindu rituals included during Durga Puja. According to yet other scholars, the ritual of immersion in water by Hindus for Durga Puja in Bengal and Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states of India, may have grown because members of the Hindu community attempted to create a competing procession and immersion ritual to that of Muharram, allowed by the colonial British Indian government in the 19th and early 20th-centuries.
In Maharashtra, the city of Nashik and other places such as CIDCO, Rajeevnagar, Panchavati, and Mahatmanagar host Durga Puja celebrations. While in Delhi, the first community Durga Puja was organized near Kashmiri Gate by a group of expatriate Bengalis, in 1910, a year before Delhi was declared the capital of British India. This group came to be the Delhi Durga Puja Samiti, popularly known as the Kashmere Gate Durga Puja. The Durga Puja at Timarpur, Delhi was started in the year 1914. In 2011, over 800 Durga Pujas were held in Delhi, with a few hundred more in Gurgaon and NOIDA.

In Odisha, Durga Puja is the most important festival of the people of the state. Durga Puja is a very important festival for Odias, during the 4 days of the festival, the streets of the city turns into a wonderland throughout the state, people welcome the arrival of their maa by rejoicing themselves, eating tasty food, wearing new clothes, seeing different pandals across the city, family gathering and gift givings. In 2019, ninety-seven pandals in Cuttack alone, Odisha were reported to bedeck respective sculpture-idols with silver jewelry for Durga Puja celebrations; such club of pandals termed regionally as &quot;Chandi Medha&quot;. The state capital is famous for the modern themes and creativity In the pandals, while the Western part of the state has a more retro decoration theme to the pandal. In the northern parts of the state particularly Balasore, Durga Puja is celebrated with much fervor and the Odia diaspora abroad especially in Australia, which originates 95% from the district of Balasore celebrates the puja in the same manner which is done back home in Balasore. In September 2019, 160 &quot;pandals&quot; were reported to be hosting Durga Puja in Cuttack.

While in Tripura there were over 2,500 community Durga Puja celebrations in 2013. Durga Puja has been started at the Durgabari temple, in Agartala by King Radha Kishore Manikya Bahadur.

==Significance==
Beyond being an art festival and a socio-religious event, Durga Puja has also been a political event with regional and national political parties having sponsored Durga Puja celebrations. In 2019, West Bengal Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee announced a grant of 25,000 to all community-organised Durga Pujas in the state.

In 2019, Kolkata&#x27;s Durga Puja was nominated by the Indian government for the 2020 UNESCO Representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Durga Puja also stands to be politically and economically significant. The committees organising Durga Puja in Kolkata have close links to politicians. Politicians patronize the festival by making donations or helping raise money for funding of community pujas, or by marking their presence at puja events and inaugurations. The grant of 25,000 to puja organizing committees in West Bengal by a debt-ridden state government was reported to cost a budget a 70 crores. The state government also announced an additional grant of 5,000 to puja organizing committees fully managed by women alone, while also announcing a twenty-five percent concession on total electricity bills for puja &quot;pandal&quot;. The government had made a grant of 10,000 each to more than 20,000 puja organizing committees in the state in 2018.

A 2013 report by ASSOCHAM states West Bengal&#x27;s Durga Puja to be a 25,000 crores worth economy, expected to grow at the compound annual growth rate of about 35 per-cent. Economic slowdowns in India, such as in 2019, have hence affected corporate sponsorships and puja budgets for public celebrations. In August 2019, the Income Tax Department of India had allegedly sent notices to various Durga Puja organizing committees in West Bengal, against which the ruling party of the state, All India Trinamool Congress (AITMC) protested. The Central Board of Direct Taxes denied sending any such notices, to which AITMC politician Madan Mitra is reported to have said that the intention may have been to enquire if tax deducted at source had been deducted on payments to vendors for organizing community pujas.

===Economic significance===
Durga Puja directly affects the economy. In 2022, the economy of West Bengal was estimated to get a boost of 50,000 crore rupees. The annual GDP of West Bengal was expected to be expanded by 20-30 percent that year. The factors responsible for this economic boost are mainly the increase of earning in transport, tourism, industry, business, shopping and other fields. The Kolkata Metro Railway recorded an earning of ₹6 crore in just five days of Durga Puja in 2022.

The famous puja pandals get sponsorship from renowned companies and labels. Usually, the dress and jewelries of the idols, the material used to make the typically very elaborate pandals, decorations, lightings are sponsored.

===Social significance===
Durga Puja plays a great significance in the living of certain peoples. The &quot;kumor&quot;s, those who make the idols with clay and also makes other clayey products, earns lakhs of rupees by selling a single set of Durga idol of average size. Hence, it makes their annual income because idols used in other festivals are a lot more cheaper. Other professions that receive the majority of their annual income are &quot;dhaaki&quot; (plays &quot;dhaak&quot;), priest and other small homecrafts. It is assumed that these profession based small classes would become smaller in population if Durga Puja was absent.

===Media attention===

The day of Mahalaya is marked by the Indian Hindu community of West Bengal with &quot;Mahishasuramardini&quot; — a two-hours long All India Radio program — that has been popular in the Bengali community since the 1950s. While in earlier days it used to be recorded live, a pre-recorded version has come to be broadcast in recent decades. Bengalis traditionally wake up at four in the morning on Mahalaya to listen to the radio show, primarily involving recitations of chants and hymns from &quot;Devi Mahatmyam&quot; (or &quot;Chandi Path&quot;) by Birendra Krishna Bhadra and Pankaj Kumar Mullick. The show also features various devotional melodies.

Dramas enacting the legend of Durga slaying Mahishasura are telecasted on the television. Radio and television channels also air other festive shows, while Bengali and Odia magazines publish special editions for the puja known as &quot;Pujabarshiki&quot; (&quot;Annual Puja Edition&quot;) or &quot;Sharadiya Sankhya&quot; (&quot;Autumnal Volume&quot;). These contain works of writers, both established and upcoming, and are more voluminous than the regular issues. Some notable examples of such magazines in Bengali are &quot;Anandamela&quot;, &quot;Shuktara&quot;, &quot;Desh&quot;, &quot;Sananda&quot;, &quot;Nabakallol&quot;, and &quot;Bartaman&quot;.

<text>The Yokosuka P1Y &quot;Ginga&quot; (銀河, &quot;Galaxy&quot;) is a twin-engine, land-based bomber developed for the Japanese Imperial Navy in World War II. It was the successor to the Mitsubishi G4M and given the Allied reporting name Frances.

==Design and development==
The P1Y was designed by the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal to Navy specification 15-&quot;Shi&quot;, calling for a fast bomber with speed matching the Zero, range matching the G4M, a 907 kg (2,000 lb) bombload, and the ability to dive-bomb as well as carry torpedoes. As the result, the construction suffered from excess complexity, difficulty of manufacture, and poor serviceability. Problems with the availability of enough reliable Nakajima &quot;Homare&quot; engines led to their replacement by the Mitsubishi &quot;Kasei&quot; in the P1Y2-S night-fighter version.

The streamlined design of the &quot;Ginga&quot; is attributed to Miki Tadanao, an engineer who, after World War II, went on to create a similar aerodynamic design for Japan&#x27;s earliest bullet trains (Shinkansen) while working with the Japan National Railways (JNR).

==Operational history==
The first flight was in August 1943. Nakajima manufactured 1,002 examples, which were operated by five &quot;Kōkūtai&quot; (Air Groups), and acted as land-based medium and torpedo bombers from airfields in China, Taiwan, the Mariana Islands, the Philippines, the Ryukyu Islands, Shikoku, and Kyūshū. During the last stages of the War, the P1Y was used as a &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft against the United States Navy during the Okinawa Campaign in Operation Tan No. 2.

A night fighter version, the P1Y2-S &quot;Kyokko&quot; (極光, &quot;Aurora&quot;), with Mitsubishi &quot;Kasei&quot; engines was equipped with radar and a &quot;Schräge Musik&quot;-style upward-firing, as well as forward-firing, 20 mm cannon. A total of ninety-six were produced by Kawanishi, but, due to inadequate high-altitude performance against the B-29 Superfortress, many were converted back to &quot;Ginga&quot; bombers.

==Surviving aircraft==
A P1Y1 survives at the Smithsonian&#x27;s Paul Garber Facility of its National Air and Space Museum. While only the fuselage has been photographed several times and can be found on the internet, the wings and engines are confirmed to exist. This was one of three P1Ys that were brought back to the United States after World War II for evaluation.

<text>Bogurodzica (, calque of the Greek term &quot;Theotokos&quot;), in English known as the Mother of God, is a medieval Christian hymn composed sometime between the 10th and 13th centuries in Poland. It is believed to be the oldest religious hymn or patriotic anthem in the Polish language, which was traditionally sung in Old Polish with the Greek phrase &quot;Kyrie eleison&quot; – &quot;Lord, have mercy&quot;. While its origin is not entirely clear, several scholars agree that Saint Adalbert of Prague is the likely author. Polish knights chanted Bogurodzica prior to their engagement at the Battle of Grunwald and it also accompanied the coronation ceremonies of the first Jagiellonian kings.

== History ==

It was recorded in writing at the beginning of the 15th century. Two records preserved till today date back to that time: 
# the Kcynia record including two initial stanzas together with musical notation;
# the Kraków record covering thirteen stanzas without notes.
Other records date back to the second half of the fifteenth century, the turn of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and to the beginning of the 16th century. In 1509, the hymn was printed in Kraków and incorporated into the &quot;Statutes of Bishop Jan Łaski&quot;.

The origin of the song is not clear, although Saint Adalbert is widely believed to be its author or contributor. It heavily reflected Latin and Christian liturgy as a whole. The two initial stanzas were created first - possibly in the middle or at the end of the thirteenth century, or possibly at the very beginning of the fourteenth century.

Bogurodzica is a prayer hymn whose first stanza contains an invocation to Christ through the intercession of Mary. It begins with an apostrophe to her - to the Mother of Christ, the Virgin, praised by God, the chosen one. After the apostrophe, there is an appeal to Mary to win favour for people from her Son.

The second stanza begins with a direct addresses to Christ (called God&#x27;s Son) - with an invocation to John the Baptist who can support human imploring. The prayer closing this stanza contains a request that Christ give people a blissful stay on Earth and, after death, everlasting existence in heaven. The subsequent stanzas develop various motifs such as Easter, the Passion of Jesus and litany - with invocations to the saints.

Bogurodzica was initially associated with religious mass and procession, however, by the fifteenth century it became a war hymn and a battle cry. According to Jan Długosz, historian and author of &quot;Annales seu Cronicae incliti Regni Poloniae&quot;, Bogurodzica was sung at Grunwald in 1410 as well as before other notable battles in the subsequent years. It also accompanied the coronation of Władysław III of Poland. Długosz defined the tune as &quot;carmen patrium&quot; – &#x27;the hymn of the fatherland&#x27;. In spite of this, the hymn lost its significance over the upcoming centuries to new patriotic anthems, notably &quot;Rota&quot; and &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;.

From May 2024, the third oldest manuscript version of the song (1456) is presented at a permanent exhibition in the Palace of the Commonwealth in Warsaw.

== Lyrics ==

Old Polish 



English 
Virgin, Mother of God, God-famed Mary! 
Ask Thy Son, our Lord, God-named Mary, 
To have mercy upon us and hand it over to us! 
&quot;Kyrie eleison!&quot; 

Son of God, for Thy Baptist&#x27;s sake, 
Hear the voices, fulfill the pleas we make! 
Listen to the prayer we say, 
For what we ask, give us today: 
Life on earth free of vice; 
After life: paradise!

<doc id="1151939" wikidata="Q312100" url="?curid=1151939" title="Codex Alimentarius">
<text>The is a collection of internationally recognized standards, codes of practice, guidelines, and other recommendations published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Health Organization (WHO) of the United Nations relating to food, food production, food labeling, and food safety.

==History and governance==
Its name is derived from the Codex Alimentarius Austriacus. Its texts are developed and maintained by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), a body established in early November 1961 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Joined by the World Health Organization (WHO) in June 1962, the CAC held its first session in Rome in October 1963.

The Commission&#x27;s main goals are to protect the health of consumers, to facilitate international trade, and to ensure fair practices in the international food trade.

The CAC is an intergovernmental organization: the member states of the FAO and WHO send delegations to the CAC. As of 2021, there were 189 members of the CAC (188 member countries plus one member organization, the European Union) and 239 Codex observers (59 intergovernmental organizations, 164 non-governmental organizations, and 16 United Nations organizations).

The CAC develops food standards on scientific evidence furnished by the scientific committees of the FAO and WHO; the oldest of these, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA), was established in 1956 and predates the establishment of the CAC itself. According to a 2013 study, the CAC&#x27;s primary functions are &quot;establishing international food standards for approved food additives, providing maximum levels in foods; maximum limits for contaminants and toxins; maximum residue limits for pesticides and for veterinary drugs used in veterinary animals; and establishing hygiene and technological function practice codes&quot;.

The CAC does not have regulatory authority, and the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; is a reference guide, not an enforceable standard on its own. However, several nations adopt the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; in their own regulations, and the World Trade Organization (WTO), for purposes of food safety, refers to the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; Sanitary and Phytosanitary practice codes in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) for member countries. The &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot; is thus an international reference point for the resolution of international trade disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection. Many bilateral and multilateral trade agreements refer to the &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot;, adopting it as a point of reference.

==Scope==
The Codex Alimentarius covers all foods, whether processed, semi-processed or raw. In addition to standards for specific foods, the Codex Alimentarius contains general standards covering matters such as food labeling, food hygiene, food additives and pesticide residues, and procedures for assessing the safety of foods derived from modern biotechnology. It also contains guidelines for the management of official i.e. governmental import and export inspection and certification systems for foods.

The Codex Alimentarius is published in the six official languages of the United Nations: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish and Russian. Not all texts are available in all languages.

As of 2017, the CAC had a total of 78 guidelines, 221 commodity standards, 53 codes of practice, and 106 maximum levels for contaminants of food (of which 18 covered contaminants).

In a 2018 publication, the CAC stated that: &quot;Codex has at times been criticized as slow to complete its work, but developing food standards and compiling them as a code that is credible and authoritative requires extensive consultation. It also takes time for information to be collected and evaluated, for follow-up and verification and, at times, for consensus to be found
satisfying differing views. Overall, it takes an average of 4.2 years to develop a Codex standard – and significantly less for pesticide MRLs or food additive levels.&quot;

===General texts===
* Food labelling (general standard, guidelines on nutrition labelling, guidelines on labelling claims)
* Food additives (general standard including authorized uses, specifications for food grade chemicals)
* Contaminants in foods (general standard, tolerances for specific contaminants including radionuclides, aflatoxins and other mycotoxins)
* Pesticide and veterinary chemical residues in foods (maximum residue limits)
* Risk assessment procedures for determining the safety of foods derived from biotechnology (DNA-modified plants, DNA-modified micro-organisms, allergens)
* Food hygiene (general principles, codes of hygienic practice in specific industries or food handling establishments, guidelines for the use of the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point or “HACCP” system)
* Methods of analysis and sampling

===Specific standards===
* Meat products (fresh, frozen, processed meats and poultry)
* Fish and fishery products (marine, fresh water and aquaculture)
* Milk and milk products
* Foods for special dietary uses (including infant formula and baby foods)
* Fresh and processed vegetables, fruits, and fruit juices
* Cereals and derived products, dried legumes
* Fats, oils and derived products such as margarine
* Miscellaneous food products (chocolate, sugar, honey, mineral water)

==Classification of supplements and additives==
In 1996 the German delegation, sponsored by three German pharmaceutical firms, put forward a proposal that no herb, vitamin or mineral should be sold for preventive or therapeutic reasons, and that supplements should be reclassified as drugs. The proposal was agreed, but protests halted its implementation. The 28th Session of the Codex Alimentarius Commission was subsequently held July 4–9, 2005. Among the many issues discussed were the &quot;Guidelines for Vitamin and Mineral Food Supplements&quot;, which were adopted during the meeting as new global safety guidelines: The guidelines state that &quot;people should...be encouraged to select a balanced diet from food before considering any vitamin and mineral supplement. In cases where the intake from the diet is insufficient or where consumers consider their diet requires supplementation, vitamin and mineral food supplements serve to supplement the daily diet.&quot;

The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) has said that the Guidelines call &quot;for labelling that contains information on maximum consumption levels of vitamin and mineral food supplements&quot;. The WHO has also said that the Guidelines &quot;ensure that consumers receive beneficial health effects from vitamins and minerals&quot;.

In 2004, similarities were noted between the EU&#x27;s Food Supplements Directive and the Codex Alimentarius draft guidelines for vitamin and mineral supplements.

==Criticism==
The 2003 International Commission of the Future of Food and Agriculture, convened by Italian politician Claudio Martini and chaired by anti-globalization activist Vandana Shiva, issued several manifestos, including the Manifesto on the Future of Food, which contended that &quot;bureaucracies like the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Codex Alimentarius have codified policies designed to serve the interests of global agribusiness above all others, while actively undermining the rights of farmers and consumers&quot;.

==Conspiracy theories==
The Codex Alimentarius has been the subject of various conspiracy theories. These theorize that it is an agenda for population control, an anti-supplement Big Brother initiative, actually establishes eugenics, or a process for World Government establishment.

<doc id="1151956" wikidata="Q1270623" url="?curid=1151956" title="Meurthe (department)">
<text>Meurthe () is a former department of France created in 1790. Its prefecture (capital) was Nancy. It ceased to exist following the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany in 1871.

==General characteristics==
The department of Meurthe was created on 4 March 1790, during the French Revolution, out of a part of the former province of Lorraine. It took its name from the river Meurthe flowing through it.

As of 1866, Meurthe had 714 communes. Its area was . It was divided into 5 arrondissements: Nancy, Château-Salins, Lunéville, Sarrebourg and Toul.

==History==

After the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, the northeastern part of the Meurthe department was annexed to the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt. On 18 May 1871 about one-third of the Meurthe, corresponding approximately to the arrondissements of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg in the northeast of the department, were detached from Meurthe and annexed to the German Department of Lorraine, becoming part of the &quot;Reichsland&quot; of Alsace-Lorraine.

The remaining two thirds of Meurthe were merged with one fifth of the Moselle department (arrondissement of Briey, in the extreme west of Moselle, to the northwest of Meurthe) which had escaped German annexation, and on 7 September 1871 the merger gave birth to the new Meurthe-et-Moselle department (area: 5,246 km2, compared to 6,070 km2 for the former Meurthe), with its prefecture at Nancy.

In 1919, with the Allied victory in the First World War, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France by Germany at the Treaty of Versailles. However, the old departments of Meurthe and Moselle was not recreated by reverting to the old department borders of before 1871. Instead, Meurthe-et-Moselle was left untouched, and the one-third of Meurthe and the four-fifths of Moselle that had been formed the German region of Lorraine in 1871 were reinstituted as the new department of Moselle, which shares the name of the old department of Moselle but which has quite different borders.

==Population==
At the 1866 French census, the Meurthe department had a population of 428,387 inhabitants. In 1872, after the annexation and merger, the new Meurthe-et-Moselle department had a population of 365,137 inhabitants.

At the 1999 French census, if Meurthe still existed it would have had a population of 647,307 inhabitants. On the other hand, in 1999 Meurthe-et-Moselle had a population of 713,779 inhabitants (the industrial area of Briey and Longwy merged in 1871 is more populated than the rural areas of Château-Salins and Sarrebourg lost in 1871).

<doc id="1151958" wikidata="Q463268" url="?curid=1151958" title="Ted Haggard">
<text>Ted Arthur Haggard (; born June 27, 1956) is an American Methodist pastor. Haggard is the founder and former pastor of New Life Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and is a founder of the Association of Life-Giving Churches. He served as president of the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) from 2003 until November 2006.

Haggard made national headlines in November 2006 when a male prostitute and masseur, Mike Jones, alleged that Haggard, who had spoken against the legalization of same-sex marriage, had paid him for sex for three years and had bought and used crystal methamphetamine. Haggard resigned his post at New Life Church and his other leadership roles shortly after the allegations became public. Later, Haggard admitted to drug use, some sexual activity with Jones, and an inappropriate relationship with a young man who attended New Life Church.

In 2010, Haggard and his wife, Gayle, founded Saint James Church (Free Methodist Church) in Colorado Springs.

==Early life and education==
Haggard was born in Indiana. His father, J. M. Haggard, a practicing veterinarian in Yorktown, Indiana, founded an international charismatic ministry, which was featured in a PBS Middletown documentary series. Haggard has stated that he was molested when he was seven years old.

In 1972, at age 16, Haggard became a born-again Christian after hearing a sermon from evangelist Bill Bright in Dallas, Texas, and becoming acquainted with the Christian apologetics of C. S. Lewis. As a co-editor of his high-school newspaper in 1974, Haggard published frank articles that described services that were available to prevent and deal with increasingly prevalent pregnancies and STDs. These articles scandalized his small town and embroiled him in a free-press lawsuit.

Haggard describes feeling the call of God on his life after his first year in college while he was in the kitchen at home. He had been a telecommunications major with a minor in journalism, but after this experience he believed he had been called to be a pastor. Haggard subsequently attended Oral Roberts University, a Christian university in Tulsa, Oklahoma, graduating in 1978. He became a minister in the Southern Baptist Convention for a few months.

==New Life Church==
According to Haggard, in November 1984, when he was an associate pastor of Bethany World Prayer Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, his confidant and mentor Danny Ost, a missionary to Mexico City, had a vision of Haggard founding his church in Colorado Springs. Accordingly, Haggard moved to Colorado shortly afterwards, and founded New Life Church. Initially, the 22 people who met in the basement of Haggard&#x27;s house formed his church, which then grew to rented spaces in strip malls.

After 22 years, New Life Church operated from a campus in northern Colorado Springs and had a congregation of 14,000. In 1993, during what Haggard describes as his &quot;first prayer journey,&quot; he traveled with a group to Israel. They stood on the Mount of Olives, where Haggard claims that he felt the Holy Spirit speak to him. &quot;From that time until now,&quot; Haggard writes in &quot;The Life-Giving Church,&quot; &quot;apostolic power has blessed me. My only problems are with me – not with the enemy, not with circumstances, not with people.&quot;

Under Haggard&#x27;s leadership, New Life Church formed the Association of Life-Giving Churches. It has been listed as a denomination by the U.S. National Association of Evangelicals. As of 2006, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; reported that it comprised some 300 congregations.

===Sex and drug scandal===
In November 2006, a male prostitute and masseur, Mike Jones, publicly alleged that Haggard had paid him for sex over a three-year period and had bought and used crystal methamphetamine. Jones said he had only recently learned of Haggard&#x27;s true identity, and explained his reasons for coming forward by saying,
: &quot;It made me angry that here&#x27;s someone preaching against gay marriage and going behind the scenes having gay sex.&quot;
Jones made the allegations public in response to Haggard&#x27;s political support for Colorado Amendment 43, on the November 7, 2006, Colorado ballot, which would ban same-sex marriage in that state. Jones told ABC News,
: &quot;I had to expose the hypocrisy. He is in the position of influence of millions of followers, and he&#x27;s preaching against gay marriage. But behind everybody&#x27;s back [he&#x27;s] doing what he&#x27;s preached against.&quot;
Jones hoped that his statements would sway voters.

Haggard&#x27;s immediate response was denial. He told a Denver television station,
: &quot;I did not have a homosexual relationship with a man in Denver ... I am steady with my wife. I&#x27;m faithful to my wife.&quot;
Haggard also said,
: &quot;I have never done drugs – ever. Not even in high school. I didn&#x27;t smoke pot. I didn&#x27;t do anything like that. I&#x27;m not a drug man. We&#x27;re not a drinking family. I don&#x27;t smoke cigarettes. I don&#x27;t socially drink. We don&#x27;t socially drink. We don&#x27;t have wine in our house. We don&#x27;t do that kind of thing.&quot;
Many evangelical leaders initially showed support for Haggard and were critical of media reports, including James Dobson, who, in a statement of support for Haggard, said
: &quot;It is unconscionable that the legitimate news media would report a rumor like this based on nothing but one man&#x27;s accusation. ... Ted Haggard is a friend of mine, and it appears someone is trying to damage his reputation as a way of influencing the outcome of Tuesday&#x27;s election – especially the vote on Colorado&#x27;s marriage-protection amendment, which Ted strongly supports.&quot;

Cornered by his voicemail to Mike Jones requesting methamphetamine, Haggard told the press,
: &quot;I bought it [methamphetamine] for myself, but never used it. I was tempted but I never used it.&quot;
Haggard said that he had bought the methamphetamine but then thrown it away, and added that he had never met his accuser. Jones volunteered to take a polygraph test on a KHOW radio show hosted by Peter Boyles, where Jones first made the allegations. However, Jones&#x27;s responses during the section of the polygraph test about whether he had engaged in sex with Haggard indicated deception. The test administrator, John Kresnik, discounted the test results because of Jones&#x27;s stress, and lack of eating or sleeping. Regardless, Haggard responded by saying,
: &quot;We&#x27;re so grateful that he failed a polygraph test this morning, my accuser did.&quot;
Jones was not asked questions about drug use. Jones expressed doubt that he would retake the test, saying
: &quot;I&#x27;ve made my point. He&#x27;s the one who has discredited himself. He should admit it and move on.&quot;

Because of the scandal, Haggard went on administrative leave from New Life, saying,
: &quot;I am voluntarily stepping aside from leadership so that the overseer process can be allowed to proceed with integrity. I hope to be able to discuss this matter in more detail at a later date. In the interim, I will seek both spiritual advice and guidance.&quot;
On November 2, 2006, senior church officials told Colorado Springs television station KKTV that Haggard had admitted some of the claims made by Jones. In an e-mail to New Life Church parishioners sent on the evening of November 2, Acting Senior Pastor Ross Parsley wrote,
: &quot;It is important for you to know that he [Haggard] confessed to the overseers that some of the accusations against him are true.&quot; 
Haggard admitted that he had bought methamphetamine and received a massage from Jones, and denied using the drugs and having sex with Jones.

As it became apparent that at least some of the claims were true, some evangelical leaders, such as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, sought to distance themselves from Haggard, and to downplay his influence on religious conservatives, his connections to the Bush administration, and the importance of the NAE.

On November 4, 2006, the Overseer Board of New Life Church released a statement that Haggard had been fired as senior pastor:
: &quot;Our investigation and Pastor Haggard&#x27;s public statements have proven without a doubt that he has committed sexually immoral conduct.&quot;
Ross Parsley, the Associate Senior Pastor, was then named Haggard&#x27;s successor. Haggard then entered counseling conducted by a team, which included Jack Hayford and Tommy Barnett, who stated their intention to
: &quot;perform a thorough analysis of Haggard&#x27;s mental, spiritual, emotional, and physical life&quot;,
including the use of polygraph tests. The team was to include James Dobson, who later stepped aside, citing time constraints. H.B. London – Focus on the Family&#x27;s vice president of church and clergy – took Dobson&#x27;s place on the team. After the scandal was publicized, Haggard entered three weeks of intensive counseling, overseen by four ministers. In February 2007, one of those ministers, Tim Ralph, said that Haggard was &quot;completely heterosexual.&quot;

On November 3, 2006, Haggard&#x27;s resignation from his leadership role at the National Association of Evangelicals was accepted.

Eventually, Haggard admitted having used drugs and having been sexually fondled by Jones.

===Other allegations===
On January 23, 2009, less than one week before &quot;The Trials of Ted Haggard&quot; was released on HBO, officials from Haggard&#x27;s former church announced that a young male church member had come forward in 2006 and that there was an
: &quot;overwhelming pool of evidence [of an] inappropriate, consensual sexual relationship [that] went on for a long period of time [with Haggard] ... it wasn&#x27;t a one-time act.&quot;
Haggard&#x27;s successor, Brady Boyd, said the church reached a six-figure settlement with the man, who was in his early 20s at the time. According to the man, the contact was &quot;not consensual&quot;. Later reports were that the relationship did not involve physical contact, but that on one occasion Haggard masturbated in front of the young man. The man, Grant Haas, added that New Life Church paid him $179,000 for counseling and college tuition.

Haggard acknowledged an inappropriate relationship with Haas on CNN and in other media; when asked whether he had had other, unreported gay relationships, Haggard did not give a direct answer.

On July 26, 2022 Religion News Service published an article on new allegations against Haggard, stating
: &quot;The most recent allegations were made by Kirk &#x27;Seth&#x27; Sethman, who was ordained as a minister by St. James Church in 2012. Sethman recorded the statements of two young adult men who said Haggard touched them inappropriately on several occasions at the church. One of them was a minor at the time the touching began in 2019. Sethman said he first approached church elders with allegations about Haggard in 2020.&quot;

==Period between church leadership positions==
In April 2007, the Haggard family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to start a restoration process. They attended Phoenix First Assembly of God Church, whose pastor, Tommy Barnett, was on Haggard&#x27;s counseling team. Haggard reached an agreement with New Life Church on a severance package that would pay him through 2007; one of the conditions was that he had to leave the Colorado Springs area. His last reported income was $138,000, not including benefits. On February 6, 2008, the new pastor at New Life Church issued a press release announcing that Haggard had requested to leave the team created to &quot;restore&quot; him and that as Haggard&#x27;s restoration was &quot;incomplete,&quot; he was not welcome to return to vocational ministry at New Life.

In August 2007, Haggard released a statement asking for monetary donations to help support his family while he and his wife attended classes at the University of Phoenix. Questions surfaced about the tax-exempt group &quot;Families With a Mission&quot; to which Haggard had urged people to contribute. According to Haggard, the group would use 10% of donations for administrative costs and forward 90% to Haggard; however, the group was dissolved in February 2007, according to the Colorado Secretary of State. A few days after Haggard&#x27;s initial email statement, his restoration team stepped in to say his statement was &quot;inappropriate&quot; and that &quot;Haggard was a little ahead of himself.&quot; They indicated that Haggard would not be working at the Dream Center or in ministry of any kind and that they advised Haggard to seek secular employment to support himself and his family.

In June 2008, with the severance deal of the New Life Church at an end, Haggard was &quot;free to live where he wanted&quot; and returned to his Colorado Springs home. Also in June, an email surfaced in which Haggard admitted masturbating with Jones and taking drugs, as alleged in 2006. Kurt Serpe, who provided the email, said Haggard &quot;craved sex, he was a sexaholic.&quot; In November 2008, Haggard said in guest sermons at an Illinois church that his actions had roots in sexual abuse by an adult when he was seven years old. He also agreed to appear in Alexandra Pelosi&#x27;s HBO documentary about his sex scandal titled &quot;The Trials of Ted Haggard&quot;, that premiered on HBO in January 2009. According to the documentary, Haggard had begun a new career selling insurance.

In January 2009, after the release of &quot;The Trials of Ted Haggard,&quot; Haggard and wife Gayle appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and other national media programs to offer a public apology and confession for the issues that spurred his resignation. The couple also appeared on the syndicated television show &quot;Divorce Court&quot; in April 2009. On the program, Ted says he wanted his wife to divorce him after the scandal, saying that he thought he had become so &quot;toxic&quot; that divorce was best for Gayle and their children. On March 11, 2009, Haggard attended a performance in New York of &quot;This Beautiful City&quot;, a play about him and the Colorado Springs evangelical community. In August 2009, Haggard told &quot;Charisma&quot; magazine: &quot;I do not believe my childhood experience is an excuse. I fell into sin and failed to extract myself. I am responsible, and I have repented.&quot; He also extols the benefits of qualified counselors: &quot;I highly recommend qualified Christian counseling... for anyone losing their fight with any kind of compulsive thoughts or behaviors. ... I believe our generation of believers is going to have to accept that it&#x27;s not always lack of faith if we need counseling for assistance with integrity. If I had gone to counseling, I probably could have completely avoided my crisis.&quot;

&quot;Newsweek&quot;&#x27;s June 7, 2010, issue&#x27;s &quot;Back Story&quot; listed Haggard among prominent conservative activists who have a record of supporting anti-gay legislation and are later caught in a gay sex scandal. In a July 2010 interview he gave to CNN, Haggard claimed that his feelings of sexual attraction to other men had miraculously disappeared. Haggard portrayed his encounter with the male prostitute as a massage that went awry.

==Saint James Church==
In October 2009, the &quot;Colorado Springs Independent&quot; published the first extensive interview with Haggard to appear in the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2½-hour interview, the former pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideas, and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. &quot;Back in the old days,&quot; said Haggard, &quot;when somebody would get in trouble, they&#x27;d just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again. Not anymore. Which is one of the reasons why we needed to come home. Because I needed to finish this story from here.&quot;

On November 4, 2009, Haggard posted a message on his Twitter account announcing his intent to begin public prayer meetings in his Colorado Springs home. On December 7, he started holding the prayer meetings in his barn. On June 6, 2010, the first meeting of the new church, with Haggard as pastor, was held at the Haggard home.

In 2010, Haggard and his wife, Gayle, established the Saint James Church in Colorado Springs. In 2015 he became a Free Methodist Church elder. 

On April 1, 2022, Haggard sold the warehouse housing Saint James Church for $1.95 million according to the El Paso County, Colo., Assessors office. The sale came after new allegations surfaced about Haggard&#x27;s alleged inappropriate relationships with boys in the church and more alleged drug use.

Haggard founded a new church in his home in 2022 looking to capitalize on a trend of home-based micro churches.

==Beliefs==
===&quot;Life-Giving Church&quot;===
Haggard developed a concept he called &quot;The Life-Giving Church&quot;, which amounted to his ministry practice. He believed that churches and their members either lived &quot;in the Tree of Life&quot; or &quot;in the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil&quot;, referring to the two trees in the Garden of Eden (see Gen. 2:9). He wrote a book, &quot;The Life-Giving Church,&quot; to expound on this difference, and said that motivations are the key difference between two types of Christians. &quot;One way we can tell which tree we are living in,&quot; wrote Haggard, &quot;is our response to sin... one of the greatest marks of bearing His [Christ&#x27;s] character is our response to someone else&#x27;s sin. If we handle others&#x27; mistakes with a life-giving attitude, then we (and they) have the opportunity to enjoy great power and freedom. But if we handle others&#x27; mistakes negatively, then we&#x27;re eating from the wrong tree and will begin to die.&quot; Christians who live in the &quot;tree of life,&quot; writes Haggard, &quot;grow in their understanding of right and wrong, and they find great insight, wisdom, victory, and joy in the stream of Jesus&#x27; righteousness.&quot; Those who dwell in the opposite tree find and display &quot;frustration, judgmental attitudes, and death.&quot;

In &quot;The Life-Giving Church&quot;, Haggard sets forth bylaws he initiated that were meant to help other churches with forming their own bylaws. A significant part of the bylaws was a universal pay scale Haggard instituted for all pastoral staff. Including himself, all pastors at New Life Church were paid on the same scale so that the longer one was employed, the better the pay became.

A significant part of Haggard&#x27;s ministry at New Life Church was based around an entrepreneurial leadership model, which is also covered in &quot;The Life-Giving Church.&quot; Haggard felt that young and upcoming leaders of the church would bog down in &quot;cumbersome systems&quot; in their churches and decide to take their talents elsewhere, resulting in the church losing its &quot;brightest and best future leaders&quot;. Rather than a top-down command and control hierarchy where Haggard made all the decisions and people fell in line, he instituted a free market concept that encouraged young leaders to debate the best ideas (even to the point of disagreeing with him) and pursue God-inspired dreams and visions in their own departments and beyond. In Haggard&#x27;s book, &quot;Primary Purpose&quot;, he explains that the normal leadership style that governments and many corporations use is top down, while the servant leadership model he teaches is the opposite. In a visual representation, Haggard uses an upside down triangle to illustrate this concept. The leader is at the bottom and the people to be served are on top. This &quot;Philippians 2 Attitude&quot; comes from the scripture that states, &quot;Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in humility consider others better than yourselves. Each of you should look not only to your interests, but also to the interests of others.&quot;

===Politics===
In 2005, Haggard was listed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the top 25 most influential evangelicals in America. Haggard was a firm supporter of former US President George W. Bush, and is sometimes credited with rallying evangelicals behind Bush during the 2004 election. Author Jeff Sharlet reported in 2005 that Haggard &quot;talks to... Bush or his advisers every Monday&quot; and stated at that time that &quot;no pastor in America holds more sway over the political direction of evangelicalism.&quot;

Haggard has stated that fighting global warming is an important issue, a divisive issue among Evangelical leaders. Though he personally supported the Evangelical Climate Initiative, the NAE did not adopt a position.

===Teachings on homosexuality===
In 2006, Haggard and his church supported Colorado Amendment 43 to the Colorado Constitution. It provided, &quot;Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state.&quot; Although Colorado law already defined marriage as being between a man and a woman, Haggard and other gay marriage opponents sought to enshrine the prohibition in the state constitution, so that the Colorado Supreme Court would not have the power to declare the statute unconstitutional. In the movie&quot; Jesus Camp&quot;, Haggard says, &quot;we don&#x27;t have to debate about what we should think about homosexual activity. It&#x27;s written in the Bible.&quot; Haggard initially opposed same-sex marriage, but supported civil unions for homosexual couples. He later came to support same-sex marriage as a civil institution, saying that while he still believes it is forbidden under Biblical law, he feels that &quot;we need to be careful not to inculcate [biblical law] into civil law.&quot;

Under Haggard&#x27;s leadership, the NAE released &quot;For the Health of the Nation: An Evangelical Call to Civic Responsibility&quot; in late 2004, &quot;a document urging engagement in traditional culture war issues such as abortion and gay marriage but also poverty, education, taxes, welfare, and immigration&quot;. The NAE has stated that &quot;homosexual activity, like adulterous relationships, is clearly condemned in the Scriptures.&quot;

=== Spiritual warfare ===
Upon meeting New Apostolic Reformation leader C. Peter Wagner in 1993, Haggard and his New Life Church forged close ties with Wagner, a spiritual warfare proponent. The church engaged in spiritual mapping – in which territorial spirits believed to control regions of the globe and prevent Christian conversion are plotted out – and anointing villages in Mali as well as using spiritual mapping in Colorado Springs. In a 1998 article, Haggard was referred to as a &quot;mapping leader&quot;. The same year, he opened the World Prayer Center, dedicated to spiritual warfare primarily focused in the 10/40 window. He referred to the center as a &quot;spiritual NORAD&quot;.

==Television and movie appearances==
Haggard has appeared on several broadcast network programs, including &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; and ABC&#x27;s &quot;20/20&quot;. In early 2006, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins interviewed Haggard as part of a British television documentary entitled &quot;The Root of All Evil?&quot;. He also appeared in the documentary &quot;Jesus Camp&quot; (2006), the History Channel documentary &quot;The Antichrist&quot;, the documentary &quot;Constantine&#x27;s Sword&quot; (2007), and the HBO documentary &quot;Friends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi&quot; (2007).

In 2009, Alexandra Pelosi made &quot;The Trials of Ted Haggard&quot;, a film that documented Haggard&#x27;s life in exile after the scandal. The film was aired on HBO, and it has been shown on HBO more than 40 times. &quot;Trials&quot; has received critical acclaim.

In 2012, Haggard appeared in the reality television show &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, where he &quot;swapped wives&quot; for one week with Gary Busey.

==Personal life==
Haggard has been married to Gayle Alcorn since 1978. The couple have five children.

In an interview published in the February 2011 issue of &quot;GQ&quot;, Haggard said, &quot;I think that probably, if I were 21 in this society, I would identify myself as a bisexual,&quot; adding that &quot;Just like you&#x27;re a heterosexual but you don&#x27;t have sex with every woman that you&#x27;re attracted to, so I can be who I am and exclusively have sex with my wife and be perfectly satisfied.&quot;

He was born in Milan into a lower-middle-class family. His father, Guido Gaberscik, was born in Trieste when the city was still part of Austria-Hungary. The surname Gaberscik is of Slovene origin (Gaberščik). His mother was from the Veneto region. The two met and married in Veneto and later moved to Milan, where Giorgio was born.

Gaber began to play as rehabilitation for an injury to his hand which required constant but not strenuous activity to recover his motor skills. Since his health as a child was not the best and his older brother Marcello played guitar, he was encouraged to play as well. The outcome was good both in terms of his health and artistically, and at only fourteen years of age, he was engaged to play at a New Eve&#x27;s party and earned his first paycheck of 1,000 lire.

Subsequently, he began to frequent the &quot;Santa Tecla&quot;, a venue in Milan where he had the chance to meet musicians of the time, including Luigi Tenco, Gian Franco Reverberi, Adriano Celentano, Ricky Gianco, and Mogol, who obtained a contract for Gaber with Dischi Ricordi. He then played with the Rocky Mountains Old Time Stompers (replacing Tony Dallara who had left to pursue a solo career) and with Rolling Crew.

Because neither Tenco nor Gaber were yet members of the Italian Society of Authors and Publishers (SIAE), they could not trademark the song &quot;Ciao ti dirò&quot; (inspired by Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;), which was signed off by Giorgio Calabrese and Giampiero Reverberi despite being composed by Tenco and Gaber.

The two went on to continue writing music together, developing at the same time a close friendship. In 1958 they toured Germany together with Adriano Celentano, Enzo Jannacci, Paolo Tomelleri, and Gianfranco Reverberi.

Gaber paired up with Enzo Jannacci as &quot;I Due Corsari&quot;, who made their debut at the end of 1958 with two vinyl singles—&quot;Come Facette Mammeta&quot;, a classic song of Neapolitan humour, and &quot;Non occupatemi il telefono&quot;. They continued to release singles with Dischi Ricordi throughout the following year, and in 1960 released their first album, &quot;Giorgio Gaber – Enzo Jannacci&quot;.
After a sentimental-artistic companionship with singer and actress Maria Monti, he married Ombretta Colli in 1965, then a student of languages (Chinese and Russian) at the University of Milan. In 1966 she gave birth to daughter Dalia.

He took part to Sanremo Music Festival four times, with the songs &quot;Benzina e cerini&quot; in 1961, &quot;Così felice&quot; in 1964, &quot;Mai, Mai, Mai Valentina&quot; in 1966, and &quot;...E allora dai&quot; in 1967.

===&quot;Il signor G&quot;===
In 1969 he released one of his best-known successes, &quot;Com&#x27;è bella la città&quot;, an example of the introduction of social matters in a song. The following year, he showed at Piccolo Teatro di Milano his first edition of &quot;Il signor G&quot; (&quot;Mister G&quot;), a recital he repeated in many Italian squares.

In 1973, he recorded the one song by which he is most recognized by international audiences: &quot;Far Finta di Essere Sani&quot;, which was covered in English as &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Got to be Sunny&quot; by Tony Orlando and Dawn on their 1975 album &quot;He Don&#x27;t Love You (Like I Love You)&quot;.

A year later, he was given the very first Premio Tenco award, and many years later, also received the Targa Tenco in 2001 for his song &quot;La razza in estinzione&quot; and in 2003 for the album &quot;Io non mi sento italiano&quot;. After the Tenco award Gaber abandoned television and began to tour only in theatres, as one of the founders of the &quot;teatro canzone&quot; (&#x27;theatre song&#x27;) genre. He would appear again on TV, although sporadically, only in the 1990s and early 2000s.

==Death==

A lifelong smoker, Giorgio Gaber died on New Year&#x27;s Day 2003 after a long battle with lung cancer, in his country house in Montemagno, near Camaiore, Tuscany, and his body was buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan.

In 2004, the refurbished underground auditorium of the Pirelli Tower in Milan was dedicated to him.

In 2012, Patti Smith recorded the cover of &quot;Io come persona&quot;, translated into English &quot;I as a person&quot;, contained in the anthological album &quot;...io ci sono&quot;.

On 25 January 2022, Gaber was honoured with a Google Doodle in celebration of his 83rd birthday.

<text>Lars Berger (born 1 May 1979) is a former Norwegian biathlete and cross-country skier.

==Life and career==
Fellow former biathlete Tora Berger is his sister. Berger&#x27;s family moved to Lesja Municipality in Oppland county in 1985. At the age of six, Berger started cross-country skiing, but during his teens he decided to try out biathlon.

Berger joined the national biathlon team in 2001. During the 2004 Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, Germany, he won silver medals in the 15 km mass start and the 4 × 7.5 km relay. Berger also won two gold medals in the military world championships that same year (cross-country and patrol). Berger finished fifth in the 2004 overall World Cup, and won several gold medals from the Norwegian Biathlon Championships. At the 2007 Biathlon World Championships in Rasen-Antholz, Italy, Berger was part of the Norwegian team that won silver in the 4 × 7.5 km relay. After several disappointing races, mainly due to unstable shooting, Berger was thrown off the Norwegian national team ahead of the 2008/2009 season. He revenged this by retrieving two world cup victories in sprint events, a silver in the World Championship sprint, and contributed to the gold in the men&#x27;s relay. He was regarded as perhaps the fastest skier on the biathlon tour, but his lack of shooting accuracy often prevented him from producing consistent and winning results.

Berger also competed in cross-country skiing from 2002. He won the 30 km and relay at the 2003 Norwegian cross-country skiing championships in Molde. Berger won a gold in the 4 × 10 km at the 2005 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in Oberstdorf and finished 4th in the 15 km in those same championships. Berger won the gold medal in the 15 km at the Nordic Skiing World Championships in Sapporo in 2007.

Berger is the first person to win medals at the World Championships in biathlon and Nordic skiing in the same year. He is also the only athlete to win gold in relays in both World Championships (in Nordic skiing in 2005 and 2007, in biathlon in 2009).

In 2014, Berger won gold medal in the men&#x27;s 15 km cross county skiing in the military world championship in Sodankylä, Finland.

On 27 April 2015, Berger announced his retirement from the sport. He cited a &quot;chronic knee injury&quot; as his reason for retiring.

Though Berger only participated in the 2010 Olympics, in both cross-country skiing and biathlon, he did travel to the Olympic Games as a reserve athlete in biathlon in both 2002 and 2014.

<text>Tableware items are the dishware and utensils used for setting a table, serving food, and dining. The term includes cutlery, glassware, serving dishes, serving utensils, and other items used for practical as well as decorative purposes. The quality, nature, variety and number of objects varies according to culture, religion, number of diners, cuisine and occasion. For example, Middle Eastern, Indian or Polynesian food culture and cuisine sometimes limits tableware to serving dishes, using bread or leaves as individual plates, and not infrequently without use of cutlery. Special occasions are usually reflected in higher quality tableware.
Cutlery is more usually known as &quot;silverware&quot; or &quot;flatware&quot; in the United States, where &quot;cutlery&quot; usually means knives and related cutting instruments; elsewhere cutlery includes all the forks, spoons and other silverware items. Outside the US, &quot;flatware&quot; is a term for &quot;open-shaped&quot; dishware items such as plates, dishes and bowls (as opposed to &quot;closed&quot; shapes like jugs and vases). &quot;Dinnerware&quot; is another term used to refer to tableware, and &quot;crockery&quot; refers to ceramic tableware, today often porcelain or bone china. Sets of dishes are referred to as a &quot;table service&quot;, &quot;dinner service&quot; or &quot;service set&quot;. Table settings or place settings are the dishes, cutlery and glassware used for formal and informal dining. In Ireland, tableware is often referred to as &quot;delph&quot;, the word being an English language phonetic spelling of the word &quot;Delft&quot;, the town from which so much delftware came. Silver service or butler service are methods for a butler or waiter to serve a meal.

&quot;Setting the table&quot; refers to arranging the tableware, including individual place settings for each diner at the table as well as decorating the table itself in a manner suitable for the occasion. Tableware and table decoration are typically more elaborate for special occasions. Unusual dining locations demand tableware be adapted.

==Materials==
In recent centuries, flatware is commonly made of ceramic materials such as earthenware, stoneware, bone china or porcelain. The popularity of ceramics is at least partially due to the use of glazes as these ensure the ware is impermeable, reduce the adherence of pollutants and ease washing. In 2020, the global market for ceramic tableware was estimated to be worth $US2.22 billion, with the top five exporting countries being China ($US834 million), Portugal ($US215 million), Germany ($US113 million), Thailand ($US110 million) and United Kingdom ($US106 million).

Banana leaves are used in some South Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. 
Tableware can also made of other materials, such as wood (including lacquer), metals (such as pewter), tempered glass, acrylic and melamine. Before mass-produced tableware, it was fashioned from available materials, such as wood. Industrialisation and developments in ceramic manufacture made inexpensive tableware available. It is sold either by the piece or as a matched set for a number of diners, normally four, six, eight or twelve place settings.

Cutlery is normally made of metal, especially stainless steel, though large pieces such as ladles for serving may be of wood. The use of porcelain for spoons is popular in some Asian countries. Chopsticks are made of wood, bamboo, metal, ivory and plastic.

Disposable tableware includes all disposable tableware such as 
paper and plastic. Due to environment concerns, single-use plastic plates and cutlery will be banned in England from October 2023. A similar ban has been place in the EU since July 2021. Canada is also planning such legislation. A &quot;kulhar&quot; is a traditional handle-less pottery cup from South Asia that is typically undecorated and unglazed, and is meant to be disposable.

==History==
===Plates and other vessels===

The earliest pottery in cultures around the world does not seem to have included flatware, concentrating on pots and jars for storage and cooking. Wood does not survive well in most places, and though archaeology has found few wooden plates and dishes from prehistory, they may have been common, once the tools to fashion them were available.

Ancient elites in most cultures preferred flatware in precious metals (&quot;plate&quot;) at the table; China and Japan were two major exceptions, using lacquerware and later fine pottery, especially porcelain. In China, bowls have always been preferred to plates. In Europe, pewter was often used by the less-well-off (and eventually, the poor), and silver or gold was preferred by wealthier individuals. Religious considerations influenced the choice of materials, as well: Muhammad spoke against using gold at table, as the contemporary elites of Persia and the Byzantine Empire did, and this greatly encouraged the growth of Islamic pottery.

In Europe, the elites dined off metal, usually silver for the rich and pewter for the middling classes, from the ancient Greeks and Romans until the 18th century.

A trencher (from Old French &quot;tranchier&quot; &#x27;to cut&#x27;) was commonly used in medieval cuisine. A trencher was originally a flat round of (usually stale) bread used as a plate, upon which the food could be placed to eat. At the end of the meal, the trencher could be eaten with sauce, but could also be given as alms to the poor. Similar use of bread is still found with the bread bowl.

The trencher was not fully replaced in France until the 1650s, although in Italy maiolica was used from the 15th century. Orders survive for large services. At an Este family wedding feast in Ferrara in 1565, 12,000 plates painted with the Este arms were used, though the &quot;top table&quot; probably ate off precious metal.

Possession of tableware has to a large extent been determined by individual wealth; the greater the means, the higher was the quality of tableware that was owned and the more numerous its pieces. The materials used were often controlled by sumptuary laws. In the late Middle Ages and for much of the Early Modern period much of a great person&#x27;s disposable assets were often in &quot;plate&quot;, vessels and tableware in precious metal, and what was not in use for a given meal was often displayed on a &quot;dressoir de parement&quot; or &quot;buffet&quot; (similar to a large Welsh dresser) against the wall in the dining hall. At the wedding of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal in 1429, there was a dresser 20 feet long on either side of the room, each with five rows of plate; A comparable display on three &quot;dressoirs&quot; could be seen at the State Banquet in Buckingham Palace for the US President, Donald Trump in 2019. Inventories of King Charles V of France (r. 1364–1380) record that he had 2,500 pieces of plate.

Plate was often melted down to finance wars or building, or until the 19th century just for remaking in a more fashionable style, and hardly any of the enormous quantities recorded in the later Middle Ages survives. The French Royal Gold Cup now in the British Museum, in solid gold and decorated with enamel and pearls, is one of few secular exceptions. Weighing more than two kilos, it was perhaps passed around for ceremonial toasts. Another is the much plainer English silver Lacock Cup, which has survived as it was bequeathed to a church early on, for use as a chalice.

The same is true for French silver from the 150 years before the French Revolution, when French styles, either originals or local copies, were used by all the courts of Europe. London silversmiths came a long way behind, but were the other main exporters. French silver now survives almost entirely in the form of exported pieces, like the Germain Service for the King of Portugal.

In London in the 13th century, the more affluent citizens owned fine furniture and silver, &quot;while those of straiter means possessed only the simplest pottery and kitchen utensils.&quot; By the later 16th century, &quot;even the poorer citizens dined off pewter rather than wood&quot; and had plate, jars and pots made from &quot;green glazed earthenware&quot;. The nobility often used their arms on heraldic china.
The final replacement of silver tableware with porcelain as the norm in French aristocratic dining had taken place by the 1770s. After this the enormous development of European porcelain and cheaper fine earthenwares like faience and creamware, as well as the resumption of large imports of Chinese export porcelain, often armorial porcelain decorated to order, led to matching &quot;china&quot; services becoming affordable by an ever-wider public. By 1800 cheap versions of these were often brightly decorated with transfer printing in blue, and were beginning to be affordable by the better-off working-class household. Until the mid-19th century the American market was largely served by imports from Britain, with some from China and the European continent.

The introduction to Europe of hot drinks, mostly but not only tea and coffee, as a regular feature of eating and entertaining, led to a new class of tableware. In its most common material, various types of ceramics, this is often called teaware. It developed in the late 17th century, and for some time the serving pots, milk jugs and sugar bowls were often in silver, while the cups and saucers were ceramic, often in Chinese export porcelain or its Japanese equivalent. By the mid 18th century matching sets of European &quot;china&quot; were usual for all the vessels, although these often did not include plates for cake etc. until the next century. This move to local china was rather delayed by the tendency of some early types of European soft-paste porcelain to break if too hot liquid was poured into it.

===Cutlery===

The knife is the oldest type of cutlery; early ones were normally carried by the individual at all times. Forks and spoons came later, and are initially only for the wealthy, who typically carried their own personal set. After the Romans, who made great use of spoons, joined by forks later, there were only knives and perhaps wooden spoons for most of the Middle Ages. It was only in the 17th century that hosts among the elite again began to lay out cutlery at the table, although at an Italian banquet in 1536 for Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, it is recorded that each guest was provided with knife, spoon and fork, evidently a rarity. The table fork was revived in Italy in the 16th century, and was described for his English readers by Thomas Coryat in the 1590s as &quot;not used in any other country that I saw in my travels&quot;. In England and France, it only became common after the 1660s, even in the court of Louis XIV, and for a while seems to have mostly been used by ladies, and for especially messy food, like fruits in syrup.

===Chopsticks===

Chopsticks ( or ; Pinyin: &quot;kuaizi&quot; or &quot;zhu&quot;) are shaped pairs of equal-length sticks that have been used as both kitchen and eating utensils in much of East and Southeast Asia for over three millennia. Traditionally wood, especially bamboo, although other materials such as plastic or metal are also used. Usually, they have a square profile at the slightly thicker end held in the hand, but are round at the other end, that touches the food.

Chopsticks have been used since at least the Shang dynasty (1766–1122 BCE). However, the Han dynasty historian Sima Qian wrote that it is likely that chopsticks were also used in the preceding Xia dynasty and even the earlier Erlitou culture, although finding archeological evidence from this era is incredibly difficult.

Though originating in China, chopsticks later spread to Japan, Korea, Tibet, Vietnam and other parts of Asia. Chopsticks have become more accepted in connection with Asian food in the West, especially in cities with significant Asian diaspora communities.

===Table decoration===

Tableware is generally the functional part of the settings on dining tables but great attention has been paid to the purely decorative aspects, especially when dining is regarded as part of entertainment such as in banquets given by important people or special events, such as State occasions. Table decoration may be ephemeral and consist of items made from confectionery or wax; substances commonly employed in Roman banqueting tables of the 17th century. During the reign of George III of the United Kingdom, ephemeral table decoration was done by men known as &quot;table-deckers&quot; who used sand and similar substances to create marmotinto works (sand painting) for single-use decoration. In modern times, ephemeral table decorations continue to be made from sugar or carved from ice.

The porcelain figurine began in early 18th-century Germany as a permanent replacement for sugar sculptures on the dining table.

In wealthy countries, table decorations for the aristocracy were often made of precious metals such as silver-gilt. The model ship or nef was popular throughout the Renaissance. One of the most famous table decorations is the &quot;Cellini Salt Cellar&quot;. Ephemeral and silver table decorations were sometimes replaced with porcelain after it was made in Europe from the 18th century onwards.

==Western style==
===Table settings===

A table setting in Western countries is mainly in one of two styles: &quot;service à la russe&quot; (French for &quot;in the Russian style&quot;), where each course of the meal is brought out in specific order; and &quot;service à la française&quot; (French for &quot;in the French style&quot;), where all the courses for the meal are arranged on the table and presented at the same time that guests are seated. &quot;Service à la russe&quot; has become the custom in most restaurants, whereas &quot;service à la française&quot; is the norm in family settings.

Place settings for &quot;service à la russe&quot; dining are arranged according to the number of courses in the meal. The tableware is arranged in a particular order. With the first course, each guest at the table begins by using the tableware placed on the outside of place setting. As each course is finished the guest leaves the used cutlery on the used plate or bowl, which are removed from the table by the server. In some case, the original set is kept for the next course. To begin the next course, the diner uses the next item on the outside of the place setting, and so on. Forks are placed on the left of a dinner plate, knives to the right of the plate, and spoons to the outer right side of the place setting.

=== Flatware, plates and bowls ===

Items of tableware include a variety of plates, bowls; or cups for individual diners and a range of serving dishes to transport the food from the kitchen or to separate smaller dishes. Plates include charger plates as well as specific dinner plates, lunch plates, dessert plates, salad plates or side plates. Bowls include those used for soup, cereal, pasta, fruit or dessert. A range of saucers accompany plates and bowls, those designed to go with teacups, coffee cups, demitasses and cream soup bowls. There are also individual covered casserole dishes. In the 19th century, crescent-shaped bone dishes could be used to hold side-salad or to discard bones.

Warewashing is essential but can be costly regardless of whether done by hand or in a dishwasher. Dishes come in standard sizes, which are set according to the manufacturer. They are similar throughout the industry. Plates are standardised in descending order of diameter size according to function. One standard series is charger (12 inches); dinner plate (10.5 inches); dessert plate (8.5 inches) salad plate (7.5 inches); side plate, tea plate (6.75 inches).

===Drinkware===
Glasses and mugs of various types are an important part of tableware, as beverages are important parts of a meal. Vessels to hold alcoholic beverages such as wine, whether red, white, sparkling tend to be quite specialised in form, with for example Port wine glasses, beer glasses, brandy balloons, aperitif and liqueur glasses all having different shapes. Water glasses, juice glasses and hot chocolate mugs are also differentiated. Their appearance as part of the tableware depends on the meal and the style of table arrangement.

Tea and coffee tend to involve strong social rituals and so teacups and, coffee cups (including demitasse cups) have a shape that depends on the culture and the social situation in which the drink is taken.

===Cutlery===

Cutlery is an important part of tableware. A basic formal place setting will usually have a dinner plate at the centre, resting on a charger. The rest of the place setting depends upon the first course, which may be soup, salad or fish.
* If soup is the first course, to the left of the dinner plate, moving clockwise, are placed a small salad fork to the left of the dinner plate; a large dinner fork to the left of the salad fork; a side plate above the forks; a wine or water glass above and to the right of the dinner plate; a large dinner knife to the right of the dinner plate; a smaller butter knife to the right of the dinner knife; a dinner spoon to the right of the knives; a soup spoon to the right of the dinner spoon.
* If salad is the first course, the soup spoon is skipped. The dinner fork is placed immediately left of the dinner plate; the salad fork is placed on the outer left side of the place setting.

In either arrangement, the napkin may either rest folded underneath the forks, or it may be folded and placed on the dinner plate.

When more courses are being served, place settings may become more elaborate and cutlery more specialised. Examples include fruit spoon or fruit knife, cheese knife, and pastry fork. Other types of cutlery, such as boning forks, were used when formal meals included dishes that have since become less common. Carving knives and forks are used to carve roasts at the table.

===Serving dishes===
A wide range of serving dishes are used to transport food from kitchen to table or to serve it at table, to make food service easier and cleaner or more efficient and pleasant. Serving dishes include: butter dishes; casseroles; fruit bowls; ramekins or lidded serving bowls; compotes; pitchers or jugs; platters, salvers, and trays; salt and pepper shakers or salt cellars; sauce or gravy boats; tureens and tajines; vegetable or salad bowls.

A range of items specific to the serving of tea or coffee also have long cultural traditions. They include teapots and coffee pots as well as samovars, sugar bowls; milk or cream jugs.

=== Serving utensils ===
Serving utensils are implements used to move food from serving dishes to individual plates. In family-style dining, these might include serving spoons. A fish slice is an early example of a specialty silver service utensil used in waiter or butler service.

=== Place markers ===
Place markers are used to designate assigned seats to guests. They are typically used at large formal functions such as weddings, banquets for dignitaries, politicians or diplomats as well as on special occasions such as large children&#x27;s parties. Some are collectible.

==Chinese style==

Chinese table settings are traditional in style. Table setting practices in Japan and other parts of East Asia have been influenced by Chinese table setting customs. The emphasis in Chinese table settings is on displaying each individual food in a pleasing way, usually in separate bowls or dishes. Formal table settings are based upon the arrangements used in a family setting, although they can become extremely elaborate with many dishes. Serving bowls and dishes are brought to the table, where guests can choose their own portions. Formal Chinese restaurants often use a large turning wheel in the centre of the table to rotate food for easier service.

In a family setting, a meal typically includes a &quot;fan&quot; dish, which constitutes the meal&#x27;s base (much like bread forms the base of various sandwiches), and several accompanying mains, called &quot;cai&quot; dish (&quot;choi&quot; or &quot;seoung&quot; in Cantonese). More specifically, &quot;fan&quot; usually refers to cooked rice, but can also be other staple grain-based foods. If the meal is a light meal, it will typically include the base and one main dish. The base is often served directly to the guest in a bowl, whereas main dishes are chosen by the guest from shared serving dishes on the table.

; Place setting
An &quot;elaborate&quot; formal meal would include the following place setting:
* Centre plate, about 6 inches in diameter
* Rice bowl, placed to the right of the centre plate
* Small cup of tea, placed above the plate or rice bowl
* Chopsticks to the right of the centre plate, on a chopstick rest
* A long-handled spoon on a spoon rest, placed to the left of the chopsticks
* Small condiment dishes, placed above the centre plate
* Soup bowl, placed to the left above the centre plate
* A soup spoon, inside the soup bowl

==Japanese style==

Japanese ceramic tableware industry is many centuries old. Unlike in Western cultures, where tableware is often produced and bought in matching sets, traditional Japanese tableware is set on the table so that each dish complements the type of food served in it. Since Japanese meals normally include several small amounts of each food per person, this means that each person has a place setting with several different small dishes and bowls for holding individual food and condiments. The emphasis in a Japanese table setting is on enhancing the appearance of the food, which is partially achieved by showing contrasts between the items. Each bowl and dish may have a different shape, colour or pattern.

; Place setting
A basic complete place setting for one person in Japan would include the following:
* Hot noodle bowl
* Rice bowl
* Soup bowl
* Two to three shallow 3- to 5-inch diameter dishes
* Two to three 3- to 5-inch diameter, 1- to 3-inch-deep bowls
* Two square or rectangular pieces, traditionally served for serving fish
* Three 2- to 3-inch diameter condiment plates
* Zaru (Cold noodle tray with bamboo strainer)
* Dipping sauce cup
* Chopsticks and chopstick rest

Not all of these plates and bowls would be necessary for one meal. A rice bowl, a soup bowl, two or three small dishes with accompanying foods, and two or three condiment dishes for person would be typical. Various serving bowls and platters would also be set on a table for a typical meal, along with a soy sauce cruet, a small pitcher for tempura or other sauce, and a tea setting of tea pot, tea cups and tea cup saucers.

==Adaptations==

Tableware for special circumstances has to be adapted. Dining in the outdoors, for example, whether for recreational purposes, as on a picnic or as part of a journey, project or mission requires specialised tableware. It must be portable, more robust and if possible, lighter in weight than tableware used indoors. It is usually carefully packed for transportation to the place where it will be used.

<text>Madame Satã was the artistic name of João Francisco dos Santos (1900–1976), a drag performer and capoeirista from Brazil.

==Biography==
He was born into a family of ex-slaves in the state of Pernambuco, Brazil. Having been convicted of murder, spending 27 years in prison, being a former gangster and father of 7, he found refuge in the dark Bohemian culture of Rio de Janeiro amid a lively world of pimps, prostitutes, deviants and samba composers.

João is most commemorated as a figure who fought to redefine himself while battling the stigmas of being a son of former black slaves, illiterate and homosexual. João is quoted for once saying &quot;I was born an outlaw, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ll live.&quot; In between his drag performances, his days as a hustler and his convictions of murder, his image as the legendary cabaret performance artist Madame Satã, meaning &quot;Madam Satan,&quot; having been influenced by the 1930s film by Cecil B. DeMille about a woman disguising herself as a notorious temptress to win back her errant husband. João&#x27;s infamous character represented an expression of resistance in this post abolitionist era in Brazil where black people, prostitutes, drug users and addicts and other &#x27;deviant&#x27; outcasts were deemed useless to society.

He was a skilled street fighter trained in the style of capoeira, and his battles against the police forces were legendary. He routinely fought barehanded against quartets of policemen armed with wooden clubs. A drunken João once resisted arrest by a 24-man platoon, leaving seven of the agents badly wounded, two with broken arms and two with split livers. The rest of the team opted to let him sleep it off rather than shooting him.

João Francisco dos Santos consequently became a living myth that supported and represented the values and lives of such outcasts of society as well as a revolutionary icon for the marginalized socially.

== Film adaptation ==
João Francisco dos Santos&#x27;s story was told in the film &quot;Madame Satã&quot;, directed by Brazilian director Karim Aïnouz and was released in 2002. Lázaro Ramos plays the titular lead.

== Cultural impact ==

* Madame, a decades-old goth nightclub in São Paulo, was named after Madame Satã.

<doc id="1151991" wikidata="Q2651693" url="?curid=1151991" title="Logic in computer science">
<text>Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:
* Theoretical foundations and analysis
* Use of computer technology to aid logicians
* Use of concepts from logic for computer applications

== Theoretical foundations and analysis ==
Logic plays a fundamental role in computer science. Some of the key areas of logic that are particularly significant are computability theory (formerly called recursion theory), modal logic and category theory. The theory of computation is based on concepts defined by logicians and mathematicians such as Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. Church first showed the existence of algorithmically unsolvable problems using his notion of lambda-definability. Turing gave the first compelling analysis of what can be called a mechanical procedure and Kurt Gödel asserted that he found Turing&#x27;s analysis &quot;perfect.&quot;. In addition some other major areas of theoretical overlap between logic and computer science are:
*Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem proves that any logical system powerful enough to characterize arithmetic will contain statements that can neither be proved nor disproved within that system. This has direct application to theoretical issues relating to the feasibility of proving the completeness and correctness of software. 
*The frame problem is a basic problem that must be overcome when using first-order logic to represent the goals of an artificial intelligence agent and the state of its environment. 

*The Curry–Howard correspondence is a relation between logical systems and programming languages. This theory established a precise correspondence between proofs and programs. In particular it showed that terms in the simply typed lambda calculus correspond to proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic.
*Category theory represents a view of mathematics that emphasizes the relations between structures. It is intimately tied to many aspects of computer science: type systems for programming languages, the theory of transition systems, models of programming languages and the theory of programming language semantics.
*Logic programming is a programming, database and knowledge representation paradigm that is based on formal logic. A logic program is a set of sentences about some problem domain. Computation is performed by applying logical reasoning to solve problems in the domain. Major logic programming language families include Prolog, Answer Set Programming (ASP) and Datalog.

== Computers to assist logicians ==
One of the first applications to use the term artificial intelligence was the Logic Theorist system developed by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon in 1956. One of the things that a logician does is to take a set of statements in logic and deduce the conclusions (additional statements) that must be true by the laws of logic. For example, if given the statements &quot;All humans are mortal&quot; and &quot;Socrates is human&quot; a valid conclusion is &quot;Socrates is mortal&quot;. Of course this is a trivial example. In actual logical systems the statements can be numerous and complex. It was realized early on that this kind of analysis could be significantly aided by the use of computers. Logic Theorist validated the theoretical work of Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead in their influential work on mathematical logic called &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;. In addition, subsequent systems have been utilized by logicians to validate and discover new mathematical theorems and proofs.

== Logic applications for computers ==
There has always been a strong influence from mathematical logic on the field of artificial intelligence (AI). From the beginning of the field it was realized that technology to automate logical inferences could have great potential to solve problems and draw conclusions from facts. Ron Brachman has described first-order logic (FOL) as the metric by which all AI knowledge representation formalisms should be evaluated. First-order logic is a general and powerful method for describing and analyzing information. The reason FOL itself is simply not used as a computer language is that it is actually too expressive, in the sense that FOL can easily express statements that no computer, no matter how powerful, could ever solve. For this reason every form of knowledge representation is in some sense a trade off between expressivity and computability. The more expressive the language is, the closer it is to FOL, the more likely it is to be slower and prone to an infinite loop.

For example, IF–THEN rules used in expert systems approximate to a very limited subset of FOL. Rather than arbitrary formulas with the full range of logical operators the starting point is simply what logicians refer to as modus ponens. As a result, rule-based systems can support high-performance computation, especially if they take advantage of optimization algorithms and compilation.

On the other hand, logic programming, which combines the Horn clause subset of first-order logic with a non-monotonic form of negation, has both high expressive power and efficient implementations. In particular, the logic programming language Prolog is a Turing complete programming language. Datalog extends the relational database model with recursive relations, while answer set programming is a form of logic programming oriented towards difficult (primarily NP-hard) search problems.

Another major area of research for logical theory is software engineering. Research projects such as the Knowledge Based Software Assistant and Programmer&#x27;s Apprentice programs have applied logical theory to validate the correctness of software specifications. They have also used logical tools to transform the specifications into efficient code on diverse platforms and to prove the equivalence between the implementation and the specification. This formal transformation-driven approach is often far more effortful than traditional software development. However, in specific domains with appropriate formalisms and reusable templates the approach has proven viable for commercial products. The appropriate domains are usually those such as weapons systems, security systems, and real-time financial systems where failure of the system has excessively high human or financial cost. An example of such a domain is Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) design—the process for designing the chips used for the CPUs and other critical components of digital devices. An error in a chip can be catastrophic. Unlike software, chips can&#x27;t be patched or updated. As a result, there is commercial justification for using formal methods to prove that the implementation corresponds to the specification.

Another important application of logic to computer technology has been in the area of frame languages and automatic classifiers. Frame languages such as KL-ONE can be directly mapped to set theory and first-order logic. This allows specialized theorem provers called classifiers to analyze the various declarations between sets, subsets, and relations in a given model. In this way the model can be validated and any inconsistent definitions flagged. The classifier can also infer new information, for example define new sets based on existing information and change the definition of existing sets based on new data. The level of flexibility is ideal for handling the ever changing world of the Internet. Classifier technology is built on top of languages such as the Web Ontology Language to allow a logical semantic level on top of the existing Internet. This layer is called the Semantic Web.

Temporal logic is used for reasoning in concurrent systems.

<text>Johan Gustaf Knut Wicksell (December 20, 1851 – May 3, 1926) was a Swedish economist of the Stockholm school. He was professor at Uppsala University and Lund University.

He made contributions to theories of population, value, capital and money, as well as methodological contributions to econometrics. His economic contributions would influence both the Keynesian and Austrian schools of economic thought. He was married to the noted feminist Anna Bugge.

== Early life ==
Wicksell was born in Stockholm on December 20, 1851. His father was a relatively successful businessman and real estate broker. He lost both his parents at a relatively early age. His mother died when he was only six, and his father died when he was fifteen. His father&#x27;s considerable estate allowed him to enroll at the University of Uppsala in 1869 to study mathematics, astronomy and physics.

==Education==
He received his first degree in two years, and he engaged in graduate studies until 1885, when he received his doctorate in mathematics. In 1887, Wicksell received a scholarship to study on the Continent, where he heard lectures by the economist Carl Menger in Vienna. In the following years, his interests began to shift toward the social sciences, particularly economics.

== Lecturer ==
As a lecturer at Uppsala, Wicksell attracted attention because of his opinions about labour. At one lecture, he condemned drunkenness and prostitution as alienating, degrading, and impoverishing. Although he was sometimes identified as a socialist, his solution to the problem was decidedly Malthusian in advocating birth control, which he would defend to the end of his life. Wicksell has been described as an &quot;ardent neo-Malthusian.&quot;

His fiery ideas had attracted some attention, but his first work in economics, &quot;Value, Capital and Rent&quot; (1892), went largely unnoticed. In 1896, he published &quot;Studies in the theory of Public Finance&quot; and applied the ideas of marginalism to progressive taxation, public goods and other aspects of public policy, attracting considerably more interest.

Economics in Sweden at the time was taught as part of the law school, and Wicksell was unable to gain a chair until he was awarded a law degree. Accordingly, he returned to the University of Uppsala where he completed the usual four-year law degree course in two years, and he became an associate professor at that university in 1899. The next year, he became a full professor at Lund University, where he would undertake his most influential work.

== Later life ==
In 1916, he retired from his post at Lund and took a position at Stockholm advising the government on financial and banking issues. In Stockholm, Wicksell associated himself with other future great economists of the so-called &quot;Stockholm School,&quot; such as Bertil Ohlin, Gunnar Myrdal and Erik Lindahl. He also taught a young Dag Hammarskjöld, the future Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Wicksell died in 1926 while he was writing a final work on the theory of interest.

== Work ==

=== Influences ===
Wicksell was enamored with the theory of Léon Walras (the Lausanne school), Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk (the Austrian school), and David Ricardo, and sought a synthesis of the three theoretical visions of the economy. Wicksell&#x27;s work on creating a synthetic economic theory earned him a reputation as an &quot;economist&#x27;s economist.&quot; For instance, although the marginal productivity theory – the idea that payments to factors of production equilibrate to their marginal productivity – had been laid out by others such as John Bates Clark, Wicksell presented a far simpler and more robust demonstration of the principle, and much of the present conception of that theory stems from Wicksell&#x27;s model.
Wicksell&#x27;s (1898, 1906) theory of the &quot;cumulative process&quot; of inflation remains the first decisive swing at the idea of money as a &quot;veil&quot; as well as Say&#x27;s law.

Extending from Ricardo&#x27;s investigation of income distribution, Wicksell concluded that even a totally unfettered economy was not destined to equalize wealth as a number of Wicksell&#x27;s predecessors had predicted. Instead, Wicksell posited, wealth created by growth would be distributed to those who had wealth in the first place. From this, and from theories of marginalism, Wicksell defended a place for government intervention to improve national welfare. Wicksell influenced the field of constitutional political economy. His 1896 work on fiscal theory &quot;Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen&quot; called attention to the significance of the rules within which choices are made by political agents, and he recognized that efforts at reform must be directed toward changes in the rules for making decisions rather than trying to influence the behaviour of the actors.

===&quot;Interest and Prices,&quot; 1898===

Wicksell&#x27;s most influential contribution was his theory of interest, originally published in German language as &quot;Geldzins und Güterpreise&quot;, in 1898. The English translation &quot;Interest and Prices&quot; became available in 1936; a literal translation of the original title would read &quot;Money Interest and Commodity Prices&quot;. Wicksell invented the key term &quot;natural rate of interest&quot; and defined it as that interest rate which is compatible with a stable price level. If the interest rate falls short of the natural rate, inflation is likely to arise; if the interest rate exceeds the natural rate, this will tend to produce deflation. An interest rate that coincides with the natural rate ensures equilibrium in the commodity market and produces price level stability. This theory was adopted and expanded upon by the Austrian School, which theorized that an economic boom happened when (due to monetary expansions) the spot interest rate fell below the &quot;natural,&quot; unhampered money market rate.

=== Cumulative process ===
This contribution, called the &quot;cumulative process,&quot; implied that if the natural rate of interest was &quot;not&quot; equal to the interest rate on loans, investment demand and savings would differ. If the interest rate is beneath the natural rate, an economic expansion occurs, and prices, &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;, will rise. This gave an early theory of endogenous money – money created by the internal workings of the economy, rather than external factors, and various theories of endogenous money have since developed.

Wicksell&#x27;s theory of the &quot;cumulative process&quot; of inflation remains the first decisive swing at the idea of money as a &quot;veil&quot;. Wicksell&#x27;s process has its roots in that of Henry Thornton. Recall that the start of the Quantity theory&#x27;s mechanism is a helicopter drop of cash: an exogenous increase in the supply of money. Wicksell&#x27;s theory claims, indeed, that increases in the supply of money leads to rises in price levels, but the original increase is endogenous, created by the relative conditions of the financial and real sectors. With the existence of credit money, Wicksell argued, two interest rates prevail: the &quot;natural&quot; rate and the &quot;money&quot; rate. The natural rate is the return on capital – or the real profit rate. It can be roughly considered to be equivalent to the marginal product of new capital. The money rate, in turn, is the loan rate, an entirely financial construction. Credit, then, is perceived quite appropriately as &quot;money&quot;. Banks provide credit, after all, by creating deposits upon which borrowers can draw. Since deposits constitute part of real money balances, therefore the bank can, in essence, &quot;create&quot; money.

=== Quantity theory of money ===
Wicksell&#x27;s main thesis, that disequilibrium engendered by real changes leads endogenously to an increase in the demand for money – and, simultaneously, its supply as banks try to accommodate it perfectly. Given full employment (a constant Y) and payments structure (constant V), then in terms of the equation of exchange, MV = PY, a rise in M leads only to a rise in P. Thus, the story of the Quantity theory of money, the long-run relationship between money and inflation, is kept in Wicksell.

Primarily, Say&#x27;s law is violated and abandoned by the wayside. Namely, when real aggregate supply does constrain, inflation results because capital goods industries cannot meet new real demands for capital goods by entrepreneurs by increasing capacity. They may try but this would involve making higher bids in the factor market which itself is supply-constrained – thus raising factor prices and hence the price of goods in general. In short, inflation is a real phenomenon brought about by a rise in real aggregate demand over and above real aggregate supply.

Finally, for Wicksell the endogenous creation of money, and how it leads to changes in the commodity market is fundamentally a breakdown of the Neoclassical tradition of a dichotomy between monetary and real sectors. Money is not a &quot;veil&quot; – agents do react to it and this is not due to some irrational &quot;money illusion&quot;. However, we should remind ourselves that, for Wicksell, in the long run, the Quantity Theory still holds: money is still neutral in the long run, although to do so, Wicksell has broken the Neoclassical principles of dichotomy, money supply exogeneity and Say&#x27;s law.

=== Reception ===
Parts of Wicksell&#x27;s ideas would be expanded upon by the Austrian school, which used it to form a theory of the business cycle based on central bank policy – changes in the level of money in the economy would shift the market rate of exchange in some way relative to the natural rate, and thus trigger a change in the relative proportion of the production of consumer goods to investment, which would ultimately result in an economic correction, or recession, in which the proportion of production of consumption goods to investment in the economy is pushed back towards the level that the natural rate of interest would result in. The cumulative process was the leading theory of the business cycle until John Maynard Keynes&#x27; &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot;. Wicksell&#x27;s theory would be a strong influence in Keynes&#x27;s ideas of growth and recession,
in Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s key concept Circular Cumulative Causation and also in Joseph Schumpeter&#x27;s &quot;creative destruction&quot; theory of the business cycle.

Wicksell&#x27;s main intellectual rival was the American economist Irving Fisher, who espoused a more succinct explanation of the quantity theory of money, resting it almost exclusively on long run prices. Wicksell&#x27;s theory was considerably more complicated, beginning with interest rates in a system of changes in the real economy. Although both economists concluded from their theories that at the heart of the business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would not be solved in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later.

Wicksell also expressed his views on many social issues and was often a critic of the status quo. He questioned the institutions of rank, marriage, the church, the monarchy, and the military. While Wicksell fought for a more equal distribution of wealth and income, he saw himself primarily as an educator of the public. He desired to influence more than just the field of monetary economics.

== Legacy ==
Elements of his public policy were taken strongly to heart by the Swedish government, including his price-level targeting rule during the 1930s (Jonung 1979) and his vision of a welfare state. Wicksell&#x27;s contributions to economics have been described by some economists, including historian-of-economics Mark Blaug, as fundamental to modern macroeconomics. Michael Woodford has especially praised Wicksell&#x27;s advocacy of using the interest rate to maintain price stability, noting that it was a remarkable insight when most monetary policy was based on the gold standard (Woodford, 2003, p. 32). Woodford calls his own framework &#x27;neo-Wicksellian&#x27;, and he titled his textbook on monetary policy in homage to Wicksell&#x27;s work.

<text>Hyperactivation is a type of sperm motility. Hyperactivated sperm motility is characterised by a high amplitude, asymmetrical beating pattern of the sperm tail (flagellum). This type of motility may aid in sperm penetration of the zona pellucida, which encloses the ovum.

Hyperactivation could then be followed by the acrosome reaction where the cap-like structure on the head of the cell releases the enzymes it contains. This facilitates the penetration of the ovum and fertilisation.

Some definitions consider sperm activation to consist of these two processes of hyperactivation and the acrosome reaction.

Hyperactivation is a term also used to express an X chromosome gene dosage compensation mechanism and is seen in Drosophila. Here, a complex of proteins bind to the X-linked genes to effectively double their genetic activity. This allows males (XY) to have equal genetic activity as females (XX), whose X&#x27;s are not hyperactivated.

==Mechanisms==
Mammalian sperm cells become more active when they approach an egg cell in a process called sperm activation. Sperm activation has been shown to be caused by calcium ionophores &quot;in vitro&quot;, progesterone released by nearby cumulus cells and binding to ZP3 of the zona pellucida.

The initial change is called &quot;hyperactivation&quot;, which causes a change in spermatozoa motility. They swim faster and their tail movements become more forceful and erratic.

A recent discovery links hyperactivation to a sudden influx of calcium ion into the tails. The whip-like tail (flagellum) of the sperm is studded with ion channels formed by proteins called CatSper. These channels are selective, allowing only calcium ion to pass. The opening of CatSper channels is responsible for the influx of calcium. The sudden rise in calcium levels causes the flagellum to form deeper bends, propelling the sperm more forcefully through the viscous environment. Sperm hyperactivity is necessary for breaking through two physical barriers that protect the egg from fertilization.

Hyperactivation has also shown to serve as a feature of the human sperm chemotaxis. When the sperm is exposed to chemo-attractant, especially progesterone; the sperm will exhibit sudden flagellar arrest, followed by sharp turn and hyperactivation. This response suggests that hyperactivation serves as method to quickly guide sperm through chemo-attractant gradient.

==Importance to fertilization==
Before reaching the egg, the sperm are often trapped in epithelial cells in a fallopian tube, meaning they are rendered inert unless they undergo hyperactivation. The change in motion and force of the tail movements enable the sperm to escape from the epithelium. Thus, only those sperm which have undergone hyperactivation have the ability to fertilize the egg.

<text>Gaude Mater Polonia (Medieval Latin for &quot;Rejoice, oh Mother Poland&quot;; , Polish: Raduj się, matko Polsko) was one of the most significant medieval Polish hymns, written in Latin between the 13th and the 14th century to commemorate Saint Stanislaus, Bishop of Kraków. Polish knights sang and chanted the hymn after victory in battle, presumably to one of the Gregorian melodies associated with the Eucharistic psalm &quot;O Salutaris Hostia&quot; on which it is based. It&#x27;s widely considered a historical, national anthem of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==History==
The anthem came to existence in 1253, along with the canonization of Stanislaus of Szczepanów on 8 September in Assisi; Stanislaus died a martyr&#x27;s death on 11 April 1079. The author of the anthem is the first Polish composer in music history known by name, the poet Vincent of Kielcza, OP, a Cracovian canon and chaplain of Bishop Iwo Odrowąż. For a long time he was mistakenly called Vincent of Kielce, and he wrote the hymn to commemorate the canonization of Saint Stanislaus. It is assumed that the first performance of the piece took place on 8 May 1254, during the canonization ceremonies in Kraków.

Vincent wrote &quot;The History of St. Stanislas&quot; in Latin (&quot;Dies adest celebris&quot;). The poet decided to describe the life and accomplishments of Bishop Stanislaus and the miracles which occurred after his death, which people had been speaking of for almost two centuries. The legend says that after the body of St. Stanislaus was dismembered, the parts miraculously regrouped and formed the whole body again, while eagles circled in the sky. This was an allegory of the current state of Poland in those years: split into pieces but hoping to grow back together to form a country again. The uniting of Poland occurred a couple years after the canonization of St. Stanislaus under the rule of King Ladislaus the Short.

Within the &quot;History&quot;, which contained sung elements, the part &quot;Gaude, Mater Polonia&quot; was after a time recognised as an independent piece. Throughout the years, it eventually became the royal anthem under the Piast dynasty. The anthem became a part of Polish tradition and history, being sung during the coronation of the Polish monarch, royal marriages, as well as during celebrations of the 1683 victory of John III Sobieski in Vienna. Kings and military commanders gave thanks for their successes by singing the anthem after battle. The melody has been popular for almost 750 years, in which it has since become a key element of Polish culture. Today it is sung at most universities for the inauguration of the academic year as well as during important national holidays.

==Music==
From a musical view, &quot;Gaude, Mater Polonia&quot; holds a unique melodic line that does not resemble any known in other Latin anthems. Its melody has a symmetrical structure, of an arc or bow type, making it a story-type melody that is characteristic of folk songs. It has an overjoyed but proud character. Some sources say that the inspiration for the melody was the anthem to Saint Dominic, &quot;Gaude Mater Ecclesia&quot; (&quot;Rejoice, oh Mother Church&quot;), having its roots with Italian Dominicans.

It is most commonly sung in the arrangement of Teofil Tomasz Klonowski (1805–1876). It is written for a four-voice, mixed choir, with the melody being captured in a four measure phrase. Although it is no longer the National anthem of Poland, it often accompanies ceremonies of national and religious importance.

<text>Day for night is a set of cinematic techniques used to simulate a night scene while filming in daylight. It is often employed when it is too difficult or expensive to actually film during nighttime. Because both film stocks and digital image sensors lack the sensitivity of the human eye in low light conditions, night scenes recorded in natural light, with or without moonlight, may be underexposed to the point where little or nothing is visible. This problem can be avoided by using daylight to substitute for darkness. When shooting day for night, the scene is typically underexposed in-camera or darkened during post-production, with a blue tint added. Additional effects are often used to heighten the impression of night.

As the light sensitivity of film and video cameras has improved, shooting day for night has become less common in recent years. (A cultural reference as early as 1934 appears in Cole Porter&#x27;s Anything Goes where a list song of the same name includes the observation, &quot;and day&#x27;s night today.&quot;)

==Techniques==
Although moonlight is not blue, it appears bluish to the human eye due to the Purkinje effect. Photographers in the late 19th century exploited this effect by using various chemical techniques to adjust the contrast and color of pictures. Stage productions similarly adopted the use of blue-tinted lighting to illuminate night scenes. This convention continued with silent films, which required a well-lit scene to capture images at the frame rate but often tinted night scenes in blue. To give a bluer appearance to scenes filmed in color, some techniques use 3200K tungsten-balanced rather than 5000K daylight-balanced film stock. The tungsten balance renders artificial lighting (street lights, headlights, lit windows, etc.) as white and unlit areas as &quot;moonlight blue.&quot; With professional video cameras, color temperature adjustments are made to achieve the same effect. With digital post production now nearly universal, the color temperature adjustment is usually made in camera, to preserve the &quot;white&quot; artificial lights, but scene darkening is left to post production for finer control of the effect.

Underexposing the film can add to the illusion of darkness or moonlight. It is typical to underexpose by about two f-stops. A neutral-density filter is often used to achieve this darkening, so that the camera aperture remains unchanged.

Daytime sky can be darkened to simulate night. With black and white film, a red lens filter will turn a blue sky black. Infrared film is occasionally used for long shots, but it renders green foliage as white. Yellow or orange filters (Wratten 8 or 15) can be substituted for closer shots, to preserve the performers&#x27; flesh tones. With color film or video, a graduated neutral-density filter can achieve a similar effect, as can a polarizing filter. Using either of these filters can limit camera movement during a shot, as the axis of a graduated filter must match the horizon, and the effect of the polarizing filter changes as the axis of the camera lens moves relative to the sun. If the scene is backlit by the sun for a &quot;moonlight&quot; rim light effect, faces and other foreground details may be too dark to see properly. Partially filling shadows with reflectors or a 5000K (daylight-balanced) key light can compensate for this. Even so, shadow areas are still slightly under-lit, to match the higher contrast of the overall scene.

With digital post-production techniques it is also common to add or intensify glare and light scattering from light sources that would otherwise be less pronounced in daylight, such as windows revealing indoor lighting, outdoor artificial lights, car headlights, and so on. Day for night techniques can be made more convincing through such digital effects. It is possible to digitally replace the entire sky to add the moon and stars, as was done for the film &quot;Cast Away&quot;. For the 2015 film &quot;Mad Max: Fury Road&quot;, an unusual variation of the technique was used, in which scenes were deliberately overexposed, rather than underexposed as is typically recommended. Taking advantage of the dynamic range of the digital cameras used on the production, the shots were then darkened and color-graded a bluish tint in post-production, with the result that detail was maintained in the shadows rather than being clipped, as might happen when underexposing.

Instead of shooting during midday, it is also common to shoot at dawn or dusk. During these periods, car headlights, streetlights, and interior lights are on, as they would be at night. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;dusk for night.&quot; Shooting this way can be difficult because the desired lighting conditions last only a short time, during which both light levels and color temperatures are constantly changing.

==In other media==
A similar technique can sometimes be observed in older hand-tinted postcard views, where a &quot;night&quot; view of a scene is created by simply re-tinting the original (black and white) photo with darker coloration, suggestive of night.
Though the results resemble day for night film and video shots, the techniques are quite different. Instead of reducing the exposure of the print made for the night version, the colorist painted an identical print with darker individual tints. No attempt at an overall bluish effect was made, and many colors are actually warmer in the &quot;night&quot; scene. (Compare the two beach umbrellas.) Convincing bright spots were added to the streetlights, which are unlit in the original, and the sky was supplied with fewer, wispier clouds.

==Night for day==
A related technique is night for day, where an interior location is filmed at night but lit to simulate daylight, often by projecting large lights through windows.

<text>Seoul Women&#x27;s University (SWU; ) is a private women&#x27;s university in Nowon District, Seoul, South Korea. The university comprises five colleges and is a doctorate degree-granting institution.

==History==
The school was founded in December 1960 by the Presbyterian Church of Korea. The original concept was born in the 1920s, but the Japanese governor at the time refused to grant permission. In the late 1950s, the Presbyterian Church of Korea secured US$150,000 by raising funds at an American conference. In its first few years, Seoul Women&#x27;s University only had two main buildings. Dr. Hwang Kyung Koh served as the first president of the university.

==Campus today==
The university now boasts 5 colleges, with 31 majors for undergraduate students, 25 departments for master&#x27;s degree students, and 13 departments in 2 divisions for students pursuing doctoral degrees. 
==International opportunities==
Through various partnerships and exchange programs with universities in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, New Zealand, Vietnam, China, and Japan, Seoul Women&#x27;s University offers many chances for people from many countries to interact. Korean students are offered short-term cross-cultural exchange programs, and international students are offered internships after finishing their studies. Korean students also have the chance to spend a year abroad in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Great Britain, Germany, Vietnam, China, or Japan. Other opportunities include the SWELL English program, and the Bahrom International Program.

==SWELL English==

The SWELL program stands for Seoul Women’s University English Language License. It is one of the unique programs at Seoul Women’s University. This program has two types: regular classes during semesters or an intensive program in the summer and winter vacations. The main goal of these two programs is exactly the same: improving English skills of all three areas: writing, speaking, and listening. However, the characteristics are different.

A regular class during the semester is only for Seoul Women&#x27;s University students, whereas the intensive program is for anyone who is willing to study English intensively. In a regular SWELL class, students commute from their home. The class starts at 7:15 am. However, students can take regular SWELL courses between classes, so not just the early birds can participate in the program. All classes are small and taught by an English speaker, mostly American and Canadian professors. On the other hand, in the intensive SWELL program, students live in dormitory for six weeks. The most remarkable feature of this program is that participants should speak only English. Therefore, a lot of students of Seoul Women&#x27;s’ University, as well as other well-known university students in Korea, join this program to advance their English skills.

The Intensive SWELL program is not only a demanding course, but has various enjoyable activities such as banquet day, sports days, a singing contest, and a field trip. In other words, Swellers (a term for participants in the intensive SWELL program) attain more active English from different activities rather than passively learning from only English textbooks. The two SWELL programs have different resident styles, run at different periods of time, and include different events. However, both programs are valuable in terms of enhancing English skills.

==Bahrom International Program==

The Bahrom International Program strives to invite foreign students from the university&#x27;s sister colleges in Canada and the United States to learn about and experience Korean culture. Exchange students of Seoul Women&#x27;s University who are attending these sister colleges in the following semester participate in this program.

According to a division of International Relations in Seoul Women&#x27;s University, participants will learn about Korean lifestyle, historical and religious background, the economic issues, politics, North/South tension, Korean pop culture and Korean language through lectures and hands-on experiences such as field trips and group activities. For four weeks of the program, participants live in the Bahrom Education building. In each room, two Korean students and one foreign student stay together. 
Fostering closer relationships between Korean students and foreign students enables foreign students to learn more about Korea. Korean students receive ongoing guidance from the foreign students who are from the sister colleges that they will be attending the next semester as exchange students.

==Notable alumni==

* Kim Ji-ho, actress
* Lee Bo-young, actress
* Go Youn-jung, model and actress

<doc id="1152018" wikidata="Q1242836" url="?curid=1152018" title="Double taxation">
<text>Double taxation is the levying of tax by two or more jurisdictions on the same income (in the case of income taxes), asset (in the case of capital taxes), or financial transaction (in the case of sales taxes).

Double liability may be mitigated in a number of ways, for example, a jurisdiction may:
* exempt foreign-source income from tax,
* exempt foreign-source income from tax if tax had been paid on it in another jurisdiction, or above some benchmark to exclude tax haven jurisdictions, or
* fully tax the foreign-source income but give a credit for taxes paid on the income in the foreign jurisdiction.

Jurisdictions may enter into tax treaties with other countries, which set out rules to avoid double taxation. These treaties often include arrangements for exchange of information to prevent tax evasion such as when a person claims tax exemption in one country on the basis of non-residence in that country, but then does not declare it as foreign income in the other country; or who claims local tax relief on a foreign tax deduction at source that had not actually happened.

The term &quot;double taxation&quot; can also refer to the taxation of some income or activity twice. For example, corporate profits may be taxed first when earned by the corporation (corporation tax) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders as a dividend or other distribution (dividend tax).

There are two types of double taxation: jurisdictional double taxation, and economic double taxation. In the first one, when source rule overlaps, tax is imposed by two or more countries as per their domestic laws in respect of the same transaction, income arises or deemed to arise in their respective jurisdictions. In the latter one, when same transaction, item of income or capital is taxed in two or more states but in hands of different person, double taxation arises.

==International double taxation agreements== 
It is not unusual for a business or individual who is resident in one country to make a taxable gain (earnings, profits) in another country. It could happen that a person will need to pay tax on that income locally and also in the country in which it was made. The stated goals for entering into a treaty often include reduction of double taxation, eliminating tax evasion, and encouraging cross-border trade efficiency. It is generally accepted that tax treaties improve certainty for taxpayers and tax authorities in their international dealings.

A DTA (double tax agreement) may require tax to be levied by the country of residence, and be exempt in the country in which it arises. In other cases, the resident may pay a withholding tax to the country where the income arose, and the taxpayer receives a compensating foreign tax credit in the country of residence to reflect the fact that tax has already been paid. In the former case, the taxpayer would declare himself (in the foreign country) a non-resident. In either case, the DTA may provide that the two taxation authorities exchange information about such declarations. Because of this communication between the countries, they also have a better view on individuals and companies who are trying to avoid or evade tax.

Individuals (&quot;natural persons&quot;) can only be resident for tax purposes in one country at a time. Corporate persons, owning foreign subsidiaries, can be based in one country and simultaneously based in another country: a subsidiary may make substantial income in one country but remit that income (as license fees, for example) to a holding company in another country that has a lower rate of corporation tax. Because of this, the control of unreasonable tax avoidance of corporations becomes more difficult and it requires more investigation when goods, rights and services are transferred.

===Double taxation relief===
Countries may reduce or avoid double taxation either by providing an exemption from taxation (EM) of foreign-source income or providing a foreign tax credit (FTC) for tax paid on foreign-source income.

The EM method requires the home country to collect the tax on income from foreign sources and remit it to the country where it arose. Tax jurisdiction extends only to the national border. When countries rely on territorial principle as described above, they usually depend on the EM method to relieve double taxation. But the EM method is only common for certain income classes or sources, such as international shipping income for example.

The FTC method is used by countries that tax (individual or corporate) residents on income, irrespective of where it arises. The FTC method requires the home country to allow credit against domestic tax liability where the person or company pay foreign income tax.

Another solution used is &#x27;relief provision&#x27;. They create more favorable terms for multinational companies to (remain) based in countries that use less effective measures than the EM or FTC method.

==European Union==

In the European Union, member states have concluded a multilateral agreement on information exchange. This means that they will each report (to their counterparts in each other jurisdiction) a list of those people who have claimed exemption from local taxation on grounds of not being a resident of the state where the income arises. These people should have declared that foreign income in their own country of residence, so any difference suggests tax evasion.

(For a transition period, some states have a separate arrangement. They may offer each non-resident account holder the choice of taxation arrangements: either (a) disclosure of information as above, or (b) deduction of local tax on savings interest at source as is the case for residents).

A 2013 study by Business Europe says that double taxation remains a problem for European MNEs and an obstacle for cross border trade and investments. In particular, the problematic areas are limitation in interest deductibility, foreign tax credits, permanent establishment issues and diverging qualifications or interpretations. Germany and Italy have been identified as the Member States in which most double taxation cases have occurred.

===Cyprus===
Cyprus has entered into over 45 double taxation treaties and is negotiating with many other countries. Under these agreements, a credit is usually allowed against the tax levied by the country in which the taxpayer resides for taxes levied in the other treaty country, resulting in the taxpayer paying no more than the higher of the two rates. Some treaties provide for an additional tax credit for tax which would have been otherwise payable had it not been for incentive measures in the other country which result in exemption or reduction of tax.

===Czech Republic – Korea DTA===
In January 2018, a DTA was signed between Czech Republic and South Korea. The treaty eliminates double taxation between these two countries. In this case, a Korean resident (person or company) that receives dividends from a Czech company needs to balance the Czech dividend withholding tax but also the Czech tax on profits, profits of the company that pays the dividends. The treaty covers taxation of dividends and interest. Under this treaty, dividends that are paid to the other party will be taxed at the maximum of 5% of the total amount of dividend for legal entities as well as for individuals. This treaty reduces from 10% to 5% the limit for taxing paid interest. Copyrights to literature, works of art etc. still remain free from taxation. For patents or trademarks a maximum 10% tax rate is implied.

=== German taxation avoidance ===
If a foreign citizen is in Germany for less than a relevant 183-day period (approximately six months) and is tax resident (&quot;i.e.&quot;, and paying taxes on his or her salary and benefits) elsewhere, then it may be possible to claim tax relief under a particular Double Tax Treaty. The relevant 183 day period is either 183 days in a calendar year or in any period of 12 months, depending upon the particular treaty involved.

So, for example, the Double Tax Treaty with the UK looks at a period of 183 days in the German tax year (which is the same as the calendar year); thus, a citizen of the UK could work in Germany from 1 September through the following 31 May (9 months) and then claim to be exempt from German tax. As the double taxation avoidance agreements will give the protection of income from some countries.

===The Netherlands===
Different factors such as political and social stability, an educated population, a sophisticated public health and legal system, but most of all the corporate taxation makes the Netherlands a very attractive country of doing business in. The Netherlands levies corporate income tax at a 25 per cent rate. Residents taxpayers are taxed on their worldwide income. Non-residents taxpayers are taxed on their income derived from Dutch sources.
There are two sorts of double taxation relief in The Netherlands. Economic double taxation relief is available with regard to proceeds from substantial equity investments under the participation. Juridical double taxation relief is available for resident taxpayers having foreign source income items. In both situations there is a combined system in place which makes difference in active and passive income.

=== Hungary ===
Hungary is unique as it is the only non-developing country (the other, developing country being Eritrea, at a flat 2%) that considers all of its citizens tax residents, and provides no personal allowance (such as the US foreign earned income exclusion) – income is taxed from the first penny earned.

While double taxation agreements do provide for relief from double taxation, Hungary only has some 73 of them in place. This means that Hungarian citizens receiving income from the 120-odd countries and territories that Hungary has no treaty with will be taxed by Hungary, regardless of any tax already paid elsewhere.

==India==
India has comprehensive double taxation avoidance agreement with 88 countries, out of which 85 have entered into force. This means that there are agreed rates of tax and jurisdiction on specified types of income arising in a country to a tax resident of another country. Under the Income Tax Act 1961 of India, there are two provisions, Section 90 and Section 91, which provide specific relief to taxpayers to save them from double taxation. Section 90 (bilateral relief) is for taxpayers who have paid the tax to a country with which India has signed double taxation avoidance agreements, while Section 91 (unilateral relief) provides benefit to tax payers who have paid tax to a country with which India has not signed an agreement. Thus, India gives relief to both kinds of taxpayers. The rates differ from country to country.

Example of double taxation avoidance agreement benefit: Suppose interest on NRI bank deposits attracts 30 per cent tax deduction at source in India. Since India has signed double taxation avoidance agreements with several countries, tax may be deducted at only 10 to 15 per cent instead of 30%.

In case of any conflict between the provisions of the Income Tax Act or double taxation avoidance agreement, the provisions of the latter prevail.

A large number of foreign institutional investors who trade on the Indian stock markets operate from Singapore and the second being Mauritius. According to the tax treaty between India and Mauritius, capital gains arising from the sale of shares are taxable in the country of residence of the shareholder and not in the country of residence of the company whose shares have been sold. Therefore, a company resident in Mauritius selling shares of an Indian company will not pay tax in India. Since there is no capital gains tax in Mauritius, the gain will escape tax altogether.

The Protocol for amendment of the India-Mauritius Convention signed on 10 May 2016, provides for source-based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares acquired from 1 April 2017 in a company resident in India. Simultaneously, investments made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered and will not be subject to capital gains taxation in India. Where such capital gains arise during the transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019, the tax rate will be limited to 50% of the domestic tax rate of India. However, the benefit of 50% reduction in tax rate during the transition period shall be subject to the Limitation of Benefits Article. Taxation in India at full domestic tax rate will take place from financial year 2019–20 onwards.

The revised double taxation avoidance agreement between India and Cyprus signed on 18 November 2016, provides for source based taxation of capital gains arising from alienation of shares, instead of residence based taxation provided under the double taxation avoidance agreement signed in 1994. However, a grandfathering clause has been provided for investments made prior to 1 April 2017, in respect of which capital gains would continue to be taxed in the country of which taxpayer is a resident. It also provides for assistance between the two countries for collection of taxes and updates the provisions related to Exchange of Information to accepted international standards.

The India–Singapore double taxation avoidance agreement at present provides for residence based taxation of capital gains of shares in a company. The Third Protocol amends the agreement with effect from 1 April 2017 to provide for source based taxation of capital gains arising on transfer of shares in a company. This will curb revenue loss, prevent double non-taxation and streamline the flow of investments. In order to provide certainty to investors, investments in shares made before 1 April 2017 have been grandfathered subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause as per 2005 Protocol. Further, a two-year transition period from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2019 has been provided during which capital gains on shares will be taxed in source country at half of normal tax rate, subject to fulfillment of conditions in Limitation of Benefits clause.

The Third Protocol also inserts provisions to facilitate relieving of economic double taxation in transfer pricing cases. This is a taxpayer friendly measure and is in line with India&#x27;s commitments under Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan to meet the minimum standard of providing Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP) access in transfer pricing cases. The Third Protocol also enables application of domestic law and measures concerning prevention of tax avoidance or tax evasion. Singapore&#x27;s investment of $5.98 billion has over taken Mauritius&#x27;s investment of $4.85 billion as the single largest investor for the year 2013–14.

==Australia==
In principle, an Australian resident is taxed on their worldwide income, while a non-resident is taxed only on Australian-sourced income. Both legs of the principle may give raise to taxation in more than one jurisdiction. To avoid double taxation of income by different jurisdictions, Australia has entered into double taxation avoidance agreements (DTAs) with a number of other countries, under which both countries agree on which taxes will be paid to which country.

For example, the DTA with the United States provides that, in the case of royalties, the US will tax Australian residents at the rate of 5%, and Australia will tax it at normal Australian rates (i.e., 30% for companies) but give a credit for the 5% already paid. For Australian residents, this results in the same liability as if the royalties had been earned in Australia, while the US retains the 5% credit.

==United States==

===U.S. citizens and resident aliens abroad===
In principle, United States citizens are liable to tax on their worldwide earnings, wherever they reside. However, some measures mitigate the resulting double tax liability. An individual who is a bona fide resident of a foreign country or is physically outside the United States for an extended time is entitled to an exclusion (exemption) of part or all of his earned income, i.e. personal service income, as distinguished from income from capital or investments. (See IRS form 2555.) If some income is not covered by this exclusion, foreign taxes paid on it can be claimed as a credit.

=== Double taxation within the United States ===
Double taxation can also happen within a single country. This typically happens when sub-national jurisdictions have taxation powers, and jurisdictions have competing claims. In the United States a person may legally have only a single domicile. However, when a person dies different states may each claim that the person was domiciled in that state. Intangible personal property may then be taxed by each state making a claim. In the absence of specific laws prohibiting multiple taxation, and as long as the total of taxes does not exceed 100% of the value of the tangible personal property, the courts will allow such multiple taxation.

Also, since each state makes its own rules on who is a resident for tax purposes, someone may be subject to the claims by two states on his or her income. For example, if someone&#x27;s legal/permanent domicile is in state A, which considers only permanent domicile to which one returns for residency but he or she spends seven months of the year (say April–October) in state B where anyone who is there longer than six months is considered a part-year resident, that person will then owe taxes to both states on money earned in state B. College or university students may also be subject to claims of more than one state, generally if they leave their original state to attend school, and the second state considers students to be residents for tax purposes. In some cases one state will give a credit for taxes paid to another state, but not always.

===Taxation of corporate dividends===
In the US, the term &quot;double taxation&quot; is sometimes used to refer to dividend taxation. This situation arises when corporate profits are considered to have been taxed twice: first when earned by the corporation (corporation tax) and again when the profits are distributed to shareholders or stockholders as a dividend or other distribution (dividend tax).

==China==
In recent years, the development of overseas investment of Chinese enterprises is growing rapidly and has become rather influential. Thus, dealing with cross-border taxation matters turns into one of the significant financial and trade projects of China, and the problems of cross-border taxation is still increasing. In order to solve the problems, the multilateral tax treaties between countries, which can provide legal support to help enterprises from both sides with double taxation avoidance and tax issues solutions, are established. To fulfill the &quot;going global&quot; strategy of China and support the domestic enterprises to adapt to the globalization situation, China has been making efforts on promoting and signing multilateral tax treaties with other countries to achieve mutual interests. By the end of November 2016, China has officially signed 102 double taxation avoidance agreements. Out of which 98 agreements have already entered into force.

In addition, China signed double taxation avoidance arrangement with Hong Kong and Macau Special Administrative Region. China also signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Taiwan in August 2015, which has not entered into force yet. According to the Chinese State Administration of Taxation, the first double taxation avoidance agreement was signed with Japan in September 1983. The latest agreement was signed with Cambodia in October 2016. As for the situation of state disruption, China would continue the signed agreement after the disruption. For example, China first signed double taxation avoidance agreement with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic in June 1987. In 1990, Czechoslovakia divided into two countries, Czech Republic and Slovakia Republic, and the initial agreement signed with Czechoslovakia Socialist Republic was continually used in two new countries. In August 2009, China signed the new agreement with Czech Republic. And when it comes to the special case of Germany, China continued using the agreement with The Federal Republic of Germany after two Germanys reunited. China have signed double taxation avoidance agreement with many countries. Among them, there are not only countries which have made large investment in China, but also countries which as well-relationship recipient of Chinese investment. As for the agreement quantity, China is now next only to United Kingdom. For those countries which have not signed the double taxation avoidance agreements with China, some of them signed information exchange agreements with China.

There are mainly four effects of signing Double Taxation Avoidance agreement.

1. Eliminate the double taxation, decrease the tax cost of &quot;going global&quot; enterprises.

2. Increase the certainty of taxation, decrease the risk of cross-border taxation

3. Decrease the tax burden of &quot;going global&quot; enterprises in the host country, improve the competitiveness of those enterprises.

4. When taxation disputes occur, the agreements can provide bidirectional consultation mechanism, solve the existed disputed problems.

Under general conditions, the tax rate under tax treaty is often lower than the domestic tax rate under the law of host country. Take Russia as an example, in Russia, the standard withholding tax rate of interest and royalty under domestic law is both 20%. According to the newest tax treaty China signed with Russia, the withholding tax rate of interest is 0 and the withholding tax rate of royalty is 6%. This can obviously reduce the tax cost of enterprises, increase the willing of &quot;going global&quot; and the competitiveness of domestic enterprises, and bring the goodness.

<doc id="1152029" wikidata="Q2928449" url="?curid=1152029" title="Burfjord">
<text>, , or is a village in Kvænangen Municipality in Troms county, Norway. The village is the administrative centre of the municipality, thus it is where the municipal offices are located and where the municipal council meets. The village has a population (2023) of 390 and a population density of . 

The services of Burfjord include a bank, a post office, a gas station, a medical office, a nursing home, a dentist, a primary school, grocery shops, and Burfjord Church. Burfjord&#x27;s residents are composed of a mix of indigenous Sami people, Kven people, and ethnic Norwegians. Sami tourist shops selling handicrafts are located all around the village.

== Geography==
Burfjord lies on the northern border of Troms County, along the busy European route E6 highway that winds its way through this part of Northern Norway. The village is located at the end of the Burfjorden, an arm of the Kvænangen fjord. It is about straight west of the town of Alta and the Alta Airport.

== History ==
Burfjord&#x27;s growth as a town is relatively recent. Prior to 1500, the Kvænangen region was almost entirely inhabited by indigenous Sami peoples, who at some point left the traditional nomadic life of reindeer herding atop the mountain plateau and settled to fish and farm as &quot;sjøsame&quot; (sea-Sami). The first scouts northward from Trondheim found no southern Norwegians living in or around the area. During the early 18th century, Burfjord and the larger Kvænangen region became inhabited by Norwegians from the south who plied their trade fishing and farming, as well by the Kven people and Finns who emigrated from the east. Despite the Kvæns remaining a minority, population-wise, they nevertheless gave Kvænangen its namesake. Kvænangen was originally part of the Skjærvøy parish in northern Troms county. Kvænangen became a separate sub-parish in 1861. It was in the 19th century that Burfjord grew in size and became a more urban village area. Due to its geographically central location, it was chosen as the administrative centre of Kvæanangen Municipality.

<text>The Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel (MMMBT) is the Hampton Roads crossing for Interstate 664 (I-664) in the southeastern portion of Virginia in the United States. It is a four-lane bridge–tunnel composed of bridges, trestles, artificial islands, and tunnels under a portion of the Hampton Roads harbor where the mouths of the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth rivers come together.

It connects the independent cities of Newport News on the Virginia Peninsula and Suffolk in South Hampton Roads and is part of the Hampton Roads Beltway, a circumferential Interstate Highway which links the seven largest cities of Hampton Roads.

The MMMBT, completed in 1992, provided a third major vehicle crossing of the Hampton Roads harbor area, supplementing the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel which carries I-64 between the independent cities of Hampton and Norfolk (1957), and the James River Bridge connecting the independent city of Newport News and Isle of Wight County in the South Hampton Roads region (1928).

The MMMBT cost $400 million to build, and it includes a four-lane tunnel that is long, two artificial portal islands, and of twin trestle.

==Battle of Hampton Roads==

The MMMBT is named for the two ironclad warships which engaged in the famous Battle of Hampton Roads on March 8–9, 1862, during the US Civil War. The battle took place between and . The latter ship had been rebuilt from the wreck of . The site of the battle was within of the bridge–tunnel structure named by the Commonwealth of Virginia as a memorial.

<text>The Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel (HRBT) is a Hampton Roads crossing for Interstate 64 (I-64) and US Route 60 (US 60). It is a four-lane facility comprising bridges, trestles, artificial islands, and tunnels under the main shipping channels for Hampton Roads harbor in the southeastern portion of Virginia in the United States.

It connects the historic Phoebus area of the independent city of Hampton near Fort Monroe on the Virginia Peninsula with Willoughby Spit in the city of Norfolk in South Hampton Roads and is part of the Hampton Roads Beltway.

==History and design==
Prior to the opening of the HRBT (and well before even the HRBT&#x27;s counterpart the Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel, or MMMBT), the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) operated ferries to carry vehicle traffic across the harbor from the Southside to the peninsula. There were two routes: one from Hampton Boulevard near Naval Station Norfolk to downtown Newport News, and a second, less popular route from Willoughby Spit to Fort Monroe in Hampton. Traffic at the time was typically about 2500 vehicles per day. The original two-lane structure opened November 1, 1957, at a cost of $44 million (equivalent to $ in ) as a toll facility. The tunnel Norfolk to Hampton had a clearance of .. VDOT currently has identified new systems to improve the overheight detection system, by detecting vehicles well in advance of the tunnel to cut down on the over heights approaching the tunnel, This project is estimated to cost the state $900,000.

The HRBT had two lanes each way, on separately built bridge–tunnel structures. The bridge–tunnel was originally signed as State Route 168 (SR 168) and US 60. It later received the I-64 designation when the second span opened in 1976, and, much later, SR 168 was truncated south of the crossing. The centerline of the HRBT tunnels crosses a naturally deep channel ranging from deep and wide, with water only deep between the edge of the deep channel and each shore.

The HRBT includes two artificial islands for the tunnel portals, where Hampton Roads flows into Chesapeake Bay. The south portal island is about north of Willoughby Spit. It is connected by an earthen causeway to Rip Raps, a artificial island to the northeast, built in 1817 as part of the harbor defenses.

The north portal island is about west of Old Point Comfort. However, the northern bridge section of the HRBT runs north to the mainland of Hampton.
Given its proximity to the US Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet home base at Naval Station Norfolk, many nearby shipyards and critical port facilities, the HRBT design incorporates a tunnel instead of a more cost effective drawbridge. A bridge–tunnel, if destroyed in wartime or due to natural disaster, would not block the vital shipping channels.

Another four-lane facility, the MMMBT was completed in 1992. The MMMBT provided a second bridge–tunnel crossing of the Hampton Roads harbor, supplementing the HRBT and providing some traffic relief. The MMMBT also forms part of the Hampton Roads Beltway. 

===Widening to four lanes===

A second bridge-tunnel was necessary with the construction of I-64 in the area. Work on this expansion began in 1972, and it was opened on November 1, 1976, the nineteenth anniversary of the first structures completion. The old bridge-tunnel was subsequently closed for renovations and reopened in 1977. With this, the crossing was a four lane, toll free facility, thus netting Interstate Highway standards.

===Over-height vehicles===

The current westbound tunnel from Norfolk to Hampton is the original tunnel constructed in 1957 and has a lower clearance than the eastbound tube, as it is in comparison to . Because of this, special over-height detectors have been installed near the Willoughby Spit end of the bridge alerting the truck driver to stop at the inspection station for a more precise measurement of the truck&#x27;s height. If a truck driver ignores this alert or for whatever reason does not stop at the inspection station, VDOT personnel at the tunnel will be alerted and the truck will be alerted and flagged to stop prior to the tunnel entrance, where a fine up to $2,500 may be assessed if the over height occurs during rush hour. This is because any vehicle turnaround at the tunnel requires a full-stoppage of traffic in both directions in order to redirect the affected vehicle from one side of the bridge–tunnel to the other. VDOT currently has identified new systems to improve the overheight detection system, by detecting vehicles well in advance of the tunnel to cut down on the over heights approaching the tunnel, This project is estimated to cost the state $900,000.

===July 2009 flood===
In July 2009, the westbound tube partially flooded after a thunderstorm hit the Hampton Roads region. The flooding was caused by a failed water main, which burst and led a chamber below the tunnel roadway to fill with millions of gallons of water. Pumps designed to remove water from the chamber were overwhelmed, and water began to puddle on the roadway, forcing VDOT to close the tunnel for nearly seven hours during midday on July 2, 2009.

This closure forced hundreds of thousands of commuters, tourists, as well as Hampton Roads residents heading westbound for the Fourth of July holiday, to divert and go through the MMMBT or the James River Bridge, the only alternate routes to get to the peninsula. The MMMBT had troubles of its own during the afternoon, as a multiple-vehicle collision shut down the northbound lanes, closing the tunnel and causing a traffic jam along I-664. The James River Bridge was also closed on July 2 because of downed wires from the storm. The series of events involving all three water crossings led to a &quot;perfect storm&quot; of traffic which led to gridlock throughout all major arteries of Hampton Roads.

The flooding of the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel caused widespread concern about evacuation capabilities of the region during the approach of a hurricane, as the HRBT, MMMBT, and the James River Bridge serve as the primary hurricane evacuation routes for residents of Virginia Beach, Portsmouth, Norfolk, and Chesapeake.

===July 2016 vehicle crash and fire===
At 7:30 pm on July 16, 2016, a two-car collision between a Volkswagen Passat and an Acura occurred three-quarters of the way inside the eastbound tunnel, which travels from Hampton to Norfolk. The Acura was struck from the rear by the Passat; both vehicles burst into flames and filled the tunnel with smoke, leaving 35 vehicles stuck inside the tunnel behind the scene. Because neither of the tunnels have escape walkways, 80 drivers and passengers were required to walk out of the tunnel through the smoke, leaving their vehicles behind. While four others were taken to the hospital, 15 people were treated on the scene for smoke inhalation. The fires caused moderate to major damage to the walls of the tunnel, which VDOT repaired through nightly road work at the tunnel.

The crash shut down traffic in both directions for four hours, finally reopening westbound at 11:00 pm, and reopening eastbound at 11:45 pm. The driver of the Passat was cited with following too closely by Virginia State Police.

===Widening to eight lanes===

According to Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), in 1958, an average of 6,000 vehicles a day used the facility whereas an average of 88,000 vehicles a day were using the crossing in 2008, with volumes exceeding 100,000 during the tourist season, well exceeding the original design capacity of 77,000 vehicles per day, which sparked decades of debate on how to improve traffic flow at the region&#x27;s most important water crossing. Studies into the growing traffic at the HRBT have roots back to the early 1990s. In 1992, the Virginia General Assembly had requested that VDOT study growing traffic at the HRBT. The conclusion of that study determined that a long-term large-scale solution to the problem would be required to alleviate backups. For the next 14 years, VDOT would undertake numerous studies in 1999, 2008, 2012, and 2016 to help choose a candidate build that was financially and physically feasible to build.

After nearly two decades of studies and planning, the Commonwealth Transportation Board, and the two regional boards responsible for the project (Hampton Roads Transportation Accountability Commission/HRTPO) voted unanimously in 2016 to a $3.3-billion expansion of the current bridge–tunnel and its approaches from four lanes total to four lanes in both directions from the I-664 interchange to the I-564 interchange, with two new, two lane bridge–tunnels built to carry traffic eastbound (Hampton to Norfolk). A final environmental impact study was published in May 2017, and the record of decision from the FHWA was granted in June. On October 29, 2020, a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Hampton for the project. It was expected to be completed by November 2025 but this was later changed to 2027. 
On April 17, 2024, a 430-foot-long boring machine broke through a concrete-lined pit on North Island, finishing the outline of the new westbound tunnel.
