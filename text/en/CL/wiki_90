<doc id="1186840" wikidata="Q573538" url="?curid=1186840" title="Regulation of therapeutic goods">
<text>The regulation of therapeutic goods, defined as drugs and therapeutic devices, varies by jurisdiction. In some countries, such as the United States, they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions they are regulated at the state level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as in Australia.

The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be sold. There is usually some degree of restriction on the availability of certain therapeutic goods, depending on their risk to consumers.

== History ==
Modern drug regulation has historical roots in the response to the proliferation of universal antidotes which appeared in the wake of Mithridates&#x27; death. Mithridates had brought together physicians, scientists, and shamans to concoct a potion that would make him immune to poisons. Following his death, the Romans became keen on further developing the Mithridates potion&#x27;s recipe. Mithridatium re-entered western society through multiple means. The first was through the &quot;Leechbook of the Bald&quot; (&quot;Bald&#x27;s Leechbook&quot;), written somewhere between 900 and 950, which contained a formula for various remedies, including for a theriac. Additionally, theriac became a commercial good traded throughout Europe based on the works of Greek and Roman physicians.

The resulting proliferation of various recipes needed to be curtailed in order to ensure that people were not passing off fake antidotes, which led to the development of government involvement and regulation. Additionally, the creation of these concoctions took on ritualistic form and were often created in public and the process was observed and recorded. It was believed that if the concoction proved unsuccessful, it was due to the apothecaries&#x27; process of making them and they could be held accountable because of the public nature of the creation.

In the ninth century, many Muslim countries established an office of the &quot;hisba&quot;, which in addition to regulating compliance to Islamic principles and values took on the role of regulating other aspects of social and economic life, including the regulation of medicines. Inspectors were appointed to employ oversight on those who were involved in the process of medicine creation and were given a lot of leeway to ensure compliance and punishments were stringent. The first official &#x27;act&#x27;, the &#x27;Apothecary Wares, Drugs and Stuffs&#x27; Act (also sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Pharmacy Wares, Drugs and Stuffs&#x27; Act) was passed in 1540 by Henry VIII and set the foundation for others. Through this act, he encouraged physicians in his &quot;College of Physicians&quot; (founded by him in 1518) to appoint four people dedicated to consistently inspecting what was being sold in apothecary shops. In conjunction with this first piece of legislation, there was an emergence of standard formulas for the creation of certain &#x27;drugs&#x27; and &#x27;antidotes&#x27; through Pharmacopoeias which first appeared in the form of a decree from Frederick II of Sicily in 1240 to use consistent and standard formulas. The first modern pharmacopoeias were the Florence Pharmacopoeia published in 1498, the Spanish Pharmacopoeia published in 1581 and the London Pharmacopoeia published in 1618.

Various other events throughout history have demonstrated the importance of drug and medicine regulation keeping up with scientific advances. In 2006, the challenges associated with TGN 1412 highlighted the shortcomings of animal models and paved the way for further advances in regulation and development for biological products. Rofecoxib represents a drug that was on the market that had not clearly represent the risks associated with the use drug which led to the concept of &#x27;risk management planning&#x27; within the field of regulation by introducing the need to understand how various safety concerns would be managed. Various cases over recent years have demonstrated the need for regulation to keep up with scientific advances that have implications for people&#x27;s health.

===United States===
In the United States, regulation of drugs was originally a state right, as opposed to federal right. But with the increase in fraudulent practices due to private incentives to maximize profits and poor enforcement of state laws, the need for stronger federal regulation increased. In 1906 President Roosevelt signed the Federal Food and Drug Act (FFDA) which both established stricter national standards for drug manufacture and sales, and also established the Federal government as the regulating authority over the US drug industry. A 1911 Supreme Court decision, &quot;United States vs. Johnson&quot;, established that misleading statements were not covered under the FFDA. This directly led to Congress passing the Sherley Amendment which established a clearer definition of &#x27;drug marketing requirements&#x27;.

More catalysts for advances in drug regulation in the US were certain catastrophes that served as calls to the US government to step in and impose regulations that would prevent repeats of those instances. One such instance occurred in 1937 when more than a hundred people died from using sulfanilamide elixir which had not gone through any safety testing. This directly led to the passing of the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1938. One other major catastrophe occurred in the late 1950s when Thalidomide, which was originally sold in Germany (introduced into a virtually unregulated market) and eventually sold around the world, led to approximately 100,000 babies being born with various deformities. In 1962 the United States Congress passed the Drug Amendments Act of 1962. The Drug Amendments Act required the FDA to ensure that new drugs being introduced to the market had passed certain tests and standards.

===United Kingdom===
The UK&#x27;s Chief Medical Officer had established a group to look into safety of drugs on the market in 1959 prior to the crisis and was moving in the direction of address the problem of unregulated drugs entering the market. The crisis created a greater sense of emergency to establish safety and efficacy standards around the world. The UK started a temporary Committee on Safety of Drugs while they attempted to pass more comprehensive legislation. Though compliance and submission of drugs to the Committee on Safety of Drugs was not mandatory immediately after, the pharmaceutical industry later complied due to the thalidomide situation.

===European Economic Union===
The European Economic Commission also passed a directive in 1965 in order to impose greater efficacy standards before marketing a drug. Drug legislation in both the EU and US were passed in order to assure drug safety and efficacy. Of note, increased regulations and standards for testing actually led to greater innovation in pharmaceutical research in the 1960s, despite greater preclinical and clinical standards. In 1989, the International Conference of Drug Regulatory Authorities organized by the WHO, officials from around the world discussed the necessity for streamlined processes for global drug approval.

==Regulatory authorities and key legislation by country==

===Australia===
Therapeutic goods in Australia are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which is a regulatory body of the Commonwealth Department of Health. Access to medicines and poisons is regulated by the separation of substances into various schedules according to the Therapeutic Goods (Poisons Standard) Instrument, the Poisons Standard may also be cited as the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP).

The Poisons Standard organises substances into 10 schedules (and unscheduled substances), therapeutic goods are generally organised only into schedules 2, 3, 4 and 8:
* unscheduled substances: unscheduled substances are available for purchase at any retailer.
* schedule 1 (S1) - Blank: this schedule is left intentionally blank.
* schedule 2 (S2) - Pharmacy medicines: substances in schedule 2 are only available for purchase in a pharmacy or other licensed retailer.
* schedule 3 (S3) - Pharmacist only medicines: substances in schedule 3 are only available for purchase in a pharmacy and a pharmacist must be involved in the sale of the medicine.
* schedule 4 (S4) - Prescription only medicines and prescription animal remedies: substances in schedule 4 are only available with a prescription from a prescriber (medical practitioners, dentists, nurse practitioners, endorsed physiotherapists and podiatrists) and must be purchased at a pharmacy.
* schedule 5 (S5) - Caution
* schedule 6 (S6) - Poisons
* schedule 7 (S7) - Dangerous Poisons
* schedule 8 (S8) - Controlled drugs: substances in schedule 8 are generally drugs of addiction or dependence and are only available with a prescription from an authorised prescriber, they must be purchased at a pharmacy. Schedule 8 medicines have additional controls on their storage, supply, possession, destruction and prescription compared to schedule 4 substances.
* schedule 9 (S9) - Prohibited substances
* schedule 10 (S10) - Substances of such danger to health as to warrant prohibition of supply and use

===Brazil===

Therapeutic goods in Brazil are regulated by the Ministry of Health of Brazil, through its Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (Anvisa), equivalent to the US Food and Drug Administration. There are six main categories:
* Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines (&quot;medicamentos isentos de prescrição&quot; or &quot;MIPs&quot; in Portuguese): cough, cold and fever medicines, antiseptics, vitamins and others. Sold freely in pharmacies.
* Red stripe medicines: sold only with medical prescription. Anti-allergenics, anti-inflammatories, and other medicines.
* Red stripe antibiotics: antibiotics are sold only with a &quot;special control&quot; white medical prescription with patient&#x27;s copy, which is valid for 10 days. The original must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale and the patient keeps the copy.
* Red stripe psychoactive medicines: sold only with a &quot;special control&quot; white medical prescription with patient&#x27;s copy, which is valid for 30 days. The original must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale and the patient keeps the copy. Drugs include anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, some sleep aids, anti-psychotics and other non-habit-inducing controlled medicines. Though some consider them habit inducing, anabolic steroids are also regulated under this category.
* Black stripe medicines: sold only with the &quot;blue B form&quot; medical prescription, which is valid for 30 days and must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale. Includes sedatives (benzodiazepines), some anorexic inducers and other habit-inducing controlled medicines.
* &quot;Yellow A form&quot; prescription medicines: sold only with the &quot;yellow A form&quot; medical prescription - the most tightly controlled, which is valid for 30 days and must be retained by the pharmacist after the sale. Includes amphetamines and other stimulants (such as methylphenidate), opioids (such as morphine and oxycodone) and other strong habit-forming controlled medicines.

Biological medications are complex molecules of high molecular weight obtained from a biological source or biotechnological procedures and are divided by Anvisa into the following categories:
* Allergens: substances from animals or plants that can induce an IgE response or a type I hypersensitivity reaction
* Monoclonal antibodies: immunoglobulins derived from the same B lymphocyte clone, propagated in continuous cell lines
* Biomedicines: obtained from biological fluids or tissues of animal origin or through biotechnological procedures
* Blood derivatives: obtained from human plasma, subjected to industrialization and standardization processes
* Probiotics: preparations containing viable microorganisms in sufficient quantity to change the microbiota
* Vaccines: immunobiological medications that contain one or more antigenic substances capable of inducing immunity to protect against disease, reduce its severity or fight it

The regulatory status of vaccines, which determines their marketing and distribution, may be one of the following established by Anvisa:
* Sanitary vaccine registration: definitive, for approved drugs
* Temporary emergency use authorization: similar to a US Emergency Use Authorization
* Exceptional import authorization
* COVAX Facility: temporarily lifts the requirement of registration or emergency use authorization for vaccines purchased by the Ministry of Health that are under the Emergency Use Listing of the World Health Organization

Vaccines can only be administered in public health centers or authorized private vaccination services.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, regulation of therapeutic goods is done by Health Canada and governed by the Food and Drug Act and associated regulations. In addition, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act specifies additional regulatory requirements for controlled drugs and drug precursors.

In Ontario, the Drug and Pharmacies Regulation Act governs &quot;any substance that is used in the diagnosis, treatment, mitigation or prevention of a disease...in humans, animals or fowl.&quot;

===China===
The regulation of drugs in China is governed by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) which replaced the former China Food and Drug Administration.

===European Union===
The European Union (EU) medicines regulatory system is based on a network of around 50 regulatory authorities from the 31 EEA countries (28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), the European Commission and European Medicines Agency (EMA). EMA and the Member States cooperate and share expertise in the assessment of new medicines and of new safety information. They also rely on each other for exchange of information in the regulation of medicine, for example regarding the reporting of side effects of medicines, the oversight of clinical trials, and the conduct of inspections of medicines&#x27; manufacturers and compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), good manufacturing practice (GMP), good distribution practice (GDP), and good pharmacovigilance practice (GVP). EU legislation requires that each Member State operates to the same rules and requirements regarding the authorisation and monitoring of medicines.

Within the EU, EudraLex maintains the collection of rules and regulations governing medicinal products in the European Union, and the European Medicines Agency acts to regulate many of these rules and regulations. Amongst these rules and regulations are:
* Directive 65/65/EEC1, requires prior approval for marketing of proprietary medicinal products
* Directive 75/318/EEC, clarifies requirements of 65/65/EEC1 and requires member states to enforce them
* Directive 75/319/EEC, requires marketing authorization requests to be drawn up only by qualified experts
* Directive 93/41/EEC, establishes the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products
* Directive 2001/20/EC, defines rules for the conduct of clinical trials
* Directive 2001/83/EC
* Directive 2005/28/EC, defines Good Clinical Practice for design and conduct of clinical trials

<text>Popular Unity Movement (Mouvement d&#x27;Unité Populaire, MUP) is a socialist political party in Tunisia.

The MUP was formed by Ahmed Ben Salah in Swiss exile in 1973. Ben Salah was a trade unionist (Tunisian General Labour Union, UGTT) who had been a member of the ruling Socialist Destourian Party (PSD) and minister of economic planning in the government of Habib Bourguiba. In this role, he pursued a communitarian socialist policy, aiming for a more unified and enlightened society by the means of a strong government. Ben Salah was made responsible for the economic failure of the late 1960s, dropped from the government, expelled from the PSD and sentenced to 10 years of forced labour in 1970. He escaped from prison in 1973 and fled abroad. His new party gathered intellectuals and Tunisian expatriates living in Europe. In 1977, it published a &quot;Charter of Democratic and Popular Liberties&quot; which had great influence on the political debate in Tunisia. However, the party remained illegal. When the more reformist Mohammed Mzali became Prime Minister, he allowed oppositional parties to run candidates&#x27; lists in elections and announced to officially recognize them in case they won more than five percent. However, the government rigged the elections and the MUP received, according to official results, less than 1 percent. Ben Salah therefore announced to boycott further elections. A more moderate faction which disagreed with Ben Salah, broke away in 1981 and formed the Popular Unity Party (PUP), which gained official recognition in 1983.

After the Tunisian revolution 2011, the MUP was finally legalised. But in the following election for the Constituent Assembly it failed to win any seats.

<text>John Geoffrey Hilton (born 13 October 1947) is an Australian politician. He was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 2002 to 2006, representing Western Port Province.

Hilton was born in St. Helens in the United Kingdom, and studied at the University of Aberdeen and Hull University. He was employed as an accountant after graduating, but moved into consultancy in the late 1970s, first as a management consultant, and then moving to executive recruitment.

In 2002, Hilton won Labor preselection to contest the new seat of Western Port Province. The seat had replaced the generally safe Liberal seat of South Eastern Province, and been made safer for the Liberal Party in the ensuing redistribution. Amidst the landslide Labor victory at the 2002 state election, Hilton defeated strong favourite and incumbent South Eastern Province Liberal MLC Cameron Boardman on preferences.

During his term in parliament, the Labor government passed sweeping electoral reforms of the Legislative Council which, amongst other changes, reduced the number of members. Hilton was one of the members unable to secure Labor preselection for a seat in the reformed chamber, and he subsequently chose to retire at the conclusion of his term.

He is a supporter of Melbourne rugby league team the Melbourne Storm.

<text>Victoria School (VS) is a government autonomous boys&#x27; secondary school in Siglap, Singapore. The school has a hostel. Established in 1876, it is Singapore&#x27;s second oldest state secondary school.

It offers a six-year Integrated Programme.This allows students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and proceed to Victoria Junior College for Years 5 and 6. The Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations are taken at the end of Year 6.

==History==
===Kampong Glam: 1876-1900===
Victoria School began in 1876 as an English class for 12 Malay boys at Kampong Glam Malay Branch School. The first headmaster was Y. A. Yzelman.

===Syed Alwi: 1900-1933===
In 1900, Kampong Glam Malay Branch School merged with Kampong Glam Malay School and moved to Syed Alwi Road near the Victoria Bridge, so the school was renamed Victoria Bridge School. At the time, it was a feeder school for secondary schools, including Raffles Institution, then the only government secondary school in Singapore. In 1909, Victoria Bridge School added classes for Standard Five to alleviate the enrolment pressure at Raffles Institution. In 1931, it became the second government secondary school in Singapore.

Many students left school at age 13 so from 1930 to 1952, the school operated an afternoon session for continuing education. The school uniform was introduced by 1929, and a school library was opened in December 1929 with the aid of businessman Syed Ahmed bin Mohamed Alsagoff. During this period, school games were formalised, with the first annual sports meet being held in 1915. The first annual Speech Day was held in 1916 and the first annual academic prizes were awarded. The house system was instituted in 1929 while the house prefect system began in 1930. The first Boy Scouts troop was formed in 1919,

When Victoria Bridge School was at Syed Alwi Road, the school had a recommended maximum enrolment of 560. However, by 1925, it had 705 students. Victoria Bridge School&#x27;s campus at Syed Alwi Road is depicted on the back of the S$2 banknote in the current series.

===Tyrwhitt Road: 1933–1984===
In 1933, Victoria Bridge School moved to Tyrwhitt Road and changed its name to its current name, Victoria School. In 1935, the primary classes were phased out and the school became a district secondary school. The school motto, &quot;Nil Sine Labore&quot; (Latin for &quot;nothing without labour&quot;), was adopted before World War II.

During the Japanese occupation of Singapore between 1942 and 1945, Victoria School continued operating as a Japanese school called Jalan Besar Boys&#x27; School. Following the end of the war, Victoria School reopened with 16 pupils on 1 October 1945 as one of the first schools in Singapore to resume classes. It was housed at the Kampong Glam Malay School site until May 1946 since the Tyrwhitt Road building was used as a hospital. Under the headmaster R. F. Bomford&#x27;s leadership, a science block was constructed for the school. At the time, Victoria School had the best school laboratories in Singapore, attracting students from Raffles Girls&#x27; School and St. Andrew&#x27;s School to take science lessons at Victoria School. It was also selected as Singapore&#x27;s pioneer school for audio-visual education.

Post-School Certificate (now the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level) classes began in 1951 and included the first girls to attend the school. In 1955, the school achieved the best results in Singapore in the examinations for the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate (present-day Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level), with a 99.5% pass rate. In 1957, it had the best results in Singapore for the University Entrance Examinations. In 1969, after Singapore introduced the junior college system, Victoria School started offering three-year pre-university courses in 1979.

The school building was designed by Frank Dorrington Ward, the chief architect of the Public Works Department who also designed the Supreme Court Building and other prominent landmarks in Singapore. It was upgraded in 1966 and gazetted for conservation by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) in 2007. It is one of the few early city-centre schools still in existence and features two school buildings from the pre- and post-war period on a single site. The hall-and-canteen block is the only known school hall left of this style and configuration in Singapore. The site was awarded the URA Heritage Award in 2009. It is a marked-out historical landmark of the Jalan Besar Heritage Trail. It became the headquarters of the People&#x27;s Association in 2010.

===Geylang Bahru: 1984–2003===
In 1984, Victoria School moved to 3 Geylang Bahru Lane. The new site&#x27;s move was marked with a 2.3  km march by 1,500 present and former students, teachers, and principals from Tyrwhitt Road, led by Abbas Abu Amin, Member of Parliament for Pasir Panjang GRC who was an alumnus of Victoria School. Students preferred the junior colleges to the pre-university programme, so Victoria Junior College was established that year as a separate institution and the school ended its pre-university intake, with the last group of students sitting for the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations in November 1985.

The school began offering the Art Elective Programme in 1985 and set up its first computer laboratory in 1986. The first Victoria Challenge was inaugurated in 1987, and the Victorian Profile began in 1991.

In 1989, Victoria School was a small number of schools chosen to receive overseas scholars from the ASEAN countries. After the introduction of national ranking by the Ministry of Education in 1992, the school placed in the top ten in four years of that decade. The school became the seventh Gifted Education Programme centre in 2001 and hosted the programme until 2005.

Single-session schooling began in 1992 after the extension of the school building the previous year. The school opted to remain a government school and not become independent; it was selected to become one of the first six autonomous schools in 1994.

===Siglap Link: 2003–present===
The campus at Siglap Link off Marine Parade Road opened in 2003, incorporating a hostel. It was designed on ecological principles to reflect the school&#x27;s values, with roofs curved like an open book and the school centred on the library. At its opening, it had the largest government secondary school library in Singapore. The campus was selected to participate at the 9th International Architecture Exhibition in Venice. The ceremonial procession to the new campus was attended by President S. R. Nathan, who was an alumnus of Victoria School.

In 2008, Victoria School became the first school in Singapore to offer Physical Education as a subject examinable at the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level. It also became one of the first four secondary schools to offer the Regional Studies Programme, and the only one offering Bahasa Indonesia.

The school began offering the six-year Integrated Programme through the Victoria-Cedar Alliance, together with Cedar Girls&#x27; Secondary School and Victoria Junior College, in 2012.

==Campus and facilities==
The Victoria School campus covers . Between the classroom block and the science block, the &quot;Eco-Street,&quot; planted with tropical vegetation and houses fish and turtles, forms a central artery providing natural light and ventilation to the classrooms and a setting for outdoor learning. The Victoria Pool, Learning Garden, Bio Pod, and Exploration Patch represent a move away from rigidly-structured, classroom-based instruction.

The ground-level classrooms, known as Learning Studios (consisting of the Gentlemen, Professional, and Sportsmen rooms), are air-conditioned and have sliding doors that open out to the landscape. Some classrooms on the upper floors have balconies, which were originally intended to take advantage of the sea view, but these are closed for safety reasons, and the Indoor Sports Hall now blocks most of the view.

The school facilities also include a 500-seater auditorium and a three-storey library, of which the third floor is reserved for teachers and contains a collection of teaching resources.

===Victoria Hall===
Victoria Hall is a hostel consisting of two 11-storey blocks (one male and one female) within the school compound. It is next to the sea and East Coast Park, giving boarders both a sea view and access to the park&#x27;s sporting facilities. It houses about 500 boarders of several nationalities, including Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese, many of whom attend either Victoria School or Victoria Junior College. Secondary/Year 3 students also stay at the hostel for six weeks. Three classes attend this programme in Term 1, four classes in Term 2, and three classes in Term 3.

===Sports facilities===
A S$500,000 AstroTurf field replaced the conventional field in early 2007.

The Indoor Sports Hall (ISH) was completed in June 2009. It consists of two storeys, but the building&#x27;s height is approximately four storeys because of the high ceiling.

The school also has an air-rifle range, a tennis and basketball court, a fitness corner, and a gymnasium.

===Computer facilities===
The school is mostly covered by a Wi-Fi network (SWN) provided by the Ministry of Education for the use of teachers and students. There is also another separate Wi-Fi network for the students&#x27; Personal Learning Devices (PLD).

==Culture and tradition==
===Uniform===
The school uniform consists of a white short-sleeved shirt, with either khaki short trousers (for Year 1 and 2 students) or white long trousers (for Year 3 and 4 students). A &#x27;Victoria&#x27; label is sewn on the back pockets of the trousers. Secondary 3 and 4 students wear a black school belt. The school socks are white with the initials &#x27;VS&#x27; in red on both sides, although plain white socks are allowed. Shoes have to be at least 80% white. In 2005, an official &#x27;Victoria School&#x27; shoe with the letters &#x27;VS&#x27; on each side was introduced.

Students wear a maroon striped tie every Monday and on formal occasions, sometimes with a maroon blazer as well. The school badge is worn above the left chest pocket. Student bodies such as the Prefects&#x27; Council and Monitors&#x27; Council have their own badges, but the school crest remains their main feature.

For physical activities and camps, students wear a bright yellow &#x27;bumblebee&#x27; T-shirt with a pair of black shorts and white socks with sports shoes. The word &#x27;VICTORIAN&#x27; is printed on the back of the PE T-shirt.

===House system===
The students are grouped into five houses, namely Glam (red), Kallang (blue), Kapor (green), Rochore (yellow), and Whampoa (purple), which compete against each other in the school&#x27;s annual Sports Day, Cross-Country Championships, Track and Field Championships and during Inter-house games and since 2019, Project APEX. Each house has its own running vest (singlet) in the house colours.

===Victorian Spirit===
The Victorian Spirit is a sense of pride and belonging to the school, a fighting spirit, and striving to be their best.

==Special programmes==
Victoria School offers the Integrated Programme, GCE Ordinary Level Physical Education Programme, Art Elective Programme, Regional Studies Programme, and Higher Mother Tongue Languages in Chinese, Malay, and Tamil. VS students may also enrol in the Music Elective Programme in Secondary Three or a third language (French, German or Japanese). However, these lessons are held at external venues. Students of foreign languages take part in the Ministry of Education Language Centre&#x27;s month-long Study-cum-Immersion Programmes (SCIP) in countries such as France, Germany, and Japan.

===Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme ===
The Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme is a six-year Integrated Programme that allows students to bypass the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and proceed directly to the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of the sixth year. Under this programme, students complete their four-year secondary education in Victoria School before moving to Victoria Junior College for Years 5 and 6 for pre-university education.

Victoria School started offering the Integrated Programme together with Cedar Girls&#x27; Secondary School and Victoria Junior College in 2012, building upon the success of the original four-year Victoria Integrated Programme started by Victoria Junior College in 2005.

===GCE Physical education===
In 2008, Victoria School became the first school in Singapore to offer Physical Education (PE) as an examinable subject at the GCE Ordinary Level after receiving the approval of the Ministry of Education in 2006. The course involves theoretical and practical aspects, including weight training, football, hockey, and cross-country running, among others.

Students take the theory examination at the end of the course (i.e., November of the graduating year). This examination contributes 40% of their overall grade, the other 60% coming from the practical component, assessed over a period of time.

To better acquaint students with the style of GCE Ordinary Level PE lessons, PE theory lessons are also conducted in lower secondary classes as an examinable subject. The selection process for GCE Ordinary Level PE candidates is carried out towards the end of secondary two. Students whose applications have been approved by the PE Department are notified before the subject combination allocation process at the end of the school year.

===Art Elective Programme ===
The Art Elective Programme (AEP) leads to the GCE Ordinary Level Higher Art examination. The AEP is offered to academically good students with talent in art. For lower secondary classes, the AEP class is not entirely made up of AEP students. Usually, about a third of the class will take AEP lessons, while the other two-thirds will have Home Economics or Design &amp; Technology lessons. For upper secondary classes, AEP lessons are conducted after normal school hours.

===Regional Studies Programme ===
Students in the Regional Studies Programme (RSP) learn about Southeast Asian culture and contemporary society. The curriculum includes overseas immersion programmes and structured enrichment modules spread throughout the course. Other schools in Singapore that have the Regional Studies Programme offer Malay as a third language, but since the Singapore Indonesian School is situated opposite Victoria School&#x27;s campus at Siglap, students in the RSP programme take Indonesian as a third language.

===VECTORS===
VECTORS is a school-based talent programme aimed at nurturing students who demonstrate high abilities in mathematics and science. Students are given a wide range of opportunities to learn beyond the curriculum, including enrichment modules at junior colleges, polytechnics and universities, research mentorships, and other institutions.

==Co-curricular activities==
The school offers students 40 co-curricular activities (CCAs) in the four areas of sports, uniformed groups, performing arts, and clubs and societies.

The school holds performing arts and sporting activities, including the biennial Rhapsody, Drama Festival (Dramafest), Musical World, Arts Festival, and Evening of Music and Drama (EMD), the annual Sports Day and Cross-Country Championship.

===Sports===
13 sports are offered in Victoria School: badminton, cricket, cross-country, floorball, football, hockey, sailing, shooting, table-tennis, tennis, track &amp; field, volleyball and wushu. The school also participates in the Inter-School Dragon Boat competition. Between 2009 and 2024, the school won 40 national team titles and 32 zonal team titles at the National Schools Games and achieved a national top-four placing 210 times. VS students have won six Singapore National Olympic Council Best Sportsboy/Team Awards and 23 Singapore Schools Sports Council Best School Boy Awards for sports.

Ten Victorians have represented Singapore at the Olympics - four in hockey, three in athletics, two in sailing and one in water-polo.

===Uniformed groups===
Victoria School has six uniformed groups, four national and two worldwide. They offer Secondary 2-3 students a combined cultural exchange trip overseas to place such as Perth and Hong Kong. All have won the best unit competitions in the 21st century.

* Boys&#x27; Brigade: J M Fraser Award for Excellence - 20th consecutive gold, 2017
* National Police Cadet Corps: NPCC Unit Overall Proficiency Award - 18th consecutive gold, 2017

* Red Cross: Red Cross Youth Excellent Unit Award - 9th consecutive gold, 2016
* National Cadet Corps (Sea): Best Unit Competition - gold, 2016

Scouting was first started in Victoria Bridge School (present day Victoria School) when the 5th Singapore (HQ Malay) Troop was formed on 28 March 1919. The 5th Troop was mentioned in the local newspaper in August 1950, but appears to have been disbanded shortly after. The 6th Troop was founded in 1922, when school-based Scouting was introduced in government schools. In 1932, the 6th Troop was renamed Arrow Scout Group after the Golden Arrow which BP had proclaimed in 1929&#x27;s 3rd World Scout Jamboree as Scouting&#x27;s symbol of peace and goodwill.

===Performing arts===
Victoria School has four performing arts groups.

====Chinese orchestra====
Victoria School Chinese Orchestra is one of the top school Chinese orchestras in Singapore. In the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation, Victoria School Chinese Orchestra has always attained the Certificate of Distinction.

====Choir====
Victoria School Choir is one of the school choirs in Singapore. In the Singapore Youth Festival Choral Judging Competition, the school has always attained a Gold with the Honours award. It has also won gold medals in international choir competitions. In the 2012 National Day Parade, the 300-strong Combined School Choir was formed by students from Victoria School and Cedar Girls&#x27; Secondary School.

===Clubs and societies===
* AV Club
* Photography Club
* Chess Club (consisting of International Chess Club and Chinese Chess Club)
* English Language Drama Club
* Debate and Oratorical society
* Infocomm Club

In &quot;The Straits Times&quot; National Youth Media Competition, Victoria School holds the best record among all the schools in Singapore, clinching the championship twice and runner-up position three times since the competition was inaugurated in 2005.

==Community involvement programmes==

===Youth Day===
On Youth Day, Victoria School boys attempt to &#x27;paint the town yellow&#x27; as they go round nearby housing blocks in the neighbourhood collecting old newspapers and items for disposal. The boys are clad in their yellow PT kit so that they are easily identified.

===President&#x27;s Challenge===
Victoria School participates in the President&#x27;s Challenge every year. In 2004, each class did a specific activity to raise funds for the charity. Activities included washing cars, going door-to-door to do household chores for a donation. In 2005, the school held a watch design competition, and the best designs were made into real watches and put on sale. In 2006, booklets were sold containing art by past and present Victorians.

===Victoria Challenge===
Started in July 1987, the Victoria Challenge, conducted every four years, allows classes to identify tasks that will contribute to the school. The &quot;challenge&quot; itself is for classes to carefully plan their task and pledge to complete it within 24 hours. Special T-shirts have been designed for every Victoria Challenge since its inception. Past challenges have included creating miniature clay figurines, folding 3D origami eagles to hang in the library, drawing floor murals, and creating an &quot;Arts Nook&quot; in the corner of the school, complete with books and a piano. The latest Victoria Challenge was held on 23 June 2023 to 24 June 2023.

==Overseas exchange programmes==
Victoria School has established ties with schools abroad to promote Singaporean education and exchange ideas.

As part of the initiative to improve bilateral education links between Singapore and Malaysia, Victoria School has been linked up with Penang Free School, Malaysia by the Ministry of Education. Other schools with which Victoria School has bilateral exchange programmes include Hebei Baoding Yizhong, English School Attached to Guangdong University of Foreign Studies, Beijing Sanfan Zhongxue and Nan Hai Zhi Xin Zhongxue (all in the People&#x27;s Republic of China), Modern School of Vasant Vihar (India), University of Griffith (Australia) and Sultan Omar Ali Saiffudin High School (Brunei).

==Humanities trips==
Victoria School offers week-long overseas humanities trips to ASEAN and other parts of Asia for secondary 1 to 3 students to increase awareness of other cultures and relate lessons to the real world. These have included a trip to Vietnam in 2019.

==Camps==

===Secondary One bonding camp===
During January, all secondary one Victorians attend a three-day, two-night camp, usually held at the school, where they participate in physical, interactive, and character-building activities designed to help them make new friends and adapt to the new secondary school environment. It is facilitated by some of the secondary three and secondary four seniors.

===Secondary Three overseas adventure camp===
In 2001, Victoria School became the first school in Singapore to send its entire secondary three students to an overseas camp. The camp, which used to be held typically in March, is now held in January concurrently with the secondary one and two cohort camps on Malaysia&#x27;s farmland. The aim is to bond the new secondary three students and help them settle into their new classes after being streamed according to their subject combinations and expose them to life outside the confines of urban Singapore. Also, following the &quot;EDGE&quot; model of the school, the camp aims to &quot;Grow&quot; (Third letter of the acronym) the students into effective leaders as they will take over various leadership roles from the secondary four students. Rigorous activities, including rafting, trekking, river-crossing, and mountain-climbing, are held during the camp. From 2001 to 2010, the camp was held at Kahang Organic Rice Eco-Farm, Kahang town, located near Kluang, Johor. From 2011, the annual camp location was shifted to Tanjong Sutera Resort, Tanjung Sedili, near the town of Kota Tinggi, Johor.

===Victoria Enhanced Leadership/Outdoor Camp Instructor Training Camp (VELOCI-T)===
The VELOCI-T is a 5-day outdoor camp that begins locally and continues overseas. External camp instructors run it in collaboration with selected Secondary Three junior leaders for that year. It has garnered praise for being one of the most difficult and effective leadership camps among local institutions. 100 Secondary Two students, nominated through CCA teachers and who will undertake leadership positions the following year, undergo rugged adventure activities, are trained to run camps, and conduct activities commonly carried out during outdoor camps, and learn the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership through hands-on activities. Trainees have made an expedition on inflatable rafts and kayaks and climbed Gunung Arong. After the camp is concluded, the participants&#x27; performances are reviewed. Those who pass are promoted to Junior Leader (JL) or, upon further application and stringent selection, Senior Leader (SL). The JLs and SLs are informally called Red Shirts and Black Shirts after the shirts are awarded. They form the backbone of student leadership in VS and play an instrumental role in rallying and organising the student population.

==Awards==
In 2009, Victoria School was awarded the Ministry of Education&#x27;s School Distinction Award (SDA).

Victoria School has also attained various CCA awards, such as the Sustained Achievement Awards for sports, performing arts, and uniformed groups in recognition of its consistently high performance in national competitions, sports meets, the biennial Singapore Youth Festival and other events.

==Victoria Advisory Committee==
The Victoria Advisory Committee (VAC), formed in 1968, set the direction and advice on the future of Victoria School and Victoria Junior College. The principals of VS and VJC and the President of the Old Victorians&#x27; Association sit on the committee.

==Victoria Chorale==
Formed in 1988, the chorale comprises Victoria School and Victoria Junior College&#x27;s graduates.

==Old Victorians&#x27; Association==

The alumni body, Old Victorians&#x27; Association (OVA), was established in 1941. It serves as a channel for former students of Victoria School and Victoria Junior College to associate with their alma mater. The OVA supports the schools&#x27; activities, assists needy students, and promotes sports, social and cultural activities among association members. Previously alumni returned on Victorians&#x27; Day, the first Saturday of March, to play games, eat school canteen food again and catch up with long-time schoolmates.

The OVA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s hockey teams play in the Singapore Hockey Federation hockey leagues.

In 2009, OVA organized the inaugural combined VS and VJC gala concert, with a 260-strong cast comprising both students and celebrity alumni, at the Esplanade Concert Hall.

In 2011 and 2016, OVA organized the Victoria School 135th and 140th Anniversary Celebration Dinners at Tyrwhitt Road&#x27;s former VS campus.

<text>Carlos Obed Ortiz Baerga (; ; born November 4, 1968) is a Puerto Rican former Major League Baseball player. Baerga was known for his superb hitting abilities during his first stint with the Cleveland Indians in the early-to-mid-1990s, accumulating impressive batting statistics, earning three All-Star appearances (1992, 1993, 1995), two Silver Slugger Awards (1993, 1994), and making key contributions to the Indians&#x27; 1995 postseason run. He was considered one of Major League Baseball&#x27;s hardest-hitting middle infielders by 1995 with his superb bat speed and switch-hitting power. After spending most of his career as a second baseman, he was used at various positions late in his career. Baerga was elected into the Indians Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Playing career==

===Cleveland Indians===
On November 4, , at the age of sixteen, Baerga was signed by the San Diego Padres. As a 17-year-old he debuted for their Class A affiliate Charleston Rainbows. He played with the team for two seasons. On December 6, , San Diego traded him to the Cleveland Indians along with Sandy Alomar Jr. and Chris James in exchange for established power-hitter Joe Carter. Baerga debuted as a major league baseball player with the Indians, on April 14, . That year, he played mostly as a third baseman and shortstop and would hit 17 doubles and seven home runs, while averaging .260 at the plate.

Over the next four years, his home run and batting averages numbers rose steadily, hitting 11 home runs, and batting .288 in while playing mostly as a third baseman and second baseman, hitting 20 home runs and averaging .312 in while becoming a full-time second baseman, and with 21 home runs and an average of .321 in . In 1992, he reached 200 hits in one season for the first time, getting 205 hits that year. In 1993, he duplicated the mark of 200 hits, with exactly 200.

Baerga became the first second baseman since Rogers Hornsby in to have back-to-back 200+ hit, 20+ home run, 100+ RBI, and .300+ average seasons when he accomplished the feat in 1992–93. He was a 3-time All Star in the 1992, 1993, and 1994 seasons.

The switch-hitting Baerga was the first of three players to have ever hit one home run from both sides of the plate in the same inning. He did so on April 8, 1993, at Cleveland Municipal Stadium against New York Yankees pitchers Steve Howe and Steve Farr in the game&#x27;s 7th inning. On August 29, , he was joined by Chicago Cubs utility player Mark Bellhorn, who completed the feat against the Milwaukee Brewers, and on July 30, 2012, Kendrys Morales became the third player to accomplish this rare feat against the Texas Rangers.

During the strike-shortened season, Baerga hit 19 home runs and maintained an average of .314 at the plate. 
In the 144-game season, Baerga had 175 hits and 15 home runs in 139 games, with a .314 average. The Indians made it to the World Series, where they fell to the Atlanta Braves in six games (Baerga flew out to Marquis Grissom for the final out).

Baerga played 100 games with the Indians in , before being traded to the New York Mets on July 29, 1996, with Álvaro Espinoza, for Jeff Kent and José Vizcaíno. He collected 129 hits with twelve home runs that year, hitting only .193 after being traded to the Mets. He ended that year with an average of .254. Over the next two seasons with the Mets, Baerga had below average seasons, hitting nine home runs and batting .281 in , and seven home runs and .266 in . He was granted free agency on October 26, 1998.

===Decline and retirement===
Baerga began to develop problems with his knees. On January 27, , Baerga was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals and released before the season began. The Cincinnati Reds signed him, but after he hit .290 in the minors, released him midseason. The San Diego Padres put him in the minors for 21 games where he hit .286, and brought him up for 33 games where he hit .250. Bought by Cleveland in August, he hit .228 in 31 games with them.

Signed briefly by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in , Baerga did not appear in the majors that year. He felt that he could no longer perform as a major leaguer. In 2001, he signed with the Seattle Mariners but was released during spring training. In , he played for the Long Island Ducks and in the Korea Baseball Organization, Samsung Lions(삼성 라이온즈 야구단)). Then he retired, and bought the Santurce Crabbers, becoming player-manager and realizing his childhood dream.

In 2013, Baerga was elected into the Indians Hall of Fame.

===Return to major leagues===
In 2002, Baerga returned to the majors. That year, he got 52 hits with the Boston Red Sox, primarily serving as a pinch-hitter and designated hitter. In , he was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he collected 71 hits for the team. The Diamondbacks re-signed him for , but the aging Baerga, now prone to injury, was hurt again and was only able to play in 20 games that season. He was signed by the Washington Nationals to a minor league contract before the season and played 93 games for them. He also played for Puerto Rico in the 2006 World Baseball Classic.

Baerga collected 1,543 hits in his MLB career, with 134 home runs, 774 RBI and a .291 batting average.

As a broadcaster, Baerga has enjoyed prominence as a color commentator for Monday Night Baseball retransmissions in Spanish on ESPN Dos for the Mexico-Caribbean-Venezuela region. He is an analyst on &quot;Beisbol Esta Noche&quot; (the Spanish version of Baseball Tonight) on ESPN Deportes and ESPN Latin America. He is recognized by fans and co-workers as &quot;Carlos Obed&quot;.

==Post-playing career==
During the 2013 World Baseball Classic, Baerga served as one of the assistant coaches under Edwin Rodríguez.

In 2013, Baerga became the manager of the Indios de Mayagüez in Puerto Rico&#x27;s Roberto Clemente Professional Baseball League.

In 2020, he was named the bench coach of RA12.

In 2024, Baerga became the analyst for the Cleveland Guardians Spanish-language radio broadcasts on WARF 1350 AM in Cleveland.

<text>The Battle of Norada took place during Japan&#x27;s Sengoku period between forces under Azai Nagamasa and Rokkaku Yoshikata in the year 1560.

Azai Nagamasa had previously been a retainer under the Rokkaku clan, and sought independence from the Rokkaku; Rokkaku Yoshikata meanwhile sought to consolidate his power through subjugation of the Azai.

== Battle ==
Rokkaku Yoshikata&#x27;s force numbered 25,000 and outnumbered Azai Nagamasa&#x27;s force by over two to one as it counted only 11,000. Both sides arrived on the battlefield unimpeded and even before engaging, Rokkaku troops defeated the army of Dodo Kuranosuke. After that easy skirmish, they believed they had already won the battle. Highly motivated under Nagamasa, his troops charged unintimidated and in the chaos of the battle, the Rokkaku force collapsed and retreated under heavy losses.

== Aftermath ==
The Azai clan ousted their defunct leader Azai Hisamasa, replacing him with Nagamasa. The Rokkaku clan fell into disarray with retainers questioning Yoshikata&#x27;s rule; his strength weakened never to recover to its height.

<text>Tush kyiz ( , туш — &quot;side, the edge&quot;, кийиз — &quot;felt&quot;; ) are large, elaborately embroidered wall hangings, traditionally made in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by women to commemorate the marriage of a son or daughter. Colors and designs are chosen to symbolize Kyrgyz traditions and rural life. Flowers, plants, animals, stylized horns, national designs, and emblems of Kyrgyz life are often found in these ornate and colorful embroideries. Designs are sometimes dated and signed by the artist upon completion of the work, which may take years to finish. The tush kyiz is hung in the yurt over the marriage bed of the couple, and symbolize their pride in their Kyrgyz tradition. 

The tush kyiz embroideries have been a family tradition among Kyrgyz people for centuries, but among the last two generations, the tradition has been confined to rural women. Shyrdaks (felt rugs) are still being made because these have always been an item for sale to the public. Tush kyiz, on the other hand, have always been created as a deeply personal family heirloom, symbolizing a newly married couple&#x27;s union with family, regional, and national tradition.

<text>Ganguly (), also known as Ganguli, Ganguly, Gangulee, Gangoly or Gangopadhyay is a native Bengali surname that is used by Kulin Brahmin group of the Bengali Brahmin caste. The traditional Bengali version of this surname is &quot;Gangopadhyay(a)&quot; or &quot;Gônggopaddhae&quot;.

== History ==
The Gangulys belong to the Kulin Brahmin class and are also classified as Rarhi class of Bengali Brahmin caste. According to texts, King Adisura invited five Brahmins to settle in the region from Kanauj and designated them higher in social status. Multiple accounts of this legend exist; historians generally consider it to be nothing more than myth or folklore, lacking historical authenticity. The tradition continues by saying that these incomers settled and each became the founder of a clan. The five Brahmin clans, which later became known as Mukherjees, Chatterjees, Banerjees, Gangulys and Bhattacharjees, were each designated as &quot;Kulina&quot; (&quot;superior&quot;) in order to differentiate them from the more established local Brahmins.

<doc id="1186881" wikidata="Q1190195" url="?curid=1186881" title="Disco Inferno (wrestler)">
<text>Glenn Gilbertti (born November 12, 1967) is an American professional wrestler, best known for his appearances with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Disco Inferno (briefly changed to Disqo) from 1995 to 2001.

During his six-year tenure with WCW, Gilbertti became a one-time Cruiserweight Champion, a two-time Television Champion and a one-time Tag Team Champion with Alex Wright. He is considered one of the more novel mid-card WCW wrestlers of the late 1990s.

After WCW, he worked for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling and World Wrestling All-Stars.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1991–1995)===
Gilbertti started wrestling in 1991 wrestling his first match on November 20, 1991. He wrestled on the Georgia independent circuit, where he was best known for his time with Great Championship Wrestling (GCW) where he won several titles. He also had a short stint with the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) in 1993.

===World Championship Wrestling (1995–2001)===

====Mid-card (1995–1996)====

Gilbertti made his name in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Disco Inferno, named after The Trammps&#x27; song and inspired by John Travolta&#x27;s character Tony Manero in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. Gilbertti credits Raven for the birth of the &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; character. He annoyed the audience with his disco dancer character, which included dancing on the way to the ring and during his matches, the punchline being that fans would chant &quot;Disco sucks!&quot;. He would come out and dance to his entrance music called &quot;Disco Fever&quot; (wrote and sung by Jimmy Hart using female-like vocals similar to when he sang the harmonies on Shawn Michaels&#x27; &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; song).

Gilbertti signed a contract with WCW in 1995 and debuted later that same year. He gradually rose to mid-card status as a tweener, with his gimmick being that he would forget how to apply his finishing hold, a standing figure four leglock. Often, he would bring a cheat sheet with a diagram on how to apply the hold to the ring. He mostly competed in the WCW&#x27;s shows &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Main Event&quot; and &quot;WorldWide&quot; that mainly featured mid-card wrestlers . Inferno wrestled on many editions of &quot;Main Event&quot; before pay-per-view events against superstars such as Joey Maggs and Eddie Guerrero. He also competed on January 23, 1996 Clash of the Champions XXXII in a losing effort to Kevin Sullivan. Inferno made his pay-per-view debut at Slamboree 1996: Lord of the Ring in a tag team contest where he teamed up with Alex Wright against Dick Slater and Earl Robert Eaton.

====Face push (1996–1997)====
Disco started making a push in the cruiserweight division by the mid-1996. He began a feud with Cruiserweight Champion Dean Malenko and unsuccessfully challenged him for the title at Bash at the Beach. At World War 3, he participated in the three ring, 60 man battle royal with the winner receiving a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship. Inferno was injured in early 1997 and he took some time off before returning in September. His injury was mentioned after Disco refused to lose to Jacqueline because she was a woman.

Disco then feuded with Alex Wright, who began dancing before his entrance to mock Disco. Disco was booked to win the WCW World Television Championship from Wright on September 22 edition of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;. Disco lost to Jacqueline at Halloween Havoc. He engaged in a feud with Perry Saturn after losing the Television title to Saturn on November 3 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Disco lost to Saturn in a rematch at World War 3, before regaining the title from Saturn in a rematch on the December 8 episode of &quot;Nitro&quot;. Four weeks later, he dropped the title to Booker T.

====Heel run (1998–2001)====

====The Dancing Fools====

After having two reigns as Television Champion, Disco once again became an enhancement talent and a mid-carder in the cruiserweight division. He defeated La Parka at SuperBrawl VIII. He patched up things with former rival Alex Wright, thus turning into a villain in the process and the duo formed a tag team of dancers known as Dancing Fools. The team was used for comedy relief and often danced before their entrance. They were also joined by fellow dancer Tokyo Magnum. At Bash at the Beach, Inferno lost a match to Konnan. Inferno and Wright feuded with teams such as The Public Enemy (Johnny Grunge and Rocco Rock), and The British Bulldog and Jim Neidhart.

====nWo Wolfpac====
After not getting any success, Inferno and Wright split and began focusing on their singles careers again. Inferno started a feud with Juventud Guerrera and defeated him at Halloween Havoc to become the number one contender to the Cruiserweight Championship. He earned his title shot later that night against champion Billy Kidman but lost the match. At World War 3, he participated in the three ring, 60-man battle royal with the winner getting a shot at the World Heavyweight Championship at Starrcade, but the battle royal was won by Kevin Nash. Later at Starrcade, Disco along with Bam Bam Bigelow and Scott Hall assisted Nash in ending Goldberg&#x27;s 173 match winning streak in the main event of Starrcade. Inferno became allied with, although he never joined the nWo Wolfpac until after the reunion. Around that time, Disco feuded with the likes of Booker T, Konnan, Buff Bagwell and Ernest Miller.

Gilbertti later said that the nWo storyline and working with Hall was the highlight of his career.

====The Mamalukes enforcer====
Inferno won the Cruiserweight Championship from Psychosis on October 4, 1999, edition of &quot;Nitro&quot;. He entered a program with Lash LeRoux and had a successful title defense against LeRoux at Halloween Havoc. He was joined by a new ally Tony Marinara. Inferno dropped the Cruiserweight title to Evan Karagias at Mayhem after Inferno accidentally attacked Marinara. Marinara joined The Mamalukes, while Disco was joined by LeRoux. At Starrcade, Disco and LeRoux lost to Mamalukes after Disco accidentally attacked LeRoux. Disco aligned with Mamalukes and became an enforcer for the duo.

====The Filthy Animals and heel incarnation====
In spring 2000, Eric Bischoff and Vince Russo &quot;rebooted&quot; WCW and the New Blood was formed. Disco joined The Mamalukes, then the Filthy Animals, renaming himself Hip Hop Inferno and then Disqo (a pun on R&amp;B singer Sisqó, whose single &quot;Thong Song&quot; was a major hit at the time). The Filthy Animals feuded with Misfits in Action and Disqo unsuccessfully challenged Lieutenant Loco for the Cruiserweight Championship at The Great American Bash. At New Blood Rising, Disqo refereed a fatal four-way match for the World Tag Team Championship, which KroniK won. At Fall Brawl 2000, Filthy Animals fought Natural Born Thrillers to a no contest in an elimination match. During the match, Disco turned on Konnan by hitting him with a Chart Buster and began feuding with both the Animals and the Thrillers.

====The Boogie Knights====
Disco reunited with both former rival and tag team partner, Alex Wright as The Boogie Knights, both becoming face. At Halloween Havoc, they challenged for the World Tag Team Championship in a triangle match but ended up losing the match. They were scheduled to win the World Tag Team Championship at Millennium Final on November 16, but Disco was legitimately injured. General Rection substituted for Disqo and then won the tag titles for Disqo and Wright. They dropped the title afterward. He ended up splitting from Wright and forming a brief partnership with Mike Sanders. Disco&#x27;s last appearance with WCW came on the March 19, 2001 (second to last) edition of Nitro where he spoke about his new partnership with Sanders and lost a match to Jason Jett. WCW was purchased by World Wrestling Federation (WWF) later that week.

===World Wrestling All-Stars (2001–2003)===
After WCW was gone, he worked for World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) as a commentator and wrestler (still using the Disco Inferno name). At Inception, he participated in a battle royal which was won by Buff Bagwell. It was a quarter-final match of the tournament for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship. He was eliminated by the &#x27;Fruits in Suits&#x27;, Australian children&#x27;s TV performers, in a WCW style joke story line. He later threw one of the fruits off the top of the steel cage before the main event. During his time with the WWA, Disco continued his humorous gimmick both in and out of the ring. Following the Inception pay-per-view, he toured the UK with the WWA. He faced Brian Christopher most nights on the tour, mostly ending in defeat. During these shows he introduced a new finishing move, the &quot;Village People&#x27;s Elbow&quot;. This was a mock of the Rock&#x27;s people&#x27;s elbow and involved Disco wearing a hardhat and doing the YMCA dance before dropping the elbow. Also at these shows he joined Jeremy Borash on commentary in the second half of the shows, claiming that he was there as the crowd had not shown him respect earlier in the show.

In 2002 Disco continued with the WWA, appearing at the Revolution pay-per-view in February. During this show he issued an open challenge for anyone to face him, as he had no opponent to face. He sat at ringside commentating in his usual style until he was beaten down by the returning Scott Steiner. The next PPV, Eruption, saw Disco commentating on the full event and not competing. He tried to intervene on a celebration dance off by Brian Christopher and Ernest Miller.

Later in the year he toured further with the WWA in the UK in December. During this tour, which included the Retribution PPV, he mostly worked on commentary and ring announcing duties. He also credited as being the script writer/creative consultant for this tour. In 2003, he returned to WWA under his &quot;Disco Inferno&quot; gimmick. On May 23 in a house show in Australia, Disco faced WWA World Heavyweight Champion Sting for the title but lost the match. He returned to commentary duties for the WWA final PPV, the Reckoning.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling/Impact Wrestling (2002–2004, 2007–present)===
====Early years (2002–2004)====

Gilbertti then went on to join Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), changing his alias to his real name. His name was often spelled incorrectly using &quot;Glen Gilberti&quot; or &quot;Glenn Gilberti&quot;. On the July 31, 2002, weekly TNA pay-per-view, Disco Inferno debuted his weekly talk segment entitled &quot;Jive Talkin&quot;&#x27; after announcing that he would be hosting a talk show the previous week. The talk segment lasted three weeks ending on August 14, 2002, with the weekly guests being Goldy Locks, The Dupps, and &quot;Dean Baldwin&quot;.

Gilbertti became a member of Sports Entertainment Xtreme (SEX) and even became their leader near the end of that angle. On May 7, 2003, pay-per-view, he won an Anarchy Battle Royal to become the number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The next month, he earned his title shot against the champion Jeff Jarrett but lost the match after Vince Russo hit him with a baseball bat.

After SEX disbanded, Gilbertti managed the tag team Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger prior to forming the New York Connection (NYC) which consisted of Vito, Simon Diamond, David Young, Johnny Swinger and Trinity. On the November 26 pay-per-view, Gilbertti teamed up with Diamond and Swinger in a 6-man tag team match to face 3Live Kru (Konnan, Ron Killings and B.G. James) for the vacant NWA World Tag Team Championship. When their stable fell apart, Gilbertti began teaming with Young while Simon and Swinger formed a separate team. In late 2004, Gilbertti reunited with Swinger and the duo teamed up together at Turning Point in a losing effort to Pat Kenney (formerly Simon Diamond) and Johnny B. Badd. Gilbertti left TNA and returned to independent circuit.

====Sporadic appearances (2007–present)====
On October 18, 2007, edition of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Gilbertti appeared in a taped interview segment with Mike Tenay as Disco Inferno. He returned later in the show, losing in a squash match to Abyss.

In late 2007, Gilbertti worked for TNA as a road agent and also contributed to the creative team with Vince Russo. He also attended TNA&#x27;s Lockdown fan interaction in Lowell, Massachusetts on April 12, 2008, and later appeared as a guest on the October 8, 2008 edition of &quot;Spin Cycle&quot;, TNA&#x27;s online-exclusive show. On November 2, 2008, Gilbertti was released from his contract with TNA, with them citing budgetary cuts as the reason.

On the May 26, 2011 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Disco Inferno made an appearance on Mr. Anderson&#x27;s Scorpion Sitdown interview segment, where he was asked by Anderson to bury Sting. He refused and got beat down by Anderson until Sting came to his aid.

Disco Inferno made a brief appearance on the December 15 edition of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; titled &quot;Total Nonstop Deletion.&quot; Appearing &quot;backstage,&quot; Inferno commented on his relief in not having to face Matt Hardy&#x27;s son King Maxel in his debut match after being pinned by him on another occasion.

Gilbertti appeared on the Thanksgiving 2018 episode of Impact Wrestling. Gilbertti had a plan to impress Scarlett Bordeaux. He participated in Eli Drake&#x27;s 2nd annual &quot;Gravy Train Turkey Trot&quot;, a 5-on-5 mixed tag team match where he teamed with Ohio Versus Everything member Jake Crist, Katarina), Desi Hit Squad member Rohit Raju, and their captain Eli Drake. They faced the team of Alisha Edwards, Dezmond Xavier, Kikutaro, KM (Kevin Matthews and team captain Fallah Bahh. Gilbertti was pinned by Fallah Bahh after a Bonzai Drop. Since Gilbertti was pinned in the match, he was forced to wear the Turkey suit.

Gilbertti made his return on February 22, 2019, where he was shown backstage trying to find the management office. On the March 1 episode, Gilbertti showed up to start his new job with management role with Impact, while Tommy Dreamer told him to find the Anthem owl. On the March 8 episode, while searching for Don Callis ringside to discuss his Impact management role, Gilbertti had a confrontation with Scarlett Bordeaux. A match is booked between the two. On March 15, Gilbertti beat Kikutaro as he prepared for Bordeaux. On the March 22 episode, Gilbertti was shown at a bar &quot;preparing&quot; for his match with Bordeaux. On March 29, Scarlett Bordeaux beat Gilbertti in an intergender match. Later in the night, he was shown backstage being made fun of by Alisha Edwards and Kiera Hogan for losing to Bordeaux.

Gilbertti returned on the May 17 episode and spoke negatively about women&#x27;s wrestling. While serving as a guest commentator for a women&#x27;s battle royal, Gilbertti entered the match and won by eliminating Tessa Blanchard. On the May 24 episode, Gilbertti held an &quot;exhibition&quot; with Ashley Vox. He was confronted by Blanchard after badmouthing women&#x27;s wrestling. On May 31, Blanchard beat Gilbertti in an inter-gender match.

Gilbertti returned on February 25, 2020, and formed a partnership with Johnny Swinger after Willie Mack said he would no longer be a tag team with Swinger. The following week, Gilbertti and Swinger lost to the Deaners. On the March 10 episode, Gilbertti and Swinger lost to Mack and Ace Austin. Gilbertti quit the team with Swinger after the match.

===Independent appearances (2005–present)===
In 2005, Gilbertti went back to working the independent circuit in Georgia and Minnesota. He also wrestled for the Southern Wrestling Alliance and Vince Russo&#x27;s Ring of Glory.

Since 2009 he has worked as a trainer for Future Stars of Wrestling in Las Vegas and sometimes appears on the company&#x27;s independent shows.

He appeared at the WrestleCon Supershow during Wrestlemania 31 weekend in San Jose, California. He defeated Mr. T.A.

Disco teamed with Eli Drake on March 11, 2018, at Future Stars of Wrestling in Las Vegas. The two lost to Raven and Tommy Dreamer.

==Podcasts and other work==
In 2014, Gilbertti began appearing as a guest on Major League Wrestling Radio&#x27;s podcasts and in early 2015 briefly had his own podcast &#x27;Hot News&#x27; alongside Mike Sanders on Vince Russo&#x27;s now defunct Pyro and Ballyhoo website. 

Gilbertti is currently one of the hosts of a podcast called &quot;Keepin it 100&quot; with Konnan. He has been with the show since it debuted on Podcast One in 2016. He also does a podcast with Vince Russo called &quot;Time Out&quot;.

==Booking career and legacy==
In June 2000, Gilbertti assisted in the booking of the WCW shows. During that time, the booking committee consisted of Gilbertti, Vince Russo, Bill Banks, Ed Ferrara, and Terry Taylor. During booking sessions, Gilbertti would occasionally joke with the creative team about potential angles: one included doing a Martian invasion storyline where the story would start with antennas coming out of Mike Tenay&#x27;s head; another one would include a pre-recorded vignette showing an empty locker-room followed by a caption showing &quot;Invisible Man: Coming Soon&quot;.

In Vince Russo&#x27;s book &quot;Rope Opera&quot;, Russo says when he was close to re-signing as head writer of the WWE creative team in mid-2002, he requested that Gilbertti be brought in with him; according to Russo, word got around about Gilbertti&#x27;s booking to the point that Vince McMahon questioned Russo&#x27;s decision about bringing in Gilbertti due to legitimate concerns about Gilbertti&#x27;s ideas, and referenced the &quot;martian invasion&quot; angle to him. Russo ended up not signing with WWE later and Gilbertti was not signed as a result as well.

Gilbertti had a brief stint on the creative team in TNA in late 2007 to early 2008, when Russo brought him in. Post-WCW, during interviews and columns he had written, Gilbertti had been known to be very vocal about his preference of the entertainment aspect over the athletic component of professional wrestling.

In September 2015, Kayfabe Commentaries, who produces DVDs of wrestler interviews, released &quot;Guest Booker with Glenn Gilbertti&quot; where Gilbertti talked about his wrestling philosophy as well as his joke ideas such as the martian invasion, the Invisible Man, and &quot;Bill Ding: The Evil Architect&quot;; when asked what his favorite story or character he booked, Gilbertti said the booking of Lance Storm in WCW where Storm was pushed week after week to the point where he held three titles at the same time.

On that same Guest Booker interview, Gilbertti elaborated on his philosophy on booking professional wrestling:

On April 8, 2014, &quot;WWE Countdown&quot; ranked the Disco Inferno character portrayed by Gilbertti as the sixth most infamous gimmick in wrestling history. Many of his peers from WCW—now working for WWE—such as William Regal, Bill DeMott, and Scott Armstrong, did defend Gilbertti, stating that he fully embraced the gimmick and was successfully able to get it over with fans. Gilbertti was not interviewed for the show.

==Personal life==
Since 2009, Gilbertti started working as a host at the Sapphire Gentlemen&#x27;s Club, a strip club in Las Vegas.

<text>The Canadian Bar Association (CBA), or Association du barreau canadien (ABC) in French, represents over 37,000 lawyers, judges, notaries, law teachers and law students from across Canada.

==History==

The Association&#x27;s first Annual Meeting was held in Montreal in 1896. However, the CBA has been in continuous existence in its present form since 1914. The Association was incorporated in 1921.

==Objectives==
The CBA is a voluntary bar association for members of the legal profession; it is the voice of its members and its primary purpose is to serve its members; it is the premier provider of personal and professional development and support to members of the legal profession; it promotes fair justice systems, facilitates effective law reform, promotes equality in the legal profession and is devoted to the elimination of discrimination; the CBA is a leading edge organization committed to enhancing the professional and commercial interests of a diverse membership and to protecting the independence of the judiciary and the bar.

The Association advances its objectives through the work of its sections, committees, conferences and task forces at both the national and branch levels. It has branches in each of the provinces and three territories. Membership is voluntary in all but New Brunswick, where by agreement with the law society, lawyers in the province belong to the national association. Approximately half of all practicing lawyers in Canada belong to the Canadian Bar Association.

==Organization==
The national office of the Canadian Bar Association is located in Ottawa. With a staff of 80, the national office provides legislative monitoring and liaison (60 - 70 submissions are made federally each year), membership, continuing legal education, translation, meeting coordination, accounting, data processing, communications, printing, and professional services. The Association&#x27;s website and databanks are administered by the national office.

Policy decisions are made by Council which meets twice a year (February and August) and includes approximately 225 voting members representing the membership across Canada. The members of national Council elect the treasurer and the second vice president.

The 32 national sections of the Canadian Bar Association provide a forum for development of individual specialties. These sections provide information to Association members on specific areas of law. Along with the standing committees, task forces and conferences, the sections offer individual lawyers an opportunity to keep up to date with current developments in the law and provides them with information through newsletters, the web and meetings.

The Canadian Bar Association is also affiliated with several international associations, including the Commonwealth Lawyers Association, International Bar Association, the Inter-American Bar Association and the International Commission of Jurists. The Association also maintains a strong liaison with the American Bar Association. Membership in these groups provides the Association with input on recent developments in the legal profession on a broad scale.

<doc id="1186885" wikidata="Q7862772" url="?curid=1186885" title="Tūrangawaewae">
<text>Tūrangawaewae () is a marae and a royal residence in Ngāruawāhia, Waikato, New Zealand. It is the official residence of the Māori monarch and the administrative headquarters of the Kīngitanga movement. Of its numerous buildings, the two principal ones are the Māhinārangi meeting house, and Tūrongo House, which is official residence of the queen or king.

Māhinārangi and Tūrongo are made of wood and are covered in complex Māori carvings (&quot;whakairo&quot;), painted burgundy and cream. Over the years, it has undergone renovations, in harmony with the original style, which represents a unique synthesis of classical Māori and Edwardian architecture. For its 2012 renovations, Tūrangawaewae was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects&#x27; Waikato-Bay of Plenty Regional Award in the Heritage Category.

==Buildings and history==
Ngāti Tamaoho hapū under the leadership of Princess Te Puea Hērangi began by clearing swampy land overgrown with scrub and blackberry vines, including an area that had been used recently as a rubbish dump in August 1921. The name &quot;Tūrangawaewae &quot; means &quot;a place to stand&quot;.

The marae&#x27;s buildings include the carved Māhinārangi meeting house, built in 1929, and next to it, Tūrongo House, the Māori King or Queen&#x27;s official residence, built in 1938. The two houses are named after Māhinārangi, an East Coast &quot;princess&quot;, and her husband Tūrongo, a Tainui chief. The link this marriage formed between the two tribal regions was highlighted by Sir Āpirana Ngata when Te Puea was debating a name for the house. Ngata and his tribe, Ngāti Porou, had contributed thousands of pounds in funding by supporting performances by Te Puea&#x27;s concert party when it travelled the East Coast region. In addition he sent expert carvers and weavers to assist with the construction of the building. To commemorate this he asked that the meeting house be named after the East Coast ancestress to salute the ancient link and the modern day koha (gift) Ngāti Porou had provided.

The death and suffering of local Māori caused by the 1918 flu pandemic still remained fresh in the memory of Tūrangawaewae residents and Te Puea&#x27;s original vision for Māhinārangi was to be a hospital for the Māori community so they could receive treatment in a traditional manner. However the Ministry of Health would not grant the necessary permits for it to be used this way. Thus the building was made into a reception hall of sorts and has hosted many foreign dignitaries. A visiting New Zealand prime minister commented at the conclusion of a visit with King Korokī that the house was a fine sitting room for a king. This comment gave Te Puea an idea: what use is a sitting room if there is no house to entertain visiting guests properly?

Thus Tūrongo house was born. This exquisitely carved home was the brainchild of Te Puea. Having noticed a home in Hamilton with a hexagonal tower in the corner she came up with a blueprint that incorporated both Māori and European architectural styles. The house&#x27;s interior and exterior surfaces have been carved extensively and have incorporated many symbols important to the Kīngitanga movement. A seven-sided tower in the corner represents the seven initial waka that, according to tradition, brought the Māori people to their new home of Aotearoa. It also has some unique features such as untreated ponga log cladding on the exterior walls. There are also two pātaka (store houses) acting as dormer windows on the roof and storing important taonga (treasures) of the Kīngitanga. Each one represents the Māori and Pākehā influence on the local people. The modern day house contains magnificent reception rooms, dining rooms and kitchens that are suitable for the Arikinui to host guests in a distinctly Māori fashion.

Some of Te Puea&#x27;s main goals for the movement were to increase the mana or prestige of the Kīngitanga and its figurehead the Arikinui by:

# Raising the standards of health, housing and employment of the people
# Establishing a national marae complex at Ngāruawāhia (Tūrangawaewae Marae) that would be a centre of Māori culture and politics, thus creating a strong sense of community, pride and more importantly, mana amongst the Kīngitanga.

==Modern use==

Tūrangawaewae, along with the Kīngitanga movement and the office of the Arikinui, has become a key institution to showcase Māoridom not only in New Zealand but the world. World leaders including Nelson Mandela, Queen Elizabeth II and many of her children have paid courtesy visits to the Māori monarch and the people of the Kīngitanga.

Under the leadership of Te Puea strong relationships had been established with the Polynesian royal families of the Cook Islands, Samoa and Tonga. As a result, during the annual Koroneihana (coronation) festivities, representatives of the Polynesian royal houses including Queen Salote of Tonga and many of her descendants have made many visits and gifted highly prized taonga to the Arikinui, which are now housed in the dual pātaka of Tūrongo.

Tūrangawaewae Marae and its unique buildings are a physical representation of the determination of the Kīngitanga to not only survive the last 200 years of turmoil, but to prosper and flourish under the leadership of leaders like Te Puea and Te Arikinui Dame Te Atairangikaahu.

In 2012, architects Salmon Reid designed and oversaw a renovation of Māhinārangi and Tūrongo. The project included a kitchen upgrade and the addition of new food preparation and taonga storage buildings. Exterior cladding of ponga trunks and weatherboards was removed temporarily for structural strengthening. Modern utilities, such as a sprinkler system, were retrofitted while keeping changes in harmony with the heritage values of the buildings. The project was awarded the New Zealand Institute of Architects&#x27; Waikato-Bay of Plenty Regional Award in the Heritage Category. In October 2020, the Government committed $370,730 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade the marae, creating 30 jobs.

<text>In algebraic geometry, a linear system of divisors is an algebraic generalization of the geometric notion of a family of curves; the dimension of the linear system corresponds to the number of parameters of the family.

These arose first in the form of a &quot;linear system&quot; of algebraic curves in the projective plane. It assumed a more general form, through gradual generalisation, so that one could speak of linear equivalence of divisors &quot;D&quot; on a general scheme or even a ringed space formula_1.

Linear systems of dimension 1, 2, or 3 are called a [[Pencil (mathematics)|pencil]], a net, or a web, respectively.

A map determined by a linear system is sometimes called the Kodaira map.

==Definitions ==
Given a general variety formula_2, two divisors formula_3 are linearly equivalent if

:formula_4

for some non-zero rational function formula_5 on formula_2, or in other words a non-zero element formula_5 of the function field formula_8. Here formula_9 denotes the divisor of zeroes and poles of the function formula_5.

Note that if formula_2 has singular points, the notion of &#x27;divisor&#x27; is inherently ambiguous (Cartier divisors, Weil divisors: see divisor (algebraic geometry)). The definition in that case is usually said with greater care (using invertible sheaves or holomorphic line bundles); see below.

A complete linear system on formula_2 is defined as the set of all effective divisors linearly equivalent to some given divisor formula_13. It is denoted formula_14. Let formula_15 be the line bundle associated to formula_16. In the case that formula_2 is a nonsingular projective variety, the set formula_14 is in natural bijection with formula_19 by associating the element formula_20 of formula_14 to the set of non-zero multiples of formula_5 (this is well defined since two non-zero rational functions have the same divisor if and only if they are non-zero multiples of each other). A complete linear system formula_14 is therefore a projective space.

A linear system formula_24 is then a projective subspace of a complete linear system, so it corresponds to a vector subspace &quot;W&quot; of formula_25 The dimension of the linear system formula_24 is its dimension as a projective space. Hence formula_27.

Linear systems can also be introduced by means of the line bundle or invertible sheaf language. In those terms, divisors formula_16 (Cartier divisors, to be precise) correspond to line bundles, and linear equivalence of two divisors means that the corresponding line bundles are isomorphic.

== Examples ==

=== Linear equivalence ===
Consider the line bundle formula_29 on formula_30 whose sections formula_31 define quadric surfaces. For the associated divisor formula_32, it is linearly equivalent to any other divisor defined by the vanishing locus of some formula_33 using the rational function formula_34 (Proposition 7.2). For example, the divisor formula_16 associated to the vanishing locus of formula_36 is linearly equivalent to the divisor formula_37 associated to the vanishing locus of formula_38. Then, there is the equivalence of divisorsformula_39

=== Linear systems on curves ===
One of the important complete linear systems on an algebraic curve formula_40 of genus formula_41 is given by the complete linear system associated with the canonical divisor formula_42, denoted formula_43. This definition follows from proposition II.7.7 of Hartshorne since every effective divisor in the linear system comes from the zeros of some section of formula_44.

==== Hyperelliptic curves ====
One application of linear systems is used in the classification of algebraic curves. A hyperelliptic curve is a curve formula_40 with a degree formula_46 morphism formula_47. For the case formula_48 all curves are hyperelliptic: the Riemann–Roch theorem then gives the degree of formula_49 is formula_50 and formula_51, hence there is a degree formula_46 map to formula_53.

==== gdr ====
A formula_54 is a linear system formula_24 on a curve formula_40 which is of degree formula_57 and dimension formula_58. For example, hyperelliptic curves have a formula_59 which is induced by the formula_60-map formula_61. In fact, hyperelliptic curves have a unique formula_59 from proposition 5.3. Another close set of examples are curves with a formula_63 which are called trigonal curves. In fact, any curve has a formula_64 for formula_65.

===Linear systems of hypersurfaces in a projective space===
Consider the line bundle formula_66 over formula_67. If we take global sections formula_68, then we can take its projectivization formula_69. This is isomorphic to formula_70 where

:formula_71

Then, using any embedding formula_72 we can construct a linear system of dimension formula_73.

===Linear system of conics===
===Characteristic linear system of a family of curves===
The characteristic linear system of a family of curves on an algebraic surface &quot;Y&quot; for a curve &quot;C&quot; in the family is a linear system formed by the curves in the family that are infinitely near &quot;C&quot;.

In modern terms, it is a subsystem of the linear system associated to the normal bundle to formula_74. Note a characteristic system need not to be complete; in fact, the question of completeness is something studied extensively by the Italian school without a satisfactory conclusion; nowadays, the Kodaira–Spencer theory can be used to answer the question of the completeness.

=== Other examples ===
The Cayley–Bacharach theorem is a property of a pencil of cubics, which states that the base locus satisfies an &quot;8 implies 9&quot; property: any cubic containing 8 of the points necessarily contains the 9th.

==Linear systems in birational geometry==

In general linear systems became a basic tool of birational geometry as practised by the Italian school of algebraic geometry. The technical demands became quite stringent; later developments clarified a number of issues. The computation of the relevant dimensions — the Riemann–Roch problem as it can be called — can be better phrased in terms of homological algebra. The effect of working on varieties with singular points is to show up a difference between Weil divisors (in the free abelian group generated by codimension-one subvarieties), and Cartier divisors coming from sections of invertible sheaves.

The Italian school liked to reduce the geometry on an algebraic surface to that of linear systems cut out by surfaces in three-space; Zariski wrote his celebrated book &quot;Algebraic Surfaces&quot; to try to pull together the methods, involving &quot;linear systems with fixed base points&quot;. There was a controversy, one of the final issues in the conflict between &#x27;old&#x27; and &#x27;new&#x27; points of view in algebraic geometry, over Henri Poincaré&#x27;s characteristic linear system of an algebraic family of curves on an algebraic surface.

== Base locus ==
The base locus of a linear system of divisors on a variety refers to the subvariety of points &#x27;common&#x27; to all divisors in the linear system. Geometrically, this corresponds to the common intersection of the varieties. Linear systems may or may not have a base locus – for example, the pencil of affine lines formula_75 has no common intersection, but given two (nondegenerate) conics in the complex projective plane, they intersect in four points (counting with multiplicity) and thus the pencil they define has these points as base locus.

More precisely, suppose that formula_14 is a complete linear system of divisors on some variety formula_2. Consider the intersection

: formula_78

where formula_79 denotes the support of a divisor, and the intersection is taken over all effective divisors formula_80 in the linear system. This is the base locus of formula_14 (as a set, at least: there may be more subtle scheme-theoretic considerations as to what the structure sheaf of formula_82 should be).

One application of the notion of base locus is to nefness of a Cartier divisor class (i.e. complete linear system). Suppose formula_14 is such a class on a variety formula_2, and formula_40 an irreducible curve on formula_2. If formula_40 is not contained in the base locus of formula_14, then there exists some divisor formula_89 in the class which does not contain formula_40, and so intersects it properly. Basic facts from intersection theory then tell us that we must have formula_91. The conclusion is that to check nefness of a divisor class, it suffices to compute the intersection number with curves contained in the base locus of the class. So, roughly speaking, the &#x27;smaller&#x27; the base locus, the &#x27;more likely&#x27; it is that the class is nef.

In the modern formulation of algebraic geometry, a complete linear system formula_14 of (Cartier) divisors on a variety formula_2 is viewed as a line bundle formula_94 on formula_2. From this viewpoint, the base locus formula_96 is the set of common zeroes of all sections of formula_94. A simple consequence is that the bundle is globally generated if and only if the base locus is empty.

The notion of the base locus still makes sense for a non-complete linear system as well: the base locus of it is still the intersection of the supports of all the effective divisors in the system.

=== Example ===
Consider the Lefschetz pencil formula_98 given by two generic sections formula_99, so formula_100 given by the schemeformula_101This has an associated linear system of divisors since each polynomial, formula_102 for a fixed formula_103 is a divisor in formula_67. Then, the base locus of this system of divisors is the scheme given by the vanishing locus of formula_105, soformula_106

== A map determined by a linear system ==

Each linear system on an algebraic variety determines a morphism from the complement of the base locus to a projective space of dimension of the system, as follows. (In a sense, the converse is also true; see the section below)

Let &quot;L&quot; be a line bundle on an algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; and formula_107 a finite-dimensional vector subspace. For the sake of clarity, we first consider the case when &quot;V&quot; is base-point-free; in other words, the natural map formula_108 is surjective (here, &quot;k&quot; = the base field). Or equivalently, formula_109 is surjective. Hence, writing formula_110 for the trivial vector bundle and passing the surjection to the relative Proj, there is a closed immersion:
:formula_111
where formula_112 on the right is the invariance of the projective bundle under a twist by a line bundle. Following &quot;i&quot; by a projection, there results in the map:
:formula_113

When the base locus of &quot;V&quot; is not empty, the above discussion still goes through with formula_114 in the direct sum replaced by an ideal sheaf defining the base locus and &quot;X&quot; replaced by the blow-up formula_115 of it along the (scheme-theoretic) base locus &quot;B&quot;. Precisely, as above, there is a surjection formula_116 where formula_117 is the ideal sheaf of &quot;B&quot; and that gives rise to 
:formula_118
Since formula_119 an open subset of formula_115, there results in the map:
:formula_121

Finally, when a basis of &quot;V&quot; is chosen, the above discussion becomes more down-to-earth (and that is the style used in Hartshorne, Algebraic Geometry).

== Linear system determined by a map to a projective space ==

Each morphism from an algebraic variety to a projective space determines a base-point-free linear system on the variety; because of this, a base-point-free linear system and a map to a projective space are often used interchangeably.

For a closed immersion formula_122 of algebraic varieties there is a pullback of a linear system formula_123 on formula_2 to formula_125, defined as formula_126 (page 158).

=== O(1) on a projective variety ===
A projective variety formula_2 embedded in formula_128 has a natural linear system determining a map to projective space from formula_129. This sends a point formula_130 to its corresponding point formula_131.

<doc id="1186887" wikidata="Q2294274" url="?curid=1186887" title="Operation Algeciras">
<text>Operation Algeciras was a failed Argentine plan to sabotage a Royal Navy warship in Gibraltar during the Falklands War. The Argentine reasoning was that if the British military felt vulnerable in Europe, they would decide to keep some vessels in European waters rather than send them to the Falklands.

A commando team observed British naval traffic in the area from Spain during 1982, waiting to attack a target of opportunity when ordered, using frogmen and Italian limpet mines.

The plan was to launch divers from Algeciras, have them swim across the bay, to Gibraltar, under cover of darkness, attach the mines to a British naval ship and swim back to Algeciras. The timed detonators would cause the mines to explode after the divers had time to safely swim back across the bay. The plan was foiled when the Spanish police became suspicious of their behaviour and arrested them before any attack could be mounted.

== Background ==

=== Planning ===
The operation was conceived, ordered and directly managed by Admiral Jorge Anaya, who at the time was a member of the National Reorganization Process and head of the Argentine Navy. The plan was top secret and not shared with other members of the government. Anaya summoned to his office Admiral Eduardo Morris Girling, who was responsible for the Naval Intelligence Service, and explained to him the convenience of hitting the Royal Navy in Europe. Girling would be the one who would make the plan and select the participants but Anaya remained in charge of the operation throughout.

Striking in the United Kingdom was considered at first but it was thought that the commandos would have difficulty remaining unnoticed and Spain was chosen because the commandos could more easily pass unnoticed as tourists.

=== Participants ===
The leader of the operation was Héctor Rosales, a spy and former naval officer. He was in charge but would not participate in the actual placing of the mines which was left to the experts. Three former members of the Peronist guerrilla Montoneros were convinced to participate in spite of the earlier repression of the Montoneros by the military.

The leader of the commandos was Máximo Nicoletti, a diver and expert in underwater explosives. His father served in the Italian Navy&#x27;s underwater demolition team during the Second World War and thereafter owned a diving business. In the early &#x27;70s Nicoletti had joined the Montoneros and engaged in urban insurgent actions by the military junta. On 1 November 1974, Nicoletti placed a remote-controlled bomb under the yacht of the police chief of the Argentine Federal Police, Alberto Villar, who was killed together with his wife.

On 22 September 1975, while the destroyer was still under construction in Buenos Aires, Nicoletti placed an explosive charge under the hull which caused it to sink. Later in the decade, Nicoletti was arrested by the infamous &quot;Grupo de Tareas 3.3.2&quot; of the Navy Mechanics School, but escaped serious punishment by cooperating with the authorities.

Soon, due to his cooperation and expertise, he managed to get himself appointed to carry out a similar submarine attack against a Chilean ship because tensions between Chile and Argentina were high due to the Beagle dispute. This attack was not carried out in the end because the disagreement between Chile and Argentina was finally resolved peacefully. Nicoletti was then sent to Venezuela as a spy but he was discovered and had to return to Argentina. Shortly after he settled in Miami, but when he heard of the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands he immediately got in touch with the Argentinian government in case his services were needed and he was instructed to return to Buenos Aires.

The other two commandos, both also ex-Montoneros, were Antonio Nelson Latorre and another man who went by &quot;Marciano,&quot; while remaining anonymous to this day. Both had participated with Nicoletti in earlier sabotage plans. In the event of capture, Argentina would deny all knowledge. The agents were to say they were Argentine patriots acting on their own. They had orders not to do anything which could involve or embarrass Spain, to sink a British naval vessel and to get express approval from Anaya before carrying out any attack.

When planning the operation in Argentina it was decided that acquiring or manufacturing explosives in Spain would prove too difficult and so two explosive mines with timed detonators would be shipped to Spain via diplomatic pouch and would be delivered to the commando group in Spain. Italian limpet mines were acquired for this purpose and shipped to Spain in diplomatic pouch as planned.

=== Situation in Spain ===
At that time the political climate in Spain was unstable with the government of Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo having political difficulties on many fronts, including with the military who mistrusted him. The trials for those responsible for the military coup attempt of 23-F a year earlier were concluding and this further raised tensions. The Basque terror group, Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, were very active and police checkpoints were common.

The upcoming 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain meant the police were very alert to any suspicious or terrorist activity. The police requested that everybody remain vigilant, and that people should report anything unusual, especially within the travel industry.

== Execution ==

=== Infiltration ===
The commandos were issued counterfeit Argentine passports under false names and marked with false earlier entry stamps to Spain. This was done so the Argentine government could deny any involvement in case the commandos were discovered, and the passports were made by another former Montonero, Víctor Basterra.

On 24 April, Nicoletti and Latorre left Buenos Aires for Paris where Latorre&#x27;s passport raised the suspicions of French authorities, but they were allowed to continue their onward travel by air to Málaga. They carried the closed-circuit, military scuba gear in their luggage and passed through Spanish customs control without raising suspicion. They carried a substantial amount of US dollars and paid for everything in cash. They both checked into a hotel in Estepona and spent some days reconnoitring the area, after which they travelled to Madrid in a rented car to meet Rosales and Marciano. They then rented another two cars whilst in Madrid and went to the office of the Argentine Naval attaché to pick up the mines.

While in Spain, the commando communicated daily by telephone with the Naval Attaché of the Argentine embassy in Madrid, who in turn would relay everything back to his superiors in Buenos Aires. The four-man commando group, travelling in three cars, moved southwards along the main roads. The mines were carried in a bag in the boot of a car, despite their telltale shape and appearance. While plausible cover stories could be invented for the specialised military scuba gear, there was no way to explain the explosives, and the team was careful to avoid the Spanish police on the roads.

The operatives travelled to the south of Spain separately; Nicoletti went ahead as a scout, the other two cars ten minutes apart. They had no way to communicate between cars except visually. Nicoletti encountered a police checkpoint and turned around to warn his accomplices, but even though he signalled them, the first car behind him did not see him and continued until the checkpoint and turned around. They all met up again, their U-turns having gone unnoticed by the police officers manning the checkpoint. They then continued south using minor roads to minimise the chance of running into police again.

=== Algeciras ===
When they were near Algeciras, they booked separately into three different hotels in the town, and changed hotels often over the next few weeks. They paid their bills weekly in cash, which after a while raised suspicions, leading to their arrest. They kept the explosives in one of the cars and used only the other two for transport. For the first few days, they surveyed Algeciras Bay in search of the best place to enter the water and to observe maritime traffic in and out of Gibraltar. There was not as much British security in Gibraltar as they had expected: two sentry posts were unmanned, and only one small Royal Navy patrol craft was observed guarding the waters of the port.

They bought an inflatable raft to cross part of the bay, and a telescope and fishing tackle to give cover to their activities. The plan was to enter the water at 18:00, swim across, plant the mines around midnight, and swim back by about 05:00. The mines would explode a short while afterwards. They would then drive north to Barcelona, cross into France, then Italy, and fly back to Argentina from there.

=== Aborted attempts ===
The first opportunity came when a British minesweeper entered Gibraltar, but Anaya did not consider the target worth the effort. A few days later, Nicoletti suggested sinking a large oil tanker with non-British flag, as it would block the port of Gibraltar, but Anaya decided against it, since an oil spill and environmental disaster could provoke outrage in Spain, especially if it damaged the tourism industry, and could affect other Mediterranean countries.

For weeks, the commandos continued their routine of changing hotels and renewing their car rental. At the time, the British task force was already sailing south towards the Falklands. Finally, a high-value target, the frigate , arrived in Gibraltar on 2 May 1982, but Anaya again refused permission to attack it, this time because Peruvian President Fernando Belaúnde had just produced a comprehensive peace plan that Anaya believed might produce a peaceful resolution to the conflict, which could be undermined by a successful attack in Gibraltar.

Later that day, the Argentine cruiser was attacked and sunk by the British attack submarine , with substantial loss of life to the Argentine armed forces. The following day, 3 May, Nicoletti anticipated that permission would now be granted by Anaya as fighting had now had broken out in the South Atlantic Ocean, and asked if the team could claim to be acting for the Argentine military if they were caught. This was refused but they were ordered to execute the plan of attack.

== Outcome ==

=== Capture ===
The following day, Nicoletti slept late, as he usually did because the plan was to act at night, while Latorre and Rosales went to the car rental agency to extend the rental for another week. The owner of the rental business, Manuel Rojas, had become suspicious on previous encounters. He noticed that the man had keys with him for cars rented in other car rental businesses, that he always paid in cash using US dollars and that he never came in exactly when he said he would but rather would come in earlier or later.

Rojas had contacted the police, who asked him to call them next time the man came by and to try to keep him there until they arrived. Rojas notified the police and the men were arrested. The police then went to arrest the other two men and they found Nicoletti and Marciano still asleep. The police initially thought they had apprehended a gang of common criminals but, in spite of the orders not to do so, Nicoletti soon told police that they were Argentine agents.

The Minister of Interior, Juan José Rosón, instructed Málaga police chief Miguel Catalán to keep the arrests secret. The Spanish government decided to expel the four men without penalty or prosecution to avoid publicity. The police were ordered to take the arrested men to Málaga. Nicoletti said that once the police realized they were not common criminals, their attitude changed and became more favourable. The police let Nicoletti handle the explosives, as he had training while the police had none. Then Nicoletti invited them to lunch, so the police convoy, still carrying the explosives, stopped at a roadside restaurant. Then they went to pick up some clothes at a dry cleaners and finally headed for the Málaga police headquarters.

=== Deportation ===
By coincidence, Prime Minister Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo was campaigning in Málaga and ordered the men quietly flown to Madrid in an airplane chartered for his campaign. The men were not interrogated or put on trial. They were flown to Madrid and on to the Canary Islands under police custody, and finally put on a flight to Buenos Aires unaccompanied and using the same passports, now known to be false. Spain had recently joined NATO and Sotelo did not want not to create tensions with the UK or with Argentina; quietly returning the men to Argentina seemed the best course.

The operation was handled entirely by the Spanish police and Ministry of the Interior; the CESID (Spanish military intelligence agency) was not informed or involved. The operation was kept secret by all participants, who did not discuss it for years. The Spanish police were ordered to destroy all associated records. At the last minute, when the men were already at the airport, the police chief realised they had not taken the men&#x27;s identification information and called to order photos of the men taken. At the airport, the police officers thought it would look awkward to take mug shots in public, and a friendly group photo of the commandos with the police guarding them was taken. This photo has not been found.

== Aftermath ==
An October 1983 article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; titled &quot;How Argentina tried to blow up the Rock&quot; exposes the basic plot but contains various errors due to the limited information about the operation available at the time.

A 2003 documentary featured interviews with Anaya, Nicoletti and other participants. In one interview, Nigel West, a British writer who specialises in covert operations, claimed that the UK, aware of the covert plans thanks to telephone taps of conversations between Argentina and its embassy in Madrid, had informed Spanish authorities of the operation ahead of time.

<doc id="1186896" wikidata="Q4748472" url="?curid=1186896" title="Ample line bundle">
<text>In mathematics, a distinctive feature of algebraic geometry is that some line bundles on a projective variety can be considered &quot;positive&quot;, while others are &quot;negative&quot; (or a mixture of the two). The most important notion of positivity is that of an ample line bundle, although there are several related classes of line bundles. Roughly speaking, positivity properties of a line bundle are related to having many global sections. Understanding the ample line bundles on a given variety formula_1 amounts to understanding the different ways of mapping formula_1 into projective spaces. In view of the correspondence between line bundles and divisors (built from codimension-1 subvarieties), there is an equivalent notion of an ample divisor.

In more detail, a line bundle is called basepoint-free if it has enough sections to give a morphism to projective space. A line bundle is semi-ample if some positive power of it is basepoint-free; semi-ampleness is a kind of &quot;nonnegativity&quot;. More strongly, a line bundle on a complete variety formula_1 is very ample if it has enough sections to give a closed immersion (or &quot;embedding&quot;) of formula_1 into a projective space. A line bundle is ample if some positive power is very ample.

An ample line bundle on a projective variety formula_1 has positive degree on every curve in formula_1. The converse is not quite true, but there are corrected versions of the converse, the Nakai–Moishezon and Kleiman criteria for ampleness.

==Introduction==
===Pullback of a line bundle and hyperplane divisors===
Given a morphism formula_7 of schemes, a vector bundle formula_8 (or more generally a coherent sheaf on formula_9) has a pullback to formula_1, formula_11 where the projection formula_12 is the projection on the first coordinate (see Sheaf of modules#Operations). The pullback of a vector bundle is a vector bundle of the same rank. In particular, the pullback of a line bundle is a line bundle. (Briefly, the fiber of formula_13 at a point formula_14 is the fiber of formula_15 at formula_16.)

The notions described in this article are related to this construction in the case of a morphism to projective space
:formula_17
with formula_18 the line bundle on projective space whose global sections are the homogeneous polynomials of degree 1 (that is, linear functions) in variables formula_19. The line bundle formula_20 can also be described as the line bundle associated to a hyperplane in formula_21 (because the zero set of a section of formula_20 is a hyperplane). If formula_23 is a closed immersion, for example, it follows that the pullback formula_24 is the line bundle on formula_1 associated to a hyperplane section (the intersection of formula_1 with a hyperplane in formula_27).

===Basepoint-free line bundles===
Let formula_1 be a scheme over a field formula_29 (for example, an algebraic variety) with a line bundle formula_30. (A line bundle may also be called an invertible sheaf.) Let formula_31 be elements of the formula_29-vector space formula_33 of global sections of formula_30. The zero set of each section is a closed subset of formula_1; let formula_36 be the open subset of points at which at least one of formula_37 is not zero. Then these sections define a morphism
:formula_38

In more detail: for each point formula_39 of formula_36, the fiber of formula_30 over formula_39 is a 1-dimensional vector space over the residue field formula_43. Choosing a basis for this fiber makes formula_44 into a sequence of formula_45 numbers, not all zero, and hence a point in projective space. Changing the choice of basis scales all the numbers by the same nonzero constant, and so the point in projective space is independent of the choice.

Moreover, this morphism has the property that the restriction of formula_30 to formula_36 is isomorphic to the pullback formula_48.

The base locus of a line bundle formula_30 on a scheme formula_1 is the intersection of the zero sets of all global sections of formula_30. A line bundle formula_30 is called basepoint-free if its base locus is empty. That is, for every point formula_39 of formula_1 there is a global section of formula_30 which is nonzero at formula_39. If formula_1 is proper over a field formula_29, then the vector space formula_33 of global sections has finite dimension; the dimension is called formula_60. So a basepoint-free line bundle formula_30 determines a morphism formula_62 over formula_29, where formula_64, given by choosing a basis for formula_33. Without making a choice, this can be described as the morphism
:formula_66
from formula_1 to the space of hyperplanes in formula_33, canonically associated to the basepoint-free line bundle formula_30. This morphism has the property that formula_30 is the pullback formula_48.

Conversely, for any morphism formula_23 from a scheme formula_1 to a projective space formula_27 over formula_29, the pullback line bundle formula_48 is basepoint-free. Indeed, formula_20 is basepoint-free on formula_27, because for every point formula_79 in formula_27 there is a hyperplane not containing formula_79. Therefore, for every point formula_39 in formula_1, there is a section formula_84 of formula_20 over formula_27 that is not zero at formula_87, and the pullback of formula_84 is a global section of formula_48 that is not zero at formula_39. In short, basepoint-free line bundles are exactly those that can be expressed as the pullback of formula_20 by some morphism to a projective space.

===Nef, globally generated, semi-ample===
The degree of a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper curve &quot;C&quot; over &quot;k&quot; is defined as the degree of the divisor (&quot;s&quot;) of any nonzero rational section &quot;s&quot; of &quot;L&quot;. The coefficients of this divisor are positive at points where &quot;s&quot; vanishes and negative where &quot;s&quot; has a pole. Therefore, any line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a curve &quot;C&quot; such that formula_92 has nonnegative degree (because sections of &quot;L&quot; over &quot;C&quot;, as opposed to rational sections, have no poles). In particular, every basepoint-free line bundle on a curve has nonnegative degree. As a result, a basepoint-free line bundle &quot;L&quot; on any proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field is nef, meaning that &quot;L&quot; has nonnegative degree on every (irreducible) curve in &quot;X&quot;.

More generally, a sheaf &quot;F&quot; of formula_93-modules on a scheme &quot;X&quot; is said to be globally generated if there is a set &quot;I&quot; of global sections formula_94 such that the corresponding morphism
:formula_95
of sheaves is surjective. A line bundle is globally generated if and only if it is basepoint-free.

For example, every quasi-coherent sheaf on an affine scheme is globally generated. Analogously, in complex geometry, Cartan&#x27;s theorem A says that every coherent sheaf on a Stein manifold is globally generated.

A line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper scheme over a field is semi-ample if there is a positive integer &quot;r&quot; such that the tensor power formula_96 is basepoint-free. A semi-ample line bundle is nef (by the corresponding fact for basepoint-free line bundles).

===Very ample line bundles===
A line bundle formula_30 on a proper scheme formula_1 over a field formula_29 is said to be very ample if it is basepoint-free and the associated morphism
:formula_100
is an immersion. Here formula_64. Equivalently, formula_30 is very ample if formula_1 can be embedded into a projective space of some dimension over formula_29 in such a way that formula_30 is the restriction of the line bundle formula_20 to formula_1. The latter definition is used to define very ampleness for a line bundle on a proper scheme over any commutative ring.

The name &quot;very ample&quot; was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in 1961. Various names had been used earlier in the context of linear systems of divisors.

For a very ample line bundle formula_30 on a proper scheme formula_1 over a field with associated morphism formula_23, the degree of formula_30 on a curve formula_112 in formula_1 is the degree of formula_114 as a curve in formula_27. So formula_30 has positive degree on every curve in formula_1 (because every subvariety of projective space has positive degree).

== Definitions ==

=== Ample invertible sheaves on quasi-compact schemes ===
Ample line bundles are used most often on proper schemes, but they can be defined in much wider generality.

Let &quot;X&quot; be a scheme, and let formula_118 be an invertible sheaf on &quot;X&quot;. For each formula_119, let formula_120 denote the ideal sheaf of the reduced subscheme supported only at &quot;x&quot;. For formula_121, define
formula_122
Equivalently, if formula_123 denotes the residue field at &quot;x&quot; (considered as a skyscraper sheaf supported at &quot;x&quot;), then
formula_124
where formula_125 is the image of &quot;s&quot; in the tensor product.

Fix formula_121. For every &quot;s&quot;, the restriction formula_127 is a free formula_128-module trivialized by the restriction of &quot;s&quot;, meaning the multiplication-by-s morphism formula_129 is an isomorphism. The set formula_130 is always open, and the inclusion morphism formula_131 is an affine morphism. Despite this, formula_130 need not be an affine scheme. For example, if formula_133, then formula_134 is open in itself and affine over itself but generally not affine.

Assume &quot;X&quot; is quasi-compact. Then formula_118 is ample if, for every formula_119, there exists an formula_137 and an formula_138 such that formula_139 and formula_130 is an affine scheme. For example, the trivial line bundle formula_128 is ample if and only if &quot;X&quot; is quasi-affine.

In general, it is not true that every formula_130 is affine. For example, if formula_143 for some point &quot;O&quot;, and if formula_118 is the restriction of formula_145 to &quot;X&quot;, then formula_118 and formula_145 have the same global sections, and the non-vanishing locus of a section of formula_118 is affine if and only if the corresponding section of formula_145 contains &quot;O&quot;.

It is necessary to allow powers of formula_118 in the definition. In fact, for every &quot;N&quot;, it is possible that formula_130 is non-affine for every formula_138 with formula_153. Indeed, suppose &quot;Z&quot; is a finite set of points in formula_154, formula_155, and formula_156. The vanishing loci of the sections of formula_157 are plane curves of degree &quot;N&quot;. By taking &quot;Z&quot; to be a sufficiently large set of points in general position, we may ensure that no plane curve of degree &quot;N&quot; (and hence any lower degree) contains all the points of &quot;Z&quot;. In particular their non-vanishing loci are all non-affine.

Define formula_158. Let formula_159 denote the structural morphism. There is a natural isomorphism between formula_128-algebra homomorphisms formula_161 and endomorphisms of the graded ring &quot;S&quot;. The identity endomorphism of &quot;S&quot; corresponds to a homomorphism formula_162. Applying the formula_163 functor produces a morphism from an open subscheme of &quot;X&quot;, denoted formula_164, to formula_165.

The basic characterization of ample invertible sheaves states that if &quot;X&quot; is a quasi-compact quasi-separated scheme and formula_118 is an invertible sheaf on &quot;X&quot;, then the following assertions are equivalent:
# formula_118 is ample.
# The open sets formula_130, where formula_138 and formula_170, form a basis for the topology of &quot;X&quot;.
# The open sets formula_130 with the property of being affine, where formula_138 and formula_170, form a basis for the topology of &quot;X&quot;.
# formula_174 and the morphism formula_175 is a dominant open immersion.
# formula_174 and the morphism formula_175 is a homeomorphism of the underlying topological space of &quot;X&quot; with its image.
# For every quasi-coherent sheaf formula_178 on &quot;X&quot;, the canonical map formula_179 is surjective.
# For every quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals formula_180 on &quot;X&quot;, the canonical map formula_181 is surjective.
# For every quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals formula_180 on &quot;X&quot;, the canonical map formula_181 is surjective.
# For every quasi-coherent sheaf formula_178 of finite type on &quot;X&quot;, there exists an integer formula_185 such that for formula_186, formula_187 is generated by its global sections.
# For every quasi-coherent sheaf formula_178 of finite type on &quot;X&quot;, there exists integers formula_189 and formula_190 such that formula_178 is isomorphic to a quotient of formula_192.
# For every quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals formula_180 of finite type on &quot;X&quot;, there exists integers formula_189 and formula_190 such that formula_180 is isomorphic to a quotient of formula_192.

=== On proper schemes ===
When &quot;X&quot; is separated and finite type over an affine scheme, an invertible sheaf formula_118 is ample if and only if there exists a positive integer &quot;r&quot; such that the tensor power formula_199 is very ample. In particular, a proper scheme over &quot;R&quot; has an ample line bundle if and only if it is projective over &quot;R&quot;. Often, this characterization is taken as the definition of ampleness.

The rest of this article will concentrate on ampleness on proper schemes over a field, as this is the most important case. An ample line bundle on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field has positive degree on every curve in &quot;X&quot;, by the corresponding statement for very ample line bundles.

A Cartier divisor &quot;D&quot; on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; is said to be ample if the corresponding line bundle &quot;O&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is ample. (For example, if &quot;X&quot; is smooth over &quot;k&quot;, then a Cartier divisor can be identified with a finite linear combination of closed codimension-1 subvarieties of &quot;X&quot; with integer coefficients.)

Weakening the notion of &quot;very ample&quot; to &quot;ample&quot; gives a flexible concept with a wide variety of different characterizations. A first point is that tensoring high powers of an ample line bundle with any coherent sheaf whatsoever gives a sheaf with many global sections. More precisely, a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field (or more generally over a Noetherian ring) is ample if and only if for every coherent sheaf &quot;F&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, there is an integer &quot;s&quot; such that the sheaf formula_200 is globally generated for all formula_201. Here &quot;s&quot; may depend on &quot;F&quot;.

Another characterization of ampleness, known as the Cartan–Serre–Grothendieck theorem, is in terms of coherent sheaf cohomology. Namely, a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field (or more generally over a Noetherian ring) is ample if and only if for every coherent sheaf &quot;F&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, there is an integer &quot;s&quot; such that
:formula_202
for all formula_203 and all formula_201. In particular, high powers of an ample line bundle kill cohomology in positive degrees. This implication is called the Serre vanishing theorem, proved by Jean-Pierre Serre in his 1955 paper Faisceaux algébriques cohérents.

==Examples/Non-examples==
* The trivial line bundle formula_93 on a projective variety &quot;X&quot; of positive dimension is basepoint-free but not ample. More generally, for any morphism &quot;f&quot; from a projective variety &quot;X&quot; to some projective space formula_27 over a field, the pullback line bundle formula_207 is always basepoint-free, whereas &quot;L&quot; is ample if and only if the morphism &quot;f&quot; is finite (that is, all fibers of &quot;f&quot; have dimension 0 or are empty).
* For an integer &quot;d&quot;, the space of sections of the line bundle &quot;O&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) over formula_208 is the complex vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree &quot;d&quot; in variables &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;. In particular, this space is zero for &quot;d&quot; &lt; 0. For formula_209, the morphism to projective space given by &quot;O&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) is
::formula_210
:by
::formula_211
:This is a closed immersion for formula_212, with image a rational normal curve of degree &quot;d&quot; in formula_213. Therefore, &quot;O&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) is basepoint-free if and only if formula_209, and very ample if and only if formula_212. It follows that &quot;O&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) is ample if and only if formula_212.
* For an example where &quot;ample&quot; and &quot;very ample&quot; are different, let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth projective curve of genus 1 (an elliptic curve) over C, and let &quot;p&quot; be a complex point of &quot;X&quot;. Let &quot;O&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) be the associated line bundle of degree 1 on &quot;X&quot;. Then the complex vector space of global sections of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) has dimension 1, spanned by a section that vanishes at &quot;p&quot;. So the base locus of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is equal to &quot;p&quot;. On the other hand, &quot;O&quot;(2&quot;p&quot;) is basepoint-free, and &quot;O&quot;(&quot;dp&quot;) is very ample for formula_217 (giving an embedding of &quot;X&quot; as an elliptic curve of degree &quot;d&quot; in formula_218). Therefore, &quot;O&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) is ample but not very ample. Also, &quot;O&quot;(2&quot;p&quot;) is ample and basepoint-free but not very ample; the associated morphism to projective space is a ramified double cover formula_219.
* On curves of higher genus, there are ample line bundles &quot;L&quot; for which every global section is zero. (But high multiples of &quot;L&quot; have many sections, by definition.) For example, let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth plane quartic curve (of degree 4 in formula_220) over C, and let &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; be distinct complex points of &quot;X&quot;. Then the line bundle formula_221 is ample but has formula_222.

==Criteria for ampleness of line bundles==
===Intersection theory===
To determine whether a given line bundle on a projective variety &quot;X&quot; is ample, the following &quot;numerical criteria&quot; (in terms of intersection numbers) are often the most useful. It is equivalent to ask when a Cartier divisor &quot;D&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is ample, meaning that the associated line bundle &quot;O&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) is ample. The intersection number formula_223 can be defined as the degree of the line bundle &quot;O&quot;(&quot;D&quot;) restricted to &quot;C&quot;. In the other direction, for a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a projective variety, the first Chern class formula_224 means the associated Cartier divisor (defined up to linear equivalence), the divisor of any nonzero rational section of &quot;L&quot;.

On a smooth projective curve &quot;X&quot; over an algebraically closed field &quot;k&quot;, a line bundle &quot;L&quot; is very ample if and only if formula_225 for all &quot;k&quot;-rational points &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Let &quot;g&quot; be the genus of &quot;X&quot;. By the Riemann–Roch theorem, every line bundle of degree at least 2&quot;g&quot; + 1 satisfies this condition and hence is very ample. As a result, a line bundle on a curve is ample if and only if it has positive degree.

For example, the canonical bundle formula_226 of a curve &quot;X&quot; has degree 2&quot;g&quot; − 2, and so it is ample if and only if formula_227. The curves with ample canonical bundle form an important class; for example, over the complex numbers, these are the curves with a metric of negative curvature. The canonical bundle is very ample if and only if formula_227 and the curve is not hyperelliptic.

The Nakai–Moishezon criterion (named for Yoshikazu Nakai (1963) and Boris Moishezon (1964)) states that a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field is ample if and only if formula_229 for every (irreducible) closed subvariety &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; (&quot;Y&quot; is not allowed to be a point). In terms of divisors, a Cartier divisor &quot;D&quot; is ample if and only if formula_230 for every (nonzero-dimensional) subvariety &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;. For &quot;X&quot; a curve, this says that a divisor is ample if and only if it has positive degree. For &quot;X&quot; a surface, the criterion says that a divisor &quot;D&quot; is ample if and only if its self-intersection number formula_231 is positive and every curve &quot;C&quot; on &quot;X&quot; has formula_232.

===Kleiman&#x27;s criterion===
To state Kleiman&#x27;s criterion (1966), let &quot;X&quot; be a projective scheme over a field. Let formula_233 be the real vector space of 1-cycles (real linear combinations of curves in &quot;X&quot;) modulo numerical equivalence, meaning that two 1-cycles &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are equal in formula_233 if and only if every line bundle has the same degree on &quot;A&quot; and on &quot;B&quot;. By the Néron–Severi theorem, the real vector space formula_233 has finite dimension. Kleiman&#x27;s criterion states that a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is ample if and only if &quot;L&quot; has positive degree on every nonzero element &quot;C&quot; of the closure of the cone of curves NE(&quot;X&quot;) in formula_233. (This is slightly stronger than saying that &quot;L&quot; has positive degree on every curve.) Equivalently, a line bundle is ample if and only if its class in the dual vector space formula_237 is in the interior of the nef cone.

Kleiman&#x27;s criterion fails in general for proper (rather than projective) schemes &quot;X&quot; over a field, although it holds if &quot;X&quot; is smooth or more generally Q-factorial.

A line bundle on a projective variety is called strictly nef if it has positive degree on every curve. and David Mumford constructed line bundles on smooth projective surfaces that are strictly nef but not ample. This shows that the condition formula_238 cannot be omitted in the Nakai–Moishezon criterion, and it is necessary to use the closure of NE(&quot;X&quot;) rather than NE(&quot;X&quot;) in Kleiman&#x27;s criterion. Every nef line bundle on a surface has formula_239, and Nagata and Mumford&#x27;s examples have formula_240.

C. S. Seshadri showed that a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper scheme over an algebraically closed field is ample if and only if there is a positive real number ε such that deg(&quot;L&quot;|&quot;C&quot;) ≥ ε&quot;m&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) for all (irreducible) curves &quot;C&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, where &quot;m&quot;(&quot;C&quot;) is the maximum of the multiplicities at the points of &quot;C&quot;.

Several characterizations of ampleness hold more generally for line bundles on a proper algebraic space over a field &quot;k&quot;. In particular, the Nakai-Moishezon criterion is valid in that generality. The Cartan-Serre-Grothendieck criterion holds even more generally, for a proper algebraic space over a Noetherian ring &quot;R&quot;. (If a proper algebraic space over &quot;R&quot; has an ample line bundle, then it is in fact a projective scheme over &quot;R&quot;.) Kleiman&#x27;s criterion fails for proper algebraic spaces &quot;X&quot; over a field, even if &quot;X&quot; is smooth.

===Openness of ampleness===
On a projective scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field, Kleiman&#x27;s criterion implies that ampleness is an open condition on the class of an R-divisor (an R-linear combination of Cartier divisors) in formula_237, with its topology based on the topology of the real numbers. (An R-divisor is defined to be ample if it can be written as a positive linear combination of ample Cartier divisors.) An elementary special case is: for an ample divisor &quot;H&quot; and any divisor &quot;E&quot;, there is a positive real number &quot;b&quot; such that formula_242 is ample for all real numbers &quot;a&quot; of absolute value less than &quot;b&quot;. In terms of divisors with integer coefficients (or line bundles), this means that &quot;nH&quot; + &quot;E&quot; is ample for all sufficiently large positive integers &quot;n&quot;.

Ampleness is also an open condition in a quite different sense, when the variety or line bundle is varied in an algebraic family. Namely, let formula_243 be a proper morphism of schemes, and let &quot;L&quot; be a line bundle on &quot;X&quot;. Then the set of points &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; is ample on the fiber formula_244 is open (in the Zariski topology). More strongly, if &quot;L&quot; is ample on one fiber formula_244, then there is an affine open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;L&quot; is ample on formula_246 over &quot;U&quot;.

===Kleiman&#x27;s other characterizations of ampleness===
Kleiman also proved the following characterizations of ampleness, which can be viewed as intermediate steps between the definition of ampleness and numerical criteria. Namely, for a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field, the following are equivalent:
* &quot;L&quot; is ample.
* For every (irreducible) subvariety formula_247 of positive dimension, there is a positive integer &quot;r&quot; and a section formula_248 which is not identically zero but vanishes at some point of &quot;Y&quot;.
* For every (irreducible) subvariety formula_247 of positive dimension, the holomorphic Euler characteristics of powers of &quot;L&quot; on &quot;Y&quot; go to infinity:
::formula_250 as formula_251.

==Generalizations==
===Ample vector bundles===
Robin Hartshorne defined a vector bundle &quot;F&quot; on a projective scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field to be ample if the line bundle formula_20 on the space formula_253 of hyperplanes in &quot;F&quot; is ample.

Several properties of ample line bundles extend to ample vector bundles. For example, a vector bundle &quot;F&quot; is ample if and only if high symmetric powers of &quot;F&quot; kill the cohomology formula_254 of coherent sheaves for all formula_203. Also, the Chern class formula_256 of an ample vector bundle has positive degree on every &quot;r&quot;-dimensional subvariety of &quot;X&quot;, for formula_257.

===Big line bundles===

A useful weakening of ampleness, notably in birational geometry, is the notion of a big line bundle. A line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a projective variety &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; over a field is said to be big if there is a positive real number &quot;a&quot; and a positive integer formula_258 such that formula_259 for all formula_260. This is the maximum possible growth rate for the spaces of sections of powers of &quot;L&quot;, in the sense that for every line bundle &quot;L&quot; on &quot;X&quot; there is a positive number &quot;b&quot; with formula_261 for all &quot;j&quot; &gt; 0.

There are several other characterizations of big line bundles. First, a line bundle is big if and only if there is a positive integer &quot;r&quot; such that the rational map from &quot;X&quot; to formula_262 given by the sections of formula_96 is birational onto its image. Also, a line bundle &quot;L&quot; is big if and only if it has a positive tensor power which is the tensor product of an ample line bundle &quot;A&quot; and an effective line bundle &quot;B&quot; (meaning that formula_264). Finally, a line bundle is big if and only if its class in formula_237 is in the interior of the cone of effective divisors.

Bigness can be viewed as a birationally invariant analog of ampleness. For example, if formula_243 is a dominant rational map between smooth projective varieties of the same dimension, then the pullback of a big line bundle on &quot;Y&quot; is big on &quot;X&quot;. (At first sight, the pullback is only a line bundle on the open subset of &quot;X&quot; where &quot;f&quot; is a morphism, but this extends uniquely to a line bundle on all of &quot;X&quot;.) For ample line bundles, one can only say that the pullback of an ample line bundle by a finite morphism is ample.

Example: Let &quot;X&quot; be the blow-up of the projective plane formula_220 at a point over the complex numbers. Let &quot;H&quot; be the pullback to &quot;X&quot; of a line on formula_220, and let &quot;E&quot; be the exceptional curve of the blow-up formula_269. Then the divisor &quot;H&quot; + &quot;E&quot; is big but not ample (or even nef) on &quot;X&quot;, because
:formula_270

This negativity also implies that the base locus of &quot;H&quot; + &quot;E&quot; (or of any positive multiple) contains the curve &quot;E&quot;. In fact, this base locus is equal to &quot;E&quot;.

== Relative ampleness ==
Given a quasi-compact morphism of schemes formula_271, an invertible sheaf &quot;L&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is said to be ample relative to &quot;f&quot; or &quot;f&quot;-ample if the following equivalent conditions are met:
# For each open affine subset formula_272, the restriction of &quot;L&quot; to formula_246 is ample (in the usual sense).
# &quot;f&quot; is quasi-separated and there is an open immersion formula_274 induced by the adjunction map:
#:formula_275.
# The condition 2. without &quot;open&quot;.

The condition 2 says (roughly) that &quot;X&quot; can be openly compactified to a projective scheme with formula_276 (not just to a proper scheme).

<text>The Communications Act 2003 (c. 21) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The act, which came into force on 25 July 2003, superseded the Telecommunications Act 1984. The new act was the responsibility of Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. It consolidated the telecommunication and broadcasting regulators in the UK, introducing the Office of Communications (Ofcom) as the new industry regulator. On 28 December 2003 Ofcom gained its full regulatory powers, inheriting the duties of the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel). Among other measures, the act introduced legal recognition of community radio and paved the way for full-time community radio services in the UK, as well as controversially lifting many restrictions on cross-media ownership. It also made it illegal to use other people&#x27;s Wi-Fi broadband connections without their permission. In addition, the legislation also allowed for the first time non-European entities to wholly own a British television company.

== Provisions of the act ==
The act has a large number of provisions, including the following:

* Dishonestly obtaining access to the Internet with no intention to pay for the service was made a criminal offence.
* Sending a malicious communication using social media was made a criminal offence. 
* The Independent Television Commission, Radio Authority, Office of Telecommunications, and Radiocommunications Agency were merged into Ofcom.
* The telecommunications licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement, while BT retained its universal service obligation.
* It was declared an offence to &quot;persistently make use of a public electronic communications network for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety&quot;. Ofcom subsequently developed policies to reduce the number of silent telephone calls.
* The public service remit for Channel 4 was revised.
* Broadcasters were required to make a proportion of television programmes outside the London area (defined as outside the M25).
* Restrictions on ITV company ownership were lifted, aside from &quot;public interest&quot; test that was added as an amendment in the House of Lords. The result was the formation of a single entity ITV plc controlling all of the ITV franchises in England and Wales in February 2004.
* The limit on the proportion of ITN that any ITV operating company could own was abolished.
* Broadcasters were required to carry a &quot;suitable quantity and range of programmes&quot; dealing with religion and other beliefs, as part of their public service broadcasting.
* Political advertising on television or radio was prohibited.
*Ofcom given the responsibility to &#x27;promote&#x27; media literacy.
* The Gaelic Media Service (now MG ALBA) was created &quot;to secure that a wide and diverse range of high quality programmes in Gaelic are broadcast or otherwise transmitted so as to be available to persons in Scotland&quot;.
* Community radio stations were recognised as a distinct third tier of radio alongside BBC Radio and commercial radio.
* The authority for the BBC to collect the licence fee was set out.
* Provision was made for the requirements for blind and deaf television viewers. This has subsequently included sign language, subtitles and audio description.
* The Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice was established as the regulatory body ensuring that advertising on radio and television is not misleading, harmful, offensive, or beyond the boundaries of taste and decency.

== Wi-Fi ==

It is an offence under section 125 of the act to obtain access to the Internet when there is no intention to pay for that service. The legislation was intended to prevent the major defrauding of communications companies. Nevertheless, the individual practice of piggybacking (the illicit use of a Wi-Fi connection to access another subscriber&#x27;s Internet service) was demonstrated to be a contravention of the act by &quot;R v Straszkiewicz&quot; in 2005. There have been subsequent arrests for the practice. Piggybacking may also be a breach of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Section 125 of the act has been criticised for its vagueness, resulting in the possibility that many users of portable Wi-Fi enabled devices are inadvertently breaching it.

== Malicious communications ==

Section 127 (1) of the act makes it an offence to send a message that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character over a public electronic communications network. The section replaced section 43 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 and is drafted as widely as its predecessor. The section has been used controversially to prosecute users of social media in cases such as the Twitter Joke Trial and Facebook comments concerning the murder of April Jones. Section 127 is a summary offence, so it is tried in a magistrates court with no right to jury trial. 

On 19 December 2012, to strike a balance between freedom of speech and criminality, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued interim guidelines, clarifying when social messaging is eligible for criminal prosecution under UK law. Only communications that are credible threats of violence, harassment, or stalking (such as aggressive Internet trolling) which specifically targets an individual or individuals or breaches a court order designed to protect someone (such as those protecting the identity of a victim of a sexual offence) will be prosecuted. Communications that express an &quot;unpopular or unfashionable opinion about serious or trivial matters, or banter or humour, even if distasteful to some and painful to those subjected to it&quot; will not. Communications that are merely &quot;grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false&quot; will be prosecuted only when it can be shown to be necessary and proportionate. People who pass on malicious messages, such as by retweeting, can also be prosecuted when the original message is subject to prosecution. Individuals who post messages as part of a separate crime, such as a plan to import drugs, would face prosecution for that offence, as is currently the case.

Revisions to the interim guidelines were issued on 20 June 2013 following a public consultation. The revisions specified that prosecutors should consider:
* whether messages were aggravated by references to race, religion or other minorities, and whether they breached existing rules to counter harassment or stalking; and
* the age and maturity of any wrongdoer should be taken into account and given great weight.
The revisions also clarified that criminal prosecutions were &quot;unlikely&quot;: 
* when the author of the message had &quot;expressed genuine remorse&quot;;
* when &quot;swift and effective action ... to remove the communication&quot; was taken; or
* when messages were not intended for a wide audience.

More recently, Section 127 has been used to prosecute those alleged to have sent grossly offensive messages on a public electronic communications network, such as WhatsApp, but which were not visible to an audience beyond the intended recipients. In 2022, a serving police officer and a former constable each received 12-week prison sentences for sending racist, misogynistic, ableist, and homophobic messages to a WhatsApp group. The group was uncovered as convicted murderer, and former police officer, Wayne Couzens had been a member. Six more former police officers, retired at the time of the offensive communications, pleaded guilty to a similar but unrelated WhatsApp group in September 2023. Such prosecutions are not without controversy since they treat encrypted messages, by their nature only visible to intended recipients, as public because they are sent using publicly available instant messaging platforms, rather than because the individual messages themselves are visible to the public. Andrew Tettenborn, a British legal academic, has argued that this criminalises speech which would not be illegal if spoken aloud in private conversation. 

The Law Commission, a public body which reviews and recommends changes to the law, recommended that Section 127 be replaced with new offences that are more targeted in their approach. This was intended to update legislation passed prior to the widespread use of instant messaging and to reduce concerns about limits on the freedom of expression. Though Online Safety Act 2023 adopted some of these proposals by repealing Section 127(2) and replacing it with two new offences: threatening communication and false communication, Section 127(1) pertaining to grossly offensive messages remains in force.

== Amendments to the act ==
*Regulations amended the act in 2009 and 2010, making Ofcom the co-regulator for video on demand in the UK, along with ATVOD and the Advertising Standards Authority.
* The Digital Economy Act 2010 amended the Communications Act 2003, giving Ofcom the responsibility of enforcing regulations concerning Internet copyright breaches.
* The Postal Services Act 2011 allowed Ofcom to take over regulatory responsibility for the Royal Mail from the Postal Services Commission.
* The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 amended the Communications Act 2003 to set out statutory and legal obligations for media distributors of on-demand content. The regulations define the content that can legally be distributed under an R18 certificate and make it a criminal offence to not adequately restrict access to such content to those aged over 18.
* The Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015 extended the time limits for bringing a prosecution under section 127.

==Notable prosecutions==
* 2012: Paul Chambers made a joke on Twitter in response to Robin Hood Airport cancelling flights. He said that unless the facility resolved the problem within a week, he would be &quot;blowing the airport sky high&quot;. After an off-duty manager discovered the post, Chambers was arrested by anti-terror police. He was found guilty, lost his job and was ordered to pay a £385 fine and £600 in costs. However, after a strong public outcry and three appeals, the case was eventually overturned.
*2014: A Lincolnshire man was charged with being grossly offensive after posting a photograph of a police officer on social media, with two phalluses drawn on it. The offending picture was passed on to Lincolnshire Police, who arrested the 20-year-old. He was ordered to pay £400 in compensation to the officer in question, in addition to £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
* 2017: &quot;R v Mwaikambo&quot; where a 43-year-old man posted one video and seven pictures of a victim of the Grenfell Tower fire to his Facebook account. Notable in this case was the rapidity of conviction: the fire occurred on 14 June and the case was heard but two days later. Mwaikambo was sentenced to three months in prison.
* 2018: Mark Meechan, a comedian and social commentator, was convicted under the Communications Act in 2018. He had made a video demonstrating how he had trained his girlfriend&#x27;s dog to perform a Nazi salute upon hearing the phrase &quot;Sieg Heil&quot; and to respond to being asked if he wanted to &quot;gas the Jews&quot;. Even though Meechan said that he was not actually racist and that it was a joke intended to annoy his girlfriend, the court found him guilty of being &quot;grossly offensive&quot; on 20 March. He was fined £800 at Airdrie Sheriff Court on 23 April 2018.
* 2018: A Merseyside woman was convicted under the Communications Act for posting rap lyrics on Instagram which were deemed &#x27;racist&#x27;, due to them including racially charged language. Chelsea Russell had used lyrics from a Snap Dogg song as a tribute to a boy who died in a road accident. She was sentenced to an eight-week community order, along with an eight-week curfew. She was also ordered to pay costs of £500 and an £85 victim surcharge. Her conviction was quashed on appeal in February 2019.
* 2020: Kate Scottow was convicted in February 2020 for tweeting &quot;transphobic&quot; insults. This conviction was quashed on appeal in December 2020.
* 2020: Conservative Party candidate Joshua Spencer was sentenced to 9 weeks in prison under section 127 for sending threatening messages to Yvette Cooper and her constituency staff.

<text>The Kollidam (referred to as Coleroon in Colonial English) is a river in southeastern India. The Kollidam is the northern distributary of the Kaveri River as it flows through the delta of Thanjavur. It splits from the main branch of the Kaveri River at the island of Srirangam and flows eastward into the Bay of Bengal. The distribution system in Kollidam lies at Lower Anaicut which is an island of river Kollidam.

Heavy floods in 2005 necessitated the flood prevention works along the Kollidam river by the Public Works Department (PWD).

<text>Erwin Mortier (born 28 November 1965) is a Dutch-language Belgian author. Spending his youth in Hansbeke, he later moved to nearby Ghent, where he became city poet (2005–2006).

He wrote as a columnist for newspapers like &quot;De Morgen&quot; and published several novels:
* &quot;Marcel&quot; (1999) – 
* &quot;My Fellow Skin&quot; – 
* &quot;Shutter Speed&quot; – 
* &quot;While the Gods Were Sleeping&quot; (2008)

Collections of his poetry were published from 2001 on.

Among the literary prizes awarded to Mortier there are debut prizes in Belgium and in the Netherlands for &quot;Marcel&quot;, in 2002 the C. Buddingh&#x27; prize for his debut in poetry, and in 2009 the AKO Literatuurprijs for &quot;While the Gods Were Sleeping&quot;.

Mortier came out of the closet with &quot;A plea for sinning&quot;, a collection of essays (2003). Other non-fiction included &quot;Evenings on the Estate: Travelling with Gerard Reve&quot; (2007), and &quot;A farewell to Congo: Back to the equator with Jef Geeraerts&quot; (2010).

He translated war prose by Ellen N. La Motte, Mary Borden and Enid Bagnold in Dutch, and produced the first Dutch translation of Virginia Woolf&#x27;s &quot;Between the Acts&quot;.

<text>Confocal microscopy, most frequently confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) or laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM), is an optical imaging technique for increasing optical resolution and contrast of a micrograph by means of using a spatial pinhole to block out-of-focus light in image formation. Capturing multiple two-dimensional images at different depths in a sample enables the reconstruction of three-dimensional structures (a process known as optical sectioning) within an object. This technique is used extensively in the scientific and industrial communities and typical applications are in life sciences, semiconductor inspection and materials science.

Light travels through the sample under a conventional microscope as far into the specimen as it can penetrate, while a confocal microscope only focuses a smaller beam of light at one narrow depth level at a time. The CLSM achieves a controlled and highly limited depth of field.

== Basic concept ==

The principle of confocal imaging was patented in 1957 by Marvin Minsky and aims to overcome some limitations of traditional wide-field fluorescence microscopes. In a conventional (i.e., wide-field) fluorescence microscope, the entire specimen is flooded evenly in light from a light source. All parts of the sample can be excited at the same time and the resulting fluorescence is detected by the microscope&#x27;s photodetector or camera including a large unfocused background part. In contrast, a confocal microscope uses point illumination (see Point Spread Function) and a pinhole in an optically conjugate plane in front of the detector to eliminate out-of-focus signal – the name &quot;confocal&quot; stems from this configuration. As only light produced by fluorescence very close to the focal plane can be detected, the image&#x27;s optical resolution, particularly in the sample depth direction, is much better than that of wide-field microscopes. However, as much of the light from sample fluorescence is blocked at the pinhole, this increased resolution is at the cost of decreased signal intensity – so long exposures are often required. To offset this drop in signal after the &quot;pinhole&quot;, the light intensity is detected by a sensitive detector, usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or avalanche photodiode, transforming the light signal into an electrical one.

As only one point in the sample is illuminated at a time, 2D or 3D imaging requires scanning over a regular raster (i.e. a rectangular pattern of parallel scanning lines) in the specimen. The beam is scanned across the sample in the horizontal plane by using one or more (servo controlled) oscillating mirrors. This scanning method usually has a low reaction latency and the scan speed can be varied. Slower scans provide a better signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in better contrast.

The achievable thickness of the focal plane is defined mostly by the wavelength of the used light divided by the numerical aperture of the objective lens, but also by the optical properties of the specimen. The thin optical sectioning possible makes these types of microscopes particularly good at 3D imaging and surface profiling of samples.

Successive slices make up a &#x27;z-stack&#x27;, which can either be processed to create a 3D image, or it is merged into a 2D stack (predominately the maximum pixel intensity is taken, other common methods include using the standard deviation or summing the pixels).

Confocal microscopy provides the capacity for direct, noninvasive, serial optical sectioning of intact, thick, living specimens with a minimum of sample preparation as well as a marginal improvement in lateral resolution compared to wide-field microscopy. Biological samples are often treated with fluorescent dyes to make selected objects visible. However, the actual dye concentration can be low to minimize the disturbance of biological systems: some instruments can track single fluorescent molecules. Also, transgenic techniques can create organisms that produce their own fluorescent chimeric molecules (such as a fusion of GFP, green fluorescent protein with the protein of interest). Confocal microscopes work on the principle of point excitation in the specimen (diffraction limited spot) and point detection of the resulting fluorescent signal. A pinhole at the detector provides a physical barrier that blocks out-of-focus fluorescence. Only the in-focus, or central spot of the Airy disk, is recorded.

== Techniques used for horizontal scanning ==

Four types of confocal microscopes are commercially available:

Confocal laser scanning microscopes use multiple mirrors (typically 2 or 3 scanning linearly along the x- and the y- axes) to scan the laser across the sample and &quot;descan&quot; the image across a fixed pinhole and detector. This process is usually slow and does not work for live imaging, but can be useful to create high-resolution representative images of fixed samples.

Spinning-disk (Nipkow disk) confocal microscopes use a series of moving pinholes on a disc to scan spots of light. Since a series of pinholes scans an area in parallel, each pinhole is allowed to hover over a specific area for a longer amount of time thereby reducing the excitation energy needed to illuminate a sample when compared to laser scanning microscopes. Decreased excitation energy reduces phototoxicity and photobleaching of a sample often making it the preferred system for imaging live cells or organisms.

Microlens enhanced or dual spinning-disk confocal microscopes work under the same principles as spinning-disk confocal microscopes except a second spinning-disk containing micro-lenses is placed before the spinning-disk containing the pinholes. Every pinhole has an associated microlens. The micro-lenses act to capture a broad band of light and focus it into each pinhole significantly increasing the amount of light directed into each pinhole and reducing the amount of light blocked by the spinning-disk. Microlens enhanced confocal microscopes are therefore significantly more sensitive than standard spinning-disk systems. Yokogawa Electric invented this technology in 1992.

Programmable array microscopes (PAM) use an electronically controlled spatial light modulator (SLM) that produces a set of moving pinholes. The SLM is a device containing an array of pixels with some property (opacity, reflectivity or optical rotation) of the individual pixels that can be adjusted electronically. The SLM contains microelectromechanical mirrors or liquid crystal components. The image is usually acquired by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera.

Each of these classes of confocal microscope have particular advantages and disadvantages. Most systems are either optimized for recording speed (i.e. video capture) or high spatial resolution. Confocal laser scanning microscopes can have a programmable sampling density and very high resolutions while Nipkow and PAM use a fixed sampling density defined by the camera&#x27;s resolution. Imaging frame rates are typically slower for single point laser scanning systems than spinning-disk or PAM systems. Commercial spinning-disk confocal microscopes achieve frame rates of over 50 per second – a desirable feature for dynamic observations such as live cell imaging.

In practice, Nipkow and PAM allow multiple pinholes scanning the same area in parallel as long as the pinholes are sufficiently far apart.

Cutting-edge development of confocal laser scanning microscopy now allows better than standard video rate (60 frames per second) imaging by using multiple microelectromechanical scanning mirrors.

Confocal X-ray fluorescence imaging is a newer technique that allows control over depth, in addition to horizontal and vertical aiming, for example, when analyzing buried layers in a painting.

==Resolution enhancement==

CLSM is a scanning imaging technique in which the resolution obtained is best explained by comparing it with another scanning technique like that of the scanning electron microscope (SEM). CLSM has the advantage of not requiring a probe to be suspended nanometers from the surface, as in an AFM or STM, for example, where the image is obtained by scanning with a fine tip over a surface. The distance from the objective lens to the surface (called the &quot;working distance&quot;) is typically comparable to that of a conventional optical microscope. It varies with the system optical design, but working distances from hundreds of micrometres to several millimeters are typical.

In CLSM a specimen is illuminated by a point laser source, and each volume element is associated with a discrete scattering or fluorescence intensity. Here, the size of the scanning volume is determined by the spot size (close to diffraction limit) of the optical system because the image of the scanning laser is not an infinitely small point but a three-dimensional diffraction pattern. The size of this diffraction pattern and the focal volume it defines is controlled by the numerical aperture of the system&#x27;s objective lens and the wavelength of the laser used. This can be seen as the classical resolution limit of conventional optical microscopes using wide-field illumination. However, with confocal microscopy it is even possible to improve on the resolution limit of wide-field illumination techniques because the confocal aperture can be closed down to eliminate higher orders of the diffraction pattern. For example, if the pinhole diameter is set to 1 Airy unit then only the first order of the diffraction pattern makes it through the aperture to the detector while the higher orders are blocked, thus improving resolution at the cost of a slight decrease in brightness. In fluorescence observations, the resolution limit of confocal microscopy is often limited by the signal-to-noise ratio caused by the small number of photons typically available in fluorescence microscopy. One can compensate for this effect by using more sensitive photodetectors or by increasing the intensity of the illuminating laser point source. Increasing the intensity of illumination laser risks excessive bleaching or other damage to the specimen of interest, especially for experiments in which comparison of fluorescence brightness is required. When imaging tissues that are differentially refractive, such as the spongy mesophyll of plant leaves or other air-space containing tissues, spherical aberrations that impair confocal image quality are often pronounced. Such aberrations however, can be significantly reduced by mounting samples in optically transparent, non-toxic perfluorocarbons such as perfluorodecalin, which readily infiltrates tissues and has a refractive index almost identical to that of water. When imaging in a reflection geometry, it is also possible to detect the interference of the reflected and scattered light of an object like an intracellular organelle. The interferometric nature of the signal allows to reduce the pinhole diameter down to 0.2 Airy units and therefore enables an ideal resolution enhancement of √2 without sacrificing the signal-to-noise ratio as in confocal fluorescence microscopy.

==Uses==

CLSM is widely used in various biological science disciplines, from cell biology and genetics to microbiology and developmental biology. It is also used in quantum optics and nano-crystal imaging and spectroscopy.

===Biology and medicine===
Clinically, CLSM is used in the evaluation of various eye diseases, and is particularly useful for imaging, qualitative analysis, and quantification of endothelial cells of the cornea. It is used for localizing and identifying the presence of filamentary fungal elements in the corneal stroma in cases of keratomycosis, enabling rapid diagnosis and thereby early institution of definitive therapy. Research into CLSM techniques for endoscopic procedures (endomicroscopy) is also showing promise. In the pharmaceutical industry, it was recommended to follow the manufacturing process of thin film pharmaceutical forms, to control the quality and uniformity of the drug distribution. Confocal microscopy is also used to study biofilms — complex porous structures that are the preferred habitat of microorganisms. Some of temporal and spatial function of biofilms can be understood only by studying their structure on micro- and meso-scales. The study of microscale is needed to detect the activity and organization of single microorganisms.

===Optics and crystallography===

CLSM is used as the data retrieval mechanism in some 3D optical data storage systems and has helped determine the age of the Magdalen papyrus.

===Audio preservation===

The IRENE system makes use of confocal microscopy for optical scanning and recovery of damaged historical audio.

=== Material&#x27;s surface characterization ===
Laser scanning confocal microscopes are used in the characterization of the surface of microstructured materials, such as Silicon wafers used in solar cell production. During the first processing steps, wafers are wet-chemically etch with acid or alkaline compounds, rendering a texture to their surface. Laser confocal microscopy is then used to observe the state of the resulting surface at the micrometer lever. Laser confocal microscopy can also be used to analyze the thickness and height of metallization fingers printed on top of solar cells.

==Variants and enhancements==

===Improving axial resolution===

The point spread function of the pinhole is an ellipsoid, several times as long as it is wide. This limits the axial resolution of the microscope. One technique of overcoming this is 4Pi microscopy where incident and or emitted light are allowed to interfere from both above and below the sample to reduce the volume of the ellipsoid. An alternative technique is confocal theta microscopy. In this technique the cone of illuminating light and detected light are at an angle to each other (best results when they are perpendicular). The intersection of the two point spread functions gives a much smaller effective sample volume. From this evolved the single plane illumination microscope. Additionally deconvolution may be employed using an experimentally derived point spread function to remove the out of focus light, improving contrast in both the axial and lateral planes.

===Super resolution===

There are confocal variants that achieve resolution below the diffraction limit such as stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED). Besides this technique a broad variety of other (not confocal based) super-resolution techniques are available like PALM, (d)STORM, SIM, and so on. They all have their own advantages such as ease of use, resolution, and the need for special equipment, buffers, or fluorophores.

===Low-temperature operability===

To image samples at low temperatures, two main approaches have been used, both based on the laser scanning confocal microscopy architecture. One approach is to use a continuous flow cryostat: only the sample is at low temperature and it is optically addressed through a transparent window. Another possible approach is to have part of the optics (especially the microscope objective) in a cryogenic storage dewar. This second approach, although more cumbersome, guarantees better mechanical stability and avoids the losses due to the window.

=== Molecular interaction ===
To study molecular interactions using the CLSM Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be used to confirm that two proteins are within a certain distance to one another.

== History ==

=== The beginnings: 1940–1957 ===

In 1940 Hans Goldmann, ophthalmologist in Bern, Switzerland, developed a slit lamp system to document eye examinations. This system is considered by some later authors as the first confocal optical system.

In 1943 Zyun Koana published a confocal system.

In 1951 Hiroto Naora, a colleague of Koana, described a confocal microscope in the journal Science for spectrophotometry.

The first confocal &quot;scanning&quot; microscope was built by Marvin Minsky in 1955 and a patent was filed in 1957. The scanning of the illumination point in the focal plane was achieved by moving the stage. No scientific publication was submitted and no images made with it were preserved.

=== The Tandem-Scanning-Microscope ===

In the 1960s, the Czechoslovak Mojmír Petráň from the Medical Faculty of the Charles University in Plzeň developed the Tandem-Scanning-Microscope, the first commercialized confocal microscope. It was sold by a small company in Czechoslovakia and in the United States by Tracor-Northern (later Noran) and used a rotating Nipkow disk to generate multiple excitation and emission pinholes.

The Czechoslovak patent was filed 1966 by Petráň and Milan Hadravský, a Czechoslovak coworker. A first scientific publication with data and images generated with this microscope was published in the journal Science in 1967, authored by M. David Egger from Yale University and Petráň. As a footnote to this paper it is mentioned that Petráň designed the microscope and supervised its construction and that he was, in part, a &quot;research associate&quot; at Yale. A second publication from 1968 described the theory and the technical details of the instrument and had Hadravský and Robert Galambos, the head of the group at Yale, as additional authors. In 1970 the US patent was granted. It was filed in 1967.

=== 1969: The first confocal laser scanning microscope ===
In 1969 and 1971, M. David Egger and Paul Davidovits from Yale University, published two papers describing the first confocal &quot;laser&quot; scanning microscope. It was a point scanner, meaning just one illumination spot was generated. It used epi-Illumination-reflection microscopy for the observation of nerve tissue. A 5 mW Helium-Neon-Laser with 633 nm light was reflected by a semi-transparent mirror towards the objective. The objective was a simple lens with a focal length of 8.5 mm. As opposed to all earlier and most later systems, the sample was scanned by movement of this lens (objective scanning), leading to a movement of the focal point. Reflected light came back to the semitransparent mirror, the transmitted part was focused by another lens on the detection pinhole behind which a photomultiplier tube was placed. The signal was visualized by a CRT of an oscilloscope, the cathode ray was moved simultaneously with the objective. A special device allowed to make Polaroid photos, three of which were shown in the 1971 publication.

The authors speculate about fluorescent dyes for &quot;in vivo&quot; investigations. They cite Minsky&#x27;s patent, thank Steve Baer, at the time a doctoral student at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine in New York City where he developed a confocal line scanning microscope, for suggesting to use a laser with &#x27;Minsky&#x27;s microscope&#x27; and thank Galambos, Hadravsky and Petráň for discussions leading to the development of their microscope. The motivation for their development was that in the Tandem-Scanning-Microscope only a fraction of 10−7 of the illumination light participates in generating the image in the eye piece. Thus, image quality was not sufficient for most biological investigations.

=== 1977–1985: Point scanners with lasers and stage scanning ===
In 1977 Colin J. R. Sheppard and Amarjyoti Choudhury, Oxford, UK, published a theoretical analysis of confocal and laser-scanning microscopes. It is probably the first publication using the term &quot;confocal microscope&quot;.

In 1978, the brothers Christoph Cremer and Thomas Cremer published a design for a confocal laser-scanning-microscope using fluorescent excitation with electronic autofocus. They also suggested a laser point illumination by using a &quot;4π-point-hologramme&quot;. This CLSM design combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with fluorescent markers for the first time.

In 1978 and 1980, the Oxford-group around Colin Sheppard and Tony Wilson described a confocal microscope with epi-laser-illumination, stage scanning and photomultiplier tubes as detectors. The stage could move along the optical axis (z-axis), allowing optical serial sections.

In 1979 Fred Brakenhoff and coworkers demonstrated that the theoretical advantages of optical sectioning and resolution improvement are indeed achievable in practice. In 1985 this group became the first to publish convincing images taken on a confocal microscope that were able to answer biological questions. Shortly after many more groups started using confocal microscopy to answer scientific questions that until then had remained a mystery due to technological limitations.

In 1983 I. J. Cox and C. Sheppard from Oxford published the first work whereby a confocal microscope was controlled by a computer. The first commercial laser scanning microscope, the stage-scanner SOM-25 was offered by Oxford Optoelectronics (after several take-overs acquired by BioRad) starting in 1982. It was based on the design of the Oxford group.

=== Starting 1985: Laser point scanners with beam scanning ===
In the mid-1980s, William Bradshaw Amos and John Graham White and colleagues working at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge built the first confocal beam scanning microscope. The stage with the sample was not moving, instead the illumination spot was, allowing faster image acquisition: four images per second with 512 lines each. Hugely magnified intermediate images, due to a 1–2 meter long beam path, allowed the use of a conventional iris diaphragm as a ‘pinhole’, with diameters ~1 mm. First micrographs were taken with long-term exposure on film before a digital camera was added. A further improvement allowed zooming into the preparation for the first time. Zeiss, Leitz and Cambridge Instruments had no interest in a commercial production. The Medical Research Council (MRC) finally sponsored development of a prototype. The design was acquired by Bio-Rad, amended with computer control and commercialized as &#x27;MRC 500&#x27;. The successor MRC 600 was later the basis for the development of the first two-photon-fluorescent microscope developed 1990 at Cornell University.

Developments at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm around the same time led to a commercial CLSM distributed by the Swedish company Sarastro. The venture was acquired in 1990 by Molecular Dynamics, but the CLSM was eventually discontinued. In Germany, Heidelberg Instruments, founded in 1984, developed a CLSM, which was initially meant for industrial applications rather than biology. This instrument was taken over in 1990 by Leica Lasertechnik. Zeiss already had a non-confocal flying-spot laser scanning microscope on the market which was upgraded to a confocal. A report from 1990, mentioned some manufacturers of confocals: Sarastro, Technical Instrument, Meridian Instruments, Bio-Rad, Leica, Tracor-Northern and Zeiss.

In 1989, Fritz Karl Preikschat, with his son Ekhard Preikschat, invented the scanning laser diode microscope for particle-size analysis. and co-founded Lasentec to commercialize it. In 2001, Lasentec was acquired by Mettler Toledo. They are used mostly in the pharmaceutical industry to provide in-situ control of the crystallization process in large purification systems.

=== 2010s: Computational methods for removing the output pinhole ===
In standard confocal instruments, the second or &quot;output&quot; pinhole is utilized to filter out the emitted or scattered light. Traditionally, this pinhole is a passive component that blocks light to filter the illumination optically. However, newer designs have tried to perform this filtering digitally.

Recent approaches have replaced the passive pinhole with a compound detector element. Typically, after digital processing, this approach leads to better resolution and photon budget, as the resolution limit can approach that of an infinitely small pinhole. 

Other researchers have attempted to digitally refocus the light from a point excitation source using deep convolutional neural networks.

<text>Theophilus Doctor Khumalo (born 26 June 1967), is a South African former football player. He is best known for being a star midfielder for Kaizer Chiefs as well as the South African national team.

==Career==
Having started playing football in 1984 with Swallows Reserves, Khumalo then went to Kaizer Chiefs, where he initially played for the junior team. His father, Eliakim Khumalo, a renowned player of the 1970s and early 1980s, served as his mentor. Khumalo was promoted to the senior team by coach Ted Dumitru the following year, when he started a game against arch rivals Orlando Pirates.

Khumalo went on to become a star player for Kaizer Chiefs and did not play for any other South African football club, only leaving them for short overseas playing periods – he signed with FIFA agent Marcelo Houseman who first took him to Argentinian club Ferro Carril Oeste for six months in 1995, while in 1996 and 1997 he played for the Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer.

The high-point of Khumalo&#x27;s football career was the 1990s; he was part of the Kaizer Chiefs teams that won three South African league championship titles and five knockout trophies and was also voted South African Footballer of the Year in 1992. During his career at the club, he played in a total of 397 league and cup games, scoring 75 goals.

After the re-admission of South Africa to FIFA in 1992, Khumalo was selected to be a member of the South African squad for its first official international match in July of the same year, against Cameroon. South Africa won the match 1–0, due to a penalty scored by Khumalo. He was also a leading member of the winning South African national team at the 1996 African Nations Cup. He also represented South Africa in the 1998 Football World Cup. Throughout his whole international career, he played for South Africa 50 times (twice as captain), scoring nine goals making him the 13th most capped South African footballer.

One of Doctor Khumalo&#x27;s most memorable games was perhaps the 1996 Mandela Cup match, where South Africa played against Brazil. Phil Masinga scored the first goal from Doctor Khumalo&#x27;s corner kick. Khumalo then scored the second goal to make the score 2–0 in favour of the South Africans. Unfortunately for Bafana, Brazil came back in the second half, scoring three goals, to win the encounter 3–2.

He retired in 2002 and then in 2004 as a player-coach. Although he was a winning co-coach (with Donald &quot;Ace&quot; Khuse) of Kaizer Chiefs in the 2002–2003 season (guiding the club to a 12-game unbeaten record and earning themselves a joint Coach of the Month PSL award), Khumalo has stated that his aim is to become a football administrator. Since 2004, Khumalo served as a television football commentator and presenter, being named afterwards South African Under-17 national coach.

Khumalo was voted 62nd in the Top 100 Great South Africans in 2004.

==Coaching career==
He has a SAFA Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 coaching licences, an English Football Association licence which he got in 2005 and a UEFA B licence through the German Football Federation in 2007. He previously worked as head coach for the Kaizer Chiefs Under-17 team and together with Khuse. He was the assistant coach for Kaizer Chiefs.

==Acting career==
Khumalo made his film acting debut with the German/South African production Themba. He plays himself as the coach of the under 21s. The movie is about Themba, a young and ambitious football youth, who is faced with poverty, AIDS and violence, but eventually makes his way on to the South African national team. The film is based on a novel by Lutz van Dijk and premiered at the Berlinale 2010.

<doc id="1186910" wikidata="Q977508" url="?curid=1186910" title="S-mine">
<text>The German S-mine (&quot;Schrapnellmine&quot;, &quot;Springmine&quot; or &quot;Splittermine&quot; in German), known by enemy Allied Forces as the &quot;Bouncing Betty&quot; on the Western Front and &quot;frog-mine&quot; on the Eastern Front, is the best-known version of a class of mines known as bounding mines. When triggered, these mines are launched into the air and then detonated at about from the ground. The explosion projects a lethal spray of shrapnel in all directions. The S-mine was an anti-personnel mine developed by Germany in the 1930s and used extensively by German forces during World War II. It was designed to be used in open areas against unshielded infantry. Two versions were produced, designated by the year of their first production: the SMi-35 and SMi-44. There are only minor differences between the two models.

The S-mine entered production in 1935 and served as a key part of the defensive strategy of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Until production ceased in 1945, Germany produced over 1.93 million S-mines. These mines inflicted heavy casualties and slowed, or even repelled, drives into German-held territory throughout the war. The design was lethal, successful, and often imitated.

== History ==
French soldiers encountered the S-mine during minor probes into the German Saar region on 7–11 September, 1939, during the Saar Offensive. The S-mine contributed to the withdrawal of these French incursions. The mine&#x27;s performance in the Saar region affirmed its effectiveness in the eyes of the German leadership and prompted the United States and other countries to copy its design. After their experience, the French nicknamed the mine &quot;the silent soldier&quot;.

Nazi Germany used the S-mine heavily during the defense of its occupied territories and the German homeland during the Allied invasions of Europe and North Africa. The mines were produced in large numbers and planted liberally by defending German units. For example, the German Tenth Army deployed over 23,000 of them as part of their defense preparation during the Allied invasion of Italy.

S-mines were deployed on the beaches of Normandy in preparation for the anticipated invasion as part of a general program of heavy mining and fortification. On the Îles-St.-Marcouf, just off Utah Beach, where Allied planners believed the Germans had established heavy gun batteries, Erwin Rommel had ordered S-mines to be &quot;sown like grass seed.&quot; To build the Atlantic Wall, Germans laid millions of mines of various types including anti-personnel mines such as the S-mine, dug hundreds of kilometers of trenches, laid barbed wire, and constructed thousands of beach obstacles. The mines were subsequently used to defend German positions during the Battle of Normandy and in the defense of Northern France and the German border. S-mines were typically used in combination with anti-tank mines to resist the advances of both armor and infantry. The Allies removed an estimated 15,000 unexploded mines from dunes by Pouppeville after the initial invasion.

The S-mine acquired its alliterative nickname &quot;Bouncing Betty&quot; from American infantrymen. The S-mine had a great psychological effect on Allied forces because of its tendency to maim, rather than kill, infantry. The German habit of laying them around anti-tank and anti-vehicle mines contributed to the S-mine&#x27;s reputation. If a vehicle was disabled by a mine, the soldiers would be trapped in it until someone came to rescue them. Limbs and genitalia were particularly vulnerable. In his book &quot;Mine Warfare on Land&quot;, Lt. Col. Sloan described the S-mine as &quot;probably the most feared device encountered by Allied troops in the war.&quot; Exact death tolls inflicted by the S-mine are not known. The Allies did not record whether a death was caused by a particular type of weapon, only whether or not the death occurred in the course of battle. Regardless, some unofficial assessments credit the S-mine with having caused significant casualties. The 12th Infantry Regiment at Utah Beach suffered what it termed as &quot;light&quot; casualties in the landing, most of which were caused by S-mines.

S-mine production ceased after the end of World War II. No information has been discovered as to the exact fate of the remaining stockpiles of the S-mine, but it can be assumed a majority were destroyed as part of the disarmament of Germany after its surrender, although possibly some were preserved for study and reverse engineering by the Allies. Many direct imitations of the S-mine appeared in the years following World War II.

During the military occupation of Germany and the postwar rebuilding of Europe, the American Army Corps of Engineers, the newly established French government, and the British Ministry of Defence engaged in one of the most prolonged and successful mine-clearing operations throughout Western Europe. France deployed a variety of personnel, including 49,000 German prisoners of war. This joint operation eliminated a majority of the remaining fields of mines on the war-torn western half of the continent and was greatly assisted by the German policy of clearly marking and accurately recording the locations of minefields.

However, incidents involving accidental explosions of mines in North Africa, former Warsaw Pact countries, France, and Germany still occur sporadically. North Africa and Eastern Europe have a particularly large amount of uncleared World War II-era minefields, lost in the desert sands or forgotten by authorities. While German documentation stated that the S-mine had an effective lifespan of two to seven years once planted, the explosive charge may remain dangerous indefinitely.

== Characteristics ==

The German S-mine was a steel cylinder approximately tall without its sensor and around in diameter. A steel rod protruding from the mine&#x27;s top held the main fuse, where its trigger or sensor was attached. The SMi-35 had a central fuse, while the SMi-44 had an offset fuse. It weighed approximately , with the weight depending on whether it was loaded with the lighter powdered or the heavier poured TNT.

The main charge of the mine used TNT as its explosive; the propelling charge was black powder. The standard pressure sensor used a percussion cap to ignite it.

The main fuse was designed to delay the firing of the propelling charge for approximately four seconds after the mine was triggered. The explosion of the propelling charge sent the mine upwards into the air and activated three short-delay pellets between the propellant charge and the three detonators. These short-delay pellets delayed the mine&#x27;s detonation long enough for it to reach an appropriate height before exploding.

The standard pressure sensor was designed to activate if depressed by a force equivalent to a weight of roughly or greater. This ensured the mine was not detonated by wildlife or natural impact of blowing leaves, branches, or other normally occurring phenomena.

== Usage ==
The S-mine was normally triggered by a three-pronged pressure fuse, but the German army also provided a special tripwire adapter. The steel tube that held the fuse was threaded to accept any standard German ignition or trigger, allowing the sensor to be removed and the mine to be deliberately triggered by a human operator. When triggered, the mine functioned in three stages (see diagram).

# First, the mine was fired upwards by a small propellant charge.
# Approximately a half-second later, the main charge detonated at the optimum height to kill or severely injure anyone in the immediate area.
# The main charge of the mine was surrounded by roughly 360 steel balls, short steel rods, or scrap metal pieces. These became metal shrapnel that sprayed horizontally from the mine at high velocity.

The time between triggering and ignition of the propelling charge varied between 3.9 and 4.5 seconds, depending on the age and condition of the mine. According to German documentation, the S-mine was lethal within and could inflict casualties within . American training manuals warned of casualties at up to .

A common misconception prevailed that the S-mine would not detonate until its victim stepped off the trigger. This fallacy was propagated by incorrect United States propaganda during World War II. The mine would detonate whether the trigger was released or not. Standing still or attempting to run from the S-mine would be equally dangerous. The most effective way to survive the mine&#x27;s detonation would not be to flee but to fall to the ground lying face down as quickly as possible.

=== Armored vehicle discharger system ===
A S-mine mine launcher (&quot;Minenabwurfvorrichtung&quot; in German) in the form of angled tubes attached via brackets to the hull, were also used for anti-infantry defense by Wehrmacht armored vehicles. Early versions of the Tiger I were equipped with five such devices with command variants being equipped with four. Beginning in January 1943 all new Tiger Is were equipped with this system. These were removed in October 1943 and replaced in March 1944 by the Nahverteidigungswaffe or &quot;close defense weapon&quot; (full deployment was delayed due to production delays) which could launch anti-personnel grenades as well as smoke grenades or signal flares in all directions.

== Detection and disarming ==
The S-mine was constructed mostly of metal, so it could be easily detected by metal detectors. However, such expensive and bulky equipment was rarely available to infantry units and was prone to malfunction. Instead, S-mines were detected through careful manual probing, a time-consuming process. Using a knife or a bayonet, an infantryman would probe at a low angle through the soil. It was important to probe at an angle that would not accidentally depress the pressure sensor.

Once an S-mine was discovered, disarming it was fairly simple. To prevent triggering while the mine was being planted, the German pressure sensor featured a hole where a safety pin kept the sensor from being depressed. This pin was removed once the mine was planted. If the discovered mine was fitted with the pressure sensor, the disarming personnel would slip a pin (such as a sewing needle) into this hole. If the device was armed with a tripwire or electrical trigger, this could simply be cut. Germans were known to use booby traps to discourage this, so caution was suggested. The mine could then be removed carefully from the ground and the sensor easily unscrewed. If it was deemed necessary to render the mine completely inert, three plugs on the top granted access to the three detonators inside the mine. These could be unscrewed and the detonators removed.

== Internal components ==
The following diagrams show the SMi-35 mine&#x27;s internal mechanism, together with the three-pronged pressure fuse. The safety pin for the fuse and the three removable plugs for the detonators are clearly visible. These diagrams were issued as part of a US Army field manual on mines in 1943.

== Imitations ==
The S-mine was an extremely successful design. Bouncing mines based on its design were introduced by other countries.

The Finnish army began purchasing the SMi-35 model S-mine from Germany following the Winter War. This was part of a larger military assistance agreement between the two nations. Finnish forces experienced great success with the S-mine, but its monetary cost was considerable. During the Continuation War, the Finns unsuccessfully attempted to produce their own version of the mine. The Finnish nickname for the mine was &quot;Hyppy-Heikki&quot; (&quot;Hopping Henry&quot;).

The French Mle 1939 mine was inspired by the success of the S-mine. In 1940, Major Pierre (also cited as Paul) Delalande of the French Corps of Engineers managed to escape the German conquest of his country and reached the United States with the Mle-1939 plans. These plans led to the development of the American M2 mine, which was fielded in 1942 but proved deficient in combat. The American army was impressed by the S-mine&#x27;s role in thwarting the French offensive in the German Saar region at the beginning of World War II and continued further work on bounding mines. After the war, the American army developed their M16 mine directly from captured S-mine designs.

The Soviet Union also based the design of its OZM series of mines on the German S-mine. Soviet mines tended to be far simpler internally; instead of being filled with steel balls or scrap metal, the OZM-4 mine was given a solid cast-iron body that would fragment on its own. Later, the OZM-72 bounding mine was filled with steel rods, returning to the original concept of the S-mine. Both of these mines are still being produced by Russia.

Yugoslavia also built a PROM-1 bounding type of anti-personnel mine loosely based on the S-mine. The mine was widely used during the Croatian War of Independence by both sides. The mine was also found in Bosnia, Chile, Eritrea, Iraq, Kosovo, Mozambique and Namibia.

Other nations that have produced S-mine-inspired designs include the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Sweden (called Truppmina 11), and Italy.

<text>Edward Scott Lampert (born July 19, 1962) is an American billionaire businessman. He is the former chief executive and chairman of Sears Holdings, the founder of Transformco, and the founder, chairman, and chief executive of ESL Investments. Until May 2007, he was a director of AutoNation. He was a director of AutoZone from 1999 to 2006. As of October 2021, his net worth was estimated at US$2 billion.

==Early life and education==
Lampert was born in 1962 to Dolores Lampert and Floyd M. Lampert. He is Jewish. His mother was a housewife. His father was a senior partner in the law firm of Lampert &amp; Lampert in New York City. He has a younger sister Tracey. Lampert&#x27;s grandmother was a passive investor and a fan of Louis Rukeyser&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street Week&quot; television program. She instilled in him an interest in investing. His mother would later recall that young Eddie would sit with his grandmother reviewing and evaluating the performance of her stock picks in the daily newspaper.

Lampert&#x27;s father died in 1977, and his mother took a job as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue. His mother would later say: &quot;Eddie really assumed the responsibility, knowing that life had changed and we had to accomplish something by ourselves now.&quot; In order to help support his family, Lampert worked after school and on weekends at various warehouses, stocking shelves and filling orders. Despite working, he earned good grades, played both soccer and basketball, and won the scholar athlete award at his high school. He received financial aid to help pay for college. Lampert graduated from Yale University in 1984 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and Phi Beta Kappa.

==Career==
In July 1984, Lampert worked as an intern at Goldman Sachs, and then worked in the firm&#x27;s risk arbitrage department from March 1985 to February 1988. While there, he worked directly with Robert Rubin. When Lampert decided to go out on his own, Rubin warned him it would be a bad career decision.

In April 1988, Lampert left the bank to form ESL Investments, based in Greenwich, Connecticut (the name derives from Lampert&#x27;s initials). Richard Rainwater, whom Lampert had met on Nantucket Island, gave him $28 million in seed money and introduced him to clients, such as David Geffen.

A 2004 profile by Businessweek likened Lampert&#x27;s investment style to that of financier Warren Buffett. Lampert&#x27;s earnings in 2004 were estimated to be $1.02 billion, making him the first Wall Street financial manager to exceed an income of $1 billion in a single year. In 2006, Lampert was featured on the Time 100 list for most influential people in the world for being one of the &quot;brightest minds on Wall Street&quot; and leading a new class of activist hedge funds. Lampert was the richest person in Connecticut in 2006 with a net worth of $3.8 billion.

In March 2012, Lampert was No. 367 on the &quot;Forbes&quot; world&#x27;s wealthiest people list with a net worth of $3.1 billion. By August, 2016, Lampert had fallen to No. 810 on the list, with a net worth of $2.2 billion.

In January 2013, it was announced that Lampert would take over as chief executive officer at Sears after Louis D&#x27;Ambrosio stepped down due to family health matters; this took effect in May 2013.

Lampert restructured Sears into approximately 30 separate business units, which were evaluated based on individual profits, rather than any estimation of their effect on Sears&#x27; overall profit. These units were to buy and sell services among themselves through competitive bidding. Some sources say these policies were based upon the ideas of Ayn Rand. It is generally agreed that they failed to slow Sears&#x27; decline. 

In July 2016 he held 28% of shares in Sears Holdings Corp, worth approximately $408 million.

In early 2017, Lampert, then president, chief executive officer and top shareholder of Sears Holdings, was estimated to have personal assets of $2 billion, primarily in the hedge fund ESL Investments. Early in the year, he committed to providing an additional loan of $500 million to Sears and said he would provide letters of credit to Sears for additional amounts, reportedly totaling $200 million and possibly increasing to a half billion dollars in the future.

Lampert was criticized by employees and corporate staff for &quot;shredding&quot; his employees in corporate meetings and &quot;being out of touch with reality&quot;, as well as for failing to invest in the physical stores, as many of them were deteriorating. During his tenure as chief executive, Sears lost around half its value within five years, and closed more than half of its physical stores.

On October 15, 2018, Lampert stepped down as chief executive of Sears Holdings, while remaining chairman of the board, as part of Sears Holdings bankruptcy actions. On December 6, 2018, Lampert, through his company ESL Investments, offered to buy all of Sears for $4.6 billion in cash and stock. The offer would be financed by $950 million in added debt, but no additional cash. In early 2019, five hundred stores remained in operation; the remainder were in liquidation. According to a company filing, Lampert stepped down as chairman of Sears Holdings Corp on February 14, 2019.

In January 2019, a group of Sears&#x27; creditors hoping to persuade a federal judge to force Sears to liquidate alleged that Lampert had orchestrated a &quot;multiyear and multifaceted scheme&quot; to strip away the company&#x27;s assets and benefit from its decline. In May 2019, Lampert, months after purchasing the remains of Sears from the holding company, threatened not to pay out the $43 million in pension payments owed to 90,000 former Sears and Kmart employees and retirees.

In December of 2024, a lawsuit for $177M was filed in bankruptcy court against Lampert and the companies he controls by a Trustee of Sears Hometown Stores.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Lampert married Kinga Keh, an attorney with whom he has three children. They own houses in Indian Creek Village, Florida, and Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple are active members of their local Chabad house.

Lampert is the owner of the &quot;Fountainhead&quot;, an motor luxury yacht.

In 2003, Lampert was kidnapped from the parking lot of his Greenwich office but persuaded his captors to let him go after two days of captivity by promising to pay them a ransom.

Lampert is a self-proclaimed supporter of free market economics and is a fan of Objectivism writer Ayn Rand.

<text>The City Botanic Gardens (formerly the Brisbane Botanic Gardens) is a heritage-listed botanic garden on Alice Street, Brisbane City, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was also known as Queen&#x27;s Park. It is located on Gardens Point in the Brisbane CBD and is bordered by the Brisbane River, Alice Street, George Street, Parliament House and Queensland University of Technology&#x27;s Gardens Point campus. It was established in 1825 as a farm for the Moreton Bay penal settlement.

The Gardens include Brisbane&#x27;s most mature gardens, with many rare and unusual botanic species. In particular the Gardens feature a special collection of cycads, palms, figs and bamboo.

The City Botanic Gardens was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 February 1997. The Queensland Heritage Register describes the Gardens as &quot;the most significant, non-Aboriginal cultural landscape in Queensland, having a continuous horticultural history since 1828, without any significant loss of land area or change in use over that time. It remains the premier public park and recreational facility for the capital of Queensland, which role it has performed since the early 1840s.&quot;

==History==
Much of the present-day Botanic Gardens was surveyed and selected as the site for a public garden in 1828 by the NSW Colonial Botanist Charles Fraser, three years after the establishment of the Moreton Bay penal settlement at nearby North Quay, Brisbane. Originally the gardens were planted by convicts in 1825 with food crops to feed the prison colony.

In 1855 a portion of several acres was declared a Botanic Reserve. In the same year Walter Hill was appointed as curator of the Botanic Reserve, a position he held until 1881. He began an active planting and experimental program. Some of the older trees planted in the Gardens were the first of their species to be planted in Australia, due to Hill&#x27;s experiments to acclimatise plants. The experiments served practical outcomes. Plants with potential commercial value were tested in the gardens, first to see if they were viable, to determine what they needed for growth and if a profit could be made. Hill introduced mango, pawpaw, ginger, tamarind, mahogany, poinciana and jacaranda trees as well as tobacco, sugar, grape vines, wheat, tropical fruits, tea, coffee, spices and textile plants. The world&#x27;s first cultivated macadamia nut tree was planted in 1858 by Walter Hill. He encouraged the work of the sugar pioneer John Buhot which culminated in the first production of granulated sugar in Queensland in April 1862. A cairn was erected at the site where the sugar cane was grown. Hill also supported the work of the Queensland Acclimatisation Society which was formed in 1862, and the Botanic Gardens was the propagation and distribution point for the Society&#x27;s imports. 

The first jacaranda tree in Australia was planted at the Botanic Gardens in 1864. A curator collected seedlings from an international ship docked in the Brisbane River. The cultural popularity of the jacaranda across Brisbane City was subsequently spawned. 
By 1866 Hill had succeeded in having the extent of the Botanic Gardens enlarged to approximately . A strip along Alice Street was not part of the Gardens but served as a park and sporting field known as Queen&#x27;s Park.
Early building work in the area included a Superintendent&#x27;s cottage in the late 1850s, a platform for a battery of cannon in the early 1860s, a stone and iron fence around Queen&#x27;s Park in 1865–66 [utilising stone from the old gaol on Petrie Terrace], and a drinking fountain in 1867. The fountain, designed by Colonial Architect Charles Tiffin, was erected only a year after reticulated water from the Enoggera reservoir was introduced to Brisbane. It later became known as the Walter Hill fountain.

A row of figs were planted in the 1870s. Hill also planted avenues of Bunya pines and Cook pines.
Scientific activity was complemented by public recreational use of the Gardens, along with the Domain (on the southern boundary of the Gardens) and Queen&#x27;s Park. By the 1880s, some of the scientific work previously performed by the Botanic Gardens was being carried out by the Queensland Acclimatisation Society at Bowen Park. The Herbarium and Botanic Library were moved from the Gardens for a period but were returned in 1905 when John Frederick Bailey was appointed Curator of the Botanic Gardens.

Underground electricity supply was installed in 1907.

Extensive dredging of Gardens Point in 1915 removed about from the Domain (the southern side of Gardens Point) and Botanic Gardens but in the following year the amalgamation of the Gardens, Queens Park and part of the Domain resulted in a new Botanic Gardens of about .

The extant City Botanic Gardens was formed by the amalgamation of the original Botanic Gardens with the Domain (the southern side of Gardens Point) and Queen&#x27;s Park in 1916, bringing its total area to around ; Queen&#x27;s Park comprised a strip along Alice Street, which originally served as a park and a sporting field, where regular cricket and football matches were held. The former curator&#x27;s cottage built for John Frederick Bailey, curator from 1905–1917, is now a cafe.

The City of Brisbane Act of 1924 transferred responsibility for the Botanic Gardens to the Brisbane City Council, but the Herbarium remained as part of the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Stock.

Due to the proximity to the river, the Botanic Gardens have been flooded nine times between 1870–2011. With many plants being washed away, the Brisbane City Council established a new botanic gardens at Mount Coot-tha. Since the opening of the Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens in the mid 1970s, the Brisbane Botanic Gardens has become principally a recreational venue. Re-development of the Gardens in the late 1980s saw the introduction of new recreational structures and restoration work on the former Queen&#x27;s Park fence.

The Gardens were also the home for over 100 years for Harriet, a tortoise reportedly collected by Charles Darwin during his visit to the Galápagos Islands in 1835 and donated to the Gardens in 1860 by John Clements Wickham, former commander of and later Government Resident for Moreton Bay. Harriet was named in honour of Harry Oakman, curator of the Gardens from 1945 to 1962 and the creator of the (now disbanded) zoo at the Gardens. The zoo at one time housed more than 400 animal species. From about 1925 it was increasingly under scrutiny for poor animal welfare conditions and unsustainable costs, and was closed in 1958. Harriet lived out her final years at Australia Zoo until dying in June 2006.

== Description ==
The Brisbane Botanic Gardens, occupying , is bounded by George and Alice Streets and the Brisbane river. They comprise three major sections: the former Queen&#x27;s Park along Alice Street, the Botanic Gardens proper (adjacent to the river), and the former Government Domain at the rear of the Queensland University of Technology (formerly part of the grounds to Old Government House).

The gardens house a collection of approximately 600 plant species. Set in undulating grounds, the gardens are bordered by mature shade trees which also create avenues and groves. A lake and formal lawns, gardens and structures provide a diversity of passive recreational activities. A series of interconnecting paths link a riverside concourse with other perimeter paths.

The gardens contain an avenue of Bunya Pines (&quot;Araucaria bidwilli&quot;) planted in the 1850s and an avenue of Weeping Figs (&quot;Ficus benjamina&quot;) planted in the 1870s. It also contains a number of other rare plants, particularly palms and figs – some in formal planting arrangements within the lawns, others within mass planted gardens – and an avenue of Cook Pines (&quot;Araucaria columnaris&quot; formerly &quot;A. cookii&quot;).

A low stone wall (1860s) surmounted by an iron railing fence runs the length of Alice Street and extends into George Street. Large iron gates provide entry at George, Albert and Edward Streets. A cottage s, with Arts and Crafts decorative elements, is located at the southern end of the gardens on a hill known as Residence Hill. This building is surrounded by trees and shrubs, some of which are survivors of late 1850s and early 1860s plantings. The City Gardens Cafe operated from the house for many years; in 2016 it is operated as The Garden Club.

In a hollow to the north of Residence Hill, is the Walter Hill fountain. It stands on a stepped octagonal base of three tiers. The body of the fountain continues this shape but tapers towards its top. The lion shaped drinking fountains, presently not functioning, and basins are of white marble in contrast with the freestone of the rest of the structure.

To the south of Residence Hill is a 1980s grassed amphitheatre known as Riverstage facing a stage beside the river. Other structures for public convenience and recreational use are dispersed throughout the gardens.

==Access and facilities==

The Gardens are accessible by Alice Street, the Goodwill Bridge and Brisbane City Council&#x27;s ferries and CityCats at the Gardens Point and Eagle St wharves. The gardens are open 24 hours, with pathways lit at night. 
Features of the Gardens include:
* Gardens Cycle Hire station at Albert Street entrance
* &quot;Morning Star II&quot; by Jon Barlow Hudson (from World Expo 88)
* &quot;Plant form&quot; by Robert Juniper

== Heritage listing ==
Brisbane Botanic Gardens was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 February 1997 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland&#x27;s history.

The Brisbane Botanic Gardens are historically important as the most significant, non-Aboriginal cultural landscape in Queensland, having a continuous horticultural history since 1828, without any significant loss of land area or change in use over that time. It remains the premier public park and recreational facility for the capital of Queensland, which role it has performed since the early 1840s.

The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland&#x27;s cultural heritage.

Plant collections date to the 1850s, many having been planted by Walter Hill, the first Director of the Botanic Gardens. Many of the specimens are either rare in cultivation or of great maturity or both. Many important plant introductions to Queensland, of both an agricultural and ornamental nature, can be traced directly to the Brisbane Botanic Gardens and the work of its early curators.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

These gardens are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an evolving public and botanical garden dating from the mid-19th century, containing the most extensive mature gardens in Queensland. There are a number of historic structures in the gardens, including the Walter Hill Drinking Fountain (1867), the former band pavilion (1878), the boundary stone walls, gates and cast iron railings (1865–85), the former bear pit shelter (1905), the former curator&#x27;s residence (1909) [now the kiosk], the riverwall from Edward Street to the Domain (1918), the southern stone staircase on the riverbank (1918–19) and the middle and northern stone staircases (both 1923–24). The place also contains a number of historically significant early engineering projects, including the stormwater drainage system (1865 onwards), reticulated water supply from Enoggera Dam (1867) and underground electricity supply for lighting purposes (1907).

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

The Brisbane Botanic Gardens are significant as a Brisbane landmark and for their visual amenity and natural wildlife values as the major verdant landscaped area in the city&#x27;s central business district.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Many important social events have taken place within the gardens, and the place is generally held in high regard by the local community and is a popular destination for visitors to Brisbane.

The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland&#x27;s history.

The place has a special association with the pioneering work of curators Walter Hill (1855–81), Philip John MacMahon (1889–1905), John Frederick Bailey (1905–1917) and Ernest Walter Bick (1917–1939).

<doc id="1186919" wikidata="Q3502951" url="?curid=1186919" title="Fibrinoid necrosis">
<text>Fibrinoid necrosis is a pathological lesion that affects blood vessels, and is characterized by the occurrence of endothelial damage, followed by leakage of plasma proteins, including fibrinogen, from the vessel lumen; these proteins infiltrate and deposit within the vessel walls, where fibrin polymerization subsequently ensues.

Although the term &quot;fibrinoid&quot; essentially means &quot;fibrin-like&quot;, it has been confirmed through immunohistochemical analysis and electron microscopy that the areas referred to as &quot;fibrin-like&quot; do contain fibrin, whose predominant presence contributes to the bright, eosinophilic (pinkish) and structureless appearance of the affected vessels.

The earliest documented identification of fibrinoid changes dates back to 1880, when it was questioned whether these histological changes resulted from the deposition of a fibrinous exudate, or the degeneration and breakdown of collagen fibers.

The term &quot;fibrinoid&quot; was introduced to describe these changes, because distinguishing fibrinoid from hyaline deposits posed a significant challenge, as both exhibit a similar appearance under standard light microscopy. This morphological similarity necessitated the use of specialized histological staining techniques, such as phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin and various types of trichrome stains, to facilitate the distinction of fibrinoid material. Because these stains possess the ability to highlight and identify fibrin, this led to the term &quot;fibrinoid&quot;, which means &quot;fibrin-like&quot;, being used to describe the affected vessels.

Nevertheless, as early as 1957, fibrin was indeed identified within fibrinoid, and by 1982, this understanding had advanced, with many researchers recognizing fibrinoid as a complex structure primarily composed of fibrin interwoven with various plasma proteins.

==Nomenclature==
===A misnomer===
The term &quot;fibrinoid necrosis&quot; is, in fact, considered a misnomer, as the intense eosinophilic staining of the accumulated plasma proteins masks the true nature of the underlying changes in the blood vessel, and makes it virtually impossible to definitively determine whether the cells of the vessel wall are actually undergoing necrosis.

A 2000 review stated that &quot;whether the lesion is truly necrotic, in the sense that it reflects the result of unprogrammed cell death, has never been investigated in depth&quot;, and an electron microscopy study examining fibrinoid necrosis in rat models with induced pulmonary hypertension found that fibrinoid changes weren&#x27;t necessarily associated with necrosis of the smooth muscles of the media, and therefore recommended using the term &quot;fibrinoid vasculosis&quot; instead.

However, despite the inaccuracy, the microscopic characteristics of fibrinoid changes strongly resemble those of necrotic tissue, which is why the term &quot;fibrinoid necrosis&quot; continues to be used, even though it may not fully reflect the true underlying process.

===Fibrinoid necrosis and lipohyalinosis===
In 1971, CM Fisher, a pioneering figure in cerebral vascular diseases, proposed using the term &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; as a replacement for &quot;fibrinoid necrosis&quot;, based on his observation that the affected fibrinoid areas also contained lipid.

The term &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; was intended to serve as a synonym for fibrinoid necrosis, yet it is strictly used to describe the pathological fibrinoid changes in the cerebral vessels of patients with malignant hypertension. Even though the same pathological process, that affects cerebral blood vessels in malignant hypertension, also occurs in the arterioles of other organs, such as the kidneys and mesentery, &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; is not used to describe these changes outside the brain, and &quot;fibrinoid necrosis&quot; remains the more widely recognized term for similar processes in other organs.

However, a common misconception in many textbooks is the failure to clarify that &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; and &quot;fibrinoid necrosis&quot; are actually two descriptions of the same pathological process.

Instead of recognizing their equivalence, they are often presented as distinct stages, where &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; is mistakenly described as a later consequence of &quot;fibrinoid necrosis&quot;, or &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; is sometimes erroneously used interchangeably with arteriolosclerosis, which is a much broader term used to describe pathological changes in small arteries caused by a variety of conditions. Mislabeling &quot;lipohyalinosis&quot; as &quot;arteriolosclerosis&quot; overlooks the specific nature of lipohyalinosis as a condition involving fibrinoid necrosis (a particular form of vascular injury) and contributes to confusion.

==Localization==
Fibrinoid necrosis predominantly affects small blood vessels, such as arterioles and glomeruli, but it can also involve medium-sized vessels, as observed in conditions like polyarteritis nodosa. It can also exhibit a highly segmental distribution, where the fibrinoid material does not uniformly coat the affected vessel but instead appears in isolated patches that are spaced along the length of the vessel wall.

Fibrinoid infiltration in affected vessels may be confined to the subintimal region, as the ground substance of the intima and the inner elastic lamina often act as a barrier, limiting further penetration of fibrin into the arterial wall. However, if the internal elastic lamina is disrupted, fibrin may extend into the media, where it is typically contained by the outer elastic lamina, potentially spreading circumferentially along its inner surface. In some cases, fibrin may extend into the adventitia or even escape from the vessels into surrounding perivascular tissue or adjacent spaces. This phenomenon is observed in conditions such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, where fibrin can infiltrate the urinary space near glomerular capillaries or the air space adjacent to alveolar capillaries.

== Associated diseases ==
Fibrinoid necrosis is observed in a wide range of pathological conditions such as:
* Immunologically-mediated vasculitides including:
# Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis: Fibrinoid necrosis is a classical finding in these small-vessel vasculitides, and it has been referred to as &quot;the ANCA-associated lesion&quot; even though it occurs in other conditions as well.
# Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN): The hallmark morphological characteristic of PAN is fibrinoid necrosis. In contrast, fibrinoid necrosis in Kawasaki disease is less pronounced than in PAN, despite both being forms of medium-sized vessel vasculitides.
# Systemic lupus erythematosus.
# Leucocytoclastic vasculitis.
# Systemic sclerosis, arthus reaction (a type III hypersensitivity reaction) and rheumatoid subcutaneous nodules.

* Malignant hypertension: Fibrinoid necrosis arises in the systemic circulation as a typical feature of malignant hypertension, and it&#x27;s observed, for example, in the arterioles of the kidney, brain, retina, and other organs.
* Thrombotic microangiopathy, and rejection of kidney grafts.
* Preeclampsia: Fibrinoid necrosis occurs in the uterine spiral arterioles in preeclampsia, and involves the deposition of a dense, eosinophilic material beneath the endothelial lining of the affected vessels.
* Gestational diabetes mellitus may also result in fibrinoid necrosis, and vascular lesions similar to preeclampsia.
* Cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
* COVID-19 infection.
* Sarcoidosis: Fibrinoid necrosis may be observed in the central region of sarcoid granulomas, providing a histopathological distinction from the caseous necrosis characteristic of granulomas in tuberculosis.
* Cerebral radiation necrosis: It is a late complication of radiotherapy, which affects 5–15% of patients treated for brain or head-and-neck malignancies, and occurs within months to years after treatment. It arises from radiation-induced brain tissue and vascular damage, leading to endothelial proliferation, fibrinoid necrosis, vessel narrowing, ischemia, and brain parenchymal necrosis.

==Pathogenesis==
Fibrinoid necrosis occurs as a consequence of endothelial injury, which permits the leakage of plasma proteins into the blood vessel walls. This endothelial damage may arise due to a variety of underlying factors; for instance:
* Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) target neutrophils, inducing the release of proteolytic enzymes. These enzymes, in conjunction with reactive oxygen species and complement system activation, contribute to endothelial damage, resulting in the formation of gaps within the capillary walls.
* Immune complex deposition, as in leucocytoclastic vasculitis and arthus reaction, activates the complement cascade, leading to the recruitment and activation of neutrophils, which release lysosomal enzymes that damage the vascular endothelium.
* High blood pressure in malignant hypertension causes direct traumatic injury to the blood vessel wall, primarily due to increased tension, and mechanical stress on the arterial walls. Numerous studies have shown that sudden and substantial blood pressure elevations can induce fibrinoid changes within minutes, providing strong evidence that elevated blood pressure alone is the cause of fibrinoid necrosis.
* In cerebral radiation necrosis, radiotherapy can directly damage the plasma membrane of multiple cell types, including endothelial cells, and trigger the enzymatic hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and the generation of ceramide. Ceramide subsequently increases the production of reactive oxygen species, which activate an inflammatory cascade that eventually results in the formation of thrombi and fibrinoid necrosis.

Endothelial cell damage results in the loss of the normal barrier function, and allows plasma components, including coagulation factors, to escape from the bloodstream and leak out into the blood vessel walls and the surrounding spaces. The coagulation factors that leak from the damaged blood vessels interact with various thrombogenic substances, such as tissue factor, which culminates in the formation of fibrin, whose accumulation leads to the characteristic appearance of fibrinoid necrosis.

==Clinical relevance==
===Pathological consequences===
====Ischemia====
* In malignant hypertension, fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arterioles and glomeruli, combined with hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis, can result in obliteration of glomeruli and loss of tubules. This process contributes to progressive renal failure and uremia, which, if left untreated, leads to a mortality rate of approximately 90% within one year.
* A variety of vasculitides can lead to the development of peripheral neuropathies, if they affect the blood vessels supplying the nerves, known as the vasa nervorum. The vascular injury associated with vasculitis, characterized by inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrinoid necrosis, can cause vessel wall damage, or narrowing of the vasa nervorum; this leads to ischemia and nerve damage, and ultimately gives rise to the clinical manifestations of neuropathy.

====Hemorrhage====
Whenever hypertension induces fibrinoid necrosis in the small cerebral arteries, this considerably raises the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to two main factors:
# The deposition of fibrinoid material in the vessel wall leads to thickening of the arterial walls, making them progressively more rigid and less elastic.
# The narrowing of the arterial lumens further exacerbates this by raising intraluminal pressure.
As a result, the small cerebral arteries become more fragile and prone to rupture, which may ultimately lead to ICH.

====Retinal detachment====
When blood pressure rises significantly, as in malignant hypertension or eclampsia, retinal arterioles can undergo fibrinoid necrosis, reducing blood supply to the choriocapillaris, which is responsible for nourishing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Ischemia disrupts RPE function, compromises the blood-retinal barrier and causes fluid leakage into the subretinal space, and the development of exudative retinal detachment.

===Diagnostic value===
Fibrinoid necrosis serves as an important diagnostic clue in recognizing vascular pathologies, and helping to guide further investigation and treatment; for instance:
* In cases where symptoms suspicious of giant cell arteritis (GCA) are present, but a temporal artery biopsy reveals fibrinoid necrosis in small vessels branching from the temporal artery, and the absence of the typical GCA histological features, this discrepancy may suggest an alternative diagnosis, as the occurrence of fibrinoid necrosis in GCA is extremely rare. Although ANCA-associated vasculitis primarily affects organs like the kidneys and lungs, it can rarely present with symptoms resembling GCA, and should be considered, particularly if the histological findings, such as the presence of fibrinoid necrosis, suggest this possibility.
* In order to establish a definitive diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV), histopathological confirmation through a skin biopsy is essential to differentiate LCV from other similar conditions. Histopathologically, LCV is defined by the following key features:
# Neutrophilic infiltration in and around the vessel wall with leukocytoclasia.
# Fibrinoid necrosis.
# Vessel wall and tissue damage.
The lack of fibrinoid necrosis and inflammatory infiltration in the vessel may preclude the diagnosis of classic LCV, and necessitates further evaluation. However, it is to be noted that these histological features tend to progress gradually over time, and a biopsy taken too early or too late might miss the &quot;textbook&quot; full-blown changes of LCV.

===Prognostic value===
Fibrinoid necrosis is included in the modified National Institutes of Health (NIH) activity index for lupus nephritis (LN), which is a scoring system used to assess the severity of LN based on histopathologic findings from kidney biopsies.

The activity index is based on the evaluation of six histologic features that indicate active inflammation, each of which is assigned a score from 0-3 depending on the degree of glomerular involvement. The score of fibrinoid necrosis and cellular/fibrocellular crescents is multiplied by two, because these two lesions were considered to be associated with a higher level of severity; this gives the activity index a total score of 0-24.

The activity index correlates with the level of active inflammation in LN, and serves as a general framework for guiding treatment decisions; the higher the NIH activity score, the more intensive the immunosuppressive treatment required.

<text>Bookshelf Symbol 7 is a typeface which was packaged with Microsoft Office 2003. It is a pi font encoding several less common variants of Roman letters (including a small subset of those used in the International Phonetic Alphabet), a few musical symbols and mathematical symbols, a few additional symbols (including torii), and a few rare or obscure kanji.

==Controversy==
In late 2003, several customers contacted Microsoft about the inclusion of two swastikas in this font (one diagonal, one straight), complaining that they did not like having the font on their computers. After being informed of the issue, Microsoft contacted several Jewish organizations about the font.

In December 2003, Microsoft published a tool to remove the font from Microsoft Office, and Steven Sinofsky, Senior Vice President for Microsoft Office, issued a public apology on behalf of Microsoft for the inclusion of the swastikas. Microsoft Office product manager Simon Marks clarified that the font was based on a Japanese font set, and the inclusion of the swastikas was accidental.

In February 2004, Microsoft released a critical update (KB833407) for Microsoft Office 2003 to remove &quot;unacceptable symbols&quot; from this font. This update removed the two swastikas and a Star of David from this typeface. According to Microsoft Office product manager Simon Marks, the Star of David was removed from Bookshelf Symbol 7 due to its proximity to the swastikas, but remains in other fonts shipped by Microsoft.

The removed symbols are shown in the chart below at 0x7E, 0x86, and 0x74.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement,  represents a configuration of a four-wheeled leading bogie, four powered and coupled driving wheels, and two trailing wheels supporting part of the weight of the boiler and firebox. This allows a larger firebox and boiler than the configuration.

This wheel arrangement is commonly known as the Atlantic type, although it is also sometimes called a Milwaukee or 4-4-2 Milwaukee, after the Milwaukee Road, which employed it in high speed passenger service.
==Overview==
While the wheel arrangement and type name Atlantic would come to fame in the fast passenger service competition between railroads in the United States by mid-1895, the tank locomotive version of the Atlantic type first made its appearance in the United Kingdom in 1880, when William Adams designed the 1 Class T of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR).

The is the tank locomotive equivalent of a 4-4-0 American type tender locomotive, but with the frame extended to allow for a fuel bunker behind the cab. This necessitated the addition of a trailing truck to support the additional weight at the rear end of the locomotive. As such, the tank version of the wheel arrangement appeared earlier than the tender version.

The tender version of the originated in the United States of America, evolving from the less stable 2-4-2 Columbia type wheel arrangement, and was built especially for mainline passenger express services. One advantage of the type over its predecessor 4-4-0 American type was that the trailing wheels allowed a larger and deeper firebox to be placed behind the driving wheels.
The first use of the wheel arrangement for a tender locomotive was under an experimental double-firebox locomotive, built to the design of George Strong at the Hinkley Locomotive Works in 1888. The locomotive was not successful and was scrapped soon afterwards. The wheel arrangement was named after the second North American tender locomotive class, built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1894 for use on the Atlantic Coast Line of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway.

Baldwin&#x27;s ideas on 4-4-2 tender locomotives were soon copied in the United Kingdom, initially by Henry Ivatt of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) with his GNR Class C1 &quot;Klondyke Atlantic&quot; of 1898. These were quickly followed by John Aspinall&#x27;s Class 7, known as the &quot;High-Flyer&quot;, for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&amp;YR).

==Usage==

===Austria-Hungary===

The first European Atlantic locomotive type was the Austro-Hungarian IId class of the &quot;Kaiser Ferdinands-Nordbahn&quot; (KFNB). It was built from 1895 and later became the 308 class on the Imperial Royal State Railways (&quot;kaiserlich und königlich Staatsbahnen&quot;, kkStB).

It was followed from 1901 by the XVIb class of the Austrian Northwestern Railway (&quot;Österreichische Nordwestbahn&quot;, ÖNWB) that later became the kkStB class 208, and then by the kkStB 108 class. They were not numerous, though. All three classes together numbered a little more than one hundred locomotives.

Apart from the Austrian locomotives, the Hungarian State Railways (&quot;Magyar Államvasutak&quot; or MÁV) also operated some Atlantic classes.

===Belgium===

In 1939, the National Railway Company of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB) introduced six Class 12 streamlined Atlantic locomotives on the fast lightweight boat trains that ran on the line between Brussels and Ostend. Designed by Raoul Notesse to be capable of speeds of and based on the successful Canadian Pacific Railway 4-4-4 &quot;Jubilee&quot; type semi-streamlined locomotives, but incorporating the ideas on streamlining of André Huet, they were built by John Cockerill at Seraing. They were fully streamlined, except for openings to provide access to the valve gear and motion, and had inside cylinders with outside valve gear to reduce oscillation at speed. The class remained in service until 1962.

===Germany===

The Atlantic, known in Germany as the 2&#x27;B1&#x27; wheel arrangement, enjoyed some short-lived popularity in the German states. Between 1902 and 1906, the class of the Prussian state railways was built to two competing designs, 159 locomotives to the design of August von Borries and 79 locomotives to that of Alfred de Glehn. Between 1908 and 1910, Hanomag built 99 Prussian S 9 locomotives. All were four-cylinder compound engines working on saturated steam. The Prussian Atlantics were withdrawn shortly after the First World War and some were given to France, Belgium and Poland.

Atlantics were also adopted in some other German states.
* Twelve Pfalz P3.1 class locomotives were built for the Palatinate Railway (&quot;Pfalzbahn&quot;) from 1898. In addition, eleven Pfalz P4 class locomotives were built from 1905.
* Fifteen Saxon X V class locomotives were built for the Royal Saxon State Railways from 1902. 
* Eighteen Baden IId class locomotives were built for the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways from 1902.
* In 1900, the Royal Bavarian State Railways imported two 4-4-2 locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States of America and classified them Bavarian S 2/5. Ten more locomotives were built by Maffei in 1904.

===India===
In India, the broad gauge E class was rebuilt in the 1940s and survived into the 1970s.

===Japan===

In 1897, 24 6600 Class Atlantics were built for the gauge Japanese Railways by Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States of America. Six more locomotives, built to the same Japanese design, were built for the Cape Government Railways in South Africa immediately following the completion of the Japanese order.

===Mozambique===
By the 1980s, the last Atlantics at work in the world were a few examples in Mozambique. These survived reported retirements to operate into the beginning of the 21st century, becoming some of the last working steam in the country. Exceptionally, they had outlasted much larger and newer power, including Garratt locomotives.

===Philippines===

The Manila Railway (ancestor to the Philippine National Railways) purchased five 100-class locomotives from the North British Locomotive Company in 1906. These were the first tender locomotives in Philippine service. In 1949, 7 American-built 4-8-2s were also numbered as the 100 class, presuming that the locomotives have been retired after World War II.
===South Africa===

In 1897, additional locomotives were urgently required by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) for the section south of Kimberley, at a time when locomotive production in England was being disrupted by strikes, while simultaneously the steamship companies had suddenly doubled all their freight rates to the Cape of Good Hope. As a result, six locomotives were ordered from Baldwin Locomotive Works. These were built in addition to a just fulfilled order of 6600 Class Atlantics, built for and to a design by the gauge Japanese Railways.

The locomotives were completed within sixty days of receipt of the order and, to circumvent the exorbitant freight charges of the steamship lines, were shipped to the Cape by sailing ship, with the result that the steamship companies promptly reverted to their old rates. Nicknamed the &quot;Hatracks&quot;, the locomotives were designated 4th Class on the CGR. When they came onto South African Railways (SAR) stock in 1912, they were considered obsolete and designated Class 04. They remained in SAR service until 1931.

===United Kingdom===

====Tank locomotives====
The T Atlantic was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1880 by William Adams, who designed the LT&amp;SR 1 Class on behalf of Thomas Whitelegg of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR). This was the first use of this wheel arrangement in the world. It was intended for heavy suburban trains around London and 36 locomotives were built by Sharp, Stewart and Company and Nasmyth, Wilson and Company between 1880 and 1892. Adams later developed the type into his successful suburban 415 class for the London and South Western Railway.

The LT&amp;SR continued to build tank locomotives after 1897, with the Class 37, Class 51 and Class 79. Henry Ivatt of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) also built sixty Class C2 tank locomotives between 1898 and 1907, for use on local and commuter trains in Yorkshire and North London.
During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Atlantic tank locomotive became very popular in the United Kingdom.
* The Great Central Railway’s Class 9K and Class 9L were built between 1903 and 1907. They later became the LNER classes C13 and C14.
* The Great Western Railway’s 2221 Class was built between 1905 and 1912.
* The London and North Western Railway’s &quot;Precursor&quot; Tank Class was built between 1906 and 1909.
* Four classes were introduced by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, the I1 class, I2 class, I3 class and I4 class.

====Tender locomotives====

Following Henry Ivatt’s GNR Class C1 &quot;Klondyke Atlantic&quot; of 1898 and John Aspinall&#x27;s L&amp;YR Class 7 &quot;High-Flyer&quot;, of which forty were built between 1899 and 1902, a lot of interest was shown in the Atlantic type by British railways during the first decade of the twentieth century, especially for express passenger train service. Between 1902 and 1908, Ivatt built eighty larger boilered versions of his GNR Class C1, which were known as the &quot;Large Boiler Class C1&quot;. These remained in service until the early 1950s.

In 1903, for use in comparative trials against his own designs, George Jackson Churchward of the Great Western Railway (GWR) purchased three French De Glehn compound s, beginning with the GWR no. 102 &quot;La France&quot; and followed by two larger locomotives in 1905. Fourteen members of his two-cylinder 2900 &quot;Saint&quot; class locomotives were subsequently either built or rebuilt with this wheel arrangement, including one four-cylinder GWR 4000 &quot;Star&quot; class, no. 40 &quot;North Star&quot;. All of these were later rebuilt to a 4-6-0 wheel arrangement.

Wilson Worsdell of the North Eastern Railway (NER) designed his classes V and 4CC between 1903 and 1906, while his successor on the NER, Vincent Raven, introduced his V/09 and NER Class Z classes between 1910 and 1917. By 1918, however, the type had been largely superseded by the 4-6-0 type in the United Kingdom.

The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) H1 class, introduced by D. E. Marsh in 1905 and 1906, was copied from the plans of the Ivatt C1 class, with minimal alterations. In 1911, L.B. Billinton was granted authority to construct a further six examples incorporating Schmidt superheaters, which became the LB&amp;SCR H2 class.

William Paton Reid of the North British Railway built twenty examples of his North British Atlantic, later known as H class, between 1906 and 1911. Two more were built after his retirement and the whole class became the LNER C11 Class in the 1923 grouping, while John G. Robinson of the Great Central Railway (GCR) introduced his 8D and 8E classes of three-cylinder compound locomotives in 1905 and 1906.

====Preserved locomotives====
Several 4-4-2 locomotives were preserved in the United Kingdom. Bearing in mind that this information may become outdated over time, some known examples are:

* Great Northern Railway no. 990 &quot;Henry Oakley&quot; is part of the National Collection at the National Railway Museum in York, on static display at Bressingham Steam and Gardens in Norfolk.
* Great Northern Railway no. 251, the first large-boilered GNR Class C1, is part of the National Collection.
* The Bluebell Railway has completed a replica of a London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) Atlantic No. 32424 &quot;Beachy Head&quot;, similar to the GNR large boilered Atlantics. They are also in possession of a London and South Western Railway (LSWR) 415 class locomotive, no. 488.
* The Great Western Society is working on a replica of a 4-6-0 &quot;Saint&quot; class locomotive. Some of these ran as Atlantic s for comparative purposes and it was planned that the replica would also run in an Atlantic wheel configuration from time to time.
* One of the four London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;SR) 79 class locomotives, no. 80 &quot;Thundersley&quot;, is preserved at the Bressingham Steam Museum in Norfolk.

===United States===

The original Atlantics in the United States were built with the hauling of wood-frame passenger cars in mind and came in a variety of configurations, including the four-cylinder Vauclain compound which had previously been used on express 4-4-0 American, 4-6-0 Ten-wheeler and 2-4-2 Columbia locomotives. Around the 1910s, railroads started buying heavier steel passenger cars, which precipitated the introduction of the type as the standard passenger locomotive. Nonetheless, the Chicago and North Western, Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Pennsylvania railroads used Atlantics until the end of steam locomotive use in the 1950s, with some even being used in local freight and switching service.
One of the best-known groups of s in the United States was the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s vast fleet of E class Atlantics, culminating in the PRR E6s class.

Although Atlantics were sometimes used as mountain helpers prior to the First World War, they were not well-suited for mountain grades. They had large-diameter driving wheels, in some cases exceeding , which were adequate for trains. They tended to oscillate at higher speeds when the drive rods were connected to the rear pair of drivers. This was not standard practice in the U.S., however. The nation&#x27;s biggest user of the type was the Santa Fe with 178. All of these were built with or drivers and the drive rods connected to the first pair of driving wheels.

In 1905, Santa Fe engineer Charles Losee was widely reported to have driven Atlantic type 510, a 1904 balanced compound built by Baldwin, the from Cameron to Surrey in Illinois with a three car special train in one minute and thirty-five seconds. If that had been confirmed by a disinterested party, the per hour speed would have set a world record. These were never used on the road&#x27;s Rocky Mountain grades; even on the flat plains of Kansas the Atlantics were soon overwhelmed by the weight of the newest all-steel, passenger cars. Despite their excellent performance, most were retired long before other locomotives of their era, and the few survivors wound up on light local trains.

====Milwaukee Road====

The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) used a streamlined Atlantic type on its midwestern &quot;Hiawatha&quot; passenger train service that was instituted in 1935. Four locomotives of the Milwaukee Road class A were constructed for this service in 1935. These s were reportedly the first steam locomotives ever designed and built to reach on a daily basis.

These Atlantics with their distinctive streamlining shrouds were designed by industrial designer Otto Kuhler. Their calculated tractive effort was . An unusual feature of this locomotive was the drive onto the front coupled axle, which improved riding quality at speed.

The locomotives were cross balanced and ran on drivers. They had an oil-fired grate and a rated boiler pressure of , which gave the boiler a high capacity in relation to the cylinders. Designed for a light-weight train of five to six passenger cars, they were considered as probably the fastest steam locomotives ever built in the United States, possibly capable of matching any locomotive in the world. The fleet covered their schedule in 400 minutes with several stops en route, at an average speed of more than on some sections and often arriving with one or two minutes to spare.

In addition, due to the locomotive being designed to operate at higher speeds, the Milwaukee Road’s Atlantics were fitted with Leslie type A-125 air horns instead of the standard steam whistle.

All four locomotives were withdrawn and scrapped between 1949 and 1951.

====Preserved locomotives====
Several 4-4-2 locomotives were preserved in the United States. Bearing in mind that this information may become outdated over time, some known examples are:
* Southern Pacific no. 3025 at the Travel Town Museum in Los Angeles, CA.
* Chicago &amp; North Western no. 1015 at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, MO.
* Pennsylvania Railroad E6s no. 460 at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, PA.
* Pennsylvania Railroad no. 7002, formerly no. 8063, at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, PA. It has steamed since preservation, but is now static.
* Michigan Central no. 254 (later no. 7953, then New York Central no. 8085 before being sold to the Detroit, Toledo &amp; Ironton Railroad as no. 45) at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, MI.
* Central Railroad of New Jersey no. 592 at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD.

<doc id="1186927" wikidata="Q242091" url="?curid=1186927" title="Carentan">
<text>Carentan () is a small rural town near the north-eastern base of the French Cotentin Peninsula in Normandy in north-western France, with a population of about 6,000. It is a former commune in the Manche department. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Carentan-les-Marais. The town was a strategic early goal of the World War II landings as capturing the town was necessary to link the lodgements at Utah and Omaha beaches which were divided by the Douve river estuary (nearby fields were flooded by the Germans up to the town&#x27;s outskirts). The town was also needed as an intermediate staging position for the capture of the cities of Cherbourg and Octeville, with the critically important port facilities in Cherbourg.

==History==
Carentan is close to the sites of the medieval Battle of Formigny of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The town is also likely the site of the historical references to the ancient Gallic port of Crociatonum (documented by Roman sources), a possession of the Unelli (or Veneli or also Venelli) tribe (Greek: Οὐένελοι) situated on the river Douve slightly inland from the beaches at Normandy. The gently sloping terrain in the nearby river valley was excellent for boat construction. 
===World War II===

In the early hours of June 6, 1944, the U.S. 82nd Airborne and 101st Airborne divisions landed at the base of the Cotentin Peninsula. Although the landings were scattered, they nevertheless secured most of the routes by which the U.S. VII Corps would advance from Utah Beach, the right (west) flank of the Allied forces separated from the landings at Omaha and the other beachheads by the river Douve. The U.S. 4th Infantry Division landed on Utah Beach shortly after dawn with few casualties, and began staging for a move against Cherbourg, a fortified port critical to future Allied operations.

In the immediate aftermath of the landings, the priority for the Allies at Utah Beach was to link up with the Allied landings further east. This job was assigned to the 101st Airborne, who had landed in the area and had been both conducting raids against inland targets (such as artillery emplacements) and securing and cutting off the area from German reinforcements.

By June 9, the 101st Airborne had reorganized sufficiently from the haphazard scattering of its units. It managed to cross the flooded Douve using a few causeways across the flooded fields. The next day Carentan fell to the 101st in the Battle of Carentan. Beginning with a dawn assault, it was an all-day, hard-fought, house-to-house battle against German troops embedded in strongly prepared positions. The capture of the town gave the Allies a continuous front joining Omaha to Utah Beach and the other three lodgments to the east of Omaha. US forces maintained possession of the town despite a German armor-reinforced counterattack on June 13 just to the southwest of town known as the Battle of Bloody Gulch.

On 15 June, engineers of the Ninth Air Force IX Engineering Command began construction on a combat advanced landing ground for fighter aircraft south of the town. Declared operational on 25 June, the airfield was designated, &quot;A-10&quot;. It was used by P-47 Thunderbolts of the 50th Fighter Group until mid-August, then as a support airfield for supplies and evacuation of wounded personnel until its closure in November. Today, a small private airfield is located on part of the wartime facility.

===101st Airborne March===
The &quot;101st Airborne March&quot; was composed by Daniel Bourdelès, a Norman composer, for the celebration of the liberation of Carentan, in June 1944. This march created in Carentan is extracted from the CD &quot;Carentan, the sky memory&quot; (1994), produced by the town. It is regularly used as a musical illustration for the Normandy liberation films on France3 regional TV.

<doc id="1186928" wikidata="Q2736986" url="?curid=1186928" title="Battle of Karnal">
<text>The Battle of Karnal (Persian: نبرد کرنال) (24 February 1739) was a decisive victory for Nader Shah, the founder of the Afsharid dynasty of Iran, during his invasion of India. Nader&#x27;s forces defeated the army of Muhammad Shah within three hours, paving the way for the Iranian sack of Delhi. The engagement is considered the crowning jewel in Nader&#x27;s military career as well as a tactical masterpiece. The battle took place near Karnal in Haryana, north of Delhi, India.

The battle was the culminating point of Nader Shah&#x27;s invasion of the Mughal Empire. After his conquest of eastern Afghanistan and invasion via Kabul and Peshawar, Nader led his forces south towards the Mughal capital. At Delhi Muhammad Shah gathered an extremely large force with which he marched north before his cumbersome army ground to a halt at Karnal. Nader gave battle and won a crushing victory. In the negotiations following the catastrophic defeat, Muhammad Shah agreed to pay a large indemnity in exchange for maintaining his imperium over his lands. Nader, however, forced the Mughal emperor to submit utterly and marched him to his capital, Delhi, where the Mughal treasury was plundered. An uprising against Nader&#x27;s soldiers by Delhi&#x27;s citizens ended in a bloody massacre in which the entire city was sacked and looted. The enormous plunder gained in Delhi caused Nader to issue an imperial decree removing all taxes for a total of three years. The Persian army soon departed and left behind 30,000 dead. Muhammad Shah was also forced to concede all his lands west of the Indus, which were annexed by Nader Shah.

As a result of the overwhelming defeat of the Mughal Empire at Karnal, the already-declining Mughal dynasty was critically weakened to such an extent as to hasten its demise. According to Axworthy, it is also possible that without the ruinous effects of Nader&#x27;s invasion of India, European colonial takeover of the Indian subcontinent would have come in a different form or perhaps not at all.

==Nader&#x27;s &quot;casus belli&quot;==
A popular destination for the plethora of Afghan mercenaries and warlords who were defeated in Nader&#x27;s numerous campaigns against the various polities in Afghanistan was the northern border areas of the Mughal Empire. Nader had sent several requests to the local governors and statesmen of northern India that these fugitives be captured and handed over to him. In the aftermath of his conquest of Afghanistan, Nader was seeking a pretext to invade the Mughal Empire. He seized upon that opportunity to mask his invasion in the form of a hunt for the Afghan warriors who had found asylum in the rugged terrain of the northern Mughal realm.

It is also noteworthy that Nader had been in contact with one of the main Mughal ministers, Nizam-ul-Mulk, who some at the time accused of treachery against the Mughal emperor. It is possible that Nizam-ul-Mulk provoked Nader&#x27;s invasion of the Mughal Empire, but that is an implausible conjecture.

Whether or not the Mughal Empire could have defused the situation diplomatically is still a matter of discussion. It is noteworthy that many attempts by Nader for diplomacy faced serious acts of aggression by Mughal empire. For instance Mughal Emperor would not receive Nader&#x27;s letter to him, nor would he let his ambassador leave. Also the second envoy sent envoy sent to deliver the letter was turned back at Jalalabad, and then murdered by a neighbouring chieftain. Which resulted in Nader Sacking of Jalalabad.
The ability of the Mughal state to find and imprison Afghan fugitives in its border regions is a seriously doubtful issue, as is anyway the actual number of fugitives who escaped to these regions. It is very possible that they were an insubstantial number. Nader Shah&#x27;s intention to invade Mughal India would have continued, regardless of whether or not the Mughal authorities had granted his request to seek out and handing over fugitives.

==Nader&#x27;s entry into the Mughal Empire==
As Nader moved into the Mughal territories, he was accompanied by his Georgian subject and future king of eastern Georgia, Erekle II, who led a Georgian contingent in the Imperial Persian army. Hearing of Nader Shah&#x27;s approach from Qandahar, the governor of Peshawar and Kabul raised an army of 20,000 men, mostly of Afghan mercenaries drawn from the tribes of eastern Afghanistan to check the Persian advance. The position that had been chosen to resist the Persian army could scarcely have been better selected, as through the narrow Khyber Pass, only a small column of men could hope to march and any deployment into fighting formations would be an impossibility. Nader, convinced of the futility of a head-on struggle, instead opted for an alternative approach. A local guide informed him of a difficult yet traversable pass running parallel to that of Khyber: the Pass of Chatchoobi.

Setting out on 26 November from near Jalal Abad, the Persian army arrived at Barikab (33 kilometres from the Kheibar pass) where Nader divided his army, leaving Morteza Mirza behind with the bulk of the forces at his disposal and sending forth 12,000 men to the Khyber Pass under Nasrollah Qoli while he gathered 10,000 chosen light cavalry under his direct command. Beginning an epic flank-march of over 80 kilometres through some of the most unnavigable terrain in Asia Nader reached Ali-Masjed whence the 10,000 curved their route of march northwards and onto the eastern end of the Kheibar pass.

The abrupt emergence of a strong body of cavalry in their rear caught the governor&#x27;s forces in a difficult position, though they managed to resist for a short while before Nader&#x27;s light cavalry routed them entirely. Thus, the path to the north-lands of the Mughal Empire was cleared and the main body of the Imperial Persian army could march into the Mughal interior.

On 16 November 1739, Nader marched his advance guard out of Peshawar heading south towards Sindh river in Punjab. Upon crossing the river the Persian army fell upon the defenceless countryside on its way to Lahor pillaging and burning as they went. The governor of Lahor began augmenting his battlements in the hope of resistance. Nader hastened his advance and attacked from an unexpected direction with such force that after a mere day had passed, the governor surrendered to the Shah&#x27;s will. The gift of two million rupees to the Shah secured the governor in his position as ruler of Lahor.

==Muhammad Shah gathers a large force==
The news of the series of conquests by Nader&#x27;s invading army had caused much consternation at the Mughal court of Muhammad Shah residing in Delhi. Nizam-ul-Mulk was summoned to the Emperor&#x27;s presence and many summons were sent out across northern India for contribution of military forces. 13 December saw the Mughal army march out of Delhi to confront the invading forces to the north. The enormity of its size was such that the length of the column was 25 kilometres and the width was 3 kilometres. Muhammad Shah himself joined this army. Due to the cumbersome size of the Mughal army, Muhammad Shah could not take his forces any further than Karnal, approximately 120 kilometres north of Delhi.

In total, Muhammad Shah commanded a war-camp of 300,000 troops including the non-combatants equipped with 3,000 guns along with 2,000 war elephants. Out these the forces deployed on the field were numbered at 75,000. Despite the large numbers at the Mughal&#x27;s disposal they suffered from obsolescent war material and antiquated tactical systems. Almost all of the guns in the army were far too large in calibre to be considered field artillery as they were practically impossible to manoeuvre during battle and took such a long time to reload that they would have minimal effect even in cases of correct utilisation. In contrast, most of Nader&#x27;s artillery was lighter and much more manoeuvrable than their Mughal counterparts, as well as the zamburaks which provided extra mobile fire power. In contrast to the Mughal army&#x27;s infantry, all of the 20,000 Persian musketeers (jazyarechi) were uniformed, drilled and homogeneously organised. Although the 50,000 cavalry contingent in the Mughal army was of excellent quality, there was nothing to suggest a common and cohesive underlying military structure set out for their deployment and use. The Persian cavalry was composed of two parts. The troops of the state which were trained and drilled via a uniform system, and the auxiliary troops which were recruited into the Imperial army after the conquest of their homeland.

Nader sent out a raiding party of 6,000 Kurdish riders with the objective of gathering intelligence and bringing back prisoners for the purposes of interrogation. The raiding party ambushed a contingent of the Mughal artillery and made away with a number of prisoners which they carried back to camp. Leaving the main body of his forces under the command of his son, Morteza Mirza, Nader gathered a smaller force and advanced on an old fortress, Azimabad, a mere 32 kilometres from Karnal. Azimabad was easily subdued after the Persian guns had been brought up against its fortifications.

Here Nader met with the leader of the 6,000 strong scouting division of Kurds. He was informed on the geography of the surroundings of Karnal and the strength of the Mughal camp&#x27;s division. He decided to quietly position his forces far east of the Mughal camp and to draw Muhammad Shah into battle at a place of his choosing.

==Battle==
===Dispositions and deployments===
On 23 February, the Persian army broke camp and entered the valley between the Alimardan and the Jamna Rivers. Encamping north of the village of Kanjpura, Nader rode out to inspect the enemy&#x27;s position himself. Upon returning to camp, Nader summoned all the officers in the army for a speech. Later in the day, news reached Nader of a large contingent of Mughals marching through Panipat with the purpose of joining Muhammad Shah&#x27;s army. The man leading this contingent was a confidant of Muhammad Shah and high-ranking statesman of the Mughal Empire, Sa&#x27;adat Khan. Nader began devising a stratagem based around using Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s approach to lure the main Mughal army across Alimardan river and into the valley before Kanjpura village where he intended to give battle from an advantageous position. The long-awaited Sa&#x27;adat Khan entered the Mughal encampment to much jubilation; however, the bulk of his column (some twenty or thirty thousand soldiers) was still en route.
On the morning of 24 February, Nader divided his men into three main bodies. The centre of the army was positioned just north of the village of Kanjpura facing west and commanded by Nader&#x27;s son, Morteza Mirza (who would later be renamed Nassrollah Qoli in honour of his achievements in the coming battle), with a retinue of senior advisers at his disposal. To Morteza Qoli&#x27;s north, Tahmasp Khan Jalayer commanded the right flank of the army, and to the south, joint command of the left was given to Fath-Ali Khan Kiani and Lotf-Ali Khan Afshar.

At this juncture, news was brought to Sa&#x27;adat Khan that the rearguard of his column had come under attack, and 500 richly laden camels from his baggage train had been captured and carried off by the enemy. Although Sa&#x27;adat Khan had managed to reach the Mughal camp late the previous night, a large portion of his forces, some twenty or thirty thousand men, were still en route at the time of his arrival. Without consulting or convening either Muhammad Shah or other commanders, Sa&#x27;adat Khan immediately mounted his war elephant and rode out to the reported site of the skirmish. He was accompanied by just a thousand horsemen and a similar number of foot soldiers, although an additional 4,000 men later joined him after further summons. His cannons, being immobile, were all left behind. Sa&#x27;adat Khan engaged the isolated Persian cavalry units deployed in the vicinity of the area, which made a show of resistance before feigning a rout towards the east. Sending urgent reports back to camp of the upper hand he had gained, Sa&#x27;adat Khan pleaded for reinforcements in order to complete the victory.

As the reports reached the Mughal high command, disagreement arose as to whether these calls for reinforcement ought to be answered. Muhammad Shah was eager to join Sa&#x27;adat Khan in the field, but his two chief advisers, Nizam-ul-Mulk and Khan Dowran, advised caution against rash decisions. A frustrated Muhammad Shah made insinuations regarding the martial character of Khan Dowran, to which he responded zealously by donning armour and mounting his war elephant in preparation for battle. Khan-i Dauran declared that it was not the Indian style to abandon a friend, even if he was imprudent. The initial total of men leaving the Mughal camp alongside Khan Dowran amounted to no more than 8,000–9,000 men, mostly cavalry with some musket-bearing infantry. A steady stream of reinforcements left the Mughal encampment to cross the Alimardan river and join battle throughout the day, but there was no effort to bring these large numbers under a unified deployment east of the Alimardan river in support of Mughal units already engaged. Instead, the Mughals at the front would receive a continuous line of reinforcements with no grand tactical plan to help direct them.

===Nader divides the Mughals on the centre and left wing===
As Nader observed the advance of Sa&#x27;adat Khan in the direction of the Persian centre, he sent out a 500-strong unit of his elite jazāyerchi mounted infantry to further entice them along. He also sent out another unit to lure Khan Dowran on an altogether different path and to eventually lead the latter into an ambush at the village of Kanjpura. This ambushing force consisted of three one thousand strong units of dismounted cavalry from the Qajar, Bakhtiari and Kurdish tribes, waiting behind the village&#x27;s walls with their heavy jazāyer muskets. They were further supported by large numbers of camel-mounted zamburak light artillery. Nader himself took his position behind them, personally commanding a chosen force of 1,000 cavalry drawn from the ranks of the Afshar clan.
Meanwhile, Sa&#x27;adat Khan delayed his advance to allow Khan Dowran&#x27;s men to come up. However the jealously between the two Mughal commanders proved too strong for either of them to share credit, and before long Sa&#x27;adat Khan resumed his advance east. In the meantime Nizam-ul-Mulk began slowly forming up his men behind the Alimardan river, in a lethargic attempt at supporting the leading elements of the army.

The Persian centre was eagerly awaiting the arrival of Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s men with loaded muskets and cannons. As the Mughals came into range, the screening force of Persian mounted infantry fell away, to reveal a line of levelled guns. A devastating volley was fired onto the Mughal ranks, mowing down many men. As a great testament to their bravery, Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s men braced against the punishing fire from the Persian line. They were even able to close with the centre and a general melee ensued, bringing great pressure onto the Persian centre. mughal army retreated, Rao Bal Kishan and five thousand ahirs were martyred fighting with the Persian forces.

===Ambush at Kanjpura===

Further to the south, where the Persian left flank was positioned at Kanjpura, Khan Dowran played right into Nader&#x27;s hands as his pursuit suddenly marched right into a bloody ambush. The sudden appearance of Persian troops from the environs of Kanjpura paralysed the Mughals. The sheer volume of fire from the jazāyers and zamburaks raked incredible destruction on the unfortunate Mughal soldiers caught in the bewildering mayhem Nader had concocted.

Nader observed the massacre from behind the main line of jazāyers as they fired volley after volley into the reeling enemy before them. The cavalry of Khan Dowran, consisting of Indian Muslims, looked down on fighting with muskets with contempt, which was a talent of the mostly Hindu infantrymen in India. They prided themselves on sword-play and fancy-riding, while musketeers were not given importance in the Mughal military compared to Iran. The heavy bullets of the jazāyer muskets, and the even more powerful cannonballs of the zamburaks, easily penetrated the armour of the war elephants. Many nobles were killed and captured amongst the Mughals; Khan Dowran himself was struck. Badly injured, he fell from his elephant as his own blood splattered over him, prompting his remaining retainers to scramble to his aid.

Tahmasp Khan Jalayer, in command of the Persian right, was not engaged until this phase in the battle and began wrapping his forces around the left flank of Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s men from the north. After two hours of intense fighting in the centre, Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s war elephant became entangled with another and in the frenzy a Persian soldier climbed the side of the Khan&#x27;s beast and implored him to surrender. Being caught in an impossible set of circumstances Sa&#x27;adat Khan decided to lay down his arms. Many other Mughal soldiers followed suit while others broke and fled west. With the cream of the enemy army utterly decimated and the rest fleeing across the Alimardan river the Persians engaged in an organised pursuit with Nader halting his forces just out of range of the Mughal battle line drawn up behind the river. Unwilling to engage the Mughals on disadvantageous ground Nader re-established his lines in the valley to the east. Muhammad Shah urged the Nizam to help Khan Dowran, but the Nizam moved no further and ignored all pleas for action. The Nizam had held a grudge with the general Khan Dowran, who had jeered at him in the past, saying, &quot;See how the Deccan monkey dances&quot;.

Nader later sent troops around the periphery of the Mughal encampment to form a blockade by cutting the logistical lines leading into Muhammad Shah&#x27;s camp. The news of Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s capture and the rumoured death of Khan Dowran along with so many other high ranking Mughal officers caused a collapse in the morale of the army. The loss of hope led to mutiny in some cases and groups of soldiers began plundering the camp.

===Losses and consequences===
The Mughals suffered far heavier casualties than the Persians. Exact figures are uncertain as accounts of that period were prone to bombast. Various contemporary commentators estimated Mughal casualties being up to 30,000 men slain with most agreeing on a figure of around 20,000 and with Axworthy giving an estimate of roughly 10,000 Mughal soldiers killed. Nader himself claimed that his army slew 20,000 and imprisoned &quot;many more&quot;. The number of Mughal officers slain amounted to a staggering 400. Though as a proportion of the entire Mughal army the actual casualties suffered were not excessive, this masks the fact that the casualties constituted the very best of the Mughal army, including an overwhelming number of its leaders.

The Mughals had been defeated in part due to their outdated cannons. In addition, Indian elephants were an easy target for Persian artillery and Persian troops were more skilled with a musket.

The nature of the casualties caused great despair amongst the remaining Mughals who as a consequence of the crushing defeat were unable to maintain their discipline. Soon after morale collapsed, the soldiers looted their own camp, many deserted and any will to fight again evaporated. One of the most painful losses was that of Khan Dowran. He was brought back badly wounded and his loyal retainers could not even find a place for him to rest his head. Nizam-ul-Mulk, due to a long-standing enmity, came to Khan Dowran&#x27;s side as he was dying in order to ridicule him before his death. The Khan died that evening surrounded by his few surviving followers.

Recent scholarship gives an estimate of the total Persian casualties at a mere 1,100 including 400 killed and 700 wounded. This number comprised such a small fraction of the Persian army as to be negligible.
Sa&#x27;adat Khan was taken to Nader that very evening. The Khan advised the Shah to call upon Nizam-ul-Mulk as he was the &quot;key to the Empire&quot;. Soon afterward, Nizam-ul-Mulk and a following of other Mughal negotiators arrived at Nader&#x27;s camp.

Although the meeting was initially tense, with the Mughal plenipotentiaries arriving with armour instead of plain clothing, Nader soon requested that he and Nizam-ul-Mulk be left alone to discuss matters more freely. Once alone with the Shah, Nizam-ul-Mulk humbly claimed that his life was entirely at his mercy. Nader impressed upon him the importance of Muhammad Shah agreeing to pay an indemnity to the Persian crown. Having convinced Nizam-ul-Mulk to request the Mughal Emperor&#x27;s personal presence in the Persian camp, Nader sent him away.

26 February saw the Mughal Emperor travel to meet with his Persian counterpart amongst much pomp and circumstance. Nader paid Muhammad Shah the respect worthy of an Emperor and conversed with him in Turkic. After making obeisance, Nader Shah remarked, &quot;Brother, you have three faithful servants, and the rest are traitors; those three are Nasir Khan, Khan-i Dauran Khan and Muhammad Khan; from these I have received no letters.&quot; After the conclusion of the negotiations the Mughal party returned to their encampment west of Alimardan river.

A sharp dispute arose regarding who would replace Khan Dowran in his office. Muhammad Shah interceded on Nizam-ul-Mulk&#x27;s behalf which enraged many other notables, chief amongst them Sa&#x27;adat Khan. It is claimed that Sa&#x27;adat Khan entered into secret correspondence with Nader and incited the Shah to march to Delhi in order to extract a much larger indemnity from Muhammad Shah.

==Mughal submission and sacking of Delhi==
In early March, Nader summoned Nizam-ul-Mulk once again and unilaterally declared the previous agreements to be null and void. Nizam-ul-Mulk protested but was forced to write Muhammad Shah to implore him to once again travel to the Persian camp. Muhammad Shah complied and thereafter permanently remained in Nader&#x27;s presence (and custody). In an act of mercy, Nader allowed the Mughal soldiers still in their camp to leave with their mounts and livestock, and he also gave an advance payment to all of his own soldiers, in addition to the Persian camp followers. Tahmasp Khan Jalayer, one of Nader&#x27;s most dependable lieutenants, was given the task of marching ahead in the company of Sa&#x27;adat Khan on the route to Delhi.

===Persian occupation of Delhi===
Nader entered Delhi with Mohammed Shah as his vassal on 20 March 1739. The person of the Shah was accompanied by 20,000 Savaran-e Saltanati (royal guard), and 100 war elephants mounted by his Jazāyerchi. As the conqueror of Delhi entered, the city&#x27;s fortification fired their guns in salute. The Persians received a sumptuous welcome in Muhammad Shah&#x27;s palace. Sa&#x27;adat Khan was tasked by Nader to collect taxes from the citizens of Delhi and did his best to please the Shah in an attempt to ingratiate himself with his obsequious behaviour. However, when Sa&#x27;adat Khan sought an audience with Nader, the Shah chastised him harshly for not collecting the taxes with satisfactory speed. After Sa&#x27;adat Khan&#x27;s humiliating defeat at Karnal, his open disloyalty to his emperor in the aftermath, his ignominious failure to curry favour with the person he believed was his new patron, forced to rob his own people of their wealth for a foreign invading host, he became burdened to such an extent that he died in Delhi no more than just a few days after his arrival in that city.

Nader Shah was intent on establishing control through his new vassal, Muhammad Shah, and made clear his intent to keep him enthroned. As such, strict military discipline was maintained and a decree made any harassment of civilians punishable by mutilation. Nader found the Mughal aristocracy soft and weak. In an encounter with a Mughal minister, Nader enquired as to how many women he had in his harem, the minister answered 850. Nader quipped that he would add another 150 slave girls in order to promote him to the rank of &quot;minbashi&quot; (commander of a thousand). On 21 March Nader celebrated Nowruz, the Persian new year, and many generals and officers were given gifts and promotions.

===Mughal Uprising and sack of Delhi===

Rumours began spreading amongst the populace of Delhi that a gratuitous levy was imminent. There were also tales of Muhammad Shah seizing Nader and or having him killed one way or another. When a rumour broke out that Nader himself had been assassinated, a posse of Delhi citizens gathered around a granary as a group of Persian soldiers had been sent to negotiate prices, and the posse attacked and killed five Persian soldiers. The event sparked an uprising, and bands of civilians swept through the city and targeted isolated Persian soldiers in succession. When news was taken to Nader, he was dismissive, believing his soldiers were seeking out a pretext to ransack the city. But after successive reports of lynchings, Nader sent one of his retainers to verify these claims. He sent another of his inner circle also, but both were killed by the baying crowds. Nader sent out a &quot;fowj&quot; (a thousand-strong unit) but ordered them to engage only those involved in the violence.

The uprising in Delhi took on greater momentum as the reinforcing detachments sent by Nader to restore order came under fire from muskets and arrows. Numerous isolated contingents from the Persian army were caught holed up in scattered complexes throughout the city that night. On the morning of 22 March, Nader rode out from the palace in which he had quartered during the night and headed towards the Rowshan O-Dowleh mosque. En route, a musket was fired from a nearby building, narrowly missing Nader and instead killing one of his generals. Once atop the roof of the mosque, Nader ordered his men to enter into all districts in which Persian soldiers had been killed and to leave not a single survivor. He raised his sword, signifying the start of a massacre.
Three thousand soldiers marched out of the mosque&#x27;s courtyard and began a gruesome and blood-curdling mass killing. Nader Shah &quot;sat with sword in hand, wearing a solemn face steeped in melancholy and lost in deep thought. No man dared break the silence.&quot; Smoke rose above the city with ceaseless sounds of suffering and pleading echoing throughout. There was sparse resistance and most people were killed with no fighting chance. Many men were arrested and taken to the river Yamuna where they were all beheaded in cold blood. The soldiers entered houses and killed all the inhabitants, plundered all the riches they found and then set fire to what remained. The murder and rapine was such that many men chose to kill both themselves and their families instead of being subjected and slaughtered by the Persian soldiery.

Two of the most important Mughal nobles who were involved in instigating the uprising were Seyed Niaz Khan and Shahnawaz Khan. Niaz Khan and a small band of followers took the small group of Persian soldiers posted outside his residence for his protection by surprise and killed all of them. He next joined up with Shahnawaz Khan and attacked the stables in which Nader Shah had stored all the captured Indian war elephants. The stables were soon overrun and the two even managed to escape the city during the cacophony of violence with the elephants. They took refuge in a fort near the city. The Persian soldiers, however, sought them out and broke into the fort, taking Niaz Khan and Shahnawaz Khan prisoner with their few hundred followers. All of them were taken to Nader near the mosque. All of them were beheaded by Nader&#x27;s command on the spot. The only group of prisoners Nader released were women.
The slaughter, which had begun late in the evening the day before, continued until dawn the next day, when Nader sent out his officers and messengers proclaiming the end of the massacre. The swiftness of the Persian army&#x27;s cessation of hostility was remarkable and many contemporary commentators stated their admiration for the strict discipline of Nader&#x27;s army. Although the killing lasted only a few hours, the number of dead was immense. Some 30,000 men, women and children perished at the hands of the Persian soldiers. After the conclusion of this most unfortunate episode in Delhi&#x27;s history, Nader&#x27;s officials began collecting taxes and some were also sent out to Delhi&#x27;s environs to do the same. Not even Muhammad Shah&#x27;s ministers were safe, and one in particular was tortured and his wealth seized by force of arms.
Nader sent forth 1,000 cavalrymen to each district of the city to ensure the collection of taxes. But perhaps the greatest riches were plundered from the treasuries of the Mughal dynasty&#x27;s capital. The Peacock Throne was also taken away by the Persian army, and thereafter served as a symbol of Persian imperial might. Among a trove of other fabulous jewels, Nader also gained the Koh-i-Noor (&quot;Mountain of Light&quot;) and Darya-ye Noor (&quot;Sea of Light&quot;) diamonds. It is estimated that the total worth of the treasures plundered came to perhaps 700 million rupees. This was roughly the equivalent to £90 million sterling at the time, or £8.2 billion sterling in the early 21st century.

The Mughal Emperor was forced to sign a number of treaties, which brought further ruin to his realm. All lands west of the Indus were ceded to the Persian Empire. Nader also sought to establish marital bonds between the two dynasties and arranged marriages for his sons and generals as well as himself. Having gained all the riches he desired, Nader made preparations for his departure.

Persian troops left Delhi at the beginning of May 1739, also taking with them thousands of elephants, horses, and camels, all loaded with the booty they had collected. The plunder seized from India was so rich that Nader stopped taxation in Persia for a period of three years following his return. On Nader&#x27;s return to Iran, Sikhs fell upon Nader&#x27;s army and seized a large amount of booty and freed the slaves in captivity.

The Persian army marched north toward the Hindu Kush. An audience of governors was called by Nader from his newly acquired lands in northern India. All came bearing gifts and protestations of their loyalty to their new overlord except one. Khodayar Khan, governor of Sindh, had bargained on Nader being content with his enormous plunder and already considerable territorial acquisitions, and so he deemed himself safe from Nader. Khodayar Khan believed that Nader would not traverse the punishingly rugged terrain of the Hindu Kush mountains so late into the campaigning season. He was mistaken.

The Maathir-ul-Umara states that Khudayar Khan answered:

&quot;We from the time of our forefathers were the servants of the King of India, if we had shown an inclination for you, you would not have believed us.&quot;
==Historic ramifications==
Nader Shah&#x27;s victory against the crumbling Mughal Empire in the East meant that he could afford to turn to the West and face Persia&#x27;s archrivals, the Ottomans, once again. The Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I initiated the Ottoman–Persian War (1743–1746) in which Muhammad Shah closely co-operated with the Ottomans, as well as after, until his death in 1748. Nader&#x27;s Indian campaign alerted the British East India Company to the extreme weakness of the Mughal Empire and the possibility of expanding British imperialism to fill the power vacuum.

As a result of the defeat of the Mughal Empire at Karnal, the already-declining Mughal dynasty was critically weakened to such an extent as to hasten its demise. According to Axworthy, it is also possible that without the ruinous effects of Nader&#x27;s invasion of India, the European colonial takeover of the Indian subcontinent would have come in a different form or perhaps not at all, which would have fundamentally changed the history of the Indian Subcontinent.

<text>The Waikato Plains (the alternative name Waikato Basin is an ambiguous term as it can refer to the entire river catchment) form a large area of low-lying land in the northwest of the North Island of New Zealand. They are the alluvial plains of the Waikato River, the country&#x27;s longest river with a length of .

==Geography==
The plains can be divided roughly into the Middle Waikato Plain (also Middle Waikato Basin Hamilton Basin ), extending in all directions around the city of Hamilton, and the Lower Waikato Plain, nearer the river&#x27;s mouth. The two are broken by the rough, low-lying hills of the Hakarimata Range, between Ngāruawāhia and Huntly, and the Taupiri Range.

The region is heavily populated by New Zealand standards, with many living in Hamilton towards the center of the plains.

The plains are an area of once swampy land, much of which was drained by the early settlers, such as the Morrin brothers in the late 18th century and is now intensively farmed. Dairy cattle, sheep, grain and maize are all farmed here, but it is dairy farming that is the staple of the local economy. The lower plain is also known for vineyards, and the middle plain has some of the southern hemisphere&#x27;s top thoroughbred stables, notably around the towns of Cambridge and Matamata.

A considerable amount of the land is peaty, and significant sections especially in the north east are still undrained swamp. Dozens of shallow riverine lakes lie at the central and southern end of the lower plain, notably Lake Waikare.

This part of the Wailkato watershed is currently managed as the Middle Waikato Management Zone and the Lower Waikato Management Zone.

===Geology===

There is geological evidence that the Hamilton Basin portion was formed as a rift valley. The normal faulting associated with this may have become inactive before 350,000 years ago, although in lake sediments there is evidence of significant local earthquake activity as recently as 7600 years ago, but epicenters may relate to known current active fault systems to the north east of the plains.

The basement is Waipapa Morrinsville Terrane greywacke formed in the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (160-120 ).

The Hamilton Basin originally formed under water so marine Pliocene beds underlie Quaternary deposits that date from about 1.8 million years ago. The oldest deposits are called the Puketoka Formation which contains clays, sands, breccias and ignimbrite sheets from pyroclastic flow reaching the basin. The younger Waerenga Gravels are composed of weathered greywacke debris presumably deposited in fans extending from the surrounding ranges. Even younger, and so closer to the surface usually, is the Karapiro Formation with rhyolitic sands and gravels which can be weathered to clay.

The Waikato River over, even the last 1800 years, has changed course many times in the basin. It has changed course even more spectacularly on at least four occasions in the last 100,000 years, flowing northeast from the region of the current Lake Karapiro, and exiting near Thames in the Hauraki Gulf leaving drainage of the basin to the Waipa River which has not always been a tributary to the Waikato River. Between 65,000 years to at most 25,000 years ago it drained the Waikato Plains but then drained through the Hauraki Plains for 6,000 years returning to drain the Waikato Plains from around 19,000 years ago. So only in recent times,again, has it flowed northwest to empty into the Tasman Sea near Port Waikato. This means the recent sedimentary deposits near the river are mainly altered volcanics washed down from the North Island Volcanic Plateau and broken down volcanic soils but there are layers of tephra/breccia from the many significant rhyolitic eruptions to the south where recent river flooding has not been disruptive. Layers of the fifteen layer Kauroa Ash Formation are found within both the Puketoka and Karapiro Formation depending upon where you are in the basin. The ash beds can be many meters thick, although thin out north of Hamilton, and include the eight layer thick Hamilton Ash Formation deposited between 350,000 and 100,000 years ago. There are also tephras derived from the andesitic stratovolcanoes of the Tongariro and Taranaki regions, as well as from Mayor Island/Tuhua. The airfall tephra layers of the last 50,000 years vary from between thick.

<doc id="1186932" wikidata="Q723835" url="?curid=1186932" title="Swiss-system tournament">
<text>A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format that features a fixed number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than for a round-robin tournament; thus each competitor (team or individual) does not play all the other competitors. Competitors meet one-on-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but does not play the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds. With an even number of participants, all competitors play in each round.

The Swiss system is used for competitions in which there are too many entrants for a full round-robin (all-play-all) to be feasible, and eliminating any competitors before the end of the tournament is undesirable. In contrast, all-play-all is suitable if there are a small number of competitors; whereas a single-elimination (knockout) tournament rapidly reduces the number of competitors, but the best competitor may not necessarily win, as good competitors might perform poorly in a single match or eliminate and exhaust each other if they meet in early rounds.

Unlike group format or other systems in which all pairings are known from the beginning of the competition, in a Swiss system the match pairing for each round is done after the previous round has ended and depends on its results.

The Swiss system seeks to provide a clear winner with a large number of competitors and a relatively small number of rounds of competition, without a single bad result terminating participation.

The system was first employed at a chess tournament in Zürich in 1895 by Julius Müller, hence the name &quot;Swiss system&quot;, and is now used in many games including bridge, chess, and go, among others.

==Pairing procedure==
During all but the first round, competitors are paired based on approximately how they have performed so far. In the first round, competitors are paired either randomly or according to some pattern that has been found to serve a given game or sport well. If it is desired for top-ranked participants to meet in the last rounds, the pattern must start them in different brackets, just the same as is done in seeding of pre-ranked players for a single elimination tournament. In subsequent rounds, competitors are sorted according to their cumulative scores and are assigned opponents with the same or similar score up to that point. The pairing rules have to be quite complicated, as they have to ensure that no two players ever oppose each other twice, and to avoid giving a player some advantage as a result of chance.

The detailed pairing rules are different in different variations of the Swiss system. As they are quite complicated, and it is undesirable to have a long delay between rounds to decide the pairings, the tournament organizer often uses a computer program to do the pairing.

In chess, a specific pairing rule, called &quot;Dutch system&quot; by FIDE, is often implied when the term &quot;Swiss&quot; is used. The Monrad system for pairing is commonly used in chess in Denmark and Norway, as well as in other sports worldwide. These two systems are outlined below.

===Dutch system===
The players are divided into groups based on their scores. Within each group with the same or similar score, players are ranked based on ratings or some other criteria. Subject to the other pairing rules, the top half is then paired with the bottom half. For instance, if there are eight players in a score group, number 1 is paired with number 5, number 2 is paired with number 6 and so on. Modifications are then made to prevent competitors from meeting each other twice, and to balance colors (in chess). For this method to work, the score groups cannot be too small, and thus for smaller overall fields score groups are not a suitable approach.

This pairing system may have some issues with competitive integrity if a tournament where this system is used has qualifiers leading to it. For example, suppose a certain qualifier determines the 5th-8th seeds in an 8-team Swiss-style tournament. If the Dutch system is used, players or teams in the qualifier may be incentivized to not do their best, as doing so might make them play against the 1st seed on the first round, decreasing their chances of having a good score. Conversely, for knockout tournaments, the highest seed is usually paired with the lowest, the 2nd highest with the 2nd lowest, and so on. This incentivizes players or teams to do their best and get a higher seed so that they can play against lower-seeded players/teams.

===Monrad system===
The players are first ranked based on their scores, then on their starting numbers (which can be random or based on seeding). Then #1 meets #2, #3 meets #4, etc., with modifications made to ensure that other rules are adhered to. Players are sorted by scores (not score groups) and original ranks, then each player paired to the next opponent, typically excluding repeats.

The Monrad system used in chess in Denmark is quite simple, with players initially ranked at random, and pairings modified only to avoid players meeting each other twice. The Norwegian system has an optional seeding system for the first-round pairings, and within a score group, the pairing algorithm endeavors to give players alternating colors.

==Final scores and tie-breaking==
There is a fixed number of rounds. After the last round, players are ranked by their score. If players remain tied, a tie-break score is used, such as the sum of all opponents&#x27; scores (Buchholz chess rating).

==Analysis, advantages, and disadvantages==

Assuming no drawn games, determining a clear winner (and, incidentally, a clear loser) would require the same number of rounds as that of a knockout tournament, which is the binary logarithm of the number of players rounded up. Thus, three rounds can handle up to eight players, four rounds can handle up to sixteen players, ten rounds can handle up to one thousand and twenty-four players, and so on. If fewer than this minimum number of rounds are played, two or more players could finish the tournament with a perfect score, having won all their games but never having faced each other. Due to the fact that players should meet each other at most once and pairings are chosen dependent on the results, there is a natural upper bound on the number of rounds of a Swiss-system tournament, which is equal to half of the number of players rounded up. Should more than this number of rounds be played, the tournament might run into the situation that there is either no feasible round, or some players have to play each other a second time.

Compared to a knockout tournament, a Swiss system has the advantage of not eliminating anyone; a player who enters the tournament knows that they can play in all the rounds, regardless of results. The only exception is that one player is left over when there is an odd number of players. The player left over receives a bye: they do not play that round but are usually awarded the same number of points as for winning a game (ex: one point for a chess tournament). The player is reintroduced in the next round and will not receive another bye.

Another advantage compared to knockout tournaments is that the final ranking gives some indication of the relative strengths of all contestants, not just of the tournament winner. By contrast, in a knockout tournament the second-best contestant is not necessarily the losing finalist; they could be any of the contestants defeated by the eventual tournament winner in earlier rounds.

In a Swiss-system tournament, sometimes a player has such a great lead that by the last round they are assured of winning the tournament even if they lose the last game. This has some disadvantages. First, a Swiss-system tournament does not always end with the exciting climax of a knockout final. Second, while the outcome of the final game has no bearing on first place, the first-place player can decide who wins second or third prize. In the 1995 All-Stars Tournament in Scrabble, tournament directors paired David Gibson, who had by then clinched first place, with the highest-ranked player who could not win a prize so that the second- and third-ranked players could compete between themselves for the final placements. The &quot;Gibson Rule&quot; is optional at Scrabble tournaments, as players at smaller tournaments may still have an incentive to win their last game to improve their overall rating. Players may also be &quot;Gibsonized&quot; if they have clinched a spot in the next round, and they may be paired with the highest-ranked player who cannot possibly qualify for the next round.

The system is used for the selection of the English national pool team. Sixty-four players start the tournament and after six rounds, the top player will qualify as they will be unbeaten. The remaining seven places are decided after a series of round robins and playoffs.

Compared with a round-robin tournament, a Swiss tournament can handle many players without requiring an impractical number of rounds. An elimination tournament is better suited to a situation in which only a limited number of games may be simultaneously played in the tournament. For example, if a tennis tournament had sixty-four players, but only eight courts available, then not all matches in a round can be played at the same time. In a Swiss tournament, each round would have to be divided up into four waves of eight matches each. This would result in a total of twenty-four waves over the minimum six rounds. Conversely, for a single elimination tournament, the first round would require four waves, the next two, and all remaining rounds would consist of a single wave each. Over the same six rounds, only nine waves would occur. Note that the waves format is not strictly necessary, as instead a match could commence as soon as another in the same round ends, but the principle is largely the same.

In a Swiss tournament, all the results of a particular round need to be recorded before the next round may begin. This means that each round will take as long as its slowest match. In a single elimination tournament, any game may commence once the two preceding games that feed into it have been completed. This may result in one branch of the bracket falling behind if it has several slow matches in a row, but it may then catch up if it then has several quick matches. Additionally, each round has fewer matches than the previous, and the average longest match in a round will more closely match the average match as the number of matches in that round decreases.

== Variations ==
===Accelerated pairings===
The method of accelerated pairings also known as accelerated Swiss is used in some large tournaments with more than the optimal number of players for the number of rounds. This method pairs top players more quickly than the standard method in the opening rounds and has the effect of reducing the number of players with perfect scores more rapidly (by approximately a factor of 2 after two rounds).

For the first two rounds, players who started in the top half have one point added to their score for pairing purposes only. Then the first two rounds are paired normally, taking this &quot;added score&quot; into account. In effect, in the first round the top quarter plays the second quarter and the third quarter plays the fourth quarter. Most of the players in the first and third quarters should win the first round. Assuming this is approximately the case, in effect for the second round the top eighth plays the second eighth, the second quarter plays the third quarter and the seventh eighth plays the bottom eighth. That is, in the second round, winners in the top half play each other, losers in the bottom half play each other, and losers in the top half play winners in the bottom half (for the most part). After two rounds, about of the players will have a perfect score, instead of . After the second round, the standard pairing method is used (without the added point for the players who started in the top half).

As a comparison between the standard Swiss system and the accelerated pairings, consider a tournament with eight players, ranked #1 through #8. Assume that the higher-ranked player always wins.
Accelerated pairings do not &quot;guarantee&quot; that fewer players will have a perfect score. In round 2, if #5 and #6 score upset wins against #3 and #4, and there is a decisive result between #1 and #2, there will be three players with a perfect 2–0 score.

===Danish system===
The Danish system works in principle like a Monrad system, only without the restriction that no players can meet for a second time, so it is always #1 vs. #2, #3 vs. #4 etc.

Bridge team tournaments, if not played as &quot;Round Robin&quot;, usually start with the Swiss system to make sure that the same teams would not play against each other frequently, but in the last one or two rounds there may be a switch to the Danish system, especially to allow the first two ranked teams to battle against each other for the victory, even if they have met before during the tournament. This would be more common if relatively few teams are involved. In a large field it is usually easy to match high-scoring teams who have not previously met.

===Grand Prix system===
In a few tournaments which run over a long period of time, such as a tournament with one round every week for three months, the Grand Prix system can be used. A player&#x27;s final score is based on their best results (e.g. best ten results out of the twelve rounds). Players are not required to play in every round; they may enter or drop out of the tournament at any time. Indeed, they may decide to play only one game if they wish to, although once a player wants to get a prize they need to play more rounds to accumulate points. The tournament therefore includes players who want to go for a prize and play several rounds as well as players who only want to play an odd game.

===McMahon system===
A variant known as the McMahon system tournament is the established way in which European Go tournaments are run. Professional sumo tournaments in Japan also closely approximate this system. This differs mainly in that players have a skill ranking prior to the start of the tournament which determines their initial pairing in contrast to the basic Swiss-system approach where all players start at the same skill ranking. The McMahon system reduces the probability of a very strong team meeting a very weak team in the initial rounds. It is named for Lee E. McMahon (1931–1989) of Bell Labs.

===Amalfi system===
A tournament system in Italy. It is similar to the Swiss System, but does not split players based on their score. Before pairing any round, players are listed for decreasing score / decreasing rating, and the opponent of the first player in the list is the player following them by a number of positions equal to the number of remaining rounds, and so on for the other players. As consequence of this, the difference in rating between opponents at the first round is not so big (as for the accelerated systems), and ideally the &quot;big match&quot; between the first and the second one should occur at the last round, no matter how many players and rounds are in the tournament.

===Keizer system===
A bit like the Amalfi system, the Keizer system aims to offer a more interesting pairing system than the Swiss or round-robin system for tournaments that take place over a long period, for example an internal club championship with a game every week for several weeks. The advantages of the Keizer system are that all players do not have to be present for every round of the tournament: they can enter, leave and re-enter the tournament very easily. The Keizer system also maximizes the interest of the games by seeking to pairing opponents of similar playing strength. This system is quite used in chess clubs in Belgium, but especially in the Netherlands.

== Applications ==

===Chess===
In chess, each player is paired against another player with an equivalent performance score. In Round 1 of a chess tournament paired using the Swiss System, players usually are seeded according to their known playing strength, often a rating assigned to them by their local club, their national federation, or the world chess federation (FIDE). In some events, especially when none or few of the players have an official chess rating, the players are paired randomly. Once play begins, players who win receive a point, those who draw receive one-half of a point, and those who lose receive no points. Win, lose or draw, all players proceed to the next round where winners are paired against opponents with equal performance scores (e.g. Round 1&#x27;s winners play each other, Round 1&#x27;s draws play each other, etc.). In later rounds (typical tournaments have anywhere from 3-9 rounds), players face opponents with the same (or almost the same) score. No player is paired up against the same opponent twice.

The rules for Swiss System chess events also try to ensure that each player plays an equal number of games with white and black. Alternating colors in each round is the most preferable and the same color is never repeated three times in a row.

Players with the same score are ideally ranked according to rating. Then the top half is paired with the bottom half. For instance, if there are eight players in a score group, number 1 is paired to play number 5, number 2 is paired to play number 6 and so on. When the tournament, or a section of the tournament, has an odd number of players, one player usually is assigned a &quot;Bye&quot;—e.g. a round where the player is not paired.  Modifications are then made to balance colors and prevent players from meeting each other twice.

The first national event in the United States to use the Swiss system was in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1945; and the first Chess Olympiad using it was held in Haifa in 1976.

In chess, the terms Swiss and Monrad are both used and denote systems with different pairing algorithms. The Monrad pairing system is commonly used in Denmark and Norway, while most of the rest of the world uses one of the Swiss systems defined by FIDE. In most other sports, only one format is used and is known either as Monrad or Swiss.

===Esports===
A variation of Swiss system common in esports tournaments sees participants play until reaching the preset number of wins or losses, instead of having everyone play the same number of games. In this system, a player or team that wins the required number of games advances to the next stage of the tournament and doesn&#x27;t play any more games in this stage; conversely, those who lose enough games are eliminated from the tournament. This system was used for the first time in &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot; by ESL during qualifying rounds for the ESL One Cologne 2016 tournament. The Buchholz System was introduced in these Major Championships since PGL Major Stockholm 2021.
===Go===
Relatively few Go tournaments use the Swiss system. Most amateur Go tournaments, at least in Europe and America, now use the McMahon system instead. Swiss-system tournaments must start with very unequal matches in the early rounds—&quot;slaughter pairing&quot; is the name of one initial pattern used—if the Swiss pairing rules applied subsequently are to allow the top players to meet in the latest rounds. The McMahon system is designed to give all players games against similarly skilled players all along, and to produce final standings that more accurately reflect the true current skill levels of players.

<text>A hybrid word or hybridism is a word that etymologically derives from at least two languages. Such words are a type of macaronic language.

==Common hybrids==
The most common form of hybrid word in English combines Latin and Greek parts. Since many prefixes and suffixes in English are of Latin or Greek etymology, it is straightforward to add a prefix or suffix from one language to an English word that comes from a different language, thus creating a hybrid word.

Hybridisms were formerly often considered to be barbarisms.

== Other languages ==
=== Modern Hebrew ===
Modern Hebrew abounds with non-Semitic derivational affixes, which are applied to words of both Semitic and non-Semitic descent. The following hybrid words consist of a Hebrew-descent word and a non-Semitic descent suffix:

*bitkhon-íst () &#x27;one who evaluates everything from the perspective of national security&#x27;, from &quot;bitakhón&quot; &#x27;security&#x27; + the productive internationalism &quot;-ist&quot;
*khamúda-le () &#x27;cutie (feminine singular)&#x27;, from &quot;khamuda&quot; &#x27;cute (feminine singular) + &quot;-le&quot;, endearment diminutive of Yiddish origin
*kiso-lógya () &#x27;the art of finding a political seat (especially in the Israeli Parliament)&#x27;, from &quot;kisé&quot; &#x27;seat&#x27; + the productive internationalism &quot;-lógya&quot; &#x27;-logy&#x27;
*maarav-izátsya () &#x27;westernization&#x27;, from &quot;maaráv&quot; &#x27;west&#x27; + the productive internationalism &quot;-izátsya&quot; &#x27;-ization&#x27; (itself via Russian from a hybrid of Greek -ιζ- &quot;-iz-&quot; and Latin &quot;-atio&quot;)
*miluím-nik () &#x27;reservist, reserve soldier&#x27;, from &quot;miluím&quot; &#x27;reserve&#x27; (literally &#x27;fill-ins&#x27;) + &quot;-nik&quot;, a most productive agent suffix of Yiddish and Russian descent

The following Modern Hebrew hybrid words have an international prefix:
*anti-hitnatkút () &#x27;anti-disengagement&#x27;
*post-milkhamtí () &#x27;post-war&#x27;
*pro-araví () &#x27;pro-Arab&#x27;

Some hybrid words consist of both a non-Hebrew word and a non-Hebrew suffix of different origins:
*shababnik () &#x27;rebel youth of Haredi Judaism&#x27;, from Arabic &quot;shabab&quot; (youth) and &quot;-nik&quot; of Yiddish and Russian descent

Some hybrid words consist of a non-Hebrew word and a Hebrew suffix:
*Individuali-ut () &#x27;Individualism&#x27;, from English &quot;Individual&quot; and &quot;ut&quot;, a productive Hebrew suffix meaning &quot;-ism&quot;

Modern Hebrew also has a productive derogatory prefixal shm-, which results in an &#x27;echoic expressive&#x27;. For example, um shmum (), literally &#x27;United Nations shm-United Nations&#x27;, was a pejorative description by Israel&#x27;s first Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, of the United Nations, called in Modern Hebrew &quot;umot meukhadot&quot; () and abbreviated um (). Thus, when a Hebrew speaker would like to express his impatience with or disdain for philosophy, s/he can say &quot;filosófya-shmilosófya&quot; (). Modern Hebrew shm- is traceable back to Yiddish, and is found in English as well as shm-reduplication. This is comparable to the Turkic initial m-segment conveying a sense of &#x27;and so on&#x27; as in Turkish &quot;dergi mergi okumuyor&quot;, literally &#x27;magazine &quot;shmagazine&quot; read:NEGATIVE:PRESENT:3rd.person.singular&#x27;, i.e. &#x27;(He) doesn&#x27;t read magazine, journals or anything like that&#x27;.

===Filipino===
In Filipino, hybrid words are called siyokoy (literally &quot;merman&quot;). For example, &quot;concernado&quot; (&quot;concerned&quot;): &quot;concern-&quot; is from English and &quot;-ado&quot; is from Khoribari

=== Japanese ===
In Japanese, hybrid words are common in kango (words formed from kanji characters) in which some of the characters may be pronounced using Chinese pronunciations (&quot;on&#x27;yomi,&quot; from Chinese morphemes), and others in the same word are pronounced using Japanese pronunciations (&quot;kun&#x27;yomi,&quot; from Japanese morphemes). These words are known as &quot;jūbako&quot; (重箱) or &quot;yutō&quot; (湯桶), which are themselves examples of this kind of compound (they are autological words): the first character of &quot;jūbako&quot; is read using &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot;, the second &quot;kun&#x27;yomi&quot;, while it is the other way around with &quot;yutō&quot;. Other examples include 場所 &quot;basho&quot; &quot;place&quot; (&quot;kun-on&quot;), 金色 &quot;kin&#x27;iro&quot; &quot;golden&quot; (&quot;on-kun&quot;) and 合気道 &quot;aikidō&quot; &quot;the martial art Aikido&quot; (&quot;kun-on-on&quot;). Some hybrid words are neither &quot;jūbako&quot; nor &quot;yutō&quot; (縦中横 &quot;tatechūyoko&quot; (&quot;kun-on-kun&quot;)). Foreign words may also be hybridized with Chinese or Japanese readings in slang words such as 高層ビル &quot;kōsōbiru&quot; &quot;high-rise building&quot; (&quot;on-on-katakana&quot;) and 飯テロ &quot;meshitero&quot; &quot;food terrorism&quot; (&quot;kun-katakana&quot;).

<text>Private Edward Warner VC (18 November 1883 – 2 May 1915) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was a private in the 1st Battalion, The Bedfordshire Regiment, British Army during World War I, who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry during the defence of Hill 60 on 1 May 1915.

==Before World War I==
Born and raised in St Albans, Warner worked as a straw hat finisher before enlisting in the Bedfordshire Regiment in late 1903 as Private 7602. Service in India followed, the battalion returning to England in 1908 at the end of its tour of foreign service. His term in the regulars complete, Warner became a reservist and worked at the Deep Well Boring Works, for the St. Albans council and the Post Office Telephones Dept.

==War service==
When war was declared in August 1914, Private Warner was mobilised and rejoined the 1st Battalion who were based in Ireland. He arrived on the Western Front with the battalion on 16 August 1914 and fought in the Battle of Mons, the Battle of Le Cateau, during the rearguard actions of the British Army&#x27;s Retreat from Mons, at the First Battle of the Marne, the First Battle of the Aisne, the Battle of La Bassée and the First Battle of Ypres. Despite the high casualties his battalion sustained in these early battles, Warner came through with just a poisoned hand.

After the winter&#x27;s lull in fighting and Warner&#x27;s battalion&#x27;s involvement in the Christmas truce of 1914, the campaigning season restarted and he found himself in the line around Hill 60, south-east of Ypres. He &quot;&#x27;had been due to complete his service in May 1915 but with dependants, 75-year-old widowed mother Charlotte and new fiancée Maud Burton, waiting at home, was doubtless contemplating whether to extend his service or take the well-earned, honourable discharge that would be offered to him in the coming weeks. Having come through the dreadful battle on Hill 60 in April, he had written to his mother days earlier; &quot;You will see in the papers that we have been in a tight corner. I think it’s the hottest place I have ever been in but, thank the Lord, I have been spared to get through alright. We have lost a lot killed and wounded. It was a proper death trap. The dirty pigs could not have blown us to pieces fast enough so they tried to blind us but I am pleased to say I am safe.&quot;&quot;&#x27;

===Victoria Cross===
Following almost two weeks of fierce fighting for control of &#x27;Murder Hill&#x27;, Warner and his battalion were due for relief once darkness arrived on 1 May 1915, but at 6.30 p.m. that evening, a German gas attack was launched against the defenders of the hill. On the right, the 1st Battalion, Devonshire Regiment lost over 300 men in just moments, leaving the 1st Battalion, Bedfordshire Regiment on their left flank exposed.

Warner&#x27;s platoon held the right flank of the battalion line on the hill, every one of his colleagues being taken by the effects of gas as it rolled into their section. Regardless of the overwhelming numbers arrayed against him, the psychological effects of a new weapon such as gas, with no real defence against its effects and being under heavy shell fire, Warner remained in the trench, fending off all German attempts to gain entry. Once a lull in the fighting allowed, he moved back through the gas cloud, artillery bombardment and machine gun fire to gather reinforcements. Warner found some men from his battalion and guided them back into the danger area but soon after returning to the front trenches, he had to be carried back to the regimental aid post suffering from the effects of prolonged exposure to the gas.
&quot;&#x27;The night quietened down and on the morning of 2 May Fred Brimm found his mortally wounded friend, Ted Warner, &#x27;more dead than alive&#x27; at the nearby Regimental Aid Post. He wrote: &#x27;Ted was quite sensible to within half an hour of his death. He knew he was going and only wanted another chance to get at them again. His last words were &quot;They’ve gone and done for me, the cowards.&quot;&quot;’

As is often the case with the earlier war deaths from around Ypres, Warner&#x27;s grave was lost in the fighting that continued to rage in the salient for a further 42 months and he is remembered on the Ypres (Menin Gate) Memorial to the missing. An image survives of his original grave marker, taken from the &quot;Mudlark&quot;, magazine of the 1st Bedfordshire Regiment.

The London Gazette (29 June 1915) published the citation which accompanied the posthumous award of Edward Warner&#x27;s Victoria Cross, reading:

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross, along with his 1914 Star, Victory and British War Medals are displayed at the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regimental Museum, Wardown Park, Luton, Bedfordshire, England.

<doc id="1186938" wikidata="Q1934946" url="?curid=1186938" title="Single transverse palmar crease">
<text>In humans, a single transverse palmar crease is a single crease that extends across the palm of the hand, formed by the fusion of the two palmar creases. Although it is found more frequently in persons with several abnormal medical conditions, it is not predictive of any of these conditions since it is also found in persons with no abnormal medical conditions. It is found on at least one hand in 1.5% of the world&#x27;s population.

==Former name==
Because it resembles the usual condition of non-human simians, it was, in the past, called the simian crease or simian line. These terms have widely fallen out of favor due to their pejorative connotation.

==Medical significance==
The presence of a single transverse palmar crease has no medical significance. It is found in 1.5% of all people, and though it is found at a higher frequency in people with abnormal medical conditions, in every one of these conditions, many people do not have a single transverse palmar crease. Thus, it has a low predictive value.

Males are twice as likely as females to have this characteristic, which tends to run in families. In its non-symptomatic form, it is more common among Asians and Native Americans than among other populations, and in some families, there is a tendency to inherit the condition unilaterally; that is, on one hand, only.

While it is often found in people with Down Syndrome, many who have this syndrome do not have this crease, and thus is not a diagnostic indicator of Down Syndrome. 

The presence of a single transverse palmar has been associated with several abnormal medical conditions—that is, it is found at a higher than 1.5% frequency, but in all of these conditions, many do not have this crease. Examples of conditions with such an association are fetal alcohol syndrome and the genetic chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome (chromosome 21), cri du chat syndrome (chromosome 5), Klinefelter syndrome, Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, Noonan syndrome (chromosome 12), Patau syndrome (chromosome 13), IDIC 15/Dup15q (chromosome 15), Edward&#x27;s syndrome (chromosome 18), and Aarskog–Scott syndrome (X-linked recessive), or autosomal recessive disorder, such as leukocyte adhesion deficiency-2 (LAD2). A unilateral single palmar crease was also reported in a case of chromosome 9 mutation causing nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and Robinow syndrome. It is also sometimes found on the hands of the affected side of patients with Poland syndrome and craniosynostosis.

A 1971 study refutes the hypothesis that the phenomenon is caused by fetal hand movement: the appearance of the crease occurs around the second month of gestation before the digital movement phase in the womb begins.

<text>Sir Arnold Horace Santo Waters, (23 September 1886 – 22 January 1981) was a British engineer, soldier and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
He was 32 years old, and an acting major in the 218th Field Company, Corps of Royal Engineers, British Army during the First World War at the second battle of the Sambre when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

On 4 November 1918 near Ors, France, Major Waters, with his Field Company, was bridging the Oise-Sambre Canal under artillery and machine-gun fire at close range, the bridge being damaged and the building party suffering severe casualties. All Major Waters&#x27; officers had been killed or wounded and he at once went forward and personally supervised the completion of the bridge, working on cork floats while under such intense fire that it seemed impossible that he could survive. The success of the operation was entirely due to his valour and example.

==Further information==
Later he was knighted, becoming Sir Arnold Waters. He was the President of the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1933–34 and 1943–1944, the only person to hold the post twice.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Engineers Museum, Chatham, Kent.

<doc id="1186961" wikidata="Q57301" url="?curid=1186961" title="Hans-Gert Pöttering">
<text>Hans-Gert Pöttering (born 15 September 1945) is a German lawyer, historian and conservative politician (CDU, European People&#x27;s Party), who served as President of the European Parliament from January 2007 to July 2009 and as Chairman of the CDU-affiliated Konrad Adenauer Foundation from 2010 to 2017.

He served as a Member of the European Parliament continuously since the first elections in 1979 until 2014 and was Chairman of the European People&#x27;s Party-European Democrats 1999–2007. When he stepped down in 2014 he was the European Parliament&#x27;s longest-serving member. As president of the European Parliament he proposed the creation of the House of European History museum in Brussels.

==Early life and education==
Pöttering never got to know his father who was killed in action during the last days of the Second World War. After Abitur and military service, he studied law, political science and history at the University of Bonn, the University of Geneva, the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva and at Columbia University in New York. He took his first state exam in jurisprudence in 1973, earned a PhD in political science and history in 1974 with a dissertation on West German defense policy in the 1950s and 1960s and took his second state exam in jurisprudence in 1976, fully qualifying as an attorney.

==Political career==
===Member of the European Parliament, 1979–2014===
Pöttering was a member of the European Parliament from 1979 until 2014, by the end of this period he was the only member of the European Parliament to have served continuously since the first elections.

From 1984 to 1994, Pöttering was chairman of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence. From 1994 to 1996, he chaired the working group on the Intergovernmental Conference of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and EPP-ED Group, the results of which became the official EPP position for the Treaty of Amsterdam.

In 1994, Pöttering became Vice-President of the EPP, and from 1999 to 2007, he was the Chairman of the EPP-ED Group in the European Parliament. He was the top candidate of the CDU in the 2004 and the 2009 European elections.

Together with Volker Hassemer he is a member of the advisory board of the pro-European initiative &quot;A Soul for Europe&quot;. He was a member of the Reconciliation of European Histories Group.

===President of the European Parliament, 2007–2009=== 

As part of a deal with the socialist group, it was agreed that he would succeed Josep Borrell Fontelles as President of the European Parliament in the second part of the 2004–2009 term, which he did on 16 January 2007. He was elected with 450 of 689 valid votes, and defeated Italian Green Monica Frassoni, Danish Eurosceptic Jens-Peter Bonde and French Communist Francis Wurtz.

As President of the European Parliament he initiated the House of European History project. He made reference to the House in his inaugural speech in 2007.
For many years he is serving as the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the House of European History in Brussels.

===Later career===
On 4 December 2009 Pöttering was elected Chairman of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation from 1 January 2010; he was succeeded by Norbert Lammert in 2018.

When the EPP membership of Hungarian party Fidesz was suspended in 2019, EPP president Joseph Daul appointed Pöttering – alongside Herman van Rompuy and Wolfgang Schüssel – to a group of high-level experts who were mandated to monitor Fidesz&#x27;s compliance with EPP values.

==Political positions==
Pöttering is known as an enthusiastic European Federalist and an ally of Angela Merkel. He has stated that his priority will be to rejuvenate the European Constitution.

In February 2020, Pöttering joined around fifty former European prime ministers and foreign ministers in signing an open letter published by British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; to condemn U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s Middle East peace plan, saying it would create an apartheid-like situation in occupied Palestinian territory.

<text>General Sir John Watson, (6 September 1829 – 23 January 1919) was an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. An officer serving with the Bengal Army, Watson received his Victoria Cross for actions at Lucknow during the Indian Mutiny. He later rose to the rank of general in the British Indian Army.

==Early life==
Watson was born on 6 September 1829 in Chigwell, Essex. His father was William George Watson. In 1848, at the age of 19, Watson travelled to London seeking to join the army of the British East India Company. Joining the Bengal Army as an officer he was initially sent to Madras. This offered little prospect of action, however, and Watson sought transfer to Bombay.

His first combat action came in December 1848 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War when Watson took part in the Siege of Multan, while serving with the 1st Bombay European Fusiliers. Shortly afterwards he took part in the Battle of Gujrat. By the early 1850s, he was adjutant of the 1st Punjab Cavalry, when Lieutenant, later Field-Marshall, Frederick Roberts observed that Watson &quot;was looked upon as one of the most promising officers of the Frontier Force.&quot;

==Victoria Cross details==
Watson was 28 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Punjab Cavalry, Bengal Army during the Indian Mutiny when the following deed took place on 14 November 1857 at Lucknow, India, for which he was awarded the VC:
==Later military career==
Following this, Watson took part in further fighting around Cawnpore and then the Relief of Lucknow. After this he returned to England briefly on convalescence leave before returning to India. In 1858, he raised the 4th Sikh Irregular Cavalry which later became the 6th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Lancers (Watson&#x27;s Horse). He later took part in the Umbeyla Expedition (1863) and commanded the Central India Horse, 1871. He became Resident at Gwalior, 1877; Officiating Adjutant-General in Central India, 1871; commanded the Cavalry despatched from Bombay to Malta, 1878; and then commanded the Punjab chief&#x27;s contingent of the Kurram Valley Field Force in the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1879–80). In 1891 he was promoted to the rank of general.

Watson also served in a number of other roles, including Aide-de-Camp to Her Majesty Empress Victoria, 1870–71 and the Agent to the Governor-General at Baroda from 1882 until 1886, for which he was subsequently knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1886. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the order (GCB) in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902, and was invested by King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902.

He was also made Colonel of the Regiment of the 13th Duke of Connaught Lancers in 1904.

== Death ==
Watson died on 23 January 1919, aged 89, at Finchampstead in Berkshire. His grave lies in the churchyard of St James in the village. His VC is on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>General George Nicolas Channer (7 January 1842 – 13 December 1905) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Life==

George Channer was born at Allahabad, India, on 7 January 1842, the eldest surviving son of eight children of George Girdwood Channer, colonel, Bengal artillery (1811–1895) and Susan (d. 1895), daughter of Nicholas Kendall JP, vicar of Talland and Lanlivery, Cornwall. He was educated at Cheltenham College.

Joining the army in September 1859, he served in India with the 89th and 95th regiments, seeing active service in the Ambela campaign of 1863–4. In August 1866 he entered the Bengal Staff Corps, serving with the Indian Army for the remainder of his career.

He was 32 years old, and a captain in the Bengal Staff Corps, Indian Army, and 1st Gurkha Rifles during the Battle of Bukit Putus when, on 20 December 1875 in Negri Sembilan, Malaya, Captain Channer performed the deed for which he was awarded the VC. Channer had been despatched with a small party to obtain intelligence of the position and strength of the enemy&#x27;s stockade. Having located it, he jumped in, taking the enemy by surprise. After shooting one man dead with his revolver, the rest of Channer&#x27;s party entered the stockade, which they captured. The stockade was formidable and it would have been impossible to bring guns to bear on it because of the steepness of the hill and the density of the jungle. If Captain Channer and his party had not been able to take the stockade in this manner it would have been necessary to resort to the bayonet, with consequent great loss of life. In addition to the VC, in April 1876 Channer was mentioned in dispatches and promoted to brevet major.

Channer served with the Jowaki Expedition in 1877 and the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1978–80). Here he was with the 29th Punjabi infantry in the Kurram Valley Field Force, commanding the regiment at the Battle of Peiwar Kotal in December 1878. He was made a brevet lieutenant-colonel in November 1879 and a colonel in the army in November 1883, at the early age of forty-one. He commanded a brigade in the Hazara Expedition of 1888, after which he was made a companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He attained the rank of major-general in April 1893, lieutenant-general on 9 November 1896 and General in January 1899. He retired in November 1901.

He died at the age of 63 on 13 December 1905 at Westward Ho!, Devon. He was buried in East-the-Water Cemetery, Bideford, in a grave adjacent to that of Gerald Graham VC.

His Victoria Cross medal group is in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum.

==Family==
He married in June 1872, Annie Isabella, daughter of John William Watson. They had four surviving sons (two served in the army) and four daughters, one of which is Mary Eva Channer who married Ronald AA Kinloch. Mary Eva and Ronald had two Sons, Ian Kinloch and Bruce Kinloch who also joined the army and was commissioned into the 3rd Queen Alexandra&#x27;s own Gurkha Rifles, winning the Military Cross for his part in the battle of Sitang River Bridge in 1942. At the age of 25 he commanded the battalion.

== Live technical difficulties ==
During the live performance of Beyoncé and Sean Paul&#x27;s &quot;Baby Boy&quot; (near to Paul&#x27;s rap), the backing tracks of vocals (&quot;Baby boy you are so damn fine&quot;) started to malfunction, failing to repeat and losing the instrumental part of the song. Through the technical difficulties, Paul sang for a bit; Beyoncé asked the crowd how they were doing, which received applause and cheers.

The malfunction of the backing track vocals was cut from the live airing on TV but still played through the venue. Both artist and the dancers exited the stage, which then resulted in confusion among the presenters. When Christina Aguilera walked onto the stage to continue the event, the musical track stopped playing again. After Pink presented the award for Best Album, the duo was asked if they would like to do a re-take. Both agreed and performed the song as rehearsed. The re-take would replace the original take on re-airings of the show. This caused the EMAs to be extended, which had never happened before.

<text>Oliver Cyril Spencer Watson VC DSO (7 September 1876 – 28 March 1918) was an English posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

== Biography ==
Educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1897 Watson was commissioned into the Green Howards and posted to the regiment&#x27;s 2nd battalion, then serving in India. He took part in the Tirah Expedition of 1897–1898 on the North West Frontier, in which he was severely wounded, and saw action again in the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. He was promoted lieutenant in 1898 and after being invalided from India in 1903 he retired to the reserve of regular officers in 1904.

In 1909 he joined the County of London Yeomanry (Middlesex, Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Hussars). He was promoted Lieutenant in 1911, captain in 1913. He served in Gallipoli in April 1915 and was promoted to major in July 1915, before returning to the UK. Attached to the 2/5th King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry from his Yeomanry unit in 1916, he went to France as the second-in-command in 1917. He was Mentioned in Despatches and awarded the DSO in May 1917, having been wounded at Bullecourt on 3 May 1917.

===Victoria Cross===
Watson was 41 years old, and an Acting Lieutenant-Colonel commanding the 5th Battalion, King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (now part of The Rifles) during the First World War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 28 March 1918 at Rossignol Wood, north of Hebuterne, France, a counter-attack had been made against the enemy position which at first achieved its object, but as they were holding out in two improvised strong-points, Lieutenant Colonel Watson saw that immediate action was necessary and he led his remaining small reserve to the attack, organising bombing parties and leading attacks under intense fire. Outnumbered, he finally ordered his men to retire, remaining himself in a communication trench to cover the retirement. The assault he led was at a critical moment and without doubt saved the line, but he was killed covering the withdrawal.

Lieutenant Colonel Watson has no known grave. He is remembered at the CWGC Cemetery at Arras, France and listed under the Middlesex Hussars (Yeomanry); his parent unit.

In 1956, Watson&#x27;s medals were loaned to the Green Howards Regimental Museum, then in 1992 were donated as a gift to the Regiment by the husband of Watson&#x27;s niece, Mrs Catherine Whittuck. A copy of his Victoria Cross is displayed at the Green Howards Regimental Museum, Richmond, North Yorkshire.

== Volunteers ==
Conservation Volunteers attracts over 10,000 local volunteers per year in Australia and New Zealand, plus over 2,000 international volunteers every year.

=== Youth programs ===

* Green Army
In 2014, the Australian Government engaged Conservation Volunteers Australia as one of five Service Providers to deliver services as part of the Green Army Programme. CVA was appointed for a period of three years, 2014–2017, to deliver the Green Army Programme. The Green Army is a hands-on, practical, grassroots environmental action programme that supports local environment and heritage conservation projects across Australia. The programme provides opportunities for young Australians aged 17–24 years to gain training and experience in environmental and heritage conservation fields and explore careers in conservation management, while participating in projects that generate real benefits for the environment.

Green Army teams of 10 (up to nine participants and one team supervisor) will be deployed to projects lasting 20–26 weeks across Australia to help communities deliver local conservation outcomes. Projects are guided by local community needs and contribute to Australia&#x27;s national and international environmental priorities and obligations.

* National Green Jobs Corps
The National Green Jobs Corps (NGJC) was an Australian Government work experience and training program that offers a combination of environmental work experience, skill development and accredited training for youth aged 17 to 24 years. The program will equip an estimated 10,000 young Australians with the skills to fill employment opportunities in emerging green and climate change-related industries. CVA is managing National Green Jobs Corps programs in Queensland, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania.

* Green Corps
Conservation Volunteers Australia (known then as the Australian Trust for Conservation Volunteers) was the lead proponent with the Australian Government in establishing and delivering the Green Corps program. Green Corps was designed to provide young Australians between 17–20 years with the opportunity to demonstrate their commitment to the environment by contributing to high priority conservation projects while being provided with quality training and work experience throughout a 6-month program. Between 1997 and 2003, CVA was contracted to deliver 5,240 places across Australia.

* South Australian Youth Conservation Corps (SAYCC)
The South Australian Youth Conservation Corps (YCC) was an initiative of the South Australian Government and was delivered by Conservation Volunteers Australia (CVA) from 2003. Designed for young people (aged 16 to 24-year) YCC offered career opportunities through accredited training and work experience.

In addition to providing financial support for projects, many of CVA&#x27;s corporate partners have developed staff volunteer programs with the organisation.

=== Volunteer interpreter program ===
Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, part of Parks Conservation and Lands (PCL) within the Department of Territory and Municipal Services (ACT Government), and Conservation Volunteers have formed a partnership to deliver visitor management and interpretation services using volunteers. The five-year partnership was established in 2007 and Conservation Volunteers now employ full-time staff based at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve to manage the volunteer interpreter program and the visitor centre on behalf of PCL. Volunteers complete a formal training program facilitated by environmental and interpretation experts, plus ongoing professional development. The ACT National Parks Association was critical of the handover to a volunteer organisation, accusing the state government or neglecting its responsibilities.

== Corporate partnerships ==
Conservation Volunteers has many partnerships with Australian businesses. CVA has been able to develop a broad range of partnerships with corporate Australia for conservation projects which could not take place without corporate support. Each partnership is tailored to ensure it meets the needs of CVA, the company and the environment, and includes elements such as program funding, payroll giving, corporate volunteering, and staff fundraising for conservation.

== Land management ==
===The W. James Whyte Island Reserve – &quot;The Island&quot;===
In 2006, Conservation Volunteers Australia received a significant donation of a block of degraded land which CVA is transforming into a conservation reserve through volunteer efforts. The W.James Whyte Island Reserve is located just outside Bacchus Marsh in Victoria. To date, more than a quarter of a million trees have been planted at the reserve. Extensive weed control has also taken place.

===Little Desert Nature Lodge===
In 2011, Conservation Volunteers Australia became the new owner and manager of Little Desert Nature Lodge (www.littledesertlodge.com.au), near Nhill in Victoria.

===Salvana Conservation Reserve===
In 2013, Conservation Volunteers Australia was able to secure the long-term future of Lemon Springs and Middlegate blocks in the Little Desert Region of Western Victoria. These properties are adjacent to the Little Desert National Park and close to the Little Desert Nature Lodge, owned by CVA. The purchase of the property was made possible via a bequest from The State Trustees who managed the Estate of the late Victor Salvana. In recognition of this generous donation the property will be known as the Salvana Conservation Reserve.

===Brookfield Conservation Park===
Brookfield Conservation Park is a National Parks &amp; Wildlife park managed by Conservation Volunteers Australia in partnership with the Department for Environment &amp; Water. It is situated in the Riverland region of South Australia, in typical Mallee country. It is home to both flora and fauna threatened species. CVA undertakes a range of volunteer activities both in the park and in the surrounding area, with a focus on research of threatened species, including the southern hairy-nosed wombat and their habitat. Baseline data collection is one of the main priorities.

<text>Colonel James Forbes-Robertson (7 July 1884 – 5 August 1955) was a British Army officer and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Forbes-Robertson was born in 1884, at Slead Hall, a Grade II listed Building, in Brighouse, West Yorkshire and was educated at Cheltenham College. During the First World War, he served as the Deputy Commanding Officer of the 1st Battalion, Royal Newfoundland Regiment and as the unit&#x27;s Acting Commanding Officer during the Battle of Monchy-le-Preux in April 1917. When he was 33 years old, and an acting lieutenant colonel in the 1st Battalion, The Border Regiment, during the First World War at the Battle of Estaires, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions on 11/12 April 1918 near Vieux-Berquin, France:
Four times Lieutenant Colonel Forbes-Robertson saved the line from breaking and averted a most serious situation. On one occasion, having made a reconnaissance on horseback in full view of the enemy under heavy fire, he led a counter-attack which was completely successful in establishing our line. When his horse was shot under him he continued on foot, steadying the men and inspiring confidence by his disregard for personal danger. On the second day he lost another horse and again continued on foot until he had established a line to which his own troops could withdraw.

On 19 May 1918, he assumed command of the 155th (South Scottish) Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Division vice Brig.-Gen. P. S. Allan, D.S.O. Promoted to the rank of brevet major on 31 May, he commanded the 155th Brigade through the breaking of the &#x27;Siegfried&#x27; section of the Hindenburg Line on 26 August and the storming of the Drocourt-Quéant Switch in the first three days of September 1918, handing the Brigade over to Brig.-Gen. G. H. Harrison on 25 September.

He retained the temporary rank of brigadier general whilst he served as a staff officer, later reverting to his substantive rank. He later achieved the rank of colonel and transferred to the Gordon Highlanders where he ended his career.

Forbes-Robertson died in 1955 and was buried at the Bouncer&#x27;s Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham.

<doc id="1186980" wikidata="Q7551376" url="?curid=1186980" title="Social software (research field)">
<text>In philosophy and the social sciences, social software is an interdisciplinary research program that borrows
mathematical tools and techniques from game theory and computer science in order to analyze and design social procedures. The goals of research in this field are modeling social situations, developing theories of correctness, and designing social procedures.

Work under the term social software has been going on since about 1996, and conferences in Copenhagen, London, Utrecht and New York, have been partly or wholly devoted to it. Much of the work is carried out at the City University of New York under the leadership of Rohit Jivanlal Parikh, who was influential in the development of the field.

== Goals and tools ==
Current research in the area of social software include the analysis of social procedures and examination of them for fairness, appropriateness, correctness and efficiency. For example, an election procedure could be a simple majority vote, Borda count, a Single Transferable vote (STV), or Approval voting. All of these procedures can be examined for various properties like monotonicity. Monotonicity has the property that voting for a candidate should not harm that candidate. This may seem obvious, true
under any system, but it is something which can happen in STV. Another question would be the ability to elect a Condorcet winner in case there is one.

Other principles which are considered by researchers in social software include the concept that a procedure for fair division should be Pareto optimal, equitable and envy free. A procedure for auctions should be one which would encourage bidders to bid their actual valuation – a property which holds with the Vickrey auction.

What is new in social software compared to older fields is the use of tools from computer science like program logic, analysis of algorithms and epistemic logic. Like programs, social procedures dovetail into each other. For instance an airport provides runways for planes to land, but it also provides security checks, and it must provide for ways in which buses and taxis can take arriving passengers to their local destinations. The entire mechanism can be analyzed in the way in which a complex computer program can be analyzed. The Banach-Knaster procedure for dividing a cake fairly, or the Brams and Taylor procedure for fair division have been analyzed in this way. To point to the need for epistemic logic, a building not only needs restrooms, for obvious reasons, it also needs signs indicating where they are. Thus epistemic considerations enter in addition to structural ones. For a more urgent example, in addition to medicines, physicians also need tests to indicate what a patient&#x27;s problem is.

<text>Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Colclough Watson VC (11 April 1867 – 15 June 1917) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Watson was educated at the King Edward VI Grammar School in Louth, Lincolnshire, before attending the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in February 1888 and promoted to lieutenant in 1891.

== VC action ==
Watson was a 30 years old lieutenant in the Royal Engineers, British Army, attached to the Bengal Engineers, British Indian Army during the First Mohmand Campaign in North-West India, when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:
:On 16 September 1897, at the village of Bilot, in the Mamund Valley, he collected a few men of the Buffs (East Kent Regiment) and of No. 4 Company, Bengal Sappers and Miners, and led them into the dark and burning village to dislodge some of the enemy who were inflicting loss on our troops. After being wounded and driven back, he made a second attempt to clear the village, and only desisted after a second repulse and being again hit and severely wounded.

For their parts in the action, Lieutenant James Morris Colquhoun Colvin and Corporal James Smith also received the VC.

An account mentioning Watson is given in Winston Churchill&#x27;s &quot;The Story of the Malakand Field Force&quot;.

== Later career == 
Gaining promotion to captain in 1899 and major in 1906, Watson spent a number of years in the Military Works Service in India.

Promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in January 1915, he became a Divisional Engineer Commander in April that year. He died in London on 15 June 1917, aged 50, of illness contracted while serving in Mesopotamia during World War I, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. His wife Edith was awarded the Royal Red Cross.

His medals sold at auction in December 2014 for £312,000. They was purchased by Lord Ashcroft, a collector of Victoria Crosses, and are displayed at the Imperial War Museum.

<text>Colonel John Duncan Grant (28 December 1877 – 20 February 1967) was a British Indian Army officer who was awarded, on 24 January 1905, the only Victoria Cross for action in the Tibet Campaign, for action at the highest altitude in the Victoria Cross&#x27;s 165-year history: that of the Tibetan Plateau which has an average height of around 15,000 feet.

==Victoria Cross==
He was born into a distinguished family of military officers. He was the son of Colonel Suene Grant (1851 -1919), of the Royal Engineers, who directed the Recruiting Department at Minehead in Somerset during WW1, by Caroline Elizabeth Craigie Napper, who was the daughter of a Colonel of the Bengal Staff Corps. He was the grandson of Colonel John Marshall Grant of the Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment; and the great-grandson of General Duncan Grant of the Royal Artillery.

He was born at Roorkee, northern India, and educated in England at Cheltenham College, Grant attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and after passing out was appointed as a Second Lieutenant to the &quot;Unattached List ... with a view to [his] appointment to the Indian Staff Corps.&quot; He was promoted to Lieutenant in 1900. He joined the 8th Gurkha Rifles which was part of the British expedition to Tibet in 1903–04. On 6 July 1904 his actions at the storming of the Gyantse Dzong (fortress) led to the award of the Victoria Cross:


==Later service==
Grant was promoted to captain in 1907 and to major in 1916. During World War I he served in the Persian Gulf in 1915–16, France and Belgium in 1917 and Mesopotamia in 1918. After the war he served in Afghanistan in 1919, and then as lieutenant colonel in command of the 13th Rajputs in the Waziristan campaign (1919–1920). He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order &quot;for distinguished service rendered in the Field with the Waziristan Force, 1920–1921.&quot; He was Assistant Adjutant General at the headquarters of the Army of India 1925–28, and deputy director of the Auxiliary and Territorial Force in India 1928–29. He retired in 1929 with the rank of colonel and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of that year. He was ceremonial Colonel of the 10th Gurkha Rifles 1934–47.

==Personal life==
Grant married Kathleen Freyer (born 1883), the daughter of Sir Peter Freyer, an Irish doctor who served in the Indian Medical Service. They had two children.

He died in Tunbridge Wells, aged 89, and was cremated and buried at the Kent and Sussex Crematorium and Cemetery.

<text>Jacques Brel et ses chansons , later released as Grand Jacques, is the début album by Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel.

==History==
The original album was released in March 1954 as a nine-song 10-inch LP by Philips Records (N 76.027 R). The original nine tracks were recorded on 15 February 1954 at Théâtre de l&#x27;Apollo in Paris. A later reissue of the album under the title &quot;Jacques Brel 1&quot; was released by Barclay and included additional tracks from 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1961. The album was reissued on 23 September 2003 under the title &quot;Grand Jacques&quot; as part of the 16-CD box set &quot;Boîte à bonbons&quot; by Barclay (980 816-3).

==Critical reception==
In her review for AllMusic, Amy Hanson called the album a &quot;marvelous disc&quot; and a &quot;masterful collection of songs recorded ... at the beginning of Brel&#x27;s storied career, and a glimpse into a style of chanson that he seldom returned to once he&#x27;d swept France, Europe, and then the States with his best-known classics just a couple years later&quot;. Hanson continued:

<text>Joseph Watt, VC (25 June 1887 – 13 February 1955) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He achieved the award during service in the Strait of Otranto and as a result of his meritorious service also received the French Croix de Guerre and the Italian Silver Medal for Military Valour.

==Early life==
Joseph Watt was born in 1887 in the Scottish fishing village of Gardenstown on the Moray Firth, into the large family of Joseph Sr. and Helen Watt. His father was a fisherman of many years service and his mother was also employed in the fish industry. At age ten his father was lost at sea in an accident, and the family moved to Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire where his mother remarried. He learned the fishing trade from an early age and served aboard the &quot;White Daisy&quot; before purchasing a stake in the drifter &quot;Annie&quot;.

The war changed life in the community as most of the menfolk volunteered for service with the Royal Navy on the patrol service, hunting for enemy shipping and submarines, often in small drifters and trawlers similar to the ones they sailed in every day. Joe was no exception, being rated a skipper in the patrol service, and marrying Jesse Ann Noble in the days before his posting overseas. Transferred to Italy in 1915, Watt served on drifters in the Adriatic Sea, enduring boring patrol work keeping Austrian submarines from breaking into the Mediterranean Sea. During this time he was highly commended, for his role in the operation to evacuate the remnants of the Serbian Army following their defeat and retreat to Albania in January 1916 for which he was later awarded the Serbian Gold Medal for Good Service.

Shortly before Christmas 1916, Watt&#x27;s drifter, HM Drifter &quot;Gowanlea&quot; was attacked by an Austrian destroyer sortie, which was attempting to break the line of drifters and allow submarines to escape into the Mediterranean. Although hit several times by shellfire, the drifter was not seriously damaged and the crew unhurt. It was however a mild precursor to a major raid planned against the Otranto Barrage as the drifter line was now called.

==Victoria Cross action==
On 15 May 1917 Skipper Watt and his crew of eight men and a dog were patrolling peacefully in the Otranto Strait on the lookout for any suspicious activity following an increase in submarine sightings. Unbeknownst to the allied line, the Austrians had planned a major operation against the barrage, utilising the Rapidkreuzers , and SMS &quot;Novara&quot; under Admiral Miklós Horthy with two destroyers and three submarines. These ships fell upon the drifter line during the night and sank 14 trawlers and drifters which were helpless to reply, as well as two destroyers.
&quot;Gowanlea&quot; was confronted by the &quot;Helgoland&quot;, which demanded the surrender of the tiny ship and ordered the crew to abandon ship prior to sinking. Instead, Watt ordered his crew to open fire on their large opponent with the drifter&#x27;s tiny 6-pounder guns. &quot;Gowanlea&quot; was quickly hit by four heavy shells, seriously damaging the boat and wounding several crewmen. The other drifters around &quot;Gowanlea&quot; followed her example but were also subject to heavy fire, three sinking and the last lurching away seriously damaged. The Austrian cruisers headed for home but were engaged on their return by British, Italian and French units and became involved in the inconclusive battle of the Otranto Barrage.

For Watt and the survivors on their battered boats and in the water the fight now was with the sea, as &quot;Gowanlea&quot;, despite her own heavy damage and casualties moved amongst the wreckage, rescuing wounded men and providing medical attention to those in most need. In particular Watt saved the wounded crew of the sinking drifter &quot;Floandi&quot; who otherwise may have drowned.

==The award==
There was some dispute at the time as to whether the award of the Victoria Cross was appropriate given the defeat suffered by the barrage despite the resistance against overwhelming odds In the event, Watt was the only recipient of the men put forward from the drifter crews although several other men were given the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal, including three from &quot;Gowanlea&quot;&#x27;s crew.

Watt was characteristically uncomfortable with his award, commenting on a request for an interview postwar with the words &quot;There has been too much said already and it should get a rest ... I&#x27;m ashamed to read the exaggerations which have been printed&quot;. He was moved from drifters shortly after the action, becoming sick and spending the remainder of the year in hospital in Malta before being brought home to receive his award at Buckingham Palace and serve on light duties as a Chief Skipper.

HONOURS FOR SERVICE IN THE ACTION IN THE STRAITS OF OTRANTO ON THE 15TH OF MAY, 1917

The King has been graciously pleased to approve of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermentioned officer:-&lt;br&gt;
Skipper Joseph Watt, R.N.R., 1206 W.S.A. For most conspicuous gallantry when the Allied Drifter Line in the straits of Otranto was attacked by Austrian light cruisers on the morning of 15 May 1917.

When hailed by an Austrian cruiser at about 100 yards range and ordered to stop and abandon his drifter &quot;Gowan Lea&quot;, Skipper Watt ordered full speed ahead and called upon his crew to give three cheers and fight to the finish. The cruiser was then engaged, but after one round had been fired, a shot from the enemy disabled the breech of the drifter&#x27;s gun. The gun&#x27;s crew, however, stuck to the gun, endeavouring to make it work, being under heavy fire all the time. After the cruiser had passed on Skipper Watt took the &quot;Gowan Lea&quot; alongside the badly damaged drifter &quot;Floandi&quot; and assisted to remove the dead and wounded.
Third Supplement to the London Gazette of Tuesday, 28 August 1917
==Post-War Life==
Joe Watt returned to Fraserburgh after the war and refused point blank to ever speak of his war experience again, even to his wife. His boat &quot;Annie&quot; had been lost in the war to a sea mine, and so he bought &quot;Benachie&quot; as a replacement, on board which he once forgot to remove his cap on meeting the Duke of Kent, an omission which mortified him for years afterwards. He served on several other fishing vessels over the next twenty years before joining the Navy again as a drifter captain to serve in the Second World War, which he spent on uneventful duties in home waters accompanied by his son who had been wounded in the Battle of France serving with the Gordon Highlanders and invalided out of the army. He was on occasion heard to complain that he had been refused foreign service due to his age, which he seemed to feel should be an advantage rather than a hindrance.

Joe Watt died of cancer at home in 1955 and was buried alongside his wife and in-laws at Kirktown Cemetery in Fraserburgh. His passing was remarked on by a local politician who visited him and said of the experience that &quot;He had wonderful faith and courage&quot;.

==The medal==
Watt, who always shunned the fame generated by his award, kept the medal in a drawer full of junk on board his boat. Many of the locals who requested to see the medal were surprised to see it being kept in such a place. His VC medal was placed in auction in April 2012 but can now be seen at the Imperial War Museum, London.

<text>Léon (Lev) Samoylovich Bakst (), born Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich Rosenberg (; – 27 December 1924), was a Russian painter and scene and costume designer of Jewish origin. He was a member of the Sergei Diaghilev circle and the Ballets Russes, for which he designed exotic, richly coloured sets and costumes. He designed the décor for such productions as &quot;Carnaval&quot; (1910), &quot;Spectre de la rose&quot; (1911), &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; (1912), &quot;The Sleeping Princess&quot; (1921) and others.

== Early life ==
Leyb-Khaim Izrailevich (later Samoylovich) Rosenberg was born in Grodno, into a middle-class Jewish family. As his grandfather was an exceptional tailor, the Tsar gave him a very good position, and he had a huge and wonderful house in Saint Petersburg. Later, when Leyb&#x27;s parents moved to the capital, the boy Leyb would visit his grandfather&#x27;s house every Saturday. He said that he had been very impressed as a youth by that house, always returning with pleasure. At the young age of twelve, Lejb won a drawing contest and decided to become a painter. However, the parents disapproved of it and even threw away his paints.

In several years the parents divorced and started new families, it became impossible to live with a step-mother, so the four siblings separated and rented their own place. As the eldest, Lejb was in charge of two sisters and brother, he &#x27;took all kinds of painting work&#x27;. After graduating from gymnasium, he studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts as a noncredit student, because he had failed the entry. He also worked part-time as a book illustrator, gaining admission into the Imperial Academy in 1883.

At the time of his first exhibition (1889) he took the surname of &quot;Bakst&quot;, though the origin of the pseudonym is still unclear. There are at least three versions, according to the main one, his mother&#x27;s grandmother had the maiden name &quot;Bakster&quot;. Alexander Benois, a life-long friend of Leon, recalled that &#x27;Leo gave a prolonged and confusing explanation that the surname was taken after some of distant relatives&#x27;.

At the beginning of the 1890s, Bakst exhibited his works with the Society of Watercolourists. From 1893 to 1897 he lived in Paris, where he studied at the Académie Julian. He still often visited Saint Petersburg. After the mid-1890s, Bakst became a member of the circle of writers and artists formed by Sergei Diaghilev and Benois, who in 1899 founded the influential periodical &quot;Mir iskusstva&quot;, meaning &quot;World of Art&quot;. His graphics for this publication brought him fame.

== Career ==
Bakst continued painting, producing portraits of Filipp Malyavin (1899), Vasily Rozanov (1901), Andrei Bely (1905), Zinaida Gippius (1906). He also worked as an art teacher for the children of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia. In 1902, he took a commission from Tsar Nicholas II to paint Admiral Avellan and Russian sailors arriving in Paris, a painting he started there, during the celebrations from the 17 to 25 October 1893. However, it took him 8 years to finish this work.

In 1898, he showed his works in the Diaghilev-organized &quot;First Exhibition of Russian and Finnish Artists&quot;; in &quot;World of Art&quot; exhibitions, as well as the Munich &quot;Secession&quot;, exhibitions of the &quot;Union of Russian Artists&quot;, etc. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Bakst worked for the magazines &quot;Zhupel&quot;, &quot;Adskaya Pochta&quot;, , and &quot;&quot;, then for an art magazine called &quot;Apollon&quot;.

Beginning in 1909, Bakst worked mostly as a stage-designer, designing sets for Greek tragedies. In 1908, he gained attention as a scene-painter for Diaghilev with the Ballets Russes. He produced scenery for &quot;Cléopâtre&quot; (1909), &quot;Scheherazade&quot; (1910), &quot;Carnaval&quot; (1910), &quot;Narcisse&quot; (1911), &quot;Le Spectre de la Rose&quot; (1911), &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (1912) and &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; (1912). During this time, Bakst lived in western Europe because, as a Jew, he did not have the right to live permanently outside the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire [needs references as inconsistent with his full ability to live and work in St Petersburg and other areas of the Empire. (Masters and specialists with skills were usually exempted from such limitations)].

Despite being known for his work as a stage designer, art was also commissioned by various English families during the Art Deco era. During this time, he produced such works as the Sleeping Beauty series for James and Dorothy de Rothschild at Waddesdon Manor in 1913. The story is depicted in seven panels that line the walls of an oval, theatrical styled &quot;Bakst room&quot; in the Buckinghamshire manor house.

During his visits to Saint Petersburg, he taught in &quot;Zvantseva&#x27;s school&quot;, where one of his students was Marc Chagall (1908–1910). Bakst described Chagall as a favorite, because when told to do something, he would listen carefully, but then he would take his paint and his brushes and do something completely different from the assignment.In 1914, Bakst was elected a member of the Imperial Academy of Arts. Bakst&#x27;s comprehensive, many-sided talent showed itself in various areas — he worked as a designer of clothes, set decorations, interiors, textile, etc. Apart from a series of interior designs for the Rothschilds, he also designed exhibitions for ‘Mir Iskusstva’ society and occupied a post of a furniture and interior designer at ‘Sovremennoe Iskusstvo’ (rus. ‘Modern Art’). American silk industry businessman Arthur Selig invited Bakst to create textile design, their collaboration had great success.
During this period his work was widely shown in the United States. Martin Birnbaum, manager of the Berlin Photographic Company in New York City, organized an exhibition of Bakst&#x27;s work in 1913 in New York that then traveled to Detroit (1913), Buffalo (1914), Cincinnati (1914), Chicago (1914) and Montreal (1914).
After the Revolution of 1917 Leon&#x27;s sister died from hunger in Russia. When Bakst received the news, he suffered a nervous breakdown, becoming so ill that he couldn&#x27;t tolerate any irritants such as light, noise, or touch. His servant, Linda, exploited his condition to steal his money — she took all the honoraria that came to the house and intimidated the artist, forcing him to include her and her husband as heirs to his will. By chance he managed to send a note to an influential friend and patron Alice Warder Garrett (1877–1952), an art philanthropist, who helped his sister Sofia rescue Léon. They first met in Paris in 1914, when Mrs. Garrett was accompanying her diplomat husband in Europe, Bakst soon depended upon Garrett as both a confidante and agent.
In 1922, Bakst broke off his relationship with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes. During this year, he visited Baltimore and, specifically Evergreen House — the residence of his American friend Alice Garrett. Garrett became Bakst&#x27;s representative in the United States upon her return home in 1920, organizing two exhibitions of the artist&#x27;s work at New York&#x27;s Knoedler Gallery, as well as subsequent traveling shows. When in Baltimore, Bakst re-designed the dining room of Evergreen into a shocking acidic yellow and &#x27;Chinese&#x27; red confection. The artist transformed the house&#x27;s small c. 1885 gymnasium into a colourfully Modernist private theatre. This is believed to be the only extant private theatre designed by Bakst.

Léon Bakst was also a prolific writer, his literary legacy in three languages includes novels, numerous publications in magazines, critics, essays, letters to friends and colleagues.

Bakst died on 27 December 1924, in a clinic in Rueil Malmaison, near Paris, from lung problems (oedema). His many admirers amongst the most famous artists of the time, poets, musicians, dancers and critiques, formed a funeral procession to accompany his body to his final resting place, in the Cimetière des Batignolles, in Paris 17th Arrondissement, during a very moving ceremony.

In late 2010, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London presented an exhibit of Bakst&#x27;s costumes and prints.

<text>Henry Weale VC (2 October 1897 – 13 January 1959) was a Welsh recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

He was a 20 years old Lance-Corporal in the 14th Battalion, Royal Welsh Fusiliers, British Army when on the 26 August 1918 during the First World War, the following deed took place at Bazentin-le-Grand in France, for which he was awarded the VC.

He later achieved the rank of sergeant.

Weale died aged 61 on 13 January 1959 and is buried at Rhyl, Denbighshire. In 2010 a memorial garden was opened in his memory in his birth town of Shotton, while the Army Reserve centre in Queensferry, Flintshire, is now named the Henry Weale VC Hall.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum, Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales.

<text>Peter Ronald Hall (born 27 May 1952) is an Australian retired politician. He was a National member of the Victorian Legislative Council from 1988 to 2014, representing Gippsland Province (1988–2006) and the Eastern Victoria Region (2006–2014).

==Early life and education==
Hall was born and raised in Castlemaine, Victoria. He graduated from Castlemaine High School in 1969 and moved to Melbourne to attend university. He graduated from Monash University in 1972 with a Bachelor of Arts and completed a Diploma of Education the following year.

==Football career==
He showed promise as an Australian rules football player as a young person, being the best and fairest for the Castlemaine Football Club in 1969, at only 17 years of age. While studying teaching at Monash University in Melbourne, Hall made his debut for the Carlton Football Club in what was then the Victorian Football League (now named the Australian Football League). He went on to play 37 senior games between 1971 and 1974. However, he retired from top-grade football at the end of the 1974 season, moving to Traralgon in 1975 to take up a full-time secondary teaching position.

Over the next fourteen years, Hall continued to teach in Traralgon while also being the playing coach of his local football club. He twice won the league&#x27;s best and fairest award, and coached both Traralgon and Morwell to premierships. Both of these careers were to end, however, when Hall was elected to the safe National seat of Gippsland Province at the 1988 state election.

==Political career==
Hall was given little responsibility in his first term in office, but after being re-elected in 1996, he was made Deputy President of the Legislative Council and Chairman of the Ministerial Rural Health Advisory Group. When the Liberal–National coalition lost government in 1999, Hall became the Deputy Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council and Shadow Minister for Sport and Recreation, Youth and Affairs.

However, this was to again change in 2000, when the now-opposition coalition fractured. This meant that the Victorian division of the National Party was now the only one anywhere in the country to be separate from the Liberal Party. Hall subsequently lost his three shadow ministries, but instead became the party&#x27;s spokesperson for education, tertiary education, secondary education, primary education, preschools, adult learning, e learning resources and the environment. The following year, he was again promoted, and was made Leader of the National Party in the Legislative Council.

The 2002 election saw a major landslide victory for the Labor government at the expense of both the Liberal and National Parties. There was a swing to Labor in almost every seat in the state, with numerous MPs losing their seats. Hall, however, was the only exception in the Legislative Council, slightly improving his vote despite the party&#x27;s poor statewide result. After the election, he maintained his position as leader in the Legislative Council, despite the sacking of his Liberal counterpart, Bill Forwood.

While usually orthodox in his support for National Party policies, Hall was one of a group of prominent National Party figures – including key senators Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash to express concern about the federal party&#x27;s support for the policy of voluntary student unionism. Hall in particular expressed concern about the effect it would have on rural universities and towns within his electorate, most notably surrounding the Churchill campus of Monash University. Hall also attracted much displeasure within the National Party&#x27;s conservative base after he voted for the Abortion Law Reform Act and a failed euthanasia bill in 2008.

After the Bracks Labor Government reformed the Legislative Council prior to the 2006 election, the new quota system was thought to enhance the chances of minor parties such as the Greens and Family First winning seats. However, a statewide swing to the National Party, including localised gains in Gippsland lower house electorates, the running of candidates in new seats such as Gembrook and Hastings, and adroit preference deals, saw Hall win the final Eastern Region seat ahead of the Greens candidate.

When the Liberal/National Coalition won the 2010 Victorian state election, Hall was commissioned as Minister for Higher Education and Skills, and Minister for the Teaching Profession. In May 2012 he caused some surprise, and anger within the government, by declaring in a letter to leaders of TAFE institutions his &quot;shock, incredulity, disbelief and anger&quot; at the big funding cuts to the sector in the state budget. This later led to speculation that he would be dropped from the state cabinet in a reshuffle.

On 24 February 2014, Hall announced he would not be contesting the 2014 state election, and would retire after 25 years in politics. On 12 March, Hall announced that he would be resigning from politics nine months before the election, and would deliver his valedictory speech on 13 March.

<doc id="1187013" wikidata="Q7958860" url="?curid=1187013" title="Waco Suspension Bridge">
<text>The Waco Suspension Bridge crosses the Brazos River in Waco, Texas. It is a single-span suspension bridge, with a main span of 475 ft (145 m). Opened on November 20, 1869, it contains nearly 3 million bricks. It is located north of downtown Waco, connecting Indian Spring Park (on the southwest side of the river) with Doris D. Miller Park (on the northeast side of the river). Every year on Independence Day, the bridge serves as a place where thousands of locals gather to watch fireworks. Indian Spring Park marks the location of the origin of the town of Waco, where the Huaco Indians had settled on the bank of the river, at the location of a cold spring.
Before 1869, crossing the Brazos River was a time-consuming and sometimes dangerous ordeal. The only way to cross the river was by ferry, and due to the location of Waco on the growing Chisholm Trail, local businessmen knew that a bridge was needed to support commerce. For this reason, members of Waco Masonic Lodge #92 proposed the creation of such a bridge and they assigned a committee which would form the Waco Bridge Company, responsible for funding and building the project. A charter was received from the state in 1866.

Col. John T. Flint, an Austin lawyer and banker, who had moved to Waco after the war and established a firm named Flint &amp; Chamberlain, went personally to New York to handle the contract for building a bridge.

In October 1868, the engineer he hired, Thomas M. Griffith, began to supervise the construction using cables from the Roebling company of Trenton, New Jersey. The logistical and engineering difficulties he encountered were abnormal because of the remote location.

Due to lack of machine shops in the Waco area, getting the materials to the building site was a journey in itself. The nearest railroad was away, and the closest town with artisans with the skills needed was Galveston, over 212 miles (341 km) from the build site. Supplies were loaded onto a steamer in Galveston, and ferried to Bryan. From there, they were loaded onto wagons pulled by oxen. The pothole-filled dirt road over 80 miles long from Bryan to Waco was bad, even by 19th-century Texas standards.

The twin double towers that anchored the span were considered to be a marvel of engineering at the time, containing nearly 3 million bricks, which were produced locally.

The bridge collected its first toll on January 1, 1870. Its span made it the first major suspension bridge in Texas.

The bridge was wide enough for stagecoaches to pass each other, or for cattle to cross one side of the bridge, and humans to cross the other side. Being the only bridge to cross the Brazos at the time, and the primary river crossing for the north-south travel through Texas (including cattle drives on the Chisholm Trail), the cost of building the bridge, which was estimated to be $141,000, was quickly paid back. Tolls were 5 cents per head of cattle that crossed, along with a charge for pedestrian traffic.

In 1889, the bridge was sold to McLennan County for $75,000, which removed all tolls. In 1913-1914, major reconstruction occurred on the bridge, replacing the older steel with higher gauge, and trusses were added to accommodate the span to carry heavier weights. This doubled as a new pedestrian walkway.

By 1971, the bridge had seen over 100 years of traffic. What started out as a cattle bridge had become a vehicular bridge, and the state historical committee decided that it was time to be retired, with larger and arguably safer bridges being built since the inception of the Waco Suspension Bridge. The bridge, by all accounts, helped to transform Waco from a small frontier town to a major commercial center. Today, the bridge is open to foot traffic only.

Beginning in October 2020, the bridge was closed as part of a $12.4 million rehabilitation project that involved replacing the suspension cables that had been installed in 1914, reinforcing the anchors, and replacing the decking. Temporary piers were placed in the river to support the deck while the cables were removed.

The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and was designated as a Texas Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1971.

<doc id="1187015" wikidata="Q5434091" url="?curid=1187015" title="Fans of Kate">
<text>Fans of Kate describe themselves as a &quot;haircut band from London&quot;, and they toured the UK between May 2004 and December 2005. They played guitar and piano driven pop-rock and cited influences such as Blur, Radiohead, Grandaddy and Broken Social Scene.

==History==
=== Formation ===
The band first started to play music together at Buckinghamshire Chilterns University College in High Wycombe circa 2003. Jamie and Steve (the guitarists) started to jam together and formed the band Reagan with some friends. Reagan produced an EP and shared the stage with an up-and-coming Bloc Party in December 2003. Reagan&#x27;s vocalist, Jez Dixon got married not long after and the band decided to take some time off. After getting back together the band discovered their new songs were taking them in a different direction. This new direction would become Fans of Kate.

===Band name===
The name Fans of Kate came about during a drive through Queen&#x27;s Park in London in summer 2004 after a game of pitch and putt. The band were on their way to a gig and on the lookout for a new name. They had decided they wanted to be Fans of something, but didn&#x27;t know what. Steve Hurdle (guitarist) decided &quot;the next fit girl we saw, we&#x27;d be fans of her&quot;. The next young lady to walk past the van was called Kate.

===Releases===

The band released 1,500 numbered copies of their debut EP &quot;Fans Of Kate EP&quot; on Headwrecker Records on 15 November 2004. This was followed up by the single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What To Do With My Hands&quot; which the band worked on alongside producer Dan Swift (Snow Patrol, The Cooper Temple Clause). &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know What To Do With My Hands&quot; was released initially as a one track promo on Headwrecker in March 2005, and then officially as a three track single on Moshi Moshi Records on 11 April 2005. Both the EP and the single were available from HMV&#x27;s online store for a short time.

===Touring===
Fans of Kate had three official tours and played around 150 gigs in venues such as Barfly and Club NME. They supported Electric Six in February 2005 and Dogs Die in Hot Cars in May 2005. An unofficial fourth tour with less frequent gigs interspersed the rest of the year.

====Tour dates====
===Split===
On 13 October 2005, Jamie Brown revealed on his blog that he had left the band:
So here I am, this is it, this is me, I am alone now. Jamie and FOK had a meeting and it was decided by both parties about three months previous that I didn&#x27;t belong there, I just cant do the new direction that is happening, I used to love playing those songs but I just cant do it in the way its going, I cant. We are all still friends an all, it&#x27;s incredibly amicable but the band I loved being in is gone.

This was confirmed on the band&#x27;s website on 7 November. Fans of Kate continued to gig until December 2005 after which they appeared to go on hiatus. In January 2006, a new band was revealed called New Adventures. This band features the original Fans of Kate lineup minus Jamie, plus a new member, Helen Fisher, who sings and plays keys.

<doc id="1187016" wikidata="Q1269379" url="?curid=1187016" title="Vehicle registration plates of the Netherlands">
<text>Vehicle registration plates of the Netherlands are vehicle registration plates issued by the RDW (Dutch Vehicle Authority).

RDW vehicle registration plates are assigned bearing the same &quot;number&quot; which is a sequence of characters composed of letters and digits as that is shown on the vehicle&#x27;s registration document. The numbering scheme used bears no relation to the place of a vehicle&#x27;s registration or ownership, and numbers – which are issued in strict time order – identify the vehicle, not its owner. Thus, if a vehicle changes ownership, the registration number remains unchanged.

If the car is registered before 1 January 1978, it may have a dark-blue number plate also called &#x27;historical plates&#x27;. Taxis will have a light-blue number plate because they pay a different amount of tax to let people into the car legally. If a taxi does not have a blue number plate on it, it is an illegal taxi and the driver will charge a lesser fare to the person in the car.

A green plate is a &#x27;trade plate&#x27;, i.e. a temporary number plate used by motor traders or vehicle testers to save them the cost and time to register and tax every vehicle temporarily in their possession.

==Earlier schemes==
The Netherlands introduced a system of vehicle registration plates on 26 April 1898 – the third country in the world to do so, after France in 1893 and Germany in 1896. A plate bearing the number 1 was issued to one J. van Dam, who purchased the first Dutch-built motorcar, which was manufactured at his own &quot;Groninger Motor-Rijtuigen Fabriek&quot;. Plate numbers stayed with the owner, unlike the present system. From 1906, a new system used the format , where was a province code and a serial number. This system lasted until 1951 when the current system was introduced.

=== Province codes ===

* A: Groningen
* B: Friesland
* D: Drenthe
* E: Overijssel
* G, GZ, GX: North Holland
* H, HZ, HX: South Holland
* K: Zeeland
* M: Gelderland
* N: North Brabant
* L: Utrecht
* P: Limburg
* R: overseas areas.

==Numbering schemes==
The current Dutch license plate system uses black letters on a light-reflecting yellow background, although white reflecting letters on a dark-blue background are allowed for vehicles built before 1977. Since 2000, the blue band with the European flag and NL has been mandatory for all vehicles except vehicles built before 1977. 

Dutch license plates can be formatted as follows:
Nowadays the letters used do not include vowels, to avoid profane or obscene language. To avoid confusion with a zero, the letters C and Q are also omitted and letters M and W are not used because they are too wide. Letters and numbers are issued in strict alphabetical/numeric order. Thus a Dutch license plate indicates the date of registration of a car, but no information about where in the country the car comes from, or to whom it belongs.

==Other formats==
With the introduction of the GAIK series, several other formats have been introduced as well. All background colors used are retroreflective.

==Recent changes==

License plates subtly changed shape in 2002 when a new font was introduced, amongst other changes.
* Combatting fraudulent reports of stolen license plates, license plates are replaced immediately but using the same number. The new license plate is tagged with a small number 1 over the first dash, which is increased with each new plate.
* A blue background is used for taxis.
* White letters on a blue or black background are used for classic cars older than 1 January 1978 and with a registration number in sidecode 1, 2, or 3.
* Black letters on a white background are used for small trailers that hide the car&#x27;s actual license plate.
* Large trailers, caravans, etc. now have black/yellow license plates.
* The letter Y is no longer used for cars, but instead for fast motorboats.
* The letter combinations SDB to SDZ as well as SSB to SSZ are not issued as SD, SS and SA continue to have fascist connotations in the Netherlands. Registrations with the letter combination NSB were issued in 2010, although these were recalled because these were the initials of the &quot;Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging&quot;.
* The letter combination KGB is not issued in side code 12.

==Special-use license plates==
This list is not exhaustive. The Dutch Wikipedia article Nederlands kenteken contains more exceptions.

== Vehicle registration ==

Since 1 January 2014, the Netherlands has had an all-plastic vehicle registration in credit card format. This and the driving license (which is the same size) are the only things needed to bring along while driving in the Netherlands. This registration has the same green appearance for every vehicle category, only the information on the card differs. It has a chip with more detailed information about the vehicle. All previously issued vehicle registrations will remain valid until the car changes ownership, or until the owner requests replacement vehicle registration documents. While a so-called &quot;overschrijvingsbewijs&quot; (a separate document that came with the vehicle registration) was needed previously to sell the vehicle, this has now been replaced with a code. The registration card and the correct code are enough to sell the vehicle, even without the original letter stating the code as issued during the new car registration.

<text>RAE Bedford was a research site of the Royal Aircraft Establishment between 1946 and 1994. It was located near the village of Thurleigh, north of the town of Bedford in England and was the site of aircraft experimental development work.

In the book &quot;A Short Illustrated History of the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Bedford&quot;, author Arthur Pearcy writes: &quot;(RAE Bedford is) the finest research and development establishment outside the U.S.A.&quot;

Starting in 1946, construction work began to turn the wartime RAF airfield into what became known as the Royal Aeronautical Establishment, Bedford. The runway was extended in the post-war period to accommodate the Bristol Brabazon aircraft, which required a very long runway but which never went into production. A lot of the development for what became the Harrier was done here, one early version became known as the &#x27;Flying Bedstead&#x27;. Also Thurleigh had a catapult runway and it was here that the &#x27;ski jump&#x27; later fitted to some aircraft carriers was also developed. One local road was put in a cutting for a runway to be put above it, linking the Airfield site to the wind-tunnel site about a mile and a half away, although ultimately this was never carried out. The runway is some 10,500 ft long, and some 300 ft wide and as of June 2011 is used by a number of car storage companies.

Naval Air Department and the BEA Helicopters Experimental Unit was here at some point.

The airfield was decommissioned in February 1994 after a lengthy study determined that flight operations should be centralised at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire. Due to the cost and impracticality of relocating the Advanced Flight Simulator system the site retains some of its development work (under the banner of QinetiQ from mid-2001 onwards). As of early 2007, QinetiQ have sold their remaining stake in the Bedford Airfield site (as well as the nearby &#x27;Wind Tunnel&#x27; site) and are planning to relocate the remaining staff to Farnborough in early 2008, finally ending the site&#x27;s long association with military aviation.

The airfield was closed officially in March 1994 and sold in 1996 with the RAE having become the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). DERA consolidated its experimental flying operations at Boscombe Down, moving aircraft from Farnborough as well as Bedford.

The wind tunnel site is now the Twinwoods Business Park and some of the buildings are in commercial use. Red Bull Racing use the remaining horizontal wind tunnel and Twinwoods Adventure use the vertical wind tunnel, previously the Vertical Spinning Tunnel (VST) for indoor skydiving.

The VST was converted in 2005 by Bodyflight to be the first indoor skydiving wind tunnel in the UK, and at 16.4 ft in diameter remains the largest. On 1 March 2019, Historic England listed the VST as Grade 2 due to its historic and architectural interest. The rest of the building was converted in 2007 and is used by Twinwoods Adventure as a multi-activity centre.

Another building on the site is the Yarl&#x27;s Wood Immigration Removal Centre.

<doc id="1187020" wikidata="Q1388908" url="?curid=1187020" title="Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer">
<text>Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer, PC, FRS (December 1708 – 11 December 1781) was an English politician and rake, Chancellor of the Exchequer (1762–1763) and founder of the Hellfire Club.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Dashwood was born in Great Marlborough Street, London, in December 1708. He was the only son of Sir Francis Dashwood, 1st Baronet, and his second wife Mary, eldest daughter of Vere Fane, 4th Earl of Westmorland.

Sir Francis and Mary had two children: a son, Francis, and a daughter, Rachael. Sir Francis also had two surviving daughters from his first marriage, and later two daughters and two sons from his third.

Dashwood was educated at Eton College where he became associated with William Pitt the Elder. Upon the death of his father in 1724, Dashwood, who was only fifteen, inherited his father&#x27;s estates and the Baronetcy of Dashwood of West Wycombe.

===Travels===
Dashwood spent his youth and early adulthood abroad, gaining a reputation for notoriety while travelling around Europe. He impersonated Charles XII of Sweden while in Russia and attempted to seduce Anna Ioannovna. Dashwood was later expelled from the Papal States.

Dashwood&#x27;s journeys abroad included classical aspects of the European Grand Tour. He travelled to France and Germany for several months in 1726. He went abroad again from 1729 to 1731 and visited Italy during this time. He later returned to Italy between 1739 and 1741, staying in Florence and Rome and visiting Livorno and the excavations at Herculaneum.

While in Italy he befriended the philosopher and theologian Antonio Niccolini. In 1733, between his visits to Italy, Dashwood accompanied George, Lord Forbes, to St Petersburg, stopping on the way at Copenhagen.

===Dilettanti Society and the Divan Club===
In 1732, Dashwood formed a dining club called the Society of Dilettanti with around 40 charter members who had returned from their travels with an appreciation of classical art. William Hogarth drew &quot;Sir Francis Dashwood at his Devotions&quot; for Dilettante Viscount Boyne. &quot;[I]f not the actual projector and founder of the Dilettanti Society, he was certainly its leading member in 1736&quot;. Dashwood took a prominent part in the proceedings of the Dilettanti Society, and in 1742 George Knapton painted his portrait for the Society. On 2 March 1746, when John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich was suspended from his office of archmaster for &quot;his misbehaviour to and contempt of the Society&quot;, Dashwood was elected in his place. Dashwood presented to King George II various petitions from the Dilettanti Society when it was seeking a permanent location.

In 1740, Dashwood was in Florence with Horace Walpole, Gray, and others, and shortly afterwards, got into trouble with Sir Horace Mann. In 1743 Horace Walpole critically described the Dilettanti Society as &quot;a club for which the nominal qualification is having been to Italy, and the real one, being drunk; the two chiefs are Lord Middlesex and Sir Francis Dashwood, who were seldom sober the whole time they were in Italy&quot;.

However, the society did increasingly have a serious side, and Dashwood&#x27;s work resulted in his election as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in June 1746, and a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA) in June 1769. He also became a member of the Lincoln Club in the mid-1740s and the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce in 1754. He had connections with the Spalding Society and became vice-president of both the Foundling Hospital and the General Medical Asylum.
In 1744, he and John Montagu founded the short-lived Divan Club for those who had visited the Ottoman Empire to share their experiences, but this club was disbanded two years later.

===Politics===
On Dashwood&#x27;s return to England, he obtained a minor post in the household of Frederick Lewis, Prince of Wales. This connection, coupled with the dismissal of his uncle, the Earl of Westmorland, from his colonelcy of the first troop of horse guards, made Dashwood a violent opponent of Robert Walpole&#x27;s administration. He sponsored George Dodington, 1st Baron Melcombe&#x27;s membership of the Dilettanti.

During the general election of 1741 Dashwood fought vigorously against Walpole&#x27;s supporters and secured a seat for himself at New Romney on 5 May. In Parliament he followed Samuel Sandys, 1st Baron Sandys and vehemently attacked Sir Robert Walpole, declaring that abroad he was looked upon with contempt. Walpole&#x27;s fall made no difference to Dashwood&#x27;s position, and as a courtier of Frederick Lewis he was in opposition to all of George II&#x27;s governments.

In 1747 he introduced a poor-relief bill that recommended commissioning public works (such as the Hellfire Caves he later had excavated at West Wycombe Park) to combat unemployment. The bill failed.

Dashwood was re-elected for New Romney on 26 June 1747, and in January 1751 disavowed Jacobitism, of which Andrew Stone and others of the household of George, Prince of Wales were suspected. Dashwood supported the influence of George Dodington and opposed the Regency Bill of 15 May 1751. On 13 April 1749 he was created Doctor of Civil Law of Oxford University, and on 19 June 1746 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society

===The Hellfire Club===
Dashwood was too young to have been a member of the first Hellfire Club, founded by Philip, Duke of Wharton in 1719 and disbanded in 1721, but he and John Montagu are alleged to have been members of a Hellfire Club that met at the George and Vulture Inn throughout the 1730s. It was again at the George and Vulture that in 1746 Dashwood founded the precursor of his own Hellfire Club, a group called the &quot;Knights of St. Francis&quot;. This was a parody of a religious order, based on a pun upon his own name and that of the medieval Italian saint, Francis of Assisi.

Dashwood first had the idea of founding a parody of the Franciscan order when he returned from one of his Grand Tours, around 1731. He had visited various monastic communities in Europe, &quot;founded, as it were, in direct contradiction to Nature and Reason&quot;, and he thought that by founding &quot;a burlesque Institution in the name of St Francis&quot;, he could substitute &quot;convivial gaiety, unrestrained hilarity, and social felicity [...] in lieu of the austerities and abstemiousness there practised.&quot;

In 1752, he moved the group&#x27;s headquarters to his family home in West Wycombe, holding the first meeting on Walpurgis Night. The group was now known as &quot;the Order of the Friars of St. Francis of Wycombe&quot;. The group subsequently moved their meetings to Medmenham Abbey, about 6 miles from West Wycombe, where they called themselves the &quot;Monks of Medmenham&quot;.

Medmenham Abbey had been built by the Cistercian Order and was situated on the banks of the Thames near Marlow, Buckinghamshire. It was owned by Francis Duffield, from whom it was rented by Dashwood, his half-brother Sir John Dashwood-King, his cousin Sir Thomas Stapleton, the satirist Paul Whitehead, and John Wilkes. The men frequently went to Medmenham Abbey during the summer. They had the buildings restored by the architect Nicholas Revett in the style of the 18th-century Gothic revival. Hogarth may have painted murals for this building but none survive.

The members included &quot;Frederick, Prince of Wales, the Duke of Queensberry, the Earl of Bute, Lord Melcombe, Sir William Stanhope, K.B, Sir John Dashwood-King, bart., Sir Francis Delaval, K.B., Sir John Vanluttan, kt., Henry Vansittart, Benjamin Franklin [...] and Paul [Whitehead] the poet&quot;. Meetings occurred twice a month, with an annual general meeting lasting a week or more in June or September.

According to Horace Walpole, who visited the abbey, the members&#x27; &quot;practice was rigorously pagan: Bacchus and Venus were the deities to whom they almost publicly sacrificed; and the nymphs and the hogsheads [casks of spirits] that were laid in against the festivals of this new church, sufficiently informed the neighbourhood of the complexion of those hermits.&quot; Over the grand entrance to the abbey was placed, in stained glass, the famous inscription on Rabelais&#x27; abbey of Theleme, &quot;Fay ce que voudras&quot; [do what thou wilt]. Dashwood&#x27;s garden at West Wycombe contained numerous statues and shrines to different gods: Daphne and Flora, Priapus, Venus and Dionysus. The members addressed each other as &quot;Brothers&quot; and the leader, which changed regularly, as &quot;Abbot&quot;. During meetings members supposedly wore ritual clothing: white trousers, jacket and cap, while the &quot;Abbot&quot; wore a red ensemble of the same style. Prostitutes were supposedly referred to as &quot;nuns&quot;. Club meetings were said to have included mock rituals, items of a pornographic nature, much drinking, &quot;wenching&quot; and banqueting. The &quot;monks&quot; were said to have performed obscene parodies of Christian rites, as well as orgies of drunkenness and debauchery in which Dashwood used a communion cup to pour out libations to heathen deities. These details, possibly embellished, were described in a contemporary novel by the Anglo-Irish satirist Charles Johnstone.

As a contrast to the frivolity of Medmenham Abbey, Dashwood erected a church on a neighbouring hill. Charles Churchill, who previously labeled Dashwood &quot;a disgrace to manhood&quot; over his actions at Medmenham Abbey, and John Wilkes criticized this, implying it to be disingenuous. Wilkes wrote that the church was &quot;built on the top of a hill for the convenience and devotion of the town at the bottom of it&quot;.

===Later political career===

In 1754, Dashwood was re-elected to parliament for New Romney, and when the Buckinghamshire militia was raised on the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1757, Dashwood became its first colonel with Wilkes as his lieutenant colonel. In the same year, he attempted to prevent Admiral John Byng&#x27;s execution.

On 28 March 1761, he found a new seat in Parliament for Weymouth and Melcombe Regis; he was re-elected on 9 June 1762 on his appointment as Chancellor of the Exchequer, which he owed to his dependence upon the Prime Minister, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. Dashwood&#x27;s ability in government was criticized: &quot;Of financial knowledge he did not possess the rudiments, and his ignorance was all the more conspicuous from the great financial ability of his predecessor Legge. His budget speech was so confused and incapable that it was received with shouts of laughter. An excise of four shillings in the hogshead, to be paid by the grower, which he imposed on cider and perry, raised a resistance through the cider counties hardly less furious than that which had been directed against the excise scheme of Walpole&quot;. Dashwood and the Prime Minister resigned from the ministry on 8 April 1763. Dashwood received the sinecure Keepership of the Wardrobe.

In 1763, Dashwood was summoned to Parliament as 11th Baron le Despencer. He inherited the barony after the death of his uncle, John Fane, 7th Earl of Westmorland and 10th Baron le Despencer.

By 1763 Dashwood was premier baronet of England, and he was made Lord-Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire, being succeeded in the colonelcy of the militia by John Wilkes. As Lord le Despencer, his public image became less associated with his past controversial actions. He joined John Montagu in leveling obscenity charges against John Wilkes for writing a pornographic poem, &quot;An Essay on Woman&quot;. During Lord North&#x27;s administration from 1770 to 1781, Dashwood was joint Postmaster General. Dashwood died at West Wycombe after a long illness on 11 December 1781. He was buried in the mausoleum he had built there, next to his wife who had died on 19 January 1769.

==Family==

On 19 December 1745, Dashwood married Sarah, daughter of George Gould of Iver, Buckinghamshire. Horace Walpole described her as &quot;a poor forlorn Presbyterian prude&quot;; The marriage had no effect upon Dashwood&#x27;s profligacy; according to Wraxall he &quot;far exceeded in licentiousness of conduct any model exhibited since Charles II&quot;.

Dashwood left no legitimate issue, and the Barony of le Despencer again fell into abeyance. His illegitimate daughter unsuccessfully claimed a right to the title. His sister Rachael illegally assumed the title Baroness le Despencer, but on her death the abeyance was once more terminated in favour of her cousin, Thomas Stapleton. After Dashwood&#x27;s death, his baronetcy passed to his half-brother, Sir John Dashwood-King.

<text>Teignmouth Melvill VC (8 September 1842 – 22 January 1879) was an English officer in the British Army and recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==

The son of Philip Melvill, he was educated at Harrow School, Cheltenham School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a contributor to &quot;Baily&#x27;s Magazine of Sports &amp; Pastimes&quot; under the name &#x27;Green Facings.&#x27;

He was 36 years old, and a lieutenant in the 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot (2nd Warwickshires), British Army during the Anglo-Zulu War when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 22 January 1879 after the disaster of the Battle of Isandhlwana, South Africa, Lieutenant Melvill made efforts to save the Queen&#x27;s Colour of his regiment. He and Nevill Josiah Aylmer Coghill were pursued by Zulu warriors and after experiencing great difficulty in crossing the swollen Buffalo River, during which time the Colour was lost and carried downstream, the two men were overtaken by the enemy and following a short struggle both were killed. The Colour was retrieved from the river ten days later.

Melvill and Coghill were amongst the first soldiers to receive the VC posthumously in 1907. Initially &quot;The London Gazette&quot; mentioned that had they survived they would have been awarded the VC.

He was played by James Faulkner in the film &quot;Zulu Dawn&quot;.

Teignmouth Philip Melvill (1877–1951) polo player, and Charles Melvill (1878–1925) a major general, were his sons.

==The medal==
His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of The Royal Welsh in Brecon, Powys, Wales.

<text>The United States Army Reserve (USAR) is a reserve force of the United States Army. Together, the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard constitute the Army element of the reserve components of the United States Armed Forces.

==History==

===Origins===

On 23 April 1908 Congress created the Medical Reserve Corps, the official predecessor of the Army Reserve. After World War I, under the National Defense Act of 1920, Congress reorganized the U.S. land forces by authorizing a Regular Army, a National Guard and an Organized Reserve (Officers Reserve Corps and Enlisted Reserve Corps) of unrestricted size, which later became the Army Reserve. This organization provided a peacetime pool of trained Reserve officers and enlisted men for use in war. The Organized Reserve included the Officers Reserve Corps, Enlisted Reserve Corps and Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC).

===Interwar period and World War II===

The Organized Reserve infantry divisions raised immediately after World War I generally continued the lineage and geographic area distribution of National Army divisions that had served in the war. They were maintained on paper with a maximum of all of their officers and one-third of their enlisted men. Units in other arms of the Army besides infantry were also maintained, such as field artillery, coast artillery, cavalry, engineers, medical, signal, quartermaster, and ordnance. In March 1926, the War Department authorized the manning of Regular Army units being maintained in an &quot;inactive&quot; status with Organized Reserve officers, eliminating the previously used &quot;Active Affiliate&quot; program for these units. Nearly all &quot;Regular Army Inactive&quot; (RAI) infantry regiments and many other units were &quot;affiliated&quot; with Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) units in their vicinity. The professor of military science and tactics at the school or the senior Regular Army officer of the unit&#x27;s branch assigned to the ROTC program served as the unit commander, and the unit was populated with graduates of the program. By 1 October 1933, command of all RAI units had been turned over to Reserve officers. A number of the affiliations became defunct throughout the 1930s, but RAI units were among the most active in the Reserve.

The ultimate use of Organized Reserve units and personnel remained unclear in the interwar period. While Army regulations stated that &quot;The ultimate objective in training units of the Organized Reserve in time of peace is to provide partially trained units which may be readily expanded to war strength and completely trained in time of emergency,&quot; historian William J. Woolley wrote that, &quot;The question of whether reserve units were to be chiefly concerned with mobilizing and training a conscripted citizen army or were to be contingents of a nearly ready combat force was never resolved in the 1930s, and reforms in training efforts often shifted between one and the other of the two objectives.&quot; Service in the Organized Reserve during the interwar period was not as appealing as the Army expected, and suffered because of limited funding that restricted training opportunities. Weekly inactive training drills were unpaid, and the average Organized Reserve officer was ordered to active duty for two weeks of paid training only once every three or four years; some officers trained nearly every year, to the detriment of others who had to wait as long as seven years between training opportunities. Turnover in the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps was high, as many men in mandatory ROTC had little interest in military affairs, and allowed their five-year commissions to expire without applying for reappointment. By the beginning of the 1930s, ROTC graduates became the single largest cohort of officers in the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps.

The original Regular Army Reserve, established in 1916 but abolished in 1920, had chiefly been manned by the reenlistment of former Regular Army soldiers or National Guardsmen, but the small annual stipend as an incentive for joining was not included in the Enlisted Reserve Corps (ERC). Another problem with the Enlisted Reserve Corps was the few avenues through which someone could join. Enlistment in the ERC was restricted to those men &quot;who have had such military or technical training as may be prescribed by regulations of the Secretary of War.&quot; One means to join the ERC was through the ROTC or Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC). If a man had completed at least one year in ROTC, or had completed one 4-week CMTC camp, he could also enlist in the ERC. Each year of participation in ROTC and completion of each CMTC camp earned the participant promotions in the ERC. Some enlisted reservists went on to receive commissions in a few years, thus leaving the ranks of the ERC. The final way one could enter the ERC was if he (or she, in the case of nurses) possessed skills needed by the Army that required no prior military training, such as nursing, railroad occupations, certain communications fields, and music. Interestingly, a substantial number of enlisted reservists in the interwar period, at least into the early 1930s, were bandsmen. Because of these restrictions, the ERC maintained an average strength of only about 3,500 men and women, and never more than 6,000 at any time from 1919 to 1941; most divisions reached their full complement of officers but had less than 100 enlisted men.

The extent of the U.S. Army&#x27;s mobilization before its involvement in World War II—“a state neither of war nor of peace&quot;—disrupted the Organized Reserve. Beginning in mid-1940, large numbers of Reserve officers began to be called to active duty individually and assigned to expanding Regular Army units, and to National Guard units after the mobilization of that component was authorized in August. On 30 June 1940, 2,710 Reserve officers were on active duty, but by 15 May 1941, the number was over 46,000, and by 30 June, 57,309. The need for young, qualified company-grade officers (lieutenants and captains) was acute, and by mid-1941, 75 to 90 percent of the officers in Regular Army units and 10 percent in National Guard units were Reserve officers. By December 1941, 80,000 Reserve officers were on active duty. By the end of 1942, 140,000 officers holding Reserve commissions through various paths were on active duty, but by that date, 12,100 who had been previously commissioned &quot;had not received such orders,&quot; mainly for reasons like being over-age in grade, found medically disqualified for active service, deferred due to academics or civilian employment, or lack of vacancies.

On 6 February 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9049, which ordered &quot;into the active military service of the United States...for the duration of the present war and for six months after the termination thereof...each of the organizations and units and all of the personnel of the Organized Reserve not already in such service;&quot; because most Reserve officers were already on sctive duty, this amounted to a “public relations” document. Because of the course of the mobilization of 1940–1941, &quot;few of the Reserve officers originally assigned to...units were available for duty with them. Consequently, the units as activated bore small resemblance to those of peacetime.&quot; The order and timetable in which Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered to active duty was based upon the number of World War I battle honors earned (if applicable), the location and availability of training sites, and the ability of the Army to furnish divisional cadres and filler replacements.

The 101st Infantry Division was designated a division of the Organized Reserve after World War I and assigned to the state of Wisconsin; unlike the 82nd Airborne Division, the Reserve division was disbanded when the 101st Airborne Division was raised in the Army of the United States on 15 August 1942.

===Cold War===

A tentative troop basis for the Organized Reserve Corps (ORC), prepared in March 1946, outlined 25 divisions: three armored, five airborne, and 17 infantry. These divisions and all other Organized Reserve Corps units were to be maintained in one of three strength categories, labeled Class A, Class B, and Class C. Class A units were divided into two groups, one for combat and one for service, and units were to be at required table of organization strength; Class B units were to have their full complement of officers and enlisted cadre strength; and Class C were to have officers only. The troop basis listed nine divisions as Class A, nine as Class B, and seven as Class C.

Major General Ray E. Porter therefore proposed reclassification of all Class A divisions as Class B units. Eventually the War Department agreed and made the appropriate changes. Although the dispute over Class A units lasted several months, the War Department proceeded with the reorganization of the Organized Reserve Corps divisions during the summer of 1946. That all divisions were to begin as Class C (officers only) units, progressing to the other categories as men and equipment became available, undoubtedly influenced the decision. Also, the War Department wanted to take advantage of the pool of trained reserve officers and enlisted men from World War II. By that time Army Ground Forces had been reorganized as an army group headquarters that commanded six geographic armies. The armies replaced the nine corps areas of the prewar era, and the army commanders were tasked to organize and train both Regular Army and Organized Reserve Corps units.

The plan the army commanders received called for twenty-five Organized Reserve Corps divisions, but the divisions activated between September 1946 and November 1947 differed somewhat from the original plans. The First United States Army declined to support an airborne division, and the 98th Infantry Division replaced the 98th Airborne Division. After the change, the Organized Reserve Corps had four airborne, three armored, and eighteen infantry divisions. The Second Army insisted upon the number 80 for its airborne unit because the division was to be raised in the prewar 80th Division&#x27;s area, not that of the 99th. Finally, the 103rd Infantry Division, organized in 1921 in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona, was moved to Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota in the Fifth United States Army area. The Seventh Army (later replaced by Third Army), allotted the 15th Airborne Division, refused the designation, and the adjutant general replaced it by constituting the 108th Airborne Division, which fell within that component&#x27;s list of infantry and airborne divisional numbers. Thus the final tally of divisions formed after World War II appears to have been the 19th, 21st, and 22d Armored Divisions; the 80th, 84th, 100th and 108th Airborne Divisions; and the 76th, 77th, 79th, 81st, 83rd, 85th, 87th, 89th, 90th, 91st, 94th, 95th, 96th, 97th, 98th, 102nd, 103rd, and 104th Infantry Divisions. 
A major problem in forming divisions and other units in the Organized Reserve Corps was adequate housing. While many National Guard units owned their own armories, some dating back to the nineteenth century, the Organized Reserve Corps had no facilities for storing equipment and for training. Although the War Department requested funds for needed facilities, Congress moved slowly in response. The Organized Reserve were redesignated 25 March 1948 as the Organized Reserve Corps. Recognizing the importance of the Organized Reserve to the World War II effort, Congress authorized retirement and drill pay for the first time in 1948.

During the summer and fall of 1951 the six army commanders in the United States, staff agencies, and the Section V Committee (created after World War I for the reserve components to have a voice in their affairs), evaluated Department of the Army reorganization plans for the ORC. The army commanders urged that all divisions in the Organized Reserve Corps be infantry divisions because they believed that the reserve could not adequately support armored and airborne training. They thought thirteen, rather than twelve, reserve divisions should be maintained to provide a better geographic distribution of the units. The Section V Committee opposed the reduction of the Organized Reserve Corps from twenty-five to thirteen divisions because it feared unfavorable publicity, particularly with the nation at war. On 20 December the Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General John E. Hull, directed the reorganization and redesignation of airborne and armored divisions as infantry as soon as practicable. In March 1952 the 80th, 84th, 100th, and 108th Airborne Divisions were reorganized and redesignated as infantry divisions, and the 63d, 70th, and 75th Infantry Divisions replaced the 13th, 21st, and 22d Armored Divisions.

Before the dust had settled on the reforms, the Army realized that it had failed to improve unit manning or meet reasonable mobilization requirements. In the fall of 1952 Army leaders thus proposed that the personnel from the thirteen inactivated Army Reserve divisions be assigned to strengthen the remaining twelve divisions. To keep the unneeded fifteen Army Reserve divisions active, they were to be reorganized as training divisions to staff training centers upon mobilization or man maneuver area commands for training troops. The continental army commanders implemented the new Army Reserve troop basis in 1955 piecemeal. They reorganized, without approved tables of organization, the 70th, 76th, 78th, 80th, 84th, 85th, 89th, 91st, 95th, 98th, 100th, and 108th Infantry Divisions as cadre for replacement training centers and organized the 75th &quot;Maneuver Area Command&quot; using the resources of the 75th Infantry Division. Two years later the 75th Infantry Division was inactivated along with 87th Infantry Division. Assets of the 87th were used to organize a maneuver area command; thus one unneeded division remained in the troop basis.

While the Korean War was still underway, Congress began making significant changes in the structure and role of the Army Reserve. These changes transformed the Organized Reserve into the United States Army Reserve, from 9 July 1952. This new organization was divided into a Ready Reserve, Standby Reserve, and Retired Reserve. Army Reserve units were authorized twenty-four inactive duty training days a year and up to seventeen days of active duty (called annual training).

In 1959 the Army decided to realign National Guard and Army Reserve divisions under Pentomic structures. Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy decided on 10 Army Reserve divisions. By October 1959 ten Army Reserve infantry divisions completed their transition, but at a reduced strength. The eleventh combat division in the Army Reserve, the 104th, was converted to training, for a total of thirteen training divisions, all of which were in the Army Reserve.

To reorganize the Army Reserve to the new Reorganization of Army Divisions (ROAD) structures in the early 1960s, the Army Staff decided to retain one Army Reserve division in each of the six Army areas and to eliminate four divisions. Army commanders selected the 63d, 77th, 81st, 83d, 90th, and 102d Infantry Divisions for retention and reorganized them under ROAD by the end of April 1963. Each division had two tank and six infantry battalions.

With the elimination of the 79th, 94th, 96th, and 103d Infantry Divisions, the Army decided to retain their headquarters as a way to preserve spaces for general and field grade officers. It reorganized the units as operational headquarters (subsequently called command headquarters [division]) and directed them to supervise the training of combat and support units located in the former divisional areas and to provide for their administrative support. Some former divisional units assigned to the four divisions were used to organize four brigades, which added flexibility to the force as well as provided four general officer reserve billets. In January and February 1963 the 157th, 187th, 191st, and 205th Infantry Brigades were organized with headquarters in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Montana, and Minnesota, respectively. The designation of each brigade was derived from the lowest numbered infantry brigade associated with the division under the square structure. As with the Regular Army brigades, the number and type of maneuver elements in each Army Reserve brigade varied.

In November 1965, a long-standing controversial goal of the Defense Department, a reduction of the reserve troop basis, was achieved. Those reserve units that were judged unnecessary and others that were undermanned and underequipped were deleted and their assets used to field contingency forces. Among the units inactivated were the last six combat divisions in the Army Reserve, the 63d, 77th, 81st, 83d, 90th, and 102d Infantry Divisions, and the 79th, 94th, and 96th Command Headquarters (Division). The 103d Command Headquarters (Division) was converted to a support brigade headquarters.

A number of U.S. Army Reserve corps headquarters were disestablished on 31 March 1968. They were reorganized as Army Reserve Commands.

In 1980, the peacetime USAR chain of command was overlaid with a wartime trace. In an expansion of the roundout and affiliation programs begun ten years earlier, CAPSTONE purported to align every Army Reserve unit with the active and reserve component units with which they were anticipated to deploy. Units maintained lines of communication with the units – often hundreds or thousands of miles away in peacetime – who would presumably serve above or below them in the event of mobilization. This communication, in some cases, extended to coordinated annual training opportunities.

Despite the commonly held belief that CAPSTONE traces were set in stone, the process of selecting units to mobilize and deploy in 1990 and 1991 in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm frequently ignored CAPSTONE.

=== Post Cold War ===
In the post-Cold War draw-down, all of the Army Reserve&#x27;s combat units were disbanded, except the 100th Battalion, 442nd Infantry Regiment. This meant the disestablishment of the three remaining Army Reserve fighting brigades: the 157th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) (Separate) of Pennsylvania, the 187th Infantry Brigade (Separate) of Massachusetts, and the 205th Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Light) of Minnesota. Many of the Army Reserve training divisions were realigned as institutional training divisions.

With the Army National Guard providing reserve component combat formations and related combat support units, the Army Reserve is configured to provide combat support, combat service support, peacekeeping, nation-building and civil support capability. With roughly twenty percent of the Army&#x27;s organized units and 5.3 percent of the Army&#x27;s budget, the Army Reserve provides about half of the Army&#x27;s combat support and a quarter of the Army&#x27;s mobilization base expansion capability.

==Reserve service today==
Reserve Component (RC) Soldiers mainly perform part-time duties as opposed to the full-time (active duty) Soldiers, but rotate through mobilizations to full-time duty. When not on active duty, RC Soldiers typically perform training and service one weekend per month, currently referred to as Battle Assembly, and for two continuous weeks at a time during the year referred to as Annual Training (AT). Many RC Soldiers are organized into Army Reserve Troop Program Units (TPUs), while others serve in active Army units as Individual Mobilization Augmentees (IMAs), or are in non-drilling control groups of the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). Soldiers may also serve on active duty in an Active Guard Reserve (AGR) status in support of the United States Army Reserve (USAR) mission or through Active Duty Operational Support (ADOS) and Contingency Operations-Active Duty Operational Support (CO-ADOS) missions.

All United States Army soldiers sign an initial eight-year service contract upon entry into the military. Occasionally, the contract specifies that some of the service will be in the Regular Army (also called Active Component (AC)) for two, three, or four-year periods; with the remaining obligation served in the RC. Though typically, soldiers sign contracts specifying that all eight years be served in the RC, with the first six years in drilling status and the last two years in a non-drilling IRR status.

Soldiers entering directly into the U.S. Army Reserve nevertheless encompasses a period of initial entry training (IET). The amount of time begins with approximately nine weeks of Basic Combat Training (BCT), but total IET time varies according to the enlistee&#x27;s elected Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) which dictates Advanced Individual Training (AIT). All U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers are subject to mobilization throughout the term of their enlistment. Soldiers who, after completing the AC portion of their enlistment contract choose not to re-enlist on active duty, are automatically transferred to the RC to complete the remainder of their Statutory Obligation (eight-year service total) and may be served in a drilling Troop Program Unit (TPU), Individual Mobilization Augmentee (IMA), or Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) status.

Non-commissioned officers of the rank of Staff Sergeant (E-6) and above will reenlist for an indefinite status after they have served for 12 years of service or more.

The United States Army Reserve was composed of 188,703 soldiers as of late 2020.

==Importance to the Active Army==

A significant portion of many unit types and specializations exist in the Army Reserve. Some unique enabling units only exist in the Army Reserve. 
== Current active reserve formations and units ==

===Headquarters commands===
 Army Reserve Headquarters - Fort Bragg (formerly United States Army Reserve Command (USARC)) located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina
:Through USARC, the CAR commands all Army Reserve units. USARC is responsible for the staffing, training, management, and deployment of units to ensure readiness for Army missions. The Army Reserve consists of three main categories of units: operational and functional, support, and training. Due to Base Realignment and Closure Act, the headquarters of USAR moved to Fort Bragg.

 Army Reserve Staff - National Capital Region (NCR) (formerly Office of the Chief of Army Reserve (OCAR)) located at both Fort Belvoir, Virginia and The Pentagon 
:OCAR provides the Chief of Army Reserve (CAR) with a staff of functional advisors who develop and execute Army Reserve plans, policies and programs, plus administer Army Reserve personnel, operations, and funding. The CAR is responsible for plans, policies and programs affecting all Army Reserve Soldiers, including those who report directly to the Army. OCAR is composed of specialized groups that advise and support the CAR on a wide variety of issues.

==Individual Ready Reserve==
 The Individual Ready Reserve (IRR) consists of individuals who are active reservists but not assigned to a particular Active Reserve Unit. Members of the IRR are encouraged to take advantage of training opportunities and are eligible for promotion provided all requirements are met.

==Retired Reserve==
The Retired Reserve, by law, consists of soldiers who have retired from the reserve component of the Army, regardless whether the reserve soldier has qualified for: (1) an active duty “Regular” retirement (20+ years cumulative active duty) with retired generally beginning immediately, (2) for a reserve “non-Regular” retirement (20+ cumulative federally creditable qualifying years) with retired pay generally starting at age 60, or (3) for a disability retirement as a result of an unfitting, line of duty injury or illness with retired pay generally beginning immediately upon retirement.

Until 1995, Army Regulations directed that enlisted Regular Army soldiers with 20 to 30 years of active service upon retirement were to be transferred upon retirement to the Retired Reserve, to remain such until they had served a total of 30 years combined active service and Retired Reserve service, at which point they would be fully retired and transferred back to the Regular Army for placement on the Retired List. Congress repealed those archaic provisions (for the Air Force as well). Since 1995, all Regular Army enlisted soldiers who retire remain in the Regular Component, and are placed on the appropriate Retired List (Regular, Permanent Disability, or Temporary Disability).

National Guard soldiers who retire are discharged from their State’s National Guard, and transferred to the Army Reserve &quot;in toto&quot; and are placed on the Retired Reserve List. As such, they no longer hold the statutory dual-status defined in the National Guard Act of 1934, as members of both their State’s militia and the federal reserve component. However, some States have chosen to enact laws that provide for placement of retired or former members of the National Guard, or even Regular components, onto State Militia Retired Lists; such provisions do not affect federal retirement eligibility or benefits, and are solely a matter between that State and the individual.

==Other components==
The Army of the United States (AUS) is the official name for the conscripted force of the Army that may be raised at the discretion of the United States Congress, often at time of war or mobilization for war. The Army of the United States was first established in 1940 and its last use of the AUS was in 1974. The predecessors of the AUS were the National Army during World War I and the Volunteer Army during the American Civil War and Spanish–American War.

<text>The Great Seal of Ontario is a governmental seal used to authenticate documents issued by the Canadian Government of Ontario that are released in the name of the King in Right of Ontario, including the appointment of the Executive Council and Ministers (the Cabinet).

==Design==
In the centre of the Great Seal is the shield from the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom (representing the link to Britain), with a Tudor Crown above and the armorial shield of Ontario below. Several borders surround these symbols, including the words &quot;The Seal of the Province of Ontario&quot; in English only.

A sculpture of the Great Seal is carved above the main entrance to the Ontario legislature at Queen&#x27;s Park.

==History==

The Great Seal has been used since January 1, 1870, following the appointment through a Royal Warrant by Queen Victoria. The keeper of the Great Seal is the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, but the Minister of Government and Consumer Services maintains day-to-day custody of the seal.

The current seal replaced the Great Seal of the Province of Canada, used from 1841 to 1867, under the 136th clause of the British North America Act, 1867. This former seal was carved on an interior wall of the House of Commons of Canada in Ottawa in 1953. Before 1841, the Great Seal of Upper Canada had been in use since 1792.

<doc id="1187032" wikidata="Q4164648" url="?curid=1187032" title="Islam in Mauritius">
<text>Islam is the third largest religion in Mauritius. Muslims constitute over 18.24 per cent of Mauritius population. Many Mauritian muslims are of Indian descent, tracing their origins to the large-scale migration of indentured laborers from India during the British colonial period. This migration began in 1834 and continued throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Mauritius became independent in 1968 and no official religion is defined in the constitution. Hindus make up about half of the population, Christians about a third and Muslims most of the rest. Several religious groups including Muslim ones are recognized by parliamentary decree and receive state subsidies according to their percentage of the population.

==History==
Some scholars believed that Muslims arrived in Mauritius with the Dutch as slaves from Arabia, but this view has been disproved as the Arabians who were with the Dutch were mostly traders. Muslims arrived in Mauritius during the British regime, starting in 1810. Indentured labourers arrived on a large scale from India, mostly from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Bengal, and the cities of Kolkata and Mumbai. There were a total of 450,000 immigrants during the period from 1835 to 1907, and after 1909, the immigration of indentured labourers stopped. They were brought from India for a period of five years, after which they were returned. By 1922, only 160,000 had returned to India, while others settled down in Mauritius. There were a few families of wealthy Muslim traders from Gujarat which also settled along with the majority poor working classes. The population of Muslims is rumoured to have been 33% (no reference) of the total population during 1835, 64% during 1861 (no reference), but allegedly reduced to less than 25% by 1909. Traditionally Sunnis remained a majority, while other groups like Sunni Shafia, Shia and Bohra formed around 20 per cent of the total Muslims in the country. Cocknies, Kodjas, Bohras and Aga-khanities are believed to have arrived in Mauritius during 1910 from East Africa. Tawheed ideology, which was commonly followed in Mauritius was replaced by Islamic Circle Religious Group which culled out religious practices from India. The trend was changed after the evolution of oil-rich Arab countries in the 1970s.

==Communities==

The largest group of Muslims are the Sunnis, comprising around 90 per cent of the population. Sunnis are divided among various factions such as the Salafis. While the majority adheres to the Hanafi school of thoughts, there are other factions that follow the Shafe&#x27;i school of thought. There are also Muslims who follow Shi&#x27;ism. Meimons are a small aristocratic group, who control the Jummah Mosque in Port Louis. Shiaties form a small community of around 3 per cent of the total population. One of the subgroups are called Cocknies, who are believed to have arrived as boat builders from Cochin in India. Creole Lascars are a new subgroup, who have intermarried with Cocknies or other communities.

Within the Muslim community, there are three distinct ethnic groups that exist, notably the Memons and the Surtees (who are rich merchants who came from Kutch and Surat province of Gujarat in India), then the &quot;Hindi Calcattias&quot; who came to Mauritius as indentured labourer from Bihar. Creole is the most used language among Muslims other than Arabic and Urdu, while other languages spoken include Bhojpuri, and Gujarati.

==Government policies==

Mauritius received independence during 1968 and there was no state religion in Mauritius defined in the constitution. The nation had no indigenous population nor any indigenous tribes or religion. The religious organizations present at the time of independence, namely, Roman Catholic Church, Church of England, Presbyterian Church, Seventh-day Adventist, Hindus and Muslims are recognized by parliamentary decree. The constitution and other laws protect freedom of religion. The groups recognized by the government before independence receive an annual sum for paying their adherents. The government allows overseas missionary groups to operate on a case-by-case basis, although there are no rules that prohibit proselytizing activities. The missionaries should obtain both residence permit and work permit to operate, which is provided for a maximum of three years, without any extension. There are lot of government holidays, most of which are religious indicating the heterogeneity of religions. As per the International Religious Freedom report of 2012 published by the United States Department of States, there were no incidence of religious abuses. The report also indicates other religions claim that Hindus have a majority in the government, while Hindus have sought a policy for anti-conversion.

==Mosques and administration==
As of 1965, there were 65 mosques in the country. The first purpose-built mosque in Mauritius is the Camp des Lascars Mosque in around 1805. It is now officially known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque.

The Jummah Mosque in Port Louis was built in the 1850s and is described in the Ministry of Tourism&#x27;s guide as one of the most beautiful religious buildings in Mauritius.

All mosques are controlled by a board called &quot;waqf&quot;, also a form of charitable organization. The Waqf Board in Mauritius was created in 1941 and it supervises the finances and administration of all the mosques. Each mosque has a manager named &quot;muttanwalli&quot;, elected by a congregation. The board helps executing funerals, imparting education in &quot;madraasas&quot; and all Islamic ceremonies. Major holidays like Bakrid, Eid, Mawlid,Shab-e-barat,Mi&#x27;raj and, for the Shia only, Muharram are celebrated with floats in the major mosques in the country.

<text>Southbank Centre is a complex of artistic venues in London, England, on the South Bank of the River Thames (between Hungerford Bridge and Waterloo Bridge).

It comprises three main performance venues (the Royal Festival Hall including the National Poetry Library, the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the Purcell Room), together with the Hayward Gallery, and is Europe’s largest centre for the arts. It attracted 4.36 million visitors during 2019. Over two thousand paid performances of music, dance and literature are staged at Southbank Centre each year, as well as over two thousand free events and an education programme, in and around the performing arts venues. In addition, three to six major art exhibitions are presented at the Hayward Gallery yearly, and national touring exhibitions reach over 100 venues across the UK.

== Location ==
Southbank Centre&#x27;s site, which formerly extended to 21 acres (85,000 m2) from County Hall to Waterloo Bridge, is fronted by The Queen’s Walk. In 2012 management of Jubilee Gardens transferred to the Jubilee Gardens Trust and the car park on the remaining land beyond Hungerford Bridge was sold in 2013, to extend the gardens as part of the Shell Centre redevelopment. The site is next to the National Theatre and BFI Southbank, but does not include them.

The closest Underground stations are Waterloo and Embankment.

== Personnel ==

Misan Harriman became chairman of the Board of Governors of the Southbank Centre in 2022, succeeding Susan Gilchrist, who had held the role since 2016. Elaine Bedell was appointed as Chief Executive in 2017; from 2009 to 2016 that position was held by Alan Bishop, former chairman of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi International and Chief Executive of the Central Office of Information.

September 2005 saw the arrival of Jude Kelly as the centre&#x27;s Artistic Director. After Kelly stepped down in order to devote herself to the Women of the World Festival, Madani Younis (previously Artistic Director at the Bush Theatre) was appointed to the new role of Creative Director from January 2019, to work alongside Gillian Moore, the Director of Music, and Ralph Rugoff, Director of the Hayward Gallery. Younis resigned in October 2019.

The role of artistic director remained vacant until the appointment of the former creative director of Manchester International Festival, Mark Ball who took up his position at the Southbank in January 2022.

== History ==

=== 1950s ===

The history of Southbank Centre starts with the Festival of Britain, held in 1951. In what was described as &quot;a tonic for the nation&quot; by Herbert Morrison, the Labour Party government minister responsible for the event, the Festival of Britain aimed to demonstrate Britain’s recovery from World War II by showcasing the best in science, technology, arts and industrial design. It ran from May to September 1951, and by June the following year most of it had been dismantled, following the victory of Winston Churchill and the Conservative Party in the general election of 1951. The Royal Festival Hall is the only building from the Festival of Britain that survives.

=== 1960s ===
From 1962 to 1965, the Royal Festival Hall was extended towards the river and Waterloo station and refurbished. The London County Council (later, Greater London Council) decided in 1955 to build a second concert hall and an art gallery on the eastern part of the South Bank site previously occupied by a lead works and shot tower (and which had been earmarked as a site for the National Theatre). It was another 12 years before the Queen Elizabeth Hall and the linked Purcell Room opened to the public. Together, they were to be known as South Bank Concert Halls. In 1968, the Hayward opened, under direct management of the Arts Council. The new buildings had their main entrances at first floor level and were integrated into an extensive elevated concrete walkway system linked to the Royal Festival Hall and the Shell Centre. This vertical separation of pedestrian and vehicle traffic proved unpopular due to the difficulty pedestrians had in navigating through the complex, and the dark and under-used spaces at ground level below the walkways.

=== 1980s ===
Following abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986, the South Bank Board was formed to take over operational control of the concert halls. The following year, the South Bank Board took over the administrative running of the Hayward from the Arts Council. Collectively, the arts venues, along with Jubilee Gardens, became the South Bank Centre, responsible to Arts Council England as an independent arts institution (after transitional arrangements).

=== 1990s ===
The walkway on the east side of the RFH, running along Belvedere Road towards the Shell Centre was removed in 1999–2000, to restore ground level circulation. The Waterloo Site (the late 1960s buildings) has been the subject of various plans for modification or reconstruction, in particular a scheme developed by Richard Rogers in the mid-1990s which would have involved a great glass roof over the existing three buildings. This did not proceed due to the high degree of National Lottery funding required and likely high cost.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, a masterplan for the South Bank Centre site was produced. The main features were
*a new administration building for members of staff
*the removal of access for delivery vehicles to the south of the Hungerford Bridge approach viaduct and east of the Hayward (by Waterloo Bridge);
*the creation of three new public spaces around the RFH (Festival Riverside, Southbank Centre Square and Festival Terrace);
*modification of the Queen Elizabeth Hall undercroft and the lower two levels of the Hayward to provide a frontage onto Southbank Centre Square; and
*a new British Film Institute building partly underground on the Hungerford Car Park site.

In line with the plans, in 2006-7 a new glass-fronted building was created to provide office space for Southbank Centre staff as well as a range of new shops and restaurants. This was inserted between the RFH and the approach viaduct to Hungerford Bridge. New restaurants and shops along the low level Thames elevation of the Royal Festival Hall replaced an earlier cafeteria area and accompanied pedestrianisation of this frontage, achieved by removing the circulation road. Between 2005 and 2007 the Festival Hall auditorium was modified, the natural acoustic enhanced to meet classical music requirements. Seating was also reconfigured, together with upgrades to production facilities and public areas, with provision of new bar areas, the removal of most shops from foyer spaces, and refurbished lifts and WCs.

=== 2010s ===
In early 2013 the Southbank Centre unveiled plans, which soon became a source of vigorous debate, for alterations to the Hayward Gallery and Queen Elizabeth Hall dubbed the &quot;Festival Wing&quot;, funded by Arts Council England. The proposal would have provided arts spaces in a new high level L-shaped building linking the Hayward Gallery and Purcell Room buildings and with a wing running parallel to Waterloo Bridge behind the Queen Elizabeth Hall auditorium. Its features were to include a glass pavilion, new arts spaces, a literature centre, cafes and commercial units.

The proposed alterations would have replaced the skate park which has developed in the undercroft, hailed as the birthplace of British skateboarding, with retail units to fund the new arts spaces. By May 2014, the campaign group strongly opposing the proposals called Long Live Southbank had gained over 120,000 members. As well as the skateboarders, the National Theatre also had objections.

In early 2014, the scheme was put on hold when the Mayor of London, then Boris Johnson, said he would not support removal of the skateboarding area from the Queen Elizabeth Hall undercroft to under Hungerford Bridge. The development of the undercroft area was a key commercial and financing feature of the Festival Wing new building proposal and the scheme could not proceed in its proposed form without the commercial development or substitute funding which was not available in the amounts required.

====2018 refurbishment====

Arts Council England awarded a £16m grant towards a two-year programme of repairs and conservation work on the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Purcell Room and Hayward Gallery in May 2014 and the scheme was granted planning permission in May 2015. The Southbank Centre also received funding for the conservation and limited alteration scheme, known as &quot;Let the Light In&quot;, from the Heritage Lottery Fund and was raising funds from individuals for the final £3 million required.

This more conservation-orientated approach has also included joining with the National Trust to make the centre&#x27;s 1960s buildings&#x27; contribution to the Brutalist movement better known. The buildings re-opened in 2018 following completion of the works.

=== Response to 2020 pandemic ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which halted live performances and closed exhibitions, most of the centre&#x27;s 600 employees were furloughed, and in July 2020 up to 400 were expected to be made redundant. The Hayward Gallery reopened in August but the Royal Festival Hall and Queen Elizabeth Hall were expected to remain closed until April 2021.

<text>Adam de Brome (; died 16 June 1332) was an almoner to King Edward II and founder of Oriel College in Oxford, England. De Brome was probably the son of Thomas de Brome, taking his name from Brome near Eye in Suffolk; an inquisition held after the death of Edmund, 2nd Earl of Cornwall, in 1300, noted de Brome holding an inheritance of half a knight&#x27;s fee.

==Secular career==
The first records of de Brome are as a collector of food supplies in Dorset in 1297, in April 1298, he was in Ireland, from November 1299 was in charge of the assize of corn and wine and in the same year led troops from Yorkshire to Carlisle for a campaign in Scotland. In 1305 he was auditing accounts of the papal tithes, and in 1312 assessing tallage in the midlands. Early in Edward II&#x27;s reign, de Brome was one of the King&#x27;s Clerks of Chancery, he was twice ordered to take charge of the Bishop of Durham&#x27;s seals until its vacancy was filled. After 1311 he was given a variety of judicial offices, as justice of assize, commissioner of oyer and terminer, and as a justice dealing with crimes against the wool customs.

==Ecclesiastical career==
In the 14th century many royal officials were not directly paid, but instead were given the incomes of distant ecclesiastical properties that they rarely visited. De Brome may have been one of these, he had been ordained priest on 2 March 1301 and was admitted as rector of Wyck Rissington, Gloucestershire, three weeks later. He was appointed Master of God&#x27;s House, Dunwich, in 1306, and was, for a short time, rector of Bridford, Devon between 1311 and 1312, Handsworth, Yorkshire between 1313 and 1316, and of St Creed, Cornwall in 1314. He also held the posts of chancellor of Durham &quot;sede vacante&quot;, in 1311 and between 1316 and 1317, archdeacon of Stow, in the diocese of Lincoln in 1320, prebendary of Bathwick in Wherwell Abbey, Hampshire from 1314 until 1320, rector of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford from 1320 until 1326, warden of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, Oxford from 1326 until 1332, and rector sharing Eckington, Derbyshire from 1328 until 1332.

==Academic career==
On 28 April 1324, letters patent were issued by the King giving de Brome licence to found a college of Scholars, allowing him to hold in mortmain a messuage worth £30 a year for the &quot;students of divers sciences in the Virgin&#x27;s honour&quot;, to be governed by a rector elected by the scholars, the details of the government to be settled by de Brome himself. Before the year was out, de Brome had purchased two tenements in Oxford, Tackley&#x27;s Inn and Perilous Hall, the college, later called Oriel College, was declared to be for the study of theology and the &quot;ars dialectica&quot; and John de Laughton was appointed the first Rector.

On 1 January 1326, de Brome handed over the properties to the King, who, on 21 January, issued by letters patent a charter of foundation in his own name, the Rector was to be replaced with a Provost, de Brome was appointed the first Provost and the college re-endowed with Tackley&#x27;s Inn and Perilous Hall. Statutes issued in the King&#x27;s name by the Bishop of Lincoln, Henry Burghersh in May 1326 called for the provision of a common seal, to be kept in a box with three keys, one for the Provost and the other two to trusted Scholars, the seal depicts the Annunciation, with the figure of Adam de Brome kneeling below and the legend &quot;Sig.Comune Domus Scholarium Beate Marie Oxon&quot;. The statutes also stipulated daily services to be held in St Mary&#x27;s for the souls of the father and mother of Burghersh, the Bishop himself, his brother and sisters, the King and de Brome. Burghersh confirmed the appropriation of St Mary&#x27;s, and by 1 August 1326, de Brome had resigned its rectory into the hands of the college.

==Death==
De Brome died in June 1332 and was buried on the north side of St Mary&#x27;s Church, where, despite rebuilding, his tomb remains.

<text>George Raymond Dallas Moor, (22 October 1896 – 3 November 1918) was a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was awarded the Victoria Cross for stemming a rout by shooting four of his own soldiers during the Gallipoli campaign in 1915.

==Early life==
Moor was born 22 October 1896, in his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s home in Pollington Street, St Kilda, Australia. He was the son of William Henry Moor (Auditor-General, Transvaal, retired) and Mrs. Moor, and nephew of the late Sir Ralph Moor, formerly High Commissioner for Southern Nigeria. He was educated at Cheltenham College.

==First World War==
After briefly serving as a private in the 21st (Service) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, Moor was commissioned into the 3rd (Militia) Battalion of the Hampshire Regiment (later the Royal Hampshire Regiment) in October 1914, and was later granted a commission in the Regular Army on 1 August 1915. After six months&#x27; training in England and Egypt, he went with the 2nd Battalion of his regiment to the Dardanelles, and was at the landing at V Beach at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915.

His Victoria Cross was gazetted on 24 July 1915, when he was still only 18 years of age. The citation read:
Lieutenant General Sir Beauvoir de Lisle, in a narrative of Moor&#x27;s VC action, said, &quot;I have often quoted this young Officer as being one of the bravest men I have met in this War.&quot;

Moor was invalided home soon afterwards suffering from dysentery. After recovering he joined the 1st Battalion in France and was badly wounded in the arm. He returned to England, and before regaining the use of his arm was appointed Aide-de-Camp to Major General W. de L. Williams in France, where he gained the Military Cross and Bar. Moor was promoted lieutenant on 30 October 1916.

His Military Cross citation, gazetted 2 December 1918, reads:

The award of a Bar to his Military Cross was promulgated on 29 July 1919, reading:
Moor died of Spanish influenza at Mouvaux, France, on 3 November 1918. He is buried in the Y Farm Military Cemetery, Bois-Grenier, which is cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The inscription on his gravestone reads: . A copy of his VC is displayed at the Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum in Winchester, England.

<doc id="1187056" wikidata="Q316876" url="?curid=1187056" title="Guido Cavalcanti">
<text>Guido Cavalcanti (between 1250 and 1259 – August 1300) was an Italian poet. He was also a friend of and intellectual influence on Dante Alighieri.

==Historical background==

Cavalcanti was born in Florence at a time when the comune was beginning its economic, political, intellectual and artistic ascendancy as one of the leading cities of the Renaissance. The disunited Italian peninsula was dominated by a political particularism that pitted city-states against one another, often with this factionalism contributing to the fractious and sometimes violent political environments of each &quot;comune&quot;. The domination of medieval religious interpretations of reality, morality and society was challenged by the rise of a new urban culture across Europe that gradually supplanted rural, local, ecclesiastical and feudal ways of thinking. There was an accompanying return to study, and to interpretation and emulation of the classics, known as a revival of antiquity. New secular and humanistic views laid the foundations for modern life in Western Civilization. As Jacob Burckhardt, Swiss historian and author of &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot; wrote, &quot;It was not the revival of antiquity alone, but its union with the genius of the Italian people which achieved the conquest of the western world.&quot; In sum, Cavalcanti lived during and helped shape this time of great innovation that was spurred on by a desire to explore, create and experiment with new things.

==The politics of Florence==

Cavalcanti was the son of Cavalcante de&#x27; Cavalcanti, a Guelph whom Dante condemns to torment in the sixth circle of his Inferno, where the heretics are punished. Unlike Dante, Guido was an atheist. As Giovanni Boccaccio (Decameron, VI, 9) wrote during the generation after Cavalcanti&#x27;s death, &quot;Si diceva tralla gente volgare che queste sue speculazioni erano solo in cercare se trovar si potesse che Iddio non-fosse&quot; (People commonly said his speculations were only in trying to find that God did not exist).

During his lifetime, Florence was politically torn by the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, factions supporting, respectively, the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor in central and northern Italy during the 12th and 13th centuries. Although the struggle for power between the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire had originally arisen with the Investiture Conflict of the 11th century, it was subsequently fed by a desire of either the Papacy or Holy Roman Emperor either to share in or to control the economic boom that was taking place in the leading cities of northern Italy during this time.

The division between Guelphs and Ghibellines was especially important in Florence, although the two sides frequently rebelled against each other and took power in many of the other northern Italian cities as well. Essentially the two sides were now fighting either against German influence (in the case of the Guelphs), or against the temporal power of the Pope (in the case of the Ghibellines). In Florence and elsewhere the Guelphs usually included merchants and burghers, while the Ghibellines tended to be noblemen.

Towards the end of the 13th century, the Guelphs had secured their control of Florence through their multiple victories over the Ghibellines, including the battle at Benevento in 1266, and at Campaldino and Caprona in 1289. In 1267, as part of a political reconciliation, Guido married Beatrice, the daughter of Ghibelline party leader Farinata degli Uberti. Their marriage union proved unsuccessful, as the feuds between Guelph and Ghibelline families persisted.

By 1293, a rebellion of middle-class Florentine merchants toppled both sides of noble families. Nobles were then forbidden to claim public office, until 1295, when they were offered eligibility to join Florence&#x27;s guilds. As a member of the Cavalcanti family, Guido had claimed ancestry dating back to the German barons of Charlemagne&#x27;s court. He refused to occupy a position as a merchant, as he felt it offensive to his station and his heritage.

By this time, the Guelphs began to fight among themselves. Guido Cavalcanti allied himself to the Cerchi, and outwardly expressed his disdain for his rival, Corso Donati. In 1300, Florence was divided into the Black Guelphs and the White Guelphs. The Blacks continued to support the Papacy, while the Whites were opposed to Papal influence.

In June 1300, the Florentines had become tired of brawling between the Ghibellines and the Guelphs. A council of judges, Dante Alighieri amongst them, exiled the leaders of both factions and their accomplices, including Cavalcanti. He was sent to Sarzana, where, after only a few months he decided to try to return to Florence. Guido Cavalcanti died of fever (probably malaria) in August of the same year on his journey home.

Guido&#x27;s marriage to Beatrice degli Uberti should not be seen in the context of modern relationships where people marry each other for love, but rather in the context of his own age, when marriage was often motivated by business and/or political interests. As such, Guido&#x27;s poetry, which dwells on love, should be seen as a philosophical exploration of love and not as that of a husband bound into and seeking satisfaction outside a marriage made for political purposes.

==&quot;Dolce stil novo&quot;==
Cavalcanti was a part of the Tuscan poetic movement known as the &quot;dolce stil novo&quot; (Sweet New Style), whose members are referred to by their Tuscan name, the &quot;stilnovisti&quot;. The formative influences on the &quot;stilnovisti&quot; came from two main sources.

First, there was the poetry of the troubadour and trobairitz, who began the tradition of courtly love, known by its then contemporary term, as &quot;fin&#x27;amor&quot; in the ducal and princely courts of Aquitaine, Provence, Champagne and ducal Burgundy, at the end of the eleventh century. Based on the Occitan language of south France, this courtly poetry, which was a part of Occitan literature, spread throughout all European cultivated circles in the 12th and 13th centuries. (Many of its poets can be found here in this list of troubadours and trobairitz.)

Second, there was the poetry of the Sicilian School, which was a small community of Sicilian, and to a lesser extent, mainland Italian poets gathered around Frederick II, most of them belonging to his court, the Magna Curia. Headed by Giacomo da Lentini, they produced more than 300 poems of courtly love between 1230 and 1266, the experiment being continued after Frederick&#x27;s death by his son, Manfredi. This school included Enzio, king of Sardinia, Pier delle Vigne, Inghilfredi, Stefano Protonotaro, Guido and Odo delle Colonne, Rinaldo d&#x27;Aquino, Giacomino Pugliese, Arrigo Testa, Mazzeo Ricco, Perceval Doria, and Frederick II himself.

The poets of Stilnovismo included the early forerunner Guido Guinizelli, Guido Cavalcanti and Dante, plus Cino da Pistoia, Lapo Gianni, Gianni Alfani, and Dino Frescobaldi. Far from being a derivative school of poetry that mimicked its French and Sicilian poetic ancestors, Stilnovismo brought an originality to and completely transformed the poetry of courtly love in that: 1) It was an urban poetry of the Tuscan commune, not of an aristocratic court. 2) It explored the philosophical, spiritual, psychological and social effects of love. 3) It championed the Tuscan vernacular. 4) It did all this while expressing the heart and mind of the poet in original verse that utilized the sonnet, ballata and canzone forms of poetry. Cavalcanti was a central part of this accomplishment.

==Early poetry==

In one of his earlier poems, Guido transforms the imagery of &quot;fin&#x27;amor&quot;, with its beautiful ladies and armed knights, into an idea that love has a philosophical component related to human intelligence and moral purity by equating it with a wise heart. He then proceeds to create a series of images of nature&#x27;s serene beauty, which he then explains are all transcended by his lady&#x27;s beauty, grace and noble heart; i.e., her emotions that are pure, based on wisdom, something he is incapable of.
In this simple, but beautiful sonnet, we have, then, both something emblematic of the best poetry of the Dolce stil novo, while at the same an example of Cavalcanti&#x27;s poetic idiom that is at once powerful, persuasive and, here, mellifluous.

The crowning achievement of Cavalcanti&#x27;s poetic youth is his &quot;canzone&quot; &quot;Io non pensava che lo cor giammai&quot; in which he embodies his philosophical thoughts in a vernacular masterpiece. An analysis of two passages from this fifty-six-line poem reveals his core ideas on love.
Influenced by Averroës, the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher who commented on Aristotle, Cavalcanti saw humans with three basic capacities: the vegetative, which humans held in common with plants; the sensitive, which man shared with animals; and, the intellectual, which distinguished humans from the two lower forms. Averroës maintained that the proper goal of humanity was the cultivation of the intellect according to reason. Further, Averroës maintained that the intellect was part of a universal consciousness that came into the body at birth and returned to the universal consciousness after death. As such, it meant there was no afterlife, and, as well, the thing that gives an individual his or her identity was not the intellect, but the sensitive faculty, the appetites and desires of the body. Hence, the goal for Averroës and Cavalcanti was the perfection of the sensitive capacity through reason in order to achieve a balance between the body&#x27;s physical desires and the intellect. This balance was considered the &quot;buon perfetto&quot;, the &quot;good perfection.&quot; Guido thought this balance could not be achieved, which is why he speaks of “tormented laments” that makes his soul cry, that make his eyes dead, so he can feel “neither peace nor even rest in the place where I found love and my Lady.”
This passage explains the conflict between the sensitive and intellectual, as Guido&#x27;s heart shivers as his &quot;our lowly minds couldn&#x27;t sustain what our intellects saw.&quot; All this is driven by the lofty beauty of his lady.

==Poetic maturity==
Cavalcanti is best remembered for belonging to that small but influential group of Tuscan poets that started what is now known as Dolce Stil Novo, to which he contributed the following (note: translations provided in parentheses do not match the titles by which are widely known in English manuals but are meant to be a more literal rendering of the Italian originals): &quot;Rosa fresca novella&quot; (New, Fresh Rose), &quot;Avete in vo&#x27; li fior e la verdura&quot; (You Are Flowers in the Meadow), &quot;Biltà di donna&quot; (A Woman&#x27;s Beauty), Chi è questa che vèn (Who&#x27;s This Lady That Comes My Way), &quot;Li mie&#x27; foll&#x27;occhi&quot; (My Crazy Eyes), &quot;L&#x27;anima Mia&quot; (My Soul), &quot;Guido Orlandi&quot;, &quot;Da più a uno&quot; (From Many to One), &quot;In un boschetto&quot; (In A Grove), &quot;Per ch&#x27;io no spero&quot; (Because I Do Not Hope), &quot;Voi che per gli occhi mi passaste il core&quot; (see below), and &quot;Donna me prega&quot; (A Lady Asks Me), a masterpiece of lyric verse and a small treatise on his philosophy of love. Starting from the model provided by the French troubadours, they took Italian poetry a step further and inaugurated the &quot;volgare illustre&quot;, that higher standard of Italian language that survives almost unchanged to the present day. The founder of this school, Guido Guinizzelli, a law professor at Bologna&#x27;s University wrote the first poem of this kind, a poem whose importance does not so much lie in its literary merits but in outlining what would be the fundamentals of the Stil Novo program, which was further perfected by a second generation of poets, including Dante, Cino da Pistoia, Lapo Gianni, and Guido himself. As Dante wrote in his &quot;De Vulgari Eloquentia&quot;, I, XIII, 4:

&quot;Sed quanquam fere omne Tusci in suo turpiloquio sint obtusi, nunnullos vulgaris excellentiam cognovisse sentimus, scilicit Guidonem, Lapum, et unum alium, Florentinos et &quot;Cynum Pistoriensem&quot; (...) (&quot;Although most Tuscans are overwhelmed by their bad language, we judge that some have known the excellence of the vernacular, namely Guido, Lapo and another [i.e: Dante himself], all from Florence, and Cino da Pistoia&quot;.

Scholars have commented on the Dolce stil novo with Dante as probably the most spiritual and platonic in his portrayal of Beatrice (&quot;Vita Nuova&quot;), but Cino da Pistoia is able to write poetry in which &quot;there is a remarkable psychological interest in love, a more tangible presence of the woman, who loses the abstract aura of Guinizzelli and Guido&#x27;s verse&quot; (Giudice-Bruni), and Guido Cavalcanti interprets love as a source of torment and despair in the surrendering of self to the beloved. An example in kind, and one of Guido&#x27;s most widely read lyrics is a sonnet entitled &quot;Voi che per gli occhi mi passaste il core&quot; (Transl. &quot;You, Whose Look Pierced through My Heart&quot;), dedicated, to his beloved Monna (lady) Vanna:

Although there are many poems that exemplify Cavalcanti&#x27;s poetic maturity, &quot;Certe mie rime a te mandar vogliendo&quot; is unparalleled in its originality, for here Guido adapts his medium of love to speak of his inner psychological state and the uncertainty of Dante&#x27;s reaction in this example of occasional poetry. This is creativity at its highest, for Cavalcanti transforms the medium into a unique response to a real-world problem.
Guido tells Dante how desire, how &quot;wanting&quot; has ruined his heart. He dramatically reinforces his condition through the appearance of Love—the medieval and Renaissance view of Love as Cupid matured into a grown man—in the guise of death, as if Guido is indeed on the verge of leaving this world. Love then warns him not to send this poem to Dante, who is not ready to deal with Guido&#x27;s condition, given the depth of friendship Dante feels for him. Love also acknowledges that what he makes humanity suffer is &quot;unjust,&quot; In sum, because of the love he has felt in life, Guido is ruined, and because of the depth of friendship Dante holds for him, Guido fears he may be ruined as well, seeing him in such a state.

===Poetic masterpiece &quot;Donna me prega&quot;===

Through his study of Averroës, and perhaps due to his native temperament, Cavalcanti held the pessimistic view that humans were limited in the sort of ultimate attainment they could achieve. The intellect could never be brought into harmony based on reason with bodily desires.

The crowning achievement of Guido&#x27;s poetic career is his masterpiece, the philosophical canzone &quot;Donna me prega&quot; (A lady asks me). It is a full-fledged treatise of his personal thoughts and beliefs on love. Through it, he transforms all that came before him and influenced him: courtly love, the troubadours, the Sicilian School and his peers of the Dolce stil novo.

Guido says he was prompted to write it by his mistress, according to a formula very widespread in the tradition of love poetry. As such, Guido&#x27;s doctrine draws on the greatest medieval poets or scholars, such as Chrétien de Troyes and Brunetto Latini. There are several hints to the Roman de la Rose, then considered the &quot;Bible&quot; of courtly love. For example, in the famous line &quot;a man who does not experience it [love] cannot picture it&quot;, a common axiom variously quoted from the troubadours to Dante&#x27;s Vita Nuova. &quot;Donna me prega&quot;, a remarkable anatomy of love, is divided into five stanzas of fourteen variously rhymed lines of eleven syllables each. The subject is divided into eight chapters dealing with

#Where love is located in the human body 
#What causes it
#What his faculties (virtues) are
#His power (what it can do or cause)
#His essence (what it is made of)
#His motions (or alterations it causes in the human body or mind)
#What makes us call it love
#The possibility of probing its effects using our sight.

In short, the sensitive, like the rational soul is located in the brain, but does not produce love feelings unless the eyes meet those of a particular woman who has an exclusive affinity to him. This complies with Aristotle&#x27;s theory of cause and effect, whereby no effect can proceed from an object if the object has not the potential to accomplish it. When a woman&#x27;s look meets the eyes of a man, the potential for love grows into passion, a spirit or fluid that possesses all his faculties. Such a passion needs more and more love to satisfy its ever-growing appetite, until (when desire outstrips human limits) he is led to insanity and death.

This highly philosophical &quot;canzone&quot; was extremely influential, and it was commented upon by authors including Dino del Garbo, pseudo-Giles, Giles of Rome, Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Iacopo Mini, and Fracesco de Vieri (see Enrico Fenzi, &quot;La canzone d&#x27;amore di Guido Cavalcanti e i suoi antichi commenti&quot;, Melangolo, 1999).

While this has very little to do with modern psychology, Guido&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;spiritelli&quot; was part of the guiding principles of Arabic medicine, considered very advanced in Dante&#x27;s time. The merit of such philosophy in Cavalcanti&#x27;s verse is its ability to describe what goes through the poet&#x27;s mind in a very detailed, personal manner, creating sensuous, autobiographic poetry. This is revolutionary compared to the rhetoric and academic-seeming manner of the Sicilian and Neo-Sicilian Schools that had preceded the Dolce Stil Novo and, perhaps, a sign of the changing times.

== Mentions in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ==

Guido Cavalcanti indirectly appears twice in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. The first occurs in Inferno X, where Dante encounters the souls of heretics. They are condemned in the sixth circle of Hell, trapped inside burning tombs. Guido&#x27;s father, Cavalcante de’ Cavalcanti, is among these heretics, and proceeds to ask Dante about his son. Dante refers to Guido in the past tense, thus leading Cavalcante to believe that Guido is dead. Dante, later feeling guilty, asks Farinata degli Uberti, another heretic, to inform Cavalcante that Guido remains alive.

Guido&#x27;s name arrives once more in Purgatory XI, mentioned by Oderisi da Gubbio to Dante on the terrace of pride. The former employs the fame of Guido Guinizelli, soon overpowered by that of Guido Cavalcanti, to justify the fleeting nature of fame in their larger discussion of vanity. Through Oderisi&#x27;s words, Dante further asserts himself, as a poet, to be the next in line, replacing Guido in terms of public interest.

It has been suggested that Guido Cavalcanti&#x27;s presence in Dante&#x27;s Divine Comedy permeates further than Dante&#x27;s two mentions of him by name. His cynical beliefs towards the subject of desire, demonstrated in &quot;Donna me prega&quot; with images of wrath and death, have been proposed as inspiration for Dante&#x27;s &quot;contrapasso&quot; observed in Inferno V, where the carnal sinners are tossed uncontrollably by the winds of a never-ending storm. The difference between the two literary works, in their contexts, is in their treatment of love, since Guido believed that all love led to a loss of rationale. Dante, opposed to this belief, used Guido&#x27;s definition for a perverted love instead, within the circle of lust.

==Legacy==

Cavalcanti is widely regarded as the first major poet of Italian literature: Dante sees in Guido his mentor; his meter, his language deeply inspire his work (cfr. De Vulgari Eloquentia), though Guido&#x27;s esthetic materialism would be taken a step further to an entirely new spiritual, Christian vision of the gentler sex, as personified by Beatrice whose soul becomes Dante&#x27;s guide to Paradise.

Guido&#x27;s controversial personality and beliefs attracted the interest of Boccaccio, who made him one of the most famous heretical characters in his Decameron, helping popularise the belief about his atheism. Cavalcanti would be studied with perhaps more interest during the Renaissance, by such scholars as Luigi Pulci and Pico della Mirandola. By passing to Dante&#x27;s study of the Italian language, Guido&#x27;s style has influenced all those who, like cardinal Pietro Bembo, helped turn the &quot;volgare illustre&quot; into today&#x27;s Italian language.

Cavalcanti was to become a strong influence on a number of writers associated with the development of Modernist poetry in English. This influence can be traced back to the appearance, in 1861, of Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;The Early Italian Poets&quot;, which featured translations of works by both Cavalcanti and Dante.

The young Ezra Pound admired Rossetti and knew his Italian translations well, quoting extensively from them in his 1910 book &quot;The Spirit of Romance&quot;. In 1912, Pound published his own translations under the title &quot;The Sonnets and Ballate of Guido Cavalcanti&quot; and in 1932, he published the Italian poet&#x27;s works as &quot;Rime&quot;. A reworked translation of &quot;Donna me prega&quot; formed the bulk of Canto XXXVI in Pound&#x27;s long poem &quot;The Cantos&quot;. Pound&#x27;s main focus was on Cavalcanti&#x27;s philosophy of love and light, which he viewed as a continuing expression of a pagan, neo-platonic tradition stretching back through the troubadours and early medieval Latin lyrics to the world of pre-Christian polytheism. Pound also composed a three-act opera titled &quot;Cavalcanti&quot; at the request of Archie Harding, a producer at the BBC. Though never performed in his lifetime, excerpts are available on audio CD.

Pound&#x27;s friend and fellow modernist T. S. Eliot used an adaptation of the opening line of &quot;Perch&#x27;i&#x27; no spero di tornar giammai&quot; (&quot;Because I do not hope to turn again&quot;) to open his 1930 poem &quot;Ash Wednesday&quot;.

<doc id="1187057" wikidata="Q1218665" url="?curid=1187057" title="The Longest Yard (1974 film)">
<text>The Longest Yard is a 1974 American prison sports comedy-drama film directed by Robert Aldrich, written by Tracy Keenan Wynn, based on a story by producer Albert S. Ruddy, and starring Burt Reynolds, Eddie Albert, Ed Lauter, Michael Conrad and James Hampton. The film was released as The Mean Machine in the United Kingdom and South Africa. The film follows a former NFL player recruiting a group of prisoners and playing football against their guards. It features many real-life football players, including Ray Nitschke of the Green Bay Packers.

The film has spawned three remakes: the 2001 British film &quot;Mean Machine&quot; starring Vinnie Jones; 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; starring Adam Sandler and featuring Reynolds as coach Nate Scarborough; and the 2015 Egyptian film &quot;Captain Masr&quot;. In the two international remakes, the sport was changed from gridiron football to association football.

==Plot==
Former star pro football quarterback Paul &quot;Wrecking&quot; Crewe walks out on his wealthy girlfriend Melissa in Palm Beach, Florida. After taking her Citroën SM without permission and leading police on a car chase, and subsequent attack of two police officers, Crewe is sentenced to 18 months in Citrus State Prison.

The convicts disrespect Crewe because he was dismissed from the NFL for point shaving. The warden, Rudolph Hazen, is a football fanatic who manages a semi-pro team of prison guards. He wants Crewe to help coach the team and clinch a championship. Responding to pressure from the head guard and coach, Captain Wilhelm Knauer, a reluctant Crewe eventually agrees to play in an exhibition game. Crewe forms a prison team that includes Samson, a former professional weightlifter, and Connie Shokner, a killer and martial arts expert.

Aided by the clever Caretaker, former professional player Nate Scarboro and the first black inmate willing to play, &quot;Granny&quot; Granville, plus long-term prisoner Pop—and the warden&#x27;s amorous secretary, Miss Toot—Crewe molds a team nicknamed the &quot;Mean Machine&quot;. He agrees to play quarterback himself. After witnessing &quot;Granny&quot; being harassed by some of the prison guards without breaking, the black inmates decide to volunteer their services and join the team. Unger, one of the prison trustees, persistently asks Crewe if he can replace Caretaker as manager of the team, which Crewe refuses to do. In retaliation, Unger attempts to kill Crewe by fashioning a homemade bomb from a light bulb filled with a combustible fluid, designed to detonate inside Crewe&#x27;s cell when he turns on the light. Caretaker is killed instead when he enters Crewe&#x27;s cell to retrieve some papers; Unger locks the cell door, preventing rescue. Hazen sternly lectures Crewe&#x27;s teammates about the consequences of any attempted escape after the game. Afterward, Crewe re-energizes the team with a surprise—presenting them with professional uniforms (stolen from the guards by Caretaker before he was killed). They charge onto the field in their new uniforms, angering the guards and Hazen.

The &quot;Mean Machine&quot; starts out well, and at halftime the game is close: the guards lead 15–13. Hazen threatens Crewe as an accessory to Caretaker&#x27;s murder unless Crewe loses the game to the guards by at least 21 points. Crewe reluctantly agrees, but only if Hazen promises not to hurt the other prisoners; Hazen agrees &quot;once we have the 21 points&quot;, but he betrays him by telling Knauer to have his team &quot;inflict as much physical punishment on the prisoners as humanly possible&quot; as soon as they are ahead by 21 points. Knauer, certain that the guards would win, reluctantly complies. Crewe makes deliberate mistakes, putting the &quot;Mean Machine&quot; down by more than three touchdowns, 35–13, then takes himself out of the game. The guards gladly injure several of the prisoners, and Crewe&#x27;s teammates feel betrayed.

Depressed, Crewe asks Pop if it was worth punching Hazen (who was a guard when Pop was younger) and spending 30 years in prison; he says: &quot;Yes. For me it was&quot;. This rejuvenates Crewe. He goes back into the game, but the prisoners refuse to cooperate with him until he convinces them of his change of heart. The &quot;Mean Machine&quot; gets back into the game, trailing 35–30, one of their touchdowns scored by Nate despite his bad knee, and he is immediately cut down and crippled by guard Bogdanski. As he is wheeled off the field, Nate tells Crewe to &quot;screw Hazen&quot; and win the game. Crewe takes Bogdanski out of the game by twice throwing the ball with full force into Bogdanski&#x27;s genital area. Crewe scores the winning touchdown with no time left and the &quot;Mean Machine&quot; wins, 36–35.

As the prisoners celebrate, Crewe walks across the field towards the departing crowds. Hazen repeatedly orders Knauer to shoot him because he thinks Crewe is trying to escape. Knauer hesitates due to his newfound respect for Crewe, who is actually retrieving a football. Disgusted at what he almost did, Knauer hands the rifle back to Hazen saying, &quot;Game ball.&quot; Crewe returns to the crestfallen Hazen with the ball telling him, &quot;Stick this in your trophy case.&quot; Crewe walks into the stadium tunnel with Pop who says &quot;I knew you could do it!&quot;

==Cast==
==Production==
===Writing===
Producer Albert S. Ruddy wrote the story in the late 1960s. He got Tracy Keenan Wynn, who had written a television film about life in prison, &quot;The Glass House&quot; (1972), to write a script. Wynn signed in June 1972. Financing was raised through Paramount, which had released Ruddy&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;. Director Robert Aldrich says he took the third act of the film -- in which the main character falls from grace and tries to redeem himself -- from &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1947), a film on which Aldrich had worked as assistant director. Aldrich used a similar device on &quot;All the Marbles&quot; (1981).

Though the film was billed as being based on an original story, some reviewers found parallels between this film and the 1962 Hungarian film &quot;Two Half Times in Hell&quot;, which was based on a real-life association football game in 1942 between German soldiers and Ukrainian prisoners of war during World War II, known as the Death Match. The character of Paul &quot;Wrecking&quot; Crewe was also said to have been inspired by former college basketball and NBA All-Star player Jack Molinas, who was said to have shaved points for Columbia University during the CCNY point-shaving scandal period and for the Fort Wayne Pistons during his sole season in the NBA, as well as being a key figure in the 1961 NCAA University Division men&#x27;s basketball gambling scandal.

===Casting===
A number of the actors had previously played professional football. Henry played for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Los Angeles Rams. Kapp played quarterback for the Minnesota Vikings and in the Canadian Football League (1959–1966). Nitschke was a middle linebacker for the Green Bay Packers who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, four years after release, and Atkins played for the Los Angeles Rams, the Washington Redskins and the Oakland Raiders. Also appearing as prisoners are Wheelwright, who played with the New York Giants, Atlanta Falcons and the New Orleans Saints, and Ogden, who played with the St. Louis Cardinals, the New Orleans Saints, the Atlanta Falcons and the Chicago Bears. Sixkiller was a collegiate star as a quarterback for the University of Washington Huskies from 1970 to 1972, and briefly played pro in the defunct World Football League. Reynolds himself had played college football for Florida State University before injuries curtailed his career. There were a number of convicts used as players during filming.

===Filming===
The film was shot on location at Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Georgia. The production had the cooperation of then-Governor Jimmy Carter. Filming had to be delayed from time to time due to prison uprisings. There is now a museum that can be visited by appointment about the film and capital punishment in Georgia located in the prison&#x27;s former Death Row.

According to Reynolds, Aldrich knew comedy was &quot;not his strong suit&quot; so they would do a take as written then he would ask for a &quot;schtick take&quot; where Reynolds could &quot;clown around&quot;. Reynolds said the completed film used the schtick scenes about &quot;65% of the time&quot;.

Of Reynolds, Aldrich said &quot;on occasion he&#x27;s a much better actor than he&#x27;s given credit for. Not always: sometimes he acts like a caricature of himself. I thought he was very good in &quot;Longest Yard&quot;.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;The Longest Yard&quot; opened in New York on August 21, 1974. This was followed by a release in Los Angeles on September 25, 1974, followed by a general release in October 1974.

The film earned $22 million in North American theatrical rentals. It had admissions in France of 200,738.

==Reception==
The film holds a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Equal parts tough and funny, and led by a perfectly cast Burt Reynolds, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; has an interesting political subtext and an excellent climax – even if it takes too long to get there.&quot;

Nora Sayre of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;a terrible picture&quot; with prison guards that &quot;behave like leering sci-fi monsters&quot; and Reynolds doing a &quot;lumbering imitation&quot; of Marlon Brando in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; declared it &quot;an outstanding action drama, combining the brutish excitement of football competition with the brutalities of contemporary prison life. Burt Reynolds again asserts his genuine star power, here as a former football pro forced to field a team under blackmail of warden Eddie Albert.&quot; Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Reynolds was &quot;perfect in this brutal comic fantasy about a football game between crazily ruthless convicts and crazily ruthless guards; for all its bone-crunching collisions, the picture is almost irresistibly good-natured and funny.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that director Robert Aldrich &quot;is effective in portraying black inmates as a world apart in the prison system; it&#x27;s the one realistic element in this old-fashioned and brutal drama.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated, &quot;The story is both clever and unsubtle, the action riot-gun fast from start to satisfying finish, the characters vivid and boldly drawn, the jokes set up and paid off with old-pro efficiency: the bone-snapping, billy-club violence (of which there is inevitably a fair amount) is by Aldrich&#x27;s standards restrained and by any standards allowable.&quot; Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;It might seem morally imperative at this point to condemn with indignation what this movie is trying to do—stir up gut-level reactions at a mob-baiting level. And yet, however one may feel about that goal, it would be hard to deny that the movie achieves it.&quot;

&quot;MAD&quot; satirized this movie as &quot;The Longest Yardbird&quot; in issue #176 (July &#x27;75).

<text>The You Yangs are a series of granite ridges that rise up to above the flat and low-lying Werribee Plain in southern Victoria, Australia, approximately due west of the rural town of Little River, southwest of Melbourne CBD and north of Geelong. The main ridge runs roughly north-south for about , with a lower extension running for about to the west. Much of the southern section of the range is protected in You Yangs Regional Park.

The You Yangs sits about halfway between the Brisbane Ranges to the west and the nearest coast, at Corio Bay to the south-east. Although its highest point, Flinders Peak at the southern end, is only 319 m, the You Yangs dominate the surrounding landscape and are clearly identifiable from nearby Geelong, Melbourne and beyond.

The You Yangs are the site of a geoglyph of Bunjil, a Dreamtime creator deity to some of the Indigenous people of Victoria, depicted as an wedge-tailed eagle. The geoglyph was constructed by the Australian artist Andrew Rogers in recognition of the local Indigenous Wathaurong people. Unveiled in March 2006, the geoglyph has a wing span of 100 metres and 1500 tonnes of rock was used in its construction.

==History==
The name &quot;You Yang&quot; comes from the Aboriginal words &quot;Wurdi Youang&quot; or &quot;Ude Youang&quot; which could have any number of meanings from &quot;big mountain in the middle of a plain&quot;, &quot;big or large hill&quot;, or &quot;bald&quot;. The Woiwurrung word for granite stone &#x27;yow wong&#x27; is also a possibility. The Yawangi people enlarged natural hollows in the rocks to form wells that held water even in dry seasons. The area around the You Yangs was called &quot;Morong-morongoo&quot; after the murnong, or yam daisy, that was abundant there.

Explorer Matthew Flinders was the first European to visit the You Yangs. On 1 May 1802, he and three of his men climbed to the highest point. He named it &quot;Station Peak&quot; but the name was changed in 1912 to &quot;Flinders Peak&quot; in his honour.

The You Yangs have always attracted artists to paint them and feature most strongly in works by one of Australia&#x27;s greatest artists, Fred Williams. Williams spent long periods developing his &quot;plein air&quot; representations of the You Yangs, and they have now become classics of Australian art – rugged, dramatic, yet sparse in their imagery – unquestionably of the Australian bush.

The You Yangs were chosen to depict some battle scenes for the HBO World War II series &quot;The Pacific&quot;.

==Geography==
The nearest settlements include;
*Balliang - 5 km northwest
*Little River - 5 km east
*Lara - 7 km south
*Geelong - 31.5 km south
*Werribee - 37.5 km east

Two watercourses pass through or by the ranges: Hovells Creek originates in the western parts of the ranges, while Little River flows around the ranges to the north and east.

==Geology==
Contrary to popular belief, the You Yangs are not the remains of a volcano. They are an inselberg or monadnock, and the granite that forms them was originally a mass of magma that had worked its way up into the surrounding sedimentary rocks during the Devonian period, when the land surface in Victoria was several kilometres higher than today.

The magma crystallised before it reached the surface, so it did not produce any volcanic activity. Instead, a very slow cooling rate allowed many large white crystals of feldspar to form. These can be seen in many of the granite outcrops throughout the ranges. In places the crystals appear to be lined up, probably because the gooey magma was still moving around when they were growing. The rock enclosing the big feldspar crystals mainly contains crystals of greyish quartz and two black minerals (hornblende and a variety of mica known as biotite).

There are also some tiny crystals of two minerals, allanite and titanite, that contain radioactive elements such as uranium and thorium. Titanite crystals have been used to calculate that the You Yangs granite solidified 365 million years ago. In many places in the granite there are dark grey clots and lumps. These are called xenoliths and are foreign pieces of sedimentary rock that have been incorporated into the magma as it moved to the location at which it solidified.

The land surface has eroded over the millions of years since the granite solidified, leaving it exposed. Because granite is a hard rock, it has resisted erosion better than the rocks that surrounded it. The size and shape of the rounded tors are controlled by fractures in the granite that resulted from slight shrinkage during cooling. Weathering and erosion of the granite has formed a blanket of sandy soil that covers any contacts with surrounding rocks.

==Climate, vegetation and wildlife==
Owing to the rain shadow created by the Otway Ranges to the south-west, the You Yangs are in the driest part of Victoria south of the Great Dividing Range. Annual rainfall is as little as , with the result that the natural vegetation is grassland or low woodland rather than forest.

River red gum (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;) is the dominant native tree on the low slopes and gullies, yellow gum (&quot;E. leucoxylon&quot;) grows widely throughout the low and middle slopes, and blue gum (&quot;E. pseudoglobulus&quot;) grows on the rugged upper slopes. Other native trees in the park include red box (&quot;E. polyanthemos&quot;), grey box (&quot;E. microcarpa&quot;) &amp; yellow box (&quot;E. melliodora&quot;), manna gum (&quot;E. viminalis&quot;), red ironbark (&quot;E. tricarpa&quot;), cherry ballart (&quot;Exocarpos cupressiformis&quot;), and silver and black wattle (&quot;Acacia dealbata&quot; and &quot;A.mearnsii&quot;). Native low vegetation is sparse and dominated by grasses and saltbushes, with some scrubby areas of snowy mintbush (&quot;Prostanthera nivea&quot;) and drooping cassinia (&quot;Cassinia arcuata&quot;).

Many introduced plants occur in the You Yangs, some planted deliberately for forestry, including sugar gum (&quot;E. cladocalyx&quot;), swamp yate (&quot;E. occidentalis&quot;) and brown mallet (&quot;E. astringens&quot;), and others that have been introduced accidentally or have invaded the area, for example, boneseed (&quot;Chyrsanthemoides monilifera&quot;) and bridal creeper (&quot;Asparagus asparagoides&quot;).

The You Yangs are home to more than 200 bird species such as tawny frogmouths, white-naped, white-plumed, New Holland and brown-headed honeyeaters, kookaburras, white-winged choughs, crested shriketits, eastern rosellas, crimson rosellas, purple-crowned lorikeets, sulphur-crested cockatoos, eastern yellow robins, jacky winters and scarlet robins.

Mammals living in the park include eastern grey kangaroos, echidnas, swamp wallabies, sugar gliders, brushtail and ringtail possums, and koalas.

Koalas in the You Yangs have been studied since 2006. In approximately 28% of the Park they are monitored by a non-intrusive system of nose pattern identification. The entire population was considered to number around 105 in 2017, down 35% from estimated 161 in 2007. The population has been recorded to prefer to roost in river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis): 34% of sightings occur in that species. Four generations of one koala family have been recorded.

The nearby Serendip Sanctuary, a Victorian government wildlife research centre, open to the public, has been involved in breeding endangered Victorian wildlife species, such as the Australian bustard and the brolga (&quot;Antigone rubicundus&quot;).

== Outdoor activities ==
The foothills to the north of the peaks are home to Ford Australia&#x27;s You Yangs Proving Ground and the Sporting Shooters&#x27; Association of Australia&#x27;s Eagle Park shooting range. There is also a paintball facility next to the SSAA range that is open to both adults and young people.

Camping is not permitted in the You Yangs, although picnics are allowed. Hiking is popular, and the Mountain to Mouth (M~M) event is a bi-annual two-day art walk starting from the You Yangs and heading for the Barwon River mouth in Geelong, celebrating the contemporary song lines of the Wadawurrung people and recognising their land and traditions. Autumn and winter are also considered the perfect mountain biking and horse riding conditions, because the increased rainfall makes the trails less dusty and the soil firmer, making it more suitable for riding.

The You Yangs is home to a free 5 km parkrun event. You Yangs parkrun starts at 8am every Saturday near the Kurrajong Plantation car park. Permanent signage marks the 5 km loop course for use at any time.

<text>Jan de Bont (; born 22 October 1943) is a Dutch former cinematographer, film director, and film producer. He is best known for directing the action films &quot;Speed&quot; (1994) and &quot;Twister&quot; (1996). As a director of photography, de Bont also worked on numerous blockbusters and genre films, including &quot;Roar&quot; (1981), &quot;Cujo&quot; (1983), &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (1985), &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988), &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990), &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot; (1992), and &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992).

==Early life and career==
De Bont was born to a Roman Catholic family in Eindhoven, Netherlands, one of 17 children. His earliest works were made while studying at the Amsterdam Film Academy with Dutch avant-garde director Adriaan Ditvoorst. He first became known in the Netherlands as the cinematographer for the infamous 1971 film &quot;Blue Movie&quot;, followed by the 1973 film &quot;Turkish Delight&quot; (1973), directed by Paul Verhoeven, starring Rutger Hauer and Monique van de Ven. Since the early 1980s, he has worked frequently in Hollywood, often collaborating with directors including Verhoeven and John McTiernan.

While serving as cinematographer for the 1981 film &quot;Roar&quot;, de Bont experienced one of many on-set injuries during filming, when a lion lifted his scalp, requiring 220 stitches. After &quot;Roar&quot;, de Bont shot the 1983 horror film &quot;Cujo&quot;, an adaptation of the Stephen King novel of the same name.

In 1988, he was director of photography on the critically acclaimed action film &quot;Die Hard&quot;. The following year, de Bont shot the Ridley Scott-directed action thriller &quot;Black Rain&quot;.

==Directing==
De Bont made his directorial debut with the action thriller &quot;Speed&quot; in 1994, which was a sleeper hit. He followed this up with the even more successful &quot;Twister&quot; in 1996. His output since has had mixed commercial and critical success. In 1997, he returned to direct the sequel&quot; Speed 2: Cruise Control&quot;, which was a commercial and critical failure. In 1999, he oversaw the commercially successful remake of &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which received generally negative reviews from critics at the time. His most recent directorial outing was the 2003 action adventure film &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life&quot;, based on the video game series of the same name, and starring Angelina Jolie as the eponymous Lara Croft.

===Unrealised projects===

De Bont began pre-production on an American &quot;Godzilla&quot; film for a summer 1996 release, but quit at the end of 1994 when Sony Pictures Entertainment (Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures&#x27;s parent company) refused to approve his budget request. He was eventually replaced by Roland Emmerich, who rewrote the script in addition to directing. While critically panned, Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; was moderately successful at the box-office.

In 1997, de Bont was originally attached to direct the film &quot;Minority Report&quot;, which Steven Spielberg would end up directing instead.

In 1998 he was developing to produce and direct the action film &quot;Pathfinder&quot; for Paramount Pictures.

In 1999 it was announced that he would direct &quot;The Adaptive Ultimate&quot; for 20th Century Fox, with Nicole Kidman attached to star but her schedule was too busy to commit at the time.

In 2000, de Bont was considering directing either &quot;Adventures of the Stainless Steel Rat&quot;, &quot;Food&quot;, &quot;LAX&quot;, or &quot;The 28th Amendment&quot; as his next film. None of the projects were produced, though the latter was reportedly further developed with Artists Production Group for Warner Bros.

More recently, de Bont was attached as the director of an early version of &quot;The Meg&quot;, the &quot;Point Break&quot; sequel &quot;Indo&quot;, the live action &quot;Mulan&quot;, which would have starred Zhang Ziyi, as well as a proposed remake of 1961&#x27;s &quot;Five Minutes to Live&quot; written by Raul Inglis.

De Bont&#x27;s passion project, a film titled &quot;Riders in the Sky&quot;, about Indian tribes in the Midwest has been stuck in development hell for many years. &quot;It was a beautiful story, very imaginative,&quot; said de Bont. The project went as far as locations having already been scouted and the sets designed, before being cancelled.

==Personal life==
He was married to Dutch actress Monique van de Ven from 1973 to 1988. Monique starred in the 1973 film &quot;Turkish Delight&quot;, for which de Bont did the cinematography. De Bont has two children from his second marriage with Trish Reeves. He is an avid collector of photographic prints from noted photographers, having hundreds of them in his house.

<doc id="1187068" wikidata="Q3915918" url="?curid=1187068" title="Weyto language">
<text>Weyto (also called Wayto) is a speculative extinct language thought to have been spoken in the Lake Tana region of Ethiopia by the Weyto, a small group of hippopotamus hunters who now speak Amharic. 

The Weyto language was first mentioned by the Scottish traveler James Bruce, who spoke Amharic. Bruce passed through the area about 1770 and reported that &quot;the Weyto speak a language radically different from any of those in Abyssinia,&quot; but was unable to obtain any &quot;certain information&quot; on it, despite prevailing upon the king to send for two Weyto men for him to ask questions, which they would &quot;neither answer nor understand&quot; even when threatened with hanging. 

The next European to report on the Weyto, Eugen Mittwoch, described them as uniformly speaking a dialect of Amharic (Mittwoch 1907). This report was confirmed by Marcel Griaule when he passed through in 1928, although he added that at one point a Weyto sang an unrecorded song &quot;in the dead language of the Wohitos&quot; whose meaning the singer himself did not understand, except for a handful of words for hippopotamus body parts which, he says, had remained in use. 

This Amharic dialect is described by Marcel Cohen (1939) as featuring a fair number of words derived from Amharic roots but twisted in sound or meaning in order to confuse outsiders, making it a sort of argot. In addition, the dialect had a small number of Cushitic loanwords not found in standard Amharic, and a large number of Arabic loanwords mainly related to Islam. Of the substantial wordlist collected by Griaule, Cohen only considered six terms to be etymologically obscure: &quot;šəlkərít&quot; &quot;fish-scale&quot;, &quot;qəntat&quot; &quot;wing&quot;, &quot;čəgəmbit&quot; &quot;mosquito&quot;, &quot;annessa&quot; &quot;shoulder&quot;, &quot;ənkies&quot; &quot;hippopotamus thigh&quot;, &quot;wazəməs&quot; &quot;hippopotamus spine.&quot; By 1965, the visiting anthropologist Frederick Gamst found &quot;no surviving native words, not even relating to their hunting and fishing work tasks.&quot; (Gamst 1965.)

The paucity of the data available has not prevented speculation on the classification of their original language. Cohen suggested that it might have been either an Agaw language or a non-Amharic Semitic language, while Dimmendaal (1989) says it &quot;probably belonged to Cushitic&quot; (as does Agaw), and Gamst (1965) says &quot;...it can be assumed that if the Wäyto did not speak Amharic 200 years ago, their language must have been Agäw...&quot; According to the Ethnologue, Bender &quot;et al.&quot; (1976) saw it as Cushitic, while Bender 1983 saw it as either Eastern Sudanic or Awngi. It thus effectively remains unclassified, largely for lack of data, but possibly related to Agaw.

<text>Dorothy Otnow Lewis is an American psychiatrist and author who has been an expert witness at a number of high-profile cases.

She specializes in the study of violent individuals and people with dissociative identity disorder (DID), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. Lewis has worked with death row inmates as well as other prison inmates convicted for crimes of passion and violence, and was the director of the DID clinic at Bellevue Hospital, associated with New York University in New York City. She is a professor of psychiatry at Yale and New York University and is the author of &quot;Guilty by Reason of Insanity&quot;, a book she wrote based on research done in collaboration with neurologist Jonathan Pincus.

==Education and personal life==
Lewis, born in 1938, is a graduate of the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Radcliffe College and Yale University School of Medicine. This was an unusual achievement for a woman of her generation. She has stated in one of her books she originally went to medical school intending to become a psychoanalyst.

She was married to Melvin Lewis, a child psychiatrist and professor at Yale, who died in 2007. She has two children.

==Research==
During her research Lewis concluded that most, if not all, of the inmates she worked with had been abused as children or had experienced or witnessed potentially traumatic events, including violence. She found that in most cases both the accused and the family members have been reluctant to discuss the abuse that happened in the past; in many cases she concluded that the inmates had blocked out the memories. In some cases she was able to find testimony to this abuse as well as corroborating evidence. The corroborating evidence often included scars said to be from the abuse, as well as hospital and criminal records potentially related to abuse. In many cases, the hospital records of the abuse were attributed to other causes, often accidents; the explanations often did not match the injuries according to Lewis, however. She also found that the parents of these children often had the same problems as the children and concluded that they taught their behavior to the children. She argued that they often relied on excessive force to discipline their children and used it inconsistently, and that in many cases the children who received the strictest discipline became the most violent. In some cases these children found that if they told other adults about the abuse, which in some cases was very extreme, they found that adults didn&#x27;t believe them because the stories were too bizarre.

However, other experts, such as forensic psychologist Barbara R. Kirwin, question Lewis&#x27; uses of small samples without control groups, and her own findings indicate a far lower estimate of how many murderers were abused as children.

Lewis in fact focused on several possible antecedents of violence, and summed up her conclusions in 1998: &quot;What brain damage does is it increases emotional lability, impulsiveness, poor judgment. But most brain-damaged people are not violent. And psychoses, even paranoia ... even paranoid schizophrenia does not usually create violence. Most people with this disorder are not violent. And probably abuse alone does not create a grotesquely violent individual. However, when you put these together brain dysfunction, a tendency to paranoia and early on-going horrendous abuse and violence, you get a recipe for violence.&quot; Lewis has also highlighted the role of extremes of mood such as major depression and mania or even hypomania (including swings between them as found in the bipolar spectrum, previously known as manic depressive psychosis), and dissociative identity states (formerly multiple personality disorder, that Lewis originally doubted the existence of).

==Trial work==
Lewis has assessed and/or testified for the defense on several high-profile criminal cases, including Mark David Chapman, Joel Rifkin, David Wilson (Louisiana) and Marie Moore (New Jersey), Joseph Paul Franklin, Ted Bundy and Arthur Shawcross. She most recently testified as an expert witness for the defense in CO vs. Letecia Stauch for the disappearance and murder of Gannon Stauch in May 2023. Her testimony mainly benefitted the prosecution, however. The jury did not find her testimony to be credible and Stauch was found guilty on all four charges. 

In the Shawcross case, Lewis was the subject of some controversy. The first defense psychiatrist had concluded there was no insanity defense feasible for Shawcross, but Lewis reported diagnoses of post-traumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, brain damage, and psychomotor epilepsy. However, the prosecution took her case apart and it appeared that she had obtained some of her interview material from Shawcross by hypnosis, conducted without proper procedures for protecting against leading questions and false memories. In turn Lewis criticized the defense team for failing to obtain further brain studies to verify diagnoses of epilepsy and brain damage. She questioned the ethics of a prominent neurologist who was sent a brain scan by the defense and who ended up using the brain scan to testify for the prosecution. While Lewis stated that her long-term colleague Pincus found evidence of a temporal lobe cyst, frontal lobe scarring and electroencephalogram spiking, other neurologists found no evidence of abnormal ECG readings or any witnessed seizure, and concluded his neurology was within normal limits. Over the course of the trial Lewis became the focus of some public ridicule for her rambling style, and afterwards some of the jurors said she had damaged the defense case. Lewis has proposed a conspiracy theory to explain why she may have been deliberately undermined, based on the prosecutor sharing the same rare name as a former CIA operative and the possibility that her questioning of Shawcross&#x27;s army days might have risked revealing he had been put through MKUltra-type brainwashing experiments.

Lewis was also hired by the defense for the Washington Beltway Sniper John Allen Muhammad and assessed his mental state. Her report concluded that he had psychotic schizo-affective disorder and had brain dysfunction. Lewis, along with a &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist who reported an interview with her prior to Muhammad&#x27;s capture, has been criticized by the head of the American Psychiatric Association and National Alliance on Mental Illness for having asserted that the man is &quot;clearly psychotic&quot; and probably manic. Lewis defended her media work and referred to another article that said she was one of the few to have gotten it right; however, for that &quot;Newsweek&quot; article she was quoted: &quot;He may be talking nonsense, but that doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s delusional.&quot;

==Views on justice and death penalty==

Lewis is skeptical of the death penalty, but not necessarily the sentencing of inmates to life in order to protect the public. Neither Lewis nor Pincus believe the death penalty works as a deterrent. Lewis believes that the quest for justice often leads many prosecutors, judges, jurors to overlook things that could be considered mitigating circumstances. She believes that this leads to overlooking the root causes of crime and prevents long-term solutions that will help reduce child abuse and prevent more abused children from becoming killers.

==Play plagiarism accusation==

In 2004 Lewis alleged that British playwright Bryony Lavery&#x27;s hit Broadway play &quot;Frozen&quot;, particularly the character of &#x27;Agnetha&#x27;, a psychiatrist sent to evaluate a serial killer, was based on thematic similarities with her book &quot;Guilty by Reason of Insanity&quot; and verbatim extracts from a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article about her by Malcolm Gladwell. Lewis hired a lawyer and began preparing for a lawsuit, including getting Gladwell to sign his copyright over to her for her case. The story was covered internationally in 2004 and Lavery states it has damaged her career. However, Gladwell himself has since said he was not comfortable signing over his copyright to Lewis (and did change his mind) and, while understanding that she was upset, suggests that the legal accusations were fueled by a lack of appreciation of the creative arts.

==Movie==

In 2020 Lewis&#x27; work on the psychology of murders was portrayed in the documentary film Crazy, Not Insane by Alex Gibney.
