<text>In computer graphics, level of detail (LOD) refers to the complexity of a 3D model representation. LOD can be decreased as the model moves away from the viewer or according to other metrics such as object importance, viewpoint-relative speed or position.
LOD techniques increase the efficiency of rendering by decreasing the workload on graphics pipeline stages, usually vertex transformations.
The reduced visual quality of the model is often unnoticed because of the small effect on object appearance when distant or moving fast.

Although most of the time LOD is applied to geometry detail only, the basic concept can be generalized. Recently, LOD techniques also included shader management to keep control of pixel complexity.
A form of level of detail management has been applied to texture maps for years, under the name of mipmapping, also providing higher rendering quality.

It is commonplace to say that &quot;an object has been &quot;LOD-ed&quot;&quot; when the object is simplified by the underlying &quot;LOD-ing algorithm&quot; as well as a 3D modeler manually creating LOD models.

==Historical reference==

The origin of all the LOD algorithms for 3D computer graphics can be traced back to an article by James H. Clark in the October 1976 issue of &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;.
At the time, computers were monolithic and rare, and graphics were being driven by researchers. The hardware itself was completely different, both architecturally and performance-wise. As such, many differences could be observed with regard to today&#x27;s algorithms but also many common points.

The original algorithm presented a much more generic approach to what will be discussed here. After introducing some available algorithms for geometry management, it is stated that most fruitful gains came from &quot;...structuring the environments being rendered&quot;, allowing to exploit faster transformations and clipping operations.

The same environment structuring is now proposed as a way to control varying detail thus avoiding unnecessary computations, yet delivering adequate visual quality:
The proposed algorithm envisions a tree data structure which encodes in its arcs both transformations and transitions to more detailed objects. In this way, each node encodes an object and according to a fast heuristic, the tree is descended to the leaves which provide each object with more detail. When a leaf is reached, other methods could be used when higher detail is needed, such as Catmull&#x27;s recursive subdivision.

The paper then introduces clipping (not to be confused with culling although often similar), various considerations on the &quot;graphical working set&quot; and its impact on performance, interactions between the proposed algorithm and others to improve rendering speed.

==Well known approaches==
Although the algorithm introduced above covers a whole range of level of detail management techniques, real world applications usually employ specialized methods tailored to the information being rendered. Depending on the requirements of the situation, two main methods are used:

The first method, Discrete Levels of Detail (DLOD), involves creating multiple, discrete versions of the original geometry with decreased levels of geometric detail. At runtime, the full-detail models are substituted for the models with reduced detail as necessary. Due to the discrete nature of the levels, there may be visual popping when one model is exchanged for another. This may be mitigated by alpha blending or morphing between states during the transition.

The second method, Continuous Levels of Detail (CLOD), uses a structure which contains a continuously variable spectrum of geometric detail. The structure can then be probed to smoothly choose the appropriate level of detail required for the situation. A significant advantage of this technique is the ability to locally vary the detail; for instance, the side of a large object nearer to the view may be presented in high detail, while simultaneously reducing the detail on its distant side.

In both cases, LODs are chosen based on some heuristic which is used to judge how much detail is being lost by the reduction in detail, such as by evaluation of the LOD&#x27;s geometric error relative to the full-detail model. Objects are then displayed with the minimum amount of detail required to satisfy the heuristic, which is designed to minimize geometric detail as much as possible to maximize performance while maintaining an acceptable level of visual quality.

===Details on discrete LOD===

The basic concept of discrete LOD (DLOD) is to provide various models to represent the same object. Obtaining those models requires an external algorithm which is often non-trivial and subject of many polygon reduction techniques. Successive LOD-ing algorithms will simply assume those models are available.

DLOD algorithms are often used in performance-intensive applications with small data sets which can easily fit in memory. Although out-of-core algorithms could be used, the information granularity is not well suited to this kind of application. This kind of algorithm is usually easier to get working, providing both faster performance and lower CPU usage because of the few operations involved.

DLOD methods are often used for &quot;stand-alone&quot; moving objects, possibly including complex animation methods. A different approach is used for geomipmapping, a popular terrain rendering algorithm because this applies to terrain meshes which are both graphically and topologically different from &quot;object&quot; meshes. Instead of computing an error and simplify the mesh according to this, geomipmapping takes a fixed reduction method, evaluates the error introduced and computes a distance at which the error is acceptable. Although straightforward, the algorithm provides decent performance.

===A discrete LOD example===

As a simple example, consider a sphere. A discrete LOD approach would cache a certain number of models to be used at different distances. Because the model can trivially be procedurally generated by its mathematical formulation, using a different number of sample points distributed on the surface is sufficient to generate the various models required. This pass is not a LOD-ing algorithm.

To simulate a realistic transform bound scenario, an ad-hoc written application can be used. The use of simple algorithms and minimum fragment operations ensures that CPU bounding does not occur. Each frame, the program will compute each sphere&#x27;s distance and choose a model from a pool according to this information. To easily show the concept, the distance at which each model is used is hard coded in the source. A more involved method would compute adequate models according to the usage distance chosen.

OpenGL is used for rendering due to its high efficiency in managing small batches, storing each model in a display list thus avoiding communication overheads. Additional vertex load is given by applying two directional light sources ideally located infinitely far away.

The following table compares the performance of LOD aware rendering and a full detail (&quot;brute force&quot;) method.

===Hierarchical LOD===
Because hardware is geared towards large amounts of detail, rendering low polygon objects may score sub-optimal performances. HLOD avoids the problem by grouping different objects together. This allows for higher efficiency as well as taking advantage of proximity considerations.

==Practical applications==

===Video games===
LOD is especially useful in 3D video games. Video game developers want to provide players with large worlds but are always constrained by hardware, frame rate and the real-time nature of video game graphics. With the advent of 3D games in the 1990s, a lot of video games simply did not render distant structures or objects. Only nearby objects would be rendered and more distant parts would gradually fade, essentially implementing distance fog. Video games using LOD rendering avoid this fog effect and can render larger areas. Some notable early examples of LOD rendering in 3D video games include &quot;The Killing Cloud&quot;, &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, &quot;Crash Bandicoot: Warped&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; and the &quot;Serious Sam&quot; engine. Most modern 3D games use a combination of LOD rendering techniques, using different models for large structures and distance culling for environment details like grass and trees. The effect is sometimes still noticeable, for example when the player character flies over the virtual terrain or uses a sniper scope for long distance viewing. Especially grass and foliage will seem to pop-up when getting closer, also known as foliage culling. LOD can also be used to render fractal terrain in real time. Unreal Engine 5&#x27;s &quot;Nanite&quot; system essentially implements level-of-detail within meshes instead of just objects as a whole.

===In GIS and 3D city modelling===
LOD is found in GIS and 3D city models as a similar concept. It indicates how thoroughly real-world features have been mapped and how much the model adheres to its real-world counterpart. Besides the geometric complexity, other metrics such as spatio-semantic coherence, resolution of the texture and attributes can be considered in the LOD of a model.
The standard CityGML contains one of the most prominent LOD categorizations.

The analogy of &quot;LOD-ing&quot; in GIS is referred to as generalization.

<text>The 1968 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate. Held on November 5, the 34 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections. They coincided with the presidential election of the same year. The Republicans picked up five net seats in the Senate. This saw Republicans win a Senate seat in Florida for the first time since Reconstruction.

Republicans would gain another seat after the election when Alaska Republican Ted Stevens was appointed to replace Democrat Bob Bartlett, reducing Democrats&#x27; majority to 57–43.

This is the earliest round of Senate elections in which a first-elected member is still alive (Bob Packwood, R-OR).

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
Three Republicans and three Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election.

===Defeats===
One Republican and seven Democrats sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election.

===Post-election changes===
One Democrat died on December 11, 1968, and a Republican was appointed on December 24, 1968.

== Change in composition ==

After the September 10, 1968 appointment in New York.

=== After the general elections ===
=== Beginning of the next Congress ===

== Race summary ==
=== Elections leading to the next Congress ===
In these general elections, the winners were elected for the term beginning January 3, 1969; ordered by state.

All of the elections involved the Class 3 seats.

== Closest races ==
Fifteen races had a margin of victory under 10%:

Arkansas was the tipping point state with a margin of 18.3%.

== Alabama ==


After electing Republicans post-Reconstruction, Alabama had historically voted Democratic in local, state, and presidential elections from the 1870s until the 1960s with the passage of the Civil Rights Act. However, in 1948 Alabama did not support the Democratic ticket for the first time in nearly 100 years, voting for Strom Thurmond, who ran a third-party campaign. Democrats lost ground due to the unpopularity of the Civil Rights Act among white voters, who at the time comprised nearly the entire electorate. In 1964, Barry Goldwater became the first Republican to win the state of Alabama since Ulysses Grant, while the state elected Republicans to its congressional delegation for the first time since the turn of the century. Goldwater voted against the Civil Rights Act, which boosted his popularity in Southern states.

In 1962, J. Lister Hill ran for re-election to this seat to a fifth term but faced an unusually close race against Republican James D. Martin, who came within 1% of unseating the incumbent. In 1968, Republicans looked to build upon their momentum but faced a challenge when Lieutenant Governor James B. Allen, a staunch conservative, was nominated by the Democratic Party. Republicans also failed to capitalize on the candidacy of liberal Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey due to the third-party candidacy of Governor George Wallace limiting Republican support. Allen defeated Republican Perry Hooper by a wide margin in the general election and faced little opposition in 1978.



== Alaska ==

Democrat Ernest Gruening had served as one of the state&#x27;s inaugural senators alongside Democrat Bob Bartlett since 1959. He was re-elected in a landslide victory in 1962. In 1968, he was challenged by former Speaker of the Alaska House of Representatives, Mike Gravel, who ran on a campaign of youth. Gravel upset Gruening in the Democratic primary with just under 53% of the vote to 47% for Gruening.

Gravel faced former Anchorage Mayor Republican Elmer E. Rasmuson in the general election, while Gruening ran a write-in campaign. Gravel won a three-way race with 45% of the vote to 37% for Rasmuson, with incumbent Gruening scoring 17%. 


Two months after the election, on December 11, 1968, the other Alaskan senator, Democrat Bob Bartlett, died. Republican Ted Stevens, who lost the Republican primary to Rasmuson for this seat, was then appointed to that other seat.
== Arizona ==

Incumbent Democrat Carl Hayden did not run for re-election to an eighth term, with his long-time staff member Roy Elson running as the Democratic Party nominee to replace him. Elson beat State Treasurer of Arizona Bob Kennedy in the primary.


Elson was defeated by a wide margin, however, by former U.S. senator and Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater. Prior to Goldwater&#x27;s election, the seat had been held for decades by the Democratic Party under Carl Hayden, and would remain under Republican Party control until 2020. Elson had previously challenged U.S. senator Paul Fannin in 1964, when Goldwater vacated his seat to run for President against Lyndon B. Johnson.




== Arkansas ==


J. William Fulbright was first elected in 1944 against token Republican opposition. He ran unopposed in 1950 and won by large margins in 1956 and 1962, but he saw his vote percentage slip in the latter. In the wake of Civil Rights legislation, which many southern whites opposed, Fulbright was re-elected in 1968 but by the smallest margin of his career. He faced Charles T. Bernard and won with just over 59% of the vote. Arkansas would not elect a Republican to this seat until 2010 with John Boozman&#x27;s election.




== California ==
California was generally considered to be a Republican stronghold throughout the early 1900s. Until 1959, Republicans controlled most government offices as well as both houses of state government. However, Pat Brown was elected governor in 1958 and ushered in a wave of Democratic success.

Along with California Secretary of State Frank M. Jordan, incumbent U.S. Senator Thomas Kuchel was one of the last Republicans elected from California at the state or U.S. Senate level. Kuchel had been re-elected by a wide margin in 1962, winning every county in the state, and was the Minority Whip for the Republican Party.

However, in 1968 he faced a primary challenge from California Superintendent of Public Instruction Max Rafferty, who ran to the right of moderate Kuchel. In an upset, Rafferty defeated Kuchel in the primary, 50-47%.

In the Democratic primary, former California State Controller Alan Cranston won the primary with 58% of the vote.

Despite Richard Nixon&#x27;s concurrent win in the presidential election (as well as in the state of California), Cranston defeated Rafferty on election day with just under 52% of the vote, flipping the state&#x27;s other senate seat to the Democrats. Rafferty took just under 47% of the vote. Cranston would serve until 1993 in the senate. 



== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican Peter Dominick won election in 1962 over Democratic incumbent John A. Carroll by eight percentage points. In 1968, he increased his margin of victory against Stephen McNichols in what would be his last U.S. Senate victory. He would lose in 1974 to Gary Hart.




== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Abraham Ribicoff was elected in 1962 after the retirement of Prescott Bush by a razor-thin 51–49 margin. He increased his margin of victory in 1968 over Republican Representative Edwin H. May Jr.



== Florida ==


Incumbent Democrat George Smathers retired. After supporting Republicans during Reconstruction, Florida supported almost only Democrats down-ballot until the 1940s, when the state voted for Eisenhower. Claude R. Kirk Jr. was elected governor in 1966 as Republicans gained ground in the South due to Democrats shifting leftward and Republicans rightward.

Popular Democrat LeRoy Collins defeated State Attorney General Earl Faircloth in the Democratic primary, while Republican Representative Edward Gurney won the Republican primary. Despite less name recognition in the state, Gurney defeated Collins by 11 points and won all but five counties.




== Georgia ==


Democrat Herman Talmadge handily won re-election over Republican E. Earl Patton, who won the first-ever Republican primary in Georgia for U.S. Senate.



Talmadge sought another term to the Senate and was easily re-elected. The election was notable for the Georgia Republican Party, as it marked the first U.S. Senate election where it fielded a candidate. Patton lost by over 50% to Talmadge.

== Hawaii ==


Incumbent Daniel Inouye handily won re-election against Republican Wayne C. Thiessen with 83% of the vote.



== Idaho ==


Incumbent Democrat Frank Church won re-election by a wide margin against George V. Hansen despite the state&#x27;s overall Republican trend.




== Illinois ==

Incumbent Republican and Minority Leader Everett Dirksen won re-election to his fourth term over William G. Clark (D), the Illinois Attorney General. He would not serve the entirety of his term as he would die in 1970.





== Indiana ==
Incumbent Democrat Birch Bayh was elected in 1962, defeating incumbent Republican Homer E. Capehart by around 11,000 votes. In 1970, he ran for re-election and faced Republican State Representative William Ruckelshaus in the general election.

Ruckelshaus ran a close race but Bayh was ultimately re-elected by a two-point margin. This would actually be Bayh&#x27;s largest vote percentage in an election to the U.S. Senate. In 1974, he won a narrow majority of the vote over Republican Richard Lugar though he did increase his margin of victory. He was defeated in his re-election bid in 1980 by future Vice President Dan Quayle.

Birch Bayh&#x27;s son Evan Bayh would also serve in the U.S. Senate from 1999 to 2011. 




== Iowa ==


Four-term Republican Bourke B. Hickenlooper retired. Two-term Democratic Governor of Iowa Harold Hughes was elected senator in a close race against Republican state senator David M. Stanley.




== Kansas ==


Incumbent Republican Frank Carlson chose to retire rather than seek re-election. Republican Bob Dole defeated Democrat William Robinson with 60% of the vote and won all but one county in the state. Still, this would be his second-worst U.S. Senate election performance after 1974 in the wake of Watergate.




== Kentucky ==


Though originally voting strongly Democratic like the rest of the South after Reconstruction, Kentucky began electing Republicans in the 1890s but still leaned Democratic. Still, Republicans found success with the elections to U.S. Senate of Thruston Ballard Morton and John Sherman Cooper. Morton decided to retire in 1968, creating an open seat. Republican Marlow Cook narrowly defeated Democrat Katherine Peden by a 51–48 margin.



== Louisiana ==


Incumbent Democrat Russell B. Long ran unopposed for U.S. Senate and was re-elected.



== Maryland ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Brewster was originally elected in 1962 over Republican Representative Edward Tylor Miller. He won the Democratic primary and faced Republican Representative Charles Mathias in the general election. However, Democrat George P. Mahoney ran in the election under the American Independent Party. Mahoney, who ran against the Civil Rights movement, had previously been the Democratic nominee for governor in 1966 losing to Spiro Agnew. Hyman A. Pressman ran an independent campaign which allowed Republican Agnew to carry the heavily Democratic state with 49.5% of the vote.

Similarly, Mahoney ran a well-funded campaign in 1968 and Brewster was defeated in the general election. Mathias won just 48% of the vote to 39% for Brewster (and 13% for Mahoney), similarly elected to Agnew. Mathias would nonetheless have no trouble being re-elected in 1974 and 1980 (when he won the city of Baltimore). Mathias is the last Republican to represent Maryland in the U.S. Senate. 



== Missouri ==
Incumbent U.S. Senator Edward V. Long ran for re-election but faced two primary challengers in Lieutenant Governor Thomas Eagleton and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury W. True Davis Jr., who each ran strong campaigns. Eagleton won the primary with 37% of the vote.

In the general election, Eagleton faced Republican Representative Thomas B. Curtis and won a close-fought election with 51% of the vote to 49% for Curtis. Eagleton would be re-elected over Curtis again in 1974. 


== Nevada ==


Incumbent Alan Bible was originally elected in 1954 in a special election over Republican Ernest S. Brown. He narrowly defeated Republican Clarence Clifton Young in 1956 and won by a landslide in 1962. He defeated Republican Edward Fike by a smaller margin of 55–45 in 1968 in what would be his last term.




== New Hampshire ==


Incumbent Norris Cotton handily won re-election against incumbent Governor John W. King in what would be his final term.



== New York ==

Incumbent Republican Jacob Javits won against Democratic challenger Paul O&#x27;Dwyer and Conservative Party challenger James L. Buckley in a three-way election.

While Javits did not face any challengers for the Republican nomination, he did face a minor one when seeking the Liberal Party of New York&#x27;s nomination.









== North Carolina ==

The general election was fought between the Democratic incumbent Sam Ervin and the Republican nominee Robert Somers. Ervin won re-election to a third full term, with over 60% of the vote.

The first round of the Primary Election was held on May 4, 1968. The runoff for the Republican Party candidates took place on June 1.










== North Dakota ==


North Dakota Republican Milton Young, sought and received re-election to his fifth term, defeating North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate Herschel Lashkowitz, the mayor of Fargo, North Dakota since 1954.

Only Young filed as a Republican, and the endorsed Democratic candidate was Herschel Lashkowitz of Fargo, North Dakota, who was serving as the mayor of the city since 1954. Young and Lashkowitz won the primary elections for their respective parties.

One independent candidate, Duane Mutch of Larimore, North Dakota, also filed before the deadline. Mutch was later a state senator for the North Dakota Republican Party in the North Dakota Senate from 1959 to 2006 for District 19. He ran as an independent when he did not receive his party&#x27;s nomination.




== Ohio ==

Incumbent Democrat Frank J. Lausche ran for re-election but was defeated in the primary by Representative John J. Gilligan, who criticized Lausche&#x27;s conservative voting record. Republican State Attorney General of Ohio William Saxbe won the Republican primary and defeated Gilligan in the general election by a 51–48 margin. He would not serve out his term after resigning to become United States Attorney general in 1974.



== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Mike Monroney was running for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by Republican former Governor Henry Bellmon.





== Oregon ==

Incumbent Democrat Wayne Morse was seeking a fifth term, but narrowly lost re-election to 36-year-old Republican State Representative Bob Packwood race.

The Democratic primary was held May 28, 1968. Morse defeated former Representative Robert B. Duncan, former U.S. Congressman from Oregon&#x27;s 4th congressional district (1963–1967), and Phil McAlmond, millionaire and former aide to opponent Robert B. Duncan.






== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Democrat Joseph Clark sought re-election to another term, but was defeated by Republican nominee Richard Schweiker, member of the U.S. House of Representatives.






== South Carolina ==


Incumbent Democrat Fritz Hollings easily defeated Republican state senator Marshall Parker in a rematch of the election two years earlier, to win his second (his first full) term.

Hollings faced no opposition from South Carolina Democrats, and avoided a primary election. Marshall Parker, the state senator from Oconee County in the Upstate, was persuaded by South Carolina Republicans to enter the race, and he did not face a primary challenge.

After a close election loss to Fritz Hollings in 1966, the Republicans felt that Parker might have a chance at defeating Hollings by riding Nixon&#x27;s coattails in the general election. However, the Republicans did not provide Parker with the financial resources to compete, and he subsequently lost by a bigger margin to Hollings than two years prior.



== South Dakota ==


Incumbent Democrat George McGovern had flirted with presidential aspirations in 1968 but ultimately decided to run for re-election, defeating Republican Archie M. Gubbrud by a comfortable margin.




== Utah ==


Incumbent Wallace F. Bennett, a Republican, won re-election to a fourth term in the U.S. Senate by a comfortable margin against Democrat Milton Weilemann.



== Vermont ==


Incumbent Republican George Aiken ran successfully for re-election to another term in the United States Senate. Vermont voted Democratic for the first time since the 1850s for Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Vermont also elected Democrat Philip H. Hoff in 1962, and he served until 1969. Hoff ran a write-in campaign in the Democratic primary for this seat but lost to &quot;Republican&quot; Aiken by a wide margin. Aiken thus ran with both nominations and secured a victory. This would be once staunchly-Republican Vermont&#x27;s last time to support a Republican for this seat. In 1974, Patrick Leahy would win and become the first Democratic Senator from Vermont.








== Washington ==


Incumbent Warren G. Magnuson won re-election by a wide margin against his Republican opponent Metcalf.




== Wisconsin ==


Incumbent Democrat Gaylord A. Nelson (U.S. senator since 1963) defeated Republican State Senator Jerris Leonard.

<text>State Road 552 (SR 552), signed east–west, is part of Curry Ford Road in eastern Orlando.

==Route description==

SR 552&#x27;s western terminus is at SR 15 in Orlando and its eastern terminus is at SR 551 near Azalea Park.

==History==
SR 552 was originally SR 526A; it was renumbered in the mid-1980s.

SR 526A at one time stretched west to Briercliff Drive; this had been part of SR 15 even earlier.

Curry Ford Road east of Goldenrod Road was once part of SR 425, but was probably never part of SR 526A.

<text>The Miss Black America beauty contest is a competition for young African-American women. The pageant has garnered the support of artists, activists and performers including Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, and Oprah Winfrey. After 40 years, in 2009 the pageant had a &quot;kick off&quot; in Washington, D.C. to rebrand the competition. The first teen winner was Ashley Anglin. The first runner-up teen was Monet Jackson, a resident of Mitchellville, MD; and Destiny Welch, second runner-up and also an MD resident. The adult winner was DC native and MD resident, Miss Kamilla Collier-Mullin. The first runner-up Miss Cherie A. Bryant, a northern Virginia resident; and the second runner up was Miss Janesia Simmons in the adult pageant.

== History ==
It was originally a local Philadelphia area contest to protest the lack of black women in the Miss America pageant. J. Morris Anderson created and produced the Miss Black America Pageant along with Brenda Cozart who organized and directed the pageant also serving as a beauty consultant for contestants and recruiter which started on August 17, 1968, at the Ritz-Carlton in Atlantic City. With support from Phillip H. Savage, Tri-State Director of the NAACP, the pageant received nationwide press coverage as a protest against the Miss America Pageant, an event that Mr. Savage and other NAACP leaders had long condemned for exclusion of black women contestants.

In September 1977, NBC televised the Miss Black America contest, the day before CBS televised Miss America.

== In popular culture ==

* A short documentary on the Miss Black America pageant was produced by director Bayer Mack and released by Block Starz Music Television as part of its &quot;Profiles of African-American Success&quot; video series.
* In 1970, Curtis Mayfield released a track entitled &quot;Miss Black America&quot; on his debut album, Curtis.
*In 2021, Jennifer Holness released her documentary film, &quot;Subjects of Desire&quot; (2021) which documented &quot;the cultural shift in North American beauty standards towards embracing Black female aesthetics&quot; and predominantly featured prep for the 2018 pageant, and interviews with its contestants. The film premiered at SXSW and was screened in the Documentary Feature Competition.

<text>Real-time optimally adapting mesh (ROAM) is a continuous level of detail algorithm that optimizes terrain meshes. On modern computers, sometimes it is more effective to send a small amount of unneeded polygons to the GPU, rather than burden the CPU with LOD (Level of Detail) calculations—making algorithms like geomipmapping more effective than ROAM. This technique is used by graphics programmers
in order to produce high quality displays while being able to maintain real-time frame rates. Algorithms such as ROAM exist to provide a control over scene quality versus performance in order to provide HQ scenes while retaining real-time frame rates on hardware. ROAM largely aims toward terrain visualization, but various elements from ROAM are difficult to place within a game system.

To assist regional geological mapping, more abundant and visualized expression forms are highly needs. Thus, the 3D terrain model is adopted as the carrier for the demands in many correlative fields. Based on the regular grid DEM (Digital Elevation Model) in DRGS, ROAM algorithm is applied to create a more dynamic model, which will give consideration to the importance of different features and select correspondence level of detail.

==Original Paper== 
The algorithm was introduced in the paper &quot; ROAMing Terrain: Real-time Optimally Adapting Meshes&quot; appearing in the Proceedings of IEEE Visualization 1997. The authors are

<text>Class B is a class of airspace in the United States which follows International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) airspace designation. Class B airspace areas are designed to improve aviation safety by reducing the risk of midair collisions in the airspace surrounding airports with high-density air traffic operations. Aircraft operating in these airspace areas are subject to certain operating rules and equipment requirements.

Class B airspace protects the approach and departure paths from aircraft not under air traffic control. All aircraft inside Class B airspace are subject to air traffic control. Traffic operating under VFR must be identified on radar and explicitly cleared into the airspace before they can enter. The airspace is commonly depicted as resembling an &quot;upside-down wedding cake&quot;. The innermost ring extends from the surface area around the airport to typically 10,000&#x27; MSL. Several outer rings usually surround it with progressively higher floors to allow traffic into nearby airports without entering the primary airport&#x27;s Class B airspace.

The airspace around the busiest US airports is classified as ICAO Class B, and the primary airport (one or more) for which this airspace is designated is called Class B airport. As of January 2023, there are 37 Class B airports in the United States. Despite common misconception, Nellis Air Force Base and Dallas Love Field Airport are not designated as Class B airports; however, in both cases the Class B airspace for the primary airport in the region (Harry Reid International and Dallas/Fort Worth International, respectively) has been specifically extended to cover these airports as if they were themselves Class B.

<text>Sturmführer (, &quot;storm leader&quot;) was a paramilitary rank of the Nazi Party which began as a title used by the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA) in 1925 and became an actual SA rank in 1928. Translated as &quot;storm leader or assault leader&quot;, the origins of the rank dated to the First World War when the title of &quot;Sturmführer&quot; was used by leaders of German shock troops and special action companies.

By 1930, &quot;Sturmführer&quot; had become the lowest commissioned officer (CO) rank of several Nazi Party paramilitary organizations, including the SA. The title was also used as an SS rank until 1934 when after the Night of the Long Knives the SS renamed the rank &quot;Untersturmführer&quot;, which was the equivalent to a second lieutenant in other military organizations.

<text>Markus Hendrik &quot;Mark&quot; Overmars (; born 29 September 1958) is a Dutch computer scientist and teacher of game programming known for his game development application GameMaker. GameMaker lets people create computer games using a drag-and-drop interface. He is the former head of the &quot;Center for Geometry, Imaging, and Virtual Environments&quot; at Utrecht University, in the Netherlands. This research center concentrates on computational geometry and its application in areas like computer graphics, robotics, geographic information systems, imaging, multimedia, virtual environments, and games.

Overmars received his Ph.D. in 1983 from Utrecht University under the supervision of Jan van Leeuwen, and continued to be a member of the faculty of the same university until September 2013. Overmars has published over 100 journal papers, largely on computational geometry, and is the co-author of several books including a widely used computational geometry text.

Overmars has also worked in robotics. He was the first to develop the probabilistic roadmap method in 1992, which was later independently discovered by Kavraki and Latombe in 1994. Their joint paper, &quot;Probabilistic roadmaps for path planning in high-dimensional configuration spaces&quot;, is considered one of the most influential studies in motion planning, and has been widely cited (more than 2500 times as of 2014 according to Google Scholar).

In 2011, Overmars and game designer Jochem Schut developed a snake video game called &quot;Super Snake HD&quot; as a mobile app; it was published by YoYo Games.

Overmars founded and was CTO of Tingly Games from 2012 until it was acquired by CoolGames in 2016. Tingly focused on HTML5 games and e-cards / casual games, the latter of which is called &quot;greeting games&quot;.

He founded Quarterfall in June 2020 together with Arjan Egges. Quarterfall is a teaching product that helps teachers use formative assessment to improve the learning processes their students, compared to just assessing their performance.

He is also the original author of the XForms toolkit.

<text>Ronald Thompson (born 1969) is an American former college basketball player and coach and current Emmy Award-winning broadcaster for Comcast SportsNet, based in Bethesda, Maryland. He is the son of Gwen Thompson and former Georgetown University head coach John R. Thompson, Jr., whose children also include a daughter, Tiffany, and John Thompson III, who also is a former Georgetown head coach.

Born in Washington, D.C., Thompson spent his formative years on basketball courts in the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs throughout the Washington metropolitan area. He contributed on Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) teams in the Washington, D.C, region and played high school basketball for coach Stu Vetter at Flint Hill School in Oakton, Virginia. In 1992, Thompson graduated from Georgetown University as a four-year basketball letterman with a degree in sociology. After a brief stint as a trading assistant with Prudential Securities in New York City, he became an assistant coach, first at the University of Oregon from 1993 to 1994, then with Loyola College in Maryland from 1994 to 1996. His career in professional sports began as a video coordinator for Hall of Fame coach Larry Brown and the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1996; shortly afterward, he became a 76ers scout. In 1998, Thompson returned to Georgetown as an assistant coach under his father from 1998 to 1999 and then under head coach Craig Esherick from 1999 to 2003. He then was an assistant coach at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, Arkansas from 2003 to 2006.

Thompson accepted the head coaching job at Ball State University in April 2006. In his one season as coach of the Cardinals they finished a disappointing 9-22. Following the season, controversy developed surrounding a potential NCAA investigation into the basketball coaching staff attending voluntary player workouts outside of the regulated practice dates. The Ball State newspaper reported that on Sunday, June 24, 2007, &quot;men&#x27;s basketball coach Ronny Thompson was greeted at his office with seven note cards that simply read &#x27;liars, cheaters, [racial slur].&#x27;&quot; Thompson resigned as men&#x27;s basketball coach in July 2007, later claiming that he had been in a &quot;racially hostile work environment.&quot; Ball State later exonerated Thompson of rules violations, apologized, and awarded him a $200,000 settlement. &quot;In return, Thompson agreed to waive all claims he may have against the university and that nothing in the settlement constitutes an admission of liability or illegality by either party.&quot;

Thompson joined Comcast SportsNet in 2007, offering pre-game/postgame analysis for the Washington Wizards and color commentary for college games. He also hosted the series &quot;My Life 365 with Ron Thompson&quot;, which featured interviews with the preeminent athletes and media figures of the United States. His subjects included sports/media moguls Ted Leonsis and Sheila Johnson, former Duke University swingman Grant Hill, Georgetown Hoyas teammate Alonzo Mourning, and legendary Hoyas guard Allen Iverson;Thompson received an Emmy for the latter interview. Thompson also conducted a rare, exclusive interview with Los Angeles Lakers guard Kobe Bryant months before he helped the Lakers secure their seventeenth franchise title. In the summer of 2010, Thompson served as director of the Kobe Bryant/Nike Summer Basketball Camp which toured China.

Thompson is also a contributor to NBA TV and occasionally served as guest-host for his father&#x27;s &quot;The John Thompson Show&quot;, which was broadcast daily on-air/online on ESPN Radio until ending its run in February 2012.

==The Single File 1978~1983 – Box Set==

The Single File 1978~1983 is a boxed set released on 23 January 1984, available only on vinyl. It contained all Kate Bush&#x27;s 7&quot; singles and their B-sides up until that point, and her live EP &quot;On Stage&quot;. The box set primarily included her UK singles. The European single &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; and the Irish single &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot; were not included but &quot;Ne t&#x27;enfuis pas (remix)&quot; single was. The boxset also included a lyric book.

&quot;I&#x27;m surprised that I&#x27;ve got this amount of material together in five years,&quot; Bush remarked. &quot;I&#x27;m thrilled, really... I mean, it is a form of &#x27;greatest hits&#x27;. It&#x27;s just put in a box and it&#x27;s a nicer way of doing it.&quot;

<text>The State Highway System of the U.S. state of Florida comprises the roads maintained by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) or a toll authority. The components are referred to officially as state roads, abbreviated as SR.

==History==

Prior to the 1945 renumbering, State Roads were given numbers in the order they were added to the system. The 1945 renumbering removed many roads that were never built and added some that had not existed prior to 1945.

In 1955, the State Road Department (SRD) slowed the addition of new state roads and began to classify roads into primary, secondary, and local roads. Primary roads would continue to be state-maintained, while secondary roads would have an S before the number, and would only be state-maintained during a construction project. Local roads would be completely removed from the system. In 1969, the State Road Department was superseded by Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT).

In 1977, House Bill 803 (HB 803), Chapter 77-165 in the &quot;Laws of Florida&quot;, was passed in the Florida Legislature. This transportation policy act eliminated the secondary roads, roads that consisted of county roads that were maintained by the state. When the provisions went into effect on July 1, 1977, the division of roads became state, county, and local. Most secondary roads and some primary roads were given to the counties, and occasionally a new state road was taken over; some main roads in incorporated areas were given to the localities.

==Numbering system==
State road numbers are assigned by FDOT. Every state road must have a number. The road segments can be discontinuous (or interrupted) but the separate segments must have a logical and sequential connection between them. A road cannot ever split into two different roads with the same state road or county road number unless it is to allow for a one-way pair to connect to a two-way road. There is also no minimum required length for a state road.

Odd-numbered roads run north-south and even-numbered roads run east-west. One- and two-digit numbers run in order from 2 in the north to 94 in the south, and A1A (formerly 1) in the east to 99 in the west. The major cross-state roads end in 0 and 5. Three-digit numbers increase from east to west across the band. 30 is skipped because it runs along the Gulf Coast in the panhandle and doesn&#x27;t go all the way across the state. (The graphic above shows SR 30 change to SR 20 going east of the panhandle.)

Minor routes assigned three or four-digit numbers are located relative to the east-west control roads on the basis of the first digit. For example, State Road 464 is located between State Road 40 and State Road 50.

Every section of U.S. Highway and Interstate Highway has a State Road number assigned to it, usually unsigned (for example, Interstate 4 is also unsigned SR 400). In addition to some named toll roads (for example, 91 and 821, which make up Florida&#x27;s Turnpike) some minor State Roads are also unsigned (like SR 913 and SR 5054).

<text>Randy White (born September 3, 1948 in Halifax, Nova Scotia) is a Canadian accountant and former politician. White was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada as the Reform Party Member of Parliament (MP) for
Fraser Valley West, British Columbia in the 1993 federal election.

In the 1997 election, he was re-elected for the riding of Langley—Abbotsford, and became a Canadian Alliance MP in 2000 when Reform was joined by dissident members of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

White served as the Reform Party&#x27;s House Leader from 1997 to 2000 and as the Canadian Alliance House Leader from 2001 to 2002. He also served as Caucus Chair in 2001, and as Deputy Caucus Chair in 2002. He joined the new Conservative Party of Canada upon the merger of the Alliance with the Progressive Conservative Party in early 2004.

In 2004, Randy White famously was quoted saying &quot;to heck with the courts&quot; in regard to overturning same-sex marriage. Bruce Cheadle of the Canadian Press said that this comment &quot;may have cost the Conservatives the election&quot;.

White left politics in 2006 and did not run in the 2006 federal election. He has continued activity in the area of drug policy, including founding The Drug Prevention Network of Canada.

In 2010, the British Columbia Conservative Party announced that White had joined the party and would chair its tactical advisory group.

White is a former member of the Royal Canadian Air Force.

<doc id="1177544" wikidata="Q5504210" url="?curid=1177544" title="Friends Seminary">
<text>Friends Seminary is an independent K-12 school in Manhattan. The oldest continuously coeducational school in New York City, in recent years it has served approximately 800 students. The school&#x27;s vision statement declares its purpose is &quot;to prepare students to engage in the world that is and to help bring about a world that ought to be.&quot;

Robert &quot;Bo&quot; Lauder is principal, the school&#x27;s 35th. Lauder came to Friends in the fall of 2002 after serving as Upper School Head at Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C.

==History==

Friends Seminary, established by members of the Religious Society of Friends, whose members are known as Quakers, was founded in 1786 as Friends&#x27; Institute through a $10,000 bequest of Robert Murray, a wealthy New York merchant. It was located on Pearl Street in Manhattan and strived to provide Quaker children with a &quot;guarded education.&quot; In 1826, the school was moved to a larger campus on Elizabeth Street. Tuition in that year was $10 or less per annum, except for the oldest students, whose families paid $20. (By 1915, tuition had risen to $250.) The school again moved in 1860 to its current location and changed its name to Friends Seminary.

In 1878, Friends Seminary was one of the earliest of schools to establish a Kindergarten. In 1925, it was the first private co-educational school to hire a full-time psychologist. M. Scott Peck, who transferred to Friends from Phillips Exeter in late 1952, praised the school&#x27;s diversity and nurturing atmosphere. &quot;While at Friends,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I awoke each morning eager for the day ahead ... [A]t Exeter, I could barely crawl out of bed.&quot;

In 2015, based on recommendations made in 2005 by the Trustees of the New York Quarterly Meeting after completion of a study, the New York Quarterly Meeting reached consensus on the issue of incorporating the school and the New York Quarterly Meeting separately. Under the agreement, Friends Seminary will pay the New York Quarterly Meeting $775,000 annually, and both sides will contribute an additional $175,000 to a capital fund to preserve the historic buildings. The Quakers will continue naming half the members of the school&#x27;s governing board, and the agreement establishes a six-person committee to foster the school&#x27;s commitment to Quaker values.

The school&#x27;s vision is &quot;to prepare students to engage in the world that is and to help bring about a world that ought to be.&quot; It is currently guided by a mission statement adopted in 2015, a service learning statement adopted in 2004, a diversity and inclusion mission statement adopted in 2005, and a global education mission statement adopted in 2024. Friends Seminary is a member of New York&#x27;s Independent School Diversity Network. 

==Organization==

The school is divided into three sections:

*Lower School - Kindergarten to Grade 4
*Middle School - Grades 5-8
*Upper School - Grades 9-12

==Facilities==

The campus comprises six buildings. The largest building, known as Hunter Hall, built in 1964, holds classes for the entire Middle School, most of the Lower School and some of the Upper School. The building contains a basement-level gymnasium and cafeteria, library and media center, science laboratories, art studios, computer laboratories and classrooms for all grades.

Attached to the school is the historic Meetinghouse, a landmark built in 1860, and the Fifteenth Street Monthly Meeting of The Religious Society of Friends. The Meetinghouse plays an integral part in student life at Friends Seminary. Outside the front doors of the Meetinghouse is the courtyard used for recess and other activities.

In 1997, the school purchased and renovated a former German Masonic Temple located on 15th Street. The new building, called &quot;The Annex&quot;, incorporates &quot;green technology&quot; to create a building with less of an ecological footprint than many other buildings in the city. The Annex includes more science labs, as well as three multi-use classrooms, and a black box theater.

The Meetinghouse, located on 15th Street at Rutherford Place (next to Stuyvesant Square), serves both as a place of worship and, traditionally, as a performance space, although the school has opted as of 2011 to perform in the Vineyard theatre on 15th Street. The Meetinghouse also serves as a home for the school&#x27;s music program.

Friends Seminary completed an extensive redevelopment project in 2019. They designed an entirely new structure behind the facades of three 1852 townhouses and connected them seamlessly to the School&#x27;s main building. The new structure provides separate access for the Upper School, in addition to a &quot;Great Room,&quot; which is a multipurpose gathering space that opens onto a courtyard. The new space also features an Upper School Commons and Terrace along with new classrooms are that grouped around shared study and locker areas. A rooftop Greenhouse and play area was also developed.

==Cost==
Tuition for the 2023–2024, school year for all grades is . In addition, there are fees for meals, technology resources, etc., in combination with the expense for books for grades 9–12, that would add approximately $6,000-$8,000 to the cost of attendance.

<text>The Line, the Cross and the Curve is a 1993 British musical short film directed by and starring singer Kate Bush, co-starring Miranda Richardson and choreographer Lindsay Kemp, who had served as dance mentor to Bush early in her career.

The short film is essentially an extended music video, featuring songs from Bush&#x27;s 1993 album, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, which in turn was inspired by the classic movie musical-fantasy &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;.

In this version of the tale, Bush plays a frustrated singer-dancer who is enticed by a mysterious woman (Richardson) into putting on a pair of magical ballet slippers. Once on her feet, the shoes start dancing on their own, and Bush&#x27;s character (who is never referred to by name) must battle Richardson&#x27;s character to free herself from the spell of the shoes. Her guide on this strange journey is played by Kemp.

The film was released direct-to-video in most areas, and was only a modest success. Kate Bush later expressed her displeasure with the final product, calling it &quot;a load of bollocks&quot;. Soon after its release, Bush effectively dropped out of the public eye until her eighth studio album, &quot;Aerial&quot;, released in November 2005.

Two years after the UK release, due to late promotion in the US, the film was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video in 1996.

The film continues to be played in arthouse cinemas around the world, and was screened at Hollywood Theatre in 2014 along with modern dance interpretations to Bush&#x27;s music.

==Plot==
A singer practises with her band and a dancer (&quot;Rubberband Girl&quot;). After everyone else leaves, she remains in the studio and sings to herself by candlelight (&quot;And So Is Love&quot;).

A woman crashes through the studio&#x27;s mirror, claiming to have survived a fire, and asks the singer to help her return home by drawing symbols on three pieces of paper: a line, a cross, and a curve. In return, she offers the singer her red ballet shoes. The strange woman tells the singer that the curve represents her smile; the cross, her heart; and the line, her path. The bandages around her hands spin off, alerting the singer that something is wrong, but before she can do anything, the shoes tie themselves to her feet. The villain returns through the mirror, and a man faintly appears and gestures to the singer. She crashes through the mirror into their world (&quot;The Red Shoes&quot;).

The man begins acting as the singer&#x27;s guide. He is able to calm the shoes, but tells the singer that she must &quot;sing back the symbols&quot; to escape the villain&#x27;s power. He takes her to meet Lily, a mystic who offers her protection and advice and helps her to recover the line (&quot;Lily&quot;). On the guide&#x27;s advice, the singer recalls her loved ones, including some who have died, thus recovering the cross (&quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot;).

The villain reappears and taunts the singer, but the singer realises she is merely scared of losing her power. She chases the villain, trying to retake the three pieces of paper on which she drew. They encounter a group of people joyfully dancing on a carpet of fruits, and the singer joins them while the villain continues to flee (&quot;Eat the Music&quot;). After the singer collapses in happy exhaustion, the papers fly from the villain&#x27;s hand into hers, and the shoes return to the villain&#x27;s feet. The singer returns through the mirror to her own world. The villain is buried in a pile of rubble, but her feet, controlled by the shoes, emerge and continue to dance.

==Footage reuse==
All songs apart from &quot;Lily&quot; were used as promotional videos for the corresponding singles from Bush&#x27;s &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; album. The standalone video for &quot;Eat the Music&quot; had several differences from the film version, replacing footage of Bush and Richardson&#x27;s chase with additional dancing and singing sequences featuring Bush and new footage featuring two male dancers sparring with watermelons on their heads and of Bush having a line of black make-up applied to her cheeks.

The &quot;Rubberband Girl&quot; and &quot;Moments of Pleasure&quot; clips were included on the video compilation &quot;The Whole Story &#x27;94&quot;.

<text>Harry Myrislaw Harapiak (September 17, 1938 – November 14, 2000) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1981 to 1990, and was a cabinet minister in the New Democratic Party government of Howard Pawley. His brother Leonard Harapiak was also a cabinet minister in the Pawley administration, and his sister Rosann Wowchuk was a cabinet minister in the governments of Gary Doer and Greg Selinger and retired before the 2011 Manitoba election.

The son of William John Harapiak and Mary Philipchuk, Harry Harapiak was born in Cowan, Manitoba and was educated there, at Minitonas College and at Coniston Continuation; he did not attend university. In the 1950s, he left the family farm to work at the Inco mines in Sudbury. He married Carol Anne Eastwood in 1962 in Coniston, Ontario and they had five children together - Marianne, Mark, Christine, Kelly and Chad. He returned to farming in Manitoba the following year. After a few years of subsistence farming, he began work with the Canadian National Railway. Harry served as a Kelsey School Board trustee in The Pas, Manitoba from 1973 to 1981.

He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1981, for the northern riding of The Pas. Pawley&#x27;s NDP won a majority government in this election, and on January 30, 1985, Harapiak was appointed Minister of Northern Affairs with responsibility for the Communities Economic Development Fund Act and some aspects of the Manitoba Natural Resources Development Act . He was re-elected without difficulty in the 1986 election and kept in his portfolio, without the additional responsibilities. On February 4, 1987, he was appointed Minister of Government Services with responsibility for the Workers Compensation Act (except as regards Worker Advisers).

The New Democrats were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in early 1988, and were defeated in the election which followed. Harry Harapiak was re-elected for The Pas, and sat in the opposition benches for the next two years. He did not run for re-election in 1990, and returned to his private career as a VIA Rail Canada engineer. In 1997, he became a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church in Winnipeg.

On May 19, 1984, Harry&#x27;s eldest daughter Marianne married Todd Lamb, the grandson of Tom Lamb from The Pas, Manitoba.

On April 13, 2005, Harry&#x27;s daughter Christine Harapiak was appointed as a Judge in Manitoba.

Harry&#x27;s eldest son Mark Harapiak is an actor based in Toronto. He has appeared in many productions at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival. Mark&#x27;s wife, Blythe Wilson appeared in Mary Poppins on Broadway in 2011-2012.

Harry Harapiak died November 14, 2000, at the age of 62.

<doc id="1177569" wikidata="Q499282" url="?curid=1177569" title="I Shot the Sheriff">
<text>&quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; is a song written by Jamaican reggae musician Bob Marley and released in 1973 with his band the Wailers.

==Bob Marley and the Wailers version==
The song was first released in 1973 on The Wailers&#x27; album &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot;. Marley explained his intention as follows: &quot;I want to say &#x27;I shot the police&#x27; but the government would have made a fuss so I said &#x27;I shot the sheriff&#x27; instead... but it&#x27;s the same idea: justice.&quot;

In 1992, with the controversy surrounding the Ice-T song &quot;Cop Killer&quot;, Marley&#x27;s song was often cited by Ice-T&#x27;s supporters as evidence of his detractors&#x27; hypocrisy, considering that the older song was never similarly criticised despite having much the same theme.

In 2012, Marley&#x27;s former girlfriend Esther Anderson claimed that the lyrics, &quot;Sheriff John Brown always hated me / For what, I don&#x27;t know / Every time I plant a seed / He said, &#x27;Kill it before it grow&#x27;&quot; are actually about Marley being very opposed to her use of birth control pills; Marley supposedly replaced the word &quot;doctor&quot; with sheriff.

==Eric Clapton version==
Eric Clapton recorded a cover version that was included on his 1974 album &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot;. His performance of the song adds soft rock to the reggae sound. &quot;Billboard&quot; described this version as being &quot;a catchy goof of a winner&quot; despite not containing a guitar solo. &quot;Cash Box&quot; called it a &quot;smooth bluesy rocker with lots of guitar, keyboards and strong background harmonies.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said that Clapton is &quot;firing straight from the hip, both vocally and riff-wise.&quot; Faring better in the charts, it peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, his only US number one to date. In 2003, Clapton&#x27;s version was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Warren G version==
&quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; is the lead single released from Warren G&#x27;s second album, &quot;Take a Look Over Your Shoulder&quot;. Warren replaced Marley&#x27;s original lyrics with his own, although Clapton&#x27;s version of the song is sampled and R&amp;B singer Nancy Fletcher sings the original chorus. The song was a hit in several countries. In the US, it peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified Gold by the RIAA on 2 May 1997. It peaked at number two in the UK and at number one in New Zealand.

The official remix was produced by EPMD member Erick Sermon, it is based around EPMD&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Business&quot;, which also sampled Clapton&#x27;s version of the song.

<doc id="1177585" wikidata="Q4347840" url="?curid=1177585" title="1966 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1966 United States Senate elections were elections on November 8, 1966, for the United States Senate which occurred midway through the second (and only full) term of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The 33 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. With divisions in the Democratic base over the Vietnam War, and with the traditional mid-term advantage of the party not holding the presidency, the Republicans took three Democratic seats, thereby breaking Democrats&#x27; 2/3rds supermajority. Despite Republican gains, the balance remained overwhelmingly in favor of the Democrats, who retained a 64–36 majority. Democrats were further reduced to 63–37, following the death of Robert F. Kennedy in June 1968.

These were also the first elections held after the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Upon Edward Brooke&#x27;s election in Massachusetts, he became the first African-American U.S. Senator elected after the end of Reconstruction and the first-ever popularly elected, as Reconstruction ended before the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. As of 2024, this is the most recent Senate election cycle in which no House incumbents were elected to the Senate and the last time any state elected different parties to each Senate seat in a double barrel election.

All of the elections involved the Class 2 seats.

== Closest races ==
Nine races had a margin of victory under 10%:

There is no tipping point state, as the Arkansas, Georgia, and Louisiana races were all unopposed.

== Alabama ==

Incumbent Democrat John Sparkman was easily reelected to a fourth full term. Republican challenger John Grenier received 39% of the vote, the best result that a challenger to Sparkman had ever received to that date, presaging the rise of the Republican party in Alabama after decades of Democratic dominance. 



== Alaska ==

Incumbent Democrat Bob Bartlett was reelected to his third (a second full) term in a landslide, defeating Republican candidate Lee McKinley in a rematch of the 1960 election.



== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democrat John L. McClellan was reelected unopposed to a fifth term in office.


== Colorado ==


Republican incumbent Gordon Allott was reelected to a third term, defeating Democratic state senator and future governor Roy Romer.




== Delaware ==

Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs won reelection to a second term over Democratic candidate James M. Tunnell Jr., whose father had served in the Senate in the 1940s.



== Georgia ==

Democratic incumbent Richard Russell Jr. was reelected unopposed to a sixth full term (and seventh overall.)



== Idaho ==

Republican incumbent Leonard B. Jordan won reelection a full term, having previously served out the unexpired term of the late Henry Dworshak. He defeated Democratic Congressman Ralph R. Harding.



== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Paul Douglas, seeking a fourth term in the United States Senate, faced off against Republican Charles H. Percy, a businessman and the 1964 Republican nominee for Governor of Illinois. Also running was Robert Sabonjian (I), Mayor of Waukegan. A competitive election ensued, featuring campaign appearances by former Vice-President Richard M. Nixon on behalf of Percy. Ultimately, Percy ended up defeating Senator Douglas by a fairly wide margin, allowing him to win what would be the first of three terms in the Senate.




== Iowa ==

Republican incumbent Jack Miller was reelected to a second term, defeating Democrat Elbert B. Smith, who had previously run for the state&#x27;s other Senate seat in 1962.




== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican James B. Pearson won reelection to a full term, having previously served out the unexpired term of Andrew Frank Schoeppel following Schoeppel&#x27;s death. He defeated Democratic Congressman James Floyd Breeding.




== Kentucky ==

Republican incumbent John Sherman Cooper won reelection over Democrat John Y. Brown Sr., an attorney and former Congressman.



== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democrat Allen J. Ellender was elected unopposed to a sixth term.


== Maine ==

Republican incumbent Margaret Chase Smith won reelection to a fourth term over Democrat Elmer H. Violette, a state legislator and future judge of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.




== Massachusetts ==

Republican State Attorney General Edward Brooke defeated his challengers. Republican incumbent, Leverett Saltonstall, was retiring after serving for 22 years. Brooke was the first black U.S. senator elected since Reconstruction.





== Michigan ==

Republican incumbent Robert P. Griffin won reelection to a full term, having initially been appointed to the seat following the death of Patrick V. McNamara six months earlier. He defeated Democratic former Governor G. Mennen Williams.



== Minnesota ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. senator Walter Mondale, who had originally been appointed in 1964 to replace Hubert Humphrey after Humphrey was elected Vice President of the United States, defeated Republican challenger Robert A. Forsythe, to win a full term.






== Mississippi ==

Incumbent James Eastland, who first entered the Senate in 1941, faced the opposition of Prentiss Walker, the state&#x27;s first Republican congressman since Reconstruction.

Walker, who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ran on the right of Eastland and solely focused on the white vote, accusing him of not being hard enough in opposing integration and being friendly with President Johnson, accusations to which Eastland partisans opposed the fact Walker nominated a black constituent, Marvell Lang, to the Air Force Academy. He proudly announced he went to a meeting of the Americans for the Preservation of the White Race, a Ku Klux Klan front, enabling Eastland to proudly announce he was opposed by both the Klan and the AFL-CIO.

Eastland cast the civil rights movement with the tar of Communism and Black Power and raised the bloody shirt of Reconstruction against the candidacy of Walker. He was supported by segregationists Tom Brady, George Wallace and Leander Perez.

Most of the White voters stayed with Eastland, and Walker ironically won African-Americans in southwestern Mississippi who wanted to cast a protest vote against Eastland.

Years later, Wirt Yerger, the chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party in the 1960s, said that Walker&#x27;s decision to relinquish his House seat after one term for the vagaries of a Senate race against Eastland was &quot;very devastating&quot; to the growth of the GOP in Mississippi.

Reverend Clifton Whitley also ran for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. A sore-loser law was invoked against Whitley, who ran in the Democratic primary, and he only won one week before the election, thereby preventing to enter any serious campaign or fundraising.




== Montana ==

Incumbent United States senator Lee Metcalf, who was first elected to the Senate in 1960, ran for re-election. He won the Democratic primary uncontested, and moved on to the general election, where he was opposed by Tim Babcock, the Republican nominee and the Governor of Montana. Though the race remained close, Metcalf was able to expand on his 1960 margin of victory, and defeated Babcock to win a second term.






== Nebraska ==

The incumbent Republican Carl Curtis was re-elected to a third term, defeating outgoing Democratic Governor Frank B. Morrison.



== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Democrat Thomas J. McIntyre was reelected to a full term, having previously won a 1962 special election to serve out the unexpired term of the late Styles Bridges. He defeated U.S. Air Force General Harrison Thyng.



== New Jersey ==

Republican incumbent Clifford P. Case was reelected to a third term in a landslide over Democratic Middlesex County Attorney Warren W. Wilentz.



== New Mexico ==

Democratic incumbent Clinton Anderson was reelected to a fourth term over Republican candidate Anderson Carter.



== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Democrat B. Everett Jordan was reelected to a second full term (and third overall), defeating Republican challenger John Shallcross.




== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Democrat Fred R. Harris was reelected to a full term, having won a special election two years earlier to complete Robert S. Kerr&#x27;s unexpired term. He defeated Republican candidate Pat Patterson.



== Oregon ==

Incumbent Senator Maurine Brown Neuberger did not seek re-election. Held during the escalation of United States involvement of the Vietnam War, the race was between Republican candidate and incumbent Governor of Oregon Mark Hatfield, who opposed the war, and Democratic congressman Robert B. Duncan, who supported the war. In an unusual move, Oregon&#x27;s other Senator, Democrat Wayne Morse, who also opposed the war, crossed party lines to endorse Hatfield, who won in a close election, his first of five terms in the United States Senate.

In March 1960, first-term U.S. senator Richard L. Neuberger died in office. Despite calls to appoint his widow, Maurine Brown Neuberger, to the position, Governor Mark Hatfield instead appointed Oregon Supreme Court justice Hall S. Lusk to fill the position until a November special election. Hatfield stated that he intended to have appointed Neuberger, but that he wanted to appoint someone who would be focused on completing the remaining eight months of the term and not running in the regular-term Senate election as Neuberger had announced she would. Some observers noted that Hatfield, a Republican, though required by state law to appoint someone of the same political party as the late Senator Neuberger, did not want to give the other party the political advantage of incumbency.

Neuberger went on to win the special election over former Oregon governor Elmo Smith, but despite the urging of Oregon congressman Robert B. Duncan, she chose not to run for a second term in 1966, citing health issues, poor relations with Oregon&#x27;s senior Senator Wayne Morse, and the burden of fundraising. Duncan also urged fellow Oregon congressperson Edith Green to run for the post, but Green also declined.

On the seventh anniversary of his inauguration as Oregon&#x27;s 29th governor, Hatfield announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. In his announcement, Hatfield focused on the economic achievements in the state since his election, citing record-high employment and the creation of 138,000 jobs. Hatfield was considered vulnerable on the subject of the Vietnam War, which he opposed, in contrast with 75% of Oregonians, who favored the war. Hatfield&#x27;s views on the war had been strongly affected by his own experiences: as a U.S. Navy ensign in World War II, he had been among the first to walk through the devastation caused by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima; in a later assignment in Vietnam, he saw first-hand how imperialism led to incredible disparity, with countless Vietnamese living in poverty next to opulent French mansions. The war issue gave Hatfield competition from several minor candidates on the right, but Hatfield nonetheless won by a wide margin, besting his nearest competitor, conservative evangelist Walter Huss, by a nearly 6–1 margin.


In March 1966, Duncan announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination, which was quickly endorsed by Neuberger. In his speech announcing his candidacy, Duncan reiterated his strong support for President Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s escalation of the Vietnam War with its goal of stopping Communist expansion in Asia. Duncan&#x27;s strong announcement exposed a rift among Oregon Democrats, including Oregon&#x27;s senior Senator Wayne Morse, a leading anti-war voice, and Duncan&#x27;s House colleague, Edith Green. Green had urged Duncan to run, but Duncan&#x27;s hawkish statement troubled her. Soon after Duncan announced his candidacy, Howard Morgan, a former member of the Federal Power Commission, announced he was running as an anti-war option to Duncan. Morgan had the support of Morse and Green (though Green&#x27;s endorsement did not come until the final week of the campaign), and Duncan had the endorsement of most of the party organization and the major newspapers in the state. When the results were announced, Duncan won by a nearly 2–1 margin in one of the first elections in which the Vietnam War was a central issue.



The general election was now set up between two participants whose views on the Vietnam War were in direct opposition to many in their party: Duncan, a pro-war Democrat and Hatfield, an anti-war Republican. With more than three-quarters of Oregonians sharing his view on the war, Duncan used the issue to attack Hatfield, stating that the outcome of the war would determine &quot;whether Americans will die in the buffalo grass of Vietnam or the rye grass of Oregon.&quot; Duncan also stressed that his election was necessary to provide a pro-Government voice for Oregon to counteract the anti-war views of Senator Morse. Morse, who had strongly supported Duncan&#x27;s rival in the primary, now went across party lines and threw his support to Hatfield, though he did not campaign for him.

Hatfield, whose popularity as Governor had made him the favorite in the race, soon found his campaign in trouble. Morse&#x27;s support backfired among many Republicans; Morse had left their party in 1952 to join the Democrats a few years later, and many worried that Hatfield would follow the same path. At a June conference of governors of all 50 states, Hatfield was the lone dissenter on a resolution expressing support for the war, calling the resolution a &quot;blank check&quot; for President Johnson&#x27;s conduct of the war. By the middle of the summer, fueled by the departure of Republican hawks (such as former Oregon State Treasurer and 1962 Senate candidate Sig Unander who wholeheartedly endorsed Duncan), and with a strong majority of voters in the state already registered as Democrats, Duncan surged to a lead in most polls.

While Hatfield did not back away from his war stance, he sought to focus his campaign on other issues, chiefly focusing on the Johnson administration&#x27;s economic policies that, in Hatfield&#x27;s view, had created a recession that was creating unemployment in Oregon&#x27;s timber industry. As the election neared in early fall, Hatfield had pulled even with Duncan with momentum on his side. Hatfield won in 27 of Oregon&#x27;s 36 counties en route to a solid but narrow 52%-48% victory. In his victory speech, Hatfield maintained that the vote was not a referendum on the war and that &quot;neither Hanoi nor Washington should misread the results.&quot;



Hatfield would be re-elected to five more terms, most comfortably, before retiring from the Senate in 1996. Duncan sought revenge against Morse in the Democratic primary of the 1968 Senate election, but came in second in a close three-way primary that he might have won had not a third candidate drawn off some anti-Morse votes. After Morse&#x27;s loss to Bob Packwood in the 1968 general election, Duncan and Morse again squared off for the Democratic nomination in the 1972 Senate election to face Hatfield. Morse won again, and lost to Hatfield in the general election. In 1974, Duncan was re-elected to the House of Representatives. He served three terms before being defeated in the Democratic primary by Ron Wyden in 1980.
== Rhode Island ==

Democratic incumbent Claiborne Pell was reelected to a second term over Republican challenger Ruth M. Briggs.



== South Carolina ==

There were two elections, due to the death of Olin D. Johnston in 1965.

=== South Carolina (regular) ===
Incumbent Strom Thurmond, who had switched parties from Democratic to Republican in 1964, easily defeated state senator Bradley Morrah in the general election.

The two Democrats who could have defeated Thurmond competed against each other in the special election to serve the remaining two years of Olin D. Johnston&#x27;s six-year term. As a result, little known state senator Bradley Morrah of Greenville won the South Carolina Democratic Party primary election on June 14 against John Bolt Culbertson to become the nominee in the general election.

Senator Strom Thurmond faced no opposition from South Carolina Republicans and avoided a primary election.

Morrah faced an uphill struggle against Senator Thurmond because the Democratic resources were primarily poured into the special election to help Fritz Hollings and in the gubernatorial contest for Robert Evander McNair. Furthermore, Thurmond refused to debate Morrah and Thurmond boasted of the endorsements he received from Southern Democratic senators Richard Russell Jr., John C. Stennis, and Herman Talmadge. Morrah was easily dispatched by Thurmond in the general election and he also lost re-election to his state senate seat. He would never again hold public office, which was a routine occurrence for Thurmond&#x27;s opponents.




=== South Carolina (special) ===
The election resulted from the death of Senator Olin D. Johnston in 1965. Then-Governor Donald S. Russell entered in a prearranged agreement with Lieutenant Governor Robert Evander McNair in which Russell would resign his post so that he could be appointed Senator. However, former Governor Fritz Hollings won the Democratic primary election and went on to beat Republican state senator Marshall Parker in the general election to fill the remaining two years of the unexpired term.

In the 1962 gubernatorial election, Donald S. Russell had stated that he would serve out a full term and not seek a higher office. However, midway through his term he resigned from the governorship so that he could be appointed to the United States Senate. Russell faced a challenge in the Democratic primary from former Governor Fritz Hollings, who had lost to Olin D. Johnston in the 1962 primary for the same Senate seat. On June 14, the South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary election and Hollings scored a comfortable victory over Russell to become the Democratic nominee.

The South Carolina Republican Party was in the beginning stages of becoming a major political party in South Carolina politics. It had few elected officials in the state and when state senator Marshall Parker from Oconee County sought the Republican nomination, he did not face any opposition.

Parker faced an uphill battle in winning the Senate seat. First, the state was dominated by the Democratic Party and any Republican politician faced a tough time seeking election. However, there was hope for Republicans because Barry Goldwater had won the state in the 1964 presidential election. Nevertheless, most of the resources of the Republican party were allocated for Strom Thurmond&#x27;s re-election campaign and Joseph O. Rogers Jr.&#x27;s unsuccessful gubernatorial election bid. In spite of these challenges, Parker was able to kept the race close and almost unseated Hollings in the general election.
 

Hollings&#x27;s first Senate victory was also his closest and he was easily re-elected in 1968 (full term), 1974, 1980, and 1986, with somewhat tougher races in 1992 and 1998, although neither with a margin as narrow as that of his initial election. He eventually became seventh longest-serving senator in history (just behind Robert Byrd, Thurmond, Ted Kennedy, Daniel Inouye, Carl Hayden and John C. Stennis). He and Thurmond were also the longest-serving Senate duo. Because of this, despite his length of service, Hollings spent 36 years as the junior Senator, even though - with his penultimate term - he had gained seniority of all but four of his colleagues - Byrd, Thurmond, Inouye and Kennedy. Hollings went on to become a nationally important political figure, e.g., serving as Chairman of the Budget committee.
== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican Karl Mundt was reelected to a fourth term over Democratic state legislator Donn Wright.



== Tennessee ==

Republican Howard Baker won the U.S. Senate election in Tennessee, he defeated the Democratic nominee, Frank G. Clement.



== Texas ==

Incumbent Republican John Tower was reelected to a second term, defeating Democratic State Attorney General Waggoner Carr.



== Virginia ==

There were two elections, due to the resignation of Harry F. Byrd Sr. in 1965.

=== Virginia (regular) ===

Democratic State Senator William B. Spong Jr. narrowly defeated incumbent A. Willis Robertson in the Democratic primary, than defeated Republican James P. Ould Jr. and Independent F. Lee Hawthorne.




=== Virginia (special) ===
Incumbent Senator Harry F. Byrd Sr. had resigned the previous year for health reasons, and his son Harry F. Byrd Jr. had been appointed to replace him. Byrd defeated Republican Lawrence M. Traylor and independent candidate John W. Carter, and was able to finish the rest of his father&#x27;s term.

<doc id="1177590" wikidata="Q212947" url="?curid=1177590" title="Châtillon, Hauts-de-Seine">
<text>Châtillon () is a commune in the southwestern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris.

The town was formerly named &quot;Châtillon-sous-Bagneux&quot;, and a relic of this denomination remains in at least one road sign in Vanves (located at the junction Boulevard du Lycée and Avenue Charles de Gaulle, and written as &quot;Châtillon s/ B&quot;).

The TGV trains are maintained at the &quot;Établissement Industriel de
Maintenance du TGV de Châtillon&quot; (EIM TGV de Châtillon).

==History==
The name of the town is first documented in 1192 in the archives of St-Martin-des-Champs Priory in Medieval Latin as &quot;Castellio&quot; (&quot;little castle&quot;). It is not known where this castle was located. Two possible locations are the heights of Châtillon (to the southwest) or in the former market town on the manor. This manor was owned by the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés until 1600, when it was sold to Richard Tardieu. The small town grew slowly. During the 14th century a chapel dedicated to a Saint Eutropius was built and a parish established. In addition to agriculture, the exploitation of a rock quarry provided an economic basis for the town.

In 1417, during the Armagnac–Burgundian Civil War, John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy, camped at Châtillon for eight days while his army pillaged the surrounding villages before laying siege to Montlhéry.

From 1790 to 1795 Châtillon was a canton of the district of Bourg-de-l&#x27;Égalité.

In 1815 the British, who had crossed the Seine at Sèvres, occupied the heights of Châtillon and pillaged the village. The Tour des Anglais, located in southwest part of the town, was built on the ruins of a former tower that was part of the fortifications of the area, and was later used as a windmill. During that year a quick and lively engagement with enemy English and Prussian troops took place near the tower.

During the Siege of Paris, Châtillon was the site of two battles: the First Battle of Châtillon (17–19 September 1870) as the Prussian army invested Paris, and the Second Battle of Châtillon (13 October 1870), in which the II Bavarian Corps was driven from Châtillon, although ultimately the French were forced to retire in face of Prussian artillery.

==Transport==
Châtillon is served by Châtillon – Montrouge station on Paris Métro Line 13.

Châtillon enjoys a well connected bus service: from Paris, the 68 comes all the way from the Place de Clichy to the metro station. Buses 194, 195 and 295 all leave Porte d&#x27;Orléans and pass by the Châtillon – Montrouge metro station from where they continue mostly in different directions. The 162 running east and west of Châtillon can take you to the RER station in Meudon, or the shopping centre to the east. The 394 which passes by the market is ideal for Clamart, Vanves, and Issy-les-Moulineaux. If you need to get to Issy from the metro, then take the 126.

Châtillon also hosts music festivals.

<doc id="1177591" wikidata="Q4348259" url="?curid=1177591" title="1964 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1964 United States Senate elections were held on November 3. The 33 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. They coincided with the election of President Lyndon B. Johnson by an overwhelming majority, to a full term. His Democratic Party picked up a net two seats from the Republicans. , this was the last time either party has had a two-thirds majority in the Senate, which allowed the Senate Democrats to override a veto, propose constitutional amendments, or convict and expel certain officials without any votes from Senate Republicans. However, internal divisions would have prevented the Democrats from having done so. The Senate election cycle coincided with Democratic gains in the House in the same year.

In a close race in Nevada, Democratic incumbent Howard Cannon won re-election over Republican Lieutenant Governor Paul Laxalt by fewer than 100 votes. Laxalt joined Cannon in the Senate when he won Nevada&#x27;s other seat in 1974. Patrick V. McNamara (D–Michigan) later died on April 30, 1966, and was replaced on May 11, 1966, by appointee Robert P. Griffin (R), reducing Democrats&#x27; majority to 67–33.

Notably, of the 35 seats up for election this year, 26 were held by Democrats, who managed to retain 25 of them. A party defending two-thirds of the seats up for election would not make net gains in the Senate again until 2012. Coincidentally, it would be the same Senate class, class 1.

Governor of Arizona Paul Fannin ran unopposed in the Republican primary, and defeated Democratic nominee Roy Elson, who was a staff member for U.S. senator Carl Hayden until Hayden&#x27;s retirement in 1969. Despite a landslide loss throughout the country, and Goldwater only able to obtain 50.45% of the vote in his home state of Arizona, Fannin managed to prevail in the state&#x27;s Senate election. Goldwater would win the election for the other Senate seat in 1968 when Hayden retired from the post and serving two more terms.

== Massachusetts ==

Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy, who had won a special election two years earlier, defeated his challengers to win his second (his first full) Senate term. Much of the campaign-appearance burden on behalf of Ted Kennedy fell on his wife, Joan, because of Ted&#x27;s serious back injury in a plane crash.

== Minnesota ==

Incumbent Democrat Eugene McCarthy defeated Republican challenger Wheelock Whitney Jr. to win a second term.

Stennis received 97% of the vote in the Democratic primary and faced no Republican challenger in the general election.



== Missouri ==

Democratic incumbent Stuart Symington was reelected to a third term in a landslide, defeating Republican candidate Jean Paul Bradshaw.



== Montana ==

Incumbent Democrat Mike Mansfield, who was first elected to the Senate in 1952 and was re-elected in 1958, ran for re-election. Mansfield won the Democratic primary in a landslide, and advanced to the general election, where he faced Alex Blewett, the Majority Leader of the Montana House of Representatives and the Republican nominee. Though Mansfield&#x27;s margin was significantly reduced from 1958, he still overwhelmingly defeated Blewett and won his third term in the Senate.







== Nebraska ==

Republican incumbent Roman Hruska was reelected in a landslide over Democratic challenger Raymond Arndt.



== Nevada ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Howard Cannon won re-election to a second term by a razor-thin margin of only 48 votes over Republican Lieutenant Governor Paul Laxalt.




== New Jersey ==

Democratic incumbent Harrison A. Williams was reelected to a second term over Republican candidate Bernard M. Shanley, a former white house staffer during the Eisenhower administration.




== New Mexico ==
=== New Mexico (regular) ===


Incumbent Republican Edwin L. Mechem, who had been appointed to the seat following the death of Democrat Dennis Chávez two years earlier, sought election to a full term, but was defeated by Democrat Joseph Montoya.

Montoya was Lieutenant Governor of New Mexico (1947–1951 and 1955–1957) and a four-term member of the U.S. House of Representatives (1957–1964).




=== New Mexico (special) ===

Montoya was also elected to finish the term ending January 3, 1965.

== New York ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kenneth Keating ran for re-election to a second term, but was defeated by Robert F. Kennedy, the former United States Attorney General and brother of former President John F. Kennedy and Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy.

The Socialist Labor state convention met on March 29, and nominated John Emanuel. The Republican state convention met on August 31, and re-nominated the incumbent U.S. Senator Kenneth B. Keating. The Conservative state convention met on August 31 at Saratoga Springs, New York, and nominated Prof. Henry Paolucci. The Democratic state convention met on September 1, and nominated U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on the first ballot, with 968 votes against 153 for Congressman Samuel S. Stratton. The Liberal Party met on September 1, and endorsed the Democratic nominee, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The Socialist Workers Party filed a petition to nominate candidates on September 7. Richard Garza was nominated.

John English, a Nassau County leader who helped John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election, encouraged Robert Kennedy to oppose Keating. At the time, Samuel S. Stratton, a member of the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 35th congressional district, was considered the most likely Democratic candidate. At first, Kennedy resisted. After President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Robert Kennedy remained as Attorney General for Lyndon B. Johnson. However, Johnson and Kennedy feuded. Kennedy decided to run for the Senate in New York in August, and resigned from the Cabinet on September 3, 1964. While many reform Democrats resisted Kennedy, support from Robert F. Wagner Jr., and party bosses like Charles A. Buckley, of The Bronx, and Peter J. Crotty, of Buffalo, helped Kennedy win the nomination at the party convention.

During the campaign, Kennedy was frequently met by large crowds. Keating accused Kennedy of being a carpetbagger from Massachusetts. Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, &quot;If the senator of the state of New York is going be selected on who&#x27;s lived here the longest, then I think people are going vote for my opponent. If it&#x27;s going be selected on who&#x27;s got the best New York accent, then I think I&#x27;m probably out too. But I think if it&#x27;s going be selected on the basis of who can make the best United States senator, I think I&#x27;m still in the contest.&quot;

The Democratic/Liberal candidate was elected. Campaign help from President Lyndon B. Johnson, as well as the Democratic landslide after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, helped carry Kennedy into office, as Kennedy polled about 1.1 million votes less in New York than Johnson did. The incumbent Keating was defeated.
(For Total Votes, the Democratic and Liberal votes for Kennedy are combined.)
== North Dakota ==

Incumbent Democratic-NPL Senator Quentin Burdick sought and received re-election to his second term, defeating Republican candidate Thomas S. Kleppe, who later became the United States Secretary of the Interior.

Only Burdick filed as a Democratic-NPLer, and the endorsed Republican candidate was Thomas S. Kleppe, who would go on to serve two terms as a Representative for North Dakota&#x27;s second congressional district from 1967 to 1971. Burdick and Kleppe won the primary elections for their respective parties.


== Ohio ==

Democratic incumbent Stephen M. Young narrowly won reelection to a second term over Republican Congressman Robert Taft Jr., the son of former Senator Robert A. Taft and grandson of former President William Howard Taft.

Taft would go on to win the seat in the next election, serving one term in the Senate.




== Oklahoma (special) ==

This election was to determine who would serve for the final two years of the term to which Robert S. Kerr had been elected in 1960. Kerr had died in January 1963, and outgoing Governor J. Howard Edmondson was appointed to take his place. Edmondson hoped to win the special election, but lost the Democratic primary to former state senator Fred R. Harris, who then won the general election over University of Oklahoma football coach Bud Wilkinson.



== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Hugh Scott successfully sought re-election to a second term, defeating Democratic nominee Genevieve Blatt.





== Rhode Island ==

Democratic incumbent John Pastore won reelection to a third full term (and fourth overall), defeating Republican candidate Ronald Lagueux by more than 65 percentage points.




== Tennessee ==
=== Tennessee (regular) ===

Incumbent Democrat Albert Gore Sr. was re-elected to a third term over Republican candidate Dan Kuykendall.



=== Tennessee (special) ===


Democratic Congressman Ross Bass won the special election to serve the remaining 26 months of the term to which the late Estes Kefauver had been elected in 1960. He defeated Republican candidate Howard Baker, who would go on to win the seat in the regular election two years later.



== Texas ==

Incumbent Democrat Ralph Yarborough defeated future President of the United States George H. W. Bush.

Although Yarborough won this election, he would lose the Democratic Primary six years later, in 1970, to Lloyd Bentsen. Bush later went on to win an election for the United States House of Representatives in 1966; he was elected vice president of the United States in 1980 and was elected president in 1988.




== Utah ==

Democratic incumbent Frank Moss was reelected to a second term over Republican candidate Ernest L. Wilkinson, the president of Brigham Young University.

<text>Ellipsometry is an optical technique for investigating the dielectric properties (complex refractive index or dielectric function) of thin films. Ellipsometry measures the change of polarization upon reflection or transmission and compares it to a model.

It can be used to characterize composition, roughness, thickness (depth), crystalline nature, doping concentration, electrical conductivity and other material properties. It is very sensitive to the change in the optical response of incident radiation that interacts with the material being investigated.

A spectroscopic ellipsometer can be found in most thin film analytical labs. Ellipsometry is also becoming more interesting to researchers in other disciplines such as biology and medicine. These areas pose new challenges to the technique, such as measurements on unstable liquid surfaces and microscopic imaging.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;ellipsometry&quot; stems from the fact that elliptical polarization of light is used. The term &quot;spectroscopic&quot; relates to the fact that the information gained is a function of the light&#x27;s wavelength or energy (spectra). The technique has been known at least since 1888 by the work of Paul Drude and has many applications today.

The first documented use of the term &quot;ellipsometry&quot; was in 1945.

==Basic principles==
The measured signal is the change in polarization as the incident radiation (in a known state) interacts with the material structure of interest (reflected, absorbed, scattered, or transmitted). The polarization change is quantified by the amplitude ratio, Ψ, and the phase difference, Δ (defined below). Because the signal depends on the thickness as well as the material properties, ellipsometry can be a universal tool for contact free determination of thickness and optical constants of films of all kinds.

Upon the analysis of the change of polarization of light, ellipsometry can yield information about layers that are thinner than the wavelength of the probing light itself, even down to a single atomic layer. Ellipsometry can probe the complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor, which gives access to fundamental physical parameters like those listed above. It is commonly used to characterize film thickness for single layers or complex multilayer stacks ranging from a few angstroms or tenths of a nanometer to several micrometers with an excellent accuracy.

==Experimental details==
Typically, ellipsometry is done only in the reflection setup. The exact nature of the polarization change is determined by the sample&#x27;s properties (thickness, complex refractive index or dielectric function tensor). Although optical techniques are inherently diffraction-limited, ellipsometry exploits phase information (polarization state), and can achieve sub-nanometer resolution. In its simplest form, the technique is applicable to thin films with thickness of less than a nanometer to several micrometers. Most models assume the sample is composed of a small number of discrete, well-defined layers that are optically homogeneous and isotropic. Violation of these assumptions requires more advanced variants of the technique (see below).

Methods of immersion or multiangular ellipsometry are applied to find the optical constants of the material with rough sample surface or presence of inhomogeneous media. New methodological approaches allow the use of reflection ellipsometry to measure physical and technical characteristics of gradient elements in case the surface layer of the optical detail is inhomogeneous.

===Experimental setup===

Electromagnetic radiation is emitted by a light source and linearly polarized by a polarizer. It can pass through an optional compensator (retarder, quarter wave plate) and falls onto the sample. After reflection the radiation passes a compensator (optional) and a second polarizer, which is called an analyzer, and falls into the detector. Instead of the compensators, some ellipsometers use a phase-modulator in the path of the incident light beam. Ellipsometry is a specular optical technique (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). The incident and the reflected beam span the &quot;plane of incidence&quot;. Light which is polarized parallel to this plane is named &quot;p-polarized&quot;. A polarization direction perpendicular is called &quot;s-polarized&quot; (&quot;s&quot;-polarised), accordingly. The &quot;s&quot; is contributed from the German &quot;&quot; (perpendicular).

===Data acquisition===
Ellipsometry measures the complex reflectance ratio formula_1 of a system, which may be parametrized by the amplitude component formula_2 and the phase difference formula_3. The polarization state of the light incident upon the sample may be decomposed into an &quot;s&quot; and a &quot;p&quot; component (the &quot;s&quot; component is oscillating perpendicular to the plane of incidence and parallel to the sample surface, and the &quot;p&quot; component is oscillating parallel to the plane of incidence). The amplitudes of the &quot;s&quot; and &quot;p&quot; components, after reflection and normalized to their initial value, are denoted by formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. The angle of incidence is chosen close to the Brewster angle of the sample to ensure a maximal difference in formula_5 and formula_4. Ellipsometry measures the complex reflectance ratio formula_1 (a complex quantity), which is the ratio of formula_5 over formula_4:
: formula_11
Thus, formula_12 is the amplitude ratio upon reflection, and formula_3 is the phase shift (difference). (Note that the right side of the equation is simply another way to represent a complex number.) Since ellipsometry is measuring the ratio (or difference) of two values (rather than the absolute value of either), it is very robust, accurate, and reproducible. For instance, it is relatively insensitive to scatter and fluctuations and requires no standard sample or reference beam.

===Data analysis===
Ellipsometry is an indirect method, i.e. in general the measured formula_2 and formula_3 cannot be converted directly into the optical constants of the sample. Normally, a model analysis must be performed, for example the Forouhi Bloomer model. This is one weakness of ellipsometry. Models can be physically based on energy transitions or simply free parameters used to fit the data. 
Direct inversion of formula_2 and formula_3 is only possible in very simple cases of isotropic, and infinitely thick films. In all other cases a layer model must be established, which considers the optical constants (refractive index or dielectric function tensor) and thickness parameters of all individual layers of the sample including the correct layer sequence. Using an iterative procedure (least-squares minimization) unknown optical constants and/or thickness parameters are varied, and formula_2 and formula_3 values are calculated using the Fresnel equations. The calculated formula_2 and formula_3 values which match the experimental data best provide the optical constants and thickness parameters of the sample.

==Definitions==
Modern ellipsometers are complex instruments that incorporate a wide variety of radiation sources, detectors, digital electronics and software. The range of wavelength employed is far in excess of what is visible so strictly these are no longer optical instruments.

===Single-wavelength vs. spectroscopic ellipsometry===
Single-wavelength ellipsometry employs a monochromatic light source. This is usually a laser in the visible spectral region, for instance, a HeNe laser with a wavelength of 632.8 nm. Therefore, single-wavelength ellipsometry is also called laser ellipsometry. The advantage of laser ellipsometry is that laser beams can be focused on a small spot size. Furthermore, lasers have a higher power than broad band light sources. Therefore, laser ellipsometry can be used for imaging (see below). However, the experimental output is restricted to one set of formula_2 and formula_3 values per measurement. Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) employs broad band light sources, which cover a certain spectral range in the infrared, visible or ultraviolet spectral region. By that the complex refractive index or the dielectric function tensor in the corresponding spectral region can be obtained, which gives access to a large number of fundamental physical properties. Infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry (IRSE) can probe lattice vibrational (phonon) and free charge carrier (plasmon) properties. Spectroscopic ellipsometry in the near infrared, visible up to ultraviolet spectral region studies the refractive index in the transparency or below-band-gap region and electronic properties, for instance, band-to-band transitions or excitons.

===Standard vs. generalized ellipsometry (anisotropy)===
Standard ellipsometry (or just short &#x27;ellipsometry&#x27;) is applied, when no &quot;s&quot; polarized light is converted into &quot;p&quot; polarized light nor vice versa. This is the case for optically isotropic samples, for instance, amorphous materials or crystalline materials with a cubic crystal structure. Standard ellipsometry is also sufficient for optically uniaxial samples in the special case, when the optical axis is aligned parallel to the surface normal. In all other cases, when &quot;s&quot; polarized light is converted into &quot;p&quot; polarized light and/or vice versa, the generalized ellipsometry approach must be applied. Examples are arbitrarily aligned, optically uniaxial samples, or optically biaxial samples.

===Jones matrix vs. Mueller matrix formalism (depolarization)===
There are typically two different ways of mathematically describing how an electromagnetic wave interacts with the elements within an ellipsometer (including the sample): the Jones matrix and the Mueller matrix formalisms. In the Jones matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by a Jones vector with two orthogonal complex-valued entries for the electric field (typically formula_24 and formula_25), and the effect that an optical element (or sample) has on it is described by the complex-valued 2×2 Jones matrix. In the Mueller matrix formalism, the electromagnetic wave is described by Stokes vectors with four real-valued entries, and their transformation is described by the real-valued 4x4 Mueller matrix. When no depolarization occurs both formalisms are fully consistent. Therefore, for non-depolarizing samples, the simpler Jones matrix formalism is sufficient. If the sample is depolarizing the Mueller matrix formalism should be used, because it also gives the amount of depolarization. Reasons for depolarization are, for instance, thickness non-uniformity or backside-reflections from a transparent substrate.

==Advanced experimental approaches==

===Imaging ellipsometry===
Ellipsometry can also be done as imaging ellipsometry by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates on the principle of classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532 nm green laser light. Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into elliptically polarized light. This elliptically polarized light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.

The orientation of the angles of P and C are chosen in such a way that the elliptically polarized light is completely linearly polarized after it is reflected off the sample. For simplification of future calculations, the compensator can be fixed at a 45 degree angle relative to the plane of incidence of the laser beam. This set up requires the rotation of the analyzer and polarizer in order to achieve null conditions. The ellipsometric null condition is obtained when A is perpendicular with respect to the polarization axis of the reflected light achieving complete destructive interference, i.e., the state at which the absolute minimum of light flux is detected at the CCD camera. The angles of P, C, and A obtained are used to determine the Ψ and Δ values of the material.
: formula_26 and formula_27
where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;P&quot; are the angles of the analyzer and polarizer under null conditions respectively. By rotating the analyzer and polarizer and measuring the change in intensities of light over the image, analysis of the measured data by use of computerized optical modeling can lead to a deduction of spatially resolved film thickness and complex refractive index values.

Due to the fact that the imaging is done at an angle, only a small line of the entire field of view is actually in focus. The line in focus can be moved along the field of view by adjusting the focus. In order to analyze the entire region of interest, the focus must be incrementally moved along the region of interest with a photo taken at each position. All of the images are then compiled into a single, in focus image of the sample.

===In situ ellipsometry===
In situ ellipsometry refers to dynamic measurements during the modification process of a sample. This process can be used to study, for instance, the growth of a thin film, including calcium phosphate mineralization at the air-liquid interface, etching or cleaning of a sample. By in situ ellipsometry measurements it is possible to determine fundamental process parameters, such as, growth or etch rates, variation of optical properties with time. In situ ellipsometry measurements require a number of additional considerations: The sample spot is usually not as easily accessible as for ex situ measurements outside the process chamber. Therefore, the mechanical setup has to be adjusted, which can include additional optical elements (mirrors, prisms, or lenses) for redirecting or focusing the light beam. Because the environmental conditions during the process can be harsh, the sensitive optical elements of the ellipsometry setup must be separated from the hot zone. In the simplest case this is done by optical view ports, though strain induced birefringence of the (glass-) windows has to be taken into account or minimized. Furthermore, the samples can be at elevated temperatures, which implies different optical properties compared to samples at room temperature. Despite all these problems, in situ ellipsometry becomes more and more important as process control technique for thin film deposition and modification tools. In situ ellipsometers can be of single-wavelength or spectroscopic type. Spectroscopic in situ ellipsometers use multichannel detectors, for instance CCD detectors, which measure the ellipsometric parameters for all wavelengths in the studied spectral range simultaneously.

===Ellipsometric porosimetry===
Ellipsometric porosimetry measures the change of the optical properties and thickness of the materials during adsorption and desorption of a volatile species at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure depending on the application. The EP technique is unique in its ability to measure porosity of very thin films down to 10 nm, its reproducibility and speed of measurement. Compared to traditional porosimeters, Ellipsometer porosimeters are well suited to very thin film pore size and pore size distribution measurement. Film porosity is a key factor in silicon based technology using low-κ materials, organic industry (encapsulated organic light-emitting diodes) as well as in the coating industry using sol gel techniques.

===Magneto-optic generalized ellipsometry===
Magneto-optic generalized ellipsometry (MOGE) is an advanced infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry technique for studying free charge carrier properties in conducting samples. By applying an external magnetic field it is possible to determine independently the density, the optical mobility parameter and the effective mass parameter of free charge carriers. Without the magnetic field only two out of the three free charge carrier parameters can be extracted independently.

==Applications==
This technique has found applications in many different fields, from semiconductor physics to microelectronics and biology, from basic research to industrial applications. Ellipsometry is a very sensitive measurement technique and provides unequaled capabilities for thin film metrology. As an optical technique, spectroscopic ellipsometry is non-destructive and contactless. Because the incident radiation can be focused, small sample sizes can be imaged and desired characteristics can be mapped over a larger area (m2).

==Advantages==
Ellipsometry has a number of advantages compared to standard reflection intensity measurements:

* Ellipsometry measures at least two parameters at each wavelength of the spectrum. If generalized ellipsometry is applied up to 16 parameters can be measured at each wavelength.
* Ellipsometry measures an intensity ratio instead of pure intensities. Therefore, ellipsometry is less affected by intensity instabilities of the light source or atmospheric absorption.
* By using polarized light, normal ambient unpolarized stray light does not significantly influence the measurement, no dark box is necessary.
* No reference measurement is necessary.
Ellipsometry is especially superior to reflectivity measurements when studying anisotropic samples.

<text>Francis Guthrie (born 22 January 1831 in London; d. 19 October 1899 in Claremont, Cape Town) was a Cape Colony mathematician and botanist who first posed the Four Colour Problem in 1852. He studied mathematics under Augustus De Morgan, and botany under John Lindley at University College London. Guthrie obtained his B.A. in 1850, and LL.B. in 1852 with first class honours. While colouring a map of the counties of England, he noticed that at least four colours were required so that no two regions sharing a common border were the same colour. He postulated that four colours would be sufficient to colour any map. This became known as the Four Color Problem, and remained one of the most famous unsolved problems in graph theory for more than a century until it was eventually proven in 1976 using a lengthy computer-aided proof by Appel and Haken.

Guthrie arrived in South Africa on 10 April 1861 and was met and entertained by Dr Dale (later Sir Langham Dale), who was instrumental in the establishing of the University of the Cape of Good Hope in June 1873. Guthrie took up the post of mathematics master at the Graaff-Reinet College. While there he gave a course of acclaimed public lectures on botany in 1862 and thus started a lifelong friendship with local resident Harry Bolus. He advised Bolus to take up the study of botany to ease his grief at the loss of his six-year-old son. When Bolus left for Cape Town a few years later, he persuaded Guthrie to move there as well in 1875. For a while, he practised at the Bar and edited a newspaper before becoming the professor of mathematics at the South African College, which later became the University of Cape Town. He remained there from 1876 until he retired in 1898, staying on his farm at Raapenberg.

When Bolus undertook to do the family of Ericaceae for &quot;Flora Capensis&quot;, he enlisted Guthrie&#x27;s aid and they collaborated until Guthrie&#x27;s death. Before his death, Guthrie had made an extensive collection of the Cape Peninsula flora, which was eventually housed as the Guthrie Herbarium in the University of Cape Town Botany Department, and used for teaching and reference. Though Guthrie did not live to see the published work, he had the satisfaction of knowing that the greater part of the work on &quot;Erica&quot; had been completed. He is buried in the old cemetery attached to St. Thomas&#x27;s Church in Rondebosch.

He was described as being warm-hearted, good-humoured, patient, and unpretentious. The scope of his interests was diverse and ranged from a lecture titled, &quot;The Heat of the Sun in South Africa&quot;, in which he pointed out that it must be possible to transform solar energy into mechanical power, to aeronautics, where he was involved in the development of the first aircraft. Although dubbed the inventor of the first flying machine, no documentation of his work exists.

Some fynbos species from the Bredasdorp area were named after him: &quot;Gladiolus guthriei&quot;, &quot;Erica guthriei&quot; and &quot;Homoglossum guthriei&quot;, as well as the genus &quot;Guthriea&quot; Bolus. &quot;Cyrtanthus guthrieae&quot; was named after his daughter Louisa Guthrie, who was also a botanist. The new genus &quot;Guthriea&quot; was collected by Harry Bolus from Oudeberg in the Graaff-Reinet district, and also recorded from the Wittebergen in the Barkly East district and Mont-aux-Sources in Natal. To date no other species in this genus have been found.

Guthrie was an early member of the &quot;South African Philosophical Society&quot; (later the &quot;Royal Society of South Africa&quot;), an active member of the &quot;Meteorological Commission&quot; and an examiner of the Cape University.

<text>Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland (also known as FoE EWNI) is one of 70 national groups around the world which make up the Friends of the Earth network of environmental organisations. It is usually referred to as just &#x27;Friends of the Earth&#x27; within its home countries.

==History==
Friends of the Earth in England was founded in 1971, two years after the group was first founded in San Francisco in 1969. Its first leader was Graham Searle, a former vice president of the National Union of Students. In 1975, Searle documented the New Zealand Beech Forest Controversy for Friends of the Earth during a year&#x27;s sabbatical in that country. One of the early campaigns of the newly founded organisation was to dump almost 1000 glass bottles in front of the HQ of soft drinks giant Schweppes in Connaught House, London in protest at the company&#x27;s policy of having non-returnable bottles. Other initial activities focused on opposing an open cast copper mine in the Snowdonia National Park (which led to an early victory when this was stopped) and on work to save endangered species. This grew into the world-wide &#x27;Save the Whale&#x27; campaigns by FoE, Greenpeace and others.

Campaigning for safe energy was also an early issue, in which FoE EWNI were supported by US expert Amory Lovins. Opposition to nuclear power and support for renewable energy was a core campaign issue which developed into work on climate change – now in 2020 the central theme for FoE EWNI work.

Local action across the UK is a distinguishing feature of FoE EWNI, which has a network of licensed &#x27;local groups&#x27; that enjoy a degree of autonomy over the issues on which they work. Soon after the launch in 1971 there were eight local branches and by 1976 there were 140. In 1978 groups in Scotland split off to form their own organisation, FoE Scotland. In 1980 FoE had 250 groups and 17,000 registered supporters, but the growth of the peace movement and CND from 1980–84 saw support move away and FoE downsizing to 12 staff.

In 1984 Jonathan Porritt, a former teacher and chairman of the Ecology Party (renamed the Green Party in 1985), became the director of the organisation. Porritt left in 1990, by which time membership had grown to 226,000 and staff numbers from 12 to over 100.

The next executive director was Dave Gee, followed by Charles Secrett who held the position till 2003. Between 2003 and 2008, FoE EWNI&#x27;s executive director was Tony Juniper who in 2019 became Chair of Natural England. From 2006–2008 FoE played a lead role in the campaign (known as the &#x27;Big Ask&#x27;) for a UK Climate Act, which became law in 2008. From 2015–2020 Craig Bennett was Chief Executive, who left to become Director of the Wildlife Trusts. From January 2021 until July 2024, Miriam Turner and Hugh Knowles were Co-CEOs. Jamie Peters was appointed Chief Executive (Interim) in July 2024.

==Structure and funding==

FoE EWNI has a dual structure, comprising a trust, which is a registered charity, and a limited company, which carries out political campaigning – UK legislation limits how far a charity may campaign.

Total income for Friends of the Earth Ltd. for the year ending May 2019 was £11.2m of which about £8m was a grant from the FoE Charitable Trust.

<text>The Gūr-i Amīr or Guri Amir (, ) is a mausoleum of the Turkic conqueror Timur (also known as Tamerlane) in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. It occupies an important place in the history of Turkestan&#x27;s architecture as the precursor for and had influence on later Mughal architecture tombs, including Gardens of Babur in Kabul, Humayun&#x27;s Tomb in Delhi and the Taj Mahal in Agra, built by Timur&#x27;s Indian descendants, Mongols that followed Indian culture with Central Asian influences. Mughals established the ruling Mughal dynasty of the Indian subcontinent. The mausoleum has been heavily restored over the course of its existence.

== Construction ==

Gur-e Amir means &quot;Tomb of the King&quot; in Persian. This architectural complex with its azure dome contains the tombs of Timur, his sons Shah Rukh and Miran Shah and grandsons Ulugh Beg and Muhammad Sultan. Also honoured with a place in the tomb is Timur&#x27;s teacher Sayyid Baraka.

The earliest part of the was built at the end of the 14th century by the orders of Muhammad Sultan. Now only the foundations of the madrasah and khanaka, the entrance portal and a part of one of four minarets remains.

The construction of the mausoleum itself began in 1403 after the sudden death of Muhammad Sultan, Timur&#x27;s heir apparent and his beloved grandson, for whom it was intended. Timur had built himself a smaller tomb in Shahrisabz near his Ak-Saray Palace. However, when Timur died in 1405 on campaign on his military expedition to China, the passes to Shahrisabz were snowed in, so he was buried here instead. Ulugh Beg, another grandson of Timur, completed the work. During his reign the mausoleum became the family crypt of the Timurid dynasty.

== Architecture ==

The entrance portal to the Muhammad Sultan ensemble is richly decorated with carved bricks and various mosaics. All the extensions of Ulugh Beg&#x27;s time are attributed to the architect Muhammad ibn Mahmud from Isfahan.
Outwardly, the Gur-e Amir Mausoleum is a one-cupola building. It is famous for its simplicity of construction and for its solemn monumentality of appearance. It is an octahedral building crowned by an azure dome. The exterior decoration of the walls consists of the blue, light-blue and white tiles organized into geometrical and epigraphic ornaments against a background of terracotta bricks. The dome (diameter – 15 m (49.21 ft), height – 12.5 m (41.01 ft)) is of a bright blue color with deep rosettes and white spots. Heavy ribbed fluting gives an amazing expressiveness to the cupola.

During the reign of Ulugh Beg a doorway was made to provide an entrance into the mausoleum.

Inwardly, the mausoleum appears as a large, high chamber with deep niches at the sides and diverse decoration. The lower part of the walls covered are by onyx slabs composed as one panel. Each of these slabs is decorated with refined paintings. Above the panel there is a marble stalactite cornice. Large expanses of the walls are decorated with painted plaster; the arches and the internal dome are ornamented by high-relief papier-mâché cartouches, gilded and painted.

The ornate carved headstones in the inner room of the mausoleum merely indicate the location of the actual tombs in a crypt directly underneath the main chamber. Under Ulugh Beg&#x27;s government a solid block of dark green jade was placed over the grave of Tamerlane. Formerly this stone had been used at a place of worship in the Chinese emperor&#x27;s palace, then as the throne of Duwa (a descendant of Genghis Khan) in Chagatay Khanate. Next to Tamerlane&#x27;s grave lie the marble tombstones of his sons Miran Shah and Shah Rukh and also of grandsons Muhammad Sultan and Ulugh Beg. Tamerlane&#x27;s spiritual teacher Mir Said Baraka, also rests here.

== History ==
Erected on the initiative and at the expense of Timur in 1404, this masterpiece of Persian architecture of the Timurid era occupies an important place in the history of world Islamic architecture. The main architect of the mausoleum was Muhammad ibn Mahmud Isfahani, a native of the Iranian city of Isfahan.

=== Construction ===

In 1403, after a military campaign against the Ottoman Empire, Muhammad Sultan, Timur&#x27;s heir to the throne, died. Returning to Samarkand in the fall of 1404, Timur ordered for his grandson the building of a mausoleum, which became the family tomb of Gur-e-Amir. The mausoleum was built in the southeastern part of medieval Samarkand, near the madrasa and khanqah of Muhammad Sultan.

Timur died during a campaign in China. In January 1405, he arrived in the city of Otrar (its ruins - near the confluence of Arys into the Syr Darya), where he fell ill and died (18 February according to most historians, 15 February according to the tombstone of Timur). Timur&#x27;s body was embalmed, placed in an ebony coffin upholstered in silver brocade, and contrary to the will of Timur, who willed to be buried in his native Kesh, was taken to Samarkand on the initiative of his grandson Khalil-sultan. Tamerlane was buried in the Gur-e-Amir mausoleum, at that time still unfinished. The official mourning events were held on 18 March 1405 by Timur&#x27;s grandson Khalil-Sultan (1405–1409), who seized the Samarkand throne against the will of his grandfather, who bequeathed the throne to his eldest grandson Pir Muhammed.

During Ulugh Beg&#x27;s reign, the mausoleum became the Timurid family crypt; a doorway was made to provide an entrance to the mausoleum.

=== Later enlargement ===
In this architectural ensemble are the tombs of Timur himself, his sons Shah Rukh (died in 1447 in Herat) and Miran Shah (killed on April 21, 1408 in the vicinity of Tabriz), grandsons - Ulugh Beg (1394–1449) and Muhammad Sultan, also Timurids Abdullo Mirzo, Abdurahmon Mirzo, teacher and mentor of Timur Mir Said Baraka. By the will of Timur&#x27;s youngest son Shah Rukh, Mir Said Baraka&#x27;s remains are buried in the Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum. Timur was a Muslim and an admirer of Sufi orders. The main spiritual mentor of Timur was the descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, Sheikh Mir Said Baraka. He was the one who gave Timur the symbols of power: a drum and a banner when he came to power in 1370. Mir Said Baraka predicted a great future for the Emir. He accompanied Timur on his great campaigns. In 1391 he blessed him before his battle with Tokhtamysh. In 1403 they together mourned the unexpected death of the heir to the throne - Muhammad-Sultan. According to the Arab historian Ibn Arabshah Timur constantly said: &quot;All that I have reached in the state and the strongest countries conquered by me - all this was achieved because of the prayer and blessing of Sheikh Shamsuddin al-Khavoriyyah and all the luck found only from Said Baraka&quot;. Therefore, Timur himself was also buried at his feet.

=== Decline and restoration ===
In 1740, king Nader Shah of the Afsharid Empire tried to carry away Tamerlane&#x27;s sarcophagus. Nader idolized Timur. He imitated Timur&#x27;s military prowess and, later in his reign, Timur&#x27;s cruelty, but in the process of removal the sarcophagus broke in two. This was interpreted as a bad omen. His advisers urged him to return the stone to its rightful place.

Unfortunately, after the end of 17th century Samarkand suffered a long period of decline. The city lost the status of capital to Bukhara. The great Silk Road bypassed the city and its great historical monuments stood empty and forgotten. Only after the Second World War did extensive restoration work in Gur-Emir begin.

Tamerlane&#x27;s tomb was opened shortly before the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 19 June 1941. The exhumation of Timur in 1941 was made under the direction of Soviet scientist and anthropologist Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov, who was able to reconstruct Timur&#x27;s facial features from his skull, and it was also confirmed that he was 172 cm in height and would have walked with a pronounced limp.

In the 1950s the dome, main portal and minarets were refurbished. By that time the maiolica tiles had mostly fallen away. In the 1970s, the restoration of the interior was undertaken. Neither the Madrasah nor the Khanaka of initial Muhammad Sultan&#x27;s complex were reconstructed at that time. With the resurgence of the interest in Tamerlane after the founding of the Republic of Uzbekistan in 1991, care of his places of worship has intensified.

=== Curse of Timur ===

When Soviet scientists wanted to open Timur&#x27;s tomb, rumors went around Samarkand that opening the tomb would curse those who opened it. Local leaders attempted to warn the excavation team of the &quot;risks&quot;.

The tomb is inscribed with two warnings that read &quot;When I rise from the dead, the world shall tremble&quot;. Allegedly, once opened another inscription was discovered: “Whosoever disturbs my tomb will unleash an invader more terrible than I&quot;. Even though people close to Gerasimov claim that this story is a fabrication, the legend persists.

The tomb was opened by Mikhail Mikhaylovich Gerasimov, a Soviet archaeologist on 20 June 1941, two days before the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union.

Apparently, Stalin believed in the curse and ordered Timur be reburied. Tamerlane was reburied with full Islamic burial rites on 20 December 1942, about one month before the Soviet victory at Stalingrad (though by this time the German Army at Stalingrad was already encircled).

== Nearby monuments ==

Some consider the Gur-e Amir, Ruhabad mausoleum and Aksaray mausoleum to be a combined ensemble because of their closeness.

Ruhabad (14th century) is a small mausoleum and is said to contain a hair of Muhammad. The one-story madrasah now accommodates craftsmens&#x27; shops. There is a functioning mosque next door to the madrasah. All three combine into one ensemble.

The Aksaray mausoleum (15th century), recently restored, is located on a quiet street behind Gur-e Amir.

<text>Alan Arnett McLeod, VC (20 April 1899 – 6 November 1918) was a Canadian soldier, aviator, and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. McLeod served as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps and later the Royal Air Force during the First World War.

==Early life==
Alan McLeod grew up in Stonewall, Manitoba, the son of a doctor. He enrolled in The 34th Fort Garry Horse in 1913 at age 14. When the First World War broke out in 1914, McLeod was sent home as under age. He then tried several times to enlist in the army in Winnipeg, and in the cadet wing of the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in Toronto. As he turned 18 he successfully enrolled in the RFC. He trained as a pilot at Long Branch near Toronto, and soloed after only 3 hours flight time. He graduated with 50 hours of flying experience. On 20 August 1917 he was shipped overseas to France.

==First World War==
McLeod was originally posted to No. 82 Squadron RFC flying scouts, but when his commanding officer found he was 18 he had McLeod posted to No. 51 Squadron RFC on Home Defence duties flying at night. McLeod was then posted to No. 2 Squadron RFC, a Corps Squadron working near Hesdigneul in northern France, flying his first operation in December 1917. With Lieutenant Comber as his gunner, he claimed a Fokker Dr.I destroyed in January and on 14 January flamed an observation balloon near Beauvin. He was recommended for mentioned in despatches for this exploit and the exploit that eventually lead to his Victoria Cross.

===Victoria Cross===
McLeod was an 18-year-old second lieutenant in No. 2 Squadron when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

On 27 March 1918 over Albert, France, McLeod, with his observer Lieutenant Arthur Hammond, in an Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 destroyed an enemy triplane and were immediately attacked by eight more, three of which they brought down. During the fight, both McLeod and Hammond were wounded by machine gun bullets, the petrol tank was punctured and the aircraft set on fire. McLeod instantly pushed her over into a very steep side-slip, but the flames were scorching him, and so he jumped out of his cockpit on to the left wing and crouched low, with the joystick pulled hard over in his right hand. Then he smashed a hole through the fabric in the fuselage so that he could reach the rudder-wire with his left hand, and so he guided her towards the lines. In this way he kept the flames away from his wounded observer and prevented the aircraft from burning up. When the machine finally crashed in No Man&#x27;s Land, the young pilot, not minding his own injuries, dragged his comrade from the burning wreckage and under heavy fire carried him to comparative safety, before collapsing from exhaustion and loss of blood.

Leutnant Hans Kirschstein of Jasta 6, an experienced ace was credited with the victory. McLeod was wounded three times in the side and Hammond was wounded six times. Hammond lost a leg but was awarded a Bar to his Military Cross.

McLeod was recommended for a Distinguished Service Order but received the Victoria Cross. He returned to Canada (Stonewall, Manitoba) to recuperate but died from the Spanish Influenza epidemic shortly thereafter. He was only 5 months away from celebrating his 20th birthday.

==Tribute==
Dr. David Christie, of Westminster Church, Winnipeg, wrote a moving tribute which appeared in the &quot;Manitoba Free Press&quot; on the evening of 7 November, the day after McLeod&#x27;s death.

There is a street in Stonewall, Manitoba named after McLeod. His former family home is the McLeod Tea House and Stonewall Collegiate has his likeness as a bust displayed in the high school library.

In 1974 Alan Arnett McLeod, V.C. was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Edmonton, Alberta.

Number 301 (Alan McLeod V.C.) Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Cadets was formed in Stonewall, Manitoba on 29 January 2009.

The primary student quarters at 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School is named the Lt Alan McLeod Building.

On 9 May 2017, a Commonwealth War Graves Commission stone marker and descriptive bronze plaque was placed next to the McLeod family plot, where he is buried along with his mother (Margaret Annett McLeod, 1877–1966) and father (Dr. Alexander Neil McLeod, 1868–1940). It is unique in that Alan McLeod is the only VC recipient who died on active service to be buried in Canada.

<text>This is a list of naval air stations of the Royal Navy. Naval air stations are shore establishments of the Fleet Air Arm (FAA), the branch of the Royal Navy (RN) responsible for the operation of naval aircraft.

Historically, RNAS referred to the Royal Naval Air Service, which was the aviation branch of the Royal Navy. This merged in 1918 with the Royal Flying Corps, of the British Army, to form an independent service, the Royal Air Force (RAF). Currently the abbreviation RNAS stands for &quot;Royal Naval Air Station&quot;, and in common with Royal Air Force station naming convention, is always followed by a geographical place in which the air station is located. 

Between 1918 and 1939, the Royal Air Force had provided the Fleet Air Arm to the Royal Navy, and Royal Naval Air Stations were consequently operated by Royal Air force personnel.

On 24 May 1939, operation of the Fleet Air Arm was returned to full Admiralty control under the &quot;Inskip Award&quot;, with Royal Air Force personnel replaced by Royal Naval personnel, or transferring to the Royal Navy.

As Coastal Command remained part of the Royal Air Force, Royal Naval Air Stations, since 1939, have generally operated ship-borne types of aircraft when it has been necessary for them to be operated from land bases.

== Current naval air stations ==
The current Fleet Air Arm front-line operations are centred on two main operating bases (MOBs), each with a nearby satellite airfield:
(Bold denotes Royal Navy shore establishment, &quot;italics&quot; denotes other controlled airbase with Fleet Air Arm unit)
* RNAS Culdrose (HMS &quot;Seahawk&quot;) – Culdrose, Helston, Cornwall, England - (maritime Merlin operations, Royal Naval School of Flight Deck Operations)
** RNAS Predannack (satellite airfield) – Mullion, Cornwall
* RNAS Yeovilton (HMS &quot;Heron&quot;) – Yeovilton, Somerset, England - (Wildcat Maritime Force (MWF), Commando Helicopter Force (CHF), Joint Aviation Command, Wildcat Demo Team)
** RNAS Merryfield (satellite airfield) – Ilton, Somerset

=== Other airbases ===

Fleet Air Arm front-line operations are supported by other airbases with activity at:

*HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;, which is a forward operating base of the Fleet Air Arm located at Glasgow Prestwick Airport, South Ayrshire in Scotland, used by detachments of Royal Navy Merlin HM2 helicopters which are deployed from RNAS Culdrose as and when required.
*&quot;RAF Marham&quot; - Norfolk, England, the F-35B Lightning II main operating base and a Royal Air Force station, but home to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Fleet Air Arm 809 Naval Air Squadron, which is part of Air Combat Force, under No. 1 Group RAF.

Similarly, second-line operations are also conducted from both RNAS Culdrose, with 750 Naval Air Squadron providing training for Royal Navy Observers and Royal Air Force Weapon Systems Officers (WSOs), and RNAS Yeovilton home to 727 Naval Air Squadron with flight assessment and training, but operations are also supported by other airbases:
*Dedicated aircrew training for all three UK armed services sits with the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS).
**&quot;RAF Barkston Heath&quot; - Lincolnshire, England, home to the Defence Elementary Flying Training School, which includes the Feet Air Arm’s 703 Naval Air Squadron as part of the UKMFTS, and which operates the Grob Prefect T1 in the elementary flying training role.
**&quot;RAF Shawbury&quot; - Shropshire, England. Home of the tri-service No. 1 Flying Training School, which includes the Fleet Air Arm’s 705 Naval Air Squadron, flying the Airbus Juno HT1. Elements of the Central Flying School (Helicopter) Squadron train helicopter flying instructors, and the Defence College of Air and Space Operations trains air traffic controllers for both the RAF and RN.

Several former airbases are operated by defence contractor QinetiQ in the test and evaluation role, with these locations owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD).
*The former Royal Air Force station at Boscombe Down in Wiltshire is the main facility, and this has a Fleet Air Arm presence.
**&quot;MOD Boscombe Down&quot;, Wiltshire, England - Test and evaluation airbase operated by QinetiQ on behalf of the MoD. The Fleet Air Arm&#x27;s 744 Naval Air Squadron is part of the Air and Space Warfare Centre, but predominantly based out of MoD Boscombe Down, and forms part of the Air Test and Evaluation Centre (ATEC).

== Map of stations within the UK ==

Map of the United Kingdom showing active naval air stations, including forward operating bases and satellite airfields, Ministry of Defence (MOD) airfields with a Royal Navy presence and Royal Air Force (RAF) stations with a Royal Navy presence. 

== Former naval air stations ==

When control of the Fleet Air Arm was transferred from the Royal Air Force, four of its existing airbases, in the United Kingdom, were also transferred to the Fleet Air Arm, these were: Donibristle, Lee-on-Solent, Ford, and Worthy Down. At that time when operating overseas, the Fleet Air Arm still needed to rely on lodger facilities at Royal Air Force stations abroad.

During the early period of the Second World War the Royal Navy worked to acquire its own airfields, both in the UK and near to strategic bases abroad. Some of these were purpose built and others were transferred over from the Royal Air Force.

These lists covers Fleet Air Arm establishments, located both on the British Isles and overseas. It includes Air Stations, Air Sections, Air Maintenance &amp; Repair Yards, Lodger units at RAF bases, and training establishments. The bases are listed alphabetically, by geographical location.
Key to the types of establishments:

* BCAS - British Commonwealth Air Station
* MONAB - Mobile Naval Air Base
* RAF - Royal Air Force
* RAAF - Royal Australian Air Force
* RCAF - Royal Canadian Air Force
* RNAS - Royal Naval Air Station
* RNAY - Royal Naval Air Yard
* RNAMY - Royal Naval Aircraft Maintenance Yard
* RNARY - Royal Naval Aircraft Repair Yard
* RNADC - Royal Naval Aircraft Direction Centre
* RNAE - Royal Naval Air Establishment
* RNATE - Royal Naval Aircraft Training Establishment
* RNTE - Royal Naval Training Establishment
* SAAF - South African Air Force
* TAMY - Transportable Aircraft Maintenance Yard
* USAF - United States Air Force
* USNAS - United States Naval Air Station
* USNAF - United States Naval Air Facility

=== British Isles ===

This list is of former air stations of the Royal Navy within the British Isles, consisting of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland), and over six thousand smaller islands. The Channel Islands, off the north coast of France, are normally taken to be part of the British Isles. The list includes airbases wholly operated by the Admiralty and those where RN lodger units operated, sometimes under a RN Air Section.


=== Weapons Ranges ===

List of former Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm air weapons ranges (AWR) within the United Kingdom,&quot;although FAA aircraft have used other weapons ranges in the UK and abroad, operated by other authorities&quot;:


=== Overseas ===

This list is of former air stations of the Royal Navy located outside of the British Isles. The list includes airbases wholly operated by the Admiralty and those where lodger facilities from the RAF were granted and operated under a RN Air Section.

== Mobile Naval Air Base ==

The Mobile Operational Naval Air Base (MONAB) were designed to have all the capabilities of an air station or an aircraft carrier, to support the Fleet Air Arm, and that could be deployed anywhere around the world. There were eleven commissioned units, ten MONABs and one Transportable Aircraft Maintenance Yard (TAMY), ten of these saw active service for the British Pacific Fleet:

== Former naval air stations by ship name (HMS xxx) ==
HMS means His Majesty&#x27;s Ship (or Her Majesty&#x27;s Ship).

Some smaller and some very early Naval Air Stations in the list above were not commissioned as HM Ship(s). Those below were commissioned and, therefore, have a ship&#x27;s name. Royal Navy shore bases and naval air stations have traditionally been named in the same manner as seagoing ships.

Officers were appointed to HMS xxx rather than to RNAS xxx and, similarly, ratings&#x27; Service Certificates will show only the name of the ship when drafted to a Naval Air Station. Thus, this list may help when researching family history records.

<doc id="1177641" wikidata="Q4905439" url="?curid=1177641" title="Big Chief tablet">
<text>The Big Chief tablet is a popular writing notebook designed for young children in the United States. It is made with newsprint paper and features widely spaced lines, easier to use for those learning to write. The tablet has a prominent representation of an American Indian man in full headdress on the cover, hence the name &quot;Big Chief&quot;.

==History==
The tablet was originated by William Albrecht (1879–1945), whose family had a stationery business in Quincy, Illinois. In 1906 he opened the Western Tablet Company in St. Joseph, Missouri, and it became the world&#x27;s largest paper tablet producer. Albrecht&#x27;s home on Frederick Boulevard in St. Joseph is now the Albrecht-Kemper Museum of Art. Big Chief tablets are still available for purchase from the Museum Shop. Western Tablet trademarked the Big Chief in 1947. Western Tablet expanded in the 1920s and moved its headquarters to Dayton, Ohio but most of the manufacturing components remained in St. Joseph. In 1964 the company was renamed &quot;Westab.&quot;

Usage of the Big Chief peaked in the 1960s when another Westab invention—the spiral notebook—began to claim a bigger market share.

In 1966, the Mead Corporation acquired Western Tablet. Mead subsequently sold the Big Chief line to Springfield Tablet of Springfield, Missouri.

In January 2001, Everett Pad and Paper of Everett, Washington, purchased the inventory from Springfield. They closed their plant after 80 years operations, and Big Chief tablet production was halted. The plant in St. Joseph where the tablets were produced was closed in 2004 when Mead left the city.

In 2012, American Trademark Publishing of Brookshire, Texas, resumed the production of the Big Chief Writing Tablet.

<text>The Hauraki Plains are a geographical area located in the northern North Island of New Zealand, at the lower (northern) end of the Thames Valley. They are located 75 kilometres south-east of Auckland, at the foot of the Coromandel Peninsula and occupy the southern portion of a rift valley bounded on the north-west by the Hunua Ranges, to the east by the Coromandel and Kaimai ranges and to the west by a series of undulating hills which separate the plains from the much larger plains of the Waikato River.

The Plains are not presently a single administrative area, though a Hauraki Plains County Council existed from 1920 to 1989 and a statistical Area Unit remains. Broadly, the northern and southern parts of the Hauraki Plains are administered by the Hauraki District and the Matamata-Piako District respectively.

The alluvial plains have been built up by sediment deposited by the Piako and Waihou rivers, which flow north to reach the sea at the Firth of Thames, and earlier by the ancestral Waikato River. The resulting land is flat, peat-heavy, and partly swampy, which has been converted into excellent land for dairy farming.

Economically, the dairy farming is the leading primary industry, supported by other grassland farming. More recently, tourism in the Hauraki Plains region has been growing and the Hauraki Rail Trail, part of the New Zealand Cycle Trail, has been constructed in the Hauraki Plains.

The largest town fully within the Plains is Ngatea, with a smaller settlement of Turua. The larger town of Paeroa is located on the eastern edge of the Hauraki Plains. While there is no defined geographical southern boundary to the Hauraki Plains, this is generally taken as being a line between the towns of Te Aroha and Morrinsville, approximately following State Highway 26.

== Demographics ==
Three statistical areas cover the northern part of Hauraki Plains: Hauraki Plains North, Hauraki Plains East and Hauraki Plains South. They include Turua, Kaihere, Kerepehi, Pipiroa and Waitakaruru, and surround but do not include Ngatea. They cover and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, these statistical areas had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, these three statistical areas had a population of 4,053 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 243 people (6.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 90 people (2.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 1,479 households, comprising 2,067 males and 1,986 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.04 males per female, with 927 people (22.9%) aged under 15 years, 720 (17.8%) aged 15 to 29, 1,848 (45.6%) aged 30 to 64, and 561 (13.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 86.6% European/Pākehā, 20.2% Māori, 2.5% Pacific peoples, 3.4% Asian, and 1.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 10.8, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 59.5% had no religion, 26.6% were Christian, 1.9% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.2% were Hindu, 0.3% were Buddhist and 2.2% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 315 (10.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 807 (25.8%) people had no formal qualifications. 417 people (13.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,638 (52.4%) people were employed full-time, 510 (16.3%) were part-time, and 87 (2.8%) were unemployed.

== History==
=== Formation===
Around 2–3 million years ago, a large block of the crust slumped down 500–2000 metres, forming in due course the Hauraki 2 to 3 half-grabens. The ancestral Waikato River often flowed through the resulting valley into the Hauraki Gulf, most recently through the Hinuera Valley some 20,000 years ago. Over time, the Hauraki Basin slowly filled up with pumice, mud and gravel.

===Wetlands===
After the last shift of the Waikato River back to the west coast, the Waihou and Piako rivers were formed. These two rivers carried silt out into the Firth of Thames or Tikapa.

The plains were full of mangroves, raupō (&quot;Typha orientalis&quot;), harakeke (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) a dense forest of kahikatea. Most of the land was raw peat, varying in depth from a metre to more than twenty metres. It was a morass, the home of wild ducks and eels. Nevertheless, the rich flora and fauna of the plains amply provided the staples of the Māori people who lived in the region. Many areas on the banks of the Waihou River were settled by Hauraki Māori, such as Oruarangi pā and Paterangi pā near Matatoki, and the Te Raupa pā and Waiwhau pā near Paeroa.

The early European colonists were attracted not necessarily by the land, but by the dense forest of kahikatea. The colonists (or Pākehā) were timber millers such as the George and Martha Bagnall family who settled at Turua in 1875. As the kahikatea was felled, farmers followed onto the newly cleared land. But, once a year, the Waihou and Piako Rivers would overflow, making agricultural settlement of the area difficult because of the poor drainage. The people who lived around Hauraki wanted permission from the Government to drain the land, but the Government said it could never be done, as parts of the Hauraki Plains were two metres below sea level. However, in 1908 an act was passed to give the people permission to drain the land. The Government paid the workers to dig the drains, a process that took ten years to complete.

===First land ballots ===
In 1910, the Government decided to open an area of for settlement on the Hauraki Plains. Ballots were held for the blocks, which attracted the interests of future settlers and businessmen in the Thames Valley. Miners in the South Island were keen to settle in the area if sections were drawn up by the Government. The first applications for land blocks were made at the Miner&#x27;s Union Hall in Thames on 18 May 1910. Prices ranged from $10–$15 an acre, depending on how much land was being bought and the location of the block. Some of the most sought-after blocks had up to 99 applicants.

===Drainage systems===
Work started immediately after the passing of the Hauraki Plains Act. Controlling the flooding of the Piako River which overflowed at least once a year was crucial. This was achieved through the construction of stop-banks to prevent floods and tidal overflow.
Farmers were required to dig drains, ranging from one to two metres wide, through their land. These drains connected to the main drains, which brought the water out and into the canals. Floodgates were installed to prevent the ingress of water into the canals, while allowing floodwaters to flow out of the system. As a result of the drainage system, the size of the wetlands declined to less than 25% of their original area.

Once the land was mostly drained, scrub, logs and tree stumps had to be cleared, and the earth levelled, to convert it to pasture. The scrub and waste was burnt off.

==River transport==
River transport was the most effective method to transport goods, people and animals to the Hauraki Plains, as an effective roading system had not yet been established.

===Ship traffic===
Ships of all sizes plied the rivers of the Hauraki Plains, from tiny row boats to huge barques although, most of the boats were steamers and the engines were made at A &amp; G Price in Thames.

As industries progressed (like the mining in Waihi) bigger ships were required to carry the bigger loads. The majority of the boats were steamers, but some were paddle steamers. Larger passenger ships had luxurious lounges for men and women decorated with velvet upholstery and paintings on the walls. There were even brass bands on some boats and room for dancing on the decks. There was also room for horses and general cargo. Some cargo boats and punts were designed with drop sides to assist in loading and unloading on the river banks. This was especially useful when animals were being loaded.

During the mining strike the hotels were closed by the government, but you could still drink on a moving boat. So people would get on the boats and take a trip for the day just to use the bar.

In 1877, massive timber ships called barques travelled up to Bagnalls&#x27; mill in Turua to collect the kahikatea logs and transport them to Auckland and Australia. You can still see the remains of the wharf where the ships berthed. When the Bagnalls first arrived in Turua and wanted to go to church in Thames, they rowed to Kopu then walked the last to Thames.

At Orchard (now called Ngatea), Pipiroa, Kopu and Paeroa there were punts (floating platforms) that carried people, horses and carts across the rivers for a small fee. At Te Aroha, there was a wire rope stretched across the river which originally had a Māori canoe tied to it on which people could pull themselves across and was later replaced by a punt with a crank and for two shillings people could crank themselves across.

===River systems===
Geologists have shown that a very long time ago, the Waikato river came through the Hinurea valley and filled the Hauraki Basin with pumice, mud, drift wood and gravel to a depth of over 1200 ft. You can still see evidence of sea beaches between Shelly Beach and Maukoro.

Before the arrival of the European settlers, the Hauraki Plains was 400 km2 of peat and swamp land which acted as a big ponding area, through which ran two main rivers – the Waihou and Piako.

Māori used the rivers for hundreds of years to get to the rich food resources in the swamp. When the Europeans came they also used the rivers for transport. Because the Hauraki Plains were swamp land and there were no roads the easiest way to transport people, supplies, food and produce was by boat.

Gold brought many ships up the Waihou and Ohinimuri rivers with heavy machinery and miners aboard. There was even a special hard wharf built at Paeroa for fear of a conventional one collapsing while the machines were unloaded.

Bagnells&#x27; mill at Turua was established to mill the tall kahikatea trees growing there. Huge barques (sailing ships) came up the river on flood tides to collect the wood, some of which would be taken to Australia and be made into butter boxes.

After the scrub and kahikatea had been cleared farming was taken up and the farmers needed everything from food to animals and boats and the rivers carried it all in.

In pioneer days the rivers were the lifelines of the Hauraki Plains, but as roads improved and bridges were built the need for river transport diminished. Today it has all died away except the ferry that goes up the Waihou to Paeroa from Auckland, and the metal barge that comes into Kopu to pick up a load.

====Waihou River====
In 1769 Captain James Cook travelled up the Waihou River to look at the &quot;lofty trees which adorn its banks&quot;. He was the first European to travel up the river. The Waihou reminded him of the River Thames in London so he named it the River Thames. Although this name stuck for quite some time, now it is known as the Waihou. His discovery of the kahikatea tree later brought many ships to the area looking for masts and spars.

In the 1900s the Waihou was navigable right up to Matamata, because development had not yet silted up the river. Travelling up stream you would pass Kopu on the left then Turua on the right, Matatoki, Puriri, Hikutaia, Paeroa and Te Aroha on the left and eventually Matamata on the right.

====Piako River====
The Piako River is much smaller than the Waihou, but it was just as important in the development of the Hauraki Plains. Travelling up the Piako you would see Pipiroa, then Ngatea, both on the right, followed by Kerepehi, and the last town accessible by boat was Patetonga.

Supplies were brought up the Piako by a small yacht and later by a launch. The boat was the main outlet to civilisation for the settlers who were mostly male bachelors and it was easier for them to eat stale bread brought up by the boat weekly than to make it themselves. It also brought mail and took cream back to Kopu which took four hours.

The rivers were a major lifeline for the plains in the early days and they are still a part of everyday life, though not nearly as much as they used to be.

==Industries==
===Dairy farming===
Dairy farming is the most important industry on the Hauraki Plains, providing the most income for the region. The sizes of dairy farms range from around 100 cows to over 500. 66% of the total land area of the plains is used in dairy farming. This equates to 779.34 km2 of land.

===Other farming===
Although dairy farming is the main industry it is not the only farming industry. Sheep and dry stock farming are beginning to catch on with farmers. There is still the demand for wool and meat, which the Hauraki Plains region helps to provide. An ostrich farm has been developed near Turua which deals in tourism, meat sales and gifts.

==Education==
There are primary schools in Ngatea, Kaihere, Pipiroa, Waitakaruru and Turua.

Secondary education options include Hauraki Plains College in Ngatea, Paeroa College, and Thames High School.

==Wetlands conservation==
In the 1840s an estimated 1100 km2 of wetland covered the lower Waikato area and Hauraki Plains. Since then 85 to 90% of New Zealand wetlands have been lost. The Department of Conservation (DOC) estimates of wetlands that remain in the Waikato are around 320 km2, approximately 25% of their original area. This figure includes Whangamarino (5,130.35 hectares), and Kopuatai Peat Dome (9,238.44 hectares). Roughly 80% of New Zealand&#x27;s remaining wetlands are in areas across the Waikato region, mostly within the Waikato, Matamata-Piako and Hauraki Districts. Five of New Zealand&#x27;s wetlands are listed on the International Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar sites); there are three of them in the Waikato Region:
*Kopuatai Peat Dome
*Whangamarino Wetland
*Firth of Thames estuary

=== Kopuatai Peat Dome ===

At 9,238.44 hectares, the Kopuatai Peat Dome is New Zealand&#x27;s largest unaltered restiad peat bog, and is also globally unique. The area is protected by the Wetland Management Reserve under the Conservation Act 1987 and is managed by the Department of Conservation.

Fifty four species of birds have been recorded in the Kopuatai Peat Dome. Twenty seven are protected, 17 are unprotected and 10 are game birds. The endangered Australasian bittern (&quot;Botaurus poiciloptilus&quot;) is found in the wetland with other endangered birds such as the banded rail (&quot;Rallus philipensis assimillis&quot;), marsh crake (&quot;Porzana pusilla affinis&quot;) and the North Island fernbird (&quot;Bowdleria punctata vealeae&quot;).

<text>In Canadian football, a single (also called a single point, or rouge) is a one-point score that is awarded for certain plays that involve the ball being kicked into the end zone and not returned from it.

==Rules==
A single is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal meansother than a convert (successful or not) or a successful field goaland the receiving team does not return (or kick) the ball out of its end zone.

A single is indicated by the referee raising his right arm and index finger. After conceding a single, the receiving team is awarded possession of the ball at its 35-yard line (Football Canada rules) or 40-yard line (CFL rules). When a single is scored on a missed field goal attempt, the team scored against has the option of taking possession at the previous line of scrimmage.

Singles are not awarded for situations not involving a kick; thus, interceptions and fumbles recovered by the defence and downed in their own end zone are ruled as a touchback and no points are awarded, as in American football. Under Football Canada rules, if a kickoff goes into the end zone and then out of bounds without touching the ground or a player, this is also a touchback; in the CFL, this scores a single. In each of the above cases, the defending team is awarded possession of the ball at its 25-yard line (CFL rules) or 20-yard line (Football Canada rules).

Until the 1970s, a doink—a field goal kick that hits an upright or the crossbar but does not carom through the goal—was a live ball, and thus a doink that bounced into the end zone and was not returned could score a single. Since the 1970s, Canadian football has followed American rules ruling the ball dead at the moment it hits a post, with no single awarded.

In the official rules, the single point is also called a &quot;&quot;, French for &quot;red&quot;. The origin is unclear.

===Canadian Football League===
The Canadian Football League (CFL) has discussed abolishing the single, but proposals to do so have been rejected. A 2005 proposal to reduce scenarios resulting in a single on missed field goal attempts was also rejected. A less-sweeping proposal would see the single eliminated on punts and field goal attempts that travel through the sidelines of the end zone such a change would eliminate the &quot;consolation&quot; point for a failed coffin corner attempt. Other proposals would have the rouge scored only on kicks scrimmaged from beyond a certain point or are otherwise deemed &#x27;returnable&#x27;, having touched the end zone or a return team player without being advanced back into the field of play.

The lowest scoring game in CFL history, a 1–0 victory by the Montreal Alouettes over the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1966, had no scoring except for a single in the fourth quarter on a missed field goal attempt.

In the CFL and its predecessor leagues, the most rouges ever scored by one kicker in a game is 11, by Ben Simpson of the Hamilton Tigers against the Montreal AAA Winged Wheelers on October 29, 1910. The final score was 14–7 in favour of Hamilton. Hugh Gall holds the Grey Cup record, with eight singles for the Toronto Varsity Blues football team in the inaugural Grey Cup. However, this was before the modern CFL was founded, and so it does not count as a CFL record.

== Other football codes ==

In American football, Canadian football-type singles are not used. Receiving teams are allowed to down the ball in the end zone for a touchback, and kicking the ball out of bounds through the end zone also results in a touchback; in either case, the receiving team receives possession of the ball at either its own 20- or 25-yard line, depending on the specific level of play. It is possible to score a single point in American football on a conversion safety, a rule that also applies in Canadian football.

Some indoor American football leagues have used the single, namely the National Indoor Football League, the American Indoor Football Association and the Professional Indoor Football League, all now defunct. It was adopted by the Arena Football League for the league&#x27;s 2024 revival. The single is possible only on kickoffs, applying if the receiving team fails to advance the ball out of its own end zone after having received the kick. The NIFL and AIFA also allowed a single to be scored by kicking a kickoff through the uprights (as in a field goal); this type of single was nicknamed (and was later codified in the AIFA rules as) an &quot;uno&quot;, from the Spanish word for the number one. (In the Indoor Football League, the National Arena League, and the 2024 iteration of the Arena Football League, this type of kick is worth two points, and is called a &quot;deuce&quot;; the 2024 AFL also recognized the traditional single, awarding one point for a kick that reaches the returning team&#x27;s end zone but the returning team fails to advance it out thereof. Arena Football One recognizes the deuce but not the single.)

The concept of the rouge dates back to several public school sports played in England from the early 19th century. In Rossall hockey played at Rossall School and the Eton field game, both of which are still played, a rouge can be scored after the ball has gone into the local equivalent of the &#x27;end zone&#x27; after striking another player. The Sheffield Rules, a 19th-century code of football, also used the rouge as a secondary scoring method, as did the first rules formulated by the Football Association in 1863. The behind used in Australian rules football is similar in concept to the Canadian single (worth one point whereas goals are worth six), as is the point in Gaelic football, hurling, and camogie (where a ball into the net scores three points, while a ball passing over the crossbar scores one).

<text>National Galleries Scotland: Modern (the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art) is part of National Galleries Scotland, which is based in Edinburgh, Scotland. The Modern houses the collection of modern and contemporary art dating from about 1900 to the present in two buildings, Modern One and Modern Two, that face each other on Belford Road to the west of the city centre.

The Modern has a collection of more than 6000 paintings, sculptures, installations, video work, prints and drawings and also stages major exhibitions.

==History==
The first Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art (SNGMA) opened in August 1960 in Inverleith House, a Georgian building set in the middle of Edinburgh&#x27;s Royal Botanic Garden. 

In 1984 the SNGMA moved to the former premises of the John Watson&#x27;s Institution on Belford Road in the west of the city, a large neo-classical building which was originally designed by William Burn in 1825 as a refuge for fatherless children. 

Inverleith House became a contemporary art gallery, curated by the Royal Botanic Garden, also featuring exhibitions of works and specimens from its historic collections.

In 1999, the SNGMA&#x27;s collection had outgrown the Watson&#x27;s premises, and it expanded into the Dean Orphan Hospital, a neoclassical orphanage situated on the other side of Belford Road which had been erected by Thomas Hamilton in 1833. The Dean Gallery was converted to a gallery by Terry Farrell and Partners.

In 2012, National Galleries of Scotland underwent a rebranding exercise, and the two Belford Road galleries were renamed &quot;Modern One&quot; and &quot;Modern Two&quot;. 

A further rebranding was undertaken in 2023, when the organisation&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;National Galleries Scotland&quot;. The names of the individual gallery buildings were also renamed, and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art is now billed as &quot;National Galleries Scotland: Modern&quot;.

==Collections==
===Modern One===
Modern One, the former Watson&#x27;s Institution building, presents works from the collection as well as a programme of changing exhibitions. The early part of the collection features European art from the beginning of the twentieth century, including work by André Derain and Pierre Bonnard, cubist paintings and holdings of expressionist and modern British art. Special highlights include paintings by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso and the Scottish Colourists Samuel John Peploe, John Duncan Fergusson, Francis Cadell and Leslie Hunter.

The Modern has a renowned collection of international post-war work and an outstanding collection of modern Scottish art. The post-war collection features art by Francis Bacon, David Hockney, Andy Warhol, Joan Eardley and Alan Davie, with more recent works by artists including Douglas Gordon, Antony Gormley, Robert Priseman and Tracey Emin. The collection also includes ARTIST ROOMS, a collection of modern and contemporary art acquired for the nation by National Galleries Scotland and Tate with support from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Art Fund and the Scottish and British Governments. The growing collection includes works by major international artists including Andy Warhol, Louise Bourgeois, Robert Mapplethorpe and Damien Hirst. The collection includes the larger of Roy Lichtenstein&#x27;s &quot;In the Car&quot; pieces.

The displays change on a regular basis.

===Modern Two===


Modern Two (formerly the Dean Gallery) is home to a changing programme of world-class exhibitions and displays drawn from the permanent collection. On permanent display is a recreation of the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi&#x27;s studio, as well as his 7.3 metre-tall sculpture, &quot;Vulcan&quot;, that dominates the café. Modern Two is also home to the gallery&#x27;s world-famous collection of Surrealism, including works by Salvador Dalí, René Magritte and Alberto Giacometti. The building houses a library, archive and special books collection. The library&#x27;s great strengths are Dada and Surrealism, early twentieth century artists and contemporary Scottish art. The archive contains over 120 holdings relating to twentieth and twenty-first century artists, collectors and art organisations, including the gallery&#x27;s own papers. The archive holds one of the world&#x27;s best collections of Dada and Surrealist material, largely made up by the collections of Roland Penrose and Gabrielle Keiller. The special books collection contains over 2,500 artist books and limited edition livres d’artiste, again with a main focus on Dada and Surrealism, but also books by other major artists from the twentieth century including Oskar Kokoschka&#x27;s &quot;Die Träumenden Knaben&quot; (1917) and Henri Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Jazz&quot; (1947). This material is available to the public in the reading room, open to the public by appointment. There are regular changing displays in the Gabrielle Keiller library to showcase items from these collections.

===Outdoor sculpture===
Modern One and Two are set in extensive parkland, where visitors can discover sculpture by such artists as Ian Hamilton Finlay, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, George Rickey, Rachel Whiteread, Richard Long and Nathan Coley. The lawn to the front of Modern One was re-landscaped in 2002 to a design by Charles Jencks. This dramatic work, or &quot;Landform&quot;, comprises a stepped, serpentine mound reflected in three crescent-shaped pools of water. The façade of Modern One is home to Martin Creed&#x27;s &quot;Work No. 975, EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT&quot;. Modern One backs on to the Water of Leith river and walkway, which can be accessed by a long flight of steep steps behind the Gallery.

==Governance==
The Modern&#x27;s director is Simon Groom, who was appointed in 2007.

<text>Whanganui Island is the largest of a small group of islands at the entrance to Coromandel harbour in the Hauraki Gulf, off the coast of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

The island, which is privately owned, is
 in area. Much of it is farmed, but there are some forested areas.

==Early history==

The ancient &quot;pā&quot; of Horokino (Herekino) situated at Arapaoa Bay (Homestead Bay) was captured by the Tainui from the original inhabitants, the Ngāti Huarere, and was one of several dotted around the perimeter of the Coromandel Harbour, then known as the Waiau. 

==Modern history==

The geographic naming by both Māori and Pākehā has been subject to many changes over the history of the island and this makes the study of its history confusing.

The historian A. V. Piesse made a study of the names and seems to have arrived at a suitable summary. &quot;The island is separated from the mainland by a narrow passage known as Whenuakura.The ancient name for the Island was Poroporo (according to Church Missionary Society catechist James Preece), later referred to by early settlers as Arapaoa, and then finally Whanganui Island (although originally as Wanganui Island).
Also the Southernmost Point of the Island, now called Tawhiti Point was originally named Poroporo. Tawhiti Point was the name first used for the Northern end of Tawhiti (Woolshed) Bay, which is now called Rodney Point. The island was variously also named Beesons Island, Parker Island and Waiou.

American William Webster established a shipbuilding and trading enterprise on the island in 1836. He owned the island until the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, when he lost legal title to the island as all titles passed to the British crown.

During the period of William Webster John Logan Campbell spent a period of time on Whanganui Island. There is a certain amount of confusion about where he stayed. Some say he lived at Timber (Woolshed) Bay and some say he stayed at the home at Arapaoa Bay. There was a good deal of shipbuilding activity in Timber (Woolshed) Bay and this was of primary interest to Campbell so it was possible that he stayed there. However Piesse for one includes a sketch of Campbell&#x27;s &quot;base&quot; in his book and Campbell writes about his &quot;Stay at Herekino&quot; in his book &quot;Poenamo&quot;

==Town of Coromandel==
Whanganui Island was the original site for the new Town of Coromandel. Plans were drawn up and sold in New Zealand and Britain. 
 and sections were sold. The issue to the new owners was that the plan implied flattish land but the land was far from flat. There was also no suitable permanent source of fresh water. .The new owners abandoned their land and eventually the Crown bought all but two of the sections and helped the Settlers establish themselves in the mainland settlement of Kapanga (the new Coromandel Town )

Woolshed Bay on the protected southern shore is a popular overnight mooring spot for cruising from Auckland.

<doc id="1177712" wikidata="Q7987247" url="?curid=1177712" title="Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets">
<text>Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets (WESM) is a magnet high school in the Los Angeles Unified School District, West Region.

It is located in Westchester (Los Angeles), a neighborhood adjacent to Los Angeles International Airport and bordered by Playa Vista to the north, Inglewood to the east, El Segundo to the south, and Playa del Rey to the west. Until the 201011 school year, the school was a comprehensive high school known as Westchester High School.

==History==
Westchester High School opened to 500 students in September 1948 at what is now Orville Wright Middle School. During the 2010–2011 school year, Westchester High School became Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets (WESM). There are three programs:
On June 1, 2011, at least 400 students walked out to protest the school&#x27;s displacement of 25 teachers in addition to 10 RIF&#x27;d teachers.

In 2011, rapper Tyler, The Creator was arrested in front of the school for promoting his album &quot;Goblin&quot;.

==About the school==

The Westchester Enriched Sciences Magnets (WESM) are a trio of science-themed magnet schools, which provide individualized learning opportunities within their small, thematically-aligned programs. Together, the Westchester Magnets form one campus, providing a wide array of athletic and extra-curricular opportunities.

The Westchester Magnets embrace project-based learning. Students synthesize content from all of their classes to create projects and conduct experiments with real-world applications. They engage in hands-on learning as they experience instruction aligned to the themes of the three magnets: Aerospace &amp; Aviation, Environmental &amp; Natural Science, and Health &amp; Sports Medicine.

WESM is able to offer these innovative programs through partnerships with local organizations and businesses like Loyola Marymount University, Boeing, Chevron, and the Team Heal Foundation. Because of the contributions of these partners, WESM offers opportunities for internships, field trips, guest lectures, and demonstrations by scientists and other professionals.

The school expects every student to be involved in at least one extra-curricular activity. Students participate in countless organizations, including clubs, student government, band, drama, cheerleading, drill team, and athletics.

==Curriculum==

In the WESM Aviation &amp; Aerospace Magnet, students have the opportunity to participate in flight simulation. They also take a shop class where they learn applied physics by working on the engine of a real Cessna airplane, which is located on campus. In the WESM Environmental &amp; Natural Science Magnet, students monitor renewable electricity generated by an on-campus photovoltaic facility. They also take courses focused on urban ecology and green construction. In the WESM Health &amp; Sports Medicine Magnet, students take Athletic Training classes using a state-of-the-art athletic training room. They also study nutrition in a Culinary Arts kitchen.

==Academic performance==
In recent years, Westchester has shown a consistent trend of dramatically increased academic performance. Over each of the past 5 years, the school has posted significant gains in API (Academic Performance Index), going from a score of 589 in 2007 to a current API of 663.

==Athletics==
The Westchester Comets have an extensive history of athletic prowess. The school&#x27;s most prominent program, its boys&#x27; basketball team, has won 12 Los Angeles City titles and six Division I California State Championships under its head coach, Ed Azzam. One of its players, Amir Johnson, was drafted directly out of high school there, and was originally considered to be the last high school student to be drafted in the NBA draft until 2015 and 2016 with Satnam Singh Bhamara and Thon Maker, respectively.

The Comets&#x27; home football stadium is named in memory of Hank Gathers, who played basketball at Loyola Marymount.

==Student body==
A majority of the students are African-American, although the school draws students of all ethnic backgrounds from across the Los Angeles area.

Orville Wright Middle School is WESM&#x27;s primary feeder, although WESM also draws many students from Marina del Rey Middle School, Palms Gifted Magnet, Mark Twain Middle School, and Audubon&#x27;s Gifted Magnet, along with various charter and private middle schools.

Sharla Berry, a guest columnist for &quot;YES!&quot; Magazine who attended Westchester from fall 2002 to summer 2006, stated that the school&#x27;s different ethnic groups interacted with each other frequently.

==Demographics==

Since its reconfiguration in 2010, Westchester&#x27;s enrollment has begun to gradually increase. However, this is a reversal of prior enrollment trends. Beginning in the 2004–05 school year, Westchester experienced a dramatic decline in enrollment, reaching a low point in 2010, with a total enrollment of approximately 1300 students.

During the 2004–2005 school year, Westchester had 2726 students.
* 56% were African-American
* 35% were Hispanic
* 6% were White American
* 2% were Asian
* &lt;0% were Filipino
* &lt;0% were Pacific Islanders
* &lt;0% were Indigenous peoples of the Americas
For the 2005-2006 school year, LAUSD opened new schools to relieve overcrowding in the district. LAUSD opened two high schools, Southeast High School in South Gate, California and the Santee Education Complex in Los Angeles. As a result, Westchester&#x27;s student population dropped to about 1,938 – close to the level of previous years. This was a welcome change for many parents who complained of the overcrowding and disruption caused by busing more students from central Los Angeles to the Westside school.

During the 2005–2006 school year, Westchester had 1938 students.
* 68% were African-American
* 25% were Hispanic
* 4% were White American
* 2% were Asian
* &lt;1% were Filipino
* &lt;1% were Pacific Islanders
* &lt;1% were Native American

The Westchester campus also houses an Aerospace Magnet School that enrolled an additional 362 students in the 2005-2006 school year.

For 2005–2006, Westchester Aerospace Magnet had 361 students.
* 55% were African-American
* 32% were Hispanic
* 9% were White American
* 2% were Asian
* &lt;1% were Filipino
* &lt;1% were Pacific Islanders
* &lt;1% were Native American

Four additional high schools, Arleta, East Valley, Panorama, and Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, opened in fall 2006, again decreasing the number of transfer students in many schools.

<text>Kent County Cricket Club is one of the eighteen first-class county clubs within the domestic cricket structure of England and Wales. It represents the historic county of Kent. A club representing the county was first founded in 1842 but Kent teams have played top-class cricket since the early 18th century, and the club has always held first-class status. The current Kent County Cricket Club was formed on 6 December 1870 following the merger of two representative teams. Kent have competed in the County Championship since the official start of the competition in 1890 and have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England. The club&#x27;s limited overs team is called the Kent Spitfires after the Supermarine Spitfire.

The county has won the County Championship seven times, including one shared victory. Four wins came in the period between 1906 and 1913 with the other three coming during the 1970s when Kent also dominated one-day cricket cup competitions. A total of 13 one-day cricket cup victories include eight between 1967 and 1978, with the last trophy won by the club coming in the 2022 Royal London One-Day Cup.

The club plays most of its home matches at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, which hosts Canterbury Cricket Week, the oldest cricket festival in England. It also plays some home matches at the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham and the Nevill Ground, Royal Tunbridge Wells which hosts Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week.

Kent also field a women&#x27;s team. Kent Women won the Women&#x27;s County Championship a record eight times, most recently in 2019, and the Women&#x27;s T20 title three times, most recently in 2016. It has traditionally played matches at the Polo Farm in Canterbury, but since 2016 has moved to be based mainly at Beckenham.

==History==
Cricket is generally believed to have originated out of children&#x27;s bat-and-ball games in the areas of the Weald and North and South Downs of Kent and Sussex, and these counties and Surrey were the first centres of the game. There are records of the sport being played in Kent during the 17th century, although a match in 1705, probably at Town Malling, is the first that is definitely recorded as taking place within the county.

===Early county teams to 1842===
The first inter-county match took place between a Kent side and one from Surrey on Dartford Brent in 1709, although three matches between Kent and Sussex in 1728 are more likely to have been the first properly representative county matches. Teams under the patronage of landowners such as Edwin Stead of Dartford and Lord John Sackville, who established the Sevenoaks Vine ground on his Knole Park estate, increasingly became more representative of Kent as a county, and in 1744 a Kent team organised by Sackville played England at the Artillery Ground, a match which was commemorated in a poem by James Love. Under the patronage of Sackville&#x27;s son, John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, and Sir Horatio Mann, Kent continued to field strong teams throughout the last quarter of the 18th century, and were, along with Surrey, the main challengers to the Hampshire teams organised primarily by the Hambledon Club.

The first inter-county match now considered to have first-class status was played between Kent and Surrey in 1773, and in 1787 a failed attempt to form a Kent County Club, with Dorset and Mann involved, was made at Coxheath. Inter-county matches declined towards the end of the 18th century, possibly as a result of a lack of investment during the Napoleonic Wars, although Kent teams continued to play matches. The resumption of matches between county sides in 1825, when Kent met Sussex at Brighton&#x27;s Royal New Ground, saw matches organised by clubs in different parts of the county.

A second attempt to form a County Club was made during the 1830s at Town Malling, backed by lawyers Thomas Selby and Silas Norton, alongside George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris. Selby and Norton recruited Fuller Pilch from Norfolk, considered the best batsman in England, to play at Town Malling and maintain the cricket ground. Pilch played in Kent teams alongside players such as Alfred Mynn, Nicholas Felix, Ned Wenman and William Hillyer which dominated English cricket, winning 98 matches during the period, and the team is considered to have been the leading county side for six seasons out of the seven between 1837 and 1843. The expense of running county games meant that Town Malling proved too small to support a county club, and the club was wound up in 1841, Pilch moving to the Beverley club at Canterbury.

===The first county clubs: 1842–1870===

The Beverley Cricket Club was formed in 1835 at the Canterbury estate of brothers John and William de Chair Baker, initially playing in the St Stephen&#x27;s district of the city before moving to the Beverley Ground in 1839. After the failure of the Town Malling club, the Bakers stepped in to organise Kent teams, with Pilch managing the ground. The Beverley club became the Kent Cricket Club on 6 August 1842, when it reconstituted itself during its annual cricket festival. The club was the first formal incarnation of Kent County Cricket Club, and the 1842 cricket festival is considered the first Canterbury Cricket Week.

The new Kent club played its initial first-class match against an England side at White Hart Field in Bromley on 25–27 August 1842, and initially the success of the club continued, with Kent considered the leading county side in 1843, 1847 and 1849. The club moved to the St Lawrence Ground on the eastern side of Canterbury in 1847, with Pilch once again moving to manage the ground. This was later established as the county&#x27;s formal headquarters, although Kent continued to play matches on a variety of grounds around the county until well into the 20th century, rarely using the St Lawrence Ground for more than two or three matches a year.

As the team built around Pilch retired from cricket, the fortunes of the club declined, the county sometimes forced to field teams of up to 16 or to combine with other clubs in order to compete. Financial difficulties followed and on 1 March 1859 a second county club was formed at Maidstone to support the Canterbury-based club. The two clubs, the Canterbury club known as East Kent, the Maidstone club as West Kent, co-operated to an extent, although the relationship was later described as &quot;anything but satisfactory&quot;. The standard of cricket played by the county side, generally organised by the West Kent club, remained poor and the county found it difficult to attract either the best amateur players or professionals to play, many amateurs only willing to appear during Canterbury Week. An 1870 meeting chaired by the 3rd Lord Harris at the Bull Inn at Rochester saw the two clubs merge to form the present day Kent County Cricket Club.

===A single county club: 1870–1914===

Initially the amalgamation of the clubs failed to improve performances on the pitch. The best amateurs still rarely appeared and Kent lacked a core of talented professionals to provide the team with a solid foundation. The 4th Lord Harris was elected to the General Committee in 1870 and became captain and secretary in 1875. He set about reforming the club with an &quot;energetic administration&quot;, although performances improved only slowly at first and when the County Championship was formerly established in 1890 Kent were initially able to finish only in mid table.

The establishment of the Tonbridge Nursery in 1897 as a player development centre for young professionals was one of the key developments that lay the foundations for the successes of the pre-war period. The Nursery, which was run by Captain William McCanlis and set up and overseen by Tom Pawley who became the club&#x27;s general manager in 1898, identified and provided organised coaching and match practise for young professionals for the first time. Players flourished and became the basis of the Kent team, gradually taking the place of the amateurs who had dominated the Kent teams of the 1870s and 80s. By 1906 around 60% of all appearances were by professionals, with bowlers such as Colin Blythe and Arthur Fielder forming the core of the Kent attack. Professional batsmen such as Punter Humphreys and James Seymour and all-rounders such as Frank Woolley became an increasing part of Kent&#x27;s success, coming together with a group of &quot;gifted&quot; amateurs to produce strong batting lineups.

This Kent side was the first since the 1840s to enjoy a period of real success, winning the County Championship four times in the years between 1906 and 1914. The first title, in 1906, came under the captaincy of Cloudesley Marsham and was won on the last day of the season. Sides captained by Ted Dillon won three further Championships in 1909, 1910 and 1913 and the Kent XI was strong throughout the pre-war period. Blythe was the team&#x27;s leading bowler throughout the period, taking over 100 wickets each season between 1902 and 1914, including 17 in one day against Northants in 1907.

===Consistency but no Championships: 1919–1939===
Blythe died at Paschendaele in 1917, although it is unlikely he would have played county cricket once the war was over. The Kent side, once the makeshift 1919 season had been played, continued to be consistently strong throughout the inter-war period, finishing in the top five of the County Championship table in all but one season between 1919 and 1934. Players such as Woolley, Wally Hardinge and Les Ames all played at the peak of their careers, whilst Blythe&#x27;s bowling was replaced by Tich Freeman&#x27;s. Freeman took 102 wickets for Kent in 1920 and then took at least 100 each season until 1936, taking 262 in 1933. He leads all Kent bowlers in wickets taken.

Kent scored 803 for 4 declared against Essex at Brentwood in 1934, with Bill Ashdown scoring 332, Ames 202 not out and Woolley 172. The total took just seven hours, with 623 runs scored on the first day alone and remains, as of 2022, Kent&#x27;s highest score in first-class cricket, Ashdown&#x27;s 332 runs remaining the highest individual score made for Kent. Arthur Fagg scored a unique two double centuries in the same match for Kent against Essex at Colchester in 1938, while Woolley scored over 1,000 runs for Kent in each season between 1920 and his retirement in 1938. In 1928 he made 2,894 runs for the county at a batting average of 59.06. He retired in 1938 after making 764 appearances for the county side, with 47,868 runs, 122 centuries and 773 catches for Kent―all county records.

===Post-war rebuilding and the Second Golden Age: 1946–1978===
Gerry Chalk had captained the side in 1939 when they had, once again, finished in the top five of the Championship, but he was killed during World War II and the post-war period saw Kent struggle to compete consistently. After two promising seasons under Bryan Valentine in 1946 and 1947, the county only finished in the top nine teams twice between 1948 and 1963.

The rebuilding of the side continued under David Clark&#x27;s captaincy―Clark would later become chairman of the club. Colin Cowdrey, the first man to play 100 Test matches, made his Kent debut in 1950 and was appointed captain in 1957, following Doug Wright who was the first professional to captain the side. Wright took over 2,000 wickets with his brisk leg breaks and googlies between 1932 and 1957 and became the only player to take seven hat-tricks – six of them taken for Kent.

An improvement in performances began in the mid-1960s under the captaincy of Cowdrey and the management of former wicket-keeper Les Ames. A seventh-placed finish in 1964 was followed by fifth-place in 1965 and fourth-place in 1966 before the county finished as runners-up in 1967, winning the Gillette Cup in the same season. Another second-place finish in 1968 followed before the county won their first Championship since 1913 in 1970. Ten trophies were won during the 1970s, including a second Championship title 1978 and a shared title in 1977. The Sunday League was won in 1972, 1973 and 1976, the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 1973, 1976 and 1978 and the Gillette Cup again in 1974 – six of the trophies between 1972 and 1976 under the captaincy of Mike Denness who had succeeded Cowdrey in 1972.

===Recent history===
After no trophies during the 1980s, Kent won the 1995 Axa Equity &amp; Law League and the 2001 Norwich Union League. In August 2007, the side won the Twenty20 Cup for the first time, defeating Sussex in the semi-finals, with captain Rob Key scoring 68 not out. In the final they defeated Gloucestershire in a see-saw game where in the final over, chasing 148, they required 13 runs, winning with three balls to spare. Matthew Walker top scored for Kent in the final with 45 runs while Darren Stevens scored 30 not out from 21 balls, including hitting the winning runs. Earlier in the final, Ryan McLaren took a hat-trick.

In 2008, the county were relegated from to the Second Division of the County Championship for the first time. They won the Division in the 2009 season, but were relegated again at the end of the 2010 season and played in the division until 2018, with a best finish of second in 2016, failing to be promoted only due to a restructuring of the divisional system.

In November 2016, Kent accepted an invitation from the West Indies Cricket Board to compete in the 2016–17 Regional Super50 domestic List A tournament in January and February 2017. This was the first time that any English county side had competed in an overseas domestic competition. The invitation was partly due to the influence of former West Indian captain Jimmy Adams who had, until September 2016, been Kent&#x27;s Head Coach and was followed by an invitation to take part in the competition again in 2018.

Kent were promoted to Division 1 at the end of the 2018 season, having finished second in Division 2 and retained their place in the top division in 2019. In 2021 the team won their first trophy for 14 years, beating Somerset in the T20 Blast final. The following season they were victorious in the domestic List A competition, beating Lancashire to win the 2022 One-Day Cup.

==Grounds==
Kent&#x27;s main ground is the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. This ground has been used by the club since 1847 and Kent have played over 500 first-class matches at the ground. It is famous for having a tree, the St Lawrence Lime, on the playing field. The original tree, around which the ground was built, was broken in two by high winds in January 2005 and replaced by a smaller replacement lime tree later in the same year. The ground hosts the annual Canterbury Cricket Week, the oldest cricket festival in the world. This dates from 1842 and has been held at the ground since the club moved there.

Kent played their first official match at White Hart Field in Bromley in August 1842 and since then have used 29 different grounds within the historic county. One outground remains in regular use, the redeveloped County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. The Nevill Ground in Royal Tunbridge Wells was last used by the club in 2019 and hosted Tunbridge Wells Cricket Week which saw over 200 Kent home matches played on it. Former venues include Mote Park in Maidstone, which was used until 2005 and has been the venue for over 200 Kent first-class matches, as well as grounds in Gravesend, Tonbridge, Dover and Folkestone, all of which have had more than 100 home matches played on them.

The county&#x27;s main offices are based at the St Lawrence Ground. Indoor cricket schools are in place at both this ground and at Beckenham which acts as a centre of excellence for player development in the west of the county.

==Players==
Kent&#x27;s most notable former players include Colin Cowdrey, the first man to play 100 Test matches, Frank Woolley, Derek Underwood and wicket-keepers Les Ames and Alan Knott. All five men played Test cricket for England, making at least 40 Test match appearances. They are the only players to have stands named after them at the St Lawrence Ground, Kent&#x27;s home ground in Canterbury. A total of 30 Kent players have been named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year, most recently Zak Crawley and Darren Stevens in 2021 and Tammy Beaumont in 2019.

Other particularly notable former players include spin bowlers Colin Blythe and Tich Freeman. Blythe was a major force in the four County Championship wins in the years leading up to World War I and took 100 wickets in every season from 1902 to 1914. He played 17 Tests for England but was killed in action during World War I. A memorial at the St Lawrence Ground is dedicated to him. Freeman played during the period after World War I and took over 150 wickets in a season for Kent 14 times. He is the only bowler to take more than 300 wickets in an English season, a feat he achieved in 1928, and the only man to have taken all ten wickets in an innings three times. Fast bowler Graham Dilley represented England in 41 Test matches in the 1980s, whilst all-rounder Mark Ealham played in 64 one-day internationals in the 1990s and early 2000s.

Other than Ames and Knott, Kent has produced a number of other top class wicket-keepers. Fred Huish, who never played for England, is considered as the &quot;first of a line of exceptional Kent wicket-keepers&quot; which have included Godfrey Evans, who played 91 Tests for England, Geraint Jones, with 34 Test and 49 ODI appearances, as well as Edward Tylecote, George Wood and Hopper Levett all of whom were capped by the country. Paul Downton started his career at Kent as part of this line of players and the teams&#x27; current player, Sam Billings, has made Test and one-day appearances for England as a wicket-keeper.

Overseas players who have made a significant contribution to Kent cricket include West Indians John Shepherd, Eldine Baptiste, Bernard Julien and Carl Hooper and Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal all of whom played multiple seasons for the county. South Africans Martin van Jaarsveld, Justin Kemp and Andrew Hall have done the same, as has Australian Andrew Symonds. Other great world cricketers to have played for the county for single seasons include Sri Lankans Aravinda de Silva and Muttiah Muralitharan, India&#x27;s Rahul Dravid and Australia&#x27;s former Test captain Steve Waugh.

===Kent cricket legends&#x27; walkway===
As part of the redevelopment of Kent&#x27;s home ground, the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, the county planned to develop a &quot;legends&#x27; walkway&quot; at the entrance to the ground. A public vote was held to select 12 former players of the club to honour in the walkway. The 12 players were named in June 2011. They included Alfred Mynn, who played for the county in the 19th century, Les Ames, Colin Blythe, Tich Freeman and Frank Woolley from the first half of the 20th century, Godfrey Evans and Doug Wright from the 1930s–50s era, and Colin Cowdrey, Alan Knott, Brian Luckhurst, John Shepherd and Derek Underwood from the teams of the 1960s and 70s. The first bricks were produced for the walkway in April 2012 although they were removed during development of the ground in 2017–18 and moved adjacent to the Nackington Road entrance.

===Captains===

Daniel Bell-Drummond is the current club captain. He was appointed in October 2023, replacing Sam Billings who resigned following the end of the 2023 season.

In total 34 men have been appointed as club captain, beginning with Lord Harris in 1875. Colin Cowdrey captained the side for the longest span in the County Championship era, serving between 1957 and 1971. Ted Dillon led the county to the County Championship title three times, the only man to captain Kent to more than one championship title. Mike Denness&#x27; side of the early 1970s won six one-day titles in his five years as captain.

===Current squad===
Of the players in the current squad Sam Billings, Joe Denly, Zak Crawley, and Matt Parkinson have appeared in Test matches and limited overs cricket for the England cricket team. Fred Klaassen has played One Day International and Twenty20 International cricket for the Netherlands and Grant Stewart T20 Internationals for Italy.

Matt Walker is the most recent head coach of the side, having been appointed in January 2017 following former coach Jimmy Adams&#x27; decision to return to the Caribbean. Walker played for Kent for 16 seasons and was previously batting coach at Essex. The team was promoted to Division One of the County Championship in his first season as head coach, and won the 2021 Vitality Blast and 2022 One-Day Cup under his leadership. He resigned as coach as of the end of the 2024 season. The team&#x27;s bowling coach until September 2023 was Simon Cook, another past player who was appointed as the club&#x27;s Directors of Cricket, replacing Paul Downton. He was replaced by Robbie Joseph, a former fast bowler who took 230 wickets for the county and had previously worked as the bowling coach at Gloucestershire. At the same time, Toby Radford was appointed as the club&#x27;s batting coach, replacing Alex Gidman who had left after a single season, moving to become an assistant coach with the England women&#x27;s cricket team.

The Head of Talent Pathway in charge of the development of young cricketers at the club is former Second XI coach and player Min Patel. Patel works alongside Mark Dekker who had previously coached Kent Women. Former player Mark Ealham is a part-time coach with the club, also spending time coaching at The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury.

==Records==
Frank Woolley, who played for Kent between 1906 and 1938, holds the record for the most appearances, most career runs and most runs in a season for the county. He is the only man to score more than 100 centuries for Kent with 122 and is the county&#x27;s fifth leading wicket taker. Bill Ashdown holds the record for the highest score for the county with 332 runs against Essex in 1934. He is one of only three men to have scored a triple-century for Kent, with two to his name, the others being Sean Dickson, who scored 318 against Northants in 2017, and Daniel Bell-Drummond who scored 300 not out against the same side in 2023.

Tich Freeman is the county&#x27;s leading wicket taker with 3,340 wickets. Freeman took more than 150 wickets for the county 14 times and holds the record for the most wickets in a season. Fellow spin bowler Colin Blythe has the best bowling figures in Kent&#x27;s history taking 10/30 against Northamptonshire in 1907, with 17/48 in the match. Freeman took ten wickets in a match 128 times with Blythe achieving the same feat 64 times.

Along with Woolley and Freeman, Wally Hardinge, James Seymour and Derek Underwood are the only men with more than 500 first-class appearances for Kent.

==Kent Women==

The Kent Women cricket team plays in the London Championship and Women&#x27;s Twenty20 Cup. The first recorded match by a Kent Women&#x27;s team was in May 1935, with the team first appearing in the Women&#x27;s Area Championship in 1980.

The side features a number of international players and is captained by England international Tammy Beaumont. They won the County Championship a record eight times during its existence, including the final tournament in 2019, and have won the Women&#x27;s Twenty20 Cup three times, most recently in 2016. The team play the majority of their home matches at the County Cricket Ground, Beckenham. The Women&#x27;s team is sponsored by Canterbury Christ Church University.

==Gentlemen of Kent==

The Gentlemen of Kent side, generally made up of amateur &quot;gentlemen&quot; cricketers from the county, played 48 first-class matches between 1830 and 1880. These matches were played almost exclusively against MCC and Gentlemen of England sides and an annual first-class fixture took place during the Canterbury Cricket Week between 1842 and 1866. The Gentlemen would also regularly play a one-day match against I Zingari, an amateur wandering side, during the Week and other matches were played on occasion, including against the touring Australian aboriginal side in 1868.

Sides named the Gentlemen of Kent had played cricket matches during the 18th century. The earliest known featuring a side using the name was a 1734 match against a Gentlemen of Sussex side at Sevenoaks Vine. The side was closely associated with the county side and had strong links to other amateur sides, including I Zingari and Band of Brothers, both of which would host tents during Canterbury Week, as well as to Old Stagers, an amateur drama group which performed during Canterbury Week.

==Kent Cricket Academy==

Kent established an academy in 2003 with the aim of developing future first-class cricketers. The academy is based at the St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury and makes use of the Ames-Levett Sports Centre at the ground. It has produced over 25 first-term players for the county, including former club captain Sam Northeast and senior England internationals Tammy Beaumont, Sam Billings, Zak Crawley, Joe Denly, Natasha Farrant, Lydia Greenway and Jo Watts. The leading academy scholar is awarded the John Aitken Gray trophy each year. Past winners have included county First XI players Daniel Bell-Drummond, Alex Blake and Ollie Robinson.

The academy was established by former wicket-keeper Simon Willis. Paul Farbrace and Philip Relf held lead coaching roles within the scheme until Willis was appointed as high performance director in 2011, serving in the role until May 2016 when he was appointed the high performance manager of Sri Lanka Cricket. Former Kent and England spin bowler Min Patel took over the running of the academy on an interim basis following Willis&#x27; departure before becoming Second XI coach in January 2017, with former Shropshire wicket-keeper Jason Weaver taking over the role as high performance director, the two jobs replacing Willis&#x27; former role. When Weaver left the club in 2019, Patel took over the role, becoming the club&#x27;s Head of Talent Pathway and working alongside former women&#x27;s coach Mark Dekker.

==Honours==
Kent have won the County Championship seven times, including one shared title. Four of their wins came in the years before World War I between 1906 and 1913, Ted Dillon captaining the side to three of their titles. The county had to wait until the 1970s to win their other Championship titles, winning outright in 1970 and 1978 and sharing the title with Middlesex in 1977. Kent have finished as runner-up in the Championship on 12 occasions, most recently in 2004. The County Championship Second Division title was won by the county in 2009.

The county First XI has also won a number of limited overs competition trophies. Eight trophies were won between 1967 and 1978, six times by teams led by Mike Denness. Three more trophies have followed in 1995, 2001 and 2007 and, most recently, the team won the 2021 T20 Blast. Kent finished runners-up in the 2008 T20 competition, the 2008 Friends Provident Trophy and the 2018 Royal London One-Day Cup.

The Second XI Championship title has been won nine times by the county, including one shared win in 1987. As of 2019 this represents a record number of victories in the competition. Four of the victories have occurred in the 21st century, with the most recent in 2012. The Second XI Trophy one-day competition was won in 2002 and 2019 and the county won the Minor Counties Championship twice in the 1950s when first-class Second XI&#x27;s entered the competition.

Kent&#x27;s women have won the Women&#x27;s County Championship a record eight times, most recently in 2019, and have been runners-up five times since the competition was established in 1997. The women&#x27;s side has also won the Twenty20 Championship three times, in 2011, 2013 and 2016.

<text>The 1962 United States Senate elections was an election for the United States Senate. Held on November 6, the 34 seats of Class 3 were contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. They occurred in the middle of President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s term. His Democratic Party made a net gain of four seats from the Republicans, increasing their control of the Senate to 68–32. However, this was reduced to 67–33 between the election and the next Congress, as on November 18, 1962, Democrat Dennis Chávez, who was not up for election that year, died. He was replaced on November 30, 1962, by Republican appointee Edwin L. Mechem. Additionally, Democrat Strom Thurmond became a Republican in 1964, further reducing Democrats to 66–34. This was the first time since 1932 that Democrats gained seats in this class of Senators.

This was the first time since 1914 that the president&#x27;s party gained seats in the Senate and lost seats in the House, this would occur again in 1970, 2018, and 2022.

== South Carolina ==


Incumbent Democratic Senator Olin D. Johnston defeated Governor Fritz Hollings in the Democratic primary and Republican W. D. Workman Jr. in the general election. The South Carolina Democratic Party held their primary on June 12, 1962. Olin D. Johnston, the incumbent Senator, faced stiff competition from Governor Fritz Hollings who argued that Johnston was too liberal and not representative of South Carolina interests. Johnston merely told the voters that he was doing what he thought was best for the agriculture and textile workers of the state. Hollings was decisively defeated by Johnston because Johnston used his position as Post Office and Civil Service Committee to build 40 new post offices in the state and thus demonstrate the pull he had in Washington to bring home the bacon.


W. D. Workman Jr., a correspondent for the &quot;News and Courier&quot;, faced no opposition from South Carolina Republicans and avoided a primary election.

Both Johnston and Workman supported segregation, so the campaign centered on the economic issues of the state. Workman tried to persuade the voters that Johnston&#x27;s policies were socialist and that he was too closely aligned with the Kennedy administration. Johnston was a consistent supporter of socialized health care proposals and Workman was able to win considerable support from the medical establishment. However, the state&#x27;s citizens were much poorer than that of the rest of the nation and Johnston&#x27;s class based appeals made him a very popular figure for the downtrodden of both the white and black races. The competitive nature of this race foresaw the eventual rise of the Republican Party and that South Carolinians were growing increasingly suspicious of policies generated at the federal level.

<text>Funky Divas is the second studio album by American recording group En Vogue, released by Atlantic Records division East West on March 24, 1992, in the United States. Conceived after the success of their Grammy Award–nominated debut album &quot;Born to Sing&quot; (1990), En Vogue reteamed with their founders Denzil Foster and Thomas McElroy to work on the entire album. As with &quot;Born to Sing&quot;, the pair borrowed from contemporary R&amp;B, new jack swing, and hip hop, while also incorporating classic soul, blues and doo-wop elements, particularly on its on two &quot;Sparkle&quot; cover versions, as well as, in the case of &quot;Free Your Mind,&quot; heavy metal sounds. The album became the quartet&#x27;s second album to earn a Grammy Award nomination in the Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals category at the 35th Annual Grammy Awards, while winning Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album at the American Music Awards of 1993 and the Sammy Davis Jr. Award for Entertainer of the Year at the 1993 Soul Train Music Awards.

&quot;Funky Divas&quot; debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B Albums chart, and at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while peaking at number four on the UK Albums Chart. It reached triple platinum status in the US, where it sold 3.5 million copies, becoming the seventh highest-selling R&amp;B albums of the year as well as En Vogue&#x27;s biggest-selling album to date. The album spawned five singles, including &quot;My Lovin&#x27; (You&#x27;re Never Gonna Get It)&quot;, Aretha Franklin cover &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel&quot;, &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;, &quot;Give It Up, Turn It Loose,&quot; and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Love You.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Funky Divas&quot; received generally positive reviews from music critics, but has since earned retrospective acclaim. Parry Gettelman from &quot;The Orlando Sentinel&quot; complimented Foster &amp; McElroy&#x27;s production on the album. While somewhat critical with the slower songs, she wrote that &quot;the pair has a knack for both melodies and killer grooves, and they&#x27;re gifted, playful arrangers.&quot; With the performances, Gettelman found that &quot;En Vogue interprets both the McElroy &amp; Foster tracks and three covers with style, verve and a lot of soul.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; writer Connie Johnson that the album was &quot;clearly groomed to offer a &#x27;90s slant to The Supremes&#x27; classy crossover image, En Vogue lifts ideas from James Brown and Aretha Franklin to create a sharper, more streetwise package.&quot; &quot;People&quot; magazine wrote that &quot;En Vogue succeeds best at light danceable funk embroidered with soaring, swooping vocals. Maybe the album title promises a bit more than what’s delivered. But &quot;Spunky Hip-Hop Gals Who Can Sing Their Fannies Off&quot; would have been just too long, we guess.&quot;

Arion Berger, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, felt that &quot;Funky Divas&quot; &quot;delivers flirtatious R&amp;B set to a mechanized beat [...] The four sweet-voiced members of En Vogue are versatile enough to handle reggae-, gospel- and doo-wop-tinted dance music with game if not very deep enthusiasm. Still, &quot;Funky Divas&quot; has an awkward charm.&quot; In her uneven review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist Danyel Smith wrote that &quot;En Vogue come off, on &quot;Funky Divas&quot;, as voluptuously voiced and impeccably rehearsed as they did on their 1990 debut, &quot;Born to Sing&quot;. But the audacious production that outfitted Dawn, Terry, Cindy and Maxine has not found its way to 1992.&quot; She felt that &quot;on the debut, the Sixties girl-group allusions were perfect enough to seem accidental, but this time they clunk around obviously and loudly, like there&#x27;s a fifth woman in an ugly dress singing along with Maxine, Cindy, Dawn and Terry – and she&#x27;s sadly off-key.&quot;

In his retrospective review, AllMusic editor Jose F. Promis wrote that &quot;combining sass, elegance, and class with amazing vocals and perfect production, this delightful set stands as one of the 1990s definitive pop albums.&quot; He found that the album &quot;is basically free of filler&quot; and called it the &quot;era&#x27;s most diverse, dazzling, and exciting pieces of work.&quot; In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the album 60th on its list of the 100 Best Albums of the &#x27;90s and second best album of the 90&#x27;s by a female group, while &quot;Complex&quot; magazine listed it 45th on its The 50 Best R&amp;B Albums of the &#x27;90s listing in 2017. &quot;Complex&quot; editor Craig Jenkins stated that while &quot;En Vogue&#x27;s 1990 debut &quot;Born to Sing&quot; introduced Cindy, Dawn, Maxine, and Terry&#x27;s throwback quartet-style harmonies to the world, the 1992 follow-up &quot;Funky Divas&quot; fashioned it into a weapon.&quot; He found that the album paved the way for other female bands such as TLC and Destiny&#x27;s Child. In 2020, Enio Chiola of &quot;PopMatters&quot; named it the most &quot;overlooked and underrated&quot; album of the 1990s.

==Chart performance==
In the United States, &quot;Funky Divas&quot; debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and reached the top spot on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart with first week sales of 60,000 units. A major commercial success, it became one of the biggest-selling R&amp;B albums of year, exceeding sales of more than 3.5 million copies domestically. It was eventually certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 24, 1993. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked &quot;Funky Divas &quot;25th on its &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 year-end chart, while ranking it seventh on the Top R&amp;B Albums year-end chart. As of 2018, it remain En Vogue&#x27;s highest-peaking album on both charts.

Internationally, &quot;Funky Divas&quot; reached the top forty of the national album charts in Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Sweden. A steady seller in Canada, the album eventually was certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA). The album reached its highest peak in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at number four on the UK Albums Chart and reached gold status, indicating sales in excess of 100,000 copies. With a worldwide sales total of 5 million, &quot;Funky Divas&quot; remains En Vogue&#x27;s biggest seller within their discography.

==Singles==
Lead single &quot;My Lovin&#x27; (You&#x27;re Never Gonna Get It)&quot; became an instant hit, peaking at number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and number 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The accompanying video for &quot;My Lovin&#x27;&quot; won a MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. The song samples the funk guitar line of James Brown&#x27;s 1973 song &quot;The Payback&quot; from the album of the same name. Second single &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel,&quot; a cover of the Aretha Franklin hit from the film &quot;Sparkle&quot; (1976), also became a top ten hit in the US. &quot;Funky Diva&quot;″s third single, the rock-infused &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;, became another top ten hit. In the UK, the song made the top 20. The video for &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; won three MTV Video Music Awards for Best R&amp;B Video, Best Dance Video and Best Choreography at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards.

By the time the fourth single, &quot;Give It Up, Turn It Loose&quot;, was released in late 1992, the &quot;Funky Divas&quot; album was already certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA. The single gave the group another UK top 40 hit. The fifth and final single released from &quot;Funky Divas&quot; was &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Love You&quot;, which was remixed for its release. The video for the single consists of clips from previous En Vogue videos &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel&quot;, &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;, as well as two of their 1990 videos &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Worry&quot;. A second edition of the album containing the later hits &quot;Runaway Love&quot; and &quot;Whatta Man&quot; (with Salt-N-Pepa) was released in the UK in 1994. This edition of &quot;Funky Divas&quot; also includes remixed versions of &quot;Hip Hop Lover&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Over Till the Fat Lady Sings&quot;, and &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Love You&quot; (a different remix from the US single release in 1993), along with slightly altered artwork inside the CD booklet.

<doc id="1177730" wikidata="Q5060150" url="?curid=1177730" title="Centinela Adobe">
<text>The Centinela Adobe, also known as La Casa de la Centinela, is a Spanish Colonial style adobe house built in 1834. It is operated as a house museum by the Historical Society of Centinela Valley, and it is one of the 43 surviving adobes within Los Angeles County, California. The Adobe was the seat of the Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela, a Mexican Alta California-era land grant partitioned from the Spanish Las Californias era Rancho Sausal Redondo centered around the Centinela Springs.

The Centinela Adobe, which is the Centinela Valley&#x27;s oldest residence, was built by Ygnacio Machado in 1834. Since then, farmers, ranchers, a Scotsman, and Inglewood&#x27;s founding father, Daniel Freeman, have lived in the structure. It is the oldest building in the area and has been called the &quot;Birthplace of Inglewood&quot;.

==History of the Ranchos and Centinela Adobe==
===Antonio Ygnacio Avila===
In 1822, after the Mexican War of Independence brought freedom for Mexico from Spain, Antonio Ygnacio Avila received a Mexican land grant for Rancho Sausal Redondo in Alta California, where he grazed cattle. The rancho&#x27;s lands encompass the present day cities of Redondo Beach, Inglewood, Hawthorne, El Segundo, Lawndale, Manhattan Beach, and Hermosa Beach.

===Ygnacio Machado - Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela===
In the early 1830s, Ygnacio Machado, son of one of the &quot;leather jacket soldiers&quot; who escorted the original settlers of Los Angeles, began cultivating a portion of the rancho. Ygnacio Machado&#x27;s brother Augustin Machado owned the nearby Rancho La Ballona, as well as the Rancho La Laguna and Rancho Santa Rosa. Ygnacio Machado became the grantee of a portion of Rancho Sausal Redondo, the Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela and built the &#x27;Centinela Adobe&#x27; in 1834 “of adobe brick upon foundation of field stones. Subsequent additions were built of wood frame with vertical wood sheathing…the original roof has been replaced with wood shingles.” Ygnacio Machado owned Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela only briefly, trading it in 1844 for a keg of whiskey and a small home in the Pueblo de Los Angeles.

===Robert Burnett===
The rancho changed hands several times in the 1850s, including a sale in 1859 for $930. Joseph Lancaster Brent bought the rancho the same year for $3,000, but when the American Civil War commenced in 1860, Brent returned to his home in the Southern states, where he served in the Confederate Army. Scotsman Robert Burnett purchased the rancho from Brent for $3,000 in 1860. Burnett added to the ranch, acquiring old Rancho Sausal Redondo for $29,500. By 1872, Burnett had a ranch that encompassed all of the land from what is now known as Playa del Rey to Lawndale and Redondo Beach.

===Daniel Freeman===
In 1873, Burnett returned to Scotland, leasing the ranch to Daniel Freeman, a recent arrival from Simcoe, Ontario, Canada. Writer Charles Nordoff stayed at the ranch in 1874 and wrote an article about Southern California ranch life for Harper&#x27;s &quot;The New Monthly Magazine&quot; saying: &quot;I looked around with some curiosity for this was the first time I had had an opportunity to see how the old Californians of wealth live.&quot; Nordoff found the adobe style of living &quot;poor and simple&quot; with a mix of &quot;squalor and splendor.&quot;

Freeman paid $7,500 per year in rent, and also had an option to purchase the ranch for $150,000. Freeman raised sheep and planted more than 10,000 trees, including 7,000 orange and 2,000 almond trees on the ranch. When a drought led to the death of 22,000 head of his sheep, Freeman turned to growing barley, and he eventually was producing a million barrels a year. In 1885, Freeman exercised the option to buy the ranch for $140,000 in gold. Freeman amassed a fortune farming barley, olives, lemons, limes, and almonds on the ranch and named his expansive land holding Inglewood, after his birthplace in Ontario. In 1887, the California Central Railway laid tracks to Redondo Beach, and Freeman sold off in small parcels as a settlement that became the city of Inglewood. In 1888, Freeman built a large mansion in Inglewood, and in 1889, he built the land office that now sits on the grounds of the Centinela Adobe. Eventually, all of the ranch were subdivided, and the only remaining portion of the ranch that remains is the site on which the Centinela Adobe is situated.

==Centinela Adobe Museum==
=== Adobe saved from demolition ===
The Centinela Adobe Complex has been described as the historical centerpiece of the area known as Centinela Valley, the lands extending from the Baldwin Hills to Palos Verdes, which comprised the Centinela Ranch. Yet, in the late 1940s, the adobe was threatened with demolition when the remaining land was subdivided to make room for new homes. Preservation-minded citizens raised money to purchase the property in 1950 and deeded it to City of Inglewood, which still maintains the adobe through the Parks and Recreation Department.

The Centinela Adobe Complex, and Freeman&#x27;s land office that was moved to the grounds, are available for docent-led tours

===Adobe museum===
The adobe has been restored and is operated jointly by the Historical Society of the Centinela Valley and the Inglewood Department of Parks and Recreation. The adobe and museum are located at 7634 Midfield Ave., a residential street abutting the 405 Freeway. It is open on Sundays from 2 to 4 p.m. Admission is free, and docents are available to provide tours. The adobe can be toured for groups or special occasions at other times by calling the Historical Society. The adobe is furnished with period furniture and artifacts from the late 19th century. In a 2001 profile of the museum in 2001, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote:&quot;The long, low, white stucco adobe with its porch and shingle roof looks as if it is sitting right in the middle of the 19th Century. But it&#x27;s not, as the nearby San Diego Freeway visibly demonstrates. It&#x27;s really a kind of time warp: the telltale sign of a modern metropolis on one side and the oldest home in the Centinela Valley on the other-still serene, still peaceful amid lawns, shrubs and shade trees.&quot;

===Freeman Land Office===

The Freeman Land Office, built in 1887 for the Centinela-Inglewood Land Company and originally located on Florence Avenue east of Eucalyptus Avenue, is also accessible as part of the tours. The building was used to sell plots of land for what became Inglewood. The building has been moved twice, most recently in 1975 to its present site next to the adobe. The land office building is well preserved and contains many artifacts and photographs.

===Heritage and research center===
The grounds also include a heritage and research center which opened in 1980. The research center houses items from the Daniel Freeman mansion, which was demolished in 1972. Items on display in the research center include Freeman&#x27;s library, safe, and furniture, as well as articles and photos about the history of Centinela Valley.

<doc id="1177731" wikidata="Q2826806" url="?curid=1177731" title="Urban agglomeration of Montreal">
<text>The urban agglomeration of Montreal () is an urban agglomeration in Quebec, Canada. Coextensive with the administrative region of [[Montreal]], it is a territory equivalent to a regional county municipality (TE) and a census division (CD), for both of which its geographical code is 66. Prior to the merger of the municipalities in &quot;Region 06&quot; in 2002, the administrative region was co-extensive with the Montreal Urban Community.

Located in the southern part of the province, the territory includes several of the islands of the Hochelaga Archipelago in the Saint Lawrence River, including the Island of Montreal, Nuns&#x27; Island (Île des Sœurs), Île Bizard, Saint Helen&#x27;s Island (Île Sainte-Hélène), Île Notre-Dame, Dorval Island (Île Dorval), and several others. Only the first three of these islands are inhabited.

The region is the second-smallest in area () and most populous (2,004,265 as of the 2021 Canadian Census) of Quebec&#x27;s seventeen administrative regions.

==Government==
The administrative region consists of the 2002–2005 territory of the city of Montreal. Following merger of the municipalities of the agglomeration on January 1, 2002, sixteen of its municipalities were reconstituted on January 1, 2006.

The urban agglomeration is governed by the Montreal Agglomeration Council (), which is composed of:

*the Mayor of Montreal as the ex-officio leader
*15 members from the Montreal City Council designated by the mayor, 
*the 14 mayors of the reconstituted cities,
*a member of the Dollard-des-Ormeaux City Council designated by that city&#x27;s mayor. 

The executive of the council is the Montreal Executive Committee, which can be headed by the Mayor of Montreal or a councillor the mayor appoints. The weighting of votes for the council breaks down to 87% for the City of Montreal, and 13% for the other municipalities of the Island of Montreal.

===Powers===
The agglomeration council is granted responsibility over:
*Municipal assessment
*public transportation
*Arterial road planning
*Local water resource management
*Water supply
*Public safety, including law enforcement, firefighting &amp; paramedic services.
*Municipal courts
*Economic development
*Public housing

And any other local responsibilities under the Municipal Powers Act. However, the city of Montreal is not obligated to execute these powers, and may delegate powers to local municipalities or other governing bodies.

Powers delegated to the Montreal Metropolitan Community (, CMM), the regional government of Greater Montreal, by the urban agglomeration include public housing, economic development, and water supply and water treatment. Responsibility for public transit is shared with the agglomeration directly appointing members to the RTM, the regional transportation authority, and indirectly appointing members to the ARTM, the regional public transport planning authority, via the Montreal Metropolitan Community.

<text>Slipper Island (Māori: &quot;Whakahau&quot;) is located to the east of the Coromandel Peninsula in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island and southeast of the town of Pauanui.

==History==

Approximately 18,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum when sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels, Slipper Island was connected to the Coromandel by a vast coastal plain. Sea levels began to rise 7,000 years ago, after which the island was separated from the rest of New Zealand. When sea levels were lower, the Tairua River flowed between modern Slipper Island and Shoe Island / Motuhoa, travelling eastwards towards the Pacific Ocean.

There is evidence that the island was the site of early activity of New Zealand&#x27;s first Māori settlers on their arrival around 1300AD, principally by the discovery of a tropical pearl shell lure in 2001. There are also eight Pā sites and other evidence of occupation such as middens. Numerous moa bone blanks used by early East Polynesian settlers for making fish hooks have also been found. The Island is considered wahi tapu, or sacred to iwi, the Ngāti Maru Runanga and Ngāti Hei. Tuokiokio was the last Māori chief, or rangatira, of Whakahau.

The island was used as a farm from the mid to late 19th century. More recent farm owners included the Normans, later of Opoutere, and the Needhams who purchased the island around 1970. About 217ha (95 per cent) of the island was later set up as a resort by the Needham family, Abe and Nora and their 14 children. This was sold to Auckland-based property developer Wendy Weimei Wu in 2015. The guests and tourists used the then only habitation on the island, the resort of six chalets and the family homestead.

The balance of the island, seven hectares around South Bay, has been subdivided. The television programme &quot;Grand Designs New Zealand&quot; featured the building of a new house on this land in October 2017.

Several smaller islets (including Penguin Island and Rabbit Island) are found off its southern tip, and the 40-hectare Shoe Island / Motuhoa lies to the northwest.

<text>The NatWest Pro40 League was a one-day cricket league for first-class cricket counties in England and Wales. It was inaugurated in 1999, but was essentially the old Sunday League retitled to reflect large numbers of matches being played on days other than Sunday.

==Sunday League==
The Sunday League was launched in 1969, as the second one-day competition in England and Wales alongside the Gillette Cup (launched in 1963). Sponsored by John Player &amp; Sons, the league was called John Player&#x27;s County League (1969), the John Player League (1970–83), then the John Player Special League (1984–86). The 17 counties of the time played each other in a league format on Sunday afternoons throughout the season. These matches were concise enough to be shown on television, with BBC2 broadcasting one match each week in full until 1980, and then as part of the &quot;Sunday Grandstand&quot; multi-sport programme. For close finishes for the title, cameras appeared at the grounds where the contenders for the title were competing and the trophy presentation to the victorious team would be on film.

Refuge Assurance replaced John Player Special as the sponsor of the competition, called the Refuge Assurance League, in 1987. In 1988 they introduced an end-of-season play-off competition known as the Refuge Assurance Cup. The top four teams of the league season qualified for this competition, with the first-placed team playing the fourth and the second-placed team playing the third, and the winners of these matches meeting in a final at a neutral venue. This competition lasted until 1991.

On Friday 5 July 1991, Somerset played Lancashire at Taunton in the first Sunday League match not to be played on a Sunday.

The Sunday League was not sponsored in 1992 (Durham making its debut in the competition this season), but in 1993 AXA Equity and Law became the sponsor. The matches this season were 50 overs per innings. The first round of matches that took place on 9 May 1993 were the first official matches in England to be played in coloured clothing and with a white ball. The following season the competition reverted to 40 overs per innings. On Wednesday 23 July 1997 Warwickshire played Somerset at Edgbaston in the first competitive county game to be played under floodlights.

==National League==
The National League was launched in 1999 with the 18 first-class counties split into two divisions with three teams promoted and relegated from each. The matches were played over 45 overs and the competition was sponsored by Norwich Union. Matches were spread over the week rather than Sundays only.

The counties incorporated nicknames into their official names for the National League, from 2002. For example, Kent became the &#x27;Spitfires&#x27;, Middlesex the &#x27;Crusaders&#x27; and Lancashire were the &#x27;Lightning&#x27;. The following season the Scotland Saltires took part in the League until 2005.

The C &amp; G Trophy was restructured, in 2006, from a knock-out competition to a round-robin league format, which took up the early part of the season. The National League was renamed the &#x27;NatWest Pro40&#x27; and was played in the later part of the season with the teams playing each other once. Also, two teams instead of three were promoted to the first division and two relegated to the second division. A third promotion/relegation spot was determined in a play-off game between the team third from top in the second division and third from bottom team in the first.

==Replacement==
In July 2009, the ECB unveiled plans for a revamped county structure involving three competitions, one of which would replace both the Pro40 and the Friends Provident Trophy.

On 27 August 2009, this new competition was announced as a 40-overs-per-innings tournament, similar to the Pro40. The ECB 40, also known as the Clydesdale Bank 40 for sponsorship reasons, would serve as one of the three competitions in county cricket for the next four years, along with the County Championship and the Friends Provident t20.

<doc id="1177740" wikidata="Q540782" url="?curid=1177740" title="Anglican Church of Canada">
<text>The Anglican Church of Canada (ACC or ACoC) is the province of the Anglican Communion in Canada. The official French-language name is &quot;l&#x27;Église anglicane du Canada&quot;. In 2022, the Anglican Church counted 294,931 members on parish rolls in 1,978 congregations, organized into 1,498 parishes. The 2021 Canadian census counted 1,134,315 self-identified Anglicans (3.1 percent of the total Canadian population), making the Anglican Church the third-largest Canadian church after the Catholic Church and the United Church of Canada.

Like other Anglican churches, the Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s liturgy utilizes a native version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the 1962 prayer book. An alternative liturgical resource was developed in 1985 titled the &quot;Book of Alternative Services&quot;, which has developed into the dominant liturgical book of the church.

Unlike in the United Kingdom, the past title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; in the title of the Canadian sovereign did not officially refer to the Christian faith, or to the Anglican Church of Canada. However, two out of three Chapels Royal in Canada are consecrated Anglican chapels.

==Official names==

Until 1955, the Anglican Church of Canada was known as the &quot;Church of England in the Dominion of Canada&quot; or simply the &quot;Church of England in Canada&quot;. In 1977, the church&#x27;s General Synod adopted &quot;l&#x27;Église episcopale du Canada&quot; as its French-language name. This name was replaced with the current one, &quot;l&#x27;Église anglicane du Canada&quot;, in 1989; however, the former name is still used in some places along with the new one.

A matter of some confusion for Anglicans elsewhere in the world is that while the Anglican Church of Canada is a province of the Anglican Communion, the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada is merely one of four such ecclesiastical provinces of the Anglican Church of Canada. This confusion is furthered by the fact that Canada has ten civil provinces, along with three territories.

In recent years, there have been attempts by splinter groups to incorporate under very similar names. Corporations Canada, the agency of the federal government which has jurisdiction over federally-incorporated companies, ruled on 12 September 2005 that a group of dissident Anglicans may not use the name &quot;Anglican Communion in Canada&quot;, holding that in Canada, the term &quot;Anglican Communion&quot; is associated only with the Anglican Church of Canada, being the Canadian denomination which belongs to that international body.

==History==
===Anglicanism in British North America===

The Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s prayer book commemorates John Cabot&#x27;s landing on Newfoundland on 24 June 1497.

The first Church of England service was a celebration of Holy Communion at Frobisher Bay around 3 September 1578 by the chaplain on Martin Frobisher&#x27;s voyage to the Arctic. The chaplain was Maister Wolfall (probably Robert Wolfall), minister and preacher&#x27;, who had been charged by Queen Elizabeth &#x27;to serve God twice a day.

The propagation of the Church of England occurred in three ways. One way was by officers of ships and lay military and civil officials reading services from the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; regularly when no clergy were present. For example, in the charter issued by Charles I for Newfoundland in 1633 was this directive: &quot;On Sundays Divine Service to be said by some of the Masters of ships, such prayers as are in the Book of Common Prayer&quot;. A second way was the direct appointing and employing of clergy by the English government on ships and in settlements. A third way was the employment of clergy by private &quot;adventurous&quot; companies.

The first documented resident Church of England cleric on Canadian soil was Erasmus Stourton, who arrived at the &quot;Sea Forest Plantation&quot; at Ferryland, Newfoundland, in 1612 under the patronage of Lords Bacon and Baltimore. Stourton was of the Puritan party and remained in Ferryland until returning to England in 1628.

The overseas development of the Church of England in British North America challenged the insular view of the church at home. The editors of the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; found that they had to address the spiritual concerns of the contemporary adventurer. In the 1662 Preface, the editors note:

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company sent out its first chaplain in 1683, and where there was no chaplain the officers of the company were directed to read prayers from the BCP on Sundays.

Members of the Church of England established the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge (SPCK) in 1698, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) in 1701, and the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1799. These and other organizations directly financed and sent missionaries to establish the English Church in Canada and to convert Canada&#x27;s First Nations people. Direct aid of this sort lasted up to the 1940s.

The first Anglican church in Newfoundland and in Canada was the small garrison chapel at St John&#x27;s Fort built sometime before 1698. The first continuously resident cleric of the chapel was John Jackson – a Royal Navy chaplain who had settled in St. John&#x27;s and was supported (but not financially) by the SPCK in 1698. In 1701, the SPG took over the patronage of St John&#x27;s. Jackson continued to receive little actual support and was replaced by Jacob Rice in 1709. Rice wrote a letter to the Bishop of London detailing his efforts to repair the church which had been &quot;most unchristianly defaced&quot; and asking for help in acquiring communion vessels, a pulpit cloth, surplices and glass for the windows. The garrison chapel was replaced in 1720 and in 1759. The Cathedral of St John the Baptist in St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, is the oldest Anglican parish in Canada, founded in 1699 in response to a petition drafted by the Anglican townsfolk of St John&#x27;s and sent to the Bishop of London, Henry Compton.
The first Anglican services in Nova Scotia are dated from 1710 when a New England army from Boston with assistance of the Royal Navy captured for the fourth time Port Royal in Nova Scotia and renamed it Annapolis Royal. When Annapolis was captured, one of the chaplains, John Harrison, held a service of thanksgiving with Samuel Hesker, the chaplain of the Marines, preaching the sermon. When the war ended in 1713 with the Treaty of Utrecht, Harrison continued to act as chaplain to the Garrison at Annapolis Royal.
The oldest Anglican church in Canada still standing is St Paul&#x27;s Church in Halifax, Nova Scotia, whose foundation stone – the church is a wood structure – was laid by the Nova Scotia governor on 13 June 1750. St. Paul&#x27;s opened for services on 2 September 1750 with an SPG cleric, William Tutty, preaching. St Paul&#x27;s became the first Anglican cathedral in all of North America when Charles Inglis was appointed bishop in 1787. It has been a parish church since 1845 when St. Lukes Pro-Cathedral in Halifax replaced it. The Church of All Saints in Halifax was made the cathedral of the Nova Scotian diocese in 1910 and remains as such to date.

===After the American Revolution===
Anglicans were a more numerous minority among the United Empire Loyalists who fled to Canada after the American Revolution than Anglicans had been in the Thirteen Colonies as a whole (in 1775, 70–90% of the white population was not formally affiliated with a church). The Anglican Church was a dominant feature of the compact governments that presided over the colonies in British North America.

One of the former Americans was Charles Inglis who was rector of Trinity Church in New York when George Washington was in the congregation. He became the first bishop of the diocese of Nova Scotia on 12 August 1787 and the first Church of England bishop of a diocese outside the United Kingdom and in the British Empire. The Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s Prayer Book commemorates Inglis on 12 August.

There were historical connections between the Episcopal Church in the United States of America and the Anglican Church of Canada. Samuel Seabury and Inglis knew each other. In March 1783, a group of eighteen clergy – most prominent was Charles Inglis – met in New York to discuss the future of Nova Scotia, including plans for the appointment of a bishop in Nova Scotia and the college that would in time become the University of King&#x27;s College, Halifax.
The connections between the now administratively separated churches continued in many ways. In the summer of 1857, Bishop Thomas F. Scott of Oregon visited Victoria and confirmed twenty candidates as the first British Columbian bishop would not be appointed for another two years. From the 1890s to 1902, Henry Irving (also known as Father Pat) was licensed in both the Diocese of Kootenay and the Diocese of Spokane – the two dioceses meet at the border between B.C. and the state of Washington. As Irving told his friends, he was


After the conquest of Quebec and the American Revolution, many leading Anglicans argued for the Church of England to become the established church in the Canadian colonies. The Constitutional Act of 1791 was promulgated, and interpreted to mean that the Church of England was the established church in the Canadas. The Church of England was established by law in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. In Lower Canada, the presence of a Roman Catholic majority made establishment in that province politically unwise. Bishop John Strachan of Toronto was a particular champion of the prerogatives of the Church of England.

The secular history of Canada depicts Bishop Strachan as an ally of the landed gentry of the so-called Family Compact of Upper Canada, opposed to the political aspirations of farmers and bourgeoisie for responsible government. Nonetheless, Strachan played considerable part in promoting education, as founder of Kings College (now the University of Toronto) and Trinity College. The Clergy reserves, land which had been reserved for use by the non-Roman Catholic clergy, became a major issue in the mid-19th century. Anglicans argued that the land was meant for their exclusive use, while other denominations demanded that it be divided among them.

In Upper Canada, leading dissenters such as Methodist minister Egerton Ryerson – in due course a minister of education in the government of Upper Canada – agitated against establishment. Following the Upper Canada Rebellion, the creation of the united Province of Canada, and the implementation of responsible government in the 1840s, the unpopularity of the Anglican-dominated Family Compact made establishment a moot point. The church was disestablished in Nova Scotia in 1850 and Upper Canada in 1854. By the time of Confederation in 1867, the Church of England was disestablished throughout British North America.

===Autonomy and interdependence===
Until the 1830s, the Anglican church in Canada was synonymous with the Church of England: bishops were appointed and priests supplied by the church in England and funding for the church came from the British Parliament. The first Canadian synods were established in the 1850s, giving the Canadian church a degree of self-government. As a result of the UK Privy Council decision of &quot;Long v. Gray&quot; in 1861, all Anglican churches in colonies of the British Empire became self-governing. Even so, the first General Synod for all of Canada was not held until 1893. That first synod made the Solemn Declaration 1893, which declares that the Church of England in the Dominion of Canada is &quot;in full communion with the Church of England throughout the world, . . . and in fellowship of the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church&quot;. Robert Machray was chosen as the Canadian church&#x27;s first Primate.

===Expansion===
As the new Canadian nation expanded after Confederation in 1867, so too did the Anglican Church. After the establishment of the first ecclesiastical province – that of Canada in 1860 – others followed. The first was the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert&#x27;s Land, created in 1875 to encompass Anglican dioceses outside what were then the boundaries of Canada: present-day Northern Ontario and Northern Quebec, the western provinces, and the Territories. In the forty years between self-government in 1861 and 1900, sixteen of the currently existing dioceses were created, as numbers blossomed with accelerating immigration from England, Scotland, and Ireland. The far-flung nature of settlement in the North-West together with a shortage of resources to pay stipendiary clergy early led to a significant reliance on women lay workers, deemed &quot;deaconesses&quot;, for missionary outreach, a phenomenon which made the first ordination of women to the priesthood in 1976 relatively uncontroversial at small churches and in indigenous communities. By 2016, over 35% of ACC clergy were women, though some parishes would not accept female priests.
During this time, the Anglican Church assumed &quot;de facto&quot; administrative responsibility in the far-flung wilderness of Canada and British North America. The church contracted with colonial officials and later the federal Crown to administer residential schools for the indigenous peoples of the First Nations. Such schools removed children from their home communities in an attempt to forcibly assimilate them into the dominant European culture and language and adapt them as a menial labour workforce. Emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of the children was rife in these schools, as well as sickness and malnutrition.

At the same time, Anglican missionaries were involved in advocating for First Nations rights and land claims on behalf of those people to whom they were ministering (for example, the Nisga&#x27;a of northern British Columbia). One of the earliest First Nations students to be educated at Red River in the 1830s was Henry Budd. He was ordained in 1850 as the first First Nations priest and became the missionary at Fort Cumberland on the Saskatchewan River and then to the post of The Pas. The Anglican Church of Canada&#x27;s Prayer Book commemorates Henry Budd on 2 April.

Despite this growth in both the size and role of the church, progress was intermittently undermined by internal conflict over churchmanship. This was manifested in the creation of competing theological schools (Trinity versus Wycliffe Colleges in the University of Toronto, for example), a refusal by bishops of one ecclesiastical party to ordain those of the other, and – in the most extreme cases – schism. This latter phenomenon was famously and acrimoniously borne out in the high profile defection of Edward Cridge, the Dean of the Diocese of British Columbia in Victoria, B.C., together with much of his cathedral congregation, to the Reformed Episcopal Church in 1874, although the movement was ultimately confined to that one congregation in a then-remote town together with a second parish in New Westminster, the then-capital of the originally separate mainland colony of British Columbia.

====Overseas mission====
In 1888, the church began its missionary activities in Central Japan, which would later result in the formation of the Diocese of Chubu in the Anglican Church in Japan. A Church of England conference held in Winnipeg in August 1890 established the union of all synods. Missionaries from Canada to Japan included Archdeacon Alexander Croft Shaw, minister to the British Legation in Tokyo, J. G. Waller in Nagano, and Margaret Young in Nagoya. Later in 1902, the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada (MSCC) was created to support overseas mission by combining the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society (DFMS, 1883–1902), the Canadian Church Missionary Society (CCMS, 1894–1903) and the Woman’s Auxiliary (1885–1966) to DFMS.

===Twentieth century===
Expansion evolved into a general complacency as the 20th century progressed. During the early part of this period, the ACC reinforced its traditional role as the establishment church, although influences from the autochthonous Protestant social gospel movement, and the Christian socialism of elements in the Church of England increasingly were felt. This influence would eventually result in the creation of what would come to be known as the Primate&#x27;s World Relief and Development Fund, in 1958.

By the middle of the century, pressure to reform the structures of the church were being felt. The name of the church was changed in 1955 from &quot;The Church of England in Canada&quot; to the &quot;Anglican Church of Canada&quot; and a major revision of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; was undertaken in 1962, the first in over forty years. In 1962, the United Church of Canada and the Anglican Church of Canada jointly published &quot;Growth in Understanding&quot;, a study guide on union and, on 1 June 1965, the &quot;Principles of Union&quot; between the United Church and the Anglican Church. Despite these changes, the church was still perceived as complacent and disengaged, a view emphasized by the title of Pierre Berton&#x27;s best-selling commissioned analysis of the denomination, &quot;The Comfortable Pew&quot;, published in 1965.

Change became more rapid towards the close of the 1960s, as mainline churches including the Anglicans began to see the first wave of evaporation from the pews. On 23 August 1967, the Anglican Church of Canada agreed to permit the remarriage of divorced persons in their churches. Ecumenical relationships were intensified, with a view to full communion. While negotiations with the largest Canadian Protestant denomination, the United Church of Canada, faltered in the early 1970s, the Anglican Church achieved full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada as the century drew to a close.

New liturgical resources were introduced, which would culminate in the publication of the Book of Alternative Services in 1985. Agitation for the ordination of women led to the vote on 18 June 1975, by the Anglican Church of Canada in favour of ordination as priests, and, eventually, bishops. Social and cultural change led to the church&#x27;s decision to marry divorced couples, to endorse certain forms of contraception, and to move towards greater inclusion of homosexual people in the life of the church.

These changes have been accompanied by a massive decline in numbers, with a majority (53%) leaving the denomination in the period from 1961 to 2001, according to an independent survey. In the 21st century, numerical decline has continued. From 2001 to 2022, parish membership declined from 641,845 to 294,931, a decline of 54%. From 2001 to 2011, according to the Canadian census, self-identified Anglicans declined from 2,035,500 to 1,631,845, a decline of 19.8% in absolute terms and a drop in the proportion of the Canadian population from 6.9% to 5%. The number of self-identified Anglicans further declined to little more than 1 million in 2021, amounting to 3,1% of Canadians.

===Twenty-first century===
In the twenty-first century a division in the Anglican Communion developed when more conservative churches opposed liberal positions on issues such as same-sex marriage and acceptance of homosexuality. The Anglican realignment was reflected in Canada with the development of the Anglican Essentials Canada, the Anglican Network in Canada (aligned with the Anglican Church in North America) and Anglican Coalition in Canada (aligned with the Anglican Mission in the Americas) made up of conservative churches and their congregants and which have either separated from or dissent within the Anglican Church of Canada.

==Structure==
Anglican Christians around the world are held together by common forms of worship, such as the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; and its modern alternatives, which embody its doctrine. Other formularies, such as the Ordinal, the Thirty-Nine Articles and the First and Second Book of Homilies provide a shared theological tradition. Other instruments of unity in the Anglican Communion are, locally, its bishops and, internationally, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and, in more recent times, the Lambeth Conferences, the Anglican Communion Primates&#x27; Meeting, and the biennial Anglican Consultative Council. These last four instruments of unity have moral but not legislative authority over individual provinces.

In Canada, Anglican bishops have divested some of their authority to three bodies – the General Synod, the Provincial Synod (there are four in Canada) and the diocesan synods (there are 29).

The national church in Canada is structured on the typical Anglican model of a presiding archbishop (the Primate) and Synod.

In 2007 the church considered rationalizing its increasingly top-heavy episcopal structure as its membership waned, which could have meant a substantial reduction in the number of dioceses, bishops and cathedrals.

===Houses of Bishops===
Diocesan bishops promise &quot;to hold and maintain the Doctrine, Sacraments and discipline of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded in his holy Word, and as the Anglican Church of Canada hath received and set forth the same.&quot; They work collegially as a House of Bishops. There is a national House of Bishops, which meets regularly throughout the year, as well as provincial houses of bishops. These are chaired, respectively, by the Primate and the individual metropolitans.

===Primate===

The Primate of the ACC – originally the &quot;Primate of All Canada&quot; in echo of the titles of the Archbishops of Canterbury and York in England and to distinguish the national church from the Ecclesiastical Province of Canada (the former territory of Lower Canada, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland) – is elected by General Synod from among all the bishops of the Anglican Church of Canada. Primates hold the &quot;ex officio&quot; rank of archbishop; in 1931 the General Synod approved a recommendation that a fixed primatial See (as of the Archbishop of Canterbury) be established and in 1955 it was recommended that &quot;a small See [be created] in the vicinity of Ottawa to which the Dioceses of The Arctic, Moosonee, Keewatin and Yukon would be attached, forming a fifth Province.&quot; However, General Synod rejected the proposal in 1959 and in 1969 &quot;the Canon on the Primacy was amended to require the Primate to maintain an office at the national headquarters of the Church, with a pastoral relationship to the whole Church, but no fixed Primatial See&quot; as with Presiding Bishops of the Episcopal Church of the USA and unlike Primates of England, Australia and elsewhere. In consequence, Primates of the Anglican Church of Canada are not diocesan bishops and generally do not carry out ordinary episcopal functions; the office was originally held office for life but in recent years Primates have retired by the age of 70.

In recent decades Primates of the ACC have intermittently held a considerable place in public life. In particular, Archbishop Ted Scott, who was a president of the World Council of Churches, was a member of a Commonwealth Eminent Persons committee in respect of the devolution of power from the white-only government of South Africa to a multiracial government. Scott&#x27;s successor, Michael Peers, continued the close association with the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa and was thrust into a high profile in Canadian national life when he insisted that the ACC should shoulder its responsibilities for the legacy of the Indian Residential Schools, and when he protested at what he described as the downplaying of Christian witness in the official commemoration of events of national importance.

There have been thirteen primates in the history of the church. The current acting primate is Anne Germond, who succeeded Linda Nicholls, formerly the bishop of the Diocese of Huron. Nicholls, who was elected on the third ballot at the July 2019 General Synod, was the first woman to head the Anglican Church of Canada as well as the second female primate in the Anglican Communion. Nicholls retired from the ministry on 15 September 2024, one month before reaching the mandatory age of 70, and was succeeded by Germond, the current metropolitan of the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario, in an acting role until the election of the next primate. 

===General Synod===

The chief synodical governing body of the church is the General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada. The Declaration of Principles in the General Synod Handbook contains: the Solemn Declaration 1893; the Basis of Constitution; and the Fundamental Principles previously adopted by the Synod in 1893 and these constitute the foundation of the Synod structure. The General Synod meets triennially and consists of lay people, clergy, and bishops from each of the 29 dioceses. In-between General Synods, the day-to-day affairs of the ACC are administered by a group elected by General Synod, called the Council of General Synod (COGS), which consults with and directs national staff working at the church&#x27;s headquarters in Toronto.

Each diocese holds annual diocesan synods from which lay and clergy delegates are elected as representatives to General Synod, the national deliberative body, which meets triennially. These delegates join the Primate and the bishops of the church to form three Orders – lay, clergy, and bishops. The most recent general synod was in 2019 and met in Vancouver.

General Synod has authority to define &quot;the doctrines of the Church in harmony with the Solemn Declaration 1893&quot;, and over matters of discipline, and canon law of the national church, in addition to more prosaic matters of administration and policy. At each diocesan synod, the three houses elect representatives to sit on the Council of General Synod, which – with the Primate – acts as the governing authority of the national church in-between synods.

===Provinces, dioceses and parishes===

The ACC is divided into four ecclesiastical provinces – British Columbia and the Yukon, Canada (encompassing the Atlantic provinces and Quebec), Ontario, and Northern Lights (encompassing the prairie provinces, Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and portions of Ontario). Within the provinces are 29 dioceses and one grouping of churches in British Columbia that functions equivalently to a diocese.

Each province has its own archbishop, known as the Metropolitan, and each diocese has a bishop, although there are no metropolitical dioceses (or archdioceses) as such; a metropolitan is styled &quot;Archbishop of [his or her own diocese], and Metropolitan of [the ecclesiastical province].&quot;

As with other churches in the Anglican tradition, each diocese is divided up into geographical regions called parishes, where certain authority resides in the rector or priest-in-charge (as laid out in the induction service, the ordinal, and the cleric&#x27;s licence) and in the parish council (or vestry) as defined in diocesan canons. The legal relationship between a parish and its diocese and between a parish and its synod varies around the country and even within dioceses depending in part on when each was established.

Both dioceses and provinces hold synods, usually annually, consisting of the active diocesan clergy and lay delegates elected by parish churches. Diocesan synods elect lay and clergy delegates to provincial synod. On the diocesan level, there are effectively two houses instead of three – clergy and laity – with the diocesan bishop required to give assent to motions passed by synod.

Between 1995 and 1997 over 500 parishes closed. Of all the mainline churches in Canada, the Anglican Church of Canada has the most precipitous drop in members; according to its own records, a reduction of 10% in membership occurs annually.

==Ecumenical relations==
The ACC is a member of the World Council of Churches and Archbishop Ted Scott was a president of that body; the ACC has been an active participant in the Canadian Council of Churches from its establishment in 1944. Through the 1960s the ACC was involved in talks with the United Church of Canada and the Disciples of Christ with a view to institutional union, in the course of which a comprehensive Plan of Union was formulated and a joint Anglican-United Church hymnal produced in 1971. Ultimately such talks foundered when the Houses of Laity and Clergy voted in favour of union but the House of Bishops vetoed it, largely due to concerns over the maintenance of the apostolic succession of the episcopacy.

In 2001, the ACC established full communion with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada (ELCIC), both of which operate in Canada. In 2019, full communion was regularized to apply between the mainline Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches in the United States and in Canada, resulting in a full communion status with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 2023, full communion was extended to the Northern Province of the Moravian Church in North America, by an agreement with the ELCIC and the ACC. Two other churches with which the Anglican Church of Canada is in full communion via the Anglican Communion operate in Canada, being the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the Church of South India.

Through the Anglican Communion, the ACC is also in full communion with the churches of the Old Catholic Union of Utrecht and the Philippine Independent Church, of which there are none in Canada. As there are no Utrecht Union or Philippine Independent communities in Canada, the ACC provides for the spiritual care of those members of those churches while they are in the country. However, unlike the Anglican Churches of the British Isles, it is not a signatory to the Porvoo Agreement which established full communion between those bodies and a number of European Lutheran churches.

Contrary to the practice in Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox communions, all baptized Christians are welcome to receive Holy Communion in Canadian Anglican churches, in accordance with the resolution in favour of open communion at the 1968 Lambeth Conference.

==Liturgy and service books==

In 1918 and 1962 the ACC produced successive authoritative Canadian &quot;Books of Common Prayer&quot; (BCPs), substantially based on the 1662 English prayer book; both were conservative revisions consisting largely of minor editorial emendations of archaic diction. The 1962 Canadian prayer book is still in regular use throughout the ACC, and has been translated into a number of languages. The French translation, &quot;Le Recueil des Prières de la Communauté Chrétienne&quot;, was published in 1967.

In 1985 the &quot;Book of Alternative Services&quot; (BAS) was issued, officially not designated to supersede but to be used alongside the 1962 prayer book. It is a more thoroughgoing modernizing of Canadian Anglican liturgies, containing considerable borrowings from Lutheran, Church of England, American Episcopal and post-Second Vatican Council Roman Rite Catholic service books; it was received with general enthusiasm and in practice has largely supplanted the Book of Common Prayer, although the BCP remains the official Liturgy of the Church in Canada. The preference for the BAS among many parishes and clergy has been countered by the founding of the Prayer Book Society of Canada, which seeks &quot;to promote the understanding and use of the BCP as a spiritual system of nurture for life in Christ&quot;. The tension between adherents of the BCP and advocates of the BAS has contributed to a sense of disaffection within the church. There have been increasing calls for revision of the Book of Alternative Services. Those who use the BAS have cited various shortcomings as it ages and newer liturgies are produced elsewhere in the Communion. At the 2007 General Synod, a resolution was passed which will begin the process of revising the modern language liturgies.

Hymnody is an important aspect of worship in Anglicanism, and the ACC is no different. There is no one hymnal required to be used, although the ACC has produced four successive authorized versions since 1908. The most recent, &quot;Common Praise&quot;, was published in 1998. Anglican plainsong is represented in the new hymnal, as well as in the older &quot;Canadian Psalter&quot;, published in 1963. Notable Canadian Anglican hymnists include Derek Holman, Gordon Light, Herbert O&#x27;Driscoll, and Healey Willan. For a time, beginning in the early 1970s, many Anglican congregations experimented with &quot;The Hymn Book&quot; produced jointly with the United Church of Canada under the direction of Canadian composer F. R. C. Clarke, but both churches have since abandoned the common hymnal.

Like most churches of the Anglican Communion, the ACC was beset by intense conflict over the ritualism controversies of the latter 19th century, leading in some extreme cases to schism. Throughout much of the 20th century, parishes – and, to a certain extent, dioceses or regions – were more or less divided between high church (Anglo-Catholic), low church (evangelical), and broad church (middle-of-the-road). Many of these designations have become muted with time, as the passions which fired the debate have cooled and most parishes have found a happy medium or accommodation.

==Social issues and theological division==
As is the case in churches directly influenced by Anglican ethos and theology, the ACC tends to reflect the dominant social and cultural strains of the nation in which it finds itself. For most of its history, the ACC embodied the conservative, colonial outlook of its mostly British-descended parishioners and of English Canada as a whole. In the post-World War II period, as the character of Canada changed, so too did the attitudes of people in the pews, and by extension, the church.

===Ordination of women and remarriage of divorced persons===
In recent years the ACC has been a leading progressive force within the Anglican Communion. In the 1970s the then primate, Ted Scott, argued at the Lambeth Conference in favour of women&#x27;s ordination. The ACC ordained its first woman as a priest in 1976 and its first woman as a bishop in 1993. Many parishes, particularly in the west and even more particularly on aboriginal reserves, were already served by women deacons and allowing them to be ordained priests regularized their situation and permitted a regular sacramental ministry to be available in the parishes they served. Nonetheless, this change – in concert with such moves as allowing the remarriage of divorced persons – caused strains among more conservative parishes, both Anglo-Catholic and Evangelical. In the early 1970s some members of the ACC left to join breakaway Anglican groups such as the small Anglican Catholic Church of Canada.

===Life issues===
The ACC has taken a moderate anti-abortion stance in the past. The official policy is that &quot;abortion is always the taking of a human life and, in our view, should never be done except for serious therapeutic reasons.&quot; In 1989, the ACC stated that &quot;In the light of the Government&#x27;s announcement of a new Abortion Bill, the Anglican Church reaffirms its position that both the rights and needs of women, and the rights and needs of the unborn, require protection.&quot; The ACC has not released any official statement on abortion since then.

The ACC also firmly opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide.

===Inclusion of gays and lesbians and same-sex unions===

In 2002, the Synod of the Diocese of New Westminster (located in Vancouver and the south-west of British Columbia) voted to permit the blessing of same-sex unions by parishes requesting episcopal authorization to do so. Since then another ten dioceses (Edmonton, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, Winnipeg-based Rupert&#x27;s Land, Ottawa, Toronto, London-based Huron, Quebec, Hamilton-based Niagara, Montreal and Victoria-based British Columbia
) have followed suit. The Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior (formerly the Diocese of Cariboo and now known as the Territory of the People) also permit such rites. 
On 30 September 2012, the Bishop of Saskatoon ordained as deacon a person who is civilly married to a person of the same sex. Also in 2012, the Diocese of Montreal ordained two openly gay and partnered men to the priesthood.

In 2016, a proposal to change the marriage canon to include same-sex marriage received 2/3 in favour in all three houses and was passed; a Second Reading in 2019 failed, due to not reaching a 2/3 majority in the House of Bishops. The dioceses of Niagara and Ottawa, both of which already allowed blessing rites, announced after the 2016 vote that they would immediately allow same-sex marriages. In 2019, the General Synod approved a resolution which allows each provincial synod and diocese to bless or perform same-sex marriages if they choose to do so.

The Diocese of Toronto has specifically allowed churches to perform same-sex marriages as of mid-November 2016 when Archbishop Colin Johnson issued the Pastoral Guidelines for Same-Sex Marriages. In brief, the guidelines stated that such marriages could proceed in the church &quot;at the pastoral discretion of the Bishop and with the agreement of local clergy&quot;. Also in 2016, the Diocese elected the first openly gay and partnered bishop.

The General Synod held the second reading of a motion to approve same-sex marriage on 12 July 2019. In spite of support by the laity and clergy, the motion did not pass because it was not supported by a full two-thirds of the bishops. Director of Communications Meghan Kilty told CBC News that many dioceses have been performing same-sex marriages, such as that of bishop Kevin Robertson in December 2018 at the Cathedral Church of St. James (Toronto). Kilty added that many Canadian dioceses would continue to perform such services since the church had not specifically prohibited the practice. At the same General Synod, a resolution, called &quot;A Word to the Church&quot;, was approved that recognised that a diocese may choose to perform same-sex marriages.

===Indian residential schools===

During the 19th century the federal Crown delegated the operation of Indian residential schools to the ACC and Roman Catholic religious orders (with some minimal involvement by the Methodist and Presbyterian churches of Canada as well). In the 1980s numerous tort claims were brought by former students of such schools against both the Crown and church organizations in respect of abuse by church personnel in such institutions and to a lesser extent in respect of a perception that such schools had been insensitive to issues of preservation of aboriginal culture and identity.

The claims were ultimately comprehensively settled but the damage to the morale of the ACC has yet to be entirely resolved: the Diocese of Cariboo was obliged to declare bankruptcy and was liquidated — its successor is the Territory of the People (called the Anglican Parishes of the Central Interior until 2016), with episcopal oversight by a suffragan bishop to the Metropolitan (of BC). (Its now-unofficial cathedral of St Paul in Kamloops continues to be deemed a cathedral, its rector being styled &quot;Very Reverend&quot; as a dean). The Diocese of Qu&#x27;Appelle and the General Synod of the ACC were in considerable danger of the same fate until settlement of the claims was reached on a national basis. Michael Peers (Primate, 1986–2004) took a major role on behalf of the ACC with respect to reaching a settlement with the federal Crown, which was the defendant of the first instance and which counter-claimed against the ACC and Roman Catholic religious orders. He offered the ACC&#x27;s apology to aboriginal people and delayed his retirement until 2004 when his successor could come to the primacy with the issue also retired.

In January 2007 the ACC announced the appointment of Mark MacDonald, an aboriginal American and Bishop of Alaska in the Episcopal Church (United States), as the National Indigenous Bishop with pastoral oversight over all indigenous members of the Anglican Church of Canada. MacDonald resigned in 2022 after admitting to sexual misconduct.

In 2017 Melanie Delva was appointed as the Reconciliation Animator for the Anglican Church of Canada, with a focus on responding the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada&#x27;s Calls to Action.

In 2022 the Anglican Council of Indigenous People announced the appointment of Chris A. Harper, the Diocesan Bishop of Saskatoon, as the second National Indigenous Anglican Archbishop for the Anglican Church of Canada.

==Cathedrals and notable parishes==

===Cathedrals===
The oldest Anglican cathedral in Canada and North America is St. Paul&#x27;s Church in Halifax which was made Canada&#x27;s first cathedral when Charles Inglis became the first bishop in 1787. St Paul&#x27;s remained a cathedral for 78 years until 1864 when it was replaced by St Luke&#x27;s pro-cathedral.

The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Quebec City is the oldest Anglican cathedral in Canada that continues in that capacity, having been &quot;built from 1800 to 1804; it was constructed according to drawings done by Captain William Hall and Major William Robe, officers of the military engineering corps of the British Army, stationed in Quebec City.&quot;
Most Anglican cathedrals in Canada are modest parish churches, and it is only the cathedrals of Toronto, (St. James Cathedral), Montreal, Kingston, Halifax, St. John&#x27;s, and Victoria which have significant dimensions or imposing designs, though even they are modest by European or even Australian standards. Diocesan services are often held in Roman Catholic or United churches because of the limited seating in most Anglican cathedrals.

The Cathedral Church of All Saints in Halifax, Canada&#x27;s largest Anglican Cathedral, was officially opened in September 1910 in conjunction with the national celebration of the Bicentenary of the Anglican Church in Canada being held in that city. Notable and distinguished Anglican and Episcopal clergy from all over the world attended this cathedral opening as well as many other local events that took place over the 10-day celebration. In the spring of 1912, burial services for some victims of the Titanic were held at All Saints Cathedral.

Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa, while not having any official national status either secularly or ecclesially like that of Canterbury Cathedral in England and the Washington National Cathedral in the United States, is the usual venue for state occasions requiring an ecclesiastical setting, such as state funerals for non-Roman Catholics. Christ&#x27;s Church Cathedral, Hamilton is the oldest cathedral of Upper Canada, its present building having originally been constructed in 1842, though its curious and evolutionary construction history has left none of the original fabric extant. Christ Church Cathedral, Montreal is notable for having a shopping mall (Promenades Cathédrale) and Metro station (McGill) underneath it.

===Notable parishes===
The Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Toronto was the home parish of the organist and composer Healey Willan, who composed much of his liturgical music for its choirs. It is the inspiration for the parish of St Aiden in Robertson Davies&#x27;s novel &quot;The Cunning Man&quot;. The hymn tune &quot;Bellwoods&quot; by James Hopkirk, sung to the hymn &quot;O day of God draw nigh&quot;, by the Canadian biblical scholar R. B. Y. Scott, was named for St. Matthias Bellwoods, in Toronto, where Hopkirk was organist. St John&#x27;s, Elora, is a concert venue of the Elora Music Festival; its choir, also known as the Elora Festival Singers, is the professional core of the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir and its CDs are available around the world.

St. Thomas&#x27;s, Huron Street, another notable parish church in Toronto, was at one time the parish church of the English accompanist Gerald Moore, serving there as an assistant organist, but is equally notable for being one of the most liturgically traditional Anglo-Catholic parishes in North America, earning recognition as a prominent &quot;destination parish&quot; in the Greater Toronto Area, as well as for its music program. St Anne&#x27;s, Toronto is a notable tourist attraction, being &quot;a scale model of Saint Sophia in Istanbul that was decorated in the 1920s by members of the Group of Seven and associates.&quot;

His Majesty&#x27;s Royal Chapel of the Mohawks in Brantford, Ontario, and Christ Church, His Majesty&#x27;s Chapel Royal of the Mohawks, near Deseronto, Ontario, are two of only three Chapels Royal in Canada, the third being the interdenominational St Catharine&#x27;s Chapel in Massey College, Toronto. Christ Church was granted royal status by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004, and St Catharine&#x27;s in 2017. St Bartholomew&#x27;s, Ottawa, located near to Rideau Hall and also known as the Guards Chapel has been the place of worship for Governors General of the Canadas and then Canada since 1866, before the wider confederation of the British North American colonies.

In April 2007 St. George&#x27;s Church (Georgetown, Ontario) became the first church in Canada to join the Messy Church initiative which places a premium on community, creativity, hospitality and celebration. Messy Church had been born in the Church of England &quot;Fresh Expressions&quot; movement and was just beginning to spread. It is a very untraditional and informal gathering with a Christian message communicated through crafts, activities, songs, prayers, and always ends with a meal.

Messy Church at St. George&#x27;s made a connection with young families beyond the sacrament of baptism and built a community around it. St. George&#x27;s continues to offer &quot;Messy Church&quot; services on the second Wednesday of each month at 5:00 p.m. (not during summer).

<text>Walker is a horizontally scrolling shooter video game developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis for the Amiga in February 1993. The player controls a bipedal mech and is tasked with killing advancing enemies in stages set in multiple time periods. Development of the game began after the release of &quot;Blood Money&quot;, but was scrapped in 1990 because the game was not coming together. By the end of the year, development had recommenced with a redesign, inspired by sprites originally intended for &quot;Blood Money&quot;. Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy designed the game, and Raymond Usher wrote its soundtrack. The game was released to positive reviews with praise directed at the game&#x27;s graphics and sound, but reviewers were critical towards the repetitiveness of the gameplay. &quot;Amiga Power&quot; ranked it among their top 100 Amiga games of 1993.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Walker&quot; is a horizontal side-scrolling shooter that utilises 2D computer graphics. The player controls a bipedal mech to advance through the game&#x27;s four stages, each consisting of two levels: 1944 Berlin, 2019 Los Angeles, contemporary Middle East, and 2420 Earth during &quot;The Great War&quot;. Throughout the levels, the player uses the mech&#x27;s machine guns to defeat waves of enemy infantry, tanks, and airships; the player advances to the next level upon killing all enemies. When the mech&#x27;s guns are fired, the temperature indicator rises; when overheated, the guns must cool down over a short time before further use. The player has the ability to lock-on to enemies with their missiles. The mech&#x27;s shield acts as the player&#x27;s health and is depleted when enemies attack the mech. When the mech is destroyed, the player loses a life; when all three lives are lost, the game ends. At the end of each level, the player must defeat a boss. Unlike most side-scrolling games, &quot;Walker&quot; is controlled from right to left. The game features two difficulty levels: easy and arcade. Only the first two stages are playable in easy mode.

== Development ==
DMA Design founder David Jones began developing &quot;Walker&quot; following the release of &quot;Blood Money&quot; in 1989. The inspiration for the game&#x27;s mech originated in a sprite from &quot;Lemmings&quot; (1991) originally designed for &quot;Blood Money&quot;. The graphics and animation for &quot;Walker&quot; were designed by Scott Johnston, who later worked on &quot;Hired Guns&quot; (1993). Johnston, a freelancer at the time, wrote a small program to correctly render the walker&#x27;s head in position, which could then be altered in Deluxe Paint. In early 1990, Jones scrapped &quot;Walker&quot; because the design was not coming together, and began development on a new game called &quot;Gore!&quot;; this was soon scrapped. Following the completion of the Commodore 64 and TurboGrafx-16 ports of &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot;, Jones hired Ian Dunlop and Neill Glancy to continue working on &quot;Walker&quot;; Glancy redesigned the game. Raymond Usher wrote the game&#x27;s soundtrack.

Dunlop had been seeking contract work when he was hired by Jones. Glancy was working at a computer shop in Scotland when he met Dunlop, who was working on &quot;Walker&quot; at the time. &quot;I had been working on pixel art games and projects for some years so offered to create an entire set of level graphics for the game&quot;, Glancy said. &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) and &quot;Akira&quot; (1988) influenced Glancy&#x27;s design work, which he described as &quot;the most complex pixel graphics [he] had ever made&quot;, due to the addition of motion blur and dynamic lighting. While Jones was impressed by Glancy&#x27;s designs, he selected alternative designs by the art department at DMA Design because Glancy was not an employee.

Dunlop found that the large scale of the game necessitated small enemies, which were partly inspired by the characters of &quot;Lemmings&quot;. The game&#x27;s control scheme consisted of a mouse controlling the guns and a keyboard or joystick controlling the mech&#x27;s movements. Dunlop explained that this allowed the player to maintain freedom of the weapons while simultaneously moving the mech and felt that it &quot;gave the gameplay a bit more depth and interest&quot;. In regards to the game&#x27;s side-scrolling, the team took inspiration from their 1988 game &quot;Menace&quot;. When played on advanced Amiga models, &quot;Walker&quot; included a speech between the mech and its headquarters that had been recorded by Dunlop and Glancy over walkie-talkie.

The game&#x27;s original concept included an underground base that connected all of the levels, but this element was scrapped by publisher Psygnosis due to financial constraints. Several additional levels were also cut from the game due to time restrictions, including one inspired by &quot;Prince of Persia&quot; (1989). Following &quot;Walker&quot;″s launch in February 1993, Dunlop began working on a port for the Mega Drive, which was cancelled shortly thereafter. Glancy was also recruited to work on a sequel, &quot;Walker 2&quot;, which would have overhauled the visual quality of the first game and include a customisable mech. Planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, it was eventually cancelled.

== Reception ==
&quot;Walker&quot; received positive reviews from critics upon release. Reviewers particularly directed praise at the game&#x27;s graphics and sound design, though the gameplay was met with mixed reactions. James Price of &quot;Amiga Force&quot; named it &quot;one of the most satisfying shoot-&#x27;em-ups&quot;, while &quot;Amiga Computing&quot;″s Paul Roundell wrote that the developers &quot;managed to combine the best elements of several games&quot;. The game received the &quot;Amiga Action Accolade&quot; from &quot;Amiga Action&quot; and was ranked 58th in &quot;Amiga Power&quot;″s top 100 games of 1993.

Critics praised the game&#x27;s graphical qualities. &quot;Amiga Computing&quot;″s Roundell described the mech animation as &quot;a pleasure to watch&quot;, and &quot;Amiga Force&quot;″s Price called it &quot;flawlessly animated&quot;. Mark Winstanley of &quot;Amiga Power&quot; praised the enemy animation, writing that he had &quot;never seen ... soldiers die so needlessly and gratuitously&quot;. Andy Nuttall of &quot;Amiga Format&quot; applauded the game&#x27;s subtle use of scrolling backgrounds. &quot;CU Amiga&quot;″s Dan Slingsby found that the design of the military hardware was particularly pleasing. While David Upchurch of &quot;The One Amiga&quot; admired the mech&#x27;s animation, he found that it &quot;looks more like a mechanical chicken than a vicious killing machine&quot;.

The game&#x27;s use of sound also garnered praise. Alan Bunker of &quot;Amiga Action&quot; wrote that the developers &quot;realised the importance of sound and perfected it&quot;. &quot;CU Amiga&quot;″s Slingsby found that the game&#x27;s sound effects complemented the action of the gameplay. &quot;Amiga Power&quot;″s Winstanley praised each element of the sound design, particularly lauding the subtle inclusions, such as music from enemy radios. Nuttall of &quot;Amiga Format&quot; felt that the developers dedicated &quot;a lot of attention&quot; to the game&#x27;s sound design.

Reviewers were satisfied with the gameplay, though most were critical of the lack of variation. Roundell of &quot;Amiga Computing&quot; noted that the variety and speed of enemies ensures engaging gameplay. &quot;The One Amiga&quot;″s Upchurch wrote that the game is &quot;not ... for the faint-hearted&quot;. Price of &quot;Amiga Force&quot; described the controls as &quot;rather innovative&quot;, though criticised the longevity of gameplay due to lack of variation. &quot;Amiga Format&quot;″s Nuttall echoed similar remarks, noting the repetitiveness of gameplay. In a 2014 review, Graeme Virtue of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; felt that the right-to-left movement made the game memorable.

<doc id="1177754" wikidata="Q862378" url="?curid=1177754" title="Bill Press">
<text>William H. Press (born April 8, 1940) is an American talk radio host, podcaster, liberal pundit and author. He was chairman of the California Democratic Party from 1993 to 1996, and is a senior political contributor on CNN. He hosts &quot;The Bill Press Pod&quot; podcast, and his weekly column is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency.

==Education==
Born in Wilmington, Delaware, and raised in Delaware City, Delaware, Press was educated at Salesianum School, a private Roman Catholic secondary school in Wilmington, in 1958, followed by Niagara University from which he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, and the University of Fribourg in which he gained a Bachelor of Sacred Theology degree.

==Life and career==

Press is a longtime resident of Inverness, California, having moved there in 1970. He resides in Washington, D.C.

Press started his broadcasting career in Los Angeles for TV stations KABC-TV and KCOP-TV. He has worked as a political commentator for CNN and MSNBC. He is best known for co-hosting CNN&#x27;s &quot;Spin Room&quot; opposite Tucker Carlson, and &quot;Crossfire&quot; and MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Buchanan and Press&quot;.

Since May 2005, Press has been a contributing blogger at &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. He also contributes blogs to &quot;The Hill&quot;. In January 2012, Press filled in for Keith Olbermann on Current TV&#x27;s coverage of the 2012 Florida Republican primary.

===In politics===
Press was the chairman of the California Democratic Party from 1993 to 1996.

He previously served in different appointed positions such as a chief of staff to Republican California state senator Peter Behr (1971–73), and as director of the California Office of Planning and Research under Democratic governor Jerry Brown (1975–79).

Press was an early backer of Bernie Sanders for president in 2016, hosting Sanders and his advisors for strategy sessions at his home before the campaign began.

===Radio talk show===
Since September 2005, Press has been hosting a daily liberal talk radio program, &quot;The Bill Press Show&quot;. It is heard on satellite radio, streamed live from the show&#x27;s website, and available from the show&#x27;s YouTube channel.

It was formerly broadcast on terrestrial radio affiliates in the United States live from 6-9 AM ET. Originally syndicated by Jones Radio, the radio show was syndicated by Dial Global until 2017. On March 5, 2012, the show was announced to be simulcast on Current TV alongside &quot;The Stephanie Miller Show&quot; as part of morning programming. As a result of Current TV becoming &quot;Al Jazeera America&quot;, &quot;The Bill Press Show&quot; moved to Free Speech TV, where it stayed until its move to The Young Turks Network in 2016. As part of the move to the Turks, terrestrial syndication of the program was dropped in January 2017 (except for WCPT-AM Chicago).

===Religion===
Press was steeped in Catholicism from an early age. He was an altar boy and took vows of obedience, poverty and chastity. He describes his young self as a &quot;soldier in God&#x27;s army&quot;.

<doc id="1177768" wikidata="Q17104778" url="?curid=1177768" title="Zech's logarithm">
<text>Zech logarithms are used to implement addition in finite fields when elements are represented as powers of a generator formula_1.

Zech logarithms are named after Julius Zech, and are also called Jacobi logarithms, after Carl G. J. Jacobi who used them for number theoretic investigations.

==Definition==
Given a primitive element formula_1 of a finite field, the Zech logarithm relative to the base formula_1 is defined by the equation
:formula_4
which is often rewritten as
:formula_5
The choice of base formula_1 is usually dropped from the notation when it is clear from the context.

To be more precise, formula_7 is a function on the integers modulo the multiplicative order of formula_1, and takes values in the same set. In order to describe every element, it is convenient to formally add a new symbol formula_9, along with the definitions
:formula_10
:formula_11 
:formula_12
:formula_13
where formula_14 is an integer satisfying formula_15, that is formula_16 for a field of characteristic 2, and formula_17 for a field of odd characteristic with formula_18 elements.

Using the Zech logarithm, finite field arithmetic can be done in the exponential representation:
:formula_19
:formula_20
:formula_21
:formula_22
:formula_23
:formula_24
These formulas remain true with our conventions with the symbol formula_9, with the caveat that subtraction of formula_9 is undefined. In particular, the addition and subtraction formulas need to treat formula_27 as a special case.

This can be extended to arithmetic of the projective line by introducing another symbol formula_28 satisfying formula_29 and other rules as appropriate.

For fields of characteristic 2,
:formula_30.

==Uses==
For sufficiently small finite fields, a table of Zech logarithms allows an especially efficient implementation of all finite field arithmetic in terms of a small number of integer addition/subtractions and table look-ups.

The utility of this method diminishes for large fields where one cannot efficiently store the table. This method is also inefficient when doing very few operations in the finite field, because one spends more time computing the table than one does in actual calculation.

==Examples==

Let be a root of the primitive polynomial . The traditional representation of elements of this field is as polynomials in α of degree 2 or less.

A table of Zech logarithms for this field are , , , , , , , and . The multiplicative order of &quot;α&quot; is 7, so the exponential representation works with integers modulo 7.

Since &quot;α&quot; is a root of then that means , or if we recall that since all coefficients are in GF(2), subtraction is the same as addition, we obtain .

The conversion from exponential to polynomial representations is given by
:formula_31 (as shown above)
:formula_32
:formula_33
:formula_34

Using Zech logarithms to compute &quot;α&quot;&amp;hairsp;6 + &quot;α&quot;&amp;hairsp;3:
:formula_35
or, more efficiently,
:formula_36
and verifying it in the polynomial representation:
:formula_37

<doc id="1177772" wikidata="Q645598" url="?curid=1177772" title="Alfredo Ferrari">
<text>Alfredo Ferrari (nicknamed Alfredino or Dino; 19 January 1932 – 30 June 1956) was an Italian automotive engineer and the first son of automaker Enzo Ferrari. He was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and died aged 24. After his death, Ferrari named the car fitted with the engine that Alfredo was working on at the time of his death &quot;Dino&quot; in his honour.

==Early life==

Born to Enzo Ferrari and his wife Laura Dominica Garello, on 19 January 1932, Alfredo was named after his paternal grandfather and uncle.

Enzo, who at the time was a racing driver for Alfa Romeo, had vowed to stop racing cars if he had a son. He kept his promise, and retired from driving in 1932, concentrating on racing team management with the newly-formed Scuderia Ferrari.

From an early age, Enzo groomed Alfredino, &quot;little Alfredo&quot;, to be his successor. Alfredo studied economics in Bologna before moving to mechanical engineering in Switzerland.

==Career at Ferrari==

In his short career at Ferrari, Alfredo was widely credited for the 750 Monza racing car; and, to a limited extent, a 1.5-litre V6, the Ferrari Dino engine, that would later see action in Ferrari&#x27;s early Formula Two racers. Alfredo suggested to his father the development of a 1.5-litre DOHC V6 engine for F2 at the end of 1955. Two years later in 1957, to honour his son, Enzo named the Dino series of racing sports cars using this V6 engine after him. Road cars under the same marque soon followed.

Gino Rancati, a friend of Dino&#x27;s father, Enzo Ferrari, noted: &quot;Dino, though he suffered because of his health, had always played an active part in the Ferrari company. He was interested in everything, but it was perhaps engines that interested him the most.&quot;

==Death==
During his time at Ferrari, Alfredo started experiencing health problems. His physical movements gradually became stiff, and he was often unable to maintain his balance. At his return to Modena, he was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In the final days of his life, while hospitalized, he discussed technical details of the 1.5-litre V6 with fellow engineer Vittorio Jano and his father, Enzo Ferrari; Enzo remarked on Dino&#x27;s &quot;intensity, intelligence, and attentiveness&quot;. Alfredo would never see the engine; he died in Modena on 30 June 1956, aged 24.

Enzo Ferrari later said of caring for Dino in the final months leading up to his death:

The death of Alfredo took a toll on his parents&#x27; marriage. His mother, Laura Dominica Garello, never got over the loss of her only son, and her behaviour became increasingly erratic and unstable.

Piero Ferrari, Dino&#x27;s younger half-brother who was born out-of-wedlock to Enzo Ferrari and mistress Lina Lardi on 22 May 1945, and who became Enzo&#x27;s heir after Dino&#x27;s death, has stated: &quot;I never knew Dino, but I have never felt I was a victim of his memory, or of the pain that my father, Enzo, had always felt because of his death. And I would not be sincere if I did not say that when I was recognized [in 1978, after Laura&#x27;s death], I experienced a great deal of emotion.&quot;

Gino Rancati, a long-time friend of Dino&#x27;s and Piero&#x27;s father, Enzo Ferrari, said: &quot;Piero is now a man, with a family of his own, but his father [Enzo]&#x27;s obsession with Dino&#x27;s memory must have left a mark on him.&quot;

==Legacy==
Dino Ferrari is probably best-known posthumously for designing the Ferrari Dino engine, a series of V6s and V8s that were produced by Ferrari from the late 1950s into the early 2000s; and the Dino, a marque best known for mid-engined, rear-drive sports cars produced by Ferrari from 1957 to 1976.

The marque came into existence in late 1956, with a front-engined Formula Two racer powered by a brand new Ferrari Dino V6 engine. The name &quot;Dino&quot; was also used for some models with engines smaller than 12 cylinders, it was an attempt by the company to offer a relatively low-cost sports car. The Ferrari name remained reserved for its premium V12 and flat-12 models until 1976, when &quot;Dino&quot; was retired in favor of full Ferrari branding.

Alongside engineer Vittorio Jano, Dino persuaded his father, Enzo Ferrari, to produce a line of racing cars in the 1950s with V6 and V8 engines. The script that adorns the badge and cylinder head covers was based on Dino&#x27;s own signature.

In 1962, Enzo Ferrari launched the Premio Giornalistico Dino Ferrari (the Dino Ferrari Prize for Journalism) in memory of his son, originally with a prize of 500,000 lira. The prize money was later increased to 1 million lira, in addition to a small bronze statuette of the Ferrari emblem, the Prancing Horse. Writers Gino Rancati, Giovanni Arpino, and Alberto Bevilacqua, among others, have been recipients of this annual award.

The Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in Imola, Italy was originally named the &quot;Autodromo Dino Ferrari&quot; in Alfredo&#x27;s honour, with his father&#x27;s name added after Enzo&#x27;s death in 1988. The 1979 Dino Ferrari Grand Prix was held there on 16 September 1979.

Dino&#x27;s half-brother, Piero, also actively supports Centro Dino Ferrari, a research center for neurodegenerative and muscular diseases at the University of Milan, located in the Clinical Neurology Institute at the University Polyclinic of Milan. The center was named after Dino, and co-founded by their father, Enzo Ferrari, with Prof. Guglielmo Scarlato (1931–2002) in 1978.

He was portrayed by Benedetto Benedettini in &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2023) which centred on his father&#x27;s grief and the 1957 Mille Miglia. He was portrayed by Matthew Bose in &quot;Ferrari&quot; (2003).

<text>Rejected is an animated surrealist short comedy film directed by Don Hertzfeldt that was released in 2000. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film the following year at the 73rd Academy Awards, and received 27 awards from film festivals around the world.

==Story==

The film takes place over four segments and is initially introduced as a collection of unaired promo interstitials for the fictional &quot;Family Learning Channel.&quot; The &quot;advertisements&quot; are surreal, feature non-human characters, are often gruesome, and have nothing to do with the product. The second section is introduced as a collection of rejected advertisements for the fictional &quot;Johnson &amp; Mills Corporation&quot; and features the same surreal dark and absurd humour as the earlier section. The third section is introduced with an explanation that the animator had begun further rejecting the norms of animation and a single shot is then shown which was apparently animated with Hertzfeld&#x27;s left hand only. In this short, the audio is garbled and the characters speak only complete nonsense.

The fourth and final segment is introduced with a title card explaining that the &quot;rejected&quot; cartoons began falling apart. Various characters and elements from the earlier shorts then appear in disjointed succession as their world literally falls apart: clouds and stars fall from the sky, killing characters; the paper the cartoons are drawn on crumples and destroys the animations; characters attempt to break out of the screen or are sucked into holes in the page. A close-up of a distorted, screaming character ends the short which abruptly cuts to end credits scored with dramatic classical music.

==Production==
Hertzfeldt&#x27;s first film after graduating from college, &quot;Rejected&quot; was photographed on a 35mm rostrum camera he purchased in 1999.

&quot;Rejected&quot; features simple hand-drawn artwork, featuring mostly black pen animation on a white background with occasional use of color. As the film progresses and the fictionalized animator begins to fall apart, the drawings become more crude and the animation becomes more erratic. As the film concludes, the paper the animation is drawn on begins to crumple and tear, and the characters are seen struggling to evade the destruction.

Besides the iconic &quot;Allegro ma non-troppo&quot; from Beethoven&#x27;s 9th that plays in the text introductions to each segment, a particular segment with the &quot;Fluffy Guys&quot; uses background music from the Swedish Christmas song &quot;Nu är det jul igen&quot;.

===Inspiration===

Although the film is fictional and Hertzfeldt has never done any advertising work, he did receive many offers to do television commercials after &quot;Billy&#x27;s Balloon&quot; received international attention and acclaim. In appearances, he would often tell the humorous story of how he was tempted to produce the worst possible cartoons he could come up with for the companies, run off with their money, and see if they would actually make it to air. Eventually, this became the germ for &quot;Rejected&quot;&#x27;s theme of a collection of cartoons so bad they were rejected by advertising agencies, leading to their creator&#x27;s breakdown.

Hertzfeldt has never accepted &quot;real&quot; advertising work and has stated numerous times on his website and in public appearances that he never will, as he feels advertisements are &quot;lies&quot; and he does not want to lie to his audience.

==Release==
===Exhibition history===
&quot;Rejected&quot; world-premiered at the San Diego Comic Convention in 2000. Between hundreds of film festival appearances, &quot;Rejected&quot; also toured North American theaters in 2000, 2001, and 2002 with Spike and Mike&#x27;s Festival of Animation; in 2001 and 2002 again with a retrospective touring program of Hertzfeldt&#x27;s and animator Bill Plympton&#x27;s films called &quot;The Don and Bill Show&quot;; and returned to theaters once again in 2003 and 2004 with Hertzfeldt&#x27;s own the Animation Show tour.

Released nationwide in theaters through the Spike and Mike&#x27;s Festival of Animation in 2000, the short won 27 film festival awards and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Animated Short Film the following year.

In the early 2000s, pirated copies of &quot;Rejected&quot; turned the film into a viral sensation online, where it has been credited with shaping the surreal sense of humor of the early Internet.

In 2003, two of the &quot;Fluffy Guy&quot; characters reappeared in three Hertzfeldt cartoons created to introduce and book-end the first year of the Animation Show: &quot;Welcome to the Show&quot;, &quot;Intermission in the Third Dimension&quot;, and &quot;the End of the Show&quot;.

&quot;Rejected&quot; was scheduled to air on Adult Swim in 2001 but was delayed for unknown reasons—it was rescheduled to air on November 3, 2002 &quot;uncut and commercial free&quot;, and was heavily promoted on the network that week. However, the short was pulled from the schedule at the last minute, for unknown reasons. Rumors about the reasons behind this highly unusual action have included: the film&#x27;s brief use of the phrase &quot;Sweet Jesus&quot; (&quot;Jesus&quot; being a word allegedly not allowed on a Turner Network back then), and an anonymous high-ranking network executive simply not finding the short to be funny. &quot;Rejected&quot; has since aired without incident on the Cartoon Network in other countries as well as on other international television networks, but has to date never been broadcast on American television. However, a brief clip from the film has since aired on the Adult Swim anthology series &quot;Off the Air&quot;, 14 years later, in the episode &quot;Holes&quot;. The scene mentioned in the episode is the scene with the &quot;fluffy guys&quot; in which one announces that his &quot;anus is bleeding.&quot;

In 2020, for the film&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, Hertzfeldt appeared at the Austin Film Society for a rare 35mm screening and discussed the making of the cartoon and its impact.

===DVD and Blu-ray===
In 2001 Bitter Films released a limited edition DVD &quot;single&quot; of the short film. The DVD &quot;single&quot; featured a deleted scene as well as an audio commentary, and is now out of print.

In 2006, &quot;Rejected&quot; was remastered and restored for inclusion on the DVD, &quot;Bitter Films Volume 1&quot;, a compilation of Don Hertzfeldt&#x27;s short films from 1995–2005. Special features on this DVD relating to &quot;Rejected&quot; included a new text commentary by Hertzfeldt (via closed-caption boxes), footage from the abandoned cartoon &quot;The Spanky the Bear Show&quot; that later evolved into a central scene in the film, original pencil tests, the 2001 audio commentary, and dozens of pages devoted to Hertzfeldt&#x27;s original sketches, storyboards, notes, and deleted ideas from the film.

In 2015, the cartoon was remastered again, this time in high definition, for inclusion on the Blu-ray of &quot;It&#x27;s Such a Beautiful Day&quot;.

A 35-second deleted scene from &quot;Rejected&quot; was only released on the 2001 DVD &quot;single&quot;. In it, a father inquires into his son&#x27;s desire to drink goat&#x27;s blood. The scene appears to fit in with the &quot;Johnson &amp; Mills&quot; portion of the original film and is revealed to be an advertisement for cotton swabs at the end.

==Legacy==

&quot;Rejected&quot; is now considered a cult classic and one of the most influential animated films ever made.

In the early 2000s, pirated copies of &quot;Rejected&quot; turned the film into a viral video, where it has been credited with shaping the surreal sense of humor of the early Internet. In 2018 &quot;New York&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;If there is a single piece of media that inspired what we nebulously refer to as &quot;Internet humor,&quot; it&#x27;s probably &quot;Rejected&quot;&quot;, additionally citing it as &quot;the cartoon that invented Internet culture.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Rejected&quot; was the only short film named as one of the &quot;Films of the Decade&quot; by &quot;Salon&quot;. In 2010, it was noted as one of the five &quot;most innovative animated films of the past ten years&quot; by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;. &quot;Indiewire&quot; film critic Eric Kohn named &quot;Rejected&quot; one of the &quot;10 best films of the 21st century&quot; on his list for the BBC Culture poll in 2016.

==In popular culture==
* A fan of the film, quoting, &quot;I am the Queen of France!&quot; appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.
* The alternate dimension scenes from the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; episode &quot;Broodwich&quot; were an acknowledged homage to Don Hertzfeldt. Hertzfeldt&#x27;s films, and &quot;Rejected&quot; in particular, were a strong early influence on Adult Swim writers and &quot;Aqua Teen&quot; creators Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis.
* A 2013 episode of the Fine Brothers&#x27; web series &quot;YouTubers React&quot; featured &quot;Rejected&quot;.
* The introduction section of the 2006 video game &quot;Prey&quot; features a crude scrawling in the room&#x27;s bathroom that is a direct reference to the first sketch; &quot;My spoon is too big.&quot;
* Musician Neil Cicierega&#x27;s album &quot;Hip to the Javabean&quot; features a song titled &quot;Consumer Whore&quot;, which is named after a line from the short film. The response line, &quot;And how!&quot; crosses over into the next track, &quot;Between You and Me&quot;.
* In the first episode of the 26th season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Clown in the Dumps,&quot; the opening couch gag was created by Don Hertzfeldt. &quot;Rejected&quot; established the roots of a dystopia by consumerism style of satire through the guise of rejected advertisements; this shortcuts directly to the point. It depicts Homer using a time-traveling remote control to regress to his original 1987 character model, then accidentally going into a distant future incarnation of the show called The Sampsans where he and his family have evolved into grotesque, mindless, catchphrase-spouting mutants. Carey Bodenheimer of CNN wrote: &quot;[&quot;The Simpsons&quot;] kicked off season 26 with a staggering, Don Hertzfeldt-directed intro sequence.&quot;
* The infamous &quot;My anus is bleeding&quot; scene was featured in the &quot;Off the Air&quot; episode &quot;Holes&quot;.

<doc id="1177781" wikidata="Q4491860" url="?curid=1177781" title="Terrell rotation">
<text>Terrell rotation or the Terrell effect is the visual distortion that a passing object would appear to undergo, according to the special theory of relativity, if it were travelling at a significant fraction of the speed of light. This behaviour was described independently by both Roger Penrose and James Edward Terrell. Penrose&#x27;s article was submitted 29 July 1958 and published in January 1959. Terrell&#x27;s article was submitted 22 June 1959 and published 15 November 1959. The general phenomenon was noted already in 1924 by Austrian physicist Anton Lampa.

This phenomenon was popularized by Victor Weisskopf in a &quot;Physics Today&quot; article.

Due to an early dispute about priority and correct attribution, the effect is also sometimes referred to as the Penrose–Terrell effect, the Terrell–Penrose effect or the Lampa–Terrell–Penrose effect, but not the &quot;Lampa effect&quot;.

==Further detail==
By symmetry, it is equivalent to the visual appearance of the object at rest as seen by a moving observer. Since the Lorentz transform does not depend on the acceleration, the visual appearance of the object depends only on the instantaneous velocity, and not the acceleration of the observer.
Terrell&#x27;s and Penrose&#x27;s papers pointed out that although special relativity appeared to describe an &quot;observed contraction&quot; in moving objects, these interpreted &quot;observations&quot; were not to be confused with the theory&#x27;s literal predictions for the visible appearance of a moving object. Thanks to the differential timelag effects in signals reaching the observer from the object&#x27;s different parts, a &quot;receding&quot; object would appear contracted, an &quot;approaching&quot; object would appear &quot;elongated&quot; (even under special relativity) and the geometry of a &quot;passing&quot; object would appear skewed, as if rotated. By R. Penrose: &quot;the light from the trailing part reaches the observer from behind the sphere, which it can do since the sphere is continuously moving out of its way&quot;.
For images of passing objects, the apparent contraction of distances between points on the object&#x27;s transverse surface could then be interpreted as being due to an apparent change in viewing angle, and the image of the object could be interpreted as appearing instead to be &quot;rotated&quot;. A previously popular description of special relativity&#x27;s predictions, in which an observer &quot;sees&quot; a passing object to be contracted (for instance, from a sphere to a flattened ellipsoid), was wrong. A sphere maintains its circular outline since, as the sphere moves, light from further points of the Lorentz-contracted ellipsoid takes longer to reach the eye.

Terrell&#x27;s and Penrose&#x27;s papers prompted a number of follow-up papers, mostly in the &quot;American Journal of Physics&quot;, exploring the consequences of this correction. These papers pointed out that some existing discussions of special relativity were flawed and &quot;explained&quot; effects that the theory did not actually predict – while these papers did not change the &quot;actual&quot; mathematical structure of special relativity in any way, they did correct a misconception regarding the theory&#x27;s predictions.

A representation of the Terrell effect can be seen in the physics simulator &quot;A Slower Speed of Light,&quot; published by MIT.

<doc id="1177806" wikidata="Q4348020" url="?curid=1177806" title="1960 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1960 United States Senate elections coincided with the election of John F. Kennedy as president on November 8, 1960. The 33 seats of Class 2 were contested in regular elections. A special election was also held on June 28, 1960, for a mid-term vacancy in North Dakota where Democrats flipped a seat to expand their majority to 66–34. As Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson was elected Vice President, Mike Mansfield became the new majority leader.

The Republicans gained two seats at the expense of the Democrats. However, Republican Senator-elect Edwin Keith Thomson of Wyoming died December 9, 1960, and was replaced by appointee Democratic John J. Hickey at the beginning of the Congress, reducing Republican gains to one seat. However, this was canceled out by a 1961 special election where Republican John Tower flipped Johnson&#x27;s Senate seat. The Democrats nonetheless retained a commanding lead in the Senate with 64 seats to 36.

== Results summary ==

== Gains, losses, and holds ==
===Retirements===
Two Republicans and four Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election.

===Defeats===
One Democrat sought re-election but lost in the general election.

===Post-election changes===
Four Republicans died and two Democrats resigned, and were all replaced by appointees. One Republican senator-elect died December 9, 1960 before the next Congress began, and was replaced by a Democratic appointee. In Texas, a 1961 special election was held prior to the 1962 United States Senate elections, where John Tower won the special election to succeed Democratic appointee William A. Blakley, who lost election to finish the term.

All of the elections involved the Class 2 seats.

== Closest races ==
Eleven races had a margin of victory under 10%:

Rhode Island was the tipping point state with a margin of 37.8%.

== Alabama ==

Incumbent John J. Sparkman won re-election, having served since 1946. He faced nominal opposition from Republican Julian E. Elgin in the then-deeply Democratic state of Alabama. Sparkman served from 1946 to 1979 in the Senate before retiring and being succeeded by Howell Heflin. 


== Alaska ==
Incumbent Democrat Bob Bartlett was easily re-elected to his second (his first full) term in the U.S. Senate over Republican dentist Lee McKinley after originally being elected in 1958 upon Alaska&#x27;s anticipated admission as a state into the United States. Bartlett had previously served as the last delegate from Alaska to Congress. 


== Arkansas ==
Incumbent senator John L. McClellan was re-elected to a fourth term with nominal opposition from write-in independent candidate Marvin Fuchs, who received just 449 of 377,485 votes. 




== Colorado ==
Incumbent Gordon Allott was re-elected to a second term in office, defeating lieutenant governor Robert Knous by just under eight percentage points. He would wind up winning re-election in 1966 before retiring in 1973, replaced by Democrat Floyd Haskell.



== Delaware ==
J. Allen Frear ran for re-election to a third term, but he was defeated by Republican governor J. Caleb Boggs by a narrow 1% margin. Boggs would be re-elected in 1966, but he would lose re-election to a third term in 1972 to future U.S. President Joe Biden.



== Georgia ==
Incumbent Richard B. Russell Jr. was re-elected to a sixth term in office, running unopposed in the tantamount Democratic primary and facing nominal opposition in the deeply-Democratic Georgia.



== Idaho ==

Henry Dworshak ran for re-election to a third term, defeating R.F. McLaughlin by just under five percentage points. 



== Illinois ==
Incumbent Paul H. Douglas successfully ran for re-election to a third term, defeating Republican Samuel Witwer.



== Iowa ==
Incumbent Republican Thomas Martin decided to retire, leaving this seat open. Republican Jack Miller won the open seat, defeating Democrat Herschel C. Loveless and riding the coattails of Richard Nixon&#x27;s victory in the state.



== Kansas ==




== Kentucky ==
Incumbent John Sherman Cooper ran for re-election, defeating Keen Johnson by nearly 20%. This was the first time Cooper had won an election to a full Senate term, though he had previously served two partial terms. 



== Louisiana ==




== Maine ==
Incumbent Republican Margaret Chase Smith, the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress, was overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term, defeating Lucia Cormier. This was the first election in which a woman was nominated by both major parties for the office of U.S. Senate, meaning a woman was going to be elected regardless of who won.


== Massachusetts ==
Republican incumbent Leverett Saltonstall was re-elected to another term after being elected in 1944 in a special election. He defeated Democrat Thomas O&#x27;Connor Jr. 




== Michigan ==
Democrat Patrick V. McNamara was narrowly re-elected against Republican Alvin Bentley, having served one full term prior. 




== Minnesota ==
Democrat Hubert Humphrey, who would later become vice president, was re-elected over Republican challenger P. Kenneth Peterson. He had served since 1949. 



== Mississippi ==
Incumbent James Eastland, who had represented Mississippi in the Senate since 1943, was elected to another term in a landslide with 92% of the vote. 



== Missouri (special) ==

Following the death of incumbent Thomas C. Hennings, Democrat Edward V. Long, incumbent Lieutenant Governor of Missouri, ran against Republican Lon Hocker for the open seat. Long defeated Hocker by just under seven percentage points.



== Montana ==

After the retirement of incumbent Democrat James E. Murray, Democrat and representative Lee Metcalf and Republican Orvin Fjare ran for the open seat. Metcalf kept the seat Democratic, winning by just over 1%. This was despite Richard Nixon winning Montana in the concurrent presidential election.




== Nebraska ==
Republican Carl Curtis, who had served since 1955, was re-elected to a second term over Democrat Robert Conrad by nearly 17 percentage points. Curtis won all but four counties in the state.




== New Hampshire ==


Bridges died less than a year into his fifth term. With New Hampshire&#x27;s other Senator Norris Cotton up for re-election in 1962 and following Bridges death. Both of New Hampshire&#x27;s Senate seats would be up in the 1962 midterms.
== New Jersey ==
Incumbent Republican Clifford P. Case won re-election against Democrat Thorn Lord. Case would win re-election a few more times in 1966 and 1972, before losing in the 1978 Republican primary.



== New Mexico ==



== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Democrat B. Everett Jordan was re-elected to his first full term after winning a special election in 1958. He defeated Republican Kyle Hayes by a slightly slimmer margin than he defeated his Republican challenger in 1958.



== North Dakota (special) ==

A special election was held June 28, 1960, to fill the seat vacated by William Langer, who died November 8, 1959. Clarence Norman Brunsdale, a former Governor of North Dakota, was temporarily appointed to the seat on November 19 of that year until the special election was held. North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate Quentin N. Burdick faced Republican John E. Davis for election to the seat. Davis had been serving as Governor of the state since 1957.



== Oklahoma ==
Incumbent Democrat Robert Kerr won re-election to a third term, though he would die before the term was up and would be replaced by J. Democrat Howard Edmondson.




== Oregon ==


First-term Democrat Richard L. Neuberger had been diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1958 that became terminal by 1960 — but was kept from the public. Neuberger remained at home in early 1960, reportedly battling the flu. Though still publicly seeking re-election, he told his campaign chair, attorney Jack Beatty, &quot;Remember, there&#x27;s always another Neuberger,&quot; referring to his wife. The comment, combined with Neuberger&#x27;s reluctance to meet in public and weak voice on the phone, led Beatty to believe that Neuberger&#x27;s condition was grave, a suspicion confirmed by the Senator&#x27;s physician shortly before Neuberger died at Good Samaritan Hospital on March 9, 1960.

Democratic Oregon Supreme Court judge Hall S. Lusk was appointed March 16, 1960, to continue the term, pending a special election in which he was not a candidate.

Primaries were held May 20, 1960, in which Neuberger&#x27;s widow, Democrat Maurine B. Neuberger and the Republican former-Governor of Oregon Elmo Smith easily won nomination.

Maurine Brown Neuberger was elected November 8, 1960, both to finish the term and to the next term.

=== Oregon (special) ===




=== Oregon (regular) ===




Maurine Brown Neuberger retired at the end of the term.
== Rhode Island ==




== South Carolina ==




== South Dakota ==



== Tennessee ==





== Texas ==
Incumbent two-term Democrat Lyndon Johnson was easily re-elected, but he was also elected the same day as Vice President with John F. Kennedy being elected president. This was the last election in which a Democrat was selected to Texas&#x27;s class 2 Senate seat.




Johnson resigned January 3, 1961 — before the new Congress began — and former Democratic senator William A. Blakley was appointed to begin the term, pending a special election. Republican John Tower, who lost to Johnson here in 1960, would win that May 1961 special election.

== Virginia ==
Incumbent Democrat Absalom Willis Robertson was overwhelmingly re-elected with 81% of the vote, facing no Republican opposition. 




== West Virginia ==
Incumbent Jennings Randolph won re-election against Cecil Underwood, the incumbent governor of West Virginia.

<doc id="1177808" wikidata="Q1002565" url="?curid=1177808" title="Madalena, Azores">
<text>Madalena () is a municipality along the western coast of the island of Pico, in the Portuguese Azores. It has 6,332 inhabitants as of 2021, in an area of 147.12 km2. The municipality is fronted by the stratovolcano Pico in the eastern frontier, and the Faial Channel which divides Pico from the island of Faial seven kilometers away. It is made up of six freguesias (civil parishes) and is encircled almost entirely by the Atlantic Ocean except in the east, where it is bordered by the two remaining municipalities on the island: Lajes do Pico to the southeast, and São Roque do Pico to the northeast.

==History==
The settlement of the island of Pico occurred much later than most islands, partly due to greater interest shown in the other islands of the Central Group. For a time, only small herds, deposited by property-owners from Faial and Terceira, along with their caretakers (some of whom were slaves), were the only inhabitants of the island. It was not until the Infanta Beatriz proceeded to reorganize island administration and promote a greater colonization of the islands of the Central Group (between 1470 and 1480) that this changed. In 1483, Faial and Pico were integrated into one Captaincy, under the Fleming Josse van Huerter, and settlers were encouraged to colonize the island of Pico. But even still, the area of Madalena, with its rocky coastal plain, did not attract many new settlers and the community did not expand significantly until the municipality was created in 1723.

By the first quarter of the 18th century, the municipality of Madalena was already entrenched in the &quot;wine cycle&quot; which had multiplied the riches of its landowners and increased the desire of local settlers for emancipation from the Captaincy of Faial. The introduction of grapes to the island had occurred almost immediately with the first settlers, along with the cultivation of wheat and production of wine and olive oil (that were staples of the traditional Mediterranean Christian culture at the time). In the 15th and 16th century, the vineyards had been a source of subsistence, then export, because the soils and rocky terrain had made it almost impossible to develop a viable cereal culture. The diffusion of vineyards, that began in the 17th century, was a consequence of the soil and the conquest of markets for Pico&#x27;s &quot;verdelho wines&quot;. The uniquely Piquense culture of grape growing on the ground, or in volcanic rock patches, allowed the establishment of an industry and opened new markets for products originating in Madalena.

In the second half of the 17th century, the collapse of the woad industry, which supported many of the Azorean islands, and the decline of Iberian hegemony (Portugal was in a dynastic union with Spain at the time) in the North America, created a syndrome of crisis on the islands. The growth in viticulture onto better quality soils allowed an improvement of the castes, and a growth in the reputation and credibility of Piquense wines. In addition, new markets in North America and Brazil improved exports, which had primarily relied on English patronage and purchases.

The growth of wine exports from Pico elevated the neighboring town of Horta to the status of municipality, since all international shipments were made from the island&#x27;s sheltered port, creating a socio-economic disparity between the disenfranchised Piquense &quot;workers&quot; and the entrepreneurs/landowners from Faial. Along with a demographic growth on Madalena, this shift raised cries for the emancipation of Madalena and the island of Pico. In fact, Father Gaspar Frutuoso and Friar Agostinho de Montalverne certified that the colonists in Madalena had tripled by the 17th century; in 1587, there were less than 3000 inhabitants and around 9000 by 1695, forcing the remodelling of the local church. Pico moved &quot;up the ladder&quot; of urban hierarchies from fifth largest centre in the Azores to fourth, behind São Miguel, Terceira and Faial. By the middle of the 18th century the population was over 19000 inhabitants. The municipality was created on March 8, 1723.

In 1793, and between 1800 and 1802, Madalena contributed to 80% of the domestic sales on the island of Pico, primarily from brands of wines to markets in the New World, the Baltics, India and Macau. Until the early 19th century, exports were handled from Horta, where most of the mercantile fleets would make call (owing to its superior services and sheltered bay). But, the island&#x27;s growth ultimately supported the construction of a sheltered anchorage in Madalena, that would become the port.

Yet, as Madalena became the predominant center on the island, it was hit by the phylloxera plague, which destroyed many of the vineyards and began a period of economic deprivation. A diversification of economic activities was the only way to resolve these problems and improve the situation. The fruit industry, and in particular the citrus orchards, became an important staple in the ports of Horta and Madalena. Whaling also developed, but it had its most profound effects in the communities that circled the island, yet not within the jurisdiction of Madalena.

In the 20th century, the dairy industry continued the boom and bust cycle, while ecotourism centered on Pico and the histo-cultural nature of the island developed after European integration.

== Geography ==
The municipality comprises the following six parishes:
* Bandeiras - A village connected with the prosperity of the &quot;wine cycle&quot; of the 18th and 19th centuries; principal areas of note: Cais do Mourato and Cachorro, both &quot;resort towns&quot;, and where the latter is the location of a chapel known for a traditional penitential pilgrimage; and Cabeço Chão an area with a micro-climate.
* Candelária - A civil parish in an area of vineyards and orchards, birthplace of the late cardinal, Jose da Costa Nunes.
* Criação Velha - As its name in Portuguese means, the area of relatively older history, is still considered the true home of &quot;verdelho wine&quot;, where golden grapes ripen on large beds of lava, generally in the area of Lagido.
* Madalena - The trading and communications centre of the island; its position facing the great island of Faial (and the town of Horta) has made it, since its original settlement, the main port to ensure links with the neighbouring islands. It is bordered by the two islets that have (along with Mount Pico itself) been characteristic of the island of Pico: &quot;Ilhéu Deitado&quot; (&quot;Lying Down Islet&quot;) and &quot;Ilhéu em Pe&quot; (&quot;Standing Islet&quot;). The area of Areia Larga is considered the summer resort of the settlement, location of the oldest manor-houses associated with the &quot;wine cycle&quot;.
* São Caetano - Still referred to as &quot;Prainha do Sul&quot; (&quot;Little Southern Beach&quot;) or &quot;Prainha do Galeao&quot; (&quot;Little Beach of the Galleon&quot;, because of the ship built there by Garcia Gonçalves Madruga in the 16th century in order to pay debts owed to King João III), it includes the hamlet of Terra do Pao, and its small church dedicated to Saint Margaret.
* São Mateus - One of the oldest villages on the island, it was founded in 1482, as an alternative to the port of Madalena (connecting Pico with Faial), and as a base for whaling. It is also recognized for its lace-makers, who produce embroidery and crochet work.

<doc id="1177816" wikidata="Q2892339" url="?curid=1177816" title="Bayside, Queens">
<text>Bayside is a neighborhood located in the New York City borough of Queens. It is bounded by Whitestone to the northwest, the Long Island Sound and Little Neck Bay to the northeast, Douglaston to the east, Oakland Gardens to the south, and Fresh Meadows to the west. CNN Money ranked Bayside as one of the most expensive housing markets nationally when analyzing comparable detached homes throughout the United States. Despite its large housing stock of free-standing homes, it nationally ranks high in population density.

The first known written occurrence of the name Bayside was in a deed dated 1798, written as Bay Side. During the 19th century, Bayside was primarily farmland, where wealthy people from Manhattan would visit it as a rural resort. During the 1920s and 1930s, there were several movie studios in Astoria, and many movie stars lived in Bayside, some in posh homes. After the end of World War II, residential development of Bayside increased dramatically, particularly because of its station on the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Washington Branch, where a commuter could ride one train straight to Manhattan.

Bayside is located in Queens Community District 11 and its ZIP Codes are 11360, 11361, and 11364. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 111th Precinct. Politically, Bayside is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 19th and 23rd Districts.

==History==

Bayside&#x27;s history dates back to 2000 B.C. when the Matinecock Native American tribe first settled there. Around 1637, the Dutch West India Company encouraged Dutch farmers to settle on land grants in New Amsterdam, which was the name of New York then. William Lawrence, of England, built the first permanent building, a stone farmhouse, when he settled Bayside in 1644. Twenty years later, England took control of New Amsterdam, renamed it the Province of New York, and English people began settling the area. When Queens County was officially established in 1683, the Town of Flushing was one of the original five towns of Queens County, and today&#x27;s Bayside was within the Town of Flushing. During the American Revolutionary War, whaleboatmen from Connecticut raided the Bayside–Little Neck area, and Town of Flushing was occupied by the British military.

The first known written occurrence of the name Bayside was in a deed dated 1798, written as Bay Side.

During the 19th century, Bayside was primarily farmland, where wealthy people from Manhattan would visit it as a rural resort. The Bayside House, owned by Joseph Crocheron, was well-known for its clambakes. The Bayside House burned down in 1906, but Crocheron&#x27;s name lives on as the namesake of the Crocheron Park.

Bayside was the site of a murder by Peter Hains, a prominent army officer, abetted by his brother, sea novelist Thornton Jenkins Hains, who gunned down prominent editor William Annis at his yacht club in 1908. The so-called &quot;Regatta Murder&quot; led to a widely publicized trial at the Flushing County Courthouse. Peter Hains was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to eight years at Sing Sing, while Thornton Hains was acquitted.

During the 1920s and 1930s, there were several movie studios in Astoria, and movie stars such as Rudolph Valentino, Gloria Swanson, Norma Talmadge, W.C. Fields, and Charlie Chaplin lived in Bayside, some in posh homes. Former heavyweight boxing champion James J. (Gentleman Jim) Corbett lived in Bayside from 1902 to 1933, on a street that is named after him. When rumors ran rampant through the acting community that Bayside would be the location of a new movie and production studio, many actors purchased homes in anticipation of an easy commute to the studio. However, this rumored studio never materialized. When Hollywood emerged as the capital of the movie industry during the 1920s, many actors left Bayside to pursue careers in California.

After the end of World War II, residential development of Bayside increased dramatically, particularly because of its station on the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Port Washington Branch, where a commuter could ride one train straight to Manhattan without requiring a transfer at Jamaica station.

Bayside remains one of the safest and wealthiest neighborhoods in Queens. However, Bayside has been the setting to several organized crime incidents. Michael Pappadio of Bayside managed the Lucchese crime family&#x27;s interests in the Garment District of Manhattan, in secrecy from his wife. In 1989, upon a falling out with his superiors, he was murdered at a bagel shop in South Ozone Park. His wife reported Michael as missing, and three years later she learned about his death and his life in organized crime from the FBI. In April 2002, Gambino crime family associate Darren D&#x27;Amico was shot in the leg outside a restaurant in Bayside; his suspected shooter was Bonanno crime family associate Randolph Pizzolo.

==Location and boundaries==

Bayside is bordered by the Long Island Sound to the north and the Little Neck Bay to the northeast. To the east of Bayside is the Cross Island Parkway. To the west is Francis Lewis Boulevard and Auburndale, and to the northwest is Utopia Parkway. Bayside ends somewhere north of the Long Island Expressway, although Oakland Gardens and Hollis Hills are usually considered parts of Bayside.

===Bayside Gables===
Bayside Gables is a privately owned gated community located near the Bay Terrace shopping center and the Little Neck Bay. Homes in this community can sell for as high as $4 million.

===Bayside Hills===
Bayside Hills is a subdivision of Bayside&#x27;s south side, bordered by 48th Avenue to the north, the Long Island Expressway to the south, 211th Street to the west, and Springfield Boulevard on the east. The homes in Bayside Hills, many of which were built by Gross Morton, are generally more upscale and have higher property values.

Bayside Hills is known for its thirty-three street malls and accents, especially the gatehouse at Bell Boulevard and 48th Avenue, gateposts on 48th Avenue from 216th Street, and Bayside Hills Street Clock at 50th Avenue and 214th Street. The Victorian style street clock sits upon the Leo Green Clock Mall, dedicated to the local civic activist. Further east, Captain William C Dermody Triangle Park (48 Avenue and 216 Street) memorializes Dermody&#x27;s abolitionism and service in the Civil War, leading him to be mortally wounded at the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House. Much of the public green space is maintained by the NYC Parks Department and the Bayside Hills Civic Association.

The zip code 11364 is shared with Oakland Gardens.

===Bay Terrace===
Bay Terrace is an affluent neighborhood often considered part of the larger area of Bayside. The area encompasses gated cooperative/condominium developments such as the Bay Club and Baybridge Condominium. Other cooperative/condominium developments include the Towers at Waters Edge, the Kennedy Street Quad, the Bayside Townhouse Condominiums, Bay Country Owners, Bell Owners and others. The gated estate community of the &quot;Bayside Gables&quot; is also located within the Bay Terrace neighborhood, being the site of some of the only single family homes in the area. Bay Terrace overlooks the East River and the approaches to the Throgs Neck Bridge from the Clearview Expressway and Cross Island Parkway. The neighborhood is bounded on the west by the Clearview Expressway, on the south by 26th Avenue and 28th Avenue, and to the east and north by the Little Neck Bay and Little Bay. The civic organization serving Bay Terrace is the Bay Terrace Community Alliance (BTCA). Bay Terrace has the ZIP Code 11360.

===Oakland Gardens===

Oakland Gardens is a middle class neighborhood in the southern part of Bayside, bounded to the north by the Long Island Expressway, to the east by Alley Pond Park, to the south by Union Turnpike, and to the west by Cunningham Park. Bayside proper is to the north, and Queens Village and Bellerose are to the south and southeast, respectively. Fredrick Newbold Lawrence built a mansion in the area in 1847 called &quot;The Oaks&quot;, and the neighborhood&#x27;s name probably derives from that estate. Many people refer to Oakland Gardens as &quot;southern Bayside&quot;. Its median income is $54,031.

==Demographics==
Local data from the Census Bureau&#x27;s American Community Survey (based on samples from 2005 to 2009) shows that the demographics of Bayside changes significantly from area to area. For example, the pocket bordered by the Clearview Expressway to the west, Northern Boulevard to the north, Bell Boulevard to the east, and 48th Avenue to the south has a plurality (40%) of Asians, while 31% are Hispanic, 19% black and 13% white. Other areas are majority white, mostly inhabited by those of Italian, Greek, and Irish descent.

===2020 Census===
As according to the 2020 census data, the Bayside neighborhood had about an equal amount of White and Asian residents with each of their population ranging from 10,000 to 19,999 residents meanwhile each population of the Black and Hispanic residents were less than 5000.

===2010 Census===
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Bayside-Bayside Hills was 43,808, a decrease of 563 (1.3%) from the 44,371 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

<text>A transscrotal piercing is a body piercing that travels through the scrotum from front to back, or from side to side. It is a high risk procedure.

== Procedure ==

This male genital piercing is an extremely advanced procedure, and is not done using a needle. Instead a scalpel or occasionally a dermal punch is used to make an incision, which is then followed by suturing the front to the back in order to create a viable fistula. Large gauge jewelry is usually then inserted into the incision. If the bond between the front and the back of the piercing holds, healing is very quick and easy. Should a bond fail to form, healing can be lengthy and problematic.

This is a serious, complex piercing, and should an infection develop, it can develop within the scrotum and becomes dangerous very quickly. This procedure is often considered to be a potentially dangerous surgical procedure, and is not by any means common.

==Jewelry==

Transscrotal piercings are usually healed with a barbell although teflon, tygon or other flexible inert jewelry can also be used. Once healed, transscrotal piercings can be stretched quickly and, given the amount of surrounding tissue, to great size if desired. A variety of jewelry can be used in healed transscrotal piercings, including large captive bead rings and plugs. Jewelry for transscrotal piercings is often custom made.

==History and culture==

The transscrotal piercing is of contemporary origin, and has generally only been performed by practitioners of other &quot;extreme&quot; body modifications such as subdermal implants, transdermal implants and tongue splitting. Like other &quot;heavy&quot; genital modifications, it may be performed under less than ideal situations by amateur practitioners as part of CBT or other BDSM activities.

It is also sometimes spelled transcrotal piercing or referred to as a &quot;scrunnel&quot; (short for scrotal tunnel).

<doc id="1177834" wikidata="Q3602960" url="?curid=1177834" title="A Pattern Language">
<text>A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction is a 1977 book on architecture, urban design, and community livability. It was authored by Christopher Alexander, Sara Ishikawa and Murray Silverstein of the Center for Environmental Structure of Berkeley, California, with writing credits also to Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King and Shlomo Angel. Decades after its publication, it is still one of the best-selling books on architecture.

The book creates a new language, what the authors call a pattern language derived from timeless entities called patterns. As they write on page xxxv of the introduction, &quot;All 253 patterns together form a language.&quot; Patterns describe a problem and then offer a solution. In doing so the authors intend to give ordinary people, not only professionals, a way to work with their neighbors to improve a town or neighborhood, design a house for themselves or work with colleagues to design an office, workshop, or public building such as a school.

== Structure ==
Written in the 1970s at the University of California, Berkeley, &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; is structured as a network, where each pattern may have a statement referenced to another pattern by placing that pattern&#x27;s number in brackets, for example: (12) means go to the &quot;Community of 7,000&quot; pattern.

It includes 253 patterns and is written as a set of problems and documented solutions.

According to the authors, the work originated from an observation: 

The book primarily describes its patterns verbally, but has supporting illustrations. It describes exact methods for constructing designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs. The patterns are regarded by the authors not as infallible, but as hypotheses: 

Some patterns focus on materials: Other patterns focus on life experiences such as the Street Cafe (Pattern 88):

Grouping these patterns, the authors say, they form a kind of language, each pattern forming a word or thought of a true language rather than a prescriptive way to design or solve a problem. As the authors write on p xiii, &quot;Each solution is stated in such a way, it gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so you can solve the problem, in your way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place you are making it.&quot;

According to the authors, all the patterns were tested in the real world and then reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality. The patterns include provision for future modification and repair.
== Reception ==
This book&#x27;s method was adopted by the University of Oregon, as described in &quot;The Oregon Experiment&quot;, and remains the official planning instrument. It is adopted, in part, by some government agents as a building code.

Alexander&#x27;s conception of patterns, and pattern languages, were major factors in the creation of Ward Cunningham&#x27;s WikiWikiWeb, the first wiki, intended as an archive and discussion web application for the Portland Pattern Repository.

The idea of a pattern language applies to many complex engineering tasks. It is especially influential in software engineering, where design patterns are used to document collective knowledge in the field. In that field, it was a major inspiration to Richard P. Gabriel before he wrote &quot;Patterns of Software&quot;.

Will Wright cited the book as one of his inspirations for creating &quot;SimCity 2000&quot;.

<doc id="1177851" wikidata="Q7836949" url="?curid=1177851" title="Treaty for the Limitation of Naval Armament">
<text>The Treaties for the Limitation of Naval Armament were numerous accords in the 1920s signed variously by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, Italy and France. The treaties were an outgrowth of the Washington Naval Conference, held by the US in 1921–22.

One of the treaties, known as the Four Power Act (1921), provided that the US, UK, Japan and France would help maintain peace in the Pacific Ocean, while another, the Washington Naval Treaty (1922), also known as the Five Power Treaty, stipulated that the US, UK and Japan would build ships in a 5:5:3 ratio. This was originally proposed by American Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, and was rejected by the Japanese. Tokyo agreed, however, when a provision was added forbidding the US and UK to fortify their Pacific island possessions, but allowing Japan to do so. A third treaty, the Nine Power Treaty (1922), emphasized maintaining an Open Door Policy in China.

==Impetus==
Following the unprecedented carnage – and expense – of World War I the popular mood throughout the globe was peace and disarmament, which reigned throughout the 1920s. At the end of the Great War, Britain still had the largest navy afloat but its big ships were becoming obsolete, and the Americans and Japanese were rapidly building expensive new warships. London and Tokyo were allies in a treaty that was due to expire in 1922 but a developing American-Japanese rivalry for control of the Pacific Ocean was a long-term threat to world peace. London realized it had best cast its lot with Washington rather than Tokyo. To stop a needless, expensive and possibly dangerous arms race, the major countries signed a series of naval disarmament agreements. 

=== Washington Naval Conference ===
The most important gathering was the Washington Naval Conference, sponsored by President Warren Harding and run by Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Harding demanded action in order to gain domestic political credit. It came about in the form of the Washington Naval Treaty Of 1922. 

====Washington Naval Treaty====
To resolve technical disputes about the quality of warships, the conferees adopted a quantitative standard, based on tonnage displacement (a simple measure of the size of a ship). A ten-year agreement fixed the ratio of battleships at 5:5:3—that is 525,000 tons for the USA, 525,000 tons for Britain, and 315,000 tons for Japan. The dominant weapons systems of the era—battleships—could be no larger than 35,000 tons. The major powers allowed themselves 135,000:135,000:81,000 tons for developing aircraft carriers, a new form of warship. 

The Washington Conference avoided an expensive buildup by each power worrying the other two might be getting too powerful. The agreements forced the US to scrap 15 old battleships and two new ones, along with 13 ships under construction. Britain had to scrap ships too—indeed, more warships were “lost at Washington” than at any battle in history.

<doc id="1177864" wikidata="Q2432784" url="?curid=1177864" title="Florida State Road 423">
<text>State Road 423 (SR 423), known for most of its length as John Young Parkway, and Lee Road east of Orange Blossom Trail, is a four- and six-lane surface road in the U.S. state of Florida. SR 423 runs from SR 408 north to U.S. Routes 17/92 (US 17/92) just east of Interstate 4 (I-4).

SR 423 and its southern components serve as an alternate to the parallel Orange Blossom Trail. The road is named after John Young, a NASA astronaut and one of twelve men to walk on the Moon, who was from the Orlando area.

==Route description==
SR 423 is signed north-south when named John Young Parkway, while as Lee Road it is signed east-west.

SR 423 begins at an interchange with SR 408 and heads north towards Orange Blossom Trail. It then changes names to Lee Road east of Orange Blossom Trail, becoming an east-west road to its terminus at U.S. Route 17/92 just east of Interstate 4.

South of State Road 423&#x27;s southern terminus, John Young Parkway, known as County Road 423 continues south towards I-4, the Beachline Expressway and the Central Florida GreeneWay. South of the Osceola-Orange county line, it is unsigned County Road 531A and continues to a single-point urban interchange with the Osceola Parkway, ending a bit north of Pleasant Hill Road near Kissimmee, where the name changes to Orange Blossom Trail heading towards Campbell and to the Osceola-Polk county line. The section from US 192 southward is also numbered US 17-92.

==History==
The first section of SR 423 was built by the Florida Department of Transportation in the early 1970s, from Colonial Drive (SR 50) west of downtown Orlando north to Orange Blossom Trail (US 441-SR 500). Over the years, extensions to the south have been built, some by Orange County and some by the state.

==Future==
An additional extension—which included widening the existing roadway from four to six lanes from Shader Road to the U.S. 441/Orange Blossom Trail intersection, constructing two new overpasses and completing a new 1-mile alignment extension to Forest City Road/S.R. 434 at the intersection with Edgewater Drive/S.R. 424—was completed in 2013. Benefits of the extension include a direct connection between John Young Parkway and SR 434 and a much-improved alternate route to serve commuters during I-4 Ultimate construction.

Future improvements include widening John Young Parkway from SR 50 to Shader Road from four lanes to six lanes. This capacity improvement project will also improve the level of service and enhance safety. Design is expected to be complete in Spring 2015. Construction is currently not funded; the duration is anticipated to be 24 to 30 months.

<doc id="1177871" wikidata="Q7980246" url="?curid=1177871" title="Weinerville">
<text>Weinerville is an American children&#x27;s variety television program on Nickelodeon. It aired from 1993 to 1997. This series was based around a giant puppet stage that was designed to look like a city called Weinerville. It was created and hosted by Marc Weiner.

==Production==
&quot;Weinerville&quot;&#x27;s first season aired as part of a two-hour marathon every Sunday on Nickelodeon beginning on July 11, 1993. &quot;Weinerville&quot; quickly gained popularity; in the middle of the first season, on November 15, 1993, Nickelodeon began broadcasting it on weekday afternoons. Marc and his &quot;Weinerville&quot; characters hosted &quot;Nick New Year&#x27;s&quot;, a New Year&#x27;s Eve television special akin to &quot;Dick Clark&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Rockin&#x27; Eve&quot; for the child demographic. Airing in 1993 and 1994, the New Year&#x27;s Eve specials feature host segments, which serve as wraparounds for the best Nicktoons and shows of that year, where &quot;Weinerville&quot; characters read letters from viewers about their New Year&#x27;s resolutions while counting down to midnight, onat which point they celebrate by shooting slime into the sky.
For the 40-episode second season, which premiered on March 21, 1994, episodes aired daily and were later part of the Stick Stickly show &quot;Nick in the Afternoon&quot;, which includes Marc as Dottie in some segments. 

==Overview==
&quot;Weinerville&quot; was filmed at Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida. Its format is an audience-participation comedy series that focuses on Weiner and his puppets making a show. While early episodes do not have much of a plot or story line the show started to integrate these elements later in season one. In addition to 68 normal episodes, Nickelodeon aired five &quot;Weinerville&quot; television specials.

Following the first segment and a prelude to &quot;Playland&quot;, the viewers watch cartoons of &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot;, &quot;Honey Halfwitch&quot;, &quot;The Alvin Show&quot;, &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;, &quot;Courageous Cat and Minute Mouse&quot;, and &quot;Batfink&quot;.

==Characters==

===Human characters===
* Marc Weiner - The host of Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Weinerville&quot; who is tasked with solving Dottie&#x27;s or the town&#x27;s problems. In season one, Marc wears an unbuttoned Weinerville baseball jersey with a green undershirt. In season two, the color of his undershirt changes.
* Kevin Elemeno P. (pronounced: &quot;L-M-N-O-P&quot;) - The network executive character, played by Orlando local child actor Travis Robertson, whose name is a pun on the show&#x27;s executive producer, Kevin Kay.

===Puppets===
The puppets below feature Weiner&#x27;s head and a puppet body; their parts are pre-taped so that Weiner can interact with them.

* Dottie - The mayor of Weinerville. Marc is usually forced to solve Dottie&#x27;s problems and tends to get carried away with things if they do not get out of control. She has a sidekick/assistant named Zip. Dottie always quotes &quot;Oh well, welcome to Weinerville&quot; at the end of the cold opening.
* Baby Jeffrey - The puppet nephew of Marc. He usually introduces Marc at the beginning of each episode and always makes a mess.
* Big Pops - The owner of the diner Pops&#x27;. Big Pops usually does a lot with his nose, either picking it or playing the kazoo. Big Pops only appeared occasionally in Season One.
* Schnitzel - Marc&#x27;s sassy parrot sidekick in season one. While Schnitzel is usually played by Marc, an unnamed extra plays him when Marc is in front of the audience.
* Commander Ozone - A space captain that runs the AV-1 Spaceship. He defends evil and saves the universe with his sidekick Wilson. In season one he is named &quot;Captain Ozone&quot;.
* Eric Von Firstensecond - Commander Ozone&#x27;s evil enemy who always devises an evil scheme to take over Weinerville or to marry Dottie. Eric only appears in season two.
* Cocktail Frank - The bandleader and guitar player of the house band of the show &quot;Cocktail Frank and His Weenies.&quot; Frank is the lead singer/guitarist where his puppet band consisted of Posse on piano/turntables, Antoinette on drums, an unnamed bass guitarist, and an unnamed saxophone player.
* Joey Deluxe - The big shot manager and super entertainment agent.
* Soup Tureen - The host of &quot;That&#x27;s Not Fair&quot; who only appears in season two.

The ones listed below are puppet characters:

* Zip (performed by Scott Fellows) - Dottie&#x27;s assistant who always gets himself into trouble, makes his famous trademark scream, and crashes into the wall.
* Boney (performed by Marc Weiner) - An obvious parody of Barney, he is a dinosaur skeleton in sneakers that lives in the jungles of Weinerville. Boney is beloved by children, but hates them himself. When Boney quotes &quot;Now get outta here,&quot; the children and anyone else visiting him that are present leave his cave. The &quot;theme song&quot; at the end of his show consists of said puppet singing &quot;I&#x27;m Boney, I&#x27;m Boney, leave me aloney!&quot; Boney&#x27;s puppet appears differently in season two and the specials. According to the 1995 summer issue of &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;, Boney is Weiner&#x27;s favorite puppet.
* Pops (performed by Ray Abruzzo) - Known in season one as &quot;Little Pops&quot;, he is the local chef who works with Big Pops. After Big Pops is dropped from the show, Pops takes over the restaurant. He sometimes argues with Louie, but they tend to get along.
* Louie (performed by Scott Fellows) - The local laundromat owner who has disagreements with Pops, but they tend to get along.
* Socko (performed by Marc Weiner) - An inverted hand puppet who likes to kick Marc&#x27;s buttocks, performed with his own props, who makes sarcastic gestures when things do not go right.
* Wilson - The sidekick of Commander Ozone. In season one, he has a squeaky voice like Zip.
* Professor Phosphate (performed by Scott Fellows and David Jordan) - A puppet scientist with green hair who can only be seen from the waist up who debuted in season two. Professor Phosphate is the owner of Weinerville Labs and often causes explosions with inventions that malfunction. Despite this, he often solves the problems.
* Fufusky - A grub-like alien who is Eric von Firstensecond&#x27;s alien sidekick. He stuns people using his breath ray (silly string).
* Berny - He is responsible for bringing out the Weinerizer being pulled by his tractor.

===Other sketches===
The show also featured several non-puppet characters played by Weiner himself:

* Captain Bob - Captain Bob is a sea captain in yellow rain gear that constantly cracks puns. He owns the S.S. Bob at Port Weinerville (which is located near the building where Cocktail Frank and His Wienies are located). On many shows, an audience member would be invited to climb aboard where an offscreen person would fling water on him before the &quot;tidal wave&quot; (a bucket of water, or, in some cases, slime, thrown by a stage hand) soaked the participant. Captain Bob first appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; when Weiner was a writer in the early 1980s. In scenes in which Marc Weiner interacts with Captain Bob, an actor seen from behind would portray Captain Bob with Weiner dubbing his voice in during post-production.
* The Weinerville General Store - Members of the audience are also called down to participate in various activities during the main part of the show, such as helping to demonstrate items in the Weinerville General Store. A recurring joke on the show takes place in the General Store, in which Weiner sells comedic props similar to those of Carrot Top. Nearly everything in the store sells for $13.50. It only appears in season one.
* Running Joke - Occasionally, the &quot;$13.50&quot; gag is used in other segments. For instance, on the &quot;Talent Show&quot; episode, the winners won with 1,350 points. On the &quot;DTV&quot; episode, DTV was on channel 1350. On the General Store and Captain Bob skits, that would be the price when Marc would hand the participant anything. &quot;$13.50&quot; originated as an inside joke between Weiner and head writer Ray Abruzzo. Thinking it was funny, the two ultimately put it in the show. 
* That&#x27;s Not Fair! - A game show where a kid and an adult played for points answering questions. Usually the kids win. It was only featured in Season 2. According to an interview with Marc Weiner, &quot;That&#x27;s Not Fair&quot; was a pilot he made for Comedy Central in 1991, after it was tested, the network said it was appropriate for children, so Nickelodeon got a hold of it and the pilot became &quot;Weinerville&quot;.
* Weinerizer — The show always ends with Weiner choosing two people from the audience to get &quot;Weinerized&quot; (turned into puppets). The participants enter a contraption called the Weinerizer upon being helped by two crew members. The Weinerizer appears to shrink them to puppet size (by having contestants place their heads into a hole above a miniature puppet body). They compete in a game and the winner receives &quot;The Golden Hot Dog&quot; as well as a dose of green slime. During the credits, the two people are seen being let out of the Weinerizer. Although the audience members were ostensibly chosen at random, Matt Day (who at the time was working on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Clarissa Explains It All&quot;) revealed that participants were sometimes selected beforehand, including himself on the &quot;Baseball&quot; episode in Playland.
* Playland - In a prelude, Weiner selects two audience members to be placed in the Weinerizer and sent to Playland. In season two, an alarm sounds to alert Weiner that it is almost time for Playland. Participants then compete in a game to test their skills operating their puppet bodies. The runner-up receives the &quot;Silver Hot Dog&quot;, with the winner receiving the &quot;Golden Hot Dog&quot; as well as the &quot;Special Topping&quot; (a small amount of green slime dumped onto the player&#x27;s head). If a malfunction occurs or both players tie, they both get the &quot;Golden Hot Dog&quot;. Occasionally, both players receive the Special Topping, especially when both players are adults, and if the game involves pies, both contestants are hit with pies themselves instead of anyone getting the Special Topping (the special topping is awarded for pie games in season two). The Playland stage was enlarged and revamped the second season to incorporate more elaborate stunts; these frequently had the contestants facing each other and squirting water or whipped cream at some target, usually soaking the other contestant in the process. Some season 2 stunts are team stunts where each player has a non-Weinerized teammate. Season one was a carnival-style. In the second season, it was a radio-active style.

<text>William Harwar Parker (October 8, 1826 – December 30, 1896) was an officer in the United States Navy and later in the Confederate States Navy. His autobiography, entitled &quot;Recollections of a Naval Officer 1841–1865&quot;, provides a unique insight into the United States Navy of the mid-19th century during an era when the Age of Sail was coming to an end and the advent of steam power and ironclads was beginning.

==Early life and entrance to the Navy==
He was born in New York City, the son of Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, Sr. and Sarah Jay Bogardus (b. 1794), daughter of Robert Bogardus (1771–1841). Commodore Foxhall A. Parker, Jr., was his brother.

William H. Parker became a United States Navy midshipman at the early age of 15, recalling in his biography that he had held his father&#x27;s hand while being escorted to his first ship.

Parker&#x27;s appointment date as a midshipman was on October 19, 1841, just after his 15th birthday. His first assignment was to the receiving ship USS &quot;North Carolina&quot;, and he reported on board October 27 when the ship was moored at New York City.

==Midshipman cruises==

In April 1842, Parker was issued his first sea orders and reported to . &quot;Columbus&quot; set sail on August 29, 1842, and proceeded to Gibraltar, arriving in the fall and spending the winter in that port. In the spring of 1842, &quot;Columbus&quot; sailed to the port of Mahón with a port call to Toulon. The ship then returned to Gibraltar and, in June 1843, set sail for Madeira and then on to Gata, Cape Verde. At the start of July 1843, &quot;Columbus&quot; made for Rio de Janeiro.
&quot;Columbus&quot; arrived at Rio de Janeiro on July 29, 1843, and spent two months in port before proceeding to Buenos Aires. It was in Buenos Aires that Parker personally met Juan Manuel de Rosas and quickly recognized him as a &quot;cruel ruthless dictator&quot;.

In February 1844, &quot;Columbus&quot; returned to Rio de Janeiro and in March set sail for a return to the United States. The ship arrived in New York City in 1844 and put in lay-up. Parker was granted a three-month leave and then, in September 1844, reported to moored at Philadelphia. &quot;Potomac&quot; set sail in November 1844 for Norfolk and then onward to Port-au-Prince in Haiti. Arriving in December 1944, the ship then proceeded to Port Royal, Jamaica and then on to Havana. It was in Havana that Parker recalls his ship almost running aground due to heavy winds off of Morro Castle.

After spending the winter in Havana, &quot;Potomac&quot; set sail for the United States and arrived in Pensacola in February 1845. The United States was by this time preparing for the Mexican–American War, which, although yet undeclared, was already causing both the US and Mexico to mobilize troops. Parker states in his biography that he recalls seeing the 7th Infantry Regiment beginning to mass in Florida for the coming invasion of Mexico. In February 1845, &quot;Potomac&quot; sailed for Veracruz and for the rest of the summer practiced gunnery exercises off the coast of Mexico. In August 1845, the ship returned to Pensacola and then was sent north to Norfolk for major structural repairs. The ship arrived in Norfolk on December 20, 1845, and was put in lay-up with the bulk of the crew reassigned.

During his midshipman years, Parker also contracted yellow fever on two separate occasions. The first time was in the summer of 1846, and the second infection was in 1847. Parker&#x27;s private observations of yellow fever was caused by the mosquito.

==Mexican–American War==

In February 1846, Parker applied to rejoin the crew of USS &quot;Potomac&quot; and was assigned as a midshipman under the command of Captain John H. Aulick. Parker served as Aulick&#x27;s aide, and remarks in his biography indicate that the Captain was very stern with the crew.

&quot;Potomac&quot; sailed for Mexico in March 1846 and anchored off of Sacrificios Island (near Veracruz). The vessel was assigned to a larger blockade squadron under the command of Commodore David Conner. In May 1846, &quot;Potomac&quot; relocated to Brazos Santiago and put troops ashore at Point Isabel. It was here that Parker witnessed the Battle of Palo Alto with the assigned naval personnel manning batteries supporting the advancing troops of Winfield Scott.

Following the engagement at Palo Alto, &quot;Potomac&quot; returned to Veracruz and anchored off of Green Island, where it supported the blockade of Veracruz. It was during the blockage that Parker participated in his first actual combat engagement, this occurring when Parker was attached to a detail refilling ship&#x27;s water flasks at the Antigua River. Attacked by a small force of the Mexican Army, Parker&#x27;s detail, as well as a contingent of United States Marines, was able to repel the Mexicans and withdraw with few casualties. The engagement was considered insignificant in the overall scheme of the Mexican War, but did cause the U.S. Navy to contract for water shipped in from Texas rather than attempt foraging operations off the Mexican shoreline.

In late 1846, &quot;Potomac&quot; became part of the large naval force preparing for the all out invasion of Veracruz. As the fleet gathered some to the southeast of Veracruz, Parker witnessed the grounding of the fleet flagship, . &quot;Cumberland&quot; was then rotated out of action to be replaced by . Parker recalls in his biography that one of the ranking squadron commanders at the time (Matthew C. Perry) blamed the grounding on Commodore David Conner, but Conner was not relieved of his command, but rather simply transferred his flag to &quot;Raritan&quot;.

On February 24, 1847, shortly after the Battle of Buena Vista, the U.S. Navy began to offload the first elements of the 4th Infantry Regiment. The main offload of the entire American invasion force then began on March 9. During this period, Parker met and conversed with both then Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant and Captain Joseph E. Johnston.

The Battle of Veracruz began on March 22, 1847. The day before, the squadron to which &quot;Potomac&quot; was assigned had shifted to the command of Commodore Matthew Perry. On March 23, Perry ordered several naval units ashore to set up shore batteries. Parker was assigned to the shore battery from &quot;Potomac&quot; with all batteries under the overall command of Captain Alexander Slidell Mackenzie. The Army liaison officer to the Naval Shore Battery was Captain Robert E. Lee.

During the bombardment of Veracruz, Parker was slightly wounded when a bullet grazed his knee and also witnessed his first close quarters casualty when a gunner a few feet away was decapitated by an enemy round shot. Parker also witnessed extreme bravery from a fellow midshipman, Charles M. Fauntleroy, who would later become an important officer in the Confederate Army.

After Veracruz surrendered less than a week later, Parker returned aboard &quot;Potomac&quot;, which then proceeded to anchor off of a fortress overlooking Veracruz. At the start of June 1847, &quot;Potomac&quot; departed, under the command of Commodore Perry aboard , to capture the region of Alvarado. Arriving to find the town already surrendered to Lieutenant Charles G. Hunter, Perry had Hunter reprimanded for acting without authority, even though the town had surrendered without firing a shot (it was later revealed that Perry had hoped to occupy the town in force and capture all of the livestock and supplies).

Perry then led his squadron on to capture Tuspan and from there planned what became known as the Tabasco Expedition. On June 16, 1847, Parker was transferred to USS &quot;Raritan&quot; in order to participate in the expedition and volunteered to serve in a formation of naval pioneers being sent ashore to capture Tabasco. Again arriving to find the town already surrendered to a pair of steam gunboats, Parker returned to &quot;Raritan&quot;, which then set sail for Norfolk, Virginia.

&quot;Raritan&quot; arrived at Norfolk in late July 1847 and, for Parker at least, the Mexican War was over. The conflict on the Gulf Coast came to an effective end when Mexico City fell in September 1847, and a peace treaty was signed the next year in February 1848.

==Naval Academy and Africa service==

In August 1847, Parker was detached from USS &quot;Raritan&quot; and placed on leave; he spent the time visiting his father in Boston before reporting to the United States Naval Academy in September. The school then being just a few years old, and most of the students coming from at-sea assignments, Parker was placed in an advanced curriculum with graduation scheduled for the next summer.

The Superintendent of the Naval Academy was in those days Commander George P. Upshur, and Parker&#x27;s primary instructor in naval warfare was Lieutenant John A. Dahlgren (who would later become a rear admiral). During Parker&#x27;s few months at the Academy, he also witnessed two duels, one of which was fought on the traditional dueling ground of Bladensburg and the other which was fought on the Academy grounds itself. Dueling was by then illegal, and those involved were dismissed from the Academy by direct order of President James Polk; Zachary Taylor overturned two of the dismissals three years later.

On July 1, 1848, Parker was declared a graduate of the Naval Academy after passing a board of examination and declared a Passed Midshipman. In August 1848, Parker received orders to but requested a change of orders to the sloop of war , which was then slated to perform anti-slave trade duties in African waters. Parker reported to &quot;Yorktown&quot; in September, and the ship set sail for Africa on November 22, 1848. Parker recalls in his biography that the voyage was over some very rough seas and, for one of the few times in his entire naval career, Parker became violently seasick. In December 1848, &quot;Yorktown&quot; arrived at Madeira and then sailed on the Cape Verde. The rest of the month was spent at the cape, and then, in January 1849, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed to Porto Praya (now Praia). It was here that several of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; officers rotated off the ship and Parker was made Acting Master.

&quot;Yorktown&quot; then sailed to Bathurst, off the Gambia River, where the ship put in for repairs to her rudder. In February 1849, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed to Liberia, where she participated as an observer in a Liberian attack against several native tribes living in the interior jungle. It was here that Parker met the President of Liberia (Joseph Jenkins Roberts) who traveled as a guest of honor on board &quot;Yorktown&quot;. &quot;Yorktown&quot; moored at Monrovia in November 1849 and spent the winter in this port. In January 1850, &quot;Yorktown&quot; sailed for Cape Palmas and then on to several port calls in the Gulf of Guinea. These included the ports of Accra, Elmina, and Cape Coast Castle. In February 1850, &quot;Yorktown&quot; headed for Ouidah, which was then in the Kingdom of Dahomey. Along the way, &quot;Yorktown&quot; met up with both the British brig under the command of Archibald McMurdo and , which was then under the command of Captain Andrew H. Foote.

In June 1850, &quot;Yorktown&quot; made ready for its return to Porto Praya. The ship moored at Funchal on July 1, and it was here that the ship celebrated Independence Day. The ship then continued to Porto Praya and then, on August 1, sailed for the Canary Islands. Parker remarks in his biography that the ship&#x27;s crew was in very high spirits at this point, having completed a deployment to Africa with only two deaths, both to a sickness which Parker called &quot;African fever&quot;. On August 30, 1850, &quot;Yorktown&quot; moored at Las Palmas then continued on towards the port of Boa Vista and the island of St. Jago. On September 4, the ship sailed toward Mayo (now Maio) Island and, on September 6, 1850, struck a reef. Over the course of two days, the ship capsized and was lost, but the crew was able to offload most of the supplies and suffered no casualties.

The crew of USS &quot;Yorktown&quot; lived on Mayo Island for over a month, during which time Parker recalls that relaxation was the norm, and the crew did little more than &quot;relax and play in donkey races&quot;. On October 8, arrived to pick up the crew, and they were transferred to , which sailed for Norfolk, arriving in December 1850.

==The 1850s==

In the summer of 1851, Parker spent three months on leave and then reported to , which was then assigned to perform coastal survey duties. For the remainder of the summer, Parker sailed with the &quot;Washington&quot; along the Nantucket Shoals, surveying such areas as Block Island and the so-called &quot;No man&#x27;s land&quot;. The cruise of &quot;Washington&quot; ended in October 1851 when the ship sailed to New York City for a lay-up. The crew was discharged and reassigned, and Parker reported to the Washington Navy Yard for administrative duties.

In the spring of 1852, Parker was ordered to proceed to Boston, where he had orders to report aboard , which was the first propeller-driven ship in the United States Navy. Reporting to the vessel, and foreseeing it as a &quot;dismal failure&quot;, Parker applied for a transfer to a regular sail ship. Parker&#x27;s feelings were somewhat prophetic, since &quot;Princeton&quot; would in fact suffer a major accident several months later when one of its guns exploded and killed several high-ranking dignitaries who were then on board.

Parker reported aboard in July 1852, the ship then being under the command of George N. Hollins. In the weeks leading up to vessel making sail, Parker lived in Boston and had the chance to meet one of the leading mystics of the time, Margaret Fox. Fox attempted to talk Parker into giving up the Navy for a career as a psychic, but Parker amusingly declined the offer.

In August 1852, &quot;Cyane&quot; sailed for Havana and nearly went aground near the Abaco Islands due to, what Parker believed, was incompetence on the part of the ship&#x27;s sailing master. The ship then made port in Havana before sailing for Pensacola for supplies and provisions. In Pensacola, the ship found orders to return to Havana and, on this trip, the vessel was not as lucky and did ground itself near to Bahia Honda. As a result, the sailing master was transferred and Parker become Acting Master of &quot;Cyane&quot;. When the ship transferred one of its lieutenants only a few days later, Parker was appointed an Acting Lieutenant. During this same period, Parker met the Vice President of the United States (William R. King), who was then traveling aboard .

&quot;Cyane&quot; next sailed for Key West, where it put in for &quot;decontamination&quot; due to a major rat infestation. Spending the winter in Key West, the ship sailed for Greytown, on the Mosquito Coast, in the spring of 1853. Here, &quot;Cyane&quot; spent 70 days safeguarding American steamer companies which were operating in an area frequented by pirates as well as hostile townspeople living in Greystown (this town would be bombarded and destroyed in 1854 after holding the United States Ambassador to Nicaragua hostage for several days).

Towards the end of the summer, &quot;Cyane&quot; departed Greytown and proceeded to Pensacola for supplies then headed north to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The vessel was placed under the overall command of Commodore W. B. Shubrick and was then assigned to fishery guarding duties. To this end, the ship sailed for Eastport, Maine and then on to Saint John, New Brunswick. By the fall of 1853, &quot;Cyane&quot; had made a tour of the Bay of Fundy, the Straights of Canso and had made its way into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Ending its tour in September, &quot;Cyane&quot; returned to New Hampshire and then proceeded to Philadelphia for layup and refit. In October 1853, Parker was detached and proceeded to the Naval Academy for duty as an instructor.

Parker served as an instructor at the United States Naval Academy from October 1853 until the fall of 1857. From 1853 to 1855 he was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics and in 1855 become a Professor of Navigation and Astronomy. In December 1853, Parker married Margaret Griffin, and the two would remain married until Parker&#x27;s death, but the couple never had any children.

During the summer of 1855, Parker participated as an instructor on a midshipman training cruise as part of his duties as a Naval Academy instructor. The ship, , visited the ports of Eastport, Cape Cod, Portland, and Boston before returning to Annapolis in the fall. In September 1855, Parker was also promoted to the permanent rank of lieutenant in the United States Navy.

In the fall of 1857, Parker was detached from the Naval Academy and reported aboard , which was then under the command of Commander Robert B. Hitchcock. On October 17, 1857, &quot;Merrimack&quot; sailed from Boston on a mission to the United States Minister to Brazil (Richard Kidder Meade) to his new assignment. The ship made port in Rio de Janeiro in December 1957 and then proceeded to round Cape Horn to enter the Pacific Ocean at the start of the new year.

In February 1858, &quot;Merrimack&quot; made port in Talcahuano, Chile, and from there sailed to the Chincha Islands. At the end of February, the ship put into port in the small coastal town of Callao with shore leave authorized for the crew. Parker took the opportunity to travel to Lima, where he witnessed &quot;some type of revolution&quot; which was underway under the leadership of Lizardo Montero Flores.

In March 1858, &quot;Merrimack&quot; sailed for Panama, where Parker had the foresight to predict that a Panama Canal would one day be constructed. After a layover at Perico Island, &quot;Merrimack&quot; headed into the open Pacific Ocean, reaching the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii) in September 1858. The ship remained in Honolulu until October and then set course for a return to Central America.

In December 1858, &quot;Merrimack&quot; arrived at El Realejo, Nicaragua, and remained in this port for a total of three months, during which time Parker met the President of Nicaragua. In March, the ship then returned from Panama, where it was placed under a new squadron commander, Commodore John B. Montgomery; the ship then headed to Valparaiso, arriving in June 1859, and remained at this station until October when &quot;Merrimack&quot; was relieved by . The ship then set a return course for the United States, stopping in Rio de Janeiro in November. It was at this time that the crew was informed of the John Brown Raid and, according to Parker&#x27;s biography, he had already come to the conclusion that civil war between the North and South was inevitable.

In December 1859, &quot;Merrimack&quot; reached Norfolk, and the vessel was laid up for an overhaul and the crew discharged. During the voyage, Parker had written a naval guide entitled &quot;Instructions for Naval Light Artillery&quot; (New York, 1862) and had translated a French instruction, entitled &quot;Tactique Navale&quot;, into English.

==Virginia State Navy and Confederate States Navy==
As the United States broke up in 1861, the Parker brothers followed separate paths. Foxhall A. Parker, Jr., remained in the U.S. Navy, while William &quot;went south&quot; to join the Virginia State Navy and, in June 1861, the Confederate States Navy. He commanded the gunboat CSS &quot;Beaufort&quot; into 1862, taking part in the Roanoke Island battle on February 7–8, 1862 and the actions in Hampton Roads on March 8 and March 9, 1862. In mid-May, he served at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff when the batteries there were attacked by Union warships.

After several months&#x27; shore duty, First Lieutenant Parker was sent to Charleston, South Carolina, where he was executive officer of the ironclad CSS &quot;Palmetto State&quot; and participated in her attack on Union blockaders in January 1863. In October 1863, he became superintendent of the Confederate States Naval Academy, based on board CSS &quot;Patrick Henry&quot; in the James River, Virginia. He also commanded the ironclad CSS &quot;Richmond&quot;. In April 1865, as the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia was evacuated, he led the Naval Academy&#x27;s midshipmen as a guard for their failing Government&#x27;s archives and treasury.

==Post-war activities==
Following the end of the American Civil War, William H. Parker was captain of a Pacific Mail steamship and then served as president of Maryland Agricultural College (later known as the University of Maryland at College Park). Parker attempted to institute a Naval Cadet Corps in much the same manner as some other private colleges had done with Army styled groups (see Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets as an example). When the school began dropping in its enrollment, and after Parker attempted to have the name of the college changed, he was asked to resign, which he did reluctantly in 1882.

The following summer, Parker was shot in the head by the Apaches. He survived but lost his sight in one eye. The ball was too near his brain for doctors to remove it, so it remained with him the rest of his life. In October 1882 he married Nettie T. Jenkins, the daughter of Admiral Thornton Jenkins at his home, where both Parker and Jenkins would later die.

In his later years, Parker suffered from alcoholism, but this did not prevent his being appointed the Minister to Korea (the predecessor title to the United States Ambassador to Korea) in June 1886. Recognized as a &quot;hopeless drunkard&quot; by the chargé d&#x27;affaires, George Clayton Foulk, Parker was relieved of his position less than a year later. Parker returned to live in Washington, D.C., where he enjoyed retirement and focused on writing.

==Death==
Parker died suddenly, at the age of 70, on December 30, 1896.

==Naval service record==
Over a career which lasted 24 years, Parker served in three different navies (the United States Navy, Virginia State Navy, and the Confederate Navy) and he performed duty on several different naval vessels of various types and sizes. The largest of these was the 74-gun warship , and the smallest was the 85-foot gunboat, .

Shore assignments included three tours at the United States Naval Academy (one as a student and two as an instructor), administrative duty in the Washington Navy Yard, and various detached duties in the first months of the American Civil War serving as a navy officer attached to various Confederate Army installations. Parker&#x27;s last assignment was as the Commander of the Confederate Naval Academy.

Since Parker&#x27;s service was before the creation of any significant military awards, his only official decorations are a commendation from the United States Secretary of State, for diplomatic actions in the 1850s, and the thanks of the Confederate Congress for gun fire support during the Battle of Roanoke Island. His service in the civil war also grants him entitlement to the Civil War Campaign Medal, but this decoration was created after Parker&#x27;s death.

Parker&#x27;s highest permanent rank, in all of the navies with which he served, was that of lieutenant. While commanding &quot;Beaufort&quot;, however, photographic evidence indicates Parker wore the insignia of a commander and, while head of the Confederate Naval Academy, was referred to as a captain. Thus, for practical purposes, Parker&#x27;s highest rank on active duty was that of captain.

<text>London Rail was a directorate of Transport for London (TfL), involved in the relationship with the National Rail network within Greater London, UK which managed TfL&#x27;s non-London Underground train services.

Rail for London, established in 2006, provides rail passenger transport services in London.

== Operations ==
London Rail managed the London Overground (LO), London Trams, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), and the Elizabeth line. As part of an internal restructure within TfL, it recently merged with the (previously separate) London Underground directorate, bringing all of Greater London local transport services on rails under one division.

The London Overground was established in 2007 when TfL took over the control of the former National Rail Silverlink franchise in 2007. It has since taken on more services through a former London Underground line and over other Network Rail lines. London Rail lets a concession to operate the Overground. Operation is contracted to Arriva Rail London (owned by Arriva UK Trains) until 2024.

London Trams is responsible only for the Croydon Tram known as Tramlink. Tramlink was set up in 2000 by a private finance initiative. It was bought by TfL in 2008 and is operated on its behalf by FirstGroup. London Trams has been working on proposals for other tram schemes in west and central London, however as of 2011 all are unfunded or cancelled.

The Docklands Light Railway was established in 1987 and has seen significant expansion since. Its operation has been contracted out as a concession to a joint venture between Keolis and Amey since 2014. There are also other concessionaires who have built and managed extensions.

The Elizabeth Line (formerly known as Crossrail) also operates as a concession from London Rail. It already operates the Shenfield Metro services, taking over from Abellio Greater Anglia on 31 May 2015, as well as the ex-Heathrow Connect route since 20 May 2018.

== National Rail in Greater London ==
The National Rail network within Greater London carries large numbers of commuters into London and also provides many local services, especially within South London.

Under the Greater London Authority Act 1999 Transport for London was given powers to consult with the train operators and as such London Rail is therefore more of an enabler than an operator, and has developed partnerships with the Department for Transport (who are responsible for rail strategy), Network Rail (who own the infrastructure) and the various train operating companies (who operate the services) in order to further its aims.

A pilot project was launched in 2003 to promote the various services provided by train operating companies in South London under one umbrella brand, Overground Network. The scheme included station upgrades, signage and publicity, but promotion of the brand had ceased by 2007.

London Rail also influences rail freight and freight depots in Greater London. In August 2007, London Rail published its &#x27;Rail Freight Strategy&#x27; report.

Both former Mayors of London Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson have expressed the desire to gain control of all local rail services in Greater London in the future and make them part of the London Overground. London Overground has already taken over Lea Valley Lines services from Liverpool Street to Enfield Town, Cheshunt and Chingford and
Romford to Upminster Line services on 31 May 2015.

<text>Tremosine sul Garda (Brescian: ) is a &quot;comune&quot; in the Italian province of Brescia, in Lombardy, near Lake Garda. It is one of I Borghi più belli d&#x27;Italia (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;). It is divided into 18 &quot;frazioni&quot;; Pieve is the frazione which has the town hall. Vesio is the biggest one. Campione is a frazione famous for aquatic sport, such as kitesurfing, and it is the only one on the shore of Lake Garda. 

==History==
The first human settlement dates back to Neolithic times. Rich vegetation and abundant water encouraged migration from south of Lake Garda. There is no information about the period from 3000 BC to the Roman era. During the Ancient Roman period, rich Romans owned villas in Tremosine.

It became part of the Republic of Venice in 1426. The main activities in Tremosine were agriculture (olive trees, grapevines and fruit) and farming (goats, cows and donkeys). There were also a little iron industry and a manganese cave in Sermerio. In San Michele and Val di Brasa there were metallurgic centres where it was possible to utilize hydraulic energy.

==Frazioni==
Arias, Bazzanega, Cadignano, Campione, Castone, Mezzema, Musio, Pieve (the main Frazione), Pregasio, Priezzo, Secastello, Sermerio, Sompriezzo, Ustecchio, Vesio, Villa, Voiandes, Voltino

<doc id="1177906" wikidata="Q2975184" url="?curid=1177906" title="Clamato">
<text>Clamato , , is a commercial drink made of reconstituted tomato juice concentrate and sugar, which is flavored with spices, dried clam broth and MSG. It is made by Mott&#x27;s. The name is a portmanteau of &quot;clam&quot; and &quot;tomato&quot;. It is also referred to colloquially as &quot;clamato juice&quot;. It is consumed in Canada, Mexico, and the United States, to a lesser extent. It is very often mixed with alcohol to make a Caesar, a drink similar to a Bloody Mary.

== History ==
In 1935, The Clamato Corporation of New York produced &quot;clam and tomato juice in combination&quot;.

In 1938, House &amp; Garden magazine printed a recipe for &quot;Tomato-Clam Juice Cocktail&quot;, consisting of tomato juice, clam broth, and salt.

In 1940, &quot;Lobster King&quot; Harry Hackney was granted the Clamato trademark.
His Atlantic City restaurant, Hackney&#x27;s, sold Clamato juice in cans.

In 1957, McCormick &amp; Company, Inc. applied for, and later acquired, the Clamato brand name for the seasoned blend of tomato juice and clam juice. This trademark is still valid and now owned by Keurig Dr Pepper.

Clamato was produced in its current form beginning in 1966
 by the Duffy-Mott company in Hamlin, New York, created by Francis Luskey, a chemist, and another employee working out of California who wanted to create a Manhattan clam chowder style cocktail by combining tomato juice and clam broth with spices. The employees named the new cocktail &quot;Mott&#x27;s Clamato&quot; and secured the trademark for the new brand. The brand was owned by Cadbury-Schweppes after the company bought Mott&#x27;s in 1982. As of 2008, it is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper after the business was spun off of Cadbury-Schweppes.

In recent years, the Clamato label was updated and no longer shows the image of a clam, an attempt by the manufacturer to downplay the seafood aspect of the beverage.

== Lawsuits ==
In 1998, Cadbury-Schweppes sued FBI Foods, a former contract manufacturer of Clamato, claiming that their brand &quot;Caesar Cocktail&quot; was proof of breach of confidence, claiming that the product used their recipe as a base. They brought the case to the Supreme Court of British Columbia. The initial ruling was appealed. The case reached the Supreme Court of Canada and it was ruled that FBI Foods would pay Cadbury-Schweppes $300,000 for revenue they lost in the first year of competition. It was reasoned that any juice maker would have been able to reverse-engineer the recipe within a year.

Since 2018, Keurig Dr Pepper has sued several companies who have been infringing on the Clamato trademark using the &quot;mato&quot; suffix to describe their version of the product. This is done in order to prevent the genericization of the trademark by making sure Clamato stays a distinctive brand name, as well as to preserve the brand image and identity.

== Consumption ==
Clamato is used primarily as a drink mix for alcoholic beverages (an estimated 60% of sales in the US in 2008), and it is popular for this in both Canada and Mexico, but less so in the United States (outside of Canadian-American and Mexican-American communities).

=== With vodka ===
In Canada, Clamato is primarily used to make a cocktail called a Caesar. It was reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2018, that one third of North America&#x27;s supply of Clamato is consumed by Canadians, the majority of which is used to make Caesars. Since 2001, Cadbury Schweppes (now Canada Dry Motts) has been selling an alcoholic version of the beverage called the Clamato Caesar in the Canadian market.

=== With beer ===
Clamato is also added to beer in various beer cocktails, such as the michelada; the most basic is known as a &quot;beer &#x27;n clam&quot;, &quot;Clam Eye&quot;, or &quot;Red Eye&quot; in Western Canada, which adds Clamato to pale lagers. In 2001, Anheuser-Busch and Cadbury-Schweppes introduced a premixed version called the &quot;Budweiser and Clamato Chelada&quot; in the United States.

Adding more spices (similar to those in a Caesar) results in what is called &quot;sangre de cristo&quot; (blood of Christ) in Mexico.

== Beefamato ==

Mott&#x27;s once produced a similar beverage named Beefamato, made from beef broth and tomato juice.

<text>Priscilla Marie Winans Love, known professionally as CeCe Winans, (born October 8, 1964) is an American gospel singer who has garnered 17 Grammy Awards, the most for any female gospel singer; 31 GMA Dove Awards, 19 Stellar Awards, 7 NAACP Image Awards, 4 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, along with many other awards and honors to her credit including being one of the inaugural inductees into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia. Winans is the best-selling and most awarded female gospel singer of all time, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Music City Walk of Fame.

Winans has 19 million record sales certified by RIAA, making her one of the best-selling gospel music artists. She first rose to prominence between the 1980s as a member of the double platinum selling Gospel duo BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans with her brother, Bebe Winans; before launching her own highly acclaimed solo career. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine lists all of her solo albums as top Gospel, Christian, and R&amp;B music sellers, and six albums as a duo with her older brother Bebe.

==Early life==
Priscilla Marie Winans was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Delores and David Winans of the famed Winans Family Gospel group, on October 8, 1964. She is one of 10 children. Her parents were part of the Church of God in Christ and would only listen to gospel music. She sang her first solo at the age of eight.

==Duo with BeBe Winans==
Winans first went to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1981 as a singer on the Christian telecast &quot;The PTL Club&quot;, hosted by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Although originally part of the larger Winans family singing group, CeCe and her older brother BeBe became a duo during their time at PTL, in response to positive reactions to their version of the song &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot; sung as a duet, with lyrics changed for Christian audiences. In 1984, CeCe and Bebe released their first album, &quot;Lord Lift Us Up&quot;, for PTL Records. They achieved crossover success, eventually releasing nine Gold and Platinum recordings, billed as BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans. Winans left PTL in 1984 just before getting married. Her brother left in 1985. They released their second album in 1987: &quot;BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans&quot;. BeBe &amp; CeCe Winans are the first gospel artists to have their album &quot;Different Lifestyles&quot; sell more than a million units, only the second gospel album to do so after Amazing Grace by Aretha Franklin.

==Solo career==
Winans began her solo career with the album &quot;Alone in His Presence&quot;, released in 1995. It was only the third album by a gospel artist to sell more than a million units. CeCe, along with her brother BeBe, also hold the honor of having the first gospel album to reach platinum by a gospel artist. &quot;Alone In His Presence&quot; earned her a Grammy Award and two Dove Awards, including the Female Vocalist of the Year. Winans&#x27;s next release, the Gold-certified &quot;Everlasting Love&quot;, was released in 1998 and featured Winans&#x27; highest-charting solo singles: &quot;Well Alright&quot; and &quot;Slippin&quot;. The song &quot;On That Day&quot; from the album was written and produced by R&amp;B singer Lauryn Hill. Later that year, Winans released &quot;His Gift&quot;; a holiday album.

In 1999, Winans started her own recording company, PureSprings Gospel. Her first album on the label was &quot;Alabaster Box&quot; in 1999. Some production of the disc was done by Gospel singer and musician Fred Hammond. It included a guest appearance by Take 6. In 2000 Winans released a concert VHS titled &quot;Live at the Lambs Theater in New York&quot;. The concert contained songs from her previous albums. Winans released her next album, the self-titled &quot;CeCe Winans&quot;, in 2001. The single &quot;Anybody Wanna Pray&quot; included a guest appearance by GRITS. The second single, &quot;Say A Prayer&quot; crossed over into the Contemporary Christian music market.

Winans took a two-year break from releasing albums and returned in 2003 with &quot;Throne Room&quot;. The first 1,000 copies were issued with a bonus CD that contained exclusive interviews with the artist, the making of the CD, some touring footage, and the music video &quot;More Than What I Wanted&quot; (which came from the 2001 release). In 2004, the 25-city tour &quot;Throne Room&quot; with the group Anointed featured free admission and was followed with a DVD release of the concert recorded in Tennessee. &quot;Live in the Throne Room&quot; contained tracks from all of Winans&#x27;s albums. Around September 2004, Winans experienced what she thought was a flu but turned out to be a serious stomach infection and was hospitalized immediately for surgery. Due to the extended recovery time, the second half of the &quot;Throne Room Tour&quot; was postponed to early 2005.

Winans&#x27;s seventh album &quot;Purified&quot; was released in 2005. Her nephew Mario Winans was one of four producers. Her son Alvin III co-wrote several songs on the album, and her younger sisters Angie and Debbie performed.

Winans&#x27; collection of Top Ten R&amp;B radio hits includes &quot;Count On Me&quot;, her duet with Whitney Houston, from the &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; soundtrack. The single was certified Gold in the US and reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and No. 8 on the Billboard R&amp;B Singles chart.

Winans released her eighth album, &quot;Thy Kingdom Come&quot; on April 1, 2008, featuring the single &quot;Waging War&quot;. On October 6, 2009, a BeBe &amp; CeCe reunion album named &quot;Still&quot; was released by Malaco Records, and features collaborations with Marvin Winans and contemporary gospel sister duo Mary Mary.

On December 23, 2010, Winans, along with Bebe and Mary Mary, featuring the West Angeles Choir, performed on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

From 2012 to 2014, Winans was a judge on BET&#x27;s gospel singing competition &quot;Sunday Best&quot;, along with her brother BeBe.

In 2017, Winans released a tenth album, &quot;Let Them Fall in Love&quot;, for which she won two Grammy Awards for Best Gospel Performance/Song and Best Gospel Album. In 2021 Winans released her first live worship album, &quot;Believe for It&quot;, which won her three additional Grammy Awards (including Best Gospel Album) in April 2022.

Her latest single debuted on September 14, 2022 known as &quot;Goodness of God.&quot;

On April 26, 2024, CeCe Winans released her most anticipated second live album &#x27;More Than This&#x27; which went straight to number one on Billboard Top Gospel Album Charts, Top Christian Album charts, while the single &#x27;That&#x27;s My King&#x27; shot to number one on the Hot Gospel charts and the 1 Gospel Streaming Song.

To promote her album, CeCe Winans appeared and sang on the Kelly Clarkson show, The Jennifer Hudson show and on the season finale of American Idol singing &#x27;Goodness of God&#x27; with contestant Roman Collins.

Her 2024 Album &quot;more than this&quot; won Best Gospel Album at the 67th Grammy Award 2025. She also won Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance / Songs at the 67th Grammy Award 2025 with her song titled &quot;That&#x27;s my King&quot;

==Books==
Winans has authored four books: &quot;On A Positive Note&quot;, a memoir released August 1, 2000; &quot;Throne Room: Ushered Into the Presence of God&quot;, a devotional released January 1, 2004, and co-authored with Claire Cloninger; &quot;Always Sisters: Becoming the Princess You Were Created to Be&quot;, released on July 17, 2007, co-written with Claudia Mair Burney; and most recently, &quot;Believe For It: Passing on Faith to the Next Generation&quot;, released and published in 2024.

==Personal life==
Winans resides in Brentwood, Tennessee, a suburb of Nashville, with her husband Alvin Love II. She has two children, a son and a daughter.

Winans was a close friend of Whitney Houston and godmother to her daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown. On February 18, 2012, Winans performed the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry for Me&quot; and &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; at Houston&#x27;s funeral, at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey.

<text>Dial-a-Ride is a service run by Transport for London (TfL) which is mainly a door-to-door community transport service for people with a permanent or long term disability or health problem who are unable, or virtually unable to use public transport. In 2019, there were around 40,000 members of the scheme.

==History==
In December 1972, London Transport began operating a dial a ride service in Hampstead, aimed at both commuters and shoppers. This ended in 1976 due to high costs.

In 1982, Camden Council set up London&#x27;s first dial a ride scheme for disabled residents, with funding from the Greater London Council (GLC). Several London councils including Greenwich soon followed. Following the successful development of GAD-about in Greenwich, a clone prototype project was developed for London Transport which was then handed over in a modular form to allow easy implementation and scaling up. By the late 1980s, there were over 25 dial a ride groups across London, subsidised by a £7.2m grant from London Regional Transport.
Until 2002, the London Dial-a-Ride service consisted of six sectors, each of which had its own main colour on the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter minibuses:

Since 2002, Dial-a-Ride has been run and funded solely by TfL. In 2012, TfL began replacing the entire Dial-a-Ride fleet at a cost of £3.9 million.

==Fleet==
, the fleet comprises 256 accessible vehicles, all Mellor Tucana low floor minibuses, built on the Volkswagen Transporter platform. The fleet meets Euro VI emission standards, and therefore is Ultra Low Emission Zone compliant. Historically, a range of vehicles have been used including Mercedes-Benz Sprinter and Vito minibuses.

== Taxicard ==
The &#x27;Taxicard&#x27; scheme provides subsidised taxi and private hire journeys for Londoners with serious mobility or visual issues, with around 60,000 members registered to the scheme. The scheme is run by London Councils.
